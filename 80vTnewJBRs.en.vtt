00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.016
Today we have decided to have Krishna Puja

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:04.357
 because America is the Krishna bhoomi.

00:01:10.257 --> 00:01:16.130
 It's very surprising that such a great incarnation of Shri Krishna

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.908
came even much later than Rama

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:26.972
 and has sent His special people to live in America.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.385
 Of course, there are many who are seeking in this country, no doubt.

00:01:36.383 --> 00:01:40.080
 But there are many who are also misleading them.

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:48.423
That's how you find, despite all our effort, we have not been able

00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:54.358
 to expand Sahaja Yoga very much.

00:01:58.872 --> 00:02:04.001
What one has to learn from His life  is very, very important.

00:02:05.715 --> 00:02:10.967
 The first and foremost thing He taught was collectivity.

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:17.578
 He used to get hold of small boys

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:25.056
and play with them together.

00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:30.307
Rama didn't do that.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.949
He used to get hold of ladies

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.252
 who were selling milk and also butter,

00:02:47.026 --> 00:02:53.651
those who used to go to fill their water in the pitcher.

00:02:56.895 --> 00:03:06.578
 He is the one who collected all such people in the village of Gokul.

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:18.032
 He played all kinds of pranks on His friends

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:25.298
 and His mother and the mother's friends.

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:34.279
Behaved just like a very naughty child, just to show

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:39.213
that He was just like all of us.

00:03:41.403 --> 00:03:45.342
As you know, He was the incarnation of Shri Vishnu.

00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:48.780
 First Shri Rama was born,

00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:55.749
 took incarnation as Shri Rama,

00:03:57.598 --> 00:04:01.795
 which was in the Aryan race,

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:10.570
 means that time we had an Aryan race which was sort of superior,

00:04:12.555 --> 00:04:18.385
 superior race than others. But when He came as Krishna,

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:29.080
He took His birth in Yadav dynasty, you can call it.

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:34.647
 They were not superior, they were selling milk,

00:04:35.723 --> 00:04:42.723
 having cowherds and doing work

00:04:44.118 --> 00:04:47.756
not of any religious style.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:54.202
 But they were innocent simple people living in the villages,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.780
and they saw the great miracles of Shri Krishna's childhood.

00:05:03.844 --> 00:05:08.223
 He killed demons. He killed Pootna.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.856
 All these people were sent by His uncle Kamsa to kill him.

00:05:19.657 --> 00:05:24.133
It was to be, because He had to prove that He was the incarnation

00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:26.612
of Shri Vishnu and He did it.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.535
As a child, how He killed those people is remarkable.

00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:37.235
 And how He made them out though they were all camouflaged.

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:47.001
In these modern times, difficult for people to believe

00:05:47.206 --> 00:05:51.775
 that there could have been any incarnation like Shri Krishna.

00:05:53.442 --> 00:06:01.292
 But in Sahaja Yoga, we have method of

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:06.525
absolutely establishing the truth that Shri Krishna was there

00:06:06.827 --> 00:06:09.184
 ruling on the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.926
 From His childhood, you can see He was fond of collectivity.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:20.281
And He tried to create collectivity of people

00:06:21.128 --> 00:06:26.942
who were very simple, uneducated, good hearted people.

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:30.858
And that is His special quality.

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:37.866
And all the people of that village knew Him very well,

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:43.292
 all cared for Him. And when He had to go,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:51.132
 they felt very sad and all of them came running and crying for Him.

00:06:51.747 --> 00:06:54.588
It was a small boy who was going.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:07:02.124
 After all, what is there? A little boy from the village is going.

00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:05.124
The whole village had gathered to cry for Him.

00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:17.066
That is what we all Sahaja Yogis

00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:20.462
 have to know.  As a child also,

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:24.399
He was a very collective personality.

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:27.906
 He actually emits collectiveness.

00:07:28.232 --> 00:07:32.828
The collective consciousness that you enjoy is because of His bliss.

00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:43.643
 I find that Americans

00:07:44.603 --> 00:07:46.301
 are very collective in the sense,

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:49.825
they are more bothered about other countries than about their own.

00:07:50.886 --> 00:07:53.760
They want to go all the way to Vietnam,

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:58.432
 now to Iraq, now to some other place.

00:07:59.441 --> 00:08:04.412
Going all over the world, they try to correct.

00:08:05.126 --> 00:08:12.132
But their own country they do not see what's wrong. It's so divided.

00:08:14.074 --> 00:08:20.435
Mainly divided on race, racial discrimination,

00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:26.011
 is divided by religions

00:08:27.487 --> 00:08:30.987
and all of these are just concepts

00:08:31.566 --> 00:08:36.560
 which they have accepted and are fighting among themselves.

00:08:39.575 --> 00:08:47.509
Now after all these, there are people

00:08:48.373 --> 00:08:52.532
 who believe they are born criminals and they should be criminals.

00:08:55.023 --> 00:09:00.138
 And their criminality is going very far.

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:03.728
 They are gangsters.

00:09:04.054 --> 00:09:09.109
 Even small children have become gangsters.

00:09:09.627 --> 00:09:14.751
 But the worst part is that these little boys also,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:21.629
 including others, all these criminals are regarded as big heroes.

00:09:25.905 --> 00:09:33.189
I have seen once, a young boy wearing a shirt

00:09:34.216 --> 00:09:36.866
 with another young boy's photograph on it.

00:09:38.951 --> 00:09:42.059
So he told Me. I said, "Who's this?" "You don't know?

00:09:42.472 --> 00:09:44.472
 Very famous gangster", he said.

00:09:45.887 --> 00:09:49.727
At the age of thirteen years he is a very famous gangster

00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:52.893
 and this boy is very proudly putting up that

00:09:53.266 --> 00:10:00.233
 - like a big hero, or you can call it like a God there.

00:10:03.956 --> 00:10:07.009
 So see the perversion to what limit

00:10:07.985 --> 00:10:12.088
 Shri Krishna's blessings have been used.

00:10:13.797 --> 00:10:17.081
 That's why this country is very difficult.

00:10:20.296 --> 00:10:26.214
One after another there has been attack of negativity.

00:10:27.277 --> 00:10:31.960
For example, first thing started by Christians,

00:10:32.596 --> 00:10:35.040
who said that Jews killed Christ.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.260
He never...  It's not true, it's not true. He was never killed

00:10:40.655 --> 00:10:45.727
 by Jews.  "Christ was killed by Jews", is a false statement,

00:10:46.235 --> 00:10:51.050
absolutely. Christ was not killed by Jews.

00:10:52.534 --> 00:10:55.714
 How can a multitude kill a man?

00:10:56.938 --> 00:10:59.811
 It's the law there.

00:11:00.343 --> 00:11:06.501
The Romans, or we can call the Roman law crucified Him.

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:12.328
 So the Christians started nicely torturing the Jews,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.828
because Christ was killed.

00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:18.166
 I don't know how to explain this.

00:11:19.116 --> 00:11:21.753
Such absurd idea.

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:25.950
Now somebody was killed so many years back,

00:11:26.496 --> 00:11:29.630
 and now what's the use of killing some

00:11:30.035 --> 00:11:33.842
grandchildren of those people or great grandchildren of those people?

00:11:34.573 --> 00:11:37.744
 But they did not, the Jews did not.

00:11:40.488 --> 00:11:45.122
 Still this concept was there that the Jews killed.

00:11:46.995 --> 00:11:55.493
 And the Christians felt they have a right to torture the Jews.

00:11:56.923 --> 00:11:59.029
So when the Jews came here,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.957
 they were never given a good position, they were tortured very much

00:12:03.336 --> 00:12:05.037
 and troubled very much.

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:08.878
It happened everywhere but very much more here.

00:12:10.251 --> 00:12:15.680
 So among Jews now came out some devils, like Freud.

00:12:17.347 --> 00:12:22.499
 And he said, "All right. We must shatter these Christians

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:32.080
 absolutely. Their moral roots must be finished.

00:12:32.729 --> 00:12:40.992
" So he started his own psychology to destroy the Christians.

00:12:42.522 --> 00:12:45.595
And Christians stupidly accepted it.

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:50.799
 They did whatever he said,

00:12:52.863 --> 00:12:59.685
 experimented whatever he did.

00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:03.591
When I was once in Switzerland, two girls came

00:13:04.378 --> 00:13:08.163
and they were shaking in the program.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.932
I couldn't understand. I called them. I said, "Why are you shaking?"

00:13:13.481 --> 00:13:17.399
 So they said that, "Actually we are

00:13:19.987 --> 00:13:27.216
very much degree holders in Freudian  knowledge

00:13:27.618 --> 00:13:30.570
and we have done all experiments of Freud."

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:36.766
"And then why are you shaking?" "Because we have power to shake!"

00:13:41.735 --> 00:13:44.025
So they followed this Freud

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:50.280
and this vindictiveness that was there was not seen by anyone,

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:52.613
even by Jews.

00:13:58.097 --> 00:14:05.462
As a result we had people who were deadly against each other

00:14:06.252 --> 00:14:09.611
and ruining each other, destroying each other.

00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:18.017
Then this Black and White business started.

00:14:20.314 --> 00:14:23.773
 All kinds of theories people are putting up

00:14:25.089 --> 00:14:30.647
to show that the Blacks are bad or the Whites are bad.

00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:35.199
The difference is only skin deep.

00:14:36.762 --> 00:14:40.455
If you want you can cut the skin and see for yourself.

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:46.838
 Inside body is the same. But it was so.

00:14:47.422 --> 00:14:54.422
This divisive method started and it's still going on.

00:14:57.194 --> 00:15:02.108
 I always say, without Blacks, Americans

00:15:03.726 --> 00:15:07.383
 will be left high and dry.

00:15:07.996 --> 00:15:10.313
 Look at the talent they have.

00:15:12.297 --> 00:15:15.961
Not only music. Atlanta, I saw,

00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:19.802
 all the Blacks were winning and Whites were not anywhere.

00:15:22.472 --> 00:15:25.735
Very nicely they used to run,

00:15:26.135 --> 00:15:29.974
very swiftly at the end of it, you see.

00:15:30.403 --> 00:15:32.899
And all the Whites were saying, "Ha, ha, ha."

00:15:33.169 --> 00:15:35.994
 They were nicely enjoying their beauty.

00:15:37.724 --> 00:15:40.572
You don't have the stamina of the Blacks also.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.615
 So in games also, same thing.

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:51.125
With all this what is going to happen to America?

00:15:51.588 --> 00:15:56.360
 It's a country which has to be collective because of Shri Krishna.

00:15:58.043 --> 00:16:01.995
 All of them are immigrants here. Who is not an immigrant?

00:16:03.116 --> 00:16:06.735
 Whether they came earlier or later doesn't matter.

00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:10.687
Thank God, I have told you many a times that Columbus lost his way

00:16:10.957 --> 00:16:14.280
and came here and not to India. Otherwise, there would have been

00:16:14.526 --> 00:16:17.643
no Indians left and no Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:20.282 --> 00:16:23.773
 I think it was the trick of Hanumana.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.106
 He misled him and Columbus came here. Thank God.

00:16:35.152 --> 00:16:41.707
Now you are in a country where you have to be collective.

00:16:43.527 --> 00:16:47.337
Krishna won't spare you unless and until you are collective

00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:53.473
 or you give up this nonsense of skin-deep differences.

00:16:54.235 --> 00:16:56.169
Then religious differences.

00:16:56.709 --> 00:17:04.697
 He had a friend who was lame by one leg.

00:17:05.937 --> 00:17:09.302
 He had some friends who were very black.

00:17:09.794 --> 00:17:13.217
He had some friends who were quite

00:17:14.058 --> 00:17:18.334
 Indian white, I should say. I shouldn't say white like you people, but Indian white.

00:17:19.263 --> 00:17:21.422
 He had all kinds of colors.

00:17:22.602 --> 00:17:25.890
And He took His own birth in the Yadav vansh.

00:17:26.304 --> 00:17:35.238
They were milk sellers, milkmen who used to sell milk to people.

00:17:37.348 --> 00:17:43.502
 He didn't take His birth in a very royal family like Shri Rama.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:51.485
 Though He was, because later on He became the king of Dwarika.

00:17:53.492 --> 00:17:59.777
But in His style, in His behavior, in His life,

00:18:01.465 --> 00:18:06.955
nobody could see that He was a royal personality.

00:18:08.499 --> 00:18:11.435
 He could sleep under a tree.

00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:16.023
He could eat anything that He could get.

00:18:16.746 --> 00:18:20.245
All kinds of sweet, sweet stories you can read in His life,

00:18:21.116 --> 00:18:26.757
 showing how He was enjoying His collectivity,

00:18:28.298 --> 00:18:30.162
never showing off.

00:18:32.095 --> 00:18:38.171
And His collectivity has to be worked out in this country.

00:18:39.468 --> 00:18:45.036
 Unless and until it is done from your heart,

00:18:46.362 --> 00:18:48.753
it's not going to work out.

00:18:51.769 --> 00:18:55.795
We had problems like this always with our collectivity here.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.858
 For example, a lady, you know, she is a big lady, I think.

00:19:01.242 --> 00:19:04.272
She started correcting people. "Why do you put here?

00:19:04.503 --> 00:19:07.367
This thing is getting dirty.  That thing is this and that."

00:19:08.556 --> 00:19:14.490
 Such a woman should be sometimes sent to some stable to clean it.

00:19:15.727 --> 00:19:19.984
 Then she will give up these nonsensical ideas that she has.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.404
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you cannot behave like this.

00:19:26.585 --> 00:19:30.555
And this kind of a behavior can destroy Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:31.944 --> 00:19:35.650
Have you ever heard Me saying that, "This is dirty,

00:19:35.918 --> 00:19:40.143
 this is not good, I don't like this?" Did I say, ever?

00:19:46.572 --> 00:19:51.070
First of all, we have to understand,  if we have to be collective,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.975
 we should give up these stupid ideas about ourselves.

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:04.651
 Some people get some position, may be some money,

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.832
 maybe, I would say, have a background.

00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:14.433
 If you are sticking on to it then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:15.995 --> 00:20:17.876
You are saints.

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:23.630
You cannot be demanding.

00:20:25.318 --> 00:20:29.809
You have to give, and give, and give.

00:20:31.108 --> 00:20:34.002
 Whatever may be your position in life,

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.489
 if that can overpower you then you are not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:20:45.876 --> 00:20:53.854
Shri Krishna, who is the Virat, who is the great primordial personality,

00:20:55.734 --> 00:21:02.396
 didn't show any such signs of His greatness.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.954
 But Americans have a specialty

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.161
to show that they are something outstandingly great.

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:18.280
 But Sahaja Yogis, please don't learn those things.

00:21:18.919 --> 00:21:21.593
 You have to make others unlearn.

00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:32.170
 If that cannot happen, it's better to leave Sahaja Yoga for ever.

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:38.842
 Such people will make everyone miserable

00:21:39.129 --> 00:21:42.676
 and destroy Sahaja Yoga in America.

00:21:45.052 --> 00:21:52.052
Even about protocol, you should become timeless.

00:21:54.729 --> 00:22:00.424
Absolutely timeless. Now, if you are particular

00:22:02.296 --> 00:22:06.469
about time, Shri Krishna will play His tricks and your timing

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:10.168
will be finished.  Happened yesterday.

00:22:17.257 --> 00:22:22.601
So one has to know that time is your slave

00:22:24.494 --> 00:22:27.485
 and you don't have to be the slave of time

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:32.313
- if you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise, you are not. That means

00:22:32.662 --> 00:22:36.575
 you are guided not by the Divine.

00:22:38.336 --> 00:22:41.868
 The Divine works out everything very well.

00:22:42.297 --> 00:22:44.455
 But for whom? For Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:44.779 --> 00:22:48.810
But if you are not Sahaja Yogis, you'll topple down.

00:22:53.164 --> 00:22:54.955
In every way

00:22:55.853 --> 00:23:00.408
you should find out what things we have accumulated among ourselves,

00:23:02.002 --> 00:23:04.512
 which is not Shri Krishna's quality.

00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:10.851
 Now, Shri Krishna used to steal as a child,

00:23:11.351 --> 00:23:15.248
the butter from the ladies, why?

00:23:17.334 --> 00:23:20.400
 Why did He steal the butter? Because

00:23:21.393 --> 00:23:27.303
 they were selling it to the military of Kamsa,

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.084
 His uncle, who was a devil.

00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:37.025
They used to go all the way to sell him in Mathura.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.851
So He used to steal it, because children needed it,

00:23:43.288 --> 00:23:46.309
 and giving it to children. He didn't like this idea -

00:23:46.742 --> 00:23:51.190
 why should it go to

00:23:53.523 --> 00:23:57.563
 these horrible rakshasas of Mathura?

00:23:59.492 --> 00:24:01.836
Just the opposite in is America.

00:24:03.226 --> 00:24:07.173
 All the false gurus, all the rakshasas come here

00:24:07.618 --> 00:24:09.681
 and they get all the butter.

00:24:14.407 --> 00:24:18.104
 As if people have no brains

00:24:20.941 --> 00:24:28.763
to understand, while Shri Krishna is the brain of the Virat.

00:24:30.905 --> 00:24:34.790
But here you find that people have no brains. Anybody comes,

00:24:35.084 --> 00:24:38.242
 says something, "Ah, ha, ha, great."

00:24:39.806 --> 00:24:41.621
 Somebody talks big - all right.

00:24:42.431 --> 00:24:45.774
They will give away their money. They will give away their houses.

00:24:46.044 --> 00:24:48.218
 Their children they'll remove from the school -

00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:50.798
 for something extremely stupid.

00:24:54.273 --> 00:25:00.069
While He is the brain in the body of Virata.

00:25:02.592 --> 00:25:05.329
 So this kind of brainlessness comes

00:25:07.393 --> 00:25:10.854
 and we really start, even Sahaja Yogis start

00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:14.751
 behaving in a manner that shows they are really brainless.

00:25:22.396 --> 00:25:25.472
Apart from that, He is Kubera.

00:25:25.951 --> 00:25:28.380
 He is the God of wealth.

00:25:28.885 --> 00:25:31.586
 That's why there is wealth in this country.

00:25:33.285 --> 00:25:36.255
 But this wealth is all becoming debts, you see,

00:25:36.637 --> 00:25:39.644
because of the special brains of Americans.

00:25:42.215 --> 00:25:46.083
They are so stupid that whatever is selling in the market,

00:25:46.798 --> 00:25:48.869
 whether they need it or not, they'll buy.

00:25:49.242 --> 00:25:52.591
Take loan, again take loan, take loan

00:25:53.337 --> 00:25:56.353
till they are absolutely indebted.

00:25:57.604 --> 00:26:00.909
Now here in the country of Kubera

00:26:01.505 --> 00:26:06.362
you should be really rich. Rich doesn't mean

00:26:06.947 --> 00:26:11.231
 just to have bank balance, but means by temperament.

00:26:14.901 --> 00:26:17.763
Now it's much better but once upon a time,

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.779
Americans were the most miserly Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:24.697 --> 00:26:30.727
They used to send Me candles as present and I used to hide that.

00:26:33.596 --> 00:26:36.972
I said, "Baba why do you send candles, even? Don't send anything,

00:26:37.497 --> 00:26:40.575
 because everybody is going to see those candles

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.932
and what are they going to say about it, that candles have been sent."

00:26:46.726 --> 00:26:50.245
 Now, this I am talking for introspection.

00:26:51.698 --> 00:26:53.460
Are we collective?

00:26:53.761 --> 00:27:00.674
 Are we willing to share everything that we have?

00:27:05.028 --> 00:27:09.314
 Do we look down upon people who come from other countries?

00:27:10.615 --> 00:27:14.049
Do we have racialism in us?

00:27:14.656 --> 00:27:17.457
 Thirty five Sahaja Yogis came from Australia,

00:27:17.751 --> 00:27:21.747
 to America as if this is some Haj.

00:27:22.313 --> 00:27:25.090
 They went back with very bad vibrations.

00:27:26.646 --> 00:27:29.385
 Out of them half were thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:30.123 --> 00:27:35.819
 Imagine Australia is a country where they used to send all the criminals.

00:27:39.498 --> 00:27:46.016
So first and foremost, to judge yourself is to see your vibrations.

00:27:46.967 --> 00:27:48.927
 That you should meditate

00:27:49.252 --> 00:27:53.812
and judge your vibrations if you are really collective or not.

00:27:56.882 --> 00:28:01.402
Because you are not like that, Sahaja Yoga does not spread.

00:28:03.204 --> 00:28:07.663
I have seen people from Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

00:28:12.532 --> 00:28:15.003
 Poor things have found nothing.

00:28:15.973 --> 00:28:21.225
They get up at four o'clock, start their Hare Rama Hare Krishna bhajan - four o'clock.

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:26.745
Then the whole day they wear a very thin dhot

00:28:27.057 --> 00:28:29.049
i in which they are shivering.

00:28:29.644 --> 00:28:32.695
They shave their heads and put a ...

00:28:34.044 --> 00:28:38.155
pig's tail here  which is bought in the market.

00:28:41.212 --> 00:28:44.561
 If you see their dedication you'll be surprised.

00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:48.410
How they are so much dedicated,

00:28:49.001 --> 00:28:52.175
 when they haven't found anything whatsoever?

00:28:53.824 --> 00:28:58.220
What about the nuns? You see them, you will be amazed.

00:28:58.866 --> 00:29:04.410
 One fellow came from the Catholic Church to us.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:09.146
 He was trying to be a priest.

00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:13.868
He said, "Mother, Sahaja Yog - you don't do anything.

00:29:14.083 --> 00:29:16.347
" I said, "What do you want to do?"

00:29:16.641 --> 00:29:20.982
"No, there we could not eat any meat on Fridays.

00:29:21.995 --> 00:29:25.991
On Saturdays, we could not drink anything.

00:29:26.817 --> 00:29:32.631
Then on Sundays, the whole day we had to fast and pray to God."

00:29:33.931 --> 00:29:36.320
"Then - what about the rest of the time?"

00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:41.498
"The rest of the time, we had to remember Bible by heart

00:29:43.227 --> 00:29:45.049
 and then recite it.

00:29:45.605 --> 00:29:48.706
And if we made even one mistake, the Father

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:52.150
would give us a nice beating."

00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:58.005
That's another problem with Sahaja Yoga

00:29:58.982 --> 00:30:05.101
because it is Shri Krishna's play. It's so simple.

00:30:06.018 --> 00:30:09.069
You don't have to do anything of the kind.

00:30:10.689 --> 00:30:14.145
 No disciplining, nothing. Left to you,

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.931
 you are your own master. You are your own guru.

00:30:20.898 --> 00:30:24.051
 But these things which are lingering in your mind,

00:30:24.494 --> 00:30:27.756
 which was just the opposite of Shri Krishna's life,

00:30:28.138 --> 00:30:30.685
which you have acquired in this country,

00:30:31.477 --> 00:30:35.508
 are still there, here and there, here and there left.

00:30:38.623 --> 00:30:44.153
Some of the people are really  still so much

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:49.690
 busy with themselves. They look so pale, thin - I tell you,

00:30:49.905 --> 00:30:52.063
 I can't believe they are Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:56.958 --> 00:31:01.056
So when we see Shri Krishna's life, the way He lived.

00:31:02.262 --> 00:31:08.480
 And then He went to help the Pandavas.

00:31:11.163 --> 00:31:17.561
He told Arjuna that, "I can be your charioteer.

00:31:17.886 --> 00:31:21.803
I can drive your chariot. But I will not fight."

00:31:24.076 --> 00:31:26.544
Arjuna knew that He was all powerful,

00:31:26.727 --> 00:31:28.870
 if He is there everything will work out.

00:31:30.275 --> 00:31:34.579
 "And all My army, I'll give to Kauravas, to see the balance."

00:31:36.201 --> 00:31:38.066
He said, "All right."

00:31:39.557 --> 00:31:44.623
 He didn't fight to show off, I am this, I am that.

00:31:45.544 --> 00:31:49.845
 Like here, "Mother, I am the leader.

00:31:51.217 --> 00:31:55.499
I am the leader." "Can't hear, I can't hear."

00:31:59.512 --> 00:32:02.396
 "Mother, I am this."

00:32:03.507 --> 00:32:06.134
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:32:07.997 --> 00:32:11.984
It's a very great name that you have achieved.

00:32:12.421 --> 00:32:15.365
 The highest position you have achieved.

00:32:16.444 --> 00:32:19.604
There's nothing more to be achieved.

00:32:21.679 --> 00:32:24.052
Like somebody asked Me, "Mother,

00:32:24.334 --> 00:32:28.573
the Indians in India never catch. Why do we go on catching all the time?"

00:32:28.976 --> 00:32:32.665
I said, "Because Indians in India know they have achieved it now.

00:32:32.864 --> 00:32:34.270
Nothing to be achieved.

00:32:34.484 --> 00:32:38.488
You want to have God's Realization - I don't know what other Realization.

00:32:38.845 --> 00:32:40.694
They don't think like that.

00:32:42.754 --> 00:32:45.434
They say, "We have achieved now. We are in the sea.

00:32:45.585 --> 00:32:47.759
 It's for us to swim over."

00:32:52.939 --> 00:32:56.905
All these things some of you have crossed over,

00:32:57.096 --> 00:33:00.683
some of you have absolutely lost them.

00:33:00.975 --> 00:33:02.612
But some of you are still there.

00:33:02.827 --> 00:33:05.668
They are the most dangerous thing as Christ has said,

00:33:05.878 --> 00:33:08.601
"Be careful of the murmuring souls."

00:33:14.734 --> 00:33:20.880
 I don't know how to stop this little rat-like people,

00:33:21.088 --> 00:33:24.441
 who are cutting the nest of Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:31.073
I've been reported about many and I am really shocked.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.893
After so many years of My visit

00:33:35.529 --> 00:33:38.600
 how can people talk ill of each other

00:33:39.402 --> 00:33:42.092
 and can create these problems?

00:33:45.305 --> 00:33:47.265
Shri Krishna's friendship

00:33:48.892 --> 00:33:52.384
 is well known, you know with Sudama how He behaved.

00:33:54.321 --> 00:34:02.480
All His beautiful manifestations must show in your character.

00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:06.610
 Then only this country can be saved.

00:34:07.465 --> 00:34:10.603
 I must say it's nowhere, we have Canada,

00:34:11.086 --> 00:34:18.841
we have people also I am told from Austria.

00:34:20.111 --> 00:34:22.904
 From all over, from England.

00:34:25.007 --> 00:34:30.124
 But still, we are not so many people as we should have been.

00:34:32.467 --> 00:34:35.740
 If you just take Austrians, they must be double of this.

00:34:38.391 --> 00:34:41.434
 If they could do it, why can't we do it?

00:34:43.722 --> 00:34:45.879
 Because we do not introspect

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.768
and we do not grow out of our egos.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.968
They will say that, "Why didn't Krishna meditate?"

00:34:56.455 --> 00:34:59.717
 You have to meditate on Shri Krishna.

00:35:00.137 --> 00:35:02.680
If He meditates what will happen to you all?

00:35:10.455 --> 00:35:15.258
On the whole, I was very happy with the other day's program somehow.

00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:19.975
Despite, as usual, in New York,

00:35:21.393 --> 00:35:27.202
 our inability to really do good advertising,

00:35:27.519 --> 00:35:29.717
 unsystematic everything.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:36.885
Despite that we had so many people and I put the responsibility on them

00:35:37.423 --> 00:35:42.653
 Because that's the thing - it is Shri Krishna's responsibility.

00:35:45.556 --> 00:35:49.937
 And that is what is your responsibility now.

00:35:50.737 --> 00:35:57.156
You are responsible for America and Canada,

00:35:59.291 --> 00:36:00.868
South America.

00:36:01.249 --> 00:36:07.817
 You all are responsible and you people should be such  that

00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:14.472
 people who see you listen to you, are with you,

00:36:14.775 --> 00:36:19.780
 should know that these are the Gopa and Gopis of Shri Krishna.

00:36:22.408 --> 00:36:28.042
Unless and until that happens this America is the most difficult place

00:36:28.598 --> 00:36:31.885
 Sometimes I feel it's not Gokul but Mathura.

00:36:34.913 --> 00:36:39.264
So it is for you, and otherwise you cannot enjoy.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:44.232
 If you live with your all old clothes, you can't enjoy.

00:36:47.044 --> 00:36:49.115
 I must say this time

00:36:49.322 --> 00:36:52.798
there were so many people and I have asked them to promise,

00:36:53.314 --> 00:36:58.669
 and put a bandhan on them, and I'm sure they will try

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.598
 to keep My promise. I am sure.

00:37:03.872 --> 00:37:06.702
But it is you people who disappoint them.

00:37:08.763 --> 00:37:11.413
When they see you, they are disappointed.

00:37:13.946 --> 00:37:17.527
Actually, here is the first time, Vishwa Nirmala Dharma

00:37:17.821 --> 00:37:22.677
 has been established as a religion.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:32.474
It is. But the rest of it is zero.

00:37:36.282 --> 00:37:41.063
So all this differences and divisiveness

00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:45.055
has to finish and we should be one

00:37:45.238 --> 00:37:48.904
 in the collective nature of Shri Krishna.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:56.821
First, meditation is very important.

00:37:57.408 --> 00:38:00.501
 Introspection is very important.

00:38:02.851 --> 00:38:08.106
And also, meeting each other, talking to each other,

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:11.403
 knowing each other is very important.

00:38:16.576 --> 00:38:18.126
 It has worked all over.

00:38:18.277 --> 00:38:22.213
 It has worked out in India tremendously, Russia tremendously,

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:26.398
 Bulgaria tremendously, so why not here?

00:38:28.184 --> 00:38:32.512
 It's no fashion for brainless people.

00:38:35.247 --> 00:38:40.715
It is a living process which has to take place

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.587
where you must mature.

00:38:43.891 --> 00:38:48.124
And what I find that Americans are not matured.

00:38:49.775 --> 00:38:51.934
But you are now mature.

00:38:53.929 --> 00:38:55.960
You are now mature people.

00:38:56.638 --> 00:39:01.518
 And I hope you will all behave like mature people henceforth.

00:39:03.909 --> 00:39:06.584
So may God bless you!

00:39:21.327 --> 00:39:24.657
There are Shri Krishna's names they have written down

00:39:25.942 --> 00:39:31.819
 and I would request leaders to come on the stage.

00:39:37.882 --> 00:39:42.055
 Now try to understand every word, every name of Shri Krishna.
