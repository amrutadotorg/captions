'Saha' means with, 'ja' means born, so
it is born with you, the right, to become

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:21.580
united, which is the yoga with the Divine.
We have two sides in our system of,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.479
Autonomous Nervous System - left and right
- which we call as Left and Right Sympathetic

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:36.955
Nervous System. The left side caters for
our emotions, for our past, our desires.

00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:44.982
The right side caters for our action, 
physical and mental. If you indulge into one

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:50.224
too much and go too far with it, you
develop an imbalance within yourself.

00:00:51.398 --> 00:00:56.118
In the center lies the third power, which
we call as Para Sympathetic Nervous System

00:00:56.636 --> 00:01:01.796
This is the channel, which is the central
path of ascent. When the Kundalini rises

00:01:01.796 --> 00:01:08.798
through it, it brings you in the balance
because it rises in the center of the system.

00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:14.128
So, this is the minimum that happens that
you develop to your balance. This is the

00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:19.469
last breakthrough of or evolution, where
you have to get connected with the Divine,

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:25.580
you have to feel it on your Central Nervous
System and that's how you get your
Self-realization.
