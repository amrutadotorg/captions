00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:11.340
The seat of the Spirit is on top of your head here,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:19.067
but He resides in human beings in the heart;
of course it comes out also and watches you.

00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:26.160
It is not in our conscious mind, it
resides and watches the whole field.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.587
In Gita He's called as Kshetragya, the one
who knows the field, the knower of the field.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:37.140
He knows everything, He watches; He's
just watching, where we go, what we do,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.820
what compromises we make, how we run after our seeking,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.867
how we go to falsehood, what
we do; everything it is watching.

00:00:48.947 --> 00:00:55.558
The Holy Ghost is the one which receives
the information and records everything in itself

00:00:55.638 --> 00:01:04.387
but the information is given by the deity
who is the seed or the spirit of Jesus Christ

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:09.627
who is sitting down there, Ganesha.

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:19.867
The Spirit itself is Sat-Chitt-Ananda.

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:27.107
He exists in the state of truth.

00:01:29.587 --> 00:01:32.747
Now we do not know what truth is.

00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:37.714
People say, "God is Love, God is Truth."

00:01:37.794 --> 00:01:41.907
Now what is the truth?

00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:49.621
The truth is this all-pervading power.

00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:59.072
And this all-pervading power
is the nature of the Spirit,

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:11.114
which gives you the absolute knowledge;
now mark it; absolute knowledge.

00:02:11.194 --> 00:02:20.085
For example, if you have to
say, "What is the shape of this ...?"

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:23.002
You will say, "It's a pyramid."

00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:32.204
All right, but is it a good thing to
have a pyramid for a church or not?

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:37.724
There could be hundred opinions on that.

00:02:37.804 --> 00:02:45.084
But if you ask Me, or ask any Sahaj
yogi, they said, "Yes, it has to be a pyramid."

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:46.764
Why?

00:02:46.844 --> 00:02:52.364
Because in a pyramid there is a
coefficience and you feel the vibrations.

00:02:52.444 --> 00:03:00.124
It's absolutely, absolute knowledge.

00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:03.644
That's the truth you know.

00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:09.444
You want to know if a person is fake or not.

00:03:09.524 --> 00:03:19.844
You just put your hands like this
and ask a question, "Is he true?"

00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:24.204
Your vibrations will stop, you may even get blisters,

00:03:24.284 --> 00:03:29.079
if you ask such a question about someone.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.764
So you do not know through your mental activity.

00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:35.264
A person may look very nice, as I told you,

00:03:35.344 --> 00:03:40.758
he may behave in such a manner, that
you'll feel, "Oh, what a fine man he is."

00:03:40.838 --> 00:03:45.724
Is such and such person is a realized soul or not?

00:03:45.804 --> 00:03:47.891
How will you know?

00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:50.898
You'll just put your hands towards that person

00:03:50.978 --> 00:03:55.204
and you'll start getting the vibrations
from that person; you'll enjoy them.

00:03:55.284 --> 00:04:03.385
Only after realization only we can
really enjoy other person - really enjoy.

00:04:03.465 --> 00:04:10.145
The second thing, the nature of Spirit
is that He's chitta, He's the attention.

00:04:10.225 --> 00:04:15.206
He's the attention means when
you become spiritually enlightened

00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:19.889
your attention becomes enlightened.

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:25.694
Now enlightenment, what we understand of
these lights is that the lights are falling here,

00:04:25.774 --> 00:04:28.505
and we can see things, that's all.

00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:36.539
But this attention which is
being enlightened, acts, it works,

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:42.465
it has got loops, it has got weapons, it works.

00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:52.730
You have to see for yourself how your attention works.

00:04:54.105 --> 00:05:02.828
Today there was somebody who
went and told one of the Sahaj yginis that

00:05:02.908 --> 00:05:06.558
"I was sitting there and I was
getting all negative thoughts

00:05:06.638 --> 00:05:12.125
and was feeling horrible in my hands and I
don't know why it was happening in the program."

00:05:12.205 --> 00:05:19.698
So she said, "Here you have come to
pay attention to Mother and to Her work

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.846
and pay attention to your Spirit.

00:05:21.927 --> 00:05:25.765
But if you are paying attention
to all the rest of the people here,

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:29.145
then you are going to catch them."

00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:33.944
Is a very simple thing, "Where is your attention?"

00:05:34.024 --> 00:05:35.305
Ask this question.

00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:41.878
This is a very common question in an Indian home,
a mother will ask the child, "Where is your attention?"

00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:50.643
The basis of Indian life is chitta nirodh,
is to fix your attention in a proper way.

00:05:50.723 --> 00:05:54.163
Where is your attention?

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.946
Is it on your Spirit?

00:05:58.026 --> 00:06:05.315
Or is it on somebody else, like, "My brother
is sitting here, my mother is sitting there,

00:06:05.395 --> 00:06:10.783
oh, that woman is very bad, she's
jealous of me," all this nonsense.

00:06:10.863 --> 00:06:13.545
Where is your attention?

00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:20.900
When you get realized then you start
seeing through the window of the Spirit,

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.265
your position changes.

00:06:23.345 --> 00:06:33.175
As you're looking at Me now, then you come
back here and start looking at you this way.

00:06:33.255 --> 00:06:43.305
Till you are realized you are sitting before
Me, but once you are realized you come here

00:06:43.385 --> 00:06:48.505
and see others from there, that's your fort.

00:06:48.585 --> 00:06:51.665
Nobody can touch you there.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:57.745
From there you see others, your attention is detached.

00:06:57.825 --> 00:07:04.274
So the attention becomes enlightened after realization.

00:07:04.354 --> 00:07:06.767
You pay attention to anything, it works.

00:07:06.847 --> 00:07:10.101
It does work, no doubt, you try.

00:07:10.181 --> 00:07:15.942
Those who have got realization should try this.

00:07:16.022 --> 00:07:21.423
Try your attention, but attention has to be pure.

00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:27.698
You have to purify your attention,
and the best way to purify it

00:07:27.778 --> 00:07:31.184
is to keep your Agnya Chakra open.

00:07:31.264 --> 00:07:34.897
When this centre is open which is the centre of Christ,

00:07:34.977 --> 00:07:42.271
which I have shown that it can only open
through the Lord's Prayer, after realization.

00:07:44.171 --> 00:07:54.865
When you open that, then you are in
that state where your attention is divine.

00:07:54.945 --> 00:08:03.220
And you'll be amazed how things work out,
even the smallest things, the material things,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:09.145
the useless things and the great
things, and the subtle and subtlest,

00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:11.745
and how you start growing.

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:21.368
So the growth is to be achieved by purifying
your attention, and to purify this attention

00:08:21.448 --> 00:08:28.665
is to keep your Agnya Chakra open
and be in thoughtless awareness.

00:08:28.745 --> 00:08:31.717
You watch something, you don't think about it.

00:08:31.798 --> 00:08:35.731
Zen said the same thing but I think
people didn't understand, you see,

00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:40.281
before realization it's like telling
about colors to a blind man.

00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:46.025
Zen said the same thing, you
watch a thing without thinking about it.

00:08:46.105 --> 00:08:51.755
They created patterns which didn't mean
anything, which you see it without thinking.

00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:55.665
But that's only possible after realization.

00:08:55.745 --> 00:09:02.504
So the thinking process
minimizes and you start witnessing.

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:11.516
The higher state than that of attention
is that you jump into nirvikalpa samadhi,

00:09:11.596 --> 00:09:16.025
into the state of doubtless awareness.

00:09:16.105 --> 00:09:21.415
Now it is not doubtlessness because
you've argued it out or anything.

00:09:21.495 --> 00:09:26.226
But is a state where you're doubtless about things.

00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:30.430
I mean the way you speak, the way
you behave, the way your attention is,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.716
you can make it out that "I'm doubtlessly there."

00:09:36.705 --> 00:09:43.691
The discrimination becomes so sharp that
you can just say, "This is so and so and so,"

00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:46.004
there's no fanaticism about it.

00:09:46.084 --> 00:09:53.427
As I told you this morning that if
a blind man cross over something

00:09:53.507 --> 00:09:57.206
and says, "Oh there's a snake
here," and he believes it's a snake,

00:09:57.286 --> 00:10:00.985
he believes that it's a snake, that's fanaticism.

00:10:01.065 --> 00:10:07.785
Because he has no eyes to see and he believes it's a
snake, he says, "Oh, there is a snake here, I believe!"

00:10:07.865 --> 00:10:12.785
But a person who has eyes sees,
"No it's a rope, it's just a rope."

00:10:12.865 --> 00:10:15.665
And he says, "No, it's not, it's a rope."

00:10:15.745 --> 00:10:19.273
But he has eyes and when he says with his eyes,

00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:22.208
which can see that, that it's a rope,

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:27.585
he means it, the truth - then he's not a fanatic.

00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:29.816
But he's standing on the truth.

00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:34.097
This subtle difference people don't understand.

00:10:34.177 --> 00:10:41.385
Fanaticism comes through blindness

00:10:41.465 --> 00:10:46.985
and the truth comes through realization.

00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:52.180
And at any cost you'll not give up the truth, any cost.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:11:01.020
Then the third thing happens; is
the joy: that you are in joy all the time.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:12.340
You cannot keep serious for more than
two minutes; it's very difficult to keep serious.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.891
The sense of humor is so
beautiful, you never use vulgarity

00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:25.120
or hurting things or personal remarks,
but the whole thing is so beautiful.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:35.500
When you speak, people feel the
flowers throwing their fragrance at you.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:41.141
Every action that you do creates joy, ripple of joy.

00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:50.541
Every movement you do, every
vision you see, gives you joy.

00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:56.220
That time you feel perfected.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:04.060
When you see a picture which is beautiful,
immediately you go into thoughtless awareness,

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:11.260
and the complete joy of that creation
starts dropping on you, you just feel the joy.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:17.397
Then you become silent, you don't speak much,

00:12:17.477 --> 00:12:23.853
you don't think, you become the joy,

00:12:23.933 --> 00:12:25.973
ananda.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:35.180
That's the perfect state in which you should be.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:42.259
It's so beautiful that you
want to be there all the time.

00:12:43.676 --> 00:12:55.985
This joy is the movement of your ocean of love.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:06.651
Is the beautiful movement of the clouds that you see.

00:13:10.014 --> 00:13:15.762
It's fantastic, you just get drenched into it

00:13:15.842 --> 00:13:19.816
and you do everything for
love's sake and you don't think

00:13:19.896 --> 00:13:23.501
you're doing it for love's
sake, you do not feel that way,

00:13:23.581 --> 00:13:29.045
you just do it because it's so
joy-giving, that it is the greatest thing.

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:34.282
You may have anything in the world,
(it) will not be that much joy-giving

00:13:34.362 --> 00:13:38.460
as this joy of the Spirit which you become.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.820
You never feel lonely, you are never bored.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:50.660
Whether you are alone or with anyone, you are in joy.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.544
One should understand that
if you get your Self-realization

00:13:55.624 --> 00:14:00.784
or if somebody says that they are
giving you to some positive lines,

00:14:00.864 --> 00:14:05.500
you should know, "Are you peaceful within you?

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.620
Are you joy?"

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:17.700
Forget about the collective
consciousness, is your health all right?

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.660
That's the minimum of minimum.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.680
The whole system changes.

00:14:27.619 --> 00:14:32.940
I just say that all of you
should achieve that state of joy

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.749
by the time I come here next year.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:44.110
And I hope you grow into it,
by taking up a stand on the truth.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:49.053
Grow into it. You progress into it.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:58.900
It's so wonderful and so beautiful and
that's what your Father wants you to have.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.760
He's the most generous Father;

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.400
He can't enjoy His kingdom unless
and until He has given it to you,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.821
that He has made you sit on His throne.

00:15:09.901 --> 00:15:18.039
That's the greatest joy that He wants to
have and that's what you should achieve,

00:15:18.119 --> 00:15:24.147
that's what you should have, that's your right to have.

00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:35.020
This is what is Self-realization
- you become just the master.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:40.362
You don't have to consult anyone, you know it.

00:15:41.552 --> 00:15:47.336
You have to just consult your Spirit
through your vibratory awareness,

00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:49.716
and you know it.
