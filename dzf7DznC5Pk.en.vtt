00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:17.043
So, the time has come to say farewell to all
of you.

00:00:20.523 --> 00:00:25.283
I must say this time our Tour has been really
very successful.

00:00:25.283 --> 00:00:31.403
There have been no obstructions no problems
nothing, except for one stupid article, we

00:00:31.403 --> 00:00:36.903
had no problem and which they are going to
look after.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:43.873
On the whole, we have learnt a lot this time
and I think everybody has been feeling very

00:00:43.873 --> 00:00:46.783
much better because of Shivratri Puja.

00:00:46.783 --> 00:00:51.223
I’ve got reports from other countries that
they said Mother: ‘What did You do this

00:00:51.223 --> 00:00:58.123
time on Shivratri that we all felt so much
higher and better’.

00:00:58.123 --> 00:01:12.223
Now the, few things I have to tell you that,
luckily you have a very good National leader

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:20.524
here, who has brought you all round very wise
person, and he is a very gentle as well as

00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:40.073
very sensible person, and who has done, such
a good work that really I must say it’s

00:01:40.073 --> 00:01:55.193
very remarkable, and now I have decided to
separate his work with National.

00:01:55.193 --> 00:01:58.622
See we Indians feel very hot anywhere.

00:01:58.622 --> 00:02:07.793
We have too much of sun within us I think.

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:19.913
So, there, one has to be thankful for that,
that you have such a nice leader here.

00:02:19.913 --> 00:02:26.253
Now I have to tell all the people specially
from Melbourne, that you should not take things

00:02:26.253 --> 00:02:34.133
into your hands, and start another sort of
an organization, arbitrarily doing something

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:39.063
under some lady like that Trish.

00:02:39.063 --> 00:02:44.433
If you have any problems you can always write
to Me I’ve told so many times, but Australians

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:47.513
don’t write to Me is My main complaint about
them.

00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:49.303
And they should not start anything.

00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:54.863
I’m surprised that there are so many Indian
girls in Melbourne and they also did not understand

00:02:54.863 --> 00:02:56.283
that they have to write to Me.

00:02:56.283 --> 00:03:05.203
So, once you are caught up you get lost, you
get vibrations in a very funny way so much

00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:09.563
so that I can’t even really treat them in
this short time.

00:03:09.563 --> 00:03:10.563
So there is a list of people.

00:03:10.563 --> 00:03:11.563
Can you bring the list?

00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:16.083
I’ve made the list now, please write it
down.

00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:20.063
Is there anybody from Melbourne here?

00:03:20.063 --> 00:03:21.622
Yes.

00:03:21.622 --> 00:03:31.852
Go and tell them, that you have to get all
these people every day, to sit down, Sunday

00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:35.732
morning maybe, and see what sort of vibrations
you have.

00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:47.802
You can see it on the candle, there’s not
to go anywhere, just on the candle you can

00:03:47.802 --> 00:03:55.873
understand, what’s wrong with you, and,
you are getting caught up.

00:03:55.873 --> 00:04:01.173
I’m surprised that you are supposed to be
Sahaja Yogi how could you not feel the vibrations

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:03.713
of this woman Trish.

00:04:03.713 --> 00:04:09.482
It took Me not even a second to know that
she is a bhoot.

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:14.252
But there’s a fraternity I think, that’s
why such nice Sahaj Yogis beautiful Sahaj

00:04:14.252 --> 00:04:17.403
Yogis, got involved into it.

00:04:17.403 --> 00:04:22.002
So this is a very serious thing and I hope
this doesn’t happen next time.

00:04:22.002 --> 00:04:23.002
Now the list is like this.

00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:24.002
I made the list.

00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:25.063
Can somebody read it for Me.

00:04:25.063 --> 00:04:26.063
Please, take it.

00:04:26.063 --> 00:04:34.743
It’s a serious thing, otherwise you’ll
be lost, I’m telling you.

00:04:34.743 --> 00:04:41.052
Leader: Michael Davies, Jackie Hodge, Peter
Hodge,

00:04:41.052 --> 00:04:44.123
Shri Mataji: Go slowly.

00:04:44.123 --> 00:04:49.733
Leader: Mother shall we give them a photocopy
of this?

00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:56.582
Shri Mataji: Still you read it.

00:04:56.582 --> 00:05:11.782
Leader: John Poulianakis, Fred Millar, Ian
Lowry, Greg Bradshaw, Lyndon DeValle, Philip

00:05:11.782 --> 00:05:38.523
Noone, Martin Purcell, Colin Berry, Jeff Platford,
Bruno Archello, Glen Pulolovich, Ben Flora,

00:05:38.523 --> 00:05:48.243
Savita Noone, Cheryl Bradshaw and Helen Platford.

00:05:48.243 --> 00:05:54.593
Shri Mataji: They are all first class Sahaj
Yogis I tell you, all of them.

00:05:54.593 --> 00:06:02.562
And it’s really beyond Me, even when he’s
reading the thing I’m getting on the left,

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:04.433
you just see, you’ll feel it, terrible.

00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:05.433
Getting the pain here.

00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:06.433
Now how are they going to be all right?

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:11.482
I’m worried about them.

00:06:11.482 --> 00:06:17.593
Now also in Melbourne, I thought I’m sending
a very very good sensible leader.

00:06:17.593 --> 00:06:27.062
But I don’t know why people, got after him,
and formed a group outside.

00:06:27.062 --> 00:06:35.232
If I am sending somebody, I should know that
I know what I am doing.

00:06:35.232 --> 00:06:42.463
So you become anti Me or what?

00:06:42.463 --> 00:06:52.042
So please all those people, who have got,
these problems, work it out every night, every

00:06:52.042 --> 00:06:59.252
morning on the three candle treatment, and
you can go in the garden, sit down there,

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.713
also say Ganesha’s mantras.

00:07:00.713 --> 00:07:05.922
It will take some time for you to be all right,
I can tell you.

00:07:05.922 --> 00:07:09.352
Even taking their names you get left swadisthana,
aren’t you getting left swadisthana, the

00:07:09.352 --> 00:07:16.313
whole left.

00:07:16.313 --> 00:07:22.952
This can happen to anyone, because somebody
like that comes up and starts her own.

00:07:22.952 --> 00:07:27.982
Anything without the leader should not be
done.

00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:37.832
They went to such a limit, that they have
taken out the name out of the list of telephone

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:43.882
of these people, can you imagine.

00:07:43.882 --> 00:07:46.213
This is too arbitrary, it’s very dangerous.

00:07:46.213 --> 00:07:51.543
It should not happen anymore.

00:07:51.543 --> 00:07:57.473
People are very good at combining together
when it is some sort of a, negativity.

00:07:57.473 --> 00:08:04.663
You see if you want to hate someone, immediately,
fundamentalists will join together to hate

00:08:04.663 --> 00:08:05.953
someone.

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:16.033
Now for Adelaide I would say, Adelaide has
one problem also people are very arbitrary,

00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:23.733
they have given Me lots of trouble before,
and if they want Me to come back, now I have

00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:32.363
asked Michael Sweet, because he’s quite
good at organizing, to organize all the people

00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:33.663
in Adelaide.

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:34.663
And please support him.

00:08:34.663 --> 00:08:39.183
Now don’t get after his life now.

00:08:39.183 --> 00:08:52.333
That shows that the leaders who are unscrupulous,
who are dishonest, are more appreciated and,

00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:59.673
can dominate people, while those who are good
nice people, are to be dominated.

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:05.263
So please in Adelaide, unless and until you
have an Ashram I’m not going to come there.

00:09:05.263 --> 00:09:12.023
Get an Ashram, all of you shift to the Ashram
and work it out.

00:09:12.023 --> 00:09:17.813
If twenty-five people Sahaj Yogis cannot live
together, how do I expect the whole world

00:09:17.813 --> 00:09:21.003
to be there?

00:09:21.003 --> 00:09:28.433
Just think of our vision.

00:09:28.433 --> 00:09:34.023
Then Wollongong, another thing, the other
day we had very nice people, I don’t know

00:09:34.023 --> 00:09:38.503
how Sahaj Yogis are working out Wollongong.

00:09:38.503 --> 00:09:46.453
They have to have, a proper Ashram, no individual
houses.

00:09:46.453 --> 00:09:47.453
Same in Newcastle.

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:50.603
You all can have a big house.

00:09:50.603 --> 00:09:56.083
Now these are the best days when you can take
a house on rent.

00:09:56.083 --> 00:10:03.133
It’s such a God sent thing now for us, that
you can really get a house for a such a cheap

00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:04.803
price.

00:10:04.803 --> 00:10:14.273
Take a big house outside, outside the city
somewhere, not in the city, and sit down with

00:10:14.273 --> 00:10:15.593
your meditation.

00:10:15.593 --> 00:10:24.123
I hope you must have realized, that a very
great work, we are doing in Sahaj Yoga, the

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:32.273
greatest of greatest, and you are all part
and parcel, of that work.

00:10:32.273 --> 00:10:41.413
So please try, to find out methods by which
you all could be closer, and understanding

00:10:41.413 --> 00:10:45.703
each other, loving each other.

00:10:45.703 --> 00:10:51.313
Also beware of Indian girls, in this respect,
they have a tendency, that’s what everybody’s

00:10:51.313 --> 00:10:55.433
informing, that they always want to separate
out and Indian boys also.

00:10:55.433 --> 00:10:57.193
Otherwise they are all right.

00:10:57.193 --> 00:11:06.063
But one of the reasons I know now why it is,
that you see the girls, or the boys, from

00:11:06.063 --> 00:11:12.633
the west have led a different type of a life
a very different culture, and we can say it’s

00:11:12.633 --> 00:11:21.483
not Sahaj, and they try to tell them, what
kind of a life they have led, and that makes,

00:11:21.483 --> 00:11:24.933
them very miserable and they develop a nausea
with that.

00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:26.543
Then they are frightened.

00:11:26.543 --> 00:11:32.513
We don’t have to discuss these things with
anyone, past is past is finished why do you

00:11:32.513 --> 00:11:36.403
want to talk of that, filth now?

00:11:36.403 --> 00:11:41.463
So, nobody has to discuss about the filth
through which they have come out.

00:11:41.463 --> 00:11:51.023
Do you mean to say that when the lotuses come
out, do they talk, or do they smell of the

00:11:51.023 --> 00:11:55.243
filth out of which they have come out.

00:11:55.243 --> 00:11:56.243
No.

00:11:56.243 --> 00:11:58.083
They spread fragrance.

00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:05.033
In the same way now you are lotuses, try to
assume your powers.

00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:10.123
Even if you put somebody on the throne and
make him king, still he is in a beggarish

00:12:10.123 --> 00:12:11.123
way.

00:12:11.123 --> 00:12:14.063
Everybody comes, he says; ‘Give me one dollar.’

00:12:14.063 --> 00:12:16.163
Then what to say?

00:12:16.163 --> 00:12:17.893
It’s the same situation.

00:12:17.893 --> 00:12:24.933
Now you are out of it, finished now, so don’t
discuss these dirty things and filthy things,

00:12:24.933 --> 00:12:27.143
that’s why these Indians are frightened.

00:12:27.143 --> 00:12:34.483
Because there is a cultural difference, and
they want to run away.

00:12:34.483 --> 00:12:37.883
So if you don’t talk about it, they’ll
be all right.

00:12:37.883 --> 00:12:38.883
Don’t discuss.

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:42.353
It’s filthy it’s dirty why to discuss
it?

00:12:42.353 --> 00:12:50.513
I’ve told hundred times when you are getting
married, not to talk about your past.

00:12:50.513 --> 00:12:54.903
There’s no confession and all that in Sahaja
Yoga, you know very well, and people write

00:12:54.903 --> 00:13:00.143
to Me and you’ll be surprised twelve pages
fourteen pages, of their confessions.

00:13:00.143 --> 00:13:03.313
‘I’m trying I’m trying’.

00:13:03.313 --> 00:13:08.703
I don’t read even one word out of it because
immediately I know the filth is there.

00:13:08.703 --> 00:13:09.883
Burn it off.

00:13:09.883 --> 00:13:14.153
So no use writing to Me also, I don’t want
to know.

00:13:14.153 --> 00:13:15.153
Finished.

00:13:15.153 --> 00:13:18.133
I don’t know what is the need for you to
write all these things.

00:13:18.133 --> 00:13:20.213
There’s no need to write.

00:13:20.213 --> 00:13:22.583
All right?

00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:27.983
After all you are My children, how you are
born, is important than from where you came

00:13:27.983 --> 00:13:30.263
is not important.

00:13:30.263 --> 00:13:32.833
You are all beautiful people.

00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:36.143
I’ve already told you what you are.

00:13:36.143 --> 00:13:41.463
Believe Me, you can check out whatever I’ve
said is true or not.

00:13:41.463 --> 00:13:45.333
Also I’ve told you as I work without taking
any money, you too work without taking any

00:13:45.333 --> 00:13:48.933
money don’t you?

00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:51.733
So please don’t discuss these things.

00:13:51.733 --> 00:13:56.653
It’s not worth discussing talking, filth.

00:13:56.653 --> 00:14:02.603
If some outsider starts tell them now we don’t
want to talk about.

00:14:02.603 --> 00:14:05.713
It’s finished now, it’s gone.

00:14:05.713 --> 00:14:10.843
That’s how things are working out now properly.

00:14:10.843 --> 00:14:18.103
You see I depend on you very much for one
reason that you are from Ganesha’s country.

00:14:18.103 --> 00:14:24.013
If you just know how to forget it, it can
be worked out.

00:14:24.013 --> 00:14:29.133
You are Shri Ganeshas in the sense, that you
are now innocent.

00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:33.343
Innocence is born within you, there’s a
fragrance of innocence.

00:14:33.343 --> 00:14:35.893
Why do you want to remember those dirty things.

00:14:35.893 --> 00:14:41.413
Now I’m telling you again, if I hear from
anyone, that anyone is discussing this, then

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:43.703
we’ll ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:43.703 --> 00:14:45.853
Because why do they want to remember the filth?

00:14:45.853 --> 00:14:50.463
Again go back to the same filth then.

00:14:50.463 --> 00:14:52.463
All right?

00:14:52.463 --> 00:14:58.283
This is not to be done again, please.

00:14:58.283 --> 00:15:02.673
So now we’ll come to another point of schooling
the children.

00:15:02.673 --> 00:15:10.583
I find that, still people are very money oriented,
as far as the school is concerned.

00:15:10.583 --> 00:15:14.623
Very money oriented.

00:15:14.623 --> 00:15:15.973
Very.

00:15:15.973 --> 00:15:23.313
Now for Indian schools we have calculated,
how much money will be needed and we have

00:15:23.313 --> 00:15:32.703
to also, spend some money for equipping that
to equip, that school.

00:15:32.703 --> 00:15:35.213
Nobody is eating money there, for heaven’s
sake.

00:15:35.213 --> 00:15:39.502
As soon as it comes to Indians immediately
we’ll say, he eats money.

00:15:39.502 --> 00:15:45.454
And when so many have eaten money in schools
here, Australians, nobody even thought they

00:15:45.454 --> 00:15:48.953
will eat money.

00:15:48.953 --> 00:15:55.963
So, try to understand, is much less the price
that you are paying here, even for preschool.

00:15:55.963 --> 00:16:03.613
While, not only it’s education, but also
food, also other amenities they have to travel

00:16:03.613 --> 00:16:04.613
and this.

00:16:04.613 --> 00:16:09.243
There is some little profit if they get will
be good idea so that we can equip them.

00:16:09.243 --> 00:16:11.753
Now we have to build a high school.

00:16:11.753 --> 00:16:14.213
Who is going to pay for the building?

00:16:14.213 --> 00:16:18.273
Is school for your children, not for Indian
children.

00:16:18.273 --> 00:16:27.422
Who is going to pay?

00:16:27.422 --> 00:16:29.543
So that is it.

00:16:29.543 --> 00:16:35.732
We have to have for, even for middle school
that is after the sixth of seventh that, what

00:16:35.732 --> 00:16:43.503
you call this sixth class you call it or fifth
class, we have to have computer.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.082
They have to learn about computer.

00:16:45.082 --> 00:16:50.363
Indian schools are not like this.

00:16:50.363 --> 00:16:53.873
They have to have a science laboratory.

00:16:53.873 --> 00:16:58.013
If you see the subjects they have to learn
you’ll be amazed.

00:16:58.013 --> 00:17:05.783
English they have to know grammar very well,
they must have proper spellings, proper handwritings.

00:17:05.783 --> 00:17:14.383
This is the minimum, I’m saying the minimum
of minimum.

00:17:14.383 --> 00:17:20.582
My grandson was studying in a school, it’s
a very well know school [INDIAN NAME] School

00:17:20.582 --> 00:17:23.952
and they were paying much more there it’s
a very famous…

00:17:23.952 --> 00:17:29.442
We have private schools which we call them
as public schools and they’re all, somewhere

00:17:29.442 --> 00:17:31.082
away from the cities.

00:17:31.082 --> 00:17:34.653
He was paying much more.

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:42.562
But when he joined another school in Delhi,
which is a day scholar, he had to pay seventy-five

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:48.863
thousand rupees only to enrol himself, and
every month he is paying ten thousand rupees

00:17:48.863 --> 00:17:56.962
when he is just a day scholar, in Delhi.

00:17:56.962 --> 00:18:04.633
And this school is going to be much better,
much more equipped, various things we’ll

00:18:04.633 --> 00:18:06.403
be doing.

00:18:06.403 --> 00:18:11.472
But every time I find such a money orientation
about schools.

00:18:11.472 --> 00:18:14.082
Same about preschool I’ve seen it.

00:18:14.082 --> 00:18:22.533
See we must understand that children are to
be educated by us.

00:18:22.533 --> 00:18:28.153
The first thing is you should never doubt
the teachers, no way.

00:18:28.153 --> 00:18:30.283
You must respect.

00:18:30.283 --> 00:18:33.103
This is what is lacking in your education
here.

00:18:33.103 --> 00:18:37.353
That’s why children have no respect for
anyone.

00:18:37.353 --> 00:18:41.113
I told you the story, again I’ll tell you
the same story.

00:18:41.113 --> 00:18:51.803
That my father, had a, generous habits of
educating boys from poor classes.

00:18:51.803 --> 00:18:56.743
That all we do, if we have money we just don’t
put it for ourselves and indulge into it but,

00:18:56.743 --> 00:19:02.853
we always try to help our poor relations or
poor people.

00:19:02.853 --> 00:19:05.383
So he always had four five boys studying.

00:19:05.383 --> 00:19:08.743
They stayed in our house and they looked after
them.

00:19:08.743 --> 00:19:13.332
One of them, did his matriculation then he
was doing his intermediate.

00:19:13.332 --> 00:19:17.342
He felt little obliged and he said: ‘Sir
if you allow me I would like to teach your

00:19:17.342 --> 00:19:18.342
children’.

00:19:18.342 --> 00:19:20.692
He said: ‘All right go ahead’.

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:28.493
We had two, gates to enter the house one,
which went through the, courtyard another

00:19:28.493 --> 00:19:30.663
through his office.

00:19:30.663 --> 00:19:34.162
One day I don’t know why he came through
his office and immediately my father stood

00:19:34.162 --> 00:19:35.162
up for him.

00:19:35.162 --> 00:19:40.312
Know he was extremely embarrassed you see,
he didn’t know, just thought, everybody

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:41.312
got up.

00:19:41.312 --> 00:19:43.072
Who is this gentleman has come?

00:19:43.072 --> 00:19:48.034
Then he went inside, and he told My mother
that: ‘I touch your feet but tell Sahib

00:19:48.034 --> 00:19:53.363
not to get up for me it is too much I can’t
just bear it’.

00:19:53.363 --> 00:19:57.072
My father came in and he said: ‘Why should
you be embarrassed?

00:19:57.072 --> 00:20:05.133
If I don’t respect you, then my children
won’t respect you.’

00:20:05.133 --> 00:20:11.483
You must try to be nobler people, it’s ignoble
habits, should be given up otherwise your

00:20:11.483 --> 00:20:16.452
children will be ignoble.

00:20:16.452 --> 00:20:20.292
Now whatever has to be paid to the teachers
has to be paid.

00:20:20.292 --> 00:20:25.013
Apart from that sometimes, you must in the
presence of children you must try to give

00:20:25.013 --> 00:20:28.563
them some presents or some flowers, respect
them.

00:20:28.563 --> 00:20:35.733
That’s what they do in India, and why most
of the rich people donate money.

00:20:35.733 --> 00:20:44.243
Absolutely if they have more money they donate,
money to the schools, that’s a sign of a

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.393
noble person.

00:20:45.393 --> 00:20:50.263
For a Sahaja Yogi it is important.

00:20:50.263 --> 00:20:55.143
Supposing now we have somebody who doesn’t
have money or maybe not a job, and he cannot

00:20:55.143 --> 00:20:56.143
educate.

00:20:56.143 --> 00:21:01.013
Now this is a good Sahaja Yogi who has been
in Sahaja Yoga for two three years, has been

00:21:01.013 --> 00:21:03.883
giving realizations to people but he doesn’t
have a job.

00:21:03.883 --> 00:21:10.123
It’s our duty in a way, to support his children
to be educated.

00:21:10.123 --> 00:21:13.243
See when this hand is self-supporting is all
right.

00:21:13.243 --> 00:21:17.472
I mean this is self-supporting is all right,
but in case it needs the support of this,

00:21:17.472 --> 00:21:24.753
this has to give the support.

00:21:24.753 --> 00:21:30.962
As we call scholarships or sometimes we call,
now we have got at least five or six children

00:21:30.962 --> 00:21:36.072
in our school there, who are absolutely free,
absolutely.

00:21:36.072 --> 00:21:41.503
Food, some of them I am supporting, some of
them Yogi’s supporting and some of them

00:21:41.503 --> 00:21:43.042
are absolutely free, absolutely hundred percent.

00:21:43.042 --> 00:21:46.773
Will not tell you the names.

00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:51.863
Their food their clothes everything and nobody
knows.

00:21:51.863 --> 00:21:57.312
We don’t want them to develop a feeling
[INAUDIBLE around?].

00:21:57.312 --> 00:22:03.462
So all the time, to be very calculating about
things is bad.

00:22:03.462 --> 00:22:10.552
I’ve seen a complete, manifesto typed [INAUDIBLE]
I don’t know what, about having a committee

00:22:10.552 --> 00:22:14.743
on top of this little preschool.

00:22:14.743 --> 00:22:16.143
That is not proper.

00:22:16.143 --> 00:22:22.613
It’s conditioning, everything, even if you
have to put these, balloons you’ll have

00:22:22.613 --> 00:22:24.773
a committee.

00:22:24.773 --> 00:22:31.363
This committee on top of that another committee
another.

00:22:31.363 --> 00:22:38.283
Trust, trust and trust.

00:22:38.283 --> 00:22:43.962
We have now one committee I had to do it,
is called as the finance committee all right.

00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:51.103
They are all audits, experts and accountants
and they will be here in Sydney.

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:55.672
That doesn’t mean Sydney is dominating as
someone.

00:22:55.672 --> 00:23:02.472
Some subjects have to be central, as in any
government.

00:23:02.472 --> 00:23:08.373
That you should understand, and that these
can go and see your accounts if they’re

00:23:08.373 --> 00:23:12.753
all right or not.

00:23:12.753 --> 00:23:22.523
But nobody has to dominate in Sahaja Yoga,
we have to help support and trust.

00:23:22.523 --> 00:23:28.942
Now in this preschool I find there are only
seven children of that age group who are studying.

00:23:28.942 --> 00:23:31.462
There are smaller children also.

00:23:31.462 --> 00:23:37.832
I have suggested to him that why not use this
area for the school there’s a school there.

00:23:37.832 --> 00:23:41.253
And I would like children to be in My Room
than anybody else.

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:43.623
So use this.

00:23:43.623 --> 00:23:48.613
You save money like that and children will
feel comforted.

00:23:48.613 --> 00:23:54.753
Everybody should see if they have time what
can I do for children, can I come and help

00:23:54.753 --> 00:23:55.753
you.

00:23:55.753 --> 00:23:59.722
Instead of that, how much money you spend
this that.

00:23:59.722 --> 00:24:03.842
You see there’s no income tax in Sahaja
Yoga, is there?

00:24:03.842 --> 00:24:07.402
We want to get rid of these kind of things.

00:24:07.402 --> 00:24:11.942
Everybody feels frightened and insecure, all
the time.

00:24:11.942 --> 00:24:14.103
Forget about these things.

00:24:14.103 --> 00:24:15.103
Trust.

00:24:15.103 --> 00:24:21.222
You don’t know how many thousands of dollars
I’ve lost, by trusting people.

00:24:21.222 --> 00:24:22.222
Thousands.

00:24:22.222 --> 00:24:24.812
But we have to trust.

00:24:24.812 --> 00:24:26.802
What can you do?

00:24:26.802 --> 00:24:29.783
We have to pay for our principles.

00:24:29.783 --> 00:24:37.903
The main principle is trusting and not to
ask about money where is what what is right.

00:24:37.903 --> 00:24:43.432
The second is a very bad situation here is,
because every parent can go and interfere

00:24:43.432 --> 00:24:44.432
with the teacher.

00:24:44.432 --> 00:24:47.072
Because they think they are paying for it.

00:24:47.072 --> 00:24:50.493
You’ll spoil your children completely.

00:24:50.493 --> 00:24:59.562
Should never never interfere with the teachers,
never.

00:24:59.562 --> 00:25:05.233
With the school.

00:25:05.233 --> 00:25:10.243
I mean if you don’t have money all right.

00:25:10.243 --> 00:25:15.883
Again you can have a committee, to find out
if they really don’t have money or not.

00:25:15.883 --> 00:25:20.383
But if somebody says I have no money I have
no job all right.

00:25:20.383 --> 00:25:27.682
Somebody should help them But it should not
be a kind of a police force behind these teachers,

00:25:27.682 --> 00:25:30.782
or behind the school or behind the leader.

00:25:30.782 --> 00:25:34.013
Where is the money gone where is that gone
this that?

00:25:34.013 --> 00:25:38.243
Those who worry too much of money will never
have money I tell you.

00:25:38.243 --> 00:25:46.503
Though I lose money quite a lot, but I get
double I tell you, never a problem.

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:51.312
I never have a problem of money, never never
never.

00:25:51.312 --> 00:25:53.442
One must trust.

00:25:53.442 --> 00:26:01.603
I’ll tell you one example, very nice example,
which shows how Sahaja Yoga works out things.

00:26:01.603 --> 00:26:09.143
I went down to Rome, and we wanted to start
a school in Rome.

00:26:09.143 --> 00:26:16.782
We saw the land everything is very nice, but
we had to deposit the money immediately.

00:26:16.782 --> 00:26:23.513
And Guido said: ‘Mother we need about sixteen
thousand pounds worth of liras to deposit

00:26:23.513 --> 00:26:24.513
this’.

00:26:24.513 --> 00:26:29.312
I said: ‘I don’t know if I have that money
with Me in the bank or not.

00:26:29.312 --> 00:26:31.972
I’ll have to see, but doesn’t matter’.

00:26:31.972 --> 00:26:35.672
I reached the airport and I was leaving.

00:26:35.672 --> 00:26:41.523
Suddenly, Sandra came with a packet and she
said: ‘Mother this I have saved for You’.

00:26:41.523 --> 00:26:45.452
I said: ‘What is this?’

00:26:45.452 --> 00:26:46.782
‘This is money, liras’.

00:26:46.782 --> 00:26:53.353
I said: ‘But why I don’t need I don’t
take any money why why do you give Me?’.

00:26:53.353 --> 00:26:54.942
Suddenly it struck Me.

00:26:54.942 --> 00:26:57.603
‘How much it is?

00:26:57.603 --> 00:26:58.603
What is the value?’

00:26:58.603 --> 00:27:00.233
She said: ‘Sixteen thousand pounds’.

00:27:00.233 --> 00:27:01.233
I said: ‘That’s it’.

00:27:01.233 --> 00:27:05.922
So I got that money from her.

00:27:05.922 --> 00:27:11.312
I said: ‘All right give Me give Me I’ll
take it, and give it to Guido’.

00:27:11.312 --> 00:27:14.332
I said: ‘Guido go and book your…

00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:18.832
He booked that.

00:27:18.832 --> 00:27:25.883
Then it so happened that, the whole thing
fizzled out, and he got back his money again,

00:27:25.883 --> 00:27:29.522
like a bad penny.

00:27:29.522 --> 00:27:31.763
So we were starting this Shudy Camps.

00:27:31.763 --> 00:27:33.212
I went there.

00:27:33.212 --> 00:27:36.582
Guido said: ‘Mother don’t change your
money.

00:27:36.582 --> 00:27:42.312
I have got all these liras with me.

00:27:42.312 --> 00:27:49.832
All the things that I had to buy were bathroom
fittings and all the, what you call the wc’s

00:27:49.832 --> 00:27:58.123
and all that, plus the, all the marble and
all the curtains and what not, every sort

00:27:58.123 --> 00:27:59.643
of thing.

00:27:59.643 --> 00:28:09.272
And do you know, in one day I did all that,
for such a big place like Shudy, in one day,

00:28:09.272 --> 00:28:10.272
really.

00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:12.282
It was a fast movement.

00:28:12.282 --> 00:28:17.962
And after that, I told them that you pay them
and send Me the bill what ever it is.

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:22.582
I also gave them hundred pounds more I said:
‘These curtains are very nice also get some

00:28:22.582 --> 00:28:27.003
more for Me maybe, because they’re dark
shade’.

00:28:27.003 --> 00:28:33.462
And can you imagine when the bill came it
was sixteen thousand one hundred pounds.

00:28:33.462 --> 00:28:34.462
Exactly.

00:28:34.462 --> 00:28:38.082
So I had forgotten about hundred.

00:28:38.082 --> 00:28:44.523
I said: ‘How is it sixteen thousand, what
have you done?

00:28:44.523 --> 00:28:45.772
Must be some manipulation’.

00:28:45.772 --> 00:28:49.332
They said: ‘Mother no it’s, grace of God
it has worked out’.

00:28:49.332 --> 00:28:51.532
I said: ‘Then this one hundred from where?’

00:28:51.532 --> 00:28:52.532
‘It’s Yours.

00:28:52.532 --> 00:28:53.532
You gave us.

00:28:53.532 --> 00:28:55.743
You forgot, this is Yours’.

00:28:55.743 --> 00:29:06.513
Then we bought the land and sold it for double
the price and now they have an Ashram.

00:29:06.513 --> 00:29:14.743
But where people are stingy about money, think
about money, things do not work out.

00:29:14.743 --> 00:29:19.503
And also worth knowing, when we bought these
two very big Ashrams in Rome, I don’t know

00:29:19.503 --> 00:29:25.922
if anybody has seen them, here, very big,
two Ashrams we’ve got them.

00:29:25.922 --> 00:29:29.623
That too, I told him just be on the lookout.

00:29:29.623 --> 00:29:39.212
So he said: ‘Mother there is one advertisement
for a house, nearer the main road or something’.

00:29:39.212 --> 00:29:40.763
I said: ‘Main road won’t be good’.

00:29:40.763 --> 00:29:44.813
‘No no it’s quite in the inside but it’s
away from the main city.

00:29:44.813 --> 00:29:47.233
I said: ‘Have you seen it?’

00:29:47.233 --> 00:29:48.233
‘No’.

00:29:48.233 --> 00:29:53.322
I said: ‘I have no time now, you’re telling
Me now, and I have to catch the plane’.

00:29:53.322 --> 00:29:56.952
He said: ‘Mother I had no time to tell You’.

00:29:56.952 --> 00:30:01.423
Luckily that day we heard that the plane was
cancelled because there was some trouble.

00:30:01.423 --> 00:30:04.222
I said: ‘Very good, now we have got one
day’.

00:30:04.222 --> 00:30:12.383
I said: ‘Can you talk to the owner and ask
him if he would like to show Me the place’.

00:30:12.383 --> 00:30:19.262
The owner accepted, and We went there about,
three o’clock, reached there about three.

00:30:19.262 --> 00:30:24.922
My plane was about eight, to India.

00:30:24.922 --> 00:30:32.822
So immediately I saw this, and that amount
which we had spent, I mean, for the buying

00:30:32.822 --> 00:30:36.682
of the land had doubled and we could buy both
the houses.

00:30:36.682 --> 00:30:39.462
And it’s such a big land.

00:30:39.462 --> 00:30:40.472
Immediately I said: ‘Buy it now.’

00:30:40.472 --> 00:30:45.212
We bought it and I caught My plane and went
to India.

00:30:45.212 --> 00:30:52.013
Nobody will believe that in such a short time
we got that beautiful, it’s a very very

00:30:52.013 --> 00:30:56.633
beautiful school, and also very beautiful
area.

00:30:56.633 --> 00:31:02.292
Just see it worked out.

00:31:02.292 --> 00:31:09.302
So I have a feeling that, when you start worrying
about money it slips out somehow, nothing

00:31:09.302 --> 00:31:10.873
works out.

00:31:10.873 --> 00:31:18.152
To feel the grace is to leave everything to
God, now you do it I don’t know.

00:31:18.152 --> 00:31:21.873
You’ll be amazed how things work out.

00:31:21.873 --> 00:31:26.972
It’s beautifully, it works out and you’re
amazed because that’s how you know that

00:31:26.972 --> 00:31:31.613
you have the blessings, how God has blessed
you.

00:31:31.613 --> 00:31:37.092
Money is what, is the dust of His Feet.

00:31:37.092 --> 00:31:44.253
So, I told you when I came these people Customs
troubled Me I said: ‘I don’t know what

00:31:44.253 --> 00:31:52.103
they are going to have now here in recession’.

00:31:52.103 --> 00:31:53.103
But doesn’t matter.

00:31:53.103 --> 00:31:57.163
It’s not going to affect you at all, if
you are in a witness state you can see all

00:31:57.163 --> 00:32:08.402
that, and things will work out, everybody
will have sufficient money, but don’t worry.

00:32:08.402 --> 00:32:13.162
And the more money people have, the more they
are worried about money I have seen that.

00:32:13.162 --> 00:32:18.682
Those who have less in any case they know
that they have less so what is there to worry,

00:32:18.682 --> 00:32:24.912
like Me.

00:32:24.912 --> 00:32:31.993
But about school now, we have three classes
and I’ve already talked to Stephan, let

00:32:31.993 --> 00:32:35.113
him solve the problem.

00:32:35.113 --> 00:32:45.562
If you find anything wrong, you can tell them,
but no parents should go and disturb the teachers,

00:32:45.562 --> 00:32:47.222
absolutely.

00:32:47.222 --> 00:32:52.373
You have no right to do that.

00:32:52.373 --> 00:32:58.103
Even I would say, Indian school.

00:32:58.103 --> 00:33:05.873
Nicely all the people go, stay there this,
in which school is it allowed like this?

00:33:05.873 --> 00:33:10.753
After this, all those who have to see their
children have to stay in a hotel and see them

00:33:10.753 --> 00:33:14.363
only on a particular date which is being told
that you have to see.

00:33:14.363 --> 00:33:15.562
You’ll be disturbing your children all the
time.

00:33:15.562 --> 00:33:23.793
It’s not that anybody can go anytime live
there nicely, and interfere with the working

00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:24.793
of the school.

00:33:24.793 --> 00:33:31.143
We have to bring some system into it, otherwise
your children will suffer.

00:33:31.143 --> 00:33:38.723
Even the Dharamshala school was really absolutely
there were a visitation, of all these bhootish

00:33:38.723 --> 00:33:44.423
people, they tortured the lives of these teachers
there.

00:33:44.423 --> 00:33:47.842
This is never done.

00:33:47.842 --> 00:33:52.503
So now next time, nobody is going to go there
like this.

00:33:52.503 --> 00:33:57.973
I have told him, that if they’re going to
Dharamshala then they should stay in a hostel,

00:33:57.973 --> 00:34:04.293
and the children can also stay with you, not
hostel we can call it a kind of a, inn or

00:34:04.293 --> 00:34:12.523
it is a, can call it, what is it a, it’s
not a big hotel but a kind of a inn sort of

00:34:12.523 --> 00:34:13.523
thing.

00:34:13.523 --> 00:34:18.463
You can take your children there with you,
but you should not go to the school all the

00:34:18.463 --> 00:34:23.513
time, and sit with them, because even there
they have to study.

00:34:23.513 --> 00:34:27.873
The trouble is, Indian standards are very
high.

00:34:27.873 --> 00:34:33.363
All the children, though they have holidays,
only take holidays for one month and the rest

00:34:33.363 --> 00:34:35.433
of the time they are all studying.

00:34:35.433 --> 00:34:42.363
You’ll see how your children will improve,
they don’t know even how to spell c-a-t

00:34:42.363 --> 00:34:44.543
cat.

00:34:44.543 --> 00:34:47.873
Because of the interference of the parents
children are so bad.

00:34:47.873 --> 00:34:55.074
So now if you have real love for your children
allow them to grow properly, and you’ll

00:34:55.074 --> 00:34:56.763
see how they’ll come up.

00:34:56.763 --> 00:35:01.973
Another thing they have no immunity for anything.

00:35:01.973 --> 00:35:08.443
Like if there’s any jaundice, they are the
first to get it, if there’s malaria they

00:35:08.443 --> 00:35:13.183
are the first to get it, if there’s typhoid
they are first to get it.

00:35:13.183 --> 00:35:18.483
While Indian children have that immunity,
because I have seen here also, everybody is

00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:19.483
carrying the child.

00:35:19.483 --> 00:35:23.553
Don’t touch the child all the time.

00:35:23.553 --> 00:35:31.453
Keep the child away from your body, has that,
warmth which goes to the child also.

00:35:31.453 --> 00:35:37.333
Yes sometimes you have to look after the child,
the child must know you love the child, but

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:41.533
all the time carrying the child like this,
I have seen many ladies who are in my lecture

00:35:41.533 --> 00:35:42.533
also, doing like this.

00:35:42.533 --> 00:35:45.093
Why what is the need?

00:35:45.093 --> 00:35:53.613
You make the child so much conditioned, and
the child cannot remain quiet unless you do

00:35:53.613 --> 00:35:54.973
like this.

00:35:54.973 --> 00:35:57.703
Massage the child nicely.

00:35:57.703 --> 00:35:59.243
Massaging is very good.

00:35:59.243 --> 00:36:02.623
You should massage yourselves also, but at
least the child.

00:36:02.623 --> 00:36:06.053
Let them learn how to take bath everyday.

00:36:06.053 --> 00:36:11.093
Everyday they must be cleansed, so that they
develop the habit of cleanliness.

00:36:11.093 --> 00:36:15.753
They never wash their hands, they don’t
want to wash their hands, and their hands

00:36:15.753 --> 00:36:17.093
smell, they just use paper.

00:36:17.093 --> 00:36:20.253
Whatever you tell them they’ll use paper
never wash their hands.

00:36:20.253 --> 00:36:23.313
The hands smell, mouth smells.

00:36:23.313 --> 00:36:36.723
With all your development, children have no
sense of personal cleanliness.

00:36:36.723 --> 00:36:43.203
We have to know that they’re born-realized
children, and that they have to have, a very

00:36:43.203 --> 00:36:49.063
different type of attitude towards life, as
the same way as the parents have to have,

00:36:49.063 --> 00:36:51.793
a very different attitude towards the school.

00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:58.043
It’s a very patronizing, and you should
be proud that you have such a school here.

00:36:58.043 --> 00:37:05.413
Thank God, they are not in the same mess as
you have been.

00:37:05.413 --> 00:37:08.473
It’s so much protection to them.

00:37:08.473 --> 00:37:15.473
So change your attitude entirely about the
schools, about the children, and look after

00:37:15.473 --> 00:37:18.753
them as if you are their trustees.

00:37:18.753 --> 00:37:26.523
They are in your trust and also, they should
know that you love them very much, as anybody

00:37:26.523 --> 00:37:27.963
else also loves them.

00:37:27.963 --> 00:37:30.533
They must learn how to respect.

00:37:30.533 --> 00:37:32.253
They must have good manners.

00:37:32.253 --> 00:37:37.213
This can be done when the children are here,
because they don’t know how to say namaste,

00:37:37.213 --> 00:37:41.533
they don’t want to say thank you, they don’t
want to say sorry, nothing of the kind.

00:37:41.533 --> 00:37:47.743
All the time they’ll go on asking why, why,
and the Indian teachers start looking, Indian

00:37:47.743 --> 00:37:48.893
children would not.

00:37:48.893 --> 00:37:54.053
Here they have no right to ask.

00:37:54.053 --> 00:37:58.123
They will all be brats here, I tell you all
the children who are going to all these schools

00:37:58.123 --> 00:38:00.753
whether private or to the municipal schools.

00:38:00.753 --> 00:38:06.693
But the other schools that are where there’s,
horrible schools are there here I know.

00:38:06.693 --> 00:38:10.943
Because anybody who comes from those schools,
we don’t want to admit them.

00:38:10.943 --> 00:38:14.733
We have had three of them, we sent them back.

00:38:14.733 --> 00:38:18.103
It’s cheaper all right, but we can’t admit.

00:38:18.103 --> 00:38:21.153
Three children have been sent away.

00:38:21.153 --> 00:38:27.863
If you feel that you must share your money
with your children, then see that they get

00:38:27.863 --> 00:38:31.303
proper education, proper grounding.

00:38:31.303 --> 00:38:37.863
Of course I am going to make a proper complete
sketch of how with the teachers, how to deal

00:38:37.863 --> 00:38:42.733
with the children, how to make them understand,
how to put them into proper way.

00:38:42.733 --> 00:38:47.003
But this is a very important age from three
to five years I think.

00:38:47.003 --> 00:38:51.773
Till one year they should be with the mother
and father.

00:38:51.773 --> 00:38:59.023
But mother should not too much also all the
time, handle the child, and should look after

00:38:59.023 --> 00:39:05.743
the child, in a way as if it is in her trust,
massage the child, look after the child.

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:08.723
I’ve seen some children just go on crying.

00:39:08.723 --> 00:39:15.193
I don’t know maybe the mothers must have
been very unhappy, when they were bearing

00:39:15.193 --> 00:39:20.433
the child maybe they had a bad time, with
the mother-in-law maybe with the husband whatever

00:39:20.433 --> 00:39:22.473
it is.

00:39:22.473 --> 00:39:26.553
All the time crying.

00:39:26.553 --> 00:39:32.283
All right that can be corrected, but they
are our property and we have to look after

00:39:32.283 --> 00:39:33.283
them.

00:39:33.283 --> 00:39:37.183
But again I say that doesn’t mean, that
a mother should expect others to give bath

00:39:37.183 --> 00:39:42.243
or look after them all the time it’s not
so.

00:39:42.243 --> 00:39:46.333
So I hope you’ll use your discretion now
as far as your children are concerned.

00:39:46.333 --> 00:39:51.873
I am very much concerned about them.

00:39:51.873 --> 00:39:56.623
Now the story goes about, people start talking
like that.

00:39:56.623 --> 00:39:59.543
About the Indian school there’s lot of criticism.

00:39:59.543 --> 00:40:04.673
I would like to know how much you have paid
for the school, to build.

00:40:04.673 --> 00:40:10.873
It’s only your children studying there,
nobody else’s.

00:40:10.873 --> 00:40:14.063
How much money did you pay to buy the land?

00:40:14.063 --> 00:40:15.673
Nobody enquired.

00:40:15.673 --> 00:40:18.313
How much it has cost to build this school?

00:40:18.313 --> 00:40:20.643
Nobody enquired.

00:40:20.643 --> 00:40:33.673
But if you are sending about, ten dollars
for their food and everything.

00:40:33.673 --> 00:40:40.653
Hundred and fifty dollars for four weeks,
where they eat their food, live there, they

00:40:40.653 --> 00:40:44.963
have all facilities, everything, plus their
education.

00:40:44.963 --> 00:40:53.003
But that will be very much discussed.

00:40:53.003 --> 00:41:02.883
You have to know that it’s a very big headache
to teach the western children in India because

00:41:02.883 --> 00:41:13.503
every money has to be accounted for our FERanies
Foreign Exchange Regulations, and every six

00:41:13.503 --> 00:41:23.373
months we have to give the report, to the
Reserve Bank of India, how we are spending

00:41:23.373 --> 00:41:26.763
this foreign exchange.

00:41:26.763 --> 00:41:37.973
And they are experts.

00:41:37.973 --> 00:41:43.343
Despite all that, the people loose-tonguers
are saying: ‘Somebody is eating the money

00:41:43.343 --> 00:41:44.523
there’.

00:41:44.523 --> 00:41:53.923
It’s very difficult, you don’t know, to
manage the western children in India, first

00:41:53.923 --> 00:42:05.483
of all as they are, and then secondly, that
the government is on top of our head, they’re

00:42:05.483 --> 00:42:06.973
sitting.

00:42:06.973 --> 00:42:11.913
Then third is about food.

00:42:11.913 --> 00:42:15.753
Your children are used to tinned foods.

00:42:15.753 --> 00:42:19.573
Like they’ll say we want baked beans in
the morning.

00:42:20.963 --> 00:42:25.513
We want this, we want that, every child wants
something else.

00:42:25.962 --> 00:42:29.615
Now the people will go crazy cooking for all
of them separately.

00:42:29.842 --> 00:42:33.615
You have agreed to such a thing, all right
you want this habit.

00:42:33.862 --> 00:42:38.535
You should not compromise: ‘No, better eat
this’.

00:42:38.081 --> 00:42:40.660
He won’t eat today, he’ll eat tomorrow.

00:42:40.681 --> 00:42:44.840
Whatever is cooked for everybody in the family
please have it.

00:42:45.441 --> 00:42:50.230
And these tinned fruits I am absolutely against
it and I am sure you also don’t want them

00:42:50.281 --> 00:42:51.911
to have tinned fruits.

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:58.941
They want to have, fried fish and baked beans
and potato chips.

00:42:59.186 --> 00:43:02.356
That’s all they know about food nothing
more, or less.

00:43:05.388 --> 00:43:14.244
So don’t send them any tinned fruits, foods,
tinned fruits.

00:43:14.248 --> 00:43:18.618
I think you better not send them any food,
is a better idea.

00:43:19.342 --> 00:43:23.188
Because if you send them chocolates, their
liver will be spoiled.

00:43:24.261 --> 00:43:30.151
They are getting everything there, so please
if you have to give you can give them clothes

00:43:30.158 --> 00:43:32.931
or anything, but not something to eat.

00:43:33.318 --> 00:43:36.518
Somebody brought lots of chocolates.

00:43:36.581 --> 00:43:38.898
That’s how they got this, problem.

00:43:39.991 --> 00:43:46.501
Chocolates should be avoided for children
up to some age, and also ice cream, but ice

00:43:46.532 --> 00:43:49.841
cream still is not so much fat, but chocolate
specially.

00:43:49.922 --> 00:43:53.022
You can have lollipops and all those things
they are perfectly all right, lollies are

00:43:53.046 --> 00:43:54.046
all right.

00:43:54.206 --> 00:43:58.502
Be careful as to what habits you give to them.

00:43:59.453 --> 00:44:02.996
And tinned food should never be given to children.

00:44:03.023 --> 00:44:04.333
It’s very bad.

00:44:05.003 --> 00:44:10.143
There’s some preservation, and for that
preservation they put some chemicals and that’s

00:44:10.183 --> 00:44:12.753
why the children are very susceptible.

00:44:12.781 --> 00:44:14.523
They have no immunity.

00:44:15.863 --> 00:44:19.091
It’s easy to get fresh things here.

00:44:19.103 --> 00:44:23.011
Not difficult specially in Australia, you
have no problem.

00:44:23.163 --> 00:44:28.953
Get them fresh things, fresh fruits, fresh
food.

00:44:28.978 --> 00:44:30.593
You should give them.

00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:34.073
If you form that habit and not from restaurants
and thing.

00:44:34.268 --> 00:44:39.428
See everything you get it in the market bring
it home, and just shove it into thing and

00:44:39.457 --> 00:44:40.457
give them.

00:44:40.487 --> 00:44:41.487
No.

00:44:41.907 --> 00:44:43.608
For children be careful.

00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:46.778
Once you spoil their stomachs it’s difficult
to make them all right.

00:44:47.656 --> 00:44:54.387
So be very very careful as to what kind of
food you are giving, even if you have to give

00:44:54.426 --> 00:44:57.576
something, then you should read what is in
it you see.

00:44:57.736 --> 00:45:01.636
If there are anything artificial things please
try to avoid.

00:45:03.082 --> 00:45:08.056
These are very precious children we have,
and we have to look after them.

00:45:08.523 --> 00:45:15.813
Again and again I would request you, to be
very kind, to Me by looking after them in

00:45:15.793 --> 00:45:20.793
a proper sensible manner, till they are with
you.

00:45:21.683 --> 00:45:25.173
Also you have to give them some discipline.

00:45:25.242 --> 00:45:26.983
It’s very important.

00:45:27.472 --> 00:45:32.452
By giving them self-esteem: ‘You are Sahaja
Yogis you are this’.

00:45:32.552 --> 00:45:36.342
If you give them, they have no self-esteem
at all.

00:45:36.602 --> 00:45:41.182
If you give them the self-esteem you’ll
be surprised they’ll start behaving very

00:45:41.222 --> 00:45:42.222
well.

00:45:42.452 --> 00:45:49.612
By saying that see: ‘You are special children,
you are Sahaj Yogis, you can’t behave like

00:45:49.639 --> 00:45:52.552
that,’ how they have to be.

00:45:57.637 --> 00:46:02.808
There has to be some discipline, otherwise
at the age of six years you cannot start,

00:46:02.792 --> 00:46:05.938
and even if you start it, it takes some time.

00:46:05.927 --> 00:46:08.532
It’s exhausting, absolutely exhausting.

00:46:08.527 --> 00:46:11.067
Some children are very exhausting.

00:46:13.487 --> 00:46:16.307
So I hope you’ll remember this.

00:46:16.457 --> 00:46:24.237
We have to be kind and nice, discreet, sweet
to them, but first we should know what is

00:46:24.241 --> 00:46:30.411
going to be helpful to them, what is benevolent
for them.

00:46:30.641 --> 00:46:36.021
And just some book comes about children, you
read it, done.

00:46:38.839 --> 00:46:42.449
In Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to read all
such books.

00:46:42.529 --> 00:46:45.039
I’m already going to write and I’ve already
told you these things.

00:46:45.059 --> 00:46:48.029
Just in a wider way, you use your discretion.

00:46:48.409 --> 00:46:52.899
After all you are all realized souls and the
spirit within you, can see in the light of

00:46:52.969 --> 00:46:55.149
that, what is good for your child.

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:58.629
But avoid tinned food as far as possible.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:05.880
Anything tinned is horrible and please don’t
take that for your children.

00:47:05.896 --> 00:47:09.720
I think you people all need not also have
tinned food what is the need?.

00:47:09.996 --> 00:47:14.786
This cancer and all that so rampant, in the
west.

00:47:14.862 --> 00:47:19.236
In India, thank God at least what ever poor
they may be they don’t eat tin food.

00:47:19.221 --> 00:47:20.656
We can’t afford.

00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:26.881
In tin food is more expensive in India than
fresh food, because tin is expensive, luckily.

00:47:32.206 --> 00:47:45.026
All right, so now this is we have done, I
have a little present for your, leader.

00:47:48.505 --> 00:47:52.611
You’re an inch short of one pen, so I borrowed
his, and he said that: ‘Mother You have

00:47:52.645 --> 00:47:54.321
already given me a pen’.

00:47:54.335 --> 00:47:55.335
I forget.

00:47:55.385 --> 00:47:58.401
I hope I have never given you a watch.

00:48:29.437 --> 00:48:32.267
I never gave you a watch so you can’t say
anything.

00:48:32.384 --> 00:48:39.244
All right this is one and today is his wife’s
birthday.

00:48:41.208 --> 00:48:45.194
So let us sing something for her, and a little
present for her.

00:49:02.918 --> 00:49:04.824
May God bless.

00:49:05.204 --> 00:49:09.034
What a nice day to be here when it’s your
birthday.

00:49:10.594 --> 00:49:12.484
May God bless.

00:49:38.863 --> 00:49:46.188
Now last but not the least, very important
thing is that the senior people in Sahaja

00:49:46.178 --> 00:49:49.208
Yoga should not be called by their names.

00:49:49.238 --> 00:49:54.248
We can say Uncle or something Uncle Tom, is
to be done.

00:49:54.278 --> 00:50:01.688
It’s very important, and even I’ve heard
some Indian girls calling somebody: ‘John’.

00:50:01.739 --> 00:50:02.739
I said: ‘What?

00:50:02.748 --> 00:50:04.339
He’s like your father.

00:50:04.388 --> 00:50:06.429
How can you call like that?’

00:50:06.468 --> 00:50:08.029
‘Our husbands insist.’

00:50:08.018 --> 00:50:15.119
No, please, call them with some sort of a
uncle and aunty.

00:50:15.128 --> 00:50:19.208
Shouldn’t say like that, it’s not proper,
doesn’t look nice.

00:50:19.366 --> 00:50:23.908
Or address to elders always: ‘Sir’ is
a better idea.

00:50:23.916 --> 00:50:26.098
Shows you have some culture.

00:50:26.371 --> 00:50:28.456
We are not brats, first of all.

00:50:28.651 --> 00:50:33.536
And also we are not people who are hippies,
you see.

00:50:33.693 --> 00:50:35.931
We have to respect the elders.

00:50:36.211 --> 00:50:41.901
Very important, it is that we have to respect
all the elders, that are within you.

00:50:41.937 --> 00:50:44.781
That’s how you will be respected also.

00:50:45.097 --> 00:50:51.477
See to it that those ladies or gentlemen who
are senior people always call them by, either

00:50:51.518 --> 00:50:55.347
‘Mr’ or ‘Uncle’ or ‘Aunt’.

00:51:07.548 --> 00:51:13.748
He was all the time with Me but I somehow
or other sneaked out tying.

00:51:24.131 --> 00:51:25.349
Ah beautiful.

00:51:25.421 --> 00:51:27.309
Suits your hand very well.

00:51:27.321 --> 00:51:36.521
It’s really very [INAUDIBLE] Very very [INAUDIBLE]
All right, so on a very happy note we should

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.520
end up now.

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:44.780
Feel very sorry that I have to leave you all
here, and there are people waiting, as you

00:51:44.786 --> 00:51:54.343
know in the eastern Asian countries for Me,
counting every minute, so I have to go.

00:51:56.506 --> 00:51:59.150
Leader: Shri Mother before you go.

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:02.426
It’s not quite over.

00:52:03.466 --> 00:52:06.226
We have a little presentation for You.

00:52:06.306 --> 00:52:07.826
Shri Mataji: Ah no.

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:10.796
You see you can’t…

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:12.826
Leader: Although it is Your…

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:15.120
Shri Mataji: It’s not My Birthday.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.750
Leader: No Shri Mataji.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.020
But as it is the month of March Shri Mother
we feel that we can celebrate Your Birthday

00:52:22.998 --> 00:52:24.480
in a small way but…

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:36.461
Shri Mataji: You have already given Me.

00:52:46.613 --> 00:52:48.627
Oh chandan.

00:52:48.772 --> 00:52:51.037
Leader: First we would like to..

00:52:51.082 --> 00:52:52.627
Shri Mataji: Oh maa.

00:52:52.652 --> 00:52:55.607
It’s the, beautiful.

00:53:38.803 --> 00:53:41.383
How can I blow so many candles.

00:53:41.873 --> 00:53:43.984
I think you’d better do it for Me.

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:46.064
Leader: It’s a map of Australia Shri Mother.

00:53:46.044 --> 00:53:47.264
Shri Mataji: Is it?

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:48.324
Ah.

00:53:49.854 --> 00:53:51.934
Leader: Including Tasmania.

00:53:53.366 --> 00:53:55.756
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.

00:53:55.806 --> 00:53:57.494
Thank you very much.

00:53:57.608 --> 00:53:58.994
So beautiful it is.

00:53:59.008 --> 00:54:00.434
So beautiful.

00:54:00.794 --> 00:54:04.384
Now come along, all the children, come along,
do for Me.

00:54:05.341 --> 00:54:06.341
This side also.

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:14.358
I’ll be entering now My seventy years of
age.

00:55:09.509 --> 00:55:10.673
This is beautiful.

00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:12.423
He will have to read it out.

00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:14.543
What’s that supposed to be?

00:55:22.114 --> 00:55:23.969
Leader: This is the card.

00:55:24.367 --> 00:55:29.439
To Our Beloved Mother, it is You Who is our
Shield.

00:55:30.127 --> 00:55:33.009
It is You Who is the Focus of our devotion.

00:55:33.971 --> 00:55:40.627
It is You who as Head of Your world wide Sahaja
Family, draws us together envelops us with

00:55:40.614 --> 00:55:42.947
love and concern for one another.

00:55:44.104 --> 00:55:50.499
Beloved Shri Mataji we your children of the
great south land, wish you a happy, gracious

00:55:50.499 --> 00:55:54.419
and triumphant beginning to your seventieth
year.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:59.549
On behalf of all your children I bow to Your
Lotus Feet.

00:56:01.269 --> 00:56:03.840
Shri Mataji: And the second part also.

00:56:03.819 --> 00:56:04.579
Very nice.

00:56:04.579 --> 00:56:06.329
Leader: A little piece on the side.

00:56:06.357 --> 00:56:09.759
We vow to You to spread Your work, to live
the precepts of Sahaj.

00:56:09.847 --> 00:56:13.869
We vow to You to live as one, a great society
of saints at large.

00:56:22.553 --> 00:56:24.844
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

00:56:25.003 --> 00:56:26.474
Beautiful, beautiful.

00:57:08.347 --> 00:57:13.147
Children, you must see what Austrians have
sent Me is beautiful things, and they wanted

00:57:13.189 --> 00:57:16.909
Me to be there for My Birthday but I don’t
know how I’ll do it.

00:57:16.989 --> 00:57:21.469
In any case you can have a look at the way
they have wished Me.

00:57:27.247 --> 00:57:29.137
Oh, this is very beautiful.

00:57:29.177 --> 00:57:30.847
Children have done it?

00:57:32.592 --> 00:57:33.592
Oh My.

00:57:55.973 --> 00:57:56.973
What’s that?

00:57:57.005 --> 00:57:59.154
Leader: I’m not sure Shri Mother.

00:57:59.215 --> 00:58:01.904
I’m trying to find my way into it.

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.331
Shri Mataji: Prohibited.

00:58:23.734 --> 00:58:25.531
So beautiful it is.

00:58:28.315 --> 00:58:30.371
It’s too much, much too much.

00:58:52.908 --> 00:59:03.058
I don’t know what to say because, pearls
are, the Adoration of the Sahasrara you know

00:59:03.108 --> 00:59:04.108
that.

00:59:05.112 --> 00:59:13.458
There are stones on different chakras of which,
every chakra is made and the pearls are for

00:59:13.482 --> 00:59:14.482
the Sahasrara.

00:59:15.272 --> 00:59:17.822
So beautiful of you to think of that.

00:59:17.939 --> 00:59:18.939
It’s very kind.

00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:22.259
Thank you.

00:59:22.339 --> 00:59:24.019
Thank you very much.

00:59:24.179 --> 00:59:30.029
Now you’ve bought it but I’m now going
to cancel also pearls from My list.

00:59:33.962 --> 00:59:37.552
Leader: And one final thing Shri Mother You
travel so much You have so many things to

00:59:37.529 --> 00:59:41.842
remember we noticed You looked at one of these
and You thought it might be useful.

00:59:42.119 --> 00:59:43.119
Shri Mataji: Ah.

00:59:45.469 --> 00:59:47.729
I’ll need somebody to operate it.

00:59:55.622 --> 00:59:56.646
Just imagine.

00:59:58.178 --> 01:00:00.146
Budget planning period.

01:00:04.183 --> 01:00:05.442
What a joke.

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:08.892
Now then this, morning meetings.

01:00:11.499 --> 01:00:14.592
As soon as You come out of Your bed it starts.

01:00:17.867 --> 01:00:20.017
Then lunch engagements.

01:00:21.687 --> 01:00:23.247
Plan next meetings.

01:00:24.077 --> 01:00:25.127
Then interviews.

01:00:25.399 --> 01:00:26.399
Finished.

01:00:26.659 --> 01:00:32.519
Leaders: Not for those Shri Mother but for
telephone numbers and, all those sort of things

01:00:32.609 --> 01:00:34.989
that You have to keep somewhere.

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:37.449
Shri Mataji: It’s quite a lot of things
I must say.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:44.090
I am very bad at, but somebody has to look
after it, because I don’t understand, how

01:00:44.081 --> 01:00:45.970
will I work it out.

01:00:54.751 --> 01:01:06.031
[HINDI] Two thousand five hundred ninety names
and numbers, and one thousand eight hundred

01:01:06.014 --> 01:01:08.491
and twenty scheduled appointments.

01:01:16.458 --> 01:01:19.853
Large forty character by eight line display.

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:22.838
What are these characters are?

01:01:23.014 --> 01:01:27.228
Leader: We have one appointment to put in
there straight away Shri Mother and that is

01:01:27.224 --> 01:01:30.264
for the early part of next year in Australia.

01:01:30.414 --> 01:01:31.880
Shri Mataji: Oh My.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:58.090
And the best part is, that built in help,
screens available, for major functions at

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.250
the touch of a button but how do you find
the button.

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:09.610
You see these buttons are so soft You just
touch anywhere, they work.

01:02:10.935 --> 01:02:15.355
All right so thank you very much I hope I’ll
learn something.

01:02:15.585 --> 01:02:17.895
Thank you very much thank you.

01:02:25.519 --> 01:02:27.627
What these are doughnuts?

01:02:27.749 --> 01:02:29.097
Yogi: Profiteroles.

01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:30.269
Profiteroles.

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:31.379
Shri Mataji: Oh.

01:02:31.459 --> 01:02:32.459
Oh My.

01:02:38.669 --> 01:02:41.949
Nobody has eaten so far I’m the only One.

01:02:45.102 --> 01:02:47.489
[INAUDIBLE] Thank you very much.

01:02:48.217 --> 01:02:55.817
I must thank you all for really making everyday
new things for Me, taking so much trouble

01:02:55.919 --> 01:02:57.727
looking after Me so well.

01:02:57.909 --> 01:03:06.179
I feel very comfortable, all the time with
My children and, I was driven around in a

01:03:06.228 --> 01:03:07.729
very comfortable car.

01:03:10.031 --> 01:03:11.452
I’ve really enjoyed.

01:03:11.731 --> 01:03:18.782
And I don’t look as if I’ve done the tour
already, I’m quite fresh.

01:03:29.396 --> 01:03:33.459
Leader: Disappeared strangely Shri Mother
none of us know quite how it came about

01:03:33.456 --> 01:03:35.719
but it’s all bits of Australia.
