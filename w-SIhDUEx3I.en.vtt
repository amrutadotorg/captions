26:57.739 --> 27:05.099
I bow to all seekers of truth.

27:05.099 --> 27:14.498
These are the special times when so many seekers
are born all over the world.

27:14.499 --> 27:24.479
We are not aware as to the nature of this
time, when we get so much worried, anxious

27:24.479 --> 27:35.159
and upset with so many things happening around
us and we do not find any answer to it.

27:35.159 --> 27:44.179
Sometimes if you read some of the books which
give all the datas about what is expected

27:44.179 --> 27:53.239
of human beings many people have now, I think,
accepted the ultimate doom and they think

27:53.239 --> 27:59.779
that after all the doom has to come so why
worry.

27:59.779 --> 28:07.529
Even Mohammad Sahib has talked about the doomsday
but much more than that he has talked about

28:07.529 --> 28:09.529
the days of resurrection.

28:09.529 --> 28:17.589
They all have talked about the future, the
day of judgement, the day of resurrection.

28:17.589 --> 28:22.179
When is this going to happen and how it is
going to happen?

28:22.179 --> 28:28.719
We have to first of all know that why are
we seekers and what are we seeking?

28:28.719 --> 28:37.598
When I said that you are the seekers of truth
we have to find out first of all what is the

28:37.599 --> 28:44.449
truth, and for that finding out we have to
just use some logic, we have to come to some

28:44.449 --> 28:48.169
logical conclusion.

28:48.169 --> 28:55.529
Now the first thing one must know that we
have become human beings from amoeba stage.

28:55.529 --> 29:00.909
We have come to this stage with a purpose,
it is not purposeless.

29:00.909 --> 29:04.329
But why have we become a human being?

29:04.329 --> 29:11.158
There must be some purpose and if this purpose
has to be served it will be served not by

29:11.158 --> 29:18.898
some sort of an outward happening but something
inward has to happen to our awareness.

29:18.899 --> 29:25.669
Like animals do not have any awareness of
cleanliness, of beauty, but human beings have.

29:25.669 --> 29:33.278
In the same way when we become a higher personality
we have to have something happening, happening

29:33.278 --> 29:36.239
again I say, to our awareness.

29:36.239 --> 29:42.388
And for this I would say Jung has done lot
of work, Jung who opposed Freud very much

29:42.388 --> 29:52.108
and he said that if man has to evolve little
higher than what he is he will achieve his

29:52.108 --> 29:59.489
own goal and according to him also the goal
of man is to become collectively conscious.

29:59.489 --> 30:07.528
So even the scientists, the psychologists
have prepared the stage for our ascent.

30:07.528 --> 30:13.878
Even Darwin who did not believe in God but
he did say that, " If man has come so far

30:13.878 --> 30:21.047
he has to go still further somewhere at his
destination."

30:21.048 --> 30:28.108
Even he would not accept a situation or a
proposition in which one has to say that there

30:28.108 --> 30:32.358
is no purpose of nature in creating human
beings.

30:32.358 --> 30:39.319
The second conclusion we have to come to very
logically, understandingly, is that the process

30:39.319 --> 30:44.088
of evolution has been done by the living force
of life.

30:44.088 --> 30:47.628
It's not done by something which is dead.

30:47.628 --> 30:52.797
Like supposing we read the book it's all dead
work or if we stand on our heads or do any

30:52.798 --> 30:55.518
such things we don't create anything.

30:55.518 --> 31:03.078
Living thing can be understood from, living
process can be understood from a living thing.

31:03.078 --> 31:08.709
Like if you have got a seed and it looks like
a dead thing but you put it in the mother

31:08.709 --> 31:14.029
earth then it starts sprouting by itself,
spontaneously.

31:14.029 --> 31:17.198
How it happens, why it happens we can't explain,
but it does.

31:17.198 --> 31:23.899
You see for yourself that it happens and that
kind of a living force has worked out your

31:23.899 --> 31:30.298
evolution without your knowledge but now in
your knowledge it has to happen.

31:30.299 --> 31:35.859
That's the only difference between the evolutionary
process so far and further, and because it

31:35.859 --> 31:42.429
has to be in your knowledge you are given
complete freedom to choose either the ascent

31:42.429 --> 31:43.739
or the descent.

31:43.739 --> 31:49.929
And when you come to this right conclusion
that it has to be done through some living

31:49.929 --> 31:57.848
process then you must understand another point
that you cannot pay for it, not a single pi.

31:57.848 --> 32:02.158
Because this is something very difficult for
human beings to understand that you can get

32:02.159 --> 32:05.408
something without paying but you are getting
something.

32:05.408 --> 32:08.579
You get the sun's rays without paying for
it.

32:08.579 --> 32:13.978
Everything, this pay business and all, this
economic activity has been started by human

32:13.979 --> 32:14.979
beings alone.

32:14.979 --> 32:20.299
It's not done by God and perhaps God never
understands money at all but is all done by

32:20.299 --> 32:25.278
human beings and also they want to bring in
God into the same pattern and say that you

32:25.278 --> 32:26.299
can sell God.

32:26.299 --> 32:30.139
You cannot organise God and you cannot sell
God.

32:30.139 --> 32:35.978
So another conclusion we have to reach that
we cannot purchase God or His Divine Power,

32:35.978 --> 32:40.269
this has to be brought to us spontaneously.

32:40.269 --> 32:49.468
Means that we cannot sort of work it out ourselves,
it's some sort of a grace or we can say a

32:49.468 --> 32:55.438
force that has to work it and when that grace
works it out we can become a higher personality

32:55.438 --> 33:01.799
as we have become higher personality so far.

33:01.799 --> 33:08.258
Now this grace about which people have talked
that there is an all-pervading power everywhere

33:08.258 --> 33:13.489
and this all-pervading power is doing every
living work.

33:13.489 --> 33:21.049
Like again I say when the living process where
we see a flower becoming a fruit, thousands

33:21.049 --> 33:24.679
and thousands flowers we see are becoming
fruits.

33:24.679 --> 33:25.679
How do they become?

33:25.679 --> 33:28.549
They become spontaneously, but how?

33:28.549 --> 33:32.649
A flower just becomes a fruit, we take it
for granted.

33:32.649 --> 33:40.918
Now the thing is, this all-pervading power
is everywhere, is everywhere, and that pervading

33:40.919 --> 33:43.878
power does this living job everywhere.

33:43.878 --> 33:53.049
Not only that it makes a flower into a fruit
but also it decides which flower has to become

33:53.049 --> 33:54.369
what fruit.

33:54.369 --> 34:04.158
It decides, it co-ordinates, it arranges,
it organises and it loves.

34:04.158 --> 34:06.448
So this power we have to feel.

34:06.448 --> 34:12.149
We never feel it, we see only nothing but
the breeze blowing but we don't see any power

34:12.149 --> 34:14.447
being existing in this atmosphere.

34:14.448 --> 34:22.468
The reason is this power is subtler for our
feelings, we cannot feel it, is the frequency

34:22.468 --> 34:25.408
of this power we cannot feel.

34:25.409 --> 34:31.378
"So how are we to feel this power?" is the
first question should come logically into

34:31.378 --> 34:32.929
our head.

34:32.929 --> 34:37.859
There must be something more must happen to
us we have to become subtler personality to

34:37.859 --> 34:40.709
feel that power.

34:40.709 --> 34:47.929
Now this becoming is the knowledge of the
roots, is not the knowledge of the tree.

34:47.929 --> 34:52.139
Whatever we have achieved through our mental
projections or all discoveries and everything

34:52.139 --> 34:58.728
we have done about nature, is we have put
them in the books and all that is nothing

34:58.728 --> 35:00.668
but the knowledge of the tree.

35:00.669 --> 35:09.538
But this tree is sustained by the roots and
these roots are sustaining this great tree

35:09.538 --> 35:15.149
which is growing, but if this tree doesn't
look after its roots a day will come that

35:15.149 --> 35:16.817
it is going to be destroyed.

35:16.818 --> 35:21.748
And that's why people are frightened that
this creation is going to be destroyed now,

35:21.748 --> 35:24.908
it's just on the verge of destruction.

35:24.908 --> 35:34.669
Even the human beings who are the epitome
of great evolution have done nothing in totality

35:34.669 --> 35:41.838
if you see the science has advanced more towards
destruction than towards construction.

35:41.838 --> 35:46.129
It has constructed few things, all right,
but in a whole way supposing you construct

35:46.129 --> 35:52.279
the whole house very beautifully, make everything
beautifully and decorate it nicely and then

35:52.279 --> 35:54.979
you put a big bomb underneath it.

35:54.979 --> 35:56.729
That's what we have done out of science.

35:56.729 --> 36:01.898
We have created all these nice things and
then we have got this hydrogen bomb, this

36:01.898 --> 36:06.629
bomb, that bomb, planted on all the sites
that if a button is pressed the whole thing

36:06.629 --> 36:10.388
can collapse whatever we have created with
such difficulty.

36:10.388 --> 36:17.008
So look at the stupidity of our endeavour,
our enterprise, the way we have worked it

36:17.008 --> 36:24.489
out that in totality we are just facing our
own destruction through our own mental projection.

36:24.489 --> 36:30.569
So the other thing that has to happen to us
in our realization is that we find out a method

36:30.569 --> 36:35.289
by which we understand the constructive side
of life.

36:35.289 --> 36:43.088
Anything done without the Spirit in it, without
God's grace in it, leads you to destruction.

36:43.088 --> 36:49.248
Even the elements can get upset with such
a society and can start destroying such societies

36:49.249 --> 36:55.859
but if the elements do not take over it is
only the same societies which are trying to

36:55.859 --> 37:01.658
elevate a society to higher level themselves
turn back upon themselves and start destroying

37:01.659 --> 37:03.849
it.

37:03.849 --> 37:10.039
Because there are no moorings for us, there
are no roots, because this kite which is flying

37:10.039 --> 37:11.958
has lost its attachments.

37:11.958 --> 37:15.059
The attachment has to be to the Spirit.

37:15.059 --> 37:20.879
Shri Krishna has said that "Yogakshema (spelling
? sounds like -- na me hum u hum) that you

37:20.879 --> 37:25.588
get your 'yoga', means 'union with the Divine'.

37:25.588 --> 37:31.599
Once you get union with the Divine then I
look after, "I look after yogashema" means,

37:31.599 --> 37:35.768
"I look after your well-being", is said by
Shri Krishna.

37:35.768 --> 37:39.689
But he doesn't say that first I will look
after yogakshema and then you get your yoga

37:39.689 --> 37:44.119
it's the other way round, you have to take
to your yoga.

37:44.119 --> 37:48.069
Now the right conclusion about yoga we should
find out what is yoga.

37:48.069 --> 37:54.018
Now many people think that doing hatha yoga,
which is just a little bit of standing on

37:54.018 --> 37:56.158
your head business, is yoga.

37:56.159 --> 37:57.159
It is not.

37:57.159 --> 37:59.969
It is very commonly said, "I am doing my yoga".

37:59.969 --> 38:03.319
I mean you can't 'do' yoga you have to be
'in' yoga.

38:03.319 --> 38:10.708
'Yoga' means 'union with the Divine' and this
happens to you, it just happens to you by

38:10.708 --> 38:16.179
which you become connected with your Spirit,
what Christ has said is the rebirth, we are

38:16.179 --> 38:17.689
to be born again.

38:17.689 --> 38:23.189
But human beings are so much deceptive to
themselves, they deceive themselves so much

38:23.189 --> 38:27.229
that I have known people that when I went
to America I told them that you have to be

38:27.229 --> 38:28.869
born again and all that.

38:28.869 --> 38:33.947
After that some of them started an organisation
called as Born Again and they just self-certified

38:33.948 --> 38:35.729
themselves that, "We are born again."

38:35.729 --> 38:40.929
But I mean how can you certify yourself as
born again when you haven't got the qualities,

38:40.929 --> 38:45.029
the capacities and the powers of a twice-born
personality?

38:45.029 --> 38:54.318
Now we have to understand also that if it
is going to be a new birth, a transformation

38:54.318 --> 38:55.948
must take place within us.

38:55.948 --> 38:58.429
We must have a transformation.

38:58.429 --> 39:03.909
But you'll find that all efforts people have
put it in of conditioning, giving puritanical

39:03.909 --> 39:10.779
ideas and doing all sorts of things it has
not been able to give people transformation.

39:10.779 --> 39:14.148
It has not led to any transformation.

39:14.148 --> 39:20.169
On the contrary, their addictions to all kinds
of habits, addiction to all kinds of thoughts

39:20.169 --> 39:25.239
and also enslavement to all sorts of conditioning
has not at all vanished.

39:25.239 --> 39:30.339
In some way or other if they are communists,
they become capitalists, if they are capitalists

39:30.339 --> 39:31.339
they become communist.

39:31.339 --> 39:37.349
You see from one to another you are going
into some sort of an ism, ism, ism, ism.

39:37.349 --> 39:43.699
But in Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like this
because you are only human beings, only human

39:43.699 --> 39:45.169
beings in the eyes of God.

39:45.169 --> 39:51.049
He has created variety he has created one
variety of say, Australians, then in Australia

39:51.049 --> 39:56.029
also he has created so many varieties as you
have so many flowers we have so many human

39:56.029 --> 39:57.029
beings.

39:57.029 --> 40:04.669
But inside every flower flows this vital force
of God's love and that vital force is to be

40:04.669 --> 40:11.479
understood through going into the roots not
from outside through your mental projection.

40:11.479 --> 40:14.708
Actually through your mental projection how
far can you go?

40:14.708 --> 40:22.419
Because it's a limited brain that you are
using to understand a problem but you have

40:22.419 --> 40:24.419
to go to the unlimited.

40:24.419 --> 40:30.859
If it is so, something has to trigger it,
your ascent, into that space where it is unlimited

40:30.859 --> 40:35.758
and that's why we have to know that through
only logical conclusion we can come up to

40:35.759 --> 40:42.018
the door but afterwards you have to enter
through this door through that triggering

40:42.018 --> 40:45.309
otherwise you cannot enter into it.

40:45.309 --> 40:51.079
Now whatever he has told you all about these
chakras you need not believe as Dr Warren

40:51.079 --> 40:52.079
has told you.

40:52.079 --> 40:56.299
There's no need to believe into it because
even if you have blind faith it's not going

40:56.299 --> 40:57.578
to help us.

40:57.578 --> 41:05.888
But as a scientist you must keep your mind
open and you must accept this as a hypothesis

41:05.888 --> 41:07.229
placed before you.

41:07.229 --> 41:13.198
Now this hypothesis if it is proved right
you have to accept it as a law, the Divine

41:13.198 --> 41:14.239
law.

41:14.239 --> 41:21.078
Now this hypothesis is that you have got all
these seven centers within you and you have

41:21.078 --> 41:27.169
got the power called as the Kundalini placed
in the triangular bone.

41:27.169 --> 41:33.279
Now one may say that this is a Sanskrit word
and Sanskrit is not for only Indians it is

41:33.279 --> 41:34.578
for all of us.

41:34.578 --> 41:38.329
As English language is for all of us, in the
same way Sanskrit is also for all of us.

41:38.329 --> 41:44.919
But only thing I would say, that as the west
was more busy, and you though you are on the

41:44.919 --> 41:50.489
east but still I call it the west, busy with
the advancement outside, there were people

41:50.489 --> 41:54.518
who were busy with the advancement down.

41:54.518 --> 42:01.668
And these people are the seers who have seen
that there is a power which is settled down

42:01.669 --> 42:04.919
in the triangular bone called as sacrum.

42:04.919 --> 42:06.369
Now this is a Greek word.

42:06.369 --> 42:10.059
It is very interesting to know that sacrum
means sacred.

42:10.059 --> 42:14.749
And I asked the Greeks when I went to Greece
I asked them, "Why do you call it sacrum?"

42:14.749 --> 42:21.019
They said that, "Most of these words have
come to us because we have had a very long

42:21.019 --> 42:24.429
rapport with the Indo-Aryan groups."

42:24.429 --> 42:26.509
"So when was that?"

42:26.509 --> 42:31.578
They said, "It was much before Alexander went
to India."

42:31.578 --> 42:36.099
So we knew about India long time back and
the Indians told us that this is a sacred

42:36.099 --> 42:37.099
bone.

42:37.099 --> 42:41.469
Even doctors know that when the whole body
burns this bone does not burn.

42:41.469 --> 42:49.498
It takes lot of temperature, very high temperature
to burn this bone and when you put it in the

42:49.498 --> 42:54.838
cremation this thing and all that, that has
to brought to a very high temperature so that

42:54.838 --> 43:02.139
this bone should burn but with other temperatures,
lower temperatures, the whole body may burn

43:02.139 --> 43:05.469
but this bone will remain still unburned.

43:05.469 --> 43:09.638
So the reason is there is this power which
is protecting it.

43:09.638 --> 43:15.559
Now this power is called as Kundalini because
it has got three and a half coils within it.

43:15.559 --> 43:19.818
You might have read some of you, being seekers,
you must have read books about Kundalini and

43:19.818 --> 43:24.398
everywhere I go people tell me that, "Mother
we have heard that this is a very dangerous

43:24.398 --> 43:30.059
thing to have the Kundalini awakened and it's
very, very wrong to touch it."

43:30.059 --> 43:33.539
Now this is something absurd.

43:33.539 --> 43:37.148
First of all this is the only way you are
going to get your realisation.

43:37.148 --> 43:42.369
Is the primule, is the germ within you, the
germinating power within you which is going

43:42.369 --> 43:48.469
to give you the ascent and how can that be
a thing that will be dangerous for you.

43:48.469 --> 43:49.929
There must be something wrong.

43:49.929 --> 43:53.679
For example, I don't understand about this
instrument or about electricity.

43:53.679 --> 43:58.818
I'll put my both the fingers in the plug and
I get a shock and I say, "Oh, it's the most

43:58.818 --> 44:03.158
dangerous thing that you can have," that means
I don't know how to handle it.

44:03.158 --> 44:08.589
But Kundalini when She is said to be troubling
people it is never the Kundalini but this

44:08.589 --> 44:15.148
first centre of innocence which gets into
annoyance and when it gets into annoyance

44:15.148 --> 44:21.948
it sends lot of heat in the body and that
heat is felt in the body by so many people.

44:21.949 --> 44:30.779
When people who have no authority from God
Almighty, we can say, those who are not holy

44:30.779 --> 44:35.849
people, those who are making money in the
name of God, those who are people with very

44:35.849 --> 44:42.129
bad characters who have no possibility of
even taking the name of God such people when

44:42.129 --> 44:47.708
they try these tricks it happens to you that
you feel that tremendous heat in the body.

44:47.709 --> 44:51.969
One must know that heat is not a sign of spirituality.

44:51.969 --> 44:58.149
Everywhere, whether is in Sanskrit or any
language, they have said that it's a cooling,

44:58.149 --> 44:59.359
it cools you down.

44:59.359 --> 45:04.059
Even a person you say, "He's cool minded",
means he's not violent.

45:04.059 --> 45:11.759
Now in science if you try to cool down the
helium gas they, you'll find that when it

45:11.759 --> 45:15.739
is not cooled down, it is heated up, all molecules
fight each other.

45:15.739 --> 45:18.859
They become so violent that they hit each
other.

45:18.859 --> 45:23.889
They form certain groups hit each other, and
then these groups also again hit each other.

45:23.889 --> 45:30.319
But when helium gas is cooled down they all
become collective and they start behaving

45:30.319 --> 45:32.989
in a manner that is very collective.

45:32.989 --> 45:39.969
So the idea is people who say that with Kundalini
you get tremendous heat, you start jumping,

45:39.969 --> 45:45.259
and people told me that they start jumping
like a frog.

45:45.259 --> 45:49.689
One gentleman sitting before me had put both
his legs on the ground he was sitting.

45:49.689 --> 45:54.679
So they said, "You can't put these feet towards
Mother".

45:54.679 --> 45:57.119
So I asked him, I called him, "What's the
problem?"

45:57.119 --> 45:59.379
You see, Indians understand how to respect
a saint.

45:59.379 --> 46:00.488
So I said, "What's the problem?

46:00.489 --> 46:02.499
Why are you putting your legs towards me?"

46:02.499 --> 46:07.239
He said, "Mother, if I sit with folded feet
I start jumping like a frog".

46:07.239 --> 46:09.629
So I said, "Are you going to become a frog
now?

46:09.629 --> 46:10.629
Just think about it!

46:10.629 --> 46:13.188
You are not going to become a frog or a bird.

46:13.189 --> 46:16.009
You are going to become a higher personality.

46:16.009 --> 46:18.869
Who has told you that you are becoming a frog?"

46:18.869 --> 46:24.389
He said, "My Kundalini is awakened by a guru
and he has given me this book and in that

46:24.389 --> 46:28.738
book it was written", (actually I saw it with
my own eyes, what a misleading thing!), "that

46:28.739 --> 46:34.879
he is a person who gets his Kundalini awakened
starts jumping like a frog."

46:34.879 --> 46:42.998
Now all these absurd things must be understood
that all abnormalities are dropped out after

46:42.999 --> 46:48.479
you become the Spirit because that's the most
beautiful thing you have.

46:48.479 --> 46:55.479
Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty and
when the Kundalini rises and pierces through

46:55.479 --> 47:03.649
your fontanelle bone area where you actually
get your baptism that time you become a beautiful

47:03.649 --> 47:12.929
person, a decent person, a sweet person, a
nice person and you forget all your violence.

47:12.929 --> 47:18.038
Not only that but you feel the love for others
and not violence.

47:18.039 --> 47:25.189
Your ego drops out, your superego drops out,
means your conditioning drops out.

47:25.189 --> 47:30.959
If these transformations don't take place
what's the serve of becoming the Spirit?

47:30.959 --> 47:33.819
So the ideas people have that you start jumping.

47:33.819 --> 47:37.889
I know of so many people now who have been
to fake gurus.

47:37.889 --> 47:42.599
And this point I must bring to you because
everywhere I went the newspaper people ask

47:42.599 --> 47:44.479
me about the fake gurus.

47:44.479 --> 47:53.639
The other day a American lady asked me in
an interview of radio at Perth that, "How

47:53.639 --> 47:59.708
do you explain that the people who are seekers,
the young people, they go to India and they

47:59.709 --> 48:06.829
end up penniless and sometimes they get epilepsy
or they take to drugs?

48:06.829 --> 48:13.339
Or they become jobless, useless, they live
like cabbages and they have nothing to contribute

48:13.339 --> 48:15.859
to the society or to themselves.

48:15.859 --> 48:18.099
How do we explain that?"

48:18.099 --> 48:20.859
She says I've got the datas to show you.

48:20.859 --> 48:22.609
I said, "I agreed".

48:22.609 --> 48:29.839
I do feel ashamed that these gurus who are
not only fake but they are criminals they

48:29.839 --> 48:32.309
go into another country to make money.

48:32.309 --> 48:33.309
I agree.

48:33.309 --> 48:34.309
I accept.

48:34.309 --> 48:39.659
But also I would blame the people who go to
them.

48:39.659 --> 48:42.329
They are naïve, simple people.

48:42.329 --> 48:47.929
They are the ones who are earnestly seeking
but you must come to some logical conclusion

48:47.929 --> 48:49.438
about everything.

48:49.439 --> 48:54.609
That is important, because you are here to
get to your Spirit and not to get to a guru.

48:54.609 --> 49:00.429
That's one thing one must know that we have
to be the Spirit and not be attached or be

49:00.429 --> 49:04.089
sort of enslaved by any guru whatsoever.

49:04.089 --> 49:07.708
The guru resides within you in your heart
and your Spirit is your heart.

49:07.709 --> 49:11.009
Only thing somebody has to trigger it just
to become that.

49:11.009 --> 49:16.609
But the amount of enslavement and all these
things people undergo for nothing at all.

49:16.609 --> 49:18.169
You cannot pay for it.

49:18.169 --> 49:23.409
Anybody who takes money from you is a parasite,
you must know, whether he may be calling himself

49:23.409 --> 49:24.768
anything, by any name.

49:24.769 --> 49:26.429
Don't listen to such a person.

49:26.429 --> 49:30.079
Now I've been telling all the people for the
last fourteen years.

49:30.079 --> 49:34.819
I was the one fourteen years back, in a very
big hall, at least five, six times bigger

49:34.819 --> 49:40.659
than this, called as Jehangi Hall in Bombay,
I spoke so loudly about all of them.

49:40.659 --> 49:44.649
I told their names I told them what they were,
how devilish they are.

49:44.649 --> 49:45.768
Keep out from them.

49:45.769 --> 49:47.449
But nobody would listen to me.

49:47.449 --> 49:50.939
Even when I went to America, in the beginning,
nobody would listen to me.

49:50.939 --> 49:52.549
I told them that, "Be careful.

49:52.549 --> 49:55.919
These fake gurus are out, they are going to
loot you.

49:55.919 --> 49:57.419
Be careful about them.!"

49:57.419 --> 50:02.159
But nobody would listen to me on this point
because they were so enamoured.

50:02.159 --> 50:05.089
On the contrary, they were teaching me some
wisdom.

50:05.089 --> 50:08.799
"Mother, you must take some money otherwise
Americans won't understand.

50:08.799 --> 50:12.109
If, unless and until they pay for it they
are not going to understand".

50:12.109 --> 50:14.079
I said, "How do you underestimate them?"

50:14.079 --> 50:15.198
They said, "It's true".

50:15.199 --> 50:20.119
And I tell you I ended up with some disciples
there or some people who got realisation,

50:20.119 --> 50:22.749
but I was so frustrated.

50:22.749 --> 50:28.619
I asked one great saint of India to go down
to New York about two years back, and he ran

50:28.619 --> 50:29.619
away.

50:29.619 --> 50:30.619
He ran away.

50:30.619 --> 50:32.718
He said, "I can't manage these Americans.

50:32.719 --> 50:37.379
Their whole thinking is just the other way
round, about God, about everything".

50:37.379 --> 50:42.319
Now there were people who were teaching that
you can approach God through sex.

50:42.319 --> 50:47.859
I mean absurd things, it's obtuse, absolutely
it is opposite of what God is.

50:47.859 --> 50:52.958
Not that in Sahaja Yoga we disregard sex,
sex is a part of life.

50:52.959 --> 50:57.689
But sex does not play any part in the ascent
you can see because the first centre here

50:57.689 --> 51:02.799
Mooladhara is for your excretion and for your
sex.

51:02.799 --> 51:09.189
So we do not in any way condemn it, but it
has its own sanctity and its own channelising.

51:09.189 --> 51:16.729
If you become sort of perverted about it you
develop diseases, there are problems and anything

51:16.729 --> 51:19.419
that is divine cannot give you a disease.

51:19.419 --> 51:24.728
So another conclusion they should have reached,
I think, that if you are sick, your head is

51:24.729 --> 51:30.039
going, reeling, if you are feeling unhappy,
sickly and you don't know what to do then

51:30.039 --> 51:31.969
why should you stick onto that guru?

51:31.969 --> 51:33.599
Because just you have paid for it?

51:33.599 --> 51:37.718
It's like if you go to a drama and it's boring,
you don't like it but you said, "Now we've

51:37.719 --> 51:39.209
paid for it so go through it".

51:39.209 --> 51:43.439
That's all right because drama doesn't make
you mad, you see, but this kind of thing which

51:43.439 --> 51:46.679
is so dangerous even if you have paid, finish
with it.

51:46.679 --> 51:50.298
Now we started that we have had enough of
this man.

51:50.299 --> 51:52.749
Now they are buying Rolls Royces, they are
buying aeroplanes.

51:52.749 --> 51:54.799
Look at where is their attention.

51:54.799 --> 51:59.729
They're more bothered about gathering money
to themselves and having other people's money

51:59.729 --> 52:04.319
as they call them opium and live on that and
thrive on that and why don't you use your

52:04.319 --> 52:07.319
brains to understand that how can you pay
for your realisation?

52:07.319 --> 52:12.349
It's one of your mistakes, I think, not to
understand that anyone who is interested in

52:12.349 --> 52:17.289
your purse is not interested in your Spirit.

52:17.289 --> 52:22.839
Then apart from that there are so many other
mistakes people have committed in pursuit

52:22.839 --> 52:24.009
of God.

52:24.009 --> 52:30.849
One has to know that when you get your Spirit
you get your own powers.

52:30.849 --> 52:35.589
I may say I'm as these people have said that,
"She's the greatest saint".

52:35.589 --> 52:36.669
All right.

52:36.669 --> 52:40.968
If they have said it I say, "All right, because
all the saints in India say so about Me, so

52:40.969 --> 52:42.539
all right, I agree".

52:42.539 --> 52:43.769
But I need not say that.

52:43.769 --> 52:47.449
Even if I say, "I'm the greatest", why should
you believe in it?

52:47.449 --> 52:48.919
What have you got?

52:48.919 --> 52:51.389
What powers have you got out of it?

52:51.389 --> 52:53.669
What have you achieved out of it is the point.

52:53.669 --> 52:58.228
Is should be absolutely clear cut to you that
unless and until you get your realisation

52:58.229 --> 53:02.579
you should not (sounds like pujout) and you
should not accept Sahaja Yoga is the ultimate.

53:02.579 --> 53:07.569
You must try to get your realisation, you
must get the mastery over it.

53:07.569 --> 53:11.669
Unless and until you have done it what's the
use of all Sahaja Yoga done to you.

53:11.669 --> 53:15.448
After all it is to transform you into a new
life.

53:15.449 --> 53:20.909
Transform you, what is your own, is all your
own property, I would say.

53:20.909 --> 53:22.248
Everything is like a trust.

53:22.249 --> 53:24.829
I sometimes say I'm like a banker.

53:24.829 --> 53:30.849
Now you put your money in the bank and I'm
just a banker who has to give your money.

53:30.849 --> 53:37.319
I'm little a very gracious banker so I may
give double, four times, five times, ten times,

53:37.319 --> 53:38.799
that's a different point.

53:38.799 --> 53:46.419
But you are seekers so you are 'men of God'
as described by another very great saint of

53:46.419 --> 53:47.738
England, William Blake.

53:47.739 --> 53:55.079
He says he has described all these things
to us very clearly that at this time men of

53:55.079 --> 54:02.799
God will be born and they will become prophets
and they will have powers to make others prophet.

54:02.799 --> 54:06.909
He has said so clear, everything is so clear-cut,
you can't imagine.

54:06.909 --> 54:11.789
If you read him you will be amazed that he
has even mentioned where the ashram for Sahaja

54:11.789 --> 54:16.799
Yoga will be, where I will be staying, into
all details he has mentioned and you must

54:16.799 --> 54:21.219
have heard the story of Jerusalem that England
will become chaste.

54:21.219 --> 54:26.479
I mean if you are (inaudible) what they have
been doing about hundred years back in India

54:26.479 --> 54:33.159
nobody could have believed the stories that
he said, but he could see that the same land

54:33.159 --> 54:41.278
which is so aggressive today will become the
land of peace, harmony and of spiritualism.

54:41.279 --> 54:46.189
Australia especially I have tremendous respect
for Australia as a land because it plays a

54:46.189 --> 54:49.509
very important role in Sahaja Yoga.

54:49.509 --> 54:55.399
This first centre is the Mooladhara, is Australia.

54:55.399 --> 55:00.549
Australia is the Mooladhara of the whole universe
and I find every Australian when I meet them

55:00.549 --> 55:04.679
there's a kind of an innocence in him which
is still showing now.

55:04.679 --> 55:08.798
Of course, innocence can never be destroyed,
it can be covered but it can never be destroyed.

55:08.799 --> 55:14.569
I have seen that in Australians there is a
kind of an innocence which shows very sweetly

55:14.569 --> 55:17.929
and that's where it works out very fast.

55:17.929 --> 55:24.298
Now Dr Warren he first came to me, and his
friend, and in the beginning they were very

55:24.299 --> 55:27.689
volatile people, extremely angry, hot tempered
and all that, you see.

55:27.689 --> 55:32.279
And they came to me when I was on my way to
Pune so I said, "All right, you come along

55:32.279 --> 55:33.499
with me, I haven't got time".

55:33.499 --> 55:38.499
I think they came to My house and they touched
their realisation but still they were so volatile

55:38.499 --> 55:39.659
and so angry.

55:39.659 --> 55:41.988
So I said, "All right, you come along with
Me to Pune".

55:41.989 --> 55:44.389
And you see in Sahaja Yoga we don't take any
money.

55:44.389 --> 55:47.958
Naturally, you see, we haven't got very good
arrangements for you.

55:47.959 --> 55:51.629
If you want you can stay in a hotel, if you
want, but as far as we are concerned whatever

55:51.629 --> 55:58.009
Sahaja Yogis had arranged in those days, so
we arranged for them to stay in a (what was

55:58.009 --> 56:04.509
that?) a, some place, all right, and there
there was a doctor from England and these

56:04.509 --> 56:08.979
two persons and there was only one mattress
for three of them, you see.

56:08.979 --> 56:10.929
There was troubling, pushing each other.

56:10.929 --> 56:16.829
In the morning, you see, they got up and they
got into the rickshaw, saying, all their luggage

56:16.829 --> 56:17.829
there.

56:17.829 --> 56:18.829
I said, "Why?"

56:18.829 --> 56:20.188
"We slept on the cement", you see.

56:20.189 --> 56:21.569
I said, "How?"

56:21.569 --> 56:24.259
"We slept on the cement", thrice+.

56:24.259 --> 56:25.259
They went on.

56:25.259 --> 56:26.259
I said, "What's the matter?"

56:26.259 --> 56:27.829
I said, "How did you sleep on the cement?

56:27.829 --> 56:29.279
They didn't give you any mattress?"

56:29.279 --> 56:30.279
"No, nothing.

56:30.279 --> 56:34.529
That fellow from England he was snatching
our mattress all the time and we could not

56:34.529 --> 56:36.689
sleep and we slept on the cement."

56:36.689 --> 56:42.599
And in that I felt the sweetness of it, how
sweetly they were telling Me their problems.

56:42.599 --> 56:47.099
It's such a simple problem to sleep on the
cement but sleeping on the cement helps a

56:47.099 --> 56:51.218
lot, (they did not know at that time), which
helps quite a lot that the Mother Earth sucks

56:51.219 --> 56:52.319
your problems.

56:52.319 --> 56:55.759
So it was all arranged perhaps that they should
be on the cement.

56:55.759 --> 57:01.689
But the way they were angry so sweetly and
everybody enjoyed that anger so much in Pune

57:01.689 --> 57:07.199
and then they got their realisation and I
knew that something good has to happen.

57:07.199 --> 57:10.889
Once an Australian gets their realisation
it will work out very fast.

57:10.889 --> 57:14.688
That's what exactly what happened in their
case and should happen everywhere.

57:14.689 --> 57:19.869
I'm very happy on my tour last time in Sydney
we did very well.

57:19.869 --> 57:26.159
And then we had also this time some program
at Perth for the first time.

57:26.159 --> 57:31.819
Many people, about three hundred people, got
realisation and it was wonderful and the whole

57:31.819 --> 57:37.979
thing worked out in such a beautiful way that
I am so much encouraged to be here to be with

57:37.979 --> 57:42.249
all of you and to do this job, because this
is the job I am here for.

57:42.249 --> 57:45.999
For this you don't have to do anything.

57:45.999 --> 57:50.089
First I have to work and then you have to
work for others.

57:50.089 --> 57:55.500
There are so many who are lost, so many who
are seekers all over the world it's not in

57:55.500 --> 57:57.519
Australia only, everywhere.

57:57.519 --> 58:02.949
They have taken to drugs out of seeking, they
have taken to these gurus also out of their

58:02.949 --> 58:06.819
seeking, all these problems have come to these
seekers.

58:06.819 --> 58:13.449
Even too, I've seen people who were quite
of my age group they told me they have been

58:13.449 --> 58:17.609
to some guru in America and who wanted to
cut their tongues.

58:17.609 --> 58:20.708
All sorts of things they have been trying.

58:20.709 --> 58:23.619
You don't have to do anything like that.

58:23.619 --> 58:28.228
You have to be quite intact but only thing
that light within you which is the Spirit

58:28.229 --> 58:30.569
has to shine into your attention.

58:30.569 --> 58:33.019
Tomorrow I'll tell you what is self realisation.

58:33.019 --> 58:37.449
Tomorrow I'll tell you exactly what is self
realisation and also I'll tell you about the

58:37.449 --> 58:38.449
chakras.

58:38.449 --> 58:42.239
In any case they have given you the books
which are of course just the beginning of

58:42.239 --> 58:47.999
the whole thing is, you can see and read it
and understand what are these chakras and

58:47.999 --> 58:49.219
what do they do.

58:49.219 --> 58:55.409
There's nothing to be afraid of, nothing to
be worried, it's your own, it has to happen

58:55.409 --> 59:00.119
spontaneously, it happens absolutely without
any trouble or torture to you.

59:00.119 --> 59:06.968
It may happen to all of you, it may happen
to some of you and whatever it is we have

59:06.969 --> 59:14.719
come here for this purpose only and I'll work
out till my last breath to see that you get

59:14.719 --> 59:15.739
what you deserve.

59:15.739 --> 59:17.531
May God bless you.
