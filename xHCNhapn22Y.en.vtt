00:06.880 --> 00:15.920
It is a great day
when Christ came on this earth.

00:16.560 --> 00:25.360
And you know about how He was
specially created to come down

00:29.120 --> 00:43.840
as a human being to work out
the salvation of the people.

00:48.080 --> 00:54.240
It is said that He came to India,
in Kashmir,

00:55.840 --> 01:00.320
and He met there
the King Shalivahana.

01:05.200 --> 01:10.880
It’s all in Sanskrit;
I’ve read that the conversation

01:10.880 --> 01:18.320
took place between Christ
and King Shalivahana,

01:18.320 --> 01:21.760
who was a great devotee
of the Mother.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.240
And he asked Him,
“What is Your name?”

01:27.520 --> 01:28.800
In Sanskrit it’s all written.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.320
So He said, “I come from a country
where people believe in filth,

01:36.880 --> 01:39.840
and I think this is My own country.”

01:41.120 --> 01:43.760
So Shalivahana said,
“You are such a great person,

01:45.440 --> 01:50.960
who has come on this earth,
so You should go back

01:50.960 --> 01:54.000
to those countries to save them

01:55.920 --> 02:04.720
and to tell them about
the pure principle of life.”

02:06.240 --> 02:08.560
In Sanskrit it was written
Nirmala Tattwa.

02:13.440 --> 02:21.840
And Christ went back, and after
three and a half years only

02:22.800 --> 02:24.000
He was crucified.

02:33.280 --> 02:40.080
These were special days,
I call them the days of tapasya.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.800
Same time Buddha and Mahavira
were born,

02:45.680 --> 02:53.280
at the same level
of the Virata’s forehead.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.080
As you know that

03:01.440 --> 03:04.960
according to Vedas,
there are seven

03:12.880 --> 03:13.760
awarenesses

03:13.760 --> 03:20.480
we can go through, or the subtle
qualities we have within ourselves.

03:22.400 --> 03:29.200
The first one was the Bhu.
Bhu is Ganesha was created.

03:31.040 --> 03:38.240
Second is Bhurvah,
meaning antariksha,

03:38.240 --> 03:40.160
means “all that is created around us.”

03:45.040 --> 03:46.160
The third one is Swaha
at Nabhi Chakra.

03:46.160 --> 03:52.720
Swaha is the one
where you consume everything.

03:54.533 --> 03:59.840
Is in modern times, you see,
people go on consuming everything.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.400
All kinds of books they will read;
they’ll go to all kinds of things,

04:04.400 --> 04:06.000
and if you tell them,
“Why do you do it?”

04:06.000 --> 04:10.320
“What’s wrong?”
“Why do you dress up like this?”

04:10.320 --> 04:17.200
“What’s wrong?” This just
consumption of everything goes on.

04:20.560 --> 04:26.320
But then at that time also
there is another great thing

04:26.320 --> 04:33.280
within us is called as Swadha,
where we sustain

04:37.600 --> 04:39.840
the dharma within us.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.320
Swadha. Dharma of everything.

04:44.480 --> 04:49.680
See, those people who say there should
be no blind faith and this and that,

04:49.680 --> 04:52.880
it’s not blind,
but it’s an inner urge.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.320
Why we love our parents?
Because there’s a dharma within us.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.640
Why do we live,
we live in our country?

05:02.640 --> 05:04.480
Because there’s a dharma within us.

05:05.360 --> 05:10.960
All these dharmas are there.
Why a wife loves her husband?

05:10.960 --> 05:13.920
Because there is dharma.
Why the husband loves the wife?

05:13.920 --> 05:15.040
Because there is dharma.

05:16.320 --> 05:20.720
When this dharma is within you -
we'll not call it religion

05:20.720 --> 05:27.240
because it can mean something else –
this one is sustained, dharaiti.

05:28.640 --> 05:34.400
Once it is sustained within ourselves,
it becomes Swadha.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.120
That’s our capacity;
that’s our quality.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.840
We can call it an innate understanding.

05:43.200 --> 05:48.800
Some of them are even in the animals,
like attachment to parents,

05:50.240 --> 05:51.840
attachment to their masters.

05:58.160 --> 06:07.040
Then comes the higher awareness
where your Manah - now it's not mind.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.600
There’s very confusion;
there’s a big confusion.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.880
Mind, you see, English language
is really quite confusing.

06:14.160 --> 06:17.280
Manah means
“by which we have emotions.”

06:19.280 --> 06:23.120
Now recently I read that they are
now talking about,

06:24.880 --> 06:29.120
not only of IQ but EQ,
means emotional coefficience.

06:30.800 --> 06:36.080
That means a person who has
only intelligence is not all right,

06:36.800 --> 06:39.440
he must also have
the balance of emotions.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.920
They are coming to it now.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.120
But first they only used to praise
people who have IQ.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.840
That’s not the situation.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.080
So now it is different,
perhaps they are realizing that

06:54.080 --> 07:00.800
through intelligence how people
have created chaos, violence,

07:01.680 --> 07:06.640
all kinds of destruction
on this earth.

07:07.760 --> 07:12.880
So now they are talking about
a higher capacity within us

07:12.880 --> 07:16.960
called as EQ,
which capacity is emotional.

07:18.800 --> 07:27.600
This emotional capacity comes to you
as an inner urge,

07:29.440 --> 07:35.520
as an inner capability
which you cannot avoid.

07:37.680 --> 07:43.840
A person may be anything in life,
but if he has no love,

07:45.280 --> 07:52.800
if he hasn’t got any emotional feelings,
then he is not complete.

07:55.440 --> 07:59.680
Now these emotional things
also could be very limited, no doubt.

08:01.520 --> 08:05.120
There could be something
that get attached to somebody,

08:05.120 --> 08:09.920
or something can happen,
as also the IQ,

08:11.200 --> 08:13.520
where we get attached to some idea.

08:15.040 --> 08:19.360
Like Hitler had some idea,
and he believed that it was the truth,

08:19.360 --> 08:20.320
and he has to do it.

08:21.520 --> 08:26.320
So when you get attached
to one idea like that,

08:26.320 --> 08:33.360
you can just do things which are
not at all helpful,

08:33.360 --> 08:39.920
supportive or nourishing to reality.

08:39.920 --> 08:48.080
All these things have happened:
wars, destruction, also,

08:48.080 --> 08:53.840
as you see nowadays, the people are
trying to secretly destroy others.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.040
All these are coming
as the anti-feeling

09:03.040 --> 09:11.440
where the Manah has developed
a domination of the intelligence,

09:14.560 --> 09:21.840
where emotions are dominated
by intelligence and rationality.

09:26.160 --> 09:31.040
So there is another awareness within us,
another capability within us,

09:31.040 --> 09:36.000
another urge within us,
innately built is the Janah.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.400
Janah means the people,
the communication.

09:41.920 --> 09:46.560
You cannot live alone;
you see a man who goes to jail,

09:48.880 --> 09:51.120
he’s quite happy,
he’s quite comfortable,

09:51.120 --> 09:55.360
he doesn’t have to do any work,
everything is done for him

09:55.360 --> 09:58.560
if he has a good class,

09:59.840 --> 10:02.480
he lives very well, much better
than he would live outside.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.560
But the only thing is,
he cannot meet other people,

10:08.640 --> 10:11.520
he cannot communicate.

10:13.200 --> 10:18.640
And when this capacity of communication
which is within us -

10:18.640 --> 10:25.920
I mean, which is a part and parcel
of human existence -

10:25.920 --> 10:27.280
is taken away,

10:27.280 --> 10:32.960
a person in the jail feels
absolutely frustrated and unhappy.

10:39.520 --> 10:45.840
He doesn’t mind laboring,
doing all kinds of menial work,

10:46.640 --> 10:52.000
as long as he’s not in the jail,

10:52.880 --> 10:55.280
cut out of the communications
with others.

10:58.720 --> 11:03.440
So this communication
is also an inner urge within us.

11:04.880 --> 11:10.560
In that also people sometimes go too far
and neglect other dharmas.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.680
They are more bothered about communication
than about other dharmas

11:15.680 --> 11:16.800
which are very important.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.000
So there is no balance in a person.

11:24.960 --> 11:34.960
Then comes the sixth awareness within us,
which is a very interesting thing.

11:36.320 --> 11:41.840
One was where we take to conditionings.

11:43.040 --> 11:49.200
Say, if I am an Indian,
then I am very proud of Indians;

11:50.400 --> 11:55.840
I can never see anything wrong with them,
or I may see everything wrong with them,

11:55.840 --> 11:56.800
it can be both ways.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.960
How you have been conditioned
is the point,

12:02.240 --> 12:09.840
and this conditioning comes to us
through our sixth center of Agnya.

12:11.040 --> 12:18.800
And the another thing that we develop
when somebody tries to condition us

12:18.800 --> 12:28.640
or to control us, we try to get out of it,
or sometimes we try to dominate.

12:30.480 --> 12:37.840
This dominating capacity is also
within us innately built.

12:39.200 --> 12:46.480
Both things are innately built within us
that we go on getting ourselves conditioned.

12:49.680 --> 12:54.560
For example I would say that
in very stupid, silly manner,

12:55.360 --> 13:00.400
people get conditioned,
is impossible to get them out of it.

13:01.600 --> 13:12.640
It always comes out of self-centeredness
that a person has no value for understanding.

13:14.720 --> 13:21.840
Like now somebody comes to your house,
he’s a vegetarian, all right.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.960
Now he stays with you.

13:24.080 --> 13:29.520
So, "I’m a vegetarian, you must get
new utensils to cook the food

13:29.520 --> 13:34.720
because I can’t have food in the utensils
where the meat is cooked.”

13:34.720 --> 13:44.240
All right. Then, “You must get
your servant in a proper manner,

13:44.240 --> 13:51.680
so send him to some place
where you can get the well water.”

13:54.000 --> 13:58.320
The servant must be absolutely drenched

13:58.320 --> 14:01.520
this is typical Indian old style -

14:01.520 --> 14:05.040
and should go and draw
the water from the well,

14:05.840 --> 14:08.960
and “bring me it for drinking and cooking,”

14:09.760 --> 14:12.240
while the servant dies of pneumonia,
doesn’t matter.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.200
All such stupid conditionings we have,

14:18.960 --> 14:22.720
but it's not only that in the East
you find all these conditionings -

14:22.720 --> 14:23.920
the West is even worse.

14:25.360 --> 14:29.840
For example, they have clubbing.

14:30.400 --> 14:39.040
Now, there are clubs where people
wear particular type of clothes;

14:39.040 --> 14:39.680
it’s a club.

14:41.840 --> 14:45.400
Now, if they wear something else
then everybody will laugh at them.

14:46.480 --> 14:51.920
Or how to use the spoon and fork
is very important in the West,

14:53.360 --> 14:54.880
how they use spoon and fork.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.720
Specially English have
this nonsensical conditioning.

14:59.520 --> 15:03.280
If somebody uses the fork and spoon
in a wrong way then, finished!

15:03.280 --> 15:06.640
He is nowhere;
he is not sophisticated.

15:09.040 --> 15:16.240
The ideas of sophistication and all that
comes through conditioning of ages,

15:18.080 --> 15:22.000
because maybe they were primitive
to begin with,

15:23.120 --> 15:25.840
they had no clothes,
proper clothes to wear,

15:26.720 --> 15:33.200
might be they were covering themselves
with some leaves or something,

15:33.840 --> 15:38.400
I mean, only hundreds of years back.

15:39.760 --> 15:43.200
So now they have jumped to the other side,

15:43.200 --> 15:52.320
very particular about their dress,
very particular about fork and spoon.

15:52.320 --> 15:56.880
And they just can’t bear
something that is different.

15:58.720 --> 16:04.320
“I don’t like that,” is very common there,
“I don’t like. I don’t like.”

16:04.320 --> 16:09.760
Now, they came to India, “We don’t like.”
“What you don’t like?”

16:11.200 --> 16:13.840
“We don’t like the way Indians dress up.”

16:13.840 --> 16:17.440
“All right, you dress up the way you like,
let Indians dress up the like they like.

16:18.640 --> 16:24.800
Now why do you think that your dress
in England will suit here in India,

16:24.800 --> 16:27.360
which is such a hot, hot, hot country?”

16:29.520 --> 16:32.320
But no, “This is how we are.”

16:32.960 --> 16:34.640
It’s quite funny the way they have,

16:35.360 --> 16:42.080
and this conditioning goes on
into such a deep manner

16:42.080 --> 16:45.960
that nobody sees the stupidity behind it.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.760
For example, if the Queen has invited you,
you must wear a tailcoat,

16:53.120 --> 16:55.600
and now it's very expensive
to have a tailcoat.

16:57.360 --> 17:00.960
Now, they have to go to a
particular shop to borrow it.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.840
Sometimes they're loose,
and sometimes they're tight.

17:05.280 --> 17:10.080
I have seen people coming to these parties,
Queen’s parties,

17:10.080 --> 17:13.680
I could never recognize them because
somebody looked like Charlie Chaplin,

17:14.960 --> 17:18.320
or somebody looked like Laurel,
or somebody like Hardy.

17:19.840 --> 17:22.320
I couldn’t make out who are these people.

17:22.320 --> 17:25.760
Then I was told,
“He's that such and such ambassador.”

17:25.760 --> 17:28.560
“Oh my God, I know him very well,
what has happened to him?”

17:29.120 --> 17:33.680
They cannot walk straight,
their gait changes because of the clothes

17:33.680 --> 17:36.720
which are so tight sometimes,
and sometimes so loose.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.280
But you have to wear.

17:40.800 --> 17:47.760
All these formal ideas come to us
as a kind of a part and parcel of you,

17:47.760 --> 17:51.360
because you accept all these conditionings.

17:52.240 --> 17:58.080
So the other side it goes to,
that we abandon all this,

17:58.080 --> 17:59.840
we don’t want all, we're anti-culture.

18:01.520 --> 18:06.320
So I met one gentleman who was wearing
a pant which had lots of holes in it.

18:06.320 --> 18:10.720
Imagine in the cold of London
to wear a pant like that.

18:11.440 --> 18:15.840
So I said, “Why do you want to wear
a pant which has holes?”

18:16.560 --> 18:18.480
He said, “This is a holy pant."

18:18.480 --> 18:25.280
“Holey? My goodness,
it will give you varicose veins,

18:25.280 --> 18:26.080
it's horrible.”

18:26.800 --> 18:33.520
“What’s wrong? We are anti-culture people
so we are taking now to holey pants.”

18:35.200 --> 18:38.960
I mean, such stupid people are not only
who are uneducated,

18:38.960 --> 18:44.720
but very well educated people,
highly-placed people, are so conditioned,

18:45.840 --> 18:51.440
and this conditioning has caused
so much damage to human beings.

18:52.400 --> 18:57.520
For example, to accept Freud had become
just a complete religion in the West.

18:59.200 --> 19:05.200
Freud became Christ at that level,
though he was a Jew.

19:06.480 --> 19:12.400
And he dominated the Western culture
so much that I just couldn’t understand

19:12.400 --> 19:15.680
the impact of this stupid man

19:15.680 --> 19:18.560
who would have been thrown in the sea
if he had come to India.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.840
But the conditioning part is:
"Everything is written is law,"

19:25.040 --> 19:27.440
and they accepted this man so much

19:28.640 --> 19:34.520
that the culture of the West became
absolutely self-destructive throughout.

19:35.920 --> 19:42.000
No respect, no morality,
nothing was lofty,

19:42.000 --> 19:51.440
all value systems shattered because
they accepted this kind of nonsense

19:51.440 --> 19:52.800
because it was written.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.800
Even today I hear,
“In such and such book, such is written;

19:56.800 --> 19:58.560
in that book
such and such thing is written.”

19:59.280 --> 20:00.720
This is terrible condition.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.640
For example, it’s written in the Bible
that Jews crucified Christ.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.440
Nonsense! Just use your brains.

20:09.440 --> 20:14.400
How can Jews crucify Christ?
They were in the multitude.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.320
In any country have you heard

20:17.120 --> 20:22.240
that a person can be crucified
with the general opinion of the people?

20:23.280 --> 20:26.000
It’s the government,
the Roman government did that.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.080
But to put the blame on the Jews
was a very good idea

20:30.080 --> 20:34.080
of a very cunning man called as Mr. Paul,

20:34.080 --> 20:38.320
and people accepted that
because it suited them to hate the Jews.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.840
Then the Jews started creating
people like Freud.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.840
So all such conditionings
also have reactions,

20:46.880 --> 20:48.800
and these conditionings then build up,

20:49.440 --> 20:52.720
and once they build up,
their reactions also build up

20:52.720 --> 21:01.840
and you have a country full of all kinds
of chaos, fear, violence and destruction.

21:05.360 --> 21:10.400
The conditioning is more also
with the idea of possession:

21:11.840 --> 21:16.000
“This is my land. This possession is mine.
That is this, that.”

21:17.600 --> 21:19.840
Like this it goes up to a point

21:19.840 --> 21:24.640
where people who believed
in the formless God

21:24.640 --> 21:26.400
also fight for the land.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.920
Why should they?
They believe in the formless God,

21:29.920 --> 21:31.920
so why should they fight for the land?

21:33.040 --> 21:34.960
But they’ll go on fighting for the land,

21:35.520 --> 21:38.880
and this fighting for the land
can go to any extent

21:40.720 --> 21:49.360
of very cruel things
that whole country can work out.

21:51.680 --> 22:01.120
Conditionings are of every kind,
if you see, are blinding your eyes.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.400
For example they believe in Koran.

22:05.360 --> 22:09.360
Simple thing is, Koran was never
written by Mohammed Sahib.

22:09.360 --> 22:14.320
He never knew how to read and write.
It’s a fact.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.440
For forty years it was not written.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.120
There was a fellow called Mua’wiya
or something like that,

22:22.720 --> 22:26.160
who killed Hazrat Ali, his sons.

22:26.160 --> 22:31.440
He was the second Calipha;
the first one died very early.

22:32.800 --> 22:37.080
Then he killed the third one also.

22:38.160 --> 22:41.920
Then he killed the fourth one,
just to become himself the Calipha,

22:43.360 --> 22:47.600
and the liver of this fourth Calipha

22:47.600 --> 22:52.080
was eaten by the mother of this horrible
fellow who hated women.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.840
So he puts it down in the Koran,
all the things against women,

22:59.040 --> 23:01.200
and people accept it
because it’s in the Koran.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.840
Somebody has made fun of Koran
and written what's wrong,

23:05.840 --> 23:07.840
and it’s so stupidities, and all that.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.120
So I asked him,
"What is the use of writing this book,

23:11.120 --> 23:11.840
what is the use?"

23:12.880 --> 23:14.480
He said he never thought of the use.

23:15.680 --> 23:18.800
“Then why did you write?
It must have some use.

23:18.800 --> 23:19.920
It’s a useless book.”

23:20.960 --> 23:23.440
I said, "It is only useful that,
by reading this,

23:24.240 --> 23:31.840
all the people who are not Muslims,
will laugh at Islam,

23:33.600 --> 23:38.560
and those who are Muslims will say,

23:38.560 --> 23:41.600
'Well, this is our book,
whatever it says we believe in it,

23:42.480 --> 23:43.760
we are conditioned like that.'

23:44.640 --> 23:48.720
So you don’t solve the problem."
So he said, “Then what should I do?”

23:48.720 --> 23:54.320
I said, "You write another book, saying
This is all stupidity I've written of Koran,

23:55.680 --> 24:00.000
because I know it was not written
by Mohammed Sahib.'

24:00.000 --> 24:02.400
Don’t write anything Mohammed Sahib,
against Him.

24:03.680 --> 24:08.400
He is the One who is the incarnation
of Dattatreya. It’s a fact.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.560
So you write that He never wrote it,
so all these people have done

24:12.560 --> 24:13.200
all these things."

24:16.000 --> 24:23.600
This conditioning can be removed
if you know what sort of life Christ led.

24:23.600 --> 24:28.320
Very important.

24:28.320 --> 24:31.840
First of all He was born in a manger.

24:33.120 --> 24:37.280
To be born in a manger
means in a poor circumstance.

24:39.360 --> 24:42.800
That means He showed
there’s no need to have money

24:43.360 --> 24:48.880
or there’s no need to have a huge,
big properties or anything

24:50.000 --> 24:52.080
to be impressive on people.

24:54.080 --> 25:01.360
Those were the days where people
respected the tapasvis,

25:01.360 --> 25:02.800
the ones who were doing tapasya.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.840
That was the time to do tapasya.

25:07.040 --> 25:13.840
So He came on this earth
and lived like a tapasvi.

25:15.520 --> 25:20.720
On the contrary, the Christians are
the most self-indulgent people

25:20.720 --> 25:21.520
you could think of.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.400
You go to any Christian nation,
you will be amazed

25:27.200 --> 25:34.160
how they are just slaves of money
and their watches.

25:36.640 --> 25:42.320
How they are living is very shocking
to see they are following Christ.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.400
“Yes, we follow Christ.”

25:45.680 --> 25:47.680
Then follow means what?

25:48.720 --> 25:51.760
He’s there and you are standing
backwards moving.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.640
Is that the following?

25:54.560 --> 25:58.080
If you see the Catholic Church,
or even Protestants,

25:59.120 --> 25:59.840
you’ll be shocked.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.080
How are they following Christ?

26:02.080 --> 26:05.520
I can’t understand,
until now I never understood,

26:06.480 --> 26:10.160
because Catholic is nothing
but money-oriented.

26:10.160 --> 26:13.600
The only thing they have picked up
from Christ that He went to a wedding

26:14.400 --> 26:22.480
and created wine out of water
and distributed.

26:23.200 --> 26:30.880
Now this wine is just
the juice of the grapes.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.720
It’s also called wine
in the Hebrew language.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.840
Thank God I have read Bible
in Hebrew translated directly.

26:39.520 --> 26:40.880
So it's called draksharas.

26:42.720 --> 26:50.320
Because instantly,
you cannot create alcohol.

26:50.320 --> 26:53.840
It has to rot, rot, rot,
and the more it rots,

26:53.840 --> 26:55.840
the more good it is, they say.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.840
They write it down, this is
twenty-five years old,

26:59.840 --> 27:01.280
so is the price is much.

27:01.280 --> 27:06.240
But if it is three hundred year old
the price is exorbitant.

27:06.240 --> 27:11.600
So it has to rot and smell like hell,
then only it’s a good alcohol.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.160
It’s a fact.

27:12.880 --> 27:17.520
How could Christ create that instant,
that moment, alcohol?

27:18.480 --> 27:20.160
But now what I find is this,

27:20.160 --> 27:25.040
that if somebody dies
they will take champagne to celebrate what?

27:25.040 --> 27:31.760
Good riddance of bad rubbish?
Or when somebody is born they will do it.

27:31.760 --> 27:36.400
But on Christmas day especially,
after coming from church,

27:36.400 --> 27:39.120
don’t go to any Christian’s house.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.800
Even the Indian Christians have started
following the Western people,

27:44.800 --> 27:47.840
because Indian Christians believe
that Christ was born in England.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.160
All such ideas have come from where?

27:55.840 --> 28:01.920
Is because the English and the Portuguese
and the French brought Christianity to us.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.120
Now, by any chance, are they Christians?

28:06.960 --> 28:09.680
What business they had to bring
Christianity to this place?

28:13.680 --> 28:16.640
They took Christianity to all the places,
specially Spanish.

28:18.080 --> 28:24.720
Spanish, Portuguese went round the whole
world to spread Christianity

28:24.720 --> 28:27.520
and today is the mess that you see
in those people.

28:28.480 --> 28:29.840
They are nothing but drunkards.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.320
Yesterday I was going back,

28:35.200 --> 28:40.400
and the sea was full of happiness and joy,

28:40.400 --> 28:43.600
and the water had reached
a very high level.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.720
It happens with Me.
But what I found,

28:46.720 --> 28:49.920
there were four, five Christians coming,
singing carols,

28:49.920 --> 28:55.920
and just completely drunk,
and I was thinking

28:55.920 --> 28:59.120
they’ll be drowned in this water
very soon.

28:59.840 --> 29:04.880
This was the great boon of Christianity
on human beings,

29:04.880 --> 29:06.960
that you can drink as much as you like.

29:11.760 --> 29:15.360
Now this drinking has come,
I should say, from where?

29:15.360 --> 29:16.240
God alone knows,

29:16.800 --> 29:20.160
but it has come also from the Christians.

29:21.920 --> 29:26.240
And the Muslims also drink, no doubt,
but they hide and drink.

29:27.440 --> 29:32.960
They don’t openly drink and don’t call
it's a religious duty that you should drink.

29:32.960 --> 29:35.440
Imagine in the church
when they give communication,

29:36.800 --> 29:40.080
they give you some sort of
a dirty smelling wine.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.040
After that,
how can you have communication?

29:43.920 --> 29:45.280
Once you are drunk you are finished.

29:47.680 --> 29:54.320
But all these things happen.
So today we are talking about Christ.

29:54.320 --> 30:04.640
He is sitting in a position of Agnya Chakra,
controlling pineal and pituitary.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.440
By that He controls our conditioning.

30:11.520 --> 30:17.120
If we follow Him then we cannot
be conditioned by anything,

30:19.520 --> 30:22.560
because He talked of Spirit only.

30:22.560 --> 30:27.280
Spirit cannot be conditioned -
conditioned by anything.

30:29.040 --> 30:35.840
Whatever is good that will be accepted,
good, congenial to the Spirit.

30:39.680 --> 30:42.880
It’s a different attitude of a person
who is spiritual.

30:45.280 --> 30:52.800
Like we had people here,
I know they are not very comfortable.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.240
Some of them are put into these tents
here and there,

30:59.600 --> 31:06.960
but they are enjoying because
they are enjoying the spiritual atmosphere.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.920
They don’t care where they sleep,
where they live, what they have.

31:13.840 --> 31:17.840
This is all because you have entered
into the Kingdom of God.

31:19.120 --> 31:24.320
But those who have not, so much worried,
“This is not good, I want this way, that way.”

31:24.880 --> 31:31.120
All material happiness they seek,
trouble everybody, criticize everybody,

31:31.120 --> 31:32.400
get angry with everybody.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.880
But actually they haven’t got spiritual joy,

31:39.040 --> 31:45.840
and they can never be really in joy
unless and until they become fully spiritual.

31:47.360 --> 31:52.240
Christ has openly said
that “You have to know yourself.”

31:53.440 --> 31:55.400
Same in Koran, Mohammed Sahib has said,

31:55.400 --> 32:00.240
“Unless and until you know yourself,
you will not know God.”

32:00.240 --> 32:05.680
There are lots of truths in Koran, I find,
left over by this Mua’wiya

32:07.040 --> 32:08.480
and also in the Bible.

32:10.080 --> 32:14.960
Also in the Jews, I find their Torah
and all that has lots of truth,

32:15.760 --> 32:21.920
but is covered by all this kind of thinking,
rationality and adjustments

32:21.920 --> 32:29.200
they have done for their own use.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.800
Actually we have to understand

32:31.680 --> 32:35.440
that Christ never started
any exclusive religion, never.

32:36.240 --> 32:36.880
None of them.

32:38.960 --> 32:42.000
Specially Mohammed Sahib has
talked about Abraham;

32:42.960 --> 32:45.520
He’s talked about Moses;

32:45.520 --> 32:50.080
He’s talked about Christ and His Mother,
much more than in the Bible,

32:50.080 --> 32:50.880
respected Her.

32:52.160 --> 32:57.200
And He said, “There have been more than
one lakh walis (means realized souls) before.”

32:59.200 --> 33:06.000
But still Muslims are some sort
of a unique people

33:06.720 --> 33:08.320
because they call themselves Muslims.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.080
Whether they drink, doesn’t matter;
whether they womanize, doesn’t matter;

33:12.880 --> 33:14.560
they kill people, doesn’t matter.

33:15.120 --> 33:19.120
They are running after few things
which are forbidden to them,

33:19.120 --> 33:21.280
but still they are Muslims.

33:21.280 --> 33:22.320
Same with the Christians.

33:23.680 --> 33:26.880
Difficult to find a man
who is a real Christian,

33:27.680 --> 33:32.240
who follows Christ,
before realization.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.920
After realization, of course,
we are different,

33:37.040 --> 33:40.240
but for that you have to cross this Agnya.

33:40.240 --> 33:46.160
Agnya also is there
which has to control your ego.

33:48.240 --> 33:51.840
Christ in His lifetime
showed how ego works.

33:52.800 --> 34:03.440
His own crucifixion itself shows how Christ,
such a great incarnation of purity,

34:04.800 --> 34:06.240
was crucified;

34:06.240 --> 34:12.240
shows what people are like,
what they did to Him,

34:15.120 --> 34:20.000
how He was troubled and tortured
by these stupid people

34:20.000 --> 34:22.960
and then how He was crucified
by the government.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.360
In the beginning there were
many Sahaja Yogis, I should say,

34:29.360 --> 34:30.760
they were called as Gnostics.

34:30.760 --> 34:36.800
"Gna” in Sanskrit means knowledge,
who had the knowledge about self.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.880
Christ has said, “Thou shalt.”
He has said that “Know thyself.”

34:46.560 --> 34:52.160
"You have to knock at the door,”
meaning you must have Shuddha Iccha,

34:52.160 --> 34:53.520
otherwise it won’t work out.

34:53.520 --> 34:58.120
Nobody can force you.
He controls the ego.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.760
He’s the One who gives you the balance,

35:06.640 --> 35:11.040
but if you go to the West you know
they are nothing but some sort

35:11.040 --> 35:15.840
of a stupid donkey-like ego.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.600
The way they talk, the way
they behave towards each other,

35:22.080 --> 35:23.280
it’s a big eye opener.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.840
They are developed.
How are they developed? God knows.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.640
Oh, they are very advanced,
sophisticated, this, that.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.000
With this Agnya catching.

35:40.160 --> 35:43.840
Christ has said in His Lord’s Prayer:

35:45.680 --> 35:51.320
“Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
them who trespass against us.”

35:51.920 --> 35:56.480
What a big thing to say,
but one thing I have seen in the West,

35:56.480 --> 35:57.840
people don’t know how to forgive.

35:59.040 --> 36:08.400
They are full of hatred
and they cannot ask forgiveness

36:08.400 --> 36:11.840
because they are full of terrible ego.

36:13.440 --> 36:16.640
Though they will feel guilty,
but they will never ask for forgiveness.

36:18.000 --> 36:23.320
They’ll never say that “Oh God,
forgive me for what I have done. ”

36:24.720 --> 36:26.160
This is so common now.

36:26.160 --> 36:30.560
For example the Nazis,
they killed so many people

36:30.560 --> 36:39.840
and still you find these Neo-Nazis
coming up, even in Italy.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.640
They are not ashamed
as to what they have done.

36:44.560 --> 36:49.680
This happens because there is
no really connection with Christ.

36:52.080 --> 36:58.720
Firstly, if you have connection with Christ,
your ego has to be finished, absolutely.

37:00.480 --> 37:08.160
And this ego which comes to you
from various sources is a myth.

37:08.160 --> 37:08.720
Is a myth.

37:10.320 --> 37:14.640
With this ego people try
to befool others and show off.

37:16.800 --> 37:20.920
Like there’s a story of Shahpesh-
I don’t know if you have read about him.

37:20.920 --> 37:25.440
He came to a king and told him that
“I’m a great architect,

37:25.440 --> 37:28.320
and I’ll build a big palace for you,
”and this and that.

37:28.320 --> 37:31.360
The way he posed, the king believed him.

37:31.360 --> 37:35.160
He said, “All right. Go ahead,
I’ll send you so much money. ”

37:35.760 --> 37:42.880
Now with this whole attitude
and the way he was describing himself,

37:42.880 --> 37:49.840
with his all his gestures full of such ego
that this king also got completely lost.

37:50.400 --> 37:56.320
He gave him lots of money.
And in six months' time he came back,

37:56.320 --> 37:59.040
said, “I’ve built your palace,
come and have a look.”

37:59.040 --> 38:03.600
So he went there,
he saw it was just the same land,

38:03.600 --> 38:05.040
there was no palace, nothing.

38:05.040 --> 38:08.000
So the king thought
something gone wrong with him or what?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.880
He was again looking and looking,
and what does he find?

38:11.600 --> 38:13.840
He finds there was no palace, nothing.

38:14.800 --> 38:18.480
Immediately he realized
that his ego has befooled him.

38:20.160 --> 38:25.800
So the king was very clever that way,
he realized it.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.960
So he started saying,
“See this is the main road

38:28.960 --> 38:31.440
by which we’ll go,
and there’s the palace.

38:31.440 --> 38:36.080
Now the door opens. ”Nothing there.
It's all just a story.

38:36.800 --> 38:40.880
“And now here is your throne,
and please be seated on it.”

38:40.880 --> 38:42.000
He said, “First you sit.”

38:44.000 --> 38:50.080
He made this Shahpesh to sit
on a throne which never existed.

38:50.800 --> 38:54.000
Now imagine, it was very painful.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.840
He said, “You see,
I want to see you sitting there, I like it.”

38:58.960 --> 39:00.480
For one hour he made him sit.

39:01.440 --> 39:06.080
For two hours he made him sit.
Ultimately Shahpesh fell at his feet

39:06.080 --> 39:06.560
and he said,

39:06.560 --> 39:13.840
“Sir, I’m sorry, there is no palace,
there is no throne, nothing of the kind,”

39:14.400 --> 39:17.920
but the king had lost all his money
so he imprisoned him,

39:18.480 --> 39:20.640
he was beaten up
and did all kinds of things.

39:21.280 --> 39:25.360
So this is the end of false ideas
about oneself.

39:26.560 --> 39:33.760
This ego can take you
to such a heights of stupidity.

39:38.240 --> 39:41.840
And the culture where it is pampered
is the worst culture.

39:44.160 --> 39:50.640
I’ve seen advertisements where they say,
"You must smoke this particular cigarette

39:50.640 --> 39:55.840
because it expresses your ego."

39:55.840 --> 40:01.280
But according to Indian culture,
to express your ego

40:01.280 --> 40:05.760
is absolutely something very stupid.

40:07.520 --> 40:11.200
People laugh at such a person,
the one who tries to show his ego.

40:13.680 --> 40:17.520
In Marathi language,
if somebody is trying to show off,

40:19.440 --> 40:23.840
then they say he is climbing
on a small, little shrub of channa.

40:27.760 --> 40:33.760
It’s the whole system is such
so nobody can develop any ego.

40:34.560 --> 40:37.280
If they develop, then they are corrected.

40:37.280 --> 40:41.920
Specially in Maharashtra,
it’s very difficult to develop any ego.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.840
As soon as you start talking big
about yourself,

40:46.480 --> 40:47.760
immediately you are punctured.

40:50.720 --> 40:55.280
But in the north, of course,
a little bit allowed I think,

40:57.280 --> 41:02.400
and people do talk big.

41:02.400 --> 41:07.920
We have great politicians who talk very big,
“I’m going to do this; I’m going to do that.

41:07.920 --> 41:12.000
We’re going to have this project,
that project, this, that.”

41:12.000 --> 41:15.280
One thing: Christ never said such a thing,
never He talked.

41:16.640 --> 41:24.400
What, if you see His sermons,
is so deep and so enlightening.

41:26.080 --> 41:34.160
Despite the effort of this gentleman
Mister Paul, you see Christ talking to people,

41:34.160 --> 41:38.480
giving them different ways of explanation:

41:40.160 --> 41:44.320
what happens after realization,
how a seed is sprouted,

41:44.320 --> 41:46.320
and how it can get spoilt.

41:46.320 --> 41:50.640
And very beautifully He explained to people.

41:52.480 --> 42:01.840
I think it didn't have much effect
at that time.

42:16.640 --> 42:20.800
His life was so charming and so beautiful.

42:24.800 --> 42:27.280
Like a shooting star,
He came on this earth,

42:29.520 --> 42:36.000
but He left such a remarkable impression
on people.

42:37.760 --> 42:44.720
His crucifixion was a part of the game
because He had to make the way

42:44.720 --> 42:46.240
in the Agnya Chakra,

42:46.240 --> 42:50.400
to cross the Agnya Chakra
He was crucified;

42:50.960 --> 42:54.640
but His message is not crucifixion.

42:56.320 --> 42:58.960
People wear the cross
and I feel very hurt about it.

42:59.760 --> 43:04.240
He crucified Himself,
but that’s not the message,

43:05.120 --> 43:09.600
that’s not you should celebrate
that He crucified.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.840
There are people who celebrate it.

43:13.440 --> 43:22.080
You have to celebrate His resurrection,
resurrection because human beings

43:22.080 --> 43:23.200
are to be resurrected.

43:24.560 --> 43:28.960
In Sahaja Yoga nobody is crucified
and is resurrected

43:28.960 --> 43:31.760
because of one crucifixion of Christ.

43:31.760 --> 43:35.040
That was enough. That was sufficient.

43:36.080 --> 43:41.520
You can’t carry the cross on your shoulder;
don’t have to.

43:41.520 --> 43:44.160
He has carried for you,
He’s done everything for you.

43:44.160 --> 43:47.440
He said also that He died
for all the sinners, is a fact.

43:48.720 --> 43:51.920
If He had not done that,
it would have been difficult

43:51.920 --> 43:53.120
to open your Agnyas,

43:53.680 --> 43:57.120
because two problems, I told you,
this conditioning and ego.

44:01.040 --> 44:11.680
His crucifixion has helped the loosening
of these two horrible capacities

44:11.680 --> 44:13.240
of human being.

44:16.240 --> 44:26.240
His life is to be understood
in a very, very deep sense.

44:30.240 --> 44:34.920
But if you are like a journalist,
you can say, “Why did He crucify Himself?

44:34.920 --> 44:38.320
If He was God why did He get crucified?”

44:41.840 --> 44:44.480
Now the question is why He got crucified,

44:44.480 --> 44:50.080
is how to tell these journalists
who don’t know anything about chakras.

44:50.080 --> 44:55.760
Because it was the era or the time
of tapasya, of sacrifice,

44:58.320 --> 45:02.640
and so then all these three persons -

45:02.640 --> 45:09.280
Buddha, Mahavira and Christ -
went into complete renunciation.

45:14.240 --> 45:18.720
They led a life of a great tapasvis.

45:19.680 --> 45:24.400
They did it for us, not for themselves.
They didn’t need it.

45:26.480 --> 45:32.720
They didn’t want it;
but they had do it to cleanse us,

45:33.680 --> 45:38.960
to give us a proper Medha

45:38.960 --> 45:46.960
as they call it this Ekadesha Rudras,
you see, to be cleared out;

45:46.960 --> 45:49.200
and they have sacrificed their lives,

45:50.400 --> 45:52.880
they have sacrificed all the pleasures
of life.

45:53.920 --> 45:55.600
For them it was not a sacrifice,

45:55.600 --> 46:00.080
it is just a kind of a life
they wanted to have.

46:00.080 --> 46:03.760
For such people there’s no question
of sacrifice,

46:03.760 --> 46:11.760
but is a question of doing something
that would help to open the chakras

46:11.760 --> 46:13.840
of the people in the future.

46:14.880 --> 46:17.920
Without them we could not have
worked out Sahaja Yoga.

46:17.920 --> 46:27.840
It was essential for these people
to cleanse for us these three chakras,

46:28.720 --> 46:30.880
part of the one Chakra of Christ.

46:34.960 --> 46:39.360
All this they have worked out,
and that's why today Sahaja Yoga

46:40.560 --> 46:49.440
is so beautifully created,
so beautifully spreading, is working out.

46:50.160 --> 46:54.640
We have to thank them very much.
Of course all other incarnations

46:54.640 --> 46:55.760
also have helped,

46:55.760 --> 47:02.320
you can see, Vishuddhi, then also heart,
and all these - right heart, left heart -

47:02.320 --> 47:07.200
all these angels as they are called
in the Bible,

47:07.200 --> 47:09.840
have helped us to cross over.

47:10.480 --> 47:15.440
All these incarnations are responsible
in our evolutionary process

47:15.440 --> 47:17.760
to create these ladders for us to move.

47:21.120 --> 47:29.920
So, ultimately you reach the state
of Tapah on the sixth center

47:30.640 --> 47:33.560
and then in the state of truth, Satya.

47:35.920 --> 47:41.200
Then the truth comes to you
through Sahaja Yoga, in the brain,

47:41.200 --> 47:43.680
in the limbic area
when the Kundalini enters,

47:44.880 --> 47:52.240
She puts light there,
She creates enlightened personalities

47:52.240 --> 47:56.480
and then She joins this
all-pervading power of divine love,

47:58.560 --> 48:05.840
and with this divine love you are
completely changed and transformed.

48:08.640 --> 48:16.880
So their contribution to the ascent
of human beings has been great,

48:17.440 --> 48:19.840
and that of Christ has been the greatest.

48:21.680 --> 48:28.560
And when we say we have to follow Christ,
we should try to see

48:29.520 --> 48:33.840
how much detachment we have.

48:34.720 --> 48:39.200
They say His brothers and sisters,
or somebody came to see Him.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.520
They say He had brothers.

48:43.120 --> 48:45.920
So He said, “Who are My brothers?
These are My brothers,

48:46.800 --> 48:48.080
these are My relations.”

48:49.680 --> 48:54.400
Gyaneshwara said the same thing,
that "They will become your relations.

48:58.880 --> 49:02.320
They will be your relations,
they'll be your brothers and sisters,

49:02.320 --> 49:05.280
and not those who are not enlightened.

49:06.320 --> 49:10.480
They are not your relations
because they don’t understand you.

49:10.480 --> 49:19.280
They don’t have entry into the Kingdom
of God, so they are not your relations."

49:20.560 --> 49:29.840
In His lifetime, He led a life
of a person who was very simple.

49:31.120 --> 49:34.160
Didn’t bother about clothes or anything.

49:34.160 --> 49:38.160
All the conditioning of the worldly
things were not His,

49:38.160 --> 49:42.720
but He was not shameless type of a person
who would accept any kind of a nudity

49:42.720 --> 49:43.440
and this and that.

49:45.600 --> 49:49.360
Even about Mahavira
there’s a big misconcept.

49:50.480 --> 49:57.840
He was once praying in a garden
where there were lots of bushes,

49:57.840 --> 49:59.200
we call them kunjas,

50:00.320 --> 50:04.720
and in the bush His cloth, which was
only one cloth He was putting on,

50:05.760 --> 50:06.400
was caught up.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.880
So He cut half of it
and was covering Himself.

50:09.680 --> 50:13.360
Shri Krishna went to test Him,

50:14.720 --> 50:17.840
and He said that “I have nothing,
I am just nude,

50:18.400 --> 50:20.080
so why don’t you give Me your cloth?

50:20.080 --> 50:22.960
Because, after all, You are a king.”

50:24.400 --> 50:27.040
So He took out his cloth
and gave it to Shri Krishna,

50:28.080 --> 50:36.160
and got some leaves to cover Himself
and He was in His own garden,

50:36.160 --> 50:38.080
and went into His own palace.

50:39.520 --> 50:43.360
Now, if you see the Jains,
they make everything so horrible

50:43.360 --> 50:44.880
and insult Him all the time.

50:47.040 --> 50:52.000
Most of the people who follow
all these great incarnations

50:52.000 --> 50:54.840
really all the time insult them.

50:57.200 --> 51:02.080
They don’t follow, they insult,
and by their behavior, you see,

51:02.080 --> 51:08.080
we form such a bad opinion
of all these people.

51:08.080 --> 51:12.000
I met one gentleman in Chicago.
It was very cold.

51:12.800 --> 51:16.560
He was the head
of the Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

51:16.560 --> 51:21.840
He was wearing a dhoti which was so thin,
and he was shaking before Me.

51:22.800 --> 51:27.360
I said, “What’s the matter?”
He said, “I’m feeling very cold.”

51:27.360 --> 51:29.040
I said, “Why are you wearing this dhoti?”

51:29.920 --> 51:34.880
He said, “My guru has told me if you
wear a dhoti you will go to heaven.”

51:34.880 --> 51:40.320
I said, “Really? In India eighty percent
people wear nothing but dhotis,

51:40.960 --> 51:42.400
are they all going to go to heaven?

51:42.400 --> 51:45.600
And many must have gone already,
so where will you be?”

51:47.040 --> 51:47.760
Didn’t like it.

51:47.760 --> 51:53.920
Then I said, "Why you shaved your hair
and put this …”we call it shindi,

51:53.920 --> 51:54.880
or in Hindi, bhodi.

51:54.880 --> 51:58.800
I don’t know what you call -
pig’s tail here, pig’s tail?

51:58.800 --> 52:04.640
So he says, “It is because my guru
told me that I must shave my head

52:04.640 --> 52:06.320
and have this kind of a thing.”

52:06.320 --> 52:11.360
So I think perhaps, maybe he will be
tied to some rope

52:11.360 --> 52:12.960
and pulled in the heaven or something,

52:16.080 --> 52:17.840
I said.

52:19.840 --> 52:24.880
Kabira has said - Kabira was one of them
who has tried to slash out

52:24.880 --> 52:25.840
all your conditioning.

52:27.520 --> 52:32.800
He said, “By shaving your head,
if you are going to go to heaven,

52:35.680 --> 52:44.320
so what about the lamb
which is shaved twice a year?

52:44.880 --> 52:46.400
He’ll be there earlier than you.”

52:48.720 --> 52:50.880
It’s a fact, it's so, such stupid things.

52:51.440 --> 52:55.280
And there are Jain sadhus
who will remain absolutely nude

52:55.280 --> 52:57.120
and will pull their hair.

52:57.120 --> 53:00.400
Now by law they are allowed
to go nude on the street,

53:00.400 --> 53:03.760
you know, insulting everyone.

53:05.040 --> 53:10.160
All such stupid things are happening
in the name of religion -

53:10.160 --> 53:13.840
that, too, of Buddha, Mahavira,
and Christ.

53:16.640 --> 53:23.120
They are the Ones who are trying
to pull us away from rationality,

53:24.480 --> 53:25.920
because you have to cross this.

53:27.040 --> 53:35.920
All your limitations are because
of this thinking, conditioning.

53:37.280 --> 53:42.400
We have to go beyond because by thinking,
what do we do?

53:43.600 --> 53:48.480
We move in a linear way
and then there’s no truth in it,

53:48.480 --> 53:51.200
so the whole thing comes back, boomerangs,
and you are finished.

53:55.360 --> 54:00.080
We have to go beyond this mind;
must understand this point is.

54:00.080 --> 54:04.160
Christ has done this
so that we can go beyond our mind.

54:07.520 --> 54:10.960
If you don’t know how to go beyond mind,
better sit down for your meditation,

54:11.680 --> 54:12.400
work it out.

54:13.440 --> 54:15.840
With this mind
all kinds of things will come.

54:15.840 --> 54:24.320
Temper will come, intrigue will come,
jealousies will come,

54:24.320 --> 54:32.920
all the six enemies that we have
will come to us through this mind –

54:34.320 --> 54:39.680
means thinking, rationality.
Everything can be rationalized.

54:40.560 --> 54:44.960
“Why did you murder your wife?”
"Because I hated her.

54:44.960 --> 54:46.960
She was this, she was that,
she was that.”

54:46.960 --> 54:52.000
But you cannot murder her.
“Why did you murder your husband?”

54:52.000 --> 54:54.080
“Because of this, because of that.”

54:54.080 --> 55:00.640
Because of this mind we start doing
things which are absolutely wrong,

55:00.640 --> 55:02.080
which are sinful,

55:02.080 --> 55:04.560
and then we try to rationalize it.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.800
Go against Agnya, go against reality,

55:11.360 --> 55:24.560
and then use your conditioning, use your,
we can call, the ego to explain it,

55:24.560 --> 55:26.560
why you did it.

55:26.560 --> 55:30.000
All the time when we are doing like that
we can never go beyond mind.

55:31.440 --> 55:35.920
We are so self-satisfied about ourselves.
We think no end of ourselves.

55:37.280 --> 55:42.160
Now, how are we to get out of it?

55:45.920 --> 55:47.840
Introspection.

55:49.840 --> 55:53.040
But it’s very difficult
because people are afraid of themselves.

55:53.040 --> 55:57.200
They don’t want to introspect,
because once they start introspecting

55:57.200 --> 56:02.240
they will know how sinful they have been,
how wrong things they have been doing.

56:04.560 --> 56:09.280
And then they’ll hate themselves.
So they don’t want to introspect.

56:11.040 --> 56:15.840
But it’s very important
that we should introspect.

56:17.440 --> 56:25.520
That introspection is very helpful
for you to overcome these two hurdles

56:27.040 --> 56:29.840
of your Agnya Chakra.

56:32.800 --> 56:35.760
I’ve told you many a times:
don’t argue with anybody

56:36.480 --> 56:37.520
because the other fellow,

56:37.520 --> 56:41.440
he is asking for argument
is the one has lots of ego,

56:42.640 --> 56:46.720
and that ego is acting on you.

56:47.840 --> 56:53.760
So action/reaction starts,
and we develop a habit

56:53.760 --> 56:55.280
of reacting to everything.

56:56.400 --> 56:58.560
Specially in the West,
I have seen they react to everything,

56:59.200 --> 56:59.700
everything.

57:00.880 --> 57:03.520
For example, now, this thing is
spread out here,

57:03.520 --> 57:04.480
now they have nothing to do.

57:05.040 --> 57:08.800
“But they could have had better,
why is it so thin?”

57:09.520 --> 57:11.840
Well you pay for it now, you do it.

57:13.360 --> 57:16.000
They are walking across,
they meet someone.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
"See, see this man.
What sort of a person he is?”

57:20.400 --> 57:23.280
If there’s a beggar,
then they’ll start criticizing.

57:24.080 --> 57:28.080
They'll criticize the government;
they’ll criticize everyone.

57:28.080 --> 57:29.040
What about yourself?

57:30.560 --> 57:34.160
Instead of that why don’t you
start doing something about it?

57:34.160 --> 57:38.000
If you can’t help it,
if you are not going to do anything

57:38.000 --> 57:39.840
about it, why react?

57:41.280 --> 57:45.040
And this is the worst habit
we have developed is to react,

57:45.040 --> 57:48.000
and we think we have every right to react.

57:48.000 --> 57:54.400
You have, but this right
is self-destructive.

57:56.880 --> 58:01.440
To react on everything is not proper.

58:02.080 --> 58:06.160
You have no authority to react.
It is to that extent.

58:07.360 --> 58:11.600
You have to just witness,
witness the whole thing.

58:12.800 --> 58:16.640
Once you start witnessing,
you’ll be amazed

58:16.640 --> 58:21.200
that you will start seeing the play,
play of the maya,

58:21.200 --> 58:24.400
as they call it,
and you will see where you stand with it.

58:26.720 --> 58:33.200
Witnessing should be developed.
All the time, witness. Am I witnessing?

58:34.880 --> 58:39.920
Many people say that I have very good
memory because I am all the time

58:40.640 --> 58:41.360
witnessing.

58:42.560 --> 58:45.120
Everything is recorded within Me
like a picture.

58:48.160 --> 58:52.880
And then, when I have to say something,
I have to correct something,

58:53.440 --> 58:57.240
all that I have witnessed
comes to help Me.

59:00.480 --> 59:05.680
First of all, we should not react,
react to anything.

59:06.800 --> 59:09.120
Some people are attached, say, to money.

59:11.360 --> 59:16.320
They’ll react, they’ll not give any money,
they’ll keep all the money with themselves.

59:18.560 --> 59:20.000
In Sahaja Yoga also it happens.

59:20.960 --> 59:24.080
I’ve seen people who are very,
very miserly about money.

59:25.840 --> 59:28.080
Another ones are who try to please others,

59:29.120 --> 59:32.640
then they’ll waste their money
on lavish things for nothing at all.

59:32.640 --> 59:33.680
There’s no need to waste.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.360
Reaction can come through anything.

59:43.040 --> 59:50.240
Seeing something you can react
and you become so engrossed with it

59:50.240 --> 59:54.240
that you don’t realize that you are wasting
all your brain energy

59:54.240 --> 59:55.600
on nonsensical things.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.640
This reaction comes when you have
lost complete sense of judgment.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:10.560
You don’t know what you are losing,
what you are gaining

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.840
by this kind of reaction.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:22.240
And this reaction is going to destroy
your inner being completely,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.312
because all the time you are here
and you are there, and you’re there,

01:00:26.312 --> 01:00:29.040
and you are there,
and you are nowhere here.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.360
If you are a very criticizing
type of a person,

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.480
try to stop it completely.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.840
Criticize yourself,
direct that energy towards yourself.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:48.680
"Who am I to criticize others?
Who am I to react to anything? ”

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:58.400
Put a challenge to yourself, and you will
see that your ego will subside.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.200
One day somebody came and told Me
that “Mother I feel so angry,

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.240
I feel like beating everyone.”

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.560
I said, “All right, do one thing.
Take a chappel and hit on your head.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.060
Finished.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.480
That’s the only way you can get rid
of this habit

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:24.080
that you want to beat others.”

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.520
Didn’t like it much,
but I think by that he is improved.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.160
Now, conditioning also should be seen.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.680
“Am I a conditioned person?

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.800
If my conditioning is there, then is it
a good conditioning or a bad conditioning? “

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.400
At least you should have good conditioning.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.000
But even that, to an extreme if you go,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.720
you can create a problem for yourself
and for others.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.000
Most of these rituals and things
started as a good conditioning.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.360
Then it became like a trap,

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.720
and they could not get out of it.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.880
It’s a part and parcel of it,
one has to accept.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.400
Then what should we do?
We should not react.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.440
Just see the drama and you’ll be surprised,

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.000
without paying anything,
without going to any theatre,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.560
every moment you can see
the drama going on before you,

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:42.320
which is so enjoyable, whether it is absurd,
whether it is ridiculous,

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:50.400
whether it is a sort of a - as you see
in the films, you see,

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:56.160
beating somebody and all that,
you just see it and you do not react.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.120
Anything that you think is very perverse,
ugly, immoral -

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.040
don’t see, finished, gone.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.680
So don’t tax your mind, because in the mind
that we call it, so-called mind,

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.560
it's actually the Agnya Chakra
in the center of

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.080
your optic chiasma.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.920
Just imagine.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.840
What a central place it has!

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:35.360
And any disturbance to your Agnya,
what it can do to your brain

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:39.120
which is nothing but a lump of fat.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.840
So how this Agnya can affect you,

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.600
and how it works
and creates perverted images,

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.320
that is to be really seen.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:00.000
Conditionings, also you have seen,
people are mentally so upset

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.200
and so degenerated.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.600
But the pure nature of Christ is innocence,
you know that.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.080
He's Shri Ganesha.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.400
Shri Ganesha is an eternal Child.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:25.840
Christ is also complete innocence
because He doesn’t react,

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.360
because He is not conditioned.
Children are not conditioned

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.320
so much as we are.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.480
If you talk to children,
if you speak to them,

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:46.720
you’ll be amazed how innocent they are
and how innocently they talk.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.760
Once My granddaughter asked Me,
“What do You think

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.480
of the poor children of the tiger?”
I said, “Why?”

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:04.320
“You know their father tells them
that ‘You eat human beings,’

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.720
and what can they do?

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:11.120
They have to eat human beings after all.”
You see, so innocent.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:16.560
So I told her that they are under
a complete control of God.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:21.840
Whatever they are doing,
they are not going to be held responsible.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.560
It’s only for human beings

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.560
that God has given this freedom.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:44.000
It’s only human beings
who can react in this manner.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.880
So for animals it is, they are pashus,

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:54.160
means they are completely under
the control of the God Almighty.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.920
So they are swabhavas, everything,
a serpent will be a serpent,

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:05.920
and a tiger will be a tiger,
and they will say a lion will be a lion.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:11.680
But human being can be a serpent,
at the same time could be a scorpion,

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.080
could be a lion, could be anything,

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:19.520
you know suddenly you find a small
little bug-like man coming up

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:23.920
like a lion roaring at you, and you say,
“From where does this come, this cannon?”

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.120
It is so. You don’t know which way
they will come,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.160
and which way the camel will sit.
You can’t say.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:46.000
So this reaction of human beings comes
because he is not in connection

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.880
with the Divine.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:54.720
When he is in the connection with the
Divine, he sees the drama,

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:58.080
and he leaves everything to Divine.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.080
He can solve all his problem
by just one bandhan.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:11.520
He can solve all the problems
just by a bandhan.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.400
But he should be in full connection
with the Divine.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.840
It works, it works. It does work.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.080
This is not the time when Christ
came on this earth.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:34.040
This is the time where this Paramchaitanya
has gone into action –

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.680
activated, is working out everything.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:46.480
Now they asked Me about this Shri Ganesha,
whether Shri Ganesha drank milk or not.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.000
I said, “Anything possible.”

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.760
These days this Paramachaitanya is
doing such things, unbelievable things,

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.960
which we cannot understand,
everything is a chamatkar.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.680
So it’s possible.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.840
Ganeshas, I’ve never heard
of Ganesha liking milk so much,

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:12.400
but maybe for the little rat
He might be taking. Can’t say.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.720
“But why did Shiva drink?” I said,
“Let it be, let Shiva wants to drink,

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.440
let Him have milk.”

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:24.160
Actually we have too much milk production,
so They must be wanting to consume some.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:29.120
But it’s just a way at looking at things
that, you see,

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:32.160
when everything is done
by this Paramchaitanya.

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:38.000
They are doing such wonderful things,
I mean, I never asked Them to do anything.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.560
But now, for example,
in Brisbane when I was there,

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.000
I was sleeping in the ashram,
and a rainbow appeared.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.040
Of course I like paintings very much,
of Raphael specially,

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:55.520
because he has drawn the Mother’s face,

01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.160
and the Child’s face so exactly,
expressing the feeling

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.200
of mother and the child.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.480
And imagine, that picture
appears in the sky,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.560
and I didn’t tell them to show that Raphael.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.960
When I was sleeping
I was not even going to look at it.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:20.000
But at this time, the halo that was
on the back side of Mary

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.120
comes upon the head.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.040
Means Raphael himself did it,
or, I don’t know.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.040
How can I explain?

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:30.320
This Paramchaitanya is doing
all kinds of things,

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.800
and it does all this just
to convince you about Sahaja Yoga.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.080
Because even now there are many
who are supposed to be very rational,

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:49.440
intelligent, educated,
who don’t want to accept.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.800
After all, if there is a divine power,
if there is something like that

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:58.640
and is active, how can you challenge it?

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.840
How can you say no to it?

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:11.520
Because the powers are unlimited,
it has gone into every atom

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.840
and every molecule.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.480
It doesn’t do tricks,
like moving this from there to there,

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:29.840
but what it does is to do something
which is absolutely impossible.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:43.840
It is doing. So for us to believe
in this activated Paramchaitanya

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.320
is the only solution.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:51.600
So you leave it in the ocean of bliss,
and let this great power

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.040
handle all these situations.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:11:00.480
Don’t react yourself.
Which is so efficient, so quick, so fast,

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.880
moves all over, understands everything,

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:12.320
and it loves you and respects you
because you are Sahaja Yogis.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.760
This is what it is today:
we should know at the time

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.360
when we are celebrating Christmas

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:23.360
that what we are celebrating
is really our own ascent,

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.560
our own achievements,

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:34.240
our own lofty heights which we have achieved
and which we have to achieve.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.160
We should have only aspirations
as far as our spiritual side is concerned.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.720
All aspirations should be left
to this Paramchaitanya,

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.080
“You look after that.”

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:54.400
And the more you become,
the more you develop

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.080
this non-reacting attitude
through your proper Agnya.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.800
Not anger, not silence,
but a very pleasant temperament.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.800
That means people think
that I have told you not to speak.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:13.680
No, no, you must speak.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.440
You must talk to people,
you must laugh, you must enjoy;

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.240
but all this should be full
of joyous feelings.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:32.560
That’s what they say
that Christmas is for a very joyous atmosphere.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.080
So they can’t do that way so they drink.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.080
I mean, after all, you must give them
benefit of doubt also

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.680
that why do they drink?

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.960
They think by drinking
they will become joyous.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.240
Now our understanding about ourselves
has to be very clear-cut.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.160
Specially, people don’t meditate.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.640
They just don’t meditate.
They don’t want to grow.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.160
They are Sahaja Yogis
but they don’t meditate.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:11.360
It’s very surprising, I can make out
who meditates, who does not,

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.680
because there is no depth.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:18.160
They want to have this, they want
to have that, is all right,

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.760
but what about meditation?

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:28.160
If you don’t meditate, your Agnya will be
completely covered with thoughts,

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.160
and you’ll be lost.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.560
So you have to meditate.
If you don’t meditate, I also suffer.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.000
If you have no aspirations in Sahaja Yoga
it's better to leave,

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.720
because you are like seeds
which are sprouted

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.720
and which will be wasted.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:57.040
Some people are here because they want
some sort of a platform, some publicity.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.920
Some are here who want money,
to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.240
There are some who want to have
a kind of a communication,

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.640
to go round the whole world
without paying a single pai.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:28.160
All such people are of no use to themselves.
Now here you have the complete wealth.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:36.480
All that celestial wealth is before you,
and you are not going to accept it,

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.120
you are not going to drown into it.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.600
What should we say?
It’s not very sensible to do.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.280
As I said, you don’t have to
crucify yourself,

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.280
you don’t have to give up anything,

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:55.760
you don’t have to live like Christ
had to live or be born in the manger.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.440
All that’s done for you already.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:04.880
Now come along.
But if you are coming in the darbar

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.800
of the Divine, then be worth it.

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.800
You should be worth it.
And you’ll be surprised,

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.960
all your problems will be solved.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.760
Your self-respect will be maintained.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.280
So many things have happened like that,

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.040
but if you have no self-respect,
you don’t respect your Realization,

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:34.640
you are not deeply involved as to your
own ascent and the help to others,

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.880
it will not work out.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.320
I’m here to tell you all these things
which Christ could not tell.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:46.560
I had to fulfil what He wanted to say.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.120
All those things I am saying to you.

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.520
It has already worked,
you all have got Realization,

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.720
but develop respect for yourself
as Sahaja yogis.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.880
Don’t have funny ideas about yourself.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:05.920
Just know you are a Sahaja yogi
and a Sahaja yogini.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:11.760
That’s what is needed for a person
if he is today celebrating

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.440
the birth of Christ.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:23.760
He came on this Earth
who was actually Christ, full of innocence,

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:33.840
who was the One who came
as the embodiment of Shri Ganesha.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:41.040
I have given the proof of it to you,
how the carbon atom looks like,

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.880
and by which I have proved that Christ
is the Alpha and Omega,

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:52.880
while He is made out of Omkara
and Swastika.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.680
All this we have experimented.
We have found it. It’s there.

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:05.680
With all this, what is the greatest
achievement is to respect your innocence.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.320
Respect your innocence.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:15.920
This is what is to be asked for today:
be innocent,

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.960
and God looks after
all the innocent people.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.320
Don’t worry, don’t have to worry.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:27.440
I’ve seen children falling for seven
storeys, nothing happens to them.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.640
They are perfectly all right. How?
Who looks after them? Angels.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.920
You have seen photographs
of angels around you.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:41.920
So try to be simple, innocent,
not reactive,

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.520
and keep quiet and peaceful

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.200
because here we are talking about
the global transformation

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.480
where people will find their peace
in their heart

01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:04.560
and will establish a new world
of peace, joy and spirituality.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:11.840
May God bless you all.
