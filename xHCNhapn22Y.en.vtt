00:02.000 --> 00:06.892
1995-1225 Christmas Puja Talk, Ganapatipule, India,

00:07.000 --> 00:13.892
It is a great day when Christ came on this earth.

00:16.000 --> 00:24.892
And you know about how He was specially created

00:25.000 --> 00:36.892
to come down as a human being to work out the salvation of the people.

00:48.000 --> 00:55.892
It is said that He came to India, in Kashmir,

00:56.000 --> 01:01.892
and He met there the King Shalivahana.

01:05.000 --> 01:17.892
It’s all in Sanskrit; I’ve read that the conversation took place between Christ and King Shalivahana,

01:18.000 --> 01:22.892
who was a great devotee of the Mother.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.892
And he asked Him, “What is Your name?” In Sanskrit it’s all written.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.892
So He said, “I come from a country where people believe in filth,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.892
and I think this is My own country.”

01:41.000 --> 01:46.892
So Shalivahana said, “You are such a great person, who has come on this earth,

01:50.000 --> 01:55.892
so You should go back to those countries to save them

01:56.000 --> 02:05.892
and to tell them about the pure principle of life.”

02:06.000 --> 02:09.892
In Sanskrit it was written Nirmala Tattwa.

02:13.000 --> 02:23.892
And Christ went back, and after three and a half years only He was crucified.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.892
These were special days, I call them the days of tapasya.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.892
Same time Buddha and Mahavira were born,

02:46.000 --> 02:54.892
at the same level of the Virata’s forehead.

02:55.000 --> 03:14.892
As you know that according to Vedas, there are seven awarenesses we can go through,

03:15.000 --> 03:21.892
or the subtle qualities we have within ourselves.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.892
The first one was the Bhu. Bhu is Ganesha was created.

03:31.000 --> 03:40.892
Second is Bhurvah, meaning antariksha, means “all that is created around us.”

03:45.000 --> 03:49.892
The third one is Swaha at Nabhi Chakra.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.892
Swaha is the one where you consume everything.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.892
Is in modern times, you see, people go on consuming everything.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.892
All kinds of books they will read; they’ll go to all kinds of things,

04:04.000 --> 04:05.892
and if you tell them, “Why do you do it?”

04:06.000 --> 04:08.892
“What’s wrong?”

04:09.000 --> 04:10.892
“Why do you dress up like this?”

04:11.000 --> 04:12.892
“What’s wrong?”

04:13.000 --> 04:17.892
This just consumption of everything goes on.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.892
But then at that time also there is

04:25.000 --> 04:29.892
another great thing within us is called as Swadha,

04:30.000 --> 04:40.892
where we sustain the dharma within us. Swadha.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.892
Dharma of everything.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.892
See, those people who say there should be no blind faith and this and that,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.892
it’s not blind, but it’s an inner urge.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.892
Why we love our parents? Because there’s a dharma within us.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.892
Why do we live, we live in our country?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.892
Because there’s a dharma within us.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.892
All these dharmas are there. Why a wife loves her husband?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.892
Because there is dharma.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.892
Why the husband loves the wife? Because there is dharma.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.892
When this dharma is within you - we'll not call it religion

05:21.000 --> 05:27.892
because it can mean something else – this one is sustained, dharaiti.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.892
Once it is sustained within ourselves, it becomes Swadha.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.892
That’s our capacity; that’s our quality.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.892
We can call it an innate understanding.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.892
Some of them are even in the animals,

05:47.000 --> 05:52.892
like attachment to parents, attachment to their masters.

05:58.000 --> 06:06.892
Then comes the higher awareness where your Manah - now it's not mind.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.892
There’s very confusion; there’s a big confusion. Mind,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.892
you see, English language is really quite confusing.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.892
Manah means “by which we have emotions.”

06:19.000 --> 06:25.892
Now recently I read that they are now talking about, not only of IQ

06:26.000 --> 06:29.892
but EQ, means emotional coefficience.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.892
That means a person who has only intelligence is not all right,

06:37.000 --> 06:41.892
he must also have the balance of emotions. They are coming to it now.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.892
But first they only used to praise people who have IQ.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.892
That’s not the situation. So now it is different,

06:52.000 --> 07:00.892
perhaps they are realizing that through intelligence how people have created chaos, violence,

07:01.000 --> 07:07.892
all kinds of destruction on this earth.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.892
So now they are talking about a higher capacity within us

07:13.000 --> 07:17.892
called as EQ, which capacity is emotional.

07:18.000 --> 07:28.892
This emotional capacity comes to you as an inner urge,

07:29.000 --> 07:36.892
as an inner capability which you cannot avoid.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.892
A person may be anything in life, but if he has no love,

07:45.000 --> 07:54.892
if he hasn’t got any emotional feelings, then he is not complete.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.892
Now these emotional things also could be very limited, no doubt.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.892
There could be something that get attached to somebody, or something can happen,

08:08.000 --> 08:13.892
as also the IQ, where we get attached to some idea.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.892
Like Hitler had some idea, and he believed that it was the truth, and he has to do it.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.892
So when you get attached to one idea like that,

08:26.000 --> 08:37.892
you can just do things which are not at all helpful, supportive or nourishing to reality.

08:40.000 --> 08:47.892
All these things have happened: wars, destruction, also,

08:48.000 --> 08:54.892
as you see nowadays, the people are trying to secretly destroy others.

08:55.000 --> 09:02.892
All these are coming as the anti-feeling

09:03.000 --> 09:12.892
where the Manah has developed a domination of the intelligence,

09:14.000 --> 09:20.892
where emotions are dominated by intelligence and rationality.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.892
So there is another awareness within us, another capability within us,

09:31.000 --> 09:35.892
another urge within us, innately built is the Janah.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.892
Janah means the people, the communication.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.892
You cannot live alone; you see a man who goes to jail, he’s quite happy,

09:50.000 --> 09:55.892
he’s quite comfortable, he doesn’t have to do any work, everything is done for him

09:56.000 --> 10:02.892
if he has a good class, he lives very well, much better than he would live outside.

10:03.000 --> 10:12.892
But the only thing is, he cannot meet other people, he cannot communicate.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.892
And when this capacity of communication which is within us - I mean,

10:19.000 --> 10:26.892
which is a part and parcel of human existence - is taken away,

10:27.000 --> 10:33.892
a person in the jail feels absolutely frustrated and unhappy.

10:39.000 --> 10:46.892
He doesn’t mind laboring, doing all kinds of menial work,

10:47.000 --> 10:56.892
as long as he’s not in the jail, cut out of the communications with others.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.892
So this communication is also an inner urge within us.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.892
In that also people sometimes go too far and neglect other dharmas.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.892
They are more bothered about communication

11:14.000 --> 11:16.892
than about other dharmas which are very important.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.892
So there is no balance in a person.

11:25.000 --> 11:35.892
Then comes the sixth awareness within us, which is a very interesting thing.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.892
One was where we take to conditionings.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.892
Say, if I am an Indian, then I am very proud of Indians;

11:50.000 --> 11:55.892
I can never see anything wrong with them, or I may see everything wrong with them,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.892
it can be both ways.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.892
How you have been conditioned is the point,

12:02.000 --> 12:09.892
and this conditioning comes to us through our sixth center of Agnya.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.892
And the another thing that we develop

12:15.000 --> 12:21.892
when somebody tries to condition us or to control us,

12:22.000 --> 12:29.892
we try to get out of it, or sometimes we try to dominate.

12:30.000 --> 12:36.892
This dominating capacity is also within us innately built.

12:39.000 --> 12:46.892
Both things are innately built within us that we go on getting ourselves conditioned.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.892
For example I would say that in very stupid, silly manner, people get conditioned,

12:57.000 --> 13:01.892
is impossible to get them out of it.

13:02.000 --> 13:12.892
It always comes out of self-centeredness that a person has no value for understanding.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.892
Like now somebody comes to your house, he’s a vegetarian,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.892
all right. Now he stays with you.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.892
So, "I’m a vegetarian, you must get new utensils to cook the food

13:30.000 --> 13:35.892
because I can’t have food in the utensils where the meat is cooked.”

13:36.000 --> 13:43.892
All right. Then, “You must get your servant in a proper manner,

13:44.000 --> 13:53.892
so send him to some place where you can get the well water.”

13:54.000 --> 14:00.892
The servant must be absolutely drenched - this is typical Indian old style -

14:01.000 --> 14:09.892
and should go and draw the water from the well, and “bring me it for drinking and cooking,”

14:10.000 --> 14:13.892
while the servant dies of pneumonia, doesn’t matter.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.892
All such stupid conditionings we have,

14:19.000 --> 14:24.892
but it's not only that in the East you find all these conditionings - the West is even worse.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.892
For example, they have clubbing.

14:30.000 --> 14:39.892
Now, there are clubs where people wear particular type of clothes;

14:40.000 --> 14:46.892
it’s a club. Now, if they wear something else then everybody will laugh at them.

14:47.000 --> 14:54.892
Or how to use the spoon and fork is very important in the West, how they use spoon and fork.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.892
Specially English have this nonsensical conditioning.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.892
If somebody uses the fork and spoon in a wrong way then, finished!

15:04.000 --> 15:08.892
He is nowhere; he is not sophisticated.

15:09.000 --> 15:17.892
The ideas of sophistication and all that comes through conditioning of ages,

15:18.000 --> 15:23.892
because maybe they were primitive to begin with, they had no clothes,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.892
proper clothes to wear,

15:27.000 --> 15:33.892
might be they were covering themselves with some leaves or something,

15:34.000 --> 15:39.892
I mean, only hundreds of years back.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.892
So now they have jumped to the other side, very particular about their dress,

15:46.000 --> 15:51.892
very particular about fork and spoon.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.892
And they just can’t bear something that is different.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.892
“I don’t like that,” is very common there, “I don’t like. I don’t like.”

16:05.000 --> 16:07.892
Now, they came to India, “We don’t like.”

16:08.000 --> 16:10.892
“What you don’t like?”

16:11.000 --> 16:12.892
“We don’t like the way Indians dress up.”

16:13.000 --> 16:15.892
“All right, you dress up the way you like,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.892
let Indians dress up the like they like.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.892
Now why do you think that your dress in England will suit here in India,

16:25.000 --> 16:29.892
which is such a hot, hot, hot country?”

16:30.000 --> 16:34.892
But no, “This is how we are.” It’s quite funny the way they have,

16:35.000 --> 16:46.892
and this conditioning goes on into such a deep manner that nobody sees the stupidity behind it.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.892
For example, if the Queen has invited you, you must wear a tailcoat,

16:53.000 --> 16:56.892
and now it's very expensive to have a tailcoat.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.892
Now, they have to go to a particular shop to borrow it.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.892
Sometimes they're loose, and sometimes they're tight.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.892
I have seen people coming to these parties, Queen’s parties,

17:10.000 --> 17:14.892
I could never recognize them because somebody looked like Charlie Chaplin,

17:15.000 --> 17:19.892
or somebody looked like Laurel, or somebody like Hardy.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.892
I couldn’t make out who are these people.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.892
Then I was told, “He's that such and such ambassador.”

17:26.000 --> 17:28.892
“Oh my God, I know him very well, what has happened to him?”

17:29.000 --> 17:30.892
They cannot walk straight,

17:31.000 --> 17:38.892
their gait changes because of the clothes which are so tight sometimes, and sometimes so loose.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.892
But you have to wear.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.892
All these formal ideas come to us as a kind of a part and parcel of you,

17:48.000 --> 17:51.892
because you accept all these conditionings.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.892
So the other side it goes to, that we abandon all this,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.892
we don’t want all, we're anti-culture.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.892
So I met one gentleman who was wearing a pant which had lots of holes in it.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.892
Imagine in the cold of London to wear a pant like that.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.892
So I said, “Why do you want to wear a pant which has holes?”

18:17.000 --> 18:18.892
He said, “This is a holy pant."

18:19.000 --> 18:21.892
“Holey?

18:22.000 --> 18:26.892
My goodness, it will give you varicose veins, it's horrible.”

18:27.000 --> 18:28.892
“What’s wrong?

18:29.000 --> 18:34.892
We are anti-culture people so we are taking now to holey pants.”

18:35.000 --> 18:38.892
I mean, such stupid people are not only who are uneducated,

18:39.000 --> 18:45.892
but very well educated people, highly-placed people, are so conditioned,

18:46.000 --> 18:51.892
and this conditioning has caused so much damage to human beings.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.892
For example, to accept Freud had become just a complete religion in the West.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.892
Freud became Christ at that level, though he was a Jew.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.892
And he dominated the Western culture so much

19:11.000 --> 19:15.892
that I just couldn’t understand the impact of this stupid man

19:16.000 --> 19:19.892
who would have been thrown in the sea if he had come to India.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.892
But the conditioning part is: "Everything is written is law,"

19:25.000 --> 19:28.892
and they accepted this man so much

19:29.000 --> 19:35.892
that the culture of the West became absolutely self-destructive throughout.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.892
No respect, no morality, nothing was lofty,

19:42.000 --> 19:46.892
all value systems shattered

19:47.000 --> 19:52.892
because they accepted this kind of nonsense because it was written.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.892
Even today I hear, “In such and such book, such is written;

19:57.000 --> 20:01.892
in that book such and such thing is written.” This is terrible condition.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.892
For example, it’s written in the Bible that Jews crucified Christ.

20:07.000 --> 20:12.892
Nonsense! Just use your brains. How can Jews crucify Christ?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.892
They were in the multitude.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.892
In any country have you heard that a person can be crucified

20:21.000 --> 20:22.892
with the general opinion of the people?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.892
It’s the government, the Roman government did that.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.892
But to put the blame on the Jews was a very good idea

20:31.000 --> 20:33.892
of a very cunning man called as Mr. Paul,

20:34.000 --> 20:38.892
and people accepted that because it suited them to hate the Jews.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.892
Then the Jews started creating people like Freud.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.892
So all such conditionings also have reactions,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.892
and these conditionings then build up, and once they build up,

20:51.000 --> 20:56.892
their reactions also build up and you have a country full of all kinds of chaos,

20:57.000 --> 21:01.892
fear, violence and destruction.

21:05.000 --> 21:10.892
The conditioning is more also with the idea of possession:

21:11.000 --> 21:12.892
“This is my land.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.892
This possession is mine. That is this, that.”

21:18.000 --> 21:20.892
Like this it goes up to a point where people

21:21.000 --> 21:25.892
who believed in the formless God also fight for the land.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.892
Why should they? They believe in the formless God,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.892
so why should they fight for the land?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.892
But they’ll go on fighting for the land,

21:35.000 --> 21:44.892
and this fighting for the land can go to any extent of very cruel things

21:45.000 --> 21:50.892
that whole country can work out.

21:51.000 --> 22:01.892
Conditionings are of every kind, if you see, are blinding your eyes.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.892
For example they believe in Koran.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.892
Simple thing is, Koran was never written by Mohammed Sahib.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.892
He never knew how to read and write.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.892
It’s a fact.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.892
For forty years it was not written.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.892
There was a fellow called Mua’wiya or something like that,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.892
who killed Hazrat Ali, his sons.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.892
He was the second Calipha; the first one died very early.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.892
Then he killed the third one also.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.892
Then he killed the fourth one, just to become himself the Calipha,

22:43.000 --> 22:47.892
and the liver of this fourth Calipha was eaten

22:48.000 --> 22:53.892
by the mother of this horrible fellow who hated women.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.892
So he puts it down in the Koran, all the things against women,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.892
and people accept it because it’s in the Koran.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.892
Somebody has made fun of Koran and written what's wrong,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.892
and it’s so stupidities, and all that.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.892
So I asked him, "What is the use of writing this book, what is the use?"

23:13.000 --> 23:15.892
He said he never thought of the use.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.892
“Then why did you write? It must have some use. It’s a useless book.”

23:21.000 --> 23:28.892
I said, "It is only useful that, by reading this, all the people who are not Muslims,

23:29.000 --> 23:39.892
will laugh at Islam, and those who are Muslims will say, 'Well, this is our book,

23:40.000 --> 23:44.892
whatever it says we believe in it, we are conditioned like that.'

23:45.000 --> 23:46.892
So you don’t solve the problem."

23:47.000 --> 23:48.892
So he said, “Then what should I do?”

23:49.000 --> 23:51.892
I said, "You write another book, saying

23:52.000 --> 23:55.892
This is all stupidity I've written of Koran,

23:56.000 --> 23:59.892
because I know it was not written by Mohammed Sahib.'

24:00.000 --> 24:03.892
Don’t write anything Mohammed Sahib, against Him.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.892
He is the One who is the incarnation of Dattatreya. It’s a fact.

24:09.000 --> 24:15.892
So you write that He never wrote it, so all these people have done all these things."

24:16.000 --> 24:20.892
This conditioning can be removed

24:21.000 --> 24:23.892
if you know what sort of life Christ led.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.892
Very important.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.892
First of all He was born in a manger.

24:32.000 --> 24:38.892
To be born in a manger means in a poor circumstance.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.892
That means He showed there’s no need to have money

24:43.000 --> 24:48.892
or there’s no need to have a huge, big properties

24:49.000 --> 24:53.892
or anything to be impressive on people.

24:54.000 --> 25:03.892
Those were the days where people respected the tapasvis, the ones who were doing tapasya.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.892
That was the time to do tapasya.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.892
So He came on this earth and lived like a tapasvi.

25:15.000 --> 25:23.892
On the contrary, the Christians are the most self-indulgent people you could think of.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.892
You go to any Christian nation, you will be amazed

25:28.000 --> 25:35.892
how they are just slaves of money and their watches.

25:36.000 --> 25:42.892
How they are living is very shocking to see they are following Christ.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.892
“Yes, we follow Christ.”

25:46.000 --> 25:48.892
Then follow means what?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.892
He’s there and you are standing backwards moving.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.892
Is that the following?

25:55.000 --> 26:00.892
If you see the Catholic Church, or even Protestants, you’ll be shocked.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.892
How are they following Christ? I can’t understand, until now I never understood,

26:06.000 --> 26:09.892
because Catholic is nothing but money-oriented.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.892
The only thing they have picked up from Christ that He went to a wedding

26:14.000 --> 26:22.892
and created wine out of water and distributed.

26:23.000 --> 26:30.892
Now this wine is just the juice of the grapes.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.892
It’s also called wine in the Hebrew language.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.892
Thank God I have read Bible in Hebrew translated directly.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.892
So it's called draksharas.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.892
Because instantly, you cannot create alcohol.

26:50.000 --> 26:56.892
It has to rot, rot, rot, and the more it rots, the more good it is, they say.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.892
They write it down, this is twenty-five years old, so is the price is much.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.892
But if it is three hundred year old the price is exorbitant.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.892
So it has to rot and smell like hell, then only it’s a good alcohol. It’s a fact.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.892
How could Christ create that instant, that moment, alcohol?

27:18.000 --> 27:21.892
But now what I find is this, that if somebody dies

27:22.000 --> 27:24.892
they will take champagne to celebrate what?

27:25.000 --> 27:31.892
Good riddance of bad rubbish? Or when somebody is born they will do it.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.892
But on Christmas day especially, after coming from church,

27:36.000 --> 27:40.892
don’t go to any Christian’s house.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.892
Even the Indian Christians have started following the Western people,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.892
because Indian Christians believe that Christ was born in England.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.892
All such ideas have come from where?

27:56.000 --> 28:02.892
Is because the English and the Portuguese and the French brought Christianity to us.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.892
Now, by any chance, are they Christians?

28:07.000 --> 28:11.892
What business they had to bring Christianity to this place?

28:14.000 --> 28:17.892
They took Christianity to all the places, specially Spanish.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.892
Spanish, Portuguese went round the whole world

28:23.000 --> 28:25.892
to spread Christianity and today is the mess

28:26.000 --> 28:31.892
that you see in those people. They are nothing but drunkards.

28:32.000 --> 28:40.892
Yesterday I was going back, and the sea was full of happiness and joy,

28:41.000 --> 28:45.892
and the water had reached a very high level. It happens with Me.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.892
But what I found, there were four, five Christians coming, singing carols,

28:50.000 --> 28:59.892
and just completely drunk, and I was thinking they’ll be drowned in this water very soon.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.892
This was the great boon of Christianity on human beings,

29:05.000 --> 29:08.892
that you can drink as much as you like.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.892
Now this drinking has come, I should say, from where? God alone knows,

29:17.000 --> 29:21.892
but it has come also from the Christians.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.892
And the Muslims also drink, no doubt,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.892
but they hide and drink.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.892
They don’t openly drink and don’t call it's a religious duty that you should drink.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.892
Imagine in the church when they give communication,

29:36.000 --> 29:40.892
they give you some sort of a dirty smelling wine.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.892
After that, how can you have communication?

29:44.000 --> 29:47.892
Once you are drunk you are finished.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.892
But all these things happen.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.892
So today we are talking about Christ.

29:54.000 --> 30:01.892
He is sitting in a position of Agnya Chakra,

30:02.000 --> 30:06.892
controlling pineal and pituitary.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.892
By that He controls our conditioning.

30:12.000 --> 30:18.892
If we follow Him then we cannot be conditioned by anything,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.892
because He talked of Spirit only.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.892
Spirit cannot be conditioned - conditioned by anything.

30:29.000 --> 30:35.892
Whatever is good that will be accepted, good, congenial to the Spirit.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.892
It’s a different attitude of a person who is spiritual.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.892
Like we had people here,

30:50.000 --> 30:54.892
I know they are not very comfortable.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.892
Some of them are put into these tents here and there,

30:59.000 --> 31:08.892
but they are enjoying because they are enjoying the spiritual atmosphere.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.892
They don’t care where they sleep, where they live, what they have.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.892
This is all because you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.892
But those who have not, so much worried,

31:22.000 --> 31:28.892
“This is not good, I want this way, that way.” All material happiness they seek,

31:29.000 --> 31:33.892
trouble everybody, criticize everybody, get angry with everybody.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.892
But actually they haven’t got spiritual joy,

31:39.000 --> 31:46.892
and they can never be really in joy unless and until they become fully spiritual.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.892
Christ has openly said that “You have to know yourself.”

31:53.000 --> 31:55.892
Same in Koran, Mohammed Sahib has said,

31:56.000 --> 31:59.892
“Unless and until you know yourself, you will not know God.”

32:00.000 --> 32:06.892
There are lots of truths in Koran, I find, left over by this Mua’wiya

32:07.000 --> 32:09.892
and also in the Bible.

32:10.000 --> 32:15.892
Also in the Jews, I find their Torah and all that has lots of truth,

32:16.000 --> 32:19.892
but is covered by all this kind of thinking,

32:20.000 --> 32:25.892
rationality and adjustments they have done for their own use.

32:29.000 --> 32:35.892
Actually we have to understand that Christ never started any exclusive religion, never.

32:36.000 --> 32:42.892
None of them. Specially Mohammed Sahib has talked about Abraham;

32:43.000 --> 32:49.892
He’s talked about Moses; He’s talked about Christ and His Mother, much more than in the Bible,

32:50.000 --> 32:51.892
respected Her.

32:52.000 --> 32:58.892
And He said, “There have been more than one lakh walis (means realized souls) before.”

32:59.000 --> 33:05.892
But still Muslims are some sort of a unique people

33:06.000 --> 33:09.892
because they call themselves Muslims. Whether they drink, doesn’t matter;

33:10.000 --> 33:12.892
whether they womanize, doesn’t matter;

33:13.000 --> 33:14.892
they kill people, doesn’t matter.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.892
They are running after few things which are forbidden to them,

33:19.000 --> 33:20.892
but still they are Muslims.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.892
Same with the Christians.

33:23.000 --> 33:33.892
Difficult to find a man who is a real Christian, who follows Christ, before realization.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.892
After realization, of course, we are different,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.892
but for that you have to cross this Agnya.

33:40.000 --> 33:47.892
Agnya also is there which has to control your ego.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.892
Christ in His lifetime showed how ego works.

33:53.000 --> 34:00.892
His own crucifixion itself shows how Christ,

34:01.000 --> 34:05.892
such a great incarnation of purity, was crucified;

34:06.000 --> 34:10.892
shows what people are like,

34:11.000 --> 34:16.892
what they did to Him, how He was troubled

34:17.000 --> 34:19.892
and tortured by these stupid people

34:20.000 --> 34:24.892
and then how He was crucified by the government.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.892
In the beginning there were many Sahaja Yogis, I should say, they were called as Gnostics.

34:32.000 --> 34:39.892
"Gna” in Sanskrit means knowledge, who had the knowledge about self.

34:40.000 --> 34:45.892
Christ has said, “Thou shalt.” He has said that “Know thyself.”

34:46.000 --> 34:49.892
"You have to knock at the door,” meaning

34:50.000 --> 34:52.892
you must have Shuddha Iccha, otherwise it won’t work out.

34:53.000 --> 34:58.892
Nobody can force you. He controls the ego.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.892
He’s the One who gives you the balance,

35:06.000 --> 35:09.892
but if you go to the West you know they are nothing

35:10.000 --> 35:14.892
but some sort of a stupid donkey-like ego.

35:17.000 --> 35:24.892
The way they talk, the way they behave towards each other, it’s a big eye opener.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.892
They are developed. How are they developed? God knows.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.892
Oh, they are very advanced, sophisticated, this, that.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.892
With this Agnya catching. Christ has said in His Lord’s Prayer:

35:43.000 --> 35:51.892
“Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trespass against us.”

35:52.000 --> 35:56.892
What a big thing to say, but one thing I have seen in the West,

35:57.000 --> 35:58.892
people don’t know how to forgive.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.892
They are full of hatred

36:05.000 --> 36:12.892
and they cannot ask forgiveness because they are full of terrible ego.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.892
Though they will feel guilty, but they will never ask for forgiveness.

36:18.000 --> 36:23.892
They’ll never say that “Oh God, forgive me for what I have done. ”

36:24.000 --> 36:26.892
This is so common now.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.892
For example the Nazis, they killed so many people

36:31.000 --> 36:36.892
and still you find these Neo-Nazis coming up, even in Italy.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.892
They are not ashamed as to what they have done.

36:45.000 --> 36:51.892
This happens because there is no really connection with Christ.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.892
Firstly, if you have connection with Christ,

36:56.000 --> 37:00.892
your ego has to be finished, absolutely.

37:01.000 --> 37:07.892
And this ego which comes to you from various sources is a myth. Is a myth.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.892
With this ego people try to befool others and show off.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.892
Like there’s a story of Shahpesh- I don’t know if you have read about him.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.892
He came to a king and told him that “I’m a great architect,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.892
and I’ll build a big palace for you, ”and this and that.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.892
The way he posed, the king believed him.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.892
He said, “All right. Go ahead, I’ll send you so much money. ”

37:36.000 --> 37:42.892
Now with this whole attitude and the way he was describing himself,

37:43.000 --> 37:46.892
with his all his gestures full of such ego

37:47.000 --> 37:53.892
that this king also got completely lost. He gave him lots of money.

37:54.000 --> 37:59.892
And in six months' time he came back, said, “I’ve built your palace, come and have a look.”

38:00.000 --> 38:05.892
So he went there, he saw it was just the same land, there was no palace, nothing.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.892
So the king thought something gone wrong with him or what?

38:09.000 --> 38:14.892
He was again looking and looking, and what does he find? He finds there was no palace, nothing.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.892
Immediately he realized that his ego has befooled him.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.892
So the king was very clever that way, he realized it.

38:26.000 --> 38:31.892
So he started saying, “See this is the main road by which we’ll go, and there’s the palace.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.892
Now the door opens. ”Nothing there.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.892
It's all just a story. “And now here is your throne,

38:39.000 --> 38:40.892
and please be seated on it.”

38:41.000 --> 38:43.892
He said, “First you sit.”

38:44.000 --> 38:53.892
He made this Shahpesh to sit on a throne which never existed. Now imagine, it was very painful.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.892
He said, “You see, I want to see you sitting there, I like it.”

38:59.000 --> 39:00.892
For one hour he made him sit.

39:01.000 --> 39:06.892
For two hours he made him sit. Ultimately Shahpesh fell at his feet and he said,

39:07.000 --> 39:13.892
“Sir, I’m sorry, there is no palace, there is no throne, nothing of the kind,”

39:14.000 --> 39:17.892
but the king had lost all his money so he imprisoned him,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.892
he was beaten up and did all kinds of things.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.892
So this is the end of false ideas about oneself.

39:27.000 --> 39:33.892
This ego can take you to such a heights of stupidity.

39:37.000 --> 39:43.892
And the culture where it is pampered is the worst culture.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.892
I’ve seen advertisements where they say,

39:47.000 --> 39:53.892
"You must smoke this particular cigarette because it expresses your ego."

39:56.000 --> 40:07.892
But according to Indian culture, to express your ego is absolutely something very stupid.

40:08.000 --> 40:13.892
People laugh at such a person, the one who tries to show his ego.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.892
In Marathi language, if somebody is trying to show off,

40:19.000 --> 40:24.892
then they say he is climbing on a small, little shrub of channa.

40:27.000 --> 40:33.892
It’s the whole system is such so nobody can develop any ego.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.892
If they develop, then they are corrected.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.892
Specially in Maharashtra, it’s very difficult to develop any ego.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.892
As soon as you start talking big about yourself, immediately you are punctured.

40:51.000 --> 41:02.892
But in the north, of course, a little bit allowed I think, and people do talk big.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.892
We have great politicians who talk very big,

41:06.000 --> 41:11.892
“I’m going to do this; I’m going to do that. We’re going to have this project, that project, this, that.”

41:12.000 --> 41:15.892
One thing: Christ never said such a thing, never He talked.

41:16.000 --> 41:25.892
What, if you see His sermons, is so deep and so enlightening.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.892
Despite the effort of this gentleman Mister Paul,

41:30.000 --> 41:33.892
you see Christ talking to people,

41:34.000 --> 41:42.892
giving them different ways of explanation: what happens after realization,

41:43.000 --> 41:46.892
how a seed is sprouted, and how it can get spoilt.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.892
And very beautifully He explained to people.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.892
I think it didn't have much effect at that time.

41:56.000 --> 42:16.892
0

42:17.000 --> 42:20.892
His life was so charming and so beautiful.

42:23.000 --> 42:28.892
Like a shooting star, He came on this earth,

42:29.000 --> 42:37.892
but He left such a remarkable impression on people.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.892
His crucifixion was a part of the game

42:41.000 --> 42:46.892
because He had to make the way in the Agnya Chakra,

42:47.000 --> 42:50.892
to cross the Agnya Chakra He was crucified;

42:51.000 --> 42:55.892
but His message is not crucifixion.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.892
People wear the cross and I feel very hurt about it.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.892
He crucified Himself, but that’s not the message,

43:05.000 --> 43:12.892
that’s not you should celebrate that He crucified. There are people who celebrate it.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.892
You have to celebrate His resurrection,

43:17.000 --> 43:23.892
resurrection because human beings are to be resurrected.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.892
In Sahaja Yoga nobody is crucified

43:27.000 --> 43:31.892
and is resurrected because of one crucifixion of Christ.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.892
That was enough. That was sufficient.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.892
You can’t carry the cross on your shoulder; don’t have to.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.892
He has carried for you, He’s done everything for you.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.892
He said also that He died for all the sinners, is a fact. If

43:48.000 --> 43:53.892
He had not done that, it would have been difficult to open your Agnyas,

43:54.000 --> 43:57.892
because two problems, I told you, this conditioning and ego.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.892
His crucifixion has helped

44:04.000 --> 44:12.892
the loosening of these two horrible capacities of human being.

44:16.000 --> 44:27.892
His life is to be understood in a very, very deep sense.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.892
But if you are like a journalist, you can say,

44:33.000 --> 44:40.892
“Why did He crucify Himself? If He was God why did He get crucified?”

44:42.000 --> 44:44.892
Now the question is why He got crucified,

44:45.000 --> 44:49.892
is how to tell these journalists who don’t know anything about chakras.

44:50.000 --> 44:58.892
Because it was the era or the time of tapasya, of sacrifice, and so

44:59.000 --> 45:10.892
then all these three persons - Buddha, Mahavira and Christ - went into complete renunciation.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.892
They led a life of a great tapasvis.

45:20.000 --> 45:25.892
They did it for us, not for themselves. They didn’t need it.

45:26.000 --> 45:32.892
They didn’t want it; but they had do it to cleanse us,

45:33.000 --> 45:43.892
to give us a proper Medha as they call it this Ekadesha Rudras,

45:44.000 --> 45:46.892
you see, to be cleared out;

45:47.000 --> 45:53.892
and they have sacrificed their lives, they have sacrificed all the pleasures of life.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.892
For them it was not a sacrifice, it is just a kind of a life they wanted to have.

46:00.000 --> 46:07.892
For such people there’s no question of sacrifice, but is a question of doing something

46:08.000 --> 46:14.892
that would help to open the chakras of the people in the future.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.892
Without them we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga.

46:18.000 --> 46:27.892
It was essential for these people to cleanse for us these three chakras,

46:28.000 --> 46:32.892
part of the one Chakra of Christ.

46:35.000 --> 46:45.892
All this they have worked out, and that's why today Sahaja Yoga is so beautifully created,

46:46.000 --> 46:52.892
so beautifully spreading, is working out. We have to thank them very much.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.892
Of course all other incarnations also have helped,

46:56.000 --> 47:01.892
you can see, Vishuddhi, then also heart, and all these - right heart, left heart -

47:02.000 --> 47:06.892
all these angels as they are called in the Bible,

47:07.000 --> 47:09.892
have helped us to cross over.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.892
All these incarnations are responsible in our evolutionary process

47:15.000 --> 47:18.892
to create these ladders for us to move.

47:21.000 --> 47:28.892
So, ultimately you reach the state of Tapah

47:29.000 --> 47:35.892
on the sixth center and then in the state of truth, Satya.

47:36.000 --> 47:41.892
Then the truth comes to you through Sahaja Yoga, in the brain,

47:42.000 --> 47:46.892
in the limbic area when the Kundalini enters, She puts light there,

47:47.000 --> 47:51.892
She creates enlightened personalities

47:52.000 --> 47:57.892
and then She joins this all-pervading power of divine love,

47:58.000 --> 48:06.892
and with this divine love you are completely changed and transformed.

48:09.000 --> 48:17.892
So their contribution to the ascent of human beings has been great,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.892
and that of Christ has been the greatest.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.892
And when we say we have to follow Christ,

48:27.000 --> 48:32.892
we should try to see how much detachment we have.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.892
They say His brothers and sisters, or somebody came to see Him.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.892
They say He had brothers. So He said, “Who are My brothers?

48:45.000 --> 48:48.892
These are My brothers, these are My relations.”

48:49.000 --> 48:54.892
Gyaneshwara said the same thing, that "They will become your relations

48:55.000 --> 49:00.892
[Marathi, sounds like SO ERIKO, TE CHEEZ SO ERIKO TE]. They will be your relations,

49:01.000 --> 49:06.892
they'll be your brothers and sisters, and not those who are not enlightened.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.892
They are not your relations because they don’t understand you.

49:10.000 --> 49:17.892
They don’t have entry into the Kingdom of God,

49:18.000 --> 49:30.892
so they are not your relations." In His lifetime, He led a life of a person who was very simple.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.892
Didn’t bother about clothes or anything.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.892
All the conditioning of the worldly things were not His,

49:38.000 --> 49:44.892
but He was not shameless type of a person who would accept any kind of a nudity and this and that.

49:45.000 --> 49:50.892
Even about Mahavira there’s a big misconcept.

49:51.000 --> 49:59.892
He was once praying in a garden where there were lots of bushes, we call them kunjas,

50:00.000 --> 50:06.892
and in the bush His cloth, which was only one cloth He was putting on, was caught up.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.892
So He cut half of it and was covering Himself.

50:10.000 --> 50:17.892
Shri Krishna went to test Him, and He said that “I have nothing, I am just nude,

50:18.000 --> 50:24.892
so why don’t you give Me your cloth? Because, after all, You are a king.”

50:25.000 --> 50:34.892
So He took out his cloth and gave it to Shri Krishna, and got some leaves to cover Himself

50:35.000 --> 50:38.892
and He was in His own garden, and went into His own palace.

50:39.000 --> 50:46.892
Now, if you see the Jains, they make everything so horrible and insult Him all the time.

50:47.000 --> 50:54.892
Most of the people who follow all these great incarnations really all the time insult them.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.892
They don’t follow, they insult, and by their behavior, you see,

51:02.000 --> 51:06.892
we form such a bad opinion of all these people.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.892
I met one gentleman in Chicago. It was very cold.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.892
He was the head of the Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

51:16.000 --> 51:21.892
He was wearing a dhoti which was so thin, and he was shaking before Me.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.892
I said, “What’s the matter?”

51:26.000 --> 51:27.892
He said, “I’m feeling very cold.”

51:28.000 --> 51:29.892
I said, “Why are you wearing this dhoti?”

51:30.000 --> 51:34.892
He said, “My guru has told me if you wear a dhoti you will go to heaven.”

51:35.000 --> 51:40.892
I said, “Really? In India eighty percent people wear nothing but dhotis,

51:41.000 --> 51:43.892
are they all going to go to heaven? And many must have gone already,

51:44.000 --> 51:47.892
so where will you be?” Didn’t like it.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.892
Then I said, "Why you shaved your hair and put this …”we call it shindi, or in Hindi, bhodi.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.892
I don’t know what you call - pig’s tail here, pig’s tail?

51:59.000 --> 52:01.892
So he says, “It is because my guru told me

52:02.000 --> 52:07.892
that I must shave my head and have this kind of a thing.” So I think perhaps,

52:08.000 --> 52:13.892
maybe he will be tied to some rope and pulled in the heaven or something,

52:16.000 --> 52:27.892
I said. Kabira has said - Kabira was one of them who has tried to slash out all your conditioning.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.892
He said, “By shaving your head, if you are going to go to heaven,

52:36.000 --> 52:44.892
so what about the lamb which is shaved twice a year?

52:45.000 --> 52:48.892
He’ll be there earlier than you.”

52:49.000 --> 52:50.892
It’s a fact, it's so, such stupid things.

52:51.000 --> 52:56.892
And there are Jain sadhus who will remain absolutely nude and will pull their hair.

52:57.000 --> 53:04.892
Now by law they are allowed to go nude on the street, you know, insulting everyone.

53:05.000 --> 53:09.892
All such stupid things are happening in the name of religion -

53:10.000 --> 53:13.892
that, too, of Buddha, Mahavira, and Christ.

53:16.000 --> 53:23.892
They are the Ones who are trying to pull us away from rationality,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.892
because you have to cross this.

53:27.000 --> 53:36.892
All your limitations are because of this thinking, conditioning.

53:37.000 --> 53:43.892
We have to go beyond because by thinking, what do we do?

53:44.000 --> 53:48.892
We move in a linear way and then there’s no truth in it,

53:49.000 --> 53:54.892
so the whole thing comes back, boomerangs, and you are finished.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.892
We have to go beyond this mind; must understand this point is.

54:00.000 --> 54:05.892
Christ has done this so that we can go beyond our mind.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.892
If you don’t know how to go beyond mind,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.892
better sit down for your meditation, work it out.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.892
With this mind all kinds of things will come.

54:16.000 --> 54:22.892
Temper will come, intrigue will come, jealousies will come,

54:23.000 --> 54:33.892
all the six enemies that we have will come to us through this mind –

54:34.000 --> 54:39.892
means thinking, rationality. Everything can be rationalized.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.892
“Why did you murder your wife?”

54:44.000 --> 54:46.892
"Because I hated her. She was this, she was that, she was that.”

54:47.000 --> 54:49.892
But you cannot murder her.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.892
“Why did you murder your husband?” “Because of this, because of that.”

54:54.000 --> 55:01.892
Because of this mind we start doing things which are absolutely wrong, which are sinful,

55:02.000 --> 55:04.892
and then we try to rationalize it.

55:05.000 --> 55:10.892
Go against Agnya, go against reality,

55:11.000 --> 55:16.892
and then use your conditioning, use your, we can call,

55:17.000 --> 55:25.892
the ego to explain it, why you did it.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.892
All the time when we are doing like that we can never go beyond mind.

55:31.000 --> 55:36.892
We are so self-satisfied about ourselves. We think no end of ourselves.

55:37.000 --> 55:45.892
Now, how are we to get out of it?

55:46.000 --> 55:48.892
Introspection.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.892
But it’s very difficult because people are afraid of themselves.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.892
They don’t want to introspect, because once they start introspecting they

55:58.000 --> 56:04.892
will know how sinful they have been, how wrong things they have been doing.

56:05.000 --> 56:10.892
And then they’ll hate themselves. So they don’t want to introspect.

56:11.000 --> 56:17.892
But it’s very important that we should introspect.

56:18.000 --> 56:29.892
That introspection is very helpful for you to overcome these two hurdles of your Agnya Chakra.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.892
I’ve told you many a times: don’t argue with anybody

56:37.000 --> 56:41.892
because the other fellow, he is asking for argument is the one has lots of ego,

56:42.000 --> 56:46.892
and that ego is acting on you.

56:47.000 --> 56:55.892
So action/reaction starts, and we develop a habit of reacting to everything.

56:56.000 --> 57:00.892
Specially in the West, I have seen they react to everything, everything.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.892
For example, now, this thing is spread out here, now they have nothing to do.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.892
“But they could have had better, why is it so thin?”

57:09.000 --> 57:12.892
Well you pay for it now, you do it.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.892
They are walking across, they meet someone. "See, see this man.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.892
What sort of a person he is?”

57:20.000 --> 57:23.892
If there’s a beggar, then they’ll start criticizing.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.892
They'll criticize the government; they’ll criticize everyone.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.892
What about yourself?

57:30.000 --> 57:34.892
Instead of that why don’t you start doing something about it?

57:35.000 --> 57:40.892
If you can’t help it, if you are not going to do anything about it, why react?

57:41.000 --> 57:44.892
And this is the worst habit we have developed is to react,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.892
and we think we have every right to react.

57:48.000 --> 57:56.892
You have, but this right is self-destructive.

57:57.000 --> 58:01.892
To react on everything is not proper.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.892
You have no authority to react. It is to that extent.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.892
You have to just witness, witness the whole thing.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.892
Once you start witnessing,

58:15.000 --> 58:21.892
you’ll be amazed that you will start seeing the play, play of the maya,

58:22.000 --> 58:26.892
as they call it, and you will see where you stand with it.

58:27.000 --> 58:31.892
Witnessing should be developed. All the time, witness.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.892
Am I witnessing?

58:35.000 --> 58:37.892
Many people say that I have very good memory

58:38.000 --> 58:42.892
because I am all the time witnessing.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.892
Everything is recorded within Me like a picture.

58:48.000 --> 58:52.892
And then, when I have to say something, I have to correct something,

58:53.000 --> 58:57.892
all that I have witnessed comes to help Me.

59:00.000 --> 59:05.892
First of all, we should not react, react to anything.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.892
Some people are attached, say, to money.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.892
They’ll react, they’ll not give any money,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.892
they’ll keep all the money with themselves.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.892
In Sahaja Yoga also it happens.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.892
I’ve seen people who are very, very miserly about money.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.892
Another ones are who try to please others,

59:29.000 --> 59:32.892
then they’ll waste their money on lavish things for nothing at all.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.892
There’s no need to waste.

59:38.000 --> 59:46.892
Reaction can come through anything. Seeing something you can react

59:47.000 --> 59:51.892
and you become so engrossed with it that you don’t realize

59:52.000 --> 59:57.892
that you are wasting all your brain energy on nonsensical things.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:06.892
This reaction comes when you have lost complete sense of judgment.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.892
You don’t know what you are losing, what you are gaining by this kind of reaction.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:23.892
And this reaction is going to destroy your inner being completely,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.892
because all the time you are here and you are there, and you’re there, and you are there,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.892
and you are nowhere here.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.892
If you are a very criticizing type of a person, try to stop it completely. Criticize yourself,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.892
direct that energy towards yourself. "Who am I to criticize others?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.892
Who am I to react to anything?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:58.892
”Put a challenge to yourself, and you will see that your ego will subside.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.892
One day somebody came and told Me that

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.892
“Mother I feel so angry, I feel like beating everyone.”

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.892
I said, “All right, do one thing. Take a chappel and hit on your head. Finished.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.892
That’s the only way you can get rid of this habit that you want to beat others.”

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.892
Didn’t like it much, but I think by that he is improved.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:39.892
Now, conditioning also should be seen. “Am I a conditioned person?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.892
If my conditioning is there, then is it a good conditioning or a bad conditioning?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.892
“At least you should have good conditioning.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.892
But even that, to an extreme if you go,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.892
you can create a problem for yourself and for others.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.892
Most of these rituals and things started as a good conditioning.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:10.892
Then it became like a trap, and they could not get out of it.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.892
It’s a part and parcel of it, one has to accept.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.892
Then what should we do?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:27.892
We should not react. Just see the drama and you’ll be surprised,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.892
without paying anything, without going to any theatre, every moment you can see the drama going on before you,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.892
which is so enjoyable, whether it is absurd, whether it is ridiculous,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:51.892
whether it is a sort of a - as you see in the films, you see, beating somebody and all that,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.892
you just see it and you do not react.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.892
Anything that you think is very perverse, ugly, immoral - don’t see, finished, gone.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.892
So don’t tax your mind, because in the mind that we call it, so-called mind,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:26.892
it's actually the Agnya Chakra in the center of your optic chiasma.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.892
Just imagine. What a central place it has!

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.892
And any disturbance to your Agnya, what it can do to your brain

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.892
which is nothing but a lump of fat.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.892
So how this Agnya can affect you,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.892
and how it works and creates perverted images, that is to be really seen.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:03.892
Conditionings, also you have seen, people are mentally so upset and so degenerated.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.892
But the pure nature of Christ is innocence, you know that. He's Shri Ganesha.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.892
Shri Ganesha is an eternal Child.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.892
Christ is also complete innocence because He doesn’t react,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.892
because He is not conditioned.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.892
Children are not conditioned so much as we are.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.892
If you talk to children, if you speak to them,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.892
you’ll be amazed how innocent they are and how innocently they talk.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.892
Once My granddaughter asked Me, “What do You think of the poor children of the tiger?”

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.892
I said, “Why?”

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:06.892
“You know their father tells them that ‘You eat human beings,’ and what can they do?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.892
They have to eat human beings after all.” You see, so innocent.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.892
So I told her that they are under a complete control of God.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.892
Whatever they are doing, they are not going to be held responsible.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.892
It’s only for human beings

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.892
that God has given this freedom.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.892
It’s only human beings who can react in this manner.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.892
So for animals it is, they are pashus,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.892
means they are completely under the control of the God Almighty.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.892
So they are swabhavas, everything, a serpent will be a serpent,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.892
and a tiger will be a tiger, and they will say a lion will be a lion.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.892
But human being can be a serpent, at the same time could be a scorpion,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.892
could be a lion, could be anything,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.892
you know suddenly you find a small little bug-like man coming up like a lion roaring at you,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.892
and you say, “From where does this come, this cannon?”

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.892
It is so. You don’t know which way they will come,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.892
and which way the camel will sit. You can’t say.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.892
So this reaction of human beings comes

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.892
because he is not in connection with the Divine.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.892
When he is in the connection with the Divine,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.892
he sees the drama, and he leaves everything to Divine.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.892
He can solve all his problem by just one bandhan.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.892
He can solve all the problems just by a bandhan.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.892
But he should be in full connection with the Divine.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:26.892
It works, it works. It does work. This is not the time when Christ came on this earth.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:37.892
This is the time where this Paramchaitanya has gone into action – activated,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.892
is working out everything.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.892
Now they asked Me about this Shri Ganesha, whether Shri Ganesha drank milk or not.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.892
I said, “Anything possible.”

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.892
These days this Paramachaitanya is doing such things, unbelievable things,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.892
which we cannot understand, everything is a chamatkar. So it’s possible.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.892
Ganeshas, I’ve never heard of Ganesha liking milk so much,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.892
but maybe for the little rat He might be taking. Can’t say.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.892
“But why did Shiva drink?”

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.892
I said, “Let it be, let Shiva wants to drink, let Him have milk.”

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.892
Actually we have too much milk production,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.892
so They must be wanting to consume some.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.892
But it’s just a way at looking at things that, you see,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.892
when everything is done by this Paramchaitanya.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.892
They are doing such wonderful things,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.892
I mean, I never asked Them to do anything.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.892
But now, for example, in Brisbane when I was there,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.892
I was sleeping in the ashram, and a rainbow appeared.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.892
Of course I like paintings very much, of Raphael specially,

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.892
because he has drawn the Mother’s face,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.892
and the Child’s face so exactly,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.892
expressing the feeling of mother and the child.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.892
And imagine, that picture appears in the sky,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.892
and I didn’t tell them to show that Raphael.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.892
When I was sleeping I was not even going to look at it.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.892
But at this time, the halo that was on the back side of Mary comes upon the head.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.892
Means Raphael himself did it, or, I don’t know. How can I explain?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.892
This Paramchaitanya is doing all kinds of things,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.892
and it does all this just to convince you about Sahaja Yoga.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.892
Because even now there are many who are supposed to be very rational, intelligent,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.892
educated, who don’t want to accept.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.892
After all, if there is a divine power, if there is something like  that and is active,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.892
how can you challenge it?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.892
How can you say no to it?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:13.892
Because the powers are unlimited, it has gone into every atom and every molecule.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.892
It doesn’t do tricks, like moving this from there to there,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:29.892
but what it does is to do something which is absolutely impossible.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.892
It is doing.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:43.892
So for us to believe in this activated Paramchaitanya

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.892
is the only solution.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.892
So you leave it in the ocean of bliss,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.892
and let this great power handle all these situations.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.892
Don’t react yourself.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.892
Which is so efficient, so quick, so fast, moves all over, understands everything,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.892
and it loves you and respects you because you are Sahaja Yogis.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.892
This is what it is today: we should know at the time when we are celebrating Christmas

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:27.892
that what we are celebrating is really our own ascent, our own achievements,

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.892
our own lofty heights which we have achieved and which we have to achieve.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.892
We should have only aspirations as far as our spiritual side is concerned.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.892
All aspirations should be left to this Paramchaitanya,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.892
“You look after that.”

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.892
And the more you become,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:01.892
the more you develop this non-reacting attitude through your proper Agnya.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:09.892
Not anger, not silence, but a very pleasant temperament.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.892
That means people think that I have told you not to speak. No, no, you must speak.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.892
You must talk to people, you must laugh, you must enjoy;

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.892
but all this should be full of joyous feelings.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:33.892
That’s what they say that Christmas is for a very joyous atmosphere.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.892
So they can’t do that way so they drink. I mean, after all,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.892
you must give them benefit of doubt also that why do they drink?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.892
They think by drinking they will become joyous.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.892
Now our understanding about ourselves has to be very clear-cut.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.892
Specially, people don’t meditate.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.892
They just don’t meditate. They don’t want to grow.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.892
They are Sahaja Yogis but they don’t meditate. It’s very surprising,

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.892
I can make out who meditates, who does not, because there is no depth.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.892
They want to have this, they want to have that, is all right, but what about meditation?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.892
If you don’t meditate, your Agnya will be completely covered with thoughts,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.892
and you’ll be lost. So you have to meditate.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.892
If you don’t meditate, I also suffer.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.892
If you have no aspirations in Sahaja Yoga it's better to leave,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.892
because you are like seeds which are sprouted and which will be wasted.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:57.892
Some people are here because they want some sort of a platform, some publicity.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.892
Some are here who want money, to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.892
There are some who want to have a kind of a communication,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.892
to go round the whole world without paying a single pai.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:19.892
All such people are of no use to themselves.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.892
Now here you have the complete wealth.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:36.892
All that celestial wealth is before you, and you are not going to accept it,

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.892
you are not going to drown into it. What should we say?

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.892
It’s not very sensible to do.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.892
As I said, you don’t have to crucify yourself, you don’t have to give up anything,

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.892
you don’t have to live like Christ had to live or be born in the manger.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.892
All that’s done for you already. Now come along.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:09.892
But if you are coming in the darbar of the Divine, then be worth it.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:10.892
You should be worth it.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.892
And you’ll be surprised, all your problems will be solved.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:22.892
Your self-respect will be maintained. So many things have happened like that,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.892
but if you have no self-respect, you don’t respect your Realization,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:34.892
you are not deeply involved as to your own ascent and the help to others,

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.892
it will not work out.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.892
I’m here to tell you all these things which Christ could not tell.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.892
I had to fulfil what  He wanted to say.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.892
All those things I am saying to you. It has already worked,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.892
you all have got Realization,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.892
but develop respect for yourself as Sahaja yogis.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.892
Don’t have funny ideas about yourself.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.892
Just know you are a Sahaja yogi and a Sahaja yogini.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.892
That’s what is needed for a person if he is today celebrating the birth of Christ.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:24.892
He came on this Earth who was actually Christ, full of innocence,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:34.892
who was the One who came as the embodiment of Shri Ganesha.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.892
I have given the proof of it to you, how the carbon atom looks like,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.892
and by which I have proved that Christ is the Alpha and Omega,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.892
while He is made out of Omkara and Swastika.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.892
All this we have experimented. We have found it. It’s there.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:06.892
With all this, what is the greatest achievement is to respect your innocence.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.892
Respect your innocence.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.892
This is what is to be asked for today: be innocent,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.892
and God looks after all the innocent people.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.892
Don’t worry, don’t have to worry. I’ve seen children falling for seven storeys,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.892
nothing happens to them.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.892
They are perfectly all right. How? Who looks after them? Angels.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.892
You have seen photographs of angels around you.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.892
So try to be simple, innocent, not reactive,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:51.892
and keep quiet and peaceful because here we are talking about the global transformation

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.892
where people will find their peace in their heart

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:04.892
and will establish a new world of peace, joy and spirituality.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.892
May God bless you all!
