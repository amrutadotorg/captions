WEBVTT

00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:09.395
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:13.428 --> 00:00:20.448
Truth is everlasting and eternal
in its place.

00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:31.687
We cannot change it, nor can
we increase it.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:39.486
What is, will remain, it was that,
and will be that.

00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:49.673
Truth cannot be defined because

00:00:49.673 --> 00:00:57.183
unless we experience the Truth,
we cannot understand it.

00:01:00.773 --> 00:01:12.143
And those who have not sought the Truth
and those who seek only falsehood,

00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:17.171
they cannot even understand the Truth.

00:01:19.283 --> 00:01:28.513
But Truth is a very small, sparkling,
special, wonderful thing.

00:01:29.713 --> 00:01:42.393
The Truth is that we are all the Spirit.
We are not this body, intellect,
mind, ego, etc. but the Eternal Spirit.

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:58.141
I have found a big difference between
the Indian culture or should say the
Eastern culture and the Western culture.

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:10.366
Those who are Westerners may not even
be so aware of the Spirit.

00:02:10.858 --> 00:02:19.408
Although they believe in Jesus Christ
and Jesus Christ was born in Asia.

00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:33.514
The total perception, or the total attention of
those people, is drawn towards perishable things,
which in a moment, (UNCLEAR).

00:02:33.728 --> 00:02:42.438
But if one talks to the people of the
East, where there have been great
knowers of the principles of Vedas,

00:02:42.982 --> 00:02:52.172
seers, sages, saints, incarnations,
all of them will say that

00:02:52.333 --> 00:03:00.163
man should seek only such eternal
things, which are imperishable.

00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:04.261
And that indestructible, eternal thing
is the Spirit.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:12.602
Unless man seeks those things,
he cannot know the Absolute Truth.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:22.193
You cannot know the Absolute Truth through
the intellect. That is why the question of
all the religions has arisen today.

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:29.573
When you apply your intellect to something,
then it goes in any direction.

00:03:29.844 --> 00:03:33.014
Every person thinks that only I am correct.

00:03:33.223 --> 00:03:41.513
The founders of every religion have
said the same thing, but their followers
think that only they are right.

00:03:42.048 --> 00:03:50.108
Similarly, in politics, some people
say that imperialism is right,

00:03:50.108 --> 00:03:55.666
Some say socialism(samvaad) is right, some
say communism is right.

00:03:55.666 --> 00:04:02.843
A number of these 'isms' and the very
meaning of these 'isms' is that it's
something we have created out of our intellect.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:11.420
If we have to rise above the intellect
and want to know the Truth,

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:19.823
whether or not we have any system for
it within us, has been discussed
in every religion.

00:04:20.325 --> 00:04:32.215
But in India, because our climate
was quite good and we could live
even in the forests,

00:04:32.953 --> 00:04:36.493
thus a lot of thought has been given
to this since times immemorial.

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:44.195
And the Sahaja Yoga I'm going to
explain to you today, is not something
new that I'm talking about.

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:52.189
The Nathpanthis in India also
knew about this.

00:04:52.557 --> 00:05:08.387
On one hand, attention was paid to
the Vedas, etc. and the word Ved
also comes from the word Vid.

00:05:08.387 --> 00:05:13.215
Vid means to know, but not to
know through the intellect.

00:05:13.215 --> 00:05:18.025
But knowing on your Central Nervous
System, should be called Vid.

00:05:18.025 --> 00:05:24.767
Similarly, Buddha's bodh is also
to be aware. People say,
"Buddham Sharanam Gachhami."

00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:27.753
Means that the person who has attained
enlightenment is the Buddha.

00:05:27.938 --> 00:05:34.848
And all of His work was that first of
all you should attain Self-Realization.

00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:41.268
After that, in another thing,
there is a great deal of devotion
in our country.

00:05:41.268 --> 00:05:48.375
Even those who are in devotion,
there's Krishna, so even when
Krishna induced Gita,

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:55.335
so primarily, when people worship
Krishna, they still do it blindly.

00:05:55.368 --> 00:06:09.098
Krishna has explained very well in
the Gita, but we have not been able
to read what is deep within It.

00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:17.511
For example, firstly He advised to become
Sthithapragya (a person of steady state
of consciousness). This means that you
should become a Sahaja Yogi.

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:23.818
But how does that happen? So He said,
'Now attain knowledge.'

00:06:23.818 --> 00:06:29.538
Meaning that we should have knowledge
about our Central Nervous system.

00:06:29.538 --> 00:06:35.368
Just as we can feel hot and cold, similarly
we can understand sin and virtue.

00:06:35.564 --> 00:06:42.954
We can find out who is good, who is bad,
who is important and who is genuine/truthful.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:53.770
The second thing He said was,
"Whatever deed you do, leave it
to God." We just cannot do this.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:00.435
We can say like this for ourselves,
'Whatever actions we perform, we
leave them to God.'

00:07:00.435 --> 00:07:06.423
But this is not possible because
whatever work a person does,
there are two blessings in it.

00:07:06.423 --> 00:07:10.644
Even a father will say,
"I worked for my son."

00:07:10.644 --> 00:07:14.890
The mother will say, "I did this(spoke) for
my son, I did this for my daughter."

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.101
A sense of doer-ship arises in
everyone, that I am the doer,
I am the one who does it.

00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:23.001
But when He said, 'You do the
action and leave it at My feet,'

00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:27.465
it meant that you should not feel
you are doing something, and
this can only happen

00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:32.397
when you become a tool in the hands
of God, become His instrument.

00:07:32.397 --> 00:07:38.242
Unless this happens, you cannot become
akarmi(feeling you are not the doer).

00:07:38.242 --> 00:07:40.732
So He said, let people try;

00:07:40.732 --> 00:07:43.780
When they will be tired, they will
take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:51.808
The third thing he said, that too
very beautifully, is that, "You
give Me flowers, fruits, water."

00:07:51.808 --> 00:07:56.970
Whatever you offer Me, whether it's
flowers, fruit, or water, I'll accept it.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:05.413
But while giving, He has said in a very
(diplomatic) manner, that while giving,
your devotion should be matchless.

00:08:05.413 --> 00:08:09.655
Now the whole play is based on the word
'Ananya', that too is Krishna's playfulness.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.750
Ananya means when there is not the other.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:20.818
That can only happen when you are
united with the Supreme Being,
when you are one with Him.

00:08:20.818 --> 00:08:29.216
And it is also written everywhere
that the Power of God, the Power
of His love,

00:08:29.216 --> 00:08:37.130
moves throughout the world and
through It many tasks are accomplished
– it is written like this.

00:08:37.221 --> 00:08:41.561
It is also written that we can
have a connection with that Power.

00:08:43.108 --> 00:08:49.580
But if we doubt them, and think
that they're all lying,

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:54.173
then My opinion is that we
have closed our brains.

00:08:54.173 --> 00:08:58.400
Whatever is written in these
scriptures is absolutely true.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:06.380
But because our subtle vision
is not yet open, that's why we
misunderstand it.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.522
That is why Kabir says, "How can I
explain, the whole world is blind?"

00:09:11.957 --> 00:09:15.987
Even those who seek the Truth
are deeply steeped in falsehood.

00:09:15.987 --> 00:09:23.650
And that's why today people are standing up
against religion, saying that religion is a
very bad thing and that religion causes harm.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:29.175
All the religions that humans have
created are based on the level of
intellect, not on the level of truth.

00:09:29.175 --> 00:09:36.871
One of its identification is that,
whether one's a Hindu, Muslim,
Christian, or whatever,

00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:41.761
they have no thought for whatever
sin they are committing.

00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:45.261
A person of any caste can commit
sin, why is that so?

00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:51.102
If he is in a caste and says that,
"I am so and so, I belong to this
religion, I belong to that religion,"

00:09:51.102 --> 00:09:55.969
then, everyone commits sins. This
means that this truth has not
been awakened within them.

00:09:55.969 --> 00:10:00.787
When this truth awakens within a
person that, "I am a religious man,"

00:10:00.787 --> 00:10:03.640
and what is called righteousness in English

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.988
If that thing has happened within me,
then he can never do anything wrong.

00:10:09.988 --> 00:10:18.616
So this must be understood that this
religion which has been described
must manifest within us.

00:10:18.616 --> 00:10:23.387
Its effect must come from there.
That is why religion is in such
a predicament today.

00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:27.444
You are seeing that in every religion
there is nothing except fighting
amongst themselves.

00:10:27.444 --> 00:10:31.169
Religious people are not seen doing
any auspicious work these days.

00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:36.755
And whatever good deeds they do, they
do so in order to somehow divide
religion and then fights start again.

00:10:36.755 --> 00:10:42.310
Either you will fight amongst yourselves
or you are making the fights of two
religions into ten religions.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.078
When fighting is the work of religion,
then it's better there is no religion.

00:10:45.757 --> 00:10:52.247
So when the children of today will
see that we are just fighting like
this in the name of religion,

00:10:52.391 --> 00:10:58.531
and out of blind faith we are now running
towards it, then they will definitely
think that this is a wrong thing.

00:10:58.595 --> 00:11:05.255
Moreover, many superstitious people
are completely clutching all religions.

00:11:05.306 --> 00:11:10.386
And because of that entrapment,
the form of religion that we see
today appears distorted.

00:11:10.427 --> 00:11:15.357
Therefore, man moves away from God
and wonders if this is religion.

00:11:15.357 --> 00:11:20.314
Should this be called religion,
in which all kinds of vices,
wickedness, and money are,

00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:24.811
and all sorts of things are going on
like this. This can't be religion.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:36.356
But we should think — one thing is
very simple and straightforward -

00:11:37.953 --> 00:11:44.303
if we have a scriptural(shastriye)
approach, then we must open our minds

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:50.757
and we should think that these
great people who have been and
what they have said,

00:11:50.757 --> 00:11:54.796
if we reflect about it a little,
how would it be?

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:01.860
Now, regarding the knowledge of
Kundalini, I say that it is not
just Mine.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.608
This has been going on in our
country since times immemorial

00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:14.978
which through devotion and the Vedas,
was done and continued to be done by the
Nath sect, in a very secretive manner.

00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:19.450
As you might have heard that
Nachiketa went to King Janaka

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.623
and requested him to give him
self-realization.

00:12:22.627 --> 00:12:30.170
Our human condition at that time
was such that very few flowers
had blossomed.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.559
And only one or two flowers were
going to be formed into fruits.

00:12:34.647 --> 00:12:38.127
That's why only one or two people
got self-realization.

00:12:38.127 --> 00:12:45.532
And it is said in all the religions
that a time will come when many
people will attain this thing.

00:12:45.532 --> 00:12:49.607
Muhammad Sahib has said that, "When
the time of resurrection comes" -

00:12:49.607 --> 00:12:53.556
He used to call it Kiama -
"at that time your hands will speak"

00:12:53.556 --> 00:12:59.494
"and these hands will give evidence
against you" – this is written in
many ways in the Koran.

00:12:59.494 --> 00:13:02.302
Many things we don't understand because,

00:13:02.302 --> 00:13:07.118
because how can hands speak and how
can they bear witness against you?

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:12.400
Now, this power of Kundalini, about
which I am going to tell you,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:19.449
it's placed within you, it's fully
established in the triangular bone.

00:13:19.805 --> 00:13:27.595
And this is called Aasaas in the
language of Mohammad Sahab,

00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:31.740
this is what is called the Holy Ghost
in the language of Christ,

00:13:31.156 --> 00:13:36.666
and this is called Kundalini in
Sanskrit language.

00:13:37.185 --> 00:13:42.925
And that's how it's described in
Zen, and in every religion.

00:13:44.572 --> 00:13:50.412
Now, this Kundalini is called the
Holy Ghost, meaning it is a power,

00:13:50.485 --> 00:13:54.495
this is the Desire Power of God Almighty
which is reflected within us.

00:13:54.495 --> 00:13:59.387
And it is the Spirit which is the
reflection of God within us.

00:13:59.387 --> 00:14:03.729
Now, whatever I am saying, please
consider it as a concept.

00:14:03.729 --> 00:14:05.925
I have put forward a concept before you.

00:14:05.925 --> 00:14:11.219
Just like there is a hypothesis in Science,
I am presenting a hypothesis to you.

00:14:11.219 --> 00:14:18.399
Now, if you understand this concept
and can experience it,

00:14:18.567 --> 00:14:25.957
and if you're honest, you'll
surely say it's true, and then
it becomes a law/way of action.

00:14:26.374 --> 00:14:30.814
Now this Kundalini is seated
within us in the triangular bone,

00:14:30.814 --> 00:14:36.863
and this is ours, of each one of us,
personal, individual, separate Kundalini.

00:14:36.863 --> 00:14:42.966
and in it your past lives, this
life, everything is written.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:49.961
And She knows where you've strayed,
where you've stalled, what
mistakes you've made.

00:14:49.961 --> 00:14:57.607
And when this Kundalini awakens,
It pierces the six chakras, six

00:14:57.607 --> 00:15:07.850
the seventh chakra is beneath it,
and the seventh chakra controls
it. That, I should say,

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:14.297
if we call the lowest chakra the
first chakra, then the limbic area
which is in our head

00:15:14.297 --> 00:15:23.419
the limbic area which is in our brain,
is called Sahastrara, and

00:15:23.419 --> 00:15:28.264
it also opens this seventh chakra.
So if the first chakra is below

00:15:28.264 --> 00:15:34.266
then it penetrates the seventh chakra,
which is the limbic area in our head.

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:39.743
Now you will say, "Mother, why are You
talking about these old things in
modern times?"

00:15:39.743 --> 00:15:44.891
Because the modern times today,
which we think to be a big deal,
you'll be surprised

00:15:44.891 --> 00:15:52.553
that when we see abroad, we realize
that all together they are going
into a very big, ditch.

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:58.432
Some of you must have been there,
but I've been living there for years.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:04.145
Now you look at the situation there
– everyone has a household too.

00:16:04.475 --> 00:16:13.405
There's no concept of home and family
among the people there. Even that is
nothing. Most of the people there
have started taking drugs.

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:19.631
Even children there have started
taking drugs. Then there are many
dirty diseases there.

00:16:19.631 --> 00:16:28.757
In those countries where the Holy
Incarnation of Jesus Christ has
such an influence,

00:16:28.757 --> 00:16:32.915
seeing this there, the whole world
seemed like Anti-Christ

00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:36.847
How can they be said that they
follow Jesus Christ?

00:16:36.847 --> 00:16:41.576
Who even said in (UNCLEAR) that,
'Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.'

00:16:41.576 --> 00:16:49.474
Jesus Christ who says such a thing,
'There should be purity even in the eyes,'
why are these people doing like this?

00:16:49.605 --> 00:16:55.735
Similarly, we see that among Hindus,
when it is said that everyone has
a Spirit within them,

00:16:55.862 --> 00:17:00.892
So if everyone has a Spirit,
how are you creating castes etc.?

00:17:00.892 --> 00:17:04.462
And earlier, castes etc were also
based on the tasks done.

00:17:04.462 --> 00:17:09.259
And it is clearly stated in many
[UNCLEAR - this?] that the one who
knows the Brahma is a Brahmin.

00:17:09.259 --> 00:17:12.460
So nowadays, we can even keep a Brahmin
at our place to cook food.

00:17:12.494 --> 00:17:17.194
So, can he be a Brahmin? A Brahmin
is one who has known the Brahma.

00:17:17.194 --> 00:17:23.389
Similarly, in blind faith, man
has left caste, caste which is,

00:17:23.406 --> 00:17:29.166
it has been made in such a way that
instead of keeping it on the basis of work,
it has been made on the basis of caste.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:36.430
The reason why this has been done is
because the way you see it in the West

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.422
that people have suffered so much
loss and have had such a downfall,

00:17:40.422 --> 00:17:46.199
similarly, we see that even in the
Eastern countries there is great detriment
and we too are going towards a downfall.

00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:53.040
Even here we have many kinds of wickedness,
like the work of ghosts, sorcery etc.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.511
and many kinds of superstitions, then
the coming of gurus, and many gurus
have gone abroad.

00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:01.360
They have robbed many people,
taking money, all these pursuits
are going on.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.747
But one must know the Truth first, then
only can one recognize the falsehood.

00:18:05.747 --> 00:18:09.409
Unless you know the Truth, you
cannot recognize the untruth.

00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:13.815
So in order to know the Truth,
God has made a very beautiful
arrangement within us.

00:18:13.815 --> 00:18:19.758
This is God. His arrangement is very
well-organized and systematic.

00:18:19.758 --> 00:18:23.636
It is that, this Kundalini which is
sitting below in the triangular bone,

00:18:23.636 --> 00:18:28.898
simply by awakening It, It
pierces the Brahmarandhra,

00:18:28.898 --> 00:18:33.549
then your connection becomes one
with the All Pervading Power
spread throughout.

00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:40.974
Now you have a very strong proof of
this as well, a proof, whether there
is this Power in the Universe or not.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.350
Now you see that the height of a
human being reaches a certain limit.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:50.199
The height of a coconut tree goes
up to a limit.

00:18:50.199 --> 00:18:55.621
If there's some other tree, its
height reaches a certain limit.

00:18:55.621 --> 00:18:57.716
In this way if you look at the finer works,

00:18:57.716 --> 00:19:07.235
so if there's a child, then the mother of
that child, there will be a great similarity
between that child and the mother.

00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:14.280
The child of an Indian will be like
an Indian. Thousands of such acts
happen in this world.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:20.433
Or you think like this also,
that there's a seed, a mango
tree will grow from that seed.

00:19:20.433 --> 00:19:24.275
Many trees will grow from them,
but they will all be mango trees.

00:19:24.275 --> 00:19:31.645
Where does all this power come from,
where does all this arrangement come
from, where does it all get organized?

00:19:31.645 --> 00:19:37.398
All this arrangement is made by the
Power of God's love that is spread
throughout all the Universe.

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:41.891
Till today we have only used the
power of hatred. Even when we
practice religion(dharma),

00:19:41.891 --> 00:19:46.193
and even when we take the name of God,
we still use the power of hatred.

00:19:46.193 --> 00:19:49.703
We have never used the power
of love till date.

00:19:49.703 --> 00:19:59.140
So this Power of Love, which is
spread everywhere and has been
working since eternity,

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:06.793
being connected with it is Yoga.
The rest, standing on your head
and doing all sorts of exercises,

00:20:06.793 --> 00:20:10.794
and Dravidi Pranayama, these things
that are, are not yoga.

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:16.544
In reality Yoga is our connection with
the Almighty, or the All Pervading Power
that pervades this universe.

00:20:16.544 --> 00:20:21.154
Being connected is only, you can
say to be yoga.

00:20:21.189 --> 00:20:24.315
All of you are entitled to this yoga.

00:20:24.315 --> 00:20:31.268
Now Sahaja means, 'saha' means 'with you',
'ja' means 'born', this is Kundalini.

00:20:31.268 --> 00:20:38.911
And yoga means, what I told you that,
to be connected with the Power that
pervades this universe.

00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:44.938
This is your birthright because you
are in the form of a human being.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:52.321
Man is superior to all the things
created in the world.

00:20:52.321 --> 00:21:01.420
What is called the epitome of evolution,
and now it just needs to achieve one
last thing,

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:06.500
where the Kundalini awakens and pierces
to pass through the six chakras,

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:12.607
so they become united with God.
What happens as a result of that?

00:21:12.607 --> 00:21:14.944
People will ask this that,
what is the benefit of this?

00:21:14.944 --> 00:21:20.429
Firstly, you should know that you
cannot give any money in this.

00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:25.200
This is a living work, God is
living, and His power is living.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:31.112
This living act, the way you put
the seed into the mother's womb,
of Mother Earth,

00:21:31.112 --> 00:21:36.736
so it flourishes on its own, similarly
this Power also flourishes on its own.

00:21:36.736 --> 00:21:39.891
If you try to force it, it's
not going to happen.

00:21:39.891 --> 00:21:44.011
It's not about money in this,
that you give some money to
the Earth,

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:47.683
or you pay some money to that
seed – nothing.

00:21:47.683 --> 00:21:51.793
This is a living work, which we
call Sahaja, meaning spontaneous.

00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:58.589
And this process sparks by itself and
with its help the Kundalini gets awakened.

00:21:58.589 --> 00:22:04.621
And then you get this experience,
in which you can feel

00:22:04.621 --> 00:22:07.404
that cool breeze is blowing all around.

00:22:07.404 --> 00:22:12.191
This has also been described and said by
Adi Shankaracharya as 'Saleelam Saleelam'.

00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:15.186
And is spoken of as the 'Cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost' in the Bible.

00:22:15.186 --> 00:22:19.218
Everywhere it has been described,
you first be able to feel (UNCLEAR).

00:22:19.218 --> 00:22:24.006
And cool air should also come from
the Brahmarandhra on your head.

00:22:25.067 --> 00:22:29.287
Then you come to know that your
Brahmarandhra has been pierced.

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:35.418
Now, after that, you'll be surprised
that how so many things happen.

00:22:35.418 --> 00:22:38.040
That first of all you will be
overwhelmed with joy.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:45.523
But it becomes something special in you,
something special happens, by which
you get satisfaction.

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:51.441
Your illness gets cured. Many
incurable diseases,

00:22:51.441 --> 00:22:57.021
Cancer, blood cancer, and mellitus,
and various other diseases of the
world have been cured by it.

00:22:57.021 --> 00:23:05.246
Now this is not a matter of mesmerism.
Delhi University has seen and
understood this

00:23:05.246 --> 00:23:09.099
and they have introduced it in their
Medical College,

00:23:09.099 --> 00:23:14.533
so, three doctors have received their
M.D. in this. One, they have got in
physical fitness,

00:23:14.533 --> 00:23:22.322
and one has got on Psychosomatic diseases,
and one on your epilepsy.

00:23:23.191 --> 00:23:27.611
They have received their M.D. in
these three subjects.

00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:31.501
Means it has been proven that these
diseases are cured through Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:32.181 --> 00:23:36.971
And similarly today in London,
seven doctors are writing on this,

00:23:37.006 --> 00:23:39.364
that what all happens through Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:39.364 --> 00:23:46.416
Now you can't pay for it, you
can't demand anything for it,

00:23:46.416 --> 00:23:50.018
There is no guarantee for anyone.
Your Kundalini if awakened,

00:23:50.018 --> 00:23:54.375
then this is also your good deed from
your previous life, and you
[UNCLEAR – didn't understand?].

00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:58.437
But if someone says, "Mother, just
do it for me," then I can't do this.

00:23:58.437 --> 00:24:04.391
When it happens to you, it will
happen spontaneously, and if it
doesn't happen, it won't happen.

00:24:04.391 --> 00:24:09.733
Now, those people who are ill
with some disease, or those who
are very intellectual,

00:24:09.834 --> 00:24:15.534
live by their intelligence and either
those people who are always crying
and sad

00:24:15.534 --> 00:24:20.263
it takes time for such people's
Kundalini to be awakened. But
it hasn't happened yet

00:24:20.263 --> 00:24:25.525
that someone came to Me and theirs
didn't awaken, or they didn't
receive it from Me.

00:24:25.525 --> 00:24:30.707
After awakening, this connection, this
yoga of yours that has been achieved,

00:24:30.707 --> 00:24:33.300
has to be made permanent, it has
to be established.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:38.737
Until this thing settles down, till
then again and again this Kundalini
will keep falling down

00:24:38.737 --> 00:24:41.580
and it goes to such a place
where you have a problem.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:46.334
Because of this, sometimes it
can also happen that you become
sick again.

00:24:46.887 --> 00:24:53.857
There's no harm in telling you
that when our Mr.
.0Sanjeeva Reddy
came from America,

00:24:53.903 --> 00:24:59.853
so it was a coincidence that I had
gone to the airport in London.

00:24:59.853 --> 00:25:05.691
So his Mrs. told him that this is
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi – he
knew me as Mrs. Srivastava.

00:25:05.691 --> 00:25:10.505
So he said, "Okay," his wife said that,
"Do something to somewhat cure my husband,"

00:25:10.505 --> 00:25:15.136
"Because he's in a lot of agony,
he can't sleep, he has taken so
many pills, he is very restless."

00:25:15.136 --> 00:25:21.623
He had come after the operation. He must
have been something special, that he was
better in ten minutes, in ten minutes.

00:25:21.623 --> 00:25:25.545
And he was telling Me, "When I landed
(UNCLEAR - Roman?) at the airport,
then everyone started wondering"

00:25:25.545 --> 00:25:29.558
"whether my ghost had come down?
Everything was arranged there
for my cremation."

00:25:29.708 --> 00:25:38.178
But he didn't do Sahaja Yoga after that.
If he had practiced Sahaja Yoga, his
condition would have been alright.

00:25:38.178 --> 00:25:43.301
There are many such people, whose
names I could tell you, who are
very high class people,

00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:48.814
they have a big name, like your
Dada, Vasant Dada Patil. Sahaja
Yogis also cured him.

00:25:48.814 --> 00:25:54.097
Sahaja Yogis cured him, after that he
became quite well, then started moving
about, afterwards not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:54.246 --> 00:26:00.026
So it has to be stabilized. And if
you don't stabilize it,

00:26:00.026 --> 00:26:05.532
it is possible you become again a human
and might be troubled by this again.

00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:11.737
And we should also think that The
God Almighty, He too has a little
common sense,

00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:14.090
which is said to be, should have
common sense

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:20.661
that, why work hard for someone
who won't give light?

00:26:21.095 --> 00:26:28.869
We know that a lamp that doesn't
give light, we never fix it,
it's useless.

00:26:28.869 --> 00:26:33.989
Similarly, I see that even God's
attention turns away from such people,

00:26:33.989 --> 00:26:38.887
those who do not want to go deep
into it and do not want to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:38.887 --> 00:26:43.659
Because in Sahaja Yoga there is no
money involved, only blessings
and blessings.

00:26:43.659 --> 00:26:47.982
You don't have to leave your home,
you don't have to renounce anything,

00:26:47.982 --> 00:26:50.584
on the contrary, if an ascetic
comes, we have to tell him,

00:26:50.584 --> 00:26:54.574
to change his clothes and come here,
this renunciation is not going to work.

00:26:54.574 --> 00:26:59.052
This is to be found only in the household,
as told in the Nala-Damayanti narrative.

00:26:59.052 --> 00:27:04.783
That people living in households will
get all these things only in Kaliyuga.

00:27:04.783 --> 00:27:10.853
And this thing is only available to
those who live in households, but
it has many, many, many benefits.

00:27:10.853 --> 00:27:14.179
First of all, as I said, your
health improves.

00:27:14.407 --> 00:27:19.167
Your health improves.
You start to look younger.

00:27:19.167 --> 00:27:25.260
A lot of power is infused within you.
You can do a lot of things and you
don't get tired.

00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:28.491
And your intellect becomes sharp.

00:27:28.706 --> 00:27:38.256
Many children who were told in school,
"These children are of quite low
intelligence and they can't cope."

00:27:38.256 --> 00:27:42.638
Such children are coming first nowadays.
After coming to our Sahaja Yoga

00:27:42.638 --> 00:27:48.187
such children who had no hope of
passing even are now coming first.
Their intellect become sharp.

00:27:48.187 --> 00:27:53.436
Then there are artists who are musicians,
or anyone supposing

00:27:53.436 --> 00:27:58.225
those who are artists, a new art
emerges from them.

00:27:58.225 --> 00:28:03.516
People have had many experiences of this.
If you people talk to some artists, then
they will tell you.

00:28:03.516 --> 00:28:08.844
Like there are Amjad Ali and Bismillah
Khan Sahib, etc., they all will tell
you that when they,

00:28:08.844 --> 00:28:14.299
what would happen to them when they
started playing in front of Me?
What happened when they came into
Sahaja Yoga?

00:28:14.299 --> 00:28:17.530
In this way, many people are there
in whom there is a difference.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:23.266
But the thing is that a difference
comes in them and they move forward too

00:28:23.266 --> 00:28:25.889
but unless you hold on to anything
deeply,

00:28:25.889 --> 00:28:30.202
until then, neither are you of any
use to God nor to yourself.

00:28:30.253 --> 00:28:39.933
This greatly increases a person's
lifespan and man becomes more
religious by temperament.

00:28:39.933 --> 00:28:46.950
Religious in reality, not false, not
pretentious religiosity, real religiosity,
which is called righteousness,

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.996
that a person does not do anything
wrong that maybe harmful

00:28:49.996 --> 00:28:55.244
and he doesn't covet, and he also
(UNCLEAR) gets used to.

00:28:55.244 --> 00:29:00.166
By the awakening of the Lakshmi principle,
financial problems get solved.

00:29:00.166 --> 00:29:02.881
So many people's financial problems
were solved.

00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:07.215
My brother who is in India, "Ever
since I've been realized, my
condition is such,"

00:29:07.215 --> 00:29:12.426
"that I don't understand I'm getting
all the money of the world, what
can I say?"

00:29:12.602 --> 00:29:18.782
So those questions of yours are
also resolved. But you won't rise
more than necessary

00:29:18.782 --> 00:29:25.131
because I told you earlier that these
are perishable things, and all perishable
things are fine up to a point.

00:29:25.131 --> 00:29:30.335
When you cross that boundary, those
very things make you destructive.

00:29:30.335 --> 00:29:35.951
Therefore, till the limit you have
to grow you receive everything
up to that limit.

00:29:35.951 --> 00:29:40.977
And you are in satisfaction. After this,
the [UNCLEAR - guru?] element is very,
very loving.

00:29:41.267 --> 00:29:47.977
There is so much love, so much
forgiveness, that such a person
forgives every single mistake.

00:29:48.257 --> 00:29:54.145
And after forgiving, he gains insight

00:29:54.145 --> 00:29:58.943
as to with which person he should pick
a fight and with which he should not.

00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:02.026
Like I'll tell you about Jesus Christ

00:30:02.026 --> 00:30:08.267
that when people were pelting Mary
Magdalene with stones, He went
and stood before them.

00:30:08.363 --> 00:30:13.993
Now, Jesus Christ had no connection
with the business what was hers,

00:30:14.017 --> 00:30:16.947
He was a detached person, but
He stood up.

00:30:16.947 --> 00:30:21.476
He said, "Whosoever among you has
not sinned, let him throw a stone
at Me."

00:30:21.476 --> 00:30:26.594
This courage, this courage also,
because He was Himself the Spirit.

00:30:26.594 --> 00:30:31.244
Unless you become the Spirit, you do
not have the capability within you.

00:30:31.244 --> 00:30:38.020
Means, being equal to the meaning.
You don't only get to your own meaning,
and sometimes you went into that,

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.434
sometimes went to [UNCLEAR - Truth?],
sometimes folded hands in front of this,
sometimes folded hands in front of that.

00:30:41.434 --> 00:30:46.561
So, instead of folding hands
before everyone, you have to
fold hands before God only.

00:30:46.561 --> 00:30:50.201
And you become perfect and achieve
everything.

00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:53.701
In the present day, when man
is so disturbed

00:30:53.701 --> 00:30:59.394
and he's been troubled so much
from all sides,

00:30:59.394 --> 00:31:04.450
at that time, when the power of
the Spirit comes from within,
then a new form shines.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.973
Now take the example of My brother,
that he is a chartered accountant

00:31:07.973 --> 00:31:11.985
and he didn't even know Marathi language
[UNCLEAR]. All my brothers were very
bad at it.

00:31:11.985 --> 00:31:15.989
And were very weak in languages,
but I used to write their essays.

00:31:15.989 --> 00:31:19.061
This was their condition, all from
the elder brother onwards, everyone.

00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:21.693
But then in Marathi language, he
didn't know anything in language.

00:31:21.693 --> 00:31:26.185
But today I see that he writes such
poems – have you heard his poetry?

00:31:26.185 --> 00:31:31.587
And he's a chartered accountant, who
just kept counting one, two, three,
four - he started writing poems.

00:31:31.587 --> 00:31:35.656
Not only that, but even in Urdu
language, because Urdu he [UNCLEAR]
he knew a little bit.

00:31:35.656 --> 00:31:39.014
But he did not know Urdu language
- he started writing poems in Urdu.

00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:46.221
And he's so famous. Just went to where
[UNCLEAR - Saurashtra?] the government
had released and displayed everything on him.

00:31:46.221 --> 00:31:51.037
But we are living in Nagpur, doesn't
mean we are living in a well.

00:31:51.493 --> 00:31:55.633
We are connected to the whole society,
we are related to the whole world.

00:31:55.636 --> 00:32:03.866
When I first came to Nagpur, then I
noticed that - a sadhu in the household
is called a Sadhukada -

00:32:03.866 --> 00:32:08.771
similar was My condition. Initially,
no one really listened to Me, so I said,

00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:13.239
"Okay, when the Nagpur people come
to this state, I'll go and talk
to them."

00:32:13.239 --> 00:32:16.750
That's why I have now come to Nagpur
after being to(visiting) Gujarat.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:22.530
But I know that I have lived here,
and there are lots of vibrations
here, it is special.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:28.036
And if the people of Nagpur will take
to Sahaja Yoga, the whole world will
come and bow at your feet.

00:32:28.036 --> 00:32:34.347
You just heard that Sahaja Yoga is in
twenty-six countries; in fact, Sahaja Yoga
is being practiced in thirty countries.

00:32:34.347 --> 00:32:37.778
And representatives from there
come here once a year.

00:32:37.778 --> 00:32:47.178
If you look at them, you'll be
surprised to see them singing things
like Jogwa and Podwa in Marathi.

00:32:47.178 --> 00:32:51.927
They compose beautiful hymns in Hindi
language and sing them rhythmically.

00:32:51.927 --> 00:32:55.170
And these people are singing like
male and female.

00:32:55.475 --> 00:33:01.084
These people have done so much that
a Sahaja Yogi has come so he is
doing Rajasthani painting.

00:33:01.084 --> 00:33:03.662
I said that, "How did you learn
Rajasthani painting?"

00:33:03.662 --> 00:33:07.937
If a Marathi person wants to do Rajasthani
painting, then he cannot do it.

00:33:07.937 --> 00:33:13.917
Started saying, "Mother, when the light
of the Spirit comes, then hand automatically
understands the essence of the color."

00:33:13.917 --> 00:33:20.451
And the thing is that when we come
down to our principle, the essence
of everything comes into us.

00:33:20.881 --> 00:33:28.088
Now, those with whom we are related,
who are our people, through Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:28.088 --> 00:33:34.120
when you have a conversation, if you
talk in Sahaja Yoga, then they pay
attention to the real thing in you.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.304
Before that there is fake relationship.

00:33:36.304 --> 00:33:42.569
Now you know that I think that
the most learned and

00:33:43.083 --> 00:33:53.773
if ever there was someone who rose to
such a high level of spirituality, it
was in our own Maharashtra, you know

00:33:53.773 --> 00:33:59.857
that he has written the Pasaydaan,
Gynaneshwari. And the Pasaydan
written by Gynaneshwarji,

00:33:59.857 --> 00:34:04.533
that is complete Sahaja Yoga, a
description of complete Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:04.533 --> 00:34:10.388
Similarly, what Rabindranath Tagore
has also written that, "Come to
the shores of India,"

00:34:10.388 --> 00:34:16.358
all this, every single word of it
is absolutely correct about the program
that we have at Ganpatipule.

00:34:16.529 --> 00:34:23.539
Not only that, a hundred year ago
there was a great poet, William Blake,
in London.

00:34:23.539 --> 00:34:28.659
He related so many minute details where
Sahaja Yoga would begin, and where
My home would be,

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:31.520
and where I would stay — he gave
every detail.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.700
There was one Lewis, he has described
the entire procession in such detail

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.007
you will be surprised how he wrote
so meticulously.

00:34:40.007 --> 00:34:44.794
Because these people were seers,
and seers have seen and described
this thing.

00:34:44.794 --> 00:34:50.486
Not only this, thousands of years
ago, you know there had been this
Bhrigu Muni, who

00:34:50.486 --> 00:34:57.677
has made all our horoscopes etc,
and he was the complete helmsman
of the horoscope.

00:34:57.677 --> 00:35:05.714
He started all this thing. What all
he has written about future and
astrology, etc.

00:35:05.714 --> 00:35:08.328
nothing was written prior to that.

00:35:08.328 --> 00:35:15.225
He was such a scholar of this, he
has also written a treatise,
which is called Naadi Granth.

00:35:15.225 --> 00:35:20.623
And in that Na
adi Granth, he has
described the whole Sahaja Yoga
in such detail,

00:35:20.623 --> 00:35:25.934
And it is even said that when this
yoga will begin, when the Kundalini
will awaken spontaneously,

00:35:25.934 --> 00:35:29.473
then there'll be no need for hospitals.
And I think genuinely

00:35:29.473 --> 00:35:32.631
that if people practice Sahaja Yoga,
there is no need for hospitals.

00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:35.680
This thing happens so spontaneously
and simply

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.928
and if a doctor looks at Sahaja Yoga
with an open mind, he will be amazed.

00:35:40.928 --> 00:35:45.525
And thus you think that there are seven
English doctors who are astonished -

00:35:45.525 --> 00:35:51.027
a very big doctor has also come here,
who has earned a great reputation at
Cambridge and Oxford.

00:35:51.027 --> 00:35:55.901
And today he's the Head of the Department
of Psychiatrist (UNCLEAR - BALWAN?).

00:35:56.595 --> 00:36:02.255
And I see, all the people who come
to Sahaja Yoga, of great intelligence,
which is called in Marathi,

00:36:02.255 --> 00:36:07.337
tallakh(brilliant), means intellect,
a very pure intellect. One whose
intellect has some conditioning

00:36:07.337 --> 00:36:12.865
and he has twisted, collected,
created something, that is not
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:12.865 --> 00:36:19.055
Because we have not yet known the
truth, and we have to know it, we
have to attain it in this very life.

00:36:19.055 --> 00:36:25.001
Unless we have this concept/notion,
Sahaja Yoga is not going to happen,
won't happen till then.

00:36:25.001 --> 00:36:29.922
Thus, I want to tell the people of
Nagpur that now you feel like I
have come for the first time,

00:36:29.922 --> 00:36:35.631
but My entire childhood has been spent
here. I even went to school here only.

00:36:35.631 --> 00:36:38.096
And even I walked barefoot all around.

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:43.938
My father always said that the Girl
who is coming barefoot with slippers
in Her hand is the (UNCLEAR).

00:36:43.938 --> 00:36:50.092
So that everyone here may receive
vibrations and this region becomes
more fragrant,

00:36:50.092 --> 00:36:55.368
with this thought, I've made a lot
of efforts since childhood.
It must definitely show results.

00:36:55.368 --> 00:36:59.481
I am your own, I am from Nagpur
only, but that does not mean,

00:36:59.481 --> 00:37:04.081
that if someone's your own, then
you don't take the advantage from
that person which you should.

00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:08.189
Because for this you have nothing
to give, there is no such system,

00:37:08.189 --> 00:37:12.675
we don't have any organization.
You might be surprised that we
had to form a trust

00:37:12.675 --> 00:37:15.569
but we don't have anything,
anyone's name written anywhere.

00:37:15.569 --> 00:37:18.760
There's no membership, nothing,
everything is being formed.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.140
And when it was started, then even
My husband used to say,

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.398
that You are a saint, but You
cannot make anyone a saint.

00:37:26.398 --> 00:37:32.227
This transformation cannot happen.
I believe you are a saint, but
no one else can be/become a saint.

00:37:32.227 --> 00:37:37.891
Then, in the beginning, there was
some opposition from him as well,
that, "Why leave the household and work?"

00:37:37.891 --> 00:37:41.889
And now he himself has helped Me
so much, with so much money,

00:37:41.889 --> 00:37:45.492
has helped Me with everything
that somehow I do Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:45.492 --> 00:37:48.542
(UNCLEAR) also recently there was a
lecture before the Sahaja Yogis,

00:37:48.542 --> 00:37:52.053
so he said, "This is the real United Nations."

00:37:52.053 --> 00:37:55.678
Even when Bismillah Khan had a program,
so he started saying to Me

00:37:55.678 --> 00:37:59.336
that "Mother, have You created all
these pure and spotless people?"

00:37:59.336 --> 00:38:02.060
So I said, 'I am creating Khalistan
for them.'

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.470
Then he said, "What are they making?"

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.201
I said, "Go ask them what
they're making."

00:38:05.201 --> 00:38:07.868
'Khaalis' means that you become pure.

00:38:07.868 --> 00:38:12.569
And this Vishwa Nirmal Dharma only
has now been registered in America.

00:38:12.569 --> 00:38:19.716
The thing about Vishwa Nirmal Dharma
is that you have to become. You just
can't be a fanatic only.

00:38:19.716 --> 00:38:22.169
Someone tells you on your head
that you have become a Christian
from tomorrow.

00:38:22.169 --> 00:38:25.787
Someone gives you a sacred thread
and says, "You have become a Brahmin."
Not such falsity.

00:38:25.787 --> 00:38:29.565
In this you have to become, this
thing has to happen within you.

00:38:29.565 --> 00:38:32.199
It has to shine through in your
personality.

00:38:32.199 --> 00:38:36.354
Only then do you achieve the Vishwa
Nirmal Dharma, otherwise you do not.

00:38:36.354 --> 00:38:39.470
So from the human state we rise
to a higher state.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:43.218
This is the ultimate goal of
our evolution.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:49.186
Supposing there's an animal,
any horse or bull or anything,

00:38:49.186 --> 00:38:53.379
You can take him through a dirty drain,
he'll go. He won't have any problems.

00:38:53.379 --> 00:38:59.348
Man cannot go, because in evolution
he has known all these things,
filth and beauty.

00:38:59.778 --> 00:39:06.268
When a person attains this state, the
impurities of his past come to an end.

00:39:06.268 --> 00:39:10.541
He understands the filth of evil,
the filth of causing pain to others.

00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:15.508
And where he has the responsibility
to correct someone, then he stands
up to that too.

00:39:15.508 --> 00:39:17.264
That's also the thing.

00:39:17.264 --> 00:39:23.814
You achieve this kind of special,
miraculous personality.

00:39:23.814 --> 00:39:27.538
Many people who could never even
give a speech, when they speak
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:27.538 --> 00:39:30.719
then I am left speechless after listening
to them that how well they have started
speaking

00:39:30.719 --> 00:39:35.047
how in such a special way they
have come before everyone.

00:39:35.811 --> 00:39:42.311
I have to tell you this, that this
power is your own. As they say in
Marathi, 'Tujha aai tujha paaije'

00:39:42.311 --> 00:39:47.826
It is your own. And awakening this
Power is also very easy and simple.

00:39:47.826 --> 00:39:51.504
Now there are many books which say
that this Power causes perturbation.

00:39:51.504 --> 00:39:56.296
Sir, I have to thousands of people...
In Bombay, about fifteen thousand
people come here.

00:39:56.296 --> 00:40:01.800
This time also twelve to fifteen
thousand people came there in Vashi,
but no one had any problem.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.616
On the other hand, they all said,
"Mother, we felt so nice, and
now we're in bliss."

00:40:05.616 --> 00:40:09.596
"And now all our desires, all our
ailments are healed," all this only.

00:40:10.753 --> 00:40:16.983
But you must have this Pure Desire
within that we attain the Truth.

00:40:16.983 --> 00:40:19.217
Because this Kundalini that is,
is the Pure Desire.

00:40:19.217 --> 00:40:21.937
But if you already have wrong
conditionings,

00:40:21.937 --> 00:40:25.976
that, "No, I think this is right,
I think this is correct."

00:40:26.553 --> 00:40:29.173
Now you know The Truth only.

00:40:29.173 --> 00:40:32.774
You know the truth with your intellect
– you don't know The Truth (only).

00:40:32.774 --> 00:40:35.852
Suppose there is a man, he's a very
bad man.

00:40:35.852 --> 00:40:39.039
So how will you know whether this
person is bad or not?

00:40:39.966 --> 00:40:44.146
You have no such way. But if you
are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:40:44.146 --> 00:40:52.586
so you just have to put your hands
like this and ask, 'Is this man
good or bad?'

00:40:52.739 --> 00:40:57.489
If he's bad, you'll feel the heat;
sometimes blisters may even appear
for a while.

00:40:57.489 --> 00:41:01.107
And if he's good, then a cool breeze
will come from within you.

00:41:01.107 --> 00:41:08.177
Once it so happened that some
people in Poona said, "No,
we will not allow Mataji."

00:41:08.177 --> 00:41:12.847
because it's like this, like that,
about a variety of things.

00:41:12.847 --> 00:41:19.651
So I, no one told Me, but when I
reached there, they started saying,

00:41:19.651 --> 00:41:23.480
"She speaks against religion," and
said things like this.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:28.406
So I said, "Those among you who are
religious should come and sit in front."
So they came and sat in front.

00:41:28.406 --> 00:41:32.399
I said, "Okay alright, you put your
hands towards Me." So their hands
started (shaking) like this.

00:41:32.399 --> 00:41:36.470
I said, "What's going on?" They said,
"Yes, You fix this (UNCLEAR) why are
nervous?"

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:41.831
"Fix this, because it's like this, we
agree You're the power, otherwise
our hands wouldn't shake like this."

00:41:41.831 --> 00:41:44.512
So I said, "No one else's are shaking,
why are only yours shaking?"

00:41:44.512 --> 00:41:48.268
So some other people were sitting there.
They started saying, "Why are their
hands shaking?"

00:41:48.268 --> 00:41:52.586
I said, "Ask them who they are."
They said, "We're certified lunatics
from Thana."

00:41:52.586 --> 00:41:56.618
"And one lunatic was cured, so
we've come here to be cured."

00:41:56.618 --> 00:42:01.030
So these who were posing to be religious
and those crazy people, all of them were
of the same type, they were shaking like this.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:05.706
Then they understood that the
imagination in them is craziness.

00:42:05.706 --> 00:42:12.246
And we are not being righteous in
this; we have become fanatics because
we do not have dharma within us.

00:42:12.246 --> 00:42:17.640
Until Dharma awakens within us,
purity doesn't come in us, we
are not pure.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:23.855
And it is necessary to be pure because
by being pure, the entire power
of God is (UNCLEAR) with us.

00:42:23.855 --> 00:42:28.848
Many people say that when there
is a lot of virtue, we cannot
move about(exist) in this world.

00:42:28.848 --> 00:42:31.552
We can't do without lying -
there's no need.

00:42:31.552 --> 00:42:37.497
The Truth will bow before you. The
whole thing will unfold in such a
way that you will be astonished.

00:42:37.497 --> 00:42:42.005
Now look, I am a woman, and
I am a householder.

00:42:42.005 --> 00:42:46.990
I've done so much work in eighteen
years, I've worked in so many countries.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:51.983
It is all the Divine Power. Such
is the Divine power that it makes
things happen in such a way

00:42:51.983 --> 00:42:56.411
that you'll be surprised, "Oh, I
didn't think such a thing happened."

00:42:56.411 --> 00:42:58.614
"Who went, who did this?"

00:42:58.614 --> 00:43:04.552
But how can this be explained to such
people who think that there is no God?

00:43:04.552 --> 00:43:09.308
That haven't found out whether God
exists or not. How can you say
that God doesn't exist?

00:43:09.308 --> 00:43:14.677
Because you want to drink alcohol, you
want to do dirty things, want to murder
everyone, want to harass everyone,

00:43:14.677 --> 00:43:19.069
so said that there is no God. Otherwise,
saying that there is God would
create some restrictions.

00:43:19.912 --> 00:43:25.982
So, we must first find out whether there
is God or not, and through Kundalini
it's path is very

00:43:25.982 --> 00:43:29.148
easy, simple, that should be achieved.

00:43:29.148 --> 00:43:32.258
I'll tell you tomorrow about these
chakras which have been shown.

00:43:32.258 --> 00:43:37.175
But today I have explained Sahaja Yoga
to you as a proposal(hypothesis).

00:43:37.175 --> 00:43:41.924
Although during (UNCLEAR) days thousands
of speeches have been given in three
or four languages.

00:43:41.924 --> 00:43:45.998
And later when you come to Sahaja Yoga,
then when you will get well,

00:43:45.998 --> 00:43:48.621
then you too may get to hear
those speeches.

00:43:48.621 --> 00:43:53.428
Especially, I say that books even on
Sahaja Yoga should not be given.

00:43:53.428 --> 00:43:56.180
Because people's minds get corrupted
as soon as they take a book.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:01.028
Because you know that reading
so much spoils a person's mind.

00:44:01.028 --> 00:44:04.853
That's why Kabir said, "By reading
a lot, even the scholars become fools."

00:44:04.853 --> 00:44:09.465
All the people outside have entered
in; people think they have become
Sahaja Yogis by reading a book.

00:44:09.465 --> 00:44:14.127
Not by reading books, it's with
becoming. You have to become.

00:44:14.127 --> 00:44:20.154
Suppose that it's said about this
thing that it's very good,
it's a good means.

00:44:20.154 --> 00:44:23.034
That there's no need even for a
loudspeaker, it's very good.

00:44:23.034 --> 00:44:27.140
And what's the point if it doesn't
have a connection? What's the
benefit of using it?

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.460
Anything you [UNCLEAR] want to do,
let the connection happen first.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:36.020
And same is the case with Me,
and this time has come. I call
it blossom time.

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:40.066
Spring has come. Thousands of flowers
are such which are searching for God.

00:44:40.066 --> 00:44:44.936
But it must be come from a true heart
and should be taken into consideration,
should come into the mind(brain),

00:44:44.936 --> 00:44:49.315
that we haven't found the Truth yet,
and if the time has come to get it,
then why not take it?

00:44:49.315 --> 00:44:53.475
And if it's available for free,
then why not get(receive) it?

00:44:53.475 --> 00:44:57.009
If tomorrow I say that there's a diamond
here for free and you all come,

00:44:57.009 --> 00:45:03.369
So people will come from Australia.
But the diamond that is within you,
if you have to achieve it,

00:45:03.369 --> 00:45:05.936
then you don't think that something
should be done about it?

00:45:05.936 --> 00:45:09.622
Thus I request all of you, that
if you wish,

00:45:09.622 --> 00:45:13.688
then after this we will do a program
for the awakening of the Kundalini
which will take only ten minutes.

00:45:13.688 --> 00:45:23.395
So, all of you please understand that
which is your left hand put towards Me.

00:45:24.123 --> 00:45:31.373
It's good to take off your slippers
because the Mother Earth takes away
a lot of our troubles.

00:45:39.608 --> 00:45:44.158
Take off your shoes and also your
caps, because it's about piercing
the Brahmarandhra.

00:45:44.158 --> 00:45:48.088
And Mother is not some minister etc,
to put on a cap – She's your Mother.

00:45:48.706 --> 00:45:56.046
What's it to a Mother? You are completely
acceptable, just the way you are.
Now, put left hand towards Me.

00:45:56.707 --> 00:46:03.307
The left side, meaning it is, the
Power of Desire, it's your desire
that you attain self-realization.

00:46:03.984 --> 00:46:07.774
And keep the right hand on your
heart.

00:46:12.586 --> 00:46:17.626
Now see, I've told about the chakras,
but don't dwell on them,

00:46:17.796 --> 00:46:21.436
that if we have a heart problem
it will be cured.

00:46:21.436 --> 00:46:23.725
Not to think of such things, don't
think of anything at this time now.

00:46:23.725 --> 00:46:27.495
I am telling to do this because
when Kundalini will be awakened

00:46:27.495 --> 00:46:29.744
then many things will be fine
on their own.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:39.260
Now here is the place of the Spirit;
The reflection of God Almighty, in
the Spirit form, is in our hearts.

00:46:40.118 --> 00:46:49.028
After that place this hand on the
upper part of the stomach – this
is the Guru principle within us.

00:46:49.796 --> 00:46:57.046
In this we achieve the principle of a guru
– what is called proficiency, expertise.

00:46:57.329 --> 00:47:00.269
As an example of this, consider
that if there's a car

00:47:00.269 --> 00:47:04.190
in which you have an accelerator
and a brake

00:47:04.753 --> 00:47:10.463
so, at first, when you don't learn,
you can't drive, but when you start
learning,

00:47:10.463 --> 00:47:13.794
then sometimes you press the accelerator,
sometimes you press the brake.

00:47:13.794 --> 00:47:19.936
Like this also, we have two powers,
the brake one is the left, and the
accelerator one is the right.

00:47:20.038 --> 00:47:24.498
Sometimes use this, sometimes use that;
you learn by doing again and again.

00:47:25.004 --> 00:47:30.624
Then you become the driver, but
right now the master is sitting
at the back.

00:47:30.691 --> 00:47:38.461
Its master is sitting behind.
After that, you become the master.

00:47:38.461 --> 00:47:46.917
Then you see that there is a driver
within you, then we see

00:47:46.917 --> 00:47:52.033
and you also see its brake, and
also see its accelerator.

00:47:52.033 --> 00:47:58.788
But you are a master – that is what is
called a Sadguru but he is the master.

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.870
Its proficiency is achieved very easily.

00:48:02.316 --> 00:48:07.686
You don't need renunciation, don't need
fasting in this, don't need anything.

00:48:07.686 --> 00:48:12.745
It's just this that you have to give
a little time, ten minutes a day.

00:48:12.745 --> 00:48:18.617
We should give some time to ourselves
also because mostly we give time
to others only.

00:48:18.617 --> 00:48:22.693
If you give yourself just ten minutes,
then to you will progress a lot.

00:48:22.693 --> 00:48:27.699
And every week there is a collective
program here, go there and meditate there.

00:48:27.699 --> 00:48:30.094
That's it, nothing more is needed.

00:48:31.034 --> 00:48:39.864
Now, on this side, there is the Guru
principle, and it is therefore possible
for you to achieve this Guru principle

00:48:39.871 --> 00:48:43.491
because all the Sadgurus have worked
hard to create your Guru Tatva.

00:48:43.808 --> 00:48:46.388
So it should be said that it is
the left nabhi only.

00:48:47.075 --> 00:48:52.405
After that place your hand on the
lower side of the abdomen, on the
left hand side.

00:48:53.109 --> 00:49:00.009
This is the chakra of pure knowledge.
Impure knowledge is that which comes
from fanaticism,

00:49:00.009 --> 00:49:08.325
which comes through wrong means,
and when we wander here and
there in search of God.

00:49:08.325 --> 00:49:14.176
This is impure knowledge. And pure
knowledge is such that it is felt
in every nerve of our body.

00:49:14.176 --> 00:49:16.902
We feel it in our every nerve.

00:49:16.902 --> 00:49:20.708
It is felt in our Central Nervous System,
which is called as 'Vid'(to know),

00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:23.325
which is called realization,
which is known(realized).

00:49:24.415 --> 00:49:32.595
For this knowledge to happen within
us, we have to awaken this chakra.

00:49:32.796 --> 00:49:40.596
Now take this hand up again. This ours,
then we are raising the Kundalini to
the Guru principle.

00:49:40.596 --> 00:49:46.239
After that we place it on our hearts
and later we

00:49:46.239 --> 00:49:51.879
place it between our shoulder and
neck and turn the head to the right.

00:49:54.828 --> 00:50:05.548
After that, place your hand in this
way and place it on this chakra,
meaning where have to forgive everyone.

00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:21.858
Now you have to place this same
hand on the back side, here,
behind the optic lobe, here.

00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:26.961
And you have to put it on it like
this and tilt(rest) your head.

00:50:26.961 --> 00:50:33.007
Why this - it is a kind of method
of yoga?

00:50:33.007 --> 00:50:37.649
But after this you will attain what
is called spiritual union(yoga).

00:50:37.811 --> 00:50:46.381
Now, after this, you have to stretch
this hand. After stretching this hand,

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:54.050
you, the center part of it – you are
seeing here, this is Sahastrara,

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:59.250
meaning, this is the limbic area, the
Sahastrara. The space in the middle of it,

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:06.062
it exactly the center of this place
- our palate, which is sort of hard,
this and that,

00:51:07.308 --> 00:51:13.208
and bending your fingers back
and rotate your hand seven times.

00:51:13.208 --> 00:51:19.023
That's all you have to do. Now
after this, close your eyes.

00:51:19.023 --> 00:51:24.353
In mesmerism, it is said to keep
your eyes open, but in this, you
must close your eyes completely.

00:51:24.353 --> 00:51:28.949
And take off your glasses, too.
Because, please don't open your eyes.

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:34.249
Until the Kundalini is not fully
awakened, do not open your eyes
unless I tell you to.

00:51:34.249 --> 00:51:41.929
Because – bring hand down – because
your attention should remain inside.

00:51:42.062 --> 00:51:47.092
Opening your eyes outside causes the
attention to wander outside. So you
please do this.

00:51:47.092 --> 00:51:52.560
And those who don't want to do
this act, they may please go outside
and don't disturb others.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:58.230
I request just this that you all go
outside. Those who don't want to do
this should not sit here.

00:51:58.265 --> 00:52:03.285
Many of those people who were
shamelessly sitting here, laughing
and troubling everyone,

00:52:03.285 --> 00:52:09.866
It's a wrong thing, when you all
have come here, get it. Why
disturb others?

00:52:09.866 --> 00:52:15.280
Whoever wants to take it, let him take it.
The truth (UNCLEAR), then why are
you disturbing him?

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:19.088
And sat there laughing out loud
at him. This is not the way.

00:52:19.088 --> 00:52:22.943
It's like this that someone who
doesn't know classical music just
laughs in the classical,

00:52:22.943 --> 00:52:26.007
because is not able to understand,
so just laugh it off.

00:52:27.475 --> 00:52:30.495
And there is nothing to show off
in between.

00:52:30.495 --> 00:52:33.041
Have to attain it, have to get
it's experience.

00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:37.986
If you don't get it's experience,
then only you will [fall short of] it.

00:52:37.986 --> 00:52:41.203
What am I going to lose? I don't
need any Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:41.436 --> 00:52:46.186
Now put your left hand towards Me
and your right hand on your heart.

00:52:49.443 --> 00:52:53.243
Now there is a reflection of the
Spirit in our heart.

00:52:55.310 --> 00:53:00.210
So now you close your eyes.
Everyone close your eyes.

00:53:00.313 --> 00:53:05.133
Not too hard and not too lightly.
Don't even open it halfway.

00:53:05.133 --> 00:53:09.879
Just as you open your eyes completely,
close them the same way.

00:53:11.662 --> 00:53:19.482
After that you, keeping the hand on the
heart, ask Me a question that is
absolutely a fundamental question

00:53:19.519 --> 00:53:23.379
that, "Shri Mataji," ask a question
as you would to a computer.

00:53:23.379 --> 00:53:27.511
"Shri Mataji, am I the Spirit?"
Ask this three times.

00:53:34.193 --> 00:53:38.963
Close your eyes completely. Do not lift
your eyes upwards; keep them straight.

00:53:39.051 --> 00:53:42.531
There should be no movement of the
eye. Yes.

00:53:42.531 --> 00:53:49.693
"Shri Mataji, am I the Spirit?"
Don't open the eyes, please don't
open the eyes.

00:53:53.378 --> 00:53:57.428
Now, after asking this question
three times, should know,

00:53:57.428 --> 00:54:02.189
that if you are the Spirit, then
your Spirit is your guru.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:07.390
So, place your right hand on the
upper part of the stomach on the
left hand side.

00:54:08.206 --> 00:54:16.346
And after keeping it, you ask, that,
"Shri Mataji, am I my own guru?"

00:54:16.664 --> 00:54:22.584
Meaning I am the Spirit, means I am my
own guru. "Shri Mataji, am I my own guru?"

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:27.510
Ask three times.

00:54:38.347 --> 00:54:46.627
After that, place your right hand
on the lower part of your stomach.

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:52.910
This is the place of Pure Knowledge,
the left side of Swadhisthana.

00:54:55.736 --> 00:55:04.536
Here you are free. I cannot force
anything on you, I cannot impose
Pure Knowledge on you.

00:55:04.536 --> 00:55:11.339
Thus you ask, say, "Shri Mataji, You
please give me Pure Knowledge."

00:55:11.339 --> 00:55:14.108
If you won't say, I can't force
it on you.

00:55:14.108 --> 00:55:19.017
In your freedom you have to ask,
"Shri Mataji, You please give
me Pure Knowledge."

00:55:32.318 --> 00:55:39.078
After this, you have to say this
six times, because this chakra
has six petals.

00:55:52.508 --> 00:56:00.278
After this, you will have to place
your right hand on the upper part
of the stomach on the left hand side.

00:56:02.164 --> 00:56:06.734
Now when you have asked for Pure
Knowledge, the Kundalini has begun
to stir(move).

00:56:06.734 --> 00:56:13.410
And the Kundalini is rising after
being awakened, but in order to
help the chakras which are above,

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:20.281
you place your hand on the Guru Tattva
and say one thing ten times with
complete confidence

00:56:20.576 --> 00:56:27.246
that, "Shri Mataji, I am my own Guru,
Shri Mataji, I am my own Guru."

00:56:40.611 --> 00:56:50.861
Now say it ten times because we
have ten guru principles within.
So please say it ten times.

00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:02.500
Now raise this right hand and
place it on your heart again.

00:57:02.697 --> 00:57:09.297
And here – keep your feet slightly
apart, but don't open your eyes.

00:57:09.466 --> 00:57:16.746
This place, you say again with complete
confidence, with complete confidence,

00:57:16.746 --> 00:57:27.943
"Shri Mataji, I am the Spirit." This
is the greatest Truth. "Shri Mataji,
I am the Spirit." Greatest Truth.

00:57:51.594 --> 00:57:59.334
You say this twelve times, twelve times.

00:58:11.677 --> 00:58:18.487
Now raise your right hand and place
it between your neck and head -

00:58:22.264 --> 00:58:29.534
from the front, take it from the front
not from the back, from the front.
and turn your neck to the right.

00:58:31.106 --> 00:58:42.806
Now here you should know that God Almighty,
Who is in the form of Supreme Consciousness
(Paramchaitanya),

00:58:43.357 --> 00:58:52.547
He is the ocean of Grace and Mercy,
but the most of all,He is the ocean
of forgiveness.

00:58:52.924 --> 00:58:58.104
That's why any mistake you make,
He can forgive it completely.

00:58:58.723 --> 00:59:05.403
So you, with a happy mind, say
it sixteen times here

00:59:05.403 --> 00:59:13.255
that, "Shri Mataji, I am not guilty at all."
Say it sixteen times, sixteen times,
sixteen times

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.610
"I'm not guilty at all, I didn't do
anything wrong."

00:59:36.334 --> 00:59:49.104
Now gather this right hand and keep
it on your forehead, keep on the
forehead, on the forehead.

00:59:49.112 --> 00:59:56.502
And press it from both sides.
Press from both sides.

00:59:56.502 --> 01:00:01.939
Just like when you have a headache,
you press it, press it from both sides.

01:00:01.939 --> 01:00:07.666
Now here you say, "Shri Mataji, I
have forgiven everyone all together."

01:00:07.666 --> 01:00:12.566
"Forgiven everyone all together."
Many people say that it's very
difficult to forgive.

01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:24.749
See, this is a wrong thing. To
forgive is difficult, and not to
forgive is difficult -

01:00:24.749 --> 01:00:30.527
Both of these things are of the
mind because you don't do anything,
whether you forgive or don't.

01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:34.631
So should know that when we
don't forgive

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:38.398
then because of ourselves we're
playing into the hands of the
wrong people.

01:00:38.398 --> 01:00:44.662
So for everyone say it together, don't
remember anyone, don't mention anyone
by name, all together.

01:00:59.436 --> 01:01:07.266
Now the same hand, say it with your
heart, it doesn't matter how many
times, say it with your heart -

01:01:09.397 --> 01:01:14.138
and now take this hand to the
back portion of your head,

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:19.887
and lift your head upwards, and
hold(rest) it on your hand.

01:01:20.648 --> 01:01:28.318
Here you have to say, for your
own solution, and not feeling
that you are guilty,

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:32.581
but peacefully, understanding the
peace within, that

01:01:32.581 --> 01:01:40.979
"If we, O Supreme Consciousness! O Spirit!
If we have committed any mistake,
then You please forgive us."

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:45.857
You can say it only once, but
say it with all your heart.

01:01:50.933 --> 01:02:01.483
Now open your right hand completely
and the place that is in its center,

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:11.919
place that on your fontanel bone area
and bend your head, and press it firmly.

01:02:11.919 --> 01:02:18.462
Because here, open the big hole
and rotate it clockwise very
slowly, seven times.

01:02:18.787 --> 01:02:28.898
Even at this time, I respect your
freedom and I must tell you that,

01:02:28.898 --> 01:02:34.624
"Shri Mataji, please give me Self-Realization."
This cannot be forced upon you.

01:02:34.624 --> 01:02:41.496
You say it with humility seven times,
with your head bowed. Say it with bent
head. Bend your head,

01:02:41.496 --> 01:02:48.133
bend your neck forward and with bent
neck say that, "Shri Mataji, please
give me Self-Realization."

01:02:48.133 --> 01:02:54.396
Right now I'm blowing on Pranava,
and that's necessary, and you'll
see the results.

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:59.089
How beneficial it is. There's no
magic in it, it's Pranav.

01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:06.541
[Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone]

01:03:07.526 --> 01:03:12.126
[Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone]

01:03:12.258 --> 01:03:18.948
[Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone]

01:03:18.948 --> 01:03:25.264
[Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone]

01:03:25.722 --> 01:03:34.688
[Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone]

01:03:34.688 --> 01:03:40.235
[Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone]

01:03:40.235 --> 01:03:45.388
[Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone]

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:51.762
[Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone]

01:03:51.965 --> 01:03:57.605
[Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone]

01:03:57.605 --> 01:04:04.398
Now you take both the hands down
and slowly open your eyes.

01:04:04.514 --> 01:04:12.344
Keep both hands towards Me. Slowly
open your eyes, slowly, very slowly.

01:04:12.344 --> 01:04:16.986
Keep both your hands towards Me.
Open your eyes very slowly.

01:04:18.216 --> 01:04:24.656
Now, keep your right hand towards Me.
Now you are thoughtless; no thoughts
are coming to you.

01:04:24.656 --> 01:04:30.551
And you see with your head bent -
place your right hand towards Me -

01:04:30.561 --> 01:04:33.651
whether any cool breeze is coming
out of your fontanel bone area?

01:04:48.246 --> 01:04:54.406
Now place your left hand towards Me;
Bend your head, open your eyes and see

01:04:54.406 --> 01:04:57.744
whether there is some cool air coming
from your fontanel bone area.

01:04:57.744 --> 01:05:00.322
See on the right hand, keep the
left hand towards Me.

01:05:04.111 --> 01:05:07.171
Now place your right hand towards
Me for the last time

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:13.975
and see(check) with your left hand,
whether there is any cool breeze
coming from the fontanel bone area.

01:05:20.378 --> 01:05:27.878
Now, with both your hands towards
the sky, with head tilted back,

01:05:27.878 --> 01:05:33.328
ask Me a question that, "Shri Mataji,
is this the Param Chaitanya?"

01:05:33.885 --> 01:05:48.395
or "Shri Mataji, is this the love of God?"
or "Shri Mataji, is this the cool breeze
of the Holy Spirit?"

01:05:48.755 --> 01:05:54.285
You ask any question three times,
with the neck turned upwards.

01:05:56.829 --> 01:06:07.209
Now bring the hands down. Those who
felt the cool breeze on their heads

01:06:08.468 --> 01:06:16.278
and those who have felt it on their
hands or in their hands, please
raise both your hands.

01:06:24.862 --> 01:06:28.152
Some people - okay, now put down -

01:06:28.646 --> 01:06:33.916
must have felt in one hand. Those
who felt coolness in just one hand,
please raise your hands.

01:06:34.608 --> 01:06:40.338
who has in only one hand -
so it doesn't matter.

01:06:40.369 --> 01:06:48.349
If you have got in your right hand,
then keep your left hand towards Me
and your right hand on the ground.

01:06:50.633 --> 01:06:58.843
And if you have got in your left hand,
then place your right hand towards Me

01:06:58.843 --> 01:07:09.024
and left hand on the ground — no,
up like this. Most people may not
have got it in their right hand

01:07:09.502 --> 01:07:13.402
because we're very right-sided,
we work a lot, that's why.

01:07:13.402 --> 01:07:20.388
Now, on this you forgive. Keeping
hand like this, forgive everyone,
everyone.

01:07:20.673 --> 01:07:24.123
Right Hand - mostly people don't
get it on the right hand.

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:28.321
The thing is, we're very right-sided,
do a lot of work, think,

01:07:28.321 --> 01:07:35.393
think about the future, plan.
Right hand? Right hand?

01:07:35.705 --> 01:07:44.695
It's alright, forgive. At this moment
we should say, "We forgive everyone."

01:07:44.842 --> 01:07:47.392
Just say this, "We have forgiven
everyone."

01:07:49.738 --> 01:07:54.848
Is it coming in your hand now? In
the right hand? Keep hand like this.

01:07:56.178 --> 01:08:02.648
Didn't come? Did it come in the left?
No, talking about those who didn't
get in the right.

01:08:03.654 --> 01:08:09.714
Who is not getting in the right?
Are you people getting in the right?
Are you getting?

01:08:09.744 --> 01:08:15.414
See, you didn't forgive. Had you
forgiven, it would have come before.

01:08:15.806 --> 01:08:24.866
Just have to forgive. It'll definitely
come. Is it coming? No, keep your
right hand towards Me.

01:08:25.426 --> 01:08:32.696
Not coming in the left hand? Okay,
then lower your right hand. Yes,
this earth element sucks.

01:08:32.696 --> 01:08:37.188
And when you do your right hand,
then the sky element(ether) sucks.

01:08:37.705 --> 01:08:42.735
Is it alright? Okay, alright. Do
keeping the left hand like this
and right hand like this.

01:08:44.783 --> 01:08:50.113
Many times it also happens due to
liver disease; so place your left
hand on your liver.

01:08:51.437 --> 01:09:04.997
Place your right hand on the liver,
left hand. Now you have become a saint.

01:09:09.537 --> 01:09:14.427
Now let's see how many people felt
cool in their hands?
Raise your hands again once?

01:09:14.614 --> 01:09:19.994
All the people who got it in their
hands or heads? Yes do it, again,
all the people who got it.

01:09:19.994 --> 01:09:27.672
If everyone raises up, then will
be able to see clearly. Many people
have experienced, many people.

01:09:32.771 --> 01:09:36.731
Now the only thing to learn in
this is that, as there is a seed,

01:09:36.731 --> 01:09:40.861
its sprout has come out but
it must become a tree.

01:09:41.064 --> 01:09:49.844
Therefore, it is important that this
is a collective work and you people
please come to our center

01:09:50.108 --> 01:09:56.978
and receive this. It is very important
that all of you come to the collective
and get it.
