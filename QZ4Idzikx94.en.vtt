Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Eve of Birthday Puja

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.510
Sydney, Australia
March 20th, 1990

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.390
So My tour of Australia has come to an end.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.180
Today is a day I can say it’s all very well
done.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.360
We have had very good response; I didn’t
expect that much everywhere.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.240
It was tremendous and very great things have
happened, some miracles also, during this

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.020
visit.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:35.950
And one has to know that Sahaja yogis have
to be with great potential manifesting.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:43.870
If they are, then it triggers very well; otherwise
I cannot work out.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.930
For that we have to understand that in Sahaja
Yoga there’s no sacrifice of any kind.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.570
Don’t have to sacrifice anything, it’s
all the time blessings throughout.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.420
You don’t have to sacrifice anything, and
you don’t have to suffer also anything – nothing

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.780
of the kind.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.370
I have told you about how My father was in
jail, My mother was in jail and how many times,

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.300
and how we suffered during the war of independence.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.590
We lost everything, all our properties, everything,
for the war of independence only.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:28.210
But this is the independence, the freedom
of an absolute nature: not only for you but

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.530
for the whole world, for your children, for
everyone.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.290
It’s a tremendous work.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.210
It’s a very great achievement.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.240
In the history of spirituality, in the history
of the world this is the greatest thing that

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.310
has happened, is that people are transformed
into a new awareness.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.020
Perhaps you are not aware of it.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.850
And we take it for granted, we don’t understand
the importance of it; and we get lost into

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.140
smaller, smaller things and very wasteful
things which are of no value.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.270
How are these things will be going into the
history, you must understand that.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.070
And where do you stand in that history?

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.940
What will you be called?

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.490
So now first of all there were problems with
the leaders.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.620
All right.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.910
But there were some who stuck on to it.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.810
They didn’t give it up.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.770
They did not give it up because the leaders
were bad.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.140
Nobody wrote to Me, all right, but they stuck
on.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:41.000
But those who went away, why didn’t they
write to Me why they went away?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.850
This is an escape from reality.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:49.360
This is an escape, to say that there was something
wrong with the the ashram people, there was

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.890
something wrong with the leaders – of course,
it was.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.920
But you should have written to Me – why
didn’t you write to Me?

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:06.310
Why did you take such decisions on your own,
and just left the Sahaja Yoga into lurch?

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.620
We have to be people of quality, otherwise
Sahaja Yoga won’t work out.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:19.240
It’s not meant for people who are mediocres.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.290
If there are few, doesn’t matter; but there
have to be people of quality, that is one

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.730
thing for sure.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.780
Now I have seen that everywhere people have
taken here a view that it’s better to have

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.780
separate houses.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:37.730
I mean, this is another absurd view: from
where it has come into your heads, I don’t

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.730
know.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:44.410
Absolutely absurd, against Sahaj, it’s most
asahaj view.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.240
Today only I was reading, five old ladies
were killed by one man, because they were

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.750
living alone in every house.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:59.560
Such violence, such horrible atmosphere everywhere.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.090
Even for security it’s better that you live
together, at least eight people, ten people

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.430
together.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:12.580
There’s no sacrifice in it, there’s no
sacrifice.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.890
On the contrary if you live together as I’ve
told you, you save money, your children are

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:21.879
looked after; if somebody’s pregnant she’s
looked after, there’s somebody to look after

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:24.559
you.

00:08:24.559 --> 00:08:26.369
But what is the gain of having another house,
I don’t understand.

00:08:26.369 --> 00:08:36.800
You have to work much harder, pay much more,
but a kind of a ego satisfaction is there.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.129
And then they develop problems, I have seen:
we’ve got cancer, we’ve got heart attacks,

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:45.709
we’ve got this, “my son has run away”,
that has happened, that has happened.

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:51.230
All this arbitrary behavior, and I am supposed
to be sort of responsible for everything.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.430
It’s a complete liability, once somebody
comes to Sahaja Yoga, then he is a liability

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.430
on us.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:03.670
But he has no responsibilities and he has
no duties – only I have.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.799
That’s not proper.

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:12.999
So now I have to tell you today very frankly
that you all have to live together, at least

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:17.200
eight to ten people in a place.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.629
And don’t fight, and don’t create groups.

00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:25.909
Group-making is a very wrong thing.

00:09:25.909 --> 00:09:30.629
Before making any group you write to Me.

00:09:30.629 --> 00:09:36.320
You are all welcome to write to Me, and I’ll
attend to that letter if it is worth attending,

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.010
because I know everything through vibrations.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.070
Don’t talk against each other.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.029
It’s a murmuring souls, and Christ has said
such people will go to hell.

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:50.129
It’s not hell outside, I tell you, it will
be the hell here.

00:09:50.129 --> 00:09:52.619
It’s hell here.

00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:54.020
I have seen people suffering.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.480
I have been so frightened, you have no idea.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.249
Don’t play about with Sahaja Yoga at all.

00:10:01.249 --> 00:10:04.969
I’m just warning you, it’s a very serious
thing.

00:10:04.969 --> 00:10:10.770
People have got heart attacks, have got accidents,
have got cancers, all kinds of things, and

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:15.299
really I am quite frightened that you people
don’t realize that there is another force

00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:16.849
working it out.

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:18.589
Don’t take arbitrary decisions.

00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:21.329
You are very safe in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:25.360
Stay in Sahaja Yoga, grow in Sahaja Yog, enjoy
in Sahaja Yog.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.450
Everything is there available for you.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:33.950
And you don’t have to do anything else except
that keep together: it’s a collective happening.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.960
It’s a collective.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:44.510
If you are not in the collective, the Divine
is not interested in you at all – you are

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.599
out of it.

00:10:47.599 --> 00:10:54.659
Only the collective gets the power, only the
collective is magnetic.

00:10:54.659 --> 00:10:59.999
Single person who lives away from collective
all the time, is something wrong with that

00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:00.999
person.

00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:03.950
If you cannot be collective, there’s something
wrong.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:08.029
Such a person should sit down and find out
what’s wrong with that person, must get

00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:11.929
it corrected, absolutely corrected.

00:11:11.929 --> 00:11:16.820
And see to it that you are all right; because
this is for your benevolence.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:24.270
You want to lead a happy, healthy, good life,
then be sensible, have some wisdom about it.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.189
And so some people who have been negative
are still negative, and just thinking on the

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.049
same lines.

00:11:31.049 --> 00:11:38.320
So it’s high time all of you have to work
it out sensibly, and understanding.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:49.349
There are leaders because I have to have communication,
that’s all.

00:11:49.349 --> 00:11:51.219
And they will communicate to Me about you
people.

00:11:51.219 --> 00:11:53.390
If there are problems, they will try to solve
you.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:58.749
If they cannot solve it, they’ll write to
Me and I’ll have to see to it.

00:11:58.749 --> 00:12:04.779
There’s not going to be any regimentation
in Sahaja Yoga at all; it is a thing of love.

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:06.360
But you must have love for yourself.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.149
I mean, you should be self-disciplined.

00:12:09.149 --> 00:12:14.129
Now imagine how I must have felt: I have come
here, I’ve worked so hard for so many times

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:17.730
I have been here, and when I come here what
I find, everything is broken down.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.850
It’s so sad – I’ve worked so hard.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:28.479
But next time I am going to see you all settled
down in proper ashrams, in different place.

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:33.010
Not for your own comfort you should think,
but if you have an ashram you put a center

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.010
there.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.430
Every place you can have a center.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:41.330
In Bombay, I don’t know, we have eighteen
or twenty-one centers, in Bombay.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:46.000
That’s how it increases, and improves it.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.700
You have centers everywhere, so it’s available
to people all the time.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.640
You would talk about it, meet every day, evening
time you all can meet, talk to each other;

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.489
and you have one day in a week somewhere,
in a school or something, big place where

00:12:58.489 --> 00:12:59.909
you all meet.

00:12:59.909 --> 00:13:04.049
The more you meet, the more there is rapport,
the more there is collectivity, the more there

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:08.659
are blessings for each one of you, and for
all of you.

00:13:08.659 --> 00:13:14.940
It absolutely simultaneously works out; whilst
when there is no collectivity – no.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.910
When there is collectivity, everything works
out.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.860
Everything is available to you.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.799
So don’t try to break the collectivity by
forming any groups or anything – nothing

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:30.060
of the kind.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.910
If you find anything wrong you have to write
to Me.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:39.320
But it’s everybody’s responsibility is
to sustain the collectivity, to support it,

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.989
to help it.

00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:46.700
If you find that somebody is talking about
somebody else, then you say, “No, no, he

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.760
was talking very good about you.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:54.080
Why are you talking ill about that person?”

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.200
This is what, this is what Christ has said,
that these are peacemakers.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.560
But somebody says something about someone
– oh, then you go into, “Ho, ho, ho, that

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.610
one is like this,” then another one.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:13.799
We are not like common people, we are not
ordinary people, we are saints.

00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:21.010
We are to respect each other, to love each
other, to understand and enjoy each other.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.359
What will the children say tomorrow?

00:14:24.359 --> 00:14:28.210
So nobody should get away with this idea that
we can have separate houses, live separately

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.870
and we are all right.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.680
Better take out all My photographs from them;
they have no business.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.840
At least eight persons should be there in
one household, at least, minimum.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.049
Eight to ten people is a good idea.

00:14:40.049 --> 00:14:44.510
There’s no safety, there’s no progress,
there’s nothing in such houses where they

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.110
live alone very nicely.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:51.560
Morning till evening they are cooking, cleaning,
sweeping, swabbing, looking after the car,

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:59.109
locking the house – what else are they doing?

00:14:59.109 --> 00:15:04.710
It’s so boring to be alone, it’s extremely
boring.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:08.950
Now I have already told you very clearly that
we have to live together.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:14.680
And let the children know each other, know
everyone, they should know about their friendship.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:20.460
And you know, it is so nice the way they love
each other and the way they talk to each other,

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.440
and about their aunties and uncles they talk
so sweetly.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.500
So many aunties and uncles to have is something
so remarkable; to have so many nephews and

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.989
nieces all over.

00:15:34.989 --> 00:15:38.719
And unless and until you have that kind of
a feeling, it won’t work out.

00:15:38.719 --> 00:15:42.169
Then if somebody finds something wrong with
your child and tells you, don’t get angry

00:15:42.169 --> 00:15:44.839
for that – thank him.

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:45.839
Try to improve your child.

00:15:45.839 --> 00:15:49.060
The improvement of your child is for the benevolence
of the child.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.060
Not to feel bad: “this is my child.”

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.440
This “my” business has to go a little
bit; then I will come.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:59.490
If there is “my house”, “my children”,
“my car”, “my” this, this has to go

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.770
away.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:14.299
Let us see how we start diverting our energies
to a collective beauty, collective love, collective

00:16:14.299 --> 00:16:15.940
understanding.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.730
And if it is not, there’s something wrong
with you, take it from Me, something wrong.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:25.609
So either you are right-sided or left-sided:
find out and just get yourself cleared out.

00:16:25.609 --> 00:16:32.170
Treat it out yourself, and you will understand
that there was something wrong with you, nothing

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:37.529
wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:44.220
All such ideas are going to completely blast
Sahaja Yoga and finish it off.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:52.469
They are selfish, self-oriented, absolutely
out-of-date ideas for Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:59.359
You can have one room each other, for each
one of them and you can stay together, and

00:16:59.359 --> 00:17:02.419
you can have somebody as a leader, whomsoever
you want.

00:17:02.419 --> 00:17:07.419
If you want we can do rotation of leaders
later on if you like that, can be done also.

00:17:07.419 --> 00:17:10.930
But still I would say that unless and until
there is something wrong with the leader,

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:16.919
it’s not proper to remove such a leader.

00:17:16.919 --> 00:17:19.210
But whatever you suggest, I don’t mind,
but we have to have someone who is looking

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:26.770
after you, and informing Me about it.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:32.900
But the wife of the leader is never a leader,
understand that, it’s only the leader is

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.900
the leader.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.760
Whether it’s the husband or a wife of a
leader is not a leader, and she should never

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.190
behave like that.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:45.510
She has to be very motherly, kindly, and all
the time looking after all the people in a

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.779
more gentler way than the husband himself.

00:17:49.779 --> 00:17:54.239
That’s the sign of a good wife of a leader.

00:17:54.239 --> 00:18:02.650
We have some, we have such women, and wherever
there have been good ashrams, Sahaja Yoga

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.450
has prospered.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.089
It has gone up to the governments, it has
gone up to the intellectuals, it has gone

00:18:08.089 --> 00:18:14.700
up to such areas where we would never expect
it, anywhere there has been.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:26.560
And most of the people now are in the ashrams,
in the whole world.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:33.830
I hope you all understand the importance of
it.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:40.130
Anything goes wrong with anyone here, immediately
the telephone comes, that something has gone

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.700
wrong with such and such person is sick.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.359
Then I can tell you what is to be done, how
to get that person cured.

00:18:44.359 --> 00:18:49.589
But supposing you are in some other house
…. It happened like this, one fellow was

00:18:49.589 --> 00:18:52.169
like that and he met with an accident.

00:18:52.169 --> 00:18:53.700
Met with an accident, nobody knew.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.950
He was lying in the hospital – when he came
to his consciousness he called for somebody,

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:04.209
then they told Me.

00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:08.919
It’s like one family, it’s like one body.

00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:11.320
If something hurts here, every – the whole
body knows.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.520
You must know how many there are with us.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.690
You feel so strong and happy.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:23.239
But first of all you must develop that rapport,
you must develop that love, must develop that

00:19:23.239 --> 00:19:24.409
personality.

00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:29.200
Now those who are left-sided, I’ve already
told them what treatment they have to take,

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.099
and take it seriously.

00:19:31.099 --> 00:19:35.750
Left-sidedness should not be allowed to grow
at all – I tell you, it’s very dangerous.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:40.630
All these horrible diseases that you have
heard of, all of them, one and all – say

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:49.729
epilepsy, mental derangements, you can say
cancer, all psychosomatic, this myelitis,

00:19:49.729 --> 00:19:57.239
then there are other diseases like AIDS, all
that – attack only left-sided people.

00:19:57.239 --> 00:20:01.220
Anybody who has left side, immediately try
to get rid of that left side.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.200
The right side shows so everybody knows, and
you can throw away such a person, or you can

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.200
correct it.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.299
But the left side be very careful, don’t
play about with the left side.

00:20:10.299 --> 00:20:14.830
Left side is very dangerous.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:20.719
To avoid that, don’t mix up with people
who are mentally deranged, don’t go to the

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:27.370
hospitals where such people live, don’t
try to cure people who are left-sided – they

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.680
can be all cured on My photograph.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:37.919
And if somebody starts telling too much about
their woes and all that, just shut your ears.

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:46.450
All this left side comes from a kind of a
self-indulgence, in the sense that you start

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:52.010
thinking you are so miserable, you are so
unhappy, you are no good, and all that.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:57.700
So the right-sided are over-confident, the
left-sided are diffident.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.000
But they’re, because they’re diffident,
you see, all kinds of viruses can attack.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.950
And these viruses are the thing which bring
forth diseases which cannot be cured.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.960
So be careful on that point.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.140
The right-sided people trouble others.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.490
The left-sided trouble themselves, and the
right-sided trouble others.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:24.410
They try to show off, they want to – just
think they’re too much.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:30.730
First sign of a right-sided is that he starts
suddenly shouting, or giving lectures also,

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.020
that’s another one.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:38.560
Thirdly, he tries to show off that he’s
a very big, great Sahaja yogi.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.770
There’s nobody great in Sahaja Yoga, everybody
is just the same.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:47.810
Just like all fingers are the same, every
cell is the same, everybody is the same.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:54.650
So nobody higher and lower, there’s no hierarchy
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:22:00.740
Everybody must understand that we are all
one, part and parcel of one body, and we don’t

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:05.310
have to consider ourself higher or lower.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:12.590
So there are so many ways of expression of
these boastful, right-sided people.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:18.020
And we can pull their legs – all right,
allowed!

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:23.220
If somebody boasts too much you just pull
their legs, that’s allowed.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:28.700
That’s how in India nobody can have ego,
because from very childhood if somebody tries

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.780
to show off, pull their legs.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.920
If somebody talks loudly, pull their legs.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.290
If somebody laughs loudly, pull their legs.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:45.860
I mean, anything somebody tries to do, overdo,
just pull their legs.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:51.410
So it doesn’t behoove for a Sahaja yogi
to be like that.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:59.140
Sahaja yogi has to be very dignified; otherwise
why will people come to Sahaja Yoga, if we

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.210
are just like them?

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:08.370
We have to be exceptional, isn’t it?

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:19.720
And that’s what is what I call dignified,
loving, affectionate, kind, sweet – that’s

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:25.340
what is the beauty.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:32.790
So anybody who shouts, screams, gets angry,
full of anger, this thing, bring one pin and

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:38.460
just prick it – allowed!

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.300
And if he says anything, it’s to prick your
ego.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.110
Show the pins, you see, like this.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:53.830
He’ll understand, “All right, this is
what I have.”

00:23:53.830 --> 00:24:01.120
So when you make a fun of a person who is
egoist he may not like it; but you show him

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.550
a pin, he’ll understand, “Oh God, I have
got it!”

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.050
They are quite aware of their ego, they don’t
want to have it.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:14.040
There was a gentleman from Delhi, his son
wrote to Me saying that “My father says

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.930
that he’s not allowed to speak at all, and
he’s feeling very sad about it.”

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:25.250
So in the lecture I said that nobody is allowed
to speak.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:33.840
After My tape, meditate, stay in that meditative
mood, and go home.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.330
Not that just after meditation, “Oh, what
cake I am going to have?” – all rush to

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:39.330
the kitchen.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.710
So it’s surprising, even Indians are surprised
at it.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:46.630
India, people don’t get so much to eat,
but they are not hankering so much after food.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:50.620
Here the first attention is in the kitchen,
all the time they are in the kitchen.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:55.730
How many times you take your tea is important.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.590
You should count how many times you are in
the kitchen.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:02.860
I mean, you are still little babies, I tell
you, in that respect.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:07.840
I don’t think I have ever opened a fridge
to take out even water for Myself – I mean,

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:14.810
since I remember My life, never.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.460
So this hankering after food is also another
funny thing that is.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:23.400
After meditation people just get up and go
to eat.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.920
You must sit down, meditate.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:31.950
Now after meditation if people start giving
speeches, then the people are anxious to go

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:39.660
to the kitchen, here’s somebody giving lectures,
so big problem starts between the two.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.470
They don’t like it, because they think,
“Oh, there’s a cake there, there’s something

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:49.000
biryani kept, and here it is this gentleman
is trying to give us a lecture.”

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.560
No one likes it.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.210
But it should be something very different,
that we are in meditative mood, how can we

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.510
come out of it?

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:01.140
So I’d better tell you a story of Janaka,
which is very important.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:06.530
He was the one, in the beginning at the time
of Shri Rama, He was the father-in-law of

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.759
Shri Rama, His name was Raja Janaka.

00:26:08.759 --> 00:26:11.440
And He was a king.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.970
So all the saints used to come and bow to
Him.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:19.350
And He was a king, He used to live like a
king.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:24.420
So one fellow, Nachiketa asked his guru, he
said, “What is this, you bow to this Raja?

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:29.520
He has got all the wealth, He has got everything,
wears all the ornaments, He has all pomp and

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.520
show.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.230
Why should you, a saint like you, go and bow
to Him?”

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.590
He said “He’s videhi.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.300
He’s so detached, He’s videhi.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.350
He doesn’t exist in His body.”

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:39.380
He couldn’t understand.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.440
He said, “All right, I’ll go and see Him.”

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:47.670
So he went and told Him that “I want to
become self-realized, as You are.”

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.960
He said, “You ask Me everything; I can give
you, but no self-realization.”

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.850
“All right, we’ll see about it,” he
said.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:57.510
So one day they were having a bath.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:02.140
He said, “Let’s go to the river, we’ll
have our bath.”

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:07.480
So He took this boy, they were sitting and
having the bath, when some people came and

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:14.850
told that “Your palace is burning, and everybody
is running away.”

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.960
So He was still in meditative mood, He wouldn’t
listen.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.450
Then they came back again, shouted, “See
now, Your wife and children all are, have

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:28.940
come out of it and they are all running away,
because the whole thing is getting burned.”

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.520
Still He was in meditative mood, least bothered.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:40.190
Then they said, “Now the fire is coming
this side, and what are You doing?”

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.430
So Nachiketa got up and he caught hold of
his clothes.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:45.610
He thought, “I should wear my clothes at
least, they’ll be burnt.”

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:48.860
He was still meditating.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.400
Then Nachiketa realized that He is videhi.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.790
That’s why Sitaji is called as Vaidehi,
because She is the daughter of a videhi.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.570
And that’s what we have to be.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.900
“Where is our attention?” we should say.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.480
You are meditating, take it deep down into
yourself.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.600
That’s a meditative mood.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.590
Keep yourself there.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:16.160
And after meditation you just get up silently,
sit for a while.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:22.571
I think best thing will be to have your food
first and then meditate, if that is so, if

00:28:22.571 --> 00:28:24.130
you think that is proper.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:35.560
But I think if you have to get now into that
new triggering, as I told you, into that new

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.950
jumping that we have to do in Sahaja Yoga:
if you have to catch that train, then you

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.910
hurry up.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.210
You have to change all these ideas.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:49.320
You have had many houses, you have had many
wives and many children in your previous life.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.340
You never had your realization – now you
have got it.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:00.120
So now just every individual, every one of
you should not think of others, think of yourself,

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:06.380
“I have to do it, I have to get it, I have
to work it out.”

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.500
This is what you have to do.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.340
“Why should I miss it?”

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:15.930
This is a chance of many lives, the chance
of many lives.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:22.320
And that’s how you can jump over, and work
it out.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:30.180
We had lots of people in Australia, and if
they had worried about themselves as to “what

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.840
I have done for Sahaja Yoga.”

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.000
So in the morning you just decide, what I
am going to do for Sahaja Yog and myself;

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.290
in the evening, what have I done for myself,
and what have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:45.320
“Myself” doesn’t mean selfishness, but
“for my ascent.”

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.320
Every day.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.510
You start a diary to write it down.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.800
You face yourself.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.100
No excuses, nothing.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:57.540
If you are left behind, what we can do?

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:01.820
We can’t help it.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.440
And that is how you’ll find all kinds of
blessings will come to you.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.560
You’ll be able to save money, you’ll be
able to save time, you’ll get good jobs.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:18.410
All your problems can be solved if you really
surrender yourself to that Paramachaitanya.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:20.850
Everything can be done.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:26.830
But as long as you have this narrow-mindedness
and these narrow ideas about yourself, till

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.010
then it won’t work out.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:34.720
This drop has to become one with the ocean,
then ocean takes over.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.230
And I am sure that can work out.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:47.070
And you are basically a very good point here,
because you are born on the land of Shri Ganesha.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:52.870
Basically it’s such an advantage for you,
much more than Russians have.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.550
But Russians, I don’t know how, they have
shot up so well.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:03.440
It’s an Agnya, it’s a right Agnya where
they have denied Christ, they have denied

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:10.690
all religions, everything, and still they’re
prospering.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:13.300
So you are very well placed.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:18.100
And innocence can never be lost, can never
be lost, whatever you may try.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:28.120
Of course, there could be clouds, but they
get just into nothing, they just disappear.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:35.780
If you just try to clean off your innocence
and simplicity.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.711
And don’t think too much, “We should do
like this, we should organize like this, we

00:31:39.711 --> 00:31:41.840
should have this thing” – nothing of the
kind.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.070
Wherever you are, why to think?

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.080
I never think, “Where I will sit?

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.430
What will be My chair?

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:48.460
How will I sleep?

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.060
How will I go there?”

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.060
Nothing.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.570
Just exist.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.810
Just exist.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.490
Everything works out for good, you should
know.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:04.130
Now, if you redden too much on your faces,
you should know you have left Vishuddhis.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.720
So first of all know that you are forgiven
for everything.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.100
Whatever you have done you are forgiven, just
remember.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.480
You are forgiven completely, absolutely hundred
percent.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.820
There’s nothing to feel guilty about, nothing
to feel guilty.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:23.040
And you are loved, you’re looked after,
you’re cared for.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:29.690
Paramchaitanya cares, it’s a caring, caring
government, I should say.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:34.250
It cares for you, looks after you, it manages
so many things.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.570
Unbelievable, it is.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.570
It manages, it works out.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.930
You must have heard about the story about
Cairns, what miracle has taken place, have

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:44.930
you heard?

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:45.930
No?

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:46.930
So … Kay.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.220
Where is Kay?

00:32:48.220 --> 00:33:03.380
I was – Kay, can you tell them?

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:16.390
Please come here.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:25.060
Just come.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:38.070
It’s too much!

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:48.690
[Kay: It was a great blessing for Shri Mataji
to come to Cairns for us, and we had the opportunity

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:53.370
of taking Shri Mataji out to the Great Barrier
Reef.]

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:56.490
Just we decided spontaneously.

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:58.840
[Kay: Very spontaneously!

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:03.110
We delayed Her flight and kept Her from the
Brisbane people for a few hours, just to keep

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:08.120
Her a little more time with us; but we thought
it was important that She put Her attention

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:13.670
on the reef, because there was a lot of problems
happening with this great natural phenomena

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:16.300
off the coast of Cairns.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:22.330
And we took a fast boat out to the reef, and
Shri Mataji graciously agreed to go down into

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.940
a semi-submersible and had a look at the reef.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.680
And just looking at it, all the fish came
around.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:35.530
It was just a miracle to be in the reef with
Her, while She was looking at all this wonderful

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.460
natural phenomena.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:44.360
But within the next day the attention of the
people who had been researching the reef and

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.800
been worried about the Crown-of-Thorns starfish
eating the reef, and all the pollution, suddenly

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.180
they started to realize the reef was regenerating.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:58.450
And all the Crown-of-Thorns starfish were
dying and they didn’t know why, they didn’t

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:02.810
know where they’d come from, and now they
don’t know where they’ve gone!]

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.200
They have written, it’s a mystery!

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.990
[Kay: And they said it’s a mystery.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:13.340
But just a glance from our Mother has just
made everything right.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.000
Jai Shri Mataji!]

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:25.690
But you are not a coral reef, you see, you
are not that; because you see, I cannot, I

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.490
cannot transform you that way.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.900
You have to use your will power.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:35.370
They are all animals, you see, and animals
are under the control of God, that’s why

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:36.680
they are called as “pashu”.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.230
This “pash” means all the bandhan.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:44.540
Under the bandhan of God: is whatever God
wants can do with them, with the, all the

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:49.150
plants, of animals, everyone.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:54.440
But with human beings you can’t do everything.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.040
And also to understand human beings is another
problem.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.180
I don’t know how suddenly they become so
funny.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:05.900
They are all right, going straight, and suddenly
you don’t know what happens to them.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:14.550
So it’s a thing that God has created, and
then adding to that, man has created himself

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:20.210
a little bit more – which is quite a difficult
thing to understand.

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:24.901
So you better understand yourself, why you
do like that; and you have to with your free

00:36:24.901 --> 00:36:27.200
will accept that “I have to do it.”

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:32.170
It is self disciplining and you’ll work
it out, and I’m sure one day you will show

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:39.060
that in Australia we have really achieved
a great height.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.560
Children are wonderful here, no doubt.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:50.870
Then another thing is that we have started
a school in India, with the idea that the

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:57.540
amount you pay only for their food and clothes
per month, that much is about to be charged

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.410
for them.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:05.010
And they’ll have the best education of a
private school, with all other facilities

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.160
like horse-riding, swimming and every sort
of thing.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.580
Music, dancing, everything can be taught to
them.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:16.010
And the amount will be the same, practically
as much as you’ll be spending on one child

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:19.670
per month here, only for keeping them in the
house.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:24.660
So it would be like going to a general school.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.760
Of course, the transport and everything we’ll
look after.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:34.060
Now for this we have – as it is, you have
paid some money, and others have also paid

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.990
– and we have made a good arrangement now.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.060
The school has started.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:43.831
With this kind of a school, the parents can
go and see their children for a month, two

00:37:43.831 --> 00:37:46.870
months, whichever way you like, and stay there
with them.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:52.420
Or if you want you can take them out to Himalayas,
whichever way you want to do.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.869
But till the age of sixteen years I am thinking
the children should not be exposed to this

00:37:56.869 --> 00:38:02.730
funny type of a country where they are just
trying to destroy them, because we have tried

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.730
that also.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:09.370
When the children go back to parents, they
come back with great problems, so it’s difficult.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.760
So now to think “they are my children”
– if you really think they are your children,

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.170
for their benevolence you must sacrifice.

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:22.700
Maybe a little money you might have to sacrifice,
but more this feeling that “they are my

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.700
children.”

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.379
They’re actually Mine.

00:38:25.379 --> 00:38:30.740
And this will really help you a lot.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:36.910
You will be free here to do what you like,
you have more time for meditation, spreading

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:41.300
Sahaja Yoga – because we are now on sort
of a warpath.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:48.180
And we have to make these children so good
that wherever they go they will not take to

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.720
drugs, they will not take to bad things.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.580
On the contrary, they’ll be very great Sahaja
yogis.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.430
Maybe we might start a university later.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:58.200
But just up to sixteen years, it’s guaranteed.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.510
So now we have started for only, I think,
seven-year-old children a school now near

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:07.230
Himalaya; and also now we are going to bring
it down.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:11.310
But now after three years or so we’ll be
starting school for all classes.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:16.420
For all classes we’ll be starting in a big
way, and we’ll be having best teachers and

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.230
best timings, and we’ll look after them.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:24.640
Only thing is that if the Cambridge University
accepts then we’ll have the Cambridge University

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.800
affiliation, because Indian standards are
too high, very high.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.070
They have to work really very hard for that.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.330
I would prefer Cambridge better.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.500
So they might agree to do that for us.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:41.150
That’s how our children can achieve a better
understanding of things, and they have more

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:42.840
time for other things to do.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.140
So, so many things we are going to combine
there.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:50.520
Basic education of Gandhiji I am going to
introduce into that, where children know so

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:57.860
much about the trees, about the plants, about
animals, about fishes, about the surroundings

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:01.940
in which they live, about the Mother Earth,
about ecological problems and things like

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:02.940
that.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.060
And we have to create really great leaders
out of them.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:09.710
So it is for you to decide now the children
that you want to send there.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:15.620
You can have children up to seven years here,
or six years here for your primary classes,

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.360
but not for your high schools.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.050
But primary classes also we have.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:25.050
If you want to send your children for primary
classes we have that also, that we can look

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:27.220
after those children who are for primary classes.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:32.180
And there will be leave for the children for
two months or three months, I think, for which

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:36.310
you can come there, or you can take them anywhere
you feel like.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:40.110
But I would not advise you to bring them back
here because it’s too much of an exposure,

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:42.500
and you know what’s happening to your children.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:47.210
They’ll have to learn how to respect parents,
respect everything; and to get the intrinsic

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:52.810
value of everything properly evaluated in
their minds, so that they do not become stupid.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.940
I’m sure this will work out very well.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:07.920
I have seen some children in Rome: they have
become so sensible, so developed, so beautiful.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.950
So money-wise also we might have to cut down
little expenses of yours, doesn’t matter;

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:15.120
for your children you have to do something.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.971
That’s the minimum they have worked it out.

00:41:17.971 --> 00:41:23.390
They said that per month it will be about
three hundred dollars for a child, inclusive

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:27.300
of clothes, food, transport, everything, books,
everything.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:31.860
You don’t have to worry for their expenses
at all.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:37.580
You could give them some other clothes, but
they’ll have all their uniforms done by

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:44.060
them, books, shoes, everything will be done
in that amount, and education of every kind.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:48.560
All kinds of arts, crafts, depending on the
aptitude of the child.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.270
And you’ll see, they will be something very
unique children.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.690
So think it over.

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:58.940
And in that there is a lot of work entailed,
and some people are working it out.

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.110
I’ll be getting some people from here also.

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:13.380
And the whole process will be under My control,
so you don’t have to worry.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:34.020
So now, I hope I’ll be coming next year
again.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:38.510
But for next year – I mean of course, not
this year – but next year we have decided

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:43.410
that it would be better to come here in the
month of April or May; because May is a better

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:47.210
month here than March, and April is quite
hot.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:50.400
So what do you say, April or May?

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.400
May.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.400
May, all right.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:43:01.110
But May, I can only come of fifth of May.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:13.240
After, I said, fifth of May, because we’ll
have one Sahasrara Day there and one here.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:19.970
And we can work it out that way to come by
May, so we can have one month of May spent

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:20.970
here.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:21.970
I would like to spend more time.

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:27.810
But you must not have any more groups, quarrels,
fighting, problems with husband and wife.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:32.010
I mean sometimes I feel, why did I marry them
to create these problems?

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:37.050
They were all right without marriages!

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:41.520
So all these petty things should not be there.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.980
You should all be big, great people.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:49.060
I would like to come and see you here in your
ashrams and things; I would like to know what

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.870
you have been doing, what creative work you
have been doing.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.840
It’s beautiful things you can do.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840
All right?

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.420
So with that hope, tomorrow we’ll have this
Birthday Puja.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.579
And everybody is quite jealous of you that
I’m having My birthday here!

00:44:01.579 --> 00:44:20.060
I love you Australians very much, and you
have to also love yourself and have proper

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.440
value about yourself.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:28.880
Don’t fritter away your lives, don’t waste
them on nonsensical things, that’s very

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880
precious.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.940
If you were not precious, you would not have
come to Sahaja Yoga, remember that.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.640
You would have been by now in some pub!

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.600
All right.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.010
Now, so few things we have here.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:54.280
Now, can you read out the lists …? [Hindi]
Come along.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.140
This ….

00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:18.280
You see, they told Me not to bring anything,
and because there is Customs, I think that

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:25.370
the Customs torture My life for nothing at
all.

00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:28.540
There are Customs, this thing, that thing.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:33.960
So I’m thankful to Mr Gupta that he could
manage to bring some things for you.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:40.600
And I could only buy something in the duty-free
shop for you.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.200
[Hindi]

00:45:42.200 --> 00:46:01.570
So first of all there’s a present for [Hindi]
… One for Stephen.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:22.520
These fountain pens are given to the leaders
so that they should write a letter to Me!

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:37.340
Brian, Mr Brian.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:47:07.590
Now, others .… Cairns …. It’s all right,
I don’t read it.

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:19.980
It’s all right … Melbourne … It’s
all right.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:25.100
So this is Perth.

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:31.180
[Hindi] Brisbane.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:36.620
Brisbane is not here.

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:43.510
We’ll keep it for Brisbane.What else?

00:47:51.072 --> 00:47:53.062
Canberra is not here?

00:47:53.062 --> 00:47:54.962
All right, keep it.

00:47:54.962 --> 00:47:56.492
Who else?

00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:02.589
Adelaide.

00:48:15.654 --> 00:48:20.004
For Adelaide, we should try still.

00:48:19.984 --> 00:48:25.894
I think it will work out now, things are better.

00:48:25.884 --> 00:48:27.536
Things are much better.

00:48:27.534 --> 00:48:29.056
It will work out.

00:48:29.054 --> 00:48:33.216
[Yogi: We have given You fifty-four macadamia
nut trees, for Your house in Prathisthan … for

00:48:33.204 --> 00:48:35.006
You to take back to India.]

00:48:35.125 --> 00:48:36.101
With Me?

00:48:36.085 --> 00:48:39.301
[Yogi: Yes, from the Adelaide collective,
for Your birthday.]

00:48:39.391 --> 00:48:40.961
Ah, I don’t think I can.

00:48:41.011 --> 00:48:45.941
But what you can do is to send them with these
people when they come.

00:48:45.941 --> 00:48:53.841
They can be kept here waiting?

00:48:53.831 --> 00:48:56.839
There’s somewhere here, and they can bring
it when they come for the Ganapatipule, all

00:48:56.851 --> 00:48:57.851
right?

00:48:57.973 --> 00:48:58.989
For the tour.

00:48:59.013 --> 00:48:59.889
All right?

00:48:59.913 --> 00:49:01.529
May God bless you.

00:49:01.543 --> 00:49:03.263
Thank you.

00:49:11.503 --> 00:49:13.213
All right.

00:49:13.213 --> 00:49:14.213
[Hindi]

00:49:14.213 --> 00:49:31.253
So we start giving saris to ladies who looked
after Me ... Canberra.

00:49:31.253 --> 00:49:44.753
So she’s not come as yet?

00:49:44.753 --> 00:49:49.263
All right.

00:50:07.258 --> 00:50:13.418
Lyn, is she here?

00:50:13.418 --> 00:50:21.148
Lyn from Brisbane … Cheryl?

00:50:21.148 --> 00:50:29.598
… Sandya Sapate … Jo?

00:50:29.598 --> 00:50:40.858
Jo from Perth … Kay.

00:50:40.858 --> 00:50:49.298
Kay from Canberra.

00:50:49.298 --> 00:51:13.448
Now we have shirts for the boys, of leaders
of all the – what do you call it? – ashrams;

00:51:13.498 --> 00:51:16.398
so you read the name.

00:51:16.408 --> 00:51:17.718
And now you all

00:51:17.738 --> 00:51:22.728
should try it, whichever fits you, and I don’t
know!

00:51:25.468 --> 00:51:29.548
First do it, first you people do it, all right.

00:51:31.883 --> 00:51:34.717
Come along, Cairns, come along.

00:51:34.783 --> 00:51:35.647
Select.

00:51:35.707 --> 00:51:37.257
Whichever fits you.

00:51:37.395 --> 00:51:40.485
These are all loose ones, so they’ll fit
anyone … Good … All right, take any one.

00:51:40.539 --> 00:51:42.179
Looks nice – beautiful!

00:51:42.259 --> 00:51:44.279
All right ….

00:51:44.239 --> 00:51:46.259
With embroidery!

00:51:47.769 --> 00:51:50.119
... May God bless you.

00:52:02.461 --> 00:52:06.511
Take whichever you like.

00:54:57.189 --> 00:54:59.759
That’s a good one!

00:55:00.033 --> 00:55:09.763
… Of course, Burwood.

00:55:09.763 --> 00:55:13.501
What about the New Zealand people?

00:55:13.533 --> 00:55:26.693
Auckland ... All right.

00:55:36.093 --> 00:55:52.299
That’s fine ... All right, take it up …

00:56:07.843 --> 00:56:11.253
Oh, blue?

00:57:01.032 --> 00:57:12.299
You like green … So Melbourne has no, because
– Melbourne has no ashram so far.

00:57:12.302 --> 00:57:12.830
Yes.

00:57:12.792 --> 00:57:15.040
So they have to have ashram.

00:57:19.489 --> 00:57:34.629
This is a special gift for Mr Stephen from
the leader of Hariyana, Mr Gupta, who has

00:57:34.629 --> 00:57:46.729
been so kind to bring all these things through
your Customs.

00:57:46.729 --> 00:58:05.779
So now we should disperse, I think, and tomorrow is there’s puja.

00:58:05.779 --> 00:58:15.289
If we want to start it’s about eleven o’clock,
but try to be there, make preparations, I’ll

00:58:15.289 --> 00:58:17.579
be ready here to come.

00:58:17.579 --> 00:58:23.429
I’ll be ready, very ready to come there,
but the problem is sometimes it’s not ready.

00:58:23.429 --> 00:58:26.529
So we have told everybody eleven o’clock
we are starting the puja.

00:58:26.529 --> 00:58:33.399
But let’s see how you do it, because the
preparation takes so much time.

00:58:33.399 --> 00:58:35.117
All right?

00:58:35.099 --> 00:58:37.487
May God bless.

00:58:38.877 --> 00:58:43.077
I gave it today because tomorrow is My birthday;
I’m not supposed to give any presents on

00:58:43.057 --> 00:58:45.799
My birthday!

00:58:53.597 --> 00:58:57.437
(So finish it off now?)

00:58:57.473 --> 00:59:03.713
Good night, everybody.

00:59:03.743 --> 00:59:07.063
Sleep early!

00:59:06.603 --> 00:59:15.615
Hello, hello, how are you?

00:59:15.683 --> 00:59:19.736
[Child: My father’s here.]

00:59:20.353 --> 00:59:25.333
Which one?

00:59:33.463 --> 00:59:45.893
… Deep, deep, deep sleep, eh?

00:59:45.893 --> 00:59:53.363
What’s your name?

00:59:53.363 --> 00:59:55.843
[Shridhara.]

00:59:55.843 --> 00:59:57.403
Shridhara, eh?

00:59:57.442 --> 00:59:59.743
And you are really Shridhara!

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:02.393
He’s very good at acting!

01:00:02.393 --> 01:00:08.873
All these children can be really trained up
so well, as they are born-realized.

01:00:08.873 --> 01:00:19.763
So you will come to India to study?

01:00:19.763 --> 01:00:23.843
To ride horses?

01:00:23.843 --> 01:00:26.563
…. Yes, yes.

01:00:26.563 --> 01:00:46.573
You don’t have to wear in India, there is
no need, but we can get you some hats also

01:00:46.573 --> 01:00:49.452
… They’ll fit you all right.

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:54.833
They make hats for every size of head!

01:00:58.213 --> 01:00:58.950
All right.

01:00:59.263 --> 01:01:02.184
May God bless you.
