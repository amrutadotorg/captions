00:10.300 --> 00:13.500
Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Eve of Birthday Puja

00:13.500 --> 00:15.510
Sydney, Australia
March 20th, 1990

04:00.720 --> 04:04.390
So My tour of Australia has come to an end.

04:04.390 --> 04:09.180
Today is a day I can say it’s all very well
done.

04:09.180 --> 04:16.360
We have had very good response; I didn’t
expect that much everywhere.

04:16.360 --> 04:23.240
It was tremendous and very great things have
happened, some miracles also, during this

04:23.240 --> 04:25.020
visit.

04:25.020 --> 04:35.950
And one has to know that Sahaja yogis have
to be with great potential manifesting.

04:35.950 --> 04:43.870
If they are, then it triggers very well; otherwise
I cannot work out.

04:43.870 --> 04:50.930
For that we have to understand that in Sahaja
Yoga there’s no sacrifice of any kind.

04:50.930 --> 04:54.570
Don’t have to sacrifice anything, it’s
all the time blessings throughout.

04:54.570 --> 04:59.420
You don’t have to sacrifice anything, and
you don’t have to suffer also anything – nothing

04:59.420 --> 05:01.780
of the kind.

05:01.780 --> 05:07.370
I have told you about how My father was in
jail, My mother was in jail and how many times,

05:07.370 --> 05:14.300
and how we suffered during the war of independence.

05:14.300 --> 05:20.590
We lost everything, all our properties, everything,
for the war of independence only.

05:20.590 --> 05:28.210
But this is the independence, the freedom
of an absolute nature: not only for you but

05:28.210 --> 05:31.530
for the whole world, for your children, for
everyone.

05:31.530 --> 05:33.290
It’s a tremendous work.

05:33.290 --> 05:37.210
It’s a very great achievement.

05:37.210 --> 05:43.240
In the history of spirituality, in the history
of the world this is the greatest thing that

05:43.240 --> 05:48.310
has happened, is that people are transformed
into a new awareness.

05:48.310 --> 05:51.020
Perhaps you are not aware of it.

05:51.020 --> 05:56.850
And we take it for granted, we don’t understand
the importance of it; and we get lost into

05:56.850 --> 06:02.140
smaller, smaller things and very wasteful
things which are of no value.

06:02.140 --> 06:07.270
How are these things will be going into the
history, you must understand that.

06:07.270 --> 06:11.070
And where do you stand in that history?

06:11.070 --> 06:14.940
What will you be called?

06:14.940 --> 06:17.490
So now first of all there were problems with
the leaders.

06:17.490 --> 06:18.620
All right.

06:18.620 --> 06:20.910
But there were some who stuck on to it.

06:20.910 --> 06:23.810
They didn’t give it up.

06:23.810 --> 06:28.770
They did not give it up because the leaders
were bad.

06:28.770 --> 06:32.140
Nobody wrote to Me, all right, but they stuck
on.

06:32.140 --> 06:41.000
But those who went away, why didn’t they
write to Me why they went away?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.850
This is an escape from reality.

06:42.850 --> 06:49.360
This is an escape, to say that there was something
wrong with the the ashram people, there was

06:49.360 --> 06:53.890
something wrong with the leaders – of course,
it was.

06:53.890 --> 06:55.920
But you should have written to Me – why
didn’t you write to Me?

06:55.920 --> 07:06.310
Why did you take such decisions on your own,
and just left the Sahaja Yoga into lurch?

07:06.310 --> 07:11.620
We have to be people of quality, otherwise
Sahaja Yoga won’t work out.

07:11.620 --> 07:19.240
It’s not meant for people who are mediocres.

07:19.240 --> 07:23.290
If there are few, doesn’t matter; but there
have to be people of quality, that is one

07:23.290 --> 07:24.730
thing for sure.

07:24.730 --> 07:29.780
Now I have seen that everywhere people have
taken here a view that it’s better to have

07:29.780 --> 07:30.780
separate houses.

07:30.780 --> 07:37.730
I mean, this is another absurd view: from
where it has come into your heads, I don’t

07:37.730 --> 07:38.730
know.

07:38.730 --> 07:44.410
Absolutely absurd, against Sahaj, it’s most
asahaj view.

07:44.410 --> 07:47.240
Today only I was reading, five old ladies
were killed by one man, because they were

07:47.240 --> 07:52.750
living alone in every house.

07:52.750 --> 07:59.560
Such violence, such horrible atmosphere everywhere.

07:59.560 --> 08:04.090
Even for security it’s better that you live
together, at least eight people, ten people

08:04.090 --> 08:05.430
together.

08:05.430 --> 08:12.580
There’s no sacrifice in it, there’s no
sacrifice.

08:12.580 --> 08:16.890
On the contrary if you live together as I’ve
told you, you save money, your children are

08:16.890 --> 08:21.879
looked after; if somebody’s pregnant she’s
looked after, there’s somebody to look after

08:21.879 --> 08:24.559
you.

08:24.559 --> 08:26.369
But what is the gain of having another house,
I don’t understand.

08:26.369 --> 08:36.800
You have to work much harder, pay much more,
but a kind of a ego satisfaction is there.

08:36.800 --> 08:42.129
And then they develop problems, I have seen:
we’ve got cancer, we’ve got heart attacks,

08:42.129 --> 08:45.709
we’ve got this, “my son has run away”,
that has happened, that has happened.

08:45.709 --> 08:51.230
All this arbitrary behavior, and I am supposed
to be sort of responsible for everything.

08:51.230 --> 08:56.430
It’s a complete liability, once somebody
comes to Sahaja Yoga, then he is a liability

08:56.430 --> 08:57.430
on us.

08:57.430 --> 09:03.670
But he has no responsibilities and he has
no duties – only I have.

09:03.670 --> 09:05.799
That’s not proper.

09:05.799 --> 09:12.999
So now I have to tell you today very frankly
that you all have to live together, at least

09:12.999 --> 09:17.200
eight to ten people in a place.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.629
And don’t fight, and don’t create groups.

09:21.629 --> 09:25.909
Group-making is a very wrong thing.

09:25.909 --> 09:30.629
Before making any group you write to Me.

09:30.629 --> 09:36.320
You are all welcome to write to Me, and I’ll
attend to that letter if it is worth attending,

09:36.320 --> 09:40.010
because I know everything through vibrations.

09:40.010 --> 09:42.070
Don’t talk against each other.

09:42.070 --> 09:46.029
It’s a murmuring souls, and Christ has said
such people will go to hell.

09:46.029 --> 09:50.129
It’s not hell outside, I tell you, it will
be the hell here.

09:50.129 --> 09:52.619
It’s hell here.

09:52.619 --> 09:54.020
I have seen people suffering.

09:54.020 --> 09:57.480
I have been so frightened, you have no idea.

09:57.480 --> 10:01.249
Don’t play about with Sahaja Yoga at all.

10:01.249 --> 10:04.969
I’m just warning you, it’s a very serious
thing.

10:04.969 --> 10:10.770
People have got heart attacks, have got accidents,
have got cancers, all kinds of things, and

10:10.770 --> 10:15.299
really I am quite frightened that you people
don’t realize that there is another force

10:15.299 --> 10:16.849
working it out.

10:16.849 --> 10:18.589
Don’t take arbitrary decisions.

10:18.589 --> 10:21.329
You are very safe in Sahaja Yoga.

10:21.329 --> 10:25.360
Stay in Sahaja Yoga, grow in Sahaja Yog, enjoy
in Sahaja Yog.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.450
Everything is there available for you.

10:28.450 --> 10:33.950
And you don’t have to do anything else except
that keep together: it’s a collective happening.

10:33.950 --> 10:35.960
It’s a collective.

10:35.960 --> 10:44.510
If you are not in the collective, the Divine
is not interested in you at all – you are

10:44.510 --> 10:47.599
out of it.

10:47.599 --> 10:54.659
Only the collective gets the power, only the
collective is magnetic.

10:54.659 --> 10:59.999
Single person who lives away from collective
all the time, is something wrong with that

10:59.999 --> 11:00.999
person.

11:00.999 --> 11:03.950
If you cannot be collective, there’s something
wrong.

11:03.950 --> 11:08.029
Such a person should sit down and find out
what’s wrong with that person, must get

11:08.029 --> 11:11.929
it corrected, absolutely corrected.

11:11.929 --> 11:16.820
And see to it that you are all right; because
this is for your benevolence.

11:16.820 --> 11:24.270
You want to lead a happy, healthy, good life,
then be sensible, have some wisdom about it.

11:24.270 --> 11:29.189
And so some people who have been negative
are still negative, and just thinking on the

11:29.189 --> 11:31.049
same lines.

11:31.049 --> 11:38.320
So it’s high time all of you have to work
it out sensibly, and understanding.

11:38.320 --> 11:49.349
There are leaders because I have to have communication,
that’s all.

11:49.349 --> 11:51.219
And they will communicate to Me about you
people.

11:51.219 --> 11:53.390
If there are problems, they will try to solve
you.

11:53.390 --> 11:58.749
If they cannot solve it, they’ll write to
Me and I’ll have to see to it.

11:58.749 --> 12:04.779
There’s not going to be any regimentation
in Sahaja Yoga at all; it is a thing of love.

12:04.779 --> 12:06.360
But you must have love for yourself.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.149
I mean, you should be self-disciplined.

12:09.149 --> 12:14.129
Now imagine how I must have felt: I have come
here, I’ve worked so hard for so many times

12:14.129 --> 12:17.730
I have been here, and when I come here what
I find, everything is broken down.

12:17.730 --> 12:21.850
It’s so sad – I’ve worked so hard.

12:21.850 --> 12:28.479
But next time I am going to see you all settled
down in proper ashrams, in different place.

12:28.479 --> 12:33.010
Not for your own comfort you should think,
but if you have an ashram you put a center

12:33.010 --> 12:34.010
there.

12:34.010 --> 12:36.430
Every place you can have a center.

12:36.430 --> 12:41.330
In Bombay, I don’t know, we have eighteen
or twenty-one centers, in Bombay.

12:41.330 --> 12:46.000
That’s how it increases, and improves it.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.700
You have centers everywhere, so it’s available
to people all the time.

12:49.700 --> 12:54.640
You would talk about it, meet every day, evening
time you all can meet, talk to each other;

12:54.640 --> 12:58.489
and you have one day in a week somewhere,
in a school or something, big place where

12:58.489 --> 12:59.909
you all meet.

12:59.909 --> 13:04.049
The more you meet, the more there is rapport,
the more there is collectivity, the more there

13:04.049 --> 13:08.659
are blessings for each one of you, and for
all of you.

13:08.659 --> 13:14.940
It absolutely simultaneously works out; whilst
when there is no collectivity – no.

13:14.940 --> 13:18.910
When there is collectivity, everything works
out.

13:18.910 --> 13:21.860
Everything is available to you.

13:21.860 --> 13:26.799
So don’t try to break the collectivity by
forming any groups or anything – nothing

13:26.799 --> 13:30.060
of the kind.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.910
If you find anything wrong you have to write
to Me.

13:32.910 --> 13:39.320
But it’s everybody’s responsibility is
to sustain the collectivity, to support it,

13:39.320 --> 13:40.989
to help it.

13:40.989 --> 13:46.700
If you find that somebody is talking about
somebody else, then you say, “No, no, he

13:46.700 --> 13:48.760
was talking very good about you.

13:48.760 --> 13:54.080
Why are you talking ill about that person?”

13:54.080 --> 13:59.200
This is what, this is what Christ has said,
that these are peacemakers.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.560
But somebody says something about someone
– oh, then you go into, “Ho, ho, ho, that

14:03.560 --> 14:06.610
one is like this,” then another one.

14:06.610 --> 14:13.799
We are not like common people, we are not
ordinary people, we are saints.

14:13.799 --> 14:21.010
We are to respect each other, to love each
other, to understand and enjoy each other.

14:21.010 --> 14:24.359
What will the children say tomorrow?

14:24.359 --> 14:28.210
So nobody should get away with this idea that
we can have separate houses, live separately

14:28.210 --> 14:29.870
and we are all right.

14:29.870 --> 14:33.680
Better take out all My photographs from them;
they have no business.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.840
At least eight persons should be there in
one household, at least, minimum.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.049
Eight to ten people is a good idea.

14:40.049 --> 14:44.510
There’s no safety, there’s no progress,
there’s nothing in such houses where they

14:44.510 --> 14:46.110
live alone very nicely.

14:46.110 --> 14:51.560
Morning till evening they are cooking, cleaning,
sweeping, swabbing, looking after the car,

14:51.560 --> 14:59.109
locking the house – what else are they doing?

14:59.109 --> 15:04.710
It’s so boring to be alone, it’s extremely
boring.

15:04.710 --> 15:08.950
Now I have already told you very clearly that
we have to live together.

15:08.950 --> 15:14.680
And let the children know each other, know
everyone, they should know about their friendship.

15:14.680 --> 15:20.460
And you know, it is so nice the way they love
each other and the way they talk to each other,

15:20.460 --> 15:24.440
and about their aunties and uncles they talk
so sweetly.

15:24.440 --> 15:29.500
So many aunties and uncles to have is something
so remarkable; to have so many nephews and

15:29.500 --> 15:34.989
nieces all over.

15:34.989 --> 15:38.719
And unless and until you have that kind of
a feeling, it won’t work out.

15:38.719 --> 15:42.169
Then if somebody finds something wrong with
your child and tells you, don’t get angry

15:42.169 --> 15:44.839
for that – thank him.

15:44.839 --> 15:45.839
Try to improve your child.

15:45.839 --> 15:49.060
The improvement of your child is for the benevolence
of the child.

15:49.060 --> 15:50.060
Not to feel bad: “this is my child.”

15:50.060 --> 15:51.440
This “my” business has to go a little
bit; then I will come.

15:51.440 --> 15:59.490
If there is “my house”, “my children”,
“my car”, “my” this, this has to go

15:59.490 --> 16:00.770
away.

16:00.770 --> 16:14.299
Let us see how we start diverting our energies
to a collective beauty, collective love, collective

16:14.299 --> 16:15.940
understanding.

16:15.940 --> 16:19.730
And if it is not, there’s something wrong
with you, take it from Me, something wrong.

16:19.730 --> 16:25.609
So either you are right-sided or left-sided:
find out and just get yourself cleared out.

16:25.609 --> 16:32.170
Treat it out yourself, and you will understand
that there was something wrong with you, nothing

16:32.170 --> 16:37.529
wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

16:37.529 --> 16:44.220
All such ideas are going to completely blast
Sahaja Yoga and finish it off.

16:44.220 --> 16:52.469
They are selfish, self-oriented, absolutely
out-of-date ideas for Sahaja Yoga.

16:52.469 --> 16:59.359
You can have one room each other, for each
one of them and you can stay together, and

16:59.359 --> 17:02.419
you can have somebody as a leader, whomsoever
you want.

17:02.419 --> 17:07.419
If you want we can do rotation of leaders
later on if you like that, can be done also.

17:07.419 --> 17:10.930
But still I would say that unless and until
there is something wrong with the leader,

17:10.930 --> 17:16.919
it’s not proper to remove such a leader.

17:16.919 --> 17:19.210
But whatever you suggest, I don’t mind,
but we have to have someone who is looking

17:19.210 --> 17:26.770
after you, and informing Me about it.

17:26.770 --> 17:32.900
But the wife of the leader is never a leader,
understand that, it’s only the leader is

17:32.900 --> 17:33.900
the leader.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.760
Whether it’s the husband or a wife of a
leader is not a leader, and she should never

17:36.760 --> 17:38.190
behave like that.

17:38.190 --> 17:45.510
She has to be very motherly, kindly, and all
the time looking after all the people in a

17:45.510 --> 17:49.779
more gentler way than the husband himself.

17:49.779 --> 17:54.239
That’s the sign of a good wife of a leader.

17:54.239 --> 18:02.650
We have some, we have such women, and wherever
there have been good ashrams, Sahaja Yoga

18:02.650 --> 18:04.450
has prospered.

18:04.450 --> 18:08.089
It has gone up to the governments, it has
gone up to the intellectuals, it has gone

18:08.089 --> 18:14.700
up to such areas where we would never expect
it, anywhere there has been.

18:14.700 --> 18:26.560
And most of the people now are in the ashrams,
in the whole world.

18:26.560 --> 18:33.830
I hope you all understand the importance of
it.

18:33.830 --> 18:40.130
Anything goes wrong with anyone here, immediately
the telephone comes, that something has gone

18:40.130 --> 18:41.700
wrong with such and such person is sick.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.359
Then I can tell you what is to be done, how
to get that person cured.

18:44.359 --> 18:49.589
But supposing you are in some other house
…. It happened like this, one fellow was

18:49.589 --> 18:52.169
like that and he met with an accident.

18:52.169 --> 18:53.700
Met with an accident, nobody knew.

18:53.700 --> 18:58.950
He was lying in the hospital – when he came
to his consciousness he called for somebody,

18:58.950 --> 19:04.209
then they told Me.

19:04.209 --> 19:08.919
It’s like one family, it’s like one body.

19:08.919 --> 19:11.320
If something hurts here, every – the whole
body knows.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.520
You must know how many there are with us.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.690
You feel so strong and happy.

19:17.690 --> 19:23.239
But first of all you must develop that rapport,
you must develop that love, must develop that

19:23.239 --> 19:24.409
personality.

19:24.409 --> 19:29.200
Now those who are left-sided, I’ve already
told them what treatment they have to take,

19:29.200 --> 19:31.099
and take it seriously.

19:31.099 --> 19:35.750
Left-sidedness should not be allowed to grow
at all – I tell you, it’s very dangerous.

19:35.750 --> 19:40.630
All these horrible diseases that you have
heard of, all of them, one and all – say

19:40.630 --> 19:49.729
epilepsy, mental derangements, you can say
cancer, all psychosomatic, this myelitis,

19:49.729 --> 19:57.239
then there are other diseases like AIDS, all
that – attack only left-sided people.

19:57.239 --> 20:01.220
Anybody who has left side, immediately try
to get rid of that left side.

20:01.220 --> 20:06.200
The right side shows so everybody knows, and
you can throw away such a person, or you can

20:06.200 --> 20:07.200
correct it.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.299
But the left side be very careful, don’t
play about with the left side.

20:10.299 --> 20:14.830
Left side is very dangerous.

20:14.830 --> 20:20.719
To avoid that, don’t mix up with people
who are mentally deranged, don’t go to the

20:20.719 --> 20:27.370
hospitals where such people live, don’t
try to cure people who are left-sided – they

20:27.370 --> 20:30.680
can be all cured on My photograph.

20:30.680 --> 20:37.919
And if somebody starts telling too much about
their woes and all that, just shut your ears.

20:37.919 --> 20:46.450
All this left side comes from a kind of a
self-indulgence, in the sense that you start

20:46.450 --> 20:52.010
thinking you are so miserable, you are so
unhappy, you are no good, and all that.

20:52.010 --> 20:57.700
So the right-sided are over-confident, the
left-sided are diffident.

20:57.700 --> 21:02.000
But they’re, because they’re diffident,
you see, all kinds of viruses can attack.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.950
And these viruses are the thing which bring
forth diseases which cannot be cured.

21:06.950 --> 21:08.960
So be careful on that point.

21:08.960 --> 21:13.140
The right-sided people trouble others.

21:13.140 --> 21:18.490
The left-sided trouble themselves, and the
right-sided trouble others.

21:18.490 --> 21:24.410
They try to show off, they want to – just
think they’re too much.

21:24.410 --> 21:30.730
First sign of a right-sided is that he starts
suddenly shouting, or giving lectures also,

21:30.730 --> 21:33.020
that’s another one.

21:33.020 --> 21:38.560
Thirdly, he tries to show off that he’s
a very big, great Sahaja yogi.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.770
There’s nobody great in Sahaja Yoga, everybody
is just the same.

21:41.770 --> 21:47.810
Just like all fingers are the same, every
cell is the same, everybody is the same.

21:47.810 --> 21:54.650
So nobody higher and lower, there’s no hierarchy
in Sahaja Yoga.

21:54.650 --> 22:00.740
Everybody must understand that we are all
one, part and parcel of one body, and we don’t

22:00.740 --> 22:05.310
have to consider ourself higher or lower.

22:05.310 --> 22:12.590
So there are so many ways of expression of
these boastful, right-sided people.

22:12.590 --> 22:18.020
And we can pull their legs – all right,
allowed!

22:18.020 --> 22:23.220
If somebody boasts too much you just pull
their legs, that’s allowed.

22:23.220 --> 22:28.700
That’s how in India nobody can have ego,
because from very childhood if somebody tries

22:28.700 --> 22:32.780
to show off, pull their legs.

22:32.780 --> 22:35.920
If somebody talks loudly, pull their legs.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.290
If somebody laughs loudly, pull their legs.

22:38.290 --> 22:45.860
I mean, anything somebody tries to do, overdo,
just pull their legs.

22:45.860 --> 22:51.410
So it doesn’t behoove for a Sahaja yogi
to be like that.

22:51.410 --> 22:59.140
Sahaja yogi has to be very dignified; otherwise
why will people come to Sahaja Yoga, if we

22:59.140 --> 23:02.210
are just like them?

23:02.210 --> 23:08.370
We have to be exceptional, isn’t it?

23:08.370 --> 23:19.720
And that’s what is what I call dignified,
loving, affectionate, kind, sweet – that’s

23:19.720 --> 23:25.340
what is the beauty.

23:25.340 --> 23:32.790
So anybody who shouts, screams, gets angry,
full of anger, this thing, bring one pin and

23:32.790 --> 23:38.460
just prick it – allowed!

23:38.460 --> 23:41.300
And if he says anything, it’s to prick your
ego.

23:41.300 --> 23:44.110
Show the pins, you see, like this.

23:44.110 --> 23:53.830
He’ll understand, “All right, this is
what I have.”

23:53.830 --> 24:01.120
So when you make a fun of a person who is
egoist he may not like it; but you show him

24:01.120 --> 24:04.550
a pin, he’ll understand, “Oh God, I have
got it!”

24:04.550 --> 24:07.050
They are quite aware of their ego, they don’t
want to have it.

24:07.050 --> 24:14.040
There was a gentleman from Delhi, his son
wrote to Me saying that “My father says

24:14.040 --> 24:19.930
that he’s not allowed to speak at all, and
he’s feeling very sad about it.”

24:19.930 --> 24:25.250
So in the lecture I said that nobody is allowed
to speak.

24:25.250 --> 24:33.840
After My tape, meditate, stay in that meditative
mood, and go home.

24:33.840 --> 24:38.330
Not that just after meditation, “Oh, what
cake I am going to have?” – all rush to

24:38.330 --> 24:39.330
the kitchen.

24:39.330 --> 24:42.710
So it’s surprising, even Indians are surprised
at it.

24:42.710 --> 24:46.630
India, people don’t get so much to eat,
but they are not hankering so much after food.

24:46.630 --> 24:50.620
Here the first attention is in the kitchen,
all the time they are in the kitchen.

24:50.620 --> 24:55.730
How many times you take your tea is important.

24:55.730 --> 24:57.590
You should count how many times you are in
the kitchen.

24:57.590 --> 25:02.860
I mean, you are still little babies, I tell
you, in that respect.

25:02.860 --> 25:07.840
I don’t think I have ever opened a fridge
to take out even water for Myself – I mean,

25:07.840 --> 25:14.810
since I remember My life, never.

25:14.810 --> 25:19.460
So this hankering after food is also another
funny thing that is.

25:19.460 --> 25:23.400
After meditation people just get up and go
to eat.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.920
You must sit down, meditate.

25:25.920 --> 25:31.950
Now after meditation if people start giving
speeches, then the people are anxious to go

25:31.950 --> 25:39.660
to the kitchen, here’s somebody giving lectures,
so big problem starts between the two.

25:39.660 --> 25:43.470
They don’t like it, because they think,
“Oh, there’s a cake there, there’s something

25:43.470 --> 25:49.000
biryani kept, and here it is this gentleman
is trying to give us a lecture.”

25:49.000 --> 25:50.560
No one likes it.

25:50.560 --> 25:55.210
But it should be something very different,
that we are in meditative mood, how can we

25:55.210 --> 25:57.510
come out of it?

25:57.510 --> 26:01.140
So I’d better tell you a story of Janaka,
which is very important.

26:01.140 --> 26:06.530
He was the one, in the beginning at the time
of Shri Rama, He was the father-in-law of

26:06.530 --> 26:08.759
Shri Rama, His name was Raja Janaka.

26:08.759 --> 26:11.440
And He was a king.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.970
So all the saints used to come and bow to
Him.

26:13.970 --> 26:19.350
And He was a king, He used to live like a
king.

26:19.350 --> 26:24.420
So one fellow, Nachiketa asked his guru, he
said, “What is this, you bow to this Raja?

26:24.420 --> 26:29.520
He has got all the wealth, He has got everything,
wears all the ornaments, He has all pomp and

26:29.520 --> 26:30.520
show.

26:30.520 --> 26:33.230
Why should you, a saint like you, go and bow
to Him?”

26:33.230 --> 26:34.590
He said “He’s videhi.

26:34.590 --> 26:36.300
He’s so detached, He’s videhi.

26:36.300 --> 26:38.350
He doesn’t exist in His body.”

26:38.350 --> 26:39.380
He couldn’t understand.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.440
He said, “All right, I’ll go and see Him.”

26:42.440 --> 26:47.670
So he went and told Him that “I want to
become self-realized, as You are.”

26:47.670 --> 26:50.960
He said, “You ask Me everything; I can give
you, but no self-realization.”

26:50.960 --> 26:55.850
“All right, we’ll see about it,” he
said.

26:55.850 --> 26:57.510
So one day they were having a bath.

26:57.510 --> 27:02.140
He said, “Let’s go to the river, we’ll
have our bath.”

27:02.140 --> 27:07.480
So He took this boy, they were sitting and
having the bath, when some people came and

27:07.480 --> 27:14.850
told that “Your palace is burning, and everybody
is running away.”

27:14.850 --> 27:18.960
So He was still in meditative mood, He wouldn’t
listen.

27:18.960 --> 27:23.450
Then they came back again, shouted, “See
now, Your wife and children all are, have

27:23.450 --> 27:28.940
come out of it and they are all running away,
because the whole thing is getting burned.”

27:28.940 --> 27:31.520
Still He was in meditative mood, least bothered.

27:31.520 --> 27:40.190
Then they said, “Now the fire is coming
this side, and what are You doing?”

27:40.190 --> 27:42.430
So Nachiketa got up and he caught hold of
his clothes.

27:42.430 --> 27:45.610
He thought, “I should wear my clothes at
least, they’ll be burnt.”

27:45.610 --> 27:48.860
He was still meditating.

27:48.860 --> 27:52.400
Then Nachiketa realized that He is videhi.

27:52.400 --> 27:57.790
That’s why Sitaji is called as Vaidehi,
because She is the daughter of a videhi.

27:57.790 --> 27:59.570
And that’s what we have to be.

27:59.570 --> 28:01.900
“Where is our attention?” we should say.

28:01.900 --> 28:05.480
You are meditating, take it deep down into
yourself.

28:05.480 --> 28:08.600
That’s a meditative mood.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.590
Keep yourself there.

28:11.590 --> 28:16.160
And after meditation you just get up silently,
sit for a while.

28:16.160 --> 28:22.571
I think best thing will be to have your food
first and then meditate, if that is so, if

28:22.571 --> 28:24.130
you think that is proper.

28:24.130 --> 28:35.560
But I think if you have to get now into that
new triggering, as I told you, into that new

28:35.560 --> 28:40.950
jumping that we have to do in Sahaja Yoga:
if you have to catch that train, then you

28:40.950 --> 28:42.910
hurry up.

28:42.910 --> 28:45.210
You have to change all these ideas.

28:45.210 --> 28:49.320
You have had many houses, you have had many
wives and many children in your previous life.

28:49.320 --> 28:53.340
You never had your realization – now you
have got it.

28:53.340 --> 29:00.120
So now just every individual, every one of
you should not think of others, think of yourself,

29:00.120 --> 29:06.380
“I have to do it, I have to get it, I have
to work it out.”

29:06.380 --> 29:08.500
This is what you have to do.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.340
“Why should I miss it?”

29:10.340 --> 29:15.930
This is a chance of many lives, the chance
of many lives.

29:15.930 --> 29:22.320
And that’s how you can jump over, and work
it out.

29:22.320 --> 29:30.180
We had lots of people in Australia, and if
they had worried about themselves as to “what

29:30.180 --> 29:31.840
I have done for Sahaja Yoga.”

29:31.840 --> 29:36.000
So in the morning you just decide, what I
am going to do for Sahaja Yog and myself;

29:36.000 --> 29:41.290
in the evening, what have I done for myself,
and what have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

29:41.290 --> 29:45.320
“Myself” doesn’t mean selfishness, but
“for my ascent.”

29:45.320 --> 29:46.320
Every day.

29:46.320 --> 29:49.510
You start a diary to write it down.

29:49.510 --> 29:50.800
You face yourself.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.100
No excuses, nothing.

29:52.100 --> 29:57.540
If you are left behind, what we can do?

29:57.540 --> 30:01.820
We can’t help it.

30:01.820 --> 30:06.440
And that is how you’ll find all kinds of
blessings will come to you.

30:06.440 --> 30:11.560
You’ll be able to save money, you’ll be
able to save time, you’ll get good jobs.

30:11.560 --> 30:18.410
All your problems can be solved if you really
surrender yourself to that Paramachaitanya.

30:18.410 --> 30:20.850
Everything can be done.

30:20.850 --> 30:26.830
But as long as you have this narrow-mindedness
and these narrow ideas about yourself, till

30:26.830 --> 30:29.010
then it won’t work out.

30:29.010 --> 30:34.720
This drop has to become one with the ocean,
then ocean takes over.

30:34.720 --> 30:38.230
And I am sure that can work out.

30:38.230 --> 30:47.070
And you are basically a very good point here,
because you are born on the land of Shri Ganesha.

30:47.070 --> 30:52.870
Basically it’s such an advantage for you,
much more than Russians have.

30:52.870 --> 30:57.550
But Russians, I don’t know how, they have
shot up so well.

30:57.550 --> 31:03.440
It’s an Agnya, it’s a right Agnya where
they have denied Christ, they have denied

31:03.440 --> 31:10.690
all religions, everything, and still they’re
prospering.

31:10.690 --> 31:13.300
So you are very well placed.

31:13.300 --> 31:18.100
And innocence can never be lost, can never
be lost, whatever you may try.

31:18.100 --> 31:28.120
Of course, there could be clouds, but they
get just into nothing, they just disappear.

31:28.120 --> 31:35.780
If you just try to clean off your innocence
and simplicity.

31:35.780 --> 31:39.711
And don’t think too much, “We should do
like this, we should organize like this, we

31:39.711 --> 31:41.840
should have this thing” – nothing of the
kind.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.070
Wherever you are, why to think?

31:44.070 --> 31:46.080
I never think, “Where I will sit?

31:46.080 --> 31:47.430
What will be My chair?

31:47.430 --> 31:48.460
How will I sleep?

31:48.460 --> 31:50.060
How will I go there?”

31:50.060 --> 31:51.060
Nothing.

31:51.060 --> 31:54.570
Just exist.

31:54.570 --> 31:56.810
Just exist.

31:56.810 --> 31:59.490
Everything works out for good, you should
know.

31:59.490 --> 32:04.130
Now, if you redden too much on your faces,
you should know you have left Vishuddhis.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.720
So first of all know that you are forgiven
for everything.

32:06.720 --> 32:10.100
Whatever you have done you are forgiven, just
remember.

32:10.100 --> 32:13.480
You are forgiven completely, absolutely hundred
percent.

32:13.480 --> 32:16.820
There’s nothing to feel guilty about, nothing
to feel guilty.

32:16.820 --> 32:23.040
And you are loved, you’re looked after,
you’re cared for.

32:23.040 --> 32:29.690
Paramchaitanya cares, it’s a caring, caring
government, I should say.

32:29.690 --> 32:34.250
It cares for you, looks after you, it manages
so many things.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.570
Unbelievable, it is.

32:36.570 --> 32:39.570
It manages, it works out.

32:39.570 --> 32:43.930
You must have heard about the story about
Cairns, what miracle has taken place, have

32:43.930 --> 32:44.930
you heard?

32:44.930 --> 32:45.930
No?

32:45.930 --> 32:46.930
So … Kay.

32:46.930 --> 32:48.220
Where is Kay?

32:48.220 --> 33:03.380
I was – Kay, can you tell them?

33:03.380 --> 33:16.390
Please come here.

33:16.390 --> 33:25.060
Just come.

33:25.060 --> 33:38.070
It’s too much!

33:38.070 --> 33:48.690
[Kay: It was a great blessing for Shri Mataji
to come to Cairns for us, and we had the opportunity

33:48.690 --> 33:53.370
of taking Shri Mataji out to the Great Barrier
Reef.]

33:53.370 --> 33:56.490
Just we decided spontaneously.

33:56.490 --> 33:58.840
[Kay: Very spontaneously!

33:58.840 --> 34:03.110
We delayed Her flight and kept Her from the
Brisbane people for a few hours, just to keep

34:03.110 --> 34:08.120
Her a little more time with us; but we thought
it was important that She put Her attention

34:08.120 --> 34:13.670
on the reef, because there was a lot of problems
happening with this great natural phenomena

34:13.670 --> 34:16.300
off the coast of Cairns.

34:16.300 --> 34:22.330
And we took a fast boat out to the reef, and
Shri Mataji graciously agreed to go down into

34:22.330 --> 34:26.940
a semi-submersible and had a look at the reef.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.680
And just looking at it, all the fish came
around.

34:29.680 --> 34:35.530
It was just a miracle to be in the reef with
Her, while She was looking at all this wonderful

34:35.530 --> 34:37.460
natural phenomena.

34:37.460 --> 34:44.360
But within the next day the attention of the
people who had been researching the reef and

34:44.360 --> 34:49.800
been worried about the Crown-of-Thorns starfish
eating the reef, and all the pollution, suddenly

34:49.800 --> 34:53.180
they started to realize the reef was regenerating.

34:53.180 --> 34:58.450
And all the Crown-of-Thorns starfish were
dying and they didn’t know why, they didn’t

34:58.450 --> 35:02.810
know where they’d come from, and now they
don’t know where they’ve gone!]

35:02.810 --> 35:05.200
They have written, it’s a mystery!

35:05.200 --> 35:07.990
[Kay: And they said it’s a mystery.

35:07.990 --> 35:13.340
But just a glance from our Mother has just
made everything right.

35:13.340 --> 35:16.000
Jai Shri Mataji!]

35:16.000 --> 35:25.690
But you are not a coral reef, you see, you
are not that; because you see, I cannot, I

35:25.690 --> 35:27.490
cannot transform you that way.

35:27.490 --> 35:29.900
You have to use your will power.

35:29.900 --> 35:35.370
They are all animals, you see, and animals
are under the control of God, that’s why

35:35.370 --> 35:36.680
they are called as “pashu”.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.230
This “pash” means all the bandhan.

35:39.230 --> 35:44.540
Under the bandhan of God: is whatever God
wants can do with them, with the, all the

35:44.540 --> 35:49.150
plants, of animals, everyone.

35:49.150 --> 35:54.440
But with human beings you can’t do everything.

35:54.440 --> 35:58.040
And also to understand human beings is another
problem.

35:58.040 --> 36:01.180
I don’t know how suddenly they become so
funny.

36:01.180 --> 36:05.900
They are all right, going straight, and suddenly
you don’t know what happens to them.

36:05.900 --> 36:14.550
So it’s a thing that God has created, and
then adding to that, man has created himself

36:14.550 --> 36:20.210
a little bit more – which is quite a difficult
thing to understand.

36:20.210 --> 36:24.901
So you better understand yourself, why you
do like that; and you have to with your free

36:24.901 --> 36:27.200
will accept that “I have to do it.”

36:27.200 --> 36:32.170
It is self disciplining and you’ll work
it out, and I’m sure one day you will show

36:32.170 --> 36:39.060
that in Australia we have really achieved
a great height.

36:39.060 --> 36:42.560
Children are wonderful here, no doubt.

36:42.560 --> 36:50.870
Then another thing is that we have started
a school in India, with the idea that the

36:50.870 --> 36:57.540
amount you pay only for their food and clothes
per month, that much is about to be charged

36:57.540 --> 37:00.410
for them.

37:00.410 --> 37:05.010
And they’ll have the best education of a
private school, with all other facilities

37:05.010 --> 37:08.160
like horse-riding, swimming and every sort
of thing.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.580
Music, dancing, everything can be taught to
them.

37:10.580 --> 37:16.010
And the amount will be the same, practically
as much as you’ll be spending on one child

37:16.010 --> 37:19.670
per month here, only for keeping them in the
house.

37:19.670 --> 37:24.660
So it would be like going to a general school.

37:24.660 --> 37:27.760
Of course, the transport and everything we’ll
look after.

37:27.760 --> 37:34.060
Now for this we have – as it is, you have
paid some money, and others have also paid

37:34.060 --> 37:36.990
– and we have made a good arrangement now.

37:36.990 --> 37:39.060
The school has started.

37:39.060 --> 37:43.831
With this kind of a school, the parents can
go and see their children for a month, two

37:43.831 --> 37:46.870
months, whichever way you like, and stay there
with them.

37:46.870 --> 37:52.420
Or if you want you can take them out to Himalayas,
whichever way you want to do.

37:52.420 --> 37:56.869
But till the age of sixteen years I am thinking
the children should not be exposed to this

37:56.869 --> 38:02.730
funny type of a country where they are just
trying to destroy them, because we have tried

38:02.730 --> 38:03.730
that also.

38:03.730 --> 38:09.370
When the children go back to parents, they
come back with great problems, so it’s difficult.

38:09.370 --> 38:12.760
So now to think “they are my children”
– if you really think they are your children,

38:12.760 --> 38:17.170
for their benevolence you must sacrifice.

38:17.170 --> 38:22.700
Maybe a little money you might have to sacrifice,
but more this feeling that “they are my

38:22.700 --> 38:23.700
children.”

38:23.700 --> 38:25.379
They’re actually Mine.

38:25.379 --> 38:30.740
And this will really help you a lot.

38:30.740 --> 38:36.910
You will be free here to do what you like,
you have more time for meditation, spreading

38:36.910 --> 38:41.300
Sahaja Yoga – because we are now on sort
of a warpath.

38:41.300 --> 38:48.180
And we have to make these children so good
that wherever they go they will not take to

38:48.180 --> 38:49.720
drugs, they will not take to bad things.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.580
On the contrary, they’ll be very great Sahaja
yogis.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.430
Maybe we might start a university later.

38:55.430 --> 38:58.200
But just up to sixteen years, it’s guaranteed.

38:58.200 --> 39:02.510
So now we have started for only, I think,
seven-year-old children a school now near

39:02.510 --> 39:07.230
Himalaya; and also now we are going to bring
it down.

39:07.230 --> 39:11.310
But now after three years or so we’ll be
starting school for all classes.

39:11.310 --> 39:16.420
For all classes we’ll be starting in a big
way, and we’ll be having best teachers and

39:16.420 --> 39:19.230
best timings, and we’ll look after them.

39:19.230 --> 39:24.640
Only thing is that if the Cambridge University
accepts then we’ll have the Cambridge University

39:24.640 --> 39:28.800
affiliation, because Indian standards are
too high, very high.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.070
They have to work really very hard for that.

39:31.070 --> 39:33.330
I would prefer Cambridge better.

39:33.330 --> 39:35.500
So they might agree to do that for us.

39:35.500 --> 39:41.150
That’s how our children can achieve a better
understanding of things, and they have more

39:41.150 --> 39:42.840
time for other things to do.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.140
So, so many things we are going to combine
there.

39:46.140 --> 39:50.520
Basic education of Gandhiji I am going to
introduce into that, where children know so

39:50.520 --> 39:57.860
much about the trees, about the plants, about
animals, about fishes, about the surroundings

39:57.860 --> 40:01.940
in which they live, about the Mother Earth,
about ecological problems and things like

40:01.940 --> 40:02.940
that.

40:02.940 --> 40:05.060
And we have to create really great leaders
out of them.

40:05.060 --> 40:09.710
So it is for you to decide now the children
that you want to send there.

40:09.710 --> 40:15.620
You can have children up to seven years here,
or six years here for your primary classes,

40:15.620 --> 40:17.360
but not for your high schools.

40:17.360 --> 40:20.050
But primary classes also we have.

40:20.050 --> 40:25.050
If you want to send your children for primary
classes we have that also, that we can look

40:25.050 --> 40:27.220
after those children who are for primary classes.

40:27.220 --> 40:32.180
And there will be leave for the children for
two months or three months, I think, for which

40:32.180 --> 40:36.310
you can come there, or you can take them anywhere
you feel like.

40:36.310 --> 40:40.110
But I would not advise you to bring them back
here because it’s too much of an exposure,

40:40.110 --> 40:42.500
and you know what’s happening to your children.

40:42.500 --> 40:47.210
They’ll have to learn how to respect parents,
respect everything; and to get the intrinsic

40:47.210 --> 40:52.810
value of everything properly evaluated in
their minds, so that they do not become stupid.

40:52.810 --> 40:55.940
I’m sure this will work out very well.

40:55.940 --> 41:07.920
I have seen some children in Rome: they have
become so sensible, so developed, so beautiful.

41:07.920 --> 41:11.950
So money-wise also we might have to cut down
little expenses of yours, doesn’t matter;

41:11.950 --> 41:15.120
for your children you have to do something.

41:15.120 --> 41:17.971
That’s the minimum they have worked it out.

41:17.971 --> 41:23.390
They said that per month it will be about
three hundred dollars for a child, inclusive

41:23.390 --> 41:27.300
of clothes, food, transport, everything, books,
everything.

41:27.300 --> 41:31.860
You don’t have to worry for their expenses
at all.

41:31.860 --> 41:37.580
You could give them some other clothes, but
they’ll have all their uniforms done by

41:37.580 --> 41:44.060
them, books, shoes, everything will be done
in that amount, and education of every kind.

41:44.060 --> 41:48.560
All kinds of arts, crafts, depending on the
aptitude of the child.

41:48.560 --> 41:52.270
And you’ll see, they will be something very
unique children.

41:52.270 --> 41:53.690
So think it over.

41:53.690 --> 41:58.940
And in that there is a lot of work entailed,
and some people are working it out.

41:58.940 --> 42:02.110
I’ll be getting some people from here also.

42:02.110 --> 42:13.380
And the whole process will be under My control,
so you don’t have to worry.

42:13.380 --> 42:34.020
So now, I hope I’ll be coming next year
again.

42:34.020 --> 42:38.510
But for next year – I mean of course, not
this year – but next year we have decided

42:38.510 --> 42:43.410
that it would be better to come here in the
month of April or May; because May is a better

42:43.410 --> 42:47.210
month here than March, and April is quite
hot.

42:47.210 --> 42:50.400
So what do you say, April or May?

42:50.400 --> 42:51.400
May.

42:51.400 --> 42:52.400
May, all right.

42:52.400 --> 43:01.110
But May, I can only come of fifth of May.

43:01.110 --> 43:13.240
After, I said, fifth of May, because we’ll
have one Sahasrara Day there and one here.

43:13.240 --> 43:19.970
And we can work it out that way to come by
May, so we can have one month of May spent

43:19.970 --> 43:20.970
here.

43:20.970 --> 43:21.970
I would like to spend more time.

43:21.970 --> 43:27.810
But you must not have any more groups, quarrels,
fighting, problems with husband and wife.

43:27.810 --> 43:32.010
I mean sometimes I feel, why did I marry them
to create these problems?

43:32.010 --> 43:37.050
They were all right without marriages!

43:37.050 --> 43:41.520
So all these petty things should not be there.

43:41.520 --> 43:43.980
You should all be big, great people.

43:43.980 --> 43:49.060
I would like to come and see you here in your
ashrams and things; I would like to know what

43:49.060 --> 43:51.870
you have been doing, what creative work you
have been doing.

43:51.870 --> 43:53.840
It’s beautiful things you can do.

43:53.840 --> 43:54.840
All right?

43:54.840 --> 43:58.420
So with that hope, tomorrow we’ll have this
Birthday Puja.

43:58.420 --> 44:01.579
And everybody is quite jealous of you that
I’m having My birthday here!

44:01.579 --> 44:20.060
I love you Australians very much, and you
have to also love yourself and have proper

44:20.060 --> 44:21.440
value about yourself.

44:21.440 --> 44:28.880
Don’t fritter away your lives, don’t waste
them on nonsensical things, that’s very

44:28.880 --> 44:29.880
precious.

44:29.880 --> 44:34.940
If you were not precious, you would not have
come to Sahaja Yoga, remember that.

44:34.940 --> 44:36.640
You would have been by now in some pub!

44:36.640 --> 44:39.600
All right.

44:39.600 --> 44:44.010
Now, so few things we have here.

44:44.010 --> 44:54.280
Now, can you read out the lists …? [Hindi]
Come along.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.140
This ….

44:56.140 --> 45:18.280
You see, they told Me not to bring anything,
and because there is Customs, I think that

45:18.280 --> 45:25.370
the Customs torture My life for nothing at
all.

45:25.370 --> 45:28.540
There are Customs, this thing, that thing.

45:28.540 --> 45:33.960
So I’m thankful to Mr Gupta that he could
manage to bring some things for you.

45:33.960 --> 45:40.600
And I could only buy something in the duty-free
shop for you.

45:40.600 --> 45:42.200
[Hindi]

45:42.200 --> 46:01.570
So first of all there’s a present for [Hindi]
… One for Stephen.

46:01.570 --> 46:22.520
These fountain pens are given to the leaders
so that they should write a letter to Me!

46:22.520 --> 46:37.340
Brian, Mr Brian.

46:37.340 --> 47:07.590
Now, others .… Cairns …. It’s all right,
I don’t read it.

47:07.590 --> 47:19.980
It’s all right … Melbourne … It’s
all right.

47:19.980 --> 47:25.100
So this is Perth.

47:25.100 --> 47:31.180
[Hindi] Brisbane.

47:31.180 --> 47:36.620
Brisbane is not here.

47:36.620 --> 47:43.510
We’ll keep it for Brisbane.What else?

47:51.072 --> 47:53.062
Canberra is not here?

47:53.062 --> 47:54.962
All right, keep it.

47:54.962 --> 47:56.492
Who else?

48:01.589 --> 48:02.589
Adelaide.

48:15.654 --> 48:20.004
For Adelaide, we should try still.

48:19.984 --> 48:25.894
I think it will work out now, things are better.

48:25.884 --> 48:27.536
Things are much better.

48:27.534 --> 48:29.056
It will work out.

48:29.054 --> 48:33.216
[Yogi: We have given You fifty-four macadamia
nut trees, for Your house in Prathisthan … for

48:33.204 --> 48:35.006
You to take back to India.]

48:35.125 --> 48:36.101
With Me?

48:36.085 --> 48:39.301
[Yogi: Yes, from the Adelaide collective,
for Your birthday.]

48:39.391 --> 48:40.961
Ah, I don’t think I can.

48:41.011 --> 48:45.941
But what you can do is to send them with these
people when they come.

48:45.941 --> 48:53.841
They can be kept here waiting?

48:53.831 --> 48:56.839
There’s somewhere here, and they can bring
it when they come for the Ganapatipule, all

48:56.851 --> 48:57.851
right?

48:57.973 --> 48:58.989
For the tour.

48:59.013 --> 48:59.889
All right?

48:59.913 --> 49:01.529
May God bless you.

49:01.543 --> 49:03.263
Thank you.

49:11.503 --> 49:13.213
All right.

49:13.213 --> 49:14.213
[Hindi]

49:14.213 --> 49:31.253
So we start giving saris to ladies who looked
after Me ... Canberra.

49:31.253 --> 49:44.753
So she’s not come as yet?

49:44.753 --> 49:49.263
All right.

50:07.258 --> 50:13.418
Lyn, is she here?

50:13.418 --> 50:21.148
Lyn from Brisbane … Cheryl?

50:21.148 --> 50:29.598
… Sandya Sapate … Jo?

50:29.598 --> 50:40.858
Jo from Perth … Kay.

50:40.858 --> 50:49.298
Kay from Canberra.

50:49.298 --> 51:13.448
Now we have shirts for the boys, of leaders
of all the – what do you call it? – ashrams;

51:13.498 --> 51:16.398
so you read the name.

51:16.408 --> 51:17.718
And now you all

51:17.738 --> 51:22.728
should try it, whichever fits you, and I don’t
know!

51:25.468 --> 51:29.548
First do it, first you people do it, all right.

51:31.883 --> 51:34.717
Come along, Cairns, come along.

51:34.783 --> 51:35.647
Select.

51:35.707 --> 51:37.257
Whichever fits you.

51:37.395 --> 51:40.485
These are all loose ones, so they’ll fit
anyone … Good … All right, take any one.

51:40.539 --> 51:42.179
Looks nice – beautiful!

51:42.259 --> 51:44.279
All right ….

51:44.239 --> 51:46.259
With embroidery!

51:47.769 --> 51:50.119
... May God bless you.

52:02.461 --> 52:06.511
Take whichever you like.

54:57.189 --> 54:59.759
That’s a good one!

55:00.033 --> 55:09.763
… Of course, Burwood.

55:09.763 --> 55:13.501
What about the New Zealand people?

55:13.533 --> 55:26.693
Auckland ... All right.

55:36.093 --> 55:52.299
That’s fine ... All right, take it up …

56:07.843 --> 56:11.253
Oh, blue?

57:01.032 --> 57:12.299
You like green … So Melbourne has no, because
– Melbourne has no ashram so far.

57:12.302 --> 57:12.830
Yes.

57:12.792 --> 57:15.040
So they have to have ashram.

57:19.489 --> 57:34.629
This is a special gift for Mr Stephen from
the leader of Hariyana, Mr Gupta, who has

57:34.629 --> 57:46.729
been so kind to bring all these things through
your Customs.

57:46.729 --> 58:05.779
So now we should disperse, I think, and tomorrow is there’s puja.

58:05.779 --> 58:15.289
If we want to start it’s about eleven o’clock,
but try to be there, make preparations, I’ll

58:15.289 --> 58:17.579
be ready here to come.

58:17.579 --> 58:23.429
I’ll be ready, very ready to come there,
but the problem is sometimes it’s not ready.

58:23.429 --> 58:26.529
So we have told everybody eleven o’clock
we are starting the puja.

58:26.529 --> 58:33.399
But let’s see how you do it, because the
preparation takes so much time.

58:33.399 --> 58:35.117
All right?

58:35.099 --> 58:37.487
May God bless.

58:38.877 --> 58:43.077
I gave it today because tomorrow is My birthday;
I’m not supposed to give any presents on

58:43.057 --> 58:45.799
My birthday!

58:53.597 --> 58:57.437
(So finish it off now?)

58:57.473 --> 59:03.713
Good night, everybody.

59:03.743 --> 59:07.063
Sleep early!

59:06.603 --> 59:15.615
Hello, hello, how are you?

59:15.683 --> 59:19.736
[Child: My father’s here.]

59:20.353 --> 59:25.333
Which one?

59:33.463 --> 59:45.893
… Deep, deep, deep sleep, eh?

59:45.893 --> 59:53.363
What’s your name?

59:53.363 --> 59:55.843
[Shridhara.]

59:55.843 --> 59:57.403
Shridhara, eh?

59:57.442 --> 59:59.743
And you are really Shridhara!

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:02.393
He’s very good at acting!

01:00:02.393 --> 01:00:08.873
All these children can be really trained up
so well, as they are born-realized.

01:00:08.873 --> 01:00:19.763
So you will come to India to study?

01:00:19.763 --> 01:00:23.843
To ride horses?

01:00:23.843 --> 01:00:26.563
…. Yes, yes.

01:00:26.563 --> 01:00:46.573
You don’t have to wear in India, there is
no need, but we can get you some hats also

01:00:46.573 --> 01:00:49.452
… They’ll fit you all right.

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:54.833
They make hats for every size of head!

01:00:58.213 --> 01:00:58.950
All right.

01:00:59.263 --> 01:01:02.184
May God bless you.
