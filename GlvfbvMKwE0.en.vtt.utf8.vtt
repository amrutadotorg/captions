00:04.009 --> 00:12.095
It's another great pleasure to come to America
to meet you all people here.

00:20.709 --> 00:27.113
This one, as I have told you, is a very important country

00:29.101 --> 00:32.323
in the field of spirituality.

00:33.196 --> 00:37.184
Not because it's a large country

00:37.430 --> 00:44.021
or because it is very prosperous,

00:44.754 --> 00:56.117
but because, as you know, it is the Vishuddhi in the plan of Virata.

00:56.885 --> 01:02.790
Vishuddhi is such an important chakra;

01:04.202 --> 01:08.429
it has a very great manifestation also.

01:09.887 --> 01:18.723
For example it has another, you can say a subsidiary chakra,

01:20.168 --> 01:22.909
which we call as Hamsa Chakra.

01:26.401 --> 01:40.305
And the star which is increasing this center,

01:40.495 --> 01:47.635
we say the star that resides on
which this center is working, is Saturn.

01:48.958 --> 01:54.187
And as you know with Saturn there is
another small little Saturn moving.

01:54.687 --> 01:59.060
In the same way with this Vishuddhi Chakra,

01:59.270 --> 02:06.130
there's another one which is a very important chakra,

02:07.024 --> 02:10.174
which we call as Hamsa Chakra.

02:10.920 --> 02:15.896
We've had a puja of Hamsa Chakra in Germany once.

02:16.452 --> 02:23.165
And it has acted, I think, because Germans have realized

02:23.315 --> 02:32.896
that whatever they have done so far was absolutely inhuman.

02:33.968 --> 02:37.613
And I was so happy to see that when I went to Russia,

02:38.342 --> 02:45.062
the people who came to give them realization were mostly Germans.

02:48.155 --> 02:55.437
It really makes you feel so tender about the whole thing

02:55.720 --> 03:02.028
that the Germans felt it is important, I mean,
they were the ones who were attracted

03:02.528 --> 03:07.188
to come to Russia to give realization to Russians;

03:07.236 --> 03:13.710
and you must know that the number of Russians killed

03:13.761 --> 03:19.066
are the maximum in the war, in this war, by Germans.

03:21.866 --> 03:26.979
So the discretion, the Divine Discretion,

03:27.400 --> 03:36.094
that manifests through your Hamsa Chakra first started in Germany.

03:37.372 --> 03:46.729
And now you see how East Germany is entering into German territory,

03:47.243 --> 03:54.243
West Germany, and how they're welcoming them, looking after them.

03:56.473 --> 04:04.498
And who did was, all these things was,
few Sahaja Yogis who triggered it.

04:07.173 --> 04:12.488
So in those countries where there has been tremendous war

04:12.513 --> 04:16.146
problem, and they had czars and they had to go through hell -

04:16.171 --> 04:23.171
even Germans had to suffer a lot because of Hitler's misguidance.

04:23.941 --> 04:30.893
They have known hardships, they have known sacrifices,
they have known all kinds of ordeals they had to go through,

04:31.823 --> 04:38.823
but somehow this country has been blessed to such an extent

04:39.136 --> 04:47.600
that Americans never realized what is it that is hardship.

04:49.283 --> 04:55.041
And the blessings really have spoiled them.

04:56.259 --> 05:01.901
Hardships have been in all these countries
which we call as Eastern Bloc,

05:02.546 --> 05:07.948
and Sahaja Yoga is spreading like wildfire in all
these Eastern Bloc countries

05:08.226 --> 05:13.507
where they have been completely
under the rule of Russians, we can say,

05:13.913 --> 05:17.297
or under the rule of terror.

05:18.100 --> 05:24.477
And the same terror has acted in Russia, throughout.

05:27.749 --> 05:34.296
In that terror, in that fear, it is surprising

05:34.924 --> 05:42.668
how this wisdom has grown in all
these people much more than in countries

05:42.776 --> 05:51.739
where we have the greatest affluence,  the greatest comfort of life.

05:56.143 --> 06:02.738
The hardship has taught them,
the fear has taught them, to be wise.

06:03.127 --> 06:07.290
And the best part is the discretion.

06:08.487 --> 06:16.219
Now this being Shri Krishna's country,
because He is Kubera, He's the God of wealth.

06:17.276 --> 06:20.459
The country is wealthy, no doubt;

06:21.523 --> 06:32.720
but the other part of Shri Krishna is completely missing,
is the Divine Discretion.

06:33.093 --> 06:40.751
How His Divine Discretion is shown,
even in Mahabharata, is wonderful to see.

06:42.798 --> 06:48.311
How He managed the Pandavas to win the war

06:48.399 --> 06:52.073
through His Divine Discretion because they were dharmic,

06:52.423 --> 06:55.381
they were standing in dharma.

06:55.497 --> 07:01.568
And how He supported the Pandavas because they were dharmic.

07:02.472 --> 07:05.980
But just the opposite is the situation of this America,

07:06.123 --> 07:09.991
that America always supports wrong people.

07:11.404 --> 07:19.200
And it has no principle of righteousness
or principle of its own freedom.

07:20.915 --> 07:28.415
For example, to support something like Argentina or Peru,

07:28.749 --> 07:31.790
where there's complete dictatorship.

07:32.037 --> 07:39.037
I've been there; I know what it is like in the time
it was under the regime of these people.

07:39.749 --> 07:46.489
And that's what has happened to the people of this country -
they have no Divine Discretion at all.

07:47.044 --> 07:51.658
And that's why I think all the false gurus have come and settled here,

07:51.683 --> 07:56.773
because they know these people have no Divine Discretion.

08:00.856 --> 08:04.965
The Hamsa Chakra is so weak here,

08:10.708 --> 08:15.842
that they cannot see what is dharma and what is adharma.

08:19.079 --> 08:24.400
Also, the basic principle by which this country

08:25.144 --> 08:31.330
became democratic was that this government is

08:31.743 --> 08:36.321
for the people, of the people, by the people.

08:39.681 --> 08:43.411
So it has to be people-oriented.

08:43.969 --> 08:48.595
But democracy at this stage without realization cannot work out.

08:48.842 --> 08:50.714
It's obvious.

08:52.122 --> 08:59.426
Few people who were cunning,
who could make money became money-oriented.

08:59.628 --> 09:07.220
They could advertise better;
they could manipulate better  than other people

09:07.545 --> 09:16.964
who were crooks also, making money like that,
through drugs, through other things, by other means.

09:18.319 --> 09:25.165
They could come up, they were elected, and they are in charge.

09:25.190 --> 09:30.558
So it is not people-oriented,
but it is only money-oriented democracy.

09:31.151 --> 09:34.722
And maybe if it goes on like this, you'll find

09:35.254 --> 09:41.077
you might get some horrible crooks as rulers in this country.

09:42.922 --> 09:45.602
Because the one who can make money,

09:45.952 --> 09:52.263
the one who has lots of money,
by hook or crook, whosoever may be,

09:54.521 --> 09:59.970
can win over elections and can become our ruler here.

10:04.304 --> 10:11.304
So the democracy that was started or was spelled out by Abraham Lincoln

10:12.893 --> 10:16.849
is no more there; it's a money-oriented thing.

10:17.652 --> 10:22.254
And it has generated such a bad atmosphere all over the world

10:22.694 --> 10:29.694
that in the whole world now the conservatives,
the people who think they are conservatives,

10:30.218 --> 10:34.359
who are money-oriented people, who don't care for people at all,

10:36.074 --> 10:40.237
how are becoming the leaders, everywhere.

10:44.669 --> 10:58.281
So to be people-oriented one had to, first of all, understand

10:59.353 --> 11:03.760
that you have to have your realization,

11:04.700 --> 11:08.259
otherwise you do not become a collective being.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.694
If you do not become the collective being,

11:11.738 --> 11:21.240
you cannot enjoy the beautiful virtue of generosity.

11:22.927 --> 11:26.324
And when you do not have that generosity,

11:28.405 --> 11:36.342
then you become a person of a very small mind and a small heart.

11:39.117 --> 11:44.584
And the crookedness works everywhere.

11:44.790 --> 11:48.305
Outside they're very sweet to talk.

11:48.401 --> 11:53.345
But inside don't know what they will do,  how they'll deceive.

11:55.001 --> 11:58.060
In this kind of atmosphere we are.

11:58.590 --> 12:01.754
While you know in Russia we have done so well.

12:02.294 --> 12:07.114
In Russia people were just waiting for a Mother to come, that's all.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.638
They're Mother worshipers to begin with,

12:11.037 --> 12:14.323
and they were wanting somebody just to love them,

12:14.688 --> 12:19.986
every one of them, to tell them about love.

12:21.514 --> 12:25.024
Because they felt they were never loved by their mother.

12:25.055 --> 12:28.149
Here also, nobody's loved.

12:29.943 --> 12:34.285
But the pattern of the government there

12:34.310 --> 12:39.364
and the pattern of the people are two different types.

12:39.531 --> 12:44.924
The government people are very, you can call them very dominating,

12:45.059 --> 12:49.294
extremely strict and exploiting type.

12:49.493 --> 12:52.917
But the people are the exploited ones.

12:53.187 --> 12:58.620
But here, the pattern of the government is taken over by people.

13:01.828 --> 13:06.560
As the government is exploiting people,
people are also exploiting each other.

13:06.735 --> 13:11.056
As much as they can exploit, very good.
After all money is the end of it.

13:13.628 --> 13:19.860
That's why I used to think why in America Sahaja Yoga is failing.

13:20.362 --> 13:22.382
All kinds of thugs have come here.

13:22.407 --> 13:26.621
They have made lots of money, they have ...
I mean they all are thrown out and

13:26.646 --> 13:29.132
so many had to be thrown out, it's all right.

13:29.220 --> 13:33.878
But as far as Sahaja Yoga message is concerned, people cannot absorb it.

13:37.323 --> 13:40.797
So now for Sahaja Yogis it is very important

13:41.630 --> 13:46.450
to become really very deep Sahaja Yogis -

13:46.816 --> 13:53.026
very, very deep - so that we can trigger better.

13:54.594 --> 14:00.839
Even if there are two Sahaja Yogis
who are very deep, one can trigger a lot.

14:03.317 --> 14:06.647
Like you'll be surprised in Hungary
people were saying in the beginning,

14:06.672 --> 14:08.656
"Mother, what about Hungary? It should become free."

14:08.681 --> 14:12.025
I said, "Let there be one Sahaja Yogi to come in."

14:12.430 --> 14:20.374
Only one fellow came in - absolutely sick,
very thin and worn-out fellow.

14:20.773 --> 14:24.117
I treated him. I cured him.

14:24.483 --> 14:27.799
And with love, he got nourishment.

14:29.347 --> 14:32.918
And within eight days after his realization,

14:33.462 --> 14:41.769
he went back, and after a week, Hungary got its freedom.

14:42.835 --> 14:46.468
Though we are few in here,

14:46.619 --> 14:50.821
we all have to be very conscious of it -

14:50.989 --> 14:58.245
that we are the foundation, and if we fail, we'll fail our country.

14:59.324 --> 15:07.717
And we have to be very deep, sensible Sahaja Yogis.

15:08.939 --> 15:11.757
So what problems do we face here?

15:12.416 --> 15:20.387
First as I've told hundred times that you have to open your heart.

15:22.617 --> 15:28.987
That's such an important thing for all Sahaja Yogis to open their heart.

15:29.820 --> 15:35.422
Look into your hearts. What do you want?

15:38.861 --> 15:45.884
Not through rationality, but through vibrations.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.716
What do you want?

15:49.035 --> 15:52.060
You ask yourself, "What do I want?"

15:52.428 --> 15:55.349
Then say few words, "I want money."

15:55.513 --> 15:57.500
Vibrations won't flow.

15:58.071 --> 16:02.230
"I want this, that." Vibrations won't flow.

16:02.909 --> 16:04.781
Then what do you want?

16:05.536 --> 16:09.535
" I want to be a deep Sahaja Yogi, very deep.

16:09.758 --> 16:13.222
So I could save my country."

16:14.150 --> 16:16.979
If Americans will go to hell,

16:17.095 --> 16:21.432
you will be held responsible for that, nobody else.

16:23.417 --> 16:27.882
You need very few people to trigger it, I tell you.

16:29.125 --> 16:33.303
But we still stick on to our past.

16:34.556 --> 16:40.015
Problems and problems of America are
very different type all the time.

16:40.525 --> 16:42.725
First is aggressiveness.

16:45.985 --> 16:49.322
What is in aggressiveness?

16:50.847 --> 16:56.537
Loving someone, being kind to someone,

16:57.606 --> 17:03.507
should be so natural because that is what your Spirit is.

17:03.721 --> 17:09.660
It loves. It enjoys the love, giving love.

17:12.770 --> 17:22.004
So to allow your Spirit to manifest,
you have to understand Its nature.

17:22.775 --> 17:30.959
Spirit can never be aggressive, can never dominate.

17:31.160 --> 17:38.669
It respects the freedom of another person
because It's a free being.

17:41.476 --> 17:45.959
So this aggressiveness that we have within us,

17:46.047 --> 17:48.606
we have to really challenge it

17:48.764 --> 17:52.256
and ask, "Why are we aggressive?"

17:55.342 --> 18:03.485
But the understanding about oneself has to be very honest also.

18:03.636 --> 18:15.480
Because if you want to justify,
and if you want to close your eyes to reality,

18:16.606 --> 18:21.087
then you cannot improve yourself.

18:21.589 --> 18:28.589
And when the depth grows inside then it is tremendous, I tell you,

18:29.234 --> 18:31.850
because this Power which is surrounding us -

18:31.875 --> 18:34.874
which you know about, which you have felt it -

18:35.255 --> 18:42.154
has to flow through a medium which is absolutely clean,

18:43.102 --> 18:46.377
egoless, conditionless.

18:46.538 --> 18:49.609
But we are so much conditioned,

18:50.079 --> 18:53.069
and in this so-called free country,

18:53.339 --> 18:56.885
this freedom has conditioned us.
It's like a person who is let loose,

18:56.910 --> 18:58.724
doesn't know where to go.

18:58.766 --> 19:03.567
He bangs his head this side, bangs his head that side,

19:04.414 --> 19:08.210
And the problems are so funny -

19:09.514 --> 19:17.872
problems which do not exist anywhere (else), exist in this country.

19:18.795 --> 19:21.358
You know them very well.

19:21.406 --> 19:31.963
It's such shocking state that when we think about it,

19:32.019 --> 19:35.757
what's going to happen? Where are we going to be?

19:36.381 --> 19:41.605
So we are really on a warpath in America,
I must tell you, for Sahaja Yogis,

19:42.161 --> 19:49.161
really on a warpath. Unless and until you take up Sahaja Yoga as

19:50.008 --> 19:56.054
your only concern, it's not going to work out.

19:57.252 --> 20:03.206
We have problems like somebody has no job,
then somebody has this [here], he's lost something here,

20:03.284 --> 20:06.837
then husband's, wife's problems
and all these nonsensical things.

20:09.849 --> 20:12.161
Still people are struggling with that.

20:12.384 --> 20:16.918
How many times you've been married in previous lives?

20:17.218 --> 20:20.766
Then somebody's wife is dominating, somebody's husband is dominating.

20:20.791 --> 20:26.449
Such absurd things! Doesn't behoove saints.

20:27.791 --> 20:42.453
So the quality of Sahaja Yogis in America,
unless and until is raised, one cannot trigger anything here.

20:43.691 --> 20:50.613
And the first thing that the Sahaja Yogis
must have is collectivity in America,

20:50.708 --> 20:55.459
because America stands for Vishuddhi Chakra,

20:55.555 --> 21:01.083
which is manifesting collectivity within us.

21:01.472 --> 21:04.423
And if people cannot be collective,

21:05.955 --> 21:12.919
then how can you have Sahaja Yoga manifesting here? Impossible.

21:13.514 --> 21:17.510
Because that is the greatest quality you have.

21:18.110 --> 21:22.940
That's the basic power you have in this country
is the collectivity within you.

21:23.163 --> 21:26.732
So you have two basic powers. First is collectivity

21:26.931 --> 21:31.581
and the second one that you have is the Divine Discretion.

21:31.851 --> 21:36.256
Basically given to you these powers,

21:36.400 --> 21:39.042
and just the opposite if we go.

21:39.436 --> 21:43.138
I've heard about many Sahaja Yogis

21:43.163 --> 21:49.945
who avoid company of children, who run away from other people.

21:50.072 --> 21:53.165
If they see three, four people sitting there,

21:53.301 --> 21:57.038
then they can't share the room with them.

21:58.459 --> 22:00.070
It's very common.

22:04.964 --> 22:08.046
Say now, supposing there's a very small little room,

22:09.808 --> 22:12.774
and so many have to sleep in a small little room,

22:13.470 --> 22:17.783
it's nice in a way. It's an experience.

22:18.141 --> 22:21.793
Then, where do you sleep?
You sleep there, you sleep there?

22:21.818 --> 22:25.745
How do you manage?
You can't go to the bathroom. And it's an event.

22:35.005 --> 22:39.159
The life which is smooth is boring.

22:46.252 --> 22:50.502
There should be some events in life, you see, like this.

22:51.011 --> 22:53.272
But Americans always avoid

22:53.297 --> 23:01.601
any, any such thing which requires an eventful time.

23:03.707 --> 23:07.148
Otherwise, if you walk straight forward,

23:07.181 --> 23:11.554
you see, reach some place,
open the door and everything is ready made.

23:11.579 --> 23:14.806
You walk into a room, everything electrified

23:14.885 --> 23:17.158
and you just get your seat. You sit on the seat.

23:17.183 --> 23:19.840
If you have to get up, the seat puts you out.

23:22.192 --> 23:25.640
Or, I went to somebody's house and they said, "We have a bed here."

23:25.640 --> 23:27.090
I said, "What's so special?"

23:27.090 --> 23:30.028
He said, "If you press this button, your legs will come up.

23:30.037 --> 23:33.718
If you press this button,
you head will come up.

23:34.127 --> 23:35.685
You'll turn round."

23:35.710 --> 23:39.140
I said, "I can do all that Myself.

23:45.473 --> 23:50.345
I'm not that old or that weak that I can't do it."

23:51.965 --> 23:58.653
But, you see they,  the way people are, always looking for comfort,

23:59.018 --> 24:04.238
always looking for comfort, and like to have smooth life.

24:04.817 --> 24:08.370
And the smoothness has made them so boring.

24:08.401 --> 24:10.458
I mean their life is really boring.

24:10.483 --> 24:17.608
And a person who has a boring life cannot have a vision.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.237
Cannot. Everything is done up now.

24:21.262 --> 24:25.189
You go there, everything is first class.
There's nothing to worry.

24:25.216 --> 24:29.980
There's a ... you go to a hotel,
everything is paid for, nicely kept.

24:30.012 --> 24:32.544
It's a very good hotel.

24:33.300 --> 24:37.273
But only when in a hotel you are staying and suddenly you,

24:37.361 --> 24:40.221
people tell you, "Oh there's going to be an earthquake!"

24:40.246 --> 24:45.774
You run out with your pajamas
and you find yourself in funny companies.

24:45.870 --> 24:48.495
And that's what you remember.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.402
You may go to various places

24:52.418 --> 24:55.385
and live in various comforts and things.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.273
You don't remember that.

24:59.519 --> 25:03.890
So people now want to do something funny.

25:03.914 --> 25:07.573
Like they'll do trekking up, they're doing this, and

25:07.598 --> 25:10.270
all those funny sort of thing.

25:11.985 --> 25:14.907
Because the life is not eventful,

25:15.490 --> 25:21.063
they are trying something that is dangerous, that is destroying.

25:21.960 --> 25:26.753
But supposing if you had accepted events in life as important.

25:27.904 --> 25:31.127
What does it matter? Let's see what happens.

25:32.531 --> 25:37.425
For example, if I say, "Now, some people have to go from here

25:38.124 --> 25:40.020
to Phoenix and settle down there."

25:40.173 --> 25:42.510
Immediately, "How will they go?"

25:42.598 --> 25:46.824
And, "Where will be the house? Where will they stay?

25:46.849 --> 25:52.720
Who will pay for it?" And every question,
such a big question they have.

25:54.242 --> 25:56.104
"Yes, we'll go. What's the harm?

25:56.144 --> 25:59.639
We'll stay anywhere, under a tree. Doesn't matter. What's that?"

25:59.679 --> 26:04.835
After all monkeys can live there, why can't we?
They were our forefathers.

26:06.886 --> 26:13.886
But that sort of a comfort loving temperament is very dangerous.

26:14.233 --> 26:17.326
And they feel they are very tired, all the time.

26:17.326 --> 26:21.520
You see in American films nowadays what I see is anybody,

26:21.655 --> 26:25.729
even a heroine or a hero, comes and says, "Ahhh."

26:26.753 --> 26:30.028
Perhaps they think too much they are working hard

26:30.203 --> 26:33.059
or they are doing this.  All the time they think.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.976
There's a Sahaja Yogini in London.

26:37.001 --> 26:41.895
She's an Indian girl, works very hard,
does every stitching, everything she does.

26:41.974 --> 26:43.285
She's very happy.

26:43.365 --> 26:47.991
There's another one who is an English one,
he's always tired.

26:48.872 --> 26:52.681
So I told her, "Why is he tired?
He looks so healthy. Why is he so tired?"

26:52.745 --> 26:55.636
She said, "Mother, You know he thinks he's working.

26:55.653 --> 26:59.675
I don't think, I think it's Mother Who is working

26:59.700 --> 27:02.689
because I leave everything at Your Lotus Feet.

27:03.390 --> 27:07.048
I am not working. She's working.

27:07.223 --> 27:09.481
I'm leaving at Her Lotus Feet, that's all."

27:09.513 --> 27:11.783
And then you don't feel that.

27:11.878 --> 27:15.679
Now the quarrel between husband and wife here is mainly,

27:15.785 --> 27:19.423
"how many dishes you have washed,
how many dishes I have washed."

27:21.687 --> 27:26.301
"How much physical work you have done,
how much physical work I have done."

27:26.745 --> 27:33.513
It's a kind of a competition going on as to all the time weigh

27:33.736 --> 27:35.900
"what you have done, what I have done."

27:36.011 --> 27:41.931
But supposing if you want to do something in such a manner that,

27:41.956 --> 27:46.855
"Let me see, I will surprise my husband by doing everything nicely.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.470
Let's finish it wast"

27:49.161 --> 27:52.228
You'll do it very well, and you'll never be tired.

27:52.315 --> 27:56.344
And when you'll see your husband coming home
and seeing things done so well,

27:56.369 --> 28:00.249
so well, so happy.

28:00.408 --> 28:05.510
That joy of doing something to make someone happy

28:05.709 --> 28:13.056
will completely neutralize all your discomfort,
or the fatigue that you have.

28:14.247 --> 28:17.552
The other way round, also. The husband should also feel that

28:17.592 --> 28:22.026
"what could I do for her?"
A small little thing can make her happy.

28:23.171 --> 28:27.010
And the divorces here are all the time because

28:27.153 --> 28:33.382
of this kind of a nonsensical idea that

28:33.707 --> 28:38.014
"how much he has done, what I have done, what he has done."

28:38.260 --> 28:46.693
All the time weighing it out and making yourself miserable.

28:51.606 --> 28:54.859
I travel a lot as you know.

28:54.884 --> 29:00.161
I never feel I'm traveling, because I am there with Myself,

29:00.546 --> 29:03.998
whether I sit here or travel it's just the same.

29:04.054 --> 29:08.662
But if you think,  "I'm traveling",
then you feel,  "Oh God, I'm traveling!"

29:09.328 --> 29:11.976
But if you just think, "I'm sitting here in the chair;

29:12.001 --> 29:15.263
I'm sitting there in the chair", you don't feel tired.

29:15.914 --> 29:18.034
If you are doing some work,

29:18.034 --> 29:22.521
you feel tired when you start thinking,
"I am doing this work, I have done that work."

29:22.743 --> 29:27.486
Especially in Sahaja Yoga, if you think,
"I am doing any work" better not do it.

29:28.772 --> 29:33.046
But if you think, "I am doing nothing" and what joy -

29:36.058 --> 29:40.280
what joy it is! You'll become so energetic,

29:40.428 --> 29:47.290
because once you surrender,
then the Divine Power starts flowing through Me.

29:47.315 --> 29:51.043
That's why Mohammed Sahib has said,
"Islam means to surrender."

29:51.615 --> 29:54.454
He said it about Me also, that "I'll send you",

29:54.479 --> 29:56.136
He called Me the "Sent One."

29:56.779 --> 30:03.990
Everything He's talked about,
having vibrations and all that, in His own style,

30:04.125 --> 30:08.800
but He said that the message would be of surrender.

30:09.419 --> 30:11.962
And that surrendering part has to be there

30:11.987 --> 30:15.410
because Shri Krishna in Gita has very clearly said that,

30:15.435 --> 30:19.242
"Forget every dharma, just surrender yourself to Me."

30:21.718 --> 30:26.333
And that surrendering, if the Sahaja Yogis develop

30:27.206 --> 30:31.750
in America, the rest I'll look after.
But you leave it to Me to do it.

30:35.522 --> 30:38.929
And then ideas and everything will start flowing because

30:38.977 --> 30:43.564
this is Virata's place.
That's why you have such great scientists here,

30:43.731 --> 30:47.656
such great schools for all kinds of intellectual work

30:47.681 --> 30:51.266
and all that is here, while people are not wise.

30:51.497 --> 30:55.534
They are not wise at all. I've known people who-

30:55.632 --> 31:00.788
there's a, I met a president of Union Society,
he was eighty years of age,

31:00.939 --> 31:05.247
and he's supposed to be the President of the whole world.

31:07.511 --> 31:10.170
And he said, "I must see You privately."

31:10.195 --> 31:14.701
I said, "All right." He came to Me and

31:15.268 --> 31:20.958
his problem was so stupid that I just started looking at him.

31:20.983 --> 31:23.736
Eighty year old man, this stupid fellow!

31:24.409 --> 31:28.427
He's not even like a ten-year-old boy.

31:28.625 --> 31:34.350
No maturity of any kind. So immature.

31:34.896 --> 31:39.335
And when I saw him, I just had the glimpse of the whole thing,

31:39.462 --> 31:44.403
that "look at this man, eighty year old,
he's the Chairman of Union Society,

31:44.569 --> 31:48.774
he's - all over the world, people think
he's the Chairman of this thing."

31:48.799 --> 31:51.556
The chair may be better than him.

31:52.953 --> 31:56.130
Such a stupid fellow in a way.

31:56.378 --> 31:59.814
Such a stupid fellow that you can't imagine.

32:00.265 --> 32:02.209
So they might be intelligent,

32:02.225 --> 32:07.229
they might be well read,
they might be able to discover something out of matter,

32:07.781 --> 32:10.256
but they do not have wisdom.

32:10.542 --> 32:16.520
And the wisdom can only come through honest introspection.

32:18.083 --> 32:23.488
But it should not be also, "I'm catching on this chakra,
I'm catching on that chakra." Not that.

32:23.655 --> 32:29.258
But, "Why am I not seeing the point? What's the matter with me?

32:30.830 --> 32:33.923
Why can't I understand what is Sahaja Yoga?"

32:34.320 --> 32:39.484
Even when you have become Sahaja Yogis now for years together,

32:39.556 --> 32:42.856
still these old nonsensical things stick on to you,

32:42.881 --> 32:47.454
these ideas stick on to you. Why?

32:48.206 --> 32:55.180
Why do we not have that purity of Divine

32:55.205 --> 33:00.350
Discretion, which sees everything so clearly?

33:01.954 --> 33:07.286
So I think we need collectivity first of all,

33:08.017 --> 33:12.294
and secondly meditative honesty.

33:12.728 --> 33:16.747
Just to meditate, sit down before the photograph,
do the meditation - no!

33:17.221 --> 33:23.580
Meditation should act, should work.

33:24.053 --> 33:26.672
If it does not work, something wrong with you.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.299
Absolutely something wrong.

33:29.612 --> 33:34.758
If you feel everything is working all right,

33:35.353 --> 33:45.104
everything is miraculously showing its presence,

33:45.636 --> 33:49.121
presence of the Paramachaitanya, then you are all right.

33:49.146 --> 33:52.085
But if it is not so, if there are problems,

33:52.291 --> 33:56.002
then you're not, you're not a Sahaja Yogi.

33:57.216 --> 34:05.781
Sahaja Yogi is the one who is completely
connected with this Paramachaitanya.

34:08.777 --> 34:10.980
And for that age is no bar.

34:11.005 --> 34:17.008
I have seen girls who are only sixteen, seventeen, eighteen years so wise.

34:18.383 --> 34:25.668
Even small little children who were with Guido, I talked to them.

34:26.184 --> 34:28.998
I was surprised at their wisdom.

34:29.165 --> 34:34.103
So very wise, so beautiful.

34:36.215 --> 34:38.311
They understood human nature so well.

34:38.344 --> 34:45.807
Small little children about, they were at the most, ten years of age.

34:46.632 --> 34:49.339
And nice to talk to them.

34:51.393 --> 34:54.371
So that wisdom if they can have at that age,

34:54.396 --> 35:00.320
now we are also, all of us are about ten years old
Sahaja Yogis, minimum, nothing else.

35:02.069 --> 35:11.564
But still we are struggling, ambitious and wrong priorities.

35:12.725 --> 35:15.454
There is no need to have any ambition.

35:15.479 --> 35:20.052
Ambition is an imaginary thing.

35:20.290 --> 35:23.012
But Sahaja Yoga is reality.

35:23.566 --> 35:26.438
Everything works out.

35:26.890 --> 35:30.000
Everything sorts itself.

35:30.135 --> 35:32.539
Everything plans out.

35:32.564 --> 35:36.666
But to feel that if this is so,

35:36.968 --> 35:39.928
as I said in a small room  there are twelve people,

35:40.158 --> 35:44.665
it's something for the good. Why not?

35:46.966 --> 35:52.152
We have to be there. If I've lost the way, supposing,

35:54.879 --> 35:56.930
then I would say I have to go this way.

35:57.111 --> 36:01.300
This time we made a ticket which was
little wrong according to everyone

36:01.325 --> 36:03.593
because we had to go through Phoenix.

36:03.695 --> 36:08.885
But nice because I felt the vibrations of Phoenix,
I had to go that way.

36:09.671 --> 36:11.904
I had to see that.

36:14.066 --> 36:18.124
So always to find something smooth,

36:18.379 --> 36:23.906
the way we want it to be smooth, is not the way of Sahaja Yoga.

36:24.160 --> 36:32.181
Whatever we get it, we see the hand of the Divine behind it.

36:32.946 --> 36:35.658
What is our purpose of life?

36:36.062 --> 36:44.496
Our purpose of life is to save people,
save the Americans, minimum of minimums.

36:44.496 --> 36:47.452
Not the world, but at least start with Americans.

36:47.477 --> 36:51.592
That's our purpose of life. That's our identity.

36:51.805 --> 36:58.805
While doing that, there is Paramachaitanya
which is going to look after you completely.

36:59.465 --> 37:03.909
But first you put yourself before everything else,

37:03.957 --> 37:09.289
"I must have this, I must have that, I must have this."
It won't work out.

37:10.990 --> 37:14.849
Then, "I have this problem, I jumped into bankruptcy,

37:14.858 --> 37:18.167
I had that problem, I just couldn't manage."

37:18.192 --> 37:25.192
Because you have put other things before your "self". "

37:26.025 --> 37:28.247
Self" means the Spirit.

37:28.670 --> 37:32.771
According to people, "self" means selfishness,

37:32.906 --> 37:36.398
but according to Sahaja Yoga, "self" means your Spirit.

37:37.748 --> 37:43.858
So today's lecture should not be that
we hear from one ear and goes through the same one,

37:43.961 --> 37:49.113
but should we little bit ponder about it
and listen to it again and again.

37:50.168 --> 37:55.398
I have great hopes for you.
I have worked very hard in America, very much.

37:56.104 --> 37:58.310
But it has never been

37:59.031 --> 38:02.643
that state where I could say,"Now I can trigger something.

38:04.958 --> 38:08.710
" Even if there are few Sahaja Yogis
who are very deep and good,

38:08.735 --> 38:14.138
they are pulled down by others -
by jealousies, by this, by that.

38:17.364 --> 38:20.405
It's not the number that you are  but

38:21.039 --> 38:24.510
the quality that you are, first of all.

38:26.260 --> 38:29.545
But in Russia, I found it so easy, so very easy.

38:30.300 --> 38:34.031
It was wonderful, unbelievable.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.546
I've been only there thrice, can you imagine?

38:37.761 --> 38:40.660
And now Sahaja Yoga is a religion throughout.

38:40.676 --> 38:44.064
Everyone knows Me in Russia.

38:47.437 --> 38:53.841
But here people only know Rajneesh
or that Muktananda, all horrible people.

38:57.045 --> 39:02.096
Now, you can also say that,
"Mother, it's a question of advertising."

39:02.498 --> 39:06.284
That here the people, the way they advertise
and manipulate, and all that.

39:06.467 --> 39:14.064
But it only works out in places
where people are not seeking reality.

39:16.190 --> 39:19.365
Why can't they see that this is all publicity?

39:20.081 --> 39:21.921
They have no discretion?

39:22.438 --> 39:25.183
Supposing tomorrow they say, "This is the hair style." Then all

39:25.208 --> 39:27.519
Americans are in the same hair style.

39:27.544 --> 39:29.965
You can't make them out who is who.

39:30.307 --> 39:33.382
Or they say "this is the way the dress has to be."

39:33.517 --> 39:36.080
All Americans will be dressed up that way.

39:36.266 --> 39:37.852
I mean it's a slavery.

39:38.130 --> 39:41.206
Today's entrepreneurs, and through all this advertisement,

39:41.309 --> 39:43.577
any kind of advertisement.

39:43.711 --> 39:46.869
If that enamors people so much,

39:47.013 --> 39:49.753
that means we are fools, we are stupid,

39:49.902 --> 39:54.142
we are idiots that we cannot think for ourselves.

39:54.276 --> 39:56.236
Anybody can befool us.

39:56.356 --> 39:59.332
Anybody can put up anything in the market.

39:59.419 --> 40:01.927
Anything they talk about, we'll jump at it

40:01.960 --> 40:06.246
as if we have no brains to understand, to take to it.

40:08.381 --> 40:11.470
It's like we have no roots.

40:12.121 --> 40:17.451
We are just like some weeds which are thrown from this end to that end.

40:18.833 --> 40:24.198
But in Sahaja Yoga, your roots must grow much, much faster than anybody else,

40:24.618 --> 40:28.997
because this is the land of Shri Krishna.

40:31.315 --> 40:36.202
How many things He has done in His lifetime we have to see.

40:37.399 --> 40:44.399
As a child He killed so many demons,
while all demons are invited here.

40:45.649 --> 40:52.105
As a child He raised the Kundalini of all the Gopis and everyone.

40:53.934 --> 41:00.478
He played all kinds of beautiful tricks to amuse people as a child.

41:02.827 --> 41:08.122
And later on, He killed His own uncle.

41:10.704 --> 41:18.555
Which shows one thing -
an uncle in Indian families is the nearest person.

41:18.783 --> 41:21.570
In the marriage, it is the uncle who gives the daughter,

41:21.595 --> 41:26.579
it is the uncle who performs most of the rituals and everything.

41:26.604 --> 41:29.681
The uncle is the nearest person.

41:30.372 --> 41:34.240
And He killed His own uncle.

41:35.506 --> 41:43.105
Shows that He finished off all these artificial relationships.

41:46.851 --> 41:52.668
And then we find in America there are people

41:52.780 --> 41:55.533
who have done this kind of thing is to

41:55.597 --> 42:00.269
have nothing to do with the mother,
have nothing to do with father, have nothing to do with

42:00.680 --> 42:06.123
sister or wife, husband, children, anyone.

42:09.330 --> 42:13.345
But for what? For what have they given up?

42:14.345 --> 42:18.292
They gave it up for selfishness. For money.

42:18.595 --> 42:21.491
Not for something higher.

42:22.023 --> 42:27.830
Just the opposite of what
Shri Krishna did is to kill His own uncle because,

42:29.171 --> 42:35.663
to deliver His parents from their prison and also to kill a demon.

42:36.148 --> 42:37.985
He was a demon.

42:41.252 --> 42:44.235
So in our own understanding,

42:44.759 --> 42:53.874
if we understand one thing: that we are living on the soil,

42:54.192 --> 43:01.387
or on the soil of that country which is blessed by Shri Krishna,

43:04.847 --> 43:08.386
Who is called as Yogeshwara.

43:11.177 --> 43:19.036
So the first part was that when He destroyed all these things,

43:19.862 --> 43:22.475
he was a Yogeshwara.

43:23.860 --> 43:30.860
He was the Divine Energy for yoga,

43:31.932 --> 43:36.471
for union with the Divine Power.

43:37.873 --> 43:42.368
He was the Ishwara. He is the Deity.

43:43.186 --> 43:48.081
If He was a Deity and He's the One Who is the ruler of this area,

43:48.194 --> 43:51.384
then what should we be?

43:51.955 --> 43:54.641
In yoga, we should be masters.

43:56.015 --> 43:59.784
Not mentally

44:01.715 --> 44:05.890
but at that state, of the higher state.

44:07.707 --> 44:09.816
If that could be achieved,

44:12.983 --> 44:18.209
then you people should become the highest of highest yogis.

44:18.360 --> 44:24.240
Because you have that power existing in this place. It is there.

44:24.960 --> 44:29.207
So many have told Me that, "Mother, now don't You worry about,

44:31.279 --> 44:34.724
don't You worry about America. Just forget it.

44:34.749 --> 44:37.744
Why to waste time in America?

44:38.858 --> 44:42.474
It's not going to work out. It's useless."

44:42.648 --> 44:48.195
But I know such a lot of power exists
in this country of the Yogeshwara,

44:49.292 --> 44:53.248
and if you can use that power of Yogeshwara,

44:53.979 --> 45:01.201
you can do so much good to the whole humanity at this juncture

45:01.694 --> 45:05.388
when the history is taking another fall.

45:07.023 --> 45:11.021
Now those who rise in spirituality -

45:11.053 --> 45:14.552
everybody is now today talking of spirituality,

45:16.009 --> 45:19.314
even Prince of Wales the other day was talking

45:19.339 --> 45:22.595
that "We should take to spirituality not to so much materialism

45:22.614 --> 45:26.812
that has caused us ecological problems and things like that."

45:26.995 --> 45:29.406
Everybody's talking of spirituality,

45:29.430 --> 45:32.430
and you are the ones who have it with you.

45:33.009 --> 45:35.395
You are the ones who have powers with you.

45:35.705 --> 45:37.840
You are the ones who can spread it.

45:37.865 --> 45:41.497
And once you start spreading it,

45:41.569 --> 45:46.859
you'll be surprised how you will achieve

45:47.425 --> 45:54.638
tremendous heights in every sphere, in every walk of life.

45:55.643 --> 45:59.396
So your identity is that you are Sahaja Yogis

45:59.730 --> 46:04.079
and you have to use the power of Yogeshwara,

46:04.406 --> 46:08.663
Who is the presiding Deity of this country.

46:10.858 --> 46:14.191
I bless you all that you have that wisdom,

46:14.216 --> 46:16.183
that depth, to touch your depth.

46:16.192 --> 46:25.181
Somehow try to work it out, stop all nonsensical fights and things.

46:25.206 --> 46:29.784
Become collective. Try to understand each other.

46:30.157 --> 46:32.449
Try to open your hearts.

46:32.474 --> 46:35.806
You have such depth. You are born in this country

46:35.912 --> 46:39.193
because the Yogeshwara wanted you to be here

46:39.273 --> 46:43.677
and He has blessed you with all the bounties of His love.

46:45.752 --> 46:50.970
Now it is for you to use that tremendous power:

46:52.093 --> 46:55.007
but without love, we can.

46:55.111 --> 47:02.694
Because he was the embodiment of madhurya, sweetness,

47:05.871 --> 47:06.871
sweetness.

47:07.528 --> 47:15.627
That madhurya you have to imbibe,
and that madhurya you have to spread.

47:18.632 --> 47:20.771
That's very important.

47:22.009 --> 47:27.024
So, that relationship of sweetness between each other,

47:27.565 --> 47:31.556
the relation of enjoying each other,

47:32.255 --> 47:37.913
the relation of knowing each other,

47:38.972 --> 47:47.262
has to be full of sweetness, just like honey.

47:50.991 --> 47:59.333
It is just there, but we have to be the bee to reach there.

47:59.881 --> 48:02.555
And I am sure it will work out.

48:04.029 --> 48:07.016
It should work out for all of you.

48:07.993 --> 48:12.544
So those who run away from collectivity should be very careful.

48:12.608 --> 48:14.407
They are not Sahaja Yogis

48:14.424 --> 48:18.431
and if they continue like this, they'll be just thrown out.

48:18.685 --> 48:21.348
They will be nowhere in Sahaja Yoga, I tell you.

48:22.041 --> 48:30.350
So you have to, first of all, understand that to be in Sahaja Yoga

48:31.767 --> 48:39.096
is only possible if we are having that depth,

48:39.201 --> 48:44.747
because a new jump is needed in Sahaja Yoga which will work out,

48:44.795 --> 48:48.956
which is working out and many will be thrown out.

48:50.408 --> 48:55.426
You have to jump, and for that jumping you really need people

48:55.459 --> 49:02.836
who are honest and deep and serious.

49:03.789 --> 49:09.200
Don't get lost onto frivolous things and worldly things.

49:09.295 --> 49:14.665
Just seek your depth. It's all there, so beautiful.

49:16.372 --> 49:19.232
So, may God bless you!
