00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:42.624
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.280
At the very outset,

00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:50.625
we have to know one thing,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.000
that truth is what it is.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.799
We cannot organize it,

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:59.480
we cannot order it,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.400
we cannot conceptualize it also, with our human understanding.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.320
It is, it was and it will be.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.680
The essence of all religions,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.200
if you bring it down

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.799
to the one-line essence,

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:27.999
is this, that "seek the eternal",

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.999
and treat the transitory

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.320
with all understanding about it.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.760
The first part is the difficult one:

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.320
"seek the eternal".

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.560
Eternal is the truth.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.200
And what is the truth?

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:59.799
Now when I'm talking to you, you are all very well-versed and

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.999
very well-educated people.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.440
I have to request you to have an open mind,

00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:10.345
a scientific outlook

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.320
to see for yourself what I say,

00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:17.840
is the truth or not,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.160
experience it,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.960
and treat all this talk as a hypothesis.

00:06:25.424 --> 00:06:28.944
And if it turns out to be the truth,

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:32.328
then in all honesty we have to accept it.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.799
So there are two things

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:43.480
which we may not accept,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.920
but they exist.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.999
One of them is

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.999
that all this universe,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.160
all this creation,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.680
is permeated by,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.920
nourished by, looked after by

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.799
all-pervading Power of God's love.

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:11.999
In these modern times even to take God's name is too much.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.799
This is called as Paramachaitanya in Sanskrit language,

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:19.799
in Koran it is called as ruh,

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:23.520
in the Bible as the all-pervading Power of God's love,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.760
or the all-pervading Power of Divine.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.040
What we call as spirituality, divinity

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.799
is the essence of that.

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:35.799
This is first truth.

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:38.999
And the second truth is

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:46.640
that we are not this body,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.760
not this mind,

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:50.799
not the emotions,

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:53.799
not the ego, nor these thoughts.

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:58.800
Beyond that we are the Spirit, we are the pure Spirit.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.200
These are the two things

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.320
said in all religions,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.999
whatever way they must have talked about.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.440
In the olden times,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.560
when seeking started in India...

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.999
India has certain privileges compared to other countries.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.400
Firstly the climate is so good,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.999
that you can live in a jungle without much trouble.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.520
While in the West we would say

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.000
people started going outward, like a tree,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.840
the Indians started going downward into their roots.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.999
And they found out, long time back, Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.999
It's not a modern thing, it's an ancient

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.720
[unscripted] method of getting union with the Divine,

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.320
which is yoga.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.799
"Sahaja" means "born with you"

00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:01.799
- "saha" is "with," "ja" "born."

00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:03.840
Born with you is the right

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.640
to get that union with the divine Power.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.480
But "sahaja" also means "spontaneous,"

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.840
because this is the living power

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:19.799
that works it out.

00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:22.999
There is a living power within us,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.000
which has made us

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.999
human beings from amoeba stage.

00:09:28.999 --> 00:09:32.999
And now there's another residual power,

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.799
which has to connect us to the Divine.

00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:39.999
This is the real meaning of the word "yoga."

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.999
And every human being has a right

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.999
to get united to that all-pervading Power.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.520
So this is the last breakthrough of our evolution.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.280
At human level, as you know, we live in a relative world.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.800
Some people say this is good, some people say that is good.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.680
There's all a strife going on.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.799
But if it is the absolute truth

00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:08.799
there should be no two opinions about it.

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:10.840
So very humbly we must accept

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.799
that we have not yet reached that absolute truth,

00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:17.360
which proves the existence of God,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.799
which proves the existence of this all-pervading Power,

00:10:20.999 --> 00:10:23.240
which proves

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.480
the correctness of what

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.560
the great prophets, the great incarnations

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.680
have taught us.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.120
Of course religions have gone into diversions

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.160
and deviations because of human effort,

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:43.760
and they might have been

00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:46.840
apparently looking to be different,

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.640
but they were just like flowers on the Tree of Life

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.480
at different times, according to the timings.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.720
Sanskrit the word is called as "samayachara".

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.600
According to the time,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.520
the manifestation was there,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.760
but they were all created on one Tree of Life.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.320
But people plucked it,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.799
started saying, "This is mine. This is mine."

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:17.999
and with the dead flowers they started fighting.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.400
That's how we see today the problem arising.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.640
There was nothing wrong with these saints,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.960
nothing wrong with the prophets,

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.680
and nothing wrong with the incarnations.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.240
They all have done whatever was the best for us,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.799
and have tried to tell us from time to time

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:40.799
at the time of our evolution, what we have to do.

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:43.040
But mostly they have been dealing

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.440
with the transitory things, how

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.960
not to indulge into the transitory pleasures of life,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.999
but to seek the eternal.

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:58.999
The second part of it is the "Seek the eternal."

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.799
That is, to get this yoga,

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:05.680
to be united with this all-pervading Power,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.560
which gives you Self-Realization,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.640
to know the Self.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.880
"Know thy Self" - Christ has said it;

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.040
you are to be born again.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.880
Even in Sanskrit language, they call a person who is a realized soul

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.799
as "dwijaha," means "born twice."

00:12:23.999 --> 00:12:28.999
They call a bird also as "dwijaha," meaning "born twice"

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.880
- means first it's an egg

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.080
and then it becomes a free bird to fly out.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.799
In the same way a "realized soul"

00:12:36.999 --> 00:12:39.680
means a person, a human being,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.999
who is connected with that all-pervading Power.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.160
Now what is the system within us

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.999
which has been created by God Almighty?

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.999
Beautifully, because - not that He's our Creator,

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.880
but He is our loving Father,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.280
- and beautifully during our evolutionary process,

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.600
He has created a very beautiful mechanism within us.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.999
I am sorry we don't have any diagram here of that,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.999
but that is described as "Tree of Life" in the Bible,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.799
it's described as "Asas" in Koran,

00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:18.799
is described as

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:23.600
Kundalini in Sanskrit language.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.799
"Kundala" means "coils."

00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:28.799
Now this power of Kundalini,

00:13:28.999 --> 00:13:31.640
is the power

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.960
which is the power of pure desire.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.960
All other desires are impure.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.720
You know the law of economics is that

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.600
in general, wants are not satiable.

00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:52.240
Today we want to have a table, then want to have a chair,

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.640
then want to have a car, then want to have a house;

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.760
whatever we get, we are not satisfied with it.

00:13:56.999 --> 00:13:58.440
We jump from one to another.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.880
The reason is, whatever we desire

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.640
is not the pure desire.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.880
The pure desire within us, whether you are aware of it or not,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.640
is to become one with the divine Power.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.799
And unless and until this desire is fulfilled,

00:14:14.999 --> 00:14:18.640
you can never have that satisfaction,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.720
that contentment of a saint.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:27.040
So this is the work one had to do.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.160
In the early days thousands of years back,

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.480
all over the world there were realized souls.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.799
We can start right from Abraham,

00:14:38.999 --> 00:14:42.999
to Moses, to Confucius.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.960
In India there were many great saints, Adi-Nath;

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.760
from that nathpanthis they were called as.

00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:53.960
Their job was just to give awakening to people.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.799
At the time of Rama, His father-in-law

00:14:56.999 --> 00:14:59.440
was Janaka who was a king,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.799
but regarded as a very detached person, Vaidehi(?).

00:15:03.999 --> 00:15:10.120
and one disciple came to him, asked him for Self-Realization.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.440
He said, "You can ask for my kingdom,

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.799
but it is not easy to give you Self-Realization."

00:15:14.999 --> 00:15:17.999
He said, "Why?" He said, "The time has not come."

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.240
"So when will the time come?" He said, "Kali Yuga"

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.999
- that's modern times.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.160
"This is the time when people will be

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.400
living under illusions,

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.120
subranth, and they will be

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.999
under shock of destruction.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.880
They will not be able to solve their problems,

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.960
and then they will

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.400
seek the truth.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.799
And many of them who today are roaming about

00:15:49.999 --> 00:15:53.999
in the hills and dales, in the mountains Himalayas,

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.000
will settle down as householders

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.999
and they will get their Self-Realization."

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.680
That is the time today.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.280
Whatever is said about the Last Judgment,

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.799
this is the time for that Last Judgment.

00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:11.999
Also in Koran it is said

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.799
that "At the time of your Resurrection your hands will speak,

00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:18.120
and they will give witness against you."

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.400
Exactly this happens in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.080
The surah that is in Koran called as sashti yoga,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.680
it's surprising how Mohammed Sahib clearly said about it.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.040
He also said, "You won't believe it, because you are too arrogant.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.880
Because you won't be able to see that,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.799
you will be moving in another direction of fanaticism."

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.720
Clearly He has said it.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.240
But as it is, nobody likes

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.640
to really go into the details of it

00:16:47.999 --> 00:16:51.920
and to find what is between the lines.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.440
That also is a very subtle thing.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.240
For that we have to become subtle beings,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.200
and to become that subtle being

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.999
you have to get your Self-realization.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:08.240
At the time in the beginning, I would say, when they were searching,

00:17:08.999 --> 00:17:11.999
they went through their sympathetic nervous system,

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.040
praying to God or doing their Vedas and all those things.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.080
And what they saw were the different deities

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.280
sitting on the different chakras on the subtle centers,

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.400
so they started talking about the deities.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.999
So people started worshipping the deities.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.799
They wanted to have

00:17:36.999 --> 00:17:41.640
the nectar, the honey of the flower,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.280
but they started talking about the flower, worshipping the flower.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.799
So some people afterwards found it

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:53.200
that it was not proper, like Buddha, Mahavira,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.960
Mohammed Sahib, Nanaka;

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.880
all of them found that it's not proper to talk about the flowers,

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.840
because people get lost.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.880
So better talk about the honey.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.799
So one was sakara, that is,

00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:10.440
with the form - another formless.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.799
So nirakara, they started talking about the formless.

00:18:13.999 --> 00:18:16.999
This was also talk, and talk, and talk.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.999
But to reach the honey you have to be a bee,

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.999
and that's what is Self-realization is.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.440
Now this Kundalini is placed in the triangular bone,

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.999
which is called as "sacrum" in the medical term.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.680
In Latin, "sacrum" means "sacred."

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.720
That means the Greeks knew about it,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.880
otherwise why should they call it a sacred bone?

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.000
This Kundalini is awakened

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.320
as a living process,

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.760
like the seed sprouts when it is put in the Mother Earth;

00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:54.799
spontaneously rises, passes through six centers,

00:18:54.999 --> 00:18:57.120
the seventh center is below.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.040
And the seventh center is responsible for our excretion.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.440
It stops its function when it starts rising.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.480
So another myth

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.360
which says that the sex has any part to play in our ascent

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.800
is absolutely wrong,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.040
because the center of sex which is the seventh center

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.999
is lower than the Kundalini.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.760
Then it rises, pierces through six centers.

00:19:22.999 --> 00:19:27.799
And the sixth center is placed on the fontanel bone area,

00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:30.520
where it was a soft bone once upon a time.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.040
But as you grow,

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.560
through your sympathetic activity

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.800
you develop two institutions in your head.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.160
From the right activity which is, we can call

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.999
the power of action, you develop your ego like a balloon.

00:19:48.999 --> 00:19:51.480
And from the left side

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.799
which is your conditionings,

00:19:53.999 --> 00:19:56.280
you develop another balloon

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.720
which is called as "superego" in English language,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.720
but in Sanskrit is "mana."

00:20:01.999 --> 00:20:07.120
Both of them join like this, sometimes overlap each other,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.600
and the bone becomes calcified.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.999
So now you are like an egg, I would say.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.999
Then when the Kundalini rises,

00:20:19.999 --> 00:20:23.440
when the Kundalini rises, She passes through this center

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.999
which is placed between the optic chiasma, known as Agnya Chakra,

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.560
which sometimes people call it as "third eye."

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:37.080
And this center sucks in

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.799
these two institutions,

00:20:40.999 --> 00:20:42.999
opening the limbic area,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.720
and through which the Kundalini comes out,

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.720
and you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head,

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.120
the actualization of the baptism.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.960
It's an actualization, it's not just a certificate.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.920
So, like every instrument has to be connected to the mains,

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.999
you get connected with that subtle energy.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.999
And because this is the seat of your Spirit,

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.080
but the seat in human beings resides in their heart,

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.799
immediately the Spirit,

00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:18.000
start emitting light

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.280
on your central nervous system.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.960
This is a very important point one must know.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.000
So you cannot understand it through your mental activity,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.960
but through your evolutionary process,

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:38.480
you manifest a new awareness on your central nervous system.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.120
And this awareness is called - in the Christian

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.960
tradition in the olden times

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.799
they were called as gnostics.

00:21:47.999 --> 00:21:49.799
"Gna, gna" is the word. "Gna".

00:21:49.999 --> 00:21:53.400
Gna jinant is, in Sanskrit means "knowledge,"

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.200
from where the "gna" comes - "gnyana".

00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.040
In the same way the "gna", and "gnostics" they were called.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.760
And I'm sure you must have read the Book of Thomas

00:22:03.999 --> 00:22:06.960
who wrote on his way to India,

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.520
and where he has talked of many theories of Christianity also.

00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:16.799
This "gna" or this knowledge, "gnya",

00:22:16.999 --> 00:22:19.999
is the same as "bodha" in the Buddha tradition,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.760
is "to know on your central nervous system".

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:25.799
It's an experience, it's not through your brain,

00:22:25.999 --> 00:22:27.799
not with mental activity,

00:22:27.999 --> 00:22:30.999
but on your central nervous system.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.799
In the Vedas the first verse of Veda is

00:22:34.999 --> 00:22:37.960
that you have to know it in a vida.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.800
"Vida" means also "to know on your central nervous system".

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.240
All these scriptures aim at

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.000
knowing this all-pervading Power

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.799
on your central nervous system.

00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:57.999
For example, now we are human beings,

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.320
We are much better off than animals.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.520
Supposing you want to take a dog through a dirty lane,

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.600
he can easily go, or a horse, he has no problems.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.000
But we cannot pass through that,

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.120
because we have developed certain subtler senses within us.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:20.999
But once Kundalini rises and you become a realized soul,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.999
then a new dimension of awareness

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.600
develops, and a widening of your awareness.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.640
First thing that happens on your central nervous system is that,

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.799
that you become collectively conscious.

00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:38.999
Is said by Jung - Jung has it said about it

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.160
that you develop collective consciousness.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.760
You develop it, it's actualization, it's becoming.

00:23:46.999 --> 00:23:48.760
Is not just that I say that,

00:23:48.999 --> 00:23:51.280
"All right, we are all brothers and sisters.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.240
We are part and parcel of the whole."

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.720
By saying that doesn't happen, but you have to become.

00:23:56.999 --> 00:23:59.720
It's a becoming, it's a happening within us.

00:23:59.999 --> 00:24:03.040
So you can feel on your fingertips

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.720
your own centers

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.960
and the centers of another person.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.160
Very easily. Even children can feel it.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.000
This is the first awareness which we can understand

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.360
that happens.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.600
But when the Kundalini rises, She passes through a portion

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.240
which we call as Void. It's not the same as Zen, is different type;

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.999
is here in the portion which we can

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.240
call as the "ocean of illusion."

00:24:36.999 --> 00:24:40.999
It enlightens ten valencies within us.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.080
Human beings have ten valencies,

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.799
while you know that matter has eight, animals have nine,

00:24:47.999 --> 00:24:50.160
and human beings have ten valencies.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.960
These are ten dharmas,

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.840
means these are ten religions you can call it,

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.520
or the Ten Commandments within us.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.999
They just get enlightened within you,

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.440
and you become a righteous person.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.960
Like any saint. You become righteous.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.799
Nobody has to tell you "don't do this, don't do that".

00:25:09.999 --> 00:25:11.999
You just become.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.999
This is what has to happen, because

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.480
you see people belonging to any religion whatsoever,

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.040
whether it is Christianity, Hinduism,

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.520
or Islam or anyone,

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.999
they can commit any sin they want to.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.999
There's no bondage of religion in them.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.200
Anyone can commit any sin. They can kill anybody,

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.799
they can rob anybody, they can deceive anybody,

00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:43.680
they can be very mean, anything is possible,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.360
whatever religion one may follow.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.999
But when you are not innately religious as I call it,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.999
when it is not built in within you,

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.720
then this kind of faith leads to fanaticism.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.640
And I think today's main problem now

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.880
is fanaticism and fundamentalism.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.880
Everyone thinks that "We are the best, we are the chosen ones,

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.080
we have the full idea".

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.000
But actually unless and until you know the reality,

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.240
you cannot say that you have known it.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.040
So to know the reality

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.799
the Kundalini has first to be connected with the Divine,

00:26:26.999 --> 00:26:28.960
and then you have to experiment with it

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.080
and see for yourself, and find out

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.960
what is the reality, on experience.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.999
The other day one miracle happened, I must tell you that.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.560
A gentleman was sitting

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.720
and was questioning Me on a radio station,

00:26:51.999 --> 00:26:54.999
and suddenly he asked Me a question,

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.999
"Do You think this is some sort of a Messiah's work?"

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.999
I didn't answer him,

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.480
but immediately he felt cool breeze on his hand.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.880
He said, "What's happening?" He forgot he was on the tape, you see.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.799
He just said, "What's it? What is this cold, what's happening?

00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:15.240
But nothing on my head". He just got lost.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.799
He said, "Nothing on my head."

00:27:16.999 --> 00:27:19.760
I said, "All right, there's a little imbalance. Let Me work it out."

00:27:19.999 --> 00:27:21.920
And then he started feeling, "Oh God!" and he said,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.799
"See, I feel a ball, a ball of cool breeze in New Zealand!"

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:29.799
And everybody rushed from the, that area

00:27:29.999 --> 00:27:32.799
to see what is happening, what everybody has received.

00:27:32.999 --> 00:27:35.440
Just he asked a simple question like that,

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.400
and the answer came, like a computer you see it worked.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.280
And he was amazed at himself.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.999
So this is something one has to realize,

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.160
that this is the power that really does everything.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.799
What we do is to something dead.

00:27:50.999 --> 00:27:53.080
Supposing there's some trees dead, we make this table,

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.320
we think no end of ourselves - from dead to dead.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.360
Just reconstruction, we don't do any living work.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.960
But after Realization you start doing

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.960
living work.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:10.240
If you give this chaitanya or these vibrations

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.520
to crops, they grow ten times more.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.200
You don't have to even use

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.880
the non, we use non, what do you call them,

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.720
- hybrid seeds, non-hybrid seeds.

00:28:26.999 --> 00:28:29.680
And hybrid seeds

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.800
are producing less than the non-hybrid seeds

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.840
when you have given them vibrations.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.640
And the food that you eat from that

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.480
is so good, so tasty.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.999
It, you can give it to flowers, you can give it to nature,

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.480
you can give it to any sick person.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.200
When the Kundalini rises,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.799
automatically you develop your own balances,

00:28:55.999 --> 00:28:58.799
and that balanced life manifests outside.

00:28:58.999 --> 00:29:00.799
Now this ecological problem can be solved

00:29:00.999 --> 00:29:04.160
as soon as human beings get transformed and develop their balances.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.880
Because we are imbalanced,

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.240
that's why the nature has gone into imbalance.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.880
Nature is not in any imbalance.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.480
Poor thing is trying to maintain somehow balance,

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.800
despite all our hectic efforts.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.560
So our balance has to be established

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.960
so that balance comes into us,

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.999
and we start leading a life of complete balance, automatically.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.520
Automatically. Nobody has to tell you but you just don't do it,

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.999
just become that.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.800
Then another thing you can do living work,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.920
is that you can raise the Kundalini of any person,

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.999
like one enlightened light can enlighten another person.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.999
There has been lots of misconceptions about Kundalini

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.600
and I've read them, and I was amazed

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.760
because these are most unauthorized.

00:29:54.999 --> 00:29:57.760
These are all modern stuff that has come from somewhere;

00:29:57.999 --> 00:30:01.720
I think it's all a money-making propositions, perhaps,

00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:04.200
because nowhere in the ancient books is written

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.999
that Kundalini has any problems or it gives any trouble.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.440
One great saint called Ramadasa,

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.520
who was the guru of a great king called Shivaji,

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.600
he was asked, "How much time does it take for a Kundalini to rise?"

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.999
So He used the Sanskrit word tatkshana - that moment -

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.000
but there should be a person who is authorized

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.040
to do it from the Divine, and there should be a seeker of truth,

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.000
otherwise it won't work out, for years.

00:30:32.999 --> 00:30:35.080
So nowhere in the ancient books

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.520
- we have Markandeya's, which we can say

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.999
thousands of years back has written about Kundalini;

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.999
we have Adi Shankacharya, all of them

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.760
- nobody has written anything like that.

00:30:44.999 --> 00:30:48.360
In the twelfth century Gyaneshwara has written about Kundalini.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.320
Nobody has said this is dangerous.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.999
This is a modern stuff, I think coming from Germany,

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.880
because Germans came here and somebody told them something,

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.760
and they have written down. It's most unauthorized and wrong.

00:30:59.999 --> 00:31:04.800
Now there are forty nations which are working out Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.560
forty nations.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.480
And nowhere we have found this kind of a thing that it's dangerous,

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.999
this thing happens, that thing happens - nothing of the kind.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.080
On the contrary,

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.720
people get physical fitness, mental fitness.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.640
We have got three doctors from Delhi University

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.799
who have done their MD

00:31:25.999 --> 00:31:27.080
with Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.999
and have proved that with Sahaja Yoga you can cure

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.960
very incurable diseases.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.320
I must tell you a very great news, that in Perth

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.640
husband and wife who had AIDS got cured

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.520
in this tour of Mine,

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.880
just by their own powers.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.799
You don't have to do anything about it - their own powers,

00:31:46.999 --> 00:31:49.360
just worked out. I hope they keep up.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.280
We had cured one other gentleman here, Mr. Granby,

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.720
last time when I came here,

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.999
but he had no will power to continue with it.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.560
If he had a little bit put attention to it,

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.480
he would have been all right. And his father is very sorry

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.999
that he went back to the same bad habits, and he got it back.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.000
So many things can be explained about

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.760
things which we do not know, about the soul,

00:32:16.999 --> 00:32:20.240
about possessions,

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.680
about evil forces -

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.680
all sorts of things one can see,

00:32:24.999 --> 00:32:26.880
once you get your Self-Realization.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.040
Before that we are in a confused state,

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.120
and that's why they say that

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.640
when the Spirit shines,

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.720
there are three things which manifest within us.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:44.440
One of them is the truth,

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.640
that you know the absolute truth.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.200
On your fingertips you can ask any question, "Is there God?"

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.960
- the question. Answer is "yes" - you start feeling the cool breeze.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.999
Somebody who says he's a saint, all right, just feel him.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.120
You might get heat,

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.080
you might even sometimes get a little blister

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.720
from some horrible person who is just a money-maker

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.920
or a sorcerer trying to say that he's a saint.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.360
So that's how you develop the absolute truth

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.200
on your central nervous system.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:20.280
As I can feel this glass, you can feel

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.240
a person, his centers.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.640
Sitting down here you can - I mean, it's at an evolved state -

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.760
you can feel anybody's centers.

00:33:30.999 --> 00:33:33.880
Just you have to think about it. It's like a computer.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.920
You are all divine computers, fantastic things,

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.520
which thinks and which produces results,

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.840
which you have to be.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.320
We should not in any way

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.200
have our estimation very low.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.280
Actually we are made human beings

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.560
to be something very great, and we are that.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.999
But there's a little gap which we have to cross.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.040
Like in our Indian village if I take a television and show them,

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.200
and say that, "See, in this television you can see

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.640
pictures from all over," they'll say, "What? This is just a box.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.240
How can we see something in it?"

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.480
And you put to the mains, and then they can see how fantastic it is.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.120
In the same way we have to know our potential

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.560
by being connected to the mains,

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.400
and then you'll be amazed that we are great,

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.799
all of us.

00:34:30.999 --> 00:34:32.800
Specially the seekers of truth,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.799
have the first right to get their yoga.

00:34:35.999 --> 00:34:38.680
But if you are still indulging with your mental things

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.880
and you want to have a mental acrobats,

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.799
still busy with all that, then

00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:46.080
Divine says, "All right, go ahead, play,

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.240
try some more of this.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.280
We'll see next time."

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.720
But you don't have to have blind faith for anything.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.999
Blind faith leads to fanaticism.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.999
You shouldn't have blind faith at all.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.480
You have to experience,

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.799
and after experiencing

00:35:03.999 --> 00:35:08.040
if you do not have faith, that means you are not honest.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.560
This is a very simple method which works out,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.320
and you are all capable of getting that,

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.360
and you should not miss the point.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.999
I don't know, because I have spoken on this subject

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.240
so many times and it's such a vast knowledge,

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.400
there must have been at least three to four thousand tapes of Mine

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.280
in English language alone.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.080
So in this small lecture I cannot cover all the points.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.799
But I would like to have a discussion, or

00:35:38.999 --> 00:35:40.680
if you want to ask Me questions

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.760
will be better to give more time to it.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.520
But you have to know that I am not here to sort of

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.960
ask for any votes, or ask for anything.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.160
I'm here to tell you what you have and what you can achieve,

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.999
so the questions should be relevant and not aggressive;

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.880
it would be a better idea to know something about it.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.640
So may God bless you all.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.760
Steven, you'll have to...

00:36:17.999 --> 00:36:20.960
you see, I'm rather bad at Australian English.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.560
- I'll mediate for You.
- Yes, you please tell Me.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.800
- Feel free to ask any questions.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.880
And those who are uncomfortable standing,

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.280
you may want to sit down somewhere -

00:36:40.999 --> 00:36:42.999
on the floor.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.800
Yes.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.680
Is there anybody wanting to,

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.960
to ask something? ...

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.600
Rachel - this will be Canadian English so...

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.999
I speak Canadian English so that maybe it's clearer.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:08.160
Q: You pointed to the problem of mental acrobatics,

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.680
intellectual indulgence and so forth.

00:37:11.999 --> 00:37:16.880
At what point can someone who has crossed over the gap

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.999
and who has achieved perhaps a pure desire,

00:37:21.999 --> 00:37:26.440
at what point can that person articulate intellectually

00:37:27.999 --> 00:37:29.799
what he or she has achieved;

00:37:29.999 --> 00:37:32.999
or can You articulate?

00:37:33.999 --> 00:37:38.200
- You see, when you are mentally working it out,

00:37:38.999 --> 00:37:42.560
then you reach a point where you think

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.680
you have not achieved whatever is said in it

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.999
- that's the point.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.080
As we say that first

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.400
one has to know it mentally also.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.120
"Not this, not this, not this," you go on

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.720
- "Ya neti neti vachanaih" it is said.

00:38:01.999 --> 00:38:03.840
So "It is not this, this is not so.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.280
This cannot be, this cannot be."

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:10.200
Then you reach a point, then you become a seeker.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:16.440
And a new kind of a category is created,

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.680
which William Blake has very nicely categorized,

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.480
and he says, then he called them men of God.

00:38:23.999 --> 00:38:26.799
"Men of God will become men of God,

00:38:26.999 --> 00:38:30.960
and they'll have powers to make others men of God."

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.799
He was really a great, great poet hundred years back,

00:38:35.999 --> 00:38:38.999
but people thought him to be mad, I tell you;

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.920
they thought him to be mad,

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.799
because it has happened with all the saints

00:38:42.999 --> 00:38:47.160
because they are on a different level, you see.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.640
Even Kabira has said, "How am I to explain,

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.880
they are all, the whole world is blind, [samaja ganda].

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.960
The whole world is blind. How am I to explain to them?"

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.400
They feel so frustrated sometimes.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.560
How to explain?

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.440
So on mental level it, as I have talked to you,

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.880
I have explained to you in a way.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.040
But still it has to be your experience,

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.280
you shouldn't believe in Me blindly, it's not proper.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.880
You have to experience.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.280
- Some people have said that the moment you describe

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.799
and articulate your enlightenment you are actually not enlightened,

00:39:25.999 --> 00:39:28.799
and that it actually is

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:31.880
contrary to enlightenment to talk about it.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.000
How do You feel about those things?

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.800
You see, these are all money-making propositions.

00:39:39.999 --> 00:39:42.799
Most of them don't know anything about it.

00:39:42.999 --> 00:39:46.080
So they just say, because you see if you start an organization,

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.799
"Oh, I have such an organization, this and that."

00:39:48.999 --> 00:39:50.999
Then people say, "All right, then raise our Kundalini."

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.400
"No, no, no, no, no, Kundalini you just don't talk,

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.280
it's a very bad thing."

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.760
In Gyaneshwari, which is one of the greatest books, I think,

00:39:58.999 --> 00:40:01.720
written about Gita by Gyaneshwara,

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.480
at the age of twenty-three years

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.999
- imagine what a tremendous genius he must have been

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.960
- and in the sixth chapter He described everything about Kundalini.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.600
But in the Hindu religion it's prohibited, especially in Maharashtra,

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.999
to read even that.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.560
What do you say to that?

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.799
[Ishita] as they call it, no, not to be read, it's not to be read

00:40:27.999 --> 00:40:30.800
- I think what Rachel is getting at

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.200
though applies more to Buddhism,

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.800
that if for example in our head

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.799
say it, "Look, I've attained to Nirvana,

00:40:43.999 --> 00:40:46.480
I've been enlightened,"

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:52.360
then even within the community of bikus or the whole sanga

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.720
they would laugh and say, "Oh, you can't be,

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.200
because you're articulating it, you're saying,

00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.999
you know, 'I'm enlightened,'

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.760
it doesn't go with enlightenment."

00:41:02.999 --> 00:41:06.799
So there is a difference between that position

00:41:06.999 --> 00:41:09.880
and the way You're talking about Realization.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.840
- Not at all. You see, early, early Buddhists

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.680
- My son-in-law has written a nice book about

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.320
Manasarovar and this thing, and he went round

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.200
and he has studied Buddhism,

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.799
and he has gone to the caves where the earlier Buddhists lived.

00:41:23.999 --> 00:41:26.360
And they just talked of spontaneous awakening

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.440
and the experiences like the Thomas has talked.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.999
But this is a much later thing

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.960
when the quarrel started with Mahayana, this, that.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.799
They formulated it, organized it, and this, and all that.

00:41:38.999 --> 00:41:41.799
But actually if you see to it,

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:44.120
Buddha Himself

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.999
is one of the part of the Kundalini.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.999
You have to use His name;

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.920
He is the one who controls our ego, in evolution.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:04.999
Now when they say, "Buddham sharanam gacchami",

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:10.000
means "I surrender myself to the enlightened one"

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.799
"Buddham sharanam gacchami."

00:42:12.999 --> 00:42:16.280
Then they say, "Dharmam sharanam gacchami."

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.720
"Dharmam" is that valency business I'm talking about,

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:24.999
that "I surrender myself to my valencies, my dharma" - dharma.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:29.240
And the third one He said is, "Sangam sharanam gacchami."

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.920
That means, "I surrender myself to collectivity".

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.840
Is Sahaja Yoga only,

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.280
but you should be able to see between the lines.

00:42:39.999 --> 00:42:41.960
Same about Gita.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.640
If you read Gita superficially,

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.760
you will think that He has said about karma yoga

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:50.800
and He has said about gyana yoga.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.320
Now what gyana yoga is, what I'm talking about,

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.960
that you have to know it on your central nervous system.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.720
But Krishna didn't talk much about it.

00:43:01.999 --> 00:43:05.520
So then Arjuna asked, "What about the karma?"

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.400
So Krishna was a incarnation of diplomacy, I must say,

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.120
divine diplomacy,

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.680
because He knew about the human brain,

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.360
and He knew how to put it forward.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:21.400
So He said, "All right, you do all your karmas,

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.280
and put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord",

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.480
which cannot be, it's not possible.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.080
We may mentally think, "Oh, I'm doing all for God's sake.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.640
I'm doing this." That's just our imagination.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.720
But you just don't do it, because the karma has to become akarma,

00:43:37.999 --> 00:43:39.960
means "non-action".

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.280
That's only possible when you get your Self-Realization.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.640
When a Self-realized soul gives you Kundalini, he doesn't say,

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.799
raises your Kundalini, doesn't say, "I do it".

00:43:48.999 --> 00:43:52.280
He says, "It's rising, it's going, it's working out."

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.280
In the third person he talks,

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.240
so the whole thing becomes akarma.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.840
Then He says that pushpam palam toyam

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.799
"Whatever are the flowers and things like that

00:44:02.999 --> 00:44:06.720
you give Me" - that's the bhakti yoga - "I'll take it."

00:44:06.999 --> 00:44:10.840
But He uses only one word on which He has made everybody dance,

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.280
and that word is "ananya" - ananya bhakti,

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:19.000
"When there is not the other, when you are united with Me."

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.640
But people say, "We are doing ananya bhakti,"

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.999
and then you find such horrible things.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.999
These people who are devoted and doing all these things,

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.880
taking ganja, taking this, how can they do it?

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.280
People can't understand, so it is not ananya.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.760
Ananya is only possible when you get your Self-Realization;

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.640
otherwise it's not possible.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.280
- So You are saying that actually

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:50.920
ones who wrote about their [particular] experiences

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.960
are true mystics. Then You know it's not [unclear]

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.280
but some people would discount the mystics.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.720
There would be true mystics people have then written about

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.320
what they have tried to explain, their experience,

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.799
like [unclear] John of the Cross.

00:45:05.999 --> 00:45:08.999
- I couldn't hear. Can you explain to Me?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.200
- She's asking - this is Jacqueline -

00:45:13.999 --> 00:45:17.840
that You are saying then

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.680
that mystics

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.760
who have written about their own mystical experiences,

00:45:23.999 --> 00:45:25.799
are truly mystics.

00:45:25.999 --> 00:45:28.400
But just because they've talked about them

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.799
and written about them, you know, doesn't mean that...

00:45:30.999 --> 00:45:33.680
But there are many mystics who are real

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.040
and there are many mystics who are not.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.280
Anybody can call themselves as mystics.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.120
I've seen there are Sufis,

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.799
who are real Sufis, and there are many who are not.

00:45:42.999 --> 00:45:46.320
There are many who are saints, real saints, and there are not.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.560
How will you make them out?

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.800
With vibrations you can make them out,

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.800
that's the only way.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
So their experiences, whatever it is,

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.999
are not to be taken for granted.

00:46:03.999 --> 00:46:05.799
- But I was saying that a mystic

00:46:05.999 --> 00:46:08.720
who returns to the market place so to speak,

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.999
and relates their experience to all

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.280
like John of the Cross [did in poems], he didn't want to relate it

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.799
but he was compelled by the requests of people

00:46:18.999 --> 00:46:21.040
around him in his community ...

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.799
[unclear] anyway to relate his experience,

00:46:25.999 --> 00:46:29.520
- and that's sort of something shared in the collective.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:34.720
So that if someone who has the experience, like a shaman,

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:39.480
and then can bring it back for healing to others, to the collective.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.640
- You cannot share it like that.

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.320
At human level you cannot share it.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.280
You have to be at the higher level, you cannot share it.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.680
It's like something you have to see in histology,

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.799
you have to use a microscope.

00:46:51.999 --> 00:46:54.280
In the same way you have to be a subtler being

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.999
to share the experience of a mystic, you cannot share it.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.520
Like see, Khalil Gibran, Khalil Gibran.

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.200
What will you say, was he a realized soul or not?

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.920
Some will say yes, some will say no.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.720
I'll say yes, of course he was.

00:47:16.999 --> 00:47:21.000
- But I consider it a sharing if someone can say to someone else

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.960
- You cannot share unless and until,

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.120
unless and until you become a realized soul.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:30.760
Because there are so many barriers between two persons,

00:47:30.999 --> 00:47:32.799
you cannot share with anyone.

00:47:32.999 --> 00:47:34.600
It is within yourself.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.799
- I'm not perhaps trying to choose the right words,

00:47:36.999 --> 00:47:38.880
but I just mean in the sense of

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.760
how the people for whom John of the Cross wrote, for example,

00:47:42.999 --> 00:47:45.040
were needing reassurance

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.999
and perhaps guidance in their realization.

00:47:50.999 --> 00:47:54.999
- She is using the example of a famous Spanish mystic,

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.280
John of the Cross.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.999
It's a very, very interesting person

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.240
with deep spiritual experiences,

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:08.799
who then conveyed something of his experiences

00:48:08.999 --> 00:48:11.680
to ordinary people.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.640
- I mean, You are conveying Your experiences to ordinary people...

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.799
- No, I say your experiences.

00:48:16.999 --> 00:48:20.040
I am just telling. I didn't tell you anything about My experiences.

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:24.320
I am saying that you have to experience yourself, not saying that;

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.520
and now I would say, now you are taking the Spanish people -

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.440
[Illán], have you read [Illán]?

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.960
That's the one who is a realized soul.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.480
He is a realized soul, I mean, you can see it is a realized soul.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.720
I mean, you take his book and you have vibrations in your hands.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.240
- Did You meet John?

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.760
- Do realized souls ever feel lured

00:48:51.999 --> 00:48:53.880
take a leading part in public life?

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:57.799
And if so, does it make society a better place when they do it,

00:48:57.999 --> 00:48:59.880
even though the people under them are only

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.160
seeking or not realized at all?

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.880
- Of course! I mean, this will not only make a beautiful society

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.960
of very beautiful people - now,

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.799
last year we had eighty-two marriages, international marriages,

00:49:12.999 --> 00:49:15.999
and all these marriages are successful.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:20.280
It's very well-balanced, beautiful

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.680
- one or two mishaps sometimes, one or two mishaps.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:30.320
And the children they have, are all realized souls,

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.799
because there are realized souls who want to take birth,

00:49:32.999 --> 00:49:35.799
but they want to seek proper parents, you see,

00:49:35.999 --> 00:49:38.999
they don't want to be born to crazy ones, you know;

00:49:39.999 --> 00:49:42.720
Naturally, I mean, they have to think about it.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:46.880
And so many are now today realized souls, otherwise also born,

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.720
but parents don't know about them.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.760
Are there any leaders in public life in the world today

00:49:53.999 --> 00:49:55.799
who are realized people, what You think?

00:49:55.999 --> 00:49:58.680
SM: Of course! Gorbachev is.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.400
Abraham Lincoln was,

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.999
Sadat was - so many.

00:50:05.999 --> 00:50:09.999
Then Mahatma Gandhi was there, he was a realized soul.

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.999
Yes, Michelle.

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:18.840
- Now I can express my dissatisfaction

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.360
with all these accounts, mystical accounts which I've read.

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.799
I've read quite a few,

00:50:24.999 --> 00:50:28.400
and they seem not speak to me.

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.720
I feel, yes, they've achieved something,

00:50:31.999 --> 00:50:35.520
but the way they express it doesn't reach me.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.960
It's like they don't speak the right language for me.

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.799
Now surprisingly when I read the philosophy of people

00:50:41.999 --> 00:50:46.799
who I think are not enlightened or they make mistakes, but somehow

00:50:46.999 --> 00:50:50.240
I'm already led somewhere much better than these accounts.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:53.520
So I think it's important that these realized souls

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.760
have good abilities to,

00:50:56.999 --> 00:50:59.799
have some special language to reach the masses.

00:50:59.999 --> 00:51:03.800
I think someone who is a computer programmer who gets enlightened

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.480
would have great ability to move other computer programmers.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.720
- This is what Sahaja Yoga is doing, it's bridging you;

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.440
this is what Sahaja Yoga does.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.999
Then you understand all of them,

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.440
you'll understand all of them.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.680
You'll be surprised,

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.520
when I started Sahaja Yoga in London,

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.200
when My husband got posted there,

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.280
I had to really struggle with seven hippies

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.480
for four years, I tell you - terrible!

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:39.240
They were all very well-educated people from Cambridge, this, that,

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.880
all very well-educated, had become hippies.

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.160
Out of their seeking they had become hippies.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.880
They thought by becoming hippies they'll seek God, whatever it is.

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.680
But when they got their Realization,

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.440
just they said, "Now we understand all of them".

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.240
They went to the libraries, found out this is that, that is that.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:02.880
I mean, the scholarship of England I saw then,

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.040
when they got their Realization. Before that -

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.240
Bacon is there, all right, writing this way, that way;

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.920
then they found out all the people who were realized souls,

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.040
and the best of all was Shakespeare.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.999
Like this, they announced...

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.799
It's hard, it's a little hard

00:52:27.999 --> 00:52:29.920
for me to hear everything You say...

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.999
- I'm sorry.
- But am I correct

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.360
in hearing You speak of children as realized souls?

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.999
- Yes.
- And in that case

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.999
is Self-Realization

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.920
a gift,

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:51.799
or is it the work of a person

00:52:51.999 --> 00:52:56.560
over a period of time of maturing?

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:59.640
It is a - you see, those I'm saying are realized souls

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.720
have received their Realization in previous lives.

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.960
And now, it's not a gift, it's just a evolutionary process.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:11.999
Just works out. It's a living process of a living energy.

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.840
- Now, you explain...

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.799
- Just wondering if You think there's a difference

00:53:24.999 --> 00:53:27.799
between the Eastern and Western psyche;

00:53:27.999 --> 00:53:30.960
and if You do, what do You think the differences are?

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.999
- Yes.

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:39.999
Now the Western movement has been outward,

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.200
like a tree,

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:45.440
the whole civilization grew up.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.680
But it must seek its roots.

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.520
To My eye there's not two things, East and West -

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.920
the roots are the same as the tree;

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:59.720
and if the tree does not find out its roots, it will be destroyed.

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.680
Both are essential,

00:54:02.999 --> 00:54:05.360
complementary to each other.

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.999
But because, as I told you, the climate in India

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.520
has been quite kind,

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:16.680
they went more into the search of themselves - "why are we here?"

00:54:17.999 --> 00:54:19.280
- instead of fighting the nature.

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:23.999
But if you see the - I mean in London if you have to go out,

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.480
you take at least fifteen minutes just to put on all your weapons

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.120
to fight the climate there.

00:54:33.999 --> 00:54:37.680
In our country you can just walk out, no problem.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.080
So we didn't have to fight the nature,

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.480
so that question was over;

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.999
and it was a very beautiful country,

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.999
full of fruits and things,

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.480
so they could live in the jungles very well.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.720
Even now if you go,

00:54:54.999 --> 00:54:58.560
at the foothill of Himalayas you'll find all kinds of flowers,

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.200
beautiful things there are.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.360
Of course now it's destroyed, because of civilization.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.360
So the people indulged more in finding out

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.640
what is within us,

00:55:09.999 --> 00:55:12.240
and that's how they did it.

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.999
So the search which is outside through science

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:19.480
has to be substantiated and nourished by spirituality -

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.920
it's very important.

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.560
So these are part and parcel of the same.

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.280
God has made only one world, one world.

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.999
He didn't make many nations, we have done it.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.799
And sometimes I feel we were moved like criminals

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.799
with our number-plate, you see,

00:55:37.999 --> 00:55:40.720
the passport number, this number, that number.

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.999
God didn't make that way, it's our idea;

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.799
because we laugh the same way,

00:55:49.999 --> 00:55:51.799
we smile the same way,

00:55:51.999 --> 00:55:54.920
we love the same way, everything is the same.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.120
But He had to create variety of faces,

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.560
otherwise we would have been bored stiff!

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.799
You'll be surprised, we have those forty nations I said,

00:56:10.999 --> 00:56:13.640
specially Russians.

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.640
I must say a word for Russians specially, you see.

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:20.999
Whatever may have been the mistakes of their

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.840
dominating

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.999
administrations and things, whatever they had,

00:56:29.999 --> 00:56:32.000
there's one thing good:

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.360
as they didn't deal with politics and other things, you see,

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:38.640
they put their minds to search within.

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.640
They're very well-read people, very well-educated,

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.680
very deep scientists also,

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:48.080
but all of them have one mind in the science

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.880
and another mind towards the Spirit.

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.799
And I was amazed when I went there to Leningrad

00:56:53.999 --> 00:56:55.640
and they had never heard about Me,

00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:58.440
because there are no books available on Sahaja Yoga,

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.560
or I've never written any books so far.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.240
There were two thousand people sitting outside

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.999
and two thousand inside, in the hall.

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:10.240
And after the lecture I gave Realization there

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.800
- of course, this Realization works out en masse -

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.999
and when they came out, they all asked Me, "Mother, what about us?"

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.600
I said, "I'm sorry, the hall is small.

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.320
If you can come tomorrow in this ground, I'll be here."

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.080
Next morning I went there, the two thousand outside ones

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:30.400
and inside ones all were there to meet Me.

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.480
And now it has become sort of an,

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:38.000
you can say, a kind of a big wave of Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:44.880
They sent their people for filming in India,

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:49.280
and they have accepted us as an independent organization

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.640
for medical treatment, for education.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:55.520
They are going to give us a big house,

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.800
everything, I mean whatever we want - the government.

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:06.520
So sort of they were just waiting for it,

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.520
just waiting for it.

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.999
- Tell.
- In week of...

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.799
I'm getting [many signs of] people who would like to ask questions.

00:58:17.999 --> 00:58:21.160
That, that's fine, but is there anybody else

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:23.520
liking to ask a question?

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.799
I didn't explain earlier that Mother is a medical doctor,

00:58:27.999 --> 00:58:30.840
so there may be questions, say, connecting,

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.799
you know, healing with what She's talking about.

00:58:34.999 --> 00:58:36.799
And since She's talked about politics,

00:58:36.999 --> 00:58:39.799
I forgot to mention that She is the wife of,

00:58:39.999 --> 00:58:42.480
I think, the senior-most public servant in the United Nations.

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.920
He's Secretary General,

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.760
he's the senior-most Secretary-General of the UN.

00:58:47.999 --> 00:58:52.960
- Of the United Nations. So if you like to ask about politics even,

00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.640
She's very well-informed.

00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.960
-What's his name?

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.560
- And on top of that I forgot to welcome

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:05.320
- Ah, it's rather difficult then...
- those who've come from within the

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.760
Sahaja Yoga community; that I welcome you all,

00:59:09.999 --> 00:59:11.720
those who come from that community,

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:13.840
who may have particular questions

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.960
that they'd like to ask You in this context,

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.799
and by all means feel free about that,

00:59:18.999 --> 00:59:22.640
before we get back to those who want to ask You second questions -

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.640
Anybody here? John.

00:59:27.999 --> 00:59:31.240
We've all had experiences. Generally I find

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:33.799
- and I've explored experience to some extent -

00:59:33.999 --> 00:59:37.760
my experiences seem to be limited by

00:59:37.999 --> 00:59:40.040
my senses, my physical presence here.

00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.799
And if there is this all-pervading Power,

00:59:43.999 --> 00:59:46.999
that is something which is transcendent to my senses,

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:50.880
it seems to me paradoxical. How can I experience this,

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:55.999
when all my experience is bound by my senses?

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.240
I mean, is there a real experience of that?

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.360
You see, I still don't know that.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.920
Experience of what?

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.880
Well, You said that a person can have experience of this power,

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.680
this transcendental power, when this is something I suppose I know.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.760
Yes, of course, of course it is there.

01:00:11.999 --> 01:00:14.000
And not only that, but you go beyond your mind,

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.480
because you reach a state which is called as thoughtless awareness,

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.480
thoughtless awareness. You are aware,

01:00:20.999 --> 01:00:22.400
but there's no thought.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.799
For example, a thought rises within us and then it falls,

01:00:25.999 --> 01:00:28.120
and another thought rises and falls.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.999
We live either in the past or in the future;

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.920
on the cusp of these thoughts we are dancing all the time.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.120
So when the Kundalini rises these thoughts become lean,

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.800
and there's a space in between which is the present,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
which in Sanskrit is called as "vilamba".

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.840
So when the Kundalini rises

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.760
you become thoughtless.

01:00:51.999 --> 01:00:53.360
If you want to think you can think it,

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.799
but if you don't want to think you are in thoughtless awareness.

01:00:55.999 --> 01:00:57.840
That's the samadhi state, that's the state

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.799
of what you call is the meditative state,

01:01:00.999 --> 01:01:04.600
where first is called as "thoughtless awareness".

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.640
In Sanskrit it's called as "nirvichara samadhi".

01:01:07.999 --> 01:01:10.000
Then the second state that is achieved

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:15.080
is called as "doubtless awareness," called as "Nirvikalpa" - means

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.560
you are so evolved that

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.040
you have no doubts about it, you just work it out.

01:01:22.999 --> 01:01:24.640
And in a sense that it's beyond,

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.080
even that it's an experience, it's also beyond experience.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.799
It's like an experience beyond experience,

01:01:29.999 --> 01:01:31.880
because that is an experience of something

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.880
on which all other experiences are based.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.799
- Yes, it is beyond that, of course.

01:01:35.999 --> 01:01:38.799
So in a sense it's like an end of experience, at the same time.

01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:42.799
No, no, no, no! The experience is of the feeling

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:46.799
this all-pervading Power, is precise - all right?

01:01:46.999 --> 01:01:49.240
And then the experience

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.999
of feeling your centers on your fingertips, to be precise.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.999
Then the experience is

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.680
that you can become thoughtlessly aware.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.880
Then the experience is that if you want to work on other people,

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.560
you find that you can find out about their own centers,

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.840
and you can raise their Kundalini

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.320
and you can give them Realization.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.799
So you start experiencing yourself,

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:19.920
like you enter into a big palace - that's yourself.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.480
So first you enter into the hall,

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.720
then you see other things and then other things,

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.080
and you're amazed at yourself.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.360
It's like that. It's a new dimensions into which you enter.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.799
-Yes, state...

01:02:36.999 --> 01:02:40.320
Yes, this is actually more a political question, but

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.799
one of the things that fascinates me

01:02:41.999 --> 01:02:43.160
about world politics at the moment

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.120
actually seems to be the Hindu fundamentalism.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.760
Possibly You give us ....

01:02:47.999 --> 01:02:50.360
- What's it?
- [unclear] Hindu fundamentalism.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.799
Would You like to comment on Hindu fundamentalism?

01:02:53.999 --> 01:02:57.640
They are just like anybody else, what's there to comment?

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.920
But it was very late they started.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.520
The reason was also because of the Sikh aggression.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.240
The Sikhs started killing people in Punjab,

01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:13.999
saying that

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.400
"you are Hindus".

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.840
So they formed themselves into a group,

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.600
"All right, we are Hindus, so what?"

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.280
to protect themselves, more sort of protective way they started it.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.960
But whatever it is I don't agree with that much,

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.799
that why don't they get Realization?

01:03:31.999 --> 01:03:34.999
- nobody can touch you.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.920
But they'll come round, I think, all of them one day.

01:03:41.999 --> 01:03:43.560
- Alex.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:48.800
When the realized people write up the accounts of their experience,

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.160
can you discern in those - and You might like to comment -

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.520
whether there are any common elements

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.320
in what I might call in the Western thinking,

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.560
triggers for the surrendered life.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.200
In other words, experiences that they might have had which led them

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.680
into the experience of enlightenment.

01:04:08.999 --> 01:04:10.320
I'm interested in this question

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.799
from the point of view of the alcoholic, actually,

01:04:12.999 --> 01:04:16.799
how it is that an alcoholic does undergo a cognitive change,

01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:21.080
a very pronounced cognitive change when he's being rehabilitated,

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.799
particularly in a program like the AA.

01:04:23.999 --> 01:04:27.560
In the enlightened regime,

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.120
are there triggers or indications

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.799
that enlightenment might be just around the corner,

01:04:33.999 --> 01:04:37.720
or something which led you into it? Does that make sense?

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.360
- Triggering what?

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.799
Triggers, now trigger is are what you pull when you shoot guns!

01:04:42.999 --> 01:04:46.600
I know, I know that part.

01:04:47.999 --> 01:04:51.280
But one other way of referring to these triggers

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.520
is what we call predisposing factors

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.240
for enlightenment.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.440
Are people

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.480
because of the evolutionary process

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.840
in a position where there are more predisposing factors

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.280
for them to become enlightened,

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.520
or are there certain things which could happen in their lives?

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.800
Like You use the example of the Kali Yuga, it's so oppressive,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.600
so you know, suddenly you realize

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.640
something desperately has to be done.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.799
But I must tell you that the Divine is so anxious

01:05:24.999 --> 01:05:28.920
to give you realization, it doesn't bother about anything.

01:05:29.999 --> 01:05:33.520
And we can compare our evolutionary process

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.999
to a spacecraft.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.840
In a spacecraft like Sputnik or anything

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.920
there's a container, first container,

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.600
and it has containers in it.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.999
So the first container, containing all other containers, flies.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:51.880
But when it goes up to a point

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.480
it has a certain velocity, and then as you say, triggers

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.760
- means there's an explosion,

01:05:57.999 --> 01:06:00.880
and the second container is thrown

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.040
with a much greater velocity.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.799
Like that it happens. Now we are

01:06:05.999 --> 01:06:07.999
as the last container, we should think,

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.240
and the triggering is so fast, I am Myself amazed

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.600
at the working out of this.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.640
It is not bothered

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.440
as to what you have done, anything you have sinned, so-called

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.999
- your guilt is all nonsense now,

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.799
everything is absolutely a nonsense.

01:06:23.999 --> 01:06:25.200
It just works out.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.799
You don't have to do any cleansing, nothing of the kind,

01:06:27.999 --> 01:06:29.640
it just works out.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:34.000
It's like a torrential, we can say rain of the grace.

01:06:35.999 --> 01:06:37.999
It is happening.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.720
But there are no common indications? It's just like going back...

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.720
No, no, no, nothing;

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.999
nothing of the kind, nothing.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.999
- As a practicing Sahaja yogi,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.600
I've experienced the benefits of thoughtless awareness

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.799
and the benefits of Sahaja Yoga.

01:07:03.999 --> 01:07:07.280
What or how different would my life be

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.760
or my experiences be,

01:07:09.999 --> 01:07:11.799
when I've attained doubtless awareness?

01:07:11.999 --> 01:07:14.799
Is that the aim also of the Sahaja yogi,

01:07:14.999 --> 01:07:17.799
to strive towards doubtless awareness?

01:07:17.999 --> 01:07:19.799
And then how different

01:07:19.999 --> 01:07:21.799
or what changes would I experience

01:07:21.999 --> 01:07:25.999
in doubtless awareness, when I am a practicing Sahaja yogini?

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.440
In doubtless awareness when you rise from thoughtless awareness,

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.520
what happens that you start growing,

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.799
because only in present you grow.

01:07:34.999 --> 01:07:37.999
You start growing, and then

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:42.080
you feel like doing it for others also.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.799
You want to help others, you want to talk about it, work it out.

01:07:45.999 --> 01:07:48.000
This is sort of a, the collective,

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:53.400
we can say the collective generosity starts,

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:57.280
and you start working it out for others, you talk to other people

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.920
and you start raising their Kundalini, helping them and all that.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.799
As a result of that you can become very powerful.

01:08:04.999 --> 01:08:09.280
You can even control the elements, so many things you can control,

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.640
and it's limitless,

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.920
because it is something really

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:19.520
that is, we can say is beyond our conception

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.999
how far we can go. It's tremendous.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.920
Just to follow that,

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.560
how would I personally work

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.600
towards realizing this state more and more and more strongly,

01:08:32.999 --> 01:08:36.280
this state of doubtless awareness? How do I

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.080
surrender myself more and more? What things would I do?

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.720
For that Buddha has told you that "Sangam sharanam gacchami"

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.480
- you have to come in the collective.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.080
It works in the collective, because it's the work of the collective.

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:53.120
Once you are with the collective, all the collective is growing

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.640
and with that you grow.

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.360
So you have to be in the collective.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.799
If you sit at home, do meditation, you won't grow.

01:09:00.999 --> 01:09:03.200
You have to be in the collective, that's all.

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.799
And in the collective you just ascend very easily,

01:09:06.999 --> 01:09:08.999
no problem.

01:09:09.999 --> 01:09:11.840
Some people have touched so fast,

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.640
and some people are still little bit not there,

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:19.840
but because those who are higher, they just pull them up.

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.040
It's a collective happening.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.720
So being out among the people ... ?

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.799
Yes, all those who are realized souls

01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:32.920
- must mix with them, talk to them, be with them,

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.760
you should sing songs,

01:09:34.999 --> 01:09:36.999
and they enjoy together, it's very enjoyable.

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.040
The way they enjoy each other is very wonderful.

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.960
I'll quote a beautiful poem written by

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:48.999
one very famous poet, Namadeva, who was just a tailor,

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.880
and was very much appreciated by Nanaka,

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.680
and he said that "Now you better write in Punjabi language".

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:58.799
So he wrote such a big book of things in Punjabi language,

01:09:58.999 --> 01:10:01.440
and is used in the Guru Granth Sahib.

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.480
He was a poet from Maharashtra.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.799
So one day he went to see another realized soul,

01:10:07.999 --> 01:10:10.880
who was a potter.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.799
His name was Gora Kumbhar,

01:10:12.999 --> 01:10:16.799
and this potter was busy kneading his clay

01:10:16.999 --> 01:10:19.160
to make pots.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.799
Namadeva saw him there,

01:10:21.999 --> 01:10:24.520
looked at him, he was so stunned.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:28.600
He says, "I came here to see the nirakara,

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.120
to see the formless, and here it is in form."

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:36.200
What an appreciation, what a adoration,

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.999
and what an understanding of each other!

01:10:45.999 --> 01:10:48.720
But they were so few.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.160
They were all tortured and troubled, I must say, terrible things,

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.480
because people didn't understand them.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.960
And whatever they say is the truth.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.720
Every word that they said is the truth.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:16.160
So to Rachel and Michelle.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.799
I gather that You have

01:11:18.999 --> 01:11:21.680
many communities and followers around the world.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:23.799
- Yes.
- I wonder if You could tell us

01:11:23.999 --> 01:11:26.040
a bit about them, how many do You have?

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.999
When did it start, when did You

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.600
[came] at the head of the movement?

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.320
I'm very bad at accounts, that's one thing I don't know.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.960
I'm hopeless at it. Really I don't understand accounts,

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.760
I don't understand banking, I cannot sign a check,

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:45.799
I'm so hopelessly bad;

01:11:45.999 --> 01:11:49.480
and I just don't know how I don't know these things,

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.120
how to keep an account.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.320
Then perhaps recount how You became aware

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.640
that You had something very special to teach to others, and....

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.999
I was born like this,

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.840
just born.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.799
And You always have a following?

01:12:05.999 --> 01:12:08.920
I mean, My father was a realized soul

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.999
so he understood it,

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.920
and I met some saints also.

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:21.600
But nobody was so anxious to work it out,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.999
because they were frightened of the society.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.720
Most of them had disappeared to Himalayas

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:31.960
or some places, and they wouldn't come down.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.800
They said, "It's a big venture. You try Your luck!"

01:12:48.999 --> 01:12:51.840
This university is full of people who are

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.480
very much committed to bookish knowledge.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.280
I mean we learn so much, we read so much,

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.999
and I think maybe some people do it for degree or for position.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.799
But I think quite a lot are really devoted

01:13:04.999 --> 01:13:07.520
to just read more and more and understand it more

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.440
in an intellectual way.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.120
Now what role do You assign to this kind of pursuit,

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.600
intellectual pursuit?

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.680
Because if you ask people if they want to be realized,

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.080
maybe they say, "Ah, not really," but they pursue the books.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:26.920
So what do You see, what's the role of pursuing text and books?

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.920
You see, if you read books only,

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.800
then you get lost in the words, not in reality.

01:13:34.999 --> 01:13:37.120
And we had so many like that,

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.400
you see, great scholars, very first class first

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:44.720
and PhDs and MAds, all kinds of people

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.999
came down to Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.480
Very learned.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.560
But there was one thing common about them,

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.799
they had a kind of an intelligence to see

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:59.400
that there's something beyond.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.960
That's all. And it clicked in them, so many of them.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.400
So it's not difficult.

01:14:07.999 --> 01:14:11.760
You have not wasted your energy at all,

01:14:11.999 --> 01:14:14.960
but it's like whatever you have read

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.799
has to be re-read

01:14:17.999 --> 01:14:20.680
with a torch in your hand.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:25.000
There is one gentleman called as Yogi Mahajan.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.400
He's a lawyer, his father was a Chief Justice of India,

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.360
of the Supreme Court,

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.880
very learned person,

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:39.160
and he had written lots of books also.

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.880
He came to Sahaja Yoga,

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.640
so then he wrote another book

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.920
called as Gita Enlightened.

01:14:50.999 --> 01:14:54.999
Now there's another muslim gentleman

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:59.999
in Paris, Javed his name is. He's an aeronautical engineer.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:03.760
He's writing Koran Enlightened.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.920
There's somebody else who's writing Bible Enlightened.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.880
Their education is not wasted.

01:15:17.999 --> 01:15:19.999
Education is a technique,

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.320
but the creativity comes from your Spirit.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.280
It would be like the glass is the education,

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.800
but you have to have water in it,

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.840
then it's complete.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:35.799
Now, John.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:39.600
I've just had a question
going through my mind

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:42.440
when You were answering Rachel's last question,

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.680
which is this: since Your centers for ...

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.799
or what would You call Your centers anyway?

01:15:50.999 --> 01:15:52.720
What would you call Your centers?

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.799
- Myself?
- Like Your centers, the shakti...

01:15:55.999 --> 01:15:57.240
- [What centers are]?

01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.720
How would you describe, you know, the different centers?

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.680
It's a shakti, it's a power, it's an energy.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.480
No, I'm referring to the places where You go and...

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.800
Oh, I see, you're talking about the geographical centers.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.999
How would You refer to Your worshipping groups,

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.600
Your worshipping, the worshipping community

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.799
like in Sydney, is there a name that would be?

01:16:18.999 --> 01:16:20.999
Yes, they're all My children, I call them.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.920
Well, what if we ask You a question like this:

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.320
"Are among Your children, say, Christian priests?"

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.520
A few were ecumenical obviously.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.560
I mean, do they come there looking for Realization?

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.720
In other words apply what they have learned

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.799
or bring with them what they have learned,

01:16:35.999 --> 01:16:39.960
and try to lift it to another plane in Your community?

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.240
Are there any Christian priests among Your children,

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.040
which...  as far as I know there are...

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.600
Of course there are, there are - three of them.

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:55.640
And one was a very high priest in Italy.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.680
- Italy?
- Yes.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:04.999
In Italy there's a deviation now little bit coming up.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.040
Recently I read a book about when Christ was in India,

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.920
it is a nice book written by a German priest,

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.720
and I think he's a realized soul because

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.680
he knows so many things and he says so many things

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.160
which only a realized soul can say.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.360
Of course he is a scholar,

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.799
so he has authentically shown that Christ was there.

01:17:30.999 --> 01:17:33.040
But the way he has discussed Paul in Christianity

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.440
and all that is remarkable, remarkable.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.680
But with great power.

01:17:38.999 --> 01:17:43.120
Even Khalil Gibran has discussed Paul.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.999
They can see through things.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.280
He's not My disciple, but definitely he's a realized soul.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.120
He's a priest.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.760
We have one priest in London

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.999
who tried to bring

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.999
Bishop of Canterbury,

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.360
and I must say that he sent his

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.080
adviser to one of My lectures.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.200
I never knew he was sitting

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.240
but that day, I don't know why,

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.320
I started talking about something

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.880
that was not Christianity

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.840
in the Christians' behavior,

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.999
and he got very angry and he went away.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:41.080
I said that Christ has said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes."

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.400
What a subtle thing to say,

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:46.799
because in Sahaja Yoga Christ is placed on the optic chiasma,

01:18:46.999 --> 01:18:48.799
on the cross.

01:18:48.999 --> 01:18:51.799
He's the one who sucks in our karmas,

01:18:51.999 --> 01:18:54.280
that's why He talked of the eyes

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.680
- "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes" - very subtle.

01:18:58.999 --> 01:19:02.400
Not only the mind, but even the eyes.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.440
And what about the Christian nations, what we see today?

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:11.480
I mean it's horrid, I must say.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.960
Some things are very immoral, very immoral.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:20.160
Like in France now they are saying it should be allowed

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.280
for housewives to be prostitutes parties.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.440
Even the word "sexy" for women, I don't like it at all.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.999
They are not prostitutes, why should they be sexy?

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.440
It's a question of self-esteem.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.440
I mean if you call any Indian woman sexy she will just slap you,

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.520
[being angry]. She'll be so angry for such a thing.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.320
She is not a prostitute.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.320
So the whole society which is,

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.920
which is coming from Christ

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.120
is going towards where?

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.280
They are worshipping Freud, not Christ.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:58.440
Freud is their guru, not Christ.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.799
But when you come to Sahaja Yoga you'd be surprised,

01:20:06.999 --> 01:20:09.840
your eyes get steady, your attention gets steady;

01:20:10.999 --> 01:20:15.480
you really become a Christian in the real sense of the word,

01:20:17.999 --> 01:20:20.680
because you get the actualization of baptism,

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.880
it's not artificial.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:28.320
As William Blake has said that "Some priest cursed me on my head,

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.520
and I suffered."

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.800
It's not that.

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.999
It's the actualization which takes place.

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:39.999
All right? Thank you.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:50.520
- So this is, the time, is the time to...
- All right?

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:54.760
Thank you very much. I hope you will come to our program

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:58.799
which we are having - I don't know where, again the same problem!

01:20:58.999 --> 01:21:01.640
They just fix Me like plug, you know,

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.999
and I don't know where I have to go, what I have to do.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.360
They push Me in the car, they push Me in the aeroplanes!

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.440
- Do you want to have Realization?

01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:14.240
Well, the program is tomorrow night

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:19.120
at the Hilton Hotel ballroom, at 7.30.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.000
Rather too posh for Me.

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.799
Hilton Hotel!

01:21:25.999 --> 01:21:28.920
All right, must be some reason.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.360
And Saturday night there are two programs,

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.480
one following up at the same venue

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.080
at the same time on Saturday night.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.760
Please make it convenient to come,

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.999
because I'll come only after one year here,

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.800
and I hope all of you should get your Realization,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.799
it's very important.

01:21:49.999 --> 01:21:52.160
And then you will understand

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.999
between the lines,

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.760
the enlightened scriptures.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:09.160
Actually, I'd like to say a few words to those who are studying.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.480
I was doing my Masters in Philosophy

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.960
in Bombay University,

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:19.080
and I used to read like all of you, I suppose,

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.999
and after reading I came to a point where

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:26.600
you see that you're still far away from the reality,

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:27.999
from the truth.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.520
I mean, you take one theory

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.680
and you see and you feel that this is the best.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.840
You read another thing, you feel this is the best.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.400
But the two might be absolutely contradictory.

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.800
So what is the truth?

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:43.040
And by just reading the books

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.720
I think, I personally thought that

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.999
this is not what I really want from the academics.

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.200
And that is where I came to Sahaj,

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.799
and I have experienced

01:22:53.999 --> 01:22:56.720
a lot through blessings of Shri Mataji.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:01.080
And I welcome, I mean I wish that all the seekers would

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:03.080
should ask for their Realization,

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:06.040
if they really are seeking for the knowledge. Thank you.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.720
Now the theories that look contradictory

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.840
actually integrate after Sahaja Yoga,

01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.640
absolutely integrate. I'll give you an example.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.840
Now supposing if I have all the powers,

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:20.799
I'm the greatest capitalist.

01:23:20.999 --> 01:23:23.880
But I can't live without distributing it,

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.999
so I'm the greatest communist.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:30.040
If you don't have the capital, how can you distribute it?

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.999
But the capital of spirituality is important,

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.160
not these worldly things - these are transitory.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.799
All these theories that look contradictory

01:23:40.999 --> 01:23:42.799
actually are integrated.

01:23:42.999 --> 01:23:47.799
All religions which look contradictory, they all integrate.

01:23:47.999 --> 01:23:50.799
Actually we get integrated within ourselves,

01:23:50.999 --> 01:23:53.999
complete integration takes place.

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.080
So you don't have to deny any religion, you don't have to

01:23:59.999 --> 01:24:03.400
argue it out, but you have to see for yourself the truth,

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.999
that they are all one - no difference at all.

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.160
That was the time it had to be done,

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.040
this was the time it was to be done.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.520
Now this is the time of Kundalini awakening,

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.320
so I talk of Kundalini awakening.

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.040
This is not the time when I have to

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:20.120
take the Jews out of somewhere.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.799
That Moses had to do.

01:24:21.999 --> 01:24:23.760
So this is another work.

01:24:23.999 --> 01:24:25.400
Whatever is the time,

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:29.799
the maturity of the Tree of Life, one has to do that way,

01:24:29.999 --> 01:24:32.440
and that's how it works out.

01:24:32.999 --> 01:24:36.799
So thank you very much, very kind of you to have invited Me,

I'm really enamored that people of such intelligence

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:44.320
should pay some attention to Sahaja Yoga, which is very humble.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.560
Thank You so much for coming.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:55.560
Thank you very much.
