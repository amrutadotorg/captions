00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:24.260
we on earth understand God with our

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:30.440
earthly understanding we understand him

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:37.110
through our mind through our imagination

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:45.150
through our books and other things where

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:51.769
he's described as such answer there is a

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:54.870
big big mystic God and His divine power

00:00:51.769 --> 00:01:00.150
it's a big mystery mystery for all the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:09.659
human beings and you cannot concede with

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:14.570
your limited mind the working of God's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:22.220
divine power he is also very mysterious

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.220
whatever we call mysterious means that

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.900
it is beyond our mind we cannot conceive

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:40.800
it in our life this power of love is

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:44.970
variously what we think is love is not

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:52.760
the way he grabs us or his power of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.760
compassion his power of forgiveness is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.700
extremely mysterious for us because we

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.950
are so imperfect because of our

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.159
imperfection it cannot understand the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.489
person who is absolute who is perfect

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:14.700
when we seek Him we see through our

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:17.519
imperfections and that's how we form our

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.819
ideas according to our own imperfections

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.819
about

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:36.190
say for a small little ant if you have

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:41.099
to convey the political issue that is

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.099
facing Britain today is it possible

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.830
because for the poor little act it is

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.340
not even conceivable that we have a mind

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.860
which thinks which has the imagination

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.760
which projects like an octopus was all

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.190
wrong that just these catches that it

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.920
cannot even understand that we have a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.730
kind of a freedom by which we can do

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.670
what we like

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:16.780
the conception cannot be contained in

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:24.340
that little mind of little head of that

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:27.639
tiny creature but the difference between

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:34.690
an ant and a human being is that ant has

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:38.530
no ego now the probability human beings

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.109
is that despite the same core

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.880
relationship or we can say despite the

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:52.690
same parallel as a human being and God

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:57.880
an ant and man top the whole thing is

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:03.819
the ego part which in a way makes us

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:11.049
even lower than an act because our

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:12.970
reception is so cool that we cannot see

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:18.130
that there must be something mysterious

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:24.729
about what God has to be a mystery for

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:27.250
human beings I have to understand the

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:32.590
mystery we have to enter into a new

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:35.010
realm more than what we can really

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.160
understand with his human awareness

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.990
there has to be another plane from which

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.490
we should try to see this mystery

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:51.040
because we cannot understand anything

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:53.470
about how he does it I didn't see now in

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.210
chemistry if you see the periodical laws

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:02.950
that exist it's fantastic absolutely fun

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:05.950
that look at a little amoeba how it

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:10.720
abscent look at small animals who live

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:15.850
in the rivers and who live in the seas

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:20.350
the number of creatures that are living

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:22.960
harmoniously not like human beings but

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:34.450
quite harmoniously accepting each

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:39.670
other's demand even on the life so with

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:46.480
his freedom and such a big mystery and a

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:50.920
big ego in between is difficult for us

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:56.320
to conceive his greatness his compassion

00:05:50.920 --> 00:06:01.240
his life that whatever he does is for

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.220
the betterment for of our spirit even if

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.920
he killed someone it is for the

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:11.130
betterment of the Spirit even if he

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.440
thrashes someone and throws him down

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:18.490
many hills it is for the betterment of

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.650
this way Mary puts you to problems and

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:25.900
troubles it is for the betterment of

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:29.350
your spirit anything that happens to you

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:34.960
is a testing ground for the betterment

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:40.780
of your spirit he is working day in and

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:43.130
day out just to improve your awareness

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.910
in your spirit

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:50.820
to feel your spirit everything the

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:54.169
nature the beauty everything is worth

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:58.320
little so that you the human beings

00:06:54.169 --> 00:07:03.919
should feel his Beauty should know him

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.919
in your own awareness should feel the

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:14.130
vibrant love of God for ages it has been

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:18.240
worked out imagine since this world was

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:20.280
created till today with various

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.750
incarnations who came on this earth to

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:28.050
the present live to talk about him to

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:38.190
work about him to improve our different

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:41.009
centers within us and then suddenly when

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:46.889
we were faced face to face we can't

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:49.530
believe that it can happen within the

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:53.250
mixture of fighting ego and super-ego

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:57.030
but first of all we cannot believe

00:07:53.250 --> 00:08:05.159
ourselves that we are capable of getting

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:09.590
realization and secondly I think that we

00:08:05.159 --> 00:08:15.449
are afraid to get realized

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:21.840
thirdly we do not trust anyone who talks

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:27.000
of realization the third world is a good

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:30.389
idea not trusting but at least trust

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.070
yourself you start from that point we

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:33.539
first yourself that you should get your

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:38.010
realization otherwise why do you call

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:41.969
you are a seeker you have to get your

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:46.610
realization or doubt about it but when

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:46.610
it comes to trust whom do we trust

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.650
say for example when Christ said that

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:58.160
God is my father he has sent me

00:08:54.650 --> 00:09:00.200
specially to do this work we couldn't

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.060
believe it this man is son of a

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:11.080
carpenter problem like this better

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:11.080
crucifying and our compassion went to a

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:21.680
confirmed thief than to the adoration of

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:24.070
the Son of God now when he died of

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.830
course his son of God the Holy Ghost

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:29.960
everything stops I mean any normal then

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.760
people start believing I don't know why

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:37.790
they even today believe that you know

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:40.550
son of God why do they believe even the

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:43.130
Holy Ghost I mean even the Bible why

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.290
should we believe what is the authority

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.720
of Bible

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:49.400
how many slam can ask that question then

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.780
ask a question what is the authority of

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.520
Bible why do you believe in facts

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.990
I mean if you take out the Bible they

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.450
say what is the authority they may say

00:09:53.990 --> 00:10:04.190
Christ is the authority but tries them a

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:09.890
road Babel so what if the authority is

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:10.640
your own ego you want to believe in want

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.840
to believe in it

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:18.050
that's all you want to believe that

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:20.540
helps to sort of many questions because

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:26.450
anything happens you say alright it's

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:29.000
God's wish because we can use him better

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:31.160
when he was crucified before that he

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:37.670
cannot use it because he was independent

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:40.100
he was living there when he died is very

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:44.149
handy so we accept him

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:47.480
we do not question was that a mistake

00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:49.779
for him to say that he was the son of

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.779
God

00:10:50.589 --> 00:10:57.410
knitting it was a mistake that Christ

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:59.360
said that he was the son of God because

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:02.569
of that he was crucified do you think it

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:13.220
was a mistake that he said the truth

00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:16.100
about himself would you say that how how

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.600
can you justify he saying see if he was

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.490
crucified for that then he was

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.209
indiscriminate one would say that to say

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.130
such a thing

00:11:20.209 --> 00:11:23.990
there was no discrimination it was not

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.930
wise to say after all you would have

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:29.389
lived longer you know spend better time

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:32.660
with his mother you could have built a

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:34.790
house or something like that you know a

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:41.089
mosque some money or some sort of a very

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:46.639
important thing you would have done but

00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:50.569
there's the mystery that's the mystery

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:52.670
we do not know because we want to see it

00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:54.980
from our angle and as a point he just

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:57.079
give it and he don't justify then we do

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.880
not rationalize it at a point we just

00:11:57.079 --> 00:12:03.769
give up oh it's all right

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:05.300
he's got we need your point there you

00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:07.550
say all right he was on a lot with you

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:10.630
whatever you wanted you did not already

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:17.750
for proper how are we to judge but now

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:19.370
not when you get I must say God eternity

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:28.069
but human beings are great atmosphere

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:30.430
and God to me at least I mean they know

00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:35.769
how far to go and how to switch off

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.769
suddenly to something oh that's divine

00:12:37.569 --> 00:12:41.750
after your point they go on

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:45.459
rationalizing intellectualizing

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.459
and then this opacity:1 finished

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:54.690
none of you have seen him walking on the

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:58.650
water did you not he being resurrected

00:12:54.690 --> 00:13:01.890
none of you so why should we believe

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:12.300
that he did that with the question we

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:13.560
should ask ourselves what he did that he

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:19.680
was the son of God

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:22.680
but how are we to believe into it you

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:28.020
have to become something more to know

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:32.570
the mystery of his life why he purified

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:35.490
himself why he accepted that life and

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:37.170
why with all his powers that he is going

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.870
to come to destroy the whole world now

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:46.170
why did he not destroy these people who

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:50.550
were trying to purify what was the road

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:53.850
he had to play in his lifetime he cannot

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:56.430
understand with this human awareness you

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:59.100
have to become something more and that's

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:04.020
why he again and again said you are to

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:05.700
be born again how many of us think that

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.070
we are to be born again are we born

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:11.070
again we certify many people said if I

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:15.000
am Barney I am a Christian meaning born

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:16.460
again Musel mom is missing and brahman

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.420
means the same those who are born again

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:23.210
now how are you born again he is again I

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.360
make belief that I'm born again

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:29.340
self-certification walking around with a

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:34.380
certificated human-beings giving the

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:42.810
certificate to human beings so what is

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:47.550
the truth but if you are ardently

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:53.060
seeking the truth then the mysteries can

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:56.180
be open to you but you have to seek the

00:14:53.060 --> 00:15:00.250
truth an truth alone

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:02.830
nothing else if you want to live with

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:11.390
your ego go ahead

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:14.060
nobody can gee when you start seeing

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:18.620
your evil you have to know that this is

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:21.649
not yourself something beyond because

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:24.890
true ego whatever you have known is all

00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:27.680
a chaos all that knowledge that you got

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:32.570
to go is creating all the problems of

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:35.290
the world all the fears you have

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:42.860
gathered through your super-ego is

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:47.750
another disaster for human beings there

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:53.660
must be something that God must have put

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:57.820
within us some light by which we can see

00:15:53.660 --> 00:16:02.470
something beyond our ego and super

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.470
enlightened until that happens to you

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:13.040
you cannot understand the mystery of God

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:16.700
and His love you cannot understand human

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:21.820
love has no depth to feel the depth of

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:24.400
God's love and his heart he saw servant

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:33.740
he so ego-oriented

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:43.250
his heart has could melt open it has to

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:49.310
melt completely and flow this frozen

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:53.140
heart is like an iceberg has to be

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.140
dissolved in the ocean of his life

00:16:53.290 --> 00:17:00.200
otherwise you can never get to the

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:04.370
depths of the people write to me mother

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:06.679
I am not in love with Samantha so how

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:08.650
can I be happy with that person that

00:17:06.679 --> 00:17:13.600
person will be miserable now

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:15.309
living with that person for years you

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.170
are having children from that person you

00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:18.730
don't love you don't love anyone you

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:27.880
cannot love you don't know what love is

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:29.710
they fall into love's pollen and some

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.540
sort of a thing for them is now I don't

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.330
know what is love for human beings to be

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:36.130
very frank I don't understand

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:43.000
here they are fall in love and next day

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:46.660
they are out to the courts and according

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.610
to the falling in love is something you

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:55.210
see out of the blue oh I have fallen in

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:59.100
love yeah I have yet to come across a

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.100
person who has really fallen in love

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:08.290
because as soon as something comes up

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:15.610
that companionship and that love that

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:21.910
enjoyment of oneness vanish heart has to

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:25.690
melt hearts must meet where they have no

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.500
stones in between otherwise these Tony

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:31.000
hardsuits

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:34.270
attract each other even I think two

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.160
stones try to meet each other loving

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:40.059
each other and how can they love I can't

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.760
understand it's a big mystery that human

00:18:40.059 --> 00:18:46.780
beings know how to live with

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:51.730
artificiality and it falls believes they

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:57.780
compromise but spirit does not

00:18:51.730 --> 00:19:01.540
compromise them it does it forgives

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:06.990
because it does it just forgives goes on

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:10.980
forgiving forgiving because it loves and

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:15.570
then it punishes also because it was a

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:15.570
nice tries also because

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:24.810
that's the spirit has to shine through

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:26.730
yourself realization talking being about

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.590
self-realization and pay hundred rupees

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:31.880
get your sunglasses on all these

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:37.320
nonsense is at such a low event such a

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:42.090
quality that the beauty of his mystery

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:51.630
is just after me you are in the chamber

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:56.330
of asset and believing here in the

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:56.330
kingdom of God there is forgiveness

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:09.950
there is love there is compassion there

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:13.770
is understanding there is complete

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:20.870
all-pervading assurance and the support

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:33.150
and the hand that wants to raise an

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:40.020
anxious father who wants to soothe to

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:47.820
give you joy to give you eternal joy can

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:54.800
you think of someone like that he has

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:54.800
problems many problems he has problems

00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:01.890
but the greatest problem is that he

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:06.630
cannot have a rapport with his own

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:09.060
children that he cannot give what he

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:16.050
wants to give to his children who have a

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:20.390
heart which has no emptiness which

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:20.390
cannot be filled like a cup with Islam

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.850
Kundalini does that suction in our heart

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:37.279
but first she enters

00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:42.450
into the brain into the limbic area and

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:45.840
then it proceeds stores heart so this

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:49.559
mystery is solved once we start

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:55.139
engulfing our brain our carts our

00:21:49.559 --> 00:22:01.230
thinking completely drenched in the

00:21:55.139 --> 00:22:06.269
showers of His grace otherwise is

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:09.899
pipeline mind can never receive those

00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:14.279
beautiful views of love which form these

00:22:09.899 --> 00:22:19.019
two drops you have to be a flower to

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:26.869
receive many soft tender receptive

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:35.659
person and then only the fruit appears

00:22:26.869 --> 00:22:35.659
when you mature a heart heart of a saint

00:22:35.929 --> 00:22:46.320
which is larger than all the oceans of

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:55.859
the world such wisdom of enjoying one's

00:22:46.320 --> 00:23:00.169
own love just that love that flows this

00:22:55.859 --> 00:23:04.859
mystery I wish all of you could

00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:09.570
achieving is like give up your ideas of

00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:16.049
judging something on close levels you

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:21.900
have to become subtler try to enjoy

00:23:16.049 --> 00:23:34.270
things do not be joyous

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:44.130
and you will get the benefit of this in

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:44.130
such in measurable quantities try to see

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:49.720
receive more of the grease drenched

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:55.480
yourself

00:23:49.720 --> 00:24:01.600
it's so soothing it is the energy that

00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:06.280
suit can you think of inner energy that

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:09.940
suits your mind completely that gives

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:16.270
you wisdom that coordinates the whole

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:19.630
atmosphere to make you happy this divine

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:21.420
energy is all pervading and to

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:24.700
understand the mystery of that

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:27.150
all-pervading power you have to become

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:32.670
self-realized you have to be born again

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:35.590
this is not the way out and to mature

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:39.390
after this rebirth if you need to make

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:46.030
fun of someone very but what did you get

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:48.460
all these days making fun now you are

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:54.060
