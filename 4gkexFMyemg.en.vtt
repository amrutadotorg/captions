00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.640
Okay. Hi, everybody. Jay Shimano-Jean. Pleasure to be here. Thanks for inviting me. And you

2
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:21.880
probably should ask me a question because I don't know exactly what particular specific

3
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.880
thing you guys wanted to talk about. I think it had something to do with Kanan Johari,

4
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.880
but if you want to ask me a question, probably be the best.

5
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.280
I don't have any specific question to ask you, Steve. I thought you had a particular

6
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.160
story that you wanted to share. Joe, do you have maybe a question for Steve?

7
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.880
Can you tell us your experience when you went up to Kanan Johari for the first time with

8
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.480
Michael? Yeah, that would be great. That's what I thought. I thought it was about Kanan

9
00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:04.920
Johari. That's good. Well, I was in New York. I lived in New York in the 90s, in 1994, 95.

10
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.400
Shimano-Jean had moved us there. She bought a house in Yonkers, and about six families

11
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.600
lived in the house, six yogi families. So I had a relationship with New York. I was

12
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.360
living there for during that time, and then I was coming back and forth and staying for

13
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.760
extended periods of time in later years. I don't remember the exact date. If anybody

14
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.520
remembers when Shimano-Jean purchased Kanan Johari, that'd be great. But I do remember

15
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.920
beingâ€”I was the errand boy in the suite on 57th Street, Shimano-Jean's. I think they

16
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.840
rented an apartment for Shimano-Jean for three, four months, quite a long time, above 57th

17
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.320
Street, a really nice place. The errand boy consisted of going out and running around

18
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.800
New York City, getting stuff, getting things, prescriptions or anything that was needed

19
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.880
from Duane's. Usually, that's a place in New York is like a pharmacy that has everything.

20
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.720
Another place now we have is called CBS, but the idea is that it's one of those

21
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.520
you can buy everything stores, and there are a lot of them in New York City.

22
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.360
When I remember a few things, one was they were looking in the newspaper for land, and

23
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.720
they were looking at classifieds or the realty classifieds,

24
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.360
and then there was a moment where they went through some things and turned the page

25
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.680
or went on to the next column, but they had passed by what was then to become Kanan Johari.

26
00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.800
And Shimano-Jean said, no, wait, wait, go back. And they didn't know where to go. And she said,

27
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.760
no, back that way and then down this way. It's directing the person who had the paper.

28
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.200
And then they said here and they said, yes, she said, look there. And then of course,

29
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.280
they read out what was to become the land deal for Kanan Johari. It was,

30
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:24.400
I forget how many acres for what price, but it was a very good price. And everybody was very excited

31
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.640
at that point because kind of a needle in the haystack, Shimano-Jean had pinpointed the place to

32
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:39.680
go to find out about it and to buy ultimately. So soon after, and again, I don't remember the

33
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.160
exact days and dates and how much time transpired between all these things. I do remember being in

34
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.520
the same apartment and this would have been after our trip up to Kanan Johari, but I do remember

35
00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.680
Shimano-Jean signing. This was only a few of us there, Gagan, Count and myself, and I don't know,

36
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.200
maybe one other person. I remember the document, the deed or whatever it is that Shimano-Jean

37
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.560
signed to purchase Kanan Johari. And I just was in such close proximity that I had this

38
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.840
feeling that I was watching history unfold and as if you were in a room when the Declaration

39
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.200
of Independence was being signed or some great document was being signed. I had this

40
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.080
feeling that I was in the presence of a historical moment and I was extra attentive of every

41
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.400
move of Shimano-Jean's hand because as she signed it, it was a moment of great importance. And I was

42
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.640
very grateful to be there. And then as far as the the reconnaissance trip up to Kanan Johari,

43
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.920
I stayed, we were all scheduled to leave the next day to go up to Kanan Johari. And

44
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.600
there were to be two cars, one with myself and Michael, Michael Fisselli, who now lives up in

45
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:14.320
Albany, near Albany. And the other car was Shimano-Jean's car and I believe maybe Harsh was

46
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:24.320
remember exactly who was in the car. But so I remember sleeping over at Michael's. I think he

47
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:33.760
lived up in the Bronx. And so I remember kind of a night full of anticipation and looking forward

48
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:41.440
to the next day and having some brotherly moments inside, which was fun. And then there we went. We

49
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.920
had a kind of a convoy with mother's car, Shimano-Jean's car and Michael's, I don't know,

50
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.880
Chevy or whatever it was, small car. And at one point we stopped, before we got to the land,

51
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.040
we stopped at McDonald's. You know, honestly, it could have been before, it could have been after,

52
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.640
but I do remember going to McDonald's and having, you know, a burger and Pepsi or whatever, Coke,

53
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.840
and Shimano-Jean joking around about the, you know, Coca-Cola and that kind of thing.

54
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.480
And then when we went to the actual land, it happened to be that Michael and I were just a

55
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:28.880
little bit ahead of Shimano-Jean's car. So we just spontaneously got out of the car and it was just

56
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.800
this little, you know, round patch where you could park your car. The rest was just, I don't know,

57
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.000
knee high or maybe hip high grass, you know, green grass, you know, if you've been to Kanchoharie,

58
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.360
you know, there's this sense to all green, very green and a very soothing grass that grows.

59
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.280
And of course it probably hadn't been cut in any way for a long time.

60
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:59.360
So we just spontaneously just started running into this grass and just kind of like, if you

61
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:07.040
can imagine, you know, a couple cubs or bear cubs or something like that, just we started

62
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.120
tackling each other and rolling around in the grass and we were just screaming for joy,

63
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:20.320
youthful, and I think we were both maybe in our late 20s. And just a spontaneous, you know,

64
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:28.960
expression of joyous innocence and fun and brotherly love as we kind of just rolled around

65
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:37.200
in the grass. And I believe, you know, I mean, I guess technically we're probably the first two

66
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.120
yogis to go on the land, but not that that means too much other than the fact that there was this

67
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:51.280
beautiful moment of joy that I think we were able to have. And that would be, you know, a forerunner

68
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.600
of so much joy later at this happening now. So we, you know, got back to the

69
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:05.120
whole patch of land and Shrimadaji's car got, you know, arrived. And then

70
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:12.080
Shrimadaji got out of the car, but she didn't stay too long. Really she looked around

71
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.160
and said something like, it's beautiful, isn't it? Or, you know,

72
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.480
she looked at us and, you know, acknowledged obviously that we were in a good state of

73
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:34.400
happiness and joy. And really we left after that. It wasn't a long visit. Shrimadaji didn't sit down

74
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.760
or we didn't have a picnic. We didn't walk around too much. I think the whole idea was just

75
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.160
for Shrimadaji to see the land and vibrate it. She obviously knew what the significance was. She

76
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.960
knew all about the land. And it probably would have been right after that that she

77
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.080
went ahead and signed the document in that moment that I mentioned,

78
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.280
that I call the moment of witnessing history in the making. So those, you know, that's really the

79
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:11.200
story. It was that initial finding of Kanjohari in the newspaper, which was one of those kind of

80
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.240
miracle moments where people are spinning the pages and missing it. And then Shrimadaji

81
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.840
directed them back. She knew where it was. Then there was the trip up to Kanjohari and that

82
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:31.280
incredible feeling of exuberance that we felt immediately went on the land. And then of course

83
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:42.000
the signing of the document itself that was, like I said, probably the slowest. It's as if

84
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.840
there was slow motion. You know how the slow motion is. It's just maybe it was the way that

85
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.080
Shrimadaji signs her name, but it went as if, maybe it was my attention, but it went as if it

86
00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:01.120
were in elongated time, stretched out. And as I can say, I can remember it as if, you know,

87
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:09.440
it's like I'm seeing it right now in my mind. So that's the story. And I'm interested to hear what

88
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.800
Michael might say, what his experience was. He might be able to fill in a few gaps in terms of

89
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.200
the date and that because, you know, he drove and he may have a few more details. So

90
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.240
good to talk with him about it as well.

91
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.000
Thanks. Thanks so much, Steve. I'm just going to pause the recording a minute.

92
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.960
Excellent. So thanks, Mark, if you can share your memories. That was brilliant.

93
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:49.360
Greetings, everyone. My name is Mark Mays, Sahaja Yogi originally from Seattle.

94
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:58.160
And Steve had just recounted his memories from when the land was first purchased.

95
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.520
And I'm not sure what the gap was between when the land was first purchased and we actually

96
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:13.520
developed the land. But I was asked to come out and help put in the electrical on the

97
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.640
Pendle that was going to be constructed. And so there was going to be a puja weekend.

98
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.760
Shrimaji was going to arrive on Friday night for the entertainment program.

99
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:31.520
And I showed up on the Saturday before, seven days before, and there was 14 holes in the ground

100
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:37.920
and nothing else. And so I looked at this and I was like, you got to be kidding me. We're going

101
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:45.680
to build a Pendle, install the electrical, drill wells, build a kitchen, all this in seven days.

102
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:55.680
And I was just like, wow. And so then there was actually 14 holes, seven on each side. And they

103
00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.200
were full of rebar that had to be redone. And they said, yeah, we're going to pour the cement today,

104
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:10.080
but it'll have to come tomorrow. And these big footings were for the big metal cross beams

105
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.400
that were going to be there. Seven of these cross beams, they connected with boards, and then the

106
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:22.000
skin of the Pendle would go on top of that. And so I'm thinking, this is Saturday. How are you

107
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.080
going to get a cement truck out here on a Sunday in the middle of nowhere? I says, I find that hard

108
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.800
to believe that's going to happen. So I wake up the next morning, and sure enough, there's cement

109
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:40.400
trucks out there on a Sunday in the middle of nowhere, filling up those holes for the footings.

110
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:49.120
And that was the first of many, oh, this can't happen things, where I was wrong and wrong and

111
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:56.640
wrong again over the next week. The Divine obviously had other things in mind than my

112
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:05.280
pessimistic thoughts about what could happen. And so the main Pendle was being constructed

113
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.120
over the next few days. I was out gathering electrical supplies and electrical panels,

114
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:21.200
circuit breakers, you know, conduits and wires and lights and light switches and outlets,

115
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:27.520
all the stuff that one would need to electrify the Pendle. And so I'm kind of wondering,

116
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:33.920
who's going to help me do this? And I met this one guy named Hanuman from Argentina, like, on about

117
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.800
Tuesday or so. And he says, Oh, yeah, Uncle, I can find some people to help, don't worry.

118
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:48.240
And so then Wednesday rolled around, and we were trying to get some lighting around the camp,

119
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:54.160
so people would be stumbling in the dark. And there was this guy, forget his name, from Austria,

120
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.800
who was an electrician. And he kept reminding me a number of times that he wired Cabela.

121
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.400
But their electrical system is quite a bit different than ours. And he was wanting to

122
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.360
do things to the European standard, using really expensive materials, which we didn't have budget

123
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:19.200
for. So very challenging interactions. And so then, Thursday morning, rolled up,

124
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.680
Shamai just coming the next day, I jumped out of my tent. And so, oh, man, I better get busy.

125
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:35.120
I'll meditate later. Well, I never did meditate that day, I was quote, too busy. So I kind of had

126
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:43.760
a major falling out with this guy from Austria, we kind of lost it with him. And I went out to the

127
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:51.680
van that had all the electrical supplies in it. And somebody had taken the van on a run to New York

128
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:57.840
to pick up some of these at the airport. So all the electrical supplies that I needed, were there

129
00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:05.280
most of them. I couldn't believe it. It says, how could they have done this? So then, I took

130
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.880
one of the vans and finished getting buying up the rest of the electrical supplies I needed.

131
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.520
And nothing was going right that day. I mean, I didn't meditate. You know,

132
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:22.080
got in kind of an argument with this guy from Austria. You know, the van took off. I had to

133
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.360
drive all the way to Albany to get the supplies. Everything was taking too long. I get back,

134
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:36.160
you know, just before dusk, maybe an hour before dusk and slam the door to the van and realize I

135
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:42.960
just locked the keys in the van. So I'm like, fitting into a miserable day. So then these

136
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.080
Uvas come over and they go, Uncle, uncle, and they're very bright, cheery voices. Can we help?

137
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.840
Can we help? And I said, look, I just locked the keys in the van. What are you going to do?

138
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.920
Oh, well, maybe we can find a coat hanger. I said, yeah, whatever. And so I kind of blew them off.

139
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.960
And I got my cell phone. I'm trying to find reception out there. I'm going to try and find

140
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.000
a locksmith, right? You know, I'm still going through my brain doing all these mental activity

141
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.440
solutions, mental solutions to all my problems. So I'm about a minute and a half into the phone

142
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:22.320
call trying to find a locksmith and I hear this, Jai Srimadaji, Jai Srimadaji, Jai Srimadaji.

143
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:28.000
And they go, Uncle, look, the door is unlocked. And I go, what? And

144
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:37.680
like sure enough, the door was unlocked. I felt totally humbled. I hadn't used Sahaja Yoga once

145
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:44.960
the whole day. I tried solving every problem with my ego and my brain. And the Uvas, you know,

146
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.960
showed me quite clearly how Sahaja Yoga works, especially in these moments of importance,

147
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.920
you know, getting ready for a puja. So totally humbled. I grabbed the keys, thanked them,

148
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:04.240
went off and I went to bed that night. And the next morning, so it's Friday, we haven't done

149
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:12.400
any of the electrical work yet, except I think we wired in a transformer. And so somebody comes up,

150
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.800
said, Mark, Mark, hurry up, hurry up, you have to get up. We have to do the electrical today.

151
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:26.400
Srimadaji is coming tonight. And I said, Nope, I'm going to go meditate first. I made a mistake

152
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:34.480
the day before. So I went in to the Pendal, they had a stage at that point, and Srimadaji's photo,

153
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:41.280
and they a little altered. So I sat there quietly, closed my eyes, raised my kundalini.

154
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:48.400
And said, Srimadaji, you are the doer. There's no way I can do what needs to be done today.

155
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.720
I can't do this without your help. And so I sat there meditating. I kind of heard somebody

156
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.200
walking around me like very close and that I didn't really know what was going on.

157
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.280
But I opened my eyes for my meditation, looked up, some sweet yogini had brought me a plate of

158
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:12.800
my breakfast. And so I didn't even have to go get breakfast is right there. So I was eating

159
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:18.240
my breakfast and Hanuman, which I hadn't seen for days comes up, hey, uncle, I found a crew of people

160
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:25.600
to help us today. So I had four helpers right there, finished my breakfast, and we got started.

161
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:36.080
And it was amazing how smoothly and quickly and effortlessly things went that day when I meditated,

162
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.040
surrendered to Srimadaji. And I remember there was one moment where I was on this really tall

163
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:50.320
ladder, we were passing some of the conduits over the top of the pendal. And I looked down and

164
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:56.800
people were like working on the stage, there was like, I don't know, 100 people or more just

165
00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.880
scurrying about decorating the pendal, setting up for the stage. They were still building the ramp

166
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:08.880
for the stage for Srimadaji's wheelchair and just all this activity going on. And it was almost like

167
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:16.240
I was looking at this time warp that things were happening at a speed that wasn't really possible,

168
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:24.160
including the work that we were doing. And so we just kept plugging away all day long.

169
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:30.720
And we made some very simple light fixtures just using some conduits to some poles with light

170
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:38.800
fixtures at the end. And they were on all 14 of those big metal cross beams that went across,

171
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.920
we put one on each one, so there were seven on each side. And we kind of got lucky because we

172
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:52.720
didn't have tons of light. But the inside of the metal skins of the frame were painted white,

173
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:59.760
so they were really reflective. So by pure luck, we got by with the amount of light that we had.

174
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.160
So and by this time, here it is, it's starting to get dark out, the pendal's starting to fill up

175
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:12.080
with yogis. And we still haven't, we just finished putting all the lights on, wired in the

176
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:19.040
entertainment center, got all the receptacles wired in, all the switches in. And we went to

177
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:25.360
flip on the switches on the stage, on the right hand side of the stage, and they all come on,

178
00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.160
all the yogis start clapping, oh, we're gonna have light. And then we went to turn on the other side

179
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.440
and the circuit breaker tripped. And I was like, oh my goodness, we got a short circuit somewhere.

180
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.920
So then I went up to Goggin, I said, hey Goggin, I suppose we could get by with just like one row

181
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.800
of lights. And he was like, well, you know, Mark, Shimadeji's coming and we really need to do our

182
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:54.560
best. And he wasn't going to let me go off easy. So we went through and we disconnected, you know,

183
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.240
and decided to disconnect one light at a time to figure out where the short circuit was.

184
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:05.520
And it wound up being the second light from the front, which happened to be shining on

185
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:13.920
the overhead screen, where there was going to be a projection onto the screen. And if that light

186
00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:20.800
had been on, it would have washed out the screen. So that light wasn't supposed to be on. So the

187
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:27.360
divine worked out every single little detail. And so we had lights, the light that would have washed

188
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:36.480
out the screen was off. And I was like, J. Shimadeji, I couldn't believe it. So I walked out,

189
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.280
I was going to go to my tent and shower up and get ready for the evening program. And when I'm

190
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:47.280
walking from the Pendle to my tent, I hear the conscious blowing announcing Shimadeji's arrival.

191
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:55.040
She came like, literally minutes after we finished and had everything done.

192
00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.680
She knew exactly when to come. She was staying like, I don't know, an hour or more away from

193
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:09.440
from Kanawha land. And she knew exactly when to leave to be there exactly when she was supposed

194
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:19.360
to be. And I just shook my head. J. Shimadeji. And, you know, it was really a miracle

195
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:27.120
that happened. And it was funny, I was telling this story in the LA ashram some years later.

196
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:33.840
And one of those Yubas who was then now a lawyer in UK somewhere, she says,

197
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:39.120
Yeah, so Uncle Mark, do you know what really happened? I go, No, how did you guys

198
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:45.440
unlock that door? She said, We just sat there and we just raised our hands like this

199
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.760
to the door lock and said J. Shimadeji three times. And they said they could see the door

200
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:58.800
lock just sort of shaking vibrating and finally just came up. So it was literally a miracle,

201
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:06.480
but it just totally recalibrated my whole attitude. You know, when I didn't use Sahaja Yoga,

202
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:12.000
it was a disaster. When I did use Sahaja Yoga, surrender to Shimadeji, everything worked out

203
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.680
beautifully and in the most impossible way. All my week long doubts about being able to

204
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:26.720
build a pendal and get water and build a kitchen and all the stuff that we needed to do just

205
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:34.320
was shown what the divine can do how powerful divine is, if we just surrender to it. And it

206
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:42.640
truly was a miracle. Getting that that pendulum the grounds done in a week, I'm not even sure

207
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.200
a crack team of professionals could have done it. But so anyway, that's my story.

208
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.040
That's just amazing. I'm just gonna pause the recording.

209
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.680
Okay.

210
00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:09.040
Hola. Come with Stan. Hi, how are you? I am Patricia Mays. I live in Florida now we was living in

211
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:19.040
Washington State until last year. So I'm and my mother is Doris Mendez from Colombia.

212
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.200
We are going to tell the stories of Kaniyia Hari also we saw Kaniyia Hari since the beginning.

213
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:33.840
And in 2000, my mother is going to tell first her story and I'm going to translate.

214
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.240
Okay, she's Doris Mendez de Acosta. She's from Colombia.

215
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:56.480
She's going to tell the story of the experience that she has in 2000 in Kaniyia Hari with Shimadeji.

216
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:18.080
She meet with my mother and I co-ive in Kaniyia Hari happened.

217
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:30.080
In 2000, they rent a house in the little town in Canaliojari for Shimateli because in the land we didn't have a house in that time.

218
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:36.080
So they rent two homes, one for Shimateli and the next one for the yogis, they care her.

219
00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.600
We received a letter from the

220
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:47.080
public in the house in Canaliojari and we were able to find it with all the people from Colombia

221
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:53.080
and the last few Colombian and South American people.

222
00:25:53.080 --> 00:26:01.080
We turned around and we received a letter from Colombia and we received a letter from

223
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:15.080
the people from the house in Canaliojari, in the night.

224
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:22.080
And the Colombians arranged, all the South Americans arranged the house of Shimateli there.

225
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:34.080
And we were waiting for her at the little house, more like 12 or 14 yogis, most of them Colombians and some South Americans.

226
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:50.080
And we received her with garlands and flowers and she decided to invite us to the house and sit down next to her at her feet and come with us.

227
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:14.080
She asked the coordinator of Colombia to help us with the problems of the violence that is happening in Colombia.

228
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:23.080
And she asked the photographers to help us with the difficult things that are happening in the country.

229
00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:30.080
So the Shimateli asked for Colombia, what happened in Colombia, how is it in Colombia?

230
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:46.080
And she asked how the country is doing. So Marilu that was the leader in that time, she showed Shimateli some kind of pictures of the situation, political situation in Colombia, that was very hard in that time.

231
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.080
It was a lot of violence.

232
00:27:49.080 --> 00:28:04.080
When Marilu showed us the photographs, I started to feel very, very space and very happy.

233
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:09.080
Marilu was very happy with all the Colombians and Colombians.

234
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:16.080
The repetition, the repetition of the words, Marilu said, I'm sorry, Marilu.

235
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:27.080
So when Marilu was the leader of Colombia in that time, she showed Shimateli these pictures and told her the situation.

236
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:42.080
My mother was there with all of us, was there, the Colombians, and she asked inside her, please Shimateli, forgive all the Colombians, forgive all the violence in Colombia, forgive all the problems in Colombia.

237
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:57.080
So they really, she started feeling herself like a fire in her body, and like a very strong, strong fire in her body.

238
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:23.080
She started feeling a very strong kind of moment of fire inside her, like something was burning.

239
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:27.080
And she still said, forgive Shimateli, forgive all the Colombians.

240
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:35.080
And she started feeling very hot and very kind of almost feeling like she's going to vent there and burn herself there.

241
00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.080
And she got a little bit afraid.

242
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.080
Yes.

243
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:55.080
At that moment, I thought that, I thought that Marilu could maybe be a Colombian or her father, or my father, to go to the country.

244
00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:04.080
But she said, Marilu, if you have to move, I'm your father.

245
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.080
So she said, forgive me.

246
00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:25.080
So in that moment, she feels like she's going to die. So she said, Oh, mother, please forgive us. If I have to die this moment, please forgive me and I am surrender completely to you, surrender everything to you.

247
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:57.080
And that moment when she asked, when she said I surrender completely to your divine powers, she started feeling like completely cool, more relaxed, and the soul started more cooling down and started feeling the cool breeze and completely the chains of the vibrations was in that moment.

248
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:12.080
In the place of the house, the place of the house.

249
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:18.080
And we all thought we were going to have a good time in the world of marriage.

250
00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.080
Next day, next day. Yeah.

251
00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:32.080
Next day, she, she might be asked to the yogi that was there in the house to put some water at her lotus feet.

252
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:46.080
She was in the garden outside the house. And she asked, please, the yogis are there, please put water at my feet. So my mother was there.

253
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:54.080
Hey, hey, yo, feel our team a kilo kilo for a see. She was the last one to offer the water.

254
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.080
Lo y se con toda la tensio me more lent a minty.

255
00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.080
He la la la tiara.

256
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:14.080
But it's yet to be that a second. I see I'm going to read or a la la tiara commuses to be a reseka, but oh yeah muchas personas, and to me I am pass over to our work.

257
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:19.080
A, a, a, my study in Pianua Columbia.

258
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:41.080
So she put the water. She was the last one to put the water at the feet of she might be. And when she put the water, she saw that the water, make a very strong sound like something was absorbing very strong song like it was very thirsty and the water was very

259
00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:45.080
come to with a lot of force.

260
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:57.080
And in that moment she kind of surprised a little bit. And she say inside her mother, maybe you are cleaning more Columbia with your lotus feet.

261
00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:07.080
If you let me know so who's in menses grandes. So to me, he is this was a member who does it Columbia comista Columbia.

262
00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.920
Me twont

263
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:18.080
a Camila 850

264
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.080
funny story,

265
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.080
then versus

266
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:33.860
So, she, she might be in that moment, turn around and look at my, my mother and Doris.

267
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:37.940
So her eyes and us, how is Columbia.

268
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.940
How is everything.

269
00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:44.740
Are you going to Kabela this year who is going to Kabela from Columbia.

270
00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:50.140
And she also asked for the fabric that we as a Colombians we put all over the house

271
00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:57.380
we put in the, in the, in the tablecloth in her bedroom in his cartons and everywhere

272
00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.740
was a fabric that they bring from Colombia.

273
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:06.900
So she was asking about the fabric, how much cotton they have and she was talking a lot

274
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.260
about Colombia.

275
00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.700
And then that moment my mother feeling more relaxing and more relaxing.

276
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:53.900
She felt that that moment she feel like she might feel her soul with a lot of love, and

277
00:34:53.900 --> 00:35:01.180
she feel like it's a, the hope to the whole country and the whole.

278
00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.780
She feel like more connected and more in reality.

279
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.820
And in that moment feeling like more light.

280
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:29.620
And after that, she feel she left, and she feel like so much joy during the whole weekend.

281
00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:32.920
And she feel like she was so much love.

282
00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:39.080
She was having a lot of love and compassion from the Divine Mother, the whole weekend

283
00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:44.480
she feel connected and the vibrations was very lifted.

284
00:35:44.480 --> 00:36:12.360
And at the end, she told everybody that we have to ask for peace for Colombia, and to

285
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:18.040
finish the, the gorillas that was in that time very strong in Colombia.

286
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:22.760
I still feel that now, but that time was very strong.

287
00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:32.600
And after that, they start kind of expressing that is the story of Canalejar, more or less

288
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:42.120
that she has for you guys.

289
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:49.520
She has another story.

290
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:55.600
But Patricia, if Doris would like to tell her other story as well, while she's here,

291
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.600
that would be lovely.

292
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.200
Okay, now it's my story.

293
00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.480
Okay.

294
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.240
I don't know you understood everything I say before.

295
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.640
It's okay.

296
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.280
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.280
Okay.

298
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:15.120
We are we have also I was in the same house when she came to Canalejar.

299
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:22.320
And it was a very amazing moment for us as Colombians and South Americans, because they

300
00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.320
immediately.

301
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:30.760
No, the house was no furniture, nothing for Shemati.

302
00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:36.480
And they told us two days before she came to Canalejar, then we have to fix the house,

303
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.680
we have to fix the house.

304
00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.080
And they just rented because they took a long time to rent it, they cannot rent here, rent

305
00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.080
there.

306
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:47.120
They didn't find a place until the last minute or two days before the puja.

307
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.880
Two days before Shemati arrived actually on Friday.

308
00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:58.600
So somehow the Colombians bring a lot of pictures and a lot of decorations and because they

309
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:04.120
was thinking they had to decorate something because it was the puja of the South Americans.

310
00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:09.280
So we built this house, practically we transformed the house.

311
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:15.480
We took out all the pictures, we clean it up, and we put all this fabric that Shemati

312
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.760
is talking after, we put the fabric everywhere.

313
00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:27.320
We saw there all night and all days, we buy all these new kind of decorations and fix

314
00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.320
the house.

315
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.960
It was one bedroom, really one bedroom in the front and one bedroom downstairs.

316
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:39.520
And after, we kind of fixed the house.

317
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:45.320
The most amazing thing is before Shemati came, before even they called that when she's coming,

318
00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:52.440
we start feeling this peaceful, peaceful, very deep peaceful inside all of us.

319
00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:56.640
So it was a very collected piece.

320
00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:02.480
And we knew she's coming, we knew that the timing was very close, that she was getting

321
00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.800
closer and closer to the house.

322
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:15.560
And we kind of slowed down, got ready, changed our clothes and got completely ready for Shemati.

323
00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:22.920
And she made us ready because our Kundalini started jumping and we started feeling it.

324
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.120
And we all look at each other and we say, yes, she's here.

325
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.080
We started looking at each other and say, wow, she is coming.

326
00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:36.840
And it was very fulfilling that feel, that love for Shemati.

327
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:45.200
She knew what we did and how good as an easy and put us calm down because we was all rushing,

328
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.880
fixing things and calm down us and get ready.

329
00:39:49.880 --> 00:40:00.040
And when she stopped at the door, we was in such a state of joy and welcoming and such

330
00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:06.360
a connected with her and that she invited us to her house.

331
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:11.480
We give the party to her and she came inside and we supposed to leave.

332
00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:17.400
But no, she decided to invite us to her house and invite us to the little living room.

333
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.400
There was only like maybe 20 people can fit.

334
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:28.600
So we fit there and she asked us to do a little kind of puya practically.

335
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.360
She say, take out my socks.

336
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:36.920
We took out her socks and I have the privilege to be there.

337
00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:42.680
And she say, put me con con and put me turmeric.

338
00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:48.560
So we put the con con and we put the turmeric and sit down there.

339
00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.080
And now you sit down and you sit down there.

340
00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.960
Mr. CP was also there.

341
00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:59.180
And she start talking with him about Columbia before she asking us.

342
00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:05.440
She asked me, she said, how is Columbia in the politic, you know, and in her language.

343
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:12.360
And after she started talking to with us about Columbia, about and after this, many Colombians

344
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:20.160
actually got married that year, maybe five or six with and still marry in America.

345
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:27.000
So it was a very auspicious time for us as Colombians to be there in America with her

346
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.760
and to have this blessing to be so close and to full of vibrations.

347
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.920
She feel as vibrations.

348
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:41.200
Something that we asked her in that moment was like, please give us the power to express

349
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:49.880
Sahaja Yoga, to do her job, her to be her instrument.

350
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:57.320
And any and we see now many Colombians, they are doing this here in America and all over

351
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.320
the world.

352
00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.780
So she might give us that day.

353
00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.740
I feel a boom.

354
00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:06.600
So I feel very blessed for that moment.

355
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.320
That it was in Canada, having many other ones.

356
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.700
I have another one, Kannahari is with my little son.

357
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:22.440
He was only three months and in 2002, he was only three months and we decide to go to Kannahari

358
00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.900
with this little baby and camping.

359
00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:34.000
So we went there and in a point I was very worried because the baby was very hot, 80

360
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.500
degrees Fahrenheit in that time.

361
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:42.740
And he, the baby don't want to drink, want to fall down, like sleeping all the time.

362
00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:49.580
We had to take a shower, him to be able to kind of, and we decide to do at the same time,

363
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:55.960
I decided to do a very big album of all the children of America that had been born three

364
00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:00.180
years before and present after the project to Shama.

365
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.340
So I didn't expect there was so many.

366
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:08.900
When I start doing the album, I expect maybe 50 people.

367
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:12.180
No, I have like 300 pictures.

368
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:17.260
So I had to buy another album and another album and another album and make it and help

369
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:22.860
all the yogis start helping me to put it together to show to Shama.

370
00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:27.940
So the moment after the puja, I asked if I can do it and they say yes.

371
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:34.980
So I bring my baby with me and I bring the album and another yogi Niko was also married

372
00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:38.260
and can I hurry and have another baby.

373
00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.460
So we went together, Lilliana Walsh.

374
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:45.640
So we went together and offered the book and immediately she opened the book.

375
00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:51.200
She say all from America and I say, yes, Shama, all these children is from America.

376
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:58.340
And she say, we had to open a school here because there's so many children and we had

377
00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.480
to open a school in this place.

378
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.420
And she talked to Manoj and say, oh, we need to open a school.

379
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.420
Look at that.

380
00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.320
So many children in America.

381
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:14.240
So for me, it's where he kind of very historical that moment.

382
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.480
Also I put the baby at the feet of Shama.

383
00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.720
And I feel immediately I look at him.

384
00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:27.920
I feel her, she's Kundalini moving in the top of the head and his fontanella.

385
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:34.660
And I say, oh my God, it's so beautiful to be able to see how she, she's so powerful

386
00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:40.700
and of course as a child and how powerful she blessed him.

387
00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.700
Thank you.

388
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.700
And this is it.

389
00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:48.800
And after that, they did a school of Kanahari, school start one or two years after this.

390
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.200
I don't know what else.

391
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:59.800
I hope this is, I have many stories in Kanahari, but that they're the most important of them.

392
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.520
Well, that's beautiful.

393
00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:06.560
But if either you or your mother wants to tell another story, Patricia, I think we've

394
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.800
got a bit more time.

395
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.780
I said, if either you or your mother wants to tell another story, we have a little bit

396
00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.620
more time, I think.

397
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:22.980
Oh, I want to tell you a very amazing story in Colombia.

398
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.980
And my mommy also works here.

399
00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:25.980
That would be lovely.

400
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:26.980
Yes, yes.

401
00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:32.460
Okay.

402
00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:39.320
So we, she met at the site in 19, I don't know.

403
00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:46.520
In 1994, 1992.

404
00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:51.580
I don't remember the dates exactly, but she came many times to Colombia.

405
00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:56.740
And one of the times, I think it was 1992, she decided to go to Medellin.

406
00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:02.200
Medellin in that time, 1992 exactly, yeah, was very violent.

407
00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:07.760
Really, really the narco traffic took over the whole city and it started to put bombs

408
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:12.540
in the streets, in the malls, everywhere.

409
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:19.400
It was a mess because they was kind of very strong, the police within.

410
00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:24.960
And they decided to get into the police and get to fighting with the people there.

411
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.140
So they want to destroy practically the city.

412
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.260
And she might tell you even that she say, I'm going to Medellin.

413
00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:37.620
And Mr. CP say, you don't go to Medellin, it's too, too, too violent.

414
00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:43.120
But she sees and insists when she came, she decided to, we go to Medellin.

415
00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:48.300
And we wasn't not sure if she's coming or not to Medellin, no, because was the talk

416
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.760
of the, maybe she's coming, maybe not.

417
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.500
So we planned everything in Bogota.

418
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:58.660
And we did a very big program that 2,500 people show up.

419
00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.800
And it was amazing program.

420
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.940
And after she say, no, we are going to Medellin.

421
00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.220
So we didn't prepare a lot.

422
00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:13.460
So we only rent a room for her in case we reserve a room for her.

423
00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:20.400
We reserve also a hotel, a small one, a small kind of hotel room.

424
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.520
So maybe a thousand people or 900 people hotel room.

425
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:30.260
So we, we auditorium.

426
00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:36.620
So we jumped in the plane and we went to Medellin to Medellin.

427
00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:41.800
So we went to Medellin, we get there and we didn't have planned of publicity,

428
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.800
any publicity, very little.

429
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:50.860
So we was a little bit nervous and she was very confident that it's going to be perfect.

430
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.920
That program is going to be perfect.

431
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.000
It's going to be very good for the city, very good for us.

432
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.360
So we went with her and surrender everything.

433
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:06.760
So when we got there, she met all the jogies,

434
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:10.800
but so very few group people in Columbia and Medellin living there.

435
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.480
They already have the realization.

436
00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:17.160
They are already jogies, maybe 10 people maximum.

437
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:22.040
And they received to her and they are at the airport with flowers.

438
00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:29.280
And in that moment, one journalist was there and he asked, who is she?

439
00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:39.120
And so nobody told her, told him that is very important spiritual human being.

440
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.880
And she's coming to do a very nice program.

441
00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:47.600
And he started realizing that she speak English and he speak and

442
00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:52.160
she spoke with her, she say, Shimataji, I want to interview you.

443
00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:56.720
And he say, and Shimataji say, of course, come with me, come to the hotel with me.

444
00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:03.920
So he jumped in the car with Shimataji and start talking with Shimataji.

445
00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.440
And we go to the hotel, we all enter to the hotel and

446
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.320
they receive in the big presidential room.

447
00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.720
Well, they have a very big room.

448
00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.880
And so we sit down on the floor around her and

449
00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.960
then listening to the journalist asking questions to Shimataji.

450
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:27.880
And in that moment, he start asking questions, what do you want to do here?

451
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.480
Who you are?

452
00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:36.120
And in one point, he say, how about Jesus Christ?

453
00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.560
Who is Jesus Christ for you?

454
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:47.200
And he say, Jesus Christ is very important,

455
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.320
very important, especially because they give us the forgiveness,

456
00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.240
the power of forgiveness.

457
00:49:53.240 --> 00:50:00.200
So they say, wow, the power, yeah.

458
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.120
How is the power of forgiveness?

459
00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.040
They say, yeah, you will feel it.

460
00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:08.480
Put your hands like this and you are going to say, all together here,

461
00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.680
you are going to say the Lord's prayer.

462
00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.360
You're going to say in Spanish.

463
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:18.200
So we all put our hands and we say the Lord's prayer.

464
00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:24.840
And after we finish the Lord's prayer, we really was completely connected.

465
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.840
The journalist was completely absorbed.

466
00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.000
He cannot believe what he was feeling.

467
00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.440
And Shimataji say, did you see who is Jesus Christ?

468
00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:48.000
And he was like, yeah, that's incredible what I'm feeling.

469
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.720
So Shimataji say, now what are you going to do?

470
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:59.080
How we are going to tell the rest of the people that I am here and

471
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.080
I'm going to give you this knowledge?

472
00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.800
And he say, I'm going to the radio right now and

473
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:09.040
I'm going to tell everybody to come tonight to the program.

474
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:16.480
And so I want to ask you a favor, he say, I want to introduce you.

475
00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.640
Allow me to introduce you in the room.

476
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.000
And Shimataji say, of course, come and introduce me.

477
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:29.360
So was incredible because after he left, we feel overwhelming,

478
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:33.040
light and overwhelming, happy and joyful.

479
00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.440
But the most also that that was amazing blessing.

480
00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:43.240
Another blessing was that he went to the radio, he invite everybody.

481
00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:47.920
And the room was for more or less 3000 people waiting for

482
00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.080
the realization, their realization.

483
00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:57.000
And the talk, the introduction of the journalist was more beautiful than

484
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.240
any other yoga can do it.

485
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.040
Was incredible, well done.

486
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:09.200
So we need to find the video, the video is not so well, but it's very beautiful.

487
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:14.760
And it was amazing experience because from there, medicine changed completely.

488
00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:19.680
It's another city, a city very well done, very clean, very perfect.

489
00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:26.040
They have met to have many universities and many when wealth and

490
00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:31.480
in many other ways, they have a lot of yogis now.

491
00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.960
They have a lot of programs there.

492
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:38.640
And Shimataji sent a yogi to live there at the beginning.

493
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:42.400
Now there are many and it's a beautiful city now.

494
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.240
Yes, Shimataji.

495
00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.720
Just Shimataji.

496
00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.520
Just Shimataji.

497
00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.080
Just Shimataji.

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.680
Just Shimataji.

499
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:54.440
Just Shimataji, Patricia, that was wonderful, wonderful story.

500
00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:57.760
And I think very relevant to our times as well, man.

501
00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:02.200
Just how we can change, how our Sadriyogis can change whole cities.

502
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:07.360
Yeah, Shimataji has this power with us.

503
00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.200
I hope we can do that.

504
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.520
Well, we're her channels, we have to.

505
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.960
We have to, we have to, yeah.

506
00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.360
Yeah.

507
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.040
So I'm just going to stop the recording now.
