00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:15.299
Today is the second day of our new journey
into the battlefield.

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.140
We have to win people with love, compassion,
affection and dignity.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:34.630
When we say it's a Vishwa Dharma, it's a Universal
Religion we belong to, first and foremost

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:42.210
thing, the essence of that, is peace.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.680
The peace has to be within, to begin with.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.739
You have to be peaceful within yourself.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:03.440
If you are not peaceful, if you are playing
tricks with your ego, if you are just satisfying

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.259
yourself saying that you are peaceful, you
are sadly mistaken.

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:15.750
Peace is to be enjoyed within yourself.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.570
It is to be felt within yourself.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:28.049
So do not give wrong satisfactions to yourself,
do not give false notions to yourself.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.240
Don't cheat yourself.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.630
Peace has to be felt within yourself, and
if you are not feeling that, you shouldn't

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.880
come and ask me, "Mother, why I am not feeling
it."

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.770
Because I am not going to tell you that something
[is] wrong with you.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:54.110
You have to work it out that you should feel
peaceful within yourself.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.740
It is not that if you have too much of silence
outside, you feel peaceful.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.079
The peace has to be within yourself.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.079
You have it.

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:13.540
Your Spirit is absolutely peaceful -- Avyagra,
without restlessness.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.080
There is no restlessness in your Spirit.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.990
Absolutely peaceful and steady.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.760
It is for you to feel it.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.240
It is not for anybody else to certify you.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.240
This is one thing.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.200
Secondly, when I am telling you something,
you think I am not telling you.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.690
It doesn't register in your brain.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.340
You think I am telling it to X, Y, Z but not
to you.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.300
You are not in it.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.040
That's another sign [that] there is no peace.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.950
Because there is no peace, there is no registration.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.840
Whatever goes into your head, that is going
to work out.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:01.240
But what I find [is] that people [who] have
concave personalities, then they receive it.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.700
Those who have convex personalities, do not
register anything . The registration is so

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.770
poor that, whatever I say doesn't have any
effect on them.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.790
Otherwise, whatever I say is a mantra.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:23.310
It should have direct effect on you, and you
should feel that effect, that penetration

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.950
within you.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:38.200
But as if it is for somebody else, as if it
is not for you.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.490
This shows there is no peace within you.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:54.890
Only the peace within can register whatever
is auspicious, whatever is nourishing for

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.790
your growth.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.580
So try to make peace with yourself.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.700
Do not fight with yourself, "Why should I
do it?", "I am so bad!", "I should not have

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.700
done it!"

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.850
-- all these we should not do.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.360
Try not to fight with yourself, first of all.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.970
Then you fight with me, "Why am I like this?

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.370
Why should it be like this with me?

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.370
Why is it I catch?

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.370
Why.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.130
. . .?." How am I to answer such a question?

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.130
It is very aggressive.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.250
I think it is very aggressive attitude of
many Sahaja Yogis to come and ask me such

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.250
a question, "Why...?"

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.870
Because I can't tell you what is wrong with
you because it is not in my culture.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.010
You should find yourself what is wrong with
you . But it's not "what's wrong with you"

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.160
is the problem.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.440
What is right with you is the attitude.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.220
Whatever is right with you, put your foot
on that, establish yourself on that point.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.480
And then develop yourself higher.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:10.310
Peace is the keynote, as I said, for universal
growth of this Religion.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.350
It is disturbed by many things.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.340
Firstly, as I said, by yourself.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.470
You shouldn't have funny ideas about yourself.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.010
People have very funny ideas.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.410
I see Sahaja Yogis, as soon as they get realisation,
or something better happens to them, they

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.771
start telling others how to do meditation,
how to stand up, how to give bandhan, how

00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:33.820
to do this and that.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.230
It's very very poor, is very low level.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.380
Try to assimilate within yourself.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.430
First grow yourself That growth itself, will
tell others how one should be.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.080
Your own character, your own temperament,
your own nature, your own behaviour.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.290
All this will tell others that this is a great
man and they will try to follow your example.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.530
Example is the best teaching.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:13.210
When the tree is small, even if he says "I
am great," nobody is going to sit under a

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.210
dwarf tree!

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.780
But when it is a big tree you can see the
shade and everybody knows it's a big tree

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.870
and they can come and sit under that.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.310
You don't have to tell.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:35.080
In the same way, when you grow, you don't
have to certify 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.030
that "I am great", it just works.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.680
Now the peace within expresses, first of all,
[as] peace with others.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:52.300
That is the first sign of manifestation of
peace.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:07:00.860
Such a person doesn't use harsh words, doesn't
use cruel words.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.370
But he's also not a person who is ineffective.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.780
He's very effective, using very sweet and
nice words.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.860
Maybe he begins by using harsh words, then
he mellows down and comes down to a position

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.600
where he is effective as well as he is very
mild and sweet.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:29.260
Such a personality has to be developed -- outside.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.990
So, peace with your friends, peace with Sahaja
Yogis.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.780
If you cannot be peaceful with Sahaja Yogis
then you are no good.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.450
Absolutely no good.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:48.230
When you meet another Sahaja Yogi you can't
bark like dogs at each other, can you?

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:54.180
You leave three Sahaja Yogis together, you
end up with a big barking system.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.540
They can't manage within themselves.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.790
If there are hundred, then it's alright.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:08.860
But you can't leave three and four here and
there.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:14.720
So the peace should be with your brothers
and sisters.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:24.430
They are all born out of My Sahasrara and
nobody has the right to insult, to be sarcastic.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.639
Saying things which are harmful.

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:33.680
That's no friendship, that's no friendship.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.820
It is a kind of a very subtle enmity that
you are carrying on in your hearts.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.950
That cannot be forgiveness.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:55.260
If you say sarcastic things to others, you
are not in the culture of Universal Religion.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.070
You should be respectful.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:07.460
The more respectable you are to each other,
the better it would be.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.960
I don't know how to tell you this.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:16.290
But say, there is a Sahaja Yogi, you shouldn't
call him like as you would call any Tom Dick

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:22.030
and Harry.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.150
Like there's someone going.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.510
"Eh Mr. X, come here!"

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.540
Now people don't even say Mister.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.020
Please try to use their surnames would be
better.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.750
Mr. So, Mr. So Mr. So.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.460
.Would be better.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.130
Because this modern style of not using the
surname has brought down the respect for each

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.130
other.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:55.400
But I think, Sahaja Yogis should try a new
method and suggest to Me even better methods,

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:02.930
how to address each other, in such a way that
you respect others.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.880
That respect will create that peace within
each other.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.010
Suddenly you come out with remarks.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.560
Very nasty remarks they are.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.760
There's no sense in it.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.760
That's not our culture.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.510
We belong to Universal Religion, how can it
be that culture?

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:34.770
So, when you try to be peaceful with your
brothers and sisters, try to be extremely

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.770
respectful.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:42.320
When you write letters to each other, you
say "My dear brother in Sahaja Yoga Such and

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.420
Such."

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.310
I have seen all communists do that.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.750
Any body who belongs to any party does that.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:57.290
It's a kind of a respect they have.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:11.470
You can't talk like street people and ordinary
people because you are really extraordinary,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:19.140
and all that is extraordinary has to be expressed
through you.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:32.300
As I am talking to you of this new culture,
let us understand how in many nations, people

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.580
have adopted cultures and cultures.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.890
Japan, I know, has been affected, very much,
by modernisation.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:49.550
But Zen taught them certain kind of culture
in which, supposing, you see two Japanese

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.940
have a car and they break each other's car,
then they don't say anything.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.860
They come out of their car, one will bow to
another, the another will bow to another,

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.260
and get into the car and get out.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.670
Then if they have to claim something, they'll
go to the courts, but there they don't fight,

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.720
because what is the need?

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.420
And I asked Japanese, "How do you manage it?"

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.880
So they said, "But what is the need to fight
there on the street?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.640
Because after all, if it is to be paid, it's
the insurance that is going to pay.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.480
If the car is broken, alright they are going
to pay us.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.750
Why to shout at him?"

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.320
It's very sensible and practical, I think.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.280
Why to waste your breath for nothing at all?

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.339
You are not going to get anything.

00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:36.630
But I have known people who drive, and they
are abusing every person who comes across

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.630
on their driving.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.790
I mean, really it's curse of life, the way
some people drive!

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.770
And the same way they drive in their own lives.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.380
All the time cursing this, "That one is like
this, this one is bad, that one is doing like

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.380
that".

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.820
Even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.620
They think they have a right to criticize
each and every person except for themselves.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.670
So to keep this peace with others, be on an
apologetic mood.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.110
"I hope I haven't done this mistake."

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.800
"I hope I haven't hurt you."

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.140
"I hope I haven't put your things in a wrong
way."

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.140
Like that.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:18.010
Be on an apologetic mood.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.800
You can find that among Indians.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.730
Indians have that kind of a problem, they
are more on apologetic mood.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.330
Sometimes, it is impossible to convince them.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.730
I will give you an example.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:37.310
We went down to Sangli, and you were so full
in the morning and the food was not ready.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:43.400
So they said that "We cannot have our food
because it is late now and it will be later,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.750
so better we sleep off."

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.580
They felt very hurt, you know.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.910
They thought that it was their mistake.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:57.029
Now, it is registered that we haven't given
food to them, it is a horrid thing we have

00:13:57.029 --> 00:13:58.339
done.

00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:02.030
And then I had to convince them that they
are no way hurt, they are happy that they

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.260
are not eating, they have too much of food.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:09.300
"No, but still it will be registered in our
name that we didn't offer them food and they

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.190
slept without any food."

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:17.450
It was impossible to convince them till the
end, they were all the time feeling apologetic.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:21.831
You see in Indian culture, we have something
very great, as Japanese, as I told you, that

00:14:21.831 --> 00:14:25.580
we are more on the apologetic style.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.230
Never on the aggressive.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:34.740
Never trying to find faults with others, but
we find faults in what way we have failed,

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.220
how we have failed.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:44.339
This is something to be learned from Indians,
if they have retained their culture at all.

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:54.760
It's actually in their blood.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:02.460
So that is how, our culture is going to be
such that we will express complete peace within

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.460
ourselves.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.140
And you must know that you are in one body,
active.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.680
You are active cells in one body.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.120
All the cells of the body are never active.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.080
But those who are active have to be at peace
with each other, otherwise, what will happen

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.750
to that poor body?

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.740
So try to make peace.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.560
The second thing you can do to make peace
is to talk less.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.790
Whenever there is a quarrel or anything, just
keep quiet.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:35.050
You see, it will have better effect.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:40.209
If two persons are quarrelling, never try
to solve it, but just keep quiet.

00:15:40.209 --> 00:15:42.790
Quiet is very important.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.050
More to be silent.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.170
But it should not be another extreme like
English culture, that they just don't talk,

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.180
whatever it is.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:56.779
They don't talk, but, they think too much.

00:15:56.779 --> 00:16:11.709
You must keep quiet with the feeling that
'May God bless these people some sense."

00:16:11.709 --> 00:16:18.540
It should not be ice frozen sea, but peace
which is effective.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.540
Peace that is effective.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:27.200
So in this new culture, we have to be extremely
peaceful people.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:35.649
And that peace should be expressed on your
faces.

00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:38.330
People should understand that you are peaceful.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:44.860
That's why I say, if you are neatly dressed,
your hair are neatly put, people will feel

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.860
alright.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.190
Otherwise if you reach some person with dishevelled
hair, you know he gets disturbed as it is!

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.070
"God knows what has happened?

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.950
From which quarrel this man is coming?

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:59.500
Somebody must have pulled his hair, or must
have something gone wrong with him, that the

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:05.520
way he is dishevelled."

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.860
So if you are neatly dressed, people are not
put off so much, because they think that "No,

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.339
no, this cannot be, because, you see, after
all, he never had a quarrel.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:18.059
He's just coming peacefully from his house."

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:22.779
In our culture, neatness in very important.

00:17:22.779 --> 00:17:32.090
Neatness of thought, neatness of mind, neatness
of body, neatness of behaviour.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.789
How you do things neatly is very important
in our culture.

00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:37.720
That's very, very important!

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.460
Which may look very funny to some people.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:48.399
Because, whether you hold the fork this way
or that way makes no difference to Me.

00:17:48.399 --> 00:17:53.179
It doesn't matter how you hold your fork or
knife on a table.

00:17:53.179 --> 00:17:54.940
That's not so important.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:04.909
But it's definitely it's important how you
hold the Aarti, how you hold the Puja things,

00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:08.799
how you hold my photographs.

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:14.970
How you hold the things that belong to other
Sahaja Yogis, how you respect the things that

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:21.230
are auspicious.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:25.929
So that is what one has to have within yourself.

00:18:25.929 --> 00:18:32.399
The neatness, of piousness, of auspiciousness,
of holiness.

00:18:32.399 --> 00:18:40.090
That is to be done with very great care and
understanding, and with that weight of auspiciousness

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.090
you should walk.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.109
With that weight of auspiciousness.

00:18:43.109 --> 00:18:51.320
You are auspiciousness walking on this earth,
yourself.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.480
You are peace on this earth.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:06.480
But the way peace is put into this vessel
has to be clean, has to be neat and has to

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:16.559
be placed in such a way that nothing spills
out.

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:25.850
So to have peace, the best way to put your
mind right, is to think of good things.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.769
Think of the flowers, not of the thorns.

00:19:28.769 --> 00:19:31.039
What good things others have done to you.

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.039
What good things there are.

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:38.899
What are the beautiful moments you have had,
and count your blessings.

00:19:38.899 --> 00:19:42.149
Count your blessings.

00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:45.379
Otherwise you cannot create peace.

00:19:45.379 --> 00:20:00.609
[Mother tells someone off in Marathi]
You need not pay attention to everything like

00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:01.609
that.

00:20:01.609 --> 00:20:03.499
Keep your attention at peace.

00:20:03.499 --> 00:20:13.049
Keep the peace inside, with your attention
inside.

00:20:13.049 --> 00:20:25.070
Actually, if you really allow all my words
to go inside your brain, I'm sure I'll achieve

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:30.119
the results but with a convex mind, it's very
difficult.

00:20:30.119 --> 00:20:31.429
Just suck in!

00:20:31.429 --> 00:20:43.330
The 

00:20:43.330 --> 00:21:00.879
another aspect of peace is never try to support
anything that is boisterous or which is destructive.

00:21:00.879 --> 00:21:04.940
Anything that is destructive is never to be
supported.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:19.499
But anybody who is being tortured or aggressed
or dominated, is to be protected and supported.

00:21:19.499 --> 00:21:30.239
If you have the strength of peace, you can
do it just by standing there.

00:21:30.239 --> 00:21:34.159
You don't have to fight for your peace.

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:38.610
But if it comes to that...

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:49.529
A person like Hitler when he came, people
had to fight for their peace.

00:21:49.529 --> 00:21:58.159
Now, the second part of our culture has to
be Bliss.

00:21:58.159 --> 00:22:00.259
People should see bliss working in us.

00:22:00.259 --> 00:22:02.059
People should feel there is bliss.

00:22:02.059 --> 00:22:13.249
If a person is blissful, he looks blissful.

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:16.129
He emits, bliss.

00:22:16.129 --> 00:22:20.440
He radiates it.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:28.519
He doesn't look a miserable, unhappy creature,
who is all the time grudging, grumbling or

00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:35.070
worried about little petty things here and
there.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:39.779
And nobody has the right to disturb anybody's
bliss.

00:22:39.779 --> 00:22:49.059
[If] somebody is in a blissful state, try
to copy that person and become that.

00:22:49.059 --> 00:22:53.980
But people get jealous of such people who
are blissful and try to disturb!

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:59.840
That's why so many saints were tortured, because
they were so blissful and happy people.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:08.210
We have to enjoy our bliss within, that is
important.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.320
Perhaps you are not aware of the bliss that
you have.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.059
Not at all aware.

00:23:15.059 --> 00:23:19.139
Never, never before there were so many people
who got realisation.

00:23:19.139 --> 00:23:33.320
Never before, in the history, that Adi Shakti
Herself came on this earth to solve your problems.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:50.700
Never before, that people of very ordinary
effort, of very little seeking, of very little

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.000
understanding have been given realisation
like this.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:03.639
It's like, sometimes, if you see, like a stone
becoming a diamond suddenly.

00:24:03.639 --> 00:24:09.299
You can cut a diamond from a diamond.

00:24:09.299 --> 00:24:12.749
Such blissful state you are in.

00:24:12.749 --> 00:24:16.720
It's tremendous bliss has come.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.749
It's so effective.

00:24:17.749 --> 00:24:24.099
I myself don't know when I see them.

00:24:24.099 --> 00:24:30.929
I'm really surprised how it is working.

00:24:30.929 --> 00:24:33.549
Bliss can only come through gratitude.

00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:37.320
Only through enlarging your heart with gratitude.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:44.129
Bliss is the reward of gratitude.

00:24:44.129 --> 00:24:54.960
The gratitude which is not just worldly or
just spoken lip-service, but is from the heart,

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:04.740
is from the heart, gratitude of the heart.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:12.480
And the blissful people are never jealous
of others because what is greater than bliss?

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:21.220
Bliss has so many dimensions that you go beyond
the realm of cause and effects.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:26.879
All the angels, all the ganas are there to
help you.

00:25:26.879 --> 00:25:28.049
You know that it works out.

00:25:28.049 --> 00:25:29.519
This way it works out, that....

00:25:29.519 --> 00:25:30.989
But you take it for granted.

00:25:30.989 --> 00:25:38.000
You don't have that effect of the bliss in
you when you know this has happened, that,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.299
has happened.

00:25:39.299 --> 00:25:41.259
What a bliss!

00:25:41.259 --> 00:25:43.710
You cross your hearts when you feel blissful.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.830
Cross your hearts and feel that, just see.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.989
Feel the bliss like this -- cross your hearts.

00:25:49.989 --> 00:25:51.840
Feel the bliss!

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.940
Tremendous bliss is within us.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:05.570
How much it has happened to us that God has
been so kind.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:10.770
Will you please put your hands across those
who are sitting down there, please!

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.970
The other lady also.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:17.390
Where is she looking?

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:23.979
You are sitting on a chair, must you look
at every person who is coming?

00:26:23.979 --> 00:26:27.119
There is no need!.

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:32.099
Feel it!

00:26:32.099 --> 00:26:42.070
May God bless you.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:51.090
So this bliss when you find everywhere, in
a little thing also you find there is bliss.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:55.039
Zen taught that to people.

00:26:55.039 --> 00:27:02.840
They saw bliss in seeing only a moss, a little
bit of moss, and you see the moss and you

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.650
say, "0 God, what a beautiful piece it is!

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:13.109
" God has created little moss, and that moss
has all that little little tentacles, and

00:27:13.109 --> 00:27:15.090
that bliss.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:19.869
But those who are vain people can never feel
bliss.

00:27:19.869 --> 00:27:22.719
Vanity kills bliss.

00:27:22.719 --> 00:27:25.570
Ego kills bliss.

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:30.779
Once Shivaji was building a huge fort.

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:37.379
And, there it so happened that he got into
ego.

00:27:37.379 --> 00:27:43.549
He felt, "See because of this work, so many
people are employed."

00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:48.359
[Then] his Guru Ramdasa appeared on the scene.

00:27:48.359 --> 00:27:53.590
He himself is the controller of ego, because
he was the incarnation of Hanumana.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:59.169
So he came and he said "Alright, I want you
to do one thing for me".

00:27:59.169 --> 00:28:01.419
He said, "Yes Sir, what do you want me to
do?"

00:28:01.419 --> 00:28:08.769
He said, "You break this boulder that is lying
here, such a big boulder, bit by bit."

00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:12.070
So it started breaking when people hit it.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:22.220
And inside came a little stone which he took
up just like a coconut in his hand and he

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.279
broke [it].

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:32.659
And there was water and there was a frog inside.

00:28:32.659 --> 00:28:39.099
And he realised, Shivaji, that, "if God has
created this frog, He's also given him water.

00:28:39.099 --> 00:28:44.169
Who am I to have this ego?"

00:28:44.169 --> 00:28:52.720
So the bliss came into him, that God has provided
me with everything.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.169
It's just a red-carpet treatment for me.

00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:58.720
What have I done?

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.720
Nothing.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.999
It is so beautiful!

00:29:01.999 --> 00:29:06.830
How many have got this bliss?

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.309
Have sympathy for them.

00:29:09.309 --> 00:29:13.369
Have compassion for them, those who do not
have.

00:29:13.369 --> 00:29:22.759
But bliss comes to you through your confidence,
If you have no confidence in yourself, bliss

00:29:22.759 --> 00:29:27.129
cannot be.

00:29:27.129 --> 00:29:30.239
And the worst thing against confidence is
-- "Then what should I do?

00:29:30.239 --> 00:29:32.999
Then how can I get it?

00:29:32.999 --> 00:29:35.279
Then why not I have?" -- is the worst.

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:41.559
You fighting yourself all the time!

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:49.850
You are that, sitting on that, and still if
you are saying, "Why shouldn't have it," so

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:50.850
what to answer?

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:54.960
I mean you just want to ask because you have
to ask?

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.960
It's there.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.259
Why are you asking?

00:29:57.259 --> 00:30:05.509
Just feel it!

00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:17.200
If that works out, that you feel where you
are sitting, then you'll be surprised that

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:29.889
you are at peace with yourself, and there
is bliss.

00:30:29.889 --> 00:30:35.320
Last of all, in this culture, you Have to
behave like people who have authority.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.219
You have the authority of your Spirit.

00:30:37.219 --> 00:30:38.729
You are authorised.

00:30:38.729 --> 00:30:40.729
You have the Spirit.

00:30:40.729 --> 00:30:44.629
Those who are in authority never try to show
off.
