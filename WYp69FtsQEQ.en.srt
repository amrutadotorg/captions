1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:02,629
They were sitting, had come to attend the programme.

2
00:00:02,729 --> 00:00:05,337
Even then were thinking about some of their problems.

3
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:09,493
This happened with me, that happened, it happened like this, like that.

4
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:14,787
And when shall i tell about my problem to Mataji?

5
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:17,382
 Mataji you are also not here. I am in such a problem.

6
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:20,858
Instead of understanding what is being said

7
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:27,664
In your thoughts of your inner being, you left in that provocation.

8
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,758
And in that illusion, you got cancer.

9
00:00:30,783 --> 00:00:38,693
You got this disease, you got that disease.

10
00:00:38,718 --> 00:00:43,310
Just mental projection, what are we thinking mentally?

11
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:46,000
What type of thoughts do we get?

12
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:49,300
Thoughts such as, we have this grief, we have that grief

13
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:53,204
this mammoth problem.

14
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:57,410
Instead what shoild you think? “Count your blessings”.

15
00:00:57,435 --> 00:01:02,029
How many blessings of Mother do we have?

16
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:05,389
Crores of people live in this city of Delhi.

17
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:13,004
How many of them have got Sahajyoga?

18
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:14,432
We are some special people

19
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:18,113
not some frivolous people who should spoil their attention.

20
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:19,905
We have got Sahajyoga.

21
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,376
We should have a realization of this from within

22
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:26,086
 and should go deeper into that inner being.

23
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:43,025
That is how you can get rid of these deceitful limitations.

24
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,596
Whatever you think is your own

25
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:50,519
If you will say we are from Delhi

26
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:54,608
One day these people from Delhi will outcast you.

27
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,529
If you will say we are from Noida

28
00:01:56,554 --> 00:02:00,989
one day, people from Noida will run after you with their guns.

29
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:07,273
Then you will realize why did I say I am from Noida?

30
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:09,827
Then, when you will run towards Delhi

31
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:10,683
the people from Delhi will scorn you saying

32
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,407
Saying you are from Noida. why did you come here?

33
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:16,765
This way, you will belong nowhere and will have nowhere to call your own.

34
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,084
The reason for this is that

35
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:24,431
your attention also belongs nowhere, neither here, nor there.

36
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:26,920
Unless you realize and go deeper into this

37
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:29,863
you might call yourself a Sahaja Yogini or a Sahaja Yogi

38
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:32,805
I don’t think you are one in the real sense.

39
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,243
Because the first attribute of a Sahaja Yogi is that

40
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:43,958
he has tranquil attention

41
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:49,478
and is extremely powerful.

42
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:54,609
Not scared of anyone, is strong.

43
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:58,571
And his life is very pure

44
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:03,478
his body is pure, his heart is pure

45
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:10,049
 and with the light of his Spirit, he spreads love in the whole world.

46
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:17,505
I think somebody who cannot love, cannot be a Sahaja Yogi at all.

47
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,737
He hasn’t climbed even the first step of the ladder.

48
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:30,599
Like you see, so many kites flying in the sky

49
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:34,931
but they are managed by somebody.

50
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:38,754
If any of the kite’s string breaks, or if the grip is lost

51
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:41,072
 one can never know where the kite will fly off.

52
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:44,481
The same is the case with Atma.

53
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:48,699
So, keep your attention towards your Spirit

54
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:53,913
and making yourself pure in this process is the penance in Sahaja Yoga.

55
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:59,061
For this, you did a hawan today, this is also a penance

56
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:03,754
because fire engulfs and destroys all the things.

57
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:12,508
Similarly, by your penance all your bad thoughts

58
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:20,208
all your wrong limitations within, will be destroyed.

59
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:26,007
Receiving this bliss is your right and you can achieve this joy

60
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:28,512
 and you have achieved it too.

61
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:33,753
But, to spread this joy, you must have depth.

62
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:38,725
If you go to Ganga Ji with a small bowl

63
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,537
you can fill water in it and come back.

64
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:46,193
But if you take a pitcher along, you can fill the pitcher and be back.

65
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:50,627
However, if you can make such arrangements

66
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:53,966
that the water from the Ganges can be redirected towards you

67
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:58,253
you can have  water flowing from Ganges around you.

68
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:01,186
So, in which state should should you watch yourself?.

69
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:04,373
Are you taking water in a bowl from Sahaja Yoga?

70
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:09,825
Are you limited to the joy of self? Or for everyone’s joy?

71
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:15,450
Or, are you the source of this bliss?

72
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:26,442
So, this Agnya Chakra is penance , this is a penance.

73
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:32,765
To attain depth, it is important to have austerity.

74
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,581
We spread far and wide. Sahaja Yoga spreads rapidly.

75
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,186
You will see in the programmes.

76
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:42,683
I wonder whether all people can be accommodated in the hall?

77
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,877
How will it be managed?

78
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:49,220
It will spread rapidly. But how many attain the depth?

79
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:53,011
So, for attaining this depth, austerity is required.

80
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:58,321
By penance, I don’t mean you should sit and fast. It is not required.

81
00:05:58,346 --> 00:06:03,845
But, if your attention is on food, then you must abstain from it.

82
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,063
To watch your attention at all times, is the penance in Sahaja Yoga.

83
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:11,256
Because you spoil your agnya because of your attention.

84
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:15,309
Where is my attention? What am I thinking?

85
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:19,054
What am I doing at this moment? What am I thinking?

86
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:26,183
If you watch your attention

87
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:33,153
always watch your conscience

88
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:42,718
then your attention will be illuminated in the Agnya.

89
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:46,859
This is penance.

90
00:06:46,883 --> 00:06:50,753
To control your attention, observe and watch your attention and thoughts.

91
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,760
Watch now, where is your attention?

92
00:06:53,943 --> 00:06:57,853
 I am talking and where is your attention?

93
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:06,710
The moment you start talking about attention, where did it go?

94
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:14,649
The attention is so distracted. I am talking and where is your attention?

95
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:17,934
 So, you should watch your attention.

96
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,192
Controlling attention doesn’t mean doing it forcefully.

97
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:26,395
But when you watch your attention in the light of your Spirit

98
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:33,585
then your attention becomes illuminated.

99
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,572
You should be focused on watching your attention, when you see anything.

100
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:46,298
 For example, this pillar in front of me is adorned with beautiful flowers.

101
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:49,512
Now in each vision you can observe something.

102
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,768
I can remember everything.

103
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:55,277
Where, which, wherever and how much is the difference?

104
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:58,087
The whole image is formed.

105
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:03,257
The attention’s concentration is what forms these images.

106
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,434
That is what improves your memory.

107
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,669
You can know everything in totality.

108
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,616
You come to know everything through your attention.

109
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,361
But, if your attention is distracted

110
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:21,070
then you cannot grasp the depth or intensity of anything.

111
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:22,671
If your attention is moving outside all the time

112
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:23,482
you cannot remember anything.

113
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,368
So, you see, I see this everywhere

114
00:08:25,392 --> 00:08:25,986
like at the airport

115
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,219
talking to someone here but looking somewhere else.

116
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:29,544
looking here, then looking there.

117
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:34,677
 But you won’t remember anything, who is it, what is it?

118
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:38,245
 So, pure attention is very focussed.

119
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:42,139
And such attention will absorb only what is worthy of being absorbed.

120
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:44,456
 Something that isn’t worthy, pure attention will not absorb it.

121
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,623
It won’t look towards such things.

122
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:50,446
 It will be averted from such things on its own.

123
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:55,431
Because it is so pure, it can’t be corrupted by impure things.

124
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:57,777
 It cannot go there.

125
00:08:57,801 --> 00:09:03,916
Now this is up to you that you watch within and see

126
00:09:03,941 --> 00:09:06,229
'where is my attention going?'

127
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:07,115
 This is the penance.

128
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:09,154
In Sahaja Yoga this is the only penance.

129
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:12,313
Watch where my attention is going?

130
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:18,038
Where am I going? Where is my heart going?

131
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:22,521
If you can do this penance, you will cross  Agnya.

132
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:24,792
And there are no doubts about Sahastrāra

133
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:27,920
because I am already sitting there.
