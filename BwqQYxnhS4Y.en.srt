00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:07,336
Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 10 September 1995.

2
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:22,632
With all the Ganapatis sitting around me

3
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:26,651
and you all the ganas sitting in front of me,

4
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:29,877
I don’t know what to say.

5
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:36,100
It’s remarkable, very remarkable,

6
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,038
because most of you come from a culture

7
00:02:41,198 --> 00:02:44,968
which has never shown any respect of Shri Ganesh.

8
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:49,066
They never realised how important it was that,

9
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:53,415
without Shri Ganesha’s qualities,

10
00:02:55,088 --> 00:03:00,159
we cannot achieve anything in our life.

11
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:10,370
The idea of everyday, moment-to-moment enjoyment has destroyed them.

12
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:16,034
And also the desire to know the Divine

13
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:27,948
vanishes also in the thin air

14
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:34,503
because you get lost into this moment-to-moment enjoyment

15
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:39,971
till you get destructive, completely destroyed.

16
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:49,299
But I really don’t understand how you have achieved this state

17
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:54,370
where you see [that] the purity is so important to life;

18
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:03,330
that Ganesha’s qualities, His value system

19
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:09,601
and His innocence are to be imbibed.

20
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:23,948
I feel very gratified that such a thing has happened now in your lives

21
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:29,893
and you all are so much in praise for Shri Ganesha.

22
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:38,412
Shri Ganesha is there from our childhood.

23
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:42,499
Yesterday you saw the children, how they were so beautiful

24
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,171
and entertained us the most.

25
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:48,608
Everybody had a smile on their face and I said,

26
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:53,594
“Don’t laugh,” because if you laugh they feel a little offended

27
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:57,495
and they think that you are laughing at them.

28
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:08,667
The enjoyment that we had from that drama of children

29
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:15,217
was more than what one would expect

30
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:20,487
from adults doing that kind of a drama just to entertain us.

31
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:26,511
It might be some sort of a very subtle joy of Shri Ganesha

32
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:28,968
that made us so happy.

33
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:35,605
We all have Shri Ganesh settled very nicely within ourselves

34
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:42,570
and, in you, awakened; awakened in such a manner

35
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:48,433
that, in your free will also, you do not want to do things

36
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:52,515
that will go against Shri Ganesha.

37
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:59,011
His manifestation within you is so evident.

38
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:04,351
you see your faces – they are so beautifully shining,

39
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:07,343
so very different from other people.

40
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:11,804
One day I was travelling from London

41
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:18,190
and there was one Indian lady who came to see me and she said,

42
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,573
“I was surprised to see your disciples. Their faces were shining

43
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:31,475
with such light. I have never seen any disciples like that.”

44
00:06:32,147 --> 00:06:37,026
I asked her, “Who are you?”

45
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:41,057
She said, “I am married in Guru Nanak’s family

46
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:46,839
and all the people in his family are just the opposite

47
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:49,874
[of] what Guru Nanak was.”

48
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,374
So I said, “Because they worship Shri Ganesha.”

49
00:06:57,429 --> 00:07:02,792
So she said that, “In our family nobody worships Shri Ganesh.”

50
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:06,147
I said, “It cannot be possible! How is it?”

51
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,796
They believe in nirakar, in the formless God of chaitanya.

52
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:19,819
I said, “But who is the source of that chaitanya?

53
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:22,972
Why don’t they find out who is the source?”

54
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:28,065
So they said that Nanaka has only talked up to this point.

55
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:30,991
He’s not talked about the source.

56
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:37,515
I said, “Better find out,

57
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:42,440
because in this book maybe some things have been taken away.”

58
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,300
And then somebody gave me a passage where he had described

59
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,421
the innocence, the Deity of Shri Ganesha also.

60
00:07:53,483 --> 00:08:00,202
He had described that the whole Creation was done by the Mother

61
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,175
and not by the Father.

62
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:05,269
It’s very surprising because nirakaris,

63
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:10,690
those people, who don’t believe in the forms of God,

64
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,136
always talk of Father, not of the Mother.

65
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:25,905
It is true also about Christianity, also about Islam,

66
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,983
also about the Jews.

67
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,417
All of them, they talk of the Father and not of the Mother,

68
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:39,975
nor about Shri Ganesh.

69
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:49,144
It seems, in the ancient times they believed in child God,

70
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:56,964
even in China, even in Greece and also in many other countries

71
00:08:57,124 --> 00:09:02,765
who were supposed to be primitive. But they all believed in the child God.

72
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,401
So now, when we deal with our children,

73
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:16,448
we should know that they are just like Shri Ganesh:

74
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:20,889
they are very innocent, very simple;

75
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:26,909
except in cases sometimes [where] they are affected by some things

76
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:29,764
and they lose their moorings.

77
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:40,636
But Shri Ganesha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is

78
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:45,702
that He makes you feel My vibrations.

79
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:53,437
He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity.

80
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:58,577
[It’s] only possible if Shri Ganesha is awakened within you.

81
00:09:59,857 --> 00:10:05,831
Also the Kundalini won’t rise without the sanction of this ‘chancellor’.

82
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:09,288
He’s the one sitting on Mooladhara.

83
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:13,717
But you should know He is on every chakra.

84
00:10:14,827 --> 00:10:24,284
Innocence cures all the maladies, physical, mental, emotional,

85
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:26,717
specially the spiritual one.

86
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:32,241
But Shri Ganesha’s quality, the most important, is

87
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:38,296
that He believes in emitting vibrations,

88
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:45,827
He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone.

89
00:10:46,702 --> 00:10:55,585
That is the quality now [that] I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.

90
00:10:57,171 --> 00:11:04,293
You got your Realisation without any effort I should say.

91
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:06,147
It was Sahaj.

92
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:13,276
The life before Self-realisation was different.

93
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:15,791
You got your transformation

94
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:25,842
and you have jumped into the new era of Meta Science.

95
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:29,378
But here now we have to see

96
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:34,628
whatever we have got, what are we to do with it?

97
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:39,567
You, of course, know that you have to give Realisations to others,

98
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:47,948
you have to cure people, you have to love them

99
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,714
and you have to be compassionate

100
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:58,675
but apart from that, now the deliberations about yourself have to start.

101
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:03,480
That is through Shri Ganesha’s powers that are within you.

102
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:13,087
You should see that you can emit your powers your energy to others.

103
00:12:13,258 --> 00:12:15,977
You can project it to others.

104
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:24,289
Now, for example, If somebody comes to you, meets you,

105
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:31,313
if you know how to deliberately project your energy.

106
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,471
This is a new type of meditation you have to practise now:

107
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:41,291
that to emit your energy, project your energy to others.

108
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:44,822
You don’t have to say anything, you don’t have to talk

109
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:49,479
but just feel deliberately – again I say deliberately.

110
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,580
It’s not sahaj, it’s not spontaneous.

111
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,924
This is what you have to practise,

112
00:12:55,084 --> 00:13:01,498
is to emit your energy of your innocence of Shri Ganesha to others

113
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:07,251
so, when they see you, their innocence would be awakened.

114
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,807
Now, for example, say

115
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:20,851
we had some problems in London and Sahaj Yogis told me,

116
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:24,768
“Mother, there are still some men are looking at us.”

117
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:30,471
And some said that, “There are many women who are looking at us.”

118
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:34,865
It was a mutual sort of a thing going on.

119
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:44,084
I said, “You can project your energy in such a manner

120
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:52,205
that that projection will stop all this kind of stupid behaviour of other people

121
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:58,935
and also make them understand, respect you and feel your dignity.”

122
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,936
Not very difficult.

123
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:07,065
But, on the contrary, as the culture is

124
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:13,030
to attract men and attract women it will diminish.

125
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,354
The energy will diminish.

126
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:25,467
When you feel your own dignity and serenity

127
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:32,415
and [realise] that you are now Self-realised people,

128
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:34,899
you are not ordinary people

129
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:40,372
a kind of majestic personality develops within you.

130
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:50,118
That majestic personality really can have a tremendous effect

131
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:53,770
on the surrounding people – tremendous!

132
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:58,891
It’s a kind of a deliberate projection you should start.

133
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:04,947
I don’t know that side, that how to project it

134
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:08,383
or how to deliberately do this.

135
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,618
It’s just spontaneous with me, it just happens.

136
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:15,235
But you can achieve it yourself with [a] little practice.

137
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:27,571
Try to face such people, not with disdain or contempt,

138
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:31,778
but just your majestic personality.

139
00:15:32,793 --> 00:15:36,637
This personality is here now, you see,

140
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:41,277
is sitting in such a majestic manner

141
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:48,563
and is also giving the vibrations to others.

142
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:58,028
The whole figure is doing something suddenly to people.

143
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,157
To expect that the whole world will change spontaneously,

144
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:08,520
I don’t think is alright.

145
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:14,094
Because, you know, the world is so chaotic, full of so much chaos,

146
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:17,621
so much ego, so much conditioning.

147
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:25,438
But something within you can rise above others

148
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:36,020
with your sense of dignity, with your complete Selfhood,

149
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:38,688
where you stand with yourself.

150
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:42,625
You are not to be rude, you are not to be egoistical,

151
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:47,430
you need not say things if you don’t want to say anything.

152
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:55,637
Just that silent personality can emit such beautiful vibrations,

153
00:16:55,886 --> 00:17:00,904
which you have. You have stored up a lot of vibrations within yourself.

154
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:07,673
And this storing up is showing on your faces, which I said are shining.

155
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:11,284
But the innocence that you have,

156
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:17,311
you have to be proud of it, very much proud of it.

157
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:24,533
Even now sometimes you feel that people will say

158
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:28,501
you are not properly dressed up

159
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:32,037
or maybe you are ugly looking or all kinds of things

160
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:35,303
that they expect every other person to be.

161
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:38,497
It’s a funny thing that in this world

162
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:42,006
all human beings expect others to be very good.

163
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,483
Everybody should be a hero or something

164
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:47,334
– what about themselves they never think!

165
00:17:47,494 --> 00:17:50,686
So now you have become heroes in the sense that

166
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:54,749
spiritually you are much higher than all of them.

167
00:17:54,909 --> 00:18:00,366
So this projection, when it starts – I am saying again ‘deliberate’ –

168
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:05,217
then you should not be afraid that, “I will develop my ego.”

169
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,420
You should not be afraid that, “I’ll get some conditionings.”

170
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,038
But just, in the way, with the understanding,

171
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:20,303
that you have these powers within you, beautifully expressing themselves,

172
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:22,432
as a child does.

173
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:28,561
If there is one child, it can entertain at least hundred people.

174
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:32,913
What is so sweet about the child? Is the innocence:

175
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:38,842
the way he speaks, the way he talks, the way he behaves,

176
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:43,389
the way he expresses his love. It’s so simple

177
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:51,994
but it has something in the essence, this innocence of Shri Ganesha.

178
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:57,905
Anywhere there’s a question of children,

179
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:02,049
the whole world get worried about it,

180
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,147
the whole world wants to solve the problem.

181
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:12,483
If a child is in trouble, anywhere all over the world

182
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:16,631
it will be circulated that such and such a thing is happening

183
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:20,874
to such a child and everybody will be worried.

184
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:26,780
If they see a child anywhere, the faces change;

185
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,374
you see the faces, the expression changes, automatically.

186
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:35,901
Because that child is emitting that innocence;

187
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:44,678
without any deliberations, without any special way of doing it,

188
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:47,197
but just spontaneously.

189
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:55,280
But then you grow, you start growing, growing with others

190
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,178
who are also not innocent. You have to meet them.

191
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:02,178
You can’t run away from the society.

192
00:20:02,338 --> 00:20:10,229
You start getting all the rapport with such people

193
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:14,976
who are talking about things

194
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:19,131
– actually, those who are criticising Shri Ganesha.

195
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:23,299
Gradually, your innocence starts dying out

196
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:28,538
and you feel sometimes inferior to all those

197
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:34,542
who are supposed to be very great warriors against innocence.

198
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:43,311
In the sense that – when I was in London

199
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:47,905
I saw they all used to laugh at me because I had this kumkum.

200
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:51,905
But I used to think they don’t know why I am wearing it.

201
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:54,033
So, it’s so ignorant they are:

202
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:57,788
very ignorant people that they don’t know in India

203
00:20:57,948 --> 00:21:00,913
all the married women have to wear this.

204
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:06,397
Even the Muslims wear that; they also wear mangalsutra.

205
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,139
So I said that,

206
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:12,655
“This is just written down, on my head, that I am a married woman.”

207
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:16,108
It’s just to tell people ‘don’t bother me.

208
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:22,518
I have got my husband behind me and he can take you to task.’

209
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:28,452
This kind of ignorance is so much in the West

210
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:33,717
and still they think they are a higher race, they are greater people.

211
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:38,416
They don’t know even small, small things about life.

212
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:42,225
For the innocence, I think

213
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:47,455
they have lost any knowledge about it, long time back.

214
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:53,741
And that’s how it is a society, today,

215
00:21:53,901 --> 00:22:00,186
which has absolutely lost its own moorings.

216
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:02,202
Every individual is separate,

217
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:06,616
every individual is doing something and they don’t know each other.

218
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:12,983
Without innocence you cannot have a rapport with other people.

219
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:17,397
Because that means you have some sort of a lust

220
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:20,842
or greed behind the whole thing.

221
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:26,499
So much so now, it’s become so boring the whole thing,

222
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:32,038
that even once I told this Sahaj Yogi that, if you are going there,

223
00:22:32,198 --> 00:22:35,553
there’s a family and they have a daughter,

224
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:40,557
so just give this present to her – a simple thing!

225
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:46,545
Now this yogi was quite an elderly person, not a young boy.

226
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:50,030
He said, “Mother, I’d better not go.” I said, “Why?”

227
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,920
“Because they will misunderstand me.”

228
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,764
“What will they misunderstand?”

229
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:58,991
“Why am I giving a present to this girl?”

230
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:01,827
I said, “But it’s I am giving. What is the harm?”

231
00:23:01,987 --> 00:23:05,553
“No!” That’s the psychology. He was himself a psychologist.

232
00:23:05,713 --> 00:23:10,092
That’s the psychology. “So I cannot take this present for that girl!”

233
00:23:10,252 --> 00:23:14,991
I mean, I was [amazed]: for Indians, you don’t understand this kind of a fear.

234
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:17,553
But then I noticed it’s too much

235
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:21,616
that they don’t want to be with any woman,

236
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,764
they don’t want to be alone with any woman.

237
00:23:24,924 --> 00:23:28,584
And they said Mother, “You don’t know these women!

238
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:32,053
They will make a rape case out of us!” “But how?”

239
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:41,725
“They do!” So the whole idea is to challenge the innocence of people.

240
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:49,268
For that, I must say, they made this Freud into a god

241
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:54,420
because of his writings. I don’t know how they accept, also, such writings.

242
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,647
I just can’t understand how they accept.

243
00:23:56,807 --> 00:24:02,377
Because I think they have no idea as to what they are.

244
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,397
Somebody asked me about Freud, “Then what did he say?

245
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:11,053
Why are people so much against him? Why are you so against?”

246
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:15,811
I said, “He said that there’s a bad relationship between the mother and the son.”

247
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:21,639
He just jumped. “He said so? My goodness! Thank God he never came to India,

248
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:27,069
otherwise we would have cut him into pieces and put them in the Indian Sea!”

249
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:32,299
I said, “But why spoil the purity of Indian Sea also?”

250
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:37,223
He was so annoyed and angry, he said,

251
00:24:37,383 --> 00:24:39,552
“How could they tolerate such a nonsense?

252
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:43,006
How could they accept such nonsense against the mother?

253
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:47,452
They have no purity?” I said, “That’s the trouble with them.”

254
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:50,642
Now the trouble is that the brain developed too much,

255
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:55,517
ego developed too much and any such stupid idea

256
00:24:55,969 --> 00:25:01,143
– it’s much worse than stupid – was accepted.

257
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:05,311
And that is how I find it’s so boring:

258
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:13,564
every time anywhere you go it’s nothing but this sex business.

259
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:17,631
It’s too much. I can’t understand how people go on tolerating.

260
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:23,644
It’s alright, at the most, in some adult films you might show some nonsense,

261
00:25:23,804 --> 00:25:27,608
but every time you see something you find

262
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:32,272
suddenly this kind of nonsensical scene is coming,

263
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:35,999
this bedroom scenes, these scenes, and people like it.

264
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:43,307
They pay for it. They want to have all aspects of it.

265
00:25:44,557 --> 00:25:49,585
It is such a natural thing. What is there to talk about it all the time?

266
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:51,749
I don’t understand.

267
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:55,991
It’s only the development of the brain, of such a manner,

268
00:25:56,151 --> 00:25:59,436
that every kind of nonsense it wants to accept.

269
00:25:59,596 --> 00:26:01,616
“So what? What’s wrong?”

270
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:05,561
“Well, you’re mad! That’s what. You go to lunatic asylum.”

271
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:09,366
Lunatics also talk like that. “So what’s wrong?”

272
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:14,795
Same way. Because of such acceptance, they don’t know how much

273
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:19,881
people have ruined their family life, their children’s life.

274
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:26,186
In every way, we find that the whole society is full of this nonsense

275
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:31,147
and specially in the television – Italy specially.

276
00:26:31,307 --> 00:26:36,745
I mean, certain buttons you should not press,

277
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,405
you should be very careful,

278
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:42,341
otherwise you don’t know what you face and you go for vomiting.

279
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:46,651
You see, as Indians – first reaction is to vomit.

280
00:26:48,127 --> 00:26:56,694
But for people who have not yet realized the value of this innocence

281
00:26:56,854 --> 00:27:03,081
can be easily taken up by this kind of nonsense that’s going on.

282
00:27:05,612 --> 00:27:09,874
Whatever it is, through the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

283
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:17,268
you are all transformed. You are on a different line.

284
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:23,420
Yesterday these two musicians were surprised how you were praising Ganesha.

285
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,506
They couldn’t believe it, how you could praise Shri Ganesh,

286
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:32,030
because you haven’t even heard the name of Shri Ganesha before

287
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,928
I said, “They see what Shri Ganesha has done to them,

288
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:42,084
how He has made their attention so beautiful

289
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:46,420
that they enjoy all the beautiful things of the world,

290
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,916
all the innocent things of the world.”

291
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:54,975
And there are many people like them, I can tell you, who are struggling.

292
00:27:55,135 --> 00:27:58,335
Not that all the society has accepted this nonsense.

293
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:00,061
There are many who are struggling

294
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:05,538
because I know in England they published a book about what children have to say

295
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:09,587
about the politicians: very sweet, sweet things, very sweet.

296
00:28:09,746 --> 00:28:13,294
And those books [that] were published were five thousand books because

297
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:16,741
if you publish five thousand, you get it cheaper or something like that.

298
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:21,479
And in one day all the books were sold out – in one day.

299
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:27,374
That shows that there are so many people still

300
00:28:27,534 --> 00:28:33,069
who are respecting their innocence and they want to be innocent

301
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:34,828
and they want to enjoy it.

302
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:38,327
But a society has to be created of that kind.

303
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:43,717
For that, you must have a kind of a personality.

304
00:28:43,877 --> 00:28:51,088
You know that I was in London and once I went to Greece.

305
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,305
And the ministers’ wives also came to meet me.

306
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:57,372
I was surprised. Normally they don’t do. So they said,

307
00:28:57,532 --> 00:29:02,460
“You see, our husbands told us if you want to see serenity personified,

308
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,401
then you must see Mrs. Shrivastava.”

309
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:11,186
I was surprised [that] in Greece they are talking of serenity!

310
00:29:11,346 --> 00:29:15,905
In these modern times anybody talking about purity!

311
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:19,780
I just couldn’t understand, but I felt at the back of their mind

312
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:26,499
their tradition, whatever it is, these men could see

313
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:30,319
that simple thing in me and they went and told them.

314
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,691
And they all enjoyed my company very much.

315
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:35,936
I was making them laugh and telling them things and all that.

316
00:29:36,096 --> 00:29:38,452
And one of them then turned around and said,

317
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:42,053
“Mrs. Shrivastava, you are just like a child!” “I said, “Really?”

318
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,295
“No, we enjoyed your company so much!”

319
00:29:44,455 --> 00:29:47,124
And when I was coming, they were in tears.

320
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:52,413
So what I am saying that: whatever innocent personality you have,

321
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:56,249
you have to project now, to project towards others.

322
00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:00,147
Say somebody is trying to be funny with you

323
00:30:00,307 --> 00:30:03,139
just with one glance you can put that person right,

324
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:08,639
that you don’t like it. Just to say you don’t like it.

325
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,940
In a way that’s a projection.

326
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:16,827
Around your society, around where you are working,

327
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:22,131
you will also find people who have no sense of innocence.

328
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:25,460
And it’s disgusting to be with them.

329
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,295
But as you have powers, you must use [them] – is to project.

330
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:35,139
I see with Sahaja Yogis, they don’t even cure people.

331
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:39,295
They’ll tell me, “Mother, he is to be cured. That is to be done.”

332
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:42,561
But you are so many, why do you need me to do that now?

333
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:46,506
You all can cure a patient. You can help the patient.

334
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:51,022
Why can’t you do it? What is the need for me to do it?

335
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,788
You have those qualities within you

336
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:58,264
because potentially you had them before

337
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:02,663
and now they are enlightened through the grace of Shri Ganesha.

338
00:31:02,823 --> 00:31:06,792
Now, what you have to do is to assert them.

339
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:14,186
In that, of course, you must remember not to use your ego,

340
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:18,436
not to use your mind. So somebody would say that,

341
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:23,256
“Mother, without mind how can you impress others?

342
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:26,991
How can you have a rapport with others?” It’s very simple.

343
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:30,827
Just go thoughtless. Once you are thoughtless,

344
00:31:30,987 --> 00:31:36,811
you are in the Realm of the Divine, and then the Divine takes charge.

345
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:40,592
And it will start emitting such beautiful vibrations

346
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:45,788
that you will be amazed at yourself how things are working out.

347
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:49,417
It is not a coincidence we should say.

348
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:55,342
Like once I was going somewhere and they told me that,

349
00:31:55,502 --> 00:31:58,928
“You have to be very careful!” I said, “Why?”

350
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:02,631
“Because in the night, you see, these Naxalites (Indian communists) are here

351
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:05,895
and they might just kill you.” I said, “It’s alright!”

352
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:09,635
He said, “No, it’s very late. You be careful!”

353
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,787
So, the gentleman with me was very much worried.

354
00:32:13,947 --> 00:32:16,249
He said, “You take out your ornaments, everything.”

355
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:19,550
He put them under the seat and did all that.

356
00:32:20,776 --> 00:32:26,545
So, as soon as we reached that place where many Naxalites were standing

357
00:32:26,705 --> 00:32:30,478
with their lanterns and with their sticks,

358
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:35,936
so I told the driver that, “For one minute you stop the car.”

359
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,660
He said, “No, I will not!” “No, you stop!”

360
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,530
I looked at them and I don’t know what happened – they just moved on.

361
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,545
I said, “Now speed up the car.”

362
00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:48,991
You see, it is the power that you have.

363
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:53,971
Unless and until you use this power of love and compassion,

364
00:32:54,268 --> 00:33:01,541
you will not know what you have got. And that comes from your Shri Ganesh.

365
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:05,479
You see, how children understand love.

366
00:33:05,814 --> 00:33:11,392
If you are nice to them, how they react. Maybe sometimes they do not,

367
00:33:11,552 --> 00:33:17,330
but ninety-nine percent [of] children, I have seen, they really react to love.

368
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:22,569
In our school in Dharamsala there were two children

369
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:27,280
and they were very troublesome to begin with

370
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,227
and the parents were worried about them.

371
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:32,729
They sent them to Dharamsala

372
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,764
and otherwise they were very demanding as the modern children are.

373
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:41,436
“You buy this. You buy that. Go here. We want MacDonald!”

374
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:46,147
This, that was going on. When they went to the school for one year,

375
00:33:46,307 --> 00:33:49,124
they came back and the parents asked them,

376
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:52,062
“Now, what do you want?” They said, “We don’t want anything!”

377
00:33:52,222 --> 00:33:55,212
“You don’t want anything? You want to go to MacDonald’s?”

378
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:58,233
They were American. “No, no, we don’t want to go to MacDonald.

379
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:04,276
We want to sit here and watch Mother’s videos.”

380
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:08,274
They said, “Suddenly, what has happened to them? They were so troublesome.

381
00:34:08,434 --> 00:34:13,139
Why are they now so much changed? What’s the matter with them?”

382
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:16,670
So then they said, “What about food? Whatever you cook, we’ll eat.

383
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,038
We are not bothered.”

384
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:21,077
And they were amazed how these children had changed!

385
00:34:21,237 --> 00:34:23,499
But then they said, “We must go out somewhere.

386
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,210
We must see the river, we must see the mountain.”

387
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,249
“Alright, that we’ll do.” Then again they came home

388
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:34,374
– no demands, nothing. They didn’t want to go for any shopping

389
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:38,367
or asking for any shirts or blouse or nothing.

390
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:43,675
Very much satisfied, dignified.

391
00:34:44,612 --> 00:34:49,062
So they said, “What’s the matter with you? You don’t want anything?”

392
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:51,983
“No we want something but we don’t know how to tell you.”

393
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:54,885
“What is it?” “Because you don’t have that.

394
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:57,668
You can’t get it in the market.” “Well, what is it?”

395
00:34:57,828 --> 00:35:02,397
They said, “Can you get us a pendant of Shri Mataji?”

396
00:35:02,557 --> 00:35:06,034
So sweetly, you know, they said. That’s all.

397
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:08,944
But they said, “You don’t have?” “No, we don’t have any.”

398
00:35:09,104 --> 00:35:12,726
“So you just get us the pendant of Shri Mataji, that’s all.”

399
00:35:12,886 --> 00:35:20,696
I mean so deep expression. You don’t want anything else.

400
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:24,405
I mean, I know the children, I have met them,

401
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:26,765
but I have not been with them for a long time,

402
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,275
I have never been so close to them, nothing,

403
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:33,753
but look at the love that they have.

404
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:37,265
And they were telling me in the school in the beginning

405
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:40,343
that anybody goes to trouble us, we said,

406
00:35:40,503 --> 00:35:42,554
“Now we are going to inform Shri Mataji!”

407
00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:45,796
“No, no, no, don’t inform Her.” “Why?”

408
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:50,366
“Because She will not love me any more!” Can you imagine?

409
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:57,140
The value of my love is so much understood by these little, little children

410
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:03,437
and so much they admire, they want it.

411
00:36:03,597 --> 00:36:09,522
It has no material gain by that, nothing.

412
00:36:09,682 --> 00:36:14,500
All this really shows that Christ as He has said it, that,

413
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,627
“You have to be like small children to enter into the Kingdom of God.”

414
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:22,116
Without that, you cannot enjoy anything.

415
00:36:22,276 --> 00:36:26,280
Like yesterday’s programme was really, I must say

416
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,129
– these Swiss have worked very hard.

417
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:31,101
They are very hard working I know, but not to this extent

418
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:36,972
that they started singing Indian music so well in such a combination

419
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:41,358
and we enjoyed all that very much.

420
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:48,034
Now imagine these Swiss who are overactive, always working,

421
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:54,999
they have no time to think about creating something innocent,

422
00:36:55,159 --> 00:37:00,011
creating something sweet of this kind.

423
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:05,116
And the way they did it shows, really, that they love Shri Ganesha

424
00:37:05,276 --> 00:37:12,288
and they understand the value of Shri Ganesha’s manifestation in them.

425
00:37:12,448 --> 00:37:17,226
I was really surprised how they could learn all this Indian music

426
00:37:17,386 --> 00:37:20,811
and so many sitting together and singing that song.

427
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:24,015
And there were some Indians, I said, “Can you sing like this?”

428
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,733
They said, “No.” I said, “Look at these Swiss.”

429
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:31,022
This is the power of Shri Ganesha’s love.

430
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:36,046
Because they were to celebrate Shri Ganesha’s birthday,

431
00:37:36,206 --> 00:37:40,601
so they got equipped from within.

432
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:45,327
But if they had not projected it there would have been nothing.

433
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:49,210
So whatever He is giving you, whatever He is creating in you,

434
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:56,694
this beautiful innocence, this beautiful fragrance of your living,

435
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:59,624
every moment, when you are enjoying it,

436
00:37:59,784 --> 00:38:02,874
also know that we have to give it to others.

437
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:07,397
We have to pour this into others.

438
00:38:07,557 --> 00:38:10,882
And it will work out, I know it will work out.

439
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:14,835
It is so tremendous. His powers are so tremendous.

440
00:38:14,995 --> 00:38:20,163
Yesterday you saw that in the children’s program

441
00:38:20,323 --> 00:38:25,108
that nobody could beat him, even Shiva, anyone.

442
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:29,374
And Shiva had to cut His head

443
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:34,022
because He didn’t know how to overpower Him otherwise.

444
00:38:34,182 --> 00:38:40,044
This is what we have to understand, that if you are innocent,

445
00:38:40,204 --> 00:38:44,226
nobody can cheat us, nobody can trouble us,

446
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:48,835
because in innocence you become a person

447
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:52,405
who doesn’t care for what is happening to you.

448
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:56,703
You become a person who tolerates everything thinking these are…

449
00:38:56,863 --> 00:39:02,472
you don’t even think, you feel they are something, stupid people, that’s all.

450
00:39:03,276 --> 00:39:09,085
It is a story about a king in China, as I am going to China.

451
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:10,655
There was a king in China.

452
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,476
They are very wise people, I must say Chinese are extremely wise.

453
00:39:14,636 --> 00:39:24,976
And he decided to win a cocks’ fight. It’s a cocks’ fight.

454
00:39:25,136 --> 00:39:29,409
Imagine the king thinking like that! But it’s all child’s play.

455
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:33,366
So he went to one great saint and told him that,

456
00:39:33,526 --> 00:39:38,499
“How will you train a cock to fight the other cocks?”

457
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:40,601
He said, “Leave the cock with me.”

458
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:46,640
So he left the cock there and he trained him very well

459
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,392
because when the king arrived after one month before the fight,

460
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,228
he said, “See now, take this cock it’s your one.”

461
00:39:54,388 --> 00:39:58,228
He said, “This one? This one is not doing anything, just standing straight.

462
00:39:58,388 --> 00:40:01,962
He said, “Yes, yes. That’s it. You take it.”

463
00:40:02,122 --> 00:40:10,067
So he took that cock and put him in that contest.

464
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:13,505
So all the cocks were together.

465
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:18,251
They started troubling this cock, which was just standing like this as if,

466
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:21,634
“Some stupid people are trying to trouble me.”

467
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,864
He wouldn’t touch them, he wouldn’t react, nothing of the kind,

468
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:27,126
he was just standing straight.

469
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:31,790
So all the cocks were surprised that, “This one is not protesting.

470
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:37,111
He’s just bearing up everything and he’s not bothered as to what we are doing.”

471
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:41,439
One by one all the cocks disappeared from the field

472
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,118
where they were having these fights.

473
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:49,591
And this was the only cock which stood up.

474
00:40:49,763 --> 00:40:55,454
So the king was surprised. He took him to the saint and he said,

475
00:40:55,614 --> 00:41:00,126
“This one has become a saint now. So it’s better you keep it with you!”

476
00:41:00,286 --> 00:41:04,492
He’s such a saint that they were all trying to trouble him and he was least bothered.

477
00:41:04,653 --> 00:41:07,877
He was looking like this, left side, right side, both sides.

478
00:41:08,037 --> 00:41:12,337
He thought, “What’s going on with these people? Why are they behaving like this?”

479
00:41:12,497 --> 00:41:17,079
So this is what I have to tell you that your personality itself

480
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:22,841
is made like that and now you worship Him so much [that] He’s within you.

481
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:32,435
And any kind of problems that you have will be really solved very easily

482
00:41:32,595 --> 00:41:35,658
if you take to your innocence.

483
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:40,982
And that will create coincidences, as they call it.

484
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:46,525
But I would say it’s not coincidence, it’s the vibrations.

485
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,489
And you’ll be amazed how things are solved.

486
00:41:50,649 --> 00:41:52,888
They’ll say, “Mother, this had happened, that had happened.”

487
00:41:53,048 --> 00:41:55,747
Now see, the other day, it rained so much.

488
00:41:55,907 --> 00:41:58,021
It rained so much so that they said,

489
00:41:58,181 --> 00:42:03,075
“It has become knee-deep mud here and Mother what are we to do?”

490
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:05,472
I said, “It’s alright. Leave it to Him.”

491
00:42:05,632 --> 00:42:11,106
Next day it was very hot. Imagine underneath these things,

492
00:42:11,266 --> 00:42:17,306
the whole thing got dried out and today you are here for the puja.

493
00:42:17,837 --> 00:42:24,833
It’s an impossible thing that there could be such a change in the weather

494
00:42:24,993 --> 00:42:30,126
that one day it rains so heavily and second day

495
00:42:30,368 --> 00:42:34,138
the whole thing gets absolutely dried out.

496
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:39,661
It’s His work, because He’s so much powerful.

497
00:42:39,821 --> 00:42:45,744
You have come to worship Him, so first of all cleansing has to be done

498
00:42:45,904 --> 00:42:50,988
and He did the cleansing by putting the rain here.

499
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:56,036
It’s so heavy rains and some of the part of the rains

500
00:42:56,196 --> 00:43:09,791
which came near this Palazzo Dorio they turned into ice (hail).

501
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,285
I don’t know what is English word is [for] that.

502
00:43:12,445 --> 00:43:17,442
So they all started and the whole thing went round the house.

503
00:43:17,602 --> 00:43:24,185
They were all forming into little, little ice-balls, falling nearby.

504
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:30,456
Now it is something unbelievable that all over it has just rained

505
00:43:30,616 --> 00:43:34,198
only near our house it is the ice-balls are coming.

506
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:37,995
We can call it ‘miracles’, we can call it anything,

507
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:42,987
but it is Shri Ganesha’s, we should say, sensitivity

508
00:43:43,147 --> 00:43:47,471
that He thought that, “Now this rain is going near my Mother’s house,

509
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:52,745
so let us make some sort of a beautiful ice-balls.”

510
00:43:52,905 --> 00:43:56,034
And I went out and I saw, and I was amazed

511
00:43:56,194 --> 00:44:00,643
how it was all around my house [that] there were ice-balls.

512
00:44:00,803 --> 00:44:08,350
What He can do, what he’s capable is absolutely unbelievable.

513
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:12,102
How He guides you and how He helps you.

514
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:14,507
How He takes you to [the] right path.

515
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:17,116
Not only that [but] how He protects you.

516
00:44:17,276 --> 00:44:22,491
All the time He is with you because you have become His ganas now.

517
00:44:22,651 --> 00:44:27,085
You are His ganas, so He protects you, looks after you,

518
00:44:27,245 --> 00:44:32,210
gives you all the guidance. He takes you to the right path.

519
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:36,577
He takes you to the righteous road.

520
00:44:36,737 --> 00:44:40,772
He gives you all that is dharmic to enjoy.

521
00:44:40,932 --> 00:44:43,483
You always meet friends here and there.

522
00:44:43,643 --> 00:44:45,897
You think it’s a coincidence – it is not.

523
00:44:46,057 --> 00:44:48,499
And that is how He works.

524
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:58,233
He works with all His beautiful, sweet, loving attention on you

525
00:44:58,393 --> 00:45:00,874
because you are His ganas.

526
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:03,917
But the ganas have to work!

527
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:10,658
As I say that, in our body there are ganas

528
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:19,303
and they fight the disease, they fight the problems that are in the body

529
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:25,413
those antibodies which are the ganas of Shri Ganesha.

530
00:45:25,573 --> 00:45:28,483
In the same way, you are also His ganas.

531
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,944
He does all this for you. He protects you, He loves you,

532
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,018
He gives you all the good time.

533
00:45:35,963 --> 00:45:38,382
Then what are we doing about it?

534
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:43,710
It should not be one-sided. When He does all this for you

535
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:47,472
then what should we do about Shri Ganesh?

536
00:45:48,034 --> 00:45:51,897
What can we do as antibodies?

537
00:45:52,057 --> 00:46:03,809
You don’t have to fight the enemies with any sword or any kind of a weapon.

538
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:10,832
The enemies you can conquer by simple, two, methods.

539
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:17,454
One is try your love, your pure love on them. Try that.

540
00:46:17,614 --> 00:46:20,040
You may melt away many people.

541
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:27,212
Or else, if that is not working, then what should you do

542
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:32,024
is to sit down and meditate and give bandhans.

543
00:46:32,184 --> 00:46:35,780
There are ways of giving bandhans. The bandhan works so fast

544
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:40,639
and so beautifully that you are amazed how it has worked!

545
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,498
Because you are so powerful.

546
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:46,750
The way you give bandhan, [if] anybody else can give

547
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:52,188
it is not going to work! It’s only you, the Sahaj Yogis, can give bandhan.

548
00:46:52,348 --> 00:46:55,618
There are different types of bandhans you have to give.

549
00:46:55,778 --> 00:46:59,782
And all that works out so well.

550
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:03,462
So we have to have now faith in our own powers

551
00:47:03,622 --> 00:47:09,478
and we have to know that we are now empowered by Shri Ganesha

552
00:47:09,638 --> 00:47:12,661
to do the work of Sahaja Yoga.

553
00:47:12,918 --> 00:47:17,806
To do the work of Sahaja Yoga is not to feel that you are doing it,

554
00:47:17,966 --> 00:47:20,966
but it is Shri Ganesh who is doing it.

555
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:25,767
You will be surprised – giving Realisations to people

556
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:29,591
is the greatest joy Sahaja Yogis can have.

557
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:34,220
And then you don’t have to think that you have done it

558
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,759
– then is the best – but if you think you have done it then,

559
00:47:37,919 --> 00:47:40,556
“I am very tired,” or “I have done this!”

560
00:47:40,716 --> 00:47:45,431
Many people come and tell me, “Mother, we have done this, we have done that!”

561
00:47:45,591 --> 00:47:50,795
That means they are just feeling the strain of doing any work.

562
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:55,103
But you are not to feel any strain.

563
00:47:55,263 --> 00:47:59,509
His powers are within you, you can see it. Believe me!

564
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:02,439
Believe in yourself. Have confidence in yourself

565
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,884
– confidence and faith in yourself.

566
00:48:05,044 --> 00:48:10,001
And [know] that you are a storehouse of innocence

567
00:48:10,161 --> 00:48:13,895
which is nothing but compassion and love.

568
00:48:15,098 --> 00:48:16,978
If you have that faith

569
00:48:17,138 --> 00:48:22,474
you will definitely develop a beautiful way of talking to others,

570
00:48:24,012 --> 00:48:32,052
of having [a] relationship with others.

571
00:48:33,716 --> 00:48:41,200
It is something that is really a gift of Shri Ganesh.

572
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:45,731
I don’t think I every shouted at anyone.

573
00:48:46,903 --> 00:48:50,595
Even on my children, I have never shouted, never.

574
00:48:50,755 --> 00:48:53,978
I have never got into a fury or a temper

575
00:48:54,138 --> 00:48:56,321
because I think I can manage without it.

576
00:48:56,481 --> 00:49:00,345
Of course, I had to correct, I had to tell people.

577
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:05,423
But one thing I have seen [is] that everybody has been afraid of one thing

578
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:10,009
– that somehow I should never drive out somebody from Sahaja Yoga,

579
00:49:10,169 --> 00:49:12,931
because Sahaja Yoga is such a joy,

580
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:16,274
it is such an energy-giving thing,

581
00:49:16,434 --> 00:49:25,934
it is such a light that you feel absolutely confident about yourself.

582
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:29,962
So to ask you to leave Sahaja Yoga

583
00:49:30,122 --> 00:49:36,212
is the greatest punishment because you can’t leave me now.

584
00:49:36,372 --> 00:49:40,993
It’s difficult. You just can’t leave me! It’s impossible!

585
00:49:41,153 --> 00:49:45,079
And that is what it is that you also develop those qualities

586
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:47,106
that you can’t leave.

587
00:49:47,763 --> 00:49:53,353
See, a child, if it is lost, I mean, the parents just go off,

588
00:49:53,513 --> 00:49:55,536
they don’t know how the child is lost.

589
00:49:55,696 --> 00:50:01,971
But supposing, some son of theirs is a very bad boy,

590
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:07,407
is misbehaving, is doing all kinds of wrong things, they don’t mind.

591
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:10,259
But when they are young, they are innocent

592
00:50:10,419 --> 00:50:14,907
it’s some sort of a tremendous attachment to them

593
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:20,446
and understanding that “They are our children, we have to look after them.”

594
00:50:20,606 --> 00:50:24,626
So [it’s] this innocence that attracts you,

595
00:50:24,786 --> 00:50:31,266
that keeps you wondering about your children, about other children.

596
00:50:31,426 --> 00:50:35,844
And I was very happy the way you gave a present to Guido

597
00:50:36,004 --> 00:50:39,673
because he’s doing a very difficult task, I must say.

598
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:45,798
And this appreciation shows that to you it’s very valuable

599
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:48,993
that your children are looked after.

600
00:50:49,153 --> 00:50:52,368
But you are also a child of your Mother.

601
00:50:52,528 --> 00:50:56,884
As a result, you have all these powers within yourself.

602
00:50:57,044 --> 00:51:03,274
But you must know how to smile. You must know how to win over people.

603
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:06,876
Still there are some Sahaj Yogis and some Sahaj Yoginis

604
00:51:07,036 --> 00:51:11,837
who are still rather stiff! I find them little stiff type

605
00:51:11,997 --> 00:51:13,860
and they can’t give up their stiffness.

606
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,376
Maybe they think no end of themselves or whatever it is.

607
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:19,391
Then they will not enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

608
00:51:19,552 --> 00:51:23,035
Of course, mentally of course they understand Sahaj Yog and all that

609
00:51:23,196 --> 00:51:31,598
but they cannot enjoy fully Sahaj Yoga and all its mirth, its joyous moments.

610
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,509
Today is to celebrate His birth

611
00:51:36,669 --> 00:51:42,095
and He was the first God that was created on this Earth;

612
00:51:42,255 --> 00:51:48,122
because he’s also auspiciousness, he’s also Holiness.

613
00:51:48,778 --> 00:51:53,556
So the Primordial Mother didn’t want to create this world

614
00:51:53,716 --> 00:52:00,185
without first creating the holiness, the auspiciousness, the purity.

615
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:04,099
And that’s why He was first created.

616
00:52:04,849 --> 00:52:09,962
Created on this Earth with vibrations, just [a] bundle of vibrations:

617
00:52:10,122 --> 00:52:13,513
so that He can look after all the people

618
00:52:13,927 --> 00:52:21,552
who are going to come from ages to ages,

619
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:26,537
to guide them always on the right path.

620
00:52:26,723 --> 00:52:31,478
So He is supposed to be in charge of our conscience,

621
00:52:31,638 --> 00:52:35,806
the conscience that eats you up sometimes, that says,

622
00:52:35,966 --> 00:52:38,517
“This is not alright. This I should not have done.

623
00:52:38,677 --> 00:52:40,626
That I should have not done.”

624
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:46,118
But one should try to take very great pride in it.

625
00:52:46,278 --> 00:52:49,462
Like there was one gentleman, an Indian

626
00:52:49,622 --> 00:52:52,954
– Indians can be exceptionally innocent sometimes, exceptionally,

627
00:52:53,114 --> 00:52:56,884
you can’t understand them! So I told him,

628
00:52:57,044 --> 00:53:00,743
“Why did you give up your land?”

629
00:53:00,903 --> 00:53:04,954
He said, “Mother, I thought that later on, when my children will grow,

630
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:09,436
I might become greedy and I may not give this land to my brother,

631
00:53:09,596 --> 00:53:13,619
who deserves it because I’m too clever, I can cheat him.

632
00:53:13,779 --> 00:53:15,696
So I thought it’s better to give up.

633
00:53:15,856 --> 00:53:18,267
So I gave up the land to my brother.”

634
00:53:18,427 --> 00:53:22,622
And he so innocently was telling me that,

635
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:28,829
“I should not become greedy because maybe that my children will grow up

636
00:53:28,989 --> 00:53:31,931
and I will feel that I must give all this to my children,

637
00:53:32,091 --> 00:53:36,329
so I decided to give up the land just now to my own brother.”

638
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:38,335
But I said, “What about your brother?”

639
00:53:38,496 --> 00:53:41,981
He said, “He deserves, he needs. I don’t need so much land.

640
00:53:42,141 --> 00:53:45,071
I am doing very well in life. That’s why I have given.”

641
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:49,454
“But legally?” “Legally,” he said, “it was not in his name,

642
00:53:49,614 --> 00:53:52,610
but I thought it’s better that I give it to him now.

643
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,439
Later on I might become a bad man.”

644
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,250
So the innocence works out in such a manner.

645
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,962
And very sweet, sweet stories I have got to tell you.

646
00:54:02,122 --> 00:54:06,680
There’s one Sahaj Yogi who was a little boy, say about sixteen years of old,

647
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,189
he came to me and he said, “My mother has some badhas and the father, too.

648
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:12,767
I don’t know what to do.

649
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:16,103
Now supposing I leave my father and mother,

650
00:54:16,263 --> 00:54:22,076
then will the badhas also leave me?” I said, “Maybe. May not be. Depends on…”

651
00:54:22,669 --> 00:54:25,540
“Then what is the need for people to leave their parents

652
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:29,704
when they are eighteen years of age? Why do people leave their parents

653
00:54:29,864 --> 00:54:34,009
at the eighteen years of age? Because, you see, it will be a big loss.”

654
00:54:34,169 --> 00:54:40,024
I said, “Why?” “Firstly, if I start smoking who will stop me?”

655
00:54:40,184 --> 00:54:43,720
Such an innocent thing. “If I start smoking,

656
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,087
only my father can slap me on the face, nobody else.

657
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:50,931
So he can save me from the smoking.”

658
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:55,454
I was amazed at his innocence, the way he was saying that,

659
00:54:55,614 --> 00:54:58,329
“I want my father to be there to slap me.”

660
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:01,884
And then he said, “And then my mother, she’s the one

661
00:55:02,044 --> 00:55:06,540
who corrects me every point; so if she goes away, if I am not with her,

662
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:11,165
who will correct me? Who will tell me don’t do this and don’t do that?”

663
00:55:11,325 --> 00:55:15,782
I never understood that, look at this boy of sixteen years

664
00:55:15,942 --> 00:55:20,039
– he’s an Indian – telling me that his parents’ utility is

665
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:25,427
that they are the only people who can stop him from doing wrong things!

666
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:30,970
Because he was a born-realised and he could see that,

667
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:35,759
“if I try to do something wrong it’s only my parents can tell me.”

668
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:41,392
So this innocence always seeks [a] virtuous life,

669
00:55:41,552 --> 00:55:47,110
this better life and it doesn’t assert on others.

670
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:50,931
But it’s, somehow or other, when there is innocence

671
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:54,079
– just like you people are now Self-realised people –

672
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,595
in the light of your Self, you don’t want to do something

673
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:03,056
that is not innocent, that is not simple.

674
00:56:03,216 --> 00:56:06,040
For example, I have never seen such honest people

675
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,860
as we have in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely honest, I mean,

676
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:13,642
they don’t want to take even a single pie (1/192 Rupee) out of things.

677
00:56:13,802 --> 00:56:16,673
Of course, there have been some horrible people, also,

678
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:19,595
who made lots of money out of Sahaj Yog, doesn’t matter;

679
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:23,345
but most of you have become so honest.

680
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,204
I mean there’s so much corruption in this world

681
00:56:26,364 --> 00:56:30,216
and to see people who are so honest.

682
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:34,162
Now the greatest quality, as you know, of Shri Ganesha’s

683
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:39,040
I was told yesterday, that for them their Mother is the most important.

684
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:44,997
What Mother says and what Mother does, that’s the most important thing.

685
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:50,821
I mean, it is so much that I really can’t understand

686
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:55,387
how you people are so much fond of me.

687
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:06,970
Because I think that, whatever you think about me mentally

688
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:10,173
is nothing compared to what you have within yourself

689
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:13,704
and that is Shri Ganesha’s, again, the quality.

690
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:15,860
Because He’s so attached to me

691
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,767
that he will fight his Father, he will fight everybody.

692
00:57:19,927 --> 00:57:21,689
That’s what you are.

693
00:57:21,849 --> 00:57:24,032
Anything against me, you cannot tolerate,

694
00:57:24,192 --> 00:57:28,048
anything wrong said against me you cannot follow.

695
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:32,899
I have seen people getting furious if somebody said a word against me.

696
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:39,665
So this quality of love for me is coming from Shri Ganesha within you.

697
00:57:39,825 --> 00:57:42,774
But the another quality, as I said, is that

698
00:57:42,934 --> 00:57:47,696
He makes the ganas work and so you have to work it out.

699
00:57:47,856 --> 00:57:53,423
Yesterday’s thing has shown me how this collectivity

700
00:57:53,583 --> 00:58:00,220
of Switzerland has come up so well, so well.

701
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:07,774
And it was really showing how we can progress. You all have talents.

702
00:58:07,934 --> 00:58:11,249
Not that only Swiss have. You all have talents.

703
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:14,939
You all have understanding. You are all intelligent.

704
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:20,353
All of you are special people and you have to work out in collective way

705
00:58:20,513 --> 00:58:25,548
and also individual way to show your quality of Shri Ganesh,

706
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,954
the way He has the rhythm within Him.

707
00:58:28,114 --> 00:58:31,845
He’s very rhythmic and yesterday those two big musicians sitting,

708
00:58:32,005 --> 00:58:37,743
he said, “Mother, they are so rhythmically clapping, they are rhythmic.

709
00:58:37,903 --> 00:58:41,790
There’s no, ‘ha, ha, hoo, hoo,’ just clapping and so rhythmic.

710
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,071
Nobody makes a mistake.”

711
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:47,634
Then they said, “When they sing also, nobody’s out of tune.”

712
00:58:47,794 --> 00:58:52,126
Normally, if ten people are singing, without proper training,

713
00:58:52,286 --> 00:58:56,286
then this are in alto, tenor, bass, everything, they go on.

714
00:58:56,447 --> 00:59:00,564
And you don’t know on what swar (note) they have taken, on what note they are singing.

715
00:59:00,724 --> 00:59:05,720
But they were yesterday very amazed that all of you were singing on the same note;

716
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,759
you wouldn’t leave the note and come onto another note.

717
00:59:09,919 --> 00:59:14,345
That shows that the rhythm of Shri Ganesha is working in you

718
00:59:14,505 --> 00:59:22,048
and His understanding of music, which is one of His qualities is:

719
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:33,536
that He dances on the music of which Nataraja, the Father Shiva has taught Him.

720
00:59:34,302 --> 00:59:38,774
It’s very rhythmic. That part, I think, a little bit, Sahaja Yogis are missing:

721
00:59:38,934 --> 00:59:43,634
that when they dance they need not be, all of them, in [a] very rhythmic pattern.

722
00:59:43,794 --> 00:59:47,345
They’re alright, but still one has to learn [a] little more

723
00:59:47,505 --> 00:59:49,930
rhythmic pattern, would be a good idea.

724
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:53,399
As the Shri Ganesha, which is such a big stomach that He has,

725
00:59:53,559 --> 01:00:00,306
He dances so well, so lightly He lifts his body and the way He works it out, it’s amazing.

726
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:06,212
How does He do it with such a…and a short person with such thick legs?

727
01:00:06,372 --> 01:00:13,853
He is very light and the lightness comes because of innocence – Mooladhar.

728
01:00:14,013 --> 01:00:18,759
If the Mooladhara is alright, then lightness is there.

729
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:26,493
You have seen in Maharashtra how these people were playing the Lezim (dance)

730
01:00:26,653 --> 01:00:33,204
with such speed and with such lightness:

731
01:00:33,364 --> 01:00:35,790
they were lifting their legs and hand.

732
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:41,325
It was really amazing how they were doing it.

733
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:47,532
And it is only the innocence of these people of the villages

734
01:00:47,692 --> 01:00:51,610
that they don’t understand much of this nonsense.

735
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:55,524
They don’t know what is going on with all these things.

736
01:00:55,684 --> 01:00:58,399
They earn their living, they are farmers,

737
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,509
and then in the evening they just sleep off in complete innocence.

738
01:01:03,669 --> 01:01:07,462
They do not plan, they do not sit down and find out

739
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:15,821
how to kill somebody, maybe something how to rob somebody

740
01:01:15,981 --> 01:01:19,103
or another bad things that people think

741
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:22,707
– the bad action that comes into their minds. There is no time for that.

742
01:01:22,867 --> 01:01:25,953
They work the whole day. In the evening, nicely they sleep.

743
01:01:26,113 --> 01:01:31,696
Or else they will have a bhajan mandeley where they will all sing together

744
01:01:31,856 --> 01:01:33,837
in a very beautiful manner.

745
01:01:33,997 --> 01:01:39,884
So it’s a real sahaj style where we don’t have to think

746
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:43,228
about killing anybody or to murder anybody.

747
01:01:43,388 --> 01:01:49,228
Like all these cults, they have weapons with them! I can’t understand.

748
01:01:49,388 --> 01:01:55,532
Even I was told that in Poland our Pope maharaj sent lots of weapons there.

749
01:01:55,692 --> 01:02:00,884
What is the need for anybody who is spiritual to have weapons around

750
01:02:01,044 --> 01:02:03,618
and think of violence and killing people?

751
01:02:03,778 --> 01:02:06,415
Because there is no innocence at all. You can see that.

752
01:02:06,575 --> 01:02:10,423
If you are innocent your power is your innocence,

753
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:15,439
you don’t have to have weapons and guns and things.

754
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:21,931
All these religions, so-called, are using nothing but weapons and guns

755
01:02:22,091 --> 01:02:26,165
and all kinds of killing objects and they are also killed.

756
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:32,079
It’s a funny thing going on in the name of God, in the name of Shri Ganesh.

757
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:34,360
There is no need for us to fight.

758
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,915
There is no need for us to think that we’ll kill this man or kill that one.

759
01:02:39,075 --> 01:02:42,696
Only you have to just desire, project your energy

760
01:02:42,856 --> 01:02:45,876
and you will see [that] the person will disappear.

761
01:02:46,036 --> 01:02:48,587
He’ll either become a transformed person

762
01:02:48,747 --> 01:02:52,763
or he will not be there to trouble you.

763
01:02:53,598 --> 01:02:58,720
So, one thing I have to again stress is that we must know our qualities

764
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,122
and our powers.

765
01:03:02,591 --> 01:03:06,923
Many people I know could never come on the stage and speak also.

766
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:12,106
I said, “You get along – finished! Start it.” It worked out.

767
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:17,001
Anything, you just project. “I can do it! Why can’t I do it?”

768
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:20,661
To say, “I can’t. I am sorry.”

769
01:03:20,934 --> 01:03:22,449
This ‘sorry’ is so common now.

770
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:25,812
On the telephone also people will say “sorry”.  I said, “What ‘sorry’?”

771
01:03:25,973 --> 01:03:28,032
All the time, “sorry, sorry, sorry.”

772
01:03:28,192 --> 01:03:31,040
We used to say, “I beg your pardon,” – was sensible.

773
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,431
But the way people are, “Poor me, you know. How can I do it?”

774
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:42,360
All such people are not yet aware of their powers that they have.

775
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,868
You can do it, everything. You can.

776
01:03:45,028 --> 01:03:49,259
Everything can be managed; after all, you have the power.

777
01:03:49,419 --> 01:03:54,103
In that power you must know that you are not going to do something indiscreet,

778
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:56,454
you are not going to spoil anybody,

779
01:03:56,614 --> 01:04:01,485
but your power itself will show that this power

780
01:04:01,645 --> 01:04:10,040
is really of love, affection, compassion for the transformation of the whole world.

781
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,235
I am thinking of the complete global transformation,

782
01:04:13,395 --> 01:04:19,161
which, I know, is a mad dream, but still I think like that,

783
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:24,751
because I see you all, then I think you all can do it

784
01:04:24,911 --> 01:04:32,411
and when I see the Shri Ganesha in you, I am sure it will work out.

785
01:04:33,192 --> 01:04:38,868
So, in my lifetime I have seen so many Sahaj Yogis, all over.

786
01:04:39,028 --> 01:04:42,899
How things are worked out: you have heard about in Brazil

787
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:46,134
and also in Argentina, most unexpected.

788
01:04:46,294 --> 01:04:50,189
The people came to a program from twelve o’clock in the morning

789
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:53,962
when we were going to have the program at seven o’clock!

790
01:04:54,122 --> 01:04:57,024
I reached there at about eight, as usual, and they said,

791
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,730
“Mother, You won’t believe there was a big drama here!”

792
01:04:59,891 --> 01:05:03,063
I said, “What drama?” “They were sitting here from twelve o’clock,

793
01:05:03,224 --> 01:05:06,314
so all those who had come earlier got inside,

794
01:05:06,474 --> 01:05:10,040
but those who came at the last minute would not be allowed

795
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,243
and they are sitting there and fighting,

796
01:05:12,403 --> 01:05:16,079
‘No, we are going to come inside somehow!’ ”

797
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:20,383
So then, one of the Sahaja Yogis sensibly went and talked to the manager

798
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:23,556
and told, “Baba, let them come! There is room.”

799
01:05:23,716 --> 01:05:25,290
So there were four tiers.

800
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:29,290
One was the ground, then one more, one more, one more.

801
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:31,649
When I came I saw, “What’s this?”

802
01:05:31,809 --> 01:05:36,754
All over, the whole thing was filled with these people.

803
01:05:37,239 --> 01:05:41,259
I had never seen them before, but they were there,

804
01:05:41,419 --> 01:05:49,247
and so respectful, so much absorbing the vibrations.

805
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:56,017
And I found it difficult to control my tears out of a real feeling

806
01:05:56,177 --> 01:06:01,450
of such gratitude for Shri Ganesh.

807
01:06:02,254 --> 01:06:04,728
He’s the one who worked it out.

808
01:06:04,888 --> 01:06:06,290
That’s why they say always,

809
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:10,204
“First worship Shri Ganesh before starting any work,”

810
01:06:10,364 --> 01:06:13,165
because then it gives you that peace,

811
01:06:13,325 --> 01:06:18,876
that tremendous powerful peace which works out so many things

812
01:06:19,036 --> 01:06:22,169
that you never thought it would.

813
01:06:25,184 --> 01:06:29,782
So we have to request Shri Ganesha

814
01:06:29,942 --> 01:06:34,704
that all the problems of our land owning should be solved by Him

815
01:06:34,864 --> 01:06:37,868
and by your Shri Ganesh power.

816
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:40,243
We are still hoping to get the land

817
01:06:40,403 --> 01:06:43,650
and I want to install this properly for you because every time

818
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,384
I don’t want you to suffer like this.

819
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:50,665
It’s a pilgrimage, but rather difficult this time you all had,

820
01:06:50,825 --> 01:06:54,766
but you managed it very nicely and you never showed

821
01:06:54,926 --> 01:07:00,911
any kind of a reluctance to accept this challenge.

822
01:07:01,778 --> 01:07:05,485
Shri Ganesha was testing you I think also, a little bit.

823
01:07:05,645 --> 01:07:08,845
But all that has worked out so well and now

824
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:12,720
we are here to do the puja of Shri Ganesh.

825
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,959
May God Bless you.
