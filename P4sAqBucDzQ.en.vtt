[MUSIC]

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:16.300
[MUSIC]

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.700
[MUSIC]

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.160
Can you turn the house lights off, please?

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.200
Good evening everybody and welcome to this absolutely [UNCLEAR]

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.880
of program on sahaja yoga, in the presence of Her Holiness, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.140
We shall now going to have, now have a brief introduction on

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.940
the different aspects regarding sahaja yoga and basically it is going to be an introduction to ourselves

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.060
that after Shri Mataji comes and when She begins Her discourse, we are going to try to have before that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.000
a background in our minds uh.. as to what exactly

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.440
should we expect, what exactly we would have then and try to on the context the meaning

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:51.060
the things that She's going to tell you. Believe me, this evening is a [UNCLEAR] evening in the lives

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.240
of all those of you who are going to see Her for the first time.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.740
To begin with, as we all know from different walks of life, through the ages

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.840
the prophets and the seers, after whom the great religions have been established,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.700
have talked about an inner awakening, a search for the truth that exists within each one of us,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.080
the realization of the Divinity that exists within each one of us, the awakening of Divine potentials

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.280
within each one of us and in doing so seek our integration, our union

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.620
with the All-Pervading power of God.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.780
This has been called and termed through various terms, various modifications, various definitions

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.420
and one of the commonest ones is yoga.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.200
Yoga actually means the union; The union of the Soul

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.900
which is there within each one of us and that of the All-Pervading power of God and in the union between

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.160
the Atma and the Parmatma or the individual Soul and the Supreme Soul.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.200
Shri Nanaka, who established or after whom came to be established the religion of Sikhism, said very clearly,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.100
''Kaahe he mann khojat jaaye, sada niwasi, sada Alepa, tohe sung samaaye'' -

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.200
Why is it that you go on searching for that

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.000
external, without, when that which is the highest, is the most sublime is in fact within you?

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.820
Christ spoke of the Kingdom of God saying that the Kingdom of God is within each one of us

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.700
and we have to reach that Kingdom of God, that we have to be born again

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:58.900
and upon which they [UNCLEAR - SPECIFICALLY?] asked, one of the disciples that, ''Being born again, does it mean that we have to enter our mother's womb?''

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.400
He said, ''No, the Kingdom of God which is within you has to be reached

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.380
to a process and thus you have to take to a second birth.''

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:19.020
Lao tse spoke about the internal river that flows within each one of us; Confucius said about the same thing

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.020
and thus you have all these people who have been through the centuries

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.620
speaking about something within each one of us that has to be awakened.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.500
So what exactly were they speaking about? Were they speaking about different things - in fact, no.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860
Socrates said, ''Know thyself.''

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:47.280
The essence of his philosophy was to know one's own self - meaning to be realized

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.740
within one's own self. To have this union,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.100
to have this loss of attitude [UNCLEAR] between the self and the other person,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.540
to have, in other words, the complete union that was to have the yoga.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.940
Now, the instrument of this yoga resides within each one of us and it is possible

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.680
for each one of us to achieve this state.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:26.820
At this point of time, permit me to emphasize, that what we are going to see just now, is nothing new,

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.980
is not an invention, is not a new discovery. It has been something which has been

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:40.620
spoken about again through the scriptures in the Bhagwad Gita, in the Bible, in the Granth Sahib.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:48.580
In the Koran it has been said time and again and many have tried to achieve this state

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:56.540
and many did, however, their numbers have been far and [UNCLEAR] between because

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:04.460
because on the Holy Spirit ladder, on the process of our evolutionary scale, the time had not come

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:12.120
for everybody to achieve this state. As all of us know, human evolution has been progressing

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:19.500
for millions of years from unicellular actually simple organisms to highly complex,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.060
highly evolved multi-cellular, multi-functional organism, which is the human-being

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:31.280
who is at the apex, the epitome of evolution - we have evolved to this [UNCLEAR].

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:38.820
But the evolutionary process has now reached it's penultimate stage and now we have to cross over

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:46.540
into that area whereby for the human level, from the consciousness at the human level

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:54.380
we have to achieve that which is beyond, which is beyond the limited human consciousness

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.440
and thus the time has come which Shri Mataji prefers to call as the Blossom time

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.600
where the Universal Self has to be reached by the individual Self.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.500
The individual consciousness has to be integrated with the Universal Unconscious

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.000
and that is where sahaja yoga comes into the picture.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:26.240
Sahaja yoga makes this process extremely simple and the awakening of this power within us

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.840
takes place without any effort - absolutely effortlessly.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:37.640
Sahaja yoga, by definition, is a synthesis of two words - 'Saha' means with

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:45.280
and 'Ja' means that which is born with. So sahaja means that which is born with

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.600
and that is how the yoga takes place.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:57.340
Now let us see as to what is this instrument of integration that is present within each one of us.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.200
As you can see in this chart,

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.740
we have about three channels flowing within each one of us.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.380
On the right hand side we shall see a yellow channel

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:23.300
which is called as the Rajogun or is called as the Pingala Nadi.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.920
On the left hand side we have, what is called as the Ida Nadi or is the Moon channel and

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:39.300
in between we have a channel which is called as the Sushumna Nadi or what is called as the Satwagun.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:47.240
Now these aspects have also been spoken about at length in different philosophies.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:53.600
The Chinese called it or have called it the 'Yin' and the 'Yang' or the power of

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.440
the action or that was the passive power and that was the active power.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:07.000
In Ayurveda it has been called as the three different elements which govern the life of the individual.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.580
And here we see that this is precisely what they have been talking about

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:21.080
that the right side, which corresponds to the Right Sympathetic system, is the channel whereby

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:28.060
we are able to act - it gives us the power of action. On the left side

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.960
which is, as you perhaps might be able to perceive, is the dark blue colored channel, which is the passive side, is the moon

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:43.720
which we call it the channel of the moon and that is the side which gives us the power of desire.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.920
It is through this channel that we get the power of desiring things.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:56.940
So we can desire through our left side that is the left channel and we can act out those desires

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:03.720
through the right side. The most important one, is the one in the center

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.860
which is called as the Satwagun, which is the central path of evolution

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.240
and within this central path are situated different centers,

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:24.200
different energy centers, which in ancient Sanskrit text have been called as chakras

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.820
meaning seats or seats of power.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:37.240
There are about seven main chakras in the body and we shall take up quick look and follow them

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:45.780
and, of course, there is the Kundalini energy, a dormant energy lying within each one of us

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:53.580
which is, in fact, the instrument of our union with the Divine, which actually

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.780
brings about the union between the individual Self and the cosmic Self.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.740
It is extremely difficult to cover everything

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:13.860
in a brief introductory talk but we shall try to understand as much as we can so that we can have, as I said before, a brief background

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:19.760
as to what we shall be privileged to hear once Shri Mataji takes the floor.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.040
At the bottom we have a red colored chakra, which is called as the Mooladhara chakra;

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:32.860
Now these chakras are situated within the Central Nervous system - they are extremely subtle,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:41.480
not perceivable to the human eye very visually, however, they have anatomical correspondences.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.980
For example, though we may not be able to see the three channels

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:53.460
they correspond on the right side to the right sympathetic chain, the left side, the left side sympathetic chain

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.500
and the Satwaguna or the middle channel corresponds to the Parasympathetic chain.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:07.300
Similarly, the seven energy centers correspond to seven anatomical plexuses

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:13.920
within the human body. A plexus is nothing but an aggregate of nerves.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:22.700
So we start at the bottom, which is a red colored chakra, is called as the Mooladhara chakra, it is the seat of our innocence,

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:30.740
it is the seat of our purity, it is the seat of our chastity. On the awakening of this chakra,

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:37.960
through Kundalini awakening, these are the qualities that manifest within each one of us.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:45.880
And thus as we progress through these channels, through these chakras we shall enumerate, very briefly,

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:54.100
what are the qualities of each one of these chakras and what are the benefits that we are going to get out of it because the bottom line is,

00:12:54.340 --> 00:13:00.400
okay if we do sahaja yog, if we take our Self-realization, what's in it for us?

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.740
So as we shall advance, we shall realize that there is indeed

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.640
a virtual storehouse of benefits for each one of us.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:18.200
Above the red colored chakra we see a triangular bone which corresponds with the gross sacrum bone

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:24.600
at the bottom of the vertebral column. Here resides the Kundalini shakti, what is called

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:31.320
in Sanskrit as the Kundalini shakti. It is a dormant, residual energy within each one of us

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:40.140
and it is to the ascent of this energy that as we have said before, we receive our Self-realization.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:49.680
Above that we have a yellow colored chakra which is called as the Swadhishthan chakra, is the second center.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:56.100
It is the center of creativity, of activity, of intellectual functions

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:03.580
and it is through the exercise of this center that we are able to plan, we are able to think

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.140
we are able to [UNCLEAR - ACT UP?], we are able to conceptualize

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:14.120
and naturally an over-functioning of this chakra can result in imbalances.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:23.280
Above that we have a green colored chakra, which is called as the Manipura chakra, which corresponds to the Aortic plexus

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.820
in the human body and this chakra has

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:35.240
qualities which give us a sense of proportionality, a sense of balance,

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:43.120
a sense of satisfaction, a sense of integration, a sense of dharma

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:50.820
as is said in the ancient Sanskrit text, which means a sense of duty - a duty that is sacred,

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.260
a sense of duty that is there within each one of us.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:03.640
Duty as a citizen of this country, duty as a citizen of this, as a member of this social [UNCLEAR],

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:09.980
duty as a husband, as a father, as a son, as a daughter, as a friend.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:17.720
Within each of our interaction, within the social [UNCLEAR] we have certain

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.600
duties to perform in an ideal way, in a perfect way

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:29.480
and it is to this said that we get an ideal as to how these duties are to be performed.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:36.280
Above that we have the fourth chakra which is also the heart chakra.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.840
It has got two components - on the left side one and on the right side as well as one in the center.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:51.140
Through this center we get the power of comfort, we get security

00:15:52.180 --> 00:16:00.020
and it is this center, which is in these modern times, completely in a state of imbalance

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:08.860
because of a great amount of physical activity, emotional stress, insecurity through careers, through jobs,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.800
due to various other factors - economic, social, convenient just naming.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:21.320
So anything secretly results in an imbalance in this chakra and the raising of the Kundalini

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:27.620
puts this chakra in a state of balance giving us the gift of security.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:36.960
Above this chakra we have the fifth chakra, which is called as the Vishudhhi chakra, which corresponds

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:44.000
with the Cervical plexus within us. This is the center of communication,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:51.920
our inter-personal relationships - the way we relate to each other as family members, as friends,

00:16:52.120 --> 00:17:00.320
as individuals in a working environment, as, as individuals in this society, as citizens of the world.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:06.140
This is the center that brings about integration within human beings.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:14.720
Above this we have the sixth center, which is called as the Agnya chakra

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:22.240
and it corresponds to the optic chiasma within the human physical body.

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:29.220
As you know, within us in the brain there exists a place called as the optic chiasma

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:36.200
where the optic nerves actually cross over each other and then go backwards.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.740
Now this was, somehow, known to the ancient sages, ancient prophets,

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:49.160
who through their Divine realization, had realized and had actually seen

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:54.920
this subtle system within each one of us and had already mentioned about it.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:02.300
So this is an extremely crucial center because through this center

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:09.540
we get the power of thought, the power of thinking, the power of rationalization

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:17.520
and the two channels of the left side and the right side, basically, cross over

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:23.220
at this point and terminate into the two balloons of the ego,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.760
which is a yellow colored balloon on the left hand side of the head and into a

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:36.780
blue colored balloon on the right hand side of the head which are the corresponding the balloons of the ego and the superego.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:46.340
Lastly, we come to the seventh center, which is the Sahasrara chakra, which is the seventh center

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:54.340
which corresponds to the limbic system within the human brain. Now this is the center which contains

00:18:54.620 --> 00:19:00.720
the seats of all the previous six centers and when the Kundalini

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:06.520
ascends through all the six centers and gets go up to then once again

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:14.940
the Swadhishthan chakra, then the second center, the Nabhi chakra or Manipur chakra, then the third one, the Heart chakra, which is the fourth one,

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:22.900
the fifth chakra, which is the Vishhudhi chakra, the sixth one and, finally, the seventh chakra which is the Sahasrara chakra.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:30.920
Once the Kundalini comes out of the seventh chakra, it establishes a contact

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:38.160
with this All-Pervading power of God and that is the state which has been described

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:43.240
in all the Scriptures as the state of Self- realization.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:50.600
This is the state wherein an individual becomes thoughtlessly aware -

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:59.160
is not that is not aware of his surroundings but he is in a state of thoughtlessness and

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:05.960
very difficult as it might perhaps be to believe this state is very easily achievable

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:12.820
because as most of us know that when a thought process starts, it starts very slowly,

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:20.200
achieves a crest - achieves a peak level of activity - and then it gradually falls down

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:28.660
and then the second level starts, the second thought starts and throughout our lifetimes we spend consciously

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.440
jumping from one thought to the other, to the next and to the next.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:41.860
However, there is a time between two successive thoughts when there is an infinitesimally

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:47.360
small space of time wherein you are actually thoughtless

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.340
but we are not aware of it because it is going on at such a fantastic speed.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:59.120
Through the process of Kundalini awakening we can stay

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:06.260
between that [UNCLEAR - IN THAT OR INACTIVE?] period, between two thoughts and be actually thoughtless.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:12.920
This is the state known as the Nirvicharita, which means the state of thoughtlessness

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.400
which has been described again and again through the scriptures.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:25.340
My dear friends, what I would like to emphasize is, that sahaja yoga brings about this entire process

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:31.240
very spontaneously, very effortlessly, without involving number one

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:37.680
any form of payment of any sort. You don't have to pay a single penny

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:44.380
to get your Self-realization because as Shri Mataji says, ''You cannot buy your Self-realization

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.980
and God, most importantly doesn't understand money.''

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:56.580
To achieve this state without any effort, without the chanting of any hymns, any mantras,

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:04.840
going through any long procedures of fasting, physical exercise, any physical [UNCLEAR], any conditionings,

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:10.200
you don't have to give up any thing, you don't have to take any preset conditions.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:17.820
It is extremely simple, it is extremely spontaneous, it is extremely effortless,

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:22.640
it is extremely effective - it works.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:31.380
Sahaja yoga is today being practiced in more than 65 countries of the world including the former

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:37.840
Soviet Union and the Soviet Republics we have hundreds of thousands of

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:43.460
yogis all over the world practicing sahaja yoga. Now, what are the benefits of sahaja yoga?

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:51.020
Briefly as we have seen, each one of these chakras, have their special qualities

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:59.080
and as the Kundalini energy, which is like a Mother, which is our spiritual Mother waiting

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:07.160
to give us this great opportunity to be born again, She nourishes these chakras

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.700
just like a mother nourishes her own offspring.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:20.060
And thus through the process of Kundalini awakening, the qualities of each one of these chakras

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:26.540
starts manifesting through each one of us and thus we can become

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:33.160
and we have such people all over the world today who are beautiful citizens,

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:41.220
beautiful individuals leading extremely moral, chaste, beautiful lives serving

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:49.600
a great function not only to themselves but to the societies and to the nations of which they are the citizens.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:55.160
These are the benefits of sahaja yoga in a nutshell.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:02.740
Apart from this you also enjoy very good physical health, psychological health, emotional health

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:10.720
and mental health because sahaja yoga helps you to achieve a state of an integrated personality

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:17.640
where there is no conflict within yourself and thus you don't have conflicts with others.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:24.020
You don't enter into conflicts with others because you are established in a state of peace

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:32.260
and when you are at peace with yourself, you don't feel like getting into a state of disturbance,

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.780
getting into a state of war even at a mental, at an intellectual level with others.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:46.380
Let us now try to understand as to who is the person behind this great Spiritual happening.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:55.140
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi was born in India in 1923

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:03.080
in a Christian family. She took part to, She was the child of

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:09.540
extremely patriotic parents, very learned, highly intelligent, very well educated -

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:17.460
Her father could speak so many languages fluently, Her mother was a Masters [UNCLEAR - OLDER, VERY OLDER?] in Mathematics.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:26.260
Into such uh.., such a intellectual, highly gifted and patriotic family She was born in 1923.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:32.780
As most of Marathi might be knowing, those were the years when India was trying to get it's independence

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.360
and Her parents were deeply involved with the [UNCLEAR]. So at the very young age

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:45.820
She got Herself involved in the Indian freedom movement. She even stayed with Mahatma Gandhiji

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:53.260
in his ashram at Wardha and at Sabarmati in India and after Indian independence

00:25:53.760 --> 00:26:00.960
during those years She was married to a gentleman, who later served extremely important posts

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.780
within the Indian government and later on in the United Nations.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:12.680
She was married to Dr. C.P. Srivastava, who was the personal secretary to the late Prime Minister of India,

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:19.780
Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri and thereafter Dr. Srivastava, Her husband, was for six

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:27.560
consecutive terms the elected Secretary General of the International Maritime Organization

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.500
which is a very important division of the United Nations.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:39.040
The point that one tries to make is, Shri Mataji has been a married person,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.900
She has two daughters, She has grandchildren and they're married

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:51.060
so She is an absolute householder, an absolutely seemingly,

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:57.580
an absolutely apparently, an absolutely on the base of it a very domestic person

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.080
like you and me and each one of us in this auditorium and beyond.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:10.180
She has completely played Her role as a daughter, as a citizen, as a wife,

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:16.520
as a Mother, as a grandmother to each one with absolute perfection

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:25.280
to such an extent that all of them even today are extremely devoted to Her. She enjoys a completely blissful

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:32.820
married life with Her family but beyond this She is the spiritual guide

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:40.760
to millions of Her devotees around the world and She has established this movement of sahaja yoga,

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:48.480
at the same time keeping Her connection, Her duties towards Her family

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:56.680
which brings us to the most important point and the most wonderful point about sahaja yoga, which is that

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:04.840
you can have a state of God realization, you can continue to have your state of Zen,

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:13.280
your state of thoughtless awareness without having to divorce yourself from any or all of your duties

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.360
as a normal citizen, as a normal individual.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:25.340
We can continue with our lives, with our careers, with our married life, with our social lives and yet

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.920
enjoy the state of bliss and happiness.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.980
The reason why one tries to emphasize this point has been, is because

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:38.440
till sahaja yoga was brought into effect

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:46.280
people could achieve the state of Self- realization. However it took decades and decades

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:53.900
of, sometimes fruitless perseverance, fruitless effort to achieve this state.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:29:00.700
People had to leave their jobs, they had to leave their families, go and stay and meditate for years together

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.480
just to achieve that fraction of this wonderful state.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:13.600
But after 1970, after Shri Mataji established sahaja yoga, this is the blossom time

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:20.960
when not one, not two but people in the thousands can achieve this state because human evolution

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:27.840
has reached a point where now we can get this wonderful happening within each one of us.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.800

- Can you all hear Me, please?
- Yes, Mother.
- Thank You.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:37.540
I bow to all the seekers of Absolute Truth.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:48.460
At the very outset we have to know what is Absolute Truth is.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:57.220
Whatever I'm going to tell you today, please do not accept it

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:04.080
and do not take it for granted because this blind faith

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:08.960
has created so many problems as you know.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:17.160
In every country we have people who have such tremendous blind faith

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:25.900
that for ages together, for generations together they have been blinded

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:33.200
where they are born, what is their community, what are their parents,

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.220
what nationality they belong to, what race they belong to.

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:43.000
All these have created tremendous conditioning in our mind

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:51.700
and we are bound - we are not free - we are bound, bound by all these ideologies and everything that we have been hearing,

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:56.780
which we have been reading about, which we have been knowing.

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:03.080
So, for people who are seekers of Absolute Truth

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:08.820
must understand that so far they have not found out Absolute Truth.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:20.020
Now, what is the Absolute Truth? Absolute Truth which has been told by all the great Incarnations and

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:26.120
all the saints of the world is that, ''That truth lies within you

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:34.740
and that you are not this body, this mind, not this

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:42.560
aspirations and ego and conditionings and also emotions

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:49.280
but you are the pure Spirit.'' This is the state you have to achieve.

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:57.460
Now these modern times, I call them as Blossom Times - they are special times all being already predicted

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:04.560
in so many scriptures, especially, in a scripture called as Naadi Granth

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:11.520
written by the pioneer of our astrology, Bhrigumuni.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:17.820
He said, ''At this times people who are seeking reality

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:23.880
or truth in the hills

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:33.680
and dales and caves will find the truth.''

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:41.340
Of course, as you know that many people are just get enamored by things which are hellish,

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:49.040
which are nothing to do with truth. Where you must have heard of so many people committing suicide,

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:55.800
going into big violence, killing others

00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:03.380
all sorts of things which are hellish and they call it they are seekers of truth - they cannot.

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:11.420
Truth means tranquility, peace. It means

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:22.700
also joy. Have you heard of every saint who started a tirade

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:29.400
against killing others? Unless and until they were very much attacked,

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:35.400
like at the time of Islam, they did not take to it

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:39.300
because they thought we'll be saved and protected.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:47.960
But the problem with all of them was that, that they were not connected

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:52.580
to the Divine power of truth, to Divinity.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:55:00.880
In their thought they thought they belonged to some sort of a community, to some sort of a

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:09.820
very noble causes but they were not connected to that force which has created them

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:18.680
and that is the point why they lost and we are surprised why should they suffer.

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:28.100
Now the time has come, special time as I told you, blossom time, where many flowers are born

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:36.060
and they have to achieve their complete maturity - become fruits.

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:42.560
This maturity is only possible if you have a steady mind.

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:50.820
In the West, specially I'm surprised, that people get realization alright but they are shifty;

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:58.560
They start doing guru shopping, going from one to another. If, say, a plant

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:04.080
is removed all the time from one place to another, how will it improve?

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:12.980
You don't have to pay for it. Also this is another very great objection for Me that you don't have to pay for sahaja yog.

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:18.100
They think that if you have paid then you have to do less work - you have paid for it.

00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:26.120
Secondly, perhaps, maybe, they might think, '' Oh, what is the credibility?'' Now, something that cannot be sold,

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:34.100
which is invaluable, we have to think about Christ, how much did we pay?

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:42.340
Think of anybody who was an Incarnation; How can you pay for your Self-realization?

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:48.940
How much do we pay to this Mother Earth which produces beautiful flowers for us?

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:54.880
We don't pay Her anything. In the same way you cannot pay for

00:56:55.460 --> 00:57:02.240
this living process of your evolution which is a last breakthrough, is the last breakthrough

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:09.940
of your evolution. So firstly we must understand what this can [UNCLEAR] in our way,

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:18.260
in our realization. If I say, this mind, this human mind is the most

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.560
artificially created obstacle by us.

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:29.980
Through our ego, through our conditionings we have created this mind which stops us

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:36.620
from entering into that realm of peace, tranquility, of Divine love.

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:43.760
How to cross this mind has been a problem for all the seekers

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.760
because it bombards you with thoughts, all the time it's bombarding your thoughts -

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:55.820
thoughts are coming from the future or from the past and we are not in the present.

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.560
Just now if I say, you be in the present, you cannot be.

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:08.340
You'll be immediately thrown to the future side or to the past.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:14.000
These two sides all the time keeps us tossing.

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.700
The thought comes like this and falls down, another thought comes and falls down

00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:25.620
and we are dancing on the cusp of these thoughts all the time and that's why we are restless,

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:33.240
that's why we are upset, that's why we have so many problems of our mind itself.

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:41.800
Apart from that we have so many other problems - many diseases are there

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:48.220
which we do not know how to cure and if you try to cure one disease, you get another one.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:56.000
It's a very funny thing that if you try to cure, say schizophrenia,

00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:02.920
you get another disease which is because of

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:09.280
Dopamine or what ever is, is called as - you get another disease which is more serious

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.420
when your hands, your feet all start shaking.

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:18.820
So now, between these two how are we in the center?

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:26.200
For that, our Creator has created this beautiful

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:31.340
subtle system within us - whether you believe it or not, it exists.

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:39.980
When you are suffering from [UNCLEAR - BODY'S?] diseases

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:47.940
and if your power, residual power, which we call as Kundalini,

00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:54.500
who is your mother, your individual mother - all of them have your individual mother.

00:59:55.660 --> 01:00:02.060
She knows everything for you, she knows what are your aspirations,

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:09.560
she knows what mistakes you have committed, she knows where you have been - it's all recorded

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:18.300
but she's extremely anxious to give you this second birth and for that spontaneously she rises,

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:24.480
rises and pierces through this fontanel bone area and

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:32.900
connects you with this All-Pervading power of Divine love. We have heard about it, we have studied about it,

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:41.500
we call it by different names for disciple of Christ call it, 'The two breeds of the Holy Ghost,'

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:48.300
very clearly. Then in the Sanskrit language it's called as Param Chaitanya.

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:57.200
Also in the Bible is described as the All-Pervading power of Divine love and also

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.540
Gurunanaka and all these saints have described it as 'Alakh Niranjan' -

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:13.660
It's a beautiful world 'Alakh' you can't see that. Niranjan means it is without any amusement

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:22.620
That's the one, is the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, we can say, the power of the Holy Ghost which is around us

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:30.880
and when the Spirit comes, it is enlightened, we can feel that power flowing through our Central Nervous system.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:40.060
So there's a word in Sanskrit called as 'Budh' from where 'Buddha' has come - meaning to know. 'Bodh'

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.660
means to know on your finger-tips, to know on your Central Nervous system. It is not just a lecture,

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:55.760
it's not just creating a sign of the red, 'O, I'm a Christian, I'm a Hindu or I'm a Muslim or I'm a twice born.'

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:03.240
A person who's a twice born, is a person who is a realized soul whose

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.380
Spirit is emitting vibrations on

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.200
the nerves through the Central Nervous system.

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:21.800
It's so close to Science, it's so simple with the Science and when this starts happening

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:29.800
then you get this Bodha, you can call the Self-knowledge. Also in Sanskrit there is one word called Veda

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:36.000
from where the Vedas are written. Ved means Vid, Vid means to know on Central Nervous system

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:43.600
First stanza of Vedas is that, 'If reading all this,

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:52.300
if you do not get it the Vid or the Self, means know on the Central Nervous system, is all useless.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:00.400
Shankaracharya has said very clearly, ''Oh Mother! take me out of this

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:09.480
webs of words.'' He called it 'Shabdjalam' - out of this webs of words.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:15.020
You go on reading, reading, reading and Kabira has said,

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:22.780
''Padhi, padhi pandit murakh bhaye.'' - by reading too much even the learned becomes stupid.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:29.780
I used to think, 'What is he talking about, how can that be? If people read, then how can they become stupid?''

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:38.120
Because others go into your head. It's the knowledge of the other people in your head - their own brain is finished.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:44.460
Well, I've met many like that overly read people. They just go on talking, talking, talking.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.300
God knows what they're talking - incoherently sometimes.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.200
So whatever these people have said, I have seen and I've seen in people happen

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:03.200
but I've seen something more in these modern times that spontaneously thousands of people get realization.

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:08.160
It's an enmasse happening - it's not one person giving realization to one person.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.280
It's said in the twelfth century in India - there was one,

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:23.760
we can call them as one type of seeking. Once somewhere seeking

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.820
the right side someone left a particular center and they were called as 'Avadhutas' -

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:37.640
Machindernath and Gorakhnath, two great people uh..., saints, you see. They went up to Burma, they went to

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:44.960
even Russia, they went to uh.. Volimia

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:51.640
and these people talked about kundalini. So they know about Kundalini but they don't know how to awaken it

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:58.760
and they have run away, these people have run away to Bolivia and all that so it has not been affected, the knowledge is still here,

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:02.260
in Bolivia [UNCLEAR - SO HIGH UP?] and

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:08.000
you can now imagine, this knowledge has been there for thousands and thousands of years

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:15.400
but has been finished by people who are supposed to be uh.. people in charge of religion;

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:21.620
You call them 'Dharma Martand.' They would not accept, they said, 'No, this all nonsense.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:30.120
Even in twelfth century when Gyanadeva, such a great poet, wrote about it in the sixth chapter of his book,

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:36.320
they said, ''This is something is not to be seen 'nishiddh' - you're not to read this,''

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:41.980
because they didn't want people to have this true knowledge because if they have true knowledge

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.520
the existence of all these [UNCLEAR] will disappear

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:51.200
and then how will they manage because they are money-oriented or power-oriented,

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:55.600
so how will they gain? This was the purpose of

01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:00.340
obliterating all this knowledge completely from human existence.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.360
Now, when I start talking about it, people say it's a cult. I don't know how it is a cult when it has been described for so many years.

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:15.760
It has to be experienced, works - no doubt.

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:24.100
So, the first of all, as I told you, that you get rid of your sicknesses, your illnesses, your physical illnesses.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:28.980
Doctors are easiest to come to sahaja yog because they see

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:33.820
the difference between the treatment of sahaja yoga and treatment of anything.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:41.580
We have definitely cured cancer, definitely cured cancer, definitely cured also AIDS, no doubt

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:46.540
but the problem with AIDS people are they're thinking they are martyrs

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:53.560
and they're formed in groups of people that they are great martyrs, you know such a martyr - now how can you cure them?

01:06:55.160 --> 01:07:02.700
They are under a wrong impression that they are dying, like martyrs they're dying; They have flags and they have big, big

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:07.500
monograms written everywhere - what can you do to such people?

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:15.240
But it can cure most of your illness - most.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:20.240
I won't say guarantee because maybe, some may not receive it.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:30.260
This is the first thing that happens that physically you get cured. Mentally - mentally also many diseases have been cured.

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:36.440
We have more mental diseases than we have physical.

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:45.840
They're saying, in America very soon there will be 65% people suffering from Schizophrenia - can you imagine?

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:51.420
What are we going to do in that country 65% people are suffering

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:55.640
but when I tell them they don't want to believe.

01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:03.180
Why not? Because you don't have to pay anything, you are not given any medicine -

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:07.420
nothing. You are cured through sahaja yoga treatment.

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:12.800
Why not go and see that, see for yourself?

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:19.420
But the whole medical science depends on how much money you earn naturally;

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:23.400
Because we don't earn any money so people don't like us.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:30.840
It's very funny thing but it is happening.

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:36.220
Then, all your emotional problems are solved.

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:44.440
We have had marriages after marriages every year I don't know how many are married and every year at least, hundred

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:51.580
are married in India, also in Russia. About 1% people get divorced -

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:59.080
that we don't mind. Divorce is important if it is absolutely [UNCLEAR - FEASIBILITY?]

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:06.160
If it's troubles each other, it's alright. But only 1%, at the most,

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:14.560
people take divorce and they have children who are extremely talented, beautiful, loving,

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.560
respecting - they are out of the blue beautiful children

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:29.640
and at a very young age they prosper so we started school in Dharamshala. There's a place

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:36.180
in India where it is nice and good and normally in India people have good schools

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.800
away from  the madding crowd of the cities and villages.

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:49.540
You'll be amazed to know, that in the Matriculation exam that we have, which is a very difficult

01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:57.320
exam, I think, compared to any other country, in India, the first person,

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:03.020
first of first in the whole of India, was from our school

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.440
and all the children who appeared for that exam, got first class.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:17.720
To get first class in that examination, is very difficult because it's not an ordinary type of course

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:24.920
and imagine, this girl got first class first in the whole of the country -

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:33.240
how? And she is American, both parents are American.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:40.860
It's very surprising how it has happened but because your creativity improves,

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.700
your retention power improves, your memory improves

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:53.080
and your attention itself becomes so pure that you don't go on seeing things which are useless,

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:58.240
you don't waste your energy - you only see things which give you joy.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:06.820
Your attention is so, so sharp and so loving;

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:16.520
It is attention that works everything. Imagine this attention which is hovering here and there and wasting it's energy

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:23.180
and all the energy of the body - this attention becomes so sharp

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:28.840
and so loving that it goes to places wherever it is required.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:38.160
Because it's Absolute knowledge, the attention itself becomes Absolute. Whatever your attention will tell, is the fact.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:46.680
Now how do you get the attention on your finger-tips [UNCLEAR - DIRECT?]? You can feel on your finger-tips which center is out of

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:56.560
caring, which is in jeopardy. You immediately feel on your finger-tips, you yourself become the detector

01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:02.020
[PLEASE THERE - AFTER THE LECTURE, ALRIGHT?]

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:11.420
So, you yourself automatically know what's the matter with you, on your finger-tips - you have Self-knowledge.

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:20.240
Now you don't get worried and upset, you take sahaja yoga treatment, you're alright, your chakras are alright, are cleaned out, centers are perfect.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:28.680
Then you can also feel others so you can know what's wrong with the others.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:35.160
Now there are many I know here in this country also in America all over because you're well off.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:42.120
People in search of money come here as big gurus and I don't know what they call themselves.

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:50.380
Some of them just are and have changed and are wearing saffron clothes - they have no credibility about them

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:57.560
and they say say we're [UNCLEAR], we're this, we're that and people are so simple they believe them.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.720
And so many have minted money. There's one in now in America

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:12.100
who says that you can control the mind of others. Why do you want to control the mind of others? First control your own mind.

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:19.200
And he gives some sort of a pendulum to move and then you can move the pendulum [UNCLEAR]

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:26.800
But what upset Me was that, so many people have sold their houses, taken out their children from school

01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:31.720
and are suffering so much, so much money is spent [UNCLEAR]

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:39.080
So, one has to understand that Absolute truth is to be

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:45.760
felt on your Central Nervous system; It is an experience,

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:53.020
it is a becoming, you become something. For example,

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:58.580
in Sanskrit a realized soul is called as 'Dwijah' - born again

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:07.080
and a bird also is called a dwijah because bird is an egg

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:14.500
and then it becomes a bird. In the same way we are in the web of our conditioning and ego

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:22.920
but this egg opens up and we grow our wings and complete freedom,

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.800
complete freedom because you're by freedom you don't do wrong things,

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.580
you'll not do anything that is destructive to yourself and to others.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:42.380
I mean, it's something they talk of religion, as if, you have become religion or you have gone beyond religion,

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:50.520
you don't need religion - you are religion. That's the state you get and is already described in so many books

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:59.480
but we don't understand because it's said sometimes it is in poetry, sometimes in abstract way but you become religious.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:12.480
So first state comes to us when these thoughts are all hovering on our head, when the Kundalini rises She elongates this

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:19.040
these thoughts and in between is the bliss of peace

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:26.300
where you don't think. In Sanskrit it is called 'Nirvichaar Samaadhi'

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:35.300
We can call it thoughtless awareness - you're  completely aware but you are thoughtless, without any thought.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:42.240
If you want to think, you can think but if you don't want to think, you need not think.

01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:50.120
It is fantastical - you become so peaceful that you do not react - reaction goes away.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:55.680
That's how family life, national life - everything can be improved.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:03.600
And when you see something - see I see this beautiful carpet here - so I don't think, I just watch

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:11.360
because if I start thinking, I'll think, how much it is, who's it is. If it is Mine, I'll be worried, I'll insure it and all sorts of things.

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:20.260
But if there is no thought, I just watch and the joy of the artist

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:27.500
which is in this carpet, starts in an abstract way, starts flowing and starts soothing Me.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:34.080
Really beautiful things when you see, you don't have to think, the whole thing becomes like a

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:41.980
peace giving apparatus. Feel so tranquil and so peace

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:48.440
and this modern disease that has come, stress and strain, disappears - absolutely disappears.

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:59.620
There is no stress, there's no strain because this has opened now, everything passes out.

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:07.800
But at the same time the problem gets solved - how? Supposing you are standing in the water,

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:15.360
then you are afraid of the waves that are arising but supposing you get into the boat

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:22.680
then, you watch, you watch and enjoy also.

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:29.700
Enjoying those waves which were troubling you. Then what do you do?

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:37.000
Supposing you learn swimming, so you go down and save many others who are getting completely lost.

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:45.440
This happens to you as a matter of your powers; You become that, you become that powerful

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:55.280
and the second great thing happens is that, you become Collectively conscious - saamoohik.

01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:03.320
Like, on the finger-tips, I said, you can feel others. Who is the other then?

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:11.820
You become part and parcel of the whole - the microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:19.040
It is said, said but now you become again part and parcel of the whole and the whole looks after you.

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:25.780
It gives you such a protection

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:31.520
that you're amazed. Recently there was an accident in Philadelphia.

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:35.980
Four sahaja yogis and a little baby were travelling and the car was crashed.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:42.800
They came back to New York with tears in their eyes, I said, ''What happened?'' ''Mother, You have protected us.'' ''Why?''

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:49.560
Not a scratch on their body and many such things have happened. So many of miracles

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:57.180
that now miracle has lost it's meaning really. I told somebody that you better write down all these miracles because I have no time

01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:03.180
so within one month he had it up to his head, above his head both the sides papers.

01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:09.860
He said, ''Mother, I don't know what to write, what not to write so You better go through it. I said, ''I have no time, I've no time

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:17.000
so leave it, it's alright, let them enjoy the miracles.'' But there is this Divine power

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:20.540
Divine power of love.

01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:26.940
We need not believe. You can feel it today - tonight you are going to feel that power

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:31.080
and once you feel it, you have to just know how to use it.

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:39.420
So you become Collectively conscious and when you become Collectively conscious, no fight you'll do, no -

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:44.360
you don't fight, you don't react. There is

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:54.140
no need to preach about peace at all, also giving Peace uh... awards.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:20:00.740
People get peace awards - I've seen them and met them and how they're horribly hot-tempered, selfish;

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:07.680
I don't know how they are saying that they have got peace - where? Peace should be within us

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:14.140
and once this transformation takes place in human-beings, there will be no fight,

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:20.480
there will be no problem of any kind with another person, with another human-being.

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:29.260
We enjoy each other. Now, as I told you, we have 65 nations who are in sahaja yoga,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.220
who are working out sahaja yoga. Some nations are very powerful say, Russia - it's very powerful.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:45.760
Thousands and thousands Russian - maybe because of oppression of the Communism,

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:54.120
maybe they didn't know anything about religion and - I, I don't know how to explain it but I was amazed. I went

01:20:54.320 --> 01:21:01.980
to Leningrad first where two thousand people inside because for the hall they have to pay - not Me but hall

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:06.960
and there were two thousand people sitting inside, two thousand outside. I said,

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:14.820
''There was not much propaganda, just My photographs were here and there so then they said,

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:22.240
they learnt something in Hindi also, said, ''Ma, what about us?'' I said, ''Alright, I will, I'll come back.''

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:28.280
After the program when I came, they were all there sitting down so I said, ''Alright, you come along tomorrow.

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:37.700
We'll meet here, there's lot of open space, you don't have to book hall. So they came. They came,

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:44.360
two thousand from inside came, outside two thousand came and two thousand their friends also came.

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:54.260
And six thousand of them, they got their realization and they just settled down in it - they are not shifty

01:21:55.700 --> 01:22:00.440
that's what I find. I don't know America even Canada.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:04.960
If your mind is shifty like that you cannot grow, you cannot mature.

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:12.580
But they had this problem of oppression and no talk of religion, no talk about sex.

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:21.360
They were so clean people and so deep within and was surprised all of them settled down.

01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:28.740
They're thousands and thousands there now. There's a joke about it. One American went,

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:35.320
a sahaja yogi from [UNCLEAR - KALYADI?], so the [UNCLEAR - KALYADI?] said, ''Okay ask him,'' - long time back about

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:40.420
we can say seven, eight years back - '' how many sahaja yogis there are in America?''

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:48.620
He said, ''We have fifty six.'' ''Oh, my God, you have fifty-six thousand, we have only twenty-one thousand in Kalyadi.''

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:56.120
You cannot talk to them in a hall - same in every place

01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:02.080
and when we have all meetings together it's in a big forest in Volga river.

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:09.120
I mean, I'm amazed that how these people have taken to it

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:17.020
and one day, I'm sure, you can compete with them. When you'll meet them, you will be surprised and happy.

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:25.480
They're very intelligent, very well-educated, Ph.D. and all kinds of things they have done.

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:33.100
Scientist of every quality - I'm surprised that how these scientists have taken to sahaja yoga!

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:42.280
We had a conference of scientists. There were 300 scientists in it. We started with Science, I thought of a talk of Science they'll feel interested

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:50.240
so one person, ''Mother, no more Science. We know, we know Medical Science. Please tell us the Science of God,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:58.900
Science of Divine. We don't want to know. So this kind of a character style

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:05.240
of a personality, I don't know from where Russian [UNCLEAR] this. Also Romanian

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:13.340
I would say all Christian devout people are there but specially, I would say, Russia and Romania are wonderful.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:21.280
And their creativity has improved so much - paintings and singing, so many things they are doing.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:29.280
Even so many Indian artist have become very well-known like, if you know Amzad Ali - he was a sahaja yogi

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:36.740
and he was nothing - now he's become such a great thing. There are many like this who have become great scientists

01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:43.720
and great musicians, great doctors but that's not, that's not

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:51.680
what you are asking for. You are asking for your ascent to a higher awareness - that's what you want to be

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:57.240
and for that you don't need much time. Within one month's time you will be there.

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:05.860
You will become your own master. You don't need any master, any guru, anybody like that. You'll yourself become your own master

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:13.660
and you can look after yourself and others. I promise you this can happen so, if you have

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:21.000
little faith in Me, you can try and have it but if you have any questions or anything,

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:26.800
you can write to Me and I'm sure, we can answer that because these questions are nothing but mental -

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:31.440
these are mental acrobat and it's not going to help us little.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:44.120
Happy to see so many people today here and I hope all of you will take to it.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:50.500
We have follow-up programs, we have some very good sahaja yogis here and the

01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:59.800
the way it will help you, yourself will write to Me I know. It is your own, it's your own power.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:08.680
You're not obliged to Me by any chance. This is your own power which rises and

01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:17.160
makes you one with that Divine power of love because this power

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:21.560
of Divine love is

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:29.400
so prompt, so quick, so efficient, so protective -

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:39.060
at the same time it loves you so it forgives - many a times you need forgiveness, it forgives you.

01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:48.000
It's such a sweet experience, it's such a beautiful experience of [UNCLEAR - GRACE?] -

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:52.780
why shouldn't you have it, why should you deny it, I can't understand?

01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:01.860
And some people who belong to, say, some group or that should go, they have no [UNCLEAR]

01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:06.360
If they find it, they should take it to their group and tell them, ''What are you doing?''

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:15.560
This is very important because this is the special time

01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:21.540
you are born in the special time. William Blake has described this that,

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:27.240
''The men of God will be born

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:31.480
at this time and they will know the Divinity.''

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:39.740
So many have, it's not only that Brihgumuni has said so many of them have described about it.

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:47.760
So as it is, you're all there to have it and I request you not to bother,

01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:55.880
questioning yourself or thinking about it - it will just work out. Need not feel you are another problem we have

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:11.320
that is one of the [UNCLEAR - GLITCHES OR CONNECTIONS?]. First of all, I must say, it will take hardly 10 minutes for you to get it

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:19.500
and those who don't want to have it should leave the hall - much better - because no use disturbing others -

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:27.840
it's not civil but those who want it will definitely get it. I would request all of you be seated, it would be better to be seated.

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:38.840
You have to be comfortable. You don't have to go to Himalayas, stand on your heads - nothing of the kind.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:44.060
You have to be just comfortable, comfortably seated, that's all.

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:52.860
You don't have to give up your family, give up your uh.. money - nothing of the kind; What is there to give up?

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:05.000
There is no restriction of any kind - you are absolutely free because you become the Spirit

01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:09.180
and in the light of Spirit you know what is good and what is bad for you.

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:16.400
But people, even when they know what is good and bad, they cannot give up but with this you get the power -

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:23.240
power to give up whatever is destructive for you; You just do it without any difficulties.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:27.000
[Just a minute, please, can you...]

01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:35.240
Without any difficulties you can, you can very easily get over all this

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:41.480
and become one with this great power of love; We have never used the power of love.

01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:48.520
We have never used the power of love, never. All your hatred and all these things just drop out -

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:55.520
become a complete personality. You are needless - so satisfied and so happy.

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:07.620
Highest, as I told you, that you jump in the water in such a way as if it is a ocean of love,

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:16.460
ocean of joy and joy is singular - it is not like happiness and unhappiness - it is singular.

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:23.640
So when you jump into the ocean of joy, it's to be experienced,

01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:29.280
to be felt, to be happy.

01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:36.860
So, first of all, there are two conditions, I must say - very simple -

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:48.140
that you are not to feel guilty; You have to respect yourself

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:55.400
not to condemn yourself because you are seekers; I respect you

01:30:55.740 --> 01:31:01.320
and I love you. In the same way you have to love your personality and you don't have to,

01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:09.540
in any way, condemn yourself or anything whatever you have done. Forget the past; Whatever has happened has happened.

01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:20.300
What's the use of feeling guilty? Because if you feel guilty, then you develop a guilt here on the left-hand side

01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:25.680
what you call as the Vishuddhi

01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:31.960
and this left-hand side of Vishuddhi is very, very dangerous

01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:40.060
because if it is caught, then you can get a disease called Angina - you know that - where you get heart attacks.

01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:46.620
Secondly, you might get - if not attack - you might get a very bad spondylitis

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:52.400
otherwise you can get also very lethargic organs.

01:31:53.140 --> 01:32:00.200
Why do you get all these things for nothing at all? Useless. Why to buy these things for feeling guilty?

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:06.900
You should not feel guilty at all. You have done nothing wrong. If you are guilty, you would have been in jail not here.

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:12.380
So please don't feel guilty. This is one of the most important

01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:19.000
uh.. I should say, very, very important uh.. condition

01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:26.140
because if this center is closed, how can you get here? The second condition is forgive.

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:33.600
For that you just have to say, ''Ma, I forgive everybody. Mother, I forgive every one.'' Just that. You have to just say it.

01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:39.980
You first say, don't have to do anything, if required - you feel very much better because

01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:45.420
the center in between the two optic chiasma is like this - absolutely obstructed

01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:52.820
and this center has to open. For that what have we to do is to forgive.

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:59.720
Unless and until you forgive others it won't open like this. Unless and until it opens, the Kundalini won't pass through.

01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:05.220
So for such an important thing as your Self-realization,

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:10.260
which is something very much [UNCLEAR] you can say,

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:14.280
are you going to give up for not forgiving others?

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:21.040
When logically you are doing nothing, logically you are nowhere.

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:29.200
If you forgive or don't forgive, so just you say, ''I forgive everyone,'' and not to think about people also

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:36.940
who have been [UNCLEAR] or whom you are supposed to forgive - not to think because thinking itself gives you  headache;

01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:41.240
Horrible people they are, why not forgive them?

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:49.320
Forgive. This is a big message also Christ has given to forgive and so we have to forgive.

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:57.460
Forgive with just your heart, forgive everyone. You have nothing to do with them

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:03.400
so then this Divine power will manage the show; You don't have to torture yourself.

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:11.760
Sahaja yoga is to give you comfort, is to give you bliss of this Divine love.

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:29.000
Third one is a request not a condition that I request you if you can take off your shoes, this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:33.440
You can take out your shoes now.

01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:03.900
[HINDI - Paas mein baitho ya dur baitho, Hum to tumhare saath hain hi.

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:15.340
Yeh Ma ke pyaar ki baat hai. Pyaar mein dur raho ya nazdeek raho,

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.920
sab hriday ke paas hi rehte hain.]

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:29.280
I'm telling Indians that I'm your Mother and I love you like a Mother

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:34.500
whether you are here or you are an Indian, Mother loves you.

01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:53.200
All races everything, all this racialism and all kinds of nonsense, has to go away.

01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:02.520
So the third is, taking out your shoes. I hope you don't mind that - that's a request I said, not a compulsion.

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:12.480
I mean to say, you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself - the main point is.

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.000
Formerly, when I came here

01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:31.860
long time back, I used to break My hands for working on people

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:37.400
but now, the awareness has grown so much, hardly takes any time.

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:42.180
So it's surprising, how this awareness has grown so much.

01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:47.600
So now, please put both your hands towards Me.

01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:55.260
If you want you can take out your spectacles also. Put your both hands towards Me.

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:04.180
Now, bend your head, close your eyes

01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:12.240
and put your right hand on top of your fontanel bone area - bend your head very [UNCLEAR - CLOSE?]

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:19.200
and see with the right hand if there's a cool or hot breeze like

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:25.600
vibrations are coming out of your own head - you have to verify it.

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:34.000
Now, if it is hot, means you have not forgiven yourself and others.

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:41.580
Please try to forgive yourself or others [UNCLEAR] remaining problem. Now,

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:55.300
now please put your right hand towards Me and put the left hand on top of your

01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:02.740
fontanel bone area and also please bend your head. Fontanel bone area is a soft bone

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:11.660
when you were a child and is in the center

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:21.360
of your head. You can see if there is any cool or

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:27.280
hot breeze like vibrations are coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:33.160
Sometimes it is close to head and sometimes it is away from the head

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:39.340
but don't keep the hand on your head - just see if there is

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:46.420
cool or hot breeze-like vibrations coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.820
Now, please put your left hand towards Me.

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:08.680
Now, again close your eyes and bend your head and see with your right hand if there's a cool

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.200
or the hot breeze-like vibrations coming out of your head.

01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:20.500
Don't doubt yourself, please don't doubt - if it is there, it is there.

01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:30.860
Don't feel guilty, please don't feel guilty.

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:41.400
Hmm! Now please open your eyes slowly.

01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:51.720
Please put both your hands towards Me and watch without thinking.

01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:05.260
Every night I've been...

01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:16.400
Now please put both the hands towards the sky and push back your head.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:27.360
Here we have to say one of the three questions, one of the three questions

01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:33.900
three times. The first question is,

01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:42.940
''Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?'' You can call Me Mother or Shree Mataji.

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:53.500
Ask this question three times or, ''Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of Divine Love?''

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:05.340
or, ''Mother, is this,'' - in your heart, in your heart -

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:14.040
''Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya,

01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:19.380
Ruh, Alakh Niranjan?''

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:23.860
Ask any one of these questions three times.

01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:32.340
Now, please bring down your hands.

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:37.940
Now please again put your hands towards Me, keep your eyes open.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:45.600
Some people get it from down so ask them, ask

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:53.500
these vibrations to come up like this - they can come up.

01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:58.440
If they are coming from down below, they can come up like that.

01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:04.940
Now again watch Me without thinking

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:20.420
Now please, all of you who have felt

01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:28.600
cool or breeze-like vibrations on the finger-tips

01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:36.400
or on the palm or out of the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:45.640
All those who have felt cool breeze or hot breeze on the fingers or on the

01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:52.620
palm or out of the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:02.320
All of you - May God bless you, May God bless you!

01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:10.800
So now, you are all realized souls, you are saints except for one or two people. You are all saints

01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:18.740
and all the saints have to know one thing that now they're one with the Divine.

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:24.660
Only thing they have to grow, they have to grow little big.

01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:31.820
We have, as I told you, a nice center here where you can go and you have to master it.

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:38.360
But don't be shifty - because you found it today you should not just give up because will be lost

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:46.120
so better is that now I have found one - I think once a week they have a program, you can go and see for yourself

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:53.500
and then start reading because also sometimes people know everything about sahaja yoga but have no vibrations - that should not be such.

01:43:54.360 --> 01:44:02.260
So I will request you, to understand what is sahaja yog, what are your vibrations are, how are you suffering

01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:09.700
or what you need to be cured, what others are to be done - I'm sure, it will work out in a very big way here.

01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:12.980
Thank you very much! Thank you! May God bless you!

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:20.980
[CLAPPING]

01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:28.600
[CLAPPING]

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:36.440
[INAUDIBLE]

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:44.440
They want to sing one more song, just a song. [UNCLEAR - JOGWA GAAYEGA?]

01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:53.540
This is a very particular song which was organized or I should say, which was composed by

01:44:54.240 --> 01:45:02.220
a very great saint Namadeva, who later on went to Gurunanaka

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:11.920
and he was Maharashtrian but, as a tailor, but he sung the song in all the villages of Maharashtra all the time

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:19.880
which says, ''O Mother! give me the yoga.'' Jogwa means yoga

01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:26.880
and though they sing it they don't know what they are singing about.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:35.220
And though it is in Marathi but it has vibrations because it is written by a very great saint

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:41.980
so, I'm sure, you will enjoy and you can clap with that - it will hardly take any time but it will help you.

01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:54.700
