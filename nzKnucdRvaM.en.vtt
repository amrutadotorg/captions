00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.520
incarnation of Mahalakshmi of a very

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.710
high level

was lady because she came out of the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.470
people I don't know if they think about

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.430
why she was called Maria for the favor

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.430
of I the same way

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:13.709
now this power which came out of the sea

00:02:13.950 --> 00:03:37.320
because according to sahaja yoga

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:43.060
she was the incarnation of mana

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:51.810
she the one who sacrificed her son for

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:57.870
the sake of brilliant but unfortunately

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:01.989
nobody understood her value nobody saw

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:07.329
that she was such a great spiritual

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:10.420
personality only through sahaja yoga you

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:14.390
can understand that she was a very great

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:22.250
personality who gave birth

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:24.600
to Christ like when I told people that

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.180
Christ's mother was the Holy Spirit

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.100
there was not except in a way I said

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.990
what did she do she just used to cry

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.880
every but the Holy Spirit is supposed to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.169
give the elevation to people she didn't

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.990
realize what she was how do you find us

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:44.150
you put your hands to me and ask the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.150
question water washing the Holy Spirit

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:54.240
the man confronts telogen Christ's

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.790
mother was herself an incarnation of

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.400
that but it was not mentioned in the

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.190
Bible because if these Romans or Jews

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.330
had known that she is the one they would

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:12.000
have cut her into pieces and attacked

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:14.300
her so it was not said because Christ

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.860
had to play this drama of crucifixion

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.500
but you can find out after your

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.060
realization through your vibratory

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.370
awareness that whatever I am saying

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:28.770
about them is absolute truth there is so

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.110
much can be said about this mahalakshmi

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:35.370
tattwa we are all blessed so much by

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:41.729
that and so today we remember her great

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:44.880
incarnation as Maria who was very great

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:48.360
because she had to bear terrible pain

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.940
within her heart with all her powers

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.660
that she had she was a tremendously

00:05:50.940 --> 00:06:01.110
powerful lady but despite that she bore

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:06.590
all the tortures of Christ upon her

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:09.599
heart and it was her order and her

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.960
desire that Christ has to crucify

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:17.220
himself so that people could be

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.440
resurrected and sometimes seniors ask me

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.990
what did she do to be Amaya Laxmi what

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.530
did she achieved I said with all her

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:28.490
powers to bear it to play the drama it

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.490
must be too much

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:35.430
he is an angel as you know according to

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:41.550
Christian I would say according to Bible

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:44.310
that he is the angel called Gabriel now

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.509
Gabriel is the one who brought the

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:52.349
message because he is always a missing

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:57.060
to Maria and surprisingly the words he

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:58.319
used we're in my Immaculate asal way

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.180
that's my name

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.069
my first name is dear mala means

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.699
immaculately the answer name is Sal way

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:08.310
he said those words to her

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:08.909
so Maria has to do quite a lot with

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.759
hanumana

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:15.050
all her life that means Maria is a

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.530
Mahalakshmi Mahalakshmi being the Sita

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:22.460
Sita

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:27.990
Narada hanumana has to be there to serve

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:35.330
the imagine Hanuman I as Gabriel had to

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:35.330
go and tell Maria that there's a child

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:45.949
which is the Incarnation the Savior is

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:49.919
going to be born to you she was a young

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:54.630
virgin to break such a news which was

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:59.940
horrible compared to the conditionings

00:07:54.630 --> 00:08:05.900
of those days he did it I have to do

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:05.900
it's all good if that's the order I did

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:16.950
people have started talking against Mary

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.910
by saying that there was something wrong

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:23.590
how could a virgin

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:29.260
it's a child because we do not

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:35.140
understand it is God and in the area of

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:39.580
God anything is possible there about all

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:47.500
these things and they can create

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:52.000
anything and in any way when I had to be

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:58.450
born out of a virgin because it was so

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:01.180
pure people may say that they can't

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:03.190
believe in immaculate birth of Christ

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.230
they cannot believe in the conception of

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:09.730
Christ I mean it's easy for people to

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:12.160
say we don't believe what do they name

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:15.010
know about God what do they know about

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.490
this mysterious ways of doing it can you

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:22.570
say how you convert or transform a

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:27.760
flower into a fruit you don't know

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:32.670
anything about living miracles and you

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.670
start doubting the Immaculate Conception

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:44.050
so much so today that they are making a

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:48.160
film showing Mary to be a prostitute and

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:50.500
this is where you have ended up in India

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.540
even if you say this they'll beat you

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:58.540
nicely anyone whether Muslim Hindu

00:09:52.540 --> 00:10:00.760
Christian how is shocking to hear that

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.880
the way they talk about Christ here I

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:08.440
mean to an Indian it gives a shock how

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:12.310
can you talk because once you give up

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:16.240
your chastity you cannot understand that

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:18.440
there can be someone who's absolutely

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:26.120
chaste

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:29.090
for a thief everybody's a thief because

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:32.960
you don't have that respect for your

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.980
chastity you cannot imagine what Christ

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.930
could have been

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.930
you cannot imagine you cannot accept

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:47.050
unbearable things are said about Christ

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:51.530
I tell you unbearable I don't know I I

00:10:47.050 --> 00:11:34.910
have faced his crucifixion which was

00:10:51.530 --> 00:11:37.340
unbearable and he gave his own color to

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:39.680
Christianity and they really the way he

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:44.540
talked about Christ his mother and all

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:46.100
that was such that nobody can say

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.060
definitely that they were divine

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.640
personalities

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.740
you also didn't like to talk about the

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:55.570
Immaculate Conception which was a fact

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:58.820
and Thomas ran away from there because

00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:03.110
he was surprised the way he was trying

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:06.050
to twist everything to his advantage and

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:08.630
he came down to Egypt where he wrote all

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:11.780
his treaties and put them in a jar there

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:13.400
and then he came to India now about 50

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:17.500
years back they have discovered that jar

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:20.540
and found it out is known as the gnostic

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:23.180
knowledge he used to call them

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:26.450
drumsticks no word means knowledge as

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:32.420
you people are Gnostics those who know

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:40.450
say not mentally but you know hit on us

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:46.900
nerve assist in that book

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:53.120
the Mary is telling them about knowledge

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:56.810
but this Paul objects to it when she

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:59.870
says that this is what you have to

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:06.500
achieve when he doesn't want he's

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:10.100
arguing with her but then Thomas said

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:16.640
that what Christ has said on the cross

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:22.280
behold the mother she is the mother of

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:23.240
Christ and how dare you insult but just

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:28.960
the opposite

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:34.970
Paul never respected women so he

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:38.810
appointed I mean he called her as just a

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:45.350
woman no respect for Mahalakshmi no

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:51.350
respect in the Bible

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:57.710
there is the God Almighty as the Father

00:13:51.350 --> 00:14:04.570
God and we have the Sun God and the

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:09.860
Trinity the third one is a Holy Ghost

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:11.350
but how can you have father and the son

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:18.340
and no mother

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:25.160
the women are called a second citizen

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:28.880
because they say that she was not on the

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:33.380
table of the twelve apostels who were

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:36.200
having the Last Supper but then how do

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:40.010
you have Paul there who was not sitting

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:44.810
on the supper table also but people

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:48.490
could feel the mother of Christ as a

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:54.130
goddess so they called her as Madonna

00:14:48.490 --> 00:15:01.730
and I can't understand those who do not

00:14:54.130 --> 00:15:07.960
want her as the goddess go and worship

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:13.460
her as Black Madonna importantly mother

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:15.710
no not in this feast Athena is the

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:20.540
primordial mother in India

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:29.470
she is not Shakti also in England she

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:42.110
was the white goddess but as a woman

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:45.620
reverses Madonna is exiting so they call

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:48.290
named her Madonna and that's how this

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:52.730
mother Mary was called as Madonna his

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:57.640
maiden means virgin and this Madonna was

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:58.850
then started occupied the place of

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:03.230
churches

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:07.459
everywhere and people regarded her as a

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:09.560
as a goddess it is the people who said

00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:11.600
not in the Bible not in the Christianity

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:15.850
but the people started calling her

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:21.110
Madonna and from that Madonna level that

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:22.120
people started seeing the mother and the

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.430
motherhood

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:30.079
she was Mahalakshmi we know that very

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:34.550
well and we worship her as mothers and

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:39.139
even now the attention of all the people

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:41.810
is on what Christ said or mother made he

00:16:39.139 --> 00:16:47.930
has said it and which has gone through

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:52.009
these horrible people to us so to learn

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:54.399
about other deities and other great

00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:57.319
incarnations you neutralized

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:59.750
you must try to neutralize these too

00:16:57.319 --> 00:17:03.019
much attention by learning about other

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:04.789
dating says Shri Ganesha if you talk

00:17:03.019 --> 00:17:09.289
about Shri Ganesh is the essence of

00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:12.230
Christ you understand that Ganesha is

00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:14.980
the essence of Christ and Christ is the

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:18.520
manifestation of Shri Ganesha as powers

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:23.419
so if you go to the essence most things

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:25.789
that's better so there is no religion to

00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:28.159

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:54.070
