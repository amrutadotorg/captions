00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:17.100
But still you have to have no fear in your mind: trust!

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.860
you trust yourself and trust others.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.540
First of all try to trust yourself.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.620
If you have made mistakes, you have to say,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.260
“Yes, I have made mistakes, all right. So what?”

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.620
Trust yourself that you can correct yourself also.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.420
Trusting doesn’t mean blind ego trip. It does not mean that.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.220
Trust means that “Yes I can correct myself.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.540
I can improve. I can do better.”

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.780
Some people think that if you trust yourself

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.460
then you should never confess anything that you have done wrong.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.820
That you should never say that it was wrong and I can correct.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.540
This is a wrong idea.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.060
You have to trust yourself by saying that,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.500
“Yes I have done mistakes. I have been doing wrong.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.700
I have been faltering but I can correct.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.660
I have that strength within me.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.580
I can rise above all these things.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:31.420
I have that thing within me which I can use to my advantage.”

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.260
Trust yourself.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.500
Trust that you are realized souls.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.580
Trust that God loves you.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.620
That He has chosen you to be His instrument.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.820
Love yourself.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.100
You are unique no doubt.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.620
As it is human beings, every individual is a unique person.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:09.660
But after realization you are definitely unique person.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.660
It never means ego trip.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.540
One has to use discretion about understanding.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.340
It never means ego trip.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.420
If you cannot correct yourself, you are not master of yourself.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.020
Yes you are not perfect.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.460
You are unique but you are not perfect.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.620
You have to perfect yourself.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.020
These words can be very confusing.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.500
When I say you are unique

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.540
immediately, you think you are perfect.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.780
These are two words, unique and perfect.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.860
Somebody can be unique

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.020
but he can have imperfections.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.900
So you have to perfect yourself.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.940
And trust in yourself that you can perfect yourself,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.780
through your kundalini awakening,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.580
clearing your chakras.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.180
By understanding yourself, you can perfect yourself.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.940
You have to perfect.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.500
I have so many ways I tell you; directly,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.620
sometimes indirectly, through friends,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.540
somehow point out that this is the problem with you.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.340
You should think that I am within you.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.460
I am that part within you which is discretion.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.140
When you do not understand your own discretion,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.340
I try to give you the direction by this way or that way.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.020
But people feel hurt. People feel bad

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.020
or, some of them accept it.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.100
If you are seekers and if you are ascending,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.020
you are definitely unique, specially blessed.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.460
And you have to pay special attention to yourself.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.620
You can’t afford to play with yourself.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.940
So you have to discriminate between ego

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.220
or ego trips as they call it

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.020
and ascent.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.860
Ego trips bring you back with the worst hurting.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.660
It would be something like throwing you in the air

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.500
and again you come back with a bump

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.060
and break one of your legs or something like that.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.060
That’s what ego trip is.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.340
But ascent is where you really rise above.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:07.060
Not only that you rise but with you,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.300
you make others rise.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:16.180
In your ascent, you develop tremendous powers.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.500
The higher you ascend the better it is.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.780
But not by understanding that I am perfect you can ascend,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.020
never so.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.180
There’s a story of a teacher and his student.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.140
The teacher was very kind to the student

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.660
and he would come and show him his creations.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.140
He was very kind to him.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.573
And every time he would say that,

00:05:50.654 --> 00:05:52.753
“I have done this good

00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:55.380
and this is the thing that I have not been able to do

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.660
so will you please tell me how to correct it?”

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.500
And the teacher would say, “Yes, good,

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.580
you better correct this part, then do this.”

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.660
And one day the student came and said, “Now this is perfect”.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.500
He said, “You are no more student now.”

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.540
So he said, “No more. You are not to come to me anymore.”

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:35.900
There was another student who was coming every day

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.140
and correcting himself.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.660
And he told to his teacher that,

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.620
“Today I think I can teach others but not yet perfect”.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.700
He said, “All right you go and teach.”

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.060
The third one was a student who came

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.380
and he was always trying to see

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.340
what was the mistake and how he has to correct

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.900
and how he worked very hard, very assiduous, very hard working

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:22.260
and he came to his teacher one day and he said, “Sir,

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.020
I will not trouble you anymore now”.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.780
He said, “True. Now you take my seat.”

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.140
That is what one has to understand.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.380
You ascend. You will become humbler.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.799
It is just the other way around people understand.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.640
You see when they ascend they think we have achieved some special powers.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.700
I don’t know.
Suddenly self-certification starts you see.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.220
I am very good in spirituality.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.940
I am very high up and all that. This self-certificate time.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.820
And then it can reach such a point

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:10.500
that suddenly you found you are on the earth again.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.300
This kind of thing is not the way it works out.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.860
Actually the people who ascend

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:23.700
there are certain qualities that show on them.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.300
The first thing is your collectivity.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.860
How collective you are.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.900
With how many people you can carry on.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.180
At how many things you can laugh.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.100
That is one of the biggest quali ties.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.420
The second quality is that how much you accept

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.900
another’s domination who cuts down your collectivity.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.380
You must have your personality separate from everyone.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:06.180
If you allow others to cut your personality,

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.620
say for example, there is a boss and you are the,

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.380
you are the employee.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.140
And the boss is not realized soul and you are a realized soul.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.620
Or maybe both are realized souls.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.380
Take it like that.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:30.060
And one of them is ascending.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.020
Then he becomes humbler, he becomes better,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.260
there are congenial relationship. But to a point.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.980
He will never compromise with his boss

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.820
when it comes to his ascent, to his collectivity,

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.500
to his giving, to his doing things for others.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:53.140
On that point he’ll never have any domination

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:59.900
because how much you feel responsible about yourself

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.660
is the second point.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.260
How much you are responsible to be there,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.780
to be a cell in the heart.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:18.620
Any cell that fails, fails the heart.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:26.380
Every cell in the heart has to be extremely sensitive

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.260
and extremely obedient

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.740
to the Self, to the Spirit.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.140
It has to activate, work harder

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.820
when there is need there emergency.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.900
That it enjoys the most.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.700
And no impurity should be allowed,

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.620
the third point now.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.540
As I told you first is collectivity,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.540
secondly your responsibility

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.580
and third point is purity.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.820
Purity of your own heart first of all,

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:19.660
of your own heart, about sincerity, cunningness.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.820
As I am saying this you will be realizing that

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:28.540
all Englishmen believe in the contrary,

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.540
nowadays, not olden times, but nowadays.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.300
Clean heart, transparent, open heart.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.260
Trust others.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:48.820
Talk to everyone with an open heart.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:54.020
Trust others.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.260
Why do you doubt?

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.740
If you do not doubt yourself, you’ll not doubt others.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.180
What are they going to take away from you?

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.740
What have you got?

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.140
Nobody can take away your nose, eyes, nothing.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.580
It’s all quite intact.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.500
It’s all nicely glued down.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.980
So nothing is going to disappear.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.180
What are they going to hurt

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:29.780
to a person who is a realized soul?

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.820
If your heart is clean,

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.780
you can see the other person clearly through and through.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.460
Innocence is such a powerful thing,

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.380
such a powerful thing that even a glance

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:50.620
is sufficient to kill a Satan.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.780
Purity of heart,

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.700
actually when the heart becomes impure

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:01.580
the impurity flows down to other places.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.460
It is not the other way round, is from the heart.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.140
Many people believe that it’s the body that becomes impure.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.140
I think it is the heart,

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.540
which becomes really impure,

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.260
and then it starts to cling down to the body

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:24.820
and then it is residual there. It settles down there.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.740
So have a clean open heart like a child’s heart.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.180
Open heart.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.260
What is there to be afraid of anyone?

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:42.620
What is there not to trust anyone?

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.660
What is there to be angry with anyone?

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.020
Talk to everyone, shake hands with everyone,

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.580
be nice to everyone.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.500
On the w ay you find somebody’s difficulty,

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.060
give him a hand.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.180
If somebody cannot sit properly or has a problem

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.940
you try to remove the problem.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:10.540
If the person cannot stand, give the place

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.500
Try to give from your clean heart.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:21.060
If your heart is not clean, it can never give.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:27.780
Now how do you clean the heart is the subject

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.020
which Felicity wanted me to discuss, how to clean the heart.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.860
There is no broom available for that

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:40.580
in the supermarket.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:47.580
There are no Fairy liquids or anything to wash it down.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.500
But there is a way.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.340
Allow your heart to be drenched in your Mother’s love.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.620
Just allow. See how much She loves you.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.860
I trust you.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.820
People laugh at Me sometimes.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.980
Some of these saints who are supposed to be very great people,

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.980
they can’t understand how I trust you.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.100
They say that oh these are all lost cases.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.500
These are horrible people how do you trust them?

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.780
They are not sanyasis,

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.180
they are not sadhus, they are nothing.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
They are ordinary people.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.140
For them I mean your value is nothing.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.140
They’ll if you go to them they will make you stand on your head

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.380
for three months.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.340
For three years, they may hang you on a well.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.940
I don’t know what they will do to test you.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.020
But I trusted you the day I saw you.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.220
The day you came to me I trusted you.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.660
And I worked on you from the very first day,

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.940
knowing what you are

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.660
but I trust your Spirit

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.940
that it would shine.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.140
In the same way, trust. We laugh at others.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.740
I have seen Sahaja Yogis laugh at others;

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.940
make fun of them when they come to Me.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.900
Trust them.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.620
When you will trust them, you will respect them also.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.620
So you have to believe

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:38.900
in yourself and enjoy the way

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.460
gently you are sweeping

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.020
into the current of your Mother’s love.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.300
Just enjoy that.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:57.220
Like a flower that falls into the current

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:03.780
and flows and enjoys all the beauties of that current.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:12.140
In the same way, you should enjoy.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.660
When that enjoyment comes into you,

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.340
you will start trusting.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:25.460
And trust your Mothe r.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.260
I try many things to correct you.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.060
But trust in one thing, that

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:38.140
whatever I try for you or do anything,

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:44.180
anything I may do for you it is just to clean you.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:49.420
That’s My job.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.300
May sometimes you might feel

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.900
I am publicly saying things for you.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.740
May be your images are being ruined by that

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.900
or whatever you may think.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.940
That’s not the way,

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.820
is for your hitha,

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.780
is for the well-being of your Spirit.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:19.180
And that is the most difficult job.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:31.940
With all this, trust in your heart.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.940
First trust yourself,

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.380
trust others,

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.300
other Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.140
Love thy neighbor as thyself.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.940
Who is your neighbor? He is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.620
Stand by him.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.180
And trust your Mother.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.460
As I have trusted you,

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.900
you have to trust Me,

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.340
and it will work out.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:15.500
Open your heart to this trust.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.260
You should not worry

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.820
whether it would be protocolish all right or not,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:32.060
whether it would be absolutely respectable or not,

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.700
because heart knows.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.500
Whatever your heart will do

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.220
in its genuine form will be respectable,

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.140
because there resides your Spirit, which manifests.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.900
That will look after you.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.860
By outer forms, whatever you try

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.300
is not going to work out.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:58.260
It is that trust in your loving heart

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.860
that is going to work. It doesn’t matter.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.780
You see today she brought some flowers.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.380
There were some supposed to be weeds according to her.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:13.060
She went to the station and there she was taking some flowers out.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.526
And the station master and his wife were very sweet

00:20:16.607 --> 00:20:19.911
and they said, “Oh go ahead.
They are only weeds you can have them.”

00:20:19.992 --> 00:20:21.632
And they are so fragrant.

00:20:21.713 --> 00:20:24.860
One of the most fragrant flowers I have ever seen.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.940
They are just weeds.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.180
They do not conform to any formal flowers,

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:37.180
but just few flowers attached to other flowers were most fragrant.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:42.020
Love gives all the sophistication and the fragrance

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.700
and all the breeding that is required.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:53.220
Not talking of love but really loving is the way,

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.740
it's most enjoyable.
