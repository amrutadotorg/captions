1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:09,711
When you put in an effort, you stand against becoming.

2
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:25,127
For example, if I have to cure you

3
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:29,627
I just put my hand and finished – no effort,

4
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:38,127
because I am that.

5
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:44,792
You get your realisation because I am that.

6
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:52,752
I don’t put in any effort, I don’t think about it, I am that.

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,669
Just looking at someone, it can be done.

8
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,544
Just putting attention to someone, it can be done.

9
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:21,585
Just with a small desire, it can be done –

10
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:30,793
because you are that. You can mould it the way you like.

11
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,960
You can get an example from gold.

12
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:43,793
Now gold is untarnishable

13
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:46,876
It does not have to think it is untarnishable,

14
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:51,043
it does not have to put in an effort it is untarnishable – it is.

15
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:10,752
So to be, to be, you don’t have to put in any effort.

16
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:14,835
If you have to put in an effort, that means you are not yet that.

17
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:29,419
If you look at the sun – it shines.

18
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:34,711
It doesn’t have to put in effort to shine – it shines.

19
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:46,711
So to be that, if you have to put in an effort,

20
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:50,711
that means you are not that, you are trying, you are artificial.

21
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:05,460
The flowers are beautiful so they don’t have to beautify themselves.

22
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:16,210
And this is what one has to understand – that innately

23
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:20,876
if you are that,  if you have already become,

24
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:23,793
then what is the need to put in any more effort?

25
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:38,752
But when we say these things, you see,

26
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,544
then people think you have to be lethargic,

27
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:53,502
that you need not do anything,

28
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,043
you become a Guru without doing anything.

29
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:06,502
That’s why, at the very outset, I said it goes in stages.

30
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:16,294
So the first stage is of Shri Ganesha –

31
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:23,792
how He surrenders to the Shakti, to the Mother –

32
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:31,627
that is the beginning. If one cannot surrender…

33
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:34,210
That doesn’t mean you don’t do anything,

34
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,377
but surrendering means the worship,

35
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,585
the respect of the higher,

36
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:59,669
the obedience to the higher.

37
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,544
Not to argue it out,

38
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:12,918
not to react, acceptance,

39
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,669
absorption. Like a child absorbs the milk of the mother

40
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,918
without questioning, without reasoning.

41
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:33,752
That’s why Christ has said, “You have to become like children”.

42
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:41,585
But if you are questioning, then you are no more a child.

43
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:45,335
So first is the state,

44
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:48,876
which you have to develop, is the child-like state.

45
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,502
But child, which is a realised child, which has to have a gravity.

46
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:08,085
If you can develop childhood first,

47
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:11,669
then everything takes proper course,

48
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,792
because maturity cannot take place unless

49
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,669
and until you start from the very beginning,

50
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,377
and gravity means maturity not frivolousness.

51
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:47,752
So now the quality of Ganesha, as you know,

52
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,252
is that He has viveka, means He has discretion.

53
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,669
He ‘has’ means He is discretion.

54
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:07,669
So try to develop your discretion power

55
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:21,377
so that Shri Ganesha gives you the wisdom – subuddhi – wisdom.

56
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:30,876
And this is why you have to have a dependence on Shri Ganesha.

57
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:41,752
So at this point you have to make a negation of efforts.

58
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:52,127
Like, whatever are efforts anti-Ganesha,

59
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,792
or anti-innocence must be negated.

60
00:08:04,335 --> 00:08:12,168
So the negation of effort

61
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:18,585
is to be achieved by negating whatever is the effort –

62
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:27,792
means the effort of negation.

63
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:35,168
So in the beginning you will not be effortless,

64
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:46,627
you will have to put in effort for that.

65
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:55,711
Like Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

66
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:09,669
So how do you make your eyes innocent?

67
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:19,793
In Sahaja Yoga we have a method by which we try to distract our eyes

68
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:26,294
from effort that makes it adulterous.

69
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:40,627
Like, we try to put our attention, our eyes,

70
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:44,585
on the Mother Earth, on the grass, on the trees.

71
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:56,419
So the avoidance, the avoiding of the effort itself is effort.

72
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,793
So those people who have come now,

73
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:12,793
recently, have to understand also that they have to put in

74
00:10:13,002 --> 00:10:16,419
all kinds of efforts to stop the efforts.

75
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:33,168
For example, some people are used to very comfortable life,

76
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:35,876
they may talk of all kinds of renunciation,

77
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:39,127
when it comes to comfort, they want to have comfort.

78
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:52,294
Such people should try to get out of the habit of comfort –

79
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:55,711
Sleep on the ground, sleep on the Mother Earth.

80
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:18,210
Some people have an attention

81
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:20,419
which is all the time looking this side, that side –

82
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:23,002
cannot see to one point – so fix your attention.

83
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:41,711
So gradually, you will find, you’ll discipline yourself.

84
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:51,168
So the effort that you put in

85
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:55,876
is very important in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga.

86
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:06,460
Another thing is very common, in the West,

87
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:09,627
is the harsh tongue, the sarcasm

88
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:15,627
and hurting others – is a very subtle way of violence.

89
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,502
Or if they are really blunt

90
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:35,502
they can start with ego expressions also “I, I, I…”

91
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:44,669
Such people should stop talking

92
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:48,127
completely, make an effort to stop – just don’t talk.

93
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,502
Now watch your mind – is it

94
00:12:56,752 --> 00:13:00,502
is it trying to talk something sarcastic, nonsensical?

95
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:14,168
So, this watching also requires effort.

96
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:25,085
So, to sprout the seed is easy,

97
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:30,168
but then one has to put in the effort to look after the little plant.

98
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:48,460
And when it matures, then it’s on its own.

99
00:13:55,377 --> 00:14:00,627
So the, first the effort should be made to protect yourself

100
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:04,127
against the mind which you have built in,

101
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,252
through your ego or superego,

102
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:10,711
that goes into the wrong direction of effort.

103
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:30,585
But sometimes, be very careful, you have to be discreet.

104
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:44,918
And the best way to be safe on discretion is to keep in the centre –

105
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,502
never go to any extreme of anything.

106
00:14:58,043 --> 00:15:01,252
For example, some people are fond of music, say,

107
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:05,335
so they’ll go on after the music part of it.

108
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:13,335
Some people, say, are fond of poetry,

109
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:16,460
then they’ll go after the poetry only.

110
00:15:23,711 --> 00:15:25,960
There is nothing wrong in those things,

111
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:30,669
but whatever you achieve in all these things

112
00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:33,002
must be brought back to the collective

113
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,544
and must be enjoyed by everyone,

114
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:39,876
and you should also enjoy what others have found.

115
00:15:55,544 --> 00:16:01,460
For example, somebody is a very learned man and a dry person.

116
00:16:08,544 --> 00:16:13,752
So he has to make an effort to make himself sweet.

117
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:24,252
So try to neutralise your extreme nature by coming in the centre,

118
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:36,752
and the best way to say is, “I like everything.

119
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:48,793
The way You keep me, I am happy in that state.”

120
00:16:56,585 --> 00:17:01,502
And to suggest yourself that, “I am the peace”

121
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:06,043
– suggest, autosuggestion,

122
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:18,544
“I am the satisfaction, I am the dignity.”

123
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:24,127
Try to impose these artificialities upon yourself

124
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,502
of these virtues and righteousness,

125
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:47,168
and then ask yourself “If I am dignified how can I do such a thing?”

126
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:51,876
Ask yourself, you judge yourself with those.

127
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:07,460
For example, somebody is a miserly person

128
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,876
and he says, “Oh you must be generous” –

129
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:12,210
then you can call him a hypocrite.

130
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:22,793
But supposing the miserly, you see, questions himself

131
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:25,918
then he is not a hypocrite.

132
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:42,419
So when you put all these artificial, so-called,

133
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:48,585
values upon yourself – sort of a goal –

134
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:53,252
and then try to achieve that goal through your own effort,

135
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:55,792
then you become that.

136
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:25,544
So automatically you criticise yourself and you don’t criticise others

137
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:35,460
and you know what’s wrong with you.

138
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:41,793
Because, what’s the use of knowing what’s wrong with others?

139
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:49,711
It is like England trying to improve the conditions in India,

140
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:53,294
and India trying to improve the conditions in England.

141
00:19:57,252 --> 00:20:00,918
But in this also human brain has an escape.

142
00:20:04,918 --> 00:20:08,210
When they want to criticise themselves, they find a pouch

143
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,335
called the left Vishuddhi and become settled there.

144
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:26,168
The more cunning you are, the more clever you are,

145
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:28,544
the worse is the left Vishuddhi.

146
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:38,002
Then you put everything there, settled down nicely to stagnate,

147
00:20:38,377 --> 00:20:40,711
to get all kinds of filth in it

148
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:44,210
and to be settled with yourself nicely.

149
00:20:56,585 --> 00:20:58,585
It’s like any lousy housewife –

150
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:00,335
she takes all the dirt of the house

151
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:03,377
and all that and piles up into a room, locks it up,

152
00:21:03,711 --> 00:21:06,043
and thinks,  oh she has been very efficient.

153
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,085
You have to face it and you have to correct it and see to it!

154
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:29,502
And that’s how you become powerful.

155
00:21:31,502 --> 00:21:33,835
Because if your machinery is out of gear,

156
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:37,210
what’s the use of improving somebody else’s machinery?

157
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:44,294
And when your machinery is out of gear,

158
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:46,002
you put it in a lock and key,

159
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:48,627
and lock it up and say, “Now it’s alright.”

160
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:59,627
Or you blame somebody because of this, because of that –

161
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:02,544
something else other than you.

162
00:22:10,793 --> 00:22:15,043
Thank God to Sahaja Yoga today that you all have got realisation,

163
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:18,294
so I don’t have to do all that cleaning, you can do yourself.

164
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:30,252
So, in short, you become your own Guru to begin with.

165
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:36,627
You try to tell yourself, separate yourself from yourself

166
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:41,544
and say, “Hello Sir, how are you now, come along.”

167
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:54,252
But in Sahaja Yoga, you see, people

168
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:59,793
suddenly assume, you see, a big sort of a ego nonsense,

169
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:01,752
and they think they are big gurus,

170
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,793
you see, big, great people, avadhutas, you see, like that.

171
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:16,835
And if you ask them,

172
00:23:17,002 --> 00:23:19,627
they say, “Mother, Mother I loved You very much.”

173
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:31,752
So they think if they love Me, then it is My duty

174
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,419
that I should really keep you clean.

175
00:23:43,043 --> 00:23:46,502
That’s not the attitude of a guru.

176
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:54,627
What guru does, is to purify himself and others

177
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:59,210
and give those flowers to the Deity.

178
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,377
Till you all become gurus, I am your Guru,

179
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:12,168
but once you become the guru

180
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:15,335
then I become your Deity.

181
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:26,918
Till they are not yet gurus, I am their Guru.

182
00:24:27,627 --> 00:24:29,335
Till they reach that state.

183
00:24:29,627 --> 00:24:33,960
Once they become the guru, then I am their Deity.

184
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:49,627
Like all the Gurus, we can say Mohammad sahib –

185
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:53,168
He talked of “Allah Hu Akbar.”

186
00:24:57,294 --> 00:24:59,918
He talked of the Holy Ghost,

187
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:04,294
He talked of the resurrection,

188
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,460
because He was a Guru.

189
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:12,210
And whatever He had to say, He said it with full confidence

190
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,043
pointing out towards the point where

191
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:19,502
He looks, or where He gets His guidance from.

192
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:35,960
Like Moses, like Christ also put His two fingers denoting His Father

193
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:43,502
So till you become your own guru,

194
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:48,502
you have to put in effort in the beginning.

195
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,752
Then gradually you can achieve it effortlessly.

196
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:09,793
Effortlessness is not to be certified,

197
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,419
but you can verify it.

198
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,043
A person who is discrete –

199
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,960
in his presence others become discrete.

200
00:26:30,377 --> 00:26:36,585
A person who is honest – others in his presence become honest.

201
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:45,627
It is said in Sanskrit language, ‘Yatha raja tatha praja’ –

202
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:49,252
‘As the king is that’s how the subjects are’.

203
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:59,043
When you are the guru, you are the example.

204
00:27:02,043 --> 00:27:04,792
You have to be the example.

205
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:09,043
Now I have seen people who are gurus, who think,

206
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,043
call themselves gurus, in different varieties and different

207
00:27:12,294 --> 00:27:14,792
types of life: like professors, teachers,

208
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,210
you can call them, not spiritual gurus.

209
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:31,585
They too, when they try

210
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:35,210
to follow a mundane type of life –

211
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,792
not of something exceptional –

212
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:42,377
then their disciples lose faith in them.

213
00:27:56,918 --> 00:28:00,127
Even political leaders, when they…

214
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:03,918
supposing a political leader is licentious, he has weaknesses,

215
00:28:04,502 --> 00:28:13,043
then the people who try to follow him have no respect.

216
00:28:24,294 --> 00:28:27,043
So they too have to have a personal character,

217
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:30,085
a personal value system.

218
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:42,627
So what about the spiritual gurus then?

219
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:49,918
They have to be excellent people.

220
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:58,502
There should be no two types of life, one outside, one inside.

221
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:09,544
When the outside and inside becomes one, then it is effortless

222
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:21,377
and that is what one has to do –

223
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:27,918
the inside and the outside, one has to work it out from inside.

224
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:37,168
For that you cannot bring the outside inside,

225
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,043
but inside has to go outside.

226
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:48,544
So this is the beginning of antar yoga, the inner yoga.

227
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:57,002
At the second stage you have to become thoughtless.

228
00:30:00,252 --> 00:30:03,792
This is very important in the West

229
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:08,210
because they live in thoughts – they do not have other problems

230
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:10,711
of a gross nature.

231
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:20,460
For example,

232
00:30:20,627 --> 00:30:26,960
they are brought up in such a way that they are frightened of law.

233
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:37,835
They are brought up this way – they’ll keep all their carpets clean,

234
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:39,585
everything clean, you see,

235
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:42,835
very particular about keeping every place clean.

236
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:56,335
All the gross things they keep clean,

237
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:15,043
and then when they try to adjust themselves, they adjust within.

238
00:31:20,918 --> 00:31:23,377
Outwardly they are gentlemanly,

239
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:32,419
but inside, in their thought, they are not clean.

240
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:37,793
In their behaviour they are not clean, their eyes are not clean,

241
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:43,168
it’s poison inside.

242
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,085
And they like that poison to be taken out –

243
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,127
sometimes it comes out as sarcasm,

244
00:31:54,294 --> 00:31:59,294
it comes out as their sinister acts of aggression on other countries.

245
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:09,419
They may plan out the complete destruction of the world

246
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:18,210
and they don’t think there’s anything wrong in it

247
00:32:20,627 --> 00:32:23,419
because it is ‘an ideology’ for which, is a thought

248
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:24,960
they are fighting for.

249
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,502
As long as there is an ideology, there’s a thought,

250
00:32:35,752 --> 00:32:39,711
there’s some sort of a sublime talk, then they can do what they like.

251
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,252
This filth is very sophisticated.

252
00:32:58,252 --> 00:33:01,210
Like the people who don’t take their baths can use some

253
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,627
artificial things to get a fragrance.

254
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:11,876
Inside has to be clean

255
00:33:13,752 --> 00:33:18,792
and that’s why first the efforts are to be made to have good thoughts.

256
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,043
Watch your mind –

257
00:33:28,918 --> 00:33:31,792
how does it think about others?

258
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:38,669
I would say, racialism is one of the diseases of the same thing.

259
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:48,127
I have seen people who are very well placed,

260
00:33:48,335 --> 00:33:50,960
sophisticated, wear immaculate dresses:

261
00:33:51,252 --> 00:33:57,835
when it comes to a person from a developing country,  or from say,

262
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:04,043
another colour complexion, they come out with a remark,

263
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:09,960
even if they are Sahaja Yogis I have seen they do it.

264
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,210
I am saying this for the Sahaja Yogis and not for others.

265
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:40,960
That suddenly that dead stuff, which we call as dead, becomes alive.

266
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,252
So the mind is dirty,

267
00:34:53,585 --> 00:35:00,460
full of lust, greed, and anger, jealousy –

268
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:08,960
and that’s why we have to be very, very careful.
Those people who have become sophisticated

269
00:35:09,252 --> 00:35:12,627
their weaknesses have also become sophisticated,

270
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:22,335
and that’s why jealousy is a common disease.

271
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:28,294
Like the other day I asked someone,

272
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:31,335
“Why the father is angry with the son,

273
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:41,419
and with his own brother?”

274
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:43,793
So the answer was, “Because

275
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:48,377
the brother is looking after the son in London.”

276
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,210
Normally any person should be thankful

277
00:36:13,502 --> 00:36:17,918
that: somebody is looking after my son in my absence.

278
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:25,835
But the fellow is jealous

279
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:29,043
because of possessiveness

280
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:32,585
and the possessiveness comes out of insecurity,

281
00:36:35,544 --> 00:36:38,460
and insecurity comes within us

282
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:41,960
because we make others insecured.

283
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:53,502
There are many reasons for insecurity,  but one of them is

284
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:57,793
because we are ugly and we see that ugliness in others.

285
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:13,876
Now this inside filth has to be taken out

286
00:37:14,127 --> 00:37:17,502
with greater effort than the outside filth,

287
00:37:25,502 --> 00:37:28,711
and that inside filth

288
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:32,377
you can watch and see within yourself.

289
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:46,419
Some people try to dominate others, to tell them things –

290
00:37:46,669 --> 00:37:49,377
just for the bossiness of it.

291
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:06,335
Now watch out – first of all, have you bossed yourself enough?

292
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:15,002
Have you mastered yourself enough?

293
00:38:17,252 --> 00:38:22,252
Are you master of your own or you are still lacking in that?

294
00:38:30,252 --> 00:38:33,460
Those who have not mastered themselves want to have others,

295
00:38:33,752 --> 00:38:36,294
to master them.

296
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:49,002
But the one who is the master of oneself, need not master anyone.

297
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:54,918
He becomes the master.

298
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:58,835
He doesn’t have to put in any effort, he masters.

299
00:39:03,627 --> 00:39:06,792
And there are so many tricks by which he can master,

300
00:39:11,876 --> 00:39:16,127
so many things by which he can correct.

301
00:39:21,377 --> 00:39:28,544
He may not say, he may not do anything, but just he manages.

302
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,460
Everyone learns a lesson without his doing anything about it.

303
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:52,585
But they know that somebody is a master of masters.

304
00:39:57,876 --> 00:40:00,419
Maybe, such a person will be very unassuming

305
00:40:00,669 --> 00:40:03,168
simple, innocent looking,

306
00:40:13,502 --> 00:40:18,627
but that’s Mahamaya, that’s the illusion.

307
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:26,669
So, the person who is that power doesn’t want to show it outside,

308
00:40:35,585 --> 00:40:43,544
on the contrary, it shows in such a way that people know it.

309
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,085
I mean, the way things happen in life,

310
00:40:56,377 --> 00:41:00,918
we start understanding that we don’t have to put up any show –

311
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:14,002
someone knows everything.

312
00:41:16,669 --> 00:41:21,711
When we have someone like that, try to follow.

313
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:34,585
So, in the third stage the effort should be to follow your Guru

314
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:45,294
who is a Sat Guru.

315
00:41:49,085 --> 00:41:55,711
Now that one becomes the one…a pattern, which you have to follow.

316
00:41:59,835 --> 00:42:03,960
But in this also Sahaja Yogis can be very superficial.

317
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:13,377
One of the Sahaja Yogis used to wear a shawl in a particular way.

318
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:16,085
So, I sent him some other sahaja yogis that

319
00:42:16,377 --> 00:42:19,793
he will try to help them, he can be their guru;

320
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:24,960
they all started wearing shawls the same way.

321
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:50,168
It’s not the outside; you have to follow the inside.

322
00:42:52,792 --> 00:43:00,792
So when you become the guru, become the guru, you become.

323
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,502
It’s such a short method – just to become.

324
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:14,711
Now if you face yourself, you’ll know

325
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:18,127
that there are still some steps you have to cross to become.

326
00:43:23,752 --> 00:43:25,960
Even now when I am lecturing to you,

327
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,544
you are thinking of others – “Oh, Mother is talking about him” –

328
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:31,752
not about yourself.

329
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:45,669
That is how one has to take it inside, the absorption

330
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,585
from your Guru, that you have to see yourself.

331
00:43:58,085 --> 00:44:01,792
Now, that is very important

332
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:07,793
if we have to become the prophets who will make others prophets.

333
00:44:16,127 --> 00:44:22,544
Now, the higher stage is that your Guru becomes a Deity.

334
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,502
When you say “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara“.

335
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:30,627
They go up to that point but nobody says “Guru is Devi”.

336
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:35,502
You can have a higher stage, than Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

337
00:44:51,168 --> 00:44:56,711
Because the Guru state is where you have the innocence of all these

338
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,711
Brahma and Mahesha and Vishnu –

339
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,711
their power of innocence.

340
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:19,085
But then ultimately they say, “Guru Sakshat Parabrahma”.

341
00:45:25,603 --> 00:45:27,998
And Parabrahma is the power of the Mother

342
00:45:28,412 --> 00:45:32,203
Not only by becoming but now,

343
00:45:32,661 --> 00:45:36,203
becoming the reflector of your Deity,

344
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:52,412
to develop yourself into the reflector from guru to that state.

345
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:10,370
At that state you start controlling all the elements.

346
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:22,328
That’s why all these incarnations of Adi Guru

347
00:46:22,661 --> 00:46:25,744
had control over elements.

348
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:37,328
Brahmadeva is absolutely manifested through them.

349
00:46:41,328 --> 00:46:47,078
So out of Ganesha, which is the Adi Guru,

350
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:50,494
He is born,

351
00:46:50,786 --> 00:46:55,953
or He is manifested through these three – Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha –

352
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:14,995
and then He comes out as Brahmadeva with four heads,

353
00:47:22,328 --> 00:47:28,412
three of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, and the fourth of Shri Ganesh.

354
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:41,995
So Brahmadeva becomes the symbol of Guru,

355
00:47:45,953 --> 00:47:51,703
and as you know Ganesha is chatvari, is four –all the time.

356
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:56,328
He becomes these four – in expression, in manifestation.

357
00:48:03,786 --> 00:48:07,744
And as you become Brahmadeva, at that stage

358
00:48:08,036 --> 00:48:10,911
you control all the elements.

359
00:48:20,412 --> 00:48:24,661
So, today I have tried to explain to you the different

360
00:48:24,953 --> 00:48:31,869
stages of gurupada – the state of guru.

361
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:45,536
And one should understand whatever we are today,

362
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:52,120
we are extremely blessed and fortunate people

363
00:49:00,786 --> 00:49:06,120
that, in this short time, you started from a scratch

364
00:49:06,494 --> 00:49:12,619
in the mud and you have become the lotuses.

365
00:49:21,494 --> 00:49:25,120
The lotus will invite many insects

366
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:29,953
and will convert them into lotuses.

367
00:49:33,744 --> 00:49:35,911
madhukar they call it, madhukar,

368
00:49:36,203 --> 00:49:40,412
the ones who are selecting the madhu, the nectar,

369
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:43,078
the… what do you call? – the honey.

370
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:03,078
When they get the nectar, they become themselves the lotuses.

371
00:50:12,412 --> 00:50:20,120
The whole dirty, filthy pond is covered with those lotus flowers.

372
00:50:29,453 --> 00:50:33,328
And one lotus, who is the Guru, grows higher,

373
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:43,828
and then is given to the Goddess on which She resides.

374
00:50:52,245 --> 00:50:57,286
She resides in the heart on the platform,

375
00:50:57,577 --> 00:51:00,786
beautiful platform that this lotus has created.

376
00:51:06,245 --> 00:51:11,412
But to bear Her on your heart, you have to have a heart.

377
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:21,493
There are so many qualities of a Guru, which I have told you.

378
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:27,953
All the best qualities, the twelve qualities of all the sides

379
00:51:28,412 --> 00:51:31,869
should be completely manifested in a Guru,

380
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:42,828
and the owner of those qualities is Shiva.

381
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:49,453
So that is how the essence of Shiva,

382
00:51:49,661 --> 00:51:52,744
out of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, the Mahesha’s qualities,

383
00:51:52,995 --> 00:51:54,744
should shine through you.

384
00:52:04,828 --> 00:52:06,619
The Vishnu’s qualities of Dharma –

385
00:52:06,828 --> 00:52:10,661
first you have to make an effort to be dharmic, to be balanced.

386
00:52:19,245 --> 00:52:22,577
Then you ascend.

387
00:52:24,493 --> 00:52:28,412
Then you become one with the Viraata

388
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:35,453
and then you can give Dharma to others.

389
00:52:40,286 --> 00:52:43,786
So one has to know that stage-by-stage it happens to you

390
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,536
and you do not become a hypocrite.

391
00:52:53,619 --> 00:52:56,453
But you become real

392
00:52:59,078 --> 00:53:04,536
and the reality is shown by its own being.

393
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:10,203
That is how you become.

394
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:15,744
So understand the reality within yourself, face it, solve it.

395
00:53:16,078 --> 00:53:18,619
But mostly, I have seen, when I tell anybody,

396
00:53:18,786 --> 00:53:20,203
“No, Mother I am not like that.

397
00:53:20,453 --> 00:53:23,661
No Mother, I didn’t say like that, that is not true!”

398
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,744
Some such people would like to sit in front

399
00:53:40,995 --> 00:53:43,245
or sort of try to show off or anything,

400
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:44,493
but that is not important.

401
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:46,911
What is important is how much you know yourself,

402
00:53:47,078 --> 00:53:48,911
it is Self-realisation.

403
00:54:00,536 --> 00:54:05,036
Once you develop that, then you know the others in the real way

404
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,161
and not artificially,

405
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:15,493
and then the enjoyment is complete.

406
00:54:17,953 --> 00:54:23,370
Like a bee will never go to an artificial flower.

407
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:30,286
But human beings have to become the bee.

408
00:54:34,911 --> 00:54:43,493
The Guru does not need to say that he’s the Guru.

409
00:54:46,661 --> 00:54:50,286
Today I bless you.

410
00:54:55,703 --> 00:55:00,493
I have completed the twelve years of Guru’s

411
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:07,286
and you should really assume the Shiva’s powers within yourself

412
00:55:22,412 --> 00:55:29,911
I, that is My body, My mind, My heart,

413
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:38,453
everything, has spared no efforts

414
00:55:40,286 --> 00:55:47,577
to completely indulge into this cleansing, into this making,

415
00:55:47,995 --> 00:55:51,328
into this becoming of you people.

416
00:56:00,286 --> 00:56:08,203
I request you now that please do not waste My efforts.

417
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:16,286
Look at yourself, help yourself

418
00:56:18,078 --> 00:56:24,078
and try to rise higher and higher to become your Self.

419
00:56:28,328 --> 00:56:32,120
When you become your Self, then you become the Guru.

420
00:56:35,744 --> 00:56:37,619
And once you become the Guru,

421
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:42,494
you become Brahmadeva , Mahesha and Vishnu.

422
00:56:49,494 --> 00:56:54,911
So first you are made in the pattern of Ganesha,

423
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:59,036
then Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

424
00:57:04,453 --> 00:57:09,120
But very much depends on your readiness to do it

425
00:57:13,203 --> 00:57:20,370
and, most of all, your honesty and sincerity.

426
00:57:21,577 --> 00:57:25,370
I hope Shri Ganesha will give you the wisdom

427
00:57:28,828 --> 00:57:31,953
to understand.

428
00:57:32,493 --> 00:57:37,828
The Shakti will give you shakti to work hard,

429
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:46,869
and Shiva will give you joy, Sadashiva will give you the joy

430
00:57:47,661 --> 00:57:52,536
so that you proceed in your establishment.

431
00:58:01,036 --> 00:58:04,536
May God bless you.
