WEBVTT

00:00.989 --> 00:15.809
…and how it resides within us and how we
are lost in the curtains of Maya.

00:15.809 --> 00:23.609
Today I am going to tell you how we get to
that Spirit.

00:23.609 --> 00:39.540
There are two types of methods people employ
in finding out that Spirit.

00:39.540 --> 00:47.480
One is called as anuvopai, and another one
is called as shaktopai.

00:47.480 --> 00:52.040
‘Anu’ means a molecule.

00:52.040 --> 01:07.900
When we are lost in the Maya, as I had told
you last time, actually the Spirit is eternal,

01:07.900 --> 01:10.170
It is all-powerful.

01:10.170 --> 01:18.509
It never loses Its power whether we are old,
young, whatever condition we may be, the Spirit

01:18.509 --> 01:23.140
has Its own power, all the time.

01:23.140 --> 01:32.060
But, the reflection of the Spirit in us, the
light of the Spirit in us, depends on the

01:32.060 --> 01:37.560
quality of our reflector, how we are.

01:37.560 --> 01:46.259
And because of the quality being so poor sometimes,
darkness is created within us and in that

01:46.259 --> 02:00.960
darkness, we do not know sometimes, even to
that extent, that there is something beyond.

02:00.960 --> 02:10.070
So the first style of seeking is anuvopai
as you call it, which is depending on separating

02:10.070 --> 02:14.980
molecules after molecules.

02:14.980 --> 02:21.470
Because under these circumstances, when you
are surrounded by darkness, you see Spirit

02:21.470 --> 02:26.370
just as a molecule or you can say a spark
or a flicker.

02:26.370 --> 02:30.510
Sometimes you just get a flicker of it.

02:30.510 --> 02:34.200
As you know the thoughts arise within us and
fade away.

02:34.200 --> 02:38.600
We see the thoughts rising and fading away.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.570
And there are many thoughts all around us.

02:41.570 --> 02:47.590
Our attention is on those thoughts, moving
all the time.

02:47.590 --> 02:54.180
It is very hard to find that space in between
two thoughts, that’s why what we see is

02:54.180 --> 03:02.840
just a flicker, you can call it, or a little
atom of that Spirit, sometimes sparkling.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.820
And then the search starts among human beings.

03:05.820 --> 03:14.060
From that darkness, from Tamoguna they start
searching and the kriya (action) starts within

03:14.060 --> 03:15.060
us.

03:15.060 --> 03:27.070
So we can see in the left hand side as you
see the Ida Nadi, by which we live in Tamoguna,

03:27.070 --> 03:39.200
in desiring for it, and then we move to the
right hand side, on the Pingala Nadi, in which

03:39.200 --> 03:45.550
we act.

03:45.550 --> 03:50.870
In that action we try to find the Spirit.

03:50.870 --> 04:03.230
Of course, first we think it is in getting
material advancement that you will find that

04:03.230 --> 04:11.330
Spirit, that flicker, and so we go in for
material advancement.

04:11.330 --> 04:21.000
Now, material advancement is very different
from the spiritual advancement.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.460
Or we can say the material happening, what
we see, like a plane landing or a plane taking

04:29.460 --> 04:42.069
off or a collision of two trains or any such
happenings are outside and spiritual happening

04:42.069 --> 04:49.090
is within.

04:49.090 --> 04:56.620
Our attention is always attracted towards
outside happenings and it is an impossibility

04:56.620 --> 05:05.020
to take this attention inside.

05:05.020 --> 05:14.520
That is why something has to happen within
us to attract that attention inside.

05:14.520 --> 05:26.800
We cannot force our attention inside, so people
try, normally, the anuvopai is that what you

05:26.800 --> 05:37.889
call Ashtanga Yoga and other Yogas, by which
they try separating themselves from myth,

05:37.889 --> 05:54.570
from darkness; for which you need very astute,
honest, sincere people, very young celibate,

05:54.570 --> 06:01.069
innocent people, those who have to live in
the forest with their Gurus.

06:01.069 --> 06:05.719
So they keep out their attention, which is
called as nirodha (restraint).

06:05.719 --> 06:11.580
They stop their attention spreading itself.

06:11.580 --> 06:18.960
They concentrate their attention with the
help of a Realised soul.

06:18.960 --> 06:26.150
If you come to India you’ll meet some real
sages like that who live on top of hills and

06:26.150 --> 06:29.340
mountains, who are not easily available to
people.

06:29.340 --> 06:36.030
They do not sell their religion or they do
not sell their Realisation to people.

06:36.030 --> 06:39.639
Hidden away from the madding crowd, they exist
there.

06:39.639 --> 06:47.279
One of them has told someone, some Sahaja
Yogis that he has practiced anuvopai for twenty-one

06:47.279 --> 06:54.219
thousand years from when he was just a frog!

06:54.219 --> 07:01.069
It’s fantastic that he carried on for twenty-one
thousand years, every year, life, he was born

07:01.069 --> 07:06.411
and still he cannot raise the Kundalini of
others very easily!

07:06.411 --> 07:15.339
Still he does not have the power to raise
the Kundalini the way you Sahaja Yogis can

07:15.339 --> 07:16.339
raise!

07:16.339 --> 07:18.309
It’s most surprising!

07:18.309 --> 07:23.229
He has given Realisation to only one person,
only one.

07:23.229 --> 07:26.910
In twenty five years he worked on him; the
same way, anuvopai.

07:26.910 --> 07:29.559
These are the people who are detached, veetragas.

07:29.559 --> 07:38.139
Not that you have to run way from anywhere,
but living in the society only you can achieve

07:38.139 --> 07:43.169
it through our Sahaja Yoga or Mahayoga.

07:43.169 --> 07:44.629
This is shaktopai.

07:44.629 --> 07:53.659
But these people still are afraid to come
in the cities because they could not make

07:53.659 --> 08:00.469
people understand.

08:00.469 --> 08:08.070
They do not trust human beings and they want
to keep away from them.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.070
They are not married.

08:09.070 --> 08:10.360
They lead a celibate life.

08:10.360 --> 08:14.669
They live up to two hundred years sometimes,
sometimes a thousand years also.

08:14.669 --> 08:23.840
But it is a very individualistic movement,
works on one or two people.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.060
Births after births they cleansed themselves.

08:26.060 --> 08:28.789
This is anuvopai.

08:28.789 --> 08:35.110
So the search for the Divine or for the Spirit
has been on for ages now, it’s not a new

08:35.110 --> 08:38.659
thing that we are doing here.

08:38.659 --> 08:47.290
And you also have been seeking that Divine
in your previous lives and many lives before.

08:47.290 --> 08:52.790
But you must know that for seeking you have
to go inside.

08:52.790 --> 08:54.610
It’s not outside.

08:54.610 --> 09:00.180
And how do you go inside?

09:00.180 --> 09:02.970
Is the problem.

09:02.970 --> 09:05.820
Some people say that if you go on suggesting,
“I’m going inside,” you go inside.

09:05.820 --> 09:18.889
It’s all imagination, because when the attention
is out, the knower and the knowledge, both

09:18.889 --> 09:20.740
are different.

09:20.740 --> 09:23.750
Like if I see this thing now, for example,
if I am not a Realised soul, I’ll see this

09:23.750 --> 09:29.540
one and I will just think, “How much they
must have paid for it?

09:29.540 --> 09:31.870
What is it made of?

09:31.870 --> 09:32.880
From where did they get it?”

09:32.880 --> 09:36.019
All sorts of these superficial things as you
can call it.

09:36.019 --> 09:40.029
At the most somebody might say, “It’s
very aesthetically placed and it has very

09:40.029 --> 09:42.010
great balance,” and all that.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.230
At the most!

09:43.230 --> 09:52.870
But it is all outside, because the knower
who knows about it is outside the knowledge.

09:52.870 --> 10:06.529
So there’s a tremendous difference between
the happening outside and happening inside.

10:06.529 --> 10:12.029
When you see a train colliding you will say,
“Oh, look at this!

10:12.029 --> 10:13.630
What is this they have done?

10:13.630 --> 10:18.730
This driver is wrong!” and that, “These
people have suffered so much,” and all sorts

10:18.730 --> 10:19.730
of things.

10:19.730 --> 10:20.730
You’ll start collecting money.

10:20.730 --> 10:23.620
Whatever we do normally, you see.

10:23.620 --> 10:33.180
But the knowledge about it is outside the
knower that is your Self.

10:33.180 --> 10:43.860
But when the spiritual happening takes place
the knowledge and the knower become one.

10:43.860 --> 10:55.310
For example now this machine that is here,
to a normal person as I told you will be,

10:55.310 --> 10:57.569
“It is so much, it costs so much,” or
whatever it is, you see.

10:57.569 --> 11:02.639
But to a Realised soul it would be, “Is
it vibrating?

11:02.639 --> 11:04.960
Is it emitting vibrations?

11:04.960 --> 11:08.250
What sort of vibrations is it emitting?

11:08.250 --> 11:10.910
It is good or bad?”

11:10.910 --> 11:16.990
Because then you start understanding it according
to spiritual value and not according to material

11:16.990 --> 11:18.300
value.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.510
I hope you understand this point.

11:20.510 --> 11:24.320
Spiritual value is an absolute value.

11:24.320 --> 11:32.880
And what is the measure of that is the spiritual
joy.

11:32.880 --> 11:39.389
The vibrations give you spiritual joy – the
good vibrations, I mean.

11:39.389 --> 11:40.720
What are good vibrations?

11:40.720 --> 11:47.650
Are nothing but the coefficience (sic) of
this whole thing is emitting through it, the

11:47.650 --> 11:53.760
All Pervading Power, which is giving you joy.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.730
It is an absolute value.

11:56.730 --> 12:03.720
You take ten children who are Realised souls:
you tie their eyes and ask them to put their

12:03.720 --> 12:05.069
hands towards one person.

12:05.069 --> 12:11.750
All of them will show you the same finger,
which is burning; whichever is the chakra

12:11.750 --> 12:13.970
they are catching.

12:13.970 --> 12:19.315
There will be no confusion, no second opinion
about it, no quarrelling, because that’s

12:19.315 --> 12:30.209
what it is, because the knower and the knowledge
is the same.

12:30.209 --> 12:36.460
That is why when our attention is outside
and we are seeking something or knowing something,

12:36.460 --> 12:46.529
then we start seeing it according to our thinking
and who does the thinking is Mr. Ego or maybe

12:46.529 --> 12:47.529
Superego.

12:47.529 --> 12:55.769
We are not there to think about it, so anything
you give them, say for example you marry two

12:55.769 --> 13:00.610
persons in modern times.

13:00.610 --> 13:04.160
So they’ll sit down and work it out.

13:04.160 --> 13:08.350
How can you work out a marriage with your
brains?

13:08.350 --> 13:09.490
It’s a question of your heart.

13:09.490 --> 13:10.490
Just enjoy it.

13:10.490 --> 13:14.959
You give them food, they’ll sit down and
work it out, start analysing it.

13:14.959 --> 13:18.769
They cannot synthesise it.

13:18.769 --> 13:23.160
The food will get cold, it will lose all its
taste and the whole thing will be wasted.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.639
They make the same thing out of their lives.

13:25.639 --> 13:29.720
For nothing at all they create problems by
thinking.

13:29.720 --> 13:37.850
Analysis starts outside, synthesis starts
inside.

13:37.850 --> 13:45.100
Now this nirodha is the withdrawing of your
attention inside as I told you is only possible

13:45.100 --> 13:46.290
through a happening within.

13:46.290 --> 13:50.779
Now how do you get the happening within yourself?

13:50.779 --> 13:56.269
For example, I am talking to you, you are
paying attention to Me: supposing something

13:56.269 --> 13:59.740
falls down, immediately your attention goes
to that happening.

13:59.740 --> 14:02.230
So there has to be some happening within.

14:02.230 --> 14:10.310
Now, what is that happening, is Kundalini
Yoga, and this Kundalini Yoga is the shaktopai,

14:10.310 --> 14:16.390
is the, is known as shaktipath, is the giving
of the Shakti.

14:16.390 --> 14:22.259
Very few are entitled with this, I mean today
these are all selling ‘shaktis’ there.

14:22.259 --> 14:28.110
There have their ashramas, and this that,
they are talking of shakti, when that people

14:28.110 --> 14:32.240
start dancing, jumping, screaming like possessed
people.

14:32.240 --> 14:35.149
That is not Shakti at all.

14:35.149 --> 14:46.069
Only a person of a very high quality can raise
the Kundalini because he is to be authorised

14:46.069 --> 14:48.079
by God.

14:48.079 --> 14:58.130
It’s a very rare thing to give Realisation
to people.

14:58.130 --> 15:07.300
Only such people who have been authorised
by God can just move the Kundalini straight

15:07.300 --> 15:08.720
forward.

15:08.720 --> 15:21.080
So the anuvopai is a very slow action, is
for few individuals who get out of this maya,

15:21.080 --> 15:28.189
this illusion and tell people that, “This
is all illusion, is a mirage, you are running

15:28.189 --> 15:29.189
after a mirage.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.899
Don’t run after this mirage.”

15:31.899 --> 15:35.860
But still, people can’t believe them.

15:35.860 --> 15:41.040
They crucify them, they poison them, they
beat them, they do all kinds of things to

15:41.040 --> 15:42.079
them.

15:42.079 --> 15:47.980
I mean, they did not do any harm to anyone
whatsoever that they should be treated so

15:47.980 --> 15:54.329
badly by human beings.

15:54.329 --> 16:05.570
So, it is to be understood that your attention
has to be sucked in.

16:05.570 --> 16:11.930
The nirodha has to work out.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.829
Not by denying things, “Don’t look at
the women.”

16:14.829 --> 16:16.990
“Don’t look at the gold.”

16:16.990 --> 16:20.060
“Don’t look at things, your attention
will be spoiled.”

16:20.060 --> 16:21.290
Not by those methods.

16:21.290 --> 16:27.319
Or by taking you to the jungles, leading you
a celibate life, making a very holy atmosphere

16:27.319 --> 16:34.450
around and just forcing you that you do not
see that [which] is evil.

16:34.450 --> 16:41.240
But when you see it again you go back to the
same!

16:41.240 --> 16:44.589
There’s no immunity developed.

16:44.589 --> 16:53.740
So the attention when it’s sucked in by
Kundalini rising, the first thing you notice

16:53.740 --> 16:57.279
is that there is dilatation of the pupil.

16:57.279 --> 17:03.199
Now, dilatation of the pupil will cause a
kind of a blindness, normally.

17:03.199 --> 17:08.429
There was a lady doctor who had come for her
Realisation to me once and I tried to raise

17:08.429 --> 17:10.520
her Kundalini, it wouldn’t go beyond Agya.

17:10.520 --> 17:16.839
While she was driving suddenly she felt that
her eyes were dilating and she couldn’t

17:16.839 --> 17:23.380
see, so she took her car on one side and she
said , “For about a minute I just could

17:23.380 --> 17:25.360
not see anything, I was quite worried.

17:25.360 --> 17:29.220
I felt my dilatation of the pupil is taking
place and I was worried about it that how

17:29.220 --> 17:30.220
I’ve become blind.”

17:30.220 --> 17:36.430
And then again she got back but when she went
back, she was seeing much better and there

17:36.430 --> 17:40.760
was a sparkle in her eyes, eyes were sparkling.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.460
She telephoned to me, she said , “Does it
happen?”

17:43.460 --> 17:44.840
I said , “Yes.”

17:44.840 --> 17:53.010
To attract your attention from outside inward,
Kundalini does that to you, that She dilates

17:53.010 --> 17:54.830
your pupil.

17:54.830 --> 18:01.630
Now the doctors may come on my head and say
that it is a parasympathetic or a sympathetic

18:01.630 --> 18:02.630
action.

18:02.630 --> 18:03.630
They do not know, they have not yet decided.

18:03.630 --> 18:06.340
It’s the action of Kundalini.

18:06.340 --> 18:10.559
They don’t know about Kundalini.

18:10.559 --> 18:12.779
Even if you show them pulsating they will
not believe it.

18:12.779 --> 18:14.309
They don’t want to believe it.

18:14.309 --> 18:16.500
They want to remain outside, in ignorance.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.830
All of them are like that.

18:19.830 --> 18:25.540
Now, everybody is saying that now outside
battles are over, we have to have battle inside,

18:25.540 --> 18:28.100
we have to fight ourselves.

18:28.100 --> 18:34.270
Anywhere you go they will say that, “We
must find our wholesomeness.”

18:34.270 --> 18:36.659
Oh, big lectures you know!

18:36.659 --> 18:39.419
Conferences after conferences people are talking
so big!

18:39.419 --> 18:42.039
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

18:42.039 --> 18:48.490
But when it comes to reality that you can
have it, it’s a very slow movement [but]

18:48.490 --> 18:49.820
still better than anuvopai!

18:49.820 --> 19:00.220
By anuvopai [those] who are living in the
city they will not reach anywhere, they cannot.

19:00.220 --> 19:04.500
If you try to do all those things, if you
do not have a Realised soul as your guru and

19:04.500 --> 19:10.850
also the atmosphere, either you’ll get into
ego or into superego; you’ll have a problem

19:10.850 --> 19:20.010
there, either onto to the left or onto the
right.

19:20.010 --> 19:23.240
Supposing you tell them , “Now, don’t
drink, don’t smoke!”

19:23.240 --> 19:26.720
Immediately you will get conditioned and Mr.
Freud will stand up and say, “See, you are

19:26.720 --> 19:28.039
conditioned, you should have all the freedom!”

19:28.039 --> 19:29.039
Alright.

19:29.039 --> 19:31.980
So you go ahead [and] do whatever you please.

19:31.980 --> 19:38.409
So your Mr. Ego will become like a big balloon
on your head if you do whatever you please.

19:38.409 --> 19:42.790
And then you have a big forehead coming out,
eating everyone out like that.

19:42.790 --> 19:49.059
(laughing) And I have given a nice speech
on Mr. Ego, how it tries to strangle everyone

19:49.059 --> 19:50.820
and how we are raising against everyone.

19:50.820 --> 19:58.289
This Mr. Ego gives us the feeling that we
are something and that is the one which keeps

19:58.289 --> 20:01.260
us in bondage of ignorance.

20:01.260 --> 20:07.230
And it’s like, I sometimes feel, like the
fist of a boxer!

20:07.230 --> 20:11.740
Anybody tries to go near it, it gives you
a bang back!

20:11.740 --> 20:15.890
Anybody tries to say anything about it, it
will come out with a big bang on your head.

20:15.890 --> 20:22.080
So if you do not pay attention to your ego
and say, “No, no, no, no, I must not eat

20:22.080 --> 20:24.740
this, I must not do this, I must not do that,”
finished!

20:24.740 --> 20:28.510
You go onto the left hand side and then you
get the conditioning and then you may fall

20:28.510 --> 20:32.570
into the traps of Mr. Rajneesh or someone
like that, who is conditioning you.

20:32.570 --> 20:35.120
And you cannot get out of it.

20:35.120 --> 20:42.960
You try your level best, you cannot get out
of it, because they entrap you with their

20:42.960 --> 20:47.549
hypnosis, you go into your superego, you are
hypnotised, you are possessed and whatever

20:47.549 --> 20:52.520
you may try, all such people are very difficult
for Sahaja Yoga.

20:52.520 --> 21:00.179
They think I don’t know what they are doing,
but it is not my knowing, it is your knowing

21:00.179 --> 21:01.179
is the point.

21:01.179 --> 21:04.409
The loser is within you, and the winner is
also within you.

21:04.409 --> 21:07.980
It is you [who] have to gain, not me.

21:07.980 --> 21:11.740
Sahaja Yoga is not for me at all.

21:11.740 --> 21:14.090
I don’t have to do it.

21:14.090 --> 21:21.909
It is for you to do it to gain that knowledge
which is your Self.

21:21.909 --> 21:29.809
Only thing I can do is the Shakti path but
actually I don’t do it either, I can tell

21:29.809 --> 21:30.809
you.

21:30.809 --> 21:31.809
I don’t do anything.

21:31.809 --> 21:32.809
I’m just sitting quiet.

21:32.809 --> 21:35.049
It just emits, what can I do?

21:35.049 --> 21:38.620
That’s my nature, it just flows.

21:38.620 --> 21:41.549
It works out that way.

21:41.549 --> 21:46.590
But, because of our ego, we want all challenges.

21:46.590 --> 21:55.399
Supposing I tell you tomorrow that, “You
can only get it by jumping hundred times,”

21:55.399 --> 21:56.480
you will immediately start doing that!

21:56.480 --> 22:06.649
If I tell you, say, on another sort of a efficiency
trip, that, “Supposing you do a hundred

22:06.649 --> 22:13.620
jumps in five minutes, you will get it faster,”
you will do that.

22:13.620 --> 22:21.890
Or else I give you another kind of a pralobhan
(प्रलोभन) as they call it, a

22:21.890 --> 22:22.890
temptation.

22:22.890 --> 22:29.059
Like you put five rupees today then I say,
“No, no, you better put ten rupees,” and

22:29.059 --> 22:30.059
you put that.

22:30.059 --> 22:33.700
It’s like a running a horse, race.

22:33.700 --> 22:39.750
See how superficially we look at this.

22:39.750 --> 22:43.679
In this superficiality we are going to get
lost completely.

22:43.679 --> 22:50.390
If you are really seeking then you find it
and be there and get it!

22:50.390 --> 22:55.070
This is your own!

22:55.070 --> 22:59.460
We talk big; I find very – I mean I meet
the people who are the cream of every nation,

22:59.460 --> 23:06.860
I should say, and they are creaming each other,
that’s all!

23:06.860 --> 23:10.550
Nothing more than that.

23:10.550 --> 23:15.159
They do not want to go deeper into it and
talking about, “Oh, we understand.

23:15.159 --> 23:16.780
There has to be a Messiah.

23:16.780 --> 23:19.640
There has to be [that] something must happen
to us.”

23:19.640 --> 23:21.330
“We should all become wholesome.”

23:21.330 --> 23:25.610
Now they are finding fanaticism is troubling
them so they are saying, “No, these fanatics

23:25.610 --> 23:27.149
are there.”

23:27.149 --> 23:30.210
And we are all fanatics when we are outside.

23:30.210 --> 23:38.539
I mean, if you ask me, they look like mad
people to me.

23:38.539 --> 23:40.309
Such extremists!

23:40.309 --> 23:43.850
All [their] attention outside.

23:43.850 --> 23:47.899
And an arrangement has been made within you,
as I told you, of Kundalini being placed at

23:47.899 --> 23:49.309
the triangular bone there.

23:49.309 --> 23:54.940
It’s so beautiful it is constructed, just
see the beauty of the Kundalini.

23:54.940 --> 23:59.690
Even in seeking we have gone all out to torture
our Kundalini.

23:59.690 --> 24:08.059
We are not honest to ourselves and to our
Mother, the Kundalini, the One who is sitting

24:08.059 --> 24:14.690
there for us to give us our Realisation, our
re-birth.

24:14.690 --> 24:19.600
She is there, you can see for yourself with
your naked eyes.

24:19.600 --> 24:23.350
For example, one of the Sahaja Yogis who is
a doctor went and talked to the doctors.

24:23.350 --> 24:24.669
I said, “Now, what are they doing?”

24:24.669 --> 24:29.640
They said, “Yes, we know, we got the cool
breeze in the hand, alright.”

24:29.640 --> 24:30.640
“Then?”

24:30.640 --> 24:34.990
“And yes we see, we know there is something
pulsating in the triangular bone.”

24:34.990 --> 24:35.990
“Then?

24:35.990 --> 24:39.610
Does not intrigue you?”

24:39.610 --> 24:47.000
“But still, how can that be Self Realisation?”

24:47.000 --> 25:01.970
I mean, it is beyond any one to drink water
for others and digest it and enjoy it.

25:01.970 --> 25:09.990
You can take somebody to the water, make them
drink, push them down into it, but if they

25:09.990 --> 25:14.309
just refuse then what can you do about it?

25:14.309 --> 25:19.630
And then they will come out of it and have
a big conference: “It’s a big conference.

25:19.630 --> 25:20.900
Having, a big, big conferences!”

25:20.900 --> 25:21.900
Halls they’ll fill up!

25:21.900 --> 25:23.210
And what are they discussing?

25:23.210 --> 25:30.690
How to know that you are a part of the one
living organism!

25:30.690 --> 25:37.140
Again you take out some books, read here,
have a big discussion, have a big party out

25:37.140 --> 25:39.410
of that and finished.

25:39.410 --> 25:47.799
This ‘Sunday School’ seeking, is not going
to help us.

25:47.799 --> 25:56.059
First thing we have to be genuine about it
that we want to seek it.

25:56.059 --> 26:07.399
As you know in Sahaja Yoga, those who have
advanced, those who have really worked genuinely,

26:07.399 --> 26:23.400
without paying attention outside, have been
able to know the Divine, to enjoy It and to

26:23.400 --> 26:24.919
give It to others.

26:24.919 --> 26:34.380
But anywhere in life you see, without genuineness,
what are you going to achieve?

26:34.380 --> 26:38.720
It’s like some mad man who’s a Liaison
Officer, you see.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.220
Imagine what a job and a half!

26:40.220 --> 26:44.570
He’s a Liaison Officer, so he is running
with the flowers for one person, another for

26:44.570 --> 26:46.130
another person, he doesn’t know who is coming.

26:46.130 --> 26:50.510
He may give flowers to somebody else, all
sorts of madness.

26:50.510 --> 26:55.880
In the same way, we are like Liaison Officers,
without any feelings within our heart.

26:55.880 --> 27:02.029
But with this happening you start feeling
the other within you.

27:02.029 --> 27:03.130
You start feeling.

27:03.130 --> 27:06.809
It’s an actualisation, as I told you last
time.

27:06.809 --> 27:12.909
And when that actualisation takes place the
only thing you have to do, is to allow it

27:12.909 --> 27:20.049
to grow, because it has happened spontaneously
without your effort being put into it and

27:20.049 --> 27:22.230
it is going to work out spontaneously.

27:22.230 --> 27:29.889
Only don’t stop its progress by your own
ego and your own style of looking at things.

27:29.889 --> 27:37.789
You cannot make a career out of it or a business.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.930
It is to be enjoyed!

27:39.930 --> 27:44.510
Now I am surprised how human beings are not
selling their children.

27:44.510 --> 27:47.150
I mean they are selling everything.

27:47.150 --> 27:56.320
They are selling their hair, nose, eyes, everything
that is possible under the sun, blood.

27:56.320 --> 28:09.480
But the source of all the joy that is within
you is in the heart pulsating.

28:09.480 --> 28:15.450
That is called as the pranashakti, is the
pulsating power of the Spirit within you,

28:15.450 --> 28:22.740
which is just to be enlightened so [that]
the whole attention gets enlightened.

28:22.740 --> 28:29.679
And the difference between an ordinary awareness,
where the knower and the knowledge are two

28:29.679 --> 28:36.809
different things and an enlightened awareness,
where both become one, it is tremendous!

28:36.809 --> 28:43.690
But nobody wants to practice it and see for
yourself how dynamic it is!

28:43.690 --> 28:51.280
This is what the whole world is seeking today,
this is what we are talking about and that

28:51.280 --> 28:59.350
is how the supply department from India for
all the kinds of thugs are coming here!

28:59.350 --> 29:05.840
So it’s a big circus going on everywhere!

29:05.840 --> 29:12.049
Do you want to also run in the same circus?

29:12.049 --> 29:16.420
I mean, it is not to please me, sir, but is
to please your Self.

29:16.420 --> 29:22.549
Because it is only the spiritual value of
everything whatsoever is going to give you

29:22.549 --> 29:25.429
joy, nothing else.

29:25.429 --> 29:30.250
Let the awakening take place.

29:30.250 --> 29:35.070
Give some time to it.

29:35.070 --> 29:37.600
You have problems, the Kundalini rises, alright.

29:37.600 --> 29:41.269
It touches the Sahastrara, that’s also correct.

29:41.269 --> 29:45.100
But many people they say, “Mother, when
it has touched, why should it fall?”

29:45.100 --> 29:46.919
Now, it’s not my fault.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.919
Mine does not fall.

29:48.919 --> 29:54.980
It falls because of your faults, whatever
you have done to yourself.

29:54.980 --> 29:58.029
The Kundalini has to supply, she has to look
after you.

29:58.029 --> 30:02.419
You have been so cruel to yourself or to others,
whatever you have done.

30:02.419 --> 30:06.230
You have done all wrong things so far, so
Kundalini falls.

30:06.230 --> 30:09.510
Let Her look after all these things.

30:09.510 --> 30:13.570
She knows you have a problem.

30:13.570 --> 30:18.559
But if you are not genuine, she knows also
that you are not genuine.

30:18.559 --> 30:25.350
She’ll just disappear into your Mooladhara
there in the triangular bone and will never

30:25.350 --> 30:26.350
rise.

30:26.350 --> 30:28.780
She’ll be very badly frozen.

30:28.780 --> 30:35.529
When you start thinking about the Kundalini,
you just close her completely there and she

30:35.529 --> 30:36.529
just goes down.

30:36.529 --> 30:38.510
She sees, “This man doesn’t know anything.

30:38.510 --> 30:45.260
He’ll have to take another ten births perhaps
to get his Kundalini again back in place.”

30:45.260 --> 30:51.970
But with some people it comes up and stays
there.

30:51.970 --> 30:54.800
You must respect it.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.580
You must value it.

30:56.580 --> 31:03.330
If you value that, you have valued yourself
and nobody else.

31:03.330 --> 31:11.450
By crucifying Christ, you cannot reduce his
value by any chance.

31:11.450 --> 31:17.169
You have crucified yourself by that, when
you crucified you.

31:17.169 --> 31:22.480
So the good time is coming, Christmas ahead.

31:22.480 --> 31:28.190
Let Christ be born within us on our Agya here
in the crossing point.

31:28.190 --> 31:39.769
Let us remember all these great incarnations
and prophets who came on this earth, who lived

31:39.769 --> 31:47.670
like us, like ordinary human beings, in the
most ordinary way.

31:47.670 --> 31:49.789
They led a very ordinary simple life.

31:49.789 --> 31:52.279
Some of them married also, had children.

31:52.279 --> 31:53.279
Why?

31:53.279 --> 32:05.690
They could have lived on the hills and mountains
very easily avoiding all the nonsense.

32:05.690 --> 32:18.570
No, they did come to give you a milestone
in your achievement of your evolution, and

32:18.570 --> 32:27.100
this is what is the evolution, the Maha Yoga,
where you become one with the Spirit.

32:27.100 --> 32:34.890
All the rest is useless, of no value.

32:34.890 --> 32:41.330
Spirit is your Self, is you.

32:41.330 --> 32:49.200
You are identified with your ego, so you want
to always satisfy your ego, “I like it.”

32:49.200 --> 32:57.400
“I like it,” means Mr. Ego likes it, really,
most of the time.

32:57.400 --> 33:01.440
And the Self doesn’t say , “I like it.”

33:01.440 --> 33:04.029
It feels it.

33:04.029 --> 33:08.870
It feels within Itself.

33:08.870 --> 33:11.289
It’s absolute.

33:11.289 --> 33:16.649
This is the shaktopai, which many people are
practicing.

33:16.649 --> 33:20.820
I haven’t come across even one genuine person
who does this, so far.

33:20.820 --> 33:25.870
I mean we had: Nanaka was there, Kabira was
there, we had in India – great people.

33:25.870 --> 33:33.830
And they have talked about these fake people.

33:33.830 --> 33:41.409
Even in the anuvopai, also Kundalini has to
rise in any case!

33:41.409 --> 33:43.990
It has happened in the case of Buddha and
Mahavira.

33:43.990 --> 33:50.049
But I told you that they were the children
of Rama and thousands of years later, they

33:50.049 --> 33:56.790
got their Realisation, and they are like incarnations
only, you can say, but they are different

33:56.790 --> 33:57.790
styles.

33:57.790 --> 34:01.890
We have no time to waste now.

34:01.890 --> 34:09.800
This is the Last Judgment where we have to
give up all our nonsensical ideas.

34:09.800 --> 34:18.389
You see, it’s difficult to talk to people
who have made business out of God, or some

34:18.389 --> 34:25.940
sort of a political issue out of a God.

34:25.940 --> 34:30.501
But sensible people should know that they
have to know themselves first of all, they

34:30.501 --> 34:37.810
have to become themselves and then they will
know that they are really a part and parcel

34:37.810 --> 34:45.980
of the whole, of the Viraat, the Akbar.

34:45.980 --> 34:51.580
You cannot know religion from outside like
these people are saying, “Allah ho Akbar,

34:51.580 --> 34:54.990
Allah ho Akbar,” and killing you!

34:54.990 --> 35:00.119
Or sitting in the Church and, “Let’s us
sing hymn number such and such.”

35:00.119 --> 35:07.530
Or in our temples selling all kinds of drugs.

35:07.530 --> 35:18.620
That’s why this contrast one doesn’t understand
how religious people could be like that.

35:18.620 --> 35:27.520
And then you get some nice people, ‘gentlemen’,
you know, ‘very good people’.

35:27.520 --> 35:28.600
Useless!

35:28.600 --> 35:33.352
“Oh, they are very good,” alright, what
will they do?

35:33.352 --> 35:42.380
They’ll make some bridges or may have some
tunnels or may do some creative work of writing

35:42.380 --> 35:45.490
some novels or something.

35:45.490 --> 35:50.670
But still the knower and the knowledge is
separated in them.

35:50.670 --> 35:57.589
They are useless to themselves, I am saying,
not to others.

35:57.589 --> 36:02.240
And the confusion has to go by achieving your
absolute.

36:02.240 --> 36:06.770
But all the time our attention is outside
criticising others or finding faults with

36:06.770 --> 36:11.000
others or some sort of a trivial thing.

36:11.000 --> 36:20.630
All this sounds so trivial in this world,
the way we are wasting our energy.

36:20.630 --> 36:34.109
Here is the store within us of our own earnings,
of our own punyas by which you have to get

36:34.109 --> 36:45.089
that [which] is promised to you and to enjoy
that and here is the key for you!

36:45.089 --> 36:52.770
Keep your minds open and take in, have it,
it’s a gift.

36:52.770 --> 36:57.619
As you yourself know that – you have got
so many gifts from God.

36:57.619 --> 37:01.550
How is it you have become a human being?

37:01.550 --> 37:03.320
What have you done to become a human being?

37:03.320 --> 37:12.910
This is a gift of God, this beautiful human
body, mind, everything you have got it.

37:12.910 --> 37:24.359
And now that gift itself is going to transform
you into the greatest of greatest gift – is

37:24.359 --> 37:27.290
to know your Father.

37:27.290 --> 37:35.440
The One who has created you is anxious to
bestow all His powers to you, like a father

37:35.440 --> 37:36.850
wants to bestow all his property.

37:36.850 --> 37:44.950
So take it with both the hands and have it,
and enjoy it.

37:44.950 --> 37:53.260
Before Realisation, I do not tell you that
you give up drinking, smoking or any kind

37:53.260 --> 37:54.260
of nirodh.

37:54.260 --> 37:59.329
No, I cannot ask you to do that.

37:59.329 --> 38:07.079
But after Realisation, jolly well you give
it up, you just do it, because you now taste

38:07.079 --> 38:10.390
the ambrosia, the amruta.

38:10.390 --> 38:13.829
Then you don’t want to have anything else.

38:13.829 --> 38:21.900
But, till you have tasted it, give some time,
have some patience.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.810
You need not be very well educated for this.

38:25.810 --> 38:31.210
You need not have a very good practice of
say, standing on your heads!

38:31.210 --> 38:36.170
You need not be going to churches or anything.

38:36.170 --> 38:39.250
If you are a normal human being, it is going
to work out.

38:39.250 --> 38:44.370
But mostly, when we do all these things, we
are abnormal.

38:44.370 --> 38:49.910
Even in saying that we are seeking God, we
are doing lots of abnormal things.

38:49.910 --> 38:52.160
We have to be absolutely normal.

38:52.160 --> 38:56.569
It is like this room being dark, you are sitting
down here, now sit down!

38:56.569 --> 38:57.950
It’s going to work out.

38:57.950 --> 39:00.990
But we start jumping here and there and we
get hurt.

39:00.990 --> 39:10.670
It’s like going in a boat: just keep quiet,
just be in the centre, with the centre of

39:10.670 --> 39:12.000
gravity of the boat.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.420
Just be there!

39:13.420 --> 39:16.070
That is dharma.

39:16.070 --> 39:22.720
In your sustenance, stay there.

39:22.720 --> 39:26.700
I mean to remain good, you don’t have to
do anything.

39:26.700 --> 39:34.670
I mean to become bad, you have to do something,
isn’t it?

39:34.670 --> 39:44.329
All these things will come to you automatically
when there is light.

39:44.329 --> 39:45.359
Just be quiet.

39:45.359 --> 39:51.530
All of you are going to get it.

39:51.530 --> 39:58.060
That is being ordained, that’s being arranged,
organised, very well within you, beautifully.

39:58.060 --> 40:07.070
As in a seed everything is arranged, to create
a tree, it’s arranged within you.

40:07.070 --> 40:21.670
But you have to be together, work it out,
understand each other and this group grows

40:21.670 --> 40:38.119
in that understanding, in collectivity, and
creates a nucleus for others to follow it.

40:38.119 --> 40:52.220
So, there should be no problem for you to
understand that it is a special grace.

40:52.220 --> 41:01.830
Because you are special, maybe I am also special,
and special people needed somebody special,

41:01.830 --> 41:03.849
so I had to come down here!

41:03.849 --> 41:11.250
Let’s have it in a mutual admiration way,
will be a good idea.

41:11.250 --> 41:17.160
There is no need to feel obliged because I
have to do it.

41:17.160 --> 41:27.240
I feel loaded with it and I feel lighter when
you get it.

41:27.240 --> 41:33.780
Like a mother I tell you.

41:33.780 --> 41:36.809
Sometimes I have to be stern.

41:36.809 --> 41:41.770
I know the job of a mother.

41:41.770 --> 41:46.750
You need not be afraid of me at all.

41:46.750 --> 41:51.900
I know everything about you, somehow.

41:51.900 --> 41:57.040
Like we had one Douglas (Fry) with us and
I suddenly asked him, “What about your birthday?”

41:57.040 --> 41:58.079
He was taken aback!

41:58.079 --> 42:02.559
He didn’t know – he’s sitting here – how
I knew that his birthday was there.

42:02.559 --> 42:05.910
And he really had a rebirth from the life
he had.

42:05.910 --> 42:08.890
And when I said, he said , “How do You know,
Mother?”

42:08.890 --> 42:10.540
I said , “I know what about your birthday.”

42:10.540 --> 42:13.600
And I went to his house and saw him.

42:13.600 --> 42:20.200
[I was] so overjoyed to see him settled down.

42:20.200 --> 42:29.400
It is amazing how your seed grows and how
fragrant you become.

42:29.400 --> 42:33.630
May God bless you all.

42:33.630 --> 42:43.130
If you have any questions, please ask me.

42:43.130 --> 42:57.829
We have little time.

42:57.829 --> 43:12.780
There are eighty-four tapes already with these
people and, if you want to have tapes for

43:12.780 --> 43:32.089
yourself, you can give them the tapes and
they can tape for you or perhaps…

43:32.089 --> 44:01.710
Those who do not feel vibration should not
get upset.

44:01.710 --> 44:03.069
There’s something wrong somewhere.

44:03.069 --> 44:07.420
I may not tell you on your face, because I
don’t want to hurt you in any way.

44:07.420 --> 44:11.580
But doesn’t matter, I am going to work it
out, you see, doctor doesn’t come and tell

44:11.580 --> 44:17.970
you that, “You have got all these diseases
and you may die next moment.”

44:17.970 --> 44:20.840
If doctor can do that, I am after all your
Mother, so I am not going to tell you.

44:20.840 --> 44:28.910
You yourself will know, later on, what was
wrong with you.

44:28.910 --> 44:32.390
Because by knowing that, you are not going
to help yourself.

44:32.390 --> 44:39.420
On the contrary, you are going to feel dejected.

44:39.420 --> 44:49.390
Now please put your hands just like this,
just like this.

44:49.390 --> 44:51.750
And both the feet on the ground, straight.

44:51.750 --> 44:56.390
On the ground.

44:56.390 --> 45:02.480
I think perhaps next Monday is the last meeting,
is it?

45:02.480 --> 45:03.869
Two more?

45:03.869 --> 45:09.880
You are going to have me till the the end
is it?

45:09.880 --> 45:10.880
Alright!

45:10.880 --> 45:14.740
So I was thinking of, next Monday, I’ll
be telling about elements and all those things

45:14.740 --> 45:15.740
how we are made.

45:15.740 --> 45:16.740
That would be better.

45:16.740 --> 45:17.740
Now close your eyes please.

45:17.740 --> 45:58.510
If you watch your thoughts you’ll find there
are no thoughts.

45:58.510 --> 46:16.460
Keep your eyes shut.

46:16.460 --> 46:25.430
Just see.

46:25.430 --> 46:56.849
There are no thoughts in your mind.

46:56.849 --> 47:50.700
Now, in your finger tips you’ll feel a cool
breeze coming in.

47:50.700 --> 48:14.451
That means the Realisation has taken place
because the cool breeze is the sign of the

48:14.451 --> 48:22.490
Holy Ghost, in Sanskrit it is, “salilam,
salilam,” described that the Spirit emits

48:22.490 --> 48:40.369
or radiates, you can say, Itself as cool breeze.

48:40.369 --> 48:45.010
The light of the Spirit is the cool breeze.

48:45.010 --> 48:47.510
Power of God.

48:47.510 --> 49:04.590
It’s a breeze like thing which starts floating
or going inside your…If any one of you are

49:04.590 --> 49:09.930
feeling sleepy, keep your eyes open please.

49:09.930 --> 49:12.260
Be alert.

49:12.260 --> 49:21.970
You have to be alert because this is the happening
for which you have been desiring.

49:21.970 --> 49:26.530
See for yourself.

49:26.530 --> 49:31.680
The more desirous you are the better it is.

49:31.680 --> 49:44.150
Are you getting cool breeze in the hand?

49:44.150 --> 49:45.150
Good.

49:45.150 --> 49:46.150
Close your eyes and enjoy yourself.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.150
All those who are getting cool breeze, please
raise your hands, all of you.

49:47.150 --> 49:48.150
All those who are getting cool breeze in the
hand, please raise your hands.

49:48.150 --> 49:49.150
All those who are feeling cool breeze in the
hand, please raise your hands.

49:49.150 --> 49:50.150
Now those who have come today and not yet
Realised and are not getting cool breeze,

49:50.150 --> 49:51.150
please raise your hands.

49:51.150 --> 49:52.150
Can you come forward?

49:52.150 --> 49:53.150
Keep your eyes shut, please.

49:53.150 --> 49:54.150
That lady?

49:54.150 --> 49:55.150
You’re getting the cool breeze in the hands?

49:55.150 --> 49:56.150
Are you feeling any cool breeze?

49:56.150 --> 49:57.150
Lady: Not so much.

49:57.150 --> 49:58.150
Shri Mataji: Not so much?

49:58.150 --> 49:59.150
So you started thinking about it, that’s
all.

49:59.150 --> 50:00.150
Alright.

50:00.150 --> 50:01.150
So for that you ask for forgiveness, that,
“I should not think about it,” and it

50:01.150 --> 50:02.150
will start flowing.

50:02.150 --> 50:03.150
Alright?

50:03.150 --> 50:04.150
By thinking you did not get it.

50:04.150 --> 50:05.150
So, it’s alright now.

50:05.150 --> 50:06.150
Good!

50:06.150 --> 50:07.150
See how clever it is!

50:07.150 --> 50:08.150
Still wearing that?

50:08.150 --> 50:09.150
What is that?

50:09.150 --> 50:10.150
Now see him what’s the matter.

50:10.150 --> 50:11.150
On the heart he is catching.

50:11.150 --> 50:12.150
Now, better now ? It plays tricks.

50:12.150 --> 50:13.150
John, see here, this side.

50:13.150 --> 50:14.150
Don’t watch others at this time.

50:14.150 --> 50:15.150
You watch yourself, alright?

50:15.150 --> 50:16.150
Very important.

50:16.150 --> 50:17.150
You catch people.

50:17.150 --> 50:18.150
Just don’t watch.

50:18.150 --> 50:19.150
Watch yourself.

50:19.150 --> 50:20.150
This is the time to watch yourself, alright?

50:20.150 --> 50:21.150
David, come forward, here.

50:21.150 --> 50:22.150
John, you also come here, I would like to
see you.

50:22.150 --> 50:23.150
John, you come here.

50:23.150 --> 50:24.150
David, you come here.

50:24.150 --> 50:25.150
Lindsey, you also come here.

50:25.150 --> 50:26.150
Let’s see.

50:26.150 --> 50:27.150
You sit down here first.

50:27.150 --> 50:28.150
Lindsey just come here I would like to see
you also.

50:28.150 --> 50:29.150
Just there.

50:29.150 --> 50:30.150
Just somewhere here.

50:30.150 --> 50:31.150
Just sit.

50:31.150 --> 50:32.150
Is that Alan?

50:32.150 --> 50:33.150
How are you?

50:33.150 --> 50:34.150
Better now?

50:34.150 --> 50:35.150
Better?

50:35.150 --> 50:36.150
Can you come forward.

50:36.150 --> 50:37.150
You also.

50:37.150 --> 50:38.150
Just let me see.

50:38.150 --> 50:39.150
I wanted to see your vibrations also.

50:39.150 --> 50:40.150
Yes, please.

50:40.150 --> 50:41.150
Come forward.

50:41.150 --> 50:42.150
Can you take two chairs?

50:42.150 --> 50:43.150
You must see your vibrations.

50:43.150 --> 50:44.150
We must get ourselves corrected.

50:44.150 --> 50:45.150
There may be some sort of a thing because
the vibrations if they are not sucking in

50:45.150 --> 50:46.150
alright, then there is some problem.

50:46.150 --> 50:47.150
Let’s get it alright.

50:47.150 --> 50:48.150
What is there to feel bad about anything whatsoever?

50:48.150 --> 50:49.150
Well, Alan, just come here, if possible.

50:49.150 --> 50:50.150
Alright.

50:50.150 --> 50:51.150
You can take a chair here next to John.

50:51.150 --> 50:51.156
Alan, please open your eyes, please.
