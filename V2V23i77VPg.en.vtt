00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.800
To all the seekers of truth I bow.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.240
Dr. Reeves has spoken rather strongly today.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.120
I think he is a very great Australian

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.160
to have that kind of a wisdom

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.360
to see through the nonsense and the mockery

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.000
that people were inflicting

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.000
on simple naive seekers from abroad.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.040
It requires a great intelligence

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.360
and common sense to see through that.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.160
But the greatest of all is the desire

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.840
to do good to others,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.640
to be touched by the agonies of others,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.680
to be upset what others are suffering.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.720
This is the biggest thing,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.960
that really brings you to the right point of understanding.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.680
What he said is absolute truth.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.600
I’ve been to all these gurus to find out what they have been up to.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.320
And they have been telling everyone that “She was my disciple.”

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.840
Another said, “She was my disciple.”

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.960
I just wanted to find out

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.040
what are they doing to these people,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.400
how are they grabbing them,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.680
and what are they managing.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.160
I knew the divine path, I knew the holy path, the pure path,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.840
but I didn’t know the path of the crooks,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.240
of the antichrist,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.080
and actually I had to find it out Myself.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.600
And that’s how I went to all these people

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.560
in a garb that “I have come to learn” — they never recognized Me.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.200
What you do and all those things.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.160
And that’s how I have been able to find out methods,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.880
in the permutation, combinations of your barriers,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.720
how to achieve en masse realization.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.840
In the beginning of My life, I started with normal, common people,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.520
intelligent people, educated people in all walks of life.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.360
I had to go through various types of phases,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.480
in which I met all types of people,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.080
and I could, through My subtle methods,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.640
find out what are the barriers.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.360
But the worst of all,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.040
which concerned Me the most of all,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.320
was that the great seekers of the ancient times

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.200
have gone into such mesmerism,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.480
into such ego-pampering processes

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.320
that how will they retreat back?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.040
It was a big concern to Me.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.720
I have tried —

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.280
after getting so many normal people first to Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.960
then to these combinations —

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.600
I must confess

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.960
that it is not easy to give realization to people

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.560
who have been to those gurus.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.680
Day in and day out

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.720
I have to work out the permutations and combinations of barriers,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.560
of terrible barriers within them.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.800
It’s not an easy thing,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.360
but, thank God, I have achieved it

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.240
by My own love and concern.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.080
Still I must tell you: those who belong to some guru

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.720
are very difficult people for realization.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.600
Last year in Melbourne

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.320
we had about, I think, fifty people like that,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.760
and it was impossible to give them realization;

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.520
and they even tried their level best —

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.360
they found it difficult to get it,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.400
while a drunkard could get it in no time,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.880
an alcoholic could get it in no time,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.200
a prostitute could get it in no time.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.960
Can you imagine?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.040
What harm is done within yourself

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.040
that it is not easy to give them realization!

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.080
And even if they get realization —

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.880
because they are so ego-oriented — they fall back.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.480
They mock, that’s the only thing they can do.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.720
They are least bothered about their own realization.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.480
They are not bothered. They are identified with that idea

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.000
that they belong to some sort of a cult,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.760
and they always try to be with them.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.640
Even in Perth we went, then in Adelaide,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.560
I found these, some of them, are paid by gurus

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.560
to come and disturb us.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.520
To that extent these people, who are seekers of God, are going down.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.800
They have no eyes, no sensitivity to feel what is the truth.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.600
And they are not bothered about their own well-being.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.720
This is the worst thing that is happening to them.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.600
It’s a thing of concern. Every time I have an interview anywhere —

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.240
in Australia, America, anywhere — they ask Me such questions

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.640
that “Why not your government stops these things?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.480
Why not your government do something about these people?

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.280
They have amassed so much of money.”

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.000
This Muktananda now, we have learnt, officially, he has got

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.040
sixty thousand rupees worth of diamonds,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.880
and both the disciples are fighting for it.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.600
Still, you see, it is impossible for people to accept

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.240
that “Whatever has happened has happened,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.720
it’s a naiveness we went into. Let us get to the real thing.”

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.560
They just can’t think of it.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.960
And anything that guru says, they listen to it,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.080
not even logically think about it.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.880
Moreover, if you talk to them, they don’t know anything about reality.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.120
Now, as you have seen Warren,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.400
then you have seen William,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.680
there are all these Sahaja Yogis who are equipped

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.040
with complete knowledge about Kundalini,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.200
how to give realization and how to cure people, what are the problems.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.600
I mean, William, I had never told him anything about it as such.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.840
But he has given realization to so many people in your Melbourne.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.640
So you start manifesting your own powers,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.000
and you don’t live on some sort of an ego

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.800
that you belong to some cult or anything,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.600
but you belong to yourself.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.040
Every individual becomes a beautiful flower.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.800
That’s what we have to expect within ourselves.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.880
That’s what really you are seeking.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.680
Not to be called into this guru or that guru

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.240
but your own guru within yourself — is your Spirit,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.600
is the Shiva’s Spirit within you.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.880
Today, of course, he has already told you

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.200
about these three centers which I would like to deal with you.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.800
The first center that I dealt

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.760
and the second and third are very important,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.640
but these higher centers

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:47.480
are playing a very vital role in our being.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.480
The one which is the Heart center

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.600
is looking after

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:03.800
the security of God’s children.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.840
When a person sees something horrible,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.240
this center starts pulsating fast.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.760
Till the age of twelve years,

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.240
the sternum bone, which is placed in the ribs here, as you know,

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.600
creates antibodies to fight any invasion within,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.880
whether mental, emotional, or physical.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.640
These antibodies get distributed, till the age of twelve years,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.600
throughout your body.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:50.600
And when this sternum gets the message,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.440
it starts shaking,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.840
and it conveys, communicates, through no …

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.040
nerves or arteries or veins — any connection known so far —

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.160
to these antibodies that they should all fight.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.720
They fight the disease,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.960
they fight also the things what you call possessions.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.640
They also fight your own mistakes.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.720
That’s why this is a very important center within us.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.200
If a lady is an insecure woman,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.440
if she feels insecure,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.960
then this center is always in a pulsating mood.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.160
And that’s how it makes all the antibodies very tired,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.560
because they are all the time in a state of emergency.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.320
Also these cults have used

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.880
this method of putting people onto emergency:

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.120
give them exercises where they jump, jump, jump, or something like that.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.680
Now, you can ask any doctor,

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.360
this kind of jumping without any support

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.960
can create impotency in a personality.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.360
Now, this is very physically used method by these people,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.560
to make them nervous

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:27.560
by making this center go very fast.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.800
Now, when these antibodies are tired,

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.560
they become absolutely numbed down,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:39.720
and they cannot find any strength to fight any aggression.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.480
Now, in everyday life also,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.240
if some lady, as I told you, is nervous,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.320
and she has problem, and she’s always afraid,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.440
then what happens — that this system

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.120
starts exerting itself too much;

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.720
ultimately it gets sick,

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.960
and then she can develop a disease called the breast cancer.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.560
This breast cancer is very common nowadays

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.720
among women in the West.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:23.120
Because the motherhood of the lady is challenged.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.320
This center is bestowed upon

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.640
by the deity of Mother of the Universe.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.840
And when the lady finds that her motherhood is challenged,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.400
then she starts feeling very nervous,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.600
this center goes into over-activity,

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.600
and then she developed this cancer of the breast,

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.800
troubles of the breast, all kinds of such troubles.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.640
Because the antibodies have become now very weak.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.040
On the left-hand side of this center

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.120
is the center what we call as the left Heart center.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.360
But beyond that is residing the Spirit,

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.840
in your heart, in the organ, separated from everyone.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:32.400
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty within yourself.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.080
And the Kundalini is the Holy Ghost,

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.960
which is the Power of God,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.600
which is the Primordial Mother,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.160
expressed within you as the Kundalini.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.120
So we have got within us that power, shakti,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.440
and the Shiva, sitting in your heart.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.040
So this Kundalini has to rise to give you realization.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.840
The baptism, the real baptism. Not an artificial one.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:18.040
Now, how it can happen in a person is a problem.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.720
It used to happen. What knowledge I am telling you

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.520
is not the knowledge of today.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.080
Is the knowledge of very very ancient times.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.840
Fourteen thousand years back,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:34.040
Markandeya, a great poet in India, has written about it.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.680
After that

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.960
there were many other poets who wrote about it,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.840
till, in the sixth century, Adi Shankaracharya

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.880
very clearly wrote about the Kundalini and its awakening.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.160
Nobody has said so far,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.560
from those ancient writers, that Kundalini gives you any problems,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:01.360
or she makes you dance, jump and all that — is all modern nonsense.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.480
Traditionally, nobody has said so.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.080
Sixth century is the time

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.640
when Adi Shankaracharya incarnated on this earth.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.880
Buddha got His realization without doing any dancing or anything.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.600
You know for definite.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.320
So this new idea of all these happenings

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.320
come by a generation of these horrible people

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.600
in the last fifty years.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.160
I would say there has been a Holy Trinity

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.000
as well as a Unholy Trinity.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.080
These people preceded the others who were to come,

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.040
to execute what they wanted to do.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.880
These antichrists had two type of things,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.800
because … how to neutralize also the writings of the ancient times.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.680
Like Freud — was one of them.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.240
There are some more. They came down like this

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.400
and wrote some things to uproot human beings completely,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.640
first of all, from reality.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.480
And then another lot came in

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.520
for using that as a written thing for them —

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.040
because writing is something great —

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.240
and then preaching what these people have preached,

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.640
using that as a base to express themselves.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.560
You see, all hand-in-gloves knowledge.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.880
But if you read any ancient book —

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.680
which many are not translated…

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.640
Because nobody’s interested in that!

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.080
They diverted all our attention from the sublime

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.600
to absolutely wretched life.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.320
And this uprooting has taken place

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.680
because these are antichrist activities;

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.840
they are all joined together, they never talk against each other,

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.000
that’s one thing great about them.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.440
And Christ has said

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.160
that Satan is not going to talk against his own house.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.520
They praise each other, meet each other,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.480
I’ve seen them behaving like that.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.800
Give them presents, this one gives presents to another —

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.200
big fraternity exists between them.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.760
Great fraternity, no problem between them.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.160
But the real saints in India,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.640
who are living in the forest and Himalayas,

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.520
into the hills and dales, I should say,

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.680
hidden away from … you people,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:52.400
are just quite aware that these are antichrist.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.160
The first thing that happened when these people

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.800
started manifesting themselves — India is very good at astrology,

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.720
so, as soon as their birth date came in, they just cast their… horoscope

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.800
and said, “Now let’s see what’s in their horoscope.”

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.680
So, most of them changed their birth dates also.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.600
Nothing consistent!

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.200
And when you ask them, “Why are you not consistent?”

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.320
they said change is the way the life is.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.280
But that is life. You are talking of something eternal.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.640
How can eternal change?

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.600
It’s very difficult

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.480
to make people take to eternal life

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.800
than to make them take to just mundane life. You know that.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.760
Now, see, there’s a show on today. How many cars there are!

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.360
And how many people there are to see that!

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.000
But to take to real life, it takes time,

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.680
otherwise why is it all the great saints

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:01.080
and all the great prophets and incarnations

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.520
were tortured by human beings?

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.680
Why did they torture them?

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.800
So this is one of the things one has to realize —

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.600
that the Spirit resides in your heart.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.000
Which is the Sat-chit-ananda, as they say —

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.440
is the one which is the truth,

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.840
which is the attention,

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.400
and which is the joy.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.040
Now, first of all, we must understand what is attention.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.680
What is “God who is an attention”, what does that mean.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.800
“God who is the attention” means

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:47.160
God knows about everything that’s happening.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:53.520
He is aware of what is happening in this world.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:59.560
He's the only spectator of the drama of life,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:05.400
which is created by His Power, the Primordial Mother.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.800
He knows each and everything about us;

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.160
whatever He wants to know, He can find out,

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.840
there is no problem about it.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.600
So He is the knower,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.160
and He is the knowledge too.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.080
So, when we become realized,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.560
we have to know through our awareness:

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.760
we have to become collectively conscious.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.400
And this is a very important point which we must remember.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.560
It’s not very difficult to understand

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.640
that you have to become something more.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.760
Only by wearing some dress

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.200
or putting something in your neck what do you become?

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.360
Some people tell Me, “We lead a very good life, Mother,

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.520
so it should be all right.”

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.600
But “good life” is according to your concept.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.440
Even according to the divine concept,

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.440
if it is a good life — for what?

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.360
Everybody will ask, “For what?

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.440
Why do you want to lead such a religious life, for what?

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.600
What is the need to have such a life?”

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.960
One should ask oneself, “Why to lead such a life

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.160
which is so conditioned?”

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.200
The answer is, you have to have balance to ascend.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.960
If you do not ascend, what’s the use

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.360
of building up this balance within you?

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.960
The purpose is to ascend.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.360
If you cannot transcend,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.600
then this is just a binding, your mental projection

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.360
that you should lead this kind of life and that kind of life.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.000
It’s just your mental process.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.440
But when the Spirit ascends,

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.800
then all the religions are born within you.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.600
They get enlightenment. You just don’t do things which are wrong.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.880
Just don’t do it, you just don’t like it.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.240
As we have told you that there are people who gave up

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.960
their drugs and things overnight. Is a fact!

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.040
Because, as soon as this happens,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.000
the enlightenment brings forth

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.800
complete new awareness

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.640
which refuses to have anything that is not good for this body.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.840
You just have the things that are good for your body, for your life.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.880
You don’t have to fight with yourself

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.600
that “Oh God, how will I give up?” In the morning you say,

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.440
“I will not drink in the night,” but in the night you drink.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.960
So, in the beginning there is no need in Sahaja Yoga today

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.200
to say that “Don’t do this and don’t do that.”

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.000
There’s no need at all.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.560
Once it is enlightened within you, you just look after yourself.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.200
But when the Spirit starts coming in your attention,

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.160
you become collectively conscious, and you know.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.240
You know, again. It’s not mental projection.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.720
You know about yourself.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.760
You know what centers are catching, on your fingers you can tell.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.720
Fingertips, you can say. You know on your fingertips.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.040
And you know about others also.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.880
And also, if you really learn the complete technique —

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.280
which is very easy to learn, within a week you can learn it —

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.360
you can help another and yourself very well

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.400
to rise above this level to a higher level.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.480
People have all kinds of fears these days.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.680
It’s a very abnormal situation.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.360
They don’t have any joy. Only fear. They live with fear.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.840
They were telling Me there’s a person who cannot live out

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.600
in the space, then there’s fear of even building bad oxygen,

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.960
then they have fear of germ touching them,

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.960
and all those things are there. They have lost confidence in life.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.160
By awakening of this center within you,

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.160
you become absolutely a normal person.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.160
You have no fears.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.800
Because nothing that is wrong can attack you.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.440
You are well prepared for it.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.280
There’s a strength within you which really

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.440
makes you very confident.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.040
That’s why this center is very important

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.040
for us to know that this center

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.880
gives us that strength, that confidence.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.600
The other day — every program —

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.840
they asked Me another question:

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.640
“What do You think about Australians?”

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.600
Which is a very very common question, I’ve found.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.720
I said that they are great people, very nice people.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:57.000
But they lack only one thing — is complete confidence in themselves.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.280
They haven’t got that confidence that they should have.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.240
They are not aggressive people, they are not worried

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.960
about aggressing other territories or anything.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.960
But a kind of a diffidence is still in them

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.640
which they should get rid of it. Completely.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.480
You are the people who belong to God.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.560
And why should you have any diffidence about it?

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.240
But this diffidence

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.120
is completely finished

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.640
when you get this center awakened within you.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.480
To get this center awakened, you have to do nothing.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.000
The Kundalini herself rises,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.040
and if you have any problem in that center, she comes back;

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.720
again she rises with a greater force and hits there,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:54.960
opens it out and awakens the deity of that center,

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.240
so that you feel very confident.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.000
Today, if you see, Dr. Warren so confident.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.200
I must tell you, he was not,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.480
he was quite diffident.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.200
He thought you all are going to beat him

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.840
when he tells you all these things.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.520
But today he’s a changed man.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.760
Now, we have on the right-hand side of this,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.440
is another part of the center, which we call as right Heart.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.960
This center is the father’s center,

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.720
and the left Heart is the mother’s center.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:37.040
So, if your fatherhood is challenged in any way —

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.280
or, also, husband-wise, we can say it like that —

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.720
if a husband is not loyal to his wife

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.680
and is playing tricks with her,

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.240
he gets this into trouble.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:57.040
But physically, he feels it very much

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.600
because he gets asthma.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.080
Asthma one develops,

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.680
but this is more a center of the father.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.280
If the fatherhood of a person is not all right,

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.880
for example, if a girl has lost her father

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:19.560
and she has never seen him, she might develop asthma.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.880
If the grandfather had the asthma,

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.000
the grandchild might develop the asthma.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.640
It comes from the father’s side.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.200
Anybody who has asthma problem should know

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.400
that there's something wrong in the fatherhood side.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.400
Maybe the father is sick and you are worried,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.800
maybe you are a good father, but the son is not all right,

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.520
so you are suffering — anything like that, you see,

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.640
could be responsible for this asthma.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.600
But if the deity here is awakened, you can be all right,

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.680
and you can get rid of your asthma, quite all right.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:02.400
On the left-hand side is the center of your mother.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.440
If the mother has died very early,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.480
such a person is a nervous person,

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.640
and such a person also doesn’t trust anyone.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.120
He can become secretive by nature, sulking type.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.440
He may not open his heart to anyone, because he doesn’t trust anyone.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.080
Some people who have no mother,

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.960
whom they have not known,

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.320
can become extremely cautious by nature

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.600
because they think they have to look after themselves.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.360
Extremely cautious.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.200
But with Sahaja Yoga, you can awaken this center,

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.640
and you become a complete personality,

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.800
without any fear, without any nervousness,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.960
and without any malice to your parents.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.240
Actually, after Sahaja Yoga, I’ve found,

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.440
many people who have just forgotten their parents,

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.080
had been very angry with their parents,

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.040
given them up, could not forgive them —

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.160
went back to their parents.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.600
We had a French girl in England

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.120
who had not seen her mother for eighteen years,

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.360
and the mother was alone, a widow lady.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.800
But after the realization, she has a tremendous feeling;

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.000
she went back and looked after her mother,

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.200
and also started doing Sahaja Yoga there.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.560
It’s not … it’s a very very common thing

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.400
that you start expanding your heart to others.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.560
You start loving other people,

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.160
you start understanding them.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.120
I know of a man in America — I gave him realization —

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.600
and he said, “Most surprising, I went to the race this time.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.360
I said this would be the last I go to the race.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.720
And there I find my uncle, and I wished him;

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.080
and he was amazed, he started looking at me,

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.800
because I had not wished him all these years at all.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.680
He just started, he was quite amazed at my attitude.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.960
And now he has become a great friend of mine.”

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.840
So the friendship —

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.600
which is a pure friendship, this homosexual and all nonsense —

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:12.840
but a pure friendship based on pure relationship develops.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.200
And then you don’t feel insecure.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.640
In a society where even a mother’s love is challenged,

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:25.000
one would feel extremely insecure in a thing like that.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.480
If a mother has to love the child, she has to think,

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.800
“I hope there is no bad feeling in my mind.”

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.360
In America it happened: there was a little boy of eight years,

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.560
just a little boy of eight years.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.680
And her mother said that she has started taking

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.760
lot of drugs and things,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.320
and these drugs have created a problem

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.360
for this little boy of eight years, can you imagine?

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.640
So I couldn’t bear it, I just took the boy to My heart,

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.560
and I kissed him.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:02.560
He said, “Mother, this is never done to me by my mother.”

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:06.440
So I asked the lady, “Why didn’t you do this to your child?

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.000
He’s only eight years of age, doesn’t he love your care,

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.320
and your expression of your love?”

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.560
So she said, “Mother, I feel guilty.” I said, “How?” —

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.320
“Freud has said…” Freud was a perverted useless fellow!

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.400
He died of cancer, look at his life!

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.720
These psychologists, when they come in contact with others,

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.360
people who are suffering from pathological troubles —

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.280
they are pathological cases —

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.480
and when they deal with pathological cases,

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.680
they don’t know how to protect them. Jung has said about it.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.600
Then they catch those diseases among themselves,

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.120
and they start generalizing this for everyone.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.200
They have generalized, it’s an absurd thing!

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.800
In Rome, there was a girl who came to Me, she said,

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.360
“Ah, psychologists, horrid, horrid, horrid!”

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.680
I said, “What happened?” — “They are telling me I have bad eyes

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.280
towards my father. I felt like beating them!”

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.080
It's all absurd things, you see, to create — this is anti-Christ —

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.520
to create a feeling of enmity,

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.480
that everything is perverted, polluted.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.560
It’s so pure!

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.120
In India nobody can understand this.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.040
Thank God this Freud and all these people just touched

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.520
the periphery of India, and it’s like an elephant:

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:30.680
so nobody is there, and it’s just gone … nobody believes in it.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.240
So, I have to tell you this, that there is no such thing

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.240
as polluted relationship or bad relationship.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.720
It’s all pure relationships.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.200
We must understand we are not animals.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.880
Even animals have got sense, so do you think we won’t have

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.880
the sense of purity within us and holiness within us?

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.520
So all these ideas also drop out completely,

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.080
and you develop a personality.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.120
You live with others: in the ashram now we have

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.600
many girls, boys, this — they’re all are like brothers and sisters.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.640
There is no problem on that.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.280
Now, we have the other centre,

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.360
which we call as the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.440
This is a very very important center

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.880
which is bestowed upon by Shri Krishna Himself.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.320
The right Heart by Shri Rama, and left Heart by Uma,

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.720
or we can call Her the wife of Shiva;

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.840
while the centre Heart is bestowed upon by the Mother,

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.800
called Jagadamba, who is the one

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.480
who helps people to cross this ocean of illusion,

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.520
and to protect them. This is the Divine Mother.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.240
The other day you were asking Me about Divine Mother —

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.240
this is one of the glimpse of Her.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.640
So now the other center which we have here

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.120
is very important center, called as the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.280
This is the center Vi-shuddha. One is “shuddha”, means “pure”,

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.200
but “vishuddha” means “absolutely pure”.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.640
This has got sixteen petals,

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:11.280
as we have got the cervical plexus expressed in the gross,

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.240
which has also got sixteen sub-plexuses.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.640
It tallies with medical science completely.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:22.360
Now, this Vishuddhi Chakra is bestowed upon

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.480
by the deity of Shri Krishna.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.960
Shri Krishna is the one which is the evolution

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.800
of the Vishnu Tattwa [Vishnu Principle] from there

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.040
upward to the state of Primordial Being.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.640
He is the one who resides

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.720
as the Primordial Being, as the Whole, as the Akbar.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:52.520
When Mohammed Sahib talked of Akbar, he talked of Shri Krishna.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:57.160
This is the finger which represents this center,

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.640
and He said: “Put these into your ears

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.200
and say ‘Allah hu Akbar’ —

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.760
you get in connection with the Virat.”

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.600
Now, what Sahaja Yoga does is to make you

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.680
in contact with the whole.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.320
It makes you in contact with the whole.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.520
It’s not that it limits you,

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.600
but it makes you one with the whole.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.680
So one must understand

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.000
that what you have to achieve in your realization

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.800
is just not talk of Shri Krishna, just thinking, singing about —

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.440
which is absurd! People don’t understand!

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.880
That in Oxford Street we find people

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.240
with all these nonsensical things going on;

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.760
begging, asking for alms…

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.400
I feel it’s such an insult to Shri Krishna

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.040
that people in His name are begging.

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.200
But it’s done in all religious movements

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.960
that people beg in the name of God.

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.640
There is no need to beg.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.680
First you equip yourself with the blessings of God

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.280
that there is no need for you to beg at all.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:07.600
And begging is against God’s realization,

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.560
against Self-realization.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.560
You must have self-esteem. That’s one thing very important.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.680
If you do not have self-esteem, you cannot get realization.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.120
Why should you go on the streets and beg?

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.520
It's absolutely absurd, it's a showing-off thing,

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.600
which is of no use to yourself.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:32.120
By doing this, you are really corrupting the name of Shri Krishna.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.960
But if you take to the right path,

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.080
if this center is awakened,

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.320
your hands become connected with the Primordial Being,

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.040
and you become, your hands become collectively conscious.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.800
Medically, they accept that the extremities

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.120
have got something to do with the sympathetic nervous system.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.600
That far, no more than that.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.160
But in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be amazed

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.960
that the vibration starts flowing through your hand

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.200
when you take the name of Shri Krishna.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.120
And these vibrations, when you want to find out what are these,

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.280
then you’ll be amazed they relate to your centers within yourself.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.320
Even if you get ten children who are realized souls,

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.600
and tie their eyes, and ask them about a person

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.000
who is sitting before them what’s wrong with him,

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.160
they will say one finger, or this finger,

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.120
or this finger, or two fingers.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.480
Because you can feel the charring,

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.400
you can feel sometimes a kind of a heat.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.120
Sometimes you may feel the numbness.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.560
If you feel the numbness on your fingers,

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.480
then you must know that the person has to die.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.840
So many things you can know, all the permutations

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.240
of these seven centers and this one:

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.600
one, five, and … six and seven.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.800
So we have seven centers.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.880
To understand about the centers,

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.120
first you must get your realization, that is important.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.240
In the beginning you’ll find the vibrations are coming, going,

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.960
coming, going. It is not steady.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.680
First you must steady yourself.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.520
Then you can find out, from your hands,

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.560
what are the centers catching.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.360
Because these vibrations are nothing

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.640
but the Power of God is flowing through you.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:23.440
They understand, these vibrations, they co-ordinate.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.960
They are life’s force.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.760
They are the one who create all these living things

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.360
like … they are the one who sprout a seed,

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:39.480
they are the one who transform the flower into a fruit.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.800
All living work is done by these vibrations,

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.640
which is called as Chaitanya, Aum, Ruh,

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:52.120
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, and all-pervading Power of God.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.480
That starts flowing through you, first time you feel them.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.520
Yesterday many people felt it, and people were very happy

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.440
that so many felt it, because that’s a sign

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:06.600
that here many people are going to get realization.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.680
You don’t have to go to anybody,

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.120
you have to just practice a little bit and find out.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.800
You’ll become such an expert!

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.560
One person in India who got realization

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.440
has so far given realization to at least ten thousand people.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.640
In a village. Many villages.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.320
He’s a very ordinary man. We wanted him to come,

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:34.800
but there was a kind of a visa problem, so he could not come.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.880
He’s a very simple farmer, and he got his realization,

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.360
and he knows so much about Sahaja Yoga that you’ll be amazed;

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.880
he has not been to any university, to any college or anything,

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.560
but he’s so knowledgeable.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.320
Because once you have these vibrations they guide you.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.800
So the Spirit sitting in your heart

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.760
guides you and tells you what is right and what is wrong.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.480
If you have to ask a question: “Mother, is there God?” —

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.320
if you ask this question, immediately there will be

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.080
a tremendous flow saying that it is there.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.560
Now, how to understand that these are the vibrations of God,

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.600
also this question can come.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.720
We can judge them relatively.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:23.200
For example, in one of the programs in Pune,

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.600
people invited Me to speak

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.000
in a place which was owned by brahmins, and they opposed it.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.400
They said, “She’s not a brahmin, so we will not have her here.”

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.440
So they said, “All right, we’ll publish in the newspaper —

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.000
because Her name has gone in the newspaper — we’ll tell them

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.280
that these people are so ‘brahminic’ that they don’t want to have Her.”

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.440
Of course, they didn’t want to have that bad name,

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.480
so they said, “All right, let’s have her.”

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.120
These people never told Me what had happened.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:51.600
Suddenly I said, “Those who think who are brahmins, come down.”

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.560
So four-five of them came and sat before Me.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.160
These are brahmins without knowing the Brahma!

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.360
So I said, “All right, put your hands before Me.”

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.080
And they just started shaking like this, going back.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.040
I said, “What’s happening to you?”

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.560
So they said, “Mother, you are Shakti,

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.400
that’s why it is happening to me, to us,”

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.080
but I said, “What about others? It’s not happening to others.”

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.640
So they turned round and said, “Look at these,

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.960
they are also doing like this.”

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.960
I said, “Ask them from where do they come.”

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.680
They went and asked them; they said, “We are coming

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.560
from the lunatic asylum of Thane.”

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.520
So these fanatics, who believed that they were brahmins,

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:29.360
were reacting the same way as these lunatics.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.440
And they believed that they were brahmins,

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.360
they were not supposed to touch anybody,

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.040
they were “untouchables” people, and they were …

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.600
the one who gave them realization was from so-called untouchable,

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.480
a shoemaker.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.800
Now he’s become their guru, of all these brahmins,

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.080
and he’s teaching them about God.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:52.520
So this center gives you the power

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.080
to be one with the whole.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.120
It has many powers, but the main power it gives you

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.200
is the power to be one with the whole

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.400
and to have all the powers of that deity within you awakened,

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:12.400
so that you can become aware

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.960
and make others also aware of it.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.440
Those people who talk too much catch on the right Vishuddhi,

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.680
those who do not talk at all catch on the left.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.400
Those who feel guilty catch on the left,

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.640
those who think they are all right and aggressive,

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.960
they catch on the right. It’s like that.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.000
So this has to be understood in right perspective:

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.280
that if you misuse this center, what happens to you,

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.440
so how you should give yourself a balance to improve that.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.200
But the best part of Sahaja Yoga is this:

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.720
that when you get them realization,

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.640
they are separated from themselves.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.800
They’ll come and tell Me, “Mother, my Agnya Chakra is catching.”

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.520
So, if you ask them, “Really?” — “Yes, Mother, very much.”

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.640
That means they are suffering from too much ego.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.480
But can you imagine anybody saying,

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.560
“Mother, I’m suffering from too much ego”?

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.880
Because you are separated from yourself, you see your ego,

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.600
the big balloonic-like thing,

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.360
and you say, “Mother, please remove my ego.”

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.360
That is how people talk to Me.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.240
They will tell Me: “Mother, I talk too much,

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.280
that’s why my right Vishuddhi is catching.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.160
You better cure it, I must stop my talking too much.”

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.960
So you start correcting yourself

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.560
because you get separated from yourself,

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.760
you become the Spirit; and the rest you see.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.480
Like I see My sari: if there’s a spot,

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.600
I would like to clean it, I’m not identified with the spot.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.600
So, that’s how it happens; you are no more identified with yourself,

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.280
and you start seeing the faults in you, and you try to correct it.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.840
That’s how you become a beautiful person — by your own attention,

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.240
not by anybody else, it is you who has to do it.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.600
Now, we have a very important center here

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.440
called as Agnya Chakra.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.600
This is bestowed upon

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:06.080
by the great incarnation of Lord Jesus Christ.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:10.120
We have no idea as to how this incarnation

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.240
has come on this earth.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:17.120
Because if you just read Bible, it is a little bit of Christ we see.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.200
They allowed Him to live only for about four years

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:25.040
to talk to people; within four years He was killed.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.000
So He had no time to tell you all about it.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.160
But He did the job what He was supposed to do

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.600
and which He achieved in His lifetime.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.160
But if you read some books,

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.960
in other scriptures like Devi Mahatmyam,

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:46.160
where the Goddess was the one who created Him —

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.600
and how She created, and what She did to Him,

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.840
and everything is given in detail —

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.120
and in every detail, you’ll be surprised, is the life of Christ.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:01.240
Only thing, there He is called as Mahavishnu and not as Christ.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.440
But even the name of Christ comes to Him

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.120
from the same heritage which I was telling you:

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.880
that His name was Yeshu, not Jesus,

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.840
because, in the Bible, I get Myself confused when I read

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:18.760
that Anna was not Anna, it was Hannah, John was Johann —

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.280
every name has been corrupted in the English Bible.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.960
In the same way they have corrupted Christ’s name, Yeshu, into Jesus.

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:30.240
Actually, they call Him — some people, of course — call Him Jesu.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.120
This is the name given to Him by Shri Radhaji,

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.400
the one who was the power of Shri Krishna.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.880
She's the one who gave Him this name

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.240
because She was very much indebted

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.760
to the foster mother of Shri Krishna, who was Yeshoda,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.880
and that’s why She called Him Yeshu.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.840
“Yeshu” is the word in Hebrew language,

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.080
and we call Yeshoda as Yeshu;

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.120
also some people, in a … what you call … in a country language,

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.240
also call the same thing as Jesu.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.600
You know that Y and J is always sort of

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.840
brought together in that way: like Yugoslavia, we call it —

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.680
they call it Jugoslavia.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.720
So His name Yeshu came from that,

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.960
and that’s how He was created a special one.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.960
In the Devi Mahatmyam it is said that Krishna has said

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:24.440
that “You will become the support of the universe.”

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.320
Now, in India, people and seers were waiting for Mahavishnu

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.560
to come and tell them that, Mahavishnu has been born.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.000
But the people who went to India,

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.040
they had Bible in one hand and the pistol in another hand,

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.200
or a big gun, or maybe a huge big cannon.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.160
And that’s how they entered India,

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.080
and they said that “You must get converted.”

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:51.000
Now, what is a “conversion” God only knows. You can take a donkey

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.040
and put a thing on that “You are a Christian” —

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.880
you don’t become a Christian.

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.360
That’s how they spread Christianity throughout India,

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.840
which was all absurd type of Christianity.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.440
I was also born in one of the Protestant Christian families.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.440
My father was a realized soul, My mother was another,

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.360
they were very learned people.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.360
And My father told Me, “God, look at this now,

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.000
what are these Christians doing to Christ!”

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.880
And he was the one who fought for Independence,

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.960
he went to jail, My mother went to jail, and he was member

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.880
of our constituent assembly, parliament and all that,

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.520
but Christians only started recognizing him

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.160
when he became a member of something or a mayor of a place.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.240
They had no other idea of a person,

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.160
that somebody has Spiritual endowment

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.320
or any sort of a Spiritual powers.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.120
Now, in our family,

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.440
we were very much with Gandhiji, all of us;

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.880
we had sacrificed a lot for the country,

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.400
and My father decided to marry us all out of community,

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.640
not among Christians, because he thought these Christians

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:59.240
are so much worshipping these missionaries:

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.720
they would even pray for their health,

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:07.280
the health of their dog, and health of their umbrellas.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.320
It was such a wretched condition of these Christians in those days;

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.400
I mean, they were so dedicated to these missionaries.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.840
The missionaries were only busy converting people.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:22.280
Now, this Mahavishnu Tattwa — the one who was born as Christ —

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.120
was never understood, never told,

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.360
they never read anything about it they never found out.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.560
So, Indians believed that so far Mahavishnu is not born,

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.800
and so it continued with the idea

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.080
that we have to still go on.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.280
Because in the principle Mahavishnu it was written

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.480
that “Not only You will be the support of the universe,

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.120
but You will have such purity within You,” —

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.400
because He is the Omkara, He’s the Chaitanya,

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.080
He’s the vibrations, that’s why He could walk,

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.200
that’s why He was resurrected —

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:59.560
that it was said that when His Advent will come,

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.720
He will cross this path —

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.440
this is the cross, the resurrection part —

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.000
and, by His advancement,

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.560
He will be able to suck in

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.440
the ego and superego within you, the karmas,

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.240
the conditionings, the ego in you,

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.000
by which people will get their realization.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.680
So Indians continued with the idea

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.560
that “We have to still pay for our karmas, Mahavishnu has not come.”

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.880
Because of misrepresentation.

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.840
Once I told them that Christ was Mahavishnu, you see,

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.880
thousands are getting realization because they believe in Mahavishnu,

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.200
they of course respect Christ very much, but they did not know

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.720
that He was Mahavishnu; if He’s Mahavishnu, it’s perfect!

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.000
And that’s how He was enlightened, and He got -

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.960
the people got their realization in no time.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.600
Because they are educated in it, they know what it is.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.280
You see, these missionaries just read some Bible

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.000
in some schools and all that and came down.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.880
But they did not know how to correlate the whole thing.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.400
You see, it cannot be truth just in Bible,

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.960
it has to be everywhere.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.680
And that is what happened when they came down

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:13.880
and they told us something which was not Christ.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.760
Now, this thing happens to us also:

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.200
that when Kundalini rises,

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.600
Christ is born within you here, He’s awakened within you.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:27.600
And when He is awakened, the ego and superego both are sucked in,

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.800
and you get a space here;

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.200
and when you get that space here, the Kundalini shoots off,

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:38.240
and that’s how you feel the cool breeze on your head.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:43.080
I have given at least seven lectures continuously on Christ

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.840
in a church called as Unity Church.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.400
It was, again, the unity and fraternity

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.000
of all the horrible people.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.520
They were preaching about Rajneesh, preaching about …

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.600
at least Rajneesh is antichrist, anybody can see.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.960
When Christ has said: “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes” —

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.960
to that extent His purity has gone —

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:09.000
how can you accept Rajneesh as a guru for any Spirituality?

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.120
But they had books from all kinds of horrible people.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.680
They had no books which were ancient books with them,

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.360
nothing, no knowledge of any kind!

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.760
Indians don’t depend — the real Indians, I mean,

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.640
not the westernized pseudo-Indians

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.480
who have been to Cambridge and Oxford —

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.960
but those who are real Indians don’t depend on these books:

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.800
they think it’s all trash that has come and will go away,

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.160
it has no meaning.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:36.520
And they had all these books put there to destroy.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.960
Really the unity within us lies —

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.880
when you become collectively conscious.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.560
All this work has been done in the ancient times.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.680
As Mohammed was one of the Prophets who came,

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:53.320
out of the ten Prophets: Moses, Abraham,

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.600
Lao Tse …

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.520
then we had also people like other Prophets …

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.120
Socrates…

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.320
Recently, we had in India the last one,

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.480
is the Sai Nath — not the “Satya” one, but the Sai Nath —

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.240
who lived … who was representing

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:20.160
this great principle of Primordial Master.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.880
So this is the story of your evolution.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.720
The last is the most important center, is the Sahasrara,

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:34.320
which is open today, open from 1970, 5 May,

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:40.600
that we can feel the Sahasrara opening out.

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.160
About this center also, if you go to My center,

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.240
you’ll find many, many tapes

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:49.360
which will explain to you this center.

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.560
The only thing is that all the seats

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:57.320
of all the subtle centers within us

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.400
lie along the line like this.

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:04.080
And all the centers are within us. This is the Agnya Chakra.

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.120
And that’s how it moves: this is the Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.600
this is the Heart, this is the Nabhi,

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.320
what you call the solar plexus;

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.760
then we have got, in the center here, is the Mooladhara,

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.760
and around it is what you call the Swadhishthana.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
That’s why when Swadhishthana goes out

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.600
or you get diabetes, you get blindness.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.760
Blindness is due to the fact that your Swadhisthana is not all right.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.400
Many people get blind when their eyes open —

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.480
can be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.600
In Geneva I cured a lady in ten minutes time.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.120
It’s all due to possessions that you get here.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:47.000
Coming to the Agnya Chakra, one has to say that all these chakras

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.360
have movement on both the sides:

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:51.400
one moves to the collective subconscious,

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.840
another moves to the collective supraconscious.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.240
Now, if at the Agnya Chakra you start moving like that,

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.880
in the collective subconscious you start seeing

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.320
all the dead things:

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.560
like great deities,

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:10.320
or you can also start think … past, we can say.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.600
If you move to the right, then you start seeing colors,

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.360
and also you start seeing lights and all those things.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:19.960
With LSD also you can do it.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.240
If you take LSD … many people who used to take LSD

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.200
and were suffering from coma just came to Me,

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:29.240
and they just never saw Me, they just saw the lights.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:33.400
So, that is not the right thing to see Me as light

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.160
or as some previous deity —

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.720
is to see Me as I am, is the present.

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.280
So we have to be in the present.

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.520
Sahaja Yoga brings you to the present moment,

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.440
by which you enjoy every moment of life in its all dynamics,

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.120
and that’s how you become a dynamic,

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.680
loving, affectionate, relaxed personality.

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.600
May God bless you all!
