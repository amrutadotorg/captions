00:02.880 --> 00:07.800
To all the seekers of truth I bow.

00:12.160 --> 00:17.240
Dr. Reeves has spoken rather strongly today.

00:17.440 --> 00:21.120
I think he is a very great Australian

00:21.320 --> 00:24.160
to have that kind of a wisdom

00:24.360 --> 00:29.360
to see through the nonsense and the mockery

00:29.560 --> 00:32.000
that people were inflicting

00:32.200 --> 00:37.000
on simple naive seekers from abroad.

00:37.200 --> 00:44.040
It requires a great intelligence

00:45.360 --> 00:49.360
and common sense to see through that.

00:49.560 --> 00:53.160
But the greatest of all is the desire

00:53.360 --> 00:55.840
to do good to others,

00:56.080 --> 00:59.640
to be touched by the agonies of others,

00:59.960 --> 01:03.680
to be upset what others are suffering.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.720
This is the biggest thing,

01:05.960 --> 01:11.960
that really brings you to the right point of understanding.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.680
What he said is absolute truth.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.600
I’ve been to all these gurus to find out what they have been up to.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.320
And they have been telling everyone that “She was my disciple.”

01:23.520 --> 01:25.840
Another said, “She was my disciple.”

01:26.080 --> 01:27.960
I just wanted to find out

01:28.160 --> 01:34.040
what are they doing to these people,

01:34.240 --> 01:37.400
how are they grabbing them,

01:37.600 --> 01:40.680
and what are they managing.

01:41.520 --> 01:46.160
I knew the divine path, I knew the holy path, the pure path,

01:46.360 --> 01:49.840
but I didn’t know the path of the crooks,

01:50.080 --> 01:52.240
of the antichrist,

01:52.440 --> 01:56.080
and actually I had to find it out Myself.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.600
And that’s how I went to all these people

01:58.800 --> 02:03.560
in a garb that “I have come to learn” — they never recognized Me.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.200
What you do and all those things.

02:06.400 --> 02:11.160
And that’s how I have been able to find out methods,

02:11.360 --> 02:14.880
in the permutation, combinations of your barriers,

02:15.120 --> 02:19.720
how to achieve en masse realization.

02:19.960 --> 02:24.840
In the beginning of My life, I started with normal, common people,

02:25.080 --> 02:29.520
intelligent people, educated people in all walks of life.

02:29.680 --> 02:33.360
I had to go through various types of phases,

02:33.560 --> 02:36.480
in which I met all types of people,

02:36.640 --> 02:39.080
and I could, through My subtle methods,

02:39.280 --> 02:41.640
find out what are the barriers.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.360
But the worst of all,

02:44.560 --> 02:47.040
which concerned Me the most of all,

02:47.240 --> 02:51.320
was that the great seekers of the ancient times

02:51.520 --> 02:56.200
have gone into such mesmerism,

02:56.400 --> 03:02.480
into such ego-pampering processes

03:02.800 --> 03:06.320
that how will they retreat back?

03:06.520 --> 03:10.040
It was a big concern to Me.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.720
I have tried —

03:12.960 --> 03:18.280
after getting so many normal people first to Sahaja Yoga,

03:18.480 --> 03:20.960
then to these combinations —

03:21.160 --> 03:23.600
I must confess

03:23.760 --> 03:26.960
that it is not easy to give realization to people

03:27.160 --> 03:29.560
who have been to those gurus.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.680
Day in and day out

03:31.880 --> 03:35.720
I have to work out the permutations and combinations of barriers,

03:35.960 --> 03:39.560
of terrible barriers within them.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.800
It’s not an easy thing,

03:42.040 --> 03:46.360
but, thank God, I have achieved it

03:46.560 --> 03:52.240
by My own love and concern.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.080
Still I must tell you: those who belong to some guru

03:56.280 --> 03:59.720
are very difficult people for realization.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.600
Last year in Melbourne

04:01.760 --> 04:06.320
we had about, I think, fifty people like that,

04:06.520 --> 04:10.760
and it was impossible to give them realization;

04:11.120 --> 04:13.520
and they even tried their level best —

04:13.680 --> 04:15.360
they found it difficult to get it,

04:15.560 --> 04:20.400
while a drunkard could get it in no time,

04:20.600 --> 04:22.880
an alcoholic could get it in no time,

04:23.120 --> 04:26.200
a prostitute could get it in no time.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.960
Can you imagine?

04:28.160 --> 04:32.040
What harm is done within yourself

04:32.240 --> 04:36.040
that it is not easy to give them realization!

04:36.240 --> 04:38.080
And even if they get realization —

04:38.280 --> 04:41.880
because they are so ego-oriented — they fall back.

04:42.120 --> 04:45.480
They mock, that’s the only thing they can do.

04:45.640 --> 04:48.720
They are least bothered about their own realization.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.480
They are not bothered. They are identified with that idea

04:52.640 --> 04:56.000
that they belong to some sort of a cult,

04:56.200 --> 04:58.760
and they always try to be with them.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.640
Even in Perth we went, then in Adelaide,

05:02.840 --> 05:05.560
I found these, some of them, are paid by gurus

05:05.720 --> 05:08.560
to come and disturb us.

05:08.760 --> 05:14.520
To that extent these people, who are seekers of God, are going down.

05:14.680 --> 05:19.800
They have no eyes, no sensitivity to feel what is the truth.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.600
And they are not bothered about their own well-being.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.720
This is the worst thing that is happening to them.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.600
It’s a thing of concern. Every time I have an interview anywhere —

05:30.800 --> 05:35.240
in Australia, America, anywhere — they ask Me such questions

05:35.440 --> 05:39.640
that “Why not your government stops these things?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.480
Why not your government do something about these people?

05:42.640 --> 05:44.280
They have amassed so much of money.”

05:44.480 --> 05:49.000
This Muktananda now, we have learnt, officially, he has got

05:49.200 --> 05:55.040
sixty thousand rupees worth of diamonds,

05:55.240 --> 05:58.880
and both the disciples are fighting for it.

06:01.600 --> 06:05.600
Still, you see, it is impossible for people to accept

06:05.800 --> 06:08.240
that “Whatever has happened has happened,

06:08.440 --> 06:13.720
it’s a naiveness we went into. Let us get to the real thing.”

06:14.080 --> 06:16.560
They just can’t think of it.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.960
And anything that guru says, they listen to it,

06:20.160 --> 06:23.080
not even logically think about it.

06:23.280 --> 06:26.880
Moreover, if you talk to them, they don’t know anything about reality.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.120
Now, as you have seen Warren,

06:29.320 --> 06:31.400
then you have seen William,

06:31.600 --> 06:33.680
there are all these Sahaja Yogis who are equipped

06:33.880 --> 06:36.040
with complete knowledge about Kundalini,

06:36.240 --> 06:40.200
how to give realization and how to cure people, what are the problems.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.600
I mean, William, I had never told him anything about it as such.

06:44.840 --> 06:49.840
But he has given realization to so many people in your Melbourne.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.640
So you start manifesting your own powers,

06:52.840 --> 06:55.000
and you don’t live on some sort of an ego

06:55.200 --> 06:56.800
that you belong to some cult or anything,

06:57.040 --> 06:59.600
but you belong to yourself.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.040
Every individual becomes a beautiful flower.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.800
That’s what we have to expect within ourselves.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.880
That’s what really you are seeking.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.680
Not to be called into this guru or that guru

07:10.880 --> 07:14.240
but your own guru within yourself — is your Spirit,

07:14.440 --> 07:19.600
is the Shiva’s Spirit within you.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.880
Today, of course, he has already told you

07:22.120 --> 07:27.200
about these three centers which I would like to deal with you.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.800
The first center that I dealt

07:33.040 --> 07:35.760
and the second and third are very important,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.640
but these higher centers

07:41.440 --> 07:47.480
are playing a very vital role in our being.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.480
The one which is the Heart center

07:52.720 --> 07:57.600
is looking after

07:57.800 --> 08:03.800
the security of God’s children.

08:05.680 --> 08:10.840
When a person sees something horrible,

08:11.080 --> 08:14.240
this center starts pulsating fast.

08:14.440 --> 08:17.760
Till the age of twelve years,

08:18.560 --> 08:24.240
the sternum bone, which is placed in the ribs here, as you know,

08:24.440 --> 08:29.600
creates antibodies to fight any invasion within,

08:29.800 --> 08:33.880
whether mental, emotional, or physical.

08:34.200 --> 08:38.640
These antibodies get distributed, till the age of twelve years,

08:38.840 --> 08:44.600
throughout your body.

08:44.760 --> 08:50.600
And when this sternum gets the message,

08:50.760 --> 08:53.440
it starts shaking,

08:53.600 --> 08:58.840
and it conveys, communicates, through no …

09:00.600 --> 09:05.040
nerves or arteries or veins — any connection known so far —

09:05.240 --> 09:09.160
to these antibodies that they should all fight.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.720
They fight the disease,

09:10.960 --> 09:16.960
they fight also the things what you call possessions.

09:17.160 --> 09:22.640
They also fight your own mistakes.

09:23.800 --> 09:29.720
That’s why this is a very important center within us.

09:30.120 --> 09:35.200
If a lady is an insecure woman,

09:35.400 --> 09:37.440
if she feels insecure,

09:37.600 --> 09:41.960
then this center is always in a pulsating mood.

09:42.160 --> 09:47.160
And that’s how it makes all the antibodies very tired,

09:47.360 --> 09:52.560
because they are all the time in a state of emergency.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.320
Also these cults have used

09:56.520 --> 09:59.880
this method of putting people onto emergency:

10:00.120 --> 10:04.120
give them exercises where they jump, jump, jump, or something like that.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.680
Now, you can ask any doctor,

10:05.880 --> 10:08.360
this kind of jumping without any support

10:08.560 --> 10:11.960
can create impotency in a personality.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.360
Now, this is very physically used method by these people,

10:18.560 --> 10:21.560
to make them nervous

10:21.720 --> 10:27.560
by making this center go very fast.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.800
Now, when these antibodies are tired,

10:31.040 --> 10:33.560
they become absolutely numbed down,

10:33.720 --> 10:39.720
and they cannot find any strength to fight any aggression.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.480
Now, in everyday life also,

10:42.640 --> 10:46.240
if some lady, as I told you, is nervous,

10:46.440 --> 10:51.320
and she has problem, and she’s always afraid,

10:51.520 --> 10:56.440
then what happens — that this system

10:56.600 --> 11:00.120
starts exerting itself too much;

11:00.320 --> 11:02.720
ultimately it gets sick,

11:02.960 --> 11:08.960
and then she can develop a disease called the breast cancer.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.560
This breast cancer is very common nowadays

11:13.720 --> 11:16.720
among women in the West.

11:17.360 --> 11:23.120
Because the motherhood of the lady is challenged.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.320
This center is bestowed upon

11:26.520 --> 11:31.640
by the deity of Mother of the Universe.

11:31.840 --> 11:37.840
And when the lady finds that her motherhood is challenged,

11:38.680 --> 11:43.400
then she starts feeling very nervous,

11:43.600 --> 11:47.600
this center goes into over-activity,

11:47.800 --> 11:52.600
and then she developed this cancer of the breast,

11:52.800 --> 11:55.800
troubles of the breast, all kinds of such troubles.

11:56.040 --> 12:00.640
Because the antibodies have become now very weak.

12:04.560 --> 12:09.040
On the left-hand side of this center

12:09.600 --> 12:15.120
is the center what we call as the left Heart center.

12:15.320 --> 12:20.360
But beyond that is residing the Spirit,

12:20.560 --> 12:25.840
in your heart, in the organ, separated from everyone.

12:26.400 --> 12:32.400
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty within yourself.

12:34.200 --> 12:39.080
And the Kundalini is the Holy Ghost,

12:39.280 --> 12:41.960
which is the Power of God,

12:42.160 --> 12:44.600
which is the Primordial Mother,

12:44.760 --> 12:50.160
expressed within you as the Kundalini.

12:51.200 --> 12:56.120
So we have got within us that power, shakti,

12:56.320 --> 13:00.440
and the Shiva, sitting in your heart.

13:00.640 --> 13:06.040
So this Kundalini has to rise to give you realization.

13:06.240 --> 13:10.840
The baptism, the real baptism. Not an artificial one.

13:12.080 --> 13:18.040
Now, how it can happen in a person is a problem.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.720
It used to happen. What knowledge I am telling you

13:20.960 --> 13:23.520
is not the knowledge of today.

13:23.680 --> 13:27.080
Is the knowledge of very very ancient times.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.840
Fourteen thousand years back,

13:29.080 --> 13:34.040
Markandeya, a great poet in India, has written about it.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.680
After that

13:36.880 --> 13:39.960
there were many other poets who wrote about it,

13:40.160 --> 13:42.840
till, in the sixth century, Adi Shankaracharya

13:43.080 --> 13:46.880
very clearly wrote about the Kundalini and its awakening.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.160
Nobody has said so far,

13:50.360 --> 13:55.560
from those ancient writers, that Kundalini gives you any problems,

13:55.720 --> 14:01.360
or she makes you dance, jump and all that — is all modern nonsense.

14:02.680 --> 14:06.480
Traditionally, nobody has said so.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.080
Sixth century is the time

14:09.280 --> 14:12.640
when Adi Shankaracharya incarnated on this earth.

14:12.880 --> 14:17.880
Buddha got His realization without doing any dancing or anything.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.600
You know for definite.

14:21.760 --> 14:26.320
So this new idea of all these happenings

14:26.520 --> 14:30.320
come by a generation of these horrible people

14:30.520 --> 14:32.600
in the last fifty years.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.160
I would say there has been a Holy Trinity

14:35.360 --> 14:38.000
as well as a Unholy Trinity.

14:38.200 --> 14:42.080
These people preceded the others who were to come,

14:42.280 --> 14:45.040
to execute what they wanted to do.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.880
These antichrists had two type of things,

14:48.120 --> 14:53.800
because … how to neutralize also the writings of the ancient times.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.680
Like Freud — was one of them.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.240
There are some more. They came down like this

15:02.440 --> 15:06.400
and wrote some things to uproot human beings completely,

15:06.600 --> 15:09.640
first of all, from reality.

15:09.840 --> 15:13.480
And then another lot came in

15:14.480 --> 15:18.520
for using that as a written thing for them —

15:18.680 --> 15:22.040
because writing is something great —

15:22.400 --> 15:26.240
and then preaching what these people have preached,

15:26.440 --> 15:30.640
using that as a base to express themselves.

15:31.240 --> 15:35.560
You see, all hand-in-gloves knowledge.

15:35.720 --> 15:38.880
But if you read any ancient book —

15:39.160 --> 15:42.680
which many are not translated…

15:43.320 --> 15:46.640
Because nobody’s interested in that!

15:47.960 --> 15:51.080
They diverted all our attention from the sublime

15:51.280 --> 15:54.600
to absolutely wretched life.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.320
And this uprooting has taken place

15:57.520 --> 16:00.680
because these are antichrist activities;

16:00.880 --> 16:03.840
they are all joined together, they never talk against each other,

16:04.080 --> 16:06.000
that’s one thing great about them.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.440
And Christ has said

16:07.600 --> 16:12.160
that Satan is not going to talk against his own house.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.520
They praise each other, meet each other,

16:15.680 --> 16:17.480
I’ve seen them behaving like that.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.800
Give them presents, this one gives presents to another —

16:21.040 --> 16:23.200
big fraternity exists between them.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.760
Great fraternity, no problem between them.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.160
But the real saints in India,

16:29.360 --> 16:34.640
who are living in the forest and Himalayas,

16:35.240 --> 16:37.520
into the hills and dales, I should say,

16:37.680 --> 16:43.680
hidden away from … you people,

16:46.400 --> 16:52.400
are just quite aware that these are antichrist.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.160
The first thing that happened when these people

16:56.360 --> 17:00.800
started manifesting themselves — India is very good at astrology,

17:01.040 --> 17:04.720
so, as soon as their birth date came in, they just cast their… horoscope

17:04.960 --> 17:08.800
and said, “Now let’s see what’s in their horoscope.”

17:09.040 --> 17:13.680
So, most of them changed their birth dates also.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.600
Nothing consistent!

17:16.760 --> 17:19.200
And when you ask them, “Why are you not consistent?”

17:19.400 --> 17:23.320
they said change is the way the life is.

17:23.680 --> 17:28.280
But that is life. You are talking of something eternal.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.640
How can eternal change?

17:32.680 --> 17:34.600
It’s very difficult

17:34.760 --> 17:39.480
to make people take to eternal life

17:39.640 --> 17:42.800
than to make them take to just mundane life. You know that.

17:43.040 --> 17:47.760
Now, see, there’s a show on today. How many cars there are!

17:48.000 --> 17:50.360
And how many people there are to see that!

17:50.560 --> 17:53.000
But to take to real life, it takes time,

17:53.200 --> 17:55.680
otherwise why is it all the great saints

17:55.880 --> 18:01.080
and all the great prophets and incarnations

18:01.320 --> 18:03.520
were tortured by human beings?

18:03.680 --> 18:06.680
Why did they torture them?

18:07.160 --> 18:09.800
So this is one of the things one has to realize —

18:10.040 --> 18:13.600
that the Spirit resides in your heart.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.000
Which is the Sat-chit-ananda, as they say —

18:17.200 --> 18:19.440
is the one which is the truth,

18:19.600 --> 18:21.840
which is the attention,

18:22.080 --> 18:27.400
and which is the joy.

18:28.400 --> 18:33.040
Now, first of all, we must understand what is attention.

18:33.360 --> 18:37.680
What is “God who is an attention”, what does that mean.

18:37.960 --> 18:41.800
“God who is the attention” means

18:42.080 --> 18:47.160
God knows about everything that’s happening.

18:47.720 --> 18:53.520
He is aware of what is happening in this world.

18:53.680 --> 18:59.560
He's the only spectator of the drama of life,

18:59.720 --> 19:05.400
which is created by His Power, the Primordial Mother.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.800
He knows each and everything about us;

19:08.040 --> 19:10.160
whatever He wants to know, He can find out,

19:10.360 --> 19:12.840
there is no problem about it.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.600
So He is the knower,

19:15.760 --> 19:19.160
and He is the knowledge too.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.080
So, when we become realized,

19:23.280 --> 19:28.560
we have to know through our awareness:

19:28.720 --> 19:31.760
we have to become collectively conscious.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.400
And this is a very important point which we must remember.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.560
It’s not very difficult to understand

19:39.720 --> 19:42.640
that you have to become something more.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.760
Only by wearing some dress

19:45.000 --> 19:47.200
or putting something in your neck what do you become?

19:47.400 --> 19:50.360
Some people tell Me, “We lead a very good life, Mother,

19:50.560 --> 19:54.520
so it should be all right.”

19:54.680 --> 19:58.600
But “good life” is according to your concept.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.440
Even according to the divine concept,

20:01.600 --> 20:04.440
if it is a good life — for what?

20:04.600 --> 20:06.360
Everybody will ask, “For what?

20:06.560 --> 20:09.440
Why do you want to lead such a religious life, for what?

20:09.600 --> 20:12.600
What is the need to have such a life?”

20:12.800 --> 20:14.960
One should ask oneself, “Why to lead such a life

20:15.160 --> 20:18.160
which is so conditioned?”

20:18.960 --> 20:23.200
The answer is, you have to have balance to ascend.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.960
If you do not ascend, what’s the use

20:25.160 --> 20:28.360
of building up this balance within you?

20:28.760 --> 20:31.960
The purpose is to ascend.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.360
If you cannot transcend,

20:35.880 --> 20:39.600
then this is just a binding, your mental projection

20:39.760 --> 20:42.360
that you should lead this kind of life and that kind of life.

20:42.560 --> 20:45.000
It’s just your mental process.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.440
But when the Spirit ascends,

20:48.600 --> 20:52.800
then all the religions are born within you.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.600
They get enlightenment. You just don’t do things which are wrong.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.880
Just don’t do it, you just don’t like it.

21:00.120 --> 21:03.240
As we have told you that there are people who gave up

21:03.440 --> 21:06.960
their drugs and things overnight. Is a fact!

21:07.160 --> 21:11.040
Because, as soon as this happens,

21:11.240 --> 21:15.000
the enlightenment brings forth

21:16.280 --> 21:19.800
complete new awareness

21:20.040 --> 21:24.640
which refuses to have anything that is not good for this body.

21:25.560 --> 21:30.840
You just have the things that are good for your body, for your life.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.880
You don’t have to fight with yourself

21:33.120 --> 21:35.600
that “Oh God, how will I give up?” In the morning you say,

21:35.760 --> 21:39.440
“I will not drink in the night,” but in the night you drink.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.960
So, in the beginning there is no need in Sahaja Yoga today

21:45.160 --> 21:48.200
to say that “Don’t do this and don’t do that.”

21:48.400 --> 21:50.000
There’s no need at all.

21:50.200 --> 21:54.560
Once it is enlightened within you, you just look after yourself.

21:54.720 --> 21:58.200
But when the Spirit starts coming in your attention,

21:58.400 --> 22:02.160
you become collectively conscious, and you know.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.240
You know, again. It’s not mental projection.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.720
You know about yourself.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.760
You know what centers are catching, on your fingers you can tell.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.720
Fingertips, you can say. You know on your fingertips.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.040
And you know about others also.

22:19.240 --> 22:23.880
And also, if you really learn the complete technique —

22:24.120 --> 22:27.280
which is very easy to learn, within a week you can learn it —

22:27.480 --> 22:31.360
you can help another and yourself very well

22:31.560 --> 22:36.400
to rise above this level to a higher level.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.480
People have all kinds of fears these days.

22:38.640 --> 22:41.680
It’s a very abnormal situation.

22:41.880 --> 22:45.360
They don’t have any joy. Only fear. They live with fear.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.840
They were telling Me there’s a person who cannot live out

22:48.080 --> 22:52.600
in the space, then there’s fear of even building bad oxygen,

22:52.760 --> 22:55.960
then they have fear of germ touching them,

22:56.160 --> 23:00.960
and all those things are there. They have lost confidence in life.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.160
By awakening of this center within you,

23:04.360 --> 23:07.160
you become absolutely a normal person.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.160
You have no fears.

23:10.360 --> 23:13.800
Because nothing that is wrong can attack you.

23:14.040 --> 23:16.440
You are well prepared for it.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.280
There’s a strength within you which really

23:20.480 --> 23:23.440
makes you very confident.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.040
That’s why this center is very important

23:27.240 --> 23:31.040
for us to know that this center

23:31.240 --> 23:35.880
gives us that strength, that confidence.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.600
The other day — every program —

23:38.800 --> 23:40.840
they asked Me another question:

23:41.080 --> 23:43.640
“What do You think about Australians?”

23:43.840 --> 23:47.600
Which is a very very common question, I’ve found.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.720
I said that they are great people, very nice people.

23:51.960 --> 23:57.000
But they lack only one thing — is complete confidence in themselves.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.280
They haven’t got that confidence that they should have.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.240
They are not aggressive people, they are not worried

24:03.440 --> 24:05.960
about aggressing other territories or anything.

24:06.160 --> 24:09.960
But a kind of a diffidence is still in them

24:10.160 --> 24:12.640
which they should get rid of it. Completely.

24:12.840 --> 24:16.480
You are the people who belong to God.

24:16.640 --> 24:20.560
And why should you have any diffidence about it?

24:22.040 --> 24:24.240
But this diffidence

24:24.440 --> 24:29.120
is completely finished

24:29.320 --> 24:33.640
when you get this center awakened within you.

24:33.880 --> 24:38.480
To get this center awakened, you have to do nothing.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.000
The Kundalini herself rises,

24:41.200 --> 24:45.040
and if you have any problem in that center, she comes back;

24:45.240 --> 24:48.720
again she rises with a greater force and hits there,

24:48.960 --> 24:54.960
opens it out and awakens the deity of that center,

24:55.160 --> 24:58.240
so that you feel very confident.

24:58.520 --> 25:02.000
Today, if you see, Dr. Warren so confident.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.200
I must tell you, he was not,

25:05.520 --> 25:07.480
he was quite diffident.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.200
He thought you all are going to beat him

25:09.400 --> 25:11.840
when he tells you all these things.

25:12.080 --> 25:15.520
But today he’s a changed man.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.760
Now, we have on the right-hand side of this,

25:20.000 --> 25:24.440
is another part of the center, which we call as right Heart.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.960
This center is the father’s center,

25:27.160 --> 25:30.720
and the left Heart is the mother’s center.

25:31.800 --> 25:37.040
So, if your fatherhood is challenged in any way —

25:37.240 --> 25:40.280
or, also, husband-wise, we can say it like that —

25:40.480 --> 25:44.720
if a husband is not loyal to his wife

25:44.960 --> 25:47.680
and is playing tricks with her,

25:47.880 --> 25:51.240
he gets this into trouble.

25:51.440 --> 25:57.040
But physically, he feels it very much

25:57.240 --> 26:00.600
because he gets asthma.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.080
Asthma one develops,

26:04.280 --> 26:07.680
but this is more a center of the father.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.280
If the fatherhood of a person is not all right,

26:10.480 --> 26:14.880
for example, if a girl has lost her father

26:15.120 --> 26:19.560
and she has never seen him, she might develop asthma.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.880
If the grandfather had the asthma,

26:22.120 --> 26:24.000
the grandchild might develop the asthma.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.640
It comes from the father’s side.

26:26.840 --> 26:31.200
Anybody who has asthma problem should know

26:31.400 --> 26:34.400
that there's something wrong in the fatherhood side.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.400
Maybe the father is sick and you are worried,

26:37.600 --> 26:40.800
maybe you are a good father, but the son is not all right,

26:41.040 --> 26:44.520
so you are suffering — anything like that, you see,

26:44.680 --> 26:47.640
could be responsible for this asthma.

26:47.840 --> 26:52.600
But if the deity here is awakened, you can be all right,

26:52.760 --> 26:56.680
and you can get rid of your asthma, quite all right.

26:56.880 --> 27:02.400
On the left-hand side is the center of your mother.

27:02.600 --> 27:06.440
If the mother has died very early,

27:06.600 --> 27:09.480
such a person is a nervous person,

27:09.640 --> 27:13.640
and such a person also doesn’t trust anyone.

27:13.840 --> 27:18.120
He can become secretive by nature, sulking type.

27:18.320 --> 27:23.440
He may not open his heart to anyone, because he doesn’t trust anyone.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.080
Some people who have no mother,

27:26.280 --> 27:27.960
whom they have not known,

27:28.160 --> 27:32.320
can become extremely cautious by nature

27:32.520 --> 27:35.600
because they think they have to look after themselves.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.360
Extremely cautious.

27:37.560 --> 27:42.200
But with Sahaja Yoga, you can awaken this center,

27:42.400 --> 27:45.640
and you become a complete personality,

27:45.840 --> 27:48.800
without any fear, without any nervousness,

27:49.040 --> 27:51.960
and without any malice to your parents.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.240
Actually, after Sahaja Yoga, I’ve found,

27:54.440 --> 27:58.440
many people who have just forgotten their parents,

27:58.600 --> 28:01.080
had been very angry with their parents,

28:01.280 --> 28:04.040
given them up, could not forgive them —

28:04.240 --> 28:06.160
went back to their parents.

28:06.360 --> 28:09.600
We had a French girl in England

28:09.760 --> 28:13.120
who had not seen her mother for eighteen years,

28:13.320 --> 28:16.360
and the mother was alone, a widow lady.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.800
But after the realization, she has a tremendous feeling;

28:20.040 --> 28:23.000
she went back and looked after her mother,

28:23.200 --> 28:26.200
and also started doing Sahaja Yoga there.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.560
It’s not … it’s a very very common thing

28:28.720 --> 28:32.400
that you start expanding your heart to others.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.560
You start loving other people,

28:34.720 --> 28:37.160
you start understanding them.

28:37.360 --> 28:41.120
I know of a man in America — I gave him realization —

28:41.320 --> 28:44.600
and he said, “Most surprising, I went to the race this time.

28:44.760 --> 28:47.360
I said this would be the last I go to the race.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.720
And there I find my uncle, and I wished him;

28:50.960 --> 28:53.080
and he was amazed, he started looking at me,

28:53.280 --> 28:55.800
because I had not wished him all these years at all.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.680
He just started, he was quite amazed at my attitude.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.960
And now he has become a great friend of mine.”

29:01.160 --> 29:02.840
So the friendship —

29:03.080 --> 29:06.600
which is a pure friendship, this homosexual and all nonsense —

29:06.800 --> 29:12.840
but a pure friendship based on pure relationship develops.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.200
And then you don’t feel insecure.

29:16.400 --> 29:20.640
In a society where even a mother’s love is challenged,

29:20.840 --> 29:25.000
one would feel extremely insecure in a thing like that.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.480
If a mother has to love the child, she has to think,

29:27.640 --> 29:30.800
“I hope there is no bad feeling in my mind.”

29:31.040 --> 29:34.360
In America it happened: there was a little boy of eight years,

29:34.560 --> 29:36.560
just a little boy of eight years.

29:36.720 --> 29:40.680
And her mother said that she has started taking

29:40.880 --> 29:43.760
lot of drugs and things,

29:44.000 --> 29:48.320
and these drugs have created a problem

29:48.520 --> 29:52.360
for this little boy of eight years, can you imagine?

29:52.560 --> 29:55.640
So I couldn’t bear it, I just took the boy to My heart,

29:55.840 --> 29:57.560
and I kissed him.

29:57.720 --> 30:02.560
He said, “Mother, this is never done to me by my mother.”

30:02.720 --> 30:06.440
So I asked the lady, “Why didn’t you do this to your child?

30:06.600 --> 30:12.000
He’s only eight years of age, doesn’t he love your care,

30:12.200 --> 30:14.320
and your expression of your love?”

30:14.520 --> 30:17.560
So she said, “Mother, I feel guilty.” I said, “How?” —

30:17.720 --> 30:21.320
“Freud has said…” Freud was a perverted useless fellow!

30:21.520 --> 30:24.400
He died of cancer, look at his life!

30:24.600 --> 30:29.720
These psychologists, when they come in contact with others,

30:29.960 --> 30:33.360
people who are suffering from pathological troubles —

30:33.560 --> 30:35.280
they are pathological cases —

30:35.480 --> 30:37.480
and when they deal with pathological cases,

30:37.640 --> 30:40.680
they don’t know how to protect them. Jung has said about it.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.600
Then they catch those diseases among themselves,

30:43.760 --> 30:46.120
and they start generalizing this for everyone.

30:46.320 --> 30:50.200
They have generalized, it’s an absurd thing!

30:50.400 --> 30:52.800
In Rome, there was a girl who came to Me, she said,

30:53.040 --> 30:55.360
“Ah, psychologists, horrid, horrid, horrid!”

30:55.560 --> 30:58.680
I said, “What happened?” — “They are telling me I have bad eyes

30:58.880 --> 31:03.280
towards my father. I felt like beating them!”

31:03.520 --> 31:07.080
It's all absurd things, you see, to create — this is anti-Christ —

31:07.280 --> 31:11.520
to create a feeling of enmity,

31:11.680 --> 31:14.480
that everything is perverted, polluted.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.560
It’s so pure!

31:16.720 --> 31:19.120
In India nobody can understand this.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.040
Thank God this Freud and all these people just touched

31:22.240 --> 31:25.520
the periphery of India, and it’s like an elephant:

31:25.680 --> 31:30.680
so nobody is there, and it’s just gone … nobody believes in it.

31:30.880 --> 31:35.240
So, I have to tell you this, that there is no such thing

31:35.440 --> 31:40.240
as polluted relationship or bad relationship.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.720
It’s all pure relationships.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.200
We must understand we are not animals.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.880
Even animals have got sense, so do you think we won’t have

31:49.120 --> 31:53.880
the sense of purity within us and holiness within us?

31:54.200 --> 31:57.520
So all these ideas also drop out completely,

31:57.680 --> 32:00.080
and you develop a personality.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.120
You live with others: in the ashram now we have

32:02.320 --> 32:06.600
many girls, boys, this — they’re all are like brothers and sisters.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.640
There is no problem on that.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.280
Now, we have the other centre,

32:11.480 --> 32:14.360
which we call as the Vishuddhi Chakra.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.440
This is a very very important center

32:17.600 --> 32:21.880
which is bestowed upon by Shri Krishna Himself.

32:22.120 --> 32:26.320
The right Heart by Shri Rama, and left Heart by Uma,

32:26.520 --> 32:29.720
or we can call Her the wife of Shiva;

32:29.960 --> 32:33.840
while the centre Heart is bestowed upon by the Mother,

32:34.080 --> 32:36.800
called Jagadamba, who is the one

32:37.040 --> 32:41.480
who helps people to cross this ocean of illusion,

32:41.640 --> 32:44.520
and to protect them. This is the Divine Mother.

32:44.680 --> 32:47.240
The other day you were asking Me about Divine Mother —

32:47.440 --> 32:49.240
this is one of the glimpse of Her.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.640
So now the other center which we have here

32:51.840 --> 32:56.120
is very important center, called as the Vishuddhi Chakra.

32:56.320 --> 33:00.280
This is the center Vi-shuddha. One is “shuddha”, means “pure”,

33:00.480 --> 33:04.200
but “vishuddha” means “absolutely pure”.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.640
This has got sixteen petals,

33:06.840 --> 33:11.280
as we have got the cervical plexus expressed in the gross,

33:11.480 --> 33:15.240
which has also got sixteen sub-plexuses.

33:15.440 --> 33:18.640
It tallies with medical science completely.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.360
Now, this Vishuddhi Chakra is bestowed upon

33:22.600 --> 33:26.480
by the deity of Shri Krishna.

33:26.640 --> 33:30.960
Shri Krishna is the one which is the evolution

33:31.160 --> 33:33.800
of the Vishnu Tattwa [Vishnu Principle] from there

33:34.040 --> 33:39.040
upward to the state of Primordial Being.

33:39.720 --> 33:43.640
He is the one who resides

33:43.840 --> 33:47.720
as the Primordial Being, as the Whole, as the Akbar.

33:47.960 --> 33:52.520
When Mohammed Sahib talked of Akbar, he talked of Shri Krishna.

33:52.680 --> 33:57.160
This is the finger which represents this center,

33:57.360 --> 34:00.640
and He said: “Put these into your ears

34:00.840 --> 34:03.200
and say ‘Allah hu Akbar’ —

34:03.400 --> 34:07.760
you get in connection with the Virat.”

34:08.000 --> 34:10.600
Now, what Sahaja Yoga does is to make you

34:10.760 --> 34:13.680
in contact with the whole.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.320
It makes you in contact with the whole.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.520
It’s not that it limits you,

34:18.680 --> 34:21.600
but it makes you one with the whole.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.680
So one must understand

34:23.880 --> 34:27.000
that what you have to achieve in your realization

34:27.200 --> 34:30.800
is just not talk of Shri Krishna, just thinking, singing about —

34:31.040 --> 34:33.440
which is absurd! People don’t understand!

34:33.600 --> 34:35.880
That in Oxford Street we find people

34:36.120 --> 34:39.240
with all these nonsensical things going on;

34:39.440 --> 34:41.760
begging, asking for alms…

34:42.000 --> 34:45.400
I feel it’s such an insult to Shri Krishna

34:45.600 --> 34:49.040
that people in His name are begging.

34:49.240 --> 34:52.200
But it’s done in all religious movements

34:52.400 --> 34:54.960
that people beg in the name of God.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.640
There is no need to beg.

34:56.840 --> 35:00.680
First you equip yourself with the blessings of God

35:00.880 --> 35:03.280
that there is no need for you to beg at all.

35:03.480 --> 35:07.600
And begging is against God’s realization,

35:07.760 --> 35:09.560
against Self-realization.

35:09.720 --> 35:13.560
You must have self-esteem. That’s one thing very important.

35:13.720 --> 35:17.680
If you do not have self-esteem, you cannot get realization.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.120
Why should you go on the streets and beg?

35:20.320 --> 35:23.520
It's absolutely absurd, it's a showing-off thing,

35:23.680 --> 35:26.600
which is of no use to yourself.

35:26.800 --> 35:32.120
By doing this, you are really corrupting the name of Shri Krishna.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.960
But if you take to the right path,

35:35.160 --> 35:37.080
if this center is awakened,

35:37.280 --> 35:41.320
your hands become connected with the Primordial Being,

35:41.520 --> 35:46.040
and you become, your hands become collectively conscious.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.800
Medically, they accept that the extremities

35:49.040 --> 35:52.120
have got something to do with the sympathetic nervous system.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.600
That far, no more than that.

35:54.760 --> 35:57.160
But in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be amazed

35:57.360 --> 35:59.960
that the vibration starts flowing through your hand

36:00.160 --> 36:03.200
when you take the name of Shri Krishna.

36:03.400 --> 36:07.120
And these vibrations, when you want to find out what are these,

36:07.320 --> 36:11.280
then you’ll be amazed they relate to your centers within yourself.

36:11.480 --> 36:14.320
Even if you get ten children who are realized souls,

36:14.520 --> 36:17.600
and tie their eyes, and ask them about a person

36:17.800 --> 36:20.000
who is sitting before them what’s wrong with him,

36:20.200 --> 36:22.160
they will say one finger, or this finger,

36:22.360 --> 36:24.120
or this finger, or two fingers.

36:24.320 --> 36:26.480
Because you can feel the charring,

36:26.640 --> 36:30.400
you can feel sometimes a kind of a heat.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.120
Sometimes you may feel the numbness.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.560
If you feel the numbness on your fingers,

36:35.720 --> 36:39.480
then you must know that the person has to die.

36:39.640 --> 36:42.840
So many things you can know, all the permutations

36:43.120 --> 36:47.240
of these seven centers and this one:

36:47.440 --> 36:51.600
one, five, and … six and seven.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.800
So we have seven centers.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.880
To understand about the centers,

36:57.120 --> 37:00.120
first you must get your realization, that is important.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.240
In the beginning you’ll find the vibrations are coming, going,

37:03.440 --> 37:05.960
coming, going. It is not steady.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.680
First you must steady yourself.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.520
Then you can find out, from your hands,

37:10.680 --> 37:12.560
what are the centers catching.

37:12.720 --> 37:15.360
Because these vibrations are nothing

37:15.560 --> 37:18.640
but the Power of God is flowing through you.

37:18.880 --> 37:23.440
They understand, these vibrations, they co-ordinate.

37:23.600 --> 37:24.960
They are life’s force.

37:25.160 --> 37:29.760
They are the one who create all these living things

37:30.000 --> 37:33.360
like … they are the one who sprout a seed,

37:33.560 --> 37:39.480
they are the one who transform the flower into a fruit.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.800
All living work is done by these vibrations,

37:43.040 --> 37:47.640
which is called as Chaitanya, Aum, Ruh,

37:47.840 --> 37:52.120
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, and all-pervading Power of God.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.480
That starts flowing through you, first time you feel them.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.520
Yesterday many people felt it, and people were very happy

37:57.680 --> 38:00.440
that so many felt it, because that’s a sign

38:00.600 --> 38:06.600
that here many people are going to get realization.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.680
You don’t have to go to anybody,

38:09.880 --> 38:13.120
you have to just practice a little bit and find out.

38:13.320 --> 38:15.800
You’ll become such an expert!

38:16.040 --> 38:19.560
One person in India who got realization

38:19.720 --> 38:24.440
has so far given realization to at least ten thousand people.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.640
In a village. Many villages.

38:27.840 --> 38:30.320
He’s a very ordinary man. We wanted him to come,

38:30.520 --> 38:34.800
but there was a kind of a visa problem, so he could not come.

38:35.040 --> 38:38.880
He’s a very simple farmer, and he got his realization,

38:39.120 --> 38:41.360
and he knows so much about Sahaja Yoga that you’ll be amazed;

38:41.560 --> 38:44.880
he has not been to any university, to any college or anything,

38:45.120 --> 38:46.560
but he’s so knowledgeable.

38:46.720 --> 38:50.320
Because once you have these vibrations they guide you.

38:50.520 --> 38:54.800
So the Spirit sitting in your heart

38:55.040 --> 38:59.760
guides you and tells you what is right and what is wrong.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.480
If you have to ask a question: “Mother, is there God?” —

39:04.640 --> 39:07.320
if you ask this question, immediately there will be

39:07.520 --> 39:11.080
a tremendous flow saying that it is there.

39:11.400 --> 39:14.560
Now, how to understand that these are the vibrations of God,

39:14.720 --> 39:16.600
also this question can come.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.720
We can judge them relatively.

39:18.960 --> 39:23.200
For example, in one of the programs in Pune,

39:23.400 --> 39:25.600
people invited Me to speak

39:25.800 --> 39:29.000
in a place which was owned by brahmins, and they opposed it.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.400
They said, “She’s not a brahmin, so we will not have her here.”

39:32.600 --> 39:34.440
So they said, “All right, we’ll publish in the newspaper —

39:34.600 --> 39:37.000
because Her name has gone in the newspaper — we’ll tell them

39:37.200 --> 39:40.280
that these people are so ‘brahminic’ that they don’t want to have Her.”

39:40.480 --> 39:42.440
Of course, they didn’t want to have that bad name,

39:42.600 --> 39:44.480
so they said, “All right, let’s have her.”

39:44.640 --> 39:47.120
These people never told Me what had happened.

39:47.320 --> 39:51.600
Suddenly I said, “Those who think who are brahmins, come down.”

39:51.800 --> 39:54.560
So four-five of them came and sat before Me.

39:54.720 --> 39:57.160
These are brahmins without knowing the Brahma!

39:57.360 --> 39:59.360
So I said, “All right, put your hands before Me.”

39:59.560 --> 40:02.080
And they just started shaking like this, going back.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.040
I said, “What’s happening to you?”

40:04.240 --> 40:05.560
So they said, “Mother, you are Shakti,

40:05.720 --> 40:08.400
that’s why it is happening to me, to us,”

40:08.600 --> 40:11.080
but I said, “What about others? It’s not happening to others.”

40:11.280 --> 40:12.640
So they turned round and said, “Look at these,

40:12.840 --> 40:14.960
they are also doing like this.”

40:15.160 --> 40:16.960
I said, “Ask them from where do they come.”

40:17.160 --> 40:18.680
They went and asked them; they said, “We are coming

40:18.880 --> 40:21.560
from the lunatic asylum of Thane.”

40:21.720 --> 40:24.520
So these fanatics, who believed that they were brahmins,

40:24.680 --> 40:29.360
were reacting the same way as these lunatics.

40:29.680 --> 40:31.440
And they believed that they were brahmins,

40:31.600 --> 40:33.360
they were not supposed to touch anybody,

40:33.560 --> 40:36.040
they were “untouchables” people, and they were …

40:36.240 --> 40:41.600
the one who gave them realization was from so-called untouchable,

40:41.800 --> 40:43.480
a shoemaker.

40:43.640 --> 40:45.800
Now he’s become their guru, of all these brahmins,

40:46.040 --> 40:49.080
and he’s teaching them about God.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.520
So this center gives you the power

40:52.680 --> 40:55.080
to be one with the whole.

40:55.280 --> 40:59.120
It has many powers, but the main power it gives you

40:59.320 --> 41:02.200
is the power to be one with the whole

41:02.400 --> 41:07.400
and to have all the powers of that deity within you awakened,

41:07.600 --> 41:12.400
so that you can become aware

41:12.600 --> 41:15.960
and make others also aware of it.

41:16.160 --> 41:19.440
Those people who talk too much catch on the right Vishuddhi,

41:19.600 --> 41:22.680
those who do not talk at all catch on the left.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.400
Those who feel guilty catch on the left,

41:25.600 --> 41:27.640
those who think they are all right and aggressive,

41:27.840 --> 41:29.960
they catch on the right. It’s like that.

41:30.160 --> 41:34.000
So this has to be understood in right perspective:

41:34.200 --> 41:38.280
that if you misuse this center, what happens to you,

41:38.480 --> 41:42.440
so how you should give yourself a balance to improve that.

41:42.600 --> 41:45.200
But the best part of Sahaja Yoga is this:

41:45.400 --> 41:48.720
that when you get them realization,

41:48.960 --> 41:50.640
they are separated from themselves.

41:50.840 --> 41:53.800
They’ll come and tell Me, “Mother, my Agnya Chakra is catching.”

41:54.040 --> 41:57.520
So, if you ask them, “Really?” — “Yes, Mother, very much.”

41:57.680 --> 42:01.640
That means they are suffering from too much ego.

42:01.840 --> 42:03.480
But can you imagine anybody saying,

42:03.640 --> 42:05.560
“Mother, I’m suffering from too much ego”?

42:05.720 --> 42:08.880
Because you are separated from yourself, you see your ego,

42:09.120 --> 42:10.600
the big balloonic-like thing,

42:10.760 --> 42:13.360
and you say, “Mother, please remove my ego.”

42:13.560 --> 42:15.360
That is how people talk to Me.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.240
They will tell Me: “Mother, I talk too much,

42:17.440 --> 42:19.280
that’s why my right Vishuddhi is catching.

42:19.480 --> 42:22.160
You better cure it, I must stop my talking too much.”

42:22.360 --> 42:23.960
So you start correcting yourself

42:24.160 --> 42:26.560
because you get separated from yourself,

42:26.720 --> 42:29.760
you become the Spirit; and the rest you see.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.480
Like I see My sari: if there’s a spot,

42:32.640 --> 42:35.600
I would like to clean it, I’m not identified with the spot.

42:35.760 --> 42:39.600
So, that’s how it happens; you are no more identified with yourself,

42:39.760 --> 42:43.280
and you start seeing the faults in you, and you try to correct it.

42:43.480 --> 42:46.840
That’s how you become a beautiful person — by your own attention,

42:47.080 --> 42:51.240
not by anybody else, it is you who has to do it.

42:51.520 --> 42:55.600
Now, we have a very important center here

42:55.800 --> 42:58.440
called as Agnya Chakra.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.600
This is bestowed upon

43:00.760 --> 43:06.080
by the great incarnation of Lord Jesus Christ.

43:06.560 --> 43:10.120
We have no idea as to how this incarnation

43:10.320 --> 43:12.240
has come on this earth.

43:12.440 --> 43:17.120
Because if you just read Bible, it is a little bit of Christ we see.

43:17.320 --> 43:20.200
They allowed Him to live only for about four years

43:20.400 --> 43:25.040
to talk to people; within four years He was killed.

43:25.240 --> 43:29.000
So He had no time to tell you all about it.

43:29.200 --> 43:32.160
But He did the job what He was supposed to do

43:32.360 --> 43:34.600
and which He achieved in His lifetime.

43:34.800 --> 43:37.160
But if you read some books,

43:37.360 --> 43:39.960
in other scriptures like Devi Mahatmyam,

43:40.160 --> 43:46.160
where the Goddess was the one who created Him —

43:47.440 --> 43:50.600
and how She created, and what She did to Him,

43:50.760 --> 43:52.840
and everything is given in detail —

43:53.080 --> 43:57.120
and in every detail, you’ll be surprised, is the life of Christ.

43:57.320 --> 44:01.240
Only thing, there He is called as Mahavishnu and not as Christ.

44:01.440 --> 44:04.440
But even the name of Christ comes to Him

44:04.600 --> 44:07.120
from the same heritage which I was telling you:

44:07.320 --> 44:09.880
that His name was Yeshu, not Jesus,

44:10.120 --> 44:12.840
because, in the Bible, I get Myself confused when I read

44:13.080 --> 44:18.760
that Anna was not Anna, it was Hannah, John was Johann —

44:19.000 --> 44:22.280
every name has been corrupted in the English Bible.

44:22.480 --> 44:26.960
In the same way they have corrupted Christ’s name, Yeshu, into Jesus.

44:27.160 --> 44:30.240
Actually, they call Him — some people, of course — call Him Jesu.

44:30.440 --> 44:34.120
This is the name given to Him by Shri Radhaji,

44:34.320 --> 44:37.400
the one who was the power of Shri Krishna.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.880
She's the one who gave Him this name

44:40.120 --> 44:43.240
because She was very much indebted

44:43.440 --> 44:46.760
to the foster mother of Shri Krishna, who was Yeshoda,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.880
and that’s why She called Him Yeshu.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.840
“Yeshu” is the word in Hebrew language,

44:53.080 --> 44:55.080
and we call Yeshoda as Yeshu;

44:55.280 --> 44:59.120
also some people, in a … what you call … in a country language,

44:59.320 --> 45:01.240
also call the same thing as Jesu.

45:01.440 --> 45:04.600
You know that Y and J is always sort of

45:04.800 --> 45:07.840
brought together in that way: like Yugoslavia, we call it —

45:08.080 --> 45:09.680
they call it Jugoslavia.

45:09.880 --> 45:12.720
So His name Yeshu came from that,

45:12.960 --> 45:15.960
and that’s how He was created a special one.

45:16.160 --> 45:19.960
In the Devi Mahatmyam it is said that Krishna has said

45:20.160 --> 45:24.440
that “You will become the support of the universe.”

45:25.040 --> 45:29.320
Now, in India, people and seers were waiting for Mahavishnu

45:29.520 --> 45:33.560
to come and tell them that, Mahavishnu has been born.

45:33.720 --> 45:36.000
But the people who went to India,

45:36.200 --> 45:39.040
they had Bible in one hand and the pistol in another hand,

45:39.240 --> 45:43.200
or a big gun, or maybe a huge big cannon.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.160
And that’s how they entered India,

45:45.360 --> 45:48.080
and they said that “You must get converted.”

45:48.280 --> 45:51.000
Now, what is a “conversion” God only knows. You can take a donkey

45:51.200 --> 45:53.040
and put a thing on that “You are a Christian” —

45:53.240 --> 45:54.880
you don’t become a Christian.

45:55.120 --> 45:57.360
That’s how they spread Christianity throughout India,

45:57.560 --> 45:59.840
which was all absurd type of Christianity.

46:00.080 --> 46:04.440
I was also born in one of the Protestant Christian families.

46:04.600 --> 46:07.440
My father was a realized soul, My mother was another,

46:07.600 --> 46:10.360
they were very learned people.

46:10.560 --> 46:13.360
And My father told Me, “God, look at this now,

46:13.560 --> 46:16.000
what are these Christians doing to Christ!”

46:16.200 --> 46:20.880
And he was the one who fought for Independence,

46:21.120 --> 46:23.960
he went to jail, My mother went to jail, and he was member

46:24.160 --> 46:26.880
of our constituent assembly, parliament and all that,

46:27.120 --> 46:29.520
but Christians only started recognizing him

46:29.680 --> 46:33.160
when he became a member of something or a mayor of a place.

46:33.360 --> 46:35.240
They had no other idea of a person,

46:35.440 --> 46:38.160
that somebody has Spiritual endowment

46:38.360 --> 46:41.320
or any sort of a Spiritual powers.

46:41.520 --> 46:44.120
Now, in our family,

46:44.320 --> 46:47.440
we were very much with Gandhiji, all of us;

46:47.600 --> 46:49.880
we had sacrificed a lot for the country,

46:50.120 --> 46:53.400
and My father decided to marry us all out of community,

46:53.600 --> 46:55.640
not among Christians, because he thought these Christians

46:55.840 --> 46:59.240
are so much worshipping these missionaries:

46:59.440 --> 47:02.720
they would even pray for their health,

47:02.960 --> 47:07.280
the health of their dog, and health of their umbrellas.

47:07.480 --> 47:10.320
It was such a wretched condition of these Christians in those days;

47:10.520 --> 47:14.400
I mean, they were so dedicated to these missionaries.

47:14.600 --> 47:17.840
The missionaries were only busy converting people.

47:18.080 --> 47:22.280
Now, this Mahavishnu Tattwa — the one who was born as Christ —

47:22.480 --> 47:25.120
was never understood, never told,

47:25.320 --> 47:28.360
they never read anything about it they never found out.

47:28.560 --> 47:32.560
So, Indians believed that so far Mahavishnu is not born,

47:32.720 --> 47:35.800
and so it continued with the idea

47:36.040 --> 47:38.080
that we have to still go on.

47:38.280 --> 47:41.280
Because in the principle Mahavishnu it was written

47:41.480 --> 47:44.480
that “Not only You will be the support of the universe,

47:44.640 --> 47:47.120
but You will have such purity within You,” —

47:47.320 --> 47:50.400
because He is the Omkara, He’s the Chaitanya,

47:50.600 --> 47:53.080
He’s the vibrations, that’s why He could walk,

47:53.280 --> 47:55.200
that’s why He was resurrected —

47:55.400 --> 47:59.560
that it was said that when His Advent will come,

47:59.720 --> 48:02.720
He will cross this path —

48:02.960 --> 48:05.440
this is the cross, the resurrection part —

48:05.600 --> 48:08.000
and, by His advancement,

48:08.200 --> 48:10.560
He will be able to suck in

48:10.720 --> 48:13.440
the ego and superego within you, the karmas,

48:13.600 --> 48:16.240
the conditionings, the ego in you,

48:16.440 --> 48:20.000
by which people will get their realization.

48:20.200 --> 48:22.680
So Indians continued with the idea

48:22.880 --> 48:27.560
that “We have to still pay for our karmas, Mahavishnu has not come.”

48:27.880 --> 48:29.880
Because of misrepresentation.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.840
Once I told them that Christ was Mahavishnu, you see,

48:33.080 --> 48:35.880
thousands are getting realization because they believe in Mahavishnu,

48:36.120 --> 48:39.200
they of course respect Christ very much, but they did not know

48:39.400 --> 48:42.720
that He was Mahavishnu; if He’s Mahavishnu, it’s perfect!

48:42.960 --> 48:46.000
And that’s how He was enlightened, and He got -

48:46.200 --> 48:48.960
the people got their realization in no time.

48:49.160 --> 48:51.600
Because they are educated in it, they know what it is.

48:51.760 --> 48:54.280
You see, these missionaries just read some Bible

48:54.480 --> 48:57.000
in some schools and all that and came down.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.880
But they did not know how to correlate the whole thing.

49:00.120 --> 49:02.400
You see, it cannot be truth just in Bible,

49:02.600 --> 49:04.960
it has to be everywhere.

49:05.160 --> 49:07.680
And that is what happened when they came down

49:07.880 --> 49:13.880
and they told us something which was not Christ.

49:14.720 --> 49:16.760
Now, this thing happens to us also:

49:17.000 --> 49:19.200
that when Kundalini rises,

49:19.400 --> 49:23.600
Christ is born within you here, He’s awakened within you.

49:23.760 --> 49:27.600
And when He is awakened, the ego and superego both are sucked in,

49:27.800 --> 49:29.800
and you get a space here;

49:30.040 --> 49:33.200
and when you get that space here, the Kundalini shoots off,

49:33.480 --> 49:38.240
and that’s how you feel the cool breeze on your head.

49:38.840 --> 49:43.080
I have given at least seven lectures continuously on Christ

49:43.280 --> 49:46.840
in a church called as Unity Church.

49:47.080 --> 49:49.400
It was, again, the unity and fraternity

49:49.600 --> 49:52.000
of all the horrible people.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.520
They were preaching about Rajneesh, preaching about …

49:54.680 --> 49:57.600
at least Rajneesh is antichrist, anybody can see.

49:57.760 --> 50:01.960
When Christ has said: “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes” —

50:02.160 --> 50:04.960
to that extent His purity has gone —

50:05.160 --> 50:09.000
how can you accept Rajneesh as a guru for any Spirituality?

50:09.200 --> 50:12.120
But they had books from all kinds of horrible people.

50:12.320 --> 50:14.680
They had no books which were ancient books with them,

50:14.880 --> 50:17.360
nothing, no knowledge of any kind!

50:17.560 --> 50:19.760
Indians don’t depend — the real Indians, I mean,

50:20.000 --> 50:21.640
not the westernized pseudo-Indians

50:21.840 --> 50:23.480
who have been to Cambridge and Oxford —

50:23.640 --> 50:25.960
but those who are real Indians don’t depend on these books:

50:26.160 --> 50:28.800
they think it’s all trash that has come and will go away,

50:29.040 --> 50:31.160
it has no meaning.

50:31.360 --> 50:36.520
And they had all these books put there to destroy.

50:36.680 --> 50:38.960
Really the unity within us lies —

50:39.160 --> 50:41.880
when you become collectively conscious.

50:42.120 --> 50:45.560
All this work has been done in the ancient times.

50:45.720 --> 50:48.680
As Mohammed was one of the Prophets who came,

50:48.880 --> 50:53.320
out of the ten Prophets: Moses, Abraham,

50:53.600 --> 50:56.600
Lao Tse …

50:56.880 --> 51:01.520
then we had also people like other Prophets …

51:01.680 --> 51:04.120
Socrates…

51:04.320 --> 51:07.320
Recently, we had in India the last one,

51:07.520 --> 51:11.480
is the Sai Nath — not the “Satya” one, but the Sai Nath —

51:11.640 --> 51:14.240
who lived … who was representing

51:14.440 --> 51:20.160
this great principle of Primordial Master.

51:20.360 --> 51:23.880
So this is the story of your evolution.

51:24.120 --> 51:27.720
The last is the most important center, is the Sahasrara,

51:27.960 --> 51:34.320
which is open today, open from 1970, 5 May,

51:34.600 --> 51:40.600
that we can feel the Sahasrara opening out.

51:40.880 --> 51:44.160
About this center also, if you go to My center,

51:44.360 --> 51:47.240
you’ll find many, many tapes

51:47.440 --> 51:49.360
which will explain to you this center.

51:49.560 --> 51:51.560
The only thing is that all the seats

51:51.720 --> 51:57.320
of all the subtle centers within us

51:57.520 --> 52:00.400
lie along the line like this.

52:00.600 --> 52:04.080
And all the centers are within us. This is the Agnya Chakra.

52:04.280 --> 52:07.120
And that’s how it moves: this is the Vishuddhi Chakra,

52:07.320 --> 52:11.600
this is the Heart, this is the Nabhi,

52:11.760 --> 52:14.320
what you call the solar plexus;

52:14.520 --> 52:18.760
then we have got, in the center here, is the Mooladhara,

52:19.000 --> 52:23.760
and around it is what you call the Swadhishthana.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
That’s why when Swadhishthana goes out

52:26.200 --> 52:28.600
or you get diabetes, you get blindness.

52:28.760 --> 52:32.760
Blindness is due to the fact that your Swadhisthana is not all right.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.400
Many people get blind when their eyes open —

52:35.600 --> 52:37.480
can be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

52:37.640 --> 52:40.600
In Geneva I cured a lady in ten minutes time.

52:40.800 --> 52:43.120
It’s all due to possessions that you get here.

52:43.320 --> 52:47.000
Coming to the Agnya Chakra, one has to say that all these chakras

52:47.200 --> 52:49.360
have movement on both the sides:

52:49.560 --> 52:51.400
one moves to the collective subconscious,

52:51.600 --> 52:53.840
another moves to the collective supraconscious.

52:54.080 --> 52:57.240
Now, if at the Agnya Chakra you start moving like that,

52:57.440 --> 53:00.880
in the collective subconscious you start seeing

53:01.120 --> 53:03.320
all the dead things:

53:03.520 --> 53:06.560
like great deities,

53:06.720 --> 53:10.320
or you can also start think … past, we can say.

53:10.520 --> 53:13.600
If you move to the right, then you start seeing colors,

53:13.760 --> 53:18.360
and also you start seeing lights and all those things.

53:18.560 --> 53:19.960
With LSD also you can do it.

53:20.160 --> 53:23.240
If you take LSD … many people who used to take LSD

53:23.440 --> 53:26.200
and were suffering from coma just came to Me,

53:26.400 --> 53:29.240
and they just never saw Me, they just saw the lights.

53:29.440 --> 53:33.400
So, that is not the right thing to see Me as light

53:33.600 --> 53:35.160
or as some previous deity —

53:35.360 --> 53:37.720
is to see Me as I am, is the present.

53:37.960 --> 53:40.280
So we have to be in the present.

53:40.480 --> 53:43.520
Sahaja Yoga brings you to the present moment,

53:43.680 --> 53:48.440
by which you enjoy every moment of life in its all dynamics,

53:48.600 --> 53:51.120
and that’s how you become a dynamic,

53:51.320 --> 53:55.680
loving, affectionate, relaxed personality.

53:55.880 --> 53:57.600
May God bless you all!
