1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,583


2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:06,542
It is my immense joy

3
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:15,920
to see all of you here from various parts of this world.

4
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,097
When your heart is so full,

5
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:29,454
the words are too poor to carry the intensity.

6
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:41,511
I wish you could understand that intensity, through your heart.

7
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:48,200
It’s all been arranged, I think, by the Divine,

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,626
that we should meet here all of us

9
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:57,228
in such a wonderful surrounding, in the Nature.

10
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:01,179
That something great should happen to all of us.

11
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:10,059
That we should achieve really something great this time.

12
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:19,743
Now as the time is short, I will tell you, first of all,

13
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:25,969
a few things about meditation now,

14
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:31,949
then we’ll have two more talks, I hope so.

15
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:38,116


16
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:47,358
‘Meditation’ is a very general word. It is not a word that explains

17
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:53,519
all the three steps one has to take for meditating.

18
00:01:53,727 --> 00:02:01,858
But in Sanskrit language, they have very clearly said

19
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:07,971
how you have to move in your meditation.

20
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:14,639
First is called as dhyana,

21
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,702
and second is called as dharana,

22
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:23,359
and the third is called as samadhi.

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,009
Luckily Sahaja Yoga is a, such a thing that you get everything in a bundle.

24
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,159
You avoided everything else and you got the samadhi part.

25
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:41,085
That’s the beauty of it. Firstly the dhyana.

26
00:02:43,717 --> 00:02:49,921
First, when you have seeking,

27
00:02:50,121 --> 00:03:02,460
you put your attention towards the object of your worship.

28
00:03:02,902 --> 00:03:07,372
That’s called as ‘dhyana’.

29
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:14,816
And the dharana is the one in which you

30
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:20,879
put all your effort, concentrate all your effort.

31
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,381
But this is all drama for people who are not Realised.

32
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:34,630
For them it’s just a sort of an acting that they do,

33
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:42,879
but for a Realised-soul it is a reality.

34
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:50,677
So the first, the dhyana, you have to do.

35
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:55,633


36
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,980
Some do it of the Form, another of the Formless.

37
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:08,988
But you are so fortunate that the Formless has become a Form for you.

38
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,406
No problem. You don’t have to go from form to formless

39
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:20,273
and from formless to form, it’s all there, in a bundle!

40
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:36,649
So you concentrate or think of some deity

41
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:44,489
or some point for nirakar, for the Formless or of nirakar itself.

42
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,739
It’s also mental projection as long as you are not a Realised-soul.

43
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:58,182
But once you are Realised,
you have to just think of dhyana:

44
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:06,170
[on] whom you are going

45
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,810
to concentrate or you can say, meditate on.

46
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,729
But once you start meditating on a person, your attention starts moving.

47
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:25,430


48
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,619
That is also possible after Realisation.

49
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,787
Though it’s in a bundle, but some people have it, part of it,

50
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:30,460
part of it, like that. So when you meditate,

51
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:38,940
still your attention can get disturbed every moment.

52
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,540
It can happen, depending on the intensity of your concentration.

53
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,499
So there are some Sahaja Yogis, I have seen,

54
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:54,539
they are cooking, and there’s another one who is meditating.

55
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:01,528
The meditating one will say, "Oh I can smell it is burning."

56
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:06,463


57
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:10,459
So there is no dharana.

58
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,419
‘Dhaar’ means a flow, a continuous flow.

59
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,299
So there is no dharana. Dhyana is there, but not dharana.

60
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,151
The second part of it is very important,

61
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:33,019
that you have to put your attention continuously onto your deity.

62
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,213
Then you develop a state, which is called as ‘dharana’,

63
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:47,419
in which your attention becomes one with the deity.

64
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,539
But when these mature, the third stage of samadhi comes in.

65
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,957
Now for people who think that, without Realisation, they can do it,

66
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:04,859
I think they are absolutely mistaken.

67
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:15,576
But after Realisation also, when the dharana is established,

68
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:23,660
you have to get to the position where you become samadhi.

69
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,258
Now, what is that state?

70
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:37,046
When that state comes into your mind, then whatever you do,

71
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:43,362
the deity that you worship,

72
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:48,991
you see that deity in your work.

73
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:56,318
Whatever you see, you see the deity giving you the show.

74
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,700
You can put it like that.

75
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:09,180
Whatever you hear, you find the deity telling you the Truth.

76
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:17,020
Whatever you read, you find there what the deity would tell you.

77
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,945
So in that state, whatever you do

78
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:30,540
with your eyes, nose and all these organs,

79
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:37,802
all that becomes a kind of a manifestation

80
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:43,623
of the deity whom you worship, automatically.

81
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:47,099
You don’t have to think, "Now I must concentrate, alright.

82
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,539
I will not have these thoughts, I have to now think about this."

83
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,932
It becomes automatically that.

84
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,347
You read a book, in that book immediately you find

85
00:08:58,547 --> 00:09:01,340
what is good for Sahaja Yoga.

86
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,153
If there’s a book, which is anti-God, you discard it.

87
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:09,103


88
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:09,579
Just call Marina there.

89
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:22,101
But if you have a problem,

90
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:32,380
you see that, "It must be for some lesson to me.

91
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,740
That it is to teach me some experience."

92
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,220
It is the manifestation of the deity itself.

93
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,819
For example a lady feels she is going to have an abortion,

94
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,593
take a position.

95
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:54,940
So one person who is not yet in samadhi avasta,

96
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,965
or condition, will say, "Oh God, I am such a Sahaja Yogi,

97
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:04,505
I have done so much for Mother. I went all the way to Pulborough thing,

98
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:09,603
and, despite that, see, this is the problem!"

99
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,820
But another would say that, "Alright let me try. I’ll go and tell Mother."

100
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,739
On the photograph, or maybe telephone, something.

101
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,940
And he’ll find, to his surprise, that it’s all done.

102
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,780
It’s perfectly alright.

103
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,780
This is only possible if you are a Realised-soul, otherwise not possible.

104
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,475
So the state that is awakened within you is called,

105
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:41,278
is a new state of mind, in Sanskrit language

106
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:44,676
it has a very beautiful name is ‘Rutumbhara Pradnya’.

107
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:49,029
Which is a very difficult name. Rutumbhara Pradnya.

108
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,820
Rutumbhara means the whole, Rutumbhara is the name of the Nature.

109
00:10:54,020 --> 00:11:02,975
And that the whole Nature, one feels, is enlightened.

110
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:06,563


111
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,877
I’ll give an example: when a child is to be born,

112
00:11:09,077 --> 00:11:15,730
the mother starts lactating, automatically.

113
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,620
The Nature itself works out for the birth of the child.

114
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,041
In the same way, when this Rutumbhara Pradnya,

115
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:33,803
starts expressing itself - only for Sahaja Yogis, nobody else -

116
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:39,436


117
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:36,500
you are amazed how things work out suddenly.

118
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:39,362
Rutumbhara Pradnya it works out.

119
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:45,260
Now the time is very short, but I’ll give you an example.

120
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,434
I came to Brighton,

121
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:53,260
and Jason said, "Mother let’s have Guru Puja in Brighton".

122
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,940
I said, "Alright, have it, but you find out the place."

123
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,140
So he went to the university, said, "The university people will help,

124
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,660
but it’s rather small and…" I said, "But ask them".

125
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,985
"But no, it’s booked on Guru Puja." Then I said,

126
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,780
"Then what can you do?" He said, "Then what to do Mother?"

127
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,179
I said, "You try somewhere else just now, telephone to somebody else."

128
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,873
So he went through yellow pages, I don’t know what, and he telephoned,

129
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:21,687
and they said, "We have a place, a beautiful place,

130
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:27,751
and you come along and have lunch with us."

131
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:30,619
And just he went there, he had a very nice lunch,

132
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:33,739
they were very happy [that] they were to accommodate everyone.

133
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,468
They were very nice, and he was amazed

134
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:40,229
how everything has worked out so well.

135
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:47,600
So the Rutumbhara Pradnya has started working in your favour.

136
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,537
You all tell me, "This is a miracle, that has happened Mother,

137
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:54,244
and we don’t know how it has happened!" I’ll give you an example:

138
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:57,266
Yesterday, you we were doing something with cement

139
00:12:57,466 --> 00:13:01,519
and the Italian boy said that we’ll need two bags of cement.

140
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,720
I said, "You carry on, it won’t finish!" Even before I was leaving,

141
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:09,122
they were carrying on, still not finished!

142
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:14,592
Now cement of all the things. Imagine!

143
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,838


144
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:20,433
So this special thing is your own state,

145
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,704
where you are feeling the oneness with the Nature

146
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,771
and the Nature is feeling oneness with you.

147
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:31,420
So the Divine itself is expressing through Nature,

148
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:39,022
through various happenings, through various incidents –

149
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:47,679
the Love, the protection, the attention that the Divine is giving.

150
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,910
And there’s no end to it.

151
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:58,960
It just happens, and people don’t know how it happens.

152
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,320
But that is what is the state of samadhi.

153
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,360
But there could be people if I tell them,

154
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,360
"Will you do this?" "Oh no Mother! The shop will be closed."

155
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,053
"Oh, They won’t do it!" "That’s not alright".

156
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,713
They go on like that. And there are people

157
00:14:18,913 --> 00:14:22,480
who say, "No! Let’s see. If Mother has said – maybe."

158
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,238
I’ll give you another simple example, very simple, absolutely gross,

159
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:31,920
but it’s there: One day Mr. Shrivastava, he takes one type of tea.

160
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,347
Very English.

161
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:41,049
And he wouldn’t like other tea. So he told me, "Oh God,

162
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:44,159
we are finished with the tea and what to do tomorrow morning?"

163
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,801
I said, "It’s alright, let us go to the tea shop."

164
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:52,160
So he said, "It is eight o’clock in the night and what do you mean?

165
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,479
They’ll all laugh at us! There is no shop at eight o’clock open."

166
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,640
That tea centre. I said, "Let’s go! What’s the harm.

167
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,799
I am just saying ‘let’s go!’ " But he said,

168
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,680
"What absurd things you are saying!" I said, "Alright, absurd whatever it is.

169
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,538
Let’s go!"

170
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,131
So he wouldn’t listen so I told the driver "Alright, let’s drive down!"

171
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:11,840
We went there. And the lights were on.

172
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:13,936


173
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,839
We said, "Eh! How is it the lights are on?" (laughter)

174
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,435
So we walked in, you see, very peevishly.

175
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:22,640
And they all were there standing, "Oh we’ve been waiting for you

176
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:24,937


177
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,825
such a long time, you know, and you are the last to come!"

178
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,639
Just imagine! So I asked my husband.

179
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,867
He said, "I forgot we had a reception here!" (laughter).

180
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:36,983


181
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,880
And they said, "You are the last to arrive!"

182
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:43,747
And they said, "Alright, doesn’t matter but you’ll have your presents!"

183
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:49,621
So they gave us two tins each of tea! (laughter)

184
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:54,133


185
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,609


186
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,079
I mean, there are thousand and one examples like that.

187
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,719
Today like some were trying to push the bed.

188
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,520
The three of them were trying, it would not push.

189
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,280
I said, "Alright, I’ll push it." I just put my Nabhi there.

190
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,276
Just, I didn’t push anything, it just pushed.

191
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:19,723


192
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,442
Because of the Rutumbhara Pradnya .

193
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:23,051
But this is not chamatkar (miracle) or anything.

194
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:29,087
It exists in the Divine the capacity to manifest it’s love,

195
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:36,180
to show that you are the saints, you are the chosen ones of God.

196
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,232
But you accept that situation first. But if you behave

197
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:42,620
like all other normal people, "Oh God, the shops are closed,

198
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:46,586
and that man is so difficult, and I don’t think it will happen",

199
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,599
never happen.

200
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,055
But you must know you are saints,

201
00:16:53,255 --> 00:17:02,529
chosen, and given birth by me, the Form and the Formless.

202
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,360
So this Pradnya is going to manifest, is manifesting every moment,

203
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,130
be prepared, be happy, welcome it,

204
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:17,867
and accept that you are that.
The level is different.

205
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:21,820
Was done? Alright?

206
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,966


207
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:26,433
Five minutes more.

208
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:33,159
I should blame anything that side.

209
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:35,203


210
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,239
Alright.

211
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:46,040
Now the time has come for Sahaja Yoga to change it’s level.

212
00:17:46,256 --> 00:17:50,343


213
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:56,341
We have to change, we have to go higher, the level has to come up.

214
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,516
But Sahaja Yoga is such a cosmopolitan thing

215
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:08,118
that we have got the worst bhoots
to the highest, on the same plate.

216
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:12,559
Now, some of them are round ones,

217
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:19,599
which are the ego-oriented ones, who roll all the time.

218
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,360
They don’t know how to raise the plate.
If you raise the plate they’ll roll down.

219
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,637
So you are frightened you have to hold them.

220
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:35,280
And there are some who are squares.

221
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,923


222
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:41,475
And the square ones are carrying other squares on their heads, like bhoots.

223
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:45,368
So if you raise them they may all topple down,

224
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:49,840
or maybe the bhoots might fall off. God knows.

225
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,520
But there are third type who are prisms, who are like pyramids,

226
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,971
who are nicely settled down, whatever level you raise them,

227
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:04,359
they are stuck there.

228
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:07,503


229
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:14,560
So those who are at the periphery are a problem, definitely, for me,

230
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:21,043
because in my compassion, I cannot throw them out.

231
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:22,966


232
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:26,505
And we have to help them to come out,

233
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:32,823
by really now, telling them, that they have to rise.

234
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:38,950
How long are we to wait for them?

235
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:43,774
Everyone has to see that the peripheral people

236
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:51,165
are brought in properly so that they don’t go out of Sahaja Yoga.

237
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:56,011
Compassion is alright,

238
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:57,300


239
00:19:56,211 --> 00:20:04,640
but not at the cost of keeping the level of Sahaja Yoga lower, never.

240
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:12,248
We have to raise the level of people
who are well settled in Sahaja Yoga.

241
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:16,550
So everybody must try to settle down

242
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:23,966
and come up to minimum standards at least.

243
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:29,605
Otherwise, I am sorry, many will be sieved out.

244
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:32,955
That’s for the five minutes!

245
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:37,461
I’ll have another, I think, one hour or so,

246
00:20:37,661 --> 00:20:40,880
one and a half hour later on today.

247
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:45,228
Please. Thank you very much.

248
00:20:44,037 --> 00:20:48,496


249
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:53,688
I would say that somebody should translate it if possible.

250
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,650


251
00:20:56,828 --> 00:20:59,508
Is it possible to translate?

252
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:01,714
Yogi: We could translate it afterwards, Mother.

253
00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:07,108
In French then to be told them Rutumbhara Pradnya and all that.

254
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:10,045
Later on you can translate.

255
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:18,185
I mean those who have to go for lunch now should be English then.

256
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:28,995
Then he can explain it, the first part, as you please, I don’t know.

257
00:21:29,196 --> 00:21:33,155
Those who are staying here, should not, those who are come, should.

258
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:35,888
Is wrong.

259
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:44,040
The guests must be looked after, I mean, the other way round.

260
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:46,510


261
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:48,815
Now we have to divide in two halves,

262
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:51,242
but I would say those who understand English should go

263
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,029
because then Gregoire can speak about this

264
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:59,305
and somebody can translate also in Italian.

265
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:01,727
Gregoire: Shri Mother, I’m sorry,

266
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:05,379
but it’s already divided with numbers in two lots,

267
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,376
so I think the first number has just to go.

268
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,457
Shri Mataji: Is it already divided?
Gregoire: Yes it’s already…

269
00:22:11,658 --> 00:22:14,241
Shri Mataji: …organised!!!
Gregoire: Organised.

270
00:22:14,442 --> 00:22:16,590
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

271
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:20,818
I didn’t know who is here unhappy.

272
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:23,732
Both of you have come?
Yogi: Mother?

273
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:26,366
Shri Mataji: Only two of you have come? Yogi: Three.

274
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:29,930
Shri Mataji: Who is?
Yogi: Alfredo and Ricardo.

275
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:35,783


276
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,787
Shri Mataji: Who?
Yogi: Alfredo and Ricardo.

277
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:36,794
Shri Mataji: Good, good. Busy hai! Good. So how are you?

278
00:22:36,995 --> 00:22:38,509
Yogi: I’m alright now.

279
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,683
Shri Mataji: ….substantially support Sahaja Yoga.

280
00:22:41,884 --> 00:22:54,748
Like Dr. Warren has brought a very good extract, I think.

281
00:22:54,949 --> 00:22:58,365
Is it an extract? Gavin: Yes
you read it Mother, you read it.

282
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:07,120
Shri Mataji: Just imagine! He was a Catholic Christian church fellow

283
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,432
who could say all these things so clearly and see so clearly.

284
00:23:13,303 --> 00:23:17,743


285
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:23,096
And this book, you see, Essenes, that a book.

286
00:23:23,297 --> 00:23:38,088
But now Rustom told me that he has found out, in the Koran,

287
00:23:38,288 --> 00:23:47,538
that the Kundalini resides in the triangular bone is called as Asus.

288
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:50,571
And at the time of Resurrection,

289
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:56,286
this will be raised and people will get their Realisation.

290
00:23:56,486 --> 00:24:00,549
Can you imagine?

291
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,985
The second thing he said, the same thing which has written in these books

292
00:24:06,185 --> 00:24:12,913
that there are seven firmaments and there are seven powers.

293
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:16,161
Can you imagine?

294
00:24:16,362 --> 00:24:20,658
All that is described in the Koran and what are these Muslims doing

295
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:24,420
and what are these Christians doing?

296
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:27,378
But even those who knew, the Hindus, so-called,

297
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:30,957
what are they doing? Stupid.

298
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:34,228
Everybody seems to be stupid.

299
00:24:34,428 --> 00:24:39,440
You can’t blame those who knew and you can’t blame those did not.

300
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,141
They are just the same.

301
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:49,031
It’s very clearly written all about the seven chakras and everything

302
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:51,679
since the Patanjali.

303
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,992
But who is seeking God?

304
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,010


305
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,127
But these discoveries are coming up and they are going to substantiate

306
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:08,799
and you are going to talk to these people

307
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:16,039
about the kind of things they have been doing to the essence of religion.

308
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,005
But these are authentic things.

309
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:25,665
People want to believe into something that has happened.

310
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:34,696
That’s a good thing in a way because we have some certificates.

311
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:37,763


312
00:25:37,963 --> 00:25:41,800


313
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:47,040
Nobody wants to ask any questions to me?

314
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,049
Because one third is missing so I would like to speak

315
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:55,123
about general things later on.

316
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:59,154
Yes, yes.

317
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:03,011
Yogi: We were just talking about your comments.

318
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:05,911
For example in Islam we were talking about the Mahedi

319
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:10,903
who looks like a Muslim with a beard.

320
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:13,297


321
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:16,594
Yes.

322
00:26:16,795 --> 00:26:21,413
In Islam we were talking about the Mahedi who looks like a Muslim with a beard.

323
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:27,080
And in Buddhism they are talking about a Maitreya who is like a man.

324
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:31,962
Every religion is talking about a coming who is in their own form,

325
00:26:32,162 --> 00:26:36,620
I mean, projecting. What about this?

326
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,063
But they are all talking about your coming.

327
00:26:42,264 --> 00:26:48,160
Many of these scriptures are mutilated and changed also.

328
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:54,890
And Buddha is, of course, is a laughing Buddha.

329
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,065
They think of ‘laughing Buddha’.

330
00:26:58,265 --> 00:27:04,320
Then because it was Mohammed Sahib they think of a fakir.

331
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:12,854
Because your mind is like a projector,

332
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:19,612
and the film is what you have seen before, like Mohammed Sahib.

333
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:27,625
So the mind projects it and you get Mohammed Sahib as the image.

334
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,680
So whatever film you are using, it depends on [that].

335
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,187
But whatever has happened never happens again.

336
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:44,430
So if you have seen with the film, say, for example,

337
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:48,720
if you have made a film, it’s made once for all.

338
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,404
You do not make the same film, do you?

339
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:56,443


340
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,458
I mean you are having "Mouse Trap" (play in London theatre) for so many days here,

341
00:27:57,658 --> 00:28:00,960
for example.

342
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,607
But every time you see that, acting changes.

343
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:12,577
And every two, three years the actors also change.

344
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:15,527
So though the essence is the same going on,

345
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:17,483


346
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:21,876
the same thing is now going to be repeated.
Mohammed Sahib’s life is not going to be repeated.

347
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:26,025
Nor is He going to come in the way he came as a fakir.

348
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:34,177
No. That has never happened in the history, why will it happen?

349
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:37,360
So every time whatever has to happen has to be new.

350
00:28:35,656 --> 00:28:39,283


351
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:47,797
That’s the style the Nature is. It doesn’t
want to bore you say with the same (laughing).

352
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,080
And that kind of life [is] no more needed also.

353
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,271
And thirdly, as the seed grows,

354
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:03,836
first the roots have to fight a lot to embed the seed,

355
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:10,118
and then shoot has to fight a lot, but when the tree is there,

356
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:16,590
then it supports others, it helps others.

357
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:22,830
It becomes a strong flowering plant or a flowering tree.

358
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:29,870
So the whole thing is changed every moment, which is no more the seed.

359
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:35,082
But people want to see
the seed again. Why?

360
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:42,190
You are identified. It’s very subtle identification.

361
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:48,008
Christians are more identified with Christ than with Mohammed Sahib.

362
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,590
Why?

363
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:56,830
While the Muslims are much more identified with Mohammed Sahib.

364
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:01,142
But why?

365
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,691
Is there any reason?

366
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:10,525
They equally intensely identified, for no rhyme and reason.

367
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,110
None of Them gave them Realisation.

368
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:22,270
They told the same thing. But why this identification so much with this?

369
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:27,370
Now, when you are walking, you are thirsty, you see a river,

370
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,473
whether it is the river

371
00:30:32,673 --> 00:30:38,990
Ganges or Jamuna or any other river, if you are thirsty,  you will drink.

372
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,870
You won’t say, "No, I won’t drink because the Ganges is not here."

373
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:48,030
Now supposing I, say, in London, "I will
only have the Ganges water." Will I have?

374
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,910
But there are mad people I tell you, even in India.

375
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:56,376
I was told some people brought the water of Ganges and the clay from there

376
00:30:56,577 --> 00:31:03,990
to clean their hands here, from India. I mean they can do it.

377
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:09,297


378
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,670
This is what Sahaja Yogis must understand:

379
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,230
that drop out your identifications with the past life.

380
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:21,230
If you are born a Christian, alright, so what?

381
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:28,110
Now you are a Sahaja Yogi. If you are born as a Muslim, so what?

382
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:32,742
Now you are a Sahaja Yogi. The second part, what happens to you,

383
00:31:32,943 --> 00:31:36,074
I’ll tell you when we have the second lecture

384
00:31:36,274 --> 00:31:44,184
that, as a Sahaja Yogi, how things drop out, automatically.

385
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,750
Alright?

386
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,414
So these people

387
00:31:49,614 --> 00:31:53,390
are not the ones who are really following any religion whatsoever.

388
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,550
They are following their ego religion, that’s what.

389
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,430
There’s no religion in this kind of thing.

390
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,955
So all these identifications just should drop out

391
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,882
when you understand.

392
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:13,538
Only there’s one way of convincing them is to show

393
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:17,469
that all of them who have died,

394
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:24,190
who are no more here, have said that Sahaja Yoga is going to come.

395
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:30,759
That’s the only way you can convince these hard nuts.

396
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:36,575
This is the problem.

397
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:39,177


398
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:43,463


399
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:46,183


400
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:51,430
But surprisingly Muslims never talk of Resurrection.

401
00:32:51,631 --> 00:32:54,134
They are not botheredabout Resurrection. They are only worried

402
00:32:54,335 --> 00:32:56,749
about the doomsday, like French.

403
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:58,150


404
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,630
French are now thinking that doomsday going to come definitely.

405
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,614
I mean somebody asked me, "Are You sure it’s going to come or it’s postponed?"

406
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:10,019
I said, "Postponed, forever" (laughing).

407
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,967


408
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:18,154
Very seriously, I tell you. Very serious people asked me that,

409
00:33:18,354 --> 00:33:23,550
"What do you say if doomsday is coming or not?"

410
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:31,036
And they were quite disappointed because they were banking upon it (laughing).

411
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:33,963


412
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,439
This could be with anyone. I am just saying French,

413
00:33:38,263 --> 00:33:40,633


414
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:42,806
because they were French who asked me, but could be anyone.

415
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:49,353
I mean don’t be identified again.

416
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:51,857


417
00:33:52,057 --> 00:33:54,517


418
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:57,636
Like I was telling today that they show advertisements sometimes,

419
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:04,565
so horrible that they will show as if some miracle is going to happen

420
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:08,286
and suddenly lot of ice will break, this will happen, that will happen

421
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:12,964
and what will come out is a lager.

422
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:17,699
I mean really from sublime to ridiculous. Horrible.

423
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:22,990
You just can’t understand that. But I really laughed you know one day.

424
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,067
There was a gentleman sitting, he said, "Why did you laugh?"

425
00:34:26,268 --> 00:34:29,150
I said, "What is this? Sublime to ridiculous!" He said, "What do you mean?

426
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,199


427
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:36,834
I like my beer!" I said, "Sorry!" That’s it.

428
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,670
The identification is like that, you see.

429
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:47,990
Even ridiculous things start looking so fine if you identified.

430
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:57,662
I hope all of you are Sahaja Yogis here.

431
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:04,110
Or they are still Doubting Thomas’s sitting?

432
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:09,778
They will have a bad time, I must say.

433
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,777


434
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:15,573
It’s a very powerful session.

435
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,175
Now don’t you worry.

436
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:26,922
Don’t doubt yourself, it’s alright.

437
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:35,763
What about other questions? That was a good one.

438
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,772
Don’t depend on their images.

439
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:47,836
That’s why these days most of the gurus are keeping dadees.

440
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,003


441
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:56,750
It’s very easy to grow there. I can’t.

442
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,013
But for any person to grow is alright.

443
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:03,053
When you feel they don’t grow, they can’t put on one.

444
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:07,976
So do become angry with them?

445
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,911
Yogini: What happens with those people

446
00:36:11,111 --> 00:36:15,371
who got Realisation from you at your programmes,

447
00:36:13,856 --> 00:36:16,936


448
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:20,670
At your programmes, but they don’t getting to Sahaja Yoga,

449
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,163
what happens with them?

450
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:26,110
Shri Mataji: They don’t grow, they are dwarves.

451
00:36:24,957 --> 00:36:27,437


452
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:32,321
Yogini: They just - what’s the meaning of that?

453
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,870


454
00:36:32,522 --> 00:36:39,694
That’s very bad to be a seed which has been sprouted and goes to waste.

455
00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:48,273
Is a real waste, because which is
not sprouted, may one day sprout.

456
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:53,509
It’s a real waste I tell you. But mostly they come back,

457
00:36:53,709 --> 00:37:00,556
quite dwarf, but come back. They go, come, like that, you see.

458
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:05,078
There’s no understanding

459
00:37:05,278 --> 00:37:11,790
about the graveness of this kind of a shallow behaviour.

460
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:15,710
They don’t understand, that’s why they behave like that.

461
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,030
But then they get something horrible, then they come to Sahaja Yoga.

462
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,230
They go into problems then they come, but the progress is so little.

463
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:29,659
I mean the one who must have come with them goes much higher.

464
00:37:31,003 --> 00:37:34,130


465
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,870
So what is the programme in the evening?

466
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,555
How are you going to do it?

467
00:37:40,756 --> 00:37:42,696
Gavin Brown: Do you mean the one that is written on the programme, Mother?

468
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:49,143
Shri Mataji: Alright, it’s all organised?

469
00:37:47,843 --> 00:37:51,277


470
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,697


471
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:59,953
If Sahaja Yogis organise I have to obey! (laughter)

472
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,630


473
00:38:05,222 --> 00:38:08,590
Gavin: In the afternoon it’s a writers meeting with the publisher.

474
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,803
Shri Mataji: What the meeting?
Gavin: Writers.

475
00:38:11,004 --> 00:38:16,432
They said, "Before you arrive." You have arrived though.

476
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:18,829
Shri Mataji: What was it?

477
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,869
It says, "Writers collective meeting with publisher (venue to be announced).

478
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:28,576
Or b) Bhajan rehearsal in lecture hall."

479
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:31,800
Shri Mataji: So who were the writers?

480
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:35,688
Gavin: It doesn’t say.

481
00:38:33,597 --> 00:38:38,010


482
00:38:36,654 --> 00:38:41,709
(laughter) Then it says, "More spontaneous and unplanned events."

483
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:44,242


484
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:46,239
Shri Mataji: Gavin, are you writing poetry?

485
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,710
Gavin: It’s not me who has written, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Who is written? You?

486
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,929
You yourself?
Gavin: This is Jason.

487
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,144
I am just reading it out.

488
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:57,160
Shri Mataji: They said that, "Likha Mose padel tha…"

489
00:38:57,361 --> 00:39:00,119
The Moses have written and the one who knows about Moses has written,

490
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:03,469
is only Isa, means Jesus Christ.

491
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,984
So what is it? "Spontaneously…"?

492
00:39:06,185 --> 00:39:13,273
Gavin: "Spontaneous and unplanned events and preparation for Shri Mataji’s arrival."

493
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:21,587
Shri Mataji: He is playing safe! Alright, then.

494
00:39:21,788 --> 00:39:30,589
Gavin: "Then four o’clock pm, approximately, Shri Mataji arrives.

495
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,792
This is subject to change."

496
00:39:35,496 --> 00:39:37,066
Shri Mataji: Alright, then.

497
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:39,701
Gavin: Then there’s nothing [scheduled] until seven o’clock.

498
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:43,437
Shri Mataji: Ah, then, nothing
until seven o’clock? That’s the way.

499
00:39:43,638 --> 00:39:46,590
Now. Should I tell you?

500
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,057
Let’s have it like that, spontaneously.

501
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:52,731
I have arrived earlier.

502
00:39:52,931 --> 00:40:00,692
So what we do now [is] you have your lunch and rest for a while.

503
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,459
And then, after the lunch, about an hour or so you,

504
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:09,310
come along and assemble here.

505
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,230
And you have a thing called that ‘Brain Trust’ business.

506
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:16,755
Where you talk to each other, have a rapport,

507
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,790
ask questions, tell people, like that. It’s a very good thing.

508
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,510
You appoint some people for that.

509
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,510
Go about like that till you have your tea.

510
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:31,982
Then after tea I’ll take over. Alright?

511
00:40:32,957 --> 00:40:37,115
But that doesn’t mean you should not attend all the rest!

512
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:41,389
You all should sit down and talk. It helps a lot.

513
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:50,361
And help each other. Ask questions and things openly.

514
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:58,880
And then after that is the dinner and after dinner - what time is the tea?

515
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,990
Gavin: There’s no tea as such, Mother.

516
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,590


517
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:04,829
But the only fixed time is seven o’clock for the barbecue dinner

518
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,765
and then the dancing will be about half past eight.

519
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,709
Shri Mataji: Alright.
And the tea is at what time?

520
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:13,582
Gavin: I think we can have it about four but there’s nothing written down.

521
00:41:13,782 --> 00:41:17,950
Shri Mataji: Five o’clock? Five o’clock. Say, four thirty five.

522
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,069
Finish it by five, say.

523
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:25,950
And let’s start at five thirty, to six or seven.

524
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,721
Then we’ll have a barbecue dinner.

525
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:33,310
And after the barbecue dinner, we’ll have the music program. Alright?

526
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:40,635
Then tomorrow you can have dhyana, meditation, in the morning

527
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:47,941
and about, say, you must get up early.

528
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:50,023


529
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:55,050
And after that you can get your tea, I don’t know,

530
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:58,110
whenever you feel like. I don’t know what the style is.

531
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:02,216
And after the dhyana is over,

532
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:08,750
then you can come for your breakfast or whatever it is.

533
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:14,189
And then you have again a little seminar sort of a thing.

534
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,816
This is at twelve [that] you go for is it.

535
00:42:19,017 --> 00:42:23,371
Gavin: Well tomorrow there’s no staff here. We make our own lunch arrangements.

536
00:42:23,572 --> 00:42:27,422
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Then it’s alright. Then there’s no problem.

537
00:42:27,623 --> 00:42:29,707
Tomorrow is the puja day,

538
00:42:29,907 --> 00:42:33,550
so you need not have a seminar or anything, anything like that.

539
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:40,605
We can start our puja say, say…

540
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:49,150
Should be at ten, about.

541
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,510
And have a food after puja.

542
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:57,523
That’s how we are: after that, after that, after that.

543
00:42:57,724 --> 00:43:00,270
Alright?

544
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:05,790
May God bless you.

545
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,230
So can I retire now in my room?

546
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,556
Thank you very much.

547
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:20,667


548
00:43:26,623 --> 00:43:28,623


549
00:43:32,437 --> 00:43:35,477


550
00:43:39,457 --> 00:43:44,110


551
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,490


552
00:43:54,163 --> 00:43:57,437


553
00:43:57,637 --> 00:44:00,967


554
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:03,750


555
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,633


556
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:11,919


557
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,033


558
00:44:15,233 --> 00:44:18,633


559
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:21,300


560
