00:00:04.127 --> 00:00:06.562
Today we are talking about

00:00:06.732 --> 00:00:11.993
the sixth chakra called as Agya Chakra.

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:32.310
The ‘gya’, ‘gya’ word means ‘to know’, gya is to know.

00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:35.096
And ‘A’ means ‘the whole’.

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:40.554
Agya chakra also has another meaning.

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:45.905
A-gya,  agya means ‘obedience’ or ‘to order’.

00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:51.616
It can mean both the things. If you order to someone

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.297
it is an agya and the one who obeys the order is an agyakari.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.200
The one who does the agya.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:12.789
This sixth chakra was created in the human beings

00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:15.714
when he started thinking.

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:28.859
Thinking is language expressed.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.538
If we do not have a language we cannot think.

00:01:38.204 --> 00:01:42.230
But it does not mean there is no thought coming into us.

00:01:42.704 --> 00:01:46.037
If we cannot express it,

00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:50.128
it does not mean there is no thought process working in us.

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:55.094
But at that subtle stage when the thoughts are coming to us

00:01:56.058 --> 00:01:59.998
they are not in language,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.080
so they are not communicated to us,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.810
and that’s why if we do not have language

00:02:08.647 --> 00:02:12.377
we cannot understand what we are thinking.

00:02:16.627 --> 00:02:20.894
That’s why you must have seen children cannot communicate to us

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:25.240
what they want because they cannot say what they are wanting.

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:28.604
They feel the urge in the stomach

00:02:30.044 --> 00:02:33.989
and they want to ask for, say, water or something,

00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:36.699
but they can’t say it to us,

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:42.161
and that’s why they cannot think what they have to say about.

00:02:45.988 --> 00:02:49.639
But afterwards when you start thinking

00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:53.431
and putting it into language,

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:58.200
that language is stored in our brain as shown in the picture

00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:01.971
on the left hand side and also on the right hand side

00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:07.208
of that yellow and black, then it comes back to us,

00:03:07.384 --> 00:03:12.627
later on as, thought waves. As if somebody is talking to us.

00:03:14.372 --> 00:03:17.131
But before the language starts,

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:20.763
we can call it the inspiration

00:03:21.736 --> 00:03:24.649
or the thought process, at the very early stage,

00:03:24.854 --> 00:03:28.731
comes to us in certain forms,

00:03:29.707 --> 00:03:33.325
and those forms are in light and shade.

00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:38.062
They are not in language but in light and shade.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.501
And after coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.356
if you go deep into your thoughts

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.508
you’ll find they are nothing but lights and shade

00:03:46.611 --> 00:03:49.740
that are covering our Agya chakra.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:03.396
One after another a light and shade, like a circular lighthouse,

00:04:03.804 --> 00:04:07.681
they give a kind of a pattern in our head.

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:13.338
Now these patterns are moulded into language

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.005
by us at a very early stage

00:04:16.368 --> 00:04:20.857
and these are sort of filled into the cups of language

00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:24.735
and then these cups are kept reserved in the brain

00:04:24.838 --> 00:04:27.262
and they come to us that way.

00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:32.010
When we think we really understand

00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:34.835
because it’s a language that comes to us.

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.215
So what happens to the animals? Do they think or not?

00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:44.172
They get a thought, an inspiration

00:04:47.143 --> 00:04:49.943
but they won’t be just thinking about it.

00:04:51.776 --> 00:04:54.564
Now, these inspirations come to them

00:04:54.973 --> 00:04:58.373
as words when they start living with human beings.

00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:04.148
So these inspirations go into the thought again as we do.

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:06.351
For example you give somebody a name,

00:05:06.442 --> 00:05:10.807
say you call him say Tom, or something – you call a dog

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:15.251
– so now he knows that this word means ‘calling me’.

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.269
So he connects himself with that word.

00:05:19.612 --> 00:05:22.012
But when he does not have the word,

00:05:22.685 --> 00:05:24.714
when he’s just an animal,

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.530
he’s just there, he doesn’t think.

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:34.053
That’s why they are very spontaneous and we are not.

00:05:34.882 --> 00:05:39.505
Animals are extremely spontaneous that cause they do not

00:05:40.152 --> 00:05:42.975
think the way we think.

00:05:43.394 --> 00:05:46.941
And this has created the greatest problem for human beings:

00:05:47.054 --> 00:05:49.083
how to get beyond thoughts.

00:05:50.964 --> 00:05:53.116
It’s a little complicated thing because

00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:55.708
perhaps I can see that very clearly,

00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:58.049
as you cannot see the light.

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.632
And then the light forms the language,

00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:07.063
and then language, according to us, becomes our thoughts.

00:06:07.891 --> 00:06:11.322
But these thoughts are really conditionings on us

00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:13.692
and they are not inspired things.

00:06:13.942 --> 00:06:16.075
They are not coming from inside

00:06:16.187 --> 00:06:18.720
and that’s why we are not spontaneous.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.234
For example if I am sitting here,

00:06:23.472 --> 00:06:26.272
now I cannot keep quiet as a human being.

00:06:26.528 --> 00:06:28.794
I’ll be thinking about something.

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.170
I’ll be thinking, “What am I going to say?”

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:32.869
Then “Should I say this or not?”

00:06:33.048 --> 00:06:35.230
“What if I say this, will that be alright or not?”

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.035
“Will that go to their heads or not?”

00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:39.575
All sorts of thoughts will be coming into My head.

00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:42.571
Then from one side I will be questioning myself.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.714
From the other side the answers will be coming,

00:06:44.834 --> 00:06:47.524
“Alright you say this and if you say like this

00:06:47.663 --> 00:06:51.154
they may appreciate you Go this way that way they will understand.”

00:06:51.324 --> 00:06:53.754
Like that you see. So the sorting out goes on

00:06:53.933 --> 00:06:58.734
in our brain through our experiences of this lifetime of ours.

00:07:00.322 --> 00:07:03.788
Whatever have been our experiences in this lifetime

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.710
in dealing with people in getting experiences from others:

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.033
all these are conditioned into our brain

00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:13.326
and the whole thing becomes a thought process,

00:07:13.605 --> 00:07:20.628
which comes to us through this interaction of thought

00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:24.239
and action, action and thought, which just starts waves

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:26.680
– which action to take, what thought to be put in,

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:30.619
how to solve it and we think we are analysing ourselves.

00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:33.033
It’s a very superficial thing.

00:07:34.597 --> 00:07:39.520
Actually you do not analyse anything whatsoever, you do not.

00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:43.633
As I told you the other day you do not do anything.

00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:47.707
So your thinking is nothing but a bubbling going on.

00:07:48.023 --> 00:07:52.943
Because when, like a sea even, which is, so deep down, so quiet

00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:56.812
– when it touches the shore it has a action and reaction.

00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:00.324
In the same way when you are seeing at something,

00:08:00.542 --> 00:08:02.875
because your attention is outside,

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.857
immediately a thought wave is created out of that,

00:08:05.996 --> 00:08:09.379
which goes back and gives you all the images about it,

00:08:09.597 --> 00:08:11.878
whatever you know about that particular thing

00:08:12.018 --> 00:08:14.951
and it comes back to you as thought process.

00:08:16.294 --> 00:08:19.053
It’s going on all the time,

00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:25.521
and it can be so maddening that we cannot stop our thoughts:

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.533
it just goes on like mad.

00:08:27.743 --> 00:08:30.600
You don’t know, you can’t sleep because thoughts are coming.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.597
Sometimes they could be horrifying,

00:08:32.736 --> 00:08:35.367
sometimes they are gratifying, sometimes romantic,

00:08:35.513 --> 00:08:39.910
sometimes absolutely negative, sometimes very positive.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.402
Sometimes you feel “I must do this,”

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.902
sometimes you feel “I shouldn’t do this”.

00:08:45.042 --> 00:08:48.642
But when you [are] actually doing – you do not think.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.500
It’s surprising, we never notice

00:08:52.978 --> 00:08:55.736
that when we are doing that particular thing,

00:08:55.875 --> 00:08:58.930
supposing I say I am going to speak, these things.

00:08:59.109 --> 00:09:02.513
Now when I’ve thought about it that I thought say about 10 minutes

00:09:02.633 --> 00:09:05.529
before when I’m speaking it, I am not thinking that

00:09:05.728 --> 00:09:07.528
what I was going to speak.

00:09:07.869 --> 00:09:12.274
Because that time I think I’ve built in that process of thinking

00:09:12.473 --> 00:09:14.409
into my brain and put it somewhere stored

00:09:14.568 --> 00:09:16.889
and then, now,  when I have started this talk,

00:09:17.048 --> 00:09:18.915
that is coming direct to me.

00:09:21.731 --> 00:09:25.579
So human beings have developed, I should say a process,

00:09:25.818 --> 00:09:30.937
which can be a very sickening thing, very, very sickening.

00:09:31.215 --> 00:09:34.042
And this comes out of both of these.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.704
Is one the left side that we call the ego, which has gone this side

00:09:38.903 --> 00:09:41.851
and the right side we call the superego.

00:09:42.506 --> 00:09:47.327
All the conditioning on the right hand side of the superego,

00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:54.470
is, gives us, the fears, the dangers, the possibilities.

00:09:54.749 --> 00:09:57.215
Whatever we have experienced before.

00:09:57.626 --> 00:10:01.787
As they say those who have been burnt by

00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:08.328
milk also [will] take a cold drink after blowing it a little.

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:11.314
Because you have been burnt you know

00:10:11.495 --> 00:10:14.371
something liquid has burnt you so you think this may also

00:10:14.558 --> 00:10:17.360
burn your tongue. So you may try to do that.

00:10:17.499 --> 00:10:20.899
It is so spontaneous that time that you feel that,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.284
“Oh it is very spontaneous”, but it is not.
It has been stored before

00:10:24.422 --> 00:10:27.280
in your experiences and something there

00:10:27.459 --> 00:10:30.524
that you are afraid of and that’s why you do it.

00:10:30.782 --> 00:10:34.474
If we, once, realise that this thought process is

00:10:34.614 --> 00:10:42.272
absolutely not necessary for us to exist.

00:10:42.761 --> 00:10:46.284
There is no need to have any thought

00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:52.939
about the future or about
the past if you want to exist as human beings.

00:10:53.126 --> 00:10:55.141
Animals do not bother.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:59.982
For example animals know that they are going in a jungle.

00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:03.394
Now suddenly they find some other animal coming from there

00:11:03.565 --> 00:11:05.351
and they know that you go there.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.310
Now what’s the use of thinking
about the animal that is going to come?

00:11:10.498 --> 00:11:13.228
Supposing it does not come then it’s such a waste.

00:11:13.387 --> 00:11:17.187
But they have a hole here and they no problem as we have

00:11:17.356 --> 00:11:19.371
because have a hole the whole thing goes out.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.434
It doesn’t stick for more than a minute here.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.133
But you can condition them also.

00:11:24.312 --> 00:11:26.779
By experiences they are conditioned.

00:11:27.288 --> 00:11:29.482
By experiences that they have had so far,

00:11:29.661 --> 00:11:32.180
about other animals and things, they are conditioned.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.006
And they act accordingly.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.776
So there’s a tremendous difference between us

00:11:37.935 --> 00:11:40.868
and them is that we think about everything.

00:11:41.129 --> 00:11:46.063
I mean, we think it is a very great
thing to sit down and think about it.

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:50.585
And we think it is very wise to sit down and think about it.

00:11:50.804 --> 00:11:55.671
Any problem comes in you think,
“Better sit down and think about it.”

00:11:56.637 --> 00:11:59.704
But now what do we do when a problem arrives?

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.815
We think about it

00:12:01.995 --> 00:12:06.232
in relation to whatever we have been doing before

00:12:06.352 --> 00:12:09.018
and whatever our experiences have been.

00:12:09.844 --> 00:12:13.911
In the same way they want to think about Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:14.506 --> 00:12:17.720
Now you cannot think about Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:17.999 --> 00:12:21.728
First of all you become thoughtlessly aware
in Sahaja Yoga to begin with.

00:12:21.947 --> 00:12:23.685
You cannot think.

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:27.410
But it is a happening about which you cannot think.

00:12:27.574 --> 00:12:31.700
It is a living happening, thinking is a dead movement,

00:12:32.058 --> 00:12:33.991
it is not a living movement.

00:12:37.137 --> 00:12:41.919
Whatever [is] dead in us comes back to us as thought.

00:12:43.246 --> 00:12:47.273
Inspiration is living, not the thinking.

00:12:48.524 --> 00:12:54.111
Inspiration is very different from the thought.

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:58.559
For example, books are in the library,

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.777
everything that we have thought of or

00:13:01.916 --> 00:13:05.316
have got it or experienced – this is in the books.

00:13:05.746 --> 00:13:09.012
Whatever is new coming to us is the inspiration.

00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:18.126
Now just find out how many new things you are thinking,

00:13:19.773 --> 00:13:22.327
perhaps not even a sentence.

00:13:22.586 --> 00:13:26.164
Mostly you say that “This gentleman said so,”

00:13:26.318 --> 00:13:28.842
“That gentleman said so,” “That gentleman said so”,

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:31.990
or “I said so”.

00:13:34.292 --> 00:13:39.708
If you can think about that is coming just now into you,

00:13:39.847 --> 00:13:43.247
you don’t have to think for it, it just comes out,

00:13:45.581 --> 00:13:51.394
it is inside you, it just emerges and expresses itself.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.033
So that is the spontaneous living thing.

00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:57.798
That is what we call as inspiration:

00:13:58.069 --> 00:14:01.402
is a sudden glimpse of the knowledge that we get.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.797
But whatever we have [been] thinking about

00:14:04.956 --> 00:14:07.654
is all the play of the dead.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.074
So this is a centre of Christ.

00:14:16.551 --> 00:14:20.221
He resides in the centre of Agya,

00:14:22.801 --> 00:14:27.815
and He is, in the Devi Purana if you read,

00:14:27.994 --> 00:14:32.096
was born long, long time before, was created much earlier

00:14:32.359 --> 00:14:36.706
and how He developed into Mahavishnu
also you can read it for yourself

00:14:36.893 --> 00:14:39.206
because it’s a big chapter and I wish

00:14:39.385 --> 00:14:42.262
you all could know and read about it and find out

00:14:42.441 --> 00:14:45.139
how He developed into Mahavishnu.

00:14:45.337 --> 00:14:46.937
It is very interesting.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.500
Because all these things were written in Sanskrit language,

00:14:51.765 --> 00:14:58.889
we should not say that Mahavishnu was not in the Bible,

00:14:59.052 --> 00:15:02.276
because Bible itself was not written at a stretch by one person.

00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:08.249
So that part is a part of Christ’s creation before He came

00:15:08.448 --> 00:15:11.384
on this Earth as Christ.

00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:16.323
Actually Christians do not know anything about His becoming:

00:15:16.543 --> 00:15:22.475
how He became Christ or what was the need to have Christ

00:15:22.654 --> 00:15:26.850
or a son to come down [and] why not God Himself could do the job.

00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:29.640
And this is the reason why I would request you

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:35.691
to read for yourself the incarnation of Mahavishnu

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.604
by which you realise why Christ was born.

00:15:40.235 --> 00:15:44.878
And it is the most important incarnation

00:15:45.394 --> 00:15:50.810
because He is the principle,

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:54.833
He is the principle of creation,

00:15:55.608 --> 00:15:59.870
the tattwa, as they call it in Sanskrit language, He is the tattwa.

00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:06.358
Ganesha, though resides in the Mooladhara gradually evolves

00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:10.108
to be Christ at this stage.

00:16:10.446 --> 00:16:16.596
From that red chakra up to this chakra He becomes Christ.

00:16:18.303 --> 00:16:20.544
He is the principle.

00:16:20.882 --> 00:16:23.997
Now what is the principle?

00:16:26.636 --> 00:16:29.269
Within us what is our principle?

00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:32.067
Is, say, the Kundalini you can say.

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:36.848
In this (microphone) the electricity is
the principle of this one is.

00:16:37.087 --> 00:16:39.087
In the same way the creation,

00:16:40.102 --> 00:16:42.969
the whole creation if you take it as such,

00:16:43.119 --> 00:16:48.396
it is the principle and the support of this creation.

00:16:50.579 --> 00:17:01.342
He represents the essence, the essence of creation.

00:17:02.183 --> 00:17:05.258
Like we can say we have a family,

00:17:05.437 --> 00:17:08.333
husband and wife and the child.

00:17:08.711 --> 00:17:13.393
Now the child is the essence of husband and wife,

00:17:14.981 --> 00:17:19.008
he’s the essence of the family, of the house.

00:17:19.346 --> 00:17:25.146
The whole thing is sustained for him, is created for him.

00:17:25.402 --> 00:17:31.969
Till they did not have the child there was no meaning to that house

00:17:32.188 --> 00:17:33.921
no meaning to their life.

00:17:34.113 --> 00:17:38.378
But when they had a child then they had a meaning. In the same way,

00:17:38.556 --> 00:17:42.009
Christ is the essence, is the tattwa itself.

00:17:42.287 --> 00:17:47.505
He’s the Omkara as they call it. He is the first sound,

00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:50.781
first sound that was created – Om –

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.662
when the Primordial Father and Primordial Mother separated,

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:57.388
They created this sound.

00:17:57.548 --> 00:18:03.023
And He is that sound which is filled into All-Pervading Power

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:07.765
and looks after and supports.

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:12.281
Actually it is more the support
because looking after is done by the Father

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.888
you can say or by the Mother.

00:18:13.988 --> 00:18:17.976
But is the support of all the Universe.

00:18:21.805 --> 00:18:26.408
And because He is just the essence, the essence never dies.

00:18:28.532 --> 00:18:33.670
Say My essence is My Spirit, it will never die.

00:18:34.893 --> 00:18:40.263
The body dies or the creation will die
but the essence has to be there.

00:18:40.581 --> 00:18:43.795
If the essence is lost then nothing could be there.

00:18:43.934 --> 00:18:47.466
That’s why He’s the most important incarnation,

00:18:47.704 --> 00:18:50.025
because He is the support.

00:18:51.466 --> 00:18:56.882
Now this incarnation is placed in this Agya chakra of ours,

00:18:57.538 --> 00:19:02.339
here in the centre, where the optic nerve or optic thalamus cross

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:06.463
each other like this. In the centre is a very subtle point

00:19:07.232 --> 00:19:10.632
which moves both the sides like this and like that

00:19:10.903 --> 00:19:16.303
and it creates two sounds
‘hum’  ‘kshum’,  ‘hum’   ‘kshum’,  ‘hum’   ‘kshum’.

00:19:18.462 --> 00:19:22.708
‘Hum’ is on the right hand side where you have seen

00:19:23.613 --> 00:19:26.132
the superego is there

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:31.232
and  ‘kshum’  is on the left hand side where the ego is.

00:19:31.807 --> 00:19:39.089
Now these two sounds create two kinds of vibrations.

00:19:39.605 --> 00:19:46.863
The ‘hum’ sound creates the vibrations,

00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:50.950
which make you think, “I am, I am”

00:19:51.843 --> 00:19:53.410
‘hum’, ‘I am.’

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:56.283
This comes from our existence power

00:19:56.481 --> 00:19:59.028
that we know we have to live in this world,

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.882
we’re not going to die.

00:20:01.041 --> 00:20:04.708
Any human being who tries to kill himself is abnormal.

00:20:05.347 --> 00:20:08.084
Normally every human being…

00:20:08.255 --> 00:20:14.465
why every animal or any living thing tries to retain its life?

00:20:14.704 --> 00:20:19.021
That is through this power of ‘hum’,  that – ‘I am’.

00:20:19.299 --> 00:20:21.580
Now the superego on the left hand side

00:20:21.739 --> 00:20:24.473
and ego on the right hand side is kshum’.

00:20:25.521 --> 00:20:29.521
But now I’ll tell you about the right hand side – superego.

00:20:30.779 --> 00:20:39.826
In this superego when you are conditioned by so many things,

00:20:40.374 --> 00:20:44.005
then you are frightened and you are worried

00:20:44.434 --> 00:20:48.473
because these experiences make you that

00:20:48.652 --> 00:20:52.045
type of a person which has fear in the mind.

00:20:52.569 --> 00:20:55.933
And this fear is all settled in your superego.

00:20:56.152 --> 00:20:59.068
This starts from your amoeba stage you can say

00:20:59.247 --> 00:21:01.648
and is, still today, is being stored there.

00:21:01.787 --> 00:21:05.499
You are afraid of police,
you are afraid of that, you are afraid of this.

00:21:05.688 --> 00:21:09.348
Some people are not afraid of
these things but are afraid of something else,

00:21:09.507 --> 00:21:12.441
because whatever have been your conditions,

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:18.851
whatever have been your experiences, are all put down here.

00:21:19.062 --> 00:21:22.038
Moreover when somebody reads the book of Dracula

00:21:22.208 --> 00:21:23.823
now he’s afraid of the word Dracula

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:25.757
but the children who do not read

00:21:25.896 --> 00:21:27.594
they do not know what is a Dracula is.

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.531
If you say Dracula has come they say,

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.837
“Alright, lets have a look at him!”

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:34.332
But those children [who] have read about Dracula,

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.685
they are literally frightened and they say, “Oh God,

00:21:36.843 --> 00:21:39.454
Dracula is coming, something terrible is going to happen!”

00:21:39.593 --> 00:21:43.223
So, whatever you have read, whatever you have gone through

00:21:43.383 --> 00:21:48.025
whatever experiences you have had – all is in the superego.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:56.477
So this superego in that, this centre, sends [this] message,

00:21:56.716 --> 00:22:01.180
“I am, you are, you are”, ‘hum’,  ‘hum’ : “don’t be afraid,

00:22:01.418 --> 00:22:03.285
don’t be afraid”, “you are”.

00:22:03.998 --> 00:22:07.631
So the people who come to Me, and you have seen some people

00:22:07.848 --> 00:22:12.550
who come to Me are victims of superego conditioning.

00:22:13.126 --> 00:22:14.792
And these are the people…

00:22:14.946 --> 00:22:18.046
actually at this stage only, you can really discriminate

00:22:18.225 --> 00:22:19.495
between the two types:

00:22:19.694 --> 00:22:23.664
one who are very aggressive, the other who are absolutely

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:30.172
we should say subordinated, frightened.

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:33.442
These people when they come to Me,

00:22:33.671 --> 00:22:35.763
I have seen, they go on crying and weeping,

00:22:35.903 --> 00:22:39.355
“Mother you know this has happened that has happened,”

00:22:39.514 --> 00:22:42.034
and I really get tired talking to them.

00:22:42.232 --> 00:22:46.569
And there are so many of this kind that

00:22:46.768 --> 00:22:49.605
really you have to pay attention to them as sahaja yogis

00:22:49.744 --> 00:22:51.661
because you’ll have to deal with them,

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.667
how to manage them and how to work it out.

00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:57.542
Now at that time if a sahaja yogi says,

00:22:57.693 --> 00:23:01.700
now you go on saying ‘hum’, ‘hum’, ‘hum’, ‘hum’,

00:23:01.998 --> 00:23:07.176
a sahaja yogi, if he says [that],
then the vibrations will drive out his fear.

00:23:07.415 --> 00:23:09.736
Even if you are under any fear

00:23:09.934 --> 00:23:13.366
and you are walking around and you feel that there’s frightened,

00:23:13.545 --> 00:23:15.811
you just say ‘hum’, ‘hum’, ‘hum’.

00:23:15.989 --> 00:23:19.770
Now with this saying the vibrations will clear out

00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:22.308
this side very nicely.

00:23:22.489 --> 00:23:23.936
Apart from that,

00:23:24.116 --> 00:23:28.897
that is the way you can get help from the Divine by saying ‘hum’.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.816
Now there are many things about
hum and kshum but as the time is you know,

00:23:33.985 --> 00:23:36.933
so I do not want to go into great details about it.

00:23:37.092 --> 00:23:41.092
But I would say the mantra for the right hand side is ‘hum’

00:23:41.933 --> 00:23:44.533
and for the left hand side is ‘kshum’.

00:23:46.055 --> 00:23:48.188
The right hand side is the ego,

00:23:48.496 --> 00:23:51.429
which is real problem, you understand that!

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.856
Is a real colossal one you have to face them, I mean,

00:23:56.051 --> 00:23:58.642
[if] I say anything small here and there

00:23:58.802 --> 00:24:02.115
I find the whole thing coming up onto my head like that.

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:05.865
So what is the solution for a colossal ego?

00:24:06.242 --> 00:24:13.623
Colossal ego can only be conquered by forgiving others.

00:24:14.882 --> 00:24:18.949
Those who have ego must learn,

00:24:19.228 --> 00:24:22.161
if they feel hurt they must say, “forgive.”

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.880
Then another person hurts them, say, “forgive.”

00:24:26.212 --> 00:24:29.743
And not only forgive but ask for forgiveness.

00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:33.901
Both things should be done, more asking for forgiveness.

00:24:34.089 --> 00:24:37.878
You have to ask for forgiveness if you have too much of ego.

00:24:38.077 --> 00:24:41.564
It is very important. Because if you have too much of ego

00:24:41.782 --> 00:24:44.982
means what? That you have pampered it too much.

00:24:45.432 --> 00:24:47.965
That means you have used it too much.

00:24:48.241 --> 00:24:50.224
You have dominated people

00:24:50.437 --> 00:24:53.303
and that’s why you have such a lot of ego.

00:24:53.519 --> 00:24:55.364
If you have such a lot of ego

00:24:55.543 --> 00:24:59.210
you must all the time try to humble down in your heart.

00:24:59.642 --> 00:25:03.205
Now in the heart resides the Spirit.

00:25:03.722 --> 00:25:06.736
The ego, too much of ego in a person,

00:25:06.936 --> 00:25:09.603
always takes you away from that Spirit.

00:25:09.853 --> 00:25:13.027
That’s why it is said, “Humble down in your heart.”

00:25:13.226 --> 00:25:17.412
The reason is, in the heart resides that part of yours

00:25:17.631 --> 00:25:21.936
which gets completely obliterated or forgotten

00:25:22.115 --> 00:25:25.916
once you start pumping up your ego.

00:25:26.194 --> 00:25:31.888
But ego has its limits, it ends up into stupidity and foolishness.

00:25:32.821 --> 00:25:35.355
You take any person who is egoistical

00:25:36.492 --> 00:25:38.825
and who’s blowing his own trumpet,

00:25:39.065 --> 00:25:42.465
you will immediately know because he’ll be stupid,

00:25:43.535 --> 00:25:46.135
without understanding what he’s doing,

00:25:46.404 --> 00:25:48.671
he’ll be doing such stupid things

00:25:48.884 --> 00:25:51.522
that you will start wondering, especially children,

00:25:51.702 --> 00:25:55.502
“What’s the matter with this fellow? Seems quite funny!”

00:25:56.622 --> 00:25:59.618
And then the stupidity faces the person

00:25:59.837 --> 00:26:05.481
– then he sees for himself, “Oh God! how did I become so stupid?”

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.656
But stupidity comes to you

00:26:07.782 --> 00:26:10.659
because you forget the existence of God

00:26:10.774 --> 00:26:13.307
and your relationship with the Whole.

00:26:15.434 --> 00:26:17.301
You think, “I am on my own.

00:26:17.622 --> 00:26:19.355
Why should I not do this?

00:26:19.777 --> 00:26:21.310
What is wrong in this,

00:26:21.511 --> 00:26:23.045
what is wrong in that?

00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:25.022
I should do these things.”

00:26:25.117 --> 00:26:28.250
I mean in this country the way people are fighting for things,

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:31.359
I mean, you must, anybody, I mean, those so-called

00:26:31.472 --> 00:26:33.989
developing countries can’t understand:

00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:37.194
what’s this kind of a thing happening to these people?

00:26:37.294 --> 00:26:43.226
Because the other day My son-in-law Luv was reading an article

00:26:43.328 --> 00:26:46.106
that people are demanding now that a son-in-law

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.385
should be allowed to marry the mother-in-law

00:26:49.564 --> 00:26:52.225
and he just couldn’t understand how can people gather together

00:26:52.362 --> 00:26:54.946
and ask for such an absurd thing like that.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.064
She is your mother. How can you say that way?

00:26:58.189 --> 00:27:00.862
I mean it is something an impossibility

00:27:00.976 --> 00:27:04.043
for people, normal people to think like that,

00:27:04.128 --> 00:27:06.769
that a son-in-law can marry the mother-in-law.

00:27:06.849 --> 00:27:09.876
And what is there to make a law about it and to talk about it.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.857
It’s a very difficult thing.

00:27:11.985 --> 00:27:15.284
All kinds of stupid things we are doing in this country,

00:27:15.414 --> 00:27:18.681
which really makes everybody roar with laughter.

00:27:19.865 --> 00:27:24.388
Is because of our Mr. Ego companionship.

00:27:25.341 --> 00:27:28.541
It is not easy to understand how he befools us.

00:27:29.216 --> 00:27:32.047
It goes on befooling us all the time

00:27:32.205 --> 00:27:34.211
and then we think “what’s wrong?”

00:27:34.337 --> 00:27:35.870
An eighty-year-old man

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.704
running after a twenty-year-old girl.

00:27:38.784 --> 00:27:42.400
And the twenty-year-old girl befooling this eighty-year-old man,

00:27:42.752 --> 00:27:45.393
supposed to be a statesman this, that

00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:48.431
and his statue is erected somewhere there.

00:27:48.763 --> 00:27:50.096
How is it possible?

00:27:52.765 --> 00:27:55.234
It is only the ego makes you do

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.851
all these nonsensical and stupid things.

00:27:59.021 --> 00:28:00.954
Once you are in Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:01.073 --> 00:28:04.374
you don’t know how to control your laughter sometimes,

00:28:04.485 --> 00:28:07.457
the way people are foolish, extremely foolish.

00:28:07.594 --> 00:28:12.399
And this is what it is; it ends up in stupidity absolute stupidity.

00:28:12.627 --> 00:28:15.361
I mean even if you want to write

00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:18.719
a novel you won’t get such beautiful characters

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.315
as you could around you,

00:28:20.418 --> 00:28:22.220
when you listen to them. And you’re shocked,

00:28:22.345 --> 00:28:23.820
“Oh God what’s this going on!”

00:28:23.946 --> 00:28:27.718
And very embarrassing too, extremely embarrassing.

00:28:27.854 --> 00:28:34.044
And they become so foolish with their ego

00:28:35.655 --> 00:28:40.613
that one cannot understand how thinking man,

00:28:40.761 --> 00:28:44.922
because by thinking you get your ego, becomes foolish.

00:28:46.464 --> 00:28:48.618
There is no wisdom

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:53.030
in a person whose ego is completely developed like that.

00:28:53.346 --> 00:28:57.346
If somebody has an ego like that there is no wisdom in him.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.914
You can see that he does not know what is wisdom.

00:29:01.639 --> 00:29:04.039
He behaves in such an immature way.

00:29:04.258 --> 00:29:06.287
He may be an elderly man,

00:29:06.424 --> 00:29:08.394
great grandfather of somebody but

00:29:08.507 --> 00:29:11.398
as soon as he opens his mouth you are shocked at him.

00:29:11.512 --> 00:29:14.312
You think from where this joker has come?

00:29:14.822 --> 00:29:17.316
The maturity is completely lacking.

00:29:17.452 --> 00:29:19.743
The other day somebody told Me that,

00:29:19.857 --> 00:29:22.938
“Mother how is it our parents are so stupid

00:29:23.063 --> 00:29:24.730
and we are searching God?

00:29:26.385 --> 00:29:30.848
And the elderly people are so foolish and we are searching God?”

00:29:31.061 --> 00:29:32.160
And then I said,

00:29:32.285 --> 00:29:34.951
“No, maybe because of war the parents are disturbed.

00:29:35.077 --> 00:29:37.421
Most of the parents were disturbed during war”

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:40.653
and they said, “Majority of them are like this.

00:29:40.778 --> 00:29:44.111
And the younger people are searching God and much wiser

00:29:44.225 --> 00:29:46.218
and we don’t know how to compromise with them

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.417
because they are not searching God.

00:29:48.557 --> 00:29:51.856
Why is it they are not searching God and we are searching God?

00:29:51.969 --> 00:29:55.503
And if there are some searching, they are very few.”

00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:58.171
Now I said this may be due to war but somebody said,

00:29:58.272 --> 00:30:00.288
“Then what about America? You see,

00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:02.941
in America the people didn’t face war so much,”

00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:07.288
the stupidity that they have is sometimes surprising.

00:30:09.386 --> 00:30:11.925
That is the same thing as I said,

00:30:12.107 --> 00:30:15.474
is the development of ego in a human being.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.459
Now ego is the thing that makes you think about everything.

00:30:21.925 --> 00:30:27.786
For example, now we have to say go from here to Birmingham alright.

00:30:28.104 --> 00:30:30.370
So we think now, “how will I go?”

00:30:31.448 --> 00:30:36.048
Simple way is that I’ll take a train or I’ll take a car and go away

00:30:36.208 --> 00:30:39.268
If there’s no reservation needed I will just jump into the train

00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:42.443
or go by the car. If the car is available I’ll go by car

00:30:42.546 --> 00:30:46.013
or by train finished! What is there to think about?

00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:49.783
But “No! Then we must plan it out, I have programmed! Now,

00:30:50.012 --> 00:30:51.078
I have to go!”

00:30:51.655 --> 00:30:54.721
You go to the station and find the train is not there

00:30:54.822 --> 00:30:58.070
because there was some accident so the train is not moving.

00:30:58.183 --> 00:31:00.253
So you’re absolutely upset

00:31:00.367 --> 00:31:03.802
because you think that “The train has gone now what to do.?”

00:31:03.926 --> 00:31:06.331
In that upsetting you do not even remember that

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.403
you have a car and you have to go by the car now.

00:31:09.528 --> 00:31:11.954
That whole thing upsets you

00:31:12.034 --> 00:31:14.501
because you had plans to go by train

00:31:14.604 --> 00:31:17.676
and you had planned everything, now you cannot reach there

00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:19.399
and what will happen?

00:31:19.615 --> 00:31:22.815
Now you are sitting here and worrying about it.

00:31:23.025 --> 00:31:26.225
As a person who is spontaneous what will he do?

00:31:26.344 --> 00:31:29.280
“Alright depends on, I may go by train or by car

00:31:29.406 --> 00:31:31.730
whatever I feel like at that time.”

00:31:31.833 --> 00:31:33.166
He’s sitting tight.

00:31:33.363 --> 00:31:35.030
So he goes to the train,

00:31:35.162 --> 00:31:36.818
sees if the train is there.

00:31:36.921 --> 00:31:41.592
If it is, nicely there’s a space available, he gets into it.

00:31:41.796 --> 00:31:43.780
If the train is not available, alright,

00:31:43.894 --> 00:31:46.490
he comes home takes his car and goes away.

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:48.948
So now you have informed the people that

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:51.923
you must meet at such and such a place – that also is there,.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.161
So those people are running up, down there

00:31:54.252 --> 00:31:56.727
– and they will be there at the station.

00:31:56.818 --> 00:31:58.258
Now what’s the matter?

00:31:58.338 --> 00:32:00.968
Even if they’re at the station you can meet them at the station.

00:32:01.104 --> 00:32:02.986
You go by train and you can meet them.

00:32:03.066 --> 00:32:05.599
What is there to be that much upset about it?

00:32:05.724 --> 00:32:07.923
You see you can always contact them.

00:32:08.049 --> 00:32:10.078
But the way we get upset

00:32:10.299 --> 00:32:12.664
we have spoiled the complete program

00:32:12.756 --> 00:32:14.195
of going to Birmingham,

00:32:14.275 --> 00:32:18.104
which is a very beautiful program that we have got.

00:32:18.217 --> 00:32:20.473
We have to meet new people, we have to meet many people,

00:32:20.542 --> 00:32:22.202
we have to enjoy ourselves.

00:32:22.305 --> 00:32:23.705
That’s all finished!

00:32:23.926 --> 00:32:26.998
Because we had planned something and it did not work out,

00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:28.167
we are finished!

00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:33.504
All these things make us a miserable person.

00:32:34.207 --> 00:32:38.209
And we are so miserable and so grudging and so boring

00:32:38.402 --> 00:32:41.908
that those who are next to you just get fed up with it and they say

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:43.439
“Now shut up!

00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:46.995
If you are not going to Birmingham,

00:32:47.316 --> 00:32:51.059
if you are not going don’t go. But don’t eat my head now!”

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:53.302
is a common experience of many.

00:32:54.548 --> 00:32:58.548
It’s this Mr. Ego he’s so, he doesn’t want you to be happy.

00:33:00.941 --> 00:33:03.275
He doesn’t want you to be relaxed.

00:33:03.425 --> 00:33:06.157
He all the time gives you ideas and tells you,

00:33:06.265 --> 00:33:10.295
“Do this and do that and you must get it done
and this is to be done.

00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:12.023
You had better inform that person,

00:33:12.136 --> 00:33:15.567
be meticulous about it,” and it will go to such details

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.127
that anything fails you are finished

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.977
because your nerves are already finished and shattered.

00:33:21.125 --> 00:33:24.322
Anything, even a drop of

00:33:24.474 --> 00:33:26.408
inconvenience comes into you

00:33:26.513 --> 00:33:30.980
or even a feather of disturbance is there, you are finished.

00:33:31.114 --> 00:33:32.963
And so everybody is rattling,

00:33:33.078 --> 00:33:35.878
“We have tensions. We have problems.” Why?

00:33:41.689 --> 00:33:45.827
What is the advantage of doing all these things?

00:33:45.974 --> 00:33:49.024
No advantage you know that. But then why do you do it?

00:33:49.126 --> 00:33:52.860
Because you have a big ego, it won’t allow you to rest.

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:57.480
Whatever you may try it won’t. So what is the solution of that?

00:33:57.616 --> 00:34:01.016
Morning till evening ask for forgiveness from God.

00:34:01.153 --> 00:34:03.259
Pull your ears from both the sides

00:34:03.396 --> 00:34:06.730
and say, “Oh God, forgive me. Oh God, forgive me.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.248
And, oh God forgive me,”

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.140
so this balloon of ego goes down a little.

00:34:12.374 --> 00:34:15.967
Remember Him morning, evening, every time.

00:34:16.705 --> 00:34:20.548
Remembering Christ brings down your ego very much.

00:34:21.622 --> 00:34:24.022
He did everything that was possible

00:34:24.185 --> 00:34:26.645
that you should not develop your ego.

00:34:26.782 --> 00:34:28.782
Everything that was possible.

00:34:28.888 --> 00:34:31.822
He was born as an ordinary carpenter’s son,

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.910
lived in the most ordinary conditions,

00:34:37.991 --> 00:34:42.027
kept Himself behind the whole scene.

00:34:42.254 --> 00:34:45.188
He could have been born as a Roman Emperor.

00:34:46.846 --> 00:34:49.113
He could have been anybody there.

00:34:49.565 --> 00:34:51.798
But no He was born Himself.

00:34:52.037 --> 00:34:54.519
You know that He took his birth

00:34:54.642 --> 00:35:00.685
in a place where even ordinary people do not take their births.

00:35:01.694 --> 00:35:04.161
But, there also the light was there.

00:35:04.676 --> 00:35:07.676
Wherever He was born there was light and joy.

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:10.889
And this is the thing we have to know,

00:35:11.007 --> 00:35:16.456
that we have lost the joy because we have forgotten God Almighty.

00:35:17.555 --> 00:35:19.494
When we forget Him,

00:35:20.095 --> 00:35:26.659
that He is love and He is joy, naturally joy is also forgotten.

00:35:27.112 --> 00:35:30.112
And then we see people are not at all happy;

00:35:30.319 --> 00:35:33.278
they have affluence, they have money, they have everything,

00:35:33.415 --> 00:35:35.340
but still they are not happy.

00:35:35.442 --> 00:35:39.183
All the time they are in such a mess

00:35:39.433 --> 00:35:41.779
that you don’t know how to talk to them.

00:35:41.868 --> 00:35:43.863
If you say this word they’ll be angry,

00:35:43.953 --> 00:35:46.357
if you say that word they’ll be angry.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.999
They are not at all normal human beings,

00:35:49.102 --> 00:35:53.081
they are sick people. Sick with their ego.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.953
Is a very simple thing is to ask for forgiveness,

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.956
but how many times do we do that?

00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:05.866
Not even once a day, not even once a month,

00:36:06.014 --> 00:36:08.043
not even once a year.

00:36:08.903 --> 00:36:11.813
Even on a Christmas day if we could say,

00:36:11.973 --> 00:36:16.020
“Forgive us Oh Lord for whatever we have done so far.”

00:36:16.167 --> 00:36:17.367
It will work out.

00:36:17.483 --> 00:36:21.916
But that day we must champagne to forgive Him more.

00:36:23.241 --> 00:36:25.108
So we must have gossips and

00:36:25.295 --> 00:36:28.343
we must have all the arrogant things

00:36:28.491 --> 00:36:31.824
by the time it is the end of Christmas.

00:36:36.359 --> 00:36:38.988
This ego, yellow side one,

00:36:39.125 --> 00:36:43.614
is the one that presses your superego too much. It does.

00:36:44.158 --> 00:36:46.460
It presses it so much sometimes

00:36:46.684 --> 00:36:52.285
that a person forgets that others are hurt by what they talk.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.980
On the contrary they devise methods

00:36:55.151 --> 00:36:59.039
how to say things which are cutting,

00:37:00.094 --> 00:37:04.323
which are hurting, which are painful to others.

00:37:04.674 --> 00:37:07.921
They say such things, I mean all the time if you see,

00:37:08.023 --> 00:37:10.029
a person say from a village

00:37:10.143 --> 00:37:13.125
if he comes and sees he’ll think, are they quarreling,

00:37:13.216 --> 00:37:15.710
what are they doing? I mean the whole discussion,

00:37:15.835 --> 00:37:18.299
even in the parliament, I was surprised

00:37:18.418 --> 00:37:20.435
the way they talked to each other,

00:37:20.549 --> 00:37:24.936
no bull will treat another bull that way!

00:37:25.875 --> 00:37:30.909
Even a dog normally does not bark at another dog.

00:37:31.224 --> 00:37:36.277
No animal in the world all the time is barking at its fellow man.

00:37:36.413 --> 00:37:39.395
No animal in the whole world I can tell you this much.

00:37:39.508 --> 00:37:40.975
Only the human beings

00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:43.791
if two people are there all the time they are going, “ha ha ha ha”

00:37:43.893 --> 00:37:45.493
all the time, that way.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.143
How is it possible?

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:49.031
His ego and

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:54.031
her ego or maybe both his ego are dashing at each other.

00:37:54.553 --> 00:37:57.890
And there is a kind of a

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.777
funny type of feeling that

00:38:01.891 --> 00:38:04.487
“Oh I have mastered the thing,

00:38:04.633 --> 00:38:06.718
I have got the thing, I have got the point.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.553
I have proved the point!”

00:38:09.055 --> 00:38:12.085
But in that I have lost everything

00:38:12.166 --> 00:38:16.349
that was so beautiful and so much joy giving within me.

00:38:16.678 --> 00:38:21.009
Actually a sensible person would recede from the place

00:38:21.134 --> 00:38:23.801
where two people are having an argument.

00:38:23.905 --> 00:38:27.632
Argument is a sign of tomfoolery.

00:38:29.107 --> 00:38:33.812
I haven’t seen any argument coming to any end whatsoever.

00:38:33.959 --> 00:38:37.493
If it is then it is alright, but it never does come.

00:38:37.923 --> 00:38:43.036
Because, if say, you ask Me questions I answer you, alright.

00:38:43.366 --> 00:38:46.166
If you do not like the answer give it up.

00:38:46.336 --> 00:38:48.318
But if you argue with Me still

00:38:48.455 --> 00:38:51.122
and I argue with you where will you end?

00:38:51.561 --> 00:38:55.575
Argument is not going to lead you to any knowledge

00:38:55.756 --> 00:39:00.450
but a very terrible ego developing into you.

00:39:01.277 --> 00:39:06.311
The whole modern concept is ego-oriented.

00:39:07.206 --> 00:39:10.006
All western countries are ego-orientated.

00:39:10.425 --> 00:39:13.147
They want to develop your ego and pamper it.

00:39:13.249 --> 00:39:15.902
There are so many other ways by which they do.

00:39:16.027 --> 00:39:18.770
Why I’m talking more about it [is] because we are

00:39:18.861 --> 00:39:21.138
all supposed to be western people and affluent people.

00:39:21.223 --> 00:39:24.690
Supposed to be very wise and leading or misleading,

00:39:24.811 --> 00:39:27.099
I don’t know, the developing countries.

00:39:27.236 --> 00:39:29.287
So we have to understand ourselves

00:39:29.396 --> 00:39:33.729
where are we as far as our understanding of things are concerned.

00:39:33.919 --> 00:39:39.528
How ego is pampered within us is by a large-scale methods.

00:39:40.096 --> 00:39:43.767
They work on your ego throughout to have all these

00:39:43.904 --> 00:39:45.661
so-called enterprises.

00:39:45.899 --> 00:39:47.853
For example to a woman they’ll say,

00:39:47.967 --> 00:39:50.847
“Oh you must have a waist like this and you must have

00:39:50.949 --> 00:39:52.559
a face like this and you must have…”

00:39:52.627 --> 00:39:55.826
For a man, “You must this kind of a body.

00:39:55.905 --> 00:39:58.785
You should be Mr. Universe or you should be something,”

00:39:58.899 --> 00:40:01.427
so the man starts working on it, immediately.

00:40:01.552 --> 00:40:04.173
You must. There so many people I have seen running on the roads

00:40:04.264 --> 00:40:06.055
in this cold, I don’t understand.

00:40:06.146 --> 00:40:08.697
Like mad, you know, and some of them are Members of Parliament!

00:40:08.799 --> 00:40:11.842
The whole night they keep awake
and the whole day they are running about. .

00:40:11.979 --> 00:40:15.244
I say – what are you doing? What is the need to do this?

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:17.846
“To keep good health you must do it.”

00:40:18.021 --> 00:40:20.754
To keep good health don’t work like mad,

00:40:20.867 --> 00:40:23.780
be a sensible and a wise person.

00:40:25.311 --> 00:40:28.244
Wisdom is to be sought to keep good health,

00:40:28.562 --> 00:40:33.325
to be alright and not this kind of mad ego-orientated things

00:40:33.541 --> 00:40:39.164
So then, the one way is to excite your ego about your physique.

00:40:39.584 --> 00:40:42.918
Then there is ego about, you must have a big car.

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:46.375
You see, people try to show off their possessions.

00:40:46.501 --> 00:40:48.814
You have a big car, then they’re going about.

00:40:48.928 --> 00:40:52.669
I mean they really look, to Me, like jokers. That’s all they are.

00:40:52.828 --> 00:40:54.948
I mean, car I can understand is a convenience

00:40:55.073 --> 00:40:57.983
and a good quality car, if somebody can afford, should have it,

00:40:58.074 --> 00:41:01.849
because it is a headache to have a bad car. So it’s alright.

00:41:01.975 --> 00:41:04.707
But by having a car you become something great.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.941
You may not have food in the house but you must have

00:41:07.033 --> 00:41:10.891
a very good car to go about. And all these ideas come.

00:41:11.005 --> 00:41:13.102
Then they will advertise

00:41:13.306 --> 00:41:15.415
– “This will be a very good car for you.”

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.407
What is it for you? It is nothing but to pamper your ego.

00:41:19.603 --> 00:41:21.864
All these advertisements are nothing

00:41:21.955 --> 00:41:24.288
but by which your ego is pampered.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.181
All these things they are created.

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:29.139
Now in America, if you go, every handle has to be different,

00:41:29.226 --> 00:41:30.828
every thing has to be different.

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:32.973
Why so much difference in everything?

00:41:33.075 --> 00:41:36.342
Why do you want to have everything so different?

00:41:36.901 --> 00:41:39.701
Is it some aesthetics, you think in that?

00:41:39.963 --> 00:41:44.029
It is none of the aesthetics but is just to pamper your ego.

00:41:44.332 --> 00:41:47.880
Even the so-called art connoisseurs are nothing

00:41:48.017 --> 00:41:49.283
but ego-pamperers.

00:41:49.649 --> 00:41:51.937
Your stamp collections, this, that

00:41:52.028 --> 00:41:54.648
– all this is nothing but ego pampering.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.073
And what a waste of time, you just think about it.

00:41:59.443 --> 00:42:03.250
This ego thing comes into us

00:42:03.398 --> 00:42:08.080
because we are, first of all, as I said, that, in the West,

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:11.650
the living was very difficult, they had to fight the nature.

00:42:11.777 --> 00:42:13.748
And when you have to fight the nature

00:42:13.853 --> 00:42:16.193
you have to develop your ego to fight it.

00:42:16.318 --> 00:42:18.858
Or actually, when you are fighting the nature,

00:42:18.961 --> 00:42:20.894
the ego develops within you.

00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:23.993
And then, once that momentum has started in you,

00:42:24.131 --> 00:42:26.731
it is very difficult to bring it down.

00:42:26.947 --> 00:42:30.178
It is such a terrible disease

00:42:30.326 --> 00:42:33.717
that people have taken it for granted

00:42:33.854 --> 00:42:35.848
that that’s a part of their lives.

00:42:35.952 --> 00:42:39.104
You are not your ego. You are not.

00:42:39.693 --> 00:42:43.093
When I say that you must surrender yourself to God

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.733
they say  “Mother why should we surrender?”

00:42:45.837 --> 00:42:49.181
‘Yourself’ means that ego with which you are identified.

00:42:49.295 --> 00:42:53.500
I don’t say that you surrender your wisdom.

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:57.438
Or I can say: surrender your ego to your wisdom.

00:42:58.994 --> 00:43:01.527
But it is so difficult to give it up,

00:43:01.603 --> 00:43:04.879
because we have learnt to live with it, identified with it.

00:43:05.015 --> 00:43:09.913
We just cannot think of life without our ego, we just cannot.

00:43:10.956 --> 00:43:13.527
And it is gone to such an extent

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:19.083
that we don’t even realise how far we have gone in cruelty.

00:43:19.886 --> 00:43:23.198
Like, “I like this kind, I like that kind.”

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.669
You go to somebody’s house and you say like this:

00:43:25.802 --> 00:43:27.869
is indecent to talk like that.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:35.662
It is vulgar to express, “I like…” Who are you?

00:43:36.115 --> 00:43:37.544
Are you God?

00:43:38.871 --> 00:43:43.211
“I want this. I want that. I am very particular about this.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.104
I am very…”  Who are you?

00:43:47.305 --> 00:43:53.636
Just ask yourself a question, “Who am I? I am the Spirit.

00:43:54.419 --> 00:43:56.822
I am that eternal being.

00:43:57.286 --> 00:43:59.100
Have I become that?”

00:44:01.185 --> 00:44:05.319
On the contrary we are hurting everybody’s Spirit by our ego.

00:44:06.537 --> 00:44:11.196
Every moment, when we talk to others, we are hurting them.

00:44:11.483 --> 00:44:14.150
Actually people have lost faith in God,

00:44:15.145 --> 00:44:19.045
because those who are in charge of God are so arrogant

00:44:19.439 --> 00:44:22.376
and so egoistical

00:44:22.658 --> 00:44:26.163
that it has become impossible for anybody to think of God,

00:44:26.277 --> 00:44:29.643
which is beyond your ego.

00:44:30.572 --> 00:44:35.735
You’ll be surprised, ego is absolutely superficial like a bubble.

00:44:35.928 --> 00:44:39.862
It is just like a balloon, which can burst just like that!

00:44:40.792 --> 00:44:41.992
And it should go.

00:44:43.432 --> 00:44:46.492
It should go so that you should rise.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:53.170
It should disappear so that your attention rises in your Spirit

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:57.000
and that you see the whole world as a part

00:44:57.364 --> 00:45:00.254
of that Spirit that you are.

00:45:00.822 --> 00:45:03.745
This is the boundary, which you have to cross

00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:06.892
and for that we have to take help from Christ.

00:45:07.975 --> 00:45:14.026
Christ crucified himself. Why? Because what did He do?

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:16.743
Did He loot people?

00:45:16.896 --> 00:45:18.741
Today you have thousands of these

00:45:18.901 --> 00:45:21.293
thugs coming here and looting you:

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:24.834
nobody crucifies them. What did He do?

00:45:26.537 --> 00:45:31.207
He just challenged the ego of these Romans

00:45:32.466 --> 00:45:34.385
and of these Jews,

00:45:34.887 --> 00:45:36.953
those who were angry with Him,

00:45:37.198 --> 00:45:39.398
and that’s why He was crucified.

00:45:41.952 --> 00:45:45.552
And we have to crucify our ego now through His cross,

00:45:47.209 --> 00:45:52.435
otherwise we are going to do the same again to ourselves that,

00:45:52.647 --> 00:45:58.260
in our own being, we crucify our Christ by our ego.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:01.140
It is a very symbolic death of Christ.

00:46:01.475 --> 00:46:06.419
His birth in the most humble place, in a very humble place.

00:46:06.636 --> 00:46:09.861
He is born in the optic thalamus, you can say:

00:46:09.995 --> 00:46:13.120
is the place where there brain, all activities coming and,

00:46:13.234 --> 00:46:19.502
all the, all sorts of problems there,
facing you, and there He lives.

00:46:19.848 --> 00:46:25.205
And you have to just awaken Him there so that your ego

00:46:25.328 --> 00:46:27.262
is crucified once for all.

00:46:27.838 --> 00:46:30.438
But I don’t say, “You fight your ego,”

00:46:30.585 --> 00:46:32.704
because it is not that important to fight.

00:46:32.828 --> 00:46:34.848
You are fighting with your shadow.

00:46:34.971 --> 00:46:37.549
You have shadow, which is called as ego:

00:46:37.705 --> 00:46:41.639
Which is not to be fought and to waste your energy on him.

00:46:41.807 --> 00:46:43.324
There’s no need to fight him.

00:46:43.417 --> 00:46:46.282
Only thing [is], if you stand in the centre of the light

00:46:46.383 --> 00:46:49.061
– you don’t see any shadow. It is so simple as that.

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:52.527
If you stand in the centre of light that is Christ,

00:46:52.661 --> 00:46:54.435
you don’t see any shadow anywhere.

00:46:54.525 --> 00:46:57.438
But when I say this I may sound like other people who give sermons,

00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:59.536
“Stand in the shadow of Christ”

00:46:59.637 --> 00:47:03.386
or “ Stand in the light of Christ.” Now what does that mean?

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:07.843
Where is that light, where is that place where you should stand?

00:47:08.052 --> 00:47:12.808
And that place is here in the centre of your

00:47:13.668 --> 00:47:17.417
optic thalamus where there is no thought.

00:47:17.786 --> 00:47:20.653
You have to stand in thoughtless awareness.

00:47:21.112 --> 00:47:22.645
(interruption in talk)…

00:47:23.288 --> 00:47:26.993
(Many people who have had a problem with Agya...

00:47:27.172 --> 00:47:29.616
... many people who have come…)

00:47:31.056 --> 00:47:35.386
thoughts will stop and they will be beyond thought.

00:47:35.744 --> 00:47:40.263
And this a very, very important chakra for sahaja yogis

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.578
because when the Kundalini rises above,

00:47:44.003 --> 00:47:47.741
above the Agya chakra – immediately there is no thought.

00:47:47.864 --> 00:47:52.146
You do not get any thoughts from ego or superego.

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:54.702
But there is a wobbling in the Agya

00:47:54.814 --> 00:47:58.028
because of your imbalanced ways.

00:47:58.151 --> 00:47:59.802
And the imbalanced ways are,

00:47:59.926 --> 00:48:03.193
that sometimes you are with ego or with superego.

00:48:03.545 --> 00:48:06.780
This has happened to our people in the West

00:48:06.948 --> 00:48:08.778
because we have had so much of ego

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.692
[that] we got really tired of it. We got frightened with it.

00:48:11.782 --> 00:48:14.649
Then we started taking to drugs and things

00:48:14.773 --> 00:48:18.354
to increase our superego.

00:48:18.532 --> 00:48:21.572
But by doing that, what we are doing is pushing by one end

00:48:21.695 --> 00:48:23.124
bringing by another end

00:48:23.214 --> 00:48:26.747
and that’s how we are wobbling our ego and superego,

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.220
by which we are not helping ourselves at all.

00:48:30.628 --> 00:48:32.842
So what one has to do is to rise

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:35.532
within oneself up to the point of Agya

00:48:35.668 --> 00:48:37.786
and try to steady your Agya.

00:48:37.942 --> 00:48:40.766
There are many people have asked Me one question:

00:48:40.879 --> 00:48:42.612
“How to steady the Agya?”

00:48:45.102 --> 00:48:50.034
Agya is placed at the crossing point of our nerves

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:54.610
and also optic thalamus. Now, so it is said that,

00:48:54.776 --> 00:48:58.260
if you have wobbling eyes, you’ll have a wobbling Agya.

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:02.197
You have to steady your eyes, you have to soothe them.

00:49:02.359 --> 00:49:08.050
Now it is very, very out of date, ancient, old

00:49:08.185 --> 00:49:11.577
and all sorts of names that you call it, to a thing like that,

00:49:11.678 --> 00:49:15.550
but you must steady your eyes and steady them in such a way that

00:49:15.651 --> 00:49:17.918
it is very soothing for the eyes.

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:21.284
[That] which is the most soothing thing for the eyes

00:49:21.385 --> 00:49:22.802
is the green grass.

00:49:24.216 --> 00:49:28.747
If you could see the green grass with your eyes, means you walk

00:49:29.655 --> 00:49:32.161
with your eyes on the ground,

00:49:32.565 --> 00:49:35.812
your eyes will be soothed, your Agya will be alright.

00:49:35.938 --> 00:49:37.676
That’s why Christ said that,

00:49:37.788 --> 00:49:41.125
“I tell you about the adulterous eyes”.

00:49:41.279 --> 00:49:43.479
He talked about adulterous eyes.

00:49:43.772 --> 00:49:46.239
The eyes with which you do adultery.

00:49:47.376 --> 00:49:49.710
Is a very common thing these days.

00:49:49.821 --> 00:49:53.688
Every woman, a man must see; every man, a woman must see.

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:56.127
As if it is the most important job,

00:49:56.227 --> 00:49:59.341
if you have not seen one woman you are finished!

00:49:59.509 --> 00:50:03.446
I mean this is being modern. But I am an old fashioned lady,

00:50:03.581 --> 00:50:06.538
and, as at the time of Christ, He said,

00:50:06.683 --> 00:50:09.116
“You should not have adulterous eyes.”

00:50:09.206 --> 00:50:12.072
And the ones who have adulterous eyes are,

00:50:12.543 --> 00:50:17.806
no more than any other, but our Western Christians,

00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:21.466
who all the time, even in the church,

00:50:21.623 --> 00:50:23.621
even when they’re giving sermons,

00:50:23.722 --> 00:50:26.122
their eyes are moving with adultery.

00:50:27.242 --> 00:50:30.333
These eyes have to be very, very pure,

00:50:30.545 --> 00:50:33.737
very, very deep and very, very loving

00:50:34.016 --> 00:50:36.940
when you want to have your Agya alright,

00:50:37.104 --> 00:50:39.704
because you receive through your eyes.

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:41.516
Say, if you have closed your eyes,

00:50:41.628 --> 00:50:43.525
you do not put your attention to anything

00:50:43.603 --> 00:50:44.797
because your eyes are closed,

00:50:44.887 --> 00:50:47.498
you are not adding more thoughts to yourself.

00:50:47.588 --> 00:50:50.935
But if your eyes are open you are adding much more thoughts

00:50:51.036 --> 00:50:53.435
because everywhere the eyes go, the attention goes,

00:50:53.567 --> 00:50:56.616
and you see things and create thoughts and put in them.

00:50:56.695 --> 00:51:01.155
So your attention which has to go to the Spirit,

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:02.990
which has to go to God,

00:51:03.298 --> 00:51:07.260
which has to shine through the window of Divine:

00:51:07.695 --> 00:51:10.362
this beautiful thing is ruined

00:51:10.508 --> 00:51:15.414
by the way we use our eyes and we do not respect it.

00:51:17.033 --> 00:51:19.141
There’s nothing so pure

00:51:19.426 --> 00:51:24.129
and beautiful as the grass on the ground

00:51:24.409 --> 00:51:28.995
or the ground itself, which takes our feet, which supports us,

00:51:29.174 --> 00:51:32.176
which looks after us, enriches us.

00:51:33.062 --> 00:51:34.573
We should put our eyes

00:51:34.677 --> 00:51:37.944
on the Mother Earth instead of looking at every person.

00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:39.830
But from Sahaja Yoga point of view,

00:51:39.942 --> 00:51:42.564
now many of you know what happens to your eyes

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:44.238
when you look at somebody:

00:51:44.328 --> 00:51:48.134
maybe an entity might enter your eyes.

00:51:48.659 --> 00:51:50.592
And it is, you’ll be amazed,

00:51:50.891 --> 00:51:53.157
that it is the play of the entity

00:51:53.277 --> 00:51:55.687
what we call this so-called flirting is.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.629
I have talked about it, before also,

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:01.089
and people didn’t like it when I told them about it,

00:52:01.223 --> 00:52:05.223
but I have seen actual entities entering from eyes to eyes.

00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:09.357
I have seen very simple people who come down

00:52:09.483 --> 00:52:11.616
to such places, say in a party.

00:52:12.455 --> 00:52:16.708
In a party, people are just exchanging entities

00:52:16.886 --> 00:52:18.185
from one eye to another.

00:52:18.308 --> 00:52:20.038
Once it goes to another person,

00:52:20.127 --> 00:52:21.945
he puts his entity into another person,

00:52:22.087 --> 00:52:23.977
and that goes into another person.

00:52:24.078 --> 00:52:26.744
All the time your attention is diverted

00:52:26.913 --> 00:52:30.113
and you feel it is attracted towards something,

00:52:30.317 --> 00:52:32.717
you do not know why it is attracted.

00:52:33.156 --> 00:52:36.422
Now the certain symbols are also made like that.

00:52:36.649 --> 00:52:38.449
To add up to the problems,

00:52:38.614 --> 00:52:40.984
all the society is working at it

00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.780
– that you should appear in such a way

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:45.137
that every man should look at you,

00:52:47.151 --> 00:52:51.229
every woman should look at you. Why? What is the use?

00:52:51.453 --> 00:52:54.053
Supposing I look at you what do I get?

00:52:54.957 --> 00:52:57.491
What do I get by looking at a person?

00:52:58.975 --> 00:53:02.241
What is the advantage? Just looking at a person?

00:53:02.401 --> 00:53:05.401
We are wasting such a lot of energy for what?

00:53:06.695 --> 00:53:09.961
In the same way if you are walking on the roads,

00:53:10.143 --> 00:53:13.961
on, say, some, we are seeing some beautiful things, alright.

00:53:14.116 --> 00:53:16.337
If you have to buy something, alright go ahead,

00:53:16.416 --> 00:53:18.715
see those things, whatever you have to select is alright.

00:53:18.816 --> 00:53:22.487
But all the time just because your eyes are such,

00:53:22.648 --> 00:53:25.914
you are just doing it and you do not know the reason

00:53:26.034 --> 00:53:27.746
why you are doing like this,

00:53:27.858 --> 00:53:30.524
all the time why your eyes are wobbling.

00:53:31.849 --> 00:53:36.643
And that is a sure and certain sign for a person to become mad.

00:53:38.027 --> 00:53:41.565
Absolutely, that’s a sure and certain sign is,

00:53:41.677 --> 00:53:45.672
when a person is mad how do you make it out

00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:47.384
that a person is lunatic?

00:53:47.496 --> 00:53:52.384
If you see his eyes the iris in the eyes are all the time wobbling,

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.987
they cannot keep it steady.

00:53:55.096 --> 00:53:57.467
Or [if] they are sick they’re also,

00:53:57.545 --> 00:54:01.886
you can see that these eyes are all the time wobbling,

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:03.360
there is no steadiness.

00:54:03.483 --> 00:54:05.302
Not only this but you have seen

00:54:05.402 --> 00:54:07.422
those people who have come in the Sahaja Yoga

00:54:07.512 --> 00:54:12.189
when they close their eyes they find their eyes are flickering.

00:54:12.266 --> 00:54:14.266
Their eyelids are flickering.

00:54:14.355 --> 00:54:16.732
That means there’s some sort of a disturbance

00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:18.477
in the Kundalini rising.

00:54:21.487 --> 00:54:24.578
Whole tension if you call it as hundred

00:54:24.846 --> 00:54:29.354
then at least 80% of it comes through our eyes.

00:54:31.475 --> 00:54:34.734
Then how important it is to protect our eyes

00:54:34.879 --> 00:54:38.562
from all kind of useless activities we are doing.

00:54:40.661 --> 00:54:47.468
Christ – Christ’s life shows so many aspects

00:54:48.016 --> 00:54:50.627
of how to respect others.

00:54:50.783 --> 00:54:53.395
But one of them which has been very much misused

00:54:53.484 --> 00:54:56.018
throughout is that of the prostitute.

00:54:59.042 --> 00:55:03.573
He saved the prostitute, He saved her no doubt.

00:55:04.165 --> 00:55:07.334
But you spoil the prostitutes.

00:55:08.786 --> 00:55:11.719
A good woman you make her into prostitutes.

00:55:12.424 --> 00:55:16.024
You give her ideas by which she becomes a prostitute.

00:55:16.185 --> 00:55:19.785
A good hussif (housewife) is turned into a prostitute

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.366
by an egoistical man.

00:55:21.931 --> 00:55:27.745
Young small girls who are virgins are being destroyed

00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:32.298
by your dirty glances. Do you realise this?

00:55:32.509 --> 00:55:35.970
That you are doing just the opposite what Christ had done?

00:55:36.081 --> 00:55:37.934
And you say that He saved, Christ,

00:55:38.047 --> 00:55:40.568
so even if we are prostitutes He’ll save us.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:47.526
But why be prostitutes? This is such a stupid style of thinking.

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:51.794
That we should become prostitutes so that Christ will save us.

00:55:56.176 --> 00:55:58.669
One has to think about

00:55:58.893 --> 00:56:03.222
all these things in the proper light of Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:03.408 --> 00:56:05.142
Unless and until you are realised,

00:56:05.254 --> 00:56:07.454
My talk is just useless for you.

00:56:08.144 --> 00:56:11.278
But once you are realised, you will know that,

00:56:11.403 --> 00:56:13.137
if you glance at someone,

00:56:13.279 --> 00:56:16.068
you might suddenly get a headache at the back,

00:56:16.157 --> 00:56:19.129
you might feel a dart has gone into your head

00:56:19.207 --> 00:56:22.533
or something has happened, you might feel that you’re blinding

00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:25.155
with somebody’s face

00:56:25.301 --> 00:56:27.868
and you will get all kinds of experiences

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:31.380
by which you will know how important are your eyes.

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.236
All your nervousness and everything can be cured

00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:37.882
if you have pure eyes.

00:56:38.101 --> 00:56:40.712
But it is such a vicious circle that, through your eyes,

00:56:40.802 --> 00:56:44.005
you gather all the bad, and is accumulated in the Agya

00:56:44.116 --> 00:56:47.677
and you have to clear the Agya to make the eyes clear.

00:56:47.788 --> 00:56:49.321
It’s a vicious circle.

00:56:49.441 --> 00:56:51.460
But it can start at a point as I said,

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.694
we have to ask for forgiveness.

00:56:54.846 --> 00:57:01.453
Secondly we have to bring Christ in our Agya chakra.

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:07.301
Thirdly we have to give up all drugs

00:57:07.525 --> 00:57:10.459
and all intoxicants and all smoking.

00:57:10.772 --> 00:57:12.718
That happens automatically

00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:15.830
when you are a sahaja yogi, it will work out.

00:57:15.973 --> 00:57:20.609
But eyes express the whole of your being, your brain,

00:57:20.911 --> 00:57:25.364
your body, your limbs everything.

00:57:25.625 --> 00:57:33.102
And if your Agya is alright then your eyes are perfectly alright.

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.879
They emit nothing but love wherever they glance.

00:57:38.081 --> 00:57:42.147
Only with a glance of your eyes you can raise the Kundalini.

00:57:43.033 --> 00:57:47.408
Only with the glance of your eyes you can cure people.

00:57:47.799 --> 00:57:52.720
Only with your glance you can bring joy into the destroyed

00:57:52.832 --> 00:57:54.299
and the ruined people.

00:57:54.692 --> 00:57:59.401
So these eyes which you see are the windows of your being,

00:57:59.547 --> 00:58:00.547
of your heart.

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:05.272
When the Spirit is expressed through your eyes,

00:58:05.395 --> 00:58:07.694
you must have noticed yourself that,

00:58:07.795 --> 00:58:11.461
when the Kundalini rises then the eyes become dilated.

00:58:12.917 --> 00:58:16.176
And a realised soul has got black eyes

00:58:16.299 --> 00:58:21.622
because they have these eyes are dilated.

00:58:21.812 --> 00:58:25.834
At least when I see them they are all dilated black eyes.

00:58:25.979 --> 00:58:27.113
Apart from that,

00:58:27.252 --> 00:58:31.102
a realised soul can be made out by his eyes which are sparkling,

00:58:31.225 --> 00:58:33.356
there’s a sparkle like diamonds; they

00:58:33.457 --> 00:58:37.050
sparkle all the time and you can make out from the eyes

00:58:37.161 --> 00:58:39.294
that this person is a realised soul.

00:58:39.428 --> 00:58:42.653
There’s a tremendous difference between a non-realised

00:58:42.787 --> 00:58:45.587
soul’s eyes and the realised soul’s eyes.

00:58:45.712 --> 00:58:50.965
So you can imagine how your Spirit sees through your eyes,

00:58:51.188 --> 00:58:54.988
but if the eyes are not pure It doesn’t stay there long.

00:58:55.463 --> 00:58:58.018
So if we have to understand Christ,

00:58:58.197 --> 00:59:00.697
physically, we have to respect our eyes,

00:59:00.809 --> 00:59:07.200
mentally, we have to give up all that is impure in our mind.

00:59:07.703 --> 00:59:11.140
Now, so we come to the impurities of the mind:

00:59:11.362 --> 00:59:14.131
And the impurities of mind are,

00:59:14.355 --> 00:59:17.821
I mean, there are so many poisons, you know, about.

00:59:17.941 --> 00:59:20.609
I mean there are books and books written about the poisons.

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:24.046
And the psychologists are supposed to take out all your poisons.

00:59:24.158 --> 00:59:25.966
I don’t know if they can do it at all.

00:59:26.067 --> 00:59:27.566
But they have the worst Agya.

00:59:27.667 --> 00:59:30.600
All these psychologists have the worst Agya

00:59:30.725 --> 00:59:34.925
and I don’t think they are capable of really giving any relief

00:59:35.022 --> 00:59:37.555
to people who are suffering mentally.

00:59:38.448 --> 00:59:40.848
Mental sufferings are of two types.

00:59:41.265 --> 00:59:48.632
Say the same thing is that one is…vibrations are so much…

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:58.821
One type of mental troubles are

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.906
where people oppress you very much

01:00:02.097 --> 01:00:06.237
– you go on bearing the cross!

01:00:06.755 --> 01:00:10.488
Now this is a very wrong idea people have about Christ.

01:00:11.386 --> 01:00:13.453
Bearing the cross doesn’t mean

01:00:13.597 --> 01:00:16.196
that, anybody who tries to oppress,

01:00:16.342 --> 01:00:20.009
you should go on taking the enslavement upon yourself.

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:24.672
You’re not to enslave to anyone whatsoever.

01:00:26.614 --> 01:00:29.681
Anybody who tries to make a slave out of you,

01:00:29.773 --> 01:00:32.384
you should deny it absolutely!

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:34.624
You should say ‘hum’, ‘I am’,

01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:36.911
“Who are you to dominate me?”

01:00:37.043 --> 01:00:39.386
Anyone whether you are of a black skin,

01:00:39.509 --> 01:00:42.776
or a red skin or a yellow skin, nobody has right

01:00:44.157 --> 01:00:46.823
to dominate anyone in this whole world,

01:00:47.314 --> 01:00:50.514
and if anybody is doing it, “Oh what to do now,

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:54.078
after all we are poor people, or we are like this

01:00:54.179 --> 01:00:56.359
or he’s supporting,” and all that:

01:00:56.494 --> 01:01:00.694
then they are running away from their duty towards themselves.

01:01:01.472 --> 01:01:03.938
Such people cannot get Realisation.

01:01:04.507 --> 01:01:06.974
Slaves are not going to become kings.

01:01:09.713 --> 01:01:14.121
So the slavery that is supposed to be confused

01:01:14.255 --> 01:01:19.835
with bearing the cross is another confusion of modern times.

01:01:21.968 --> 01:01:24.368
We have to rise in our self-respect

01:01:24.579 --> 01:01:27.949
and we have to understand that no one in this world

01:01:28.095 --> 01:01:30.304
has a right to dominate us.

01:01:31.559 --> 01:01:34.963
But then what is bearing of the cross is?

01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:39.572
First of all the people of His level never suffer.

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:42.311
It’s just a joke going on. It’s a leela,

01:01:42.412 --> 01:01:44.264
it’s a play going on for them.

01:01:44.365 --> 01:01:45.632
They never suffer,

01:01:49.175 --> 01:01:54.141
and even if they so-called act as suffering,

01:01:55.258 --> 01:01:58.191
they just do it because they want to do it.

01:01:59.242 --> 01:02:03.673
They are not helpless people, they are not slaves.

01:02:04.995 --> 01:02:07.795
And those who think that by bearing it up

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:12.159
and by suffering it we are becoming Christians,

01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:15.424
they should know they are psychological cases.

01:02:17.226 --> 01:02:20.574
And if they are crying and weeping and all the time saying,

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.385
“What to do? I am in love and my lover tortures me.”

01:02:25.865 --> 01:02:29.198
You are neither in love neither you have a lover.

01:02:29.503 --> 01:02:32.303
It is a kind of a psychological clubbing.

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:35.665
That he is a dominating man and you like his domination,

01:02:35.788 --> 01:02:38.855
that’s why you are together, is a simple fact.

01:02:41.435 --> 01:02:48.555
So every human being has his own self-respect.

01:02:48.746 --> 01:02:53.511
And he must respect his self that is the Spirit within him.

01:02:54.047 --> 01:02:56.180
And nothing should dominate it.

01:02:56.468 --> 01:02:59.935
Whether you belong to this country or that country,

01:03:00.051 --> 01:03:03.717
or this ‘ism’ or that ‘ism’. All this will break down.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.898
Under the rule of God

01:03:09.714 --> 01:03:13.047
nobody has the right to dominate anybody’s Spirit.

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:18.345
But when you are given freedom,

01:03:18.493 --> 01:03:21.293
you go to the other side that is Mr. Ego.

01:03:22.823 --> 01:03:25.556
You do not know how to use your freedom,

01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:28.662
so you try to dominate others.

01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:33.212
Your freedom is [making] everybody’s freedom is in danger.

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:36.952
You are on top of everyone, and torturing everybody’s souls.

01:03:37.086 --> 01:03:42.481
And you are dominating by land and by properties

01:03:42.627 --> 01:03:45.617
or by possessions.

01:03:49.982 --> 01:03:52.515
So either this way or that way,

01:03:52.805 --> 01:03:57.035
mentally if you are of this category or that category,

01:03:57.605 --> 01:03:59.836
you are against yourself.

01:04:01.102 --> 01:04:04.595
Just be in the centre and see for yourself.

01:04:05.578 --> 01:04:07.999
Just be looking at it.

01:04:08.848 --> 01:04:13.211
Are you emitting love towards another person?

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:17.787
If you are a slave, how can you love? You cannot.

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:28.747
If you are ‘free’ and abandoned, how can you love?

01:04:31.006 --> 01:04:35.749
Love has its own bondages, very sweet and beautiful.

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:41.786
You have to live with them. You enjoy those bondages.

01:04:41.988 --> 01:04:44.611
For a little child will come to your house

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:48.910
and he will spoil your house, no doubt, and that he should do,

01:04:49.466 --> 01:04:51.866
and you should enjoy that spoiling.

01:04:53.617 --> 01:04:58.084
Then your freedom, if it is challenged by a little child’s crying,

01:04:58.257 --> 01:05:03.245
then you are not wise people. This is abandonment! gs.

01:05:04.963 --> 01:05:07.318
Or I would say it is loneliness,

01:05:07.453 --> 01:05:13.613
it is cutting out from the Primordial, from the Big One,

01:05:14.562 --> 01:05:16.762
from the large one that you are:

01:05:17.475 --> 01:05:22.910
is not to be able to tolerate the freedom of others.

01:05:23.134 --> 01:05:26.067
A child has no freedom to cry in the house?

01:05:26.739 --> 01:05:30.622
What sort of freedom you conceive of.

01:05:31.218 --> 01:05:32.685
A mother has no right

01:05:32.848 --> 01:05:34.990
to say something she wants to say about her child?

01:05:35.092 --> 01:05:38.759
Which is her duty to tell him what is right and wrong.

01:05:38.886 --> 01:05:41.999
If the son does not have [the] right to eat whatever he likes

01:05:42.101 --> 01:05:43.819
in his own mother’s family

01:05:43.908 --> 01:05:45.984
then what sort of freedom do you have?

01:05:46.085 --> 01:05:48.018
It’s such a confusion of thin

01:05:50.774 --> 01:05:55.305
So this kind of freedom is just the opposite and extreme

01:05:55.461 --> 01:05:56.528
of enslavement.

01:05:56.745 --> 01:06:01.186
But in the centre is love where you are bound by everyone.

01:06:01.432 --> 01:06:03.232
I am bound by My children;

01:06:03.479 --> 01:06:06.559
yes, I am, I am proud of them.

01:06:06.939 --> 01:06:10.465
They bound Me and I bound them too.

01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:15.048
It’s a mutual bounding which we enjoy among ourselves.

01:06:17.178 --> 01:06:21.711
There is such a give and take when there is such a bondage of love.

01:06:23.874 --> 01:06:27.608
But do we understand the importance of bondage of love?

01:06:27.803 --> 01:06:30.336
At the slightest pretext we break it.

01:06:30.508 --> 01:06:33.499
Say a wife says, “I would like to go out today”.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:38.000
The husband has said “Why? I am very tired don’t you understand?”

01:06:38.097 --> 01:06:41.501
Or if the husband says, “I feel like eating something,”

01:06:41.591 --> 01:06:44.592
or some particular thing, he says pancake or something,

01:06:44.693 --> 01:06:47.963
a small thing. “Oh I am very tired every time you are demand…”

01:06:48.086 --> 01:06:51.009
If she could just think [that], by making that little thing,

01:06:51.111 --> 01:06:52.796
he would be so very happy.

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:55.329
She should be dying to know what he wants.

01:06:55.441 --> 01:06:57.528
And he should be dying to do what she wants.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.671
And then enjoy each other’s company

01:06:59.794 --> 01:07:02.193
or you are wasting all your properties

01:07:02.293 --> 01:07:04.495
that you have as human beings.

01:07:05.043 --> 01:07:08.843
You don’t know how much you are wasting from each other.

01:07:09.976 --> 01:07:14.384
Every moment is filled with such beautiful bondages,

01:07:14.809 --> 01:07:18.075
where exchanges are there. What have you gained?

01:07:19.111 --> 01:07:22.604
The way you are fighting, the way you are going about:

01:07:22.728 --> 01:07:24.862
what have you gained let me see?

01:07:25.651 --> 01:07:28.163
When you die you have to announce in the paper that

01:07:28.264 --> 01:07:31.043
“XYZ is dead” and you find there is nobody.

01:07:31.144 --> 01:07:33.588
And you have even to pay for people to visit you

01:07:33.699 --> 01:07:37.237
when you die. This is the case today.

01:07:39.013 --> 01:07:43.320
Such dryness, such emptiness, such loneliness exists.

01:07:43.678 --> 01:07:46.078
What have you achieved through this?

01:07:47.484 --> 01:07:50.385
So this bondage we have to [have].

01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:52.426
And there is no question of sacrifice,

01:07:52.528 --> 01:07:55.508
the way we must sacrifice for the family.

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:57.353
What are you sacrificing?

01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:01.116
I mean if you pay for your family

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:04.527
you get the joy out of it, that’s why you do it.

01:08:06.104 --> 01:08:09.262
If you have to lead a nice good life

01:08:09.981 --> 01:08:12.181
you are not sacrificing anything

01:08:12.582 --> 01:08:16.666
but you are gaining by that, leading a good life.

01:08:18.273 --> 01:08:21.073
If your wife says, “Don’t go to the pub,”

01:08:21.225 --> 01:08:23.091
and if you do not go there,

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:27.039
then you should not say, “She is an orthodox, old fashioned

01:08:27.173 --> 01:08:29.171
this that, that and that and that.”

01:08:29.283 --> 01:08:31.251
But instead you should thank you stars that,

01:08:31.352 --> 01:08:33.427
in this modern times also that, there is somebody

01:08:33.528 --> 01:08:35.462
who’s telling you the truth.

01:08:37.122 --> 01:08:39.722
Because the whole edifice has come up,

01:08:40.013 --> 01:08:43.346
do you mean to say that truth should not be told?

01:08:44.242 --> 01:08:47.376
All this is falsehood in which you are living,

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:50.924
and if you have to be happy – come down to Reality.

01:08:54.209 --> 01:08:55.942
Friends, also same thing:

01:08:56.084 --> 01:08:58.237
With the friends what sort of relations do

01:08:58.339 --> 01:09:01.753
we have with our friends? What do we expect from them?

01:09:01.843 --> 01:09:03.843
Sending them a Christmas card

01:09:05.106 --> 01:09:08.506
and then if they don’t send, feeling bad about it.

01:09:11.423 --> 01:09:15.356
There are no deeper bondages, we have not lived with them.

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:18.386
If you allow our self to be bound by them,

01:09:18.655 --> 01:09:20.709
they will be bound by us.

01:09:21.997 --> 01:09:23.397
You better try this.

01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:27.727
Try to be bound by them, don’t be afraid of anybody else.

01:09:27.901 --> 01:09:29.968
Just try to be bound by others

01:09:30.245 --> 01:09:33.247
and you’ll be amazed how much they will be giving you.

01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:35.448
I am a living example of this.

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:41.223
I can tell you, I am a living example of this;

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:43.092
I am bound by all of you.

01:09:43.648 --> 01:09:47.582
If somebody says, “Mother when are you going to leave us?”

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.668
No I cannot. I cannot. I am just bound by you.

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:53.592
I just do not want to leave because I love you very much.

01:09:53.705 --> 01:09:57.811
How can I leave you? It’s impossible for Me.

01:09:58.325 --> 01:10:01.075
So then, what do I gain out of this life?

01:10:01.243 --> 01:10:04.925
Every – thing – that – is – in – this – world!

01:10:05.539 --> 01:10:07.406
What do you want Me to get?

01:10:07.671 --> 01:10:10.738
I cannot even count what I can get out of it.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.122
Immeasurable ocean.

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:18.289
I become an ocean Myself.

01:10:19.294 --> 01:10:23.825
Break your ideas about your own personal

01:10:24.026 --> 01:10:29.359
freedom and liberation, [what you are doing]
is liberating your intelligence,

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:34.733
you are liberating your own wisdom.

01:10:36.698 --> 01:10:40.738
And the sweetness and the beauty

01:10:41.274 --> 01:10:45.447
which is never perishable, whether you are old or young.

01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:49.320
That is going to be your own.

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:54.350
But these poisons that are being built outside and inside you,

01:10:54.570 --> 01:11:00.329
please throw them away. These are mental poisons.

01:11:01.334 --> 01:11:03.734
Through Agya you can take them out.

01:11:04.158 --> 01:11:09.492
You see, this is an opening also through which many things go out.

01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:13.002
Try to work it out.

01:11:13.455 --> 01:11:17.606
Look at the tree with love

01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:22.223
and you’ll find that the tree itself is giving you the joy

01:11:22.343 --> 01:11:25.810
of its creation. Because you’ll become thoughtless.

01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:29.348
And the Creator who has made that beautiful tree

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:33.118
will be pouring all that joy which is stored into it.

01:11:33.887 --> 01:11:39.768
Every human being is a store of joy, unlimited!

01:11:40.137 --> 01:11:42.815
I assure you, believe Me.

01:11:43.518 --> 01:11:48.957
And don’t waste them because somebody is not properly dressed,

01:11:49.984 --> 01:11:53.517
or he’s not according to the way you want him to be:

01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:56.278
which you learnt in your public school!

01:11:57.875 --> 01:12:02.099
Every doorstep, everywhere there is beauty lying,

01:12:02.312 --> 01:12:03.378
do not miss it.

01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:10.124
But if you have a possessiveness about it, an adultery about it,

01:12:12.501 --> 01:12:14.568
then you can never enjoy them,

01:12:17.435 --> 01:12:21.307
you can never enjoy all that beauty, all that store,

01:12:21.452 --> 01:12:27.151
all that wealth that is in every human being:

01:12:27.252 --> 01:12:29.852
every moment it is bubbling.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:35.410
For Agya it’s a good thing, Christmas is coming.

01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:40.034
And at the time that, when I have to wish you a Happy Christmas,

01:12:40.478 --> 01:12:42.899
that, at this occasion,

01:12:43.123 --> 01:12:47.182
I am speaking about Agya chakra in which,

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:49.563
what I said is, Agya is:

01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:52.950
one must know what to order and how to obey,

01:12:54.180 --> 01:13:01.822
obey the Divine, obey your elders, obey your Self

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:08.921
and not your ego – and then you can order also others;

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:13.480
not only human beings, but you can even order The Sun

01:13:13.553 --> 01:13:17.553
and The Moon and all the winds and everything in the world.

01:13:18.504 --> 01:13:22.170
Everything you can control, everything with this Agya.

01:13:22.879 --> 01:13:24.145
You try one thing.

01:13:24.563 --> 01:13:27.577
If you know somebody is going to do something wrong,

01:13:27.711 --> 01:13:33.086
just take his name and put it to Agya: He’ll not do it. Try it!

01:13:34.179 --> 01:13:36.446
This is a trick I’m telling about

01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:39.216
for those who are realised souls not for those

01:13:39.308 --> 01:13:42.342
who are not yet realised. But those who are realised can try.

01:13:42.432 --> 01:13:45.869
If the other person is doing something wrong you can try your Agya.

01:13:45.992 --> 01:13:48.905
Anything you order on your Agya will be respected

01:13:49.017 --> 01:13:51.550
but your Agya must have Christ there.

01:13:51.874 --> 01:13:57.376
Because you have The Great Support awakened within you,

01:13:57.655 --> 01:14:01.722
which does not exist [only] here, but into every man’s head.

01:14:03.292 --> 01:14:07.314
It is all pervading, into all small atoms and molecules,

01:14:07.425 --> 01:14:10.818
it is everywhere into The Sun and any place you go.

01:14:10.941 --> 01:14:11.941
It is there.

01:14:14.725 --> 01:14:20.840
So try to develop your Agya, that is the mastery of your self.

01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:24.710
Those who have a good Agya can master anything.

01:14:25.015 --> 01:14:29.927
And understand that the idea about mastering worldly things

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:32.673
and mastering human beings and mastering this

01:14:32.785 --> 01:14:37.118
and some of them are mastering in, say, other crafts and things,

01:14:37.271 --> 01:14:39.605
best thing is to master your Agya!

01:14:40.106 --> 01:14:43.878
And you really become the master of yourself

01:14:44.202 --> 01:14:46.669
by which you can master many things.

01:14:46.925 --> 01:14:51.459
And today on this great day when I’m wishing you a Happy Christmas,

01:14:51.906 --> 01:14:57.587
I wish you to have the most powerful Agya,

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:00.031
that people, when they see your forehead

01:15:00.142 --> 01:15:03.502
should know that Christ is reborn again with in you.

01:15:03.648 --> 01:15:04.848
May God bless you!

01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:12.621
We not have any programs after days, I’m sorry.

01:15:12.733 --> 01:15:14.295
Because I’m going to India.

01:15:14.406 --> 01:15:16.940
I’m going on the 7th, the 9th back…

01:15:17.118 --> 01:15:18.915
I think in the end of march,

01:15:19.005 --> 01:15:22.119
all of you who have been here who have got realization

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:23.896
and have not got realization

01:15:23.997 --> 01:15:26.641
should know that it is very subtile thing

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:28.702
which has worked within you,

01:15:28.803 --> 01:15:31.470
and it has helped all of you every way.

01:15:31.604 --> 01:15:33.471
So, we have also an ashram.

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:36.980
The address of the ashram will be now told to you,

01:15:37.095 --> 01:15:40.175
so that you note it down for yourself, where is the ashram.

01:15:40.265 --> 01:15:43.133
It is very near to the Dolli Hills station (not clear).

01:15:43.256 --> 01:15:45.131
Please go and meet those people.

01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:47.311
And meet your brothers and sisters who are there,

01:15:47.411 --> 01:15:50.156
and there is a telephone number will be there.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.824
Please contact them, and keep the contact.

01:15:52.936 --> 01:15:55.424
Another thing is that we are going to have

01:15:55.525 --> 01:15:57.459
a new years day celebration.

01:15:57.568 --> 01:15:59.701
Having all of us lunch together

01:15:59.978 --> 01:16:04.096
