00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.419
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.786
First of all, we have to know what is the truth we are seeking

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.941
and how we are going to seek it

00:01:56.351 --> 00:02:00.670
and what is the proof that you have got the truth.

00:02:05.336 --> 00:02:12.071
Firstly, we must know that you cannot purchase the truth.

00:02:18.251 --> 00:02:21.140
It is, you cannot market it,

00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:27.427
because truth is love

00:02:29.528 --> 00:02:32.871
and love is compassion.

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:50.058
So now I am going to tell you about the truth, about how in Greece they knew about the truth.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.067
Yours is a very, very ancient country.

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:12.400
And in our country also, in our old books, the ancient Puranas, it’s mentioned about your country.

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:24.748
They have described Athena very clearly.

00:03:27.622 --> 00:03:38.346
And gradually this great country became absolutely ignorant of whatever they knew.

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:58.236
Now between you and Me, I would like to tell you that there is a power within us in the triangular bone.

00:04:05.992 --> 00:04:10.804
If you can move out then somebody can show you.

00:04:11.206 --> 00:04:14.159
Ok; [Hindi]

00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:39.020
That is the bone which we call as sacrum.

00:04:43.624 --> 00:04:50.313
This name "sacrum" was given by Greeks in those days

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.931
meaning sacred.

00:05:01.402 --> 00:05:09.083
That means they knew there is a sacred bone below the spinal cord.

00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:22.109
This is the triangular bone that existed

00:05:22.109 --> 00:05:29.575
and was having this power, which in India we call it Kundalini.

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:42.953
So soon? [Laughter]

00:05:47.897 --> 00:05:53.759
Sometimes Greek language is very long and sometimes very short.

00:06:02.977 --> 00:06:18.180
Now this bone has this power and if you see Athena on her shield, she has this power and also, in her hand, she has this power she shows.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:41.254
This power was known to her and we call Athena as the Primordial Mother.

00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:53.142
The word "atha" in Sanskrit means primordial.

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.732
But this knowledge was lost later on.

00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:12.993
Now, from your country went Alexander to India.

00:07:18.184 --> 00:07:22.107
And he was Parthenian, Parthenian.

00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:26.908
He was Parthenian, he was following Parthenian religion, Pagan you can say.

00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:44.214
But when he went to India, he found that purity was the most important part in the Indian culture.

00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:54.569
And he had married an Indian lady.

00:07:57.164 --> 00:08:01.497
Also, he had brought a poet, a very well-known poet from India.

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:16.015
He described the Persepolis and also, he described Athens, everything in his poetry.

00:08:22.751 --> 00:08:35.023
But when Alexander came here, he wanted that this Catholic Church should be made into a purer Orthodox style.

00:08:45.652 --> 00:08:53.797
And I’m sure he must have written some book or he must have said that to maintain purity what we should do.

00:09:01.738 --> 00:09:05.990
All that code is the same what we follow in India.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.019
And the Orthodox Church didn’t believe in conversion. We also didn’t believe in conversion.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:29.289
This is the connection which took place in the existence of your Orthodox Church.

00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:39.112
And they respect, respected, all the religions.

00:09:44.736 --> 00:10:00.809
Now, I don’t know what are the changes. But whatever they have been saying and doing, is very met on Indian culture.

00:10:09.183 --> 00:10:21.543
I think also they got this sannyasi or the renunciation from Buddhism.

00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:31.899
There’s a very little difference I find.

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:38.395
But then the Western culture came in

00:10:41.392 --> 00:10:43.702
and everything went upside down.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:52.378
Moreover, even in India we had the same problem.

00:10:56.117 --> 00:11:00.846
The gods they had is the same as we have in India.

00:11:05.636 --> 00:11:12.262
But the gods, they made them human beings, you see, with lots of weaknesses.

00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:24.518
But India, in India we don’t think that way. Gods are gods.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:33.226
So, this is the basis on which you are here.

00:11:36.254 --> 00:11:40.868
It’s easier for Me to talk to you than to talk to English.

00:11:45.936 --> 00:11:53.361
Now this power existed in the triangular bone and is called as Kundalini.

00:11:58.614 --> 00:12:01.097
It is in three and a half coils.

00:12:04.002 --> 00:12:17.435
And when it rises, it passes through six centers and pierces through the last centre, which we call as Brahmarandra.

00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:32.413
This is the actualization of your baptism, actualization.

00:12:36.368 --> 00:12:43.269
It is not just somebody can say, “Now, I bless you.” It’s not like that. You have to have spiritual authority.

00:12:51.272 --> 00:12:56.397
And now it is happening everywhere.

00:13:00.198 --> 00:13:10.057
Somehow it is spreading very fast and I think now we have about, they say so, seventy-two nations where we have Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:25.180
So, when she rises, she nourishes all the centers. She nourishes all the centers

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.251
and integrates them.

00:13:36.599 --> 00:13:41.588
When they are integrated you become a personality of integration.

00:13:46.872 --> 00:13:51.017
But by that your Spirit is enlightened.

00:13:54.787 --> 00:13:57.288
And you become the Spirit.

00:13:59.389 --> 00:14:11.957
So, the truth is, we are not this body, this mind, these emotions, your thoughts, ambitions, but you are the pure Spirit.

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:24.697
That you have to become.

00:14:27.385 --> 00:14:35.350
As soon as you become the Spirit, all these problems, human problems, drop out.

00:14:41.066 --> 00:14:45.433
Physically you get perfect health.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.082
Mentally you get absolutely balanced,

00:14:57.438 --> 00:15:03.739
and emotionally you are absolutely satisfied.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.244
You become a saint

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.111
in the real sense of the word.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:23.218
But what you feel is the, in your hands, you see, you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:15:28.965 --> 00:15:36.897
There’s another thing great that you believe in the Mother, Holy Mother.

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:45.270
But in the Bible, she is just described as woman.

00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:54.050
But on the cross Christ said, “Behold the Mother.”

00:15:58.252 --> 00:16:06.980
But due to the human feeling and human understanding, you have Madonna.

00:16:12.264 --> 00:16:16.298
Especially Orthodox Church respects Madonna very much.

00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:31.320
The only maybe difference is that in Indian philosophy you have to achieve your Self-realization.

00:16:37.994 --> 00:16:41.067
That part should have been stressed.

00:16:44.174 --> 00:16:50.968
And you should get the actualization, actualization of your baptism.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.470
You have to be born again.

00:16:59.448 --> 00:17:07.388
But if you just, say, take a sort of a certificate, “I’m born again,” you don’t become it.

00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:16.244
It has to happen really

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:23.868
that you are born again as a Self-realized personality.

00:17:27.545 --> 00:17:30.505
Now the time has come for it

00:17:33.008 --> 00:17:37.436
and it is working out in so many countries. Why not in Greece?

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.234
All this is very simple.

00:17:50.045 --> 00:17:52.824
We call it "sahaja", meaning spontaneous,

00:17:55.698 --> 00:18:04.969
like one candle, one candle, which is enlightened, can enlighten many candles.

00:18:10.593 --> 00:18:16.241
But, by itself the candle cannot get enlightened.

00:18:20.938 --> 00:18:24.698
If you are enlightened then you can enlighten others.

00:18:28.529 --> 00:18:34.905
You can also then start feeling the others on your fingertips

00:18:39.633 --> 00:18:46.657
because your attention and your personality becomes collective.

00:18:52.868 --> 00:18:55.330
Who is the other?

00:18:57.184 --> 00:19:02.282
But this has to happen, this has to work out.

00:19:06.948 --> 00:19:16.329
Everyone is endowed with a Kundalini and everyone can get Self-realization.

00:19:22.046 --> 00:19:26.483
But Kundalini is the pure desire

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:36.835
and if you have the pure desire to become the Spirit, you will get it.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.229
All desires are impure.

00:19:47.608 --> 00:19:52.351
Today, you want to have a car and you are not satisfied.

00:19:52.351 --> 00:19:57.852
And you want to have a house; you are not satisfied. It goes on like this, you see, it’s economics.

00:20:09.316 --> 00:20:12.046
So, there is no satisfaction.

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:21.205
But after you get your Realization then the satisfaction settles in,

00:20:27.446 --> 00:20:31.708
because you become thoughtlessly aware,

00:20:36.467 --> 00:20:38.815
because you become a witness.

00:20:40.576 --> 00:20:43.180
You just watch, you don’t react.

00:20:45.467 --> 00:20:49.180
For example, see, there’s a beautiful carpet here.

00:20:52.579 --> 00:21:00.285
As a normal human being, I’ll think, “Oh, my God, this’ a nice carpet. Where will I find it? How much will I pay?”

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:10.574
And if it is mine, I’ll be more worried

00:21:13.046 --> 00:21:17.656
that, "This should not get spoilt. I’ll get insured or something".

00:21:22.075 --> 00:21:29.551
But if I am a Self-realized person, then I’ll just watch it

00:21:32.455 --> 00:21:34.059
and don’t react.

00:21:36.129 --> 00:21:43.284
The beauty that the artist has put in it gives such joy!

00:21:48.011 --> 00:21:52.080
So, you become full of joy.

00:21:54.985 --> 00:22:01.143
Your attention becomes enlightened, attention.

00:22:05.129 --> 00:22:08.519
Wherever you pay attention, it works out.

00:22:12.042 --> 00:22:14.845
All your problems are solved.

00:22:16.606 --> 00:22:20.410
Very surprisingly how they are solved so easily!

00:22:24.427 --> 00:22:29.579
And you get rid of your worries, all your problems.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:44.628
Also, other bad enemies we have, like anger, jealousy and all that, six of them,

00:22:52.754 --> 00:22:54.880
they all drop out.

00:22:56.919 --> 00:23:00.142
You start laughing at yourself

00:23:02.768 --> 00:23:08.016
and nothing but compassion and love flows from your heart.

00:23:12.496 --> 00:23:15.763
This is what exactly happens to you.

00:23:18.553 --> 00:23:26.491
And when that happens you really enjoy yourself and you enjoy others.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.846
You are so much filled with joy

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:48.190
that you become enthralled with it. You become enthralled.

00:23:54.895 --> 00:23:59.660
I mean, we have now people from all over the world, also sitting here.

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:06.613
Some have come even from Australia.

00:24:09.456 --> 00:24:17.064
But they are so much one with each other as if a drop has become the sea, ocean.

00:24:24.093 --> 00:24:26.579
It has to happen.

00:24:28.278 --> 00:24:31.592
We talk of peace; we talk of this and that.

00:24:31.592 --> 00:24:34.382
By talking is not going to work out.

00:24:38.738 --> 00:24:50.359
Only when we cross the limits of our human personality and become one with each other, automatically the peace comes in.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.108
This is what one has to achieve.

00:25:05.982 --> 00:25:14.668
No arguments, no payments, nothing needed, only this Kundalini has to rise.

00:25:20.941 --> 00:25:25.728
It is the living process of your evolution.

00:25:29.344 --> 00:25:36.625
From this human awareness you have to rise to a collective awareness.

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:49.528
I must say, this subject is very much deep and very expansive.

00:25:54.225 --> 00:25:59.115
I must have given thousands of lectures in my life time.

00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:08.969
But in short one has to know, why are we here?

00:26:12.862 --> 00:26:14.811
What do we have to achieve?

00:26:18.056 --> 00:26:24.719
And once you know what you have achieved, all your problems, all your questions have vanished.

00:26:31.517 --> 00:26:35.379
So, we have to have our Self-realization.

00:26:38.098 --> 00:26:41.609
Everyone has said that you are to be born again

00:26:44.576 --> 00:26:50.868
but you cannot just certify yourself, “I’m born again”.

00:26:56.183 --> 00:27:09.832
Because there are powers that are bestowed upon you by Kundalini that you start feeling the All-pervading Power of divine love.

00:27:20.052 --> 00:27:23.461
It’s not falsehood; it’s truth.

00:27:27.046 --> 00:27:34.832
And that surprises you that how you have suddenly transformed yourself.

00:27:40.796 --> 00:27:44.870
We don’t believe in conversion but in resurrection

00:27:47.805 --> 00:27:50.856
and the time has come for you to get it.

00:27:54.974 --> 00:27:58.742
So, it will take hardly ten minutes for you to get this.

00:28:03.995 --> 00:28:08.495
There’s nothing that can be harmful in it.

00:28:11.338 --> 00:28:16.534
All kinds of diseases have been cured,

00:28:19.315 --> 00:28:24.419
all kinds of mentally affected people are cured

00:28:28.745 --> 00:28:36.492
and also emotionally people are now so much detached.

00:28:42.455 --> 00:28:50.277
You don’t have to wear these saffron clothes, nothing. It automatically happens inside

00:28:55.437 --> 00:29:00.093
and you lead a very, very normal life.

00:29:08.034 --> 00:29:17.428
Now I’ve got great grandchildren. Great grandchildren I have got.

00:29:22.403 --> 00:29:25.051
And now I am seventy-seven

00:29:27.894 --> 00:29:30.757
and I’m travelling everywhere,

00:29:31.715 --> 00:29:33.291
going everywhere.

00:29:34.836 --> 00:29:40.481
So, you lead a normal life but inside you are peaceful and joyous

00:29:46.414 --> 00:29:48.682
and you give joy to others.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.272
That is the need of the day.

00:29:55.003 --> 00:29:58.577
Because this is the Last Judgement.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.640
Whether you take to falsehood or to truth, it’s your choice.

00:30:10.583 --> 00:30:19.302
But if you take to truth then you are in the heaven of joy.

00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:29.157
And at every moment you’ll feel you are blessed.

00:30:32.092 --> 00:30:40.425
Unless and until you are connected to the Divine, how can you get the blessings?

00:30:44.071 --> 00:30:48.296
You can go on praying, doing everything; you are not connected.

00:30:50.551 --> 00:30:56.285
Supposing this instrument is not connected to the mains, it is useless.

00:31:02.774 --> 00:31:10.605
In the same way if you are not connected to the Divine you don’t know anything.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:22.391
So, you have to decide, “Would you like to have your Self-realization or not?”

00:31:28.169 --> 00:31:32.046
If you don’t want to have, nobody can force you.

00:31:34.827 --> 00:31:36.666
You cannot pay for it,

00:31:37.902 --> 00:31:47.893
nothing of the kind. So those who don’t want should leave the hall. Then we’ll have the session for ten minutes.

00:31:58.764 --> 00:32:10.268
Of course, in the beginning you’ll do feel the cool breeze and everything, no doubt, but sometimes people take little time to mature.

00:32:19.631 --> 00:32:24.741
Also, the bad habits of destruction all fall off.

00:32:31.489 --> 00:32:39.905
I’ve seen young people giving up drugs overnight, overnight.

00:32:45.744 --> 00:32:51.956
That’s it. So, this is for our complete emancipation.

00:33:00.206 --> 00:33:09.497
Again, I would say, those who don’t want to have Self-realization can leave and nothing can happen to you,

00:33:09.497 --> 00:33:17.485
nothing that is disturbing or in any way physically harming. Nothing can happen.

00:33:17.485 --> 00:33:20.857
But only thing, you'll get your Self-realization.
