WEBVTT

00:07.539 --> 00:11.239
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:19.910 --> 00:26.606
First of all, we have to know what is the truth we are seeking

00:31.889 --> 00:34.761
and how we are going to seek it

00:37.171 --> 00:41.490
and what is the proof that you have got the truth.

00:46.156 --> 00:52.891
Firstly, we must know that you cannot purchase the truth.

00:59.071 --> 01:01.960
It is, you cannot market it,

01:05.143 --> 01:08.247
because truth is love

01:10.348 --> 01:13.691
and love is compassion.

01:19.129 --> 01:30.878
So now I am going to tell you about the truth, about how in Greece they knew about the truth.

01:37.460 --> 01:40.887
Yours is a very, very ancient country.

01:44.039 --> 01:53.220
And in our country also, in our old books, the ancient Puranas, it’s mentioned about your country.

02:01.445 --> 02:05.568
They have described Athena very clearly.

02:08.442 --> 02:19.166
And gradually this great country became absolutely ignorant of whatever they knew.

02:26.273 --> 02:39.056
Now between you and Me, I would like to tell you that there is a power within us in the triangular bone.

02:46.812 --> 02:51.624
If you can move out then somebody can show you.

02:52.026 --> 02:54.979
Ok; [Hindi]

03:15.681 --> 03:19.840
That is the bone which we call as sacrum.

03:24.444 --> 03:31.133
This name "sacrum" was given by Greeks in those days

03:37.220 --> 03:39.751
meaning sacred.

03:42.222 --> 03:49.903
That means they knew there is a sacred bone below the spinal cord.

03:58.102 --> 04:02.929
This is the triangular bone that existed

04:02.929 --> 04:10.395
and was having this power, which in India we call it Kundalini.

04:21.426 --> 04:23.773
So soon? [Laughter]

04:28.717 --> 04:34.579
Sometimes Greek language is very long and sometimes very short.

04:43.797 --> 04:59.000
Now this bone has this power and if you see Athena on her shield, she has this power and also, in her hand, she has this power she shows.

05:13.400 --> 05:22.074
This power was known to her and we call Athena as the Primordial Mother.

05:30.201 --> 05:33.962
The word "atha" in Sanskrit means primordial.

05:39.709 --> 05:44.552
But this knowledge was lost later on.

05:48.321 --> 05:53.813
Now, from your country went Alexander to India.

05:59.004 --> 06:02.927
And he was Parthenian, Parthenian.

06:02.927 --> 06:07.728
He was Parthenian, he was following Parthenian religion, Pagan you can say.

06:12.641 --> 06:25.034
But when he went to India, he found that purity was the most important part in the Indian culture.

06:32.574 --> 06:35.389
And he had married an Indian lady.

06:37.984 --> 06:42.317
Also, he had brought a poet, a very well-known poet from India.

06:46.829 --> 06:56.835
He described the Persepolis and also, he described Athens, everything in his poetry.

07:03.571 --> 07:15.843
But when Alexander came here, he wanted that this Catholic Church should be made into a purer Orthodox style.

07:26.472 --> 07:34.617
And I’m sure he must have written some book or he must have said that to maintain purity what we should do.

07:42.558 --> 07:46.810
All that code is the same what we follow in India.

07:50.580 --> 07:55.839
And the Orthodox Church didn’t believe in conversion. We also didn’t believe in conversion.

08:02.050 --> 08:10.109
This is the connection which took place in the existence of your Orthodox Church.

08:15.331 --> 08:19.932
And they respect, respected, all the religions.

08:25.556 --> 08:41.629
Now, I don’t know what are the changes. But whatever they have been saying and doing, is very met on Indian culture.

08:50.003 --> 09:02.363
I think also they got this sannyasi or the renunciation from Buddhism.

09:09.749 --> 09:12.719
There’s a very little difference I find.

09:15.654 --> 09:19.215
But then the Western culture came in

09:22.212 --> 09:24.522
and everything went upside down.

09:27.550 --> 09:33.198
Moreover, even in India we had the same problem.

09:36.937 --> 09:41.666
The gods they had is the same as we have in India.

09:46.456 --> 09:53.082
But the gods, they made them human beings, you see, with lots of weaknesses.

09:59.509 --> 10:05.338
But India, in India we don’t think that way. Gods are gods.

10:09.510 --> 10:14.046
So, this is the basis on which you are here.

10:17.074 --> 10:21.688
It’s easier for Me to talk to you than to talk to English.

10:26.756 --> 10:34.181
Now this power existed in the triangular bone and is called as Kundalini.

10:39.434 --> 10:41.917
It is in three and a half coils.

10:44.822 --> 10:58.255
And when it rises, it passes through six centers and pierces through the last centre, which we call as Brahmarandra.

11:08.483 --> 11:13.233
This is the actualization of your baptism, actualization.

11:17.188 --> 11:24.089
It is not just somebody can say, “Now, I bless you.” It’s not like that. You have to have spiritual authority.

11:32.092 --> 11:37.217
And now it is happening everywhere.

11:41.018 --> 11:50.877
Somehow it is spreading very fast and I think now we have about, they say so, seventy-two nations where we have Sahaja Yoga.

11:57.860 --> 12:06.000
So, when she rises, she nourishes all the centers. She nourishes all the centers

12:12.798 --> 12:15.071
and integrates them.

12:17.419 --> 12:22.408
When they are integrated you become a personality of integration.

12:27.692 --> 12:31.837
But by that your Spirit is enlightened.

12:35.607 --> 12:38.108
And you become the Spirit.

12:40.209 --> 12:52.777
So, the truth is, we are not this body, this mind, these emotions, your thoughts, ambitions, but you are the pure Spirit.

13:03.159 --> 13:05.517
That you have to become.

13:08.205 --> 13:16.170
As soon as you become the Spirit, all these problems, human problems, drop out.

13:21.886 --> 13:26.253
Physically you get perfect health.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.902
Mentally you get absolutely balanced,

13:38.258 --> 13:44.559
and emotionally you are absolutely satisfied.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.064
You become a saint

13:51.640 --> 13:53.931
in the real sense of the word.

13:56.310 --> 14:04.038
But what you feel is the, in your hands, you see, you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

14:09.785 --> 14:17.717
There’s another thing great that you believe in the Mother, Holy Mother.

14:22.136 --> 14:26.090
But in the Bible, she is just described as woman.

14:29.767 --> 14:34.870
But on the cross Christ said, “Behold the Mother.”

14:39.072 --> 14:47.800
But due to the human feeling and human understanding, you have Madonna.

14:53.084 --> 14:57.118
Especially Orthodox Church respects Madonna very much.

15:03.329 --> 15:12.140
The only maybe difference is that in Indian philosophy you have to achieve your Self-realization.

15:18.814 --> 15:21.887
That part should have been stressed.

15:24.994 --> 15:31.788
And you should get the actualization, actualization of your baptism.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.290
You have to be born again.

15:40.268 --> 15:48.208
But if you just, say, take a sort of a certificate, “I’m born again,” you don’t become it.

15:54.264 --> 15:57.064
It has to happen really

15:59.567 --> 16:04.688
that you are born again as a Self-realized personality.

16:08.365 --> 16:11.325
Now the time has come for it

16:13.828 --> 16:18.256
and it is working out in so many countries. Why not in Greece?

16:23.540 --> 16:28.054
All this is very simple.

16:30.865 --> 16:33.644
We call it "sahaja", meaning spontaneous,

16:36.518 --> 16:45.789
like one candle, one candle, which is enlightened, can enlighten many candles.

16:51.413 --> 16:57.061
But, by itself the candle cannot get enlightened.

17:01.758 --> 17:05.518
If you are enlightened then you can enlighten others.

17:09.349 --> 17:15.725
You can also then start feeling the others on your fingertips

17:20.453 --> 17:27.477
because your attention and your personality becomes collective.

17:33.688 --> 17:36.150
Who is the other?

17:38.004 --> 17:43.102
But this has to happen, this has to work out.

17:47.768 --> 17:57.149
Everyone is endowed with a Kundalini and everyone can get Self-realization.

18:02.866 --> 18:07.303
But Kundalini is the pure desire

18:10.609 --> 18:17.655
and if you have the pure desire to become the Spirit, you will get it.

18:22.970 --> 18:26.049
All desires are impure.

18:28.428 --> 18:33.171
Today, you want to have a car and you are not satisfied.

18:33.171 --> 18:38.672
And you want to have a house; you are not satisfied. It goes on like this, you see, it’s economics.

18:50.136 --> 18:52.866
So, there is no satisfaction.

18:55.153 --> 19:02.025
But after you get your Realization then the satisfaction settles in,

19:08.266 --> 19:12.528
because you become thoughtlessly aware,

19:17.287 --> 19:19.635
because you become a witness.

19:21.396 --> 19:24.000
You just watch, you don’t react.

19:26.287 --> 19:30.000
For example, see, there’s a beautiful carpet here.

19:33.399 --> 19:41.105
As a normal human being, I’ll think, “Oh, my God, this’ a nice carpet. Where will I find it? How much will I pay?”

19:48.212 --> 19:51.394
And if it is mine, I’ll be more worried

19:53.866 --> 19:58.476
that, "This should not get spoilt. I’ll get insured or something".

20:02.895 --> 20:10.371
But if I am a Self-realized person, then I’ll just watch it

20:13.275 --> 20:14.879
and don’t react.

20:16.949 --> 20:24.104
The beauty that the artist has put in it gives such joy!

20:28.831 --> 20:32.900
So, you become full of joy.

20:35.805 --> 20:41.963
Your attention becomes enlightened, attention.

20:45.949 --> 20:49.339
Wherever you pay attention, it works out.

20:52.862 --> 20:55.665
All your problems are solved.

20:57.426 --> 21:01.230
Very surprisingly how they are solved so easily!

21:05.247 --> 21:10.399
And you get rid of your worries, all your problems.

21:14.540 --> 21:25.448
Also, other bad enemies we have, like anger, jealousy and all that, six of them,

21:33.574 --> 21:35.700
they all drop out.

21:37.739 --> 21:40.962
You start laughing at yourself

21:43.588 --> 21:48.836
and nothing but compassion and love flows from your heart.

21:53.316 --> 21:56.583
This is what exactly happens to you.

21:59.373 --> 22:07.311
And when that happens you really enjoy yourself and you enjoy others.

22:14.410 --> 22:17.666
You are so much filled with joy

22:20.540 --> 22:29.010
that you become enthralled with it. You become enthralled.

22:35.715 --> 22:40.480
I mean, we have now people from all over the world, also sitting here.

22:44.929 --> 22:47.433
Some have come even from Australia.

22:50.276 --> 22:57.884
But they are so much one with each other as if a drop has become the sea, ocean.

23:04.913 --> 23:07.399
It has to happen.

23:09.098 --> 23:12.412
We talk of peace; we talk of this and that.

23:12.412 --> 23:15.202
By talking is not going to work out.

23:19.558 --> 23:31.179
Only when we cross the limits of our human personality and become one with each other, automatically the peace comes in.

23:40.140 --> 23:43.928
This is what one has to achieve.

23:46.802 --> 23:55.488
No arguments, no payments, nothing needed, only this Kundalini has to rise.

24:01.761 --> 24:06.548
It is the living process of your evolution.

24:10.164 --> 24:17.445
From this human awareness you have to rise to a collective awareness.

24:23.099 --> 24:30.348
I must say, this subject is very much deep and very expansive.

24:35.045 --> 24:39.935
I must have given thousands of lectures in my life time.

24:42.778 --> 24:49.789
But in short one has to know,  why are we here?

24:53.682 --> 24:55.631
What do we have to achieve?

24:58.876 --> 25:05.539
And once you know what you have achieved, all your problems, all your questions have vanished.

25:12.337 --> 25:16.199
So, we have to have our Self-realization.

25:18.918 --> 25:22.429
Everyone has said that you are to be born again

25:25.396 --> 25:31.688
but you cannot just certify yourself, “I’m born again”.

25:37.003 --> 25:50.652
Because there are powers that are bestowed upon you by Kundalini that you start feeling the All-pervading Power of divine love.

26:00.872 --> 26:04.281
It’s not falsehood; it’s truth.

26:07.866 --> 26:15.652
And that surprises you that how you have suddenly transformed yourself.

26:21.616 --> 26:25.690
We don’t believe in conversion but in resurrection

26:28.625 --> 26:31.676
and the time has come for you to get it.

26:35.794 --> 26:39.562
So, it will take hardly ten minutes for you to get this.

26:44.815 --> 26:49.315
There’s nothing that can be harmful in it.

26:52.158 --> 26:57.354
All kinds of diseases have been cured,

27:00.135 --> 27:05.239
all kinds of mentally affected people are cured

27:09.565 --> 27:17.312
and also emotionally people are now so much detached.

27:23.275 --> 27:31.097
You don’t have to wear these saffron clothes, nothing. It automatically happens inside

27:36.257 --> 27:40.913
and you lead a very, very normal life.

27:48.854 --> 27:58.248
Now I’ve got great grandchildren. Great grandchildren I have got.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.871
And now I am seventy-seven

28:08.714 --> 28:11.577
and I’m travelling everywhere,

28:12.535 --> 28:14.111
going everywhere.

28:15.656 --> 28:21.301
So, you lead a normal life but inside you are peaceful and joyous

28:27.234 --> 28:29.502
and you give joy to others.

28:31.140 --> 28:34.092
That is the need of the day.

28:35.823 --> 28:39.397
Because this is the Last Judgement.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.460
Whether you take to falsehood or to truth, it’s your choice.

28:51.403 --> 29:00.122
But if you take to truth then you are in the heaven of joy.

29:05.251 --> 29:09.977
And at every moment you’ll feel you are blessed.

29:12.912 --> 29:21.245
Unless and until you are connected to the Divine, how can you get the blessings?

29:24.891 --> 29:29.116
You can go on praying, doing everything; you are not connected.

29:31.371 --> 29:37.105
Supposing this instrument is not connected to the mains, it is useless.

29:43.594 --> 29:51.425
In the same way if you are not connected to the Divine you don’t know anything.

29:57.080 --> 30:03.211
So, you have to decide, “Would you like to have your Self-realization or not?”

30:08.989 --> 30:12.866
If you don’t want to have, nobody can force you.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.486
You cannot pay for it,

30:18.722 --> 30:28.713
nothing of the kind. So those who don’t want should leave the hall. Then we’ll have the session for ten minutes.

30:39.584 --> 30:51.088
Of course, in the beginning you’ll do feel the cool breeze and everything, no doubt, but sometimes people take little time to mature.

31:00.451 --> 31:05.561
Also, the bad habits of destruction all fall off.

31:12.309 --> 31:20.725
I’ve seen young people giving up drugs overnight, overnight.

31:26.564 --> 31:32.776
That’s it. So, this is for our complete emancipation.

31:41.026 --> 31:50.317
Again, I would say, those who don’t want to have Self-realization can leave and nothing can happen to you,

31:50.317 --> 31:58.305
nothing that is disturbing or in any way physically harming. Nothing can happen.

31:58.305 --> 32:00.372
But only thing, you'll get your Self-realization.
