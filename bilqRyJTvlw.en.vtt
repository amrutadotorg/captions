00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:10.933
We harm ourselves more than anybody else can sometimes.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.934
One friend of mine I knew,

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:21.253
she was from very childhood she was
like that, always crying for everything.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.052
Always she used to cry

00:00:23.132 --> 00:00:26.116
for nothing at all because she was such a spoiled child

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:29.286
that she used to always cry.

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.987
Now, was surprised to see at a
very young age she became blind.

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:35.434
I said, "How did you become so blind?"

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:39.353
She had to use a very thick glass and all that.

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:42.567
She said, "I used to cry so much, you remember."

00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:44.753
I said, "That I remember,

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:48.186
but did you cry even after school?"

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.386
"Yes, I was always crying like this."

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:55.586
So it's a kind of a personality you develop

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:59.219
that "I'm like that, I just cry."

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.753
But why not develop a personality
that, "I am always in joy?"

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:06.353
Anything I see, I feel joyous.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:10.132
Anything I hear, I feel joy.

00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:16.566
Then this lotus of your fragrance will improve

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:26.753
and then activity of your wisdom will be

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:34.232
that you will take all that is very beautiful

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.753
easily.

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:42.820
You'll get all that is very satisfying, very joyous.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.686
It's kind of an activity of this wisdom within you

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:53.353
which just leads you to people who are extremely nice,

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:55.853
to situations which are very beautiful

00:01:55.933 --> 00:02:00.067
where you discover nice things

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:16.753
or to such beautiful creations

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:20.433
that you would never expect to see.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:28.527
It's very, very important to understand that you tell Me,

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:31.867
"Mother, that this miracle happened, that miracle happened."

00:02:31.947 --> 00:02:35.353
Is nothing, is your own wisdom,

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:40.333
your own Spirit is working it out.

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:43.586
You don't have to do anything.

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:46.820
Only thing you have to remember that you are a Sahaja Yogini

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.253
and your character should be that of a Sahaja Yogini,

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:56.353
that your ideas should be that of a Sahaja Yogini.

00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:58.887
Same with Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:58.967 --> 00:03:06.152
Sahaja Yogis, being men, they don't show much,

00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:10.633
but there are certain other ways of showing his temper.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.486
They get into tempers and
sometimes the tempers are so much that

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:20.386
you just start looking, "What's the matter with the person?"

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:23.253
One side the tempers, another side the crying.

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:27.266
I mean, in between, what remains? I don't know.

00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:32.466
Both things are absolutely not needed.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.019
You have to correct people, to say things.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.887
Just now I had to say something. I've said it, finished.

00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:45.533
But it's not anger. It just - I have to act.

00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:49.419
The difference is like this - I'm not involved with it.

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:53.953
Even if I cry, I'm not involved. I'm just crying.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:57.486
Even if I am angry, I am not really angry.

00:03:57.566 --> 00:04:02.466
I am just trying to be angry in an acting.

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:06.433
That's what happens.

00:04:07.232 --> 00:04:09.486
You do not get involved into it.

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:12.152
But if you get involved into your anger,

00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:15.566
then the joy is finished, completely finished.

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.419
Some people think also that

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:25.453
if you are joyous you have to be very serious.

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:29.987
Not at all. What is there to be serious?
What is to be serious in this world?

00:04:30.067 --> 00:04:32.586
Everything is stupidity.

00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:35.686
I don't find anything serious in this world.

00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:39.666
And I can't keep serious for more than three minutes.

00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:43.686
Sometimes people take advantage of that, but what can I do?

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:44.887
That's My nature.

00:04:44.967 --> 00:04:47.820
What's so serious? You don't have to create sun.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.033
You don't have to create moon.
You don't have to create Mother Earth.

00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:57.486
What's so serious? What great jobs have you to do?

00:04:57.566 --> 00:05:03.067
Everything is there for you. Just enjoy.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.887
What is there to be so serious?

00:05:05.967 --> 00:05:10.933
Some people, you know, try to
impress also by their seriousness.

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:16.686
Once I saw a lady standing, very seriously thinking.

00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:19.019
I said, "What is the problem?"

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.620
"I don't know how to broom
this thing, I don't have a broom."

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.453
I said, "Such a big problem is
there as if the heavens are falling.

00:05:26.533 --> 00:05:28.987
Doesn't matter today you don't do it.

00:05:29.067 --> 00:05:32.620
You can do it tomorrow. What is so important?"

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.586
I mean if you don't have something, it's all right.

00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:38.786
"No, no, no, I must do it. You see, I'm very house-proud."

00:05:38.866 --> 00:05:43.067
I said, "That's the main problem which is serious."

00:05:44.299 --> 00:05:48.633
So because you suffer from some serious, stupid problems,

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:52.786
that's why you become serious.

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:54.686
And, by becoming serious, if you think

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:57.453
your problems will be solved, they will not.

00:05:57.533 --> 00:06:01.620
At the same time, I must tell
you we should not be frivolous.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.386
We should not be vulgar and not frivolous.

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:09.186
That's not - see these flowers.

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:12.286
Look at them. They are shaking with My vibrations.

00:06:12.366 --> 00:06:15.253
But look at them, in their own dignity.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:18.853
They're going to die tomorrow. They are not bothered

00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:23.186
as long as they are all right there in their own place,

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:27.499
giving you pleasure and happiness, finished.

00:06:28.967 --> 00:06:31.186
What is the use of a light?

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:35.166
Let us see, as a light, as we are. To give the light.

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:41.086
So, we are here to give joy, happiness to everyone,

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:43.987
to make everyone happy.

00:06:44.067 --> 00:06:48.900
There are so many ways of making others happy.

00:06:49.666 --> 00:06:52.253
And for that, we have to learn also.

00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:56.152
So many things we have to learn, how to make others happy.

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:58.553
And then when you make them happy,

00:06:58.633 --> 00:07:01.987
then you feel that joy within yourself.

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:05.486
"Oh, they're so happy." See their happiness,

00:07:05.566 --> 00:07:08.887
then only this lotus opens out much more.

00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:14.820
Like a ripple moves and moves

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.186
to the end of the shores

00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:25.166
and then from the shore it returns back.

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:31.019
In the same way, when your joy reaches the joy of others,

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:37.286
then the ripples that come up
make a beautiful pattern of your life.

00:07:37.366 --> 00:07:39.419
Just think of such situations

00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:42.686
where you did something good to others,

00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:45.953
being very nice to others

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:49.152
and then you found the joy in that person

00:07:49.232 --> 00:07:52.586
and how that joy came back to you.

00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:57.620
Think of that pattern that
you felt so subtlety in your life,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.953
how it is built in.

00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:02.486
Whenever you think of that time or that moment

00:08:02.566 --> 00:08:09.132
or that area, whole picture comes to you

00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:17.620
and you think, "What a time!"

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.152
But that time is eternally within you,

00:08:21.232 --> 00:08:26.987
all the time and that's why is Diwali so important.

00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:30.286
You are all, as I said, you are My light.

00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:34.953
And the light is there which is an eternal light.

00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:37.186
These lights will be finished.

00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:40.253
We'll have to light them every year. Not you people.

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:46.820
You have eternal light and
this light is going to spread Joy.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.953
What's the problem of this world?

00:08:49.033 --> 00:08:51.820
The whole problem, you take it.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.132
There's no joy.

00:08:55.967 --> 00:08:59.766
Simple as that, there's no joy.

00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:04.034
If they had joy they would not have
done all these nonsensical things.

00:09:04.114 --> 00:09:07.114
There's no Joy. When you have joy, you don't want to fight,

00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:09.953
you don't want to do anything that is harmful.

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:12.453
You don't want to say anything harsh to anyone,

00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:15.653
not only that but you do not want to have

00:09:15.733 --> 00:09:19.353
something that will spoil this Mother Earth

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:21.586
or which will bring ecological problem.

00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:23.486
No, you just don't want it,

00:09:23.566 --> 00:09:27.232
don't want to do anything because it harms others.

00:09:29.033 --> 00:09:34.266
People feel unhappy about it
whether it is here, India, anywhere.

00:09:35.733 --> 00:09:39.553
You just feel that "Why should I do such a thing

00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:42.987
which is not so congenial to others?"

00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:47.219
I mean, it's not joy-giving.

00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:50.753
So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving

00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:52.820
and if you are not joy-giving

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.953
that means there's something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:59.353
and that's why we have to come up now.

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:04.433
We have to become Sahaja Yoginis and Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:05.099 --> 00:10:08.386
That is joy-giving society.

00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:10.167
We can change our name, if you like.

00:10:10.247 --> 00:10:16.781
If Sahaja Yoga is not good - Joy Giving Association.
