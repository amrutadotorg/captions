1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.200
I must thank Australian collectivity and all the other countries which are here.

2
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.280
How beautifully they have organized the whole thing.

3
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.000
They didn’t waste any time with all these programs, you see.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They…. You don’t know what I must be feeling

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.120
when I see all these countries which I have visited before,

6
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.360
and I know most of you very well.

7
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.960
The way the whole joy and happiness that you have received

8
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.280
through your spiritual awakening, in the light of your spirit,

9
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:07.320
it’s very evident and very beautifully ringing like waves, and waves.

10
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.400
It is Sahaja Yoga’s dreams which I had,

11
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.640
it’s more than fulfilled, I can tell you.

12
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:24.880
I couldn’t understand that how – right from Australia,

13
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:38.840
then Japan, then Taiwan and Vietnam, all these countries

14
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.840
plus the greatest of all is, I would say, people from Malaysia –

15
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:58.320
that we have been able to organize this spontaneously so beautifully.

16
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.480
Somehow or other it has worked out, that’s all I can say.

17
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:11.160
China – I never expected Chinese to come and sing these songs;

18
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.480
it’s very surprising.

19
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.080
They sang so well.

20
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.080
I have been to China, I have never heard such nice songs there;

21
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.880
I mean, they were very rudimentary in the beginning I’ve felt,

22
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:33.200
but this time you find them really understanding what is being sung.

23
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.960
So we have people from all over the Eastern side,

24
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.480
and also others have joined you.

25
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.480
Now this qawwali has completely, you see,

26
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.440
made My body vibrate with the same speed they were singing,

27
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.280
and I didn’t know what to do now.

28
00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:04.480
So this is what is love, and with this love we just get immersed.

29
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.960
This ecstasy that you were getting into was just nothing

30
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:30.440
but is the bubbling of love.

31
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:38.680
I’m still trying to see how this great assemblage of different culture,

32
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.600
religion and nationalities which always bound us to limitations;

33
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.280
and how suddenly you find so beautifully here, of all the places –

34
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.880
I mean I’m surprised – Iranians, because Iran, you know, is in a great trouble.

35
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.920
My attention is very much there

36
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.320
and I can’t understand what’s gone wrong with them,

37
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.000
I really can’t understand.

38
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.920
I would have gone to Iran Myself,

39
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.400
but now such a thing has happened that I can’t go.

40
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.080
No use going like that.

41
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.640
But things will work out, you will see.

42
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.160
It will work out and the country will change.

43
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.600
Its all nonsense will be over.

44
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.800
As it is they are suffering too much.

45
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.520
They are very poor and fundamentalism, it is eating them off.

46
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.000
They are all fighting among themselves.

47
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.080
This is no religion, this is no Islam,

48
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.480
this is not what Mohammed Sahib wanted.

49
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.040
It is very difficult to explain to them or to tell them about Islam,

50
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.680
that this is Islam, and this is what is the truth.

51
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.560
There’s one boy, he’s an actor, he’s a Sahaja yogi.

52
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.480
His name is Javed Khan.

53
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.560
He’s a very well-studied, Koran he studied very well,

54
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.920
and he has brought out all the points which are absolutely similar to Sahaja Yoga.

55
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.840
He sent it to Me, he’s very brave.

56
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.240
I told him, “Should I write your name?”

57
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.960
He said, “Yes, what will happen?”

58
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.200
He is a, he has a black belt,

59
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.120
and there are twenty-five Muslim boys in India whom he has got it with black belts.

60
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.360
So he said, “If anybody comes to meet me I can beat them.”

61
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.040
I said, “You are not to beat them.”

62
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.720
“No, no, Mother, just few hands here and there, and they’ll be on the…”

63
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.880
Such a nice boy and very brave, very brave.

64
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.240
He’s not afraid, and he’s living among Muslims only.

65
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.800
So I told him, “Be careful.”

66
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.560
He said, “What is there? They have to be careful about me,

67
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.920
I am standing on the truth.”

68
00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.200
I was so happy to hear these words from this young man,

69
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:09.760
who has read Koran very carefully.

70
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:21.920
So we can say now that it’s not in different nations we have to think,

71
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.480
but we have to think that we are belonging to one world of divinity,

72
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.280
and there you are absolutely protected.

73
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.400
In Russia when I went there they had a coup.

74
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.520
And in the coup everybody would be, I mean, upset.

75
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.880
So I asked them, asked Russians,

76
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.360
I said, “Aren’t you afraid of what is happening in your country?”

77
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:58.120
They said, “Why? We don’t belong to this country, we belong to God’s country.

78
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.000
We don’t belong to this. We have nothing to do with this country.”

79
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.400
Just imagine.

80
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.160
But the depth of Russians, I don’t know from where they have got it:

81
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.080
very introspective and very deep people, I was amazed.

82
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.240
And the good news is about, they had a medical conference

83
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.400
in which one lady brought a note from the patriarch,

84
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.160
means the head of their church, of the Orthodox church,

85
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.800
saying that “Sahaja Yoga is not a cult, and it is part of us.”

86
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.080
So no danger of now –

87
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.200
we were thinking that one day Sahaja Yoga will be banned in Russia.

88
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.000
It cannot, because we have thousands and thousands of people.

89
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.240
But this is the revelation we had by that lady, and I was very happy about it.

90
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:58.880
And American Congress of, you can say, the parliament of America

91
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.480
has sent a very beautiful certificate for Me.

92
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.240
So all these things are coming from all the sides.

93
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:16.440
And I think even Ayatollah Rouhani, he has said very clearly that

94
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.640
“In Islam there are only two ways of knowing the knowledge:

95
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.760
one is by studying, and another by becoming the Self.

96
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.160
Self-knowledge is the only way and this work is done by Mataji,

97
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.040
She is doing the work of Islam.”

98
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:40.160
Can you imagine? He’s supposed to be the head of the Shiite people.

99
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.960
So though Iran is full of Shiite, their government seems to be stupid still,

100
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.000
and doesn’t want to see the point.

101
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.040
What has happened in Kabula or anything,

102
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.520
still they are crying about it – it’s over now.

103
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.600
Now a new age has started and I hope the Muslims will understand.

104
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.120
I heard also that in London Zafar has arranged some program with some Muslims,

105
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.480
so I would like to see him tomorrow for how are they behaving.

106
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.000
I mean, they can’t kill Me, they can’t have fatwa on Me,

107
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.200
that’s what they said: only the Muslims get the fatwa.

108
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.560
So I’m safe, doesn’t matter.

109
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.760
Now this is very important,

110
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.960
because that is one area where so many are still very blind.

111
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:32.760
And I’m only worried, all of them going to go to hell or what,

112
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.080
in the nonsensical idea of jihad and this and that.

113
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.280
Let us see, it’s a turning point – maybe they will learn it.

114
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.200
See, in India most of the Muslims are not even educated.

115
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:52.920
They are so poor, so uneducated; now how to talk to them I don’t understand.

116
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.920
But this young generation like Javed who have come up now,

117
00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:04.200
they are understanding what Islam has done to them is not what Islam is.

118
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:11.400
And they are now standing there nicely, built up with black belts,

119
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.360
to fight all kinds of nonsensical ideas.

120
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.040
That – I have got that letter,

121
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.200
and I would like to take copy and give it to all the leaders

122
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.600
to see what he has discussed about Islam, so clearly he has said it.

123
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.600
It’s only three or four pages I think, four or five pages.

124
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.280
But we’ll make copy of that and give it to you.

125
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.400
We have to worry about them. They are your own.

126
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.520
They are created by the same God or is created by the same Adi Shakti,

127
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.920
so they are your own; but they are getting destroyed.

128
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:54.000
So we have to see that we really do something just to make them awakened,

129
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.080
or tell them.

130
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.600
I’ve been doing it, you see, on My own the way,

131
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.440
but you all can talk to your friends who are Muslims and go round,

132
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.840
and you can use this Javed’s knowledge very well for that.

133
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:18.440
Today’s program was mixed with so many things, you know,

134
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:25.320
and the dances they had from these ladies from Bangkok, you know –

135
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:31.080
I have never seen such nice dances, never, and I’ve enjoyed them very much.

136
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.600
But the raga was Indian both times I saw, it was rag was Indian,

137
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.920
and also the tala was Indian and they were dancing,

138
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:48.720
I mean like we can say the angels coming on this earth to dance.

139
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.320
Imagine, this place I’ve been there,

140
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.520
and I never expected they’re so artistic, very artistic people.

141
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.800
And art is something is the blessing of God that you all have got it,

142
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.160
and I’m very happy about it.

143
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:14.160
Try to develop your artistic talents also to balance, balance the right side.

144
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.520
Right side is too much, that’s no good. So artistic talents will help you.

145
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.680
Also the way you enjoyed music shows that you all are blessed

146
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.840
with the appreciation of music.

147
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:38.240
I also feel that Sahaja yogis should have all kinds of talents which are artistic

148
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:44.120
and they should get those talents, only not in music – art, dancing, in every way.

149
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:50.760
All these, you see, things are so encouraging to others

150
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.800
that they also want to do the same what you are doing, you see.

151
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.080
But for qawwali I must say you are masters now, really.

152
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:04.200
One qawwal has died already and now I see other qawwals coming up very well,

153
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.840
and young ones – so, so much impressive, so much.

154
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:18.880
And this mood should remain forever with us.

155
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.600
Have I missed any country? All right.

156
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:30.680
Now, another attention has to be paid to America.

157
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:36.280
Americans are very childish people, I must say. They are not grown up.

158
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:42.840
Very childish, and they also require attention from you.

159
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.200
Because now you are becoming global. So you have to pay attention to them also,

160
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:55.280
not Australia or say Taiwan, but to the people who are lacking in Sahaja Yoga,

161
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.200
you have to attend to them.

162
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.840
For Americans I think music is the way we can approach America very well,

163
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.920
if we can sing well and dance well.

164
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.080
About dancing I must say you all are in ecstasy,

165
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.560
so there’s no rhythm needed, nothing needed, you are in ecstasy.

166
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:26.320
But still it’s better to learn steps. I must say Hamid is great for that.

167
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.760
He’s so light-footed, I’m amazed at him; he’s very light-footed.

168
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.400
So you have to learn from him how to dance, he’s very good,

169
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.680
and I think we’ll have more people who will teach you how to dance.

170
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:44.480
But ecstasy dance is different. But otherwise we can have classical dancing,

171
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.640
and you must have seen in India they play legim with such a light foot, you see,

172
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:58.800
and that’s the blessing, such a big blessing for people to express themselves.

173
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.640
I mean, Sahaja Yoga has spread in every sphere

174
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.280
and there are many people who have come.

175
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:11.280
I would say that we got a very famous man called as Klaus Nobel.

176
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.160
But his son is another remarkable one.

177
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:20.120
I was amazed the way he took to Me, took to Sahaja Yoga.

178
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:26.120
When I came to Berkeley he was standing at the airport near the gate,

179
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.480
and with a flower.

180
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.200
As soon as he saw Me he was just stunned.

181
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.440
He didn’t give Me flowers, nothing, just stunned.

182
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.880
For two minutes he didn’t know what he was doing – so deep he is.

183
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.400
Spoke very well, and he is organizing many things.

184
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.760
He’s a very nice young person we have got now with us.

185
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.360
Now I think America’s stupidity is going to finish

186
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.240
and they are going to take to Sahaja Yoga,

187
00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:02.960
because all these stupid and what you can call those false gurus are no more.

188
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.040
There’s one or two left but they’ll also disappear very soon.

189
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:13.200
They are using My lectures, they are using My book to impress people.

190
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.560
But to give realization they are not there.

191
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:24.320
This is how this life is changing very slowly, beautifully

192
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.480
and it will come to its maturity very soon I am sure,

193
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.440
that people will accept officially Sahaja Yoga.

194
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:43.480
It’s difficult; very difficult it was when I started it, but now I think they have to.

195
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.480
I was surprised the way they praised Diana for this – her death, you know.

196
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:55.120
Of course I felt bad also that she should have death; but she had no maryadas.

197
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.720
She was a born-realized.

198
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.480
I told people she is a born-realized, and that’s why the compassion, you know,

199
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.120
she couldn’t help it – used to meet people, talk to them, do them.

200
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:09.320
But it is England; because England is the heart

201
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.080
and anything happens in England – it’s such a little place like that –

202
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.840
will spread all over.

203
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.640
Let many queens die, let many kings die, this won’t happen.

204
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.720
This is because of England, from the heart,

205
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.000
and this lady was so compassionate.

206
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.640
Only thing she used to just go and meet people,

207
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.120
touch them, and funds she was raising.

208
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.880
But despite that I must say, it is England;

209
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.200
and also the media which gave her such a highlights before,

210
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.640
so now the media is into trouble because of her.

211
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.800
But this is what, how Sahaj works.

212
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:52.680
It turns things easily, and her death was also very remarkable.

213
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.440
So from Sahaj point of view the whole thing was a big drama:

214
00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:04.000
necessary, very necessary to show that any woman who is compassionate,

215
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.120
who is kind, is respected so much.

216
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:13.360
I hope now English women will change their attitude towards others;

217
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.120
because this should be a big lesson that this lady,

218
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.960
because she was so compassionate and good, that she was so much respected.

219
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.560
Then, tomorrow I can’t say these things in the puja,

220
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.000
but today I have to say that I’m thankful to you

221
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.920
that we have fifty years of independence in our country.

222
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:46.120
This is – and this fifty years of independence has been so much wasted,

223
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:53.960
because in the beginning it was constitution, beautiful constitution,

224
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.080
beautiful people, very good people.

225
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:02.760
I have seen extremely good people in India, full of idealism,

226
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:08.040
full of principles, giving everything for the country.

227
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:13.920
When I wrote this song that time we were all arrested and tortured, and this and that;

228
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.080
that time I wrote this song for the glory of the Mother.

229
00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.560
And that has happened today, because everywhere it was celebrated, and….

230
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:29.920
But I must say that our country needs, requires very much spirituality, very much.

231
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.800
It’s the source of spirituality, and it requires spirituality.

232
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:42.200
But when they see you people singing the song of Adi Shakti, they’re amazed.

233
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:48.120
They can’t understand how can you sing all these things about our country,

234
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.880
how do you know?

235
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.840
Now one great musician was there in our program, she’s very well known,

236
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.640
she and her mother.

237
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.440
And they said, “We put our head down.”

238
00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.480
I said, “Why?”

239
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.960
“Because in such a short time how can they sing so well,

240
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:07.320
with such beautiful rhythm and such beautiful swaras? They cannot.”

241
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.280
I mean, they used to think these people, they can never sing Indian songs,

242
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.840
and they were so surprised at this.

243
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:20.360
And this music has to go on. Babamama has already started the academy;

244
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.160
he has already made five huts, he says.

245
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:31.160
And his idea is to get people there to learn.

246
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.640
But he says, “In three months they become experts.

247
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:41.240
Something great about these people. Even Indian Sahaja yogis can’t do that.”

248
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.440
What you people can do, Indian Sahaja yogis cannot do.

249
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.680
That means there’s something very special.

250
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:54.120
In three months one fellow sang Rag Malkauns with Alap, … everything.

251
00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:59.360
I was wondering what has happened, how can this Englishman do all that –

252
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.800
Englishman of all the things?

253
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:08.400
My father used to tell Me that “If you want to teach Hindi to an Englishman,

254
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.600
better jump in the sea!”

255
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.120
That’s it, he had, I mean, if it was for Englishman –

256
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.080
what about others, I don’t know.

257
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:21.680
Now with all this, you see, see your talent is showing

258
00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:28.760
your spiritual advancement very much, and that’s how you must see.

259
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:34.760
John I know is really great, also Andrew, I heard you today only;

260
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.760
and you are all really very great musicians here sitting before Me.

261
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:45.160
And I respect you very much and I hope you also respect this art,

262
00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:52.360
and develop it better for the entertainment of others who are not yet such musicians.

263
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.440
But they will be one day. You know, I may have to extend the stage here!

264
00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:03.200
So that’s all right for today; tomorrow we’ll have puja at five o’clock.

265
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.120
It’s very cold now.

266
00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.440
It used to be quite hot so we thought, better have it at nine o’clock,

267
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.080
but I think we’ll have the puja at five.

268
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.480
And tomorrow I’m going to tell you really something very deep,

269
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.760
so come prepared for that. Thank you very much, thank you.

270
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:29.480
May God bless you.
