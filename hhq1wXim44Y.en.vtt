00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I must thank Australian collectivity, and all the other countries which are here,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.280
how beautifully they have organized the whole thing.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.000
They didn’t waste any time with all these programs, you see.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They -you don’t know what I must be feeling

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.120
when I see all these countries, which I have visited before,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.360
and I know most of you very well,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.960
the way the whole joy and happiness that you have received through your spiritual awakening, 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.280
in the light of your Spirit.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.840
It’s very evident and very beautifully ringing like waves, and waves.

00:01:04.943 --> 00:01:11.205
It is Sahaja Yoga’s dreams which I had,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.761
it’s more than fulfilled, I can tell you.

00:01:15.347 --> 00:01:24.587
I couldn’t understand that how, right from Australia,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:35.600
then Japan, then Taiwan and Vietnam, 

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:45.720
all these countries plus the greatest of all is, I would say, people from Malaysia,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:55.320
that we have been able to organize this spontaneously, is so beautiful.

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:03.522
Somehow or other, it has worked out, that’s all I can say.

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:11.160
China! I never expected Chinese to come and sing these songs.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.480
It’s very surprising.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.080
They sang so well.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.080
I have been to China, I have never heard such nice songs there, I mean,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.019
they were very rudimentary in the beginning, I felt.

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:33.200
But this time, you find them really understanding what is being sung.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.960
So we have people from all over the Eastern side,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.480
and also others have joined you.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.480
Now this qawwali has completely, you see,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.440
made My body vibrate with the same speed they were singing,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.280
and I didn’t know what to do now.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:04.480
So this is what is love, and in this love, we just get immersed.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.192
This ecstasy that you were getting into was just nothing but is the bubbling of love.

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:37.736
I’m still trying to see how this great assemblage of different culture, religion 

00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:45.177
and nationalities which always bound us to limitations,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.075
and how suddenly you find so beautiful it's. 

00:03:51.238 --> 00:03:59.164
Of all the places I've been, I’m surprised at Iranians. Because Iran, you know, is in a great trouble.

00:03:59.457 --> 00:04:03.497
My attention is very much there,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.348
and I can’t understand what’s gone wrong with them. Really, I can’t understand.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.920
I would have gone to Iran Myself,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.400
but now such a thing has happened that I can’t go.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.080
No use going like that.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.640
But things will work out, you will see.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.160
It will work out and the country will change.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.600
Its all nonsense will be over.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.800
As it is they are suffering too much.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.520
They are very poor and fundamentalism, it is eating them off.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.000
They are all fighting among themselves.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.080
This is no religion, this is no Islam,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.252
this is not what Mohammed Sahib wanted.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.040
It is very difficult to explain to them or to tell them about Islam that,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.680
"This is Islam, and this is what is the truth".

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.560
There’s one boy, he’s an actor, he’s a Sahaja Yogi.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.731
His name is Javed Khan.

00:05:08.894 --> 00:05:12.365
He’s a very well-studied. Koran, he studied very well,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.920
and he has brought out all the points which are absolutely similar to Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.840
He sent it to Me, he’s very brave.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.240
I told him, “Should I write your name?”

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.960
He said, “Yes, what will happen?”

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.200
He is a, he has a black belt,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.901
and there are 25 Muslim boys, in India, whom he has got it with black belts.

00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:35.360
So he said, “If anybody comes to meet me, I can beat them.”

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.040
I said, “You are not to beat them.”

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.720
“No, no, Mother, just few hands here and there, and they’ll be on the-”

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.880
Such a nice boy and very brave, very brave.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.240
He’s not afraid, and he’s living among Muslims only.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.800
So I told him, “Be careful.”

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.560
He said, “What is there? They have to be careful about me,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.920
I am standing on the truth.”

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.200
I was so happy to hear these words from this young man,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.393
who has read Koran very carefully.

00:06:09.532 --> 00:06:21.692
So we can say now that it’s not in different nations we have to think.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.480
But we have to think that we are belonging to one world of divinity,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.987
and there you are absolutely protected.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.400
In Russia, when I went there, they had a 'coup'.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.520
And in the coup everybody would be, I mean, upset.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.880
So I asked them, asked Russians,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.360
I said, “Aren’t you afraid of what is happening in your country?”

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:58.120
They said, “Why? We don’t belong to this country, we belong to God’s country.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.000
We don’t belong to this. We have nothing to do with this country.”

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.400
Just imagine!

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.160
But the depth of Russians, I don’t know from where they have got it:

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.787
very introspective and very deep people, I was amazed.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.240
And the good news is about, they had a medical conference

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.400
in which one lady brought a note from the patriarch,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.160
means the head of their church, of the Orthodox church,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.149
saying that, "Sahaja Yoga is not a cult, and it is part of us.”

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:35.080
So no danger of now.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.200
We were thinking that one day Sahaja Yoga will be banned in Russia.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.000
It cannot, because we have thousands and thousands of people.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.947
But this is the revelation we had by that lady, and I was very happy about it.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:58.880
And American Congress of, you can say, the parliament of America

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.636
has sent a very beautiful certificate for Me.

00:08:02.927 --> 00:08:06.929
So all these things are coming from all the sides.

00:08:06.929 --> 00:08:13.576
And I think even Ayatollah Rouhani, 

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:21.640
he has said very clearly that, "In Islam there are only two ways of knowing the knowledge:

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.760
one is by studying, and another by becoming the Self.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.900
Self-knowledge is the only way and this work is done by Mataji,

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.780
She is doing the work of Islam.”

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.858
Can you imagine? He’s supposed to be the head of the Shiites people.

00:08:39.476 --> 00:08:44.960
So though Iran is full of Shiite, their government seems to be stupid still,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.000
and doesn’t want to see the point.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.040
What has happened in Karbala or anything,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.250
still they are crying about it. 

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:58.307
It’s over now. Now a new age has started and I hope the Muslims will understand.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.120
I heard also that in London, Zafar has arranged some program with some Muslims,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.480
so I would like to see him tomorrow for how they're behaving.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.000
I mean, they can’t kill Me, they can’t have fatwa on Me,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.200
that’s what they said: only the Muslims get the fatwa.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.560
So I’m safe, doesn’t matter.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.760
Now this is very important,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:28.630
because that is one area where so many are still very blind.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.760
And I’m only worried, "All of them are going to go to hell or what?"

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.080
in the nonsensical idea of jihad and this and that.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.280
Let us see, it’s a turning point. Maybe they will learn it.

00:09:42.443 --> 00:09:46.786
You see, in India most of the Muslims are not even educated.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:52.790
They are so poor, so uneducated. Now how to talk to them? I don’t understand.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.278
But this young generation like Javed, who have come up now,

00:09:57.278 --> 00:10:04.200
they are understanding what Islam has done to them is not what Islam is.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:11.400
And they are now standing there, nicely, built up with black belts,

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.360
to fight all kinds of nonsensical ideas.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.040
That – I have got that letter,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.200
and I would like to take copy and give it to all the leaders

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.600
to see what he has discussed about Islam, so clearly he has said it.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.600
It’s only three or four pages I think, four or five pages.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.280
But we’ll make copy of that and give it to you.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.888
We have to worry about them. They are your own.

00:10:36.888 --> 00:10:41.520
They are created by the same God or is created by the same Adi Shakti,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.920
so they are your own. But they are getting destroyed.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:54.000
So we have to see that we really do something just to make them awakened,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.080
or tell them.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.023
I’ve been doing it, you see, on My own the way,

00:10:59.274 --> 00:11:03.114
but you all can talk to your friends who are Muslims and go round,

00:11:03.114 --> 00:11:08.514
and you can use this Javed’s knowledge very well for that.

00:11:12.128 --> 00:11:17.854
Today’s program was mixed with so many things, you know,

00:11:17.854 --> 00:11:25.320
and the dances they had from these ladies from Bangkok, you know,

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:30.564
I've never seen such nice dances, never.
And I’ve enjoyed them very much.

00:11:30.728 --> 00:11:36.861
But the raga was Indian; both times I saw, raga was Indian,

00:11:36.861 --> 00:11:41.737
and also the tala was Indian and they were dancing,

00:11:42.031 --> 00:11:48.360
I mean, like we can say, the angels coming on this earth to dance.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.240
Imagine, this place I’ve been there,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.520
and I never expected they’re so artistic, very artistic people.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.800
And art is something is the blessing of God that you all have got it,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.160
and I’m very happy about it.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:14.160
Try to develop your artistic talents also to balance, balance the right side.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.520
Right side is too much, that’s no good. So artistic talents will help you.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.680
Also the way you enjoyed music shows that you all are blessed

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.200
with the appreciation of music.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:38.240
I also feel that Sahaja Yogis should have all kinds of talents which are artistic

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:44.120
and they should get those talents, only, not in music: art, dancing, in every way.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:50.760
All these, you see, things are so encouraging to others

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.560
that they also want to do the same what you are doing, you see.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.080
But for qawwali I must say you are masters now, really.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.870
One qawwal has died already,

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.718
and now I see other qawwals coming up very well, and young ones.

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:17.370
So much impressive, so much. And this mood should remain forever with us.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.998
Have I missed any country?

00:13:21.998 --> 00:13:23.594
Switzerland, Shri Mataji. 
All right.

00:13:24.254 --> 00:13:29.536
Now, another attention has to be paid to America.

00:13:29.536 --> 00:13:36.280
Americans are very childish people, I must say. They are not grown up.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:42.840
Very childish, and they also require attention from you.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.200
Because now you are becoming global. So you have to pay attention to them also,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:55.280
not Australia or say Taiwan, but to the people who are lacking in Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.612
you have to attend to them.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.840
For Americans, I think music is the way we can approach America very well,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.920
if we can sing well and dance well.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.080
About dancing I must say you all are in ecstasy,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.972
so there’s no rhythm needed, nothing needed, you are in ecstasy.

00:14:17.972 --> 00:14:23.149
But still, it’s better to learn steps.

00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:26.288
I must say Hamid is great for that.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.760
He’s so light-footed, I’m amazed at him; he’s very light-footed.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.400
So you have to learn from him how to dance, he’s very good,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.680
and I think we’ll have more people who will teach you how to dance.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.480
But ecstasy dance is different. But otherwise, you can have classical dancing.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.640
and you must have seen in India they play legim with such a light foot, you see,

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.122
And that’s the blessing, such a big blessing for people

00:14:55.122 --> 00:14:57.689
to express themselves.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.640
I mean, Sahaja Yoga has spread in every sphere

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.280
and there are many people who have come.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:11.280
I would say that we got a very famous man called as Klaus Nobel.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.814
But his son is another remarkable one.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:20.120
I was amazed the way he took to Me, took to Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:26.120
When I came to Berkeley he was standing at the airport near the gate,

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.480
and with a flower.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.200
As soon as he saw Me, he was just stunned.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.440
He didn’t give Me flowers, nothing, just stunned.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.880
For two minutes, he didn’t know what he was doing. So deep he is.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.400
He spoke very well, and he is organizing many things.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.760
He’s a very nice young person we have got now with us.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.360
Now I think America’s stupidity is going to finish

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.469
and they are going to take to Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:55.469 --> 00:15:58.121
because all these stupid and

00:15:58.121 --> 00:16:03.058
what you can call, those false gurus, are no more.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.830
There’s one or two left but they’ll also disappear very soon.

00:16:07.419 --> 00:16:13.788
They are using My lectures, they are using My book to impress people.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.560
But to give Realization, they are not there.

00:16:19.266 --> 00:16:24.026
This is how this life is changing very slowly, beautifully

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.251
and it will come to its maturity very soon.

00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:33.865
 I am sure that people will accept officially Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:35.172 --> 00:16:40.224
It’s difficult, very difficult it was when I started it.

00:16:40.355 --> 00:16:46.551
But now I think they have to. I was surprised the way they praised Diana

00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:49.938
for this – her death, you know?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.640
Of course, I felt bad also that she should have death. But she had no maryadas.

00:16:54.957 --> 00:16:56.557
She was a born-realized.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.480
I told people she is a born-realized, and that’s why the compassion, you know,

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.120
she couldn’t help it. She used to meet people, talk to them, do them.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:09.320
But it is England; because England is the heart

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.080
and anything happens in England – it’s such a little place like that –

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.101
will spread all over.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.640
Let many queens die, let many kings die, this won’t happen.

00:17:20.509 --> 00:17:23.589
This is because of England, from the heart,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.000
and this lady was so compassionate.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.640
Only thing, she used to just go and meet people,

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.120
touch them, and funds she was raising.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.880
But despite that, I must say, it is England;

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.200
and also the media which gave her such a highlights before.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.640
So now the media is into trouble because of her.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:46.963
But this is what, how Sahaj works.

00:17:46.963 --> 00:17:52.680
It turns things easily, and her death was also very remarkable.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.440
So from Sahaj point of view, the whole thing was a big drama:

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:04.000
necessary, very necessary to show that any woman who is compassionate,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.120
who is kind, is respected so much.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:13.360
I hope now English women will change their attitude towards others;

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.120
because this should be a big lesson that this lady,

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.666
because she was so compassionate and good, that she was so much respected.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.259
Then tomorrow, I can’t say these things in the puja, but today,

00:18:28.259 --> 00:18:30.000
I have to say that I’m thankful to you

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.770
that we have fifty years of independence in our country.

00:18:37.933 --> 00:18:48.441
This is – and this fifty years of independence has been so much wasted.

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:53.960
Because in the beginning, it was constitution, beautiful constitution,

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.406
beautiful people, very good people.

00:18:57.406 --> 00:19:03.184
I have seen extremely good people in India, full of idealism,

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:08.530
full of principles, giving everything for the country.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:13.920
When I wrote this song, that time, we were all arrested and tortured, and this and that.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.080
That time, I wrote this song for the glory of the Mother.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.560
And that has happened today, because everywhere it was celebrated, and….

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:29.920
But I must say that our country needs, requires very much spirituality, very much.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.800
It’s the source of spirituality, and it requires spirituality.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:42.200
But when they see you people singing the song of Adi Shakti, they’re amazed.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:48.120
They can’t understand how can you sing all these things about our country,

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.338
how do you know?

00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:53.840
Now one great musician was there in our program, she’s very well known,

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.640
she and her mother.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.440
And they said, “We put our head down.”

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.480
I said, “Why?”

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.960
“Because in such a short time how can they sing so well,

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:07.320
with such beautiful rhythm and such beautiful swaras? They cannot!”

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.280
I mean, they used to think these people, they can never sing Indian songs,

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.840
and they were so surprised at this.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:20.360
And this music has to go on. Babamama has already started the academy.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.160
He has already made five huts, he says.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:31.389
And his idea is to get people there to learn.

00:20:31.389 --> 00:20:34.640
But he says, “In three months they become experts.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:41.240
Something great about these people. Even Indian Sahaja Yogis can’t do that.”

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.440
What you people can do, Indian Sahaja Yogis cannot do.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.680
That means there’s something very special.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:54.120
In three months, one fellow sang raga Malkauns with 'alap', this, that, everything.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:59.360
I was wondering what has happened, how can this Englishman do all that?

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.800
Englishman of all the things!

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:08.400
My father used to tell Me that, “If you want to teach Hindi to an Englishman,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.600
better jump in the sea!”

00:21:13.051 --> 00:21:15.251
That’s it, he had, I mean, 

00:21:15.251 --> 00:21:17.865
f it was for Englishman, what about others, I don’t know.

00:21:18.061 --> 00:21:20.000
Now with all this, you see,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.980
your talent is showing your spiritual advancement very much,

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.604
and that’s how you must see.

00:21:29.604 --> 00:21:34.430
John I know is really great, also Andrew, I heard you today only.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.760
And you are all really very great musicians here sitting before Me.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.885
And I respect you very much and

00:21:42.885 --> 00:21:47.121
I hope you also respect this art, and develop it better

00:21:47.317 --> 00:21:52.360
 for the entertainment of others who are not yet such musicians.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.440
But they will be one day. You know, I may have to extend the stage here!

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:04.082
So, that’s all right for today. Tomorrow we’ll have puja at five o’clock.

00:22:04.082 --> 00:22:05.120
It’s very cold now.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.440
It used to be quite hot so we thought, better have it at nine o’clock,

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.080
but I think we’ll have the puja at five.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.480
And tomorrow I’m going to tell you really something very deep,

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.760
so come prepared for that. Thank you very much, thank you.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.551
May God bless you.
