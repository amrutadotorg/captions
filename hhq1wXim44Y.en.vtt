00:00.000 --> 00:08.440
I must thank Australian collectivity

00:08.440 --> 00:11.960
and all the other countries

00:11.960 --> 00:13.440
which are here.

00:13.440 --> 00:17.200
How beautifully they have organized

00:17.200 --> 00:19.360
the whole thing.

00:19.360 --> 00:20.440
They didn’t waste any time

00:20.440 --> 00:26.800
with all these programs, you see.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.960
They....

00:29.960 --> 00:31.800
You don’t know what I must be feeling

00:31.800 --> 00:35.800
when I see all these countries

00:35.800 --> 00:37.240
which I have visited before,

00:37.240 --> 00:42.400
and I know most of you very well.

00:42.400 --> 00:48.760
The way the whole joy and happiness

00:48.760 --> 00:49.800
that you have received

00:49.800 --> 00:53.080
through your spiritual awakening,

00:53.080 --> 00:54.320
in the light of your spirit,

00:54.320 --> 00:56.520
it’s very evident

00:56.520 --> 01:00.400
and very beautifully ringing

01:00.400 --> 01:05.120
like waves, and waves.

01:05.120 --> 01:10.320
It is Sahaja Yoga’s dreams which I had,

01:10.320 --> 01:12.640
it’s more than fulfilled,

01:12.640 --> 01:15.600
I can tell you.

01:15.600 --> 01:20.080
I couldn’t understand that how –

01:20.080 --> 01:22.640
right from Australia,

01:22.640 --> 01:33.320
then Japan, then Taiwan and Vietnam,

01:33.320 --> 01:37.200
all these countries

01:37.200 --> 01:41.680
plus the greatest of all is,

01:41.680 --> 01:46.000
I would say, people from Malaysia –

01:46.000 --> 01:50.720
that we have been able to organize this

01:50.720 --> 01:56.080
spontaneously so beautifully.

01:56.080 --> 02:01.000
Somehow or other it has worked out,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.520
that’s all I can say.

02:04.520 --> 02:08.440
China – I never expected Chinese

02:08.440 --> 02:11.160
to come and sing these songs;

02:11.160 --> 02:13.520
it’s very surprising.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.440
They sang so well.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.360
I have been to China,

02:18.360 --> 02:21.240
I have never heard such nice songs there;

02:21.240 --> 02:23.080
I mean, they were very rudimentary

02:23.080 --> 02:24.880
in the beginning I’ve felt,

02:24.880 --> 02:26.760
but this time you find them

02:26.760 --> 02:28.960
really understanding

02:28.960 --> 02:30.800
what is being sung.

02:30.800 --> 02:35.880
So we have people

02:35.880 --> 02:38.920
from all over the Eastern side,

02:38.920 --> 02:44.120
and also others have joined you.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.120
Now this qawwali has completely,

02:46.120 --> 02:50.640
you see, made My body vibrate

02:50.640 --> 02:52.920
with the same speed they were singing,

02:52.920 --> 02:55.120
and I didn’t know what to do now.

02:55.120 --> 02:59.320
So this is what is love,

02:59.320 --> 03:02.160
and with this love

03:02.160 --> 03:03.840
we just get immersed.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.960
This ecstasy that you were getting into

03:07.960 --> 03:10.080
was just nothing but is

03:10.080 --> 03:13.520
the bubbling of love.

03:13.520 --> 03:22.800
I’m still trying to see

03:22.800 --> 03:32.280
how this great assemblage

03:32.280 --> 03:35.320
of different culture,

03:35.320 --> 03:41.320
religion and nationalities

03:41.320 --> 03:45.600
which always bound us to limitations;

03:45.600 --> 03:48.000
and how suddenly you find

03:48.000 --> 03:51.080
so beautifully here,

03:51.080 --> 03:52.240
of all the places –

03:52.240 --> 03:56.200
I mean I’m surprised – Iranians,

03:56.200 --> 03:57.800
because Iran, you know,

03:57.800 --> 03:59.600
is in a great trouble.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.480
My attention is very much there

04:02.480 --> 04:05.680
and I can’t understand

04:05.680 --> 04:07.240
what’s gone wrong with them,

04:07.240 --> 04:11.000
I really can’t understand.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.920
I would have gone to Iran Myself,

04:12.920 --> 04:14.800
but now such a thing has happened

04:14.800 --> 04:17.520
that I can’t go.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.040
No use going like that.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.680
But things will work out, you will see.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.520
It will work out

04:24.520 --> 04:27.720
and the country will change.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.640
Its all nonsense will be over.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.480
As it is they are suffering too much.

04:33.480 --> 04:37.160
They are very poor and fundamentalism,

04:37.160 --> 04:38.680
it is eating them off.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.920
They are all fighting among themselves.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.040
This is no religion, this is no Islam,

04:44.040 --> 04:48.480
this is not what Mohammed Sahib wanted.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.880
It is very difficult to explain to them

04:52.880 --> 04:55.920
or to tell them about Islam,

04:55.920 --> 04:58.000
that this is Islam,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.800
and this is what is the truth.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.440
There’s one boy, he’s an actor,

05:04.440 --> 05:06.720
he’s a Sahaja yogi.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.960
His name is Javed Khan.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.400
He’s a very well-studied,

05:10.400 --> 05:12.600
Koran he studied very well,

05:12.600 --> 05:14.960
and he has brought out all the points

05:14.960 --> 05:16.920
which are absolutely similar

05:16.920 --> 05:17.440
to Sahaja Yoga.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.840
He sent it to Me, he’s very brave.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.160
I told him, “Should I write your name?”

05:22.160 --> 05:24.000
He said, “Yes, what will happen?”

05:24.000 --> 05:26.200
He is a, he has a black belt,

05:26.200 --> 05:28.760
and there are twenty-five Muslim boys

05:28.760 --> 05:30.880
in India whom he has got it

05:30.880 --> 05:32.200
with black belts.

05:32.200 --> 05:32.600
So he said,

05:32.600 --> 05:34.160
“If anybody comes to meet me

05:34.160 --> 05:35.280
I can beat them.”

05:35.280 --> 05:37.280
I said, “You are not to beat them.”

05:37.280 --> 05:38.040
“No, no, Mother,

05:38.040 --> 05:39.560
just few hands here and there,

05:39.560 --> 05:40.760
and they’ll be on the...”

05:40.760 --> 05:43.720
Such a nice boy and very brave,

05:43.720 --> 05:44.400
very brave.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.520
He’s not afraid,

05:46.520 --> 05:48.720
and he’s living among Muslims only.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.800
So I told him, “Be careful.”

05:50.800 --> 05:51.600
He said, “What is there?

05:51.600 --> 05:53.560
They have to be careful about me,

05:53.560 --> 05:55.880
I am standing on the truth.”

05:55.880 --> 05:58.440
I was so happy to hear these words

05:58.440 --> 06:03.200
from this young man,

06:03.200 --> 06:09.000
who has read Koran very carefully.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.040
So we can say now

06:13.040 --> 06:17.280
that it’s not in different nations

06:17.280 --> 06:19.160
we have to think,

06:19.160 --> 06:22.160
but we have to think

06:22.160 --> 06:23.920
that we are belonging

06:23.920 --> 06:28.560
to one world of divinity,

06:28.560 --> 06:32.720
and there you are absolutely protected.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.240
In Russia when I went there

06:34.240 --> 06:36.440
they had a coup.

06:36.440 --> 06:39.280
And in the coup everybody would be,

06:39.280 --> 06:41.520
I mean, upset.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.920
So I asked them, asked Russians,

06:44.920 --> 06:47.040
I said, “Aren’t you afraid

06:47.040 --> 06:48.800
of what is happening in your country?”

06:48.800 --> 06:50.560
They said, “Why?

06:50.560 --> 06:54.400
We don’t belong to this country,

06:54.400 --> 06:59.640
we belong to God’s country.

06:59.640 --> 07:00.800
We don’t belong to this.

07:00.800 --> 07:01.640
We have nothing to do

07:01.640 --> 07:03.520
with this country.”

07:03.520 --> 07:04.640
Just imagine.

07:04.640 --> 07:05.720
But the depth of Russians,

07:05.720 --> 07:06.680
I don’t know from where

07:06.680 --> 07:07.920
they have got it:

07:07.920 --> 07:09.080
very introspective

07:09.080 --> 07:10.880
and very deep people,

07:10.880 --> 07:13.120
I was amazed.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.480
And the good news is about,

07:14.480 --> 07:17.240
they had a medical conference

07:17.240 --> 07:20.600
in which one lady brought a note

07:20.600 --> 07:22.240
from the patriarch,

07:22.240 --> 07:24.400
means the head of their church,

07:24.400 --> 07:26.160
of the Orthodox church,

07:26.160 --> 07:28.600
saying that

07:28.600 --> 07:30.240
“Sahaja Yoga is not a cult,

07:30.240 --> 07:32.840
and it is part of us.”

07:32.840 --> 07:34.880
So no danger of now –

07:34.880 --> 07:36.880
we were thinking that one day

07:36.880 --> 07:38.840
Sahaja Yoga will be banned in Russia.

07:38.840 --> 07:39.840
It cannot,

07:39.840 --> 07:41.280
because we have thousands

07:41.280 --> 07:43.200
and thousands of people.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.520
But this is the revelation

07:45.520 --> 07:48.760
we had by that lady,

07:48.760 --> 07:51.200
and I was very happy about it.

07:51.200 --> 07:55.560
And American Congress of,

07:55.560 --> 07:56.600
you can say,

07:56.600 --> 07:58.600
the parliament of America

07:58.600 --> 08:01.560
has sent a very beautiful certificate

08:01.560 --> 08:02.440
for Me.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.160
So all these things are coming

08:05.160 --> 08:06.760
from all the sides.

08:06.760 --> 08:13.520
And I think even Ayatollah Rouhani,

08:13.520 --> 08:17.440
he has said very clearly that

08:17.440 --> 08:19.320
“In Islam there are only two ways

08:19.320 --> 08:21.640
of knowing the knowledge:

08:21.640 --> 08:23.320
one is by studying,

08:23.320 --> 08:26.800
and another by becoming the Self.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.840
Self-knowledge is the only way

08:28.840 --> 08:31.200
and this work is done by Mataji,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.120
She is doing the work of Islam.”

08:33.120 --> 08:33.600
Can you imagine?

08:33.600 --> 08:36.240
He’s supposed to be the head

08:36.240 --> 08:37.760
of the Shiite people.

08:37.760 --> 08:42.640
So though Iran is full of Shiite,

08:42.640 --> 08:45.320
their government seems to be stupid still,

08:45.320 --> 08:47.320
and doesn’t want to see the point.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.080
What has happened in Kabula or anything,

08:50.080 --> 08:52.000
still they are crying about it –

08:52.000 --> 08:53.520
it’s over now.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.720
Now a new age has started

08:55.720 --> 08:58.560
and I hope the Muslims will understand.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.080
I heard also that in London

09:01.080 --> 09:03.000
Zafar has arranged some program

09:03.000 --> 09:04.160
with some Muslims,

09:04.160 --> 09:05.720
so I would like to see him tomorrow

09:05.720 --> 09:07.480
for how are they behaving.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.960
I mean, they can’t kill Me,

09:08.960 --> 09:10.960
they can’t have fatwa on Me,

09:10.960 --> 09:12.240
that’s what they said:

09:12.240 --> 09:14.040
only the Muslims get the fatwa.

09:14.040 --> 09:17.200
So I’m safe, doesn’t matter.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.080
Now this is very important,

09:19.080 --> 09:22.480
because that is one area

09:22.480 --> 09:28.720
where so many are still very blind.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.840
And I’m only worried,

09:30.840 --> 09:33.080
all of them going to go to hell or what,

09:33.080 --> 09:35.280
in the nonsensical idea of jihad

09:35.280 --> 09:37.120
and this and that.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.600
Let us see, it’s a turning point –

09:39.600 --> 09:42.440
maybe they will learn it.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.680
See, in India most of the Muslims

09:44.680 --> 09:47.280
are not even educated.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.760
They are so poor, so uneducated;

09:49.760 --> 09:51.640
now how to talk to them

09:51.640 --> 09:52.920
I don’t understand.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.680
But this young generation like Javed

09:55.680 --> 09:57.440
who have come up now,

09:57.440 --> 09:58.880
they are understanding

09:58.880 --> 10:02.120
what Islam has done to them

10:02.120 --> 10:04.680
is not what Islam is.

10:04.680 --> 10:08.440
And they are now standing there nicely,

10:08.440 --> 10:11.480
built up with black belts,

10:11.480 --> 10:15.880
to fight all kinds of nonsensical ideas.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.120
That – I have got that letter,

10:17.120 --> 10:19.120
and I would like to take copy

10:19.120 --> 10:20.800
and give it to all the leaders

10:20.800 --> 10:24.600
to see what he has discussed about Islam,

10:24.600 --> 10:26.920
so clearly he has said it.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.200
It’s only three or four pages I think,

10:28.200 --> 10:29.640
four or five pages.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.440
But we’ll make copy of that

10:31.440 --> 10:33.320
and give it to you.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.120
We have to worry about them.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.160
They are your own.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.000
They are created by the same God

10:39.000 --> 10:41.680
or is created by the same Adi Shakti,

10:41.680 --> 10:43.120
so they are your own;

10:43.120 --> 10:46.440
but they are getting destroyed.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.360
So we have to see

10:47.360 --> 10:49.920
that we really do something

10:49.920 --> 10:53.960
just to make them awakened,

10:53.960 --> 10:55.560
or tell them.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.120
I’ve been doing it, you see,

10:57.120 --> 10:58.480
on My own the way,

10:58.480 --> 11:01.160
but you all can talk to your friends

11:01.160 --> 11:04.160
who are Muslims and go round,

11:04.160 --> 11:07.200
and you can use this Javed’s knowledge

11:07.200 --> 11:09.560
very well for that.

11:09.560 --> 11:15.600
Today’s program was mixed

11:15.600 --> 11:18.080
with so many things, you know,

11:18.080 --> 11:21.840
and the dances they had

11:21.840 --> 11:24.840
from these ladies from Bangkok,

11:24.840 --> 11:25.120
you know –

11:25.120 --> 11:28.440
I have never seen such nice dances,

11:28.440 --> 11:28.800
never,

11:28.800 --> 11:30.640
and I’ve enjoyed them very much.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.840
But the raga was Indian both times I saw,

11:33.840 --> 11:37.400
it was rag was Indian,

11:37.400 --> 11:39.840
and also the tala was Indian

11:39.840 --> 11:42.000
and they were dancing,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.800
I mean like we can say the angels

11:45.800 --> 11:49.560
coming on this earth to dance.

11:49.560 --> 11:54.200
Imagine, this place I’ve been there,

11:54.200 --> 11:57.320
and I never expected they’re so artistic,

11:57.320 --> 11:59.760
very artistic people.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.400
And art is something

12:01.400 --> 12:03.280
is the blessing of God

12:03.280 --> 12:05.120
that you all have got it,

12:05.120 --> 12:07.240
and I’m very happy about it.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.200
Try to develop your artistic talents

12:10.200 --> 12:12.440
also to balance,

12:12.440 --> 12:14.880
balance the right side.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.200
Right side is too much,

12:16.200 --> 12:17.360
that’s no good.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.800
So artistic talents will help you.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.320
Also the way you enjoyed music

12:22.320 --> 12:25.720
shows that you all are blessed

12:25.720 --> 12:28.920
with the appreciation of music.

12:28.920 --> 12:33.000
I also feel that Sahaja yogis

12:33.000 --> 12:35.120
should have all kinds of talents

12:35.120 --> 12:37.160
which are artistic

12:37.160 --> 12:40.120
and they should get those talents,

12:40.120 --> 12:41.800
only not in music –

12:41.800 --> 12:45.320
art, dancing, in every way.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.320
All these, you see,

12:46.320 --> 12:50.480
things are so encouraging to others

12:50.480 --> 12:53.080
that they also want to do the same

12:53.080 --> 12:54.960
what you are doing, you see.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.360
But for qawwali I must say

12:56.360 --> 12:58.840
you are masters now, really.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.800
One qawwal has died already

13:00.800 --> 13:03.160
and now I see other qawwals

13:03.160 --> 13:04.000
coming up very well,

13:04.000 --> 13:05.720
and young ones –

13:05.720 --> 13:08.880
so, so much impressive, so much.

13:08.880 --> 13:14.280
And this mood should remain

13:14.280 --> 13:18.280
forever with us.

13:18.280 --> 13:24.400
Have I missed any country? All right.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.600
Now, another attention

13:26.600 --> 13:29.520
has to be paid to America.

13:29.520 --> 13:34.240
Americans are very childish people,

13:34.240 --> 13:34.920
I must say.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.000
They are not grown up.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.640
Very childish,

13:37.640 --> 13:43.000
and they also require attention from you.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.880
Because now you are becoming global.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.160
So you have to pay attention

13:47.160 --> 13:47.920
to them also,

13:47.920 --> 13:51.040
not Australia or say Taiwan,

13:51.040 --> 13:53.600
but to the people

13:53.600 --> 13:55.360
who are lacking in Sahaja Yoga,

13:55.360 --> 13:59.000
you have to attend to them.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.320
For Americans I think music

14:01.320 --> 14:04.240
is the way we can approach America

14:04.240 --> 14:05.280
very well,

14:05.280 --> 14:11.080
if we can sing well and dance well.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.400
About dancing I must say

14:12.400 --> 14:14.120
you all are in ecstasy,

14:14.120 --> 14:15.760
so there’s no rhythm needed,

14:15.760 --> 14:16.440
nothing needed,

14:16.440 --> 14:17.840
you are in ecstasy.

14:17.840 --> 14:23.720
But still it’s better to learn steps.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.160
I must say Hamid is great for that.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.520
He’s so light-footed,

14:27.520 --> 14:28.440
I’m amazed at him;

14:28.440 --> 14:30.880
he’s very light-footed.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.520
So you have to learn from him

14:32.520 --> 14:33.320
how to dance,

14:33.320 --> 14:34.440
he’s very good,

14:34.440 --> 14:36.040
and I think we’ll have more people

14:36.040 --> 14:38.680
who will teach you how to dance.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.440
But ecstasy dance is different.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.280
But otherwise we can have

14:43.280 --> 14:45.160
classical dancing,

14:45.160 --> 14:47.600
and you must have seen in India

14:47.600 --> 14:50.160
they play legim with such a light foot,

14:50.160 --> 14:50.720
you see,

14:50.720 --> 14:52.040
and that’s the blessing,

14:52.040 --> 14:54.680
such a big blessing for people

14:54.680 --> 14:58.800
to express themselves.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.080
I mean, Sahaja Yoga has spread

15:00.080 --> 15:01.360
in every sphere

15:01.360 --> 15:05.400
and there are many people who have come.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.320
I would say that we got

15:07.320 --> 15:10.960
a very famous man called as Klaus Nobel.

15:10.960 --> 15:15.640
But his son is another remarkable one.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.120
I was amazed the way he took to Me,

15:18.120 --> 15:20.400
took to Sahaja Yoga.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.360
When I came to Berkeley

15:22.360 --> 15:25.160
he was standing at the airport

15:25.160 --> 15:26.520
near the gate,

15:26.520 --> 15:28.440
and with a flower.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.960
As soon as he saw Me

15:29.960 --> 15:31.040
he was just stunned.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.960
He didn’t give Me flowers,

15:32.960 --> 15:34.120
nothing, just stunned.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.080
For two minutes he didn’t know

15:36.080 --> 15:37.600
what he was doing –

15:37.600 --> 15:39.000
so deep he is.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.360
Spoke very well,

15:40.360 --> 15:42.160
and he is organizing many things.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.840
He’s a very nice young person

15:45.840 --> 15:48.120
we have got now with us.

15:48.120 --> 15:52.200
Now I think America’s stupidity

15:52.200 --> 15:53.320
is going to finish

15:53.320 --> 15:54.480
and they are going to take

15:54.480 --> 15:55.200
to Sahaja Yoga,

15:55.200 --> 15:57.560
because all these stupid

15:57.560 --> 16:00.040
and what you can call

16:00.040 --> 16:02.880
those false gurus are no more.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.640
There’s one or two left

16:04.640 --> 16:07.800
but they’ll also disappear very soon.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.840
They are using My lectures,

16:09.840 --> 16:14.000
they are using My book to impress people.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.400
But to give realization

16:15.400 --> 16:17.440
they are not there.

16:17.440 --> 16:22.400
This is how this life is changing

16:22.400 --> 16:24.560
very slowly, beautifully

16:24.560 --> 16:27.320
and it will come to its maturity

16:27.320 --> 16:28.400
very soon I am sure,

16:28.400 --> 16:31.880
that people will accept

16:31.880 --> 16:35.800
officially Sahaja Yoga.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.000
It’s difficult;

16:37.000 --> 16:40.200
very difficult it was when I started it,

16:40.200 --> 16:43.000
but now I think they have to.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.520
I was surprised the way

16:45.520 --> 16:48.440
they praised Diana for this –

16:48.440 --> 16:49.680
her death, you know.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.080
Of course I felt bad also

16:51.080 --> 16:52.760
that she should have death;

16:52.760 --> 16:55.200
but she had no maryadas.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.800
She was a born-realized.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.960
I told people she is a born-realized,

16:58.960 --> 17:00.560
and that’s why the compassion, you know,

17:00.560 --> 17:01.240
she couldn’t help it –

17:01.240 --> 17:02.760
used to meet people,

17:02.760 --> 17:04.640
talk to them, do them.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.200
But it is England;

17:06.200 --> 17:09.360
because England is the heart

17:09.360 --> 17:11.040
and anything happens in England –

17:11.040 --> 17:13.520
it’s such a little place like that –

17:13.520 --> 17:14.520
will spread all over.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.000
Let many queens die,

17:17.000 --> 17:18.240
let many kings die,

17:18.240 --> 17:20.600
this won’t happen.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.480
This is because of England,

17:22.480 --> 17:23.840
from the heart,

17:23.840 --> 17:26.160
and this lady was so compassionate.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.960
Only thing she used to just go

17:27.960 --> 17:29.800
and meet people, touch them,

17:29.800 --> 17:32.040
and funds she was raising.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.320
But despite that I must say,

17:33.320 --> 17:34.960
it is England;

17:34.960 --> 17:36.280
and also the media

17:36.280 --> 17:39.200
which gave her such a highlights before,

17:39.200 --> 17:42.800
so now the media is into trouble

17:42.800 --> 17:44.120
because of her.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.360
But this is what,

17:45.360 --> 17:47.480
how Sahaj works.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.440
It turns things easily,

17:49.440 --> 17:53.200
and her death was also very remarkable.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.640
So from Sahaj point of view

17:54.640 --> 17:56.480
the whole thing was a big drama:

17:56.480 --> 18:01.280
necessary, very necessary to show

18:01.280 --> 18:04.200
that any woman who is compassionate,

18:04.200 --> 18:05.600
who is kind,

18:05.600 --> 18:07.320
is respected so much.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.600
I hope now English women

18:09.600 --> 18:11.040
will change their attitude

18:11.040 --> 18:13.800
towards others;

18:13.800 --> 18:15.000
because this should be a big lesson

18:15.000 --> 18:17.160
that this lady,

18:17.160 --> 18:18.640
because she was so compassionate

18:18.640 --> 18:19.080
and good,

18:19.080 --> 18:22.640
that she was so much respected.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.560
Then, tomorrow I can’t say

18:25.560 --> 18:26.600
these things in the puja,

18:26.600 --> 18:28.800
but today I have to say

18:28.800 --> 18:30.800
that I’m thankful to you

18:30.800 --> 18:34.040
that we have fifty years

18:34.040 --> 18:37.840
of independence in our country.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.480
This is – and this fifty years

18:40.480 --> 18:43.280
of independence

18:43.280 --> 18:48.440
has been so much wasted,

18:48.440 --> 18:50.360
because in the beginning

18:50.360 --> 18:52.760
it was constitution,

18:52.760 --> 18:54.800
beautiful constitution,

18:54.800 --> 18:58.840
beautiful people, very good people.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.360
I have seen extremely good people

19:02.360 --> 19:02.680
in India,

19:02.680 --> 19:06.520
full of idealism, full of principles,

19:06.520 --> 19:08.880
giving everything for the country.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.240
When I wrote this song

19:10.240 --> 19:12.280
that time we were all arrested

19:12.280 --> 19:14.280
and tortured, and this and that;

19:14.280 --> 19:16.360
that time I wrote this song

19:16.360 --> 19:17.640
for the glory of the Mother.

19:17.640 --> 19:20.320
And that has happened today,

19:20.320 --> 19:22.120
because everywhere it was celebrated,

19:22.120 --> 19:23.120
and....

19:23.120 --> 19:26.720
But I must say that our country needs,

19:26.720 --> 19:29.120
requires very much spirituality,

19:29.120 --> 19:29.960
very much.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.920
It’s the source of spirituality,

19:31.920 --> 19:33.320
and it requires spirituality.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.440
But when they see you people

19:35.440 --> 19:40.640
singing the song of Adi Shakti,

19:40.640 --> 19:42.200
they’re amazed.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.800
They can’t understand

19:43.800 --> 19:46.400
how can you sing all these things

19:46.400 --> 19:47.120
about our country,

19:47.120 --> 19:47.880
how do you know?

19:47.880 --> 19:51.520
Now one great musician was there

19:51.520 --> 19:52.680
in our program,

19:52.680 --> 19:53.840
she’s very well known,

19:53.840 --> 19:54.560
she and her mother.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.680
And they said,

19:55.680 --> 19:56.960
“We put our head down.”

19:56.960 --> 19:58.240
I said, “Why?”

19:58.240 --> 20:00.440
“Because in such a short time

20:00.440 --> 20:01.920
how can they sing so well,

20:01.920 --> 20:04.200
with such beautiful rhythm

20:04.200 --> 20:06.040
and such beautiful swaras?

20:06.040 --> 20:07.440
They cannot.”

20:07.440 --> 20:09.480
I mean, they used to think these people,

20:09.480 --> 20:12.320
they can never sing Indian songs,

20:12.320 --> 20:14.920
and they were so surprised at this.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.720
And this music has to go on.

20:17.720 --> 20:20.120
Babamama has already started the academy;

20:20.120 --> 20:22.240
he has already made five huts,

20:22.240 --> 20:23.400
he says.

20:23.400 --> 20:29.600
And his idea is to get people

20:29.600 --> 20:31.840
there to learn.

20:31.840 --> 20:32.400
But he says,

20:32.400 --> 20:35.760
“In three months they become experts.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.840
Something great about these people.

20:37.840 --> 20:41.680
Even Indian Sahaja yogis can’t do that.”

20:41.680 --> 20:42.400
What you people can do,

20:42.400 --> 20:44.560
Indian Sahaja yogis cannot do.

20:44.560 --> 20:47.760
That means there’s something very special.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.120
In three months one fellow

20:50.120 --> 20:53.280
sang Rag Malkauns with Alap,

20:53.280 --> 20:54.640
... everything.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.480
I was wondering what has happened,

20:56.480 --> 20:59.080
how can this Englishman do all that –

20:59.080 --> 21:02.120
Englishman of all the things?

21:02.120 --> 21:04.720
My father used to tell Me that

21:04.720 --> 21:07.080
“If you want to teach Hindi

21:07.080 --> 21:08.880
to an Englishman,

21:08.880 --> 21:10.800
better jump in the sea!”

21:10.800 --> 21:12.760
That’s it, he had,

21:12.760 --> 21:15.520
I mean, if it was for Englishman –

21:15.520 --> 21:17.920
what about others, I don’t know.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.320
Now with all this, you see,

21:19.320 --> 21:22.680
see your talent is showing

21:22.680 --> 21:26.720
your spiritual advancement very much,

21:26.720 --> 21:30.280
and that’s how you must see.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.120
John I know is really great,

21:32.120 --> 21:35.120
also Andrew, I heard you today only;

21:35.120 --> 21:36.760
and you are all really

21:36.760 --> 21:38.320
very great musicians

21:38.320 --> 21:40.280
here sitting before Me.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.000
And I respect you very much

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
and I hope you also respect this art,

21:45.000 --> 21:46.640
and develop it better

21:46.640 --> 21:49.320
for the entertainment of others

21:49.320 --> 21:52.480
who are not yet such musicians.

21:52.480 --> 21:53.400
But they will be one day.

21:53.400 --> 21:53.920
You know,

21:53.920 --> 21:57.040
I may have to extend the stage here!

21:57.040 --> 22:00.880
So that’s all right for today;

22:00.880 --> 22:02.920
tomorrow we’ll have puja at five o’clock.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.160
It’s very cold now.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.560
It used to be quite hot so we thought,

22:07.560 --> 22:10.280
better have it at nine o’clock,

22:10.280 --> 22:13.560
but I think we’ll have the puja at five.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.080
And tomorrow I’m going to tell you

22:15.080 --> 22:16.520
really something very deep,

22:16.520 --> 22:18.520
so come prepared for that.

22:18.520 --> 22:19.400
Thank you very much, thank you.

22:19.400 --> 22:29.480
May God bless you.
