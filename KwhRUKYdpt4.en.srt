1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,280
It's a great thing today that we are celebrating

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,560
the Virgin’s worship in England.

3
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,560
As you know, according to Sahaja Yoga,

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,040
England is the heart where resides the Spirit of Shiva.

5
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,480
And that Virgin should be respected and revered

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,520
and worshipped in England

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,160
is a great honor, I think, for all the Sahaja Yogis.

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:26,000
Now one has to think why such an importance is paid to a Virgin?

9
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:39,480
Why a Virgin is respected to that extent?

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,760
What are the powers of a Virgin?

11
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,120
That She can bear a child

12
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,360
of that magnitude that was Christ,

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:15,400
that She could create Shri Ganesha out of Her own body,

14
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:29,560
that She could protect innocent, dynamic force of Her children

15
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,320
who are egoless, who have not known what is ego.

16
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:57,040
So this great power and force resides

17
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:11,000
in a person who has lots of 'guru punyas' [guru virtues],

18
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,000
who has done lots of good things in previous lives,

19
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:30,080
who has always understood

20
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,680
that Virginity is a power higher than any other power and

21
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:52,800
would save the Virginity and Chastity with all Her effort and care.

22
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:07,000
As you know that within our body She is placed as Kundalini,

23
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,800
means She is the Virgin.

24
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,560
She is untouched,

25
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:28,160
the desire to become Spirit is without any blemish, "nirmala".

26
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,040
There is no blemish.

27
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,480
Its waiting is pure.

28
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:53,640
There's no other desire but to be one with the Divine.

29
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,000
All other desires are finished.

30
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:15,720
It's a very difficult subject for Me to talk about in the Western country.

31
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,720
It's embarrassing. I do not want any one of you, whether men or women,

32
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,560
to develop any guilt in your mind.

33
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,000
Because that is one thing is the greatest blemish as you know,

34
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:42,040
at a later stage this guilt works in the opposite direction.

35
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,360
It is of no help.

36
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,240
But when we understand that we have these problems,

37
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,040
we have to be humble about it. Not guilty but humble.

38
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:19,520
If you are not humble about it, and aggressive about demanding

39
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,480
what have you got out of Sahaja Yoga

40
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,000
and complaining about it all the time,

41
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:34,120
while not seeing what are your own punyas, what do you deserve?

42
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,600
Your Kundalini, despite every blemish, has been raised.

43
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,320
You know that. You are blessed.

44
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,360
So instead of complaining or being aggressive,

45
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,320
you must know that it is a great ‘favour’ to you.

46
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,800
The greatest favour; that you are forgiven completely,

47
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,000
that this great blessing has been bestowed upon you.

48
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,520
And to come up to it you have to work hard.

49
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:39,560
Not to feel guilty about it but to be humble, to be thankful.

50
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:48,360
That despite what we have done, played with ourselves completely,

51
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:03,240
still we are today sitting as God's Devas.

52
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,000
The Somrasa, which is the

53
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:21,040
Charanamruta is the water that washes the Mother,

54
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,320
only you are allowed to drink it, only the Devas.

55
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:34,320
You are sitting in that category, and how can you be demanding?

56
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,680
You have to humble yourself.

57
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,000
By seeing your past, whatever mistakes we have committed.

58
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,280
I'm with you in this. Not to feel guilty.

59
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,000
It's very embarrassing as I said to you,

60
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,640
but please try to face yourself. We have to face ourselves as we are.

61
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,720
The advantage of the Indians is that the Kundalini exists there.

62
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,720
So whatever Indians may do, they are always aware it is wrong.

63
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,160
For them virtue is virtue, whether they are not virtuous.

64
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,680
Righteousness is righteousness, whether they are not.

65
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,680
They know, all the time they are aware of it: "We are doing wrong."

66
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:40,560
They do not say: "What's wrong?" Nor do they propound things

67
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,040
which are obviously wrong and against the virginity, against the sublimity,

68
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:53,000
against the divinity. Satanic things, they never proclaim that this is God.

69
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,800
They are hypocritical, all right; but they are aware all the time

70
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,480
that these things are wrong.

71
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,720
The whole society is like that.

72
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,480
Because Kundalini stays there.

73
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,120
When we lose our innocence and our virginity, first thing happens to us

74
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:38,040
is that we become ego-oriented, and we start thinking "What's wrong?"

75
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:48,080
Your Shakti is your Kundalini and She is Virginity.

76
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:58,480
She is your power. She is your strength.

77
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,280
Your innocence is your strength, the day you lost it

78
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:15,000
that is the day we have committed the original sin.

79
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,080
So for us it is important that we have to be very humble about it,

80
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,120
and that we have to achieve something.

81
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,720
What?

82
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:43,200
Not the kingdoms and some sort of a luxurious life,

83
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:53,760
but a seat in this holy land of Shiva.

84
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,240
Shiva is forgiveness. He forgives everyone.

85
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,760
Even the rakshasas can be forgiven,

86
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,400
but can they be given Realization?

87
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,480
Even the pishachas can be forgiven,

88
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,040
but can they be given Realization? Forgiven is different point.

89
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,200
One aspect is forgiveness, so that they can remain for a longer period,

90
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,240
they may live longer, because of Shiva's forgiveness. So what?

91
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,320
But what a wretched life!

92
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,600
And the people who are not innocent can never be joy-giving.

93
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,080
They are themselves miserable creatures and make everyone miserable.

94
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:18,040
The arrogance is not a child-like quality.

95
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,360
We have to be like children.

96
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,320
And even when you were not you were given Realization all right.

97
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:44,240
But now you are sitting with the Devas, even higher than them.

98
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:53,680
So, what is our decoration? It is humility.

99
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It is simplicity. Not cleverness, arrogance,

100
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:15,760
putting others down, showing-off, but a complete surrender,

101
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,240
surrendering all your egoistical qualities.

102
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,000
Let the virginity be reborn within you.

103
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:41,200
From today you all have to take a vow, is a New Year's Day for us -

104
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:53,760
that we all will surrender our horrible tempers,

105
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,400
dominating natures, asserting behaviors,

106
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:16,280
ego-oriented harshness, domination.

107
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,800
I don't know what use it has.

108
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Unless and until you surrender that,

109
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:38,280
The Lord of virginity, Shri Ganesha, will not be able to

110
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,080
crown your Agnya Chakra.

111
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:07,600
Whatever we have done so far should just give us this:

112
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,280
if our past could give us the idea

113
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:25,160
as to how humble we have to be with each other, with all the Sahaja Yogis,

114
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:40,120
how kind we have to be, how loving, how universal.

115
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:53,120
Virgin cannot accept ideas which are not universal, She cannot!

116
00:16:53,320 --> 00:17:02,640
That's the sign of a Virgin because She is universal by nature.

117
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,200
All fanaticism, all racialism, casteism,

118
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,720
all these things which artificially separates man from man,

119
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
woman from woman, nation from nation,

120
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,200
will all finish off, as soon as you become innocent.

121
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,600
But you can't become by brain-washing, you cannot.

122
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,160
By Kundalini Awakening, of course, you can.

123
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:44,240
But to maintain it, your progress should be inward

124
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,720
and not outward, to seek your roots.

125
00:17:52,080 --> 00:18:01,000
She is the "moola". She is the roots of your being.

126
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,720
She manifests all your roots.

127
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,480
So your attention should be towards your roots

128
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,160
and not towards your shoots, you have been that.

129
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,720
Face yourself, and develop your roots now.

130
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,480
All the Western society is without the roots, we can see that.

131
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,400
We have lost our roots; let's face it as Western people,

132
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,080
as I am also with you today.

133
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,200
We have to find our roots.

134
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,000
You see, in a tree which does not have roots,

135
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,200
it dries out, it doesn't give any shade,

136
00:18:52,360 --> 00:19:00,040
afterwards it becomes a dry horrible dying tree.

137
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,640
When it dies, it falls upon someone.

138
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,400
It grows thorns, all dried things grow thorns.

139
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,240
It's like a desert, where only thorns can grow.

140
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:28,640
When the whole society becomes
so stupid as to hate each other,

141
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,320
materialistic,

142
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,000
then roses are not going to grow there,

143
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,520
lotuses are not going to grow there,

144
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,320
while you are the lotuses of this country.

145
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,240
You are born in the mud all right, but now come back to yourself.

146
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:04,480
You were beautiful. You are like lotuses, fell into this mud,

147
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,520
became the mud,

148
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,240
out of which you came out because of your true nature.

149
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,800
Then you have become now lotuses, but there is no fragrance.

150
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,800
Lotus without a fragrance, one can't understand.

151
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,480
Lotus has to have a fragrance.

152
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,720
The fragrance that will overcome the filth of this mud.

153
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,160
You have to grow much more than Indians can grow.

154
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,040
On the contrary, the arrogance of people, I am amazed.

155
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,000
They start complaining about this, complaining about that,

156
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,320
complaining about another thing.

157
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,480
What do they think of themselves? Who are you?

158
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,480
Because the roots are not developed. Once you'll develop your roots,

159
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,760
immediately the humility will start coming into your temperament.

160
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:23,720
There is artificial humility, not from the heart.

161
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:31,560
It will only come when you become virgins, you become innocent.

162
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,800
Innocence only doesn't mean morality, doesn't mean only that.

163
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,640
Many people think that if you are a moral person - No.

164
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,720
It also means non-materialistic attitude.

165
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,080
For people, carpet is more important than their children.

166
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,480
Morning till evening they'll be saying harsh things

167
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:10,480
just to save few nonsensical things which are going to be left here permanently.

168
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:22,000
Materialism is the hit, it's the one that hits you, your innocence.

169
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:34,480
If materialism means to make things to give others happiness,

170
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:44,280
to present others, as a cup that carries the nectar,

171
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:54,520
if materialism is that cup which gives the nectar of love, then it's all right.

172
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,320
But you don't eat the cup, do you?

173
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:08,120
To Me, materialism sounds like people eating the cup, and not the nectar!

174
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,240
Is cup more important, or the nectar?

175
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,080
Supposing there's a golden cup and a poison is placed inside that,

176
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,520
will you take it because it is in golden cup?

177
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,720
If you take it, of course, I will have more value for gold.

178
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:33,080
Will anybody knowingly take a poison in a golden cup because it is in gold?

179
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,520
No common sense! There's no common sense at all!

180
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,240
That material things cannot give you happiness

181
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,680
is the basic factor of economics.

182
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:57,480
In My own lifetime I have seen, that anything material

183
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:04,040
gives you greatest happiness when you can give it to someone.

184
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:20,320
I have seen that way, always. I enjoy the giving more than taking.

185
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:29,200
I mean you try, sometimes, to give away something, and see how happy you feel.

186
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,080
Of course, it should not be done because you want to get rid of it!

187
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,080
Actually it is done for that only, perhaps.

188
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:47,240
Because whatever you possess is a headache in any way - even the subtlest form.

189
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:55,080
Any possession is like getting possessed. It's slavery.

190
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,200
It hinders your freedom to grow.

191
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,280
But it goes hand in hand. You know, people ask Me,

192
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,720
"How it is these people, who are so affluent are so miserly?

193
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,480
Why are they so miserly?" People can't understand, you know.

194
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,000
For 1 p if it is dearer, the whole England will be ablaze, you see.

195
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:26,000
All the time what you hear is nothing - that so much percentage of rise

196
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,320
in this thing and that, and they are going for a strike for this.

197
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,280
I can't understand, how do you keep account of all that?

198
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,360
If somebody asks Me what is the price of this sugar here and there,

199
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,400
I wouldn't know, but I would just know that it's cheaper than the other place.

200
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,400
Because I am innocent.

201
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,000
I'll get things absolutely cheapest always, I have seen that.

202
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,400
I always get things cheapest because I am so innocent.

203
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,720
My innocence takes Me to places where it is cheapest

204
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,320
and I get the maximum joy,

205
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:15,560
because I can give it. I know how to give it.

206
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,480
That's how I would say, because of the real force of your Spirit which is virginity,

207
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,800
you have lost your, lost the sense of joy also.

208
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,080
You are joy killers, morning till evening you are killing each other’s joy -

209
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,240
to say harsh things, you see, from this tongue.

210
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,720
I was folding My hands before you because I knew it would little bit upset you,

211
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,240
so I was just keeping it there, that your mind should not be disturbed so much.

212
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,400
In My palms, you see, very carefully I was catching your heart

213
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,360
to keep it there, so that you should not feel hurt.

214
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:59,120
Because it was not harsh, but it was truth which was harsh.

215
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,480
But still, in My Palms I was holding it, carefully,

216
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,360
so that you should not feel hurt about it.

217
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,760
So to hurt anyone, just open your tongue and hurt anyone,

218
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,760
one doesn't understand how many ripples of hatred

219
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,800
you are creating within yourself.

220
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,560
Twenty-four hours are not sufficient for Me to love people.

221
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,240
Now, I will be sixty years of age,

222
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,120
I don't think I have done justification to these sixty years

223
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,560
because I have not been able to love people as much as I wanted to.

224
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,240
The flow is so great that I, My body suffers with that flow and sometimes

225
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,800
I curse Myself that, "Why should I carry such a load of love within Myself?"

226
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,600
And little excitement with the puja also.

227
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,520
You know what happens to Me, I shudder.

228
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,520
Sometimes, you are calling Me for puja, now what will happen?

229
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,080
Then somebody can ask a question sometimes,

230
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,080
"Mother, did we not suck Your vibrations?"

231
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,720
Is obvious, but I don't want to say that.

232
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,000
Because if I say that, your Vishuddhi will be caught up.

233
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,560
Again you will suck less.

234
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,880
It's a very delicate work I have to do.

235
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,080
You are already wounded people,

236
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,480
because you have wounded yourself. Nobody has done this harm to you,

237
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,120
you people have nicely wounded yourself, very nicely.

238
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,040
Every way possible you have tried to hurt yourself.

239
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,400
Now because of the hurt, the guilt is built-in

240
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,560
and you are hurting others. It is as simple as that.

241
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,200
So don't hurt yourself, there is no need to hurt yourself.

242
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,080
But remember that we have no business to be harsh to anyone.

243
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:19,800
We have to be sweet people. We have to be kind people.

244
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,400
There are also psychologists who have come forward to give you explanation

245
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,600
for your harshness, that, "Your will-power should be strong.

246
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,160
If you don't talk like that others will take advantage."

247
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,800
Who can take advantage of the western people?

248
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,560
It is absurd, absolutely absurd!

249
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,400
The ones who have done injustice all over the world should say such a thing,

250
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,160
it's absurd, I cannot understand how can they give an explanation like that!

251
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,000
But now the time has come.

252
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:09,360
You are the people who are going to change the mind of God

253
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,000
with your good behavior.

254
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,000
The wrathful God, you are going to please Him.

255
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,160
You are going to represent that area which sucks in the compassion of God.

256
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,080
Ask for His compassion! Do you deserve it?

257
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,560
If you don't deserve it,

258
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,600
who is going to deserve it in this western world - you tell Me - today?

259
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:48,000
You are the ones chosen for this, specially prepared for this, to create an area

260
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:59,400
so that the deity of compassion should be awakened, for the rest of them.

261
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,400
The arrogance, you have seen in the spread of Sahaja Yoga, what happened:

262
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,720
we had a program where we had, say, a thousand people.

263
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,320
For the next follow up there are only three. It's typical.

264
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:28,520
I have spent most of My precious time in this country, and in the West.

265
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:39,040
Despite that, the arrogance sometimes baffles Me.

266
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,080
Arrogance among each other, even towards Me sometimes they are so arrogant,

267
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,080
I cannot think of anyone being that arrogant to Me, as the way they are.

268
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,160
The way they talk to Me, the way they behave towards Me,

269
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,800
I just can't understand how can they be like that.

270
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:09,040
It can be anyway, anywhere, anytime, especially women.

271
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,760
I was amazed, I went to Belgium, and I found

272
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,400
that Belgian housewives were even worse than Indian… than British housewives.

273
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,720
Ah! Terrific, terrific women! Ah! Just horrible!

274
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,320
Absolutely. You just don't know how to deal with them, it's terrific!

275
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,720
They control the whole household into their hands, I don't know how.

276
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,560
Only, I don't know how they do it. There's no ... (interruption in recording).

277
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,400
So ego-oriented, I am amazed!

278
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:48,200
But if you go to America, American women are baba, they are Amazonic!

279
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,680
Horrible! You just can't understand, there's no love, no affection, nothing.

280
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,600
Showing off, all the time talking about their material things,

281
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,680
absolutely dry sticks, I tell you. And they want Realization,

282
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,320
and they want to be great, and this and that. I don't know. What are they?

283
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,560
Today it's especially the day of virginity.

284
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:31,320
I have really great hopes from the women of this country, especially.

285
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,040
Here the men don't talk at all, you see, the pattern was worst in Belgium,

286
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,200
no man would talk a word. They cannot talk, just poor things are just shut.

287
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,240
They don't talk, strangled, completely strangled by women,

288
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:52,240
believe Me. Horrible! What is going to happen to that country, you see,

289
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:00,200
where men can't talk and women talk? It's horrifying, let us face it up.

290
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,680
What have they achieved, the women there?

291
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,720
At least, in India, our Prime Minister is a woman.

292
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,680
What are they? Good for nothing, useless, just washing utensils in the house

293
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,640
and showing off. I just don't understand.

294
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,080
What sacrifices they can go up to?

295
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,080
The woman is known by the amount of sacrifices she makes.

296
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,280
It's a challenge, I tell you, for all of you women who are Realized Souls

297
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,520
to see to it, that you humble down yourself.

298
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,560
Your quality cannot improve unless and until you humble down.

299
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,800
On everything you assert. For what?

300
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:53,000
It's impossible to worship Virgin when we are so arrogant and so strangling type.

301
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:01,320
The Virgin is a simple woman. She's extremely simple.

302
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:10,480
She doesn't understand what are your plans and what is so important, everything.

303
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,240
Her importance is Her virginity, that She knows,

304
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,720
and She will not allow anybody to touch [it?].

305
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,480
That's Her property, that's Her wealth, that's Her greatness.

306
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,800
And She's humble because She's not afraid of anyone.

307
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,600
She's not aggressive.

308
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,080
But She doesn't allow anybody to aggress; nobody dare aggress a real Virgin.

309
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,120
A new page has been turned now, in Sahaja Yoga.

310
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,760
I must warn you all about it.

311
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,560
Don't take liberties too much with Sahaja Yoga.

312
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:15,000
You are not obliging anyone else but yourself, be careful.

313
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,000
Take up My warnings always seriously.

314
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,360
You all have to come up very well now.

315
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,360
It is not only doing My puja is going to help you, I can tell you this much.

316
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,320
Now you better worship yourself.

317
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,320
You have to worship all your Gods within you. Cleanse them.

318
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:51,160
First is the God and the Goddess of humility,

319
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,480
of innocence, of simplicity.

320
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,400
Worship that.

321
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,680
Unless and until you can worship that,

322
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,680
you cannot go further, you will not be protected.

323
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,320
Again I say that a new page has been turned.

324
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,320
Don't take liberties with Sahaja Yoga.

325
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,760
It has bestowed all the blessings upon you. You have seen the light of the day.

326
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,800
But be prepared for the night.

327
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:46,360
Nobody should try to take liberties. Try to improve yourself.

328
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,640
No more complaints.

329
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,320
If you can't live in an Ashram like that, you better get out of it.

330
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,080
It's not for your convenience. Nobody is in need of you. Take it from Me.

331
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,200
Nobody is in need of you, you have to be in need of your Self.

332
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,400
If you are seekers, if you want to find your roots,

333
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,320
everything is available for you.

334
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:31,600
But you have to be humble, to go down to the roots, not with arrogance.

335
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,000
We must understand why we are not progressing.

336
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:56,280
Actually arrogance comes to people who lack Self-confidence.

337
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,360
Self-confidence is shattered to people whose Self is not manifesting.

338
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,400
Let your Self manifest.

339
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,320
When the Self is not manifesting, you get all kinds of problems,

340
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,400
and then you complain. Actually the problem resides within you.

341
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,080
It is God who has to complain.

342
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,000
Think of it. The One who has created this universe,

343
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,520
the One who has created you all with such love and affection,

344
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,760
the One who has given you everything under the sun,

345
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,160
also the One who has given you Realization, given you light;

346
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:57,360
everything that is possible and you are complaining against Him?

347
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,120
You should not. Complain about yourself,

348
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:13,720
that, "I am not all right, I should be all right."

349
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,720
Complain about it, face yourself.

350
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,360
Like children, when they face the mirror, they say,

351
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,040
"This is somebody else." But we believe.

352
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,400
They never identify themselves with their own images that they see.

353
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,320
They are identified with the image that they 'are'.

354
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,480
They don't create artificial images or don't dwell with the images

355
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:49,640
which are making them feel ego-oriented.

356
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:57,480
They live with reality as it is. We are made like that.

357
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:09,280
You see a camera, if it takes some photograph under a light

358
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:19,200
which is not, maybe, some other color, the photograph could be different.

359
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:26,320
Supposing, I am wearing a red thing and supposing, you put a light that is blue,

360
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,040
this might start looking green.

361
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,000
But human eyes will see always the same thing.

362
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,600
It won't see something unreal. Camera can do all that.

363
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,160
Camera can remove somebody's head and put somebody's head there.

364
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,000
All these tricks are possible with camera but not with human eyes.

365
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,120
Whatever you see is the thing that.

366
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,800
Of course, [if] you are drunk, then [it's] different.

367
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,680
I mean, I am not... I am saying of normal conditions, you see.

368
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,320
In normal condition, you see what exactly exists.

369
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,480
But if you are ego-oriented, you will never see yourself what exists.

370
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,400
You will see some sort of a bloated, you see, you will think yourself to the,

371
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,760
be the King of God's Heavens, you see.

372
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,400
You can see, if you want to; is imagination.

373
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,720
If you put your imagination like that, you can see yourself as anything!

374
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,160
Which is false, is absolute false!

375
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:46,240
You are your Self and you must see yourself as your Self, as your Spirit.

376
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:57,000
And Spirit is the universal being, is the innocence, is the Virgin within you.

377
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,600
Respect it, respect that part of yours which is the Virgin - still exists -

378
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,280
because if it was not there, I could never have given you Realization.

379
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,720
Despite every attack, it existed there, be sure on that point.

380
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,080
If it had not existed, you could not have got your Realization.

381
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,080
So many of them, they are very proud,

382
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,360
"Oh! I don't feel anything, Mother, you know, it's nothing."

383
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,000
Then there is to be, more to be ashamed!

384
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,760
Or at least you feel that you are missing something, isn't it?

385
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,120
At least, you should feel that you are missing,

386
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,480
if something is not all right and you should be all right.

387
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,240
At least think like that, "I should be all right, I am not all right."

388
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,200
On the contrary, "No, no, I didn't feel. Oh, what, I didn't feel, I should feel."

389
00:43:52,480 --> 00:44:03,240
So the wisdom. Wisdom is the part that is innocence. It's complete wisdom.

390
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,720
You find this among the villagers or very simple people.

391
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,320
They are not cunning in any way. You try to befool them and you'll be amazed,

392
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,600
at the end of it you'll find, "I'm such a big mad fat fool myself."

393
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,320
Try that with some rustic people, who are very simple, matter of fact,

394
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,680
who live with the Mother soil.

395
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You will find that all those so-called intellectuals,

396
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,080
if they try to befool a simple man like that,

397
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,800
after half-an-hour, this educated and very M.A.D., Ph. D. style

398
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:51,480
will find that he is 'the biggest fool ever born'.

399
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:05,160
There is a saying in Sanskrit, which is very common: "Vidya vinaye na shobhate."

400
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:12,520
That is Vidya, even the knowledge, is decorated.

401
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,320
Shobhate means gets its decorations or...

402
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,160
What is shobha? Sahaja Yogi: Glory. Shri Mataji: Beautified.

403
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,000
Sahaja Yogi: Beauty.Yes. Shri Mataji: ...is beautified only through humility.

404
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,080
If there is an educated man, he has to be a humble person.

405
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:40,240
If he is not a humble person, then he is not educated at all, in any way.

406
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,600
I don't know if I have told you a story

407
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:57,640
about one saint was meditating and was blind.

408
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:07,600
And a king came there and asked him, "Did you see some people around?"

409
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,800
He said, "Yes. Yes, king, my king. Sit down.

410
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:20,520
I saw your servant coming, and then your minister came in,

411
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,160
and then the Prime minister came in, and then now you have come".

412
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,760
He said, "You are blind, how did you know?

413
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,480
Through your meditation?" He said, "No. Common sense".

414
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:43,320
He said, "What is the common sense?" He said, "The first, the servant came in.

415
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:50,480
He said, "What, you are bogus fellow sitting down here, wasting your time?"

416
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,000
He gave me two-three abuses, used bad language,

417
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:03,000
and said, "Have you seen any person here?" So I said, "No."

418
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:13,040
Then the minister came in. He didn't abuse me, but he just asked me.

419
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,640
Then the Prime minister came.

420
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:24,200
He said, "Sir" to me. - Must have been from England.

421
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,760
And might have said also "Thank you", perhaps -

422
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:46,080
"And then came the king." And he (the saint) said that,

423
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,520
"You were extremely humble. You first touched my feet,

424
00:47:50,720 --> 00:48:02,320
you sat down on the Mother Earth, waited for me to ask you,

425
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:09,200
"What do you want?" And in a very humble way you said,

426
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:17,080
"If you have heard of people around you" -

427
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:27,320
because I am blind, so you didn't say something that would hurt me,

428
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,480
in such a humble way - if I could tell you.

429
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:39,040
But at least hundred and eight names of the Guru you took, before you asked me this.

430
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:47,000
So I know you are the learned, you are the humblest, and so you must be the king."

431
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:53,480
Otherwise, in those days, at least we never had kings or Prime ministers

432
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:00,320
who were box-office actors.

433
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:15,720
Even the public was so innocent that they would not accept such nonsense, you see.

434
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,320
So this was the difference.

435
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:32,240
From this story we have to derive that the more we are learned into Vidya,

436
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:40,800
into the technique of Sahaja Yoga, we have to be humble.

437
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:48,320
That is our decoration, that is our certificate,

438
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:58,000
that is the path into the entrance of every human being,

439
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:08,080
that is the way we are going to be very close to the other seekers.

440
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:15,320
To be humble, to find out ways and methods of being humble.

441
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:32,800
This is the key of Nirmala Vidya, how to be humble.

442
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:43,640
By humility you will not ever say, "This is my bathroom",

443
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,480
or "This is my fruit", or "This is my food",

444
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:54,320
or "This is my table", and "This is my glass".

445
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:06,560
Innocence gives you the strength to enjoy

446
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,560
everything that is there. I mean, for Me, sometimes I have to eat with bhoots,

447
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,720
and sometimes I have to eat bhoots.

448
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:27,560
Not only eat with them, but also eat them - it's the worst part.

449
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:39,640
So, you also should not mind if there are people with bhoots.

450
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:47,080
If they are arrogant, try to give them bandhans

451
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:51,320
try to control them through all these methods.

452
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,600
But if you think by arguing with them you will be able to manage them,

453
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:05,320
it's an impossibility. So try Nirmala Vidya, and that is humility,

454
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,760
which is the myelin sheath of vibrations.

455
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,000
Like every nerve has a myelin sheath covering it,

456
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:20,520
in the same way is the humility, is the myelin sheath.

457
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:27,320
If you are humble, you will win the battle, if you are not, we'll be lost.

458
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,720
Then the whole thing will become a joke for you, absolute joke.

459
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:41,240
If you are humble, you can see the stupid, the bhoots

460
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:48,520
and all the arrogant as clowns of this drama.

461
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:57,760
Try to be humble with your Self, and with Me. With Me is very important.

462
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,720
You must understand that it is one of the conditions

463
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:10,360
that Christ has put on you, so be careful. Dealing with Me,

464
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:17,080
I don't want you to be in any way rude to Me, because I can't help it there.

465
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,320
Till you are humble with Me, everything is in My charge.

466
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:27,680
But as soon as you are rude to Me, somebody else and so many of them,

467
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,760
thousands of them take charge, and then don't blame Me for that,

468
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:41,000
because you are My protégés, you are under My protection.

469
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,400
Supposing you try to make holes in your roof,

470
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,360
and then say that the rain is coming in. What can you do about it?

471
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,720
I mean, the hole... you have already made the holes in your roof.

472
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,080
The roof that was to protect you, you have made holes, now the rain has to come in.

473
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,680
Then if you want that the roof still should protect you from the rain,

474
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,520
then I must say you lack intelligence. That's what it is.

475
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:16,480
So this is the another warning.

476
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:24,520
It's very embarrassing, but again today is the day of embarrassment as it is.

477
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,240
Because the Virgin is in embarrassed condition always,

478
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,680
She is a bashful personality. She has to be bashful, you see.

479
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:41,080
She is embarrassed to say things which She does not want to say.

480
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,800
Of course, that's a very sweet thing,

481
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:49,080
even there She is bashful, to say harsh thing is a horrible stuff.

482
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:59,200
So let us worship our virginity within ourselves. Let us rise up to that point

483
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:10,640
to mount that diamond of brilliance of our virginity,

484
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:17,000
in the setting of our humility.

485
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:27,480
You can be angry with others, not with Sahaja Yogis, not with Me.

486
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:33,760
Even with others, when it is absolutely required.

487
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,000
But if you fight among yourselves, and tell people about Sahaja Yoga,

488
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,080
nobody is going to believe you.

489
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,080
And that is why today is the day

490
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:59,000
when the Virgin Gauri sat down to worship Shiva.

491
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:06,280
She made a Shiva Linga and was sitting and putting Her sindur on that,

492
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:12,720
"That you look after this, which is the mark of My union with You.

493
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I leave it to You to look after, to Shiva. You look after this.

494
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:25,120
I surrender to You." For this, that’s how the Gauri,

495
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:30,600
your Kundalini, surrenders to the Spirit. "Now you look after this connection.

496
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,800
I forget everything else. I leave it into Your hands. Lift me up.

497
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:41,640
You raise me up. I forget all that was me before.

498
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,640
Everything I have dropped out. No other desire.

499
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:51,000
But just lift me higher and higher. Make me Yourself.

500
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:56,080
The rest of it is not important. All other manifestations of these desires are over.

501
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,240
Now, I am absolutely surrendered to You, my Spirit.

502
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,480
Lift me higher and higher. Higher and higher,

503
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:13,160
away from all the things that were not the Spirit.

504
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:20,800
Make me complete Spirit, full Spirit."

505
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,040
Forget all that was there.

506
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:34,040
That elevation, that ascent

507
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:46,080
becomes a fast, quick trip, a very fast ascent.

508
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:52,760
Just you can do it if you try at this moment and every moment

509
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:59,120
to give up all that was not the Spirit.

510
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,320
Anything that goes against the Spirit must be given up.

511
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,600
And that is what is the pure desire,

512
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,720
that's what it is the Kundalini, is the Virgin.

513
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,080
Is to be absolutely one with the Spirit.

514
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:26,240
All the rest has no meaning, has no value.

515
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:34,080
This ascent - whatever may be your position,

516
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,800
to whomsoever you may be married, wherever you are working,

517
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,680
whatever is your situation, whatever may be your country,

518
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:49,320
you are the Spirit. And if you are raised aloft,

519
00:58:49,480 --> 00:59:01,400
you will dwell in the beautiful kingdom of God, where all ugliness drops out.

520
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:09,760
Like when the lotus opens out, all the mud drops out, completely.

521
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:15,360
In the same way, let My children become the fragrant,

522
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:20,040
beautiful offerings of Sadashiva.

523
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,680
May God bless you.
