1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sashti. Sixth night of Navaratri, Sydney (Australia), 
17 October 2007.

2
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:26,208
This is too small.

3
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:58,125
You can get a good hall here, very easily.

4
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:07,333
Actually I never knew that there’s a programme

5
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,041
otherwise I would have told you.

6
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,166
Here also,

7
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:00,250
come along, there is room here.

8
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:12,083
Can you hear me there?

9
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,041
Come forward,

10
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:04,417
here put the piano that side in the corner?

11
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,208
Why is she crying?

12
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,250
What has she got, a cake?

13
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,208
What is this?

14
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,250
A gift, Shri Mataji

15
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,166
Very beautiful, Who’s done it?

16
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,250
Yogi: Maria and Sue

17
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,125
You did?

18
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,333
Very good, very good

19
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,333
absolutly good

20
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,083
Everything.

21
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,000
What’s her name?

22
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,333
Yogi: Sue Williams

23
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,166
Thank you very much, very beautifully done.

24
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,166
You can’t move further?

25
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,166
Who is the leader here

26
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,333
He is the leader?

27
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,125
So why couldn’t you get a bigger place?

28
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,083
Shri Mataji, we could find a bigger place

29
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,250
but we did not want to have to transport you from here

30
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:31,166
– less moving for you. 
Your comfort is our only desire Shri Mataji,

31
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,417
so yogis are happy, so long as you’re comfortable.

32
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,250
You are all Sahaja Yogis,

33
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:47,208
and there should not be controversy between you.

34
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:55,333
You should all think of the same thing, isn’t it?

35
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,291
I feel sorry so many standing outside.

36
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,208
Come in, come in!

37
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,333
Can you move the piano behind?

38
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,375
Can you all hear me?

39
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,291
Those Como people are here? Como?

40
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,333
Sir CP: They are not here.

41
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,250
They are not here?

42
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,333
Both of them are not ?

43
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:44,041
Yogi: Giovanni and his wife are here.

44
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,375
You are from Como?

45
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,041
See! He could come!

46
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,417
You can come here,

47
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:20,250
there is space, make some space there.

48
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,291
Why didn’t you get another hall?

49
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,333
They are so many….

50
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,125
I’m happy to see all of you here.

51
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,417
May God bless you.

52
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,291
Today in the shop there was a lady.

53
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:28,041
She came and she wanted to have her realisation, and she got it.

54
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,417
Got it very well.

55
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,375
See now it depends on…

56
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,333
there are many who are searching.

57
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:45,041
But you have to contact them, and bring them forward.

58
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,417
Now, I don’t know, if you want to take a hall,

59
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,208
you have to pay for it.

60
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,291
But was this just to save money?

61
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,166
You are so many.

62
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:21,041
And you can afford to have a hall,

63
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,333
all of you sitting there,

64
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:26,250
and I feeling comfortable.

65
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:35,083
After all, you are all Sahaja Yogis,

66
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:38,333
all brothers and sisters,

67
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:45,083
and you don’t mind any inconvenience,

68
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:50,250
but if we can make something convenient, we should do it.

69
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,291
With so many you could have got a hall…

70
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:08,250
Yogi: Shri Mataji we have one big hall, in a place called Balmoral,

71
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,166
it’s about one hour’s drive from here

72
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,333
and  everyone could fit inside the big hall.

73
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,250
It’s a little distance from here, Shri Mataji,

74
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,041
it’s about one hour’s drive. Everyone would fit there.

75
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:22,041
Sir CP: It would require your travelling to that place.

76
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:26,166
In order not to give you trouble to travel, they all came here —

77
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:31,291
No-no, I have no trouble, I have come all the way from India!

78
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:49,333
For My convenience you take no such a note.

79
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:55,041
See, wherever you are, wherever you have the programme,

80
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,291
I’ll go there.

81
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:01,083
As long as possible I will definitely go.

82
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,250
These days, life is much more comfortable

83
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,125
but when I was working in the villages

84
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,125
I used to go on the bullock cart.

85
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,125
You’ve got photograph, you can see

86
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,417
– on the bullock cart, to go for miles together.

87
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,041
I knew I had to do all that.

88
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,333
If I have to get Sahaja Yogis,

89
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:44,083
I have to work that way.

90
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,166
And I was quite prepared.

91
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:55,041
I never felt any exhaustion with it, never.

92
00:13:56,041 --> 00:14:00,041
On the contrary, after I meet you all I feel so happy.

93
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:11,125
Now, is there somebody who has problems?

94
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:23,166
Anybody. Who has problems?

95
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,333
Yogi: You’ve blessed us all. We’re all blessed to be Sahaja Yogis.

96
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,125
We don’t have any problems Shri Mataji. We’re with you,

97
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,083
there are no problems.

98
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,291
What did she say?

99
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:02,125
Yogini: Shri Mataji, I have a problem.

100
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:09,000
Yogi: She said she has a problem. She has a problem, Shri Mataji.

101
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,083
What is that?

102
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,125
Yogi: What is your problem?

103
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,333
Yogini: Alcohol is a big problem in my family.

104
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,333
Yogi: She’s saying her family has a problem with alcohol.

105
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:32,041
Family,what is the problem?

106
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,333
They are not in Sahaja Yoga?

107
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,166
Why not?

108
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,125
You are the mother?

109
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,083
How about the children?

110
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,417
Yogini: I have two children in –

111
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,041
The children are… are they Sahaja Yogis your children?

112
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,250
Yogini: No the two older children, no

113
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,041
How many children you have?

114
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,166
Yogi: Four children, Shri Mataji.

115
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:06,291
Shri Mataji: Four children.  They are not Sahaja Yogis?

116
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:13,333
Yogi: Two young children in Sahaja Yoga and the two older ones are not in Sahaja Yoga,

117
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,375
and the husband is not in Sahaja Yoga.

118
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:19,333
Surprising.

119
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,542
But here the family system is good compared to,

120
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,333
say, in England,

121
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:37,041
where the family breaks after some time.

122
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,500
At least here, is much better.

123
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:59,458
Yogi (American accent): Shri Mataji, we in America have a problem,

124
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:03,166
that the seekers don’t stay in Sahaja Yoga.

125
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,458
Yogi: The seekers take their realisation in America,

126
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,458
and they don’t stay in Sahaja Yoga.  This is our problem.

127
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,166
They don’t stay.

128
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,417
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

129
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:15,542
Why?

130
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,375
Yogi: I don’t know Shri Mataji.

131
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,208
It’s not complete.

132
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:28,166
If they have a complete realisation,

133
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:31,083
they will have to come.

134
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,458
They are not complete.

135
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,417
Just half way.

136
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,125
They drink?

137
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,041
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji

138
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,333
That’s the point.

139
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:51,041
After coming to Sahaja Yoga you cannot drink.

140
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,375
And that must be the reason

141
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,542
they don’t want to come.

142
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,542
But you give them bandhans.

143
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,208
And beat them with shoes.

144
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,542
Who are those…your mother, father?

145
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,125
Yogi: My mother, my father, yes.  My good friends

146
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,166
they take realisation but they don’t stay as Sahaja Yogis.

147
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:22,458
Because they drink. 
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji.

148
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,166
See now,

149
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:37,083
all your countries have indulged into drinking.

150
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,417
All over Europe, you see, and it’s a little fight,

151
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,083
because for them drinking is their life.

152
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,041
And they can’t get out of it.

153
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:57,250
But we have ways.  We have to give them bandhans.

154
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:05,166
If you give them bandhans, all of you put together,

155
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,375
then they cannot run away.

156
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,417
Bandhan has to be given.

157
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,208
All of you should give bandhan.

158
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,500
That’s how they have worked out in India.

159
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,542
And India is, you know how Sahaja Yoga is strong there.

160
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,166
The reason is if they find

161
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,458
parents are not coming, or maybe children are not coming or whatever it is,

162
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:50,333
they all work it out by giving them bandhans.

163
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:59,041
But first thing, you should regularly come to SahajaYoga.

164
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,333
Regularly.

165
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:09,041
It is not half way, like today you come and then you don’t come.

166
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,166
That’s not proper.

167
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,709
That’s – you cannot progress.

168
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:24,625
You have to come to the programmes, all of you, regularly.

169
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:31,500
Because you know, realisation is not easy thing.

170
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,709
Nobody had it before.

171
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,709
Now you have got it.

172
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:41,709
So you have to maintain it and keep it up.

173
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,375
Once you start developing that,

174
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,333
the female (or family?) of the house also changes.

175
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:58,333
Greatest problem of Europe is – real problem, that they drink.

176
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,250
Drinking is the main problem.

177
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,250
And that’s why they don’t want to come to Sahaja Yoga.

178
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:11,125
But they can give their parents, but not Sahaja Yoga.

179
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,542
This is the trouble with them.

180
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,333
Parents can be given up,

181
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,083
in case they do not take to Sahaja Yoga.

182
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,500
You should show you don’t like it.

183
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:32,333
Why don’t they want Sahaja Yoga?

184
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:44,208
They drink. 
Now this is the curse of Europe, that they all drink.

185
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:50,667
And drinking is something very difficult.

186
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,083
They can’t give it up, poor things, they are slaves.

187
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,709
Slaves of drinking.

188
00:21:57,709 --> 00:22:01,709
So by your behaviour, and by your affection,

189
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,417
I’m sure you can win them over.

190
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,709
What’s the use – people who drink die so early.

191
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:15,375
You must have heard that they die very fast.

192
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:20,709
But despite that they don’t realise that one should not drink.

193
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:26,458
Because it has become an open market now for people.

194
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,500
This is the biggest problem of Europe.

195
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:37,125
But do you know it is much worse in America.

196
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,709
America’s problem is so funny,

197
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:49,166
that people who do Sahaja Yoga

198
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:53,291
cannot convince their parents.

199
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:58,083
And they think they have freedom

200
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,500
to do whatever they like.

201
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:07,166
And some of the Sahaja Yogis have lost their parents at a very early age.

202
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,458
Very early age.

203
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,250
Also they have parents who had heart

204
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,208
heart attacks.

205
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:22,500
All kinds of attacks.

206
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:26,125
Not only heart but any other disease they get.

207
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,458
It’s very funny,

208
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:35,500
which they don’t understand how important it is to get your Realisation.

209
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,417
So you should try to talk to them,

210
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:43,417
that “what is the aim of your life.”

211
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,333
You must ask them.

212
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:49,125
“What is the aim of your life?

213
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:52,709
You want to die or you want to live?”

214
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,375
First question.

215
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:59,166
If they say they want to die, let them die.

216
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:01,083
You should say, “should we

217
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,542
supply with some wines for you when you die?”

218
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,041
Make fun of it.

219
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:12,125
Make a fun.

220
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,709
So they will realise that they are stupid,

221
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,500
who are drinking,

222
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:19,709
and they are slaves.

223
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,583
Slaves of drinking.

224
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:27,375
They are not drinking because they are free people.

225
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:32,709
Because they drink, they die.

226
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,542
And die very fast.

227
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:40,125
The complication of the society is so much.

228
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:44,667
That I have seen people who were rich,

229
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,333
who had nice children,

230
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:51,417
but they have lost their parenthood.

231
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,041
They have lost the children,

232
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:57,375
and they have no money also.  They are on the street.

233
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:04,291
Drinking is the best way to waste all your money.

234
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:10,417
They think then when you say “don’t drink”,

235
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:14,250
you are interested in their money, maybe.

236
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,625
God knows what they think because

237
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:21,250
I don’t understand the psychology of people who drink.

238
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:28,000
There are some bhoots I think who give them ideas like this.

239
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,333
And they cannot give up drinking.

240
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,375
Very wrong.

241
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:39,417
Where...  in what book,

242
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:45,625
I mean like bible or any book is said, that drinking is good?

243
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:50,083
Did Christ drink?

244
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:55,083
They will follow Christianity.

245
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:02,166
They will follow Christianity, and not follow Christ.

246
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:06,000
It’s like that.

247
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,542
Christ never drank.

248
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:11,083
His parents didn’t drink.

249
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,083
Now what makes them think that they have a right to drink?

250
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,417
Specially for Christians.

251
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:27,041
Stupid they are if they think that drinking is their right.

252
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:32,583
And then they have problems with drinking.

253
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,667
Perhaps you know what problems there are.

254
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:42,250
You can find out what happens when people are drunk.

255
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:46,166
What happens to them, where do they go,

256
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,000
what is their position.

257
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:54,166
You can find out their friends,

258
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,583
where are they, what they are doing,

259
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,125
how are they living?.

260
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,041
You’ll be amazed,

261
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,458
that they are already on their way out.

262
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:14,208
If you show your wisdom to them, with assertion,

263
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,458
they will be coming around.

264
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,583
You have to tell them.

265
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,583
There’s nothing to feel shy about it.

266
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:30,083
You have to tell them what happens with drinking.

267
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:33,333
What is so great about it?

268
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:41,417
Europe problem is drinking – first.

269
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,375
The second problem is parenthood.

270
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:51,709
Parents don’t understand the responsibility of their children,

271
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:58,291
that all their lives they are going to be children of yours.

272
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:01,375
And you have to look after them.

273
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:05,125
There is no way of getting it out.

274
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:09,166
First of all why should you have children?

275
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,208
And if you have children,

276
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:15,709
you have to jolly well look after them.

277
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:21,542
But I have seen that in Europe people are really stupid.

278
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:26,375
They don’t understand this simple fact,

279
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:31,291
that if we cannot look after ourselves,

280
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:34,125
who will look after our children?

281
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:38,583
Very irresponsible.

282
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:44,625
Also the society is such, that in the society also,

283
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:49,583
they just believe in drinking.  All of them.

284
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:56,000
Indians who do not drink in India,

285
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,709
here they come and drink.

286
00:29:00,417 --> 00:29:05,125
When they come here, then they think it is something ideal,

287
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:10,250
and they drink.  I have known many like that,

288
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:14,041
who came abroad and started drinking.

289
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:18,250
So this is the big problem.

290
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:23,083
You should openly talk about it, to everyone.

291
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:27,250
That what is drinking, is stupidity —

292
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:33,542
to become stupid, by paying for it.

293
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:39,709
You have to pay, and you have to become mad.

294
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:45,250
Just imagine.  If you make fun of it,

295
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,458
and if you can tell them the truth,

296
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:52,417
I am sure they are all with the intelligence,

297
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:57,458
they will understand. But you should all the time tell them.

298
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:07,667
The third problem is that here it is,

299
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:11,542
till you are an adult you are away and free.

300
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:15,667
But I can’t understand –

301
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:20,250
you are born from your parents

302
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:27,500
and how do you become free after 18 years or whatever age it is.

303
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,625
How can that be?

304
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:36,375
It’s like a tree producing fruits,

305
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:39,667
and the people take away their fruits and eat it.

306
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:44,709
We are not trees.  We are human beings.

307
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,542
We can’t behave like trees,

308
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:55,625
which do not show any interest in their children after

309
00:30:56,166 --> 00:31:00,333
certain cutting has happened.

310
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,583
But it’s very surprising.

311
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:10,041
See, for us Indians it’s absolutely surprising,

312
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:13,458
that they can forget about their own children?

313
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,709
How can they do it?

314
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:21,125
You have got writers who have written stories,

315
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:24,458
and they have written so many things here,

316
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:28,500
that how can parents be stupid like that?

317
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:34,417
Whatever may be – whatever may be your father or mother –

318
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:41,041
they may be poor or rich, whatever it is – they are your parents!

319
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:44,417
And parents are there to look after you.

320
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:51,208
The stupid thing is that they make the child look after themselves.

321
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,709
When he is eighteen years of old,

322
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:59,417
he earns of his own, and the parents – “alright, go ahead.”

323
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,709
They want to shirk all the responsibility.

324
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:10,667
Never heard of such a thing.  This is a very recent fashion.

325
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:18,250
When Abraham Lincoln was there,

326
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,625
did it happen like that?

327
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,458
Did it happen with Christ,

328
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:33,542
that Mother gave him up

329
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:37,458
and said “alright, go ahead and get yourself crucified”?

330
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:45,500
How can parents behave like this?

331
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:48,291
They have no heart?

332
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:53,625
That they have no love for their own children?

333
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,583
India may not be that rich,

334
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,041
but people are loving their children.

335
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:14,667
Children also here do not listen to their parents,

336
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:18,250
because parents don’t look after them.

337
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:23,333
Can you imagine a society,

338
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,542
religion, or whatever you may call —

339
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:31,250
people have no connection with each other.

340
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:37,333
But in Sahaja Yoga we are all connected.

341
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,041
We are all one.

342
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,500
And we want to be together

343
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:49,041
with all our so-called differences.

344
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:54,458
We are Indians, we are Africans,

345
00:33:55,375 --> 00:34:02,000
we are English, but we are all Sahaja Yogis.

346
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,458
And this is what you have to tell them,

347
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,500
that what kind of friends you have?

348
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:12,417
They just come here for drinking and go away.

349
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,458
They’ll not even stand by you.

350
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:20,041
But our friends are our dear friends.

351
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:27,625
Sahaja Yogis sometimes make mistakes, doesn’t matter.

352
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,333
But they are Sahaja Yogis,

353
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:34,041
and they are one, and they help each other.

354
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:38,667
See how many countries have come together in Sahaja Yoga,

355
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:42,500
and they have such friendship with each other,

356
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,208
that you may not have with the people who are born

357
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:50,166
on the same side of the Earth.

358
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:54,667
You won’t recognize each other.

359
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,542
It’s horrible.

360
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:02,333
I tell you I am sometimes surprised the way

361
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:05,458
parents don’t think much of their parents.

362
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:11,041
Parents do not think that they are parents,

363
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,583
and the children don’t think that we are

364
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:19,542
children of these parents.

365
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:23,500
I don’t know what has done that.

366
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,542
It’s the money as they say, it’s the money,

367
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,458
money they earn.  Alright,

368
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:31,709
so what do you do with that money,

369
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:36,000
make yourself miserable, and make everyone miserable?

370
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:41,125
You don’t even respect money, because when you drink,

371
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,208
how much money you waste?

372
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:48,458
Does it go for any help?

373
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:53,417
Then drinking, it’s – here,

374
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:56,291
I was surprised,

375
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:03,291
many have given up, luckily have given up, and are happy.

376
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:08,166
It’s one thing, that in Europe,

377
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,500
drinking is a big social event

378
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:16,083
and everybody thinks they must drink,

379
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:19,458
otherwise they are not human beings.

380
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:25,166
They have to become mad, otherwise they are not.

381
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:32,166
Now the parents will understand if you join together.

382
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:37,125
You can bring them round, there are people who have done like that.

383
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:42,333
All the Sahaja Yogis together have managed to

384
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,333
bring the whole Johnnies to Sahaja Yoga.

385
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,417
When they will see that you are happy,

386
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:56,375
you don’t tell lies, and you are honest,

387
00:36:56,542 --> 00:37:02,000
and you are humble — what more do you want?

388
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:08,125
But they will go to church,

389
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:12,333
call themselves Christians, and behave like Satan.

390
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:17,291
See their behaviour.

391
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,709
They don’t even care for their children

392
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,667
because they have certain habits they have developed.

393
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:26,208
“Why can’t you give up those bad habits?”

394
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:31,291
this is the point you should ask your parents.

395
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:35,375
“Why don’t you give up this dirty stuff

396
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:39,083
which is just making you mad?”

397
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:45,709
Drinking makes people mad, I tell you,

398
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:48,709
and all their value system is lost.

399
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:55,375
Whatever you may be, whatever your education,

400
00:37:56,083 --> 00:38:00,333
all is useless if you take to drinks.

401
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:06,500
You have no personality after that.

402
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:11,709
Nothing [unclear] …the way you behave,

403
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,583
and when people get drunk, do you see

404
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:19,417
how they behave in a funny manner.

405
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:25,458
So just detest it,

406
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:29,375
and tell your parents you don’t like drinking.

407
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:33,417
We don’t want you to drink, why do you drink?

408
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:40,709
You can tell them!  Why do you drink?

409
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:45,000
Because by drinking they become mad …

410
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:51,667
it is better to get a certificate from mad house.

411
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:02,041
You Sahaja Yogis now realize this is madness,

412
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,166
and you have to tell them

413
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:09,083
that we think that you are all mad who sit down and drink.

414
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,375
What do you want?

415
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:19,250
Drinking, what does it give you?

416
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:29,083
First of all you must seek peace of your mind.

417
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:33,166
That’s not possible if you drink,

418
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:38,583
have you heard of somebody who has peace of mind because they drink?

419
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,083
When he dies, maybe!

420
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,667
So it is to be told to them frankly,

421
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:58,500
why do you drink, what is the need, to waste all the money?,

422
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:07,375
Mostly I have seen that they drink because they are so ignorant,

423
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:13,542
that they don’t know there is a higher life and better life

424
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:18,667
by which you can control your body, control everything.

425
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:25,542
Once they come to know they will realize

426
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,625
that this drinking makes you a slave,

427
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:32,125
they are slaves you see,

428
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,709
and when they tell you something you should say

429
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:39,709
‘we don’t want to listen to slaves, you are all slaves’

430
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:43,417
there’s no harm in telling like this.

431
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:48,375
‘You are slaves and we don’t want to listen to slaves’.

432
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:57,083
You see in India I don’t know somehow we have solved the problem,

433
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,166
people don’t drink so much,

434
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,083
because from the very beginning

435
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:07,125
there the drinking is regarded as a very bad thing.

436
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:12,291
If a girl knows that the fellow drinks she will never marry.

437
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:21,500
So society doesn’t accept drinking is a good thing,

438
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,583
while your  society is no society

439
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:31,458
because there is no friendship,

440
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:34,125
there is no understanding

441
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:39,083
and they don’t think of improving the life.

442
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,583
What do they think? They are very selfish

443
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,417
and they think of themselves,

444
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:53,542
selfishness in the sense  that becoming mad

445
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:56,250
is very great selfishness.

446
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:01,041
They become mad,

447
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:05,291
and go on becoming more mad and more mad

448
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:07,542
and it is a sickness,

449
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:12,208
you should tell them that this is sickness.

450
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:17,417
‘You are sick people already and we don’t want to follow you’ .

451
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:22,375
Don’t be rude but you should tell them.

452
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:27,208
Drinking is sickness, you say I said it.

453
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,291
I don’t mind .

454
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:40,417
Have you seen a man who is drunk?

455
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,583
What do you think of them?

456
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:47,333
They are more than mad people.

457
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,500
People are mad because something gone wrong.

458
00:42:53,375 --> 00:42:57,375
But these are mad because they have been drinking,

459
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:03,083
so you have to tell them ‘You are all mad.

460
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,125
You are going to ruin your country’

461
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:12,458
So many things I have seen, what happens in the West,

462
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:18,500
my own experience. See I am working in Maharastra,

463
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:23,083
working in India in different places

464
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:28,417
but there is no problem

465
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,208
with them when they are realised souls,

466
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,041
but here with realised souls also I find problems.

467
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,291
There is no problem in India if there is realised souls,

468
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,375
they are purely  realised,

469
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:51,583
and here  there are problems

470
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:56,583
even with the realised people.

471
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:06,333
Here there are some Sahaja Yogis who made illegal money.

472
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:11,291
They are Sahaja Yogis, I know for definite,

473
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,667
but they have done like that,

474
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:24,667
they have been saved, but not in the Heaven.

475
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:35,625
They work it out, save themselves but everything happens.

476
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:41,500
Some people say ‘Mother we drink very little’ but why?

477
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:48,583
Very common –‘very little we drink’

478
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:53,083
but why? Why do you want to drink and waste your money,

479
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,291
first of all wasting your money.

480
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,625
It’s very sad,

481
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:09,542
that all people who are so well educated,

482
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,250
so well off, become so mad

483
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:17,250
Idon’t understand

484
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:22,166
And if your parents are drinking they are mad.

485
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:27,125
You have to treat them like mad people.

486
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:31,083
Then they will realize,

487
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,667
you should tell them off,

488
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:41,250
that you want to waste all your money in drinking.

489
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:47,417
In India we have that way very strong Sahaja Yogis.

490
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:53,375
They break the bottles if they come in the house…

491
00:45:54,333 --> 00:46:02,291
or what they do they break the….anything!

492
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:11,625
The parents become really funny

493
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:16,208
because they can’t understand what is happening to these children.

494
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:19,125
But they are Sahaja Yogis,

495
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:23,125
so they don’t like it and they just throw them out.

496
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:30,333
There is no humbleness needed with the mad people.

497
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:34,542
You have to see that they give up their drinking,

498
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:41,542
very important, and not to feel shy about it.

499
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:50,125
If you correct your parents you correct the whole nation.

500
00:46:54,583 --> 00:47:00,333
So you all have to work it out and discuss among yourselves

501
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:04,625
and tell ‘Oh my Father drinks a lot’

502
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:09,208
So you ask your friend to come and put him right.

503
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:12,500
You can make fun of them, they are mad!

504
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:20,709
Do not take them seriously, they are mad, have pity on them,

505
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:27,542
and work it out that way. You have so many friends together.

506
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:31,375
Drinking is the curse in the West,

507
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:38,375
and how it has come I think some satanic force has worked,

508
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:42,625
they never used to drink so much before.

509
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:48,375
No! Now I don’t know,

510
00:47:49,417 --> 00:47:55,458
you walk on the street and you find so many of them walking along.

511
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:03,667
So Sahaja Yogis should see that they don’t drink themselves

512
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:07,709
and don’t allow anybody to drink,

513
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:11,417
your father, mother, brother…

514
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:15,625
you have to tell them ‘You are all mad!

515
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:20,291
Go to some mad house’

516
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:25,083
Once you tell them they will realize,

517
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:30,208
it’s only you who can correct them.

518
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,250
I may do anything

519
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:37,375
but first of all these people should give up drinking?

520
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:42,709
You have lot of strength as Sahaja Yogis

521
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:46,458
and you have to work out on your parents.

522
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:52,166
How many of your parents are drinking? 
Raise your hands….

523
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,500
Your parents also?

524
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:02,291
Bah prai!  [unclear]

525
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:07,667
Just imagine.

526
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:16,667
You should all oppose their drinking, openly.

527
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,583
You should say I don’t like to talk to people whodrink.

528
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:30,250
Like that.  You go on and you’ll be surprised they’ll come round.

529
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:41,417
It is absolutely depending on you.

530
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:47,709
If your parents are drinking you have to take a very strong view.

531
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:51,625
And you have so many other friends, also, to help you.

532
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:56,041
Make fun of them.

533
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:02,208
Somebody should copy as to how they behave after drinking,

534
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,542
how they walk.

535
00:50:05,709 --> 00:50:09,709
You should not insult them but to copy them.

536
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:15,208
Once they will know there is no respect

537
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:19,625
and care for the parents they’ll be alright.

538
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:30,125
But even if they drink you are not so much bothered –

539
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:35,166
you are not bothered as to — if they are drinking,

540
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:40,291
but you should say that you are all  mad, where will you be going?

541
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:44,208
What will happen to you?

542
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:52,667
You can talk like elderly people with them

543
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,500
and also see that they don’t have friends who drink,

544
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:05,500
if they have friends like that you’d better tell the friends.

545
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:15,250
You see

546
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:20,291
it’s not only you get responsibility when you get your realization

547
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:25,125
but it is your absolute  responsibility

548
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:31,500
that you improve your parents and improve your brothers and sisters,

549
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:41,500
you have to boss over them

550
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:47,500
and you have to tell them, nothing to feel shy.

551
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,625
Because they are mad, you know!

552
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,667
Very important forSahaja Yogis.

553
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:11,458
My experience is this, that there are Sahaja Yogis

554
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:18,208
in the West who are born, who get realization,

555
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:22,625
who are very good, who are excellent, I don’t have to say anything.

556
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:28,542
But they are humble before their parents.

557
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:34,333
You try to show that you don’t like it.

558
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:41,500
If they are drinking don’t sit there, get out of that place.

559
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:45,500
You should try to denounce the whole thing.

560
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,500
There’s no harm.

561
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:57,083
If somebody says harsh words you fight it back.

562
00:52:57,542 --> 00:53:02,583
But what about all these drunkards who are sitting and drinking?

563
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,458
You have to tell them all.

564
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:10,041
It’s only you who can improve your society.

565
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,583
I’m here to tell you,

566
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:27,250
but you people are very subdued .

567
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:34,250
How many of you fight with the parents, tell me, raise your hands.

568
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:39,083
Hardly any.

569
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:50,417
You are afraid of them, these drunkards?

570
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,500
They should be afraid of you

571
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:03,542
and hide themselves somewhere.

572
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:10,250
If there are bottles in the house you break them.

573
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,041
Of course!

574
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:17,375
You throw them away, break them.

575
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:21,125
That’s how you have to fight them.

576
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:30,041
How did we manage the British to go away from India?

577
00:54:33,709 --> 00:54:36,375
By protesting!

578
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,208
By protesting their domination, that’s all! Simple!

579
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:53,542
And they went away.

580
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:57,375
Can you imagine, there was no war, nothing,

581
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,375
and they all left us.

582
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:09,625
Because they say it is cold that’s why we drink.

583
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:15,417
No need, there is no need to drink for that.

584
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:23,166
I know so many Indians, so many of them,

585
00:55:24,542 --> 00:55:32,125
they don’t drink, they have never seen such a cold country.

586
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:36,709
Now also many Russians they don’t drink.

587
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:40,208
Very cold country, Russians,

588
00:55:40,542 --> 00:55:44,625
and they don’t allow their parents also to drink, you know Russians.

589
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:50,166
They are very brave, the way they fought.

590
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,417
You know how Hitler was trying to dominate them

591
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,417
but they got all the power.

592
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:04,125
So the Russians are not so, I should say,

593
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:07,500
fashionable

594
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,125
You are Russian, na? ...

595
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,500
Again,

596
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:21,291
Russians are very very brave people

597
00:56:23,709 --> 00:56:26,333
and they have fought their parents

598
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:31,083
and now in Russia we have such a lot of Sahaja Yogis.

599
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:36,291
It will happen that Russia will become whole

600
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:41,250
realised soul,

601
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:46,500
while here the great people who think no end of themselves

602
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:51,500
will be all ending up in the lunatic asylum.

603
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,542
So today’s my lecture, remember

604
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:04,417
that you have every right to oppose your parents

605
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,709
if they are drinking.

606
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:14,125
What they think that you want all the money, that’s why,

607
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:18,333
but you should say “We don’t want your money”.

608
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:25,709
So now if  you are a leader

609
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:29,417
and there are who are leading,

610
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:33,709
you should remember if you are opposing your parents.

611
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:35,709
What do you care?

612
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:43,083
Russians are very brave, I must say,

613
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,458
they have told their parents off, even authorities.

614
00:57:52,667 --> 00:57:56,709
Why? Because they are communists? Is it that?  No.

615
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:01,667
Because they are free-minded people.

616
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:06,500
After all you are all Sahaja Yogis

617
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:11,375
and what right they have got to dominate you.

618
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:19,375
They have no right, they are drunkards

619
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:22,125
how can they dominate you?

620
00:58:22,709 --> 00:58:25,542
You tell them ‘you are drunkards, don’t talk!’

621
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,083
No harm,

622
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:37,583
you have to fight, you have to fight your parents, very important.

623
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:41,500
I’m with you,

624
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:50,125
May God bless you.

625
00:58:55,709 --> 00:58:59,250
They will fight for democracy, this, that.

626
00:58:59,417 --> 00:59:01,709
It’s all demonocracy,

627
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:05,083
what is their democracy?

628
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:09,333
When they drink what business they have got to dominate you?

629
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:17,333
Who are they? Drunkards, put them down!

630
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:20,542
You have to now fight,

631
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,709
the time has come, too much time you have spent

632
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:29,417
and tolerated them. What have they done?

633
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,125
Nothing.

634
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,500
I must say Russians are very clever,

635
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:44,333
and very brave…

636
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:52,709
You know how they made Hitler run away,

637
00:59:54,166 --> 00:59:56,709
man like Hitler ran away from there.

638
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:59,291
How did they manage?

639
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:05,375
Because basically they are honest and brave.

640
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:13,542
So we do not drink so why should we be cowards?

641
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,709
Only the drunkards can be cowards.

642
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,333
You are not drunkards

643
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:24,333
so you should be brave and tell

644
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:27,709
your parents and improve your family life.

645
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:35,250
Here I find the family life is so horrible.

646
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:40,458
Parents are funny, mothers are funny,

647
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:45,625
how can they be? How can you be their children?

648
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:51,250
You should say that we are ashamed to be the children of  drunkards.

649
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:55,500
They will realize.

650
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:09,041
Russians have given up drinking

651
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,625
those who are Sahaja Yogis,

652
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:16,333
they have given up completely.

653
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:28,375
I don’t know what has made them like that.

654
01:01:31,417 --> 01:01:36,041
They are neither interested in money or position or anything,

655
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,166
Sahaja Yogis.

656
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:49,709
The Indians have got a heritage

657
01:01:50,417 --> 01:01:52,375
but they also,

658
01:01:54,709 --> 01:01:57,458
they come to England they start drinking.

659
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:06,667
They think people don’t drink because they are not free.

660
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,375
What is the idea?

661
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:13,583
If you are free you should be able to drink,

662
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:16,250
you should become mad?

663
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,667
That’s freedom, isn’t it?

664
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,709
Now you can tell them ‘you are mad’;

665
01:02:28,125 --> 01:02:30,417
‘You are drinking so you are mad’.

666
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:34,667
Tell them I have said it.

667
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:43,625
Alright now are you convinced?

668
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:54,250
Now,

669
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:05,041
everybody’s getting vibrations?

670
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:10,375
Is there somebody who is not getting? Please raise your hand.

671
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:20,417
See! How collective you are and how powerful.

672
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:28,166
But I have seen that Sahaja Yogis are so afraid of their parents

673
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,208
that they group together like two cowards,

674
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:38,166
you should be brave and tell them off,

675
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:41,375
you have got the power to do that.

676
01:03:42,709 --> 01:03:49,125
If you can change your parents you have done a great job to them.

677
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:53,500
What else can you do for them?

678
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:59,542
If the parents are changed you have done a big job.

679
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:05,166
What do you say?

680
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,000
You are too mild.

681
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:14,166
You take two, three Sahaja Yogis and beat them nicely

682
01:04:20,709 --> 01:04:25,208
otherwise they beat in any case after drinking,

683
01:04:26,709 --> 01:04:29,125
with drinking they do!

684
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,667
It’s very sad.

685
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:40,291
You all are free country people

686
01:04:43,417 --> 01:04:45,667
but you have to fight,

687
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,458
without the fight it won’t work out.

688
01:04:50,375 --> 01:04:53,542
So I want you all to meet each other

689
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:57,583
and have complete sense,

690
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:01,041
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

691
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:06,000
that means you are being blessed by God

692
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:10,250
and you are representative of God

693
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:15,333
and you are not going to take to these dirty things.

694
01:05:18,333 --> 01:05:23,250
Respect yourselves, respect!

695
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:30,166
You can tell your parents we cannot respect you for drink.

696
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:35,709
Tell them, you can tell them I have said so.

697
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:44,417
Look at Christ how he fought,

698
01:05:47,417 --> 01:05:55,250
what sort of Christians they are drinking, drinking, drinking.

699
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:07,417
But in India why don’t they drink? They don’t drink.

700
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:17,458
They just live without drinking, they are doing well.

701
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:32,041
I think you take from me that courage to fight your parents.

702
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:41,000
Next time when I come I don’t want to see anybody saying

703
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:43,417
that the parents don’t listen.

704
01:06:58,667 --> 01:07:03,250
When they are drunk you can hit them with the spoon.

705
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:17,291
Even in Russia they drink quite a lot,

706
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,166
but those who have got realisation don’t drink.

707
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,166
[unclear]… they don’t drink.

708
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,500
That’s why I think communism is good,

709
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,709
because they have so much courage!

710
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:38,041
With all this democracy

711
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:41,625
you are all becoming demons, nothing but demons.

712
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:48,166
So today I take your promise

713
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:53,125
that you will manage your parents well.

714
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,709
Thank you very much.

715
01:08:02,667 --> 01:08:07,375
Anybody has any problems you tell me.

716
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:15,208
Yogi: Mother, in my school there are many students whose family,

717
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:19,041
they drink and they’re all split up. They are very disturbed…

718
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:21,542
I can’t hear him

719
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:33,625
When? When they have time free?

720
01:08:35,709 --> 01:08:38,709
Yogi: And they’re all disturbed,

721
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:41,250
I can see, the students are all disturbed, Mother.

722
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:42,625
They want what?

723
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:48,625
Sir CP: The students, their parents drink and separate,

724
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,458
there are lots of problems, and

725
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:53,041
the young students are very upset about it.

726
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:55,291
You break their bottles,

727
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:01,208
you tell them I have told you.

728
01:09:02,333 --> 01:09:05,709
You break their bottles, you see the bottle and break it.

729
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,208
Then you see.

730
01:09:09,417 --> 01:09:12,125
We have done that in India,

731
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:15,709
you know when we were asking for independence?

732
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:22,125
The children, they used to break their bottles.

733
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:29,709
With the bottles in, you can never enjoy your freedom

734
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:33,375
—  you break it!

735
01:09:45,166 --> 01:09:47,125
Any question?

736
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:55,583
We shouldn’t insult them

737
01:09:56,166 --> 01:09:59,083
but you can break the bottles alright.

738
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:11,417
May God bless you.

739
01:10:38,542 --> 01:10:40,583
May God bless you.

740
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:56,208
You said you want to go to Kuwait?

741
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,208
Yogini: Ukraine, Mother

742
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:11,625
Ukraine. You want to go to Ukraine.

743
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,583
They are very good people,

744
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:46,208
Ukraine people are very good.

745
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:46,250
Such a lot, beautiful, beautiful, thank you.
