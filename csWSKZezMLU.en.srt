1
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:04,041
Happy Diwali!

2
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:16,333
Wish you all a very happy Diwali!

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,375
You have seen these different types of dances,

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,999
understand one thing from them

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,792
that whoever has written it or said it,

6
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,166
they are all saying the same thing.

7
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,208
The greatest thing that they said was

8
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,291
that the Paramatma is One.

9
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,417
They had incarnated in different forms, avatars,

10
00:00:58,917 --> 00:01:00,709
but the Paramatma is one.

11
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:04,959
There were no disputes amongst them,

12
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,750
they came in this world for the destruction of evil

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,999
and killing the wicked people;

14
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,333
and this is happening.

15
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:26,417
I am seeing everywhere

16
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:32,583
that these evil people are getting exposed

17
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:36,583
and now it is your duty too,

18
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:41,542
to see that all those who are evil,

19
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:46,709
those who are working against the Paramatma and

20
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,917
who are ready to do anything for the sake of earning money,

21
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:55,125
all of them go to hell.

22
00:01:56,166 --> 00:02:02,166
We do not know how many Hells there are!

23
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:08,750
The place where you are all sitting now

24
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,625
is very much away from hell.

25
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,166
There is no relation with hell at all.

26
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,208
But staying here,

27
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,667
if you perform unreligious deeds, do wrong things

28
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,000
then you too can go to hell.

29
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,542
There are many types of hells and

30
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,959
the arrangements to go there are also very nicely done.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,417
Because those who are going there,

32
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,875
do not even know where they are going.

33
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:54,875
Those who remain behind go to Heaven.

34
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:58,667
Nobody on this earthly abode even knows

35
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:03,041
that they may even go to Hell.

36
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,041
Doing wrong deeds would land us in Hell.

37
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,250
The meaning of Diwali itself is that

38
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,458
the way the lamps are lit outside,

39
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:19,250
you too should be enlightened within

40
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:31,125
In this dark world you see, you are the lights,

41
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:37,208
you are the lamps and you have to give the light.

42
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:41,333
But if you are not internally enlightened enough

43
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,333
then how can you give out light?

44
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,959
Realise this.

45
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,709
So first of all, you Sahaja Yogis

46
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:56,166
should get properly enlightened internally

47
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,709
and may be it is for this purpose alone

48
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,166
that we have come into this world.

49
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:09,000
Until Jesus Christ, nobody even spoke about this.

50
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,417
At Agnya chakra He came

51
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:23,667
and showed that he did not have any ego whatsoever.

52
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,917
He was the son of the Almighty, still he had no ego.

53
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,875
The people who had come before him

54
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:36,083
revealed a little but Christ

55
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:43,625
only wanted that our Agnya chakra should be cleared and

56
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,500
that Agnya chakra seems to be very much caught up in Delhi.

57
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,458
What is the reason for this?

58
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,625
The English people lived here before

59
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,917
and they taught us to be egoistic.

60
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,333
This is quite evident in your talk and behaviour.

61
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,291
We have seen those days too

62
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,333
when our country was not independent

63
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:22,333
but you people are liberated now.

64
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,959
Now we are independent.

65
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:29,875
And what is Swatantra, Know the Swa – oneself

66
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,166
and the one who has the “Swa” Self knowledge,

67
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,125
then he also has the knowledge of the “tantra”

68
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,542
instrument of “Swa” oneself.

69
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,750
Through Sahaja Yoga you have known yourself

70
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:45,917
and you know that you are the “tantra” instrument and

71
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,417
that you need to follow the path of Self Knowledge.

72
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:57,291
It can be seen that there has been a lot of development in Delhi.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,959
Outside Delhi too there has been a lot of development.

74
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:10,750
You all know what the problem is with the people over here,

75
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:11,917
I need not tell you.

76
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,875
But now you have become independent,

77
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,417
so you have to see that you don't have these problems.

78
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:26,500
The first problem is that your Agnya chakra is catching.

79
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:34,999
Christ was crucified and killed,

80
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:40,625
but still we have not yet learnt from it.

81
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:44,166
On the contrary, people from the Christian countries

82
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:47,250
are highly egoistic

83
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,834
and they have influenced us also.

84
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:57,917
But the worst thing here is that

85
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:05,959
we have not yet recognized each other.

86
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,333
There are fights and disputes everywhere.

87
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,166
There are quarrels going on,

88
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,333
there is no purity of mind.

89
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:21,583
First of all we should purify our minds.

90
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,625
With Sahaja Yoga everything is possible

91
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,583
and can take people to such great heights.

92
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:32,709
It is not necessary for anyone to go and sit in the Himalayas.

93
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,999
You can do this in the city of Delhi itself.

94
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,417
But if you look around

95
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,208
you will see egoistic people everywhere

96
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,291
and their Agnya chakra is caught up very severely.

97
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,667
So it is very difficult.

98
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,999
Now God has sent one new thing and that is “CANCER”.

99
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:59,500
If you get cancer and your Agnya chakra is not clear,

100
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,875
then it cannot be cured

101
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,166
and then a big tragedy will take place.

102
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,375
So, one who has cancer

103
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,875
should take to Sahaja Yoga

104
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:20,333
and clear out the ego within himself.

105
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,999
Wherever there is a Government,

106
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:26,333
there the people are very egoistic.

107
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,458
We have got so many government servants here

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,208
and all of them have enough ego in them.

109
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,500
The people who come from outside

110
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,000
have much more than them

111
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,041
and on top of it they all drink liquor.

112
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:46,583
You just analyse,

113
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,834
they call themselves Christians and they all drink.

114
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,792
By drinking liquor you are going against yourself.

115
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:04,417
You are disobeying your Agnya chakra.

116
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,291
You are not obeying it.

117
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,458
The person whose Agnya chakra is clear

118
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,542
cannot drink, he can never drink.

119
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,542
Wherever you look, the people are drinking liquor,

120
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,625
and they have no ways of getting rid of it.

121
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,375
Because when they find they are unable to get rid of it,

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,500
again they drink over it.

123
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:32,709
So addictions of any sort puts us into slavery,

124
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,291
let it be of any kind.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,291
Here, there is addiction to paan

126
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,375
and they will add tobacco also to it.

127
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,834
God has created you with so much of affection

128
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,542
and given you birth in this country

129
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,041
so that you can become unique from rest of the world.

130
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,333
They can be so. Indians are so.

131
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:04,542
But of late, I find there are a couple of serious ailments.

132
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:10,834
They are eating money in the place of food.

133
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,333
The roads by which we came now

134
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:19,625
were not there earlier but it was a pain for me

135
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,250
to see that the roads are in such bad shape

136
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,250
that no one can say that they are new.

137
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,458
Only Indians can do such things.

138
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,667
I have not seen such shameless people in the whole world,

139
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:41,792
who do such things. And it is not necessary to be so.

140
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:48,250
Here any time, any person who has the power can do this thing.

141
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,709
First of all, we have to take a resolution today

142
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:55,083
that we have to clear our Agnya.

143
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:58,250
The greatest issue at the Agnya is that

144
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,500
we think that we are very superior.

145
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:08,750
And we start thinking that we can rule the whole world,

146
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,041
and that we can correct the world.

147
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,583
When you yourselves are not correct

148
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,166
then how can you correct this world?

149
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,667
Now, you must have seen many people

150
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:21,792
who think that they are very great,

151
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:25,250
but do a lot of wrong things.

152
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,000
In this country people take a lot of money.

153
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,542
Tell me how will God forgive us for this?

154
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:41,542
The greatest of all sins are stealing and corruption.

155
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,125
The person who commits these types of sins,

156
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:50,125
whatever he may try, he may do poojas

157
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,542
chant mantras, read namaz, call out to Allah,

158
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,375
anything, he won't be benefited in any way.

159
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,875
So, today, is a New year for you,

160
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,999
I wish you all

161
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,583
and I want you all to make a resolution

162
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,917
From today onwards, I will not tell lies, never ever lie".

163
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:22,959
Indians are very famous world wide as liars.

164
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,291
I do not know how but our country carries the stamp

165
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,834
of being dishonest.

166
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,000
Great saints, prophets have taken their birth here.

167
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,625
where so many Sufis were born,

168
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:40,999
How can people lie in a place like this?

169
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,041
So today, you have to promise

170
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:45,792
that you will never tell lies,

171
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,417
whatever may be the consequences.

172
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,333
For that you need to have courage.

173
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:55,125
Now that you are realized what more courage is needed?

174
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,959
As it is you can't lie at all.

175
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,959
It’s only when you become like this,

176
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,667
the people will be able to have faith

177
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,625
that you are really truthful people.

178
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,333
So, the Sahaja Yogis have to be truthful.

179
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,375
Whatever may be one's occupation,

180
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:23,458
whatever he may do he may be an Engineer laying roads,

181
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,875
he may be a Doctor treating everyone.

182
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,208
If inspite of all this,

183
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:35,583
if you lie then it would be Hell for you.

184
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:45,041
That is because you are now transformed.

185
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,750
You are now realized.

186
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,959
So when realized people lie

187
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,333
they cannot benefit from it at all.

188
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:03,999
When I go abroad, and often hear people say,

189
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,000
that the people of our country are cheaters,

190
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:11,166
liars and corrupt, I feel very sad.

191
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,792
Today it is very auspicious day for you.

192
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,500
Today let us all make a resolution that

193
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,834
we will never lie, whatever it may be.

194
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,709
I myself am a woman, that too an Indian.

195
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,542
I have never said a lie.

196
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:36,834
By telling lies it would be a loss for you,

197
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,083
you will be put to loss by doing wrong deeds.

198
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:49,291
By doing so, you may be earning more

199
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,667
or cheat more

200
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:58,500
but you cannot go to Heaven, you will go to Hell.

201
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,917
One thing it is very important to know that

202
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:06,750
we have a very bad reputation in the rest of the world.

203
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:09,208
Why the bad reputation?

204
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,291
Because, we are such type of people!

205
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,250
When you come to know that someone is a liar,

206
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:24,083
form an organization and make an enquiry into it.

207
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,709
For example, if a road has been laid

208
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,417
which is not good enough,

209
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:34,250
then enquire about the amount spent in its laying

210
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,458
and what is being done?

211
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,333
The money that is made out of the road

212
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,999
will only be used for drinking and liquor, which is our enemy!

213
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,750
Why do you want to do it?

214
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,583
You are all very well-to-do people.

215
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,041
I have seen many countries where there are poor people

216
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:58,291
but they are very honest.

217
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,542
So honesty should be the foremost quality in you.

218
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,125
Today, make a decision that

219
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,417
we will never be dishonest hereafter.

220
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,625
And we will not remain in the company of dishonest people

221
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,333
and if any one is dishonest we will expose him.

222
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,834
Now it is like this, people will say,

223
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,333
“Mother in the Police force too they are like this

224
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,750
and in other departments too they are like that,"

225
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,583
but you are Sahaja Yogis.

226
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,458
Those who are Sahaja Yogis,

227
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:29,083
are nothing less than any policeman or any person in power.

228
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,333
They are all powerful. But all the powers are of Truth.

229
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,375
Truthfulness should be there

230
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,542
and I am very glad

231
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,709
that a lot of Sahaja Yogis are truthful

232
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,333
but we still need more Sahaja Yogis who are truthful.

233
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,250
Truthfulness has to be there,

234
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,999
otherwise your Agnya chakra will not be cleared.

235
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Agnya, is where the ego resides.

236
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,041
When a person becomes egoistic,

237
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,041
then he commits any kind of mistakes,

238
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:13,500
he criticizes, harms, gets corrupt

239
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,917
all such people will go to hell.

240
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,375
I want to tell you very clearly,

241
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,792
that you should not take to corruption,

242
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,500
you are not dying.

243
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,000
What have you done by earning more?

244
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,417
What are you doing?

245
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,291
You must have put up a few more lights,

246
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:36,083
kept a couple of more women, what more than that?

247
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:41,583
Now, what will be your condition when you go to Hell?

248
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,417
I am discussing all this, on this day of Diwali

249
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,375
because Diwali was celebrated

250
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,834
on the occasion of Sitaji's re-union with Rama.

251
00:17:56,166 --> 00:18:02,542
We can no more be slaves once we embrace chastity.

252
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,999
We are our own slaves and not the slaves of others.

253
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,583
We shall not lie for any reason whatsoever.

254
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,333
I have lived in Delhi for a long time

255
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,709
and am quite surprised at how much they lie.

256
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:22,625
They are not afraid of lying at all.

257
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:26,500
By telling lies openly

258
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:33,000
they might benefit here, they might earn more money,

259
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:38,041
but it is not known that they will not go to Heaven.

260
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,333
I want the Sahaja Yogis to promise that

261
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:45,458
neither will they lie nor will they support the people who lie.

262
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:53,875
People say that our country is very corrupt.

263
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:58,917
Yes, I have been to far off places and

264
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:05,000
I have seen that the Russians are the best amongst them.

265
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,917
They are as it is, half like Sahaja Yogis

266
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,542
and a lot of Sahaja Yogis are there.

267
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,792
This year I was not able to go to Russia,

268
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,625
next year I will definitely go.

269
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,750
This means that

270
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,875
we were not able to implement democracy well,

271
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,000
we too should have been communist.

272
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:32,083
There are no cases of robbery there, no lies

273
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,458
and everyone loves each other.

274
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,083
They respect me a lot.

275
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:44,125
We have to understand where we are going.

276
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:48,125
For the sake of earning more money, to what extent will we go?

277
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,709
What are we going to get?

278
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:55,041
So, honesty should be the foremost quality within you.

279
00:19:56,667 --> 00:20:02,166
Your dishonesty is going to create problems for your own people.

280
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:05,959
People say that the Indians are dishonest.

281
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,000
I feel ashamed to hear this.

282
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:14,500
So many great saints have taken birth over here,

283
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,542
how many great prophets have been over here,

284
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:26,083
and people of this place are great thieves

285
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:32,542
and they steal and criticize

286
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:37,750
your Agnya has been scared of all this from beginning itself.

287
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,875
They want to make huge money;

288
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,917
in the end all these rich people will go to Hell.

289
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:47,375
On this day of Diwali,

290
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,458
I want to tell you all that the meaning of Diwali is that

291
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,542
the Hell is full of darkness and you all are enlightened.

292
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:59,333
You are expected to fight wherever there is darkness

293
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,375
and let them know that they are wrong deeds.

294
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,291
By doing this our country will improve

295
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,291
and you have to do this.

296
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,333
We have been performing poojas and rituals

297
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:16,125
but the Shakti (Divine power) which is there within us,

298
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:21,542
is there to oppose all that is not truthful.

299
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,625
Many people do not know that making money is a sickness.

300
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,375
They will go straight to Hell.

301
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,792
I am telling you all this

302
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,792
because no one has said it like this before.

303
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,083
On the day of Diwali, I am telling you

304
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:44,125
that we are going to light lamps and

305
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,959
celebrate happiness in our hearts.

306
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:51,417
By this we can see what kind of a person one is

307
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,709
is he a person who steals?

308
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,542
As of now too, I can see people fighting with each other.

309
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,458
Quarrels amongst Hindus and Muslims are over now

310
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,667
but fighting with others has started.

311
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,917
That is the second thing- we are quarrelsome too.

312
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:15,542
At least in the other countries

313
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,542
there are not as many religions as we have.

314
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:19,875
So whenever we get a chance, we start fighting,

315
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,291
fighting is the priority.

316
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:29,667
Fighting between husband and wife and then their children and

317
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,125
then if they have someone else with them

318
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,750
they will fight with them too. What is Sahaja Yoga?

319
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,375
Sahaja Yoga is love and only love.

320
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,166
Awaken the power of love which is within us.

321
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:53,875
Today is a very auspicious day

322
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,583
and we have to light the lamps in our heart

323
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,999
and take up the resolution that we may die but we won't lie.

324
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,125
We had great people over here

325
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:12,709
but still Indians are very ill-famed the world over

326
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:16,041
as being very dishonest.

327
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,917
Though I have never seen one of this kind

328
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,583
but whenever I hear of it, I feel very sad.

329
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,667
India is such a holy place

330
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:28,333
where such great saints have taken their birth,

331
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,792
that didn't happen anywhere, also the sufis

332
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,999
were also born here

333
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:39,208
So many great saints were born here in India

334
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,875
No other country had so many saints as in India

335
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,834
there could have been a few

336
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,458
but in India we had great saints

337
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:53,333
that whatever they had taught, leave that.

338
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,458
We have become notorious thieves.

339
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,542
Whoever commits theft, can never go to Heaven.

340
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,834
As compared to the life span spent here,

341
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,458
you will have to spend a thousand times more in the Hell

342
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,083
Today I am talking about hell

343
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,625
because hell means darkness and

344
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,709
we are seeing the spell of darkness everywhere, that of hell.

345
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:29,417
Now, that your lights are lit, try to see who all are in hell.

346
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:38,166
You support the Government by exposing the dishonest.

347
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:41,125
You may be holding a junior or a senior position

348
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:44,875
still you have to expose the one who is a thief

349
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:50,542
Catch the thieves, catch those who are dishonest

350
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,917
Now you have got the powers what is it for?

351
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,709
You have been awakened now what is it for?

352
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,750
You have got enlightenment.

353
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,583
You see yourself in its light.

354
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,667
You have seen nothing in the darkness

355
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:13,417
but see in your light, what you are,

356
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:19,250
and what are you going to achieve by telling lies?

357
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,500
We are family people,

358
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:29,625
we never lie - never - and we can't even lie.

359
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,625
Whenever the situation to lie arises

360
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,875
don't forget that you have the powers, you are the lights,

361
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:42,291
You see, you are the light in this darkness

362
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,834
and keep the lights burning.

363
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,917
We have to end this darkness.

364
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,709
We have a bad reputation for our dishonesty.

365
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:53,750
There is no country as great as ours,

366
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,750
yet it is very sad to know

367
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:00,583
that the people outside have misunderstood us.

368
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:03,959
It is not known what these people achieve by their dishonesty.

369
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,500
What they will get will be horrible!

370
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,291
No one will be spared!

371
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,375
Whoever is dishonest will be caught

372
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,959
and there are arrangements made for it.

373
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:20,125
You have got realization because you are not dishonest,

374
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,709
you love truthfulness and respect it.

375
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,041
I want you all to stand for truth.

376
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:36,875
The people who are throwing clutter in Jamunaji are fools.

377
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:42,083
Jamunaji goes straight down to Hell.

378
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:50,208
But you will be saved from that Hell.

379
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:51,709
You are realized souls.

380
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,291
The one who is enlightened never falls.

381
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:06,417
But if you really want to establish Sahaja Yoga

382
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,291
fully within yourself then you have to first of all decide

383
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,375
never to be dishonest in any way.

384
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:17,750
Earning money is the only business left in this world!

385
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,417
What happens with that?

386
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:23,709
Nobody will even remember them.

387
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:31,875
You have to be truthful if at all you love your country.

388
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:34,792
Otherwise who is going to believe in a liar's love!

389
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:41,333
It is a very tough situation for you

390
00:27:42,417 --> 00:27:44,959
when you see that your neighbour is of such a type

391
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,917
and you think that you too should become like that.

392
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,000
On the contrary why don't you think that we are like this

393
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,709
and why not that neighbour too be made like us.

394
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:57,709
First of all you should promise that you will never be dishonest

395
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,917
nor support any dishonest doers.

396
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:15,125
It is not known - the thriving of liars is a curse of our country!

397
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:19,750
There are many people who will tell at least ten lies

398
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:23,166
from morning till evening, still it won't be enough for them.

399
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,500
Now that your poverty has perished,

400
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,000
all is well, you have everything to eat and drink

401
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,375
and you are not a beggar any more,

402
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,583
then why do you have to lie?

403
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:38,999
So on this day, take this resolution

404
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:40,792
we are not going to lie and if anyone is a liar

405
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,083
then we are not going to support that person,

406
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:45,917
we are not going to establish any connection with him.

407
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,917
There is a lot of peace and happiness in this.

408
00:28:53,792 --> 00:29:00,000
You know a liar will go to Hell

409
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:05,792
and you too will follow him.

410
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,709
God has given you realization,

411
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:10,500
you have been enlightened within.

412
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:15,208
See, in that light, if there are other people like you,

413
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:18,917
you should take a resolution that you will never tell lies

414
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,667
let our heads be cut off, whatever it may be.

415
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:29,208
In this matter the Indians are very much better,

416
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:32,291
I know, but when I hear about them outside

417
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:35,000
then I feel very sad about it.

418
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,625
Now, the way these roads are made,

419
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,709
are they roads in any sense?

420
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,750
I felt as if we were going through some forests.

421
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:50,792
You have an organization so whenever you see such a thing,

422
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,709
you can call for any enquiry who made such type of road?

423
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:58,000
Why he made? Who ate up the money?

424
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:03,417
All the Sahaja yogis should get united

425
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:16,041
and try to drive this bhoot (possession) out of our country.

426
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:23,792
Wherever we go people say, " Don't believe the Indians"

427
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,750
How shameful this is!

428
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:34,667
The people who should be trusted the most are – we Indians.

429
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:39,542
We have had such great leaders,

430
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,208
great saints and great souls over here

431
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:49,709
but we don't think of the name and fame they had,

432
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,125
how much people respected them and they respect you too,

433
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:58,792
but don't support the thieves.

434
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,542
If you know that a particular person is a thief

435
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:05,166
then you don't go to his place to eat,

436
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:10,500
this would become difficult for the thieves.

437
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,125
I am telling you

438
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:16,875
you are the police force of the Divine and

439
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,417
you try to keep a note of all the thieves whom you come across.

440
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,667
Try to instill this courage in your children too.

441
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:31,667
Try to find out about the people who are wrong doers and liars.

442
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:40,709
This country of ours has been awakened by a number of saints

443
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,709
and you all are also saints.

444
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:46,750
There is no need for you to tell lies,

445
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,959
what will happen if you get food only once a day?

446
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,709
No one dies if he doesn't eat.

447
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,458
We people are getting to eat and drink

448
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,750
but on the top of it, we want to drink liquor.

449
00:31:57,083 --> 00:32:01,583
Secondly on drinking liquor we can hardly walk even a step.

450
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,375
On the contrary we get destroyed.

451
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,083
We cannot live well upon the addiction of liquor.

452
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:13,500
Now, for example in America,

453
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,166
they have taken out a new issue, that

454
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:20,709
when a child turns 16 years then he will earn for himself.

455
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:23,458
This means that all are servants.

456
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:28,041
They are given money for whatever work they do; washing vehicles.

457
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:30,709
And at the age of 16 what they say,

458
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:37,083
Sir you are 16 years of age and now you go out

459
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,500
I have seen everywhere,

460
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,375
these poor children who are 16 years of age,

461
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:47,500
we think, that he is just now turning 16 where will he go?

462
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:52,375
What about education? He is of 16 years now!

463
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,583
He is thrown out of his house.

464
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:58,500
He is driven out of the house, both by his father and mother.

465
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:01,333
How long will this continue with the Americans, you just see.

466
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,125
They are getting ruined.

467
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:07,500
By buying one or two aeroplanes, nobody becomes great.

468
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:15,709
Where are you? What is your capacity?

469
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:20,792
India is such a country which can serve the whole world

470
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:33,291
But for that, there should be truthfulness in it.

471
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:39,500
Where is the need for falsehood, I can't understand!

472
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:44,917
Most of the people who are rich should first of all know

473
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:48,583
that you are rich, sit quietly now

474
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:52,208
and don't think of earning more.

475
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,125
I didn't see anyone who became happier through earning more.

476
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:04,291
You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have the light in you.

477
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:10,083
You can see your path in this light and the path is of truth.

478
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:15,667
You may be a Muslim, may be a Hindu or may be a Christian

479
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:20,333
it makes no difference. You are all human beings.

480
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,875
And if human beings do not have honesty in them

481
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:29,667
then they are dishonest. He won't be known to anyone.

482
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:34,917
We have life beyond this too, how would that be?

483
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:39,500
There are many benefits of being honest.

484
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,750
The greatest of all is that

485
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,041
you have the blessing of God with you.

486
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,291
You have the kind of blessings

487
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,083
that you will be surprised to know.

488
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:55,250
Without any efforts all your things are set in order.

489
00:34:55,999 --> 00:35:00,500
But now in India, whatever the condition of the people –

490
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,834
they may have, they may not have, all run after money.

491
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,458
There are still many more poor people

492
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:13,041
and so it should be Diwali celebrations for them also today.

493
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,166
They too should be happy.

494
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,417
We live in the same country.

495
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:22,458
But we deceive ourselves. We are very clever.

496
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:28,417
By this we become egoistic inside.

497
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,166
And by becoming egoistic nobody can save you in any way.

498
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,500
Under the influence of your ego you can get cancer.

499
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:41,792
Then you can't save yourself.

500
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,333
If you have cancer within you then you cannot save yourself.

501
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:48,625
I too cannot save you. I am telling you the fact.

502
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:54,041
Firstly burn your ego in the fire.

503
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:59,000
If you have an ego then you should be ashamed of it.

504
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,333
For what are you having ego?

505
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:05,834
In our country it is for everything.

506
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,834
If some one has done a BA he gets egoistic

507
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:13,875
and if he does something more than that, he gets a double ego.

508
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:17,875
If someone has achieved something,

509
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:20,125
if he becomes an engineer or a doctor

510
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:23,166
then he becomes egoistic.

511
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:25,792
When his Agnya chakra gets caught up

512
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:31,166
where will it take you straight to? To Hell

513
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,333
and hell is a very horrible place.

514
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:40,834
God has given you intelligence and

515
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,291
now you have got your realization.

516
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:48,583
And even after that if you want to go to hell you can go.

517
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,875
Till today nobody has spoken of this.

518
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:59,125
Today is an auspicious day,

519
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:01,750
because many things took place on this day.

520
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:06,250
Sitaji returned during the period of “Ramchandraji”,

521
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:14,083
whatever great deeds were done during the period of “Krishnaji”

522
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,917
were done by people who were realized souls.

523
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:22,458
So the first thing that you decide for sure is

524
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:25,500
that we won't do any dishonest deed at the same time

525
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:29,291
if any one else does then we will get him exposed.

526
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,625
But I am seeing in this country that

527
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,500
the whites are fighting the blacks,

528
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,667
someone is fighting with someone else.

529
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:42,583
They want the country of India to be separated

530
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:45,000
which is not going to be beneficial at all.

531
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:50,166
How can it be beneficial when you are honest

532
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:54,041
and when you have a good character!

533
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,792
Whatever we have learnt from the English people,

534
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,667
there is nothing worth learning from them.

535
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:05,041
They are all in a very bad state now.

536
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:10,750
But we have to save our own country and save the whole world.

537
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,208
It is a great responsibility;

538
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:17,500
you have been given realization, you have been enlightened,

539
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:23,333
still if you want to fall in the ditch then what can anyone do?

540
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:29,750
Everyone should come together and try.

541
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,458
I want the Sahaja Yogis to form a committee

542
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,375
and if you come across any theft

543
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:40,417
then it should be brought to the notice of the committee

544
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:42,999
and then see, what the committee does.

545
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:46,500
In this way you will get fame and

546
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,125
you will reach to a very high position.

547
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,417
So the first thing would be that

548
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:55,834
neither should you be dishonest nor let others to be dishonest.

549
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,166
This is very important.

550
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,792
Your country has been blemished.

551
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,583
In the oil there is adulteration

552
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:08,166
then in the Ghee there is adulteration.

553
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:12,750
Where ever we see, people are laughing at us.

554
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:14,834
No one believes

555
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:17,999
but actually the best of people are in India.

556
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,917
The number of people who have got their realization

557
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,999
is more than anywhere else in the world.

558
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:29,750
They have not earned any virtue.

559
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:34,041
So it is better to earn virtue than to earn money.

560
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,667
See the people who are very poor.

561
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:47,625
So this day is a very auspicious day and also a very joyful day.

562
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:54,208
Why joyful? Because today we have got heaven

563
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,667
and we want to stay in heaven alone.

564
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:02,583
But cowardly people cannot enter the Heaven.

565
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,999
There is no need to be afraid.

566
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,709
If you get a couple of rupees more or less

567
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,792
which disaster is going to befall upon you?

568
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,333
All have become rich. I have been seeing.

569
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,000
I have been coming here for the past 17-18 years now.

570
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,834
You have become richer than before.

571
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:27,750
The situation is better than before.

572
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:29,999
But from morning to evening

573
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,375
there is dishonesty, dishonesty and dishonesty.

574
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:36,667
So the path has been made.

575
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:43,125
So, today just promise that, we are not going to be dishonest

576
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:47,959
and if anybody is, then we all will unitedly oppose.

577
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,709
Why have you been given Sahaja Yoga?

578
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,999
Why have you been given realization?

579
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:57,083
So that you can spread light, if you have no light internally

580
00:40:57,417 --> 00:40:59,959
then how can you spread light outside?

581
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:05,583
And with that light you see, you are helping the dishonest?

582
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:11,458
Nothing will happen if you earn a little less or more.

583
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:16,208
If you are honest then God will help you!

584
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,125
Why are so many people dying in our country?

585
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:23,834
Nowhere else they die, so many of them.

586
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:26,041
The reason is that they have to go to Hell.

587
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,250
So, you have to know this that if you are dishonest

588
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:36,583
then your first step to Hell is already over and

589
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:42,333
then the second step of telling lies will not be necessary.

590
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:44,750
You tell the truth.

591
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:53,792
The person who will tell the truth would be a unique person.

592
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:59,917
If he is a Sahaja Yogi then it would be the best.

593
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,542
The way people are remembering the sufis,

594
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:05,667
the same way people are going to remember you.

595
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:08,083
You don't have to do anything.

596
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:11,834
Just catch hold of those who are dishonest

597
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:17,166
it is very much necessary.

598
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,125
Here people are fighting

599
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:21,750
to stop the rubbish from being thrown into Jamunaji

600
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,709
this too needs to be told!

601
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:26,458
I have been to so many countries!

602
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,750
nobody throws waste into the river.

603
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:35,625
Why are you so lazy? There are so many facilities over here.

604
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:41,750
You can give the waste to the Municipality.

605
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,375
Dispose somewhere, but if you yourself throw waste

606
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,375
then what can one do?

607
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,750
Today all of you decide in your mind and take a resolution

608
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,208
it is a very auspicious day today, very auspicious day, that

609
00:42:57,166 --> 00:43:01,625
“We won't do any dishonest deed nor will we believe in dishonesty”

610
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,375
I have seen people who were neither dishonest

611
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:10,625
nor did they go to the house of people who were dishonest.

612
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:13,500
They had nothing to do with them

613
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,333
because they were concerned not only about their own welfare

614
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:20,291
but also the welfare of the whole country.

615
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:24,166
So you are a Sahaja Yogi,

616
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,166
so you need to make a promise

617
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:29,500
that we are not going to do any thing dishonest.

618
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:35,458
You just recognise a person who is dishonest

619
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,834
and then tell your inner soul that he is dishonest.

620
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:48,333
And, Sahaja Yogis, even if twelve Sahaja Yogis come together

621
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:52,125
and if they come to know that he is dishonest

622
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,709
then the Divine will be there to support.

623
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,750
This country won't benefit by a few rich people,

624
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:09,583
but it will definitely benefit by honest people.

625
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:13,125
The greatest stigma that has been put on us

626
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,000
is that we are dishonest.

627
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:18,083
Those who are Sahaja Yogis can never be dishonest.

628
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:30,125
We all have to be united, leaving aside all quarrels

629
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:33,250
and assumptions that we are honest people.

630
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,999
India's image is very much tarnished,

631
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,709
hence take a vow today that from now onwards

632
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,500
we shall not be dishonest and

633
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:52,999
if there are any dishonest people we shall all get after him

634
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:57,458
Next day he will be unable to sleep in peace

635
00:45:01,834 --> 00:45:03,875
But this has increased too much.

636
00:45:04,792 --> 00:45:07,166
I am astonished at the level of dishonesty,

637
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:11,542
dishonesty in everything, dishonesty in everything.

638
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:17,291
Earlier they used to outcast on every minor issue and

639
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:23,000
they used to separate themselves for even very minor things.

640
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:30,875
But our country was so honest, it had such nice qualities.

641
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:37,250
Have we forgotten them? Where have they gone?

642
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:45,333
I can see dishonesty everywhere, dishonesty at every step.

643
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:51,959
We have to teach the children that they should not be dishonest.

644
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,667
Yes, if they are dying with hunger,

645
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,999
then arrangements can be made for that too,

646
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,750
but only if he is honest.

647
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:09,458
If you are not honest then nobody can help you, not even God.

648
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:12,333
He will get all kinds of diseases of the world.

649
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,792
There are many such traditions in our country

650
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:22,999
they will drink liquor, drink wine.

651
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:29,917
Tell me, have you come here to become a fool?

652
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:36,041
And don't be a friend of one who does it. Don't help them.

653
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:40,417
I have seen people who go to the houses of people

654
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:46,250
who drink liquor, then they too start taking liquor.

655
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:48,834
But when you know

656
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,667
that a person is of such a character,

657
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:55,250
when you know that he is dishonest, then,

658
00:46:55,709 --> 00:47:00,625
stop eating at his place. You have nothing to do with him.

659
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:04,375
We have to work for the well being of our country

660
00:47:04,709 --> 00:47:06,709
because God has given us light. See in that light.

661
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:11,709
His power is tremendous.

662
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:18,875
If you decide that, those who are dishonest to the nation

663
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:24,333
will be taken care by God, then that alone is enough.

664
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:28,083
But you are turning deaf. You are not able to understand.

665
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,667
Such a person can never do any good deed;

666
00:47:33,709 --> 00:47:35,417
nor can he ever give.

667
00:47:36,709 --> 00:47:41,500
I cannot understand how they live so shamelessly.

668
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:50,000
So, that is why today's message is that

669
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,959
you have to take a vow that

670
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:57,417
we are not going to be dishonest in any way and

671
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,500
if any one is dishonest then we are not going to support him.

672
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:03,625
That is enough.

673
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:08,250
Many more realized souls will come to our country.

674
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:12,542
But who would like to come to such a dishonest country?

675
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:16,250
So today the only message is that

676
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:21,375
you have light and if you walk in that light,

677
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
it will give you strength.

678
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:27,750
You can do whatever you want to do.

679
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:33,000
Look, we have achieved our “Swatantra”.

680
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:37,750
“Swatantra” is the mechanism of understanding oneself.

681
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,792
Now I want a lot of realized children to be born ,

682
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:51,792
so learn that it is a very great day today,

683
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:54,458
take a vow today

684
00:48:55,417 --> 00:49:01,208
that neither will we be dishonest nor support the dishonest.

685
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:04,333
Not even be scared of them;

686
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:07,583
God is not with them at all. God is with you.

687
00:49:10,834 --> 00:49:15,000
If you are good then God is with you.

688
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:19,583
All the people had taken birth on this very land of India

689
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,250
not for the sake of fighting,

690
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:26,917
dying amongst yourselves, great fools!

691
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,750
We are fighting, dying,

692
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:32,917
there is no benefit in fighting, tell the people.

693
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:36,875
“Oh! why are you fighting? What do you want?

694
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:43,750
After all you have nice things to eat and drink,

695
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:46,125
what more do you want?”

696
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:49,291
But nowadays what is most prevalent is that ,

697
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:50,959
we want such and such clothes,

698
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:56,375
we want such type of a house and we don't have that,

699
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,959
with all that we will only go to hell.

700
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:07,709
In those times there were many who were sufis,

701
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:12,625
like them you are all sufis, because you are all cleansed.

702
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:18,999
Now all of you write the poem of honesty.

703
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,458
This dishonesty has got to go, that is the first thing

704
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:31,709
and secondly there are many issues which need to be corrected.

705
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:35,500
But see, first of all don't be dishonest

706
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:42,959
No one is so poor in India that we have to resort to dishonesty.

707
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,625
I am saying that our country is tarnished.

708
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:50,250
This needs to be wiped off.

709
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,625
You are Sahaja Yogis and you can do it.

710
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,542
You have light, with this light

711
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:03,625
you can spread the light everywhere

712
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,375
and give courage to all, that its alright.

713
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:11,959
Particularly those of you who are young, who are friends

714
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:16,417
have to think what all honest deeds you can do.

715
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:21,375
Now they have started – don't throw rubbish into “Jamunaji”.

716
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,375
That is alright but it is not so important.

717
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,917
What is important is to get rid of dishonesty.

718
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,750
That is why this day is considered auspicious everywhere.

719
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:39,542
Lamps are lit all around.

720
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:44,583
In spite of everything if we can't do this

721
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:48,417
then what is the benefit of Sahaja Yoga?

722
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:56,417
The largest number of Sahaja yogis are in India.

723
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:07,500
Then comes Russia. Now, the Russian people are very polite.

724
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:12,750
They do no commit any robberies. I don't know why?

725
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:17,208
May be if communism comes to India

726
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:20,125
then we too might become like them;

727
00:52:20,542 --> 00:52:22,875
but that is not a very great thing.

728
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:27,000
If somebody does something out of compulsion

729
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:29,166
then it is not good.

730
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:31,834
Decide that we should be powerful ourselves.

731
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:38,000
Today you decide, today is a very auspicious day that

732
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:43,250
neither will you be dishonest nor let others be dishonest.

733
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,458
Your country will then prosper a lot.

734
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,667
I have seen what other countries are and how its people are

735
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:00,834
all are useless people.

736
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:07,667
But the people of our country are still religious

737
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:14,542
Religiousness will perish in our country

738
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:17,458
if these dishonest people become so powerful.

739
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:20,542
So the only message is that

740
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:25,959
neither will we be dishonest nor will we allow others to do so.

741
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:33,458
But the people here are very tolerant in this matter.

742
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,999
They tolerate, this is their greatest mistake.

743
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:41,417
When you have got the light, why are you scared?

744
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:45,083
What is the need for you to be afraid?

745
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:55,000
That is why I am requesting you today, be courageous

746
00:53:55,959 --> 00:53:58,166
and now one kind of liberation has been achieved.

747
00:53:58,667 --> 00:53:59,999
You will achieve “swatantra”,

748
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,041
the “tantra” (Mechanism) of “swa”(Oneself),

749
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:08,667
you have achieved it. But make use of it.

750
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,875
Today, you are so many people gathered here.

751
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:18,375
I have never seen so many in Delhi.

752
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:30,500
So, today you all decide within yourself

753
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:35,834
that you are not going to believe any dishonest people

754
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:40,208
and all the devils take birth

755
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:44,166
for this very reason that we have something in us

756
00:54:44,709 --> 00:54:47,625
which makes them think that we will believe them.

757
00:54:48,709 --> 00:54:51,375
Indians should never believe

758
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:57,291
and the ones who are realized should never at all.

759
00:54:59,834 --> 00:55:02,667
There is one great aspersion on our country everywhere

760
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,834
which is not true. India has many people who are honest

761
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:11,709
many and this aspersion is not true.

762
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:16,166
I have also seen this,

763
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,834
They will fight this land is ours and that land is yours.

764
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:28,333
Whatever you have is swaraja, kingdom of oneself

765
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:31,125
one's own kingdom.

766
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:33,959
You will have kingdom of your own

767
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:38,041
when you would become swatantra in the true sense.

768
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:44,458
There is no need to fear anyone no need to tell anyone.

769
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:53,583
I am surprised to see so many people.

770
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:55,834
I had never seen so many people in Delhi.

771
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:12,542
So, my only request to you on this auspicious day is that

772
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,667
we should decide, we should never be dishonest,

773
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,750
even if we have to die.

774
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:21,875
Our country has deteriorated in the last ten years.

775
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:28,709
You are so many Sahaja yogis. What are you afraid of?

776
00:56:32,959 --> 00:56:34,625
What is the issue to be scared of?

777
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:41,417
The Divine is there behind everyone.

778
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:51,208
When the Sufis came to know

779
00:56:52,959 --> 00:56:55,250
that the divine was there with them

780
00:56:56,041 --> 00:57:00,834
they got rid of all unwanted things from this world.

781
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:08,000
Not all sufis but a few did. So you all have to do it.

782
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:14,041
So the message for today is that

783
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:19,583
you yourself should never be a thief nor support any thief.

784
00:57:20,709 --> 00:57:26,208
But I am seeing people fighting on more and more issues,

785
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:32,458
fighting on issues of caste and religion.

786
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:36,999
Are you here to save the country or to get drowned?

787
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:41,750
You have a great responsibility.

788
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:44,458
You have been born in Kaliyuga.

789
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:48,208
This kaliyuga has to be changed

790
00:57:49,917 --> 00:57:53,333
and that is why so many thousands of you are realized.

791
00:57:53,792 --> 00:57:58,417
So many people were never realized anywhere else in the world.

792
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,999
That is why I am requesting you again and again

793
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:08,458
that always stand on Truth and I will be there with you.

794
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:21,667
God is also with you.

795
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:29,000
So the request to you all is to firmly decide within yourself

796
00:58:29,834 --> 00:58:33,375
that we are not going to allow any theft, robberies

797
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:40,083
and wherever we find them we will fight it.

798
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:45,000
But the people seem to be drunk or what?

799
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:55,333
What did they achieve from this light? Courage.

800
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,083
Fight with courage.

801
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:02,083
Whatever is wrong should be removed from this country.

802
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:10,208
It is very tarnished, still there are many more issues

803
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:12,625
but the most important one is that

804
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:17,834
if there is no honesty then how can God help you?

805
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:21,875
Earning money is of no use to God.

806
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:26,375
But getting your religion is and that you have achieved.

807
00:59:27,834 --> 00:59:30,375
There are not so many Sahaja yogis in this world

808
00:59:32,959 --> 00:59:35,458
and then Sahaja yogis don't do such deeds.

809
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:37,834
But I am telling you all this because

810
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,959
the atmosphere here is very bad

811
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,625
and we people have such a bad name everywhere.

812
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,083
You have everything to eat and drink, clothes to dress,

813
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:56,792
what else do you want?

814
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:05,709
You watch movies, you do have that much money.

815
01:00:07,999 --> 01:00:13,000
But the addiction for money which is there should be got rid off.

816
01:00:16,792 --> 01:00:20,875
I have full hope that you will heed my words.

817
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:29,542
So we should take a vow that we will not be dishonest

818
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:34,375
and we would oppose the people who are dishonest.

819
01:00:49,709 --> 01:00:52,291
Understand that the greatest thing

820
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:55,709
that our country needs today is honesty.

821
01:00:59,667 --> 01:01:03,667
There is nothing greater than that. Honesty is your mother.

822
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,375
So what if you have one shirt in the place of ten?

823
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,792
Tell the ladies also the same thing.

824
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,417
It will happen. It will take place.

825
01:01:17,999 --> 01:01:22,417
Today's speech is a little different, it is unique

826
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:33,417
and it is very gracious of you all to have liked it.

827
01:01:38,834 --> 01:01:41,542
Thank you.
