00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.119
his musicians all of them are so young

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.789
we must have seen and one is a blind

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.019
fellow and with realization they became

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.570
so dynamic so now they want to play for

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.140
me and sing for me because they got it

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.689
too you see

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.120
and the one who has composed it was a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.280
chartered accountant he never knew and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.430
is any do or renew

00:00:35.280 --> 00:01:03.660
I mean political language but he's

00:00:38.430 --> 00:01:06.479
become appointed emotional music and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.939
musical devotional music is sung by

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.170
people who are realized Souls reaches

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:19.890
your heart reaches your Kundalini and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.450
helps a lot awaken them so if there are

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.869
these are all realized Souls so where

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.130
there the dancer everybody the dancer

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.259
was playing the rhythm and the rhythm it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.360
is a divine rhythm because she is now

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.780
become a realized soul she's connected

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.240
with the divine so when she dances she

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.170
creates her divine rhythm and when these

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.420
people sing

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.850
they also sing a divine devotion

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.640
otherwise without connection if you sing

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.009
the praise of God it doesn't reach God

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.619
because you are not connected like a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.780
telephone which is not connected if you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.329
start telephoning your telephone gets

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.310
spot so for devotion also you should be

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.890
connected with God so as they're

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.869
connected with the divine the music

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.970
image

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.910
vibrations what to call the divine

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.370
vibration as a result it creates an

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.920
atmosphere for people to receive the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.170
realization it becomes much easier for

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.500
me to give realization because that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.010
masseur cleanser rinses out and people

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.950
also get ready for realization because

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.280
they're realized Souls all of them so

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.720
this is the reason why I was very happy

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.000
they could manage to come they're all

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.780
professionals and they have agreed to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.590
come here and do it further just to help

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.989
me in sahaja yoga and also you will be

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.580
surprised that this music is very

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.220
difficult indeed music is a very

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.470
difficult music it's not easy for people

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.030
to sing unless until you go into big

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.940
practices but it's so amazing that when

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.790
people get realization all these people

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.310
who are Western are people from 40

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.489
countries they all can sing these songs

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.160
with same depth and with same

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.890
understanding without making any

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.549
mistakes even in pronunciation otherwise

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.630
it is so difficult to pronounce a state

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.959
even Indian language is so difficult

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.500
that they could not even pronounce a one

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.780
sentence property and now the whole song

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.090
is has to song any song this thing's

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.560
over and you if you close your eyes you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.540
won't believe that they are foreigners

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.350
who are singing who have never known

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.940
this language so something has gone

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.380
dynamically new in them that they just

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.380
pick it up and sing so well

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:54.910
of course very much music is is is a

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.220
divine gift to human beings it's a

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.760
divine we call it starts with Omkara

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.830
means the first word is that was we call

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.230
as locusts it starts with that and

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.360
that's that's a proof of it because the

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.880
when they get their realization how is

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.720
it they know such difficult language and

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.989
such difficult tunes and so correctly as

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.600
they can see it's very surprising so

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.010
music is a very inner part dancing music

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.560
all art is very kind much connected with

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.270
the divine now we have had many artists

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.840
who have been realized Souls because a

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.920
Michelangelo was a realized soul and the

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:41.260
way he painted hence it emits vibrations

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:43.570
you see if you see Mona Lisa and by they

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.990
are not of the wind say it has

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.090
vibrations it gives you abrasions those

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.400
people who were realized Souls like

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.800
Mozart when you play Mozart you get

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.620
vibrations out of it you can feel them

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:01.110
on your fingertips you can feel so there

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.110
are musicians who are realized Souls

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.210
also artists also people like Abraham

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.420
Lincoln was a realized soul Gorbachev is

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.520
realized so he's also a sage so when

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.290
these people are there how will you make

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.090
them out and she was asking me you have

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.320
to just put your hands towards them and

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.320
you can feel it
