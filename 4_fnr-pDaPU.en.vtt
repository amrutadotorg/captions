00:00:05.113 --> 00:00:08.433
Mother, if only You can advise us regarding food.

00:00:08.593 --> 00:00:10.793
Regarding what?

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:13.979
Whatever food should be taken.

00:00:14.153 --> 00:00:18.666
In Sahaja Yoga we do not pay much attention to food.

00:00:18.793 --> 00:00:22.112
Only thing I feel that,

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:25.912
so much attention has been paid to food.

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:28.432
It's not a correct attitude.

00:00:28.553 --> 00:00:32.872
You see, the Spirit doesn’t eat at all,

00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:38.232
it’s a detached thing. Atma is beyond.

00:00:38.353 --> 00:00:44.072
Now when we try to say that, if we eat this kind of food,

00:00:44.193 --> 00:00:52.312
Atma will be happy, that kind of, Atma will be happy, is not true.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.752
For example we’ll say vegetarianism,

00:00:54.873 --> 00:00:58.952
which is a very common problem with people is.

00:00:59.073 --> 00:01:02.633
You’ll be amazed, all the false gurus are vegetarians;

00:01:02.873 --> 00:01:06.432
one by one, Mahesh yogi, Rajneesh...

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:12.192
Rajneesh is a great vedge. He doesn’t even eat garlic and onions.

00:01:12.313 --> 00:01:14.352
This Mahesh yogi’s disciples,

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:17.752
if you show them a garlic, they’ll jump, 100 times.

00:01:17.873 --> 00:01:24.847
They are afraid of the garlic! Can you imagine?

00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:30.352
But I don’t say that you eat meat, that’s not the point is.

00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:35.512
But those people, whatever they require they should eat,

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:42.312
but don’t eat meats of animals which are bigger than you.

00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:45.112
Now what happens?

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:48.072
How the evolution in the animals takes place?

00:01:48.193 --> 00:01:51.272
Nobody has put attention to that.

00:01:51.393 --> 00:01:53.913
Supposing there are many chickens you save.

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:57.232
I am not going to give Realization to chickens, am I?

00:01:58.392 --> 00:02:02.472
Or to bugs, am I going to give Realization? Or to mosquitoes?

00:02:02.593 --> 00:02:07.672
So our attention is on these, not on the higher level of life.

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:10.912
When we think of food, that we must save chickens

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:15.279
actually nothing dies. Is Krishna Himself has said ‘Nothing dies’.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.159
All right?

00:02:18.353 --> 00:02:20.233
And that’s how some people denied Krishna,

00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:24.272
because He had a samhara shakti, He used to kill.

00:02:24.393 --> 00:02:29.712
And killing is so important in evolution.
Otherwise if you don’t kill these rakshasas,

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:33.912
are you going to adore them?
What are you to do with them?

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:37.352
They are to be killed they are to be thrown out.

00:02:37.473 --> 00:02:41.432
In the evolutionary process also,

00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:45.992
so many things have to die out for the real thing to come up.

00:02:46.113 --> 00:02:50.072
Say this flower has to die to become the fruit, all right?

00:02:50.193 --> 00:02:53.392
And there is no ‘hinsa’ in it.

00:02:53.513 --> 00:02:56.033
The word ‘hinsa’ is so misinterpreted

00:02:56.233 --> 00:03:01.832
that people are satisfied, if they do not eat meat. It's not true.

00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:05.872
For some people it is essential they must eat meat.

00:03:05.993 --> 00:03:11.352
Now as you know, Sahaja Yoga works on the power of shakti.

00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:16.272
And the Devi not only killed raskshasas but She ate them!

00:03:16.393 --> 00:03:18.433
And She drank the blood

00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:22.392
of these rakshasas as you know, Raktabija’s.

00:03:22.513 --> 00:03:25.740
So how can She be vegetarian?

00:03:26.953 --> 00:03:31.552
Just tell Me. Put reason.
All right?

00:03:31.673 --> 00:03:34.912
Because we are conditioned that way, we think.

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:40.512
But actually what happens, in the evolutionary process,

00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:45.632
when a person, say, eats chicken,

00:03:45.753 --> 00:03:49.992
not person, we should say, a higher animal,

00:03:50.113 --> 00:03:54.152
eats a lower animal, then it passes through the circle

00:03:54.273 --> 00:03:56.312
and achieves a higher life.

00:03:56.433 --> 00:04:01.352
It's absolutely this is how evolution takes place.

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:04.992
Of course, we can give Realization

00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:07.073
to human beings so we need not worry about that.

00:04:07.273 --> 00:04:10.872
That’s a different point. But,

00:04:10.993 --> 00:04:14.272
if you eat chicken, you definitely give it a higher life.

00:04:14.393 --> 00:04:16.672
But not the animals which are bigger than you.

00:04:16.793 --> 00:04:20.872
Smaller animals, if you eat, it’s

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:24.152
not going to be harmed by that. No doubt.

00:04:24.273 --> 00:04:25.633
But you may be harmed.

00:04:25.793 --> 00:04:31.274
For example, if you eat mosquitoes, you’ll be harmed!

00:04:32.273 --> 00:04:36.232
Now in countries where there is not even any vegetable or anything,

00:04:36.353 --> 00:04:38.592
they have not seen green leaves, like Greenland.

00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:44.537
Now the name is ‘Greenland’, they have never seen green colour!

00:04:44.713 --> 00:04:51.872
Are they sinners that they can’t live without eating meat?

00:04:51.993 --> 00:04:56.952
How can God be so partial?

00:04:57.073 --> 00:05:01.432
There are many countries where they cannot live without eating meat.

00:05:01.553 --> 00:05:05.792
So, there must be some reason. All right? So reason it out.

00:05:05.913 --> 00:05:10.432
If you eat vegetables, all right.

00:05:10.553 --> 00:05:12.832
If you want to eat meat, it’s all right.

00:05:12.953 --> 00:05:18.032
But again for a Sahaja Yogi, what we decide is not

00:05:18.153 --> 00:05:21.592
on what you like, but what is good for you.

00:05:21.713 --> 00:05:25.592
For example, for Western people it is better that they don’t eat

00:05:25.713 --> 00:05:27.793
much meat now because, I think

00:05:27.913 --> 00:05:31.312
they and their fathers have eaten all that.

00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:35.192
Eat less. There should have more carbohydrates, while

00:05:35.313 --> 00:05:37.392
the vegetarians should take more proteins.

00:05:37.513 --> 00:05:40.272
If they do not like meat they should take to other proteins,

00:05:40.393 --> 00:05:42.753
because proteins are very important.

00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:46.312
If you do not take proteins in life, people suffer.

00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:51.632
In Sahaja Yoga we find such people have trouble from Left Nabhi.

00:05:51.753 --> 00:05:54.513
I have seen in India, many people, who are strict vegetarians,

00:05:54.673 --> 00:05:56.832
have a problem of Left Nabhi.

00:05:56.953 --> 00:06:01.153
So we told them, all right, you can eat proteins.
There are so many proteins you can eat.

00:06:01.273 --> 00:06:03.953
If you don’t like to eat meat from childhood, you have not eaten,

00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:06.992
you don’t feel like eating, all right, forget it. Eat some.

00:06:07.113 --> 00:06:10.512
We have to be wise, we have to be open,

00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:16.152
we are not to be bound by our conditioning from childhood.

00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:18.232
This we must understand,

00:06:18.353 --> 00:06:21.352
that vegetarianism is not going to take you to God,

00:06:21.473 --> 00:06:25.232
neither non-vegetarianism.

00:06:25.353 --> 00:06:29.352
Because the Spirit is neither a vegetarian nor a non-vegetarian.

00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:32.592
It is a detached thing, it’s above food.

00:06:32.713 --> 00:06:36.752
But whatever you need for your body is important.

00:06:36.873 --> 00:06:39.072
If you need protein, eat protein.

00:06:39.193 --> 00:06:42.192
If you don’t eat protein, don’t eat protein,

00:06:42.313 --> 00:06:46.232
but then eat something which you need.

00:06:46.353 --> 00:06:51.432
So it is not that one has to understand it

00:06:51.553 --> 00:06:57.472
in a way that we understand as a chicken and vegetables,

00:06:57.593 --> 00:06:59.792
but we must understand

00:06:59.913 --> 00:07:04.072
in the way a doctor understands, proteins and carbohydrates.

00:07:04.193 --> 00:07:08.112
All right? Whatever you like, you can eat.

00:07:08.233 --> 00:07:13.672
There’s no, in Sahaja Yoga there’s no such a compulsion.

00:07:13.793 --> 00:07:16.232
So many saints used to eat meat.

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:21.112
So many saints. Guru Nanaka, Kabira, Mohammed-sahib,

00:07:21.233 --> 00:07:24.912
Christ, Rama Himself, Krishna Himself.

00:07:25.033 --> 00:07:29.632
All of them ate meat. Even Buddha ate meat.

00:07:29.753 --> 00:07:33.352
The proof is that, at the end of His life,

00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:38.752
He went to one of His disciples who was a hunter,

00:07:38.873 --> 00:07:42.272
and He told him, “I am very hungry, give Me something to eat.”

00:07:42.393 --> 00:07:44.553
So he said “Sir, I have nothing else but a wild boar

00:07:44.753 --> 00:07:47.313
which I have killed very recently

00:07:47.513 --> 00:07:49.952
and it is not yet fully cooked.”

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.432
So he said, “All right, doesn’t matter I’ll have it,”

00:07:52.553 --> 00:07:56.272
And He ate it and He died because of that

00:07:56.393 --> 00:08:01.632
half-cooked wild boar.

00:08:01.753 --> 00:08:03.553
And He died with that.

00:08:03.793 --> 00:08:07.113
So now Buddhists think that, “We should not eat meat.” It’s not so.

00:08:07.313 --> 00:08:10.672
Because He ate something that was half-cooked,

00:08:10.793 --> 00:08:12.473
That means He did eat, isn’t it?

00:08:12.673 --> 00:08:17.432
Even Jains know that, it’s only Neminath

00:08:17.553 --> 00:08:21.353
who got a kind of a feeling against meat eating.

00:08:21.553 --> 00:08:23.833
That was Neminath, was at the time of,

00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:26.912
he was contemporary of Shri Krishna.

00:08:27.033 --> 00:08:30.073
When his marriage was celebrated he found many birds

00:08:30.273 --> 00:08:32.872
were killed and he felt terrible about it

00:08:32.993 --> 00:08:36.352
and he didn’t want to eat any meat. Was all right.

00:08:36.473 --> 00:08:38.872
It’s all right. If you don’t feel like, don’t eat it.

00:08:38.993 --> 00:08:41.472
But then a cult started.

00:08:41.593 --> 00:08:46.072
But that means till Neminath, means, Jainis are ancient people,

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:51.792
till Neminath they were eating meat – is a fact.

00:08:51.913 --> 00:08:55.072
So to get attached to some idea

00:08:55.193 --> 00:08:58.832
is not the way you are doing it.

00:08:58.953 --> 00:09:01.512
If you don’t want to eat, just don’t eat it.

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:06.272
And if somebody has to eat it, because of health purposes

00:09:06.393 --> 00:09:10.512
or because of the need, there’s nothing wrong in it.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.632
Everybody has a different need,

00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:16.432
every individual has a different need

00:09:16.553 --> 00:09:19.673
If I, personally, take just to vegetarian food,

00:09:19.794 --> 00:09:21.992
I won’t exist I can tell you.

00:09:22.113 --> 00:09:29.472
Because I have such a great capacity to have purges.

00:09:29.593 --> 00:09:31.593
If I meet somebody, shake hands with somebody,

00:09:31.793 --> 00:09:33.832
he has lots of bhoots you see,

00:09:33.953 --> 00:09:39.992
then I just clear him out by purging.

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:43.473
And if I take just to say, carbohydrates,

00:09:43.593 --> 00:09:45.473
I don’t know what will happen to Me.

00:09:45.673 --> 00:09:49.073
But doesn’t mean that I should be a meat eater,

00:09:49.273 --> 00:09:52.352
but I have to have proteins. That’s the point is.

00:09:52.473 --> 00:09:55.432
It’s no question of meat or anything but this is question

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:59.872
of eating proteins or carbohydrates.

00:09:59.993 --> 00:10:01.793
We have to be wise about it.

00:10:01.914 --> 00:10:03.952
And all such cults you see,

00:10:04.073 --> 00:10:07.752
that “You eat this, you eat that”, is not so.

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:09.513
There is no cult in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:09.673 --> 00:10:13.272
Every individual has a different personality,

00:10:13.393 --> 00:10:18.392
but, the common thing is one, and that is the Spirit.

00:10:18.513 --> 00:10:23.953
But for example, drinking, we abhor.

00:10:24.153 --> 00:10:27.312
But after Realization, before that I don’t talk of drinking.

00:10:27.433 --> 00:10:31.072
Because it goes against your chaitanya, means your awareness.

00:10:31.193 --> 00:10:34.592
So one has to look after the awareness.

00:10:34.713 --> 00:10:37.952
So much time has been wasted in people in

00:10:38.073 --> 00:10:39.553
deciding what to eat what not to eat.

00:10:39.753 --> 00:10:42.232
What have they achieved? Nothing!

00:10:42.353 --> 00:10:46.672
Sometimes I have seen vegetarians can be horrid people.

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:53.072
Absolutely horrid. We have a community in India called Marwadis.

00:10:53.193 --> 00:10:57.872
They are blood suckers you see, and they are vegetarians.

00:10:57.993 --> 00:11:03.152
Not all, we have some in Sahaja Yoga also, very few.

00:11:03.273 --> 00:11:09.312
They are extremely money-minded people, you know that.

00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:12.273
So, this kind of thing, to believe that

00:11:12.473 --> 00:11:15.593
such food will make us great is, will be falsehood.

00:11:15.793 --> 00:11:17.433
So you don’t decide on that.

00:11:17.553 --> 00:11:20.872
You decide on proteins and carbohydrates.

00:11:20.993 --> 00:11:25.392
Whatever good for your health, you should do.

00:11:25.513 --> 00:11:29.432
Those who eat too much of vegetarian food

00:11:29.553 --> 00:11:31.793
are liable to certain type of diseases

00:11:31.953 --> 00:11:37.432
and those who eat too much of non-veg are liable to some.

00:11:37.553 --> 00:11:43.272
Those who eat vegetarian food can get leucoderma very easily,

00:11:43.393 --> 00:11:49.712
can get leukemia very easily.

00:11:49.833 --> 00:11:53.592
Certain types of cancers they can get very easily.

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.913
Those who are non-vegetarians can get another kind of diseases.

00:11:57.113 --> 00:11:59.792
There are numerous diseases they can get.

00:11:59.913 --> 00:12:02.632
So we have to have a balance,

00:12:02.753 --> 00:12:06.033
that when we eat vegetarian food also, we must see that we eat

00:12:06.233 --> 00:12:11.392
sufficiently, sufficient amount of proteins,

00:12:11.513 --> 00:12:14.432
because body has to be all right.

00:12:14.553 --> 00:12:18.993
Healthy body is the temple of God,

00:12:19.193 --> 00:12:24.206
and to temple of God, you have to keep it healthy and happy.
