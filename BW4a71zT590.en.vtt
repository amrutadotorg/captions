00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.530
TC from Amruta 21-12-2016

00:00:01.286 --> 00:00:05.992
I see in My own country when they were fighting for freedom,

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:10.414
My father himself gave up all his property,

00:00:10.534 --> 00:00:16.724
gave up his practice, with eleven children in the family.

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:21.641
And we were living in palaces, started living in huts,

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.471
for days together, for years together.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.475
But for the gross freedom we'll do anything,

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.763
but for the subtler freedom

00:00:30.883 --> 00:00:34.886
the Sahaja Yogis have to do everything that is possible.

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:39.144
So, the first thing is to realize, to be aware,

00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:44.368
to be in your conscious mind all the time that you are yogis.

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:49.012
You are the ones who are very much higher

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:52.397
than the rest of the humanity.

00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:59.276
That the salvation of the whole of humanity depends on you.

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:04.461
The purpose of creation will be served by you.

00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:06.980
So, first of all you have to be conscious

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.521
in your consciousness that you are so important,

00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:14.961
and that's why you were given Realization.

00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:18.270
How can you be living with your conditionings

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.349
and with your ego?

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.385
The conditionings are like this:

00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:25.332
Supposing you are coming from a Christian religion,

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.556
then you must bring that

00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:30.567
little bit of that religion into Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:32.704
Or if you are from a Hindu religion,

00:01:32.824 --> 00:01:35.255
you want to bring some out of that.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:39.486
We have all the essences of these in Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:39.607 --> 00:01:44.233
the pure essences; but we can't have the gross nonsense.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.261
All these things are like dirt over

00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:56.892
our Sahasrara which must be shaken off.

00:01:57.012 --> 00:01:59.388
Though now you are aware,

00:01:59.508 --> 00:02:04.474
you are aware and conscious of your chakras,

00:02:04.594 --> 00:02:07.844
you do not keep them clean.

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:11.188
Ordinary human beings if they have clothes,

00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:14.897
they have houses, they try to keep them clean.

00:02:15.437 --> 00:02:17.499
But you do not feel ashamed of them

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.563
also when they are bad,

00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:23.566
because after some time

00:02:23.686 --> 00:02:27.156
you also loose the awareness of them.

00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:30.733
That means you have become subtler,

00:02:30.853 --> 00:02:36.405
but in your consciousness you are not yet subtle.

00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:42.063
There are so many things you know more

00:02:42.443 --> 00:02:47.190
than the people who are not realized,

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:50.881
as absolute reality.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.345
For example: We don't even use vibrations.

00:02:56.147 --> 00:02:59.058
Whenever it is needed, we don't use it.

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:03.251
Or sometimes mechanically, just like a machine,

00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:06.342
we start giving bandhans.

00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:11.652
So you are still unconscious about your chakras.

00:03:11.772 --> 00:03:14.790
Slightly conscious when you put your mind to it,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.269
otherwise, in your central nervous system

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.864
you are not yet so conscious.

00:03:19.984 --> 00:03:23.694
This is the reason, why you do not know

00:03:24.392 --> 00:03:31.700
why you had to do a thing at a particular time.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.825
Unless and until you rise to this Nirvikalpa state,

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:39.312
you cannot go further.

00:03:39.432 --> 00:03:44.134
For example, I know everything what I do.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.266
I can handle any power whenever I want to.

00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:53.035
I can absorb any negativity I want to,

00:03:53.155 --> 00:03:57.491
I need not absorb any negativity I don't want to.

00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:00.406
You may be thousands of miles away from Me,

00:04:00.526 --> 00:04:03.950
I know about everyone of you.

00:04:04.071 --> 00:04:07.343
I may not know your worldly names,

00:04:07.478 --> 00:04:12.545
but I know you as a part and parcel in My Being.

00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:17.741
I also can behave like a human being,

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:21.102
absolutely like you, aging like you,

00:04:21.222 --> 00:04:24.154
even using spectacles,

00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:33.035
doing all the things that will make Me a complete human being.

00:04:33.155 --> 00:04:38.088
I have accepted this role consciously,

00:04:39.032 --> 00:04:41.465
not unconsciously.

00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:44.992
To Me, nothing is unconscious.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.521
So if you have to be conscious of what you are doing,

00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:56.164
you have to be alert about it.

00:04:56.284 --> 00:05:00.929
The first thing that you have achieved is the peace,

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:02.421
the peace.

00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:06.007
But even now I find that peace

00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:10.289
which would become joy becomes the quarrel.

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.239
Truth is one, you cannot argue about truth.

00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:17.172
It is a homogenous thing.

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.102
It doesn't quarrel with each other.

00:05:21.222 --> 00:05:24.694
We are unconscious about our fingers,

00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:26.666
but when we have to hold something,

00:05:26.787 --> 00:05:28.769
all of them come togethe.

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.464
So the part of the brain, which is working this out,

00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:38.724
the unconscious part of it, is to be made conscious.

00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:42.012
That is what evolution is.

00:05:42.132 --> 00:05:51.849
So now adherence to any concept is against evolution.

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:55.591
You must learn to face the reality,

00:05:55.711 --> 00:06:02.452
to accept the reality and act in a real way.

00:06:02.572 --> 00:06:05.874
Now you may say, "Mother, this is a miracle."

00:06:05.994 --> 00:06:08.496
Something happens, "this is a miracle."

00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:11.546
Maybe for the human beings,

00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:14.152
maybe for Sahaja Yogis also,

00:06:14.272 --> 00:06:16.423
but not for Me

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.554
because I know what it is.

00:06:20.237 --> 00:06:27.829
So to rise above this half-baked consciousness,

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:35.165
one has to see how you are working it out.

00:06:35.285 --> 00:06:39.526
The whole system of relating to

00:06:39.646 --> 00:06:42.785
each other must change completely.

00:06:42.905 --> 00:06:46.852
That is very important, at least for western people.

00:06:46.972 --> 00:06:50.173
Because at least in India people know

00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:53.154
that human efforts lead you nowhere,

00:06:53.274 --> 00:06:56.005
you have to take to your ascent -

00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:58.778
I mean the real Indians.

00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:02.083
Some of them do take advantage of Sahaja Yoga

00:07:02.203 --> 00:07:06.292
and then disappear, some of them do.

00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:10.615
But mostly they know that you have to be

00:07:10.735 --> 00:07:15.864
conscious of what you have got.

00:07:15.984 --> 00:07:21.397
So, we can say that we have got self-knowledge,

00:07:21.517 --> 00:07:24.654
but we haven't got self-consciousness.

00:07:24.774 --> 00:07:27.427
Now, for example, you take somebody's name,

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:30.668
say of some great saint.

00:07:30.788 --> 00:07:34.402
You feel the vibrations are flowing.

00:07:34.522 --> 00:07:39.391
Also you know why - because he is a saint.

00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:42.109
But why not you the Sahaja Yogis?

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:46.041
If your names are taken, why don't the vibrations flow?

00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:50.491
And in this you have greater advantages

00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:53.676
because the Adi Shakti, Herself, is before you.

00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:57.394
They didn't have anybody to tell them all these things.

00:07:57.514 --> 00:08:03.311
But the disadvantage of that is this: that you take it for granted.

00:08:03.685 --> 00:08:09.782
Now, in expression, when we say something,

00:08:09.902 --> 00:08:12.904
when we express; are we natural,

00:08:13.024 --> 00:08:16.178
are we it doing from our heart?

00:08:16.298 --> 00:08:21.323
The consciousness that "I'm doing it from my heart,"

00:08:21.443 --> 00:08:24.218
is what I want you to achieve.

00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:28.145
Like there are people who work very hard in Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:28.265 --> 00:08:31.005
others will just take it for granted.

00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:33.809
They do not want to help.

00:08:35.522 --> 00:08:37.852
They want everything to be ready-made.

00:08:37.972 --> 00:08:40.386
That shows that they are not conscious

00:08:40.506 --> 00:08:43.880
of their own powers of enjoyment.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.509
If they do it from their heart,

00:08:46.629 --> 00:08:54.001
then they will never feel what effort they have put in,

00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:58.699
they will only feel what they have been blessed with

00:08:58.819 --> 00:09:00.524
or what they have achieved.

00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:03.120
Now the second stage would be

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.886
where you will be conscious of whatever you are doing,

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:11.397
where there will be no mistakes.

00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:13.812
Whatever you will do

00:09:13.932 --> 00:09:16.911
may appear to be a mistake will turn out to be all right.

00:09:17.031 --> 00:09:19.946
Nobody is so far like that, so I would like to tell you.

00:09:20.066 --> 00:09:23.918
Because some people do feel whatever I say of praising,

00:09:24.045 --> 00:09:26.298
they think I'm saying it to them.

00:09:26.418 --> 00:09:30.609
Now for example, today I had My watch,

00:09:30.729 --> 00:09:34.913
I wanted to set My watch, so I pulled this screw up,

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.067
say, simple thing.

00:09:37.187 --> 00:09:40.287
Now this I did, I would say, in a way unconsciously,

00:09:40.407 --> 00:09:42.614
but quite consciously.

00:09:43.963 --> 00:09:48.469
Because the watch stopped and I knew the time,

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:51.782
what time I have to be there for puja.

00:09:51.902 --> 00:09:55.983
So consciously I put Myself against Myself.

00:09:56.103 --> 00:10:01.798
If the watch had not stopped, I would have come earlier.

00:10:01.918 --> 00:10:05.409
But that was not the time I had to come.

00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:10.111
So I had to pull the screw to keep it stopped.

00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:13.709
So whatever mischief you play,

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:17.284
you know and you can play it against yourself also.

00:10:17.404 --> 00:10:20.113
And then you can make a drama.

00:10:20.233 --> 00:10:25.022
"Oh, I made a mistake!" and things like that, for nothing at all.

00:10:25.752 --> 00:10:28.814
But such a stage is far off. I must tell you.

00:10:28.934 --> 00:10:33.338
Just now the stage at which we are,

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:36.060
we are still making lots of mistakes

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.373
because we are not Self-conscious.

00:10:39.493 --> 00:10:43.455
In a gross way we understand this word self-consciousness like this:

00:10:43.575 --> 00:10:45.836
When a person has to go for an interview

00:10:45.956 --> 00:10:47.938
then, he selects his suit properly,

00:10:48.058 --> 00:10:50.219
he'll comb his hair properly before going,

00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:54.793
he'll clear his throat. Self-conscious.

00:10:55.134 --> 00:10:58.060
But when it is the question of your ascent,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.912
are we alert? Or we are taking it for granted

00:11:02.032 --> 00:11:05.249
that Mother is just now going to give us a nice bath,

00:11:05.369 --> 00:11:08.556
put us in the cradle and take us there.

00:11:08.676 --> 00:11:12.765
You have to mature in your ascent.

00:11:12.885 --> 00:11:16.252
Now you may say, "What should we do?"

00:11:17.681 --> 00:11:20.406
Face yourself every day!

00:11:20.526 --> 00:11:25.157
In reality, see how much time you spend about

00:11:25.277 --> 00:11:30.186
mundane worries and how much about your ascent.

00:11:30.306 --> 00:11:36.576
Have you left everything, all your worries to God Almighty?

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:41.629
Have you completely jumped out of your background?

00:11:41.749 --> 00:11:50.136
Have you come out all the way, leaving everything that was nonsensical?

00:11:50.256 --> 00:11:54.326
And how do I relate to others?

00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:59.036
How do I talk to others who are Sahaja Yogis?

00:11:59.156 --> 00:12:05.383
I am surprised sometimes, if the one Sahaja Yogi is attacked

00:12:05.503 --> 00:12:08.824
by a non-Sahaja Yogi that

00:12:08.945 --> 00:12:15.062
a Sahaja Yogi group should support a non-Sahaja Yogi.

00:12:15.182 --> 00:12:18.439
Or a Sahaja Yogi who has to come up

00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:22.172
pays more attention to the negative people

00:12:22.292 --> 00:12:24.342
than to the positive.

00:12:24.462 --> 00:12:27.456
He relates better to the people who are negative

00:12:27.576 --> 00:12:30.126
than to the people who are positive.

00:12:30.246 --> 00:12:33.757
He is more friendly and open with the negative persons

00:12:33.877 --> 00:12:35.789
than with the positive.

00:12:35.909 --> 00:12:38.121
You have to cling on to the positive.

00:12:38.241 --> 00:12:43.623
But it's always the other way round because also is a very subtle ego in there.

00:12:43.743 --> 00:12:48.542
All these subtle understanding

00:12:48.662 --> 00:12:51.203
I have told you many a time.

00:12:51.323 --> 00:12:56.088
But with your complicated brain, which is like a machine,

00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:59.164
like a spoiled computer,

00:12:59.284 --> 00:13:01.977
you can reach some conclusions

00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:07.052
out of what I have said which are just contrary.

00:13:07.172 --> 00:13:10.574
Like, supposing I say, "You forget the past."

00:13:10.694 --> 00:13:15.244
That means you forget everything that is good of the past?

00:13:15.364 --> 00:13:18.065
That is as if you should not understand

00:13:18.185 --> 00:13:20.210
why you're behaving like this?

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.960
Forget the past means don't allow the past to overpower you.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:31.521
A brain, which is simple, which is straightforward,

00:13:31.641 --> 00:13:35.637
which has got love in it,

00:13:35.757 --> 00:13:40.486
can understand what I am saying straightforward.

00:13:40.606 --> 00:13:44.371
This complicated brain is to be put right,

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:48.519
and the best way is to stop thinking.

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:50.447
Just stop thinking.

00:13:50.567 --> 00:13:53.094
That's what you have to do.

00:13:53.214 --> 00:13:59.322
Now when you stop thinking you feel that nothing can be done.

00:13:59.442 --> 00:14:03.994
But by thinking only you don't do anything.

00:14:05.216 --> 00:14:08.685
Now for example, I have to give you a speech now,

00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:12.560
but I start thinking about it, what will you hear?

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.291
Can you hear My thinking?

00:14:15.942 --> 00:14:21.156
You have to, say, enlighten these lights, all right?

00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:23.866
Then you just start thinking about it,

00:14:23.986 --> 00:14:27.271
"I have to enlighten." Will it get enlightened?

00:14:27.391 --> 00:14:33.525
This is to be understood, that by thinking you do not do anything.

00:14:33.645 --> 00:14:36.219
Thinking is lazy man's garb,

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:38.817
and is used to avoid work.

00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:43.534
Once I asked a lady I had in the house

00:14:43.654 --> 00:14:49.090
that "We are going out. Will you be cooking something for us?"

00:14:49.574 --> 00:14:52.294
When we came back she had not cooked anything.

00:14:52.414 --> 00:14:56.082
I used to cook every day but she had not cooked anything.

00:14:56.202 --> 00:15:01.560
I said, "Why? Why didn't you cook something for us?"

00:15:01.681 --> 00:15:05.482
She said, "I thought You may eat outside."

00:15:05.602 --> 00:15:08.223
She was a western lady.

00:15:09.152 --> 00:15:13.148
So my husband said, "All right, we are going to eat outside. You stay at home."

00:15:13.268 --> 00:15:15.285
I said, "It doesn't look nice." He said,

00:15:15.405 --> 00:15:19.788
"No, let her know what she thought is meant for herself."

00:15:20.979 --> 00:15:25.638
So this is the escape which, you have learnt before,

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:28.115
the cleverness.

00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:33.346
So you do not argue about it.

00:15:34.462 --> 00:15:38.159
Do not argue about Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:43.402
You do not argue with your leaders.

00:15:43.522 --> 00:15:46.604
You may be his wife, but don't argue.

00:15:46.724 --> 00:15:49.839
We are having a very bad time from some of the wives

00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:54.811
of the leaders because they try to influence the husbands.

00:15:54.931 --> 00:15:57.655
As far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:15:57.775 --> 00:16:00.092
they have nothing to do with that.

00:16:00.212 --> 00:16:02.138
Supposing you are working in an office

00:16:02.258 --> 00:16:05.085
and the husband is some great official

00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:09.064
and you are a clerk, will you correct the husband?

00:16:09.184 --> 00:16:15.774
In this case the women have to nourish the organization,

00:16:15.895 --> 00:16:20.273
nourish the husband with love

00:16:20.393 --> 00:16:23.533
from their heart and not from their brains.

00:16:23.653 --> 00:16:30.076
I think it's so great to have been born as a woman Myself,

00:16:30.196 --> 00:16:36.601
because I can enjoy the heart, the emotions.

00:16:36.721 --> 00:16:40.572
The emotions of My love,

00:16:40.692 --> 00:16:44.577
the working and the play of My love.

00:16:44.697 --> 00:16:46.889
It's so great

00:16:47.009 --> 00:16:51.926
that no incarnation can enjoy that as I can.

00:16:52.046 --> 00:16:54.052
So the women should not feel degraded

00:16:54.172 --> 00:16:57.766
if they have to look after the heart,

00:16:57.886 --> 00:17:02.579
but they are in a higher, in a way, in a higher aspect.

00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:06.713
You can do without thinking but you cannot do without the heart.

00:17:06.833 --> 00:17:11.279
So the ladies should not argue

00:17:11.399 --> 00:17:14.616
with their husbands if they are leaders,

00:17:14.736 --> 00:17:18.208
and also one should not argue otherwise, also.

00:17:18.328 --> 00:17:22.118
Because I have seen if the women are very argumentative,

00:17:22.238 --> 00:17:24.539
the men become deaf.

00:17:24.659 --> 00:17:28.417
They just don't listen what women are talking.

00:17:28.537 --> 00:17:31.184
If they are very aggressive, then the men

00:17:31.304 --> 00:17:35.494
become absolutely shut up.

00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:39.176
So in relationship with each other,

00:17:39.296 --> 00:17:42.448
you must behave in a natural way that

00:17:42.568 --> 00:17:44.742
you are a man and you are a woman.

00:17:44.862 --> 00:17:48.034
You should become more a woman and more a man

00:17:48.154 --> 00:17:50.339
and then you will see the fun.

00:17:50.459 --> 00:17:53.365
Imagine in this world if there were only men or only women,

00:17:53.485 --> 00:17:56.880
what would have happened?

00:18:00.023 --> 00:18:05.534
So we have to know that in our awareness

00:18:05.654 --> 00:18:10.883
we have to be conscious how far we have achieved

00:18:11.003 --> 00:18:18.858
the consciousness for our relationship with each other,

00:18:18.978 --> 00:18:25.351
that is the collective consciousness of Virat, of the brain,

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.688
that is of Sahasrara.

00:18:27.808 --> 00:18:34.200
So in principle Sahasrara is Vishnu Tattwa,

00:18:34.644 --> 00:18:39.333
but the Deity is Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:18:39.705 --> 00:18:46.309
So you can see how the beautiful integration has taken place.

00:18:46.429 --> 00:18:50.244
All the powers of Shri Vishnu have to act

00:18:50.364 --> 00:18:55.802
according to the Deity, surrendered at the Lotus Feet of the Deity.

00:18:55.922 --> 00:19:00.548
So the consciousness of Shri Vishnu is

00:19:00.668 --> 00:19:05.518
absolutely in the hands of the Deity.

00:19:05.638 --> 00:19:11.550
I do not want to talk about this tremendous Deity,

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:18.358
it's too much, because it may fill you up with awe.

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:31.293
So, whatever is working out, allow it to work out.

00:19:31.413 --> 00:19:35.939
They say, "Surrender your Sahasrara to this Deity."

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:39.834
And it's so, so simple for you,

00:19:39.954 --> 00:19:44.172
because you have the Deity,

00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:49.122
you have your own Sahasrara, and it's only you,

00:19:49.242 --> 00:19:53.444
the people who are Sahaja Yogis today in modern times,

00:19:53.564 --> 00:19:56.153
have seen that Deity.

00:19:56.273 --> 00:19:59.747
They say that you have to ask for three things

00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:03.399
called salokya, samipya, sanidhya from God;

00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:08.766
meaning to see God, salokya;

00:20:08.886 --> 00:20:12.019
samipya, the closeness with God

00:20:12.139 --> 00:20:16.716
and sanidhya is the companionship of God.

00:20:16.836 --> 00:20:21.330
But you have got tadatmya, is oneness with God

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.840
which is not in the concept of any one

00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:29.736
of the yogis and the saints and the seers who have been before.

00:20:29.856 --> 00:20:34.933
And this tadatmya you have when you are outside My body,

00:20:35.053 --> 00:20:38.659
while they have this tadatmya when they are inside My body,

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.360
they are no more.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.437
Now, So you should understand the time limit.

00:20:46.714 --> 00:20:49.367
You must understand your greatness

00:20:49.487 --> 00:20:54.610
and you must understand how you people

00:20:54.730 --> 00:21:02.929
are chosen for the highest work in this creation.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:06.186
So now there's no time for lethargy.

00:21:06.306 --> 00:21:10.737
Now you have to rise and awake.

00:21:10.857 --> 00:21:14.602
Today is the day when I hope

00:21:14.722 --> 00:21:18.049
you have to jump into Nirvikalpa.

00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:20.441
But only by effort you will stay there,

00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:22.824
otherwise you will again slip down.

00:21:22.944 --> 00:21:25.558
So go through this lecture again and again,

00:21:25.678 --> 00:21:28.551
and do not think about it.

00:21:28.671 --> 00:21:33.422
Don't think that it is for somebody else, it is for you.

00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:35.597
For all of you,

00:21:35.717 --> 00:21:38.244
each of you,

00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:41.432
and you must know yourself

00:21:41.552 --> 00:21:46.147
how far you are going every day.

00:21:48.858 --> 00:21:53.931
Today is a special day of Sahasrara.

00:21:56.121 --> 00:22:00.929
Actually, if you see, it is according to

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:04.820
the sun calendar,

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.991
Sahasrara would have been tomorrow.

00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:12.249
It is a Monday, which is the Sahasrara

00:22:13.884 --> 00:22:19.876
and just imagine that we are having it one day earlier.

00:22:19.997 --> 00:22:26.693
So one has to know that the calendar of God

00:22:26.813 --> 00:22:31.633
has nothing to do with the human calendar.

00:22:32.054 --> 00:22:34.646
According to certain calendars,

00:22:34.766 --> 00:22:39.429
I should have come two thousand years later

00:22:47.063 --> 00:22:49.362
and some think I should have come

00:22:49.482 --> 00:22:52.943
at least two thousand years back,

00:22:53.063 --> 00:22:54.896
in this form.

00:22:55.017 --> 00:23:01.404
So the calendar is all right, timing is all right,

00:23:01.525 --> 00:23:03.819
everything is all right.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:09.920
You are not robots, you are not machines,

00:23:11.264 --> 00:23:16.819
you are evolved through the evolutionary process.

00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:21.044
And through evolutionary process only

00:23:21.164 --> 00:23:24.708
you have to achieve the higher.

00:23:24.828 --> 00:23:30.451
So whatever we may do or whatever may be all right,

00:23:30.571 --> 00:23:36.814
it's you who have to show the results.

00:23:36.934 --> 00:23:44.030
We may take your Sahasrara

00:23:44.989 --> 00:23:48.926
to a great enlightenment but again it will collapse.

00:23:49.046 --> 00:23:54.325
So you have to know that whatever heights

00:23:54.445 --> 00:23:59.544
you are brought to, it is you who have to maintain it

00:23:59.664 --> 00:24:04.162
with full will power and action.

00:24:08.824 --> 00:24:11.023
May God bless you!
