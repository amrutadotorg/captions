3
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:07,280
This day for us to remember that Christ was born on this earth.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,520
As a human being, He came on this earth.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,240
And the task that was before Him

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,240
was to enlighten human awareness

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:38,240
with the sense of understanding,

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,400
but we can say it is actualization,

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,840
within the awareness of human beings,

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,800
that they are not this body but they are the spirit.

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,080
The message of Christ is His resurrection.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,320
That is you are your spirit and not your body.

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,120
And He showed by His resurrection,

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,200
how He ascended into the realm of spirit – which He was,

15
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:25,280
because He was Pranava, He was Brahma, He was Mahavishnu –

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,840
as I have told you about His birth.

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:44,920
And when He came on this earth, in a body, like a human being,

18
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,160
He wanted to show another thing

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,960
that spirit has nothing to do with money,

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,160
has nothing to do with power.

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:13,280
It is all powerful, all pervading, but He’s born in a stable,

22
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:28,240
not in a palace or to a king

23
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:35,120
but He was born to a very ordinary person, a carpenter.

24
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:51,080
Because if you are the king, as we say in Hindi language, Badshah

25
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,840
then nothing is greater than you, isn’t it? It means simply that.

26
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,880
Nothing is higher than you, neither anything can decorate you,

27
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,080
because whatever you are, you are at the highest.

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:16,200
All the worldly things so called, are just like dry grass, Trinavat.

29
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,160
So He was kept in the dried grass.

30
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,800
To many it makes very unhappy and they feel very sorry,

31
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,440
that Christ, the one who came to save us,

32
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,360
was kept under such conditions and why not God provided Him with

33
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,160
something better? But to such people it does not matter:

34
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,680
whether you are lying in the dried grass or in the stable

35
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,800
or in the palaces, everything is just the same

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,720
for it does not touch them, they are so detached

37
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,440
and they are completely in joy. They are the masters of themselves –

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,640
nothing can master them.

39
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,520
No matter can master them, no comfort can master them.

40
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,960
They are masters of complete comforts within themselves,

41
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,600
they have achieved all the comforts within themselves,

42
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,480
they are satisfied people.

43
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,240
That’s why they are kings, they are called as kings,

44
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,360
not those kings who run after things,

45
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,600
or those kings who seek comforts in life.

46
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,840
I mean if you have comforts well and good.

47
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,720
If you don’t have well and good, makes no difference.

48
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,960
So many people, specially in Latin America when I went there,

49
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,120
they said, “but we can’t understand why

50
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,520
Christ was born as a poor man.”

51
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,560
This is again the human concept about God is,

52
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,240
you see he wants to command God, be born in a King’s palace.

53
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,240
You cannot order Him about. We have our own concepts about God that,

54
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,840
“why should He be a poor man; why should He be helpless?”

55
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,440
He never showed His helplessness.

56
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,120
He was much more dynamic than all your kings and all your

57
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,320
politicians put together. He was not afraid of anyone.

58
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,680
Whatever He had to say He said it.

59
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:37,160
He was not afraid of crucifixion or any such “punishment” so called.

60
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,240
It’s only the human beings. you see,

61
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,480
who have these false ideas about life

62
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,720
and that’s why they want to put these ideas onto God also

63
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,720
and try to make Him follow their own concepts.

64
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,880
God is not your concept. He’s not a concept at all.

65
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,920
To also say that “Concept is after all is a concept”

66
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,120
is also a concept – this I found out very recently.

67
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
This is another myth people carry.

68
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Those who say, that “Oh, concept is a concept! All right?

69
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,560
Mataji says, all right.” So what?

70
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:28,800
But even this is a concept, because concept is thought.

71
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,760
You have to rise beyond thought at a higher level

72
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,400
into thoughtless awareness where you are not in thought but you are

73
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,160
in the center of the thought.

74
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,400
In the sense that one thought rises and falls

75
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,560
and there is a place in between, another thought rises and fall.

76
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,520
You are in the center of these thoughts. The Vilamba as we call it.

77
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:02,640
The time where you pause. Then you will understand Christ.

78
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,560
He was here, partly of course to save us,

79
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,360
because He had many aspects I should say,

80
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,560
not only to save human beings He came on this earth.

81
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,880
There were many more aspects,

82
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,760
this is also human beings have a demand, you see

83
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,640
that that they must be saved, why?

84
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,560
One shouldn’t. I Mean from God’s angle if you see,

85
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,800
why should they be saved all of them?

86
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,120
What have they done for God?

87
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,040
How can you demand God that “You must save us?”

88
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,680
Can you? You cannot ask for that.

89
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:08,120
So He did come to create the passage between as you see here,

90
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:15,120
the Vishudhi and the Sahastrara, this Agnya.

91
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,280
In the primordial being the Virat – He was born there,

92
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,720
to open that door.

93
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:32,160
In evolution, every incarnation has come on this earth

94
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,880
to open a particular door within us and to create

95
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,080
that opening or that enlightenment in our awareness.

96
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:52,280
So Christ came precisely for opening this small little door,

97
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,320
which is constricted by our ego and superego.

98
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,400
Ego and superego are the two byproducts of our thought process.

99
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,320
One the thoughts, that are of the past and the other,

100
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,600
thoughts of the future.

101
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:21,640
He came to make that gap, to cross that gap,

102
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:34,960
and that’s how He has sacrificed Himself, His body.

103
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:49,680
For you it is a very big thing of remorse and repentance,

104
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,600
but for such people it is not, it’s a play.

105
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,960
They have to play a certain role.

106
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,960
That’s why I do not understand why do you show Him to be

107
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,080
such a lanky, panky, miserable creature.

108
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,680
He was never miserable.

109
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,280
Such people can never be miserable as you are.

110
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,480
This is another concept of man, that He should be lanky, panky,

111
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:25,640
tally, skinny, starved, bones coming out, count them one by one.

112
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Horrible! I tell you.

113
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,600
From His childhood to His death He was jolly person,

114
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:44,640
He was happiness, He was joy. To make you all happy,

115
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,800
to give you the

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,200
light of happiness by enlightening your source of joy,

117
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,840
that is your spirit in your heart.

118
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,240
That He came on this earth – not only to save you –

119
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,920
first to give you happiness, to give you joy.

120
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,520
Because human beings in their ignorance and in this tomfoolery,

121
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,280
are unnecessarily beating themselves and destroying themselves.

122
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,680
When nobody asked you to go to pubs to get into trouble;

123
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,400
nobody has asked you to go to races and become bankrupts;

124
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,280
nobody has asked you to go to horrible gurus and get into troubles.

125
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,800
But you seek your destruction morning till evening.

126
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,880
Then He comes there, like a morning flower, to make you happy.

127
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,000
First to make you happy, to give you joy. You see any child.

128
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,160
You see any child at least I know Myself,

129
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,920
I don’t know about the funny people here I mean,

130
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,320
for them flowers also look like thorns,

131
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,080
I mean I don’t know how they manage that stuff.

132
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,280
But you see a child anywhere, any child,

133
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,000
such a joy giving thing it is.

134
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,200
And this is the child of the divine –

135
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,560
that comes on this earth as a child –

136
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,560
is the most joy giving thing.

137
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,600
And that’s why Christmas for all of us, for the whole Universe

138
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,000
should be a festival of great joy.

139
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,200
For He brought light for us by which you could see

140
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,280
that there is someone called as “God.”

141
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,440
There is someone, who is going to remove this ignorance.

142
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,640
This was the first beginning.

143
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,960
So, for us, it is necessary to be first joyous and be happy

144
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,680
and relaxed, and not to take anything that seriously as we take.

145
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,560
Because divine life doesn’t make you serious.

146
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,560
Because it’s all a play, it’s a maya.

147
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,920
I have seen in all the rituals that people follow,

148
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,280
in all the so called religious people,

149
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,840
they are too serious to be religious.

150
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,320
And religious person is bubbling with laughter.

151
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,320
He doesn’t know how to hide his joy.

152
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,560
And he doesn’t know how to control his laughter when he sees people

153
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
who are unnecessarily serious.

154
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,880
I mean nobody’s dead. The way they people say it,

155
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,720
it’s sometimes, you just don’t know what to do with yourself.

156
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,400
You just can’t control.

157
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,480
So there’s nothing in this world for a person like Christ

158
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
to feel sad about.

159
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,360
And if you really believe in Him,

160
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,560
then please first of all give up your, this silly sadness

161
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,040
and sulking and sitting down and becoming morose,

162
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,720
not talking to anyone, silent bores allover.

163
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,520
That is not the way to look at Christ.

164
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,400
See how He went and talked to multitudes,

165
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:39,640
how He opened His hands to all the people around

166
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,600
and how He tried to give them happiness.

167
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,040
He has said that you are to be born again.

168
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,240
That means, He had to do this work

169
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,000
and that you have to get it

170
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,280
sometime He had promised that you are to be born again.

171
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,680
Christ is to be born within us.

172
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,880
I don’t know what Christians understand out of this.

173
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,640
How do you become born again?

174
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,720
Not by going through a ritual of christening,

175
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,400
somebody coming from a theological college

176
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,280
cannot make you a Christian.

177
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,560
Like in our India we have some paid Brahmins,

178
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,840
as you have here paid people you see,

179
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,560
the whole day they will eat, drink, be merry and evening time

180
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,760
they’ll come and pray and preach, that sort of people.

181
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:44,840
You have to be a person who is authorized by God.

182
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:51,400
Unless and until you are authorized by God, you cannot give joy.

183
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,320
And that’s why I’ve seen all these people the so called…

184
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,960
big pundits and the big… priests

185
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,760
and all of them are so serious because they are not authorized by God.

186
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,520
Even on a Christmas day, I mean anybody who comes from a village

187
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,720
may think there’s a funeral going on.

188
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,000
And after the funeral they go home. How do you celebrate?

189
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,680
With a champagne! And after the funeral also real funeral

190
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,600
also they’ll celebrate the… I don’t know why,

191
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,800
but they take champagne.

192
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,360
How can you celebrate Christ by insulting Him.

193
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,160
He came to enlighten

194
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,480
your awareness because He respected your awareness,

195
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,680
the point at which it had reached, but you are trying to put it down.

196
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Is this the way to understand Him?

197
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,720
And He has promised that you are to be baptized,

198
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,560
you are to be born again. And now, in Sahaj Yoga,

199
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,680
this promise is being fulfilled. So be joyous,

200
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,360
that here at the Agnya chakra, again Christ is born within you

201
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:24,800
and He’s there and you know how you can ask for his help, always.

202
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,080
But the main thing that one has to understand,

203
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,480
that the time has come for you to get all that is promised

204
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,360
in the scriptures. Not only in the Bible, but all the scriptures

205
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,360
of the world the time has come today.

206
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:56,280
That you have to become a Christian, a Brahmin, a Peer,

207
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,200
through your Kundalini awakening only.

208
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:08,440
There is no other way out. And that your last judgment is also now.

209
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,760
Only through your Kundalini awakening, God is going to judge you.

210
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,840
How is He going to judge you otherwise, you think of somebody now.

211
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,200
A person comes in, now here is somebody sitting to judge you.

212
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,400
How? By how many hair dressers you have been to?

213
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
Or how many suits you have stitched for the Christmas?

214
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,920
Or what presents you have bought and how many cards you have sent?

215
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,840
And to how many people you have

216
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,600
sent some other things which may not be very palatable.

217
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,840
That’s not the way.

218
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,480
Or is it, that at what price you bought all the things?

219
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,840
The way we are particular? Which way are we going to be judged

220
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,880
by God?

221
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,840
Not superficially people say, so what depth have we got, let’s see?

222
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,080
How far can we go in our depth?

223
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,400
At the most we reach a point where we are nothing but a concept again.

224
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,960
So whatever depth we know goes up to only rationality

225
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,960
up to the concept point beyond that we can not reach.

226
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,160
So how can we be judged?

227
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,680
How do people are judged if you go to a doctor?

228
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,920
He has his instruments, an’ he works it out, puts the light in,

229
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,120
sees for himself and says this is the position.

230
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:58,280
And how your spirituality is going to be judged?

231
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,520
How a seed is judged? By sprouting it!

232
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,800
When you sprout the seed and when you see its germinating power

233
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,240
you know it’s a good seed or a bad seed.

234
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,840
In the same way, you will be judged by the way you are germinated,

235
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,640
the way you receive your realization, the way you retain it,

236
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,280
the way you respect it.

237
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,680
That is how you are going to be judged and not by the kind of dresses

238
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,840
you are wearing.

239
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,800
By the type of matching you do and the hair dressing you go to.

240
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,360
Not by the big positions you occupy and the big politicians

241
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,680
and big bureaucrats you become.

242
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,520
Not by what kind of houses you have built and what kind of so called

243
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,760
Noble [sic] prizes you have won.

244
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,600
You are not also going to be judged by your philanthropic work

245
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,160
by that you think that you have given so much money so much so,

246
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
because you, if you have given so much money

247
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,280
there will be big ego somewhere hanging and it will bring you down

248
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,880
your scale.

249
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,800
This is a judgment in which

250
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,840
the little feather is going to weigh more, much more than a ship.

251
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:26,760
It’s a different type of a judgment, of a personality.

252
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,640
You can see how Christ was judged by human beings

253
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,960
and how He was judged by God.

254
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:49,440
He came and lived in the dried straw like a feather.

255
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,200
His mother never felt His discomfort.

256
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:10,840
In the same way those who have not by there being,

257
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:20,160
oppressed others or taken oppression, are going to be judged

258
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,600
as first class.

259
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,800
In the Kundalini awakening itself there are inherent defects.

260
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,880
Inherently the Kundalini has some defects,

261
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,080
because of your previous karmas.

262
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,960
Because what you have been doing in this lifetime.

263
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,400
Because, the things that you have accepted as

264
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,920
reality, which is just a concept.

265
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,680
Because, when you have not known the absolute,

266
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,560
whatever you will be doing,

267
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,760
there will be a little of ignorance with it.

268
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,160
Whatever you have done in darkness

269
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,360
will have a particle of darkness in it.

270
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,720
So without knowing realization if you have propagated,

271
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,000
“Oh, we are great saints, this that,” you’ll have no chance.

272
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,520
If you think you are a very divine personality,

273
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,920
and you are already a realized soul, no chances!

274
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,240
All the priests of all the religions,

275
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,400
will be the last to get realization.

276
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,960
Valmiki in his Ramayana, has very clearly said,

277
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,760
a very interesting story is there, that, a dog was asked

278
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,640
what do you want to be in your next life?

279
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,400
So he told “make me anything but don’t make me a Mathadhish.”

280
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,640
A person. Mathadhish is a person like a “priesthood.”

281
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,920
So make me everything but not a priest anywhere.

282
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,400
Just imagine a dog having that wisdom.

283
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,880
But I do not say that all of them are like that.

284
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,400
There may be some who are really genuine,

285
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,920
some may be really realized people, may be authorized by God.

286
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,040
But I am sure they are not accepted, by the multitude,

287
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,360
I am sure of that. Because I have seen your history and all that,

288
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:39,200
I’ve seen all such people have been discarded and have been tortured.

289
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:49,680
But now the time has come… to judge the right and the wrong.

290
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,280
You cannot crucify anymore. you cannot.

291
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,120
Everyone is going to be judged through Kundalini awakening.

292
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:10,000
Now, we should know there are three categories of human beings.

293
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,880
I don’t know which way to start, not to shock you,

294
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:21,280
one is human beings as we are, normal. They are called as Narayoni.

295
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,200
The second categories are Devayoni.

296
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,280
Those who are born seekers or realized souls,

297
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,560
mostly realized souls are Devayoni.

298
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,520
And the third ones are called as Rakshas. These are called as Ganas.

299
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,680
Actually these are called as Ganas.

300
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,400
But is the We can say the species among human beings are Rakshasas.

301
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,520
Means the people who are evil.

302
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,640
So we have evil people, excellent people,

303
00:25:52,840 --> 00:26:00,520
and we have in-between people. Excellent people are very few.

304
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,600
They are born realized. I don’t have their problem much.

305
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,840
But one has to deal with the people who are in the center.

306
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:19,760
They are looking towards good but have something hanging on to them,

307
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,280
which is not so good.

308
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,760
So for these people, there are inherently some defects

309
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,280
in the Kundalini, which we must understand.

310
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,520
The first of them is bad health,

311
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,280
physical bad health, actual physical bad health.

312
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,720
In this country specially people suffer from too much of cold

313
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,320
and other troubles due to over calcium in the water,

314
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,440
in the same way according to the countries,

315
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,960
stanavishesh as they call it, you have your problems.

316
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,880
Like in our country we have some problems;

317
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,040
like in your country you have certain problems.

318
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,480
So, the physical problems are according to the country

319
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,920
where you have taken your birth.

320
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,320
Most of you have decided to take birth in particular countries.

321
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,640
That’s why you are identified also to such an extent sometimes

322
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,720
that you think there is no defect.

323
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:37,560
Every country has a variety by which you suffer a certain

324
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,400
amount of setback in your health.

325
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,200
So for a Sahaj Yogi

326
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,600
one should know that health is a very important thing.

327
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,560
Because this body is the temple of God,

328
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,360
and one has to look after your health.

329
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,520
And you know also when the Kundalini rises the first thing that

330
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,200
happens that your health improves.

331
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,240
Because of the parasympathetic fulfillment.

332
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,800
Because parasympathetic gives you enlightenment

333
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,960
which flows into sympathetic and your health improves.

334
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,600
I will not tell about it very elaborately today because time is short.

335
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:27,080
But, if you read My..I would say I haven’t yet written much,

336
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,720
but if you listen to My lectures,

337
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,520
and some of them which are written down,

338
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,400
you will know how Kundalini helps to cure most of the diseases,

339
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:47,080
except for which are being tampered by human elements,

340
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,120
like a kidney trouble now has been cured by Sahaj Yoga.

341
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,440
No doubt, we can cure kidney trouble.

342
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,040
But a person who has been on the machine, we’ve tried,

343
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,920
cannot be cured.

344
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,120
We can give him longevity, but he cannot be cured.

345
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,560
But to cure people is not your job at all by any chance,

346
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,800
you must remember this.

347
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,040
No Sahaj Yogi should take to curing people.

348
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,760
They can use my photograph.

349
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,280
But not to take to curing, because it means you are a big

350
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,800
philanthropic personality.

351
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,120
I have seen people who have been curing,

352
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,680
get into such a mania of curing,

353
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,920
that they forget that they are also catching something and

354
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,760
they are also getting some troubles and they never cure them self,

355
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,240
ultimately I find they get out of Sahaj Yoga.

356
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,560
But with the Photograph you can cure people.

357
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,120
Do not think that it is your duty that you are a great sort-of-a…

358
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:58,200
what you call a… benefactor, physical benefactor, no, you are not.

359
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,520
You are a spiritual benefactor but as a byproduct,

360
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,160
the body of the person improves because if

361
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,760
Christ has to be awakened,

362
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,800
if God has to come in this body, then this body is to be cleansed.

363
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,440
It is done by Kundalini.

364
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:33,160
But it does not have a separate work like hospitals.

365
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,800
I have known people who went so mad with their power of curing that

366
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
they started visiting regularly the hospitals,

367
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,760
and they ended up in the hospital only.

368
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,600
They would not even come to programs;

369
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,240
they would not even come and see Me.

370
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,080
So this is one of the greatest hurdles you have got

371
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:01,680
is the Vyadhi, is the bodily elements.

372
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,400
And the bodily element also should not take you down too much.

373
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,560
If we have some problem, forget it.

374
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,200
Gradually it will improve, with some people it takes time

375
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,160
to get all right.

376
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,120
But the main thing is, to get to your spirit.

377
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,800
So do not always say “Mother, cure me, cure me, cure me.”

378
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,280
But just say “Mother give me the spiritual life,”

379
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,040
and you will be cured automatically.

380
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,280
It may take time in some people, doesn’t matter.

381
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,120
You have been sick all your life, doesn’t matter.

382
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,000
Little more time.

383
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,520
And also follow the methods which [I HAVE …del] we have told,

384
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,400
about different diseases, specially liver in this country, colds,

385
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,600
and what you call this gout and all these troubles.

386
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,840
We have remedies for all this. Diabetes, we have,

387
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:15,000
but work it out as a duty towards your body, towards the temple.

388
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,920
But that should not be the end of your life,

389
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,480
that’s a very little part.

390
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,440
I mean it would be something like cleaning the whole place…

391
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,160
and then you get out of it. They say “Why did you clean?”

392
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,680
Like I have seen here people, you see, even we were in Oxstead

393
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,160
I was surprised, you see everybody used to polish everything you know,

394
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,800
and everything was, sort of, lawn was done very well

395
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,160
and everything cleaned very well, and not even a rat would enter

396
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,400
their houses even.

397
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,000
For months together I never saw any person getting in,

398
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,680
only getting out, and they were so particular.

399
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Husband wife, so particular about cleanliness, neatness, everything…

400
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,720
and the both of them would never even talk to each other,

401
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,040
I have seen that. There were seven houses, except for our house,

402
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,680
and [SHE WAS …del] they were all surprised at how many people are

403
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,080
coming to our house, they said “Are you a open house?

404
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,880
I said “Yes, it is a open house.”

405
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,080
They couldn’t understand what was wrong with us.

406
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,960
Nobody would see that polished thing or anything,

407
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,160
so, that’s how it should be that we should not go to that extent.

408
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,800
That it becomes a sort of real “Sahaj Yoga and the rest”

409
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,440
which is the most important is forgotten.

410
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Health will improve gradually as I have told you.

411
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,720
But attention should be on your spirit.

412
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,000
Attention should be on your spirit, because it is the attention,

413
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,240
which goes into these various directions and gets stuck.

414
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,080
You just allow it to work out and it will work out.

415
00:33:52,360 --> 00:34:01,840
The second hurdle which I feel, is called as akarmanyeta.

416
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:10,560
Osnath, they call it. Means a person… does not want to work it out.

417
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,920
Of course those people who are useless,

418
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,160
who do not want to have realization, forget about them.

419
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,280
But even after getting realization, it’s an innate problem

420
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,760
with people that they do not want to work it out.

421
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,440
They are lazy; in simple words, they are lazy.

422
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,080
That is very much in this country, surprisingly.

423
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,120
I mean the other day I saw a picture, where how, even from your

424
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,440
country people went to Germany and blasted a complete machinery

425
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,600
and a complete factory of that machinery which was sending

426
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,600
pilot-less bombs.

427
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,960
And they have overdone everything so then our children are having a

428
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:03,680
nice time, perhaps. But, in Sahaj Yoga, you have to be alert .

429
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,280
This what exactly happens in Sahaj Yoga when people come here:

430
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,280
they get their realization, they feel the cool breeze,

431
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,360
and is lost again. The reason is, they do not want to work it out.

432
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,880
This is another danger, akarmanyeta.

433
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,360
Then, when it is lost, after one year they’ll come back “Mother?

434
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,160
We don’t believe in it, but I have got some pain in the stomach,

435
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,760
will You cure me?”

436
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,600
Instead of… you becoming so equipped with all the powers that you

437
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,000
have, you become another useless person coming here,

438
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,440
just to take My time. These powers are all within you.

439
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,960
This is your property. This is the property of your spirit

440
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,080
which is there inside, which is about to manifest but,

441
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,520
because of certain hurdles that you accept, that it does not.

442
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,320
This is akarmanyta, we can say.

443
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,960
Which is, not working it out, not knowing about it,

444
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,960
not understanding it, what is Sahaj Yoga is,

445
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,320
how to manipulate this, what are these vibrations are,

446
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:25,440
how it works out? People just say, “Oh! It’s too much.”

447
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,000
Because they don’t want to face the reality.

448
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,640
Because as soon as your Kundalini comes up,

449
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,440
as soon as the light comes in before, the eyes are closed,

450
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,040
you see suddenly the light comes in, you don’t want to open your eyes.

451
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,360
Because too much we have been sleeping.

452
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,800
Even if you open your eyes a little bit, “Oh God!”

453
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,840
You don’t want to face the light.

454
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,880
Because you are identified with that state,

455
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,080
you do not want to open your eyes.

456
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,400
Kundalini opens your eyes, no doubt, but again you close it down.

457
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,520
So it is in your freedom, to give up that akarmanyeta.

458
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,280
Now this is also, can be very collective, I can tell you this much.

459
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,560
It’s a very big disease, which spreads.

460
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,160
Like, say a husband wife is there, the wife is one like that.

461
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,680
Instead of the husband raising the wife, he will succumb to wife,

462
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,360
specially in the west. Just the opposite in India,

463
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,080
because [THE del] there the husband is more dominating,

464
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,520
the women will succumb to a husband.

465
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,800
So what happens is, that out of the two those who have got it also

466
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,720
are just wasted.

467
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,280
Instead of that, both of them could be very well realized,

468
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,120
and could be there if the one who is realized,

469
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,760
puts down his will, that “No, I’ll keep my eyes open to see.

470
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,520
Let me see. I must give a chance to myself.” If they accept it,

471
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,040
then it works and then they go to the second step.

472
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:12,680
Everything cannot be just like a jet liner, sit down here and…

473
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,160
next moment you are on the… moon?

474
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,680
Even if you are in the moon,

475
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,400
still you may start with the third danger which is there,

476
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:33,000
is sanshaya. Is the doubting.

477
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:39,440
I don’t know how to describe this madness of doubting.

478
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,040
For example, out of all of you who have been here,

479
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,400
I would say, at least, I don’t know how much percentage…

480
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,720
[Yogi very softly:] Ninety.

481
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,120
[Shri Mataji:] [laughs] …have come out with the second day

482
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,640
a very great statement “Still I am doubting.”

483
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:06,880
Is that the sign of wisdom? What are you doubting?

484
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,520
What have you found out so far?

485
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,320
From where does this come?

486
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,040
Is Mr. Ego, about which I have given lectures after lectures.

487
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,160
Is Mr. Ego that is doubting it?

488
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,720
Because he doesn’t want you to find the absolute.

489
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,320
You are identified with your Ego,

490
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,080
and you do not want to find it because,

491
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,640
this Mr. Ego has been guiding your life throughout,

492
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,880
and now [YOU DON’T …del] you want to doubt. Doubt what?

493
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,360
What are you doubting? You felt the cool breeze, all right?

494
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,800
Sit down then.

495
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,080
It would be something like somebody entering into a college,

496
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,080
university, and they are going sitting down firstly there,

497
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,040
teacher says “Now, this is the diagram, I give you.”

498
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,400
The students get up and say, “Sir we doubt.” Really?

499
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,720
Then what should the teacher say. But they will not say that,

500
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:21,160
because they have paid the fees. They have paid it.

501
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,960
Even if it is a horrible drama, boring one,

502
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,840
still we go through it because we have paid, you see?

503
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,400
To go through it “After all, we have paid it,” you see? What to do?

504
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,240
But for Sahaj Yoga you cannot pay.

505
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,680
I have seen all kinds of tomfoolery people accept in so many gurus.

506
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,640
Like somebody says “I am going to teach you how to fly.”

507
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,840
They’re absolutely ready for that.

508
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,920
They’ll pay money, and not doubt, even a bit,

509
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,040
that the fellow who is propagating is he flying?

510
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,760
Have you seen him flying anywhere?

511
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,560
Please at least ask that person to fly.

512
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,840
They will see the Kundalini rising with their eyes,

513
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,880
they will see it pulsating, rising, breaking here,

514
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,440
still they’ll sit down and say “I am doubting.”

515
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,960
Now who are you? How far have you reached?

516
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Why are you doubting? What are you doubting?

517
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,520
What have you known so far about yourself?

518
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,000
Now, humble down yourself at this point Humble down in your heart.

519
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,640
“No I have not known myself. I have to know myself.

520
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,000
I have not known myself, I haven’t got the absolute.

521
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,120
With what instruments I am doubting?”

522
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,920
This is one of the greatest hurdles of Kundalini awakening

523
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,880
and in after awakening, called as Samshaya.

524
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,040
[THE SECOND …del] The fourth one we can call it as Pramaada,

525
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,800
is the one by which we go on faltering all the time…

526
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,440
foolish questions. I mean there are certain things one has to follow,

527
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,920
if you are going on the road you see,

528
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,520
you are used to say continental driving,

529
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,840
so always you turn on the wrong side,

530
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,600
but in London you will be arrested.

531
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,800
In the same way so far you have been doing continental driving.

532
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:35,520
Now you are in London, so you better take to the ways of Londoners

533
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,360
and understand the roads and the maps and the regulations

534
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,800
that are needed, and try to follow them. But you are doubting it.

535
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,360
That’s the main point. Then you don’t want to follow it.

536
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,120
So the pramad is the mistakes that arise,

537
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:03,040
because Kundalini awakening is a free gift to anyone who comes here.

538
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:12,200
To anyone who has been to any sort of hell or heaven or has done…

539
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,840
[Break in original recording, end of tape side 1]

540
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,840
point about it. And why do you doubt. You are not paying any money.

541
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,440
These two things go hand in hand –

542
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,960
doubting and pramad is the mistakes that we commit throughout.

543
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,120
Because we are doubting, that’s why we do not take it up seriously,

544
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,400
we do not understand it – the rule of the road –

545
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:42,000
and we just start driving. And then we have accidents.

546
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,600
And then when we have accidents we blame Mataji for that.

547
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:56,240
That is a very-very, common thing that happens,

548
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,920
that we blame Sahaj Yoga.

549
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,960
We blame that spontaneous happening within us;

550
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,400
we never take the blame upon ourselves,

551
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,440
that “No, I must have done this mistake.” All right, doesn’t matter,

552
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,640
if I make mistakes I will rectify, it’s all right.

553
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,560
Mother is forgiving, no doubt, I forgive,

554
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,320
but sometimes my forgiveness is also of no use

555
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,440
because unless and until you realize that it was a mistake

556
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,320
you should go this way instead of that you have gone that way,

557
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,520
so rule of the road is to be understood.

558
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,800
That is the one comes to us, called as pramad.

559
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,440
After that, we have another inherent problem is called as

560
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,120
Bhramadarshan, hallucinations.

561
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,640
We start seeing hallucinations, specially with people who take

562
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,920
LSD and all [THE …del] such things.

563
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,120
They don’t see Me sometimes they just see lights.

564
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,120
Or any such hallucinations you see of the future or of the past.

565
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,160
They may see Me as something else

566
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,120
and they may see Me as something else.

567
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,520
If you see Me in dreams is all right,

568
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,880
or see something in dreams is all right.

569
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:20,080
But you start seeing some things, that’s called as Bhramadarsha.

570
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,240
Bhrama means illusion. Then you start developing illusions.

571
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,640
But the worst part of it is that people start telling lies about it.

572
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:37,880
I know about everyone. And when this bhramadarshan starts,

573
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,960
it’s the most dangerous thing about vibrations also.

574
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:49,720
Some people are absolutely cocksure about themselves, I see that.

575
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,640
And they’ll tell all the world, you see they’ll dominate everybody

576
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,440
saying that “The vibrations of this is not good,

577
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,160
the vibrations of that is not good,”

578
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,200
while they have no mastery over it.

579
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,840
Now if I, somehow or the other,

580
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,240
see I have to be very careful I can’t talk like a teacher,

581
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,480
so I somehow or other say that “All right, you give yourself a bandhan

582
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,640
and now you put your hands towards me and you see for yourself,”

583
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,080
and all that.

584
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:21,320
If they by any chance know that I’ve found out, that they are lying,

585
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,720
then they are finished.

586
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,600
I must keep up their falsehood everything in me.

587
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,200
In by chance you see, I am very careful though because I know

588
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,560
they are always on a slippery ground,

589
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:42,520
so even if I mention in a way that is not so blunt or anything,

590
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:49,720
still it might happen. But one must know that it is for our good,

591
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:55,440
that we have to stick on to the truth. And we should not be led away

592
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,800
by our own ideas about ourselves.

593
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:11,920
Then [THE – del] another thing comes is – Vishaychitta.

594
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,880
In which the attention is attracted by objects

595
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,960
of your previous identification.

596
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,640
Like your attention has been, “You see I’m very found of cricket,”

597
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,480
“all right, you are.” But you should not be a sick person.

598
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,160
I mean cricket doesn’t mean that you become a cricket bat.

599
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,520
And you are good for nothing for anything else,

600
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,520
for all practical purposes you are dead.

601
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:47,160
That kind of craziness, for anything whatsoever,

602
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,200
gets your attention into a very wrong state,

603
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,200
and is also not good for all the Sahaj Yogis.

604
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,240
Today’s lecture is more for the Sahaj Yogi.

605
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,120
So I am pointing out what are the inherent dangers of

606
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:10,680
sustaining our realization. Which is very important to understand.

607
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:17,400
Now the two other very big dangers which we suffer from,

608
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,120
apart from that the people get possessed

609
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,840
and get ideas into their heads,

610
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,440
they start singing songs, this that Sometimes I am so embarrassed,

611
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,520
I don’t know what to say, I can see a devil speaking through them,

612
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,520
but I just don’t know how to tell them that “Oh please stop.”

613
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,120
Even praising Me I know what it is.

614
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,200
But they’ll just come up and say, “Mother, we want to sing a song to

615
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,440
you.” “All right, finished.” I can not say anything,

616
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,520
because they do not know what they are singing.

617
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,360
They do not know from where did they get this knowledge.

618
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:55,560
It’s something else doing this.

619
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,560
Because of all these problems that you get possessed,

620
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,480
the other day somebody came to me and said,

621
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,920
that “Mother I’m feeling very overconfident about myself and cocksure.”

622
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,320
“Really?”“And I feel like doing something very high handed,”

623
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:20,120
and he did it. First he saw the possession coming in to him.

624
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,000
And then he did it, and did it in a very bad way.

625
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,880
Everybody’s angry with him. I know, but I’m not.

626
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,720
Because something is done in possession,

627
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,320
you don’t know what madness people can do when they get possessed.

628
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,600
I mean they should end up in lunatic asylum, but because of being

629
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,360
Sahaj Yogis, they do all these things.

630
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:50,840
But still they are not stationed where they should be.

631
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,040
Then there are two more stages in which,

632
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,680
a Kundalini which rises also falls down.

633
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,360
This is an inherent danger in a person. Many people have asked Me

634
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,400
that “Mother, if we get realization does it stay?”

635
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,880
It does stay, part of it. Sometimes it is very thin part of it,

636
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,640
sometimes the whole thing is sucked back. It is sucked back.

637
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,600
Is so, then you will say “Then we start doubting.”

638
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,560
Where is it written that, “You will be lifted up

639
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:36,680
and put into something great, whatever may be your problems.”

640
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,680
Is it possible? Even from here if I have to go to India,

641
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,360
I have to get inoculations and vaccinations,

642
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:50,200
and I have to get My passport, go through an interview…

643
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,400
While if you have to enter into the kingdom of God,

644
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,160
then you are going to be judged, not only judged,

645
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,280
but even when supposing you give a grace mark and all that

646
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,400
and a person is allowed to sort of, get into the plane,

647
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:11,040
may be that they may ask you to get down. Is possible.

648
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:16,480
And that happens with some people that the Kundalini falls down.

649
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,520
Is very, very dangerous sign. It comes through many problems

650
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,360
like gurus and, going to wrong places also going to spirits

651
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:36,120
and doing all black magic and, also bowing before people who are not

652
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,560
incarnations, worshipping wrong type of deities and also doing

653
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:48,920
mad rituals. Fasting at wrong times and not understanding

654
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,800
the signs of fasting and of ritualism and chakras and the

655
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,920
connection a complete synthesis of Sahaj Yoga.

656
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,880
And it falls down. In some people you have seen that Kundalini rises

657
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,040
and immediately falls down is a very, very dangerous thing which

658
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,800
really is very troublesome also.

659
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
But still one can fix it up.

660
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,480
Last danger that we have which one should know that you start feeling

661
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:26,960
that you have become God or some like an incarnation or something.

662
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,240
This is the biggest danger. And then you start taking law into your

663
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:39,400
own hands and start rebuking others or… doing all kind of highhanded

664
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:47,160
business. Or getting over self-satisfied with yourself.

665
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,800
This is a very big danger.

666
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:57,440
Humility is the only way, to know that there’s an ocean before you.

667
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:03,080
You have got into the boat all right, but you have to know a lot,

668
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:08,520
you have to understand a lot, and you have to still attend to your

669
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,480
attention, to your chitta, to your awareness.

670
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,240
And you have to still work it out in such a way

671
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:25,600
that you really establish your self, as a full-fledged Sahaj Yogi

672
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,800
by which collectivity becomes a part and parcel of your being.

673
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,680
By which you have no doubts left.

674
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,160
From thoughtless awareness you jump into doubtless awareness.

675
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,280
Unless and until that happens within you, is not mind,

676
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,480
but is a state in which only the Kundalini will rise,

677
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,160
whenever you’ll raise your hands.

678
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,440
Unless and until you have achieved that state,

679
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:58,520
please try to work it out, don’t be lazy.

680
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,200
You have to see around yourself, meet people, talk to them,

681
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,720
the more you talk about it the more you do it the more you give it,

682
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,000
the more it will flow.

683
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,280
The more you sit at home, “Oh, I am doing my puja at home.” Nothing.

684
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,800
It will stagnate and stagnate. You have to give it to others,

685
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
you have to think of others. Thousands of them have to have it.

686
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,000
And that’s why it is important that don’t get bloated with the idea

687
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,640
that you have all the powers of the world, already manifesting.

688
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,080
Never.

689
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,080
When these powers really manifest you are really not aware of them.

690
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:42,160
Absolutely. I mean imagine the Sun saying “I am The Sun.”

691
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,360
Will he say so? When he is the Sun, what is there?

692
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,320
If you go and ask the Sun “Are you The Sun?”

693
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,520
He said “Yes, by the way I am, what can I do about it?”

694
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,920
It’s that simple, you know you become a very simple person,

695
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,320
absolutely simple, because there is no…

696
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:05,400
camouflage, there’s no complication. You are that.

697
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,000
So, anybody asks you funny questions you say, “By the way,

698
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,920
what is there to ask?, It is so. I mean, if I am a realized soul,

699
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:18,120
I am, what does it matter?”

700
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:26,160
With this understanding we have to go to Sahaj Yoga,

701
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:32,760
which I must say I am surprised, how it is working, miraculously.

702
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,160
And it is working out, but it is you who can settle it,

703
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:45,720
within yourself. Now, among you some are only on the periphery.

704
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,720
We keep them on periphery also, that you know very well.

705
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,800
Some of them come in the center.

706
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:58,840
And some are very few, who are in the inner circle.

707
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,080
All of them are still in a state where they can be thrown out,

708
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,440
like a tangent go down, you see?

709
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,000
And then you don’t understand why a Sahaj Yogi behaves like that.

710
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,280
If you see some Sahaj Yogi behaving like that, going in a tangent

711
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,480
know that you might do the same. So be careful.

712
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:26,160
So, today, at this juncture, when we are celebrating the great event

713
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:30,360
of Christ’ life, let us know that Christ is born within us,

714
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,600
and the Bethlehem is within us.

715
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,480
You don’t have to go to Bethlehem it’s within us.

716
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:47,600
He is there, and we have to look after it. It’s still a child.

717
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,520
You have to respect it, and you have to look after it.

718
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,040
So the light… really glows

719
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:02,160
and people know that you are realized souls.

720
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:07,800
Nobody will doubt that you are not.

721
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:14,600
May God bless you, all.
