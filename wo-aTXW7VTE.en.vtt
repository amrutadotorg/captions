00:35:56.768 --> 00:35:59.997
I am sorry I had to speak in Hindi language

00:36:00.198 --> 00:36:06.127
because the majority of the people know, understand Hindi.

00:36:15.788 --> 00:36:20.595
In the western civilization, suddenly I find

00:36:20.796 --> 00:36:31.324
people have taken to a very licentious, vulgar, despicable life.

00:36:31.525 --> 00:36:38.157
I can't believe how can they be so stupid and idiotic.

00:36:38.358 --> 00:36:43.641
It seems they have no wisdom even to see that this is stupidity.

00:36:43.929 --> 00:36:49.982
Thank God, you have achieved this Self-Realization,

00:36:50.183 --> 00:36:53.593
you got the Light, you are so transformed,

00:36:53.794 --> 00:36:58.466
you look so beautiful. And that

00:36:58.667 --> 00:37:06.524
you have given up all those funny ideas of freedom.

00:37:07.581 --> 00:37:12.062
It’s so clear cut. This must be,

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:16.410
I don't know what to say, that in those western countries,

00:37:16.611 --> 00:37:21.378
to find out people who have

00:37:21.579 --> 00:37:28.902
such wise understanding of pure love

00:37:29.103 --> 00:37:34.180
and respect for your own purity.

00:37:34.381 --> 00:37:40.220
As if suddenly you have come out of that darkness

00:37:40.421 --> 00:37:45.974
and have bathed in the light of the divine.

00:37:46.175 --> 00:37:48.601
It’s not possible otherwise.

00:37:48.802 --> 00:37:54.866
See the history of the western countries is
they never had very great kings, you know.

00:37:55.067 --> 00:37:58.588
One king in England, killed seven wives, you know.

00:37:58.789 --> 00:38:02.159
If you - In India if one wife was killed

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:08.852
he would have been killed, first of
all, before he killed the second one.

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:13.186
So, one sees that, despite all that kind of a history

00:38:13.387 --> 00:38:17.059
and that kind of a vulgarity that has been going on

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:22.345
for days together and now it is the worst after war.

00:38:22.657 --> 00:38:26.242
Suddenly you people have come up like lotuses

00:38:26.443 --> 00:38:31.647
and have made those countries so fragrant and so beautiful.

00:38:31.848 --> 00:38:36.925
But now they are afraid because they believe in licentiousness,

00:38:37.126 --> 00:38:40.774
they believe in vulgarity. They think it is their freedom,

00:38:40.975 --> 00:38:44.417
so they do attack, but you are not to be bothered

00:38:44.618 --> 00:38:49.766
because you have achieved something that is real,

00:38:49.967 --> 00:38:55.353
that is for eternal life.

00:38:55.554 --> 00:39:03.639
They supposed to be Christians, Jews
and also Muslims there.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.576
Among all of them I am surprised to see

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:11.592
how they have interpreted these three great religions,

00:39:11.793 --> 00:39:16.878
in the most contradictory way.

00:39:17.079 --> 00:39:23.513
For Christ has said that if you make any sin with your eyes,

00:39:23.714 --> 00:39:27.989
commit some sins, then remove your eyes, yourself.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:36.008
If one hand does anything wrong, you cut that hand.

00:39:36.209 --> 00:39:40.326
I have never seen anybody without an eye or without a hand

00:39:40.527 --> 00:39:43.548
in the whole of this Christian kingdoms, nowhere.

00:39:43.749 --> 00:39:48.984
They can cut other's, but their own eyes I have never seen.

00:39:49.185 --> 00:39:52.944
It is very difficult to be a Christian, I tell you,

00:39:53.145 --> 00:39:56.873
because this is an impossible situation.

00:39:57.074 --> 00:40:01.269
For that, we can say that it, this was for angels, must be,

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:04.333
for the fallen angels that you take out your eye

00:40:04.534 --> 00:40:09.119
and cut your hand. And then Mohammed Sahib has said,

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:16.881
he thought that why only the men are handled by Christ.

00:40:17.082 --> 00:40:20.087
So he says no no, not that you cut it,

00:40:20.288 --> 00:40:25.383
but let others cut your hand and take out your eyes.

00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:29.770
And for women it is so-

00:40:29.971 --> 00:40:34.548
that they should be buried in the Mother Earth half way

00:40:34.749 --> 00:40:38.365
and should be stoned. Think of American women,

00:40:38.566 --> 00:40:42.756
what would have happened to them?

00:40:44.312 --> 00:40:48.674
So, very difficult to follow Islam also. Impossible.

00:40:48.875 --> 00:40:52.174
They were very great people, very pure

00:40:52.375 --> 00:40:54.626
and they thought that this is the only way

00:40:54.827 --> 00:40:57.261
people can be kept pure. No,

00:40:57.462 --> 00:41:00.039
on the contrary with all these thing - compulsion

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.174
they become extremely immoral.

00:41:03.375 --> 00:41:07.501
This suppression doesn't help.

00:41:08.248 --> 00:41:21.197
And then also, this they call it one that is Islamic laws –

00:41:21.398 --> 00:41:28.120
Sharia, was actually given by Moses to Jews.

00:41:28.454 --> 00:41:34.856
You can find it out in the Bible. It was given by Moses to Jews

00:41:35.057 --> 00:41:38.491
and the Jews would not accept it because they were sensible to say,

00:41:38.692 --> 00:41:41.507
we can't accept this much, too much.

00:41:41.708 --> 00:41:43.708
So that was taken over by Mohammed Sahib,

00:41:43.909 --> 00:41:46.359
better put it for these people.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.415
But with all this doing, people become extremely immoral,

00:41:52.616 --> 00:41:56.748
extremely quarrelsome and go to the other side

00:41:56.949 --> 00:42:02.006
and such an imbalance is created.

00:42:02.798 --> 00:42:09.732
But after Self-Realisation, the Sahaja culture is born within you.

00:42:09.933 --> 00:42:15.089
With the Sahaja culture you come into balance

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:21.018
and people are surprised at the western Sahaja Yogis,

00:42:21.219 --> 00:42:26.893
that Mother how have you made their eyes so pure?

00:42:28.908 --> 00:42:33.986
How can they get rid of these bad habits

00:42:34.187 --> 00:42:38.311
of looking at every woman or every man?

00:42:38.512 --> 00:42:40.678
What have you done to their eyes?

00:42:40.879 --> 00:42:44.495
How have they become so pure?

00:42:44.696 --> 00:42:47.765
It is the light of your own spirit,

00:42:47.966 --> 00:42:51.511
which is shinning through your eyes.

00:42:51.712 --> 00:42:55.352
It's very important. Again, I would say,

00:42:55.553 --> 00:43:01.535
that the women in the west have to understand

00:43:01.736 --> 00:43:03.987
what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:04.188 --> 00:43:07.368
Not dominating anyone.

00:43:07.569 --> 00:43:12.289
Here the women are dominated, not always but to great extent.

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:18.099
And there what you find that women are dominating.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.829
Firstly they believe in divorce

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:26.226
and they try to harass people with that.

00:43:26.427 --> 00:43:34.075
This domination, may be we can say comes from their upbringing.

00:43:34.276 --> 00:43:38.145
But Sahaja Yoga should change completely your ideas,

00:43:38.346 --> 00:43:42.102
and there should be no domination but a complete understanding

00:43:42.303 --> 00:43:48.088
about which I have told you many a times and explained to you.

00:43:49.724 --> 00:43:58.097
Still I must say I am overwhelmed by the response.

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:07.596
And on behalf of the divine power,
I would like to thank you very much.

00:44:12.717 --> 00:44:17.009
It is really a new race that has come up, really.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:21.191
Somewhere, somebody goes wrong or
something happens. Doesn't matter.

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:27.135
On the whole it’s such a beautiful race of people.

00:44:27.336 --> 00:44:29.873
I face them before me.

00:44:30.074 --> 00:44:33.548
Even in dreams people could not have believed it.

00:44:33.749 --> 00:44:37.883
They don't yet believe.

00:44:38.084 --> 00:44:44.742
But it has happened, you must now have an enlightened faith,

00:44:44.943 --> 00:44:50.448
which we call as 'Shraddha'. With that enlightened faith

00:44:50.649 --> 00:45:00.678
I am sure you will adhere to the emancipation of human beings.

00:45:00.879 --> 00:45:04.567
It’s your duty now.

00:45:04.768 --> 00:45:07.630
It is all given free. Of course, Sahaja Yoga is free.

00:45:07.831 --> 00:45:10.828
You can have it free; you don't have to pay anything, all right.

00:45:11.029 --> 00:45:16.090
But, you have to give to others.

00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:20.209
That is very important.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:24.836
It is free to you and you cannot keep it to yourself.

00:45:25.037 --> 00:45:28.899
If you keep it to yourself, you can never be happy,

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:35.510
you can never be joyous. So
you have to be absolutely collective

00:45:35.711 --> 00:45:38.605
and then you will see how it works out.

00:45:38.806 --> 00:45:43.938
Very surprising in all the European countries, in America,

00:45:44.139 --> 00:45:49.565
South America, Australia, Japan,

00:45:49.766 --> 00:45:56.875
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Kuala Lumpur, everywhere.

00:45:57.076 --> 00:46:01.780
I have seen people have become collective

00:46:01.981 --> 00:46:06.034
and they told me Mother, there is no greater joy

00:46:06.235 --> 00:46:12.211
than seeing people getting Self-Realization.

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:19.670
That is the greatest joy one has.

00:46:19.871 --> 00:46:25.067
And this is what, one has to have in your mind.

00:46:25.268 --> 00:46:29.305
Of course there are some people who start criticizing Sahaja Yoga -

00:46:29.506 --> 00:46:33.019
why this, why that? All nonsense.

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:40.090
But actually if you see, everybody who is a deep Sahaja Yogi

00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:45.495
wants that Sahaja Yoga should spread in their own countries

00:46:45.696 --> 00:46:51.392
and then to see that it is accepted all over the world.

00:46:51.593 --> 00:46:56.797
It is such a wisdom, which has come into their mind.

00:46:56.998 --> 00:46:59.472
Otherwise, one fellow told me, “Mother,

00:46:59.673 --> 00:47:04.028
I was only worried about my own house, my family, motorcar

00:47:04.236 --> 00:47:07.258
and this and that. I´ve forgotten all that

00:47:07.459 --> 00:47:12.486
Now I am only worried how will I be able to give

00:47:12.687 --> 00:47:17.002
this joy to others. I cannot be happy alone.

00:47:17.203 --> 00:47:19.669
And that’s what it has happened.”

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.963
And I am very thankful to you, for all of you,

00:47:24.164 --> 00:47:29.653
who have come here all the way to celebrate my birthday.

00:47:29.854 --> 00:47:37.177
And this is just your love and affection for me,

00:47:37.378 --> 00:47:40.583
and I also love you very much.

00:47:40.784 --> 00:47:42.992
May God bless you.
