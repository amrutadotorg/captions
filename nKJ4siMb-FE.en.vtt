00:10.000 --> 00:11.166
SHRI HANUMANA PUJA APRIL 23, 1989

00:11.733 --> 00:12.500
MARGATE, KENT, ENGLAND

00:12.667 --> 00:15.049
It is such a joy today

00:15.398 --> 00:18.877
and the whole atmosphere seems to be bubbling with it,

00:20.845 --> 00:23.932
as if the angels are singing.

00:25.656 --> 00:32.007
And the speciality of Hanumana was that He was an angel.

00:33.533 --> 00:40.533
Angels are born like angels. They are angels

00:41.324 --> 00:45.512
and they are not human beings.

00:47.458 --> 00:51.328
They're born with the angelic qualities.

00:52.388 --> 00:57.651
But now you all have become angels from the human beings.

00:57.878 --> 01:00.301
It's a very great achievement of Sahaja Yoga.

01:07.175 --> 01:12.762
The qualities that are born with the angels

01:14.019 --> 01:16.823
are seen from their very childhood.

01:20.513 --> 01:29.288
Firstly, they are not afraid of untruth, falsehood.

01:32.933 --> 01:38.247
They're not worried as to what people will say to them,

01:39.455 --> 01:41.735
or what they will lose in life.

01:43.297 --> 01:48.747
To them truth is their life, they breathe truth

01:50.942 --> 01:53.527
and nothing else matters with them.

01:55.097 --> 01:59.912
This is the first great quality of an angel.

02:02.291 --> 02:07.230
They will go to any extent to establish truth, to protect,

02:07.738 --> 02:13.859
and to protect the people who are in truth.

02:17.618 --> 02:21.469
It's such a wide range of these angels, all over.

02:22.331 --> 02:24.773
So in the left side we have ganas,

02:24.808 --> 02:28.777
on the right side we have angels. And translated in

02:30.029 --> 02:34.535
Sanskrit language or in any Indian language as devdhoot -

02:34.617 --> 02:37.192
means they are the ambassadors of God.

02:40.584 --> 02:45.683
So now you are the same, you are all angels now.

02:46.696 --> 02:49.479
Only thing, you are not aware that you are angels,

02:49.507 --> 02:51.648
while they were aware from their childhood.

02:54.978 --> 02:57.074
If you know that you are angels,

02:59.866 --> 03:02.831
all your qualities will start shining through

03:05.879 --> 03:08.055
and you'll be amazed that

03:10.059 --> 03:13.647
the quality of standing by the truth

03:16.412 --> 03:22.623
at any cost is so easily managed for you,

03:22.827 --> 03:26.215
because you have been given the right,

03:28.972 --> 03:36.124
you have been given the special blessings, the special protection

03:37.573 --> 03:39.678
from the Divine that

03:40.066 --> 03:43.043
if you stand for the right and if you stand

03:43.425 --> 03:46.837
for the righteous and if you stand for the truth,

03:47.821 --> 03:53.298
all kinds of help to protect you will be given.

03:56.878 --> 04:01.889
Angels are aware of this, they're sure of it, they are certain,

04:02.212 --> 04:05.208
there's a certainty about it. But you are not.

04:08.689 --> 04:12.441
You still sometimes think, “May be, may not be.”

04:13.315 --> 04:19.750
Same style goes on. But believe Me, you are angels.

04:21.420 --> 04:25.230
You have all the powers, and what rights you have!

04:27.546 --> 04:31.865
Human beings cannot get over you,

04:34.990 --> 04:41.251
that’s the speciality of angels, not of saints.

04:42.831 --> 04:44.629
Saint could be maneuvered.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.755
They could be tortured, they could be troubled.

04:51.188 --> 04:58.656
Incarnations may do the same. Incarnations accept it,

04:58.836 --> 05:03.264
they want to have all these penances done to them

05:03.778 --> 05:07.994
so that they create an event in their life

05:10.163 --> 05:15.904
to express themselves in a more dynamic way. If there was no Ravana,

05:16.260 --> 05:18.233
there would have been no Ramayana;

05:20.100 --> 05:23.067
if there was no Kamsa, there would have been no Krishna.

05:26.191 --> 05:31.363
So the incarnations take upon themselves the problems and

05:31.793 --> 05:34.630
also the fight with the evil.

05:36.015 --> 05:42.084
So it looks sometimes that we feel that they suffer, but they don’t.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.331
But angels are a special category,

05:51.099 --> 05:56.159
they don’t take up any problems upon themselves, they just solve them.

05:58.981 --> 06:02.029
If there’s a problem, it’s the angels who solve,

06:03.529 --> 06:08.198
for the saints as well as for the incarnations.

06:09.292 --> 06:12.510
And they have to be told sometimes that “Don’t jump in just now,

06:13.539 --> 06:17.771
we are working out on the stage now, You will jump when we’ll ask you.”

06:18.333 --> 06:22.345
They're ready standing at the door just to jump in.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.926
So anxious!

06:27.360 --> 06:30.042
And they are fixed quantities;

06:30.512 --> 06:33.353
you can rely on them completely.

06:34.793 --> 06:39.002
For example, Shri Hanumana, as you know Him as an angel,

06:39.849 --> 06:45.217
has great capacities, great powers,

06:46.437 --> 06:49.159
and it is His right to use them

06:51.100 --> 06:52.722
and He is very aware of it.

06:54.006 --> 06:58.971
He does everything very amusingly, uses His powers very amusingly.

07:00.191 --> 07:04.894
Like He burnt the whole of Lanka and He was laughing at it.

07:05.694 --> 07:07.812
Then He extended His tail

07:08.524 --> 07:11.548
and put it round the necks of many rakshasas

07:11.891 --> 07:14.359
and He was just playing with them and then flew in the air, and

07:14.361 --> 07:15.811
they all were dangling in the air.

07:18.096 --> 07:21.201
So it’s a playfulness of the angels also

07:22.917 --> 07:24.917
because they're so confident,

07:27.272 --> 07:29.100
they're absolutely aware,

07:32.222 --> 07:36.606
absolutely identified with their personality,

07:37.421 --> 07:40.254
with their powers, with themselves.

07:43.448 --> 07:47.617
Here the Sahaja Yogis sometimes don’t understand

07:48.792 --> 07:51.492
that I have made you into angels.

07:54.577 --> 07:58.066
I’ve not made you into saints, but angels,

07:59.547 --> 08:01.564
and you are always protected.

08:02.796 --> 08:05.547
I can only make angels, I can’t make saints.

08:06.251 --> 08:08.911
Saints are made by their own effort.

08:09.935 --> 08:13.258
The effortlessness doing is like Ganesha,

08:13.889 --> 08:17.699
like Karttikeya, like Hanumana.

08:18.469 --> 08:21.268
The same way you are all made, with the same style.

08:24.461 --> 08:29.636
So try to understand

08:31.314 --> 08:35.350
that what I say about you is the truth.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.418
All kinds of conditionings work

08:41.456 --> 08:44.425
even through you people though you are saints

08:45.892 --> 08:48.291
and you don’t know how to spread your wings.

08:49.390 --> 08:53.293
Still, sometimes I feel that

08:53.788 --> 08:55.976
the rebirth has taken place

08:56.618 --> 08:59.715
and they have all become like angels with wings,

09:00.796 --> 09:04.655
but as little birds, they still have to learn how to fly.

09:07.175 --> 09:09.047
But you must gain your confidence

09:09.062 --> 09:11.751
by your experiences which you have in Sahaja Yoga.

09:13.271 --> 09:17.658
As you were singing yesterday, miracles, every day miracles around you.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.847
These are done by the angels

09:23.866 --> 09:27.297
and they try to convince you that “You are one of us,

09:30.207 --> 09:32.221
just join our company.”

09:34.488 --> 09:37.804
So we have so many angels now sitting here,

09:39.958 --> 09:45.334
and why should not we think of transforming this world?

09:49.474 --> 09:51.274
And there’s one more thing

09:52.097 --> 09:55.337
that you have other than the angels,

09:56.114 --> 09:58.617
because angels do not raise the Kundalini,

10:02.007 --> 10:05.844
they cannot, they're not bothered about it.

10:05.974 --> 10:12.550
They are there to kill, to burn, to suppress,

10:13.516 --> 10:17.132
to remove all the evil people around you.

10:18.668 --> 10:23.250
But they cannot transform, angels cannot transform.

10:24.902 --> 10:29.881
So you have a greater right than they have in the realm of God,

10:30.080 --> 10:33.402
that you can raise the Kundalini of people

10:33.738 --> 10:35.793
and you can give Realization.

10:37.042 --> 10:39.862
But human conditionings are still sticking on.

10:40.925 --> 10:45.534
For example, I wore a ring the other day,

10:46.804 --> 10:49.475
and then My daughter starting teasing Me that

10:49.535 --> 10:52.403
“Now you must only show this finger all the time

10:52.421 --> 10:54.476
to people so that they see Your ring.”

10:57.208 --> 11:00.789
So in the mundane human life, whatever we have –

11:01.029 --> 11:03.752
possessions maybe, powers you see -

11:04.168 --> 11:07.861
for example, somebody is a man with some position,

11:07.891 --> 11:10.230
immediately you can make it out with his

11:10.684 --> 11:13.538
nose and lips, the way they are turned upward.

11:18.505 --> 11:27.011
But the powers that you have in your possession,

11:30.433 --> 11:40.022
you’re afraid to manifest them and to talk about it, to use them.

11:40.447 --> 11:43.071
Imagine, with so many angels

11:44.921 --> 11:47.559
the whole of England should get Realization in no time,

11:50.807 --> 11:58.245
but we are still trying to learn what we are.

11:59.495 --> 12:01.495
Hanumana had no problem

12:04.266 --> 12:08.622
because from His childhood He knew that He was an angel and

12:08.896 --> 12:11.722
He has to do the job of an angel.

12:12.860 --> 12:16.697
But because we were born as human beings and now we have become angels,

12:18.541 --> 12:22.431
we find it difficult to be dynamic like other angels that they were.

12:24.367 --> 12:27.051
Even your thought, collective thought,

12:27.461 --> 12:31.301
even your individual thought, is powerful,

12:32.601 --> 12:34.601
and your attention is powerful.

12:36.906 --> 12:42.357
Because of this fear, or maybe the conditionings as you can call it,

12:43.090 --> 12:46.460
or maybe the ego part which is still sticking onto you,

12:51.802 --> 12:59.196
you still hang around false things,

13:01.788 --> 13:09.350
and that force, that dynamism is not expressed.

13:10.037 --> 13:14.999
We can blame anything, like we can blame lethargy to some country,

13:15.906 --> 13:22.906
ego to some country, but now you have lost your countries completely,

13:23.462 --> 13:27.278
now you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

13:28.658 --> 13:34.725
You’re in a country which has no bounds, which has no limitations.

13:36.607 --> 13:41.579
And then, all these conditionings that are still lingering in you

13:42.765 --> 13:46.832
shouldn’t bother you at all, and shouldn’t

13:47.522 --> 13:53.446
upset you or deter you from doing whatever is your job.

13:55.214 --> 14:01.208
Now imagine, Hanumana as Gabriel had to go

14:01.769 --> 14:10.288
and tell Maria that “There’s a Child which is the Incarnation.

14:12.253 --> 14:19.577
The Savior is going to be born to You.” She was a young virgin.

14:20.392 --> 14:24.363
To break such a news which was horrible compared to

14:26.050 --> 14:28.050
the conditionings of those days.

14:29.645 --> 14:31.185
He did it -

14:31.488 --> 14:33.145
“I have to do it so I’ll do it;

14:34.462 --> 14:36.462
if that’s the order, I’ll do it” -

14:38.386 --> 14:42.269
because He knew that the carrying out of the order

14:43.654 --> 14:49.315
is His nature, is built within Him

14:50.441 --> 14:52.668
and He’snot going to doubt it.

14:54.511 --> 14:59.558
He’s not going to wait, but just told and He does it.

15:03.542 --> 15:06.890
So a great understanding has to be within us,

15:07.694 --> 15:10.072
that we are growing within ourselves.

15:10.457 --> 15:12.457
But if we do not manifest,

15:12.860 --> 15:14.860
if we do not show our qualities,

15:15.867 --> 15:19.009
and if we do not express it in our life,

15:19.956 --> 15:24.498
in our doing, in our object, in the meaning of our life,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.050
then Sahaja Yoga is not going to spread.

15:28.603 --> 15:30.603
Nor is it going to help you much.

15:36.885 --> 15:45.145
The kind of work you have to do has no problems with it.

15:48.635 --> 15:50.635
I have problems, not you.

15:52.544 --> 15:54.032
You don’t have to face problems.

15:54.057 --> 15:56.259
You go and talk to anyone, whatever you feel like.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.823
They will jolly well have to listen to you, I should say.

16:02.174 --> 16:04.282
But if they don’t, they can’t harm you.

16:05.152 --> 16:07.152
They can’t do any harm to you.

16:10.967 --> 16:16.045
This is a very great protection you have, they cannot hinder your work.

16:20.660 --> 16:24.137
Coming to Sahaja Yoga is not what we have gained,

16:25.684 --> 16:27.117
what we have got.

16:28.059 --> 16:31.214
See the people who say, “We've done so much for Sahaj Yoga

16:32.455 --> 16:34.004
and what Sahaja Yoga has given us?”

16:34.078 --> 16:35.859
It has given you Self Realization.

16:36.104 --> 16:39.047
It has given you the angel status.

16:41.121 --> 16:43.093
I mean you try anything else,

16:43.831 --> 16:49.114
can you get the status of an angel? You cannot.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.911
Sahaja Yoga has given you that status,

16:53.738 --> 16:56.120
so what more do you want?

16:57.886 --> 16:59.904
It was never possible before,

17:01.743 --> 17:04.578
believe Me, impossible situation.

17:05.257 --> 17:08.739
If it was possible in any way, then

17:09.505 --> 17:13.181
Gyaneshwara would not have taken His samadhi at such a young age,

17:14.981 --> 17:19.940
and Kabira would not have said, "Oh God, what am I to do?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.073
This world is blind."

17:26.662 --> 17:31.575
So you have that subtle power within you

17:31.617 --> 17:35.070
that you can work out on people’s Kundalini without even

17:35.182 --> 17:36.568
they knowing about it.

17:43.235 --> 17:45.686
But in meditation when you sit down,

17:46.823 --> 17:49.424
you must admit to yourself, “I’m an angel,

17:52.302 --> 17:54.302
and as being an angel,

17:55.476 --> 18:00.791
I have no attachments with anything else but with God’s work.”

18:01.219 --> 18:06.327
Attachments are so many still in Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen people have,

18:09.045 --> 18:13.668
like attachments to, now because they're married,

18:14.096 --> 18:16.270
so they have attached to wives,

18:17.452 --> 18:20.926
and so many have fallen out because of their wives attachments.

18:21.402 --> 18:23.769
Then they have attachments to their children,

18:24.461 --> 18:28.018
and so many will fall out if they have attachments to their children.

18:28.415 --> 18:30.206
As I told you yesterday

18:30.475 --> 18:32.624
that all the children of the world

18:32.660 --> 18:34.679
who are Sahaja Yogis are your children.

18:35.777 --> 18:37.628
You're the parents of all the children;

18:38.768 --> 18:43.056
it’s not that if your child is sleeping you cover that child.

18:43.136 --> 18:44.862
No, you cover all the children.

18:45.416 --> 18:48.472
You have to look after all the children which are lying down.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.436
Can you think of Hanumana, if He was here

18:52.600 --> 18:55.304
and when the children were sleeping It would just

18:55.343 --> 18:58.032
cover the body of one child?

18:59.002 --> 19:01.002
Because He’s a universal being.

19:05.499 --> 19:10.230
So every child has to be loved the same way, cared for by you.

19:13.331 --> 19:23.315
Then there are other attachments like possessions, positions, jobs.

19:25.851 --> 19:28.518
I have none so I don’t know what others are,

19:34.178 --> 19:38.326
except for when I see you

19:39.225 --> 19:42.389
so much lovingly coming to the station,

19:43.699 --> 19:47.526
then the whole heart becomes like an ocean, I think, and just

19:47.835 --> 19:54.671
starts like a big swell of a tide, like that and I see that.

19:55.283 --> 19:59.342
And then when I have to leave you, again it recedes back like a sea

20:00.036 --> 20:02.036
which is now receding.

20:03.088 --> 20:05.482
It’s something like, you see the moon

20:06.081 --> 20:11.811
and the sea starts reacting to the beauty of the moon,

20:11.842 --> 20:14.521
the joy of the moon, the love of the moon.

20:15.688 --> 20:22.688
Then I see the love, the love that is you see in a nest

20:23.278 --> 20:26.908
where a bird is feeding its young ones.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.139
And you see this love in the sky,

20:30.576 --> 20:33.057
then you see this love in your heart,

20:34.990 --> 20:40.798
and only thing that you can describe is the feeling

20:41.191 --> 20:47.945
of tremendous ocean of joy within you, just flowing out.

20:54.562 --> 21:03.463
The attachments do not give you capacity to enjoy that ocean.

21:04.101 --> 21:06.264
If you are standing on the shore,

21:06.871 --> 21:10.482
how will you enjoy the ocean? You have to jump into it.

21:11.265 --> 21:17.647
But you’ve got your anchorage onto different things, so you can’t jump in.

21:19.940 --> 21:22.942
And you are so safe.

21:23.333 --> 21:27.810
You know how to swim, you know how to kill a shark,

21:28.745 --> 21:32.136
even one sight of yours is sufficient.

21:32.999 --> 21:36.228
But because you're not aware, it is not acting.

21:36.515 --> 21:38.112
Absolutely this is the case.

21:42.892 --> 21:44.290
I've seen people

21:44.450 --> 21:48.039
who get small positions in life and they start boasting about it,

21:49.436 --> 21:51.622
“I met this-and-this man, I met

21:51.653 --> 21:54.795
that-and-that man, and this happened and that happened.”

21:55.355 --> 21:57.919
You feel like laughing at the person I mean.

21:59.142 --> 22:01.843
But you have met Sahaja Yoga,

22:02.086 --> 22:04.893
by which you have grown, you have been nourished,

22:05.324 --> 22:06.839
you have become so great.

22:10.707 --> 22:18.274
With all this we have to follow the line of Hanumana.

22:22.247 --> 22:25.064
He thought the sun is very egoistical,

22:26.425 --> 22:30.682
trying to burn people. Sometimes there's too much heat,

22:32.430 --> 22:35.481
and the sun worshippers also are egoistical.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.566
They have so much ego in them.

22:41.601 --> 22:49.251
Any word if you say wrong in their language,

22:49.865 --> 22:52.978
or in their customs, say you hold

22:53.000 --> 22:56.214
the fork in the wrong hand – finished!

22:57.055 --> 22:59.179
You are the worst person in the whole world,

22:59.689 --> 23:01.689
committed the greatest sin.

23:03.563 --> 23:11.868
All such small, stupid ideas come out of a very depraved ego.

23:13.790 --> 23:15.790
Ego is so depraved

23:17.052 --> 23:19.386
when you start thinking no end of yourself -

23:20.716 --> 23:22.716
that “I'm everything

23:24.347 --> 23:26.347
and I know everything,”

23:26.580 --> 23:30.754
and “this custom is the best,” or “that carpet is the best.” “I, I,

23:31.177 --> 23:33.542
I don’t like.” Well, who are you?

23:34.852 --> 23:37.237
Who asked you to like it or not to like it?

23:39.881 --> 23:42.772
“I don’t like this, I don’t like that.”

23:43.338 --> 23:48.251
On the other side, the egoists always becomes slaves also.

23:51.694 --> 23:56.944
I must say that after going through the countries

23:58.469 --> 24:03.666
which are following certain norms,

24:04.109 --> 24:06.565
which are dictations of the ego.

24:07.917 --> 24:09.917
Like an artist, now for example.

24:10.315 --> 24:13.006
An artist produces something for his joy,

24:13.559 --> 24:17.654
but he must be criticized by everyone.

24:19.217 --> 24:20.835
The criticism should be,

24:20.976 --> 24:24.089
“I don’t like this, this color is no good, that is not.”

24:24.119 --> 24:26.119
And you have professionals who do this.

24:28.195 --> 24:31.856
They don’t know how to even draw one pencil line properly

24:34.059 --> 24:36.059
leave alone painting anything,

24:36.565 --> 24:40.571
but immediately they’ll say, “I think this, this is …you see.”‘

24:40.816 --> 24:43.600
They have made books out of it,

24:46.673 --> 24:49.009
theses and theories.

24:50.109 --> 24:50.735
I mean,

24:51.985 --> 24:55.389
art has something to do with your heart and not with your brain.

24:56.910 --> 25:00.089
That’s how you have killed so many artists.

25:01.505 --> 25:04.900
And everybody who is painting has to think

25:05.065 --> 25:07.720
what people will say about this.

25:08.629 --> 25:13.152
But as a result of that, something absolutely absurd,

25:14.433 --> 25:15.605
gross,

25:18.331 --> 25:23.734
without any subtle expression, is today appreciated.

25:26.954 --> 25:28.995
This is because of our ego

25:29.301 --> 25:33.657
which has suppressed every proper, spontaneous,

25:33.723 --> 25:40.800
living growth of our thought, of our art and of our life.

25:43.160 --> 25:47.474
I think it’s worse than all the contamination we talk about

25:47.669 --> 25:49.195
or ecological problems.

25:49.207 --> 25:53.037
It’s the human mind which has produced these

25:53.760 --> 25:58.753
suffocating areas where nobody can express anything,

26:04.305 --> 26:07.438
and the one who has a greater ego dominates.

26:07.717 --> 26:10.087
“This book has been written by such-and-such person.”

26:10.129 --> 26:12.537
You meet that person, you feel like jumping in the sea.

26:16.171 --> 26:18.790
So everything written is not a bible,

26:19.422 --> 26:22.265
and those mostly who write are people

26:23.449 --> 26:26.833
whom you should never meet without a bargepole.

26:30.995 --> 26:35.991
So anything that is expressed, you see, say in a dress or

26:36.507 --> 26:38.308
in relationship with your children,

26:38.600 --> 26:41.816
in relationship with your teacher, in relationship with anyone,

26:42.120 --> 26:45.506
has to be so and so and so.

26:47.620 --> 26:49.920
You must say “thank you” many a times;

26:50.841 --> 26:52.841
you must say “sorry” many a times.

26:54.041 --> 26:57.726
So we are so much curbed into artificial expressions

26:58.066 --> 27:01.370
that I think after some time there will be no art produced.

27:02.688 --> 27:04.688
There’s no exuberance.

27:05.071 --> 27:06.714
They cannot, they're afraid.

27:09.256 --> 27:11.256
I don’t know if you have noticed this or not,

27:13.035 --> 27:19.318
but those who go to see any museum, or go to see any exhibition,

27:19.381 --> 27:24.060
anything, think, all of them, to be great,

27:24.306 --> 27:32.176
some divine personalities that they can judge everyone.

27:34.135 --> 27:37.397
Through the Agnya that we judge,

27:38.002 --> 27:41.427
that is what Hanumana wanted to eat once for all.

27:43.604 --> 27:46.992
There’s the movement of the Agnya which goes right and left, you see,

27:48.136 --> 27:49.785
which makes us

27:50.437 --> 27:54.626
express our so-called, nonsensical personality of a ego.

27:55.646 --> 27:59.592
It’s the one that He tried to control and eat it off.

28:00.210 --> 28:03.639
As I eat bhoots, perhaps He was eating this sun.

28:04.621 --> 28:12.648
But for an angel it is important to know that

28:13.808 --> 28:15.808
there is no ego within you.

28:19.304 --> 28:21.304
There are some Sahaja yogis

28:22.617 --> 28:25.674
who say, “Mother, I didn’t want to do too much of

28:26.001 --> 28:28.824
Sahaja Yoga work because my ego will come up.”

28:30.697 --> 28:34.538
Many. “I don’t want my ego to express it.”

28:35.089 --> 28:39.264
But why do you want your ego to be destroyed, for what?

28:39.653 --> 28:41.211
For Sahaja Yoga work isn’t it?

28:43.091 --> 28:50.908
What a vicious circle it is that we say that we want to

28:53.146 --> 29:01.209
keep ourselves in the background because our ego should not develop.

29:01.419 --> 29:03.419
You are just thinking about yourself.

29:06.102 --> 29:07.831
What about Sahaja Yoga?

29:08.558 --> 29:12.656
So nowadays the trend is, “Oh, better be on the safe side.”

29:13.612 --> 29:19.356
Because they have seen some people who were very egoistical,

29:19.801 --> 29:24.656
who were very dashing about Sahaja Yoga,

29:24.775 --> 29:31.223
who tried to show off – had to fall.

29:33.798 --> 29:37.995
So another trend has started, I feel, in Sahaja Yoga that

29:38.169 --> 29:40.169
“Better be on the safe side,” you see.

29:44.750 --> 29:47.473
Between these two, Sahaja Yoga will be lost.

29:50.354 --> 29:55.266
So if you know you are angels, you'll have no ego.

29:58.592 --> 30:02.551
Anybody who knows that it’s his nature to do something.

30:03.625 --> 30:08.274
Like today My husband was praising Me saying that

30:08.314 --> 30:11.354
“It is You Who has done it.” I said, “Not Me. It’s not Me.”

30:12.168 --> 30:13.751
He said, “How do You say it is not You?”

30:13.758 --> 30:16.856
“Because,” I said, “It is innately built in them.

30:17.052 --> 30:22.928
A seed, if it is planted in the Mother Earth, then it sprouts.

30:23.303 --> 30:25.769
In the same way, they have innately built within them

30:25.880 --> 30:27.554
their Kundalinis It sprouts.

30:27.650 --> 30:29.528
So how is it I have done?”

30:29.606 --> 30:32.795
“But,” he said. “But the Mother Earth has done it.”

30:32.896 --> 30:33.859
I said, “No,

30:34.794 --> 30:37.967
it's the quality in Mother Earth which is built in, has done it.”

30:42.722 --> 30:45.674
So he said, “Then who has done all this?”

30:56.605 --> 30:59.519
So I said, “It's done by Adi Shakti, agreed.

31:02.819 --> 31:07.538
But, Sahaja Yoga is not done by Adi Shakti.

31:08.759 --> 31:12.534
She has created these powers in everyone which works out,

31:13.154 --> 31:14.959
but Sahaja Yoga is not.

31:15.839 --> 31:19.781
Sahaja Yoga works through the innate qualities

31:21.211 --> 31:24.164
that are in the Mother Earth and that are in the seed.

31:27.268 --> 31:33.464
So I’m here as... not as Adi Shakti.

31:34.016 --> 31:38.562
I’m here as their Mother, as their Holy Mother,

31:39.715 --> 31:43.296
and as Holy Mother I’ve guided them.”

31:43.498 --> 31:51.302
You can say I’m like the Mother Earth  who sprouts the seeds.

31:54.230 --> 31:59.855
So then another detachment can come in, into you,

32:00.712 --> 32:06.050
that these are your powers within you which have been

32:06.732 --> 32:11.180
just enlightened by your innate nature of Kundalini.

32:13.301 --> 32:17.988
And that you are empowered, yourself.

32:24.526 --> 32:28.687
And all this power that is within you

32:32.328 --> 32:36.775
is only told by Me that it is within you. You see for yourself.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.391
Only like a mirror I’m telling you,

32:38.408 --> 32:40.584
“You are this, see for yourself.”

32:41.354 --> 32:43.414
So how can I take any credit for it?

32:44.885 --> 32:48.720
So you can even have detachment to understand that

32:49.590 --> 32:54.595
the powers that we have is for Sahaja Yoga.

32:54.744 --> 32:59.607
As Mother has powers to work for Sahaja Yoga,

33:00.211 --> 33:03.197
we too have powers to work for Sahaja Yoga.

33:03.300 --> 33:06.069
And as She works, we also have to work.

33:09.801 --> 33:13.057
But there is attachment like this,

33:13.295 --> 33:15.890
“Mother is doing everything, what can we do?”

33:16.869 --> 33:19.582
No! You have to do it.

33:21.156 --> 33:24.527
This is a very important detachment, which I’m trying to say

33:25.172 --> 33:28.835
that you have to do this yourself.

33:29.803 --> 33:31.803
It’s not that Mother will do.

33:32.539 --> 33:34.449
“After all, Mother is doing everything.”

33:34.926 --> 33:37.395
It's correct, that is correct in a way,

33:37.817 --> 33:39.215
but you are the instrument.

33:39.258 --> 33:42.650
Electricity is doing everything here but this instrument has to work.

33:45.948 --> 33:47.948
So the source may be there but

33:48.021 --> 33:51.218
the instrument is the one which delivers the goods.

33:51.784 --> 33:55.463
And like Hanumana, you are the instrument

33:57.426 --> 34:01.207
and you have to work, you have to do the job.

34:01.893 --> 34:04.647
It’s in a very dynamic we should achieve.

34:06.124 --> 34:08.996
Another great quality of Hanumana was that

34:10.296 --> 34:12.296
He was very alert

34:13.423 --> 34:16.221
and that He was beyond time.

34:17.193 --> 34:21.337
When you eat off the sun, where is the time?

34:22.886 --> 34:23.892
He was beyond time.

34:24.609 --> 34:31.572
Because of that, everything He did very fast.

34:33.477 --> 34:36.226
For example, now we are preparing say

34:36.751 --> 34:37.867
a book of Sahaja Yoga.

34:38.262 --> 34:41.908
For the last sixteen years it’s going on.

34:41.919 --> 34:44.445
“It’s working out, Mother, working out.”

34:47.510 --> 34:54.669
Then we are trying to make some arrangements about having

34:55.174 --> 35:01.081
the recording of the sick people and being cured with Sahaja Yoga.

35:01.118 --> 35:04.443
“That’s happening, very good, happening, happening.”

35:07.141 --> 35:13.446
Then we are going to go to Russia to spread Sahaja Yoga.

35:13.564 --> 35:14.484
“Ah, working out.”

35:17.836 --> 35:21.870
All the devils have reached there, but the angels are still working it out,

35:21.989 --> 35:27.389
very patient, very patient angels.

35:30.183 --> 35:35.753
So one of the qualities of Shri Hanumana was that

35:36.172 --> 35:38.149
He was a fast person.

35:38.951 --> 35:41.954
He would do the work before anybody could do it.

35:42.365 --> 35:44.365
He was out beat.

35:44.910 --> 35:51.096
It’s all right to fight in Trafalgar and win and defeat Napolean,

35:52.841 --> 35:59.803
but in the field of dharma and the field of Sahaja Yoga,

35:59.817 --> 36:02.939
I find people don’t understand the importance of time.

36:05.301 --> 36:10.457
We are delayed masters, and dilatory habits we have.

36:10.917 --> 36:14.646
“All right, I’ll telephone. I’ll find out and it will happen.”

36:16.601 --> 36:18.793
This is one of the greatest defects

36:19.577 --> 36:22.516
we have which we have to learn from Hanumana,

36:23.228 --> 36:25.746
that Rama wanted to send word,

36:28.012 --> 36:31.000
so He sent His ring with Hanumana.

36:31.291 --> 36:33.133
Rama could not do that fast,

36:35.991 --> 36:37.665
so Hanumana went and did it.

36:38.254 --> 36:44.449
Then Rama wanted to have this sanjivani, this kind of a herb.

36:45.728 --> 36:52.096
So He sent Him to get from particular mountain.

36:53.449 --> 36:55.463
He said, "Now why to waste time finding it out?

36:55.468 --> 36:56.527
Better take the whole thing."

36:59.640 --> 37:01.640
So He carried the whole mountain there.

37:03.954 --> 37:08.419
“Better do it quickly, immediately, this is the time to do it.”

37:09.618 --> 37:13.444
But, “Next year we’ll see. Mother, You know, after Ganapatipule,

37:13.453 --> 37:14.952
we can consider.

37:15.693 --> 37:17.335
We’ll have discussions,

37:17.352 --> 37:20.035
and then we’ll have arguments," and this and that.

37:23.050 --> 37:26.383
This is one thing about His character one has to know,

37:27.225 --> 37:30.701
that today, when we are worshipping Hanumana,

37:31.748 --> 37:35.790
we should have that quick-wittedness within us.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.083
It is to be done now.

37:42.115 --> 37:43.937
We cannot postpone it anymore.

37:44.724 --> 37:46.353
Already we are very much delayed.

37:46.671 --> 37:48.932
I saw the girls who were wearing frocks,

37:48.936 --> 37:52.442
small little things have grown into big girls now, about to be married.

37:53.152 --> 37:56.031
So I think all My life I'll be marrying only Sahaja Yogis.

37:58.746 --> 38:03.751
To see the results you have to become quick people.

38:04.874 --> 38:08.194
Not to linger and be satisfied with other things.

38:09.255 --> 38:11.255
But positive things, what are we doing?

38:12.798 --> 38:15.445
For example, it’s nice, children have grown up,

38:15.813 --> 38:17.560
they had such a nice drama,

38:17.609 --> 38:19.534
play, all that I enjoyed very much.

38:19.566 --> 38:21.566
It was very good for everybody’s enjoyment,

38:23.161 --> 38:26.916
but job is there, we have to do. We have to do the job.

38:28.334 --> 38:30.334
So attention should be on the job,

38:31.732 --> 38:34.010
and that’s what, what are we doing about it?

38:36.768 --> 38:40.747
I was happy that a suggestion has come from America about

38:41.107 --> 38:43.107
making a video film and things like that.

38:44.765 --> 38:46.765
And then there are obstructions:

38:47.000 --> 38:49.276
“How are we going to get money, what is going to happen?”

38:49.309 --> 38:51.309
You just start it, you’ll get it.

38:52.706 --> 38:54.137
You have powers.

38:56.620 --> 39:01.628
Everything will be synchronized properly, you just start doing it.

39:01.931 --> 39:04.860
But if you behave like human beings - first think

39:05.110 --> 39:07.656
then plan it out, and then cancel it -

39:12.997 --> 39:14.541
it’s not going to work out.

39:17.054 --> 39:20.882
Though Hanumana is running on the Pingala Nadi all the time,

39:21.109 --> 39:24.471
what He does is to spoil our plans

39:26.482 --> 39:29.789
because, instead of Him, we run on the Pingala.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.472
So He says, “All right, you running it? I’ll put you right!”

39:32.633 --> 39:36.070
So He sidetracks all our plans all the time.

39:36.365 --> 39:38.365
That’s how all our planning fails.

39:42.841 --> 39:48.876
We are particular about timing, about things of no importance,

39:50.770 --> 39:56.596
but we are not particular about timings of our progress in Sahaja Yoga.

39:58.453 --> 40:02.033
We must have targets, we must have fixed times,

40:02.115 --> 40:03.871
“All right, by this time we have to achieve,”

40:04.296 --> 40:06.233
but do it little faster is better.

40:09.373 --> 40:12.145
All other things can be managed, but this is your job,

40:12.205 --> 40:13.626
nobody’s going to do it.

40:16.394 --> 40:18.564
Nobody’s going to do it, it’s your job.

40:20.004 --> 40:22.396
I mean you are not going to run the train,

40:23.805 --> 40:25.805
you are not going to run aeroplanes

40:27.838 --> 40:31.502
and you don’t have to run any administration and this stupid politics,

40:32.583 --> 40:34.583
but you have to do Sahaja Yoga.

40:35.962 --> 40:38.507
You have to spread it; you have to bring it

40:38.881 --> 40:41.890
to a level where people can see it.

40:42.961 --> 40:46.728
Now eighteen years have passed, this is the nineteenth year.

40:49.154 --> 40:57.377
So today is the first day of Hanumana’s Puja.

40:57.953 --> 41:00.362
I must say you have to venture.

41:03.630 --> 41:11.224
You have to venture without any fear, collectively and individually,

41:12.363 --> 41:14.146
forgetting as to what will happen.

41:14.222 --> 41:16.222
I mean you won’t go to jails,

41:16.805 --> 41:19.459
you will not be crucified, be sure on that.

41:22.100 --> 41:25.121
I mean if you lose your job, you can get another,

41:25.501 --> 41:29.548
and if you don’t get a job, you can get a dole all right.

41:34.927 --> 41:37.895
So you don’t have to worry about all

41:38.554 --> 41:41.333
useless things which human beings sit down and worry;

41:41.342 --> 41:43.689
but despite that they achieve work,

41:45.541 --> 41:46.821
they do their jobs,

41:49.560 --> 41:52.459
and how much they're wedded to it I’m surprised.

41:52.794 --> 41:54.521
I’ve seen it in My family

41:54.967 --> 41:56.990
how much they're wedded. They have to do this work,

41:57.128 --> 41:59.545
they have to get up in the morning, do this, do that.

42:00.281 --> 42:03.033
But you are not aware that you are angels and this is your work.

42:03.064 --> 42:06.931
You have to do this and nothing else is important.

42:09.817 --> 42:13.535
I hope by today’s puja, that enthusiasm,

42:13.684 --> 42:15.684
that venturesome nature

42:16.768 --> 42:19.436
will vibrate your Pingala,

42:21.268 --> 42:24.519
and without feeling any ego about it,

42:24.724 --> 42:28.428
in the most humble manner as Hanumana was,

42:29.014 --> 42:31.014
you will do the jobs.

42:31.599 --> 42:38.163
Hanumana, imagine, He was given a beautiful necklace of gold

42:38.980 --> 42:46.483
with big, big balls for Him to wear by Sita.

42:46.776 --> 42:51.137
And He opened all of them one by one.

42:51.159 --> 42:54.226
He said, “There is no Rama in this, what will I do with this gold?”

42:56.530 --> 42:58.200
So She said, “Where is Rama?”

42:58.453 --> 43:03.557
He opened His heart and showed it, “See, Rama is here.”

43:06.355 --> 43:09.292
If Rama is there you cannot have ego.

43:11.463 --> 43:15.321
So, so much of dynamism and so much of humility –

43:18.243 --> 43:19.919
what a combination it was!

43:21.224 --> 43:25.850
And that’s what you have to just manifest.

43:26.299 --> 43:30.705
The more you’ll work, the more you’ll assert yourself,

43:32.068 --> 43:36.101
you will find that humility is the only thing that helps.

43:39.350 --> 43:43.161
Obedience is the only thing that helps  to carry out your work

43:43.385 --> 43:45.212
and you’ll become humbler and humbler.

43:45.465 --> 43:48.603
But if you think, "Oh I am doing this," then finished.

43:49.597 --> 43:52.041
But if you know that it’s done by the Divine,

43:52.546 --> 43:55.632
“Paramchaitanya is doing everything, I am just an instrument,”

43:56.008 --> 43:58.870
the humility will be there and you will be an effective instrument.

43:59.215 --> 44:02.844
I hope in this country today,

44:02.856 --> 44:05.491
it was very necessary and it was so timely.

44:06.039 --> 44:09.427
It was all organized by angels that we should have this puja here.

44:09.764 --> 44:11.545
But it’s good for all of you.

44:12.390 --> 44:15.782
You have to really go and see the media people,

44:15.840 --> 44:21.374
go and see these ministers, go and see, say, Prince of Wales.

44:21.392 --> 44:24.743
Go and see another person, meet them, make committees,

44:24.834 --> 44:26.781
see what you can do.

44:26.968 --> 44:28.847
Put your mind to it, "What are we to do?"

44:29.469 --> 44:32.500
But here only, “My mother is sick, my child is sick,

44:32.534 --> 44:37.355
my this thing is sick, my friend is sick my …,” still going on with it.

44:38.889 --> 44:42.614
If you start doing God’s work, your worries are taken over.

44:42.627 --> 44:45.866
You don’t have to worry about anything, just taken over.

44:48.316 --> 44:50.727
But it’s not self-propagation, it’s not!

44:51.692 --> 44:54.091
It’s the propagation of the collective.

44:55.203 --> 44:58.998
I hope today you have understood the subtle side of your being

44:59.010 --> 45:03.146
which is there, which is exhibiting, which I can see clearly,

45:03.522 --> 45:06.831
and that you will, all of you will

45:08.123 --> 45:11.963
in your meditation become aware of what you have within yourself.

45:13.785 --> 45:15.168
That’s the greatest thing

45:15.876 --> 45:19.897
that will please the Divine, and Divine will look after you fully

45:21.479 --> 45:23.899
with the same confidence as the angels.

45:24.567 --> 45:30.703
Like Hanumana you have to go further and work it out.

45:31.160 --> 45:34.790
May God bless you all.

45:51.445 --> 45:54.811
I have to say about the ego part is this,

45:55.472 --> 45:59.351
which is really the problem in the West, why people have so much ego

45:59.562 --> 46:02.543
than Indian people have.

46:03.647 --> 46:05.558
One of the things is that

46:06.036 --> 46:10.784
the right side, as I've told you many-a-times, is like an accelerator.

46:10.955 --> 46:13.466
The left side is like the brake.

46:14.270 --> 46:19.381
So if the Mooladhara is not in control, if the brake is not all right,

46:20.008 --> 46:23.125
naturally that accelerator cannot be controlled.

46:25.901 --> 46:29.479
So basically our Mooladhara should be brought round

46:30.736 --> 46:32.429
and must be put right.

46:32.976 --> 46:37.129
You should work very hard to do that. If your brake is established,

46:37.394 --> 46:39.582
then whatever work you do for Sahaja Yoga,

46:39.774 --> 46:42.419
you'll not get into ego practices

46:43.332 --> 46:47.565
and ego cannot anymore control you.

46:48.329 --> 46:51.645
So that is very important, specially in the West where

46:51.759 --> 46:59.190
it’s being really, dangerously destroyed, the idea of auspiciousness

46:59.700 --> 47:01.700
and of holiness.

47:02.506 --> 47:05.778
So that is the power of any angel

47:06.189 --> 47:09.189
and that has to be fully established within us,

47:09.747 --> 47:13.063
and then on that power will work out,

47:14.207 --> 47:21.207
which gives you discretion, which gives you egolessness.

47:22.165 --> 47:27.555
I hope today both these things will work out within us in such a manner

47:27.803 --> 47:33.003
that we really become absolutely self-confident,

47:34.362 --> 47:39.725
realized souls whom I call as angels of modern times.
