WEBVTT

15:40.036 --> 15:44.435
I’m sorry I had to speak in Hindi language,

15:44.460 --> 15:53.560
because most of the people who are here
are understanding Hindi only.

15:54.212 --> 16:00.174
When I am abroad, all the time
I am speaking English,

16:00.199 --> 16:03.164
nothing else but English language,

16:03.189 --> 16:08.987
and then I want to have some change
for a while.

16:09.012 --> 16:17.845
Regarding today’s great advent
of Shri Jesus Christ,

16:17.870 --> 16:22.949
I told them that He came on this world

16:23.739 --> 16:29.643
with a very great mission, I would say
one of the greatest missions,

16:29.668 --> 16:36.624
because He wanted to open the Agnya
Chakra

16:36.649 --> 16:42.217
which was so constricted, and could not
be done before.

16:42.242 --> 16:45.887
For that He had to sacrifice His life.

16:45.912 --> 16:54.324
By that sacrifice only, the great Agnya
could be opened.

16:54.965 --> 17:02.528
He was aware of it. He knew that it has
to happen,

17:02.553 --> 17:11.191
that He has to somehow accept this
sacrifice.

17:11.216 --> 17:15.358
As it is, He was a divine personality,

17:15.390 --> 17:22.116
He had no problem in doing so. But He
thought that

17:22.141 --> 17:33.275
could be some other way there, by which
you can open this Agnya Chakra.

17:33.300 --> 17:41.479
But He had to sacrifice His life, and
in that sacrifice He has shown

17:41.504 --> 17:50.462
that if you have to rise above this
mundane, superficial life,

17:50.487 --> 17:58.582
you have to in a way sacrifice.
Sacrifice what?

17:58.607 --> 18:05.822
Sacrifice all your six enemies. But
with the Kundalini awakening

18:05.847 --> 18:10.819
all these six enemies completely get
detached.

18:10.844 --> 18:19.551
Depends on how your Kundalini has risen.
If she has risen in a perfect manner,

18:19.576 --> 18:22.802
then I have seen people at the first shot

18:22.827 --> 18:27.762
they just become completely self-realized
people.

18:27.787 --> 18:31.140
Of course there are very few, but there
have been;

18:31.165 --> 18:37.631
while I see most of you have little
problems,

18:37.656 --> 18:43.755
and for most of you it is the problem
of the Agnya Chakra.

18:43.780 --> 18:48.372
How do we get the Agnya Chakra working
so much is this,

18:48.412 --> 18:56.398
that we think as a reaction, as a reaction

18:57.079 --> 19:02.302
to anything outside, we react to
everything.

19:02.327 --> 19:06.539
While I see here all these lamps, I can
react by saying,

19:06.564 --> 19:10.863
“From where did they get all these?
How much it must have cost?

19:10.888 --> 19:17.676
Where are they kept all the year round?”
- All kinds of things. I can react.

19:17.701 --> 19:27.074
This reaction comes from our conditionings,
or from our ego.

19:27.099 --> 19:33.070
Egoistical people are extremely sensitive.
If you give them, say,

19:33.095 --> 19:37.916
something that they think is not very
dignified, they can feel hurt.

19:37.941 --> 19:42.080
They can feel hurt for anything, because
they have a consciousness

19:42.105 --> 19:50.294
that they are something special, something
higher people, and one should behave

19:50.319 --> 19:55.283
with them when they are dealing with
anyone.

19:55.308 --> 19:59.198
And that’s how they get absolutely
disturbed

19:59.223 --> 20:04.943
if they find anybody in any way degrading
them.

20:05.551 --> 20:08.278
This comes from ego.

20:08.303 --> 20:14.345
Ego is a part and parcel of this Agnya
movement,

20:14.370 --> 20:17.762
and the second one is your conditioning.

20:17.787 --> 20:25.328
Now you have a conditioning: say you are
an Indian, now the conditioning is

20:25.353 --> 20:32.264
that a person who comes to meet you
should touch your feet, supposing,

20:32.289 --> 20:34.132
that’s your relationship.

20:34.157 --> 20:39.741
And the person doesn’t touch your feet,
then you are angry.

20:39.766 --> 20:43.957
Anything like that which is your
conditioning,

20:43.982 --> 20:48.437
gives you an idea that you are been
insulted

20:48.462 --> 20:55.483
or in any way you have not been
respected, then you feel bad.

20:55.523 --> 20:58.582
The other reactions of ego are like this,

20:58.607 --> 21:04.311
as I said: I see those lamps and I can say,
“Why not I have it?”

21:04.336 --> 21:07.722
Or if I have them, “Why will I give it
to anyone?”

21:07.747 --> 21:12.882
Ego reactions are there, or conditioning
reactions are there.

21:12.907 --> 21:16.710
These two were to be finished, and that
was done

21:16.735 --> 21:23.448
by the sacrifice of the life of Christ.
Christ Himself was a divine person,

21:23.473 --> 21:31.668
and a divine person is like the sea because
it remains at the zero point,

21:31.693 --> 21:37.054
at the lowest point; it does all work
from that point.

21:37.094 --> 21:45.535
It will make clouds, it will make rain,
and when all the rivers are in spate

21:45.560 --> 21:52.475
they’ll run into the sea, because the sea
remains at the lower point.

21:52.500 --> 22:00.075
So humility is the, one of the criteria
of a Sahaja yoga.

22:00.100 --> 22:05.606
A person who doesn’t have humility
cannot be called sahaja yogi.

22:05.631 --> 22:09.388
I have seen even sahaja yogis get very
angry,

22:09.413 --> 22:13.715
sometimes start shouting and getting angry
and misbehaving.

22:13.740 --> 22:18.909
That’s the sign that he is not yet a sahaja
yogi, he has to still mature.

22:18.934 --> 22:29.611
So this humility of a person will give you
more stationary, I would say,

22:29.636 --> 22:39.221
more permanent state by which you will
not react,

22:39.246 --> 22:44.022
you will not react. You look at anything,
you react.

22:44.047 --> 22:46.655
But then you don’t react, you just watch,

22:46.680 --> 22:51.921
and that is how the new state of witness
state comes into you.

22:51.946 --> 22:56.586
When you become the witness you are
just watching,

22:56.611 --> 23:05.679
just watching; not reacting, not thinking
about it, but you are in the present,

23:05.704 --> 23:12.195
and in the present you just watch, watch
and really enjoy it.

23:12.220 --> 23:20.659
The enjoyment of all the creation is not
within your mind when you are thinking.

23:20.684 --> 23:28.702
And when you are not thinking, the whole
enjoyment of the beauty of all this creation

23:28.727 --> 23:34.472
reflects in you, and gives you tremendous
joy and peace.

23:34.497 --> 23:40.123
So one has to learn that we should not
react.

23:40.148 --> 23:45.710
The today’s problem is, all human beings
are very good at reacting.

23:45.735 --> 23:50.103
Reaction is a basic principle of today’s
life.

23:50.128 --> 23:56.112
You see any newspaper, you see any book,
you meet anyone,

23:56.137 --> 24:01.232
what I find that they are experts
on reacting. They react,

24:01.257 --> 24:11.456
and by reaction what happens, they never
achieve any essence of the thing.

24:11.481 --> 24:17.947
Essence is only through witness state
that you can achieve.

24:17.972 --> 24:25.201
This is what we have to learn from
the crucifixion of Christ,

24:25.226 --> 24:33.030
from His birth, that He was born in a very
humble family,

24:33.275 --> 24:43.350
very poor family, in very adverse
conditions.

24:43.375 --> 24:50.141
The reason was to show that all these
outward things

24:50.166 --> 24:56.370
and all these outward glories do not
make you great.

24:56.395 --> 25:01.703
The greatness is within, and when
that greatness is there

25:01.728 --> 25:08.643
then you don’t care for anything, because
you are so much enriched within yourself

25:08.668 --> 25:15.406
that you don’t bother about other things,
you don’t think about these things,

25:15.431 --> 25:20.528
and you live in your own majestic life.

25:20.553 --> 25:26.609
This is what we see in His life, He was
a very majestic person.

25:26.634 --> 25:31.963
Otherwise if you meet somebody
who is a poor man, say,

25:31.988 --> 25:40.026
and who has felt the poverty, he’ll talk
to you with a beggarish style.

25:40.051 --> 25:45.613
If there’s somebody who is born in a rich
family, he will talk to you

25:45.638 --> 25:54.213
in a very, I should say, outward, outwardly
showing-off nature.

25:54.238 --> 26:01.262
But a person who is a divine person,
all these things don’t touch.

26:01.287 --> 26:08.034
For him riches or not riches, positions
or no power

26:08.059 --> 26:12.540
is all just the same; and when that
happens,

26:12.565 --> 26:18.207
then you should consider that you have
become sahaja yogis.

26:18.382 --> 26:24.215
I’ve seen people who come to Ganapatipule
- now they are very much changed.

26:24.240 --> 26:29.275
Otherwise in the beginning they used
to say, “We don’t have water,

26:29.300 --> 26:36.782
we don’t have this facility, it’s very cold
or hot” - whatever it is.

26:36.807 --> 26:42.236
They were all the time talking as if they
are on a holiday.

26:42.261 --> 26:45.930
It is something very different.

26:45.955 --> 26:51.400
You are here to develop your witness state.

26:51.425 --> 26:55.573
Did you see the sky, how beautiful it was,

26:55.598 --> 27:00.724
how orange, blue, all kinds of colors
were there.

27:00.749 --> 27:09.681
The color it takes automatically,
and is enjoying it. It is not bothered

27:09.706 --> 27:15.307
that it should remain forever, that this
will go away when there is darkness.

27:15.332 --> 27:20.425
Just watching, the sky is just watching.

27:20.450 --> 27:29.079
Whatever comes its way, it takes it. So
it’s so beautiful and it’s so joy-giving.

27:29.104 --> 27:40.717
So the another thing is that when you
are in that state of spirituality,

27:40.742 --> 27:46.440
then you are joy-giving, you are
peace-giving,

27:46.465 --> 27:51.788
you are compassionate, and you love
each other.

27:51.813 --> 27:57.407
All these problems of the ego just
disappear.

27:57.432 --> 28:01.832
Ego is your greatest enemy, I think,

28:01.857 --> 28:11.661
and it is the one that really hinders
all the wealth and beauty of your life.

28:11.686 --> 28:20.747
So if you could just see this ego, how it
works, just you’ll be enjoying it.

28:20.772 --> 28:24.985
It’s a drama it plays - all right,
let’s have it!

28:25.010 --> 28:29.538
You can see the drama and then suddenly
you will be amazed

28:29.563 --> 28:33.403
that you are not in it, you are
watching it.

28:33.428 --> 28:42.246
When you are detached from your ego,
you can see how it tries to entice you.

28:42.678 --> 28:48.722
These are the problems of today, and
that’s why we need Jesus very much.

28:48.747 --> 28:54.383
The problem of today is that people
don’t understand

28:54.408 --> 29:00.155
that how much harm they are doing
to themselves, to others,

29:00.180 --> 29:05.610
and to the whole world by becoming
egoistical.

29:05.635 --> 29:10.591
If they could understand, I tell you,
they would give up.

29:10.616 --> 29:18.354
But the problem is they enjoy their hatred
they enjoy that kind of meanness

29:18.379 --> 29:24.541
or I would say, very low-level living.
While you are all sahaja yogis,

29:24.566 --> 29:31.216
and what you have to do is to understand,
“Why this ego is coming in my head?

29:31.241 --> 29:33.837
What have I done? Who am I?”

29:33.862 --> 29:39.746
Once you go on asking such questions
this ego will disappear.

29:39.771 --> 29:45.726
And it’s a big problem for Me also to deal
with people who have ego,

29:45.751 --> 29:50.705
because I can’t tell them “You have got
ego.” If I tell them, they’ll all run away.

29:50.730 --> 29:55.263
If I tell them, “All right, you are very
good, you are very nice,”

29:55.288 --> 30:01.536
then ego will be bloated. Then they’ll say,
“Oh, Mother told us I’m very nice.”

30:01.561 --> 30:07.933
It’s very problematic. I don’t know how
to deal with the ego of human beings.

30:07.958 --> 30:12.176
I know they have, but I don’t know how
to deal with it.

30:12.201 --> 30:17.997
I think it’s only you can deal with it, if
you will understand what’s wrong with you.

30:18.022 --> 30:24.304
That’s a very good way of solving your
problem, and My problem also.

30:24.329 --> 30:27.782
My vision is too great, I think,
for one life.

30:27.807 --> 30:32.454
I want a global realization, I want people
all over the world

30:32.479 --> 30:38.560
to have realization. It’s very
remarkable how ....

30:53.720 --> 31:09.457
In Sahaj culture we have a proper training
for getting rid of ego.

31:09.482 --> 31:17.602
You can yourself introspect yourself.

31:18.079 --> 31:25.498
You can yourself see why you behave
like this.

31:25.523 --> 31:32.085
The introspection that sahaja yogis can
do cannot be done by other people,

31:32.110 --> 31:37.170
because they can enter into themselves,
they can see for themselves,

31:37.195 --> 31:44.761
they can watch others. And with that
they can just try to see

31:44.786 --> 31:50.543
what is this Mr Ego doing within
your head.

31:50.757 --> 31:56.181
Of course, we know that the mantra
of Christ is the best

31:56.206 --> 32:02.951
for removing all egoistical problems,
and that helps a lot.

32:02.976 --> 32:07.911
But also when you are doing this mantra,
you should be yourself

32:07.936 --> 32:14.923
in a very humble state. “What am I,
after all, who am I?

32:14.948 --> 32:21.880
Look at so many stars, look at so many
beautiful things, and who am I?

32:21.905 --> 32:26.599
What have I done? Why should I be
so egoistical?

32:26.624 --> 32:29.689
Why should I think I’m something great?”

32:29.714 --> 32:35.618
And also other people pamper you, because
they want to take advantage of you.

32:35.643 --> 32:39.984
So they’ll pamper you, they’ll say “This is
very great, you are very great”;

32:40.009 --> 32:44.478
and you just get enamored, get lost.

32:44.503 --> 32:52.122
You are like thrown into the torrential
rain

32:52.147 --> 33:00.328
and you flood out into big, I think, like
a big stream of egoistical people.

33:00.353 --> 33:05.346
And if you see around today in these
modern times,

33:05.371 --> 33:12.008
everybody is quite conscious of their ego,
very conscious,

33:12.033 --> 33:16.454
and the way they are coming up
in the newspapers

33:16.479 --> 33:21.853
or the way they are in some magazines,
I’m quite amazed.

33:21.878 --> 33:26.908
I would feel shy to be there, because
it’s so much

33:26.933 --> 33:35.355
of expression of your ego, nothing else.
All kinds of things they start,

33:35.380 --> 33:38.955
they have competitions of ego,
lots of competitions.

33:38.980 --> 33:45.267
Like they have a beauty competition, then
they have another competition

33:45.292 --> 33:52.048
for Mister, you can say India, Mister this
thing, that.

33:52.073 --> 33:57.703
All these things actually give the person
ego,

33:57.728 --> 34:02.117
and others also run after such
competitions.

34:02.142 --> 34:05.488
They think, “Why am I not? I should be
like that.”

34:05.513 --> 34:10.449
So it’s very deadening and absolutely
blinds your mind,

34:10.474 --> 34:16.166
that you think this is the way one has
to be very successful.

34:16.191 --> 34:21.877
This success lasts for how long?
It perishes in no time.

34:21.902 --> 34:27.379
But success in Sahaja Yoga is what will
last forever,

34:27.404 --> 34:31.832
and everybody will remember it.

34:31.857 --> 34:38.422
The one who has this kind of a humble
nature

34:38.447 --> 34:42.735
will be remembered for generations.

34:42.760 --> 34:51.358
I’ve never seen a statue of a person
who has been egoistical.

34:51.383 --> 34:55.198
On the contrary, if there was some
they used to criticize,

34:55.223 --> 35:00.540
“He was a very egoistical man.”
And nowadays it’s impossible,

35:00.565 --> 35:03.930
anybody who has ego, I don’t think
anybody

35:03.955 --> 35:07.727
is going to sing any songs about
such a person

35:07.752 --> 35:11.650
or going to raise any statues in their
name.

35:11.675 --> 35:17.587
So in the heart of hearts we like humble
people,

35:17.612 --> 35:23.970
and if we want others to like us, we should
be also very humble.

35:23.995 --> 35:28.233
Not artificially, but really,
by understanding

35:28.258 --> 35:30.940
that: “What are we? Why should we
proud,

35:30.965 --> 35:37.077
why should we try to overpower others
and trouble others?”.

35:37.102 --> 35:41.461
If you understand that, you have done
full justification

35:41.486 --> 35:45.933
to the incarnation of Jesus Christ
the great.

35:45.958 --> 35:51.429
And there are so many qualities He has
shown. But the, for us the best is

35:51.454 --> 35:59.958
His passing through the ego sacrificing
His life is the greatest message,

35:59.983 --> 36:02.949
and for that we have to understand.

36:02.974 --> 36:07.981
But those who call themselves are
the most egoistical. I was surprised

36:08.006 --> 36:12.417
that England, English people are
extremely egoistical.

36:12.442 --> 36:17.801
Or otherwise other countries also I’ve seen
in the West, they are very egoistical.

36:17.826 --> 36:21.391
They’ve no humility at all, compared
to Indians,

36:21.416 --> 36:27.065
they are very, very egoistical people.
Why? Because they are following Christ,

36:27.090 --> 36:31.401
can you imagine! Is this the way
we follow Christ?

36:31.426 --> 36:36.299
Those who call themselves Christians
and those who call themselves

36:36.324 --> 36:40.486
very great admirers of Christ should
show in their life

36:40.511 --> 36:46.744
that humility, that compassion, that love.
It is not so.

36:46.769 --> 36:51.092
So specially for people who are from
Western countries,

36:51.117 --> 36:54.140
you must try to learn Sahaj culture.

36:54.165 --> 36:58.810
In the Sahaj culture, how do we talk,
how do we live,

36:58.835 --> 37:05.569
how do we contact, is something very
different. And then once you start

37:05.594 --> 37:12.010
Sahaj culture in your life, you’ll be
amazed, others will be amazed

37:12.035 --> 37:16.457
how you are having a rapport
with each other,

37:16.482 --> 37:21.686
how you are looking after everything
so well.

37:21.711 --> 37:26.105
This is the best way to live in this world
as sahaja yogis,

37:26.130 --> 37:30.665
where there is no ego, there is
no conditioning, nothing.

37:30.690 --> 37:38.958
You are just absolutely free from all
these horrible attributes.

37:38.983 --> 37:46.210
And then you will be amazed how people
will trust you, how they will like you.

37:46.653 --> 37:51.605
I wish you all a very Happy Christmas.

37:59.183 --> 38:03.820
And also remember the message of Christ
and His life.

38:03.845 --> 38:05.859
May God bless you.
