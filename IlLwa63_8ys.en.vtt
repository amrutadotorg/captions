00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:10.790
The reason for celebrating this auspicious day

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.880
is because it is said that Jesus Christ was born this day.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.150
Very little is known about Jesus Christ

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.680
because in young age went out of his house.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.950
and after returning

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.850
He did some great work,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.430
and lived only for 33 years of age.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.600
after that,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:10.300
his twelve disciples spread Christianity.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.150
But, as you all have to face problems sometimes,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.840
they also faced several problems

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.470
But these twelve disciples did tremendous work.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.810
Their followers in the beginning,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.359
were known as Gnostics, meaning ‘Those who have known’

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.370
The origin of this word is from ‘Gna’ meaning To Know’

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.083
And, these people also were tortured

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:54.870
by the priests of that time.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.490
So in the beginning it was very difficult

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.750
to convince people of Christ's thoughts.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.370
But at that time,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.750
People were not seif realised.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.520
Jesus Christ had said it again and again ‘Know Thyself, Know Thyself'

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.840
Even after He said this,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.840
Without realising the significance of self realisation,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.001
people started spreading the religion.

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:38.890
Without knowing the Self, religion could not be spread

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.100
because gradually such religion becomes Adharmas

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.140
And the same thing happened with Christian religion.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.550
It is written that Jesus Christ

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.490
went to a wedding function.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.180
There he put his finger in the water and converted it  into wine,

00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:17.195
It is said in Hebrew language,

00:03:17.838 --> 00:03:22.561
in which it has been written in the beginning,

00:03:22.762 --> 00:03:27.324
that the taste of water

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:36.548
got transformed into

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:45.048
something like the taste of grape juice.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.460
And grape juice is called wine in Hebrew.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.320
Christian people twisted the meaning of the wine to alcohol,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.200
and said we should drink alcohol to celebrate.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.060
and thus among Christians alcohol became famous.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.813
Alcohol is the cause of all Adharma.

00:04:08.813 --> 00:04:13.290
Alcohol gives human beings distracted attention.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.620
How could Jesus say any such thing?

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.100
It is a very easy thing,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.840
I may also do it by putting my hand in it.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.310
and change the taste of water.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.510
But, people took so much to alcohol, that I am astonished!

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.420
I went to England.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.750
There they drank alcohol Whether some one is born or someone dies,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.957
for everything alcohol.

00:04:42.957 --> 00:04:45.919
And, alcohol became so famous

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.220
that they would not talk of anything else.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.320
you go to someone’s house they will offer you a drink,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.990
Without drinking they do not know how to talk to you

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.810
so, thus alcohol became prevalent

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.630
But, if someone says that Jesus Christ advocated this,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.580
it will be the most injustice thing.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.220
None of the incarnations,

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.210
could ever teach you to go against  the religion.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.320
In India also tne use of alcohol has become prevalent.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.650
When we were young during the time of British rule,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.960
Indians were not used to drinking as for as I know,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.430
May be except some highly placed people, no one else used to drink.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.591
Now even common men could be seen drinking.

00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:47.790
No one thinks of the miserable state alcohol drags the person in,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.900
and commit sins.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.100
So, first thing I want to tell you,

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.340
that the drinking by the Christians is not a religious activity,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.130
so much so, alcohol is made in the Church of Rome.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.060
To commit sins (Adharma) in the name of religion (Dharma)

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.740
is unpardonable sin, in my opinion.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.350
That is how people accept all the evils,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.730
The aim of Jesus Christ was

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.920
to open the centre ol Agnya chakra which is within you.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:37.750
and to achieve that purpose He got Himself crucified,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.700
And after that He resurrected.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.000
It appears to be a miracle

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.110
but for the Divinity there is no miracle as such.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.850
He proved that human beings could rise above the centre of Agnya,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:08.920
and on this centre he told two mantras which we call Beeja Mantras,

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.020
– Ham and Ksham’

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.190
Ksham’ means to forgive.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.580
Ksham is the biggest mantra

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.530
The person who knows how to forgive,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:30.934
his ego gets destroyed completely.

00:07:30.934 --> 00:07:35.791
For every small thing a person has ego.

00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:39.970
For example if you tell someone to sit on the ground,

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.989
his ego gets hurt,

00:07:41.989 --> 00:07:43.970
If some one is told to sit on the chair,

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.940
then he will say why have you given me a small chair.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.860
Everyone has some imaginations about self,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.160
and if his expectations are not fulfilled,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.529
his ego immediately comes up.

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:05.640
Unknowingly some times such things could happaen.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.130
And unknowingly also if such things take place,

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:15.480
the egoistical people take it as their insult.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.440
And like this

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:26.224
Such people make their condition very miserable

00:08:26.224 --> 00:08:33.488
All the time they think they are being insulted and humiliated

00:08:33.488 --> 00:08:36.500
He is always obsessed with this thought

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:43.100
and he draws negative meaning of whatever is told to him.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:50.800
So, we have to think and see, of what Jesus Christ had said,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:59.640
’Forgive those who have hurt you or troubled you’

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.354
Now see, if you forgive everyone,

00:09:04.354 --> 00:09:05.970
then what will happen?

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:11.470
You will neither suffer nor get disturbed mentaly.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.440
You will not think of the person whom you have forgiven.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:23.647
Nothing could happen against you

00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:27.650
because you have forgiven everyone.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.442
We get this power from the centre of Agnya.

00:09:33.442 --> 00:09:38.903
The person whose Agnya is clear, forgives everyone.

00:09:38.903 --> 00:09:41.603
what other choice do we have?

00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:48.110
If we do not forgive we torture ourselves and trouble ourselves,

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:54.870
and the other person, who probably has hurt us  knowingly,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.350
will assume power over us.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.990
So ‘Forgiveness’ is the greatest

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.000
message that Jesus Christ has given to mankind.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.660
Second is ‘Ham’,

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:16.870
It has altogether opposite meaning of "ksham".

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.990
Ham means To Know thyself.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.000
You have to know that you are the Spirit.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:32.434
You are not this body, mind, brain or ego, but You are the Spirit!

00:10:32.434 --> 00:10:38.010
When you know this ‘Ham’ then you will know that you are the Atma.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:43.640
The ‘Spirit’ means that all the wrong things,

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:51.000
like, the ego, foolishness, ignorance that we have in our mind,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.780
are useless and meaningless.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.674
When you are the Pure Spirit,

00:11:03.674 --> 00:11:07.690
these negativities have absolutely no place in this spirit.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.930
And You are very pure.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:19.502
So, He told two things, the first is to Forgive everyone,

00:11:19.502 --> 00:11:24.090
Knowingly or unknowingly if someone troubles you, you forgive him.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.960
This way you will not get tortured.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.538
whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do, nothing.

00:11:30.538 --> 00:11:36.870
But if you donot forgive then you torture yourself.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.270
Because the person who troubled you is sitting nicely.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:49.740
So, if any such thing happens, you must develop the habit to forgive.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.430
Second thing that he told is that ‘You are the Spirit".

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.910
Know this Spirit,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.900
No one can touch the spirit or destroy it, or torture it,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.600
If you are that spirit then you should be established in it

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.090
But, to achieve this Atma tattva,

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:18.180
the awakaning of Kundalini is necessary

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.600
And after the awakening of Kundalini,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.100
you need to get established in it.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.380
You need to be in it,

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:33.950
Untiil you are established you will remain entangled in stupidies.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.740
So, one should know how to be established with in.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.270
to remain with in thyself.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:45.690
When you start to establish within self,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:52.200
you will feel a kind of extreme peacefulness within

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.600
and nothing will disturb you

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.000
When you get established in this aura of peace,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.220
then you will be surprised,

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:16.150
that small small things which used to worry you always,

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.270
will come to an end.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.360
You will be always drenched in the joy of Spirit.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:29.780
To attain the Spirit, as I told you,

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.650
the awakening of kundaltni is very essential,

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.690
Without that it is impossible.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.618
But, even after that,

00:13:36.618 --> 00:13:39.420
after the awakening

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.960
people keep getting lost

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.540
They do not go in depth.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.140
So, if the central point is your Agnya,

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.190
If you aim at it and see

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.910
then you will come to know that it is confusing you.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:11.970
Because of it you are entangled, caught in different thoughts.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.107
and having different problems

00:14:16.107 --> 00:14:19.910
But, when you cross this centre of Agnya

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.407
and go beyond it

00:14:22.407 --> 00:14:29.640
then all these problems of yours will be over.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.380
That is why this agnya chakra is very significant.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.908
So much so, it is written in the Bible that

00:14:37.908 --> 00:14:43.370
those who apply vermillion on their forehead will be saved.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.233
It is written.

00:14:45.233 --> 00:14:50.030
They could be none else but Sahaia Yogis

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.430
Its a stupendous task.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:09.150
Jesus Christ had only twelve disciples, but you are thousands

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.382
But, the kind of effort each of the twelve people have taken,

00:15:13.382 --> 00:15:14.990
in that

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.950
if you all put one thousandth labour of that,

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.880
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga may reach to any level.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:32.089
I depend upon you people as my sole support,

00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:35.113
that you would heighten Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:35.113 --> 00:15:38.250
spread it in the whole world.

00:15:40.036 --> 00:15:44.435
I’m sorry I had to speak in Hindi language,

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:53.560
because most of the people who are here
are understanding Hindi only.

00:15:54.212 --> 00:16:00.174
When I am abroad, all the time
I am speaking English,

00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:03.164
nothing else but English language,

00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:08.987
and then I want to have some change
for a while.

00:16:09.012 --> 00:16:17.845
Regarding today’s great advent
of Shri Jesus Christ,

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.949
I told them that He came on this world

00:16:23.739 --> 00:16:29.643
with a very great mission, I would say
one of the greatest missions,

00:16:29.668 --> 00:16:36.624
because He wanted to open the Agnya
Chakra

00:16:36.649 --> 00:16:42.217
which was so constricted, and could not
be done before.

00:16:42.242 --> 00:16:45.887
For that He had to sacrifice His life.

00:16:45.912 --> 00:16:54.324
By that sacrifice only, the great Agnya
could be opened.

00:16:54.965 --> 00:17:02.528
He was aware of it. He knew that it has
to happen,

00:17:02.553 --> 00:17:11.191
that He has to somehow accept this
sacrifice.

00:17:11.216 --> 00:17:15.358
As it is, He was a divine personality,

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:22.116
He had no problem in doing so. But He
thought that

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:33.275
could be some other way there, by which
you can open this Agnya Chakra.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:41.479
But He had to sacrifice His life, and
in that sacrifice He has shown

00:17:41.504 --> 00:17:50.462
that if you have to rise above this
mundane, superficial life,

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:58.582
you have to in a way sacrifice.
Sacrifice what?

00:17:58.607 --> 00:18:05.822
Sacrifice all your six enemies. But
with the Kundalini awakening

00:18:05.847 --> 00:18:10.819
all these six enemies completely get
detached.

00:18:10.844 --> 00:18:19.551
Depends on how your Kundalini has risen.
If she has risen in a perfect manner,

00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:22.802
then I have seen people at the first shot

00:18:22.827 --> 00:18:27.762
they just become completely self-realized
people.

00:18:27.787 --> 00:18:31.140
Of course there are very few, but there
have been;

00:18:31.165 --> 00:18:37.631
while I see most of you have little
problems,

00:18:37.656 --> 00:18:43.755
and for most of you it is the problem
of the Agnya Chakra.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.372
How do we get the Agnya Chakra working
so much is this,

00:18:48.412 --> 00:18:56.398
that we think as a reaction, as a reaction

00:18:57.079 --> 00:19:02.302
to anything outside, we react to
everything.

00:19:02.327 --> 00:19:06.539
While I see here all these lamps, I can
react by saying,

00:19:06.564 --> 00:19:10.863
“From where did they get all these?
How much it must have cost?

00:19:10.888 --> 00:19:17.676
Where are they kept all the year round?”
- All kinds of things. I can react.

00:19:17.701 --> 00:19:27.074
This reaction comes from our conditionings,
or from our ego.

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:33.070
Egoistical people are extremely sensitive.
If you give them, say,

00:19:33.095 --> 00:19:37.916
something that they think is not very
dignified, they can feel hurt.

00:19:37.941 --> 00:19:42.080
They can feel hurt for anything, because
they have a consciousness

00:19:42.105 --> 00:19:50.294
that they are something special, something
higher people, and one should behave

00:19:50.319 --> 00:19:55.283
with them when they are dealing with
anyone.

00:19:55.308 --> 00:19:59.198
And that’s how they get absolutely
disturbed

00:19:59.223 --> 00:20:04.943
if they find anybody in any way degrading
them.

00:20:05.551 --> 00:20:08.278
This comes from ego.

00:20:08.303 --> 00:20:14.345
Ego is a part and parcel of this Agnya
movement,

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.762
and the second one is your conditioning.

00:20:17.787 --> 00:20:25.328
Now you have a conditioning: say you are
an Indian, now the conditioning is

00:20:25.353 --> 00:20:32.264
that a person who comes to meet you
should touch your feet, supposing,

00:20:32.289 --> 00:20:34.132
that’s your relationship.

00:20:34.157 --> 00:20:39.741
And the person doesn’t touch your feet,
then you are angry.

00:20:39.766 --> 00:20:43.957
Anything like that which is your
conditioning,

00:20:43.982 --> 00:20:48.437
gives you an idea that you are been
insulted

00:20:48.462 --> 00:20:55.483
or in any way you have not been
respected, then you feel bad.

00:20:55.523 --> 00:20:58.582
The other reactions of ego are like this,

00:20:58.607 --> 00:21:04.311
as I said: I see those lamps and I can say,
“Why not I have it?”

00:21:04.336 --> 00:21:07.722
Or if I have them, “Why will I give it
to anyone?”

00:21:07.747 --> 00:21:12.882
Ego reactions are there, or conditioning
reactions are there.

00:21:12.907 --> 00:21:16.710
These two were to be finished, and that
was done

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:23.448
by the sacrifice of the life of Christ.
Christ Himself was a divine person,

00:21:23.473 --> 00:21:31.668
and a divine person is like the sea because
it remains at the zero point,

00:21:31.693 --> 00:21:37.054
at the lowest point; it does all work
from that point.

00:21:37.094 --> 00:21:45.535
It will make clouds, it will make rain,
and when all the rivers are in spate

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:52.475
they’ll run into the sea, because the sea
remains at the lower point.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:22:00.075
So humility is the, one of the criteria
of a Sahaja yoga.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.606
A person who doesn’t have humility
cannot be called sahaja yogi.

00:22:05.631 --> 00:22:09.388
I have seen even sahaja yogis get very
angry,

00:22:09.413 --> 00:22:13.715
sometimes start shouting and getting angry
and misbehaving.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.909
That’s the sign that he is not yet a sahaja
yogi, he has to still mature.

00:22:18.934 --> 00:22:29.611
So this humility of a person will give you
more stationary, I would say,

00:22:29.636 --> 00:22:39.221
more permanent state by which you will
not react,

00:22:39.246 --> 00:22:44.022
you will not react. You look at anything,
you react.

00:22:44.047 --> 00:22:46.655
But then you don’t react, you just watch,

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:51.921
and that is how the new state of witness
state comes into you.

00:22:51.946 --> 00:22:56.586
When you become the witness you are
just watching,

00:22:56.611 --> 00:23:05.679
just watching; not reacting, not thinking
about it, but you are in the present,

00:23:05.704 --> 00:23:12.195
and in the present you just watch, watch
and really enjoy it.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:20.659
The enjoyment of all the creation is not
within your mind when you are thinking.

00:23:20.684 --> 00:23:28.702
And when you are not thinking, the whole
enjoyment of the beauty of all this creation

00:23:28.727 --> 00:23:34.472
reflects in you, and gives you tremendous
joy and peace.

00:23:34.497 --> 00:23:40.123
So one has to learn that we should not
react.

00:23:40.148 --> 00:23:45.710
The today’s problem is, all human beings
are very good at reacting.

00:23:45.735 --> 00:23:50.103
Reaction is a basic principle of today’s
life.

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:56.112
You see any newspaper, you see any book,
you meet anyone,

00:23:56.137 --> 00:24:01.232
what I find that they are experts
on reacting. They react,

00:24:01.257 --> 00:24:11.456
and by reaction what happens, they never
achieve any essence of the thing.

00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:17.947
Essence is only through witness state
that you can achieve.

00:24:17.972 --> 00:24:25.201
This is what we have to learn from
the crucifixion of Christ,

00:24:25.226 --> 00:24:33.030
from His birth, that He was born in a very
humble family,

00:24:33.275 --> 00:24:43.350
very poor family, in very adverse
conditions.

00:24:43.375 --> 00:24:50.141
The reason was to show that all these
outward things

00:24:50.166 --> 00:24:56.370
and all these outward glories do not
make you great.

00:24:56.395 --> 00:25:01.703
The greatness is within, and when
that greatness is there

00:25:01.728 --> 00:25:08.643
then you don’t care for anything, because
you are so much enriched within yourself

00:25:08.668 --> 00:25:15.406
that you don’t bother about other things,
you don’t think about these things,

00:25:15.431 --> 00:25:20.528
and you live in your own majestic life.

00:25:20.553 --> 00:25:26.609
This is what we see in His life, He was
a very majestic person.

00:25:26.634 --> 00:25:31.963
Otherwise if you meet somebody
who is a poor man, say,

00:25:31.988 --> 00:25:40.026
and who has felt the poverty, he’ll talk
to you with a beggarish style.

00:25:40.051 --> 00:25:45.613
If there’s somebody who is born in a rich
family, he will talk to you

00:25:45.638 --> 00:25:54.213
in a very, I should say, outward, outwardly
showing-off nature.

00:25:54.238 --> 00:26:01.262
But a person who is a divine person,
all these things don’t touch.

00:26:01.287 --> 00:26:08.034
For him riches or not riches, positions
or no power

00:26:08.059 --> 00:26:12.540
is all just the same; and when that
happens,

00:26:12.565 --> 00:26:18.207
then you should consider that you have
become sahaja yogis.

00:26:18.382 --> 00:26:24.215
I’ve seen people who come to Ganapatipule
- now they are very much changed.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.275
Otherwise in the beginning they used
to say, “We don’t have water,

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:36.782
we don’t have this facility, it’s very cold
or hot” - whatever it is.

00:26:36.807 --> 00:26:42.236
They were all the time talking as if they
are on a holiday.

00:26:42.261 --> 00:26:45.930
It is something very different.

00:26:45.955 --> 00:26:51.400
You are here to develop your witness state.

00:26:51.425 --> 00:26:55.573
Did you see the sky, how beautiful it was,

00:26:55.598 --> 00:27:00.724
how orange, blue, all kinds of colors
were there.

00:27:00.749 --> 00:27:09.681
The color it takes automatically,
and is enjoying it. It is not bothered

00:27:09.706 --> 00:27:15.307
that it should remain forever, that this
will go away when there is darkness.

00:27:15.332 --> 00:27:20.425
Just watching, the sky is just watching.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:29.079
Whatever comes its way, it takes it. So
it’s so beautiful and it’s so joy-giving.

00:27:29.104 --> 00:27:40.717
So the another thing is that when you
are in that state of spirituality,

00:27:40.742 --> 00:27:46.440
then you are joy-giving, you are
peace-giving,

00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:51.788
you are compassionate, and you love
each other.

00:27:51.813 --> 00:27:57.407
All these problems of the ego just
disappear.

00:27:57.432 --> 00:28:01.832
Ego is your greatest enemy, I think,

00:28:01.857 --> 00:28:11.661
and it is the one that really hinders
all the wealth and beauty of your life.

00:28:11.686 --> 00:28:20.747
So if you could just see this ego, how it
works, just you’ll be enjoying it.

00:28:20.772 --> 00:28:24.985
It’s a drama it plays - all right,
let’s have it!

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:29.538
You can see the drama and then suddenly
you will be amazed

00:28:29.563 --> 00:28:33.403
that you are not in it, you are
watching it.

00:28:33.428 --> 00:28:42.246
When you are detached from your ego,
you can see how it tries to entice you.

00:28:42.678 --> 00:28:48.722
These are the problems of today, and
that’s why we need Jesus very much.

00:28:48.747 --> 00:28:54.383
The problem of today is that people
don’t understand

00:28:54.408 --> 00:29:00.155
that how much harm they are doing
to themselves, to others,

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:05.610
and to the whole world by becoming
egoistical.

00:29:05.635 --> 00:29:10.591
If they could understand, I tell you,
they would give up.

00:29:10.616 --> 00:29:18.354
But the problem is they enjoy their hatred
they enjoy that kind of meanness

00:29:18.379 --> 00:29:24.541
or I would say, very low-level living.
While you are all sahaja yogis,

00:29:24.566 --> 00:29:31.216
and what you have to do is to understand,
“Why this ego is coming in my head?

00:29:31.241 --> 00:29:33.837
What have I done? Who am I?”

00:29:33.862 --> 00:29:39.746
Once you go on asking such questions
this ego will disappear.

00:29:39.771 --> 00:29:45.726
And it’s a big problem for Me also to deal
with people who have ego,

00:29:45.751 --> 00:29:50.705
because I can’t tell them “You have got
ego.” If I tell them, they’ll all run away.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:55.263
If I tell them, “All right, you are very
good, you are very nice,”

00:29:55.288 --> 00:30:01.536
then ego will be bloated. Then they’ll say,
“Oh, Mother told us I’m very nice.”

00:30:01.561 --> 00:30:07.933
It’s very problematic. I don’t know how
to deal with the ego of human beings.

00:30:07.958 --> 00:30:12.176
I know they have, but I don’t know how
to deal with it.

00:30:12.201 --> 00:30:17.997
I think it’s only you can deal with it, if
you will understand what’s wrong with you.

00:30:18.022 --> 00:30:24.304
That’s a very good way of solving your
problem, and My problem also.

00:30:24.329 --> 00:30:27.782
My vision is too great, I think,
for one life.

00:30:27.807 --> 00:30:32.454
I want a global realization, I want people
all over the world

00:30:32.479 --> 00:30:38.560
to have realization. It’s very
remarkable how ....

00:30:53.720 --> 00:31:09.457
In Sahaj culture we have a proper training
for getting rid of ego.

00:31:09.482 --> 00:31:17.602
You can yourself introspect yourself.

00:31:18.079 --> 00:31:25.498
You can yourself see why you behave
like this.

00:31:25.523 --> 00:31:32.085
The introspection that sahaja yogis can
do cannot be done by other people,

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:37.170
because they can enter into themselves,
they can see for themselves,

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:44.761
they can watch others. And with that
they can just try to see

00:31:44.786 --> 00:31:50.543
what is this Mr Ego doing within
your head.

00:31:50.757 --> 00:31:56.181
Of course, we know that the mantra
of Christ is the best

00:31:56.206 --> 00:32:02.951
for removing all egoistical problems,
and that helps a lot.

00:32:02.976 --> 00:32:07.911
But also when you are doing this mantra,
you should be yourself

00:32:07.936 --> 00:32:14.923
in a very humble state. “What am I,
after all, who am I?

00:32:14.948 --> 00:32:21.880
Look at so many stars, look at so many
beautiful things, and who am I?

00:32:21.905 --> 00:32:26.599
What have I done? Why should I be
so egoistical?

00:32:26.624 --> 00:32:29.689
Why should I think I’m something great?”

00:32:29.714 --> 00:32:35.618
And also other people pamper you, because
they want to take advantage of you.

00:32:35.643 --> 00:32:39.984
So they’ll pamper you, they’ll say “This is
very great, you are very great”;

00:32:40.009 --> 00:32:44.478
and you just get enamored, get lost.

00:32:44.503 --> 00:32:52.122
You are like thrown into the torrential
rain

00:32:52.147 --> 00:33:00.328
and you flood out into big, I think, like
a big stream of egoistical people.

00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:05.346
And if you see around today in these
modern times,

00:33:05.371 --> 00:33:12.008
everybody is quite conscious of their ego,
very conscious,

00:33:12.033 --> 00:33:16.454
and the way they are coming up
in the newspapers

00:33:16.479 --> 00:33:21.853
or the way they are in some magazines,
I’m quite amazed.

00:33:21.878 --> 00:33:26.908
I would feel shy to be there, because
it’s so much

00:33:26.933 --> 00:33:35.355
of expression of your ego, nothing else.
All kinds of things they start,

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.955
they have competitions of ego,
lots of competitions.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:45.267
Like they have a beauty competition, then
they have another competition

00:33:45.292 --> 00:33:52.048
for Mister, you can say India, Mister this
thing, that.

00:33:52.073 --> 00:33:57.703
All these things actually give the person
ego,

00:33:57.728 --> 00:34:02.117
and others also run after such
competitions.

00:34:02.142 --> 00:34:05.488
They think, “Why am I not? I should be
like that.”

00:34:05.513 --> 00:34:10.449
So it’s very deadening and absolutely
blinds your mind,

00:34:10.474 --> 00:34:16.166
that you think this is the way one has
to be very successful.

00:34:16.191 --> 00:34:21.877
This success lasts for how long?
It perishes in no time.

00:34:21.902 --> 00:34:27.379
But success in Sahaja Yoga is what will
last forever,

00:34:27.404 --> 00:34:31.832
and everybody will remember it.

00:34:31.857 --> 00:34:38.422
The one who has this kind of a humble
nature

00:34:38.447 --> 00:34:42.735
will be remembered for generations.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:51.358
I’ve never seen a statue of a person
who has been egoistical.

00:34:51.383 --> 00:34:55.198
On the contrary, if there was some
they used to criticize,

00:34:55.223 --> 00:35:00.540
“He was a very egoistical man.”
And nowadays it’s impossible,

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:03.930
anybody who has ego, I don’t think
anybody

00:35:03.955 --> 00:35:07.727
is going to sing any songs about
such a person

00:35:07.752 --> 00:35:11.650
or going to raise any statues in their
name.

00:35:11.675 --> 00:35:17.587
So in the heart of hearts we like humble
people,

00:35:17.612 --> 00:35:23.970
and if we want others to like us, we should
be also very humble.

00:35:23.995 --> 00:35:28.233
Not artificially, but really,
by understanding

00:35:28.258 --> 00:35:30.940
that: “What are we? Why should we
proud,

00:35:30.965 --> 00:35:37.077
why should we try to overpower others
and trouble others?”.

00:35:37.102 --> 00:35:41.461
If you understand that, you have done
full justification

00:35:41.486 --> 00:35:45.933
to the incarnation of Jesus Christ
the great.

00:35:45.958 --> 00:35:51.429
And there are so many qualities He has
shown. But the, for us the best is

00:35:51.454 --> 00:35:59.958
His passing through the ego sacrificing
His life is the greatest message,

00:35:59.983 --> 00:36:02.949
and for that we have to understand.

00:36:02.974 --> 00:36:07.981
But those who call themselves are
the most egoistical. I was surprised

00:36:08.006 --> 00:36:12.417
that England, English people are
extremely egoistical.

00:36:12.442 --> 00:36:17.801
Or otherwise other countries also I’ve seen
in the West, they are very egoistical.

00:36:17.826 --> 00:36:21.391
They’ve no humility at all, compared
to Indians,

00:36:21.416 --> 00:36:27.065
they are very, very egoistical people.
Why? Because they are following Christ,

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:31.401
can you imagine! Is this the way
we follow Christ?

00:36:31.426 --> 00:36:36.299
Those who call themselves Christians
and those who call themselves

00:36:36.324 --> 00:36:40.486
very great admirers of Christ should
show in their life

00:36:40.511 --> 00:36:46.744
that humility, that compassion, that love.
It is not so.

00:36:46.769 --> 00:36:51.092
So specially for people who are from
Western countries,

00:36:51.117 --> 00:36:54.140
you must try to learn Sahaj culture.

00:36:54.165 --> 00:36:58.810
In the Sahaj culture, how do we talk,
how do we live,

00:36:58.835 --> 00:37:05.569
how do we contact, is something very
different. And then once you start

00:37:05.594 --> 00:37:12.010
Sahaj culture in your life, you’ll be
amazed, others will be amazed

00:37:12.035 --> 00:37:16.457
how you are having a rapport
with each other,

00:37:16.482 --> 00:37:21.686
how you are looking after everything
so well.

00:37:21.711 --> 00:37:26.105
This is the best way to live in this world
as sahaja yogis,

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:30.665
where there is no ego, there is
no conditioning, nothing.

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:38.958
You are just absolutely free from all
these horrible attributes.

00:37:38.983 --> 00:37:46.210
And then you will be amazed how people
will trust you, how they will like you.

00:37:46.653 --> 00:37:51.605
I wish you all a very Happy Christmas.

00:37:59.183 --> 00:38:03.820
And also remember the message of Christ
and His life.

00:38:03.845 --> 00:38:05.859
May God bless you.
