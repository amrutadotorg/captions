00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:10.790
The reason for celebrating this auspicious day

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.880
is because it is said that Jesus Christ was born this day.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.150
Very little is known about Jesus Christ

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.680
because in young age went out of his house.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.950
and after returning

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.850
He did some great work,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.430
and lived only for 33 years of age.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.600
after that,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:10.300
his twelve disciples spread Christianity.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.150
But, as you all have to face problems sometimes,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.840
they also faced several problems

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.470
But these twelve disciples did tremendous work.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.810
Their followers in the beginning,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.359
were known as Gnostics, meaning ‘Those who have known’

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.370
The origin of this word is from ‘Gna’ meaning To Know’

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.083
And, these people also were tortured

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:54.870
by the priests of that time.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.490
So in the beginning it was very difficult

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.750
to convince people of Christ's thoughts.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.370
But at that time,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.750
People were not seif realised.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.520
Jesus Christ had said it again and again ‘Know Thyself, Know Thyself'

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.840
Even after He said this,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.840
Without realising the significance of self realisation,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.001
people started spreading the religion.

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:38.890
Without knowing the Self, religion could not be spread

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.100
because gradually such religion becomes Adharmas

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.140
And the same thing happened with Christian religion.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.550
It is written that Jesus Christ

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.490
went to a wedding function.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.180
There he put his finger in the water and converted it  into wine,

00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:17.195
It is said in Hebrew language,

00:03:17.838 --> 00:03:22.561
in which it has been written in the beginning,

00:03:22.762 --> 00:03:27.324
that the taste of water

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:36.548
got transformed into

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:45.048
something like the taste of grape juice.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.460
And grape juice is called wine in Hebrew.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.320
Christian people twisted the meaning of the wine to alcohol,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.200
and said we should drink alcohol to celebrate.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.060
and thus among Christians alcohol became famous.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.813
Alcohol is the cause of all Adharma.

00:04:08.813 --> 00:04:13.290
Alcohol gives human beings distracted attention.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.620
How could Jesus say any such thing?

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.100
It is a very easy thing,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.840
I may also do it by putting my hand in it.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.310
and change the taste of water.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.510
But, people took so much to alcohol, that I am astonished!

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.420
I went to England.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.750
There they drank alcohol Whether some one is born or someone dies,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.957
for everything alcohol.

00:04:42.957 --> 00:04:45.919
And, alcohol became so famous

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.220
that they would not talk of anything else.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.320
you go to someone’s house they will offer you a drink,

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.990
Without drinking they do not know how to talk to you

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.810
so, thus alcohol became prevalent

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.630
But, if someone says that Jesus Christ advocated this,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.580
it will be the most injustice thing.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.220
None of the incarnations,

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.210
could ever teach you to go against  the religion.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.320
In India also tne use of alcohol has become prevalent.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.650
When we were young during the time of British rule,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.960
Indians were not used to drinking as for as I know,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.430
May be except some highly placed people, no one else used to drink.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.591
Now even common men could be seen drinking.

00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:47.790
No one thinks of the miserable state alcohol drags the person in,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.900
and commit sins.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.100
So, first thing I want to tell you,

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.340
that the drinking by the Christians is not a religious activity,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.130
so much so, alcohol is made in the Church of Rome.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.060
To commit sins (Adharma) in the name of religion (Dharma)

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.740
is unpardonable sin, in my opinion.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.350
That is how people accept all the evils,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.730
The aim of Jesus Christ was

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.920
to open the centre ol Agnya chakra which is within you.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:37.750
and to achieve that purpose He got Himself crucified,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.700
And after that He resurrected.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.000
It appears to be a miracle

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.110
but for the Divinity there is no miracle as such.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.850
He proved that human beings could rise above the centre of Agnya,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:08.920
and on this centre he told two mantras which we call Beeja Mantras,

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.020
– Ham and Ksham’

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.190
Ksham’ means to forgive.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.580
Ksham is the biggest mantra

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.530
The person who knows how to forgive,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:30.934
his ego gets destroyed completely.

00:07:30.934 --> 00:07:35.791
For every small thing a person has ego.

00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:39.970
For example if you tell someone to sit on the ground,

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.989
his ego gets hurt,

00:07:41.989 --> 00:07:43.970
If some one is told to sit on the chair,

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.940
then he will say why have you given me a small chair.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.860
Everyone has some imaginations about self,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.160
and if his expectations are not fulfilled,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.529
his ego immediately comes up.

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:05.640
Unknowingly some times such things could happaen.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.130
And unknowingly also if such things take place,

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:15.480
the egoistical people take it as their insult.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.440
And like this

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:26.224
Such people make their condition very miserable

00:08:26.224 --> 00:08:33.488
All the time they think they are being insulted and humiliated

00:08:33.488 --> 00:08:36.500
He is always obsessed with this thought

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:43.100
and he draws negative meaning of whatever is told to him.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:50.800
So, we have to think and see, of what Jesus Christ had said,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:59.640
’Forgive those who have hurt you or troubled you’

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.354
Now see, if you forgive everyone,

00:09:04.354 --> 00:09:05.970
then what will happen?

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:11.470
You will neither suffer nor get disturbed mentaly.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.440
You will not think of the person whom you have forgiven.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:23.647
Nothing could happen against you

00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:27.650
because you have forgiven everyone.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.442
We get this power from the centre of Agnya.

00:09:33.442 --> 00:09:38.903
The person whose Agnya is clear, forgives everyone.

00:09:38.903 --> 00:09:41.603
what other choice do we have?

00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:48.110
If we do not forgive we torture ourselves and trouble ourselves,

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:54.870
and the other person, who probably has hurt us  knowingly,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.350
will assume power over us.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.990
So ‘Forgiveness’ is the greatest

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.000
message that Jesus Christ has given to mankind.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.660
Second is ‘Ham’,

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:16.870
It has altogether opposite meaning of "ksham".

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.990
Ham means To Know thyself.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.000
You have to know that you are the Spirit.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:32.434
You are not this body, mind, brain or ego, but You are the Spirit!

00:10:32.434 --> 00:10:38.010
When you know this ‘Ham’ then you will know that you are the Atma.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:43.640
The ‘Spirit’ means that all the wrong things,

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:51.000
like, the ego, foolishness, ignorance that we have in our mind,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.780
are useless and meaningless.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.674
When you are the Pure Spirit,

00:11:03.674 --> 00:11:07.690
these negativities have absolutely no place in this spirit.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.930
And You are very pure.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:19.502
So, He told two things, the first is to Forgive everyone,

00:11:19.502 --> 00:11:24.090
Knowingly or unknowingly if someone troubles you, you forgive him.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.960
This way you will not get tortured.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.538
whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do, nothing.

00:11:30.538 --> 00:11:36.870
But if you donot forgive then you torture yourself.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.270
Because the person who troubled you is sitting nicely.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:49.740
So, if any such thing happens, you must develop the habit to forgive.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.430
Second thing that he told is that ‘You are the Spirit".

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.910
Know this Spirit,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.900
No one can touch the spirit or destroy it, or torture it,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.600
If you are that spirit then you should be established in it

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.090
But, to achieve this Atma tattva,

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:18.180
the awakaning of Kundalini is necessary

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.600
And after the awakening of Kundalini,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.100
you need to get established in it.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.380
You need to be in it,

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:33.950
Untiil you are established you will remain entangled in stupidies.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.740
So, one should know how to be established with in.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.270
to remain with in thyself.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:45.690
When you start to establish within self,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:52.200
you will feel a kind of extreme peacefulness within

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.600
and nothing will disturb you

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.000
When you get established in this aura of peace,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.220
then you will be surprised,

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:16.150
that small small things which used to worry you always,

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.270
will come to an end.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.360
You will be always drenched in the joy of Spirit.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:29.780
To attain the Spirit, as I told you,

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.650
the awakening of kundaltni is very essential,

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.690
Without that it is impossible.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.618
But, even after that,

00:13:36.618 --> 00:13:39.420
after the awakening

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.960
people keep getting lost

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.540
They do not go in depth.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.140
So, if the central point is your Agnya,

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.190
If you aim at it and see

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.910
then you will come to know that it is confusing you.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:11.970
Because of it you are entangled, caught in different thoughts.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.107
and having different problems

00:14:16.107 --> 00:14:19.910
But, when you cross this centre of Agnya

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.407
and go beyond it

00:14:22.407 --> 00:14:29.640
then all these problems of yours will be over.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.380
That is why this agnya chakra is very significant.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.908
So much so, it is written in the Bible that

00:14:37.908 --> 00:14:43.370
those who apply vermillion on their forehead will be saved.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.233
It is written.

00:14:45.233 --> 00:14:50.030
They could be none else but Sahaia Yogis

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.430
Its a stupendous task.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:09.150
Jesus Christ had only twelve disciples, but you are thousands

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.382
But, the kind of effort each of the twelve people have taken,

00:15:13.382 --> 00:15:14.990
in that

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.950
if you all put one thousandth labour of that,

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.880
the spreading of Sahaja Yoga may reach to any level.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:32.089
I depend upon you people as my sole support,

00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:35.113
that you would heighten Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:35.113 --> 00:15:38.250
spread it in the whole world.
