00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:21.910
In Sahaja Yoga the Guru puja has a very different
significance from any other guru puja.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:37.870
When you worship your Guru you are also worshiping
the Guru within you.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:58.929
This is not in any other guru-disciple system
because, in you, the Guru, the Master has

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.600
been awakened.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:12.750
And so, when you are worshipping your Guru,
then this Master within you is also worshipped,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.780
you respect it, you glorify it, you awaken
it, and you manifest it.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:32.260
This we have to realise that – in Sahaja
Yoga – if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:46.410
Now, the quality of Guru, first and foremost,
is that he makes you meet God: means he raises

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:56.230
the Kundalini and establish the relation between
the All-pervading Power.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:05.960
And as your Guru is Adi Shakti, you make that
person meet, also, the Adi Shakti.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.850
So you have a double advantage that, at the
same time, when you give them Realisation,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:24.450
not only that you make them feel the union
with the Divine Power, but you can make them

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.060
meet the Divinity Itself, the source of Divine
Power.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:37.621
So your responsibility, as Sahaja Yogis, is
very great because in you is there is the

00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:38.621
Guru.

00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:47.319
Now in our mantras we say that, “Mother,
I am my own Guru."

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:54.760
But, saying that, do we realise that: if I
am my own Guru, this “I” and “my Guru,”

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.920
between the two, what have I achieved?

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.900
Where am I?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.900
Can I guide myself?

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:15.030
Have I got the light of the Spirit on my attention
so well established and manifested that I

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.810
can guide myself and guide others later on?

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:29.180
First of all, in the Guru principle it is
important that you see to yourself – the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.190
introspection: Can I be my own Guru?

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.870
Have I become my own Guru?

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:54.060
Now, in your case, your Guru is a Mother,
a woman, so, it has to be among women that

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.390
the development of their Guru qualities have
to be very well manifested.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.550
But it’s just the way it is not.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:15.220
For them, they are still the mothers or they
are the wives or they are Sahaja Yoginis.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.329
But they don’t realise that you are also
the Gurus.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:33.810
And, because your Mother is a Guru, because
She is a woman; and you have to be also of

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.810
that quality, that people should say, “Look
at this woman, she’s such a Guru."

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.490
But still, as I hear from the different leaders
that the ladies are absolutely still very

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.470
much far away and are very few who can be
called as real Sahaja Yoginis.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.550
It’s a sad thing to hear.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:02.280
Because if you still keep to all these mundane
things of womanhood and the drawbacks of womanhood,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.090
which has come out of domination maybe, because
of always they were shown to be something

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.090
lower.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.150
Specially in the Christian religion they were
never regarded as something holy.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:24.200
They have this kind of a diffidence in them
that they don’t understand that dharma can

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.750
be established more by women than by men.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:43.390
And the Guru’s work is to establish the
dharma – in the society, in the family,

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.390
in relationships.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.390
All these Gurus, which are representing all
these great symbols here, have done nothing

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.570
but have established dharma.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.710
But, first of all, before establishing the
dharma, we should watch ourselves – have

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:00.000
we got dharma within ourselves or not?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:14.190
First of all, the quality of a person who
has dharma is that he listens to others, he

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.830
obeys.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.521
And this is something [that] has gone wrong
with the Western women, I think, that they

00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:24.550
have forgotten how to listen to others, how
to obey others.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:32.430
That’s why their children also don’t obey
them.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.460
Obedience, if you do not have, nobody’s
going to obey you.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.450
First, you must learn to obey.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:49.889
A person like Kabira, because he was born
of a unknown cast, people didn’t know what

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:59.120
he was born from, and he could not go directly
to any Guru.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:09.550
So, he heard about Ramanand, a great Guru
of those days, who used to go to the river

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.160
Ganges every morning to have his bath.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:22.300
So one day on his steps Kabira kept lying,
and in the darkness the Guru could not see,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.860
and he touched him with his feet.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.310
He said, “Who are you?”

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.450
So he said, “I’m Kabir, and I’m your
disciple."

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.020
And he caught hold of his feet.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.990
And when he caught hold of his feet, he [Ramanand]
said, “Alright, come along!”

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:46.550
And then he became such a great saint in India.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.780
People know him more than they know his Guru;
he became so great.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.270
The basic thing is humility.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.720
Yesterday you saw how the musician (Nishat
Khan) was humble.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.979
All the time he was humble.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:03.430
He didn’t know how to express his humility
every time.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.860
All the time he was humble.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:15.490
Because in humility only you can receive the
blessings, you can receive the quality that

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.539
is of your Guru.

00:08:19.539 --> 00:08:29.150
Now, for a Guru as you have seen that, in
My own way, in My own image, you have to come

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.460
up.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.349
First of all your life should be absolutely
transparent.

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:37.800
Transparency is the essence of Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.890
Everybody should know what you are doing,
where you are going, what is the way you live,

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:47.830
what is the way you are behaving.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:54.230
I have seen people, who are gurus, also in
the sense that we call them leaders, or we

00:08:54.230 --> 00:09:00.200
can call them sub-gurus, or they can not be
called as priest, but I can say ‘communication

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.760
centres’ as they are.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:09.000
In them you find that they are very fussy
type of people.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.750
Always think about their body, always think
about their comfort, always grudge about – nobody

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:21.350
looked after them – as if they suffer from
persecution-mania!

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.640
Or they will grudge about food, “I didn’t
eat my food for one day!”

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.100
Doesn’t matter!

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:33.610
For a Guru it’s better to starve for about
three, four days nicely, so that you get over

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.820
this idea of hunger.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:41.700
You’ll be surprised since I’m here I have
not eaten anything much, and just drinking

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.380
something, because just the Guru has no hunger.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:52.600
Because it is in your stomach the Guru, vibrations,
are so much that you don’t feel like eating

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.730
anything.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.140
So then, what do you eat and how do you eat
and all these things that we have given up

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.980
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.910
So even if leaders have this nonsense in their
head [like] what do you get to eat!

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:09.290
I mean, this is the basics, absolutely!

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:15.930
And when I hear some people telling Me, oh,
what did they eat and how did they eat and

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:16.930
all!

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.950
It’s like I feel they are like tourists
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:25.790
Just come in Sahaja Yoga like tourists, you
see, to see places and go round and to know

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.459
where you get, in what restaurant, you get
good food and cheaply.

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:42.860
All this is so basically, absolutely not a
manifestation of Guru Principle.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:48.050
Now you have seen your Guru as She is.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:54.290
I do not know what I eat, what they give Me,
what I want.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.390
They go on giving Me whatever they think I
like, and I just don’t know if I like that

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.330
thing or not, or what is it.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.000
If they ask Me, “Mother, what will You have?”

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.090
I said, “What will I have, I don’t know
really, what will I have?

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:08.120
Anything!”

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.490
So there has to be no choices.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.590
First of all not to waste your attention on
choices.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.740
Of course, only on vibrations.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:22.060
I mean, supposing, you go to a restaurant,
find all kinds of funny vibrations there,

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.300
people are getting drunk or anything, then
of course you should say.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:32.440
But all the choices must be based on vibrations
and not on material things.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.410
That you get something nice there, “Let’s
go there,” and they’ll travel for fifty

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.060
miles to go eat something nonsensical.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:44.660
It should be all nonsense for all Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.709
And when I said “Sahaja Yogi” it means
also Sahaja Yoginis.

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:52.180
So the food part of it is aswadha.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.850
You should not have any taste for any special
food.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:03.370
Specially in France to say that people may
not like, but French are very, very conscientious

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.800
or aware about the food part.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:14.680
I don’t know how far they make really good
food, but at least they think they eat very

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.680
good food.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:21.160
So, the eating of good food is a kind of a
addiction.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:28.029
It’s a kind of an addiction; it’s something
like drug – that you must have good food.

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:33.610
So Zen started this system of what they call
the tea ceremony.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:40.769
In the tea ceremony what they did, I mean,
I have been through that and it’s really

00:12:40.769 --> 00:12:42.220
quite a test of people.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:47.570
With Me it was alright, but the rest of them
got really frightened.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:55.610
That in the tea ceremony whatever rituals
they do they give you a tea, which is so bitter,

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.250
and we can say [like] quinine raised to power
108!

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.220
It’s like that.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:06.589
And they give you very nicely, handle you
with such ritual that you have to take it.

00:13:06.589 --> 00:13:12.279
So first they say, “You see the cup without
thinking."

00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:15.960
So he tried to make thoughtless awareness
through the cup.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.890
I don’t know how much one can achieve with
that.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:26.190
But that tea if you take once, your tongue
is good for anything.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:36.459
And to compensate it they give you something
sweet, which is again sweetness raised to

00:13:36.459 --> 00:13:41.500
power 108, so sweet that it becomes bitter!

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.800
So sweet.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.970
So this is just to conquer the tongue [that]
Zen must have thought that better give them

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:59.860
this tea ceremony where there is no tea, there’s
nothing but just you really give such shocks

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:05.190
to your tongue, so that after that you can
eat whatever you get.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:10.839
And that’s why you must know that Japanese
can eat anything.

00:14:10.839 --> 00:14:15.480
They have solved their food problem because
they can eat anything!

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:26.600
They can just fish out some crabs or could
be some prawns, just peel them out like peanuts

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.089
and eat them like that.

00:14:29.089 --> 00:14:33.930
I think Zen has solved this problem for them,
because they have food shortage and this is

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.220
how they can eat everything: they can eat
the bark of the tree, they can eat the snake,

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:43.510
they can eat the lizards, they can eat the
frogs, everything they can eat, so all their

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:51.940
eating problems are solved in that country
by Zen, I think, because you have no taste.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:58.930
But in this I think the worst are, in the
whole world are Indians.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.440
They are the fussiest people for food.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.959
Because their women have spoiled them.

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:08.920
They know very good cooking and they know
how to handle their husbands by cooking very

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.920
well.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.440
And the way they cook food for them, you see,
the men have to go back to Indian food.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.120
Even if they travel the whole world, they’ll
need Indian food, they can’t get over their

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.120
tongues.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.959
It is such a big conditioning in India of
food that I just don’t know how will they

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:30.880
get out, the, absolutely, the basics which
are important.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.860
Gandhiji tried that very much in the ashram
(laughing).

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:42.380
He used to give horrid food, boiled food with
the oil of mustard on top and then nobody

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.310
could eat that.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.310
Raw!

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.320
And he used to make everybody eat that.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:54.089
Not only that, he would make them clean the
bathrooms, WC’s, everything so that you

00:15:54.089 --> 00:15:57.510
get rid of your nose also, that you need everything.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:01.779
Because so many people you will, while eating
also in India will put something to their

00:16:01.779 --> 00:16:03.329
noses, and they smell everything.

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:06.760
So they are oversensitive to their tongue
and to their nose.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.010
But not to their eyes, to eyes they are not.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:17.019
For eyes I would say the most sensitive people
are Japanese and Chinese and also the Western

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:21.410
people are very much sensitive because they
don’t like to see anything dirty, filthy

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.410
or ugly.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:31.959
Indians won’t mind any dirt, filth, anything,
just like dogs and what you call, horses or

00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:32.959
buffalos!

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:36.399
They can walk through any dirt, filth – anything!

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:42.170
Nothing matters to them, anything ugly, any
ugly building or an ugly dress or anything

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.170
is alright for them.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.910
It doesn’t matter, to their eyes it doesn’t
matter at all.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.870
Only thing [is that] kitchen should be clean
and they are all the time in the kitchen.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.760
So we don’t have to learn all these bad
things from Indians.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.649
There are some good things they have, but
there are certain things [which] are very

00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:58.649
bad conditionings.

00:16:58.649 --> 00:17:01.550
And the next to that are, I think, the French.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:12.589
But if you eat English food you can become
quite good because there’s no taste in English

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:18.709
food (laughter and applause).

00:17:18.709 --> 00:17:26.600
So, I have no problem anywhere because I think
I have no taste at all and I can eat anything

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:33.179
any way it is cooked, it’s alright, I don’t
bother about what is cooked, what is not cooked.

00:17:33.179 --> 00:17:38.540
But if you have some French people for a dinner
in a restaurant they will spend forty-five

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:43.239
minutes deciding what they are going to eat,
and what a waste of energy!

00:17:43.239 --> 00:17:45.690
Forty-five minutes just to decide what they
are going to eat!

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.960
After all what is so great, what you are going
to eat?

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.960
It’s all there.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.370
Just one thing that everybody should have.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:55.869
So for Sahaja Yogis it’s important to give
up this idea, “I will have this."

00:17:55.869 --> 00:18:01.580
First of all nobody should ask, “What will
you have?”

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.940
To Me also.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.019
I do not like people asking Me questions [like],
“What will You have?”

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:19.470
Because I’ve to think about it and I want
to be in Nirvichara (laughter and applause).

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:37.250
So, this is a, one, big ordeal, which we do
not understand: how much we are attached to

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.809
food.

00:18:38.809 --> 00:18:40.609
And food goes in the stomach.

00:18:40.609 --> 00:18:47.299
And not only that it spoils our guru system,
but also spoils our physical system.

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:50.470
So we should try not to look at food.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:57.179
That’s why fasting was told to the all the
people who wanted to develop their Gurupada,

00:18:57.179 --> 00:19:00.809
so that they should not fast.

00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:07.870
But they do not fast normally because they
think of food, so there’s no fasting.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.909
I mean, fasting means that you go into nirvichara
and don’t think of food.

00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:17.729
But they are all the time thinking of food,
so it has no meaning and you are just the

00:19:17.729 --> 00:19:21.109
same whether you eat it or not, your mind
is eating it all the time.

00:19:21.109 --> 00:19:30.149
Then you start thinking, “When will I end
my fast and know where will I go to have what?”

00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:35.679
So this is a very basic thing that we should
get rid of our habits, of our conditionings

00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:39.609
– what we are going to have and what food
we are going to have.

00:19:39.609 --> 00:19:46.399
Our children also should be given a proper
training about it that – it’s alright,

00:19:46.399 --> 00:19:50.419
sometimes there is no salt, sometimes there’s
no sugar, doesn’t matter.

00:19:50.419 --> 00:19:52.979
And sometimes there’s nothing, doesn’t
matter.

00:19:52.979 --> 00:19:57.029
Nothing [is] important for a Sahaja Yogi,
you can live without food for days together,

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.720
no problem.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:08.559
So for a Sahaja Yogi there’s nothing like
taste of food and hunger.

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:14.539
There’s only one hunger is to be purified,
to be clean.

00:20:14.539 --> 00:20:23.059
This is one of the things that dirties our
mind, we should say, that we think about food

00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:27.519
all the time.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:31.860
Even in Russia I found people carried all
Indian things there, they were cooking all

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.090
Indian things, and I am, poor thing, I can’t
eat anything.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:39.419
So they cooked, brought everything for Me,
thinking I’m an Indian, but they don’t

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:43.940
know I am Zen – I cannot, I do not, have
sense of taste.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.809
So once, to get over taste one has to work
out.

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:51.370
It’s an experiment you have to do with ourselves.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:56.429
Unless and until we introspect ourselves and
do experiments we cannot rise.

00:20:56.429 --> 00:21:01.620
Because though the Kundalini is trying her
level best, but your conditionings are so

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:08.379
great that it cannot pierce through and cannot
make you onto that Guru level.

00:21:08.379 --> 00:21:14.340
If you see the lives of all these Gurus: they
were married, they had children, they lived

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:21.889
a normal life but in their own personal life
they were absolutely detached people.

00:21:21.889 --> 00:21:27.849
So, first detachment should come from food.

00:21:27.849 --> 00:21:30.989
And there whatever you like you just don’t
eat.

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:33.359
That’s the best way.

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:36.990
Because already because of liking something…supposing
if somebody’s fond of ice-cream.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:42.119
He must have already spoiled his liver; so
then, give [it] up now.

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:45.590
If you like pasta, give up pasta.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:50.950
If you like something else, just give up,
don’t ask for it and don’t eat it at all;

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:55.609
so that, you see, your mind will get little
bit detached from it.

00:21:55.609 --> 00:22:04.749
It’s very easy to achieve this detachment,
I think, if you work it out in a sensible

00:22:04.749 --> 00:22:05.749
way.

00:22:05.749 --> 00:22:07.309
Just try to punish your body.

00:22:07.309 --> 00:22:12.249
You see, if you are your Guru, you better
take hold of first of all your body and your

00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:13.249
conditionings.

00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:15.999
You have to treat your body with this thing.

00:22:15.999 --> 00:22:21.029
I am told many girls who have married abroad
are still making their Indian food and eating

00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:22.029
that.

00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:23.029
It’s horrible it is!

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:24.080
They should starve.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:29.519
If they starve for say about five, six days
or maybe eight days, then they’ll eat any

00:22:29.519 --> 00:22:31.120
food in any case.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.529
That’s why the fasting is given.

00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:38.739
So one should adjust oneself to any kind of
food you can have.

00:22:38.739 --> 00:22:44.740
And if you want to survive then you eat anything,
so just make it a point that you get rid of

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:52.909
this very simple conditioning you have – of
liking the food that you want to eat and you

00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:54.019
don’t want to have anything else.

00:22:54.019 --> 00:22:59.289
I think as Sahaja Yogini or Sahaja Yogi who
cannot get rid of this little thing, then

00:22:59.289 --> 00:23:01.309
how can you call him a Sahaja Yogi?

00:23:01.309 --> 00:23:02.309
I don’t know.

00:23:02.309 --> 00:23:03.309
He’s very asahaj.

00:23:03.309 --> 00:23:05.419
Because the other day I met one lady.

00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:07.879
I said, “What is the matter, where have
you been?”

00:23:07.879 --> 00:23:11.049
She said, “I have been looking out for some
sort of an Indian ingredient."

00:23:11.049 --> 00:23:14.019
I said, “How can you get it here in this
Spain?

00:23:14.019 --> 00:23:15.019
You cannot."

00:23:15.019 --> 00:23:16.019
“Why?”

00:23:16.019 --> 00:23:17.919
“Because they asked me to make Indian food."

00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:18.919
“Alright.

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:20.529
Then without that can’t you make Indian
food?

00:23:20.529 --> 00:23:24.059
What is the need to run all the way, whole
day for a one small little thing called hing

00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:25.059
(asafoetida)?”

00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:28.049
There’s a big name for that, it’s a small
little thing.

00:23:28.049 --> 00:23:32.590
Just to get that she had to run all over the
places to get it!

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:40.349
So for people who are Sahaja Yogis if they
are sahaj, whatever is available you can make

00:23:40.349 --> 00:23:44.250
something nice out of it and eat it.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.159
So that shows what?

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:52.659
It shows sagacity, shows trupti (तृप्ति
– contentment), shows your satisfaction.

00:23:52.659 --> 00:23:56.469
And that is one of the manifestations of a
Guru that he’s a satisfied soul.

00:23:56.469 --> 00:23:59.320
He’s just self-contained, he doesn’t bother.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:07.970
Now, for example, some people, specially in
the West, thank God, they are not spoiled

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.409
by their wives so much.

00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:12.210
They don’t have so much of conditioning,
they can eat anything.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:17.600
I’ve seen that when they come on the India
tour, all the Indians say, “Horrid food

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.960
was given and the poor things were eating
that horrid food and this and that."

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.279
And I asked them, “Which place you like
the best?”

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:27.279
They said, “Brahmapuri."

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:28.279
I said, “Eh?

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:31.129
They were saying Brahmapuri had the worst
food and everybody is complaining."

00:24:31.129 --> 00:24:32.129
“No, no.

00:24:32.129 --> 00:24:37.149
Brahmapuri was the best, because we could
bathe in the river and we could sing and we

00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:38.149
could enjoy it!”

00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:45.200
You see, that’s the sign of one thing, to
get rid of your bad habits of food business.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:51.489
Now the second part is for the body you need
comforts.

00:24:51.489 --> 00:25:00.330
I must congratulate the Western Sahaja Yogis
that they may be coming from any walk of life

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:06.259
– I must say, the Indians have to learn
from them – they may be coming from any

00:25:06.259 --> 00:25:07.649
position or status.

00:25:07.649 --> 00:25:15.279
All of them enjoy the comfort of the Spirit
when they travel in the Tour.

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:20.979
They do not ask for, “I haven’t got a
chair, I haven’t got a bed, I haven’t

00:25:20.979 --> 00:25:23.129
got a proper things here."

00:25:23.129 --> 00:25:31.460
In this way, you see, you will realise that
the body comfort is of no importance.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.979
It’s, we have just spoilt our body, there’s
no need, no need.

00:25:34.979 --> 00:25:37.820
Body you put it anywhere, will sleep in any
case.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:42.649
If you cannot sleep for two nights, alright,
put on some music for one night or two nights

00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:43.649
as we had here, you will sleep anyway! (laughter
and applause as everybody fell asleep during

00:25:43.649 --> 00:25:57.929
the Nishat Khan performance the night before)

00:25:57.929 --> 00:26:06.340
So this is the second point is that we have
to give up body comfort.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:15.830
But the third point where I think the Western
people falter is their materialistic attitude.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:22.139
Materialistic attitude and their fondness
of their eyes.

00:26:22.139 --> 00:26:24.379
So one of them is the worst of all.

00:26:24.379 --> 00:26:30.570
I mean, the worst in worst of all is that
you can never have, that’s such a big blot

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:36.309
if you have that is to have a roving eye and
things like that.

00:26:36.309 --> 00:26:37.309
It’s out of question.

00:26:37.309 --> 00:26:39.379
That’s out of question for women or for
men.

00:26:39.379 --> 00:26:42.669
They are not Sahaja Yogis by any chance.

00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:47.989
They have to have very clean eyes.

00:26:47.989 --> 00:26:50.149
That part is alright.

00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:53.919
And the second part is the greed, lust and
greed.

00:26:53.919 --> 00:27:02.840
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga maybe the lust
part is over, but greed is still there with

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.980
so many who get lost.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:11.749
So I would say Indians do not have this lust
problem, but they still have greed, greed

00:27:11.749 --> 00:27:19.820
problem – means they want to buy something
like a radio or some electrical stuff they

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.820
must buy.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.440
If they come abroad they must buy something.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.489
It’s alright, if you get it, well and good,
if they don’t get it, well and good.

00:27:26.489 --> 00:27:27.519
It should be [that attitude].

00:27:27.519 --> 00:27:33.450
But for a Westerner, you see, he would not
like to give up his furniture, which his great

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.639
grandmother had it.

00:27:34.639 --> 00:27:37.820
Though he can’t sit on it because it’s
so old.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.369
If he sits on it, it will be break.

00:27:39.369 --> 00:27:44.609
But he must keep it to show off that, “I
had a great grandmother who gave this unique

00:27:44.609 --> 00:27:45.609
chair."

00:27:45.609 --> 00:27:48.469
According to Indian standards it’s junk!

00:27:48.469 --> 00:27:50.190
Absolute junk.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:54.200
Because it is good for nothing you put it
in the drawing room, nobody can sit on it

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.159
and it looks junky.

00:27:56.159 --> 00:28:00.450
But according to the Western mind the older
it is, the better – whether it is a junk

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.799
or anything – he’ll have so many junks
in the house and they will sell like hot cakes.

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:10.009
Because there’s a very subtle materialistic
attitude towards matter that, “This will

00:28:10.009 --> 00:28:14.749
sell like hot cakes if I sell it,” because
there must be another mad Westerner who would

00:28:14.749 --> 00:28:16.220
like to buy that junk.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.320
You see?

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:23.529
So this junk that you have in the house it’s
better to get rid of, because God knows how

00:28:23.529 --> 00:28:24.970
many people must have used [it].

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.559
It’s like a grave in the house.

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:28.029
It’s a grave.

00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:30.669
So to have then also the antique jewellery.

00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:41.289
Antique jewellery is another mad, antique
is a – what you can say – is the fad or

00:28:41.289 --> 00:28:43.159
addiction of the Western people – antique.

00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:47.960
For us nothing is antique because we still
produce antique things, beautiful things so

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.169
Indians don’t understand the value of antiques.

00:28:50.169 --> 00:28:55.809
They don’t understand how these people are
so mad after torn things and broken things

00:28:55.809 --> 00:28:58.539
and dirty things and filthy things!

00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:01.889
But the Western mind has been brought up that
way.

00:29:01.889 --> 00:29:06.549
Now, in these antique things I have seen that,
once I went to somebody’s house, you see,

00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:09.639
and he asked Me with very great honour to
sit on his chair.

00:29:09.639 --> 00:29:14.740
And as soon as I sat on the chair I thought
there were snakes and there were scorpions

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.359
all biting Me.

00:29:16.359 --> 00:29:18.149
I got a fright, I got up.

00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:19.450
I said, “What is it?”

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:24.580
He said, “This is from great, great, great
grandmother, you see, she gave us this thing."

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.460
I said, “It will break, I better sit outside."

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.460
(laughter)

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:36.129
So this also madness of this antique is so
much that it is unbelievable how people go

00:29:36.129 --> 00:29:37.129
into it.

00:29:37.129 --> 00:29:43.279
So there’s a joke in India there’s a very
great writer called as Premchand, he wrote

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:51.950
about two Englishmen going on the road of
Benares when they were hit by a lota (metal

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:57.589
pot), that they use for their bathrooms, fell
on their feet.

00:29:57.589 --> 00:29:59.830
And it fell on their feet.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:05.450
And jokingly he says, “on the feet where
all the bureaucrats fall."

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:08.970
Means, all Indian bureaucrats used to fall
at the feet of the English at that time!

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.399
So he made a joke.

00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:11.399
But doesn’t matter.

00:30:11.399 --> 00:30:15.159
Then the English, you see, looked at that
thing and they were very angry and immediately

00:30:15.159 --> 00:30:19.200
they took to law, “You have to come to the
courts, you have to come to the police and

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.629
we’re going to report this has fallen there,
it has hit us,” and all that.

00:30:23.629 --> 00:30:30.739
So there was a clever man, he knew the English
or the Western mind, he said, “Sir, do you

00:30:30.739 --> 00:30:33.409
know this, this lota has very valuable!”

00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:34.539
He said, “Why?”

00:30:34.539 --> 00:30:39.089
“Because this one was used by Akbar the
Great.

00:30:39.089 --> 00:30:40.259
So ancient it is.

00:30:40.259 --> 00:30:41.289
” He said, “Really?”

00:30:41.289 --> 00:30:45.190
“Yes it is and, you know, you just don’t
quarrel with them.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.089
And ask them for this lota."

00:30:47.089 --> 00:30:50.999
And he told in Indian language to them that,
“I have befooled these people, I have told

00:30:50.999 --> 00:31:01.489
them that this lota belonged to Akbar and
you have to take this lota and use this lota

00:31:01.489 --> 00:31:04.769
to just to befool them."

00:31:04.769 --> 00:31:08.820
So then they asked, “But alright, we’ll
forgive you, we’ll not take you to any courts

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.059
or anything, but you just give us this lota."

00:31:12.059 --> 00:31:13.539
They said, “No, we can’t."

00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:14.539
He said, “Why?”

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:16.629
“Because it’s such an antique piece, you
see."

00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:21.159
In India you won’t find anybody respecting
antique pieces, especially in Benares nobody

00:31:21.159 --> 00:31:22.159
bothers.

00:31:22.159 --> 00:31:27.959
(Laughter) So they said, “Really?”, “Yes,
it belonged to Akbar and, you know, my father

00:31:27.959 --> 00:31:30.299
was, my forefathers worked with him, so he
gave us this lota, we can’t give you, we

00:31:30.299 --> 00:31:31.299
are sorry, you see."

00:31:31.299 --> 00:31:36.999
“No, no, no, no, please give us, you see,
and we’ll no take you to the police."

00:31:36.999 --> 00:31:39.779
“Alright, you charge us, whatever money
you charge us,” and all that.

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:43.669
In those days they paid one thousand rupees,
you see, this is equal to, now, one crore

00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:45.019
(10 million), I think.

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:51.119
They gave, these English paid them and bought
that lota, which had nothing to do with Akbar

00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:52.809
or anyone.

00:31:52.809 --> 00:31:56.769
So this madness of antique has to go away
from our minds.

00:31:56.769 --> 00:32:02.919
It’s such a built-in thing within us, that
we always talk of antiquities.

00:32:02.919 --> 00:32:07.929
Perhaps maybe because of wars everything was
destroyed and whatever was in the olden times

00:32:07.929 --> 00:32:12.169
was something very beautiful and good and
now we are not making very good things, perhaps,

00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:13.200
maybe that is the reason.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.820
But now we are making nice things, we can
make.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:21.850
Now in England I was surprised the old crafts
are coming up, everywhere I go the old crafts

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:22.979
are coming up.

00:32:22.979 --> 00:32:30.049
So to respect antiques means you just stop
making the old craft revive.

00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:36.320
Because you pay so much to the antiques, the
same thing made today won’t fetch the same

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.229
price as it was.

00:32:38.229 --> 00:32:44.889
Now this has ruined our creativity, ruined
our handwork and it has ruined our whole – I

00:32:44.889 --> 00:32:50.679
think the quality of our life, because the
way we are mad after antiques.

00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:56.739
So this also should go from your head that
anything antique is something good.

00:32:56.739 --> 00:33:01.109
It’s a very superficial value – if you
see to it.

00:33:01.109 --> 00:33:04.919
Because people think that antique is something
expensive.

00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:09.720
It’s just a marketing style that people
have felt that this is expensive, that is

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:14.169
expensive, so it’s something great to wear
something stupid and to say that, “this

00:33:14.169 --> 00:33:17.509
is antique jewellery,” and go about.

00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:23.299
I mean, God knows how many people must have
used it and must have worn it and what must

00:33:23.299 --> 00:33:25.659
be the feelings of that person.

00:33:25.659 --> 00:33:32.639
So we have to understand that this conditioning
that we have in our heads, that we must have

00:33:32.639 --> 00:33:40.339
something antiques with us, keep something
of such value.

00:33:40.339 --> 00:33:44.519
I mean, these questions never arose before,
so it’s not written in any books.

00:33:44.519 --> 00:33:49.359
Anyone of the books of the Gurus is not written
that, “Don’t care for antiques."

00:33:49.359 --> 00:33:53.690
They have written, “Don’t drink, don’t
smoke,” all other things which spoils your

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:54.690
Nabhi.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:56.149
They’ve written all these things.

00:33:56.149 --> 00:34:01.070
But they have not written that, “Don’t
worry about antiques so much."

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:08.020
You see, and I find that’s a craze nowadays
and so we have to tell people that we have

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.020
to be careful.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.819
Moreover I feel the way people have gone to
drugs and that, maybe that because they used

00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:17.929
so much antiques that the bhoots from the
antiques must have caught them.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:21.859
Can’t understand that why people are so
melancholy, all the time crying, weeping,

00:34:21.859 --> 00:34:23.089
and all that.

00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:30.580
So the conditionings of these matter as we
think it to be is to be absolutely taken out.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:35.240
Of course, I mean in certain countries we
should say that the antique things [that]

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.669
were made were good and nice.

00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:40.889
But, only because something is antique it
should not be respected, [but] because of

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:47.369
its intrinsic value of aesthetics, it’s
alright.

00:34:47.369 --> 00:34:51.560
But one has to see first of all the vibrations
of everything.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:57.279
If the vibrations are good then you should
accept, otherwise not, because we have the

00:34:57.279 --> 00:35:05.269
language of vibrations and we have to use
the language of vibrations.

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:11.470
Once you start using the language of vibrations
you’ll be surprised how you will get the

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:19.869
complete picture as to what is to be done.

00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:27.270
So to get rid of these three conditionings
too, for our body is very important.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:35.450
And the worst thing for a Sahaja Yogi [is]
to think that he’s sick: is a, sort of a,

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.329
tarnishing the name of Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:43.420
If you still feel you are sick you better
get out of Sahaja Yoga!

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:50.980
Because either you get well or you are not
a Sahaja Yogi, one of the two things.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:56.150
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to see that
you get well and if there are certain problems

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.240
also – doesn’t matter.

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:02.040
Now, for example, supposing, I have certain
problems, which I know, because of Sahaja

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:11.410
Yoga, because of My position as the Mother,
position as Adi Shakti: certain physical things

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:16.140
I have to face, parasympathetic working I
have to face, but I go through it!

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.140
Is accepted.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:21.779
You have to accept your body as it is and
you are not to sort of say that, “I’m

00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:26.610
not well,” and “There’s something wrong
with me,” and go on complaining like some

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.820
old hag!

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.529
Never think you are old, first of all.

00:36:31.529 --> 00:36:35.990
Never think that you have gone old or you
are no good.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:37.200
Look at your Mother.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.480
I never think that way.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:44.630
Yesterday half of you were sleeping, still
I was alert and listening to the music and

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.250
today I’m again alert here.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:51.820
So if you have a Guru then that image should
be with you that: “Look at our Mother.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.400
She’s so old, how much She travels, how
much She does!”

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.500
Alright, you might say, She’s the Adi Shakti!

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.160
But little bit of shakti you too have.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:06.670
And that shakti is to be shown by your full
dynamism.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:12.309
If you have no dynamism and if you still feel
very weak that means you are not a Sahaja

00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:13.309
Yogi.

00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:18.619
So just ask for, ask for any amount of energy
– it can come to you.

00:37:18.619 --> 00:37:20.130
That dynamism, it should be there.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:25.779
Now this I would say, for the physical self
that one has to know that you are all younger

00:37:25.779 --> 00:37:31.769
and getting younger and younger, but not the
stupidity of youth, but gravity, the gravity

00:37:31.769 --> 00:37:33.770
of the age.

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:40.450
Actually I have seen children who are born
realised, they are very grave, they won’t

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:43.430
do anything that is not dignified.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:50.390
And they will never, I’ve never heard them
talking to some of – the Sahaja Yoginis

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:53.480
have a bad habit of talking, “tuk, tuk,
tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,” among themselves.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.630
It’s a very bad habit.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:59.089
Which shows that they [are] still very much
lacking.

00:37:59.089 --> 00:38:02.900
Just wearing saris or wearing bindis you do
not become a Sahaja Yogini.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.440
First of all, what is the gravity?

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.520
You should only speak whenever it is necessary.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:13.230
So I have seen these Sahaja Yogis who are
born realised children they stand like this

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.230
before Me.

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:19.290
And they say very few words, but beautiful
words they speak.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.859
And say things, which you can remember all
the time.

00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:26.470
They just do not go on wasting anything.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.589
And they are extremely obedient.

00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:34.390
So from them one can learn that these are
born realised and the way their Guru principle

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.990
is acting, are we also acting the same way?

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:41.650
Or we are doing something that is not good
for our ascent?

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:46.950
So even after coming to Sahaja Yoga if you
do not try hard to introspect yourself, you

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:51.400
have missed the point that you compare yourself
with your Guru – all the time.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.400
Now.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:59.270
Then everything has to be understood in the
right perspective that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:03.150
Now for a Sahaja Yogi first and foremost thing
[is] that he has to have love.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:04.150
First.

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:08.220
For others, not for himself.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:12.089
If you are all the time worried about yourself,
“My body is such, my this thing such, and

00:39:12.089 --> 00:39:15.500
I have to do this and that,” then you don’t
love others.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.170
But do you see to the comfort of others?

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:21.680
Do you feel the compassion of other Sahaja
Yogis?

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.099
Do you feel, “What have I to bring for them?

00:39:24.099 --> 00:39:25.099
What is missing in them?”

00:39:25.099 --> 00:39:26.430
Do you work it out?

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:30.180
Do you go out of the way to help them?

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.740
First of all Sahaja Yogi s.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.340
Now Sahaja Yogis are different things.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:42.230
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis will go and
take the side of the non-Sahaja Yogis and

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.030
try to debase the Sahaja Yogis.

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.210
Is a very wrong thing.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:52.180
You belong to this new race and the people
who do not belong to this new race and if

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:57.260
they are attacking anybody: these are your
hands, your feet, your head, and if they attack

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:03.069
it, it is duty bound that you help them instead
of helping the others.

00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:05.309
Maybe something wrong with this person, doesn’t
matter.

00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:07.910
You need not show all the fair play there.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:11.980
In that place you should support a Sahaja
Yogi out and out.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.660
Later on you may correct and you may tell
that person, “You should not have done like

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.619
this, it was wrong."

00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:23.530
So this dignity and this understanding comes
only through silence.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:29.079
But if you are chirping all the time, talking
“tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,”

00:40:29.079 --> 00:40:32.009
it can never, never can make you a deeper
person.

00:40:32.009 --> 00:40:35.579
You’ll be just flying in the air with all
that.

00:40:35.579 --> 00:40:41.289
So for women now is best is to take to mauna,
is to keep quiet, just keep quiet.

00:40:41.289 --> 00:40:43.160
They all the time want to talk.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.940
This I’ve heard from all the leaders that
is a big problem with women.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.750
They just go on talking stories, telling stories.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:58.500
But if you ask them to come and speak, they
will start shaking.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.500
How many can give speeches?

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.190
Women?

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:12.109
If you understand that if you cannot give
a speech, you better not talk also.

00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:15.990
You should be able to give a speech because
your Mother is a woman, She gives speeches.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:17.809
Why can’t you give some speech?

00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:18.809
You cannot.

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:21.569
If I make you stand here, you’ll be shaking,
I know that.

00:41:21.569 --> 00:41:25.089
But if it comes to murmuring souls, you are
there.

00:41:25.089 --> 00:41:28.180
So that is one thing women have to be very
careful [about].

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:34.200
And as today is the Guru puja I have to tell
you things, not as a Mother but as your Guru.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:39.150
That, if you have to ascend the best thing
is for you to stop talking.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.170
“Maunam sarvatha sadhanam."

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.400
‘Maun’ means to keep quiet.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:49.619
It gives you all kinds of facilities, just
keep quiet.

00:41:49.619 --> 00:41:51.859
If somebody’s talking too much, just keep
quiet.

00:41:51.859 --> 00:41:54.880
If somebody’s trying to criticise, keep
quiet.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:42:01.519
That’s your silence, that’s your right,
that’s your domain that you can keep silent.

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:03.450
Just watch that person.

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:08.200
If it comes then to answer, then you can answer
better.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.710
But if somebody’s trying to attack ,you
just keep silent.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:18.710
But this silence has to be established and
one should only establish by not talking too

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:19.710
much.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:24.349
I have seen also when I am sitting here, I
have seen women talking among themselves,

00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:25.969
and this is very wrong.

00:42:25.969 --> 00:42:27.560
You must learn the silence.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.970
Like yesterday I saw so many ladies also were
walking out, walking in.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:33.400
In the church will you do that?

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.250
You won’t do it.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:39.830
In the church there is no Christ, there’s
a horrible priest sitting there, but you cannot

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:40.830
do it.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:43.549
You all keep quiet, you sit there nicely.

00:42:43.549 --> 00:42:48.609
I’ve never seen anybody walking out here
and there and doing all kinds of things, putting

00:42:48.609 --> 00:42:50.559
the children in front like that, making them
sleep.

00:42:50.559 --> 00:42:51.559
Never!

00:42:51.559 --> 00:42:57.000
Can you do that in the church?

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.240
What a discipline people observe in that church,
which is an artificial place.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:07.869
And where you are now, that kind of a silence
has to be there and that kind of understanding,

00:43:07.869 --> 00:43:10.319
that depth, that awe has to be there.

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:12.869
But because we have not yet developed that
Guru thing.

00:43:12.869 --> 00:43:16.109
If we had developed it then immediately it
will work out.

00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:20.730
You will see your gravity will show in your
behaviour.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:34.630
So this is for our attention not to be wasted.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.369
To discuss somebody, to discuss about others’
characters, we have no business.

00:43:37.369 --> 00:43:40.200
Do we discuss the character of one hand to
another hand?

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.099
To discuss about what has happened about marriages,
things like that.

00:43:45.099 --> 00:43:50.460
Also marriage is just…in Sahaja Yoga it’s
not such an important thing.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:53.829
Some people pay too much attention to marriage,
you see, and marriage becomes a headache.

00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:55.680
Also then, “What about my marriage?”

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.529
Then again ten minutes you see that person,
“What about my marriage?”

00:43:59.529 --> 00:44:01.540
Again after ten minutes, “What about my
marriage?”

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.030
You want to run away.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:07.940
I mean, you see, it’s something becomes
like a mania for people, “What should we

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:08.940
do?”

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:13.049
And the whole thing is, all depends, and the
whole programming depends on how you are going

00:44:13.049 --> 00:44:14.500
to get married.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:21.730
So you have come to Sahaja Yoga, you are sanyasis.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.589
You are not married people in a way.

00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:29.559
You are married only to Sahaja Yoga, that’s
your husband, that’s your wife.

00:44:29.559 --> 00:44:33.359
And the so-called husband and wife are there.

00:44:33.359 --> 00:44:38.099
But if they are not Sahaja Yogis then you
are unmarried, definitely.

00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:41.299
So too much attention is paid in Sahaja Yoga
to marriages.

00:44:41.299 --> 00:44:48.420
I have seen that before, marriage, before
Sahaja Yoga, marriage was a joke; every third

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:56.259
day there was a divorce and people would run
away and do all kinds of things.

00:44:56.259 --> 00:45:02.490
Then when they got married after Sahaja Yoga
they are the greatest romantic people ever

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:03.869
known in the whole world!

00:45:03.869 --> 00:45:05.910
I mean, all ‘Romeo, Juliets’ going about.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:07.280
I just don’t understand.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.900
Even in the Indian villages people complain
that, “What sort of these people are?

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:15.920
I mean, they have no sense at all and the
way they go round, are they the saints?”

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:25.680
So that saintliness, that sanyasta, that asceticism
has to be expressed in our married life.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:31.440
I don’t mean that you don’t have relationship
with your husband but in a very private way.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:37.609
It’s has to be extremely private and it
should not be such a great thing to go into

00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:38.609
romanticism.

00:45:38.609 --> 00:45:43.400
You’ll ruin the whole of Sahaja Yoga in
the West if you start doing that nonsense!

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:49.180
Because also there’s an idea about it that,
you see, you fall in love.

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.180
But then you’ll fall!

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.460
That’s the first point is.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.160
You will fall [but] you want to rise.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:59.690
So this attachment and this worry about the
husband and this and that, I mean, you can

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:03.440
carry on with any kind of a husband and wife
if you are a Sahaja Yogi, should be able to.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.820
I mean, I know that’s very simple.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.910
It’s a…your husband is a study, wife is
a study, that’s all.

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:12.500
You study a person, what sort of a person
he is.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:16.849
But for that you have to have the witness
state and you have to see, you have to be

00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:17.849
detached.

00:46:17.849 --> 00:46:19.180
So in marriages one has to be detached.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:26.319
But, on the contrary, I find that just after
the marriage they want to organise some special

00:46:26.319 --> 00:46:32.849
thing for them to go to some sort of a honeymoon
or some sort of a thing!

00:46:32.849 --> 00:46:35.633
I don’t know how these ideas crawl up.

00:46:35.633 --> 00:46:40.160
These are coming from the old conditionings
of things and after honeymoon they come and

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.259
say, “Mother, this marriage is not going
to work out."

00:46:42.259 --> 00:46:46.519
So it’s better to do slow and steady and
then decide.

00:46:46.519 --> 00:46:51.099
Because you just jump into honeymoon mood
and come back and say, “Mother, this, I

00:46:51.099 --> 00:46:54.530
have started thinking and I don’t think."

00:46:54.530 --> 00:47:01.060
I know of a lady who was jumping with a Indian
gentleman and she was on her way to Australia.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:05.559
In Singapore, she telephones that, “Mother,
I don’t think this marriage will work out."

00:47:05.559 --> 00:47:10.119
And here everybody complained to Me, “Mother,
these two are behaving in such a manner that

00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:11.359
Indians are rather embarrassed."

00:47:11.359 --> 00:47:16.730
So the sense of shame you must learn from
Indians.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:22.630
They never… husband and wife never sit together
in India, is regarded as bad manners and it

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:23.970
should be with you also.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:30.349
That, even in the puja, even in anything they
are sitting in the public, what is the need

00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:33.279
to show your relationship in the public?

00:47:33.279 --> 00:47:35.040
It’s only in the private.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:41.119
This is one of the things one, if you start
understanding, there will be a proper adjustment.

00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:47.579
Men should be with men in the public, women
should be with the women together.

00:47:47.579 --> 00:47:56.859
But the women or men, whatever they are, whatever
are their bad, bad points should not be brought

00:47:56.859 --> 00:47:57.859
back.

00:47:57.859 --> 00:48:06.230
Like, I would say the men have jealousies
and they have power orientation and they discuss

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:12.069
about leadership and they, every, they get
a shock if you tell them that you are not

00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:16.280
going to be a leader, as if they think leadership
is something very concrete.

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.970
It’s the greatest myth ever going, is this
leadership!

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:24.580
There’s nothing like leaders in this Sahaja
Yoga, it’s just a joke.

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:29.230
And your Mother is very good at playing serious
jokes.

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:31.200
So be careful!

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.019
Don’t be childish about it.

00:48:34.019 --> 00:48:39.900
You have to understand that this is a big
joke going on and it’s just a testing point

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:45.480
and if I test you wrong, you can tell Me,
but I think this has worked well, because

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.990
I can test people very well on that level
and immediately I know when the person gets

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.609
onto the horse of ego.

00:48:51.609 --> 00:49:00.400
So, for your mental attitude, has to be different
and our priorities have to change.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.619
Our priorities have to change.

00:49:02.619 --> 00:49:04.210
What are our priorities?

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:07.589
First and foremost thing is our ascent, is
the first priority.

00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:12.009
For our ascent whatever is needed has to be
done.

00:49:12.009 --> 00:49:14.369
If you have to punish your body, alright.

00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:16.849
If you have to punish yourself, alright.

00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:20.960
If you have a conditioning, get rid of it.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:27.420
Just introspect yourself, that is Self-realisation,
is to know yourself.

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:33.240
When you know yourself and know what is clinging
onto it, just to remove it completely.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.839
Work it out the way you like.

00:49:34.839 --> 00:49:36.940
Work it out the way you like.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:52.390
You see, it is very important that the body,
mind, everything should be your slaves.

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:55.069
Nothing should dominate you.

00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:57.249
You should be on top of everything.

00:49:57.249 --> 00:50:00.210
How dare your body ask for anything?

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:02.940
How dare your mind tells you anything?

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.280
How this conditioning works on you?

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.099
“I am a Sahaja Yogi, I’m above everything."

00:50:08.099 --> 00:50:13.759
Like the lotuses have come out of the ponds,
you have come out of it.

00:50:13.759 --> 00:50:18.910
We have so many proofs to show that you are
realised souls.

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:24.059
I’ll show you some photographs that I have
to show that there is light.

00:50:24.059 --> 00:50:27.410
I can put light into you, they are all enlightened
people.

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:31.700
But in My presence if you become the light,
you must carry the light outside.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.460
Not only in My presence, but when you go out.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:39.769
But one of the reasons, I think, when I tell
something people just start thinking about

00:50:39.769 --> 00:50:42.289
whom Mother is talking, they never think,
“She is talking about me."

00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:48.660
That’s the only way you can penetrate within
yourself when you see that, “Mother is talking

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:52.760
about me, She’s correcting me all alone
and She’s telling me."

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.710
Then only it will penetrate and it will work
out.

00:50:56.710 --> 00:51:02.990
The priorities have to be changed and the
first and foremost is your ascent and the

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:04.480
Spirit and Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:11.700
The rest is negligible, nothing important.

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:21.789
Then the faith that there is this All-pervading
Power, which is looking after us, is very

00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:22.789
important.

00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:25.630
This time the musicians came all the way.

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:27.430
I must tell you the story of their travel.

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:32.960
They came and they said that there’s a train
from Kiev and they also bought the tickets

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:38.599
so got into the train and they were off-loaded
before the Hungarian border.

00:51:38.599 --> 00:51:44.579
They didn’t know what to do, they had no
visas, nothing and not so much money also.

00:51:44.579 --> 00:51:45.579
They thought, “We are on the train."

00:51:45.579 --> 00:51:50.660
They said, “No, you have to go cross over
and go to Budapest,” and they didn’t know

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.150
where, they were standing on the road.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:58.299
And, but they were all laughing and enjoying,
“must be something in store for us."

00:51:58.299 --> 00:52:01.480
Nobody felt that they were in trouble or in
anything.

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.480
So surrendered.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.470
“So, suddenly,” they said, “the custom
people came and surrounded them,” and they

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:10.500
said, “What’s the matter, how are you
here with all these bags and baggages?”

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.079
So they said, “Why are you here?”

00:52:12.079 --> 00:52:17.049
They said, “We have come for a concert and
this, and musicians we are and all."

00:52:17.049 --> 00:52:18.799
And some or other they started melting away.

00:52:18.799 --> 00:52:20.130
And then they gave them Realisation!

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:22.089
Six of them got Realisation.

00:52:22.089 --> 00:52:25.289
Now can you believe: the power of love.

00:52:25.289 --> 00:52:30.960
And the custom officers they offered their
own cars, took them down to the other side.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.269
It’s never happened with custom officers!

00:52:33.269 --> 00:52:34.269
Imagine!

00:52:34.269 --> 00:52:39.440
It would be like shaving their teeth off,
I tell you, the way (laughing) if you can

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.890
do that to the custom officer!

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:44.269
But it happened.

00:52:44.269 --> 00:52:47.119
And they came to the other side and left them
there.

00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:48.290
Now they didn’t know what to do.

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:53.140
They wanted to go to Budapest, they had to
walk about two miles or something to the station.

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:59.980
So they were waiting there well, they said
that, “Mother, You sent maybe, two Yugoslavs

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:04.400
came in a big bus of 49 people – all vacant."

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.569
They stopped the bus and said, “What is
it, why are you here?”

00:53:07.569 --> 00:53:10.309
So they said, “This is our problem and we
have to go."

00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:11.430
So they got into the bus.

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:16.380
When he was driving them down, they thought
of talking to him that, “Why not you take

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.810
us to Milan?”

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:25.000
And they managed! (laughter) And they were
in Milan.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.260
It’s so remarkable.

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:32.630
So to have faith completely in yourself and
in that Power, which is surrounding you.

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:41.590
And once you have that faith you will realise
that, though it is so helpful to you, it is

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:49.549
so kind to you, on the same level if you think
it, it can be very harmful.

00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:58.390
So then never listen to the Guru ninda, means
anybody talks anything ill about your Guru,

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:02.549
just put your hands to your ears, absolutely
immediately.

00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:08.690
I have known of a person who did that [and]
got cancer, another now in jail, another one

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:09.690
there.

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.359
So anybody is saying like that, just put your
hands.

00:54:12.359 --> 00:54:16.480
Because now you know that – what is your
Guru.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:20.520
So you should never hear anything against
your Guru from anyone.

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:25.069
The other day one gentleman asked Me a question,
a newsman.

00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:28.450
He said that, “I am told you have made a
castle for Yourself."

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:31.200
I said, “I have paid for it, I have made
it also.

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.749
It was a horrid place, no doubt.

00:54:32.749 --> 00:54:36.059
But there are only Sahaja Yogis staying there,
I am not staying there.

00:54:36.059 --> 00:54:37.059
That’s the best part."

00:54:37.059 --> 00:54:38.089
But that’s all I said.

00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:43.089
But on the contrary, they never go and ask
these questions to any gurus on anything.

00:54:43.089 --> 00:54:45.240
Because the disciples say, “Yes, so what?

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.290
We want to give to our guru money and this
and that."

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:49.290
They never ask.

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:54.510
But, through Sahaja Yoga, or [by] Myself,
I have cured so many people of incurable diseases

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.200
– I could have minted money.

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:02.339
For curing one cancer patient I could have
made a castle, Myself.

00:55:02.339 --> 00:55:06.349
So when people say like that you should say,
“Do you know how many people She has cured?

00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:13.549
How much money She could have taken from them
if She was a doctor or She was a false Guru?

00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:16.380
How much money She would have made out of
all of them?”

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.650
Then they will understand.

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:21.609
You see, because they are being materialistic
they talk like that.

00:55:21.609 --> 00:55:26.960
And their attitude is very different and so,
to tell them off is the best way.

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:33.670
Because I have seen that these press people
are absolutely harassed by the disciples of

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:34.739
the false Gurus.

00:55:34.739 --> 00:55:40.220
Just they cannot criticise, they cannot say
a word against such false Gurus.

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:48.880
While I find that Sahaja Yogis still lack
that complete faith in themselves and complete

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:49.880
assertion.

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:52.780
Where you have to assert you must assert.

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:59.140
For example, anybody says something wrong
against Me, you have to assert; must say,

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:00.740
“No, not possible.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:01.740
It’s not!”

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:06.279
But I have seen some people asking Me funny
questions who are ‘Sahaja Yogis’ also!

00:56:06.279 --> 00:56:10.503
So the first part is that to see how much
we are sensitive to spirituality.

00:56:10.503 --> 00:56:18.619
I have seen Sahaja Yogis supporting somebody
who is so negative, you can’t even bear

00:56:18.619 --> 00:56:24.410
that person and, [to them], such a person
is something great, while somebody who is

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:25.410
so good they cannot make it out.

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:26.650
So what’s the use?

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:32.069
Your computer is so faulty, you’ll do…I
mean, the planes will have to run up and down

00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:35.150
if you have such a computer as Sahaja Yogis
are!

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:37.920
Because they just judge the other way round.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.910
A person who is good in Sahaja Yoga, who has
got vibrations, he may be simple, he may be

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:47.980
unassuming, he may not be so rich, he may
not be so educated, may not be from some good

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:53.130
universities or anything, but you must see
the vibrations of that person!

00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:56.410
What sort of vibrations that person has, and
then you should judge.

00:56:56.410 --> 00:57:03.299
Instead of that if you judge that person only
because he’s very good to talk and he talks

00:57:03.299 --> 00:57:06.519
well and very scholarly or something like
that, that’s not the point.

00:57:06.519 --> 00:57:07.519
The point is what are his vibrations!

00:57:07.519 --> 00:57:14.259
And once you see those vibrations and judge
them on vibrations, then you are a Sahaja

00:57:14.259 --> 00:57:16.589
Yogi, otherwise I would not call you at all
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:18.289
But for a Guru it is very important.

00:57:18.289 --> 00:57:23.220
I have seen sometimes even the leaders supporting
somebody who is absolutely horrid!

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:27.269
I can’t bear that person even for five minutes!

00:57:27.269 --> 00:57:33.470
But here the Guru sends him over to Me, “Oh,
Mother, he’s so good, you know, he donated

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:34.470
so much money."

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:35.470
It doesn’t matter.

00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:36.950
You donated money, so what?

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:38.520
Who asked him to donate money?

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:42.829
But he should not donate his bhoots to us
now anymore!

00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:44.950
We don’t want his bhoot!

00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:45.950
So that’s what it is.

00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:50.359
So the judgment should be correct about a
person when you say that this man is not good

00:57:50.359 --> 00:57:52.029
or that is not good.

00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:57.690
But mostly ‘gurus’ themselves are caught
up and then they are ambitious and if somebody

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:02.239
doesn’t listen to them or somebody wants
to give a lecture at a wrong time and somebody

00:58:02.239 --> 00:58:05.990
says, “You shouldn’t talk like this,”
or something, then they get angry.

00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:10.640
They are very hot tempered and they provoke
people, they say things sometimes.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.720
And then when people react they say, “You
are a bad Sahaja Yogi."

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.720
That’s not the way.

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:23.260
First of all a guru or a leader has to be
himself a very mild, gentle, and a good person.

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:28.309
He has to be in such a way [that] he should
not demand anything, should not ask for anything.

00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:29.770
Never demand anything!

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:35.150
Anybody who demands can not be a guru.

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:38.589
Respect is to be commanded and not to be demanded.

00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:47.050
And so, everything works out well if you understand
that – once you rise in your ascent, in

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:51.700
your wisdom, in your awareness and in your
Spirit – automatically all these things

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:52.700
happen!

00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:57.380
You don’t have to ask for anything, you
don’t have to plead for anything, you don’t

00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:59.859
have to complain for anything, everything
works out.

00:58:59.859 --> 00:59:04.160
You are looked after by all the ganas, by
all the angels.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.400
They are there.

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.940
You are on the stage.

00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:08.799
But if you are halfway then they play tricks
with you.

00:59:08.799 --> 00:59:15.249
You see, they play tricks, they make you falter,
you have problems, you go here, you go there,

00:59:15.249 --> 00:59:19.809
all these things happen and then you say,
“Mother, how is it this happened?”

00:59:19.809 --> 00:59:25.300
Because they are also jokers, so they play
jokes with you and they make problems for

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.099
you just to make you understand that you are
doing wrong.

00:59:28.099 --> 00:59:34.710
So we are on a stage where there’s a beautiful
security, everything is there and we have

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:40.890
to give to the world such a great thing like
Sahaja Yoga, which is for the emancipation

00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:46.200
of the whole world, as you realise, and so
also I hope you realise your responsibilities.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:52.279
There are so many things one has to understand,
how one has to be as a guru, how he has to

00:59:52.279 --> 00:59:54.640
act and how he has to work out.

00:59:54.640 --> 01:00:00.009
Now I have given so many lectures on Guru
things, but, for today’s lecture, only I

01:00:00.009 --> 01:00:08.339
have to say that, first thing, to have a guru
system, you must have complete humility.

01:00:08.339 --> 01:00:18.130
Now, with Me, I would say, I am too simple
and I am Mahamaya, so you be very careful.

01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:21.519
You cannot take liberties with Me.

01:00:21.519 --> 01:00:22.790
You cannot take.

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:28.059
If you try to take too much liberties that
means you are not a disciple.

01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:31.749
A disciple has to keep a distance from the
Guru.

01:00:31.749 --> 01:00:36.440
You cannot just take liberties, walk into
My room every time, sit there for hours together,

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.029
chit-chat with Me – nothing!

01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:40.140
You have no right.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:46.411
Only when I call you, when I ask for you,
you should come.

01:00:46.411 --> 01:00:50.319
Then you should not force things on the Guru
that, “Please, come and listen to this,”

01:00:50.319 --> 01:00:52.999
or, “Do this!” that should not be said.

01:00:52.999 --> 01:00:58.849
For example, yesterday nobody told Me there
are going to be these music programs or everything

01:00:58.849 --> 01:00:59.849
arranged.

01:00:59.849 --> 01:01:05.609
So we have to report everything to your leader,
or to Me, all those things that you want to

01:01:05.609 --> 01:01:06.609
do.

01:01:06.609 --> 01:01:07.609
And it should be really transparent.

01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:11.680
Like this hand knows everything that this
hand is doing, and this hand knows everything

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.869
that this hand is doing.

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:15.890
In the same way everybody should know each
other.

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:20.519
Then the gurus should not have jealousies
for each other.

01:01:20.519 --> 01:01:26.369
This I’m just telling you because also I
found out that there are certain jealousies.

01:01:26.369 --> 01:01:34.140
And when they talk there is a little bit of,
“Ha, he’s good, but this, this, this."

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:39.700
When they enjoy each other’s company because
they have reached a certain state and they

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.250
understand, “This is the state we are in."

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:46.890
When they enjoy each other’s company fully
and appreciate each other much more than anybody

01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:50.999
else – the guru’s company.

01:01:50.999 --> 01:02:00.200
All the company of the leaders, if they enjoy
each other and there’s no jealousy, there’s

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.809
no fight, there’s no problem but just the
enjoyment of the company, then they should

01:02:04.809 --> 01:02:06.210
know that they have become a guru.

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:08.470
Now all of them never fought with each other.

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:09.470
They supported.

01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:13.460
Actually it is one Principle was born again
and again.

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:19.589
But only the satanic people – they’ll
fight among themselves, not the godly.

01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:27.420
And also they will talk against the person
who is a realised soul or who is an Incarnation,

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.479
but never against themselves.

01:02:28.479 --> 01:02:34.329
It’s very surprising that the satanic people
though they fight among themselves, there

01:02:34.329 --> 01:02:37.819
are jealousies, they’ll never talk of each
other.

01:02:37.819 --> 01:02:41.310
But here I find that in Sahaja Yoga we have
freedom.

01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:46.049
But freedom is not abandonment, is the freedom
with complete rules and regulations of the

01:02:46.049 --> 01:02:51.650
Divine, with us, and we have to know them
that this is the Divine Law.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:57.913
So all of us are now sitting like in a big
vimana, like an aeroplane, and we all have

01:02:57.913 --> 01:02:59.599
to land into the beautiful area.

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:11.400
But first of all we have to develop that humility
in your heart; complete humility and surrender,

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.400
that’s very important.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.400
Unless and until you have that humility and
surrender in your heart, Guru principle can

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.710
not be awakened.

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:22.319
First you have to be the disciple and then
the guru.

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:25.370
So you have to develop that humility.

01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:31.410
And that humility comes very easily if you
love Me, respect Me.

01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:32.430
It’s not only love, but respect.

01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:42.480
That respect has to be there and then people
will respect you.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.480
May God bless you
