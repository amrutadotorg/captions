WEBVTT

00:02.470 --> 00:14.127
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of the Devi

00:18.247 --> 00:24.287
The Devi has many forms but

00:24.407 --> 00:29.473
is the embodiment of the shakti.

00:29.593 --> 00:37.527
Adishakti gives shakti to all these embodiments.

00:37.647 --> 00:44.447
And so there are many Goddesses we have at different times.

00:44.567 --> 00:48.797
They came on this earth and did

00:48.917 --> 00:57.007
all that was necessary for the ascent of people who were seekers.

00:57.127 --> 01:06.807
Specially the one we know of Jagadamba, the Durga.

01:06.927 --> 01:15.327
She was trying to protect all the seekers of truth

01:15.447 --> 01:21.127
and to destroy all evil forces.

01:23.767 --> 01:30.487
Because without the ascent of human beings,

01:30.607 --> 01:34.101
they do not know the truth.

01:34.327 --> 01:38.927
And that's why whatever they try to do

01:39.047 --> 01:44.007
is a mental projection. And this mental projection,

01:44.127 --> 01:51.847
if it is not substantiated by truth, by dharma, it declines.

01:53.207 --> 01:56.327
In Sanskrit they call it 'glaani'.

01:56.447 --> 02:00.247
When this glaani takes place

02:03.847 --> 02:10.327
then incarnations are born to solve the problem.

02:13.807 --> 02:22.007
In all incarnations of the Goddess, there have been,

02:22.127 --> 02:26.247
very much incarnated the satanic forces.

02:26.367 --> 02:32.967
They had incarnated and She had to fight them, with them

02:33.247 --> 02:35.447
and destroy them.

02:36.847 --> 02:42.447
But this destruction was not for the destruction sake that

02:42.567 --> 02:45.887
the evil forces are to be destroyed

02:46.007 --> 02:52.127
but evil forces always try to put down the seekers,

02:52.247 --> 02:59.927
put down the saints, try to harm them, sometimes even destroy.

03:05.447 --> 03:14.127
All these destructive forces do not come at the same time, normally

03:14.247 --> 03:18.207
at different times. Is easy to handle

03:18.327 --> 03:23.487
but the aim of the incarnation is to save,

03:23.607 --> 03:26.247
to protect the people who are seekers

03:26.367 --> 03:29.647
because they are the most important people

03:29.767 --> 03:36.487
in the realm of spirituality. All others are nothing but dust,

03:36.607 --> 03:44.367
good for nothing, useless. If they are not seeking the truth

03:44.487 --> 03:50.447
in the eyes of God, they are just useless lives

03:50.567 --> 03:54.287
that have come and will be finished.

03:54.407 --> 03:57.743
They have no value and they have no dignity.

03:57.863 --> 04:02.287
They have no understanding of anything.

04:02.407 --> 04:09.727
So in the judgment of the divine love, we have two types of people:

04:09.847 --> 04:17.407
one who are seekers of truth and the another who are not.

04:17.527 --> 04:20.931
They may be good people. They will be nice people,

04:21.051 --> 04:24.746
they'll be doing us lot of good works: social work, this work,

04:24.866 --> 04:28.931
missionary work, every sort of work they might be doing.

04:29.051 --> 04:32.331
But if they are not seeking the truth

04:32.451 --> 04:35.087
then they do not come to that category

04:35.207 --> 04:39.425
where God has to incarnate.

04:40.951 --> 04:44.227
So try to understand the preciousness,

04:44.347 --> 04:47.967
the importance of seekers.

04:49.687 --> 04:53.807
And that's what you have been seeking.

04:54.607 --> 05:02.007
Very few persons, if you take the percentage, are seeker.

05:02.127 --> 05:10.007
Is very, very wee bit. But it's very important because, say,

05:10.127 --> 05:22.807
a one little part of gold is much more valuable

05:22.927 --> 05:30.487
than mounds of steel. In the same way, a seeker

05:30.607 --> 05:35.727
is much more valuable in the growth of spirituality.

05:35.847 --> 05:39.967
The whole universe was created,

05:40.087 --> 05:47.327
whole atmosphere was built, all the evolution took place

05:47.447 --> 05:52.447
for what? That human beings should know the truth.

05:55.015 --> 05:58.824
But in the modern atmosphere,

05:58.944 --> 06:02.023
it's a very big curse, I think the greatest evil

06:02.143 --> 06:05.407
than all the Shumbha Nishumbhas and all that,

06:05.527 --> 06:09.567
the worst of all is materialism

06:10.287 --> 06:14.007
because materialism makes you gross.

06:14.127 --> 06:16.767
In your seeking also when you are rising,

06:16.887 --> 06:25.167
subtly that materialism catches you. I have been noticing this.

06:26.967 --> 06:31.276
When people come to Sahaja Yoga, right,

06:31.396 --> 06:36.367
they are going deep into themselves.

06:36.487 --> 06:41.327
They are understanding what I am saying. All the inner knowledge

06:41.767 --> 06:46.167
they want to know, what is called as Atmagyan.

06:46.287 --> 06:48.477
Atmagyan means two things:

06:48.597 --> 06:54.185
the knowledge about the spirit and knowledge about yourself.

06:54.305 --> 07:00.407
All this they find out and they know what it is.

07:02.727 --> 07:10.727
This state is the state for which people have been doing

07:10.847 --> 07:14.407
all kinds of things: going to the Himalayas,

07:14.527 --> 07:19.727
meditating in the cold without much clothes on them,

07:19.887 --> 07:23.687
living in the caves with some fruits.

07:25.367 --> 07:34.047
All kinds of tapasyas they would do because the seeking was so deep,

07:34.527 --> 07:42.247
so urgent, and they could not get out of that force of seeking.

07:43.767 --> 07:54.727
But in the modern times, materialism retards that hankering,

07:55.287 --> 08:02.967
that dedication. It's maddening for people when they are seekers.

08:05.007 --> 08:12.536
I have seen before coming to Sahaja Yoga, people spend lot of money,

08:12.656 --> 08:20.207
go to various places, go to Himalayas, go to Nepal, go to Japan,

08:20.327 --> 08:23.914
all over the places they are moving.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.967
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

08:28.087 --> 08:31.852
after they have become the spirits,

08:32.124 --> 08:38.008
for the growth of your new awareness

08:39.047 --> 08:42.247
the progress is retarded.

08:42.367 --> 08:47.887
Also one should understand that after so much of running about,

08:48.007 --> 08:52.287
you find something so precious so you settle down with that.

08:52.647 --> 08:57.087
And you feel very satisfied about it. That part is all right.

08:57.207 --> 09:02.847
But what later? Your growth should not stop.

09:05.047 --> 09:07.767
And that stops because,

09:07.887 --> 09:12.247
because of one of the main reasons is materialism.

09:15.087 --> 09:17.047
Because of materialism,

09:17.167 --> 09:21.447
your faith in yourself is also less.

09:22.207 --> 09:27.727
Now as you have seen that the Gods prayed to the Goddess

09:27.847 --> 09:31.807
and She came and killed all the negative forces.

09:34.607 --> 09:40.487
Reason was: the earnest desire of the Gods

09:41.527 --> 09:45.047
compelled Her to take incarnation.

09:45.687 --> 09:49.167
Such sincere desire

09:50.087 --> 09:58.047
that they could not get sometimes food, even water,

09:58.167 --> 10:04.567
and they worked so hard for their ascent

10:04.687 --> 10:08.407
which was disturbed by negative forces.

10:09.687 --> 10:17.720
So their call was so from the heart,

10:17.840 --> 10:22.464
so desperate and genuine and sincere

10:22.584 --> 10:28.087
that the Goddess had to take birth on this earth

10:28.207 --> 10:35.447
to save them, to protect them, to look after them.

10:37.807 --> 10:47.127
But as it is, we see once you have reached a destination,

10:47.367 --> 10:50.247
we feel now better settle down.

10:52.567 --> 10:57.287
Now, what do you - we settle down with?

11:00.167 --> 11:07.127
If after getting Realization you are complete,

11:07.527 --> 11:12.887
you are in totality, you are absolutely one with reality,

11:13.007 --> 11:15.407
there is nothing to be done.

11:18.327 --> 11:20.527
You become a saint.

11:20.727 --> 11:27.167
And a saint does not need any advertisement, does not need anything.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.127
His message spreads. People see him and know

11:30.247 --> 11:33.047
he is a great saint.

11:33.167 --> 11:36.687
So many saints did not even leave their houses.

11:36.807 --> 11:39.607
Very common saying in India,

11:39.727 --> 11:42.087
"Your takiya you should not leave,"

11:42.207 --> 11:46.367
the pillow on which you are resting, you should not leave.

11:46.487 --> 11:52.247
That was a criteria of a guru. Those who have to seek

11:52.367 --> 11:56.847
should come to the gurus and should climb up,

11:56.967 --> 11:59.567
at least six seven miles up,

11:59.687 --> 12:02.437
and then the guru doesn't meet any one.

12:02.557 --> 12:04.973
He may slap you. He may hit you.

12:05.093 --> 12:09.327
He may drop you from that high mountain.

12:09.447 --> 12:14.687
He'll take your test by so many ways.

12:14.807 --> 12:19.007
Ultimately he may select one person to give Realization.

12:19.767 --> 12:23.647
So this hankering, this desperate effort

12:23.767 --> 12:27.447
was all the time there.

12:29.207 --> 12:34.687
Now so we come to Sahaja Yoga in this modern time.

12:37.047 --> 12:46.407
Sometimes I feel that not only Sahaja Yoga is very easy

12:46.527 --> 12:55.727
also it is extremely pampering. You know you have got Realization.

12:55.847 --> 13:00.327
You all know that you are better than others,

13:00.447 --> 13:02.687
that you have got rid of so many problems

13:02.807 --> 13:06.767
and that now you have become master of your own.

13:06.967 --> 13:13.207
Then the responsibility

13:14.767 --> 13:22.407
that you have towards yourself and to your fellow men reduces

13:23.207 --> 13:26.807
because you feel very satisfied with yourself.

13:28.247 --> 13:30.847
The other day some Sahaja yogini rang Me up.

13:30.967 --> 13:34.207
I mean, they ring Me up for everything.

13:35.607 --> 13:41.127
She said that, "I went to the doctor and he put radiation

13:41.247 --> 13:45.687
and they found I was pregnant so what should I do about the baby?"

13:45.807 --> 13:49.367
For such a small thing they will ask.

13:49.487 --> 13:52.047
"What should the name of our son?"

13:52.167 --> 13:54.407
"What is this?" "What is that?"

13:54.527 --> 13:58.847
I mean, I have to do much more work than any priest has to do.

14:00.007 --> 14:05.527
Little, little things they are worried about. All right,

14:06.047 --> 14:11.047
that part is all right that I have to tell you

14:11.167 --> 14:14.887
what is to be done at such a point or what should we do.

14:15.007 --> 14:17.887
If they miss the train, they will telephone to Me,

14:18.007 --> 14:20.647
"Mother, we have missed the train. Now what to do?"

14:20.767 --> 14:24.687
So I have to tell them, "All right, give them a bandhan."

14:24.807 --> 14:27.287
That also I have to tell them.

14:27.407 --> 14:34.247
Or supposing their father is sick. He has a heart trouble

14:34.367 --> 14:37.567
then they will telephone to Me, "Mother, my father is sick.

14:37.687 --> 14:40.327
He has a heart trouble. He is not a Sahaja yogi.

14:40.447 --> 14:44.687
What can You do about it?" So Mother has to put attention

14:44.807 --> 14:47.767
to his father who is not a Sahaja yogui.

14:50.007 --> 14:53.527
Small, small things they write to Me.

14:53.647 --> 14:57.087
Such small things that you can't imagine

14:57.807 --> 15:03.527
how they do not understand what I am here for.

15:05.727 --> 15:11.207
Still, I have never said that "It's a stupid thing to ask Me.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.647
You should not waste My time," never.

15:15.767 --> 15:18.647
But it is to be seen now

15:19.007 --> 15:25.647
that if you do not value yourself as realized souls,

15:25.767 --> 15:28.887
you can not value My time also

15:29.007 --> 15:33.807
or what is Myself.

15:33.927 --> 15:38.167
This incarnation can be wasted completely

15:38.687 --> 15:43.607
because of this materialistic attitude.

15:46.327 --> 15:49.407
In this modern times, I don't know

15:49.527 --> 15:52.127
what's gone wrong with human beings

15:52.247 --> 15:57.327
because the most important thing in your life

15:57.447 --> 16:00.567
is to ascend and to grow.

16:00.807 --> 16:04.607
Take a big vision of the whole thing.

16:04.807 --> 16:08.807
Why this universe was created?

16:08.927 --> 16:14.047
Why you were created as human beings?

16:14.207 --> 16:19.247
What was the need to do all these things? For what is it done?

16:19.367 --> 16:23.447
If you have a very big vision of the whole thing

16:23.567 --> 16:27.207
then try to locate your position: "Where am I?!

16:27.327 --> 16:30.487
And then, "How the Divine has selected me

16:30.607 --> 16:34.087
and now I have become a Sahaja yogi?"

16:36.327 --> 16:39.167
So now, "What is my responsibility?"

16:39.687 --> 16:42.247
that one has to see.

16:43.367 --> 16:47.607
But on the contrary, I have seen people

16:48.087 --> 16:51.767
who are saying have a transfer. So they will telephone and ask,

16:51.887 --> 16:56.007
"Mother, should we take our chair or not?"

16:57.807 --> 17:01.607
That shows they have no value about themselves

17:01.727 --> 17:05.847
and no value about Me, both ways.

17:05.967 --> 17:10.407
Because they are asking such small things, such silly things

17:10.527 --> 17:13.647
that is impossible to understand how

17:13.767 --> 17:18.727
could Sahaja yogis ask such questions.

17:26.767 --> 17:33.167
The perspective we can see: the Goddess.

17:33.407 --> 17:36.127
She comes on this earth

17:36.247 --> 17:39.687
in different forms at different times

17:40.407 --> 17:44.447
to save the seekers of truth

17:45.007 --> 17:50.327
and to work out the ascent of the seekers of truth.

17:50.447 --> 17:53.087
Can you imagine?

17:53.207 --> 17:57.327
A very big difference in the incarnation

17:57.447 --> 18:03.087
of the Goddess before Kaliyuga.

18:03.847 --> 18:09.287
While now, it's a very different thing

18:09.407 --> 18:12.247
that you have come on this earth

18:12.367 --> 18:16.287
to become the Sahaja yogis.

18:16.407 --> 18:21.087
You  have to have a body, a mind,

18:21.207 --> 18:26.767
feeling everything which is just charged with spirituality,

18:26.887 --> 18:28.927
charged with your spirituality.

18:29.047 --> 18:33.087
Should be normally

18:33.207 --> 18:36.167
because how many years in the past

18:36.287 --> 18:39.167
you have been seeking God.

18:39.287 --> 18:44.887
Then that came here. What a coincidence!

18:45.447 --> 18:53.247
When, what is it? When you have such a great advantage

18:53.367 --> 18:58.847
that you have come to Sahaja Yoga because of your seeking

18:58.967 --> 19:04.127
and now you have found the satisfaction out of it.

19:04.247 --> 19:09.927
What is the responsibility that you have?

19:14.727 --> 19:18.927
That the incarnation Itself has come on this earth,

19:19.047 --> 19:25.607
not only to protect you, to nourish you, and to kill the demons, no!

19:25.727 --> 19:28.447
She has come on this earth

19:28.567 --> 19:33.447
to tell you about everything that is subtler

19:33.567 --> 19:38.887
inside and to tell you what should be

19:39.007 --> 19:43.607
your relationship: should be outside as well as inside.

19:43.727 --> 19:45.927
You were never connected with truth.

19:46.047 --> 19:49.767
You were never connected with this all-pervading power.

19:49.887 --> 19:55.447
You were never connected with God Almighty.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.367
So one has to understand that,

20:00.487 --> 20:05.327
"What a great thing has happened that out of me only,

20:05.447 --> 20:07.807
this Kundalini has come out

20:07.927 --> 20:17.527
and She has touched these higher centers." How?

20:17.767 --> 20:21.047
This was not done before, no.

20:21.167 --> 20:25.887
They were just protected. They were just looked after.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.767
Nowhere it is written that "Goddess

20:28.887 --> 20:32.487
has given Realization to people" nowhere.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.687
She is responsible. She can give.

20:36.807 --> 20:40.047
One of Her names is that. Not one but at least ten names are

20:40.167 --> 20:46.367
that She gives you your nirvana, that She gives you your freedom,

20:46.487 --> 20:50.007
that She introduces you to liberty.

20:50.127 --> 20:56.527
All these things are written but what's happening now

20:56.647 --> 21:03.047
is that people have not yet been able to grasp

21:03.167 --> 21:08.287
the value of their life in the modern times.

21:09.927 --> 21:13.127
See the way people ask questions.

21:13.247 --> 21:16.207
See the way people, the inquiry is on,

21:16.327 --> 21:18.647
the way people are worried,

21:18.767 --> 21:20.327
"Now my child is big.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.487
What should I do?" What should you do?

21:23.607 --> 21:26.287
Child is big. Put him to school. Do what you like.

21:26.407 --> 21:31.167
"Mother, will you please tell where to put the child."

21:31.447 --> 21:35.167
Then you put the child."Have you seen the school, Mother?" "No, I haven't."

21:35.287 --> 21:37.447
"Then you go and inspect the school."

21:37.567 --> 21:41.887
Imagine Kali Mata doing that!

21:42.007 --> 21:45.927
She would have given two nice tight slaps, I tell you.

21:46.407 --> 21:50.247
Any body who would have said that, what do you make out of it?

21:51.447 --> 21:56.847
But to that detailed extent a Motherhood has to work out.

21:56.967 --> 22:00.567
You won't do that for your own child, I know.

22:01.407 --> 22:06.127
But when it comes to children, what are they doing?

22:07.887 --> 22:10.087
Still materialistic.

22:12.407 --> 22:17.447
Today specially it's a very great day of Dussehra.

22:18.047 --> 22:23.247
This is the day when, as you know, Ravana was burnt.

22:23.687 --> 22:27.247
Effigies of Ravana were burnt all over the place.

22:27.367 --> 22:33.727
When Shri Rama came this was done, His victory.

22:33.847 --> 22:35.447
But in His victory,

22:35.567 --> 22:38.007
it was not that He made Sahaja yogis

22:38.127 --> 22:41.167
or He gave Realization, no.

22:42.007 --> 22:45.247
His victory was that He killed Ravana.

22:47.087 --> 22:51.247
That was done that time for today's preparation.

22:52.367 --> 22:56.767
For today's happening, it was done long time back

22:59.007 --> 23:05.527
that these days will come

23:05.647 --> 23:14.007
when people will have proper value system of victory of Shri Rama.

23:15.527 --> 23:17.647
But it doesn't happen.

23:21.167 --> 23:25.487
It doesn't happen. Because this incarnation

23:25.607 --> 23:32.087
of Mataji Nirmala Devi is very different, very illusive, Mahamaya.

23:34.167 --> 23:36.607
So you are left to yourself,

23:36.727 --> 23:41.247
do what you like. Whatever you like, you can do it.

23:41.927 --> 23:46.927
So they will ask Me, "Mother, we have a problem."

23:47.047 --> 23:52.527
I said, "What?" "We don't know which kind of chairs we should buy."

23:53.447 --> 23:57.287
For every small thing they will refer to Mother

23:57.407 --> 24:00.807
but for important things, never.

24:00.927 --> 24:04.927
Sort of a funny use of the whole thing has started

24:05.047 --> 24:08.007
which is so great, so important

24:08.127 --> 24:12.327
is used for something absolutely nonsensical.

24:13.607 --> 24:17.087
So see the difference between the incarnations.

24:17.207 --> 24:21.887
One incarnation comes on this earth to save the people,

24:22.007 --> 24:26.847
to bring them out of the mire of Maya.

24:28.207 --> 24:32.847
But another incarnation which has come

24:32.967 --> 24:37.407
is not only just to talk about it

24:37.527 --> 24:40.327
but to give you your Realization

24:40.447 --> 24:43.967
and then to look after your small, small things.

24:45.927 --> 24:48.367
So when this lady telephoned and asked Me,

24:48.487 --> 24:53.087
"What should I do? Please Mother, cure me."

24:54.287 --> 24:57.207
It's very different attitude.

24:57.327 --> 25:00.047
Between the bhaktas of those days

25:00.167 --> 25:04.247
and the bhaktas of today, there's a very big difference.

25:04.367 --> 25:07.287
I said, "You never asked Me

25:07.407 --> 25:09.847
when you did all that, doesn't matter.

25:09.967 --> 25:13.287
Now whatever you have done, it's better I see the child,

25:13.407 --> 25:17.887
look after the child, put the child right but you come along."

25:22.367 --> 25:27.647
But then I realized that this woman is so attached to her child.

25:27.767 --> 25:30.287
And I telephoned to the leader

25:30.407 --> 25:33.407
and he said, "It's terrible attachment.

25:35.887 --> 25:39.087
It's a terrible attachment to the child."

25:39.887 --> 25:43.927
So now from one nonsense to another nonsense.

25:45.687 --> 25:52.887
This incarnation has such variety of jobs to be done.

25:53.007 --> 26:00.567
I mean, even the 64 kalas, the 64 expertise

26:00.687 --> 26:04.847
of Shri Ganesh is not sufficient to solve this.

26:07.207 --> 26:14.647
Why is it so complicated? After giving Self- Realization,

26:14.767 --> 26:18.647
it should be a straight forward march

26:18.767 --> 26:23.127
towards your goal and towards your growth.

26:24.247 --> 26:28.727
But why is it that such a complicated nonsense

26:28.847 --> 26:31.967
is all the time bothering you?

26:35.087 --> 26:39.219
What do you want? We should ask, "Now what do you want?"

26:39.339 --> 26:42.287
"I want a child."

26:42.407 --> 26:46.207
After Sahaja Yoga, you should not want anything.

26:46.327 --> 26:50.167
"Why do you want to have a child? There are so many children.

26:50.287 --> 26:53.047
You can look after them."

26:56.087 --> 27:01.767
'I want' goes away, should go away from your mind that,

27:01.887 --> 27:11.567
"I want this and I want that." This wanting is over now.

27:11.767 --> 27:15.407
What you wanted: your Self-Realization.

27:16.327 --> 27:19.647
After that, what has happened is that now:

27:19.767 --> 27:25.727
what I want is more important and I want

27:25.847 --> 27:30.567
that you should become really detached from materialism.

27:31.087 --> 27:32.900
That doesn't mean

27:33.020 --> 27:36.772
that you should become like "Hare Rama Hare Krishna" no, no, no, no.

27:36.892 --> 27:39.207
They are not detached.

27:39.327 --> 27:45.127
They are very much attached people. But detachment is a state where

27:45.247 --> 27:49.367
nothing can bind you, nothing is important,

27:49.487 --> 27:53.647
most important thing  is your spiritual ascent.

27:53.767 --> 28:00.207
Nothing can attract you more than this.

28:00.327 --> 28:06.207
This is what exactly is wanted today,

28:06.327 --> 28:10.047
that Sahaja yogis should understand.

28:11.007 --> 28:15.207
Compared to what Sahaja yogis, compared to Sahaja yogis,

28:15.327 --> 28:19.487
what people have gone through. When I read it everyday,

28:19.607 --> 28:22.087
I feel terrible.

28:22.207 --> 28:26.567
Here everything is convenience, convenient,

28:26.687 --> 28:30.127
come along, enjoy nice food, nice company,

28:30.247 --> 28:36.607
it's a festival going on. Everything is [inaudible].

28:37.247 --> 28:39.607
And if something is missing, I will be the one

28:39.727 --> 28:41.796
to tell the organizers, "What is this?

28:41.916 --> 28:45.596
You should have done this. You should have done that."

28:52.967 --> 29:02.327
Now, we come to a point where we have to understand:

29:02.687 --> 29:05.167
What do we want?

29:08.007 --> 29:12.487
What's the use of killing Shumbha Nishumbhas?

29:12.607 --> 29:17.407
What's the use of killing this catholic church? What's the use?

29:17.527 --> 29:19.847
Because you are static.

29:21.327 --> 29:25.287
You are glued in one place, no progress.

29:25.407 --> 29:28.847
So what's the use of doing all these things all the time

29:28.967 --> 29:32.567
and destroying all that negativity.

29:34.687 --> 29:39.007
What is the purpose?

29:39.127 --> 29:42.007
It's too arbitrary, everybody says, "Mother,

29:42.127 --> 29:46.007
you have given them permission. You have given them license,

29:46.127 --> 29:49.167
so now they are doing the way they are."

29:49.287 --> 29:51.567
The other day, one girl came to Me.

29:51.687 --> 29:55.847
Her child was very sick. I asked her: "Do you meditate?"

29:55.967 --> 29:57.847
She kept quiet.

29:58.447 --> 30:01.047
I said I can make out that you don't meditate

30:01.167 --> 30:03.487
because I know what it is.

30:04.487 --> 30:07.607
That you don't even meditate?

30:09.687 --> 30:14.207
So today's main thing is this is a Dussehra day

30:14.327 --> 30:16.647
when the people go,

30:16.767 --> 30:19.287
cross the boundaries of their villages

30:19.407 --> 30:23.767
and bring gold for the parents.

30:24.047 --> 30:26.767
That's the story, it is like that.

30:26.887 --> 30:29.207
Now what you have to do is to

30:29.327 --> 30:35.047
cross the limits of materialism, this nonsensical

30:35.167 --> 30:39.607
dwarfy force that is working on you

30:39.887 --> 30:47.127
and you have to transcend and bring, as I said, gold

30:47.847 --> 30:56.007
that is untarnishable thing from the borders of Sahaja yoga.

30:58.207 --> 31:04.167
How many of you really are in the field of work?

31:04.287 --> 31:07.927
How many of you are telling about this to people?

31:09.607 --> 31:12.527
What are you doing about it?

31:19.207 --> 31:25.327
Why I am talking to you and not to Indians this way

31:25.447 --> 31:30.687
because their attitude is different.

31:30.807 --> 31:35.007
Their attitude is not materialistic. It's spiritual.

31:35.487 --> 31:38.567
They want their spiritual ascent

31:38.727 --> 31:44.447
for which they suffer a lot. They go out of the way to do things

31:44.567 --> 31:53.527
just to get to that state where they could be easily surrendered.

31:54.287 --> 31:57.767
This surrender state has to come.

31:57.887 --> 32:02.047
For example, you have a problem.

32:03.287 --> 32:06.927
Say problem, you have no holidays

32:07.047 --> 32:11.527
and you want to come for Pujas, say. I'm just giving an example.

32:11.647 --> 32:17.087
Now, if you want to come to Puja, you just come.

32:17.687 --> 32:21.567
Not only you will get job but you might get promotion.

32:22.967 --> 32:26.007
But you have no faith in your ascent.

32:26.127 --> 32:32.647
You have no faith that you are the chosen one.

32:32.967 --> 32:37.207
This is what is missing because of materialism.

32:39.807 --> 32:46.207
Recently in America, we have a very great Sahaja yogi,

32:46.327 --> 32:49.487
Dave Dunphy. I told him, "Dave,

32:49.607 --> 32:52.767
you better take over as the leader of America

32:52.887 --> 32:57.167
because this gentleman is not all right and you better take over."

32:58.007 --> 33:03.207
Immediately he said, "All right Mother." Now, he lives in Honolulu.

33:03.327 --> 33:09.727
Our programs and everything are done through L.A., Los Angeles,

33:09.847 --> 33:14.487
and it looked quite strange that I should ask him

33:14.607 --> 33:17.407
to come down and work there.

33:20.167 --> 33:22.327
Now, where are we?

33:22.447 --> 33:26.927
We are the people who have been blessed

33:27.167 --> 33:32.167
with all the powers. You have been blessed.

33:32.447 --> 33:34.263
But we don't want to practice.

33:34.383 --> 33:36.890
We don't want to find out what powers we have,

33:37.010 --> 33:38.875
worried about our own children,

33:38.995 --> 33:41.875
worried about what sari we are going to wear,

33:41.995 --> 33:45.126
or worried about who is the leader

33:45.246 --> 33:48.253
and what should we do about the leadership.

33:52.852 --> 33:55.967
All these things are not going to help us.

33:56.087 --> 34:00.343
You are not here for that. Try to understand.

34:00.463 --> 34:04.347
You are here for becoming the spirit

34:04.467 --> 34:11.647
and then to spread the light of the spirit. Nothing matters.

34:12.671 --> 34:16.243
Once you start doing that, you'll be amazed:

34:16.363 --> 34:21.799
the faith works. It's not blind faith. It's not blind faith.

34:22.590 --> 34:28.085
You don't have to tell Me even. It just works.

34:36.218 --> 34:45.927
It's a matter a few days, you might get many results

34:46.301 --> 34:52.030
of what you have been hankering after,  material,

34:52.150 --> 34:58.070
superficials, you might get. But the question remains.

35:00.599 --> 35:08.327
Somebody, say, wants to dedicate his life, so called,

35:08.465 --> 35:12.874
for Sahaja Yoga. Then what do you do?

35:12.994 --> 35:16.008
What do you do if you dedicate?

35:16.675 --> 35:20.753
First thing is your faith.

35:20.873 --> 35:26.432
You must know: how is your faith into anything.

35:26.552 --> 35:31.927
You really believe in it or you do not? If you do believe in it,

35:32.121 --> 35:34.838
what have you done about it?

35:37.871 --> 35:45.056
So at this stage, you have to introspect.

35:45.502 --> 35:47.579
What are you doing?

35:47.699 --> 35:52.301
What are we to do? How far do we have to go?

35:52.421 --> 35:56.607
It's a very, very important time

35:56.924 --> 36:03.621
and you are extremely important souls here sitting down

36:03.741 --> 36:11.125
but, if you don't value your own systems and yourself,

36:11.245 --> 36:14.445
why should God worry about you?

36:17.084 --> 36:20.643
Why should God try to give you ideas?

36:20.763 --> 36:25.412
Why should He try to take any interest even in you

36:25.532 --> 36:27.651
persons of that [kind].

36:33.040 --> 36:38.733
So now, I have to just tell you that on this day of this Puja,

36:38.853 --> 36:43.201
it's such a combination that it is the Dussehra I am here,

36:43.321 --> 36:48.858
and also is the now we can call it, the last day of the Devi Puja.

36:48.978 --> 36:53.250
We have to see within ourselves, introspect:

36:53.370 --> 36:56.863
"What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?"

37:01.135 --> 37:03.480
Except for looking after my children,

37:03.600 --> 37:07.677
cooking for the husband, that's all?

37:09.668 --> 37:14.073
Men can also think the same way: "What have we done?

37:14.533 --> 37:18.407
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?"

37:18.527 --> 37:23.295
Just: I want to meet in the politicians.

37:23.415 --> 37:28.828
I want to meet this person. I want to meet that person. For what?

37:29.129 --> 37:31.335
They should come and meet you

37:31.455 --> 37:34.541
but your faith in yourself is very weak.

37:34.661 --> 37:38.003
I think that's the main reason for all this fall

37:38.123 --> 37:40.654
is faith in yourself.

37:42.257 --> 37:57.740
This faith is such a thing that you know it is.

37:58.088 --> 38:01.246
You have seen My photographs.

38:01.366 --> 38:05.305
You are convinced about it. There is nothing to be convinced

38:05.425 --> 38:09.289
but this faith is not one with your heart.

38:09.409 --> 38:16.647
It is not just with your being. It's outside.

38:16.767 --> 38:19.299
All right, Mother will do that. Mother will solve this.

38:19.419 --> 38:21.612
Mother will do this.

38:23.558 --> 38:30.968
But, whole thing is now

38:31.265 --> 38:37.823
to Me looks like, that I have to compulsorily tell you

38:37.943 --> 38:41.102
to do some sort of a tapasya.

38:43.332 --> 38:51.455
You ask somebody, "Do you meditate?" "No Mother," very plainly.

38:52.161 --> 38:57.857
"No Mother, we don't." "So, what are you doing here?" "My,

38:57.977 --> 39:03.592
My... there is some pain in my knees so I have come to you."

39:03.712 --> 39:06.509
All right. "But I don't meditate. I am very honest.

39:06.629 --> 39:08.817
I don't meditate.

39:09.318 --> 39:12.342
I just have some pain in the knees. Please cure it.

39:12.462 --> 39:14.687
I don't meditate."

39:16.854 --> 39:22.070
How many of you really meditate every night?

39:24.041 --> 39:27.278
Guido said that, "Mother, if You tell like this they will say,

39:27.398 --> 39:29.697
'All right in the night we do but not in the morning'

39:29.817 --> 39:33.444
because Mother has said, 'Do it in the night.'"

39:34.104 --> 39:35.805
There is no earnestness.

39:35.925 --> 39:49.289
There is no expected any kind of a enthusiasm about it.

39:49.803 --> 39:53.074
All right, if not today, we will see tomorrow.

39:53.194 --> 39:56.729
Mother says like that, "It's not necessary.

39:56.849 --> 40:00.945
It's not important. It's all right."

40:01.065 --> 40:04.029
So you satisfy yourself.

40:04.238 --> 40:09.988
But who is the loser? Not Me. I don't need Sahaja Yoga, do I?

40:10.767 --> 40:14.541
I am doing all the tapasya for your Sahaja Yoga.

40:14.661 --> 40:19.459
What about you people doing some tapasya about it?

40:22.303 --> 40:28.044
So now, what I am trying to say that you have got your Realization.

40:28.164 --> 40:31.780
Now you have reached a great state of understanding,

40:31.900 --> 40:37.629
also of the inner knowledge and also about your connection

40:37.749 --> 40:41.645
with the spirit and with the God Almighty.

40:41.765 --> 40:44.379
All this you know now. Many things you know.

40:44.499 --> 40:52.261
Despite that, it's not yet what it should be from your heart.

40:52.381 --> 40:57.723
From your earnest desire.

41:00.643 --> 41:05.685
It doesn't help at all

41:05.838 --> 41:10.527
any one to deceive oneself, never.

41:12.207 --> 41:15.179
So I am not saying something for x, y, z.

41:15.299 --> 41:20.979
I am saying for all of you. Don't try to cheat yourself.

41:23.982 --> 41:29.853
You are here with such a great purpose.

41:30.975 --> 41:34.205
This purpose is corrective

41:34.325 --> 41:39.940
and is the freedom of our minds

41:40.060 --> 41:43.880
from all these nonsensical destructive forces

41:44.000 --> 41:49.671
and then to spread it all over, talk about it.

41:52.432 --> 41:59.876
My own conviction is this

41:59.996 --> 42:04.989
that something has to happen to Sahaja yogis

42:05.109 --> 42:10.374
to realize how important it is

42:10.494 --> 42:19.842
to work out something that is within us, which is potential,

42:19.962 --> 42:25.757
which is just about to bubble up. It's a responsibility,

42:25.877 --> 42:30.256
whether you are a Jew, a Christian or anything makes no difference.

42:30.376 --> 42:32.974
It is all outside.

42:33.094 --> 42:38.217
For what you have to do that you have come into a new realm

42:38.337 --> 42:42.535
of awareness, into a new realm of a higher life

42:42.655 --> 42:44.923
where you know all your inner self,

42:45.043 --> 42:49.261
you know all about what is good and what is not.

42:49.381 --> 42:54.014
Everything after knowing all this also if you do not grow

42:54.134 --> 42:56.605
then whom will you blame?

43:02.760 --> 43:08.268
So now we come to a point to understand

43:08.388 --> 43:11.288
the importance of this Kaliyuga,

43:11.408 --> 43:15.176
where your Mother is here to help you

43:15.296 --> 43:20.144
and also to look after you

43:20.264 --> 43:25.759
very tenderly, sweetly, to tell you everything.

43:25.879 --> 43:32.290
Actually I can not get angry with any one for more than one minute.

43:34.417 --> 43:41.180
So to explain to you sweetly what you should have done

43:41.300 --> 43:45.185
and which you can do, which you have to do.

43:45.305 --> 43:48.164
All these things I would have really

43:48.284 --> 43:51.862
would have been telling you all the time.

43:51.982 --> 43:56.430
I have been bringing you round very sweetly and explaining to you

43:56.550 --> 43:59.320
and telling you that, "This is your own power

43:59.440 --> 44:04.388
which is within you and which you have to look after and raise it",

44:04.508 --> 44:08.597
and also you have got so many books

44:08.717 --> 44:11.755
or ways of understanding that.

44:11.875 --> 44:15.434
But this inner knowledge which you have

44:15.554 --> 44:20.460
is something like this that I have a inner knowledge

44:20.580 --> 44:25.311
about, say about, how to build these things

44:25.431 --> 44:29.319
but I don't do it. It's as simple as that.

44:29.439 --> 44:33.816
I just don't do it. I have the inner knowledge, all right.

44:33.936 --> 44:40.296
I am a Ph.D. but I am mad. It's like that.

44:42.338 --> 44:46.696
So many people mentally very well equipped in Sahaja Yoga, I know.

44:46.816 --> 44:50.774
But as far as the following of Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

44:50.894 --> 44:53.760
they are not there.

44:53.880 --> 44:56.657
So I am warning you now.

44:56.777 --> 45:00.488
It's like Christ has said, "some seeds which are sprouted

45:00.608 --> 45:03.870
fell on the street, dried out and died."

45:04.647 --> 45:07.199
Now the judgment is going on all the time.

45:07.319 --> 45:11.573
When I am talking to you, it's all the judgment is going on.

45:12.002 --> 45:16.099
So every night you have to meditate.

45:16.219 --> 45:23.563
And you have to then think about what have you done tonight, today,

45:23.695 --> 45:27.365
in the whole day what have you achieved.

45:29.287 --> 45:35.717
But so calculating they are. Supposing I go there at five o'clock

45:35.837 --> 45:41.274
then I have to be back at 7 otherwise I will miss the point,

45:41.394 --> 45:44.939
I will not see this person, that person.

45:45.059 --> 45:49.212
So, everything works like that:

45:49.465 --> 45:54.569
with the time, with the importance of nonsensical things.

45:54.689 --> 45:58.594
What has to work is your faith:

46:00.167 --> 46:02.143
that I am going to do things

46:02.263 --> 46:06.696
which are truthful, which are sensible, down to earth

46:06.816 --> 46:14.433
and I'm going to keep myself absolutly extremely free and

46:14.553 --> 46:21.292
and I'm going to look after not only my inner being

46:21.412 --> 46:25.097
but the inner being of others.

46:25.217 --> 46:31.833
Today's special puja is really of more Right side I would say,

46:31.953 --> 46:34.424
Dussehra is a right side Puja

46:34.544 --> 46:40.312
because you worship Shri Rama and his bow and everything.

46:41.493 --> 46:47.957
But think of these incarnation. Fourteen years He went to jail.

46:48.077 --> 46:52.157
For a particular reason, He went there.

46:53.244 --> 46:58.044
I mean, if somebody has to go even for one year, it's a headache.

46:58.164 --> 47:02.819
It's not a jail but it's, we can call, in the forest that He went,

47:02.939 --> 47:07.597
it was like a jail to Him. He was a king's son.

47:07.717 --> 47:10.262
He had no place to live, to sleep.

47:10.382 --> 47:13.870
Everywhere He went, He had to build His own little hut.

47:13.990 --> 47:18.339
So He went there. He had to do it.

47:18.459 --> 47:21.284
Why, why did He do it?

47:22.165 --> 47:26.731
Because He had faith in Himself. He is Shri Rama

47:26.851 --> 47:29.689
and He has to jolly-well do these things.

47:29.809 --> 47:33.374
He had faith in Himself. And He had faith in God Almighty

47:33.494 --> 47:38.619
that whatever He is doing, He is doing as a will of God.

47:39.412 --> 47:42.769
And that is what I have to do, finished.

47:42.889 --> 47:46.517
I don't care whether I have to face Ravana

47:46.637 --> 47:50.398
or I have to face this or that, I don't care.

47:51.366 --> 47:56.367
I am a Sahaja yogi. I don't care.

47:56.551 --> 48:00.435
My job is to spread Sahaja Yoga, all right.

48:00.555 --> 48:06.174
My job is to cleanse myself up and know myself.

48:06.294 --> 48:09.686
This is my work, my job, and this is what I have to do.

48:09.806 --> 48:14.206
I am not bothered if I get admission in the school or not.

48:14.326 --> 48:17.963
I am not bothered if somebody has to go by plane,

48:18.083 --> 48:20.930
so he gets a ticket or not.

48:21.050 --> 48:23.012
You just won't believe

48:23.132 --> 48:25.355
that you show your faith in yourself,

48:25.475 --> 48:29.678
you'll get the admission, you'll get the ticket,

48:29.798 --> 48:34.855
whatever you want it's there. It's all there.

48:34.975 --> 48:38.058
You don't have to strive for it.

48:38.178 --> 48:42.839
You don't have to bother for it. It's just there.

48:43.918 --> 48:47.759
It is. I mean, all My life it has been happening.

48:47.879 --> 48:54.317
Of course My faith is like solid, like Gibraltar, no question.

48:54.437 --> 48:58.321
Because I know what I am and I know what I am supposed to do.

48:58.441 --> 49:01.745
So My, for Me I have no problem.

49:01.865 --> 49:04.729
All the faith and I know everyone

49:04.849 --> 49:09.451
and I can say that I can make out a flying bird.

49:11.062 --> 49:14.567
May not show that. Sometimes I may say that, all right

49:14.687 --> 49:17.655
this is good, this is that, but I know for definite

49:17.775 --> 49:21.139
what I am and what I have to do.

49:21.259 --> 49:24.655
In the same way, you have to know about yourself

49:24.775 --> 49:28.061
because it is a different category of people you are.

49:28.181 --> 49:31.290
You are not the ones who need protection from God,

49:31.410 --> 49:36.163
who need protection from the Mother, no.

49:36.813 --> 49:40.130
You have to give protections to others.

49:40.250 --> 49:42.803
It is you have to give light to others.

49:42.923 --> 49:45.200
You have to show them the path.

49:45.320 --> 49:51.602
So you are here for that purpose not for getting a house

49:51.722 --> 49:56.461
or a, what you call, income tax concession.

49:56.581 --> 50:01.618
You are not that for. All that nonsense you forget.

50:01.738 --> 50:05.197
Jolly-well, they'll have to give you concession.

50:05.902 --> 50:10.269
I, I live like that, absolutely. I am not bothered

50:10.389 --> 50:13.356
when I am traveling, whether there's a ticket or not

50:13.476 --> 50:18.420
whether there is, what you call, a seat or not. I am not bothered.

50:19.126 --> 50:23.891
I am not bothered at all. All right I am traveling.

50:24.011 --> 50:26.647
I don't even think I am traveling.

50:26.767 --> 50:29.607
I just think that I am there. That's all.

50:31.335 --> 50:33.750
So many things I say

50:33.870 --> 50:37.818
which looks so bombastic and looks so ego oriented,

50:37.938 --> 50:43.381
like I said, "This catholic church is about to finish."

50:43.501 --> 50:52.442
I said that. If it was someone else they'll say, "Perhaps, maybe."

50:57.971 --> 51:06.145
Now, so one has to change one's own language, the style.

51:06.265 --> 51:14.057
And our understanding should be that we are a rough people.

51:14.177 --> 51:18.250
We are rough as far as ourselves are concerned.

51:18.370 --> 51:22.847
With others we are kind, tender, and sweet.

51:22.967 --> 51:27.407
But as far as we are concerned, we are not.

51:27.629 --> 51:31.207
Once it happened, we had a transfer

51:31.327 --> 51:34.410
and we went into a house, very big house though,

51:34.530 --> 51:37.351
but there was nothing to sleep upon. There was one bed,

51:37.812 --> 51:41.532
very small. My husband was sleeping. He just can't do like that.

51:41.652 --> 51:44.668
I said, "All right, take a challenge." I slept on the ground.

51:44.788 --> 51:49.108
Next day, I had pain in the body. I told My body,

51:49.228 --> 51:54.581
"Behave yourself. You must learn how to sleep on stones also."

51:54.701 --> 51:59.028
And for one month I was sleeping on the ground, still.

51:59.790 --> 52:02.129
So you have to be harsh with your body.

52:02.249 --> 52:05.931
You have to be harsh with your mind which gives you ideas

52:06.051 --> 52:10.376
of materialism or of retarding your progress in spirituality.

52:11.312 --> 52:14.955
Now, escapes, escapes they find out.

52:15.075 --> 52:18.692
Ultimately, you come to the last point

52:18.812 --> 52:22.864
where you do not think about, say, material life

52:22.984 --> 52:25.572
and you don't think of mental life

52:25.692 --> 52:30.425
or so called these spiritual lives or anything but you think that

52:30.545 --> 52:33.778
it's all right, you are free from it and now you have become

52:33.898 --> 52:38.092
a very, very free person and you can do what you like.

52:38.212 --> 52:44.958
Supposing you reach a state like that then you just say, "Oh,

52:45.078 --> 52:51.806
I have reached that state, finished." How are we to believe?

52:51.926 --> 52:57.047
What's the proof that you have reached that state?

52:59.042 --> 53:04.291
You must show. Doesn't show but they say, "Ah, we are."

53:04.886 --> 53:07.021
There is a myth also in Sahaja Yoga:

53:07.141 --> 53:10.733
that senior, he is a very senior Sahaja yogi.

53:10.853 --> 53:12.953
I mean, I don't understand.

53:13.073 --> 53:17.331
What is this? How can there be seniority in Sahaja yoga?

53:17.451 --> 53:21.603
Cannot be seniority. No question.

53:22.169 --> 53:26.481
Somebody is say, enters into the sea.

53:26.601 --> 53:32.025
Some are there for ages standing near the edge

53:32.145 --> 53:34.847
of the sea holding on to the earth

53:34.967 --> 53:36.489
because they are afraid to swim

53:36.609 --> 53:39.607
and some people who have come only yesterday

53:39.727 --> 53:46.926
might be jumping and going ahead and doing, enjoying the sea.

53:47.056 --> 53:49.441
So how is it he is the senior?

53:49.967 --> 53:54.924
We do not have this seniority business in Sahaja yoga.

53:55.878 --> 53:57.687
There's no seniority.

53:57.807 --> 54:02.007
And there's also another myth. Maybe this is an excuse. I don't know

54:02.127 --> 54:04.804
what to say but it is a very common thing to say

54:04.924 --> 54:07.892
that he is a senior Sahaja yogi or he is a,

54:08.012 --> 54:13.342
after all he is a senior Sahaja yogi.

54:13.462 --> 54:15.345
Can't understand.

54:15.465 --> 54:16.972
Like saying a donkey,

54:17.092 --> 54:21.001
"This donkey is senior. Another donkey is not."

54:26.699 --> 54:30.589
Then another thing that you suffer from very much

54:30.709 --> 54:38.170
much, very common is this that "Mother said so."

54:39.727 --> 54:42.562
Anybody will say, "Oh, Mother said to me,

54:42.682 --> 54:45.817
She called me and She said it."

54:46.349 --> 54:49.592
"What did She say?" "Oh you are a very great Sahaja yogi.

54:49.712 --> 54:52.914
You are this. You are that. You are that."

54:54.546 --> 54:57.263
Now there are two possibilities.

54:57.882 --> 55:03.503
One, I might have said it just to befool him.

55:05.901 --> 55:08.213
I am Mahamaya.

55:10.417 --> 55:17.381
Or maybe I must have said all this just to see that pamper his ego

55:17.501 --> 55:20.714
so that he gets to Sahaja Yoga

55:20.834 --> 55:24.646
and does something substantial than to eat my head.

55:26.585 --> 55:30.567
So, "Mother said so." Such a great Sahaja yogi,

55:30.698 --> 55:35.127
I am such and such, very bombastic words,

55:35.247 --> 55:39.135
very bombastic language he would use.

55:40.626 --> 55:44.246
And then people, "Ah, what a Sahaja yogi!"

55:46.572 --> 55:53.847
So the judgment of a Sahaja yogi doesn't come from what he claims

55:53.967 --> 55:56.899
but what he achieves.

55:58.764 --> 56:03.366
I have seen some Sahaja yogis are extremely arrogant also.

56:03.486 --> 56:05.124
Extremely arrogant,

56:05.244 --> 56:09.630
think no end of themselves. All that is there.

56:09.750 --> 56:12.637
So many Sahaja yogis I have seen of that kind,

56:12.757 --> 56:15.207
that they are very, very arrogant

56:15.327 --> 56:19.616
and that they try to make a big show

56:19.736 --> 56:23.604
out of what great people they are.

56:23.724 --> 56:25.999
Humpty Dumpties, as they call them.

56:26.119 --> 56:31.472
All right, but what a Sahaja yogi who is not like that,

56:31.592 --> 56:34.440
what is his style is?

56:35.557 --> 56:37.940
He'll just watch. He will witness the whole thing

56:38.060 --> 56:41.937
just enjoy and laugh at what is happening.

56:42.057 --> 56:44.598
What is this man talking like this?

56:44.718 --> 56:47.777
What's the sense of his talking like this?

56:48.626 --> 56:54.363
A person who is a Sahaja yogi is a gem.

56:54.483 --> 57:01.588
Is a gem and gem for which you take him to anywhere, to any place,

57:01.708 --> 57:04.680
people will say he is a gem.

57:14.424 --> 57:23.837
My own style is this that when I see a person

57:23.957 --> 57:30.175
or a Sahaja yogi anywhere, first thing I go inside Myself,

57:30.810 --> 57:36.547
first thing. I don't know if you can do that. I can.

57:36.667 --> 57:42.045
And then I see that person in a very different perspective

57:42.224 --> 57:45.858
and understand. Because all these powers are with you also.

57:45.978 --> 57:48.721
It's not My powers only, you all have these powers

57:48.841 --> 57:51.127
but the only difference between you and Me

57:51.247 --> 57:53.447
is that I have all faith in Myself

57:53.567 --> 57:56.407
and you have no faith in yourself.

58:05.003 --> 58:12.644
So we are at a crossing roads where we have to understand

58:12.764 --> 58:17.442
who will go higher and who will go lower.

58:18.207 --> 58:20.611
You have to find out who is the one

58:20.731 --> 58:23.214
who is going to achieve something

58:23.334 --> 58:27.174
and where am I compared to that person.

58:28.939 --> 58:31.887
It's said, "You have to suffer. You have to do this.

58:32.007 --> 58:35.672
You have to do that." Nothing of the kind, by God's grace.

58:35.792 --> 58:38.254
Nothing of that kind.

58:40.825 --> 58:48.073
So now what is it? What will happen to a Sahaja yogi?

58:48.271 --> 58:53.449
How will you know who is a Sahaja yogi?

58:53.569 --> 59:00.489
How will you know who is just putting a lip service?

59:01.166 --> 59:04.310
Only way is that you evolve.

59:04.430 --> 59:06.991
You become like a mirror

59:07.111 --> 59:12.231
and you see for yourself what sort of a person he is

59:12.351 --> 59:17.567
and also you see yourself, what you are.

59:18.209 --> 59:22.607
Today's lecture is more, sort of,

59:22.727 --> 59:26.572
is actually absolutely inspired lecture.

59:26.692 --> 59:30.008
And it is the one that should tell you

59:30.128 --> 59:34.840
that all that we have done today

59:34.960 --> 59:43.585
is this to understand our own values about our own life.

59:43.705 --> 59:47.346
We should understand: "Why are we on this earth?

59:47.466 --> 59:53.074
What is our purpose and what you have to achieve?"

59:54.209 --> 01:00:00.872
See, this I give you My all blessings from My heart.

01:00:00.992 --> 01:00:07.049
And I want you to accept My blessings,

01:00:08.699 --> 01:00:17.207
to be the great lights of God's desire.

01:00:17.327 --> 01:00:22.748
Try to understand what important time you are born

01:00:22.868 --> 01:00:31.861
and that you have become such good, beautiful people of God.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.317
May God bless you!
