00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.260
Today is Shri Datta Jayanti (centenary).

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.260
Today is a very great day.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.660
I think this day has come only because of His blessings

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.040
that sahaja yoga has been blossomed in you people.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.260
The Guru of all the Gurus – Adiguru Shri Datta Maharaja.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.680
I bow to him, He is my Guru also.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.000
He has taught me quite enough on Sahaja Yoga

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.540
all through my many births.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.240
And because of that only I have been able to do some work in this birth also,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.140
continuing to do

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.540
Gurur Brahma Gurur Vishnu Gurur devo Maheshwara,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.760
Guru sakshat Parabrahma tasmai Guru dev namah.’

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.720
By the time Adyashakti created the universe

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.240
after creating the entire universe

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.000
like how a King spread out his kingdom

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.100
and comes to see the world thereafter in a disguise

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.000
in the same way Adishakti has also incarnated on this earth many a times.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.100
But no matter how supreme is Adishakti

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.220
she still needs a human Guru.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.260
The place of man is still superior to that power.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.320
If Shakti has to take form of a human being

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.580
then she is required to come on this earth

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.140
only after having achieved Her father sometimes

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.560
Her brother sometimes and Her son sometimes.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.100
First of all try to understand

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.900
that entire universe was created by Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesha

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:59.180
At that time a thought came in Adhishakti’s mind to lift people out of the world

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.020
who were stuck in it,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.160
and that if these three principles

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.180
were to be combined together somehow and the childlikeness

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.040
and innocence of Shri Ganesha could be absorbed by it

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.940
then it is possible to form a Guru from them who has to do a great task.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.240
She (Adishakti) was incarnated in the form of sati Anusuya.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.460
This is the only such a sati (a chaste woman faithful to husband) in the whole world

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.000
who has thought of emancipation of the human beings.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.460
This is a very great thing.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.960
These three children came to Anusuya.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.480
The meaning of Anusuya is the one who is void of envy;

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.400
she does not envy anyone,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.300
who is the universal love

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.280
In such a person there is no place for insignificant,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.480
petty thoughts

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.120
such as jealousy, anger etc.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.560
The one who does not have any asuya she is Anusuya.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.940
It is said that these three went to her door to examine her.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.880
And that moment she used her

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.620
tejbal (powerful radiance)

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.140
– what was this tejbal;

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.200
this was the love of mother, very much divine,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.700
love of a powerful mother.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.100
This tejbal fell on them

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.800
and they became small children.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.340
Their complete unified form is Shri Datta Maharaj.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.880
He is a strange majesty ,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.440
whatsoever description is made of him but will fall short.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.680
And even if this is made to be explained, it will be beyond explanation.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.200
This is Shri Datta Maharaj who is full of triguna (three attributes).

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.380
He came in the world in form of Adiguru many times

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.600
to teach how to cross the Bhavsagara (void).

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.040
Yesterday I have told you that we fight in the world by forming many religions.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.120
The same Shri Datta incarnated many a times on the earth.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.520
As I told you yesterday, King Janaka was one of them.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.360
King Janaka was the father of Janaki (Sitaji).

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.260
He was none other than the incarnation of Shri Dattatreya.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.120
Thereafter, Machindernath, most have you must have heard his name, was also His incarnation.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.940
After that Zoroaster who came three times on the earth,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.280
he was also His incarnation.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.700
After that Mohammad Sahab,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.080
who was His incarnation.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.820
And when he was asked that- ‘Bhai (Brother) there must have been others also before you?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.440
Then he replied, ‘ yes, there a Mohammad’.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.860
Then again he was asked who was before him. He replied, ‘there was one Mohammad’

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.180
Mohammad means Praise, the one who is praised, the one who deserves to be praised

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.400
and is the one who is redeemer of the world

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.840
They were all Mohammads, they were all Dattatreyas,

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.580
who came on earth regularly.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.280
After that Nanaka, Guru Nanaka.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.880
If you ever read his teachings,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.280
if you read his talks

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.620
then you will be surprised that he has always talked in a Sahaja.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.040
He has said “sahaja Samadhi lago”

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.360
He has said, ‘kahe re ban khojan jayi, sada niwasi sada alepa tohe sang samai,

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:41.940
pushpa madhya jo was basat hai mukur mahi jas chhayee, taise hi hari base nirantar ghat hi khojo bhai’

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.480
- why to go to forest to find Him,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.040
He is always there with you just like there is a fragrance in a flower

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.100
and just as the reflection is there in a mirror,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.840
in the same way God is residing in you eternally seek Him within.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.720
He is just inside, achieve him just inside.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.340
We are just singing poem, singing songs, we are just cramming his prescription.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.940
The talk of seeking this absolute principle, residing just inside the heart, has been made since ancient times

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.980
by these Adi Gurus, who are incarnated on this earth again and again.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.460
After the birth of the daughter of Mohammad Sahab,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.220
as I talked yesterday also, there was beginning of the caste “Shia” in Islam.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.160
Shia word has been derived from Sia

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.420
The word which come from Sia became shia-Sia means Sitaji.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.220
If you go to UP (Uttar Pradesh, India) then nobody says Sitaji, they say Siaji,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.080
“Siavar Ramchandra Ki Jai”. Everyone takes the name Sia.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.680
She was Sitaji, Adishakti herself

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.800
and her two sons, who were Hassan and Hussain,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.040
destroyed many evils.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.900
When they ultimately died after getting tried,

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.740
then in the next birth they thought of establishment of non-violence, violence led them nowhere.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.280
Experimenting

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.960
They were born as Mahavir and Buddha.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.540
Experiments do happen.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.940
After Nanak Sahab, around 50-60 years ago

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.920
in our Maharashtra Dattatreya incarnated

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.120
as Saibaba of Shirdi.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.140
If you want proof of it, then you get your realization

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.520
and after that if you put your hand on anyone,

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.400
then you will get vibration of same kind-

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.200
from just vibration only you can know about all.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:36.280
As you must have eyes to see any shape, its colour,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:43.520
in the same way you are required to feel vibrations so that you may know all the Gurus of the world

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.820
and will be able to know as who is a true Guru and who is a liar,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.560
who is equal to that incarnation of Adiguru Dattatreya,

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.980
for mere saying there are thousands of Guru in modern times.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.740
No one become Guru just by saying of another.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.460
And by believing in him also, he does not become a Guru.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.500
The meaning of Guru Word is very large. This must be understood.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.020
Today I want to talk on this issue- who is a Guru and who is not.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.280
The obvious meaning of Guru means the one who is bigger than us,

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:24.320
the one who is sitting at a place higher than us. As the water collected at a height spontaneously flows down,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:32.100
it is also eager to find a surface for itself, and to bring everyone to its surface. You keep water to a certain height;

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.440
it will be willing to (inaudible) everyone.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.520
This is the very meaning of Guru.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.220
The one who is not that kind is not a Guru.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:45.340
He is above us in every matter, not just in one matter.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.080
That is why we people who are wandering in street to street believing in Guru

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.140
should remember that the number of Gurus is in thousands.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.380
The Guru who talks of the absolute principle is a real Guru.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:09.260
Those who talk of God and of God and who uplift you are real Gurus.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.220
Those who make money from you are not Gurus.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.720
Those who charge money for their speech, they can never be Gurus.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.540
Because the speech which has come from God is a precious thing,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.320
the value of which you just cannot give.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:31.600
The day when you give value of it then that thing cannot be of God.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.840
You cannot go and purchase God from market.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.740
Remember, today we are confronting

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:43.160
thousands of such people who are making money in the name of God.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.500
Nothing can be bigger injustice and meanness than this.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.000
If there is any article, substance or a thing in this world which is equal to the kick of the feet of the God,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:01.080
then we can say that we are watching God.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.760
You see, just now there was someone who came to our house, making himself to be greatest Guru,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:13.440
started telling me that, ‘Shri Mataji you have all kind of things in your house, and you are working like a normal housewife,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.880
then how can you talk of God. I have given up this, I have given up that’.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.420
I told him that ‘if you genuinely know what is renouncing,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.020
then you should also know that, from all this things whatever you think is equal to dust of feet of my lord,

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:36.320
is even equal to the particles, then you pick up that thing, but weigh equally.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.620
He started watching here and there, saw this saw that.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.720
After that, he became embarrassed. I asked him, ‘did you discover anything?’

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.520
‘No, no. Nothing was found equal to what was asked for’.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:11:01.200
Then, I said, ‘son, what actually have you given up? What have you given up whose flag you are flowing from morning to evening, wearing saffron clothes and getting head bald, you are roaming in the whole world, crying.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.080
What have you given up? Only, this stones, this soil?’

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.960
In reality sahaja yoga is getting nurtured in normal people who are leading a household life.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:19.040
Sahaja yoga can never nurture in those who dig their flags.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.060
Those people who live with simple spontaneous emotions,

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.900
who live in majesty given by God,

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.340
in his happiness and joy, live with love,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:39.800
only such people of middle path reach to God.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.340
You should know what is the meaning of Guru

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.860
Now those who collect money wearing saffron clothes, they can never be Gurus.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:12:01.520
Those who had once broken bicycles are now moving in Impala (car) can never be Gurus.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.360
The one who has found God, if he wishes he can sleep on the ground

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.640
and if he wishes he can sleep in a palace comfortably.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.580
For this reason I will give an example of King Janaka.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:19.620
Once a very great arch called Nachiketa went to the King Janaka. He was first suspicious and eager.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.680
He asked his Guru, ‘why do you pay visit to him since he is a householder

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.460
and also a king and then why do you bow down before him and touch his feet?

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.500
He is a householder person!’Then he replied, ‘ok,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.140
you should go to the place of King Janaka and stay there.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.980
You know that he is called as a videhi (beyond body), he was a dehati(a country person)’.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:50.000
When Nachiketa lived with him then he saw that there was so much wealth , people were eating and living comfortably.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:59.060
The King enjoyed all type of meals; he roams and has children –such a man, and how it is possible that this man should know God?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.460
Next day he told that, “I am leaving just now, I’m just leaving now.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.380
I do not have to live here.’

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:12.260
Then king said, ‘ok, let’s go for a bath first. They went to bath in a river. He took him to Sharayu River for bath.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:19.380
While bathing in a river, suddenly somebody informed that, ‘O Lord, your palace is on fire.’

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:25.780
King Janaka said, ‘Let it be, just now I’m in meditation,’ he replied with a smile.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.240
This poor Nachiketa got little worried.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:35.720
After a while people told that ‘all of your family member have to run away and fire is fast approaching you.’

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.760
Then he said, ‘to hell with it, now I’m in meditation.’

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:45.520
Afterwards they said that, ‘fire has reached up to here and all your ornaments and clothes will get burnt.’

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.680
All the bodyguards also ran away.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:55.440
This Nachiketa whose one or two clothes were lying outside – he thought that if these too were burnt then what will happen him

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:02.240
So he also ran outside .He picked up all his clothes. Even then he (Janaka) was in meditation. When he came back,

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.640
Nachiketa was very much surprised. He asked ‘King, do you have not any worry that had your clothes been burnt

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.000
then would you have moved just in this way.’ Then he replied,

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:16.780
‘What is myth is going to be perished -there is no need to save it, till it is there keep it there or if it is not there then leave it.’

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:28.860
This is a true fact. Those Gurus who do not consider myth as myth then what are you going to find in them.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.020
There is one occurrence in my in -laws family.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.680
Once there came a Barat (Wedding Procession) to our house.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.880
There was a demand of Dahi-Wada (a fried dish dipped in sweetened curd) from them.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.960
The Baratis usually have some coquetry and during the days of winter people told them,

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.360
‘look in these days of winter it is very difficult to curdle because during winter evening curdling of milk is not done.’

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.820
But they were adamant on having Dahi Wada -get it just now.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.960
In those times there used to live a baba (a wanderer).

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.040
He was called for and was requested to arrange dish somehow.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.100
He replied that he would do it but then would not live here anymore.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.520
It was agreed and then he closed one window then another.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:24.420
After some time he said ‘look here it is your Dahi Wada now enjoy it.’ People began to eat dahi wadas- they were all happy.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:31.260
But Babaji ran away. He ran saving his life just in night. People could not understand why Babaji had to run away.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:40.740
Next day morning people from low caste came to take remaining of food.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.140
They came and when they saw all the utensils,

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:50.820
they began saying that who brought our pots here; these are our pots, who carried them here?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.380
The marriage was accomplished somehow that is why the girl went to her in-laws house

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.340
otherwise nobody could have sent her there.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.440
The reason was that all the people had got annoyed.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.640
They started telling who brought the pots here?

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.180
Our ancestors and also those of my grandfather’s,

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:10.780
did not believe in all these things, these were called Bhanamatis in Maharashtra,

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:19.880
nobody used to believe in all these things before, that something came from above(heaven) and they ate all the Dahi Wadas.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.760
You people should also think that does He have only one business to serve you people Dahi Wadas.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.080
When you make anybody a big Guru that he gives Rs.200 to you then I would say

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:36.800
if such are the donors then why not solve the economic problem? Give them all.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.200
They get you watches made in Switzerland.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.880
We will believe only if they get one made by God.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.360
This must be considered that we want to get that supreme.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.960
But your seeking is also in these gross things,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.720
in these stones,

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.880
money and wealth,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.180
that is why you consider these people as Gurus.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:02.740
Money is lost so is wealth. When all of your money is lost then you come to Me.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.840
Yesterday a woman came,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
you saw her how she was dancing and jumping.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.600
I asked her, ‘why have you come now?

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.940
She replied, ‘what to do,

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.540
I have become like this only!’ I said, ‘Ok, people make you fool and have I opened a mental hospital?

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.280
You went there to find what?’

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.840
Can God be achieved by dancing and jumping?

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.640
All the rules and regulations of our human beings,

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.400
those people who made this laws had no idea that how disgust human beings can be?

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.760
All those who have made these laws were very dignified

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.260
and very auspicious people.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.660
They could just not recognize the disgust

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.740
and evilness that how much a human being is entangled in filthy jobs from within.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.540
If those people come to know then new laws have to be made

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.420
to catch these people,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.120
all the people.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.700
Jesus Christ was crucified by these people.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.120
That was easy.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:02.900
But nobody can catch these people who are plundering money from you day and night

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.960
and are bent on destroying you.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.140
And they are ready to send your kids to mental hospitals tomorrow.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.080
You should at once try to take notice of it and think what is happening.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.480
To distribute gross material in the name of God

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.700
is what kind of generosity?

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.740
Do you not ever think about it?

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.800
In this Kaliyuga (modern times),

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:31.120
I think the man has such a penetrative intelligence and has such a wisdom.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.080
Does he sell all his wisdom that he just could not understand,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.940
that we are running like a mad after this kind of mesmerism and enlightenment!

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:44.140
And false assumptions and absolute myth within us,

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.400
which make us, believe that we are in complete peace.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.340
We are cheating with ourselves and with others also.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.880
When you are realized then you do not have to go too far,

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.260
do not have to read too much.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.520
You can understand that you are realized,

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.220
there will be a sudden peace in you.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.400
I see that there are Gurus of so many people and after reaching age of 30-40

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.160
they are dying getting heart attack.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.640
once a little bit of realization has awakened in you.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:23.280
It is impossible for you to get even an accident; no question of heart attack,

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.920
There are many incidents like this with us.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.940
Just a day before yesterday they were telling that

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.840
there was a boy who was coming in a train and the train was completely over- turned,

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.040
not a single person was injured in the compartment in which the boy was present and they all crossed over it.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.100
Deities should wander above you.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:43.200
If divine cannot come down to you then what is the use of this realization.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:49.260
Now you know our people, that how many are realized, even cancer was treated; there is nothing special about it.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:57.180
The only thing is that these people are not interested in curing.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.240
They are just interested in realization.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.380
Because the joy you have got, the same joy you want others to enjoy, spontaneously.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:10.040
If you have money, wealth then you wants to spend money to feed people.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:17.060
In the same way a realized soul wishes to awaken others and realize them and he can do it.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.200
If there is a light entered in you then there is a no need to swear in for that.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:29.620
If there is fragrance of musk then there is no need for you to take a vow that there is fragrance of musk.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.600
But who is seeking musk? This should be considered first,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.040
otherwise what is the use of wandering in such pursuits?

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:47.740
On one hand there are these people who are playing with our subconscious,

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.100
with our gross –awareness, with our past.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.320
I know these kinds of people.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.300
In this seeking I have seen many Guru Ghantals (fraud Gurus)

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.300
and I know all their tricks that what kind of condition they create

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.080
and how they destroy your kundalini for generations.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.460
I know many such people who would tell you about your previous lives

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.140
and you are mesmerized by that.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.800
Somebody just says that I’m your husband.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:25.520
A woman came to me and told me that ‘now I have given up all of me to him.’

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.620
I asked her, ‘What! Why did you give in?’

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.800
She replied ‘He told me that I’m your husband.’

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.160
I asked, ‘Your husband! You are really a big chaste woman!

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.500
If you are such a chaste that you are so much blind about your dead husband

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.240
then what about your living husband? Do you have no chastity towards him?

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.840
And the one who is a money cheater,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:49.940
to whom you have given all of your jewellery because he told you that he, is your husband.’

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.620
Somebody was telling that ‘this fellow was telling us

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.000
that I am the incarnation of God,

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.140
I am God almighty.’

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.100
What is getting lost in saying anything in this country?

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.000
It does not cost anything. We are perfect in saying lie, whatever lie can be said.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:09.160
It is called sigmoid personality in psychology.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.800
If you have read psychology then you can understand that psychologist

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.500
have also found it about these people.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.380
And if you think that they have not found then it is no true. They are big thieves.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.920
They just stand up and start telling any nonsense and people start believing in them.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.720
This has been said in the Bible that these kinds of people

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.660
will come in the world, be careful.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.900
They claim that they are God.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.600
If they are God then there must be some powers in them also.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.840
There was a gentleman who was telling me.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.520
I asked him ‘why you have such an assemblage of so many women around you?

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.940
What are you doing inside the room while keeping the doors closed?

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.340
What kind of such things are you doing in the name of God?’

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.060
Because he has tortured a woman, she was telling me in private.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.160
I told her to go to the court and pray for the arrest of this man.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.400
Then she said ‘how we can talk in the court, there will be a plague on us,

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.720
we have our respect, and we have family.’

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.020
Then I told her

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.920
‘if you would not tell it in the court then how can this man be exposed?’

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.260
Then I went to this gentleman, and asked him,

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.300
‘What are you doing? Why are you committing such a sin?

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.620
What will you get out of it in the name of God?’

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.540
Then he told me ‘You do not know that I’m Shri Krishna?’

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.500
I said ‘What a thing! Your face is that of a bhoot and you are claiming to be Shri Krishna.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.720
How come you are Shri Krishna?’ I asked him,

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:30.460
‘How much you about Shri Krishna? The one who had destroyed the Kalia (serpent devil) in just 5 years of his age,

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.220
charging on his head, where is he now?’

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.940
I told him in humor that if I just scratch your beard here

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.120
you won’t be able to get up.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.520
After that I have heard that someone got caught of his beard for half an hour

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.520
and he was kept on shaking like this. I just said it in a light way.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.580
Second gentleman started telling me that I make woman nude

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.740
because Shri Krishna also used to do the same.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.720
Just tell me what kind of nonsense is this? Shri Krishna was a child of five years old!

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.740
It was his childlike activities.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.060
How can a five year old child make women nude?

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.200
For a 5 year old boy who is elder and who is younger.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.340
He was very deep and used to do the activities of Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.600
Could he understand all this things at that age? He was not even 5 years old, less than that.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.760
Then I asked him,

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.200
‘if this was the case

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:21.140
then while living in Dwarka why did he run on occasion of Draupadi Chir Haran (tearing of clothes) taking with him Shankh,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.720
Chakra, Gada, Padam, and Garud.Why did he run?

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.420
If he had no sense of chastity of a woman then why did he run?’

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.880
On this issue that Shri Krishna (referred person) became silent.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:43.480
On one hand, there is Shri Krishna who is holding a mountain on one finger and on other hand these (fraud krishnas)

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:50.680
are just being formed in every street and market- get them where you want, whether Shri Krishna or Shivji. Where is The Lord Shiva?

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.880
350
Have you saved any amount of your intelligence or not,

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.820
I’m surprised sometimes and very much surprised because man has reached to such a level of penetrability in his intelligence,

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.580
to whom God has opened all the shell of intelligence,

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.720
then why there is curtain on the issue of religion?

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.740
Not only in this country but it is very sad to say that

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.460
that such darkness prevailing in foreign countries also.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.740
There was another yogiji;

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.440
his disciple came to meet us.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.720
He came before me, what we saw that his agnya and nabhi chakra both were rotated.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.760
And he was singing his bhajans.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.220
To rotate opposite means the person who is mad-

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.800
when you are realized then you will also see that when a man becomes mad

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.480
then his Agnya and Nabhi Chakra get oppositely turned.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.800
This ill practice of Pret vidya (knowledge of possessing a bhoot) and shamshan vidya (cemetery knowledge)

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.460
have been continuously running since long in our country.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.980
This is not the case where nobody knows about it,

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:56.360
but it is sure that in view of modern education, attention could not go that side.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.100
It is also called as Karani in Marathi.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.300
These possessed women who are often called as Devi,

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.380
can come in anyone’s body and we go to apply kumkum to them. Bhoots do enter them, why we cannot understand it?

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.500
These all are nothing but Pret vidya (knowledge of possessing a bhoot) and shamshan vidya (cemetery knowledge).

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.520
There is a big science of this field,

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.520
I will tell you about it sometime later if you wish,

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.600
but today I’m speaking at the feet of Datta Maharaj.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.960
This should be clearly understood

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:28.200
that these are symptoms of great fall that we sell ourselves in the hands of others.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.480
At least try to put your intelligence alright-

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.560
just jerk it.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:37.520
Whenever you go listen a lecture, then you just think that what this person is speaking about and what he is doing?

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.600
Try to distinguish between what he is saying and what he is doing. He just cannot be a Guru.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.640
You should understand it.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.380
If we say just now that we are this and that

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.960
and tomorrow we start getting after mundane things, then we cannot be like that.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.640
I mean to say that this world is not a useless

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.400
but a state of witness should at least come in Gurus.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:05.120
There are many Gurus who have appeared for Kundalini.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.100
You tell me about them.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.640
Yesterday also I told you that God has no watch to tell you

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.640
that at 4’0 clock I will raise your Kundalini.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.020
These are all arrangements of Bhoots.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.260
I will give you a very good example on this.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.780
There was a big doctor called Dr.Lane, who lived in London.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:28.860
He had done quite research and he wanted that people get cured through him

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:35.700
but suddenly he died in an accident therefore he could not take his research to people.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.000
So when he died – when we die,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.720
we do not die in full way, a small portion is fallen,

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.000
remaining subtle body leaves slowly –slowly.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:52.260
So he thought why not try – what it is like entering in some body.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.540
So there was a Vietnamese soldier who was fighting,

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.800
he entered in him and asked him to go to his son and tell him about such and such things.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.940
Now just think if Dr.Lane had to do it somehow

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.360
then why he did not enter in to his son?

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.700
Because he knew that there are consequences of doing this.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.080
So he said ‘Look, you narrate the whole story to my son

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.680
and he will agree to it.’

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.180
When this soldier went to meet his son then his son was convinced.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:26.680
He said ‘These things were known only to my father

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.340
and no other person know about it and so let’s open a clinic.’

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:34.180
They formed a very big organization

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.460
through which they used to cure people.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.560
Other doctors also got associated with Dr.Lane.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.580
They also do these kinds of things that are being done still now.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.020
They tell you that if you have any problem then write a letter to us

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:56.620
They tell that at 5’o clock evening something will happen inside you, someone will come in you,

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:01.320
in your psych which we call as superego.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.420
He will enter through it and work it out.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.640
They take out a bhoot and replace it with another.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.640
If there is a drunkard then his drinking will go away but he will start getting angry.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.440
This is their work.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.380
But they are simple poor fellows.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.860
Because at least they tell you that they do the work of spirit

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.440
and they do not say that we do the work of God.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.980
But in our country people just not do the work of solid bhoots

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.260
but of devils and give the name of God to it.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.320
If such types of people cure anybody to some extent,

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.020
then you can imagine what will be his state

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.000
whose kundalini is damaged, where there is an injury to our Mother.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.960
There is no need to go to any of these places.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.060
If not today, all of you become realized tomorrow

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.440
for sure but do not go to wrong path.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.620
Once your kundalini is damaged then I just cannot do anything .

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.680
The whole job will be finished.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.760
whose whose Kundalini has been wronged you know about them.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.780
Amongst you many have got realization-they know

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.980
how much difficulties we have beard upon ourselves.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.140
While we put our hand on them some of them got big-big blisters on them

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.620
- very big blisters have come out.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.800
And when they put hands towards Me

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.380
then they get small bit of blisters and many people feel burning sensation in their hands.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.160
From Me there are cool-cool breezes flowing out

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.040
but their hands are burning.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.880
I’m willing to get them established in their powers

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.840
but there is different kind of power which sitting in them.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.680
Try to save yourself from these Gurus

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.340
because there is no law to prevent it.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.600
If anyhow it has to be prevented then think from your intelligence

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.020
that who is a true Guru- the one who give you absolute.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.520
One woman asked me a question;

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.800
it was a very on spot question.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.380
She asked me if you have seen any realized souls in this world,

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.700
who are realized without coming to Уou.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.120
There have been many and they are still now.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.160
That is why I took many of my disciples to a very great Guru,

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.560
who used to live in Kolhapur, in a forest mountain.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.540
It is Gagangarh, seven miles away.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.260
I took them there.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.560
Today is an auspicious day, is a very great occasion there.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:15.760
I asked them just open your hands like this, cool-cool vibrations were coming.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.060
‘Mother, who is this person here?

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.720
Why he had gone to a forest?’

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.020
This is also a question to think that all those great people why they live in Jungles.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.040
You have mentioned about Nityananda,

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.000
he was a great person in reality.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.540
He was such a person that when anybody used to come near him

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.280
then he used to throw stones at him saying ‘get lost from here.’

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.260
The same can be said of Baba Tabbudin in our Nagpur.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.880
He was a poor guy who lived in jungle, which is now a populated area.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.280
Why these people run away to jungles?

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.840
There are few reasons.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.320
You have just seen here, there were some children sitting,

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.940
there hands were burning, and they were doing something like this.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.540
In the same way their body starts burning.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:54.140
Many poor sadhus just have to live in water,

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.060
because in your psyche, in super ego,

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.220
bhoots are sitting to burn and to torture these bhaktas.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.880
Therefore, they decide to run away to jungles.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.320
Because you don’t know what are you doing?

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.140
You don’t understand vibrations that is why

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.620
these poor people are staying in jungles to save themselves.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.980
How could they redeem themselves?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.380
Now just look at Gagangarh Maharaj,

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.620
it is true that he cured many people,

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.340
but the problem is that his fingers moved inside like a telescope and those of feet also.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.180
The poor man lives on a tree or moves on a lion.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.240
Apart from this he cannot move anywhere. But when I reached to him,

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.120
these people were with Me, he quickly recognized Me.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.480
There is no doubt about it.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.340
He has not yet seen me in this lifetime.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.500
But from many years he knew about Me.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.780
He is elder to me. He began to say,

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.960
‘Mother, I have been waiting for you for many years.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.040
Today I am so fortunate that you have come here.’

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:53.460
He is a Nagpanthi, so he is just like Macchindranath and a very great person.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:01.100
Once I went to Himalaya, there also I found a few;

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.260
the same were in Haridwar, they live in many parts.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.440
I told them the blossom time will come.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.780
I will tell you how to save your powers and how to return back

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.980
the punch of these people.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.340
I am sitting, you at least come, I will cure everybody,

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.600
I can tackle them easily.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.920
Many of them have said

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.040
‘Mother, we will come, we will come, surely.’

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.220
But poor chaps don’t have courage.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.620
Their hands and legs have been broken; they (negative people) have put blisters in them,

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.880
they have burnt them,

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.540
all this are work of devils.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:37.140
Up till now I have counted ten demons and six demoness who have come in this Kaliyuga.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.100
Nowadays, suppose Ravan comes here,

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.360
then also he will never say that he is Ravan,

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.160
he will claim himself to be God.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.720
If he will claim to be Ravan then he will be put in prison.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:53.100
The identity of Ravan is also that of the demons.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.580
That too, I am going to tell you about ,

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.720
you will be benefited.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.220
The man who has eyes like a cat-

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.660
if you see the eyes of cat then you will understand.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.180
Many people just don’t see many things.

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.720
The eyes of cat- which has an eyeball inside- pupil of eye,

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.900
as soon as you see it, it becomes small and in no time it disappears,

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.420
it is just similar to the eyes of demons.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.960
I know them quite well.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.740
I have seen them in each and every birth.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.340
You can know them through their eyes that they are demons.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.800
Their pupil of eye just become small and disappears.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.840
This is their identification.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.020
Whether you can call them God or anything else,

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.100
but they are demons.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.220
And these people have achieved many siddhis (achivements).

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.500
This is work of our bhole Shankarji, what to do?

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.060
They (demons) have achieved many siddhis.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.640
As He gave one siddhi to Ravan that when he used to speak and give lectures then something

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.100
to speak and give lectures then something used to happen on nabhi chakra (of the listener)

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.640
that a bhoot would sit there.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.620
Thousands of people were overwhelmed listening to his speeches.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:55.640
Even to this extent that nobody was ready to fight against Rama (but) he convinced all of them.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.880
Similarly Mahishasura had also siddhis.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.080
All demons have their own siddhis.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:08.940
And because of their siddhis these people always kept on suppressing goodness and light,

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.500
and kept on pouring darkness.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.740
Today in Kaliyuga, the situation is quite similar,

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.240
and you are thinking that I have only two hands.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.980
It is your work and it will happen through you people only.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.580
You will be surprised because deities are also sitting at one side and demons on other.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.080
Fierce battle is going on.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.480
Today when I see this scene- what are these troubles?

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:36.520
Is this because of your thinking?

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.100
No, not at all! This devil and demons work through the pret yoni (dead spirits)

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.100
and satiate you people so that you come running in their feet.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.160
All this is the work of these people.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.980
And if you have to defeat these people,

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.280
then you have to lit the light in you.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.300
If you want to enlighten it, then all have to lit a light within themselves.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.660
You yourself will become a light.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.800
And what is surprising is-

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.740
at this time God also wants that man should come on the stage,

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.400
man himself should work.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:16.020
A man should become Parmatma Swaroop (form of God) and becomes a superman,

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.760
there be establishment of superman.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.520
A new dimension is going to come in you.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.620
But the only thing is that you should learn to take it,

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.120
should learn to absorb it.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.100
It cannot be compared with the standard of intelligence as of now,

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.100
because if you try to understand through the intelligence,

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.040
then you can only see my hand but not un-manifested streams

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.320
which are flowing from them.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.380
Those people who are very big pandits,

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.080
if they want they should read Kabir Das, Nanak ji

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.420
and if possible also read Shankaracharya, he is the best.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.840
If you read Adi Shankaracharya then you can understand

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.920
what is this Chaitanya Lahari (Vibrations), I am talking about.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:59.020
I have not yet met anyone who has systematically said or explained about kundalini.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.780
You know that little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.360
The same can be said about kundalini,

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.300
I do not know on what basis.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.540
But still the witness state of human being is so high,

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.660
so high that

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:24.040
if you read Devi Bhagwat,

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.500
Saptashati of Markendeya Swami then

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.120
you will be surprised how deeply,

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.320
in small detail they have understood this thing.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.740
The truth is unless and until you are realized anything you do is a waste.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.880
Krishna has said the same thing.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.120
Krishna has also said the same thing that first get him within.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.720
But those who were supposed to understand it could not understand it.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.560
He was saying to get him inside and you are saying go outside to fight.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.480
He meant that you should be a witness.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.060
It is happening in akarma (inaction) it is being done through you.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:00.540
You just do not do. Ego is finished and superego is finished.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.540
The one, who is a doer, is abolished.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.740
It was this, what he was talking about, but he was not listened to.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.580
He was a diplomat.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.460
Krishna has his own Guru tattwa.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.240
His Guru tattwa is also very interesting. He was a very big politician.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:16.220
I used to call him an absolute, pure politician.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:21.920
He was such a big politician, and he knew that this is the only way to get these fools alright.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.380
When a child tries to drive a cart by attaching his horses at back

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:33.220
then his father comes and says, ‘keep whipping it, carry on, you will reach.’

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:38.500
But after getting tired when a child thinks that the horse is just not moving,

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.420
then he comes to know that first put the horse in front of the cart then whip it.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.680
Therefore he said to do karma yoga (yoga of action).

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.540
Now here you should notice the diplomacy of Krishna.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.640
It is difficult to find a Guru like Krishna.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:54.740
He is such a Guru that requires a lot of intensity and depth of intelligence.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.780
What I am going to tell you now, no one would have told you this so far, you listen to it.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.780
He said that you do the action

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.600
and leave the fruitfulness of action to God.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.780
It is just not possible, an absolute absurd condition.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:11.660
When you are doing something and you know it, then how can you leave it to someone else?

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.440
You are keeping horse at back and whipping it.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.220
Secondly, he said that, ‘you do bhakti (devotion)’.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.720
See in it, it is very beautiful. You do the Ananya bhakti (absolute devotion),

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.120
when there is no one else then how there can be devotion?

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.400
Means that when union has taken place then whom to devote?

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.500
He said, ‘Pushpam, Falam, Toyam’, whatever fruits, flowers, water you offer

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.920
I will accept it.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.400
But he has said that you should do ‘Ananya bhakti (absolute devotion)’ while giving it.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.280
This is absurd,

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:49.960
because on absurdity, the mind of man will be confused then he will come to terms.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.280
Perhaps he just did not think

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.380
that man is going to learn easily.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.240
But I am a mother and if a mother has to say something

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.320
she will just say it, so far as possible she will tear her throat to say what she has to say to her son.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.860
It is very different kind of heart of a mother,

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:14.620
she could not tolerate diplomacy- ‘it is too late, it is high time, much has been lost, there is disturbance, there is a pile of suffering.’

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.160
Now it the time has come to do this work and it is being done.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.740
You people are also achieving this thing.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.040
Those who have found it and those who have known it,

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:26.220
there is a program tomorrow; they should come tomorrow for the program .

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.760
Those who have not yet achieved it, they should also come.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.740
We have also other places- we are trying to get permanently Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan so that people can come there.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.540
There are many people here who are realized.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.860
You too can give realization just after getting it

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.760
There are people who know about chakras and have become knowledgeable

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.100
and there are some who can give realization.

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:53.640
The glory of India is that it is a Yoga Bhoomi (land of Union).

00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:00.380
Our country is the highest of all the countries of the world. The vibrations our country are highest.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.180
There is no doubt about it. And our country is the spinal cord of the entire world

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:09.500
and the place of Kundalini is also here, she can put the world alright one day.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.240
But as of now, all our Chakras are caught up.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.360
The movement of Kundalini is getting difficult.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.340
If you can get rid of your Chakras then it is possible that from this country itself

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:25.780
this message could be sent out so that the whole world can be changed and it can stand to another,

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:30.100
another path where there is call for Satyayuga,

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.220
and Satyayuga is going to come.

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.040
This is the arrival of Satyayuga.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:42.360
But now it is left on your freedom and authority whether you accept it or go for your destruction.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.180
As diseases like cancer and things like war,

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.140
all these can destroy our world.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:54.480
If you want you should take it with you and put the world in light

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.940
and if not then darkness will arrive,

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.920
if God wishes he can create thousands of conditions

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.260
thinking that an experiment has failed- such he will think.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.240
Now it is a last jump.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.200
It has to be seen that how many people dedicate themselves to it.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.580
Many-many thanks to you.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.800
Three days seminar was completed with lots of love.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.820
So many people accept this love that is why being a Mother

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.640
I thank you very much.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.320
Our many children have already worked hard day and night

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.820
and they have worked hard to redeem others, and they should keep doing this.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:36.560
I bless you all for this purpose, I take my leave by giving you blessing of my love.
