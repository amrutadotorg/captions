1
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:08,490
There has been no never such confusion in the
minds of human beings as it is today,

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,776
as to the right or wrong.
Never so much:

3
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:15,307
whatever\hwas said, "This was not good",  they would do,

4
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:17,955
knowingly that they are doing wrong.

5
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:22,121
If they\hwere good people they would say, "All right, this is good, we'll do the good".

6
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:27,739
But everybody knew\hthat this was wrong or right.
They may do it.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,448
But today, no one knows what\his wrong and what is right.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,180
Apart from wrong and right, it's much beyond that,

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,406
you have to know yourself.

10
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:42,725
Because this awareness is within us that we do not know ourselves.

11
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:45,969
We do\hnot know the absolute we live in a relative world.

12
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,655
Of this, everybody seems to be conscious.

13
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:52,540
Maybe\hin the subconscious or maybe in the unconscious.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,097
But definitely, there's a feeling in every one\hof us,

15
00:00:57,177 --> 00:00:59,694
that we do not know.

16
00:00:59,774 --> 00:01:02,460
And it's a very honest feeling.

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,825
It's a very sublime feeling that we have
to know something more.

18
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:13,410
Now when we say the word 'no' we think as if I would say, "I don't know"

19
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,158
about Derbyshire, I've never been there.

20
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:20,545
Now this means what? "I don’t know about Derbyshire".

21
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,625
What don’t I know about Derbyshire?

22
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:28,312
I can read it in the books, I can find out. I can know all the history of Derbyshire.

23
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:32,799
I can find out who were the people who, who were making beautiful porcelain here,

24
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,320
I can find out all about their history, everything I can read about it.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,886
Still, why should I say I don’t know anything about Derbyshire?

26
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,366
Because I have not been to Derbyshire before.

27
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,213
I have not been to Derby.

28
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:47,341
I have not been\hto this area I have not seen this place.

29
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,847
I have not visited it I have had no experience of this place

30
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:53,088
so I don't know about it.

31
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:56,064
This is exactly what is the situation.

32
00:01:56,144 --> 00:01:59,949
The situation is that we do not know
about the Divine.

33
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:03,200
We have read about it we have heard about it.

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,107
So many people have written about
it once they know there's an inquiry about it they come out with books.

35
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:12,574
Books after books thousands of
books they have written.

36
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:15,959
How many of them are true and how many of them are untrue?

37
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:19,080
It is impossible\hto find out.

38
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,860
Because we do not actually know.

39
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,364
Supposing somebody says that Duke of Bedford was born in Derbyshire.

40
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:29,678
All right. How will I know?

41
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:35,377
I would not know till I meet somebody who is
really belonging to that place, who knows about it.

42
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,032
In the same way, the knowledge that we have also
about Divine

43
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:44,665
is very confusing but this is not knowledge.

44
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:47,055
This is never the knowledge.

45
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:56,586
The idea\hof knowledge comes to us
as if it is a kind of an answer

46
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,978
to our inquiries which\his rational,

47
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:03,334
which we can understand\hintelligently through our intelligence.

48
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:06,305
But now this area is beyond intelligence,

49
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,437
beyond rationality.

50
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:13,706
Beyond all that\his limited, is the unlimited area

51
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,746
All such unlimited areas can be only known by
experience

52
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,438
of your awareness.

53
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:26,198
Now this one should\h\hunderstand is a very delicate thing

54
00:03:26,278 --> 00:03:30,712
how to know\hsomething
and experience of our awareness.

55
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:33,938
Not an experience they suddenly see a light. So it's an
experience.

56
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:36,188
I mean you can always see a light.

57
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:42,208
So great the people feel about it that they have seen
some light suddenly sparking before them.

58
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:46,430
Nothing so great! There could be some area, from there as sparking can come

59
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,040
and maybe it is of no use to you,

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,722
but just you might feel that you have experienced.

61
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:56,611
So, one must know that seeing is not experiencing.

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,275
For example, a dog sees this instrument [mike].

63
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,158
But what does he know about it? He sees it.

64
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:15,784
Awareness, the human awareness has so many great
things about itself

65
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:18,974
compared to the animal\hawareness.

66
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:25,590
For example, we can say the awareness of
beauty, animals don't have.

67
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,776
Awareness of cleanliness, animals don't have.

68
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,726
Human beings have these built within themselves.

69
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:42,206
They can feel it, they\hcan feel it
on their central nervous system

70
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,520
So, whatever is your awareness is to
be felt on your central nervous system.

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,183
It's not just an imaginary thing or a intellectual
discussion,

72
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:55,087
"Ah I see, yes, I know". Not that.

73
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:59,165
The knowledge should come\hto you through your feelings;

74
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,293
like I can feel this is hot or cold.

75
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:08,235
But a stone\hwill not feel anything.

76
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:12,100
In the same way, the feeling has to come through your central nervous system.

77
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,058
That means your awareness itself is to be going, has to be charged.

78
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:19,512
It has to get a new dimension.

79
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:23,120
Your awareness itself has to get a new dimension.

80
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:27,165
All other experiences has no meaning
whatsoever in evolution, if you see.

81
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:33,030
In evolutionary process, it is the awareness that
improves,

82
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,958
receives better and better dimensions.

83
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:42,589
And these dimensions have reached its maximum at
the time when you become a human being,

84
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:47,663
where your\hawareness is just ready to receive

85
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:53,487
the awareness\hof the universal Being, of the collective Being,

86
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:56,595
so that you become the collective Being.

87
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:59,838
Now\hI would like to tell you about this within\hourselves,

88
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:01,467
how we are placed.

89
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:07,773
For every practical\hpurposes,
you should not take me for granted,

90
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,255
but you should not also deny what I tell you.

91
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:15,222
It's like entering into a new University:

92
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,704
we listen to the professor and we try to
follow him.

93
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:28,747
Supposing he propounded, he propounds a hypothesis before you,

94
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:34,200
then you just\hstart judging
 it, work it out.

95
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,408
If it is true,

96
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,696
then you call it a law.

97
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:48,185
In the same way,
we should enter into this new understanding,

98
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,128
by first seeing it, not denying it.

99
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,825
Then if it is true, then we have to believe it.

100
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:58,798
There should be no blind faith about Sahaja Yoga.

101
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:01,686
Blind faith does not help at all.

102
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:04,669
Neither there should be a denial.

103
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:10,574
And with that cheerful attitude, if you just listen to Me as a hypothesis, whatever I'm telling you,

104
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:13,549
you need not accept it as truth just now.

105
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,540
But then the time has come for me
to prove the truth to you.

106
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,071
And the truth can be proved to you.

107
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,233
Time has come to prove the existence of God;

108
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:28,273
to prove, not prove that

109
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:32,331
I give you a big lecture or take you to course
or some sort of a thing like that.

110
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:36,405
But how\ham I going to prove it? On your awareness!

111
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:45,077
It is going to be absolute experience of your awareness

112
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:50,180
that\hyou are going to feel God almighty.

113
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,335
Time has come to prove the scriptures,

114
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:57,516
all the scriptures.

115
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:04,370
The time has come to prove your own connection with God,

116
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,999
your own relationship with him,

117
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,576
your own relationship with that Primordial Being,

118
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:15,033
whether you call it God or anything
I it makes no difference to God himself.

119
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:18,525
Whether you call him by any name there
is God.

120
00:08:18,605 --> 00:08:21,846
And that God is not the way you conceive God.

121
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:25,793
It's not the way you understand\hGod or you know God.

122
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:28,386
But it's the God as he is.
