1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,607
Shri Mataji (in Hindi: Sorry I am late, my granddaughter is a little sick

2
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:18,637
and I stayed back to make her better.)

3
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:24,217
First I will speak in English and then in Hindi.

4
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:38,115
Today we are going to worship Rajalakshmi,

5
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:48,766
means the Goddess which rules the kings.

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:00,196
It’s a very important thing today to understand

7
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:05,922
that something has basically gone wrong

8
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:14,511
in the working of our political systems

9
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:28,718
and why the people have lost their sense of

10
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:39,476
justice, fair play and the benevolence of the people.

11
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:47,351
Where have we gone wrong that this is being lost?

12
00:01:49,576 --> 00:02:00,514
It’s not only in India, it’s not only in Japan or in England

13
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:09,578
or any other place where we think there is democracy.

14
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:27,008
First and foremost thing is that all these countries,

15
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:32,108
even those who have got their freedom,

16
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:35,457
started following those countries

17
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,477
which were supposed to be highty and mighty and very powerful

18
00:02:40,478 --> 00:02:47,914
– like America, like Russia, like China, England –

19
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:57,652
without understanding how far they have reached

20
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:04,171
in delivering the goods that they are supposed to do.

21
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:11,514
In any case, in a country like England,

22
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,780
you see the monarchy, the way it has been working,

23
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,358
is shocking, absolutely shocking.

24
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:32,647
The way they have acted towards their ministers, like Cromwell,

25
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:42,277
you feel as if some primitive people are trying to manage something.

26
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:46,738
And the kings so cruel, queens so cruel,

27
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:52,147
so character-less, so irresponsible.

28
00:03:52,162 --> 00:04:00,686
They had no character to be kings and queens.

29
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:13,072
There was no surrendering to the Rajalakshmi principle of one’s being.

30
00:04:15,268 --> 00:04:18,756
Then of course, it became independent,

31
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:24,905
and even now I find such stupid things they’re doing.

32
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:33,145
Even in France the president has a keep,

33
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:38,733
they run after money, little money here and there.

34
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,575
There are people in every country who are really of very, very low level

35
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:55,425
and who are trying to look after the welfare of the people.

36
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:01,577
Also if you read the history of Samurai

37
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:05,623
and all those people in Japan you are shocked.

38
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,167
They thought no end of themselves,

39
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:12,568
they had no connection with the public and the way they behaved.

40
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:18,645
Then you go to the communist countries also the same sort of thing.

41
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:24,168
There also those who came in power

42
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:31,085
became really like despotic rulers.

43
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:35,154
Then we have on the other side Mr. Hitler

44
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:39,082
who came, thinking no end of himself.

45
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:45,483
Spain, as you know was ruined by Franco.

46
00:05:47,294 --> 00:05:52,295
One cannot understand how these people without any character,

47
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:58,395
without any higher qualities than the rest of the people

48
00:05:58,397 --> 00:06:01,904
can look after their well-being.

49
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:05,538
It’s impossible!

50
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:17,644
I should say in our own country we had great kings, very great,

51
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:22,389
because our heritage is great

52
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:28,084
and we had saints who really ruled the kings.

53
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:36,585
Like Shivaji had a guru who was a great saint, everybody.

54
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:39,445
Janaka had a guru.

55
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:42,995
Everybody had a guru.

56
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:45,575
Even Shri Rama had a guru.

57
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:49,085
But they were real gurus!

58
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:54,174
They were the people who really lived the life of saints,

59
00:06:54,174 --> 00:07:00,715
they were real saints, inside, outside.

60
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:15,144
And the people also accepted the kings who had spiritual background.

61
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:17,565
Those who respected spiritual people.

62
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:26,625
So, the whole trend in this country was very, very different

63
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,555
till sometime.

64
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:37,915
I don’t know when the English came what happened to them.

65
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,375
The majority of the people didn’t like

66
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:47,435
the way the English were living, their style, their methods,

67
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:50,044
they didn’t appreciate.

68
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:54,565
But these king and queens of different states

69
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:59,975
they started feeling that they are very sophisticated people

70
00:07:59,975 --> 00:08:02,815
and we should have their culture.

71
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,825
And so many of these queens, modern ones,

72
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:14,715
who smoke, who drink, tell Me that it was taught by their governess

73
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:25,095
who came either from Sweden or from England or from Australia.

74
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:28,075
And they picked up these things.

75
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:31,825
Of course the men also thought that we are very backward, you see,

76
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:34,805
that’s the idea they gave them, “You are very backward people,

77
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:39,675
you don’t know how to smoke, you don’t know how to drink,

78
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:42,585
you have no ballroom dancing,” this that.

79
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:47,015
Even our military got corrupted with it.

80
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:49,645
In the military

81
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:52,645
is all English style things still going on.

82
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:55,285
I don’t know when will they stop.

83
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,145
They don’t know anything about our own country.

84
00:08:58,145 --> 00:09:01,115
They’ll know about England,

85
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:04,775
and you ask them anything about England they’ll know.

86
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:09,815
The whole education system came through English,

87
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:16,845
but all about England and western life than about Indian life.

88
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:22,735
Nobody ever cared for Indian things, you see.

89
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:25,955
Even in medicine same thing happened.

90
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:30,445
Nobody wanted to listen to any vaidya (ayurveda) or anyone.

91
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:40,265
They thought “Oh, these are useless primitive people, backward!”

92
00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:44,405
So even one country, which was really, I should say,

93
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:57,285
had spirituality ruling in the politics also went down like this.

94
00:09:57,285 --> 00:10:02,805
Before independence in this country, I remember,

95
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:07,425
we had to fight the British,

96
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:13,485
and what patriotism people had at that time.

97
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:19,075
I remember once we had gone to see a hockey match,

98
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:23,555
and My father always had a national flag on it,

99
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:26,915
that time it was not national it was congress flag, in the car.

100
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:30,475
So the soldiers came, they said, “Take down this flag!”

101
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:33,625
So My driver got down he said,

102
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:37,945
“You cut my throat first and then you take down the flag!”.

103
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:49,335
We all children joined him and they were shocked, went back.

104
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:54,775
Such enthusiasm, such patriotism came at that time

105
00:10:54,775 --> 00:11:04,455
when we were fighting these people.

106
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,975
But they divided us and created a problem for us.

107
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:14,135
And you know before we could enjoy any fruits of our freedom,

108
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:21,705
we were fighting, we were divided.

109
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:26,245
I don’t know whom to blame for that.

110
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:29,595
If we had not accepted this division,

111
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:34,455
there would have been no problem.

112
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:35,665
But they accepted it.

113
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:39,225
Now, poor Bangladeshi’s are so, so, so poor.

114
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:46,855
If they were one with India, they would have been much better.

115
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:47,935
And what is Pakistan?

116
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:50,705
It’s just an empty place, you know,

117
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:52,555
no industries, nothing.

118
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:57,045
That’s why they are all the time talking about Kashmir, Kashmir.

119
00:11:57,045 --> 00:11:58,475
They have nothing else!

120
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:05,345
[In] their own country people are having fights, this that, but there’s no growth.

121
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:09,045
Now they cut out only this India.

122
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:20,295
Now here, after all this happening, you know, any war,

123
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:27,565
any kind of crisis like that, immediately changes the value system.

124
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:31,355
Not that in the West there were no value systems, there were,

125
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:39,385
but the war completely changed them in the same way in India also.

126
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:44,965
Politicians, those who lost their lives in the fights,

127
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:53,575
or those who stood for something good were regarded as no ideal.

128
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:58,445
And people took a U-turn, absolutely a U-turn

129
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:02,245
and they became very self-centred,

130
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:06,485
only worried about their own personal things, their families,

131
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:13,275
or maybe accumulation of money and

132
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,895
transferring of money from here to Switzerland.

133
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:20,935
I mean something, I mean I tell you I’ve gone through My life

134
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:25,965
with the people who were fighting, fighting for freedom.

135
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:32,425
I mean they could not even think of these things.

136
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:36,065
I know My father, I know My mother, I know their friends,

137
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:41,265
I know so many people who were in our family used to come,

138
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:47,535
so many Sikhs and so many other people, Muslims even.

139
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:53,635
They could not think of taking any money,

140
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:59,965
I mean it was really regarded as very low-level.

141
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:09,355
For what to take?

142
00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:13,675
What is the need?

143
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:19,385
If you are satisfied in your heart of what you wanted, you got,

144
00:14:19,385 --> 00:14:22,475
you’ve got your freedom, now finished.

145
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:28,135
But how these people who were absolutely at the bottom,

146
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:31,795
who did nothing for the country,

147
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:34,835
sacrificed nothing for the country,

148
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:43,845
just came up on top and all the good people went down.

149
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:51,415
If you read the history of Shivaji,

150
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:56,545
or Rana Pratap, or any of them, Shalivahana, anyone,

151
00:14:56,545 --> 00:15:03,475
you’ll be surprised how they used to worship Shakti.

152
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:09,395
All the Kshatriyas used to worship Shakti,

153
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:13,285
and they would go up to a point and not beyond.

154
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:17,425
Up to the point till the dharma was there.

155
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:20,935
That history I cannot repeat it to you.

156
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:28,045
But in the subtle way, one feels that

157
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:35,455
this partition suddenly changed the attitude of people,

158
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:43,055
or I should say those who were very low-level they came up.

159
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:49,755
I remember I was here at that time, partition time,

160
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:59,565
and I was married and three people came to Me.

161
00:15:59,565 --> 00:16:02,705
I was sitting outside in the garden,

162
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:05,485
knitting something for My child because I was pregnant.

163
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:11,315
So they came, and they looked at Me and they said,

164
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:17,315
“Can we have one room in your house?”

165
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:19,615
I said, “Why not, I’ve got it.

166
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:22,215
It’s a very big house of My father.

167
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:26,725
I’ll give it to you.”

168
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:31,035
They said, “We need for one or two months.

169
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:32,035
We are refugees.”

170
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:33,035
I said “Alright, and it has an outside door,

171
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:36,115
you need not bother us and there’s also kitchen attached

172
00:16:36,115 --> 00:16:37,415
and a bathroom attached.

173
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:40,204
You can do whatever you like.”

174
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:43,085
Just I offered.

175
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:48,295
In the evening My brother came, elder brother, and My husband

176
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:55,145
and both of them were friends and he just started shouting at Me.

177
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:56,585
These people were in the other room.

178
00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:59,245
“What do you mean by keeping such people?

179
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:00,245
Who are they?

180
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:02,785
What will they do?” and this and that.

181
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:06,565
I said, “What will they do?”

182
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:08,825
“They may steal something from me!”

183
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:12,135
“So what is there in this house to steal?

184
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:18,195
They are refugees, look nice people to Me.

185
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:22,145
I have approved them because of vibrations they’re alright.”

186
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:25,735
“No, no, no, no, no better throw them away!”

187
00:17:25,735 --> 00:17:29,955
I said, Look at these people [my husband and brother],

188
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:34,185
“Without even talking to them, knowing them, suddenly

189
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:42,265
you are asking them to get out only because they are refugees.”

190
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:47,635
Then I did feel that in this country a new wave had started,

191
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:53,725
that a person is not respected if he has no money,

192
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:58,055
he’s not trusted if you have no money.

193
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:00,495
Actually it is the other way round,

194
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:04,085
those who have money, you better never trust them.

195
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:07,635
And those who don’t have money are much more honest people

196
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:10,985
in this country than the people who have money,

197
00:18:10,985 --> 00:18:16,825
who are all cheats practically.

198
00:18:16,825 --> 00:18:20,095
So it happened like this and I said,

199
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:22,035
“No they are going to stay here!”

200
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,685
I put down My foot.

201
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:29,785
I said, “This house My father has given Me

202
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:32,145
and they are going to stay here.”

203
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:39,355
Poor things they stayed for a month in a very,

204
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:44,455
I think, must be very much embarrassed.

205
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:49,565
And while they were there so many Sikhs,

206
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:54,295
that time it was a big organisation – Sikhs and RSS were one,

207
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:56,985
and they came to My house and said,

208
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:59,415
“We’ve heard there’s a Muslim staying with you.”

209
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:00,815
There was a Muslim.

210
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:04,045
“And we’re going to kill that Muslim.”

211
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:08,825
I said, “What makes you think there’s a Muslim?”

212
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:10,425
“We’ve got reports.”

213
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:15,205
I said, “Wrong, there’s no Muslim in the house.”

214
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:21,055
I told him a lie.

215
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:24,965
So they said, “How are we to believe you?”

216
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:28,555
I said, “See I’m wearing a thing (bindi).

217
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:30,415
I am a Hindu lady.

218
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:32,305
How will I keep a Muslim in my house?

219
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:39,275
We’re all frightened of them and there’s no one like that.”

220
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:41,615
Somehow or other they believed Me.

221
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:45,795
I told a complete lie but they believed Me.

222
00:19:45,795 --> 00:19:54,335
They had brought lots of those swords, with blood.

223
00:19:54,335 --> 00:20:04,245
But I was not afraid and I told them in a very determined manner.

224
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,855
Anybody else in My place would have said,

225
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:15,775
“Alright, alright there is one you can take away.”

226
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:22,055
Then these three persons, who were there, left My house

227
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:27,605
and one of them is a very famous actress,

228
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:30,775
another one is a very famous poet

229
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:34,525
and another one is a very, very famous writer.

230
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,875
And it so happened that

231
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:43,785
they (a charitable organisation) wanted to make a film about young people

232
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:49,855
and I was the chairman of that, vice chairman of that,

233
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:52,025
and they wanted to call this actress.

234
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:55,465
I said, “Don’t tell her My name.”

235
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:58,695
Because I had lost her completely.

236
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:02,255
I’d just said let it be wherever they are, let them be.

237
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:05,175
There’s no, sort of, I never made any enquiries or anything.

238
00:21:05,175 --> 00:21:06,405
“Don’t tell them My name.”

239
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:07,405
They said “Why?”

240
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:15,865
I said, “For some reason you just don’t tell her My name,

241
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:19,145
otherwise she’ll be compelled to say yes, which I don’t want.”

242
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:22,355
So when they went to her and asked her,

243
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:26,635
she said, “I must get a sari, I must get a chappal,

244
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:30,065
I must get a purse to match, I must get this,

245
00:21:30,065 --> 00:21:32,775
all this you have to pay, plus so much money you’ll have to pay.”

246
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:34,935
They said, “Ours is a charitable.”

247
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,465
She said, “Whatever it is.”

248
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:42,025
I said, “Alright, give her whatever she asks for.”

249
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:47,865
Then I went for the opening ceremony and she saw Me

250
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:53,075
and she couldn’t control herself, tears started rolling down her.

251
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:55,145
Just came and fell at My feet.

252
00:21:55,145 --> 00:22:01,065
She said, “How are you here after such a long time?”

253
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:05,135
So they said, “She’s the one who’s making this film.”

254
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:06,135
“What?

255
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:12,615
She’s making this film, why didn’t you tell me?

256
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:13,615
My God, my God.”

257
00:22:13,615 --> 00:22:16,645
She couldn’t help it, she was crying, crying, crying, crying.

258
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:18,195
I said, “Now it’s alright.”

259
00:22:18,195 --> 00:22:20,415
She said, “You take money from me.

260
00:22:20,415 --> 00:22:23,015
I’ll pay for the whole making of the film.

261
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:24,755
You don’t know this lady.

262
00:22:24,755 --> 00:22:26,145
You don’t know her.

263
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:30,565
What She’s done for me, nobody would do [what] she had done.”

264
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:36,985
She said, “She never told us anything how are we to know?”

265
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:40,635
Such a change that she, immediately she telephoned to her husband

266
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:44,635
and to this great poet, they all came running and they all…

267
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:52,375
But a small good gesture of administration:

268
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:58,825
that was My house given to Me by My father.

269
00:22:58,825 --> 00:23:02,595
That time of course My husband and My brother

270
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:10,475
didn’t know how to trust people.

271
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:12,865
But I trusted them, fully.

272
00:23:12,865 --> 00:23:18,245
They were saying, “They will cut your throat.”

273
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:19,245
“Why?

274
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:21,555
Why will they cut My throat?

275
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:24,735
For what?”

276
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:27,335
All kinds of funny things they were thinking.

277
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:30,535
And the worst thing I felt was

278
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:38,255
they were afraid because they had no money.

279
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:43,385
That is the beginning of the end, I think.

280
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:49,815
In our country this struggle for money started after that.

281
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:54,775
Without money people started suffering very much.

282
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:58,645
Poor people don’t mind because they are used to it.

283
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:03,385
Whatever money they have, they eat it and sleep off.

284
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:08,205
There were not also very, very poor people as they are today

285
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:11,335
but they were poor people no doubt.

286
00:24:11,335 --> 00:24:15,375
But what I realised at that moment,

287
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:21,535
that the people who have any position or any power or anything

288
00:24:21,535 --> 00:24:30,295
are literally frightened of everybody else.

289
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:34,945
This is the beginning of our downfall.

290
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:40,745
We got frightened.

291
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:44,835
Those who were in charge got frightened

292
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:54,045
that I may lose my seat or I may lose my money, I may lose my power.

293
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:59,375
That fright kept them absolutely mad.

294
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:05,425
Supposing I am left with no money.

295
00:25:05,425 --> 00:25:07,155
So what?

296
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:08,885
What happens?

297
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:15,895
All these thoughts started coming after that partition, I felt it’s everywhere.

298
00:25:15,895 --> 00:25:21,115
While I’ll tell you in My childhood,

299
00:25:21,115 --> 00:25:23,845
My father never used to lock the house, it was a very big house

300
00:25:23,845 --> 00:25:26,085
he never use to lock.

301
00:25:26,085 --> 00:25:28,105
And we had a very beautiful gramophone

302
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:32,285
will all that horn sort of a thing.

303
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:39,205
And one day one thief came and stole that.

304
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:44,135
So next day we discovered, My father said,

305
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:48,715
“Poor thing, he was fond of music so he’s taken away doesn’t matter,

306
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:52,555
but he didn’t take the records now what will he use,

307
00:25:52,555 --> 00:25:55,115
he must have records.”

308
00:25:55,115 --> 00:25:56,766
So My Mother started teasing him,

309
00:25:56,766 --> 00:25:58,895
“Alright you advertise now.

310
00:25:58,895 --> 00:26:02,015
The one who has stolen our gramophone

311
00:26:02,015 --> 00:26:07,005
should come and take the records they are available for him.”

312
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:10,245
It’s so natural you know.

313
00:26:10,245 --> 00:26:13,425
He just felt [that] we have money after all,

314
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:15,885
this fellow doesn’t have money

315
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:22,525
and he wants to listen to music you see.

316
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:25,445
So My father said, ‘Alright’.

317
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:26,925
Otherwise he was a criminal lawyer

318
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:30,115
My father knew law very well.

319
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:32,895
Was not a stupid fool

320
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:38,845
but he couldn’t understand this fellow has only taken gramophone only

321
00:26:38,845 --> 00:26:40,125
without the records.

322
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,125
He said,

323
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:45,335
“he must not have found it, you see it was there kept and all that.”

324
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:51,995
My Mother said, “You better advertise it.”

325
00:26:51,995 --> 00:26:55,945
He was a politician also.

326
00:26:55,945 --> 00:27:02,395
So that time, the feeling among the politician was to

327
00:27:02,395 --> 00:27:06,395
how to raise the standard of these people

328
00:27:06,395 --> 00:27:15,314
who are not having what we are having.

329
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:23,825
All the people who had money donated lavishly to so many things.

330
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:28,735
I mean in My place there was one Rahbahadur Lakshminarayan,

331
00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:36,285
he donated all his money, everything, to a big university.

332
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:39,585
Most of the things that happened in those days

333
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:43,815
were done by charity people.

334
00:27:43,815 --> 00:27:47,155
I mean they never thought our children should have so much money,

335
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:49,875
crores and crores and crores.

336
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:52,605
They never thought like that.

337
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:58,615
Whatever limited money they had they wanted to donate

338
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:01,505
and do something good for others.

339
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:08,015
So when the Rajalakshmi, Lakshmi that is the one responsible

340
00:28:08,015 --> 00:28:12,735
for looking after the benevolence of the people,

341
00:28:12,735 --> 00:28:18,965
when She acts people think that they have,

342
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:22,455
not even think, they do it, automatically,

343
00:28:22,455 --> 00:28:27,025
that they are there for benevolence.

344
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:30,035
They don’t have to tell themselves,

345
00:28:30,035 --> 00:28:35,845
it’s just that they feel that it is their job,

346
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:39,645
this is what they have to do, is to look after the people

347
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:44,695
they are to be brought to better levels of life.

348
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:51,265
This is what they think, they don’t think like a party politics,

349
00:28:51,265 --> 00:29:01,345
who is coming up, whom to kill, nothing of the kind!

350
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:05,195
Under the influence of the Goddess of Lakshmi,

351
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:15,175
which rules the political side we can say, the kingdoms and all that

352
00:29:15,175 --> 00:29:22,635
– first thing is generosity, first thing is generosity.

353
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:30,535
For example, Mahavira was meditating and while coming out His cloth

354
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:34,325
– He had one cloth around His body, dhoti and He had covered himself.

355
00:29:34,325 --> 00:29:42,745
And the upper cloth just got caught up in the bushes.

356
00:29:42,745 --> 00:29:45,135
So he cut it out and came out with half the cloth

357
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:47,925
– it was in His own palace.

358
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:53,095
So Shri Krishna wanted to take His test.

359
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:57,985
He said, “See I have no clothes, I’m just naked.”

360
00:29:57,985 --> 00:30:01,615
He came before Him like a beggar.

361
00:30:01,615 --> 00:30:05,215
“You have this, why don’t you give Me this cloth?

362
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:08,305
You can go to your palace and wear your dress.”

363
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:09,525
He said, “Alright.”

364
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:16,235
He took it out and gave it to him.

365
00:30:16,235 --> 00:30:20,045
And then He got some leaves and all that, covered Himself,

366
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:22,035
went to His palace and got dressed.

367
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:29,115
But now these Jains, you know, they make His statue so big,

368
00:30:29,115 --> 00:30:30,985
insult Him completely

369
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:44,855
by showing all kinds of nonsensical private parts to the details.

370
00:30:44,855 --> 00:30:53,934
This is what is, where you have no worshipping of the Goddess.

371
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:56,345
Goddess is Shri Shobha!

372
00:30:56,345 --> 00:31:01,175
She’s the One who decorates you.

373
00:31:01,175 --> 00:31:04,575
She’s a mother.

374
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:06,165
She decorates you with ornaments,

375
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:09,215
She decorates you with beautiful clothes, She’s your mother.

376
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:12,395
She does it!

377
00:31:12,395 --> 00:31:19,665
Like, Raja Janaka, He was the king so

378
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:27,804
He had to wear ornaments, He had to wear beautiful clothes,

379
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:29,355
He had to do everything.

380
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,355
And when Nachiketa went to Him

381
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:34,635
he was quite surprised that why my guru has sent him to this king

382
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:38,005
who is wearing all kind of dresses and this and that and

383
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:41,755
he also had a big function of dancing and this.

384
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:47,585
He said, “He’s not a saint so why my guru touches His feet?

385
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:52,515
He’s a king.”

386
00:31:52,515 --> 00:32:00,395
Of course Raja Janaka knew what he was thinking about.

387
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:02,605
He said, “Why have you come here Nachiketa?”

388
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:06,255
He said, “I’m here to get my Self-realisation.”

389
00:32:06,255 --> 00:32:10,615
He said, “You can take all My kingdom

390
00:32:10,615 --> 00:32:14,205
but not easy to give you Self-realisation.”

391
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:21,215
He said, “Alright, whatever you say I’ll do.”

392
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:29,355
So He put a big sword on his head and asked him to sleep.

393
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:35,285
He couldn’t sleep at all.

394
00:32:35,285 --> 00:32:36,745
Then they were having a bath,

395
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:39,425
he said, “Come and have bath in the river.”

396
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:45,745
People came and told that there’s fire and everybody’s running away

397
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:47,835
and Raja Janaka was in His meditative mood,

398
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:50,535
He was just sitting quietly.

399
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:53,235
Nachiketa got a little upset.

400
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:55,545
Then they said, “The fire is coming here

401
00:32:55,545 --> 00:32:58,314
and all these cloths are going to be burnt.”

402
00:32:58,314 --> 00:33:08,645
So Nachiketa ran out to save his things but still He was meditating.

403
00:33:08,645 --> 00:33:13,465
Then they came out and Nachiketa found

404
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:16,934
that nothing that was burnt was there.

405
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:20,865
It was just an illusion for people.

406
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:25,895
He was amazed.

407
00:33:25,895 --> 00:33:30,434
Then he realised what was wrong with him,

408
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:36,285
that he was doubting the Divine power Itself.

409
00:33:36,285 --> 00:33:41,545
The one who was Janaka, who was a king,

410
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:45,495
was not bothered about His own powers, these are what?

411
00:33:45,495 --> 00:33:48,525
Because he is today, this you have to do it.

412
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:52,975
Because I’m married, I have to wear a mangalsutra.

413
00:33:52,975 --> 00:33:57,795
So this is for the parampara, for the tradition style,

414
00:33:57,795 --> 00:34:13,755
but inside He was a saint, a very high…high level of saintliness.

415
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:24,555
When this thing happens that you get some position,

416
00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:29,255
any power, even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised.

417
00:34:29,255 --> 00:34:36,885
If somebody becomes leader, I don’t know what happens to him.

418
00:34:36,885 --> 00:34:37,885
It is a myth.

419
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:40,735
There’s nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga, nothing like that.

420
00:34:40,735 --> 00:34:44,315
It’s just a myth.

421
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:51,985
But suddenly people jump up.

422
00:34:51,985 --> 00:34:58,374
It is ego that gets pampered.

423
00:34:58,374 --> 00:35:07,885
But this ego can be easily managed if you worship the Rajalakshmi.

424
00:35:07,885 --> 00:35:11,495
She is the giver of balance.

425
00:35:11,495 --> 00:35:26,255
Firstly, She rides on the elephant.

426
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:29,915
Is not easy for a lady to climb on an elephant,

427
00:35:29,915 --> 00:35:35,105
I have done it, it’s not easy.

428
00:35:35,105 --> 00:35:37,735
Without fear.

429
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:50,855
And She sits straight with a complete balanced attitude.

430
00:35:50,855 --> 00:35:56,175
And Her blessings are tremendous.

431
00:35:56,175 --> 00:36:11,495
The first blessing one gets: the imbibement of dignity.

432
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:16,955
Dignity of a king, dignity of a queen.

433
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:25,475
You are a queen, so you can’t behave like street women.

434
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:35,655
With Her blessing, first of all, you get that dignity.

435
00:36:35,655 --> 00:36:45,135
That dignity is full of love, love for others.

436
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:47,525
That personality emits nothing

437
00:36:47,525 --> 00:36:54,585
but love and benevolence for others, nothing else.

438
00:36:54,585 --> 00:37:02,935
Wherever She looks, in every glance She blesses people.

439
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:05,945
She doesn’t expect anything.

440
00:37:05,945 --> 00:37:11,315
She is a queen, what can you give to the queen?

441
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:15,875
She’s the highest of all in every way,

442
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,545
what can you give it to Her?

443
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:21,805
These, all these politicians and all these so-called presidents

444
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:23,025
of all these countries are beggars.

445
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:30,165
All the time give me this, give me this,

446
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,565
like greedy people going around are beggars!

447
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:41,005
They are not the people who can rule.

448
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:47,435
Hankering after things.

449
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:54,055
So first thing is the sign, is that such a person has a personality

450
00:37:54,055 --> 00:38:01,124
that just blesses people, thinks of their benevolence,

451
00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:07,045
cares for each and every person who comes along.

452
00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:16,745
This is a blessing of the Goddess.

453
00:38:16,745 --> 00:38:21,085
Then the second blessing of the Goddess

454
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:27,745
is that you develop a kind of a temperament,

455
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:36,675
which is very dignified, but also very humorous

456
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:42,815
and understanding what other people are like.

457
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:53,055
There’s a story of a king who was going on a horse

458
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:54,185
and he met a drunkard.

459
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:56,535
So you can say

460
00:38:56,535 --> 00:39:01,275
these our drunkard can be compared to our politicians.

461
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:04,775
So the drunkard stopped.

462
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:08,665
He said, “I want to buy your horse.”

463
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:11,265
People said, “Do you know what he is?”

464
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,075
“Yeah I know he’s a king.

465
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:14,075
Alright.

466
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:15,075
So what?

467
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:16,075
I want to buy his horse.”

468
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:21,255
He said, “Alright not today, tomorrow we’ll sell the horse to you.”

469
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:22,315
So went away.

470
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:24,085
Next day he was called.

471
00:39:24,085 --> 00:39:28,065
So he came with folded hands bent down.

472
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:33,245
He said, “What, you were the one who was going to buy my horse,

473
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,945
what has happened to you?

474
00:39:34,945 --> 00:39:38,395
I want to sell it to you.”

475
00:39:38,395 --> 00:39:46,785
He said, “Sir, the one who wanted to buy is dead.

476
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:49,515
I am an ordinary person.”

477
00:39:49,515 --> 00:40:10,655
Such a personality, such solid personality I should say,

478
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:14,135
that anybody would have been angry, would have said

479
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:15,175
“Beat this man!

480
00:40:15,175 --> 00:40:16,205
Throw him away!

481
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,955
He talks to me like this,

482
00:40:17,955 --> 00:40:23,131
behaves like this.”

483
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:28,787
What the king said was remarkable.

484
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:37,676
Because he knew he’s drunk, he knew he’s not in his senses,

485
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:42,597
that’s why he’s talking.

486
00:40:42,597 --> 00:40:44,557
Didn’t get angry with him,

487
00:40:44,557 --> 00:40:47,597
he said, “Alright, come along tomorrow, I’ll sell you the horse.”

488
00:40:47,597 --> 00:40:51,627
That’s only possible if you have this Rajalakshmi in you

489
00:40:51,627 --> 00:40:55,197
otherwise you would never behave like this.

490
00:40:55,197 --> 00:41:01,487
Now what about today’s politicians anywhere?

491
00:41:01,487 --> 00:41:05,477
They even shoot people, they kill people,

492
00:41:05,477 --> 00:41:07,767
they arrest them,they put them into trouble I mean,

493
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:21,397
all kinds of things they are doing.

494
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:28,717
Such people have no right to call anybody as criminals!

495
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:31,437
But we accept!

496
00:41:31,437 --> 00:41:36,186
As in Hindi we say, “Aaj kal ka zamana hai aisa.”

497
00:41:36,186 --> 00:41:38,007
(Such is todays world)

498
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:46,897
We accept it – all such people as our rulers.

499
00:41:46,897 --> 00:41:54,247
Then Rajalakshmi is the one who stands on dharma.

500
00:41:54,247 --> 00:41:56,277
She stands on dharma.

501
00:41:56,277 --> 00:42:08,697
If there is some adharmi then she will not bless that person.

502
00:42:08,697 --> 00:42:16,597
Adharmi is to be taken out.

503
00:42:16,597 --> 00:42:29,137
But if he’s not, then he will go all out to save that person.

504
00:42:29,137 --> 00:42:36,707
But if he finds he’s adharmi, he will not.

505
00:42:36,707 --> 00:42:44,097
Is a kind of a divine discretion he should have

506
00:42:44,097 --> 00:42:52,157
as to whom to be kind and whom to be punishing.

507
00:42:52,157 --> 00:42:58,307
That divine discretion should be there in a person,

508
00:42:58,307 --> 00:43:01,597
otherwise you can play into the hands of ten people

509
00:43:01,597 --> 00:43:12,487
who are around you, teaching you something, doing something.

510
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:19,227
One day I was in My mother’s place Nandgaon,

511
00:43:19,227 --> 00:43:24,187
and there was one gentleman who impressed our Yogi very much.

512
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:25,807
I just kept quiet.

513
00:43:25,807 --> 00:43:34,557
He was a big politician and he told Me,

514
00:43:34,557 --> 00:43:38,987
“We have to do like this and we have to do.”

515
00:43:38,987 --> 00:43:40,847
I said, “Alright, alright, alright.”

516
00:43:40,847 --> 00:43:46,957
Then three, four professors from the university came to tell Me,

517
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:50,747
“Mother, he’s a politician, be very careful.

518
00:43:50,747 --> 00:43:54,367
He’s a very bad man, you be careful about him.”

519
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:56,787
I said, “What do you know about him?”

520
00:43:56,787 --> 00:43:58,657
They said, “He’s a politician.”

521
00:43:58,657 --> 00:44:00,557
I said, “There are so many politicians.”

522
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,177
“But he’s not a good man.”

523
00:44:02,177 --> 00:44:04,357
“But what do you mean?”

524
00:44:04,357 --> 00:44:07,077
I said, “Now you sit down and I’ll tell you.

525
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:10,947
This man has eloped with the wife of a Brahmin.

526
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:19,166
He himself is not a Brahmin and this child is from him to her

527
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:24,577
and how much he has deceived people everything I know.”

528
00:44:24,577 --> 00:44:25,577
They were shocked.

529
00:44:25,577 --> 00:44:26,577
“You know Mother?”

530
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:28,917
“Of course.

531
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:32,937
I know everything!”

532
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:43,247
“Then why do You allow him to come close to You?”

533
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:46,777
“Do you think he is close to Me?”

534
00:44:46,777 --> 00:44:52,317
I said, “You are sadly mistaken.

535
00:44:52,317 --> 00:44:56,797
But it’s nice he’s come to Me

536
00:44:56,797 --> 00:45:01,457
because he’s been troubling people too much and I’ll correct him.”

537
00:45:01,457 --> 00:45:05,537
While some people thought he was a great achievement we have got,

538
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:08,577
and some of them came to tell Me be careful of this man

539
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:15,717
without knowing what he was.

540
00:45:15,717 --> 00:45:20,697
This kind of a divine discretion has to be there.

541
00:45:20,697 --> 00:45:24,757
If a king does not have that divine discretion

542
00:45:24,757 --> 00:45:37,657
then he can punish the good and he may help the bad people.

543
00:45:37,657 --> 00:45:41,727
But this divine discretion disappears when you are self-centred.

544
00:45:41,727 --> 00:45:45,597
That’s the main point, is a complete detachment

545
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:49,186
about the power should be there.

546
00:45:49,186 --> 00:45:51,097
Complete detachment.

547
00:45:51,097 --> 00:45:54,347
Why should Rajalakshmi care for anything?

548
00:45:54,347 --> 00:45:59,627
What does She get?

549
00:45:59,627 --> 00:46:01,557
But now there are some who’ll pamper a person

550
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:04,037
this, this and that, and then they feel

551
00:46:04,037 --> 00:46:10,277
“ah, we’re on top of the world!”

552
00:46:10,277 --> 00:46:14,097
They just pamper, pamper and pamper

553
00:46:14,097 --> 00:46:21,547
the ego of a politician and he thinks he is a very big man,

554
00:46:21,547 --> 00:46:29,577
then in the election he doesn’t understand why he’s on the ground.

555
00:46:29,577 --> 00:46:40,317
So with this self-dignity, self-knowledge, you know what you are.

556
00:46:40,317 --> 00:46:42,577
Whatever you may tell Me, whatever you may say to Me,

557
00:46:42,577 --> 00:46:46,527
I’ll listen, “Alright, alright, alright”,

558
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:53,477
but I don’t accept anything as something great.

559
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:59,887
Because if I am that, what is there to be great?

560
00:46:59,887 --> 00:47:05,597
Now supposing this is a lamp here.

561
00:47:05,597 --> 00:47:07,787
So is it great or not great?

562
00:47:07,787 --> 00:47:08,897
It is a lamp.

563
00:47:08,897 --> 00:47:22,197
So if I’m Adi Shakti, I’m Adi Shakti, So what?

564
00:47:22,197 --> 00:47:26,607
If you are a king you are a king so what?

565
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:31,347
I mean if you are an impostor then you might feel your ego.

566
00:47:31,347 --> 00:47:37,807
But if you are really the king then you won’t feel.

567
00:47:37,807 --> 00:47:44,727
If you are under the influence of the Goddess

568
00:47:44,727 --> 00:47:50,037
then that is the only thing you enjoy.

569
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:54,947
The rest of it is nothing.

570
00:47:54,947 --> 00:47:59,727
Whether you have diamonds or you have silver

571
00:47:59,727 --> 00:48:11,317
or you have anything makes no difference at all.

572
00:48:11,317 --> 00:48:17,027
Now how people misuse the scriptures also one should see.

573
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:22,457
That, Rajalakshmi is sitting on the elephant alright,

574
00:48:22,457 --> 00:48:27,577
so they should have all very big cars, you see.

575
00:48:27,577 --> 00:48:33,477
She’s sitting on the elephant because elephant is the highest animal!

576
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:40,897
Is very kind, very forgiving and has such a tremendous memory.

577
00:48:40,897 --> 00:48:47,967
That’s why She’s sitting on an elephant.

578
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:54,877
She’s not sitting there to show off.

579
00:48:54,877 --> 00:49:01,357
But She’s sitting there to see around, what is happening

580
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:10,007
avalokan, She can see around what is happening, to be at a higher place.

581
00:49:10,007 --> 00:49:19,676
That’s why a king is made to sit on a higher pedestal.

582
00:49:19,676 --> 00:49:23,617
But the purpose is not to show off.

583
00:49:23,617 --> 00:49:26,676
But the purpose is

584
00:49:26,676 --> 00:49:33,156
that from that state he can see others better,

585
00:49:33,156 --> 00:49:43,176
he can be watchful of others.

586
00:49:43,176 --> 00:49:45,487
If somebody gets a high position

587
00:49:45,487 --> 00:49:55,817
then they think they are the owners of that position.

588
00:49:55,817 --> 00:50:07,037
This has all come because the brain has gone upside down I think.

589
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:11,147
How can it be?

590
00:50:11,147 --> 00:50:13,067
Logically?

591
00:50:13,067 --> 00:50:20,936
Now if you are this throne is given, alright, so with the throne

592
00:50:20,936 --> 00:50:29,287
I sit on this, but this throne cannot give Me anything,

593
00:50:29,287 --> 00:50:35,117
I can give something to this throne.

594
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:39,397
The king has to think he is obliging all these things th

595
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:44,117
at he is sitting on them because he is a king.

596
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:49,057
On the contrary he thinks all these things are important because something is lacking

597
00:50:49,057 --> 00:50:53,387
in him or what?

598
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:57,357
And that’s why when they come to do Raj

599
00:50:57,357 --> 00:51:02,457
they start gathering things which are useless absolutely,

600
00:51:02,457 --> 00:51:09,947
clutter up their houses, homes, everything with something that is useless.

601
00:51:09,947 --> 00:51:18,197
All their dignity, everything, is itself a decoration on them

602
00:51:18,197 --> 00:51:20,176
and to show that they are kings.

603
00:51:20,176 --> 00:51:22,507
Of course they are given a crown,

604
00:51:22,507 --> 00:51:28,847
they are given a big necklace, they are to wear something here

605
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:29,847
because they are kings.

606
00:51:29,847 --> 00:51:39,597
But these are not actually his decorations

607
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:46,257
but these things get decorated by a king.

608
00:51:46,257 --> 00:51:51,977
For example, you get some lanky panky fellow from the street,

609
00:51:51,977 --> 00:51:58,327
half starved, who is a beggar, say, for example,

610
00:51:58,327 --> 00:52:05,887
and put those ornaments on him and all the dresses of a king.

611
00:52:05,887 --> 00:52:11,527
Put him on the stage, everybody may start laughing.

612
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:17,837
Nobody will think that he is a king by any chance,

613
00:52:17,837 --> 00:52:21,037
because he doesn’t have that dignity, doesn’t have that face,

614
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,457
he doesn’t have that body, he doesn’t have that mind,

615
00:52:23,457 --> 00:52:26,447
he doesn’t have that wisdom.

616
00:52:26,447 --> 00:52:30,337
So how is he a king?

617
00:52:30,337 --> 00:52:37,686
Like, there was one king who tried to make his shoes of pearls.

618
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:40,257
But he’s so stupid looking, you know,

619
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:44,297
that when I saw the pearls I said,

620
00:52:44,297 --> 00:52:49,577
“This is the man only who can think like this!”

621
00:52:49,577 --> 00:52:52,697
So stupid he was to look at.

622
00:52:52,697 --> 00:53:00,207
And was sure of these pearls being put on his shoes.

623
00:53:00,207 --> 00:53:06,377
So there are many such things these days all of these stupid people are doing.

624
00:53:06,377 --> 00:53:09,967
There are big, big cartoons coming out

625
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:15,947
and you can see for yourself how stupidly they live.

626
00:53:15,947 --> 00:53:22,207
To Me it’s such a difference I tell you.

627
00:53:22,207 --> 00:53:23,337
Such a difference.

628
00:53:23,337 --> 00:53:27,167
To them all these things are so important,

629
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:34,547
which if they don’t have they’ll buy and put it.

630
00:53:34,547 --> 00:53:43,757
I know of a gentleman who came with a garland to our program,

631
00:53:43,757 --> 00:53:52,237
I mean to our dinner, I asked him, “Why are you carrying the garland?”

632
00:53:52,237 --> 00:53:57,587
“See after all you see I was garlanded so I’m keeping the garland.”

633
00:53:57,587 --> 00:54:01,667
We didn’t know what to do!

634
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:03,287
We Indians will never take a garland,

635
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:07,227
first of all, anybody gives you they’ll put it, except for the Gods.

636
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:10,807
They will take it out immediately.

637
00:54:10,807 --> 00:54:13,417
Another lady who came to see Me and she said,

638
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,217
“I don’t understand these Indians,

639
00:54:15,217 --> 00:54:18,057
I bought a garland, I put it in my neck

640
00:54:18,057 --> 00:54:23,407
so they were all laughing on the street at me.”

641
00:54:23,407 --> 00:54:30,137
Now you Indians understand this, how subtle it is, just see,

642
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:33,687
that you can’t put garland, you are not God.

643
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:38,467
You cannot buy a garland (laughing) and put it in your neck and walk out.

644
00:54:38,467 --> 00:54:44,797
Innately you have to be that.

645
00:54:44,797 --> 00:54:55,406
So the person who is innately a king has the blessings of the Rajalakshmi.

646
00:54:55,406 --> 00:54:58,307
Then what does She do?

647
00:54:58,307 --> 00:55:01,247
What does She do to such a man?

648
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:05,847
What She does is first

649
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:13,697
his name is written on the hearts of the people whom he rules.

650
00:55:13,697 --> 00:55:22,217
She writes it with her own hand.

651
00:55:22,217 --> 00:55:24,797
They adore him,

652
00:55:24,797 --> 00:55:36,167
they admire him and they try to imbibe his qualities within himself.

653
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:43,537
Another blessing of Rajalakshmi is

654
00:55:43,537 --> 00:55:53,467
that She grants a particular type of a body,

655
00:55:53,467 --> 00:56:01,656
which has a coefficience, which gives vibrations.

656
00:56:01,656 --> 00:56:09,647
They may not be very selfish people

657
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:13,227
to make a big advertisement about themselves,

658
00:56:13,227 --> 00:56:16,497
talking about themselves, this that.

659
00:56:16,497 --> 00:56:25,227
But the way they are wherever they are, they show.

660
00:56:25,227 --> 00:56:33,436
We had many like these in our times also.

661
00:56:33,436 --> 00:56:38,916
Maybe that people didn’t accept them, maybe they are nowhere now,

662
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:44,527
some new johnnies are looking to be more jumping.

663
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:49,797
But whatever name is written in the heart of the people,

664
00:56:49,797 --> 00:56:54,906
are the people who are blessed by this Rajalakshmi.

665
00:56:54,906 --> 00:56:58,297
So what a politician has to understand [is]

666
00:56:58,297 --> 00:57:03,887
that he has not to make money,

667
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:13,477
he does not have to have a big show about himself.

668
00:57:13,477 --> 00:57:20,247
He does not have to do anything that is like

669
00:57:20,247 --> 00:57:24,577
laundering the money from the country.

670
00:57:24,577 --> 00:57:27,608
He does not have to kill others who oppose him,

671
00:57:27,608 --> 00:57:31,827
he doesn’t have to shout at those who trouble them.

672
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:33,757
But what has he to do?

673
00:57:33,757 --> 00:57:36,177
He has to remember that.

674
00:57:36,177 --> 00:57:44,817
“I am here for the fame of a good man.”

675
00:57:44,817 --> 00:57:52,367
He should worry about the fame he will be leaving after his death.

676
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:56,247
He should see to it that his fame is safe.

677
00:57:56,247 --> 00:58:08,676
For example, see Shri Rama who was a king of benevolence, no doubt about it.

678
00:58:08,676 --> 00:58:14,787
But His own wife when somebody challenged that

679
00:58:14,787 --> 00:58:19,527
– “She has lived with Ravana and how can She be pure?”

680
00:58:19,527 --> 00:58:25,737
He knew that She was pure, still He decided that He will ask Her to go

681
00:58:25,737 --> 00:58:35,747
because to keep the show, to keep the whole image of a king

682
00:58:35,747 --> 00:58:41,137
and He sent Her away.

683
00:58:41,137 --> 00:58:47,077
But nowadays you find somebody’s brother employed in America,

684
00:58:47,077 --> 00:58:52,957
sister employed there and he has made, his uncle has made a big house

685
00:58:52,957 --> 00:58:55,807
and his wife has accumulated so much money.

686
00:58:55,807 --> 00:59:01,807
It is all going on.

687
00:59:01,807 --> 00:59:04,877
Everybody will talk like that about that person,

688
00:59:04,877 --> 00:59:07,477
that he’s just money oriented,

689
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:12,507
he just spends money on nonsensical things and he is just exploiting us.

690
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:19,927
Everybody will talk but nobody will tell him on the face.

691
00:59:19,927 --> 00:59:25,156
So what you have to worry is about absolute correct character.

692
00:59:25,156 --> 00:59:31,127
These days this is another point.

693
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:32,127
Every politician

694
00:59:32,127 --> 00:59:33,918
must have three, four keeps otherwise he is not a politician.

695
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:39,377
Like we had Nawabs, we had one Nawab in Lucknow

696
00:59:39,377 --> 00:59:40,607
who had hundred and sixty five wives.

697
00:59:40,607 --> 00:59:45,227
He thought if he doesn’t have hundred and sixty five,

698
00:59:45,227 --> 00:59:50,887
people won’t accept him as a Nawab.

699
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:54,957
So this is another inferiority complex

700
00:59:54,957 --> 00:59:57,847
that you should have some women around you

701
00:59:57,847 --> 01:00:06,477
so that people will say what a powerful man he is.

702
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:14,847
Now those days are gone now, now Satya Yuga has started.

703
01:00:14,847 --> 01:00:24,127
In Satya Yuga I assure you anybody who is not blessed by Rajalakshmi

704
01:00:24,127 --> 01:00:33,597
will have to go to jail or will have to leave the seat,

705
01:00:33,597 --> 01:00:39,037
will be thrown away or will be as they say,

706
01:00:39,037 --> 01:00:41,577
“Doubly dying go to the waste, dust”.

707
01:00:41,577 --> 01:00:44,567
It has to be.

708
01:00:44,567 --> 01:00:51,327
They’ll be all exposed, whatever tricks they may try.

709
01:00:51,327 --> 01:01:04,117
And they will have the consequence of being artificially the rulers.

710
01:01:04,117 --> 01:01:16,487
But a genuineness is the sign that the queen of blessings,

711
01:01:16,487 --> 01:01:24,817
the goddess of Rajalakshmi, is residing in that person.

712
01:01:24,817 --> 01:01:34,887
In Satya Yuga it will happen I’m sure.

713
01:01:34,887 --> 01:01:39,417
But even in Sahaja Yoga I find people doing politics sometimes,

714
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:42,317
I was amazed!

715
01:01:42,317 --> 01:01:47,847
People think politics means keeping groups,

716
01:01:47,847 --> 01:01:53,747
making groups, telling things from here to there, there to there.

717
01:01:53,747 --> 01:01:56,277
That shows you lack collectivity.

718
01:01:56,277 --> 01:02:07,277
A person who is a Sahaja Yogi will try to cement everyone together

719
01:02:07,277 --> 01:02:13,847
because the power lies in collectivity.

720
01:02:13,847 --> 01:02:19,136
To break the collectivity for anything

721
01:02:19,136 --> 01:02:28,107
is very dangerous for that person as well as for others.

722
01:02:28,107 --> 01:02:33,517
So now you have entered into the kingdom of God,

723
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:39,707
you are now sitting in the court of God Almighty.

724
01:02:39,707 --> 01:02:47,666
Here, of course, as courtiers you have to dress up well,

725
01:02:47,666 --> 01:02:52,737
sit properly, should take up your seats.

726
01:02:52,737 --> 01:02:55,587
You have to be systematic

727
01:02:55,587 --> 01:03:00,347
and above board because you are Sahaja Yogis.

728
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:04,147
You are not ordinary people.

729
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,167
You are special people.

730
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:13,027
How many people in this world are going to be Sahaja Yogi?

731
01:03:13,027 --> 01:03:16,416
You are special people,

732
01:03:16,416 --> 01:03:27,247
so try to make yourself such beautiful instruments of Rajalakshmi

733
01:03:27,247 --> 01:03:32,117
that people when they will see you they will vote for you

734
01:03:32,117 --> 01:03:45,357
and tomorrow you will rule the world.

735
01:03:45,357 --> 01:03:50,477
I do not want you to get out of politics or get in politics

736
01:03:50,477 --> 01:03:56,337
but you have to first get the blessings of the Rajalakshmi

737
01:03:56,337 --> 01:03:58,857
and then only you should understand

738
01:03:58,857 --> 01:04:03,087
what’s wrong with our country, what we have to do,

739
01:04:03,087 --> 01:04:10,567
what is the purpose, why do we want to become politicians,

740
01:04:10,567 --> 01:04:16,267
what we have to do, we have to have plans, what is your project.

741
01:04:16,267 --> 01:04:22,407
All these things now put your attention from yourself to outside.

742
01:04:22,407 --> 01:04:26,187
Like, that day I received a letter saying,

743
01:04:26,187 --> 01:04:30,477
“my father is sick and my mother is sick then my son is sick,

744
01:04:30,477 --> 01:04:33,387
and this and that and that and that.”

745
01:04:33,387 --> 01:04:38,577
Such people can’t do much.

746
01:04:38,577 --> 01:04:40,517
When the war of independence started in India

747
01:04:40,517 --> 01:04:43,666
we gave up our studies, gave up our parents, gave up everything,

748
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:46,527
we were very young people.

749
01:04:46,527 --> 01:04:47,677
So now you have to know

750
01:04:47,677 --> 01:04:53,977
that if you have to really take to politics

751
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,337
you have to have the blessings of Rajalakshmi

752
01:04:56,337 --> 01:05:00,807
and for that you have to build up yourself

753
01:05:00,807 --> 01:05:05,207
with that dignity, with that sense.

754
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:12,926
I bless you from My heart that in every country such

755
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:15,427
people will come up.

756
01:05:16,326 --> 01:05:18,826
May God bless you
