00:00:02.263 --> 00:00:07.263
When Warren talks about other gurus I can't help laughing.

00:00:09.135 --> 00:00:11.135
It's beyond me to understand

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.647
why people get stuck up with them, it's really beyond that

00:00:18.697 --> 00:00:20.697
because it is so obvious

00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:25.306
that God cannot be bought,

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:30.349
you cannot pay for God, it is absolutely obvious

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.567
for any intelligent man, it should be obvious.

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:42.205
How much did you pay to become a human being from say monkeys,

00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:48.124
or what did we do, did we cut our tails or anything to become human beings?

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:52.374
We have become by the grace of God.

00:00:54.452 --> 00:00:56.452
What can we pay for the grace of God?

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.474
It is very simple you cannot,

00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:04.974
God doesn't understand money.

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:08.356
It is human beings who have created money and all these things

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.331
and economic wants and all this economic problem.

00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:14.323
God doesn't understand any economics that you have made.

00:01:14.797 --> 00:01:15.760
He doesn't understand!

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.911
This is all your own doings.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.275
Your own projections and complications

00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:25.137
and you are entangled into it.

00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:26.953
It is as simple as that.

00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:30.698
I mean, you have seen these people

00:01:34.882 --> 00:01:36.882
who live on other people's money,

00:01:37.382 --> 00:01:40.874
I call it OPM, are parasites.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.880
You won't live on other people's money; will you, any one of you.

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:50.761
So they do not have even a simple self-respect.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:55.893
Not only that, but these parasites are thriving.

00:01:58.778 --> 00:02:00.778
It is so obvious, so very obvious,

00:02:03.818 --> 00:02:05.255
that we like befooling.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.101
The more one is able to befool us, the better we are.

00:02:12.742 --> 00:02:15.015
I went to Calcutta once for a program

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:19.222
and I had many programs,

00:02:20.653 --> 00:02:25.349
but one of them was in a very posh place as they call it, in a

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.001
hotel they arranged the program. I said this hotel people, you see.

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:31.775
These rich people they will not be interested in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:32.835
They have been too rich.

00:02:33.807 --> 00:02:34.944
From all over the world

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:40.536
overly rich people can never understand this you see,

00:02:40.687 --> 00:02:44.156
they want somebody who will take money from them,

00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:45.844
and they can show off their money.

00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:49.842
And we had a program and there were two halls.

00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:54.603
I told them take a very small one because I know them too well,

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:59.841
and the bigger hall was occupied by another fellow

00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:04.764
who was with some sort of a show on,

00:03:05.264 --> 00:03:09.611
stuff, and we were amazed that, except for two people,

00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:12.954
most of them who came inside went to his program

00:03:14.176 --> 00:03:18.800
and after eight days he was arrested in Poona for robbing people.

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.619
But all of them went to his program and not to mine.

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.066
When it was written not a single pie will be charged and it's all-free

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:29.335
and all those things

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.424
and he looked so dishonest for me from his own photographs, if you

00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:36.495
could see him, he was so dishonest to look at

00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:40.583
and people could not see that, I mean it was so simple to see.

00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:44.388
See, that shows that you have lost every sensitivity

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.228
to know what is plastic and what is real.

00:03:53.556 --> 00:03:55.556
It makes me laugh sometimes, the way

00:03:55.604 --> 00:03:58.056
today only I was discussing in the aero plane with somebody

00:03:58.556 --> 00:04:01.393
He was seriously telling me how much he was tortured by

00:04:02.147 --> 00:04:04.713
another group where he paid three thousand pounds

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:08.252
just to get some sort of a horrible mantra which has no meaning

00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:12.808
and where he worked very hard for days together

00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:18.122
and he broke his back and he broke his every part of his

00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:23.629
bone in the backbone area, and all sorts of things he did and

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.498
I mean he became so nervous,

00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:28.010
recluse,

00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:32.809
they are even frightened of a garlic, if they see one garlic, I mean

00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:37.297
after getting realization you have to become a person who is absolutely powerful

00:04:37.662 --> 00:04:39.184
in control of yourself

00:04:39.684 --> 00:04:41.898
not aggressive but not to be

00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:45.230
such a cowardly recluses

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:51.299
and he told me all these things and I did not know what to do

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:56.589
because it was such a description

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:59.089
They don't know whether to laugh or to cry

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:02.953
really because this thing behind it

00:05:03.297 --> 00:05:06.246
is all hocus pocus absolutely hocus pocus,

00:05:06.492 --> 00:05:09.853
I think this world must have started after the fact that I'm coming into this world

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:13.958
absolutely absurd is to say that you will fly or

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:17.264
you will see the light and all these nonsenses,

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:22.382
and on top of that

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.002
the suffering of a person,

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.010
of a person who is a genuine seeker,

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.955
who is a seeker of the truth.

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:33.119
He is a man of God

00:05:34.322 --> 00:05:36.361
and he's being tortured like this you see

00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:37.966
makes you so unhappy.

00:05:39.482 --> 00:05:42.188
You just don't know what to say about the whole thing that's happening.

00:05:42.688 --> 00:05:43.782
You have to wake up

00:05:44.985 --> 00:05:48.068
to your self-esteem and know that you are created human beings

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.120
for a special thing,

00:05:49.602 --> 00:05:53.834
and not to be bounced and cheated by these horrible fake people.

00:05:56.112 --> 00:05:59.028
One has to understand the innate nature of God

00:05:59.528 --> 00:06:01.528
to understand what should happen to you

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:06.288
as realized souls, if you become abnormal and freaky

00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:09.594
then it is not that you have got your realization,

00:06:09.781 --> 00:06:11.781
on the contrary a person

00:06:12.574 --> 00:06:17.266
who is realized becomes extremely normal, is the most normal person.

00:06:20.831 --> 00:06:24.185
Apart from these things there are some reasons

00:06:24.386 --> 00:06:28.234
built-in within us which make us so stupid.

00:06:28.734 --> 00:06:32.617
Really built-in I should say, because we have come from matter,

00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:38.010
we are gross, our origin has been gross,

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.123
we came from matter and we grew up

00:06:43.248 --> 00:06:45.555
to see that there is something beyond the matter

00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:48.506
that is the spirit and we are the spirit,

00:06:49.156 --> 00:06:51.582
but we get dominated by this matter,

00:06:52.082 --> 00:06:55.813
we really get dominated by matter, all through in our ventures,

00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:59.458
for example, if you are sitting in a chair,

00:06:59.558 --> 00:07:03.045
for example you make a chair out of some matter, you cannot sit on the ground,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.966
you form a habit of matter, matter starts growing on you,

00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:13.497
you become such a slave, such a slave of matter

00:07:14.622 --> 00:07:16.264
that you cannot get over it,

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:19.586
any matter you start using, for example you use a car

00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:21.016
then you cannot do without a car,

00:07:22.516 --> 00:07:24.924
you use electricity which is a material power,

00:07:25.524 --> 00:07:27.524
if it fails everything goes out,

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:29.601
you cannot do without it.

00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:33.114
So matter is all the time trying to overpower the spirit,

00:07:34.714 --> 00:07:36.994
but the beauty is, through your evolution,

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:41.187
you evolve to a stage

00:07:41.487 --> 00:07:44.481
where you are a human being and you start seeing the matter

00:07:45.206 --> 00:07:49.137
cannot dominate your spirit. This should be the self-estimation,

00:07:50.912 --> 00:07:54.568
there should be understanding that you are the spirit and not the matter.

00:07:58.043 --> 00:08:01.695
When you see this simple point

00:08:01.795 --> 00:08:05.512
then you understand that you cannot purchase God.

00:08:09.462 --> 00:08:13.300
Then another point also one understands that it is not the way,

00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:17.950
materially uses somebody you should accept

00:08:19.175 --> 00:08:23.177
but spiritually, if he does something spiritually to you

00:08:24.355 --> 00:08:25.367
then you should accept

00:08:26.417 --> 00:08:28.417
for example seeing the light,

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:31.828
say they say you see the light, why see the light myself, yes

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:37.488
but to see the light I have to be away from the light,

00:08:39.138 --> 00:08:39.966
do you see the point?

00:08:42.091 --> 00:08:44.091
You have to be the light.

00:08:49.816 --> 00:08:53.807
So it's a very simple thing, if you understand it's commonsense,

00:08:54.432 --> 00:08:56.432
that if you have to be the light,

00:08:57.857 --> 00:08:59.857
then you have to be inside the light,

00:09:01.732 --> 00:09:03.732
part and parcel of the light.

00:09:04.632 --> 00:09:06.632
But to see the light you have to go further.

00:09:06.807 --> 00:09:08.807
Actually from this distance I can't even see

00:09:09.307 --> 00:09:12.450
if I have to really see the light I have to go much further to see this light.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.435
All these things that they are talking

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.270
and telling you is such a camouflage

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.525
and they have been very good at befooling you.

00:09:30.048 --> 00:09:34.575
It is impossible to convince people who want to be befooled.

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:41.315
It is impossible. It is easy to befool them

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.937
because they are anxious to be befooled, so alright,

00:09:46.987 --> 00:09:48.987
but those who want

00:09:50.787 --> 00:09:53.905
that they should really realized it, they should get it

00:09:54.955 --> 00:09:58.143
then their attitude is very different, they would like to go and see.

00:09:58.643 --> 00:09:59.953
what the disciples have got,

00:10:00.878 --> 00:10:02.878
these people who have paid so much money,

00:10:03.078 --> 00:10:05.729
there have been people for fifteen years, twenty years, go and see them,

00:10:06.329 --> 00:10:07.252
what have you got?

00:10:09.227 --> 00:10:14.004
If they say, "alright, I am feeling very much better in health",

00:10:16.754 --> 00:10:18.754
you look at the face and you will know that they are not.

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:23.844
Supposing they say "I feel relaxed", so what?

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:26.769
What is so great that you are feeling relaxed,

00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:30.766
so called relaxation, you can feel relaxed even with the dope

00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:36.023
even going to a pub you might feel relaxed,

00:10:36.223 --> 00:10:38.274
in some company you might feel relaxed, so what?

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:40.779
What is so great, is that something God's work?

00:10:42.304 --> 00:10:43.611
Just to relax you?

00:10:46.911 --> 00:10:48.911
Some people say

00:10:49.411 --> 00:10:52.230
"I feel better" this might be ego pampering.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.991
But what powers did you get yourself? If you become the spirit

00:10:57.791 --> 00:11:01.067
then you have to have powers of the spirit flowing through you, isn't it?

00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:04.578
It should be a common, logical conclusion.

00:11:07.428 --> 00:11:09.428
'What is the power, you have got?

00:11:12.903 --> 00:11:14.903
What have I got from them?

00:11:15.828 --> 00:11:17.828
They have taken all my purse, my money.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:20.712
Thousands of pounds have gone to him, everything done?

00:11:20.862 --> 00:11:25.836
What did I get from him? "We should have an understanding,

00:11:29.686 --> 00:11:31.108
but this nobody asks

00:11:31.154 --> 00:11:33.608
because there is a big mafia in all these organizations,

00:11:33.883 --> 00:11:36.385
you are not supposed discuss, you are not supposed to talk.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.692
You are put in different compartments; it's a big secret going on,

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:44.196
If you tell some Indian, he just laugh,

00:11:45.346 --> 00:11:47.346
because he knows the meanings of these words,

00:11:48.146 --> 00:11:49.009
are so stupid.

00:11:50.059 --> 00:11:52.059
Some of the words of the mantras means

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:55.970
this showing this, some of the words means scorpion,

00:11:57.945 --> 00:12:03.438
some of them means the serpent,

00:12:03.938 --> 00:12:08.681
all kinds of things, and some of them means the siren.

00:12:12.056 --> 00:12:14.056
In a very ridiculous way

00:12:15.006 --> 00:12:17.651
these people have befooled you.

00:12:17.901 --> 00:12:19.901
A sort of a respite they are taken I think,

00:12:20.876 --> 00:12:21.939
or is it a respite

00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:29.810
of the satanic on the divine people who have come on this earth to seek God?

00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:33.114
Is that attack of these negative people

00:12:33.614 --> 00:12:35.996
who are trying to divide you completely and

00:12:37.146 --> 00:12:39.146
ruin your images on this earth,

00:12:40.071 --> 00:12:43.197
you have to be aware of that. We are very vulnerable

00:12:43.533 --> 00:12:44.383
because you are seeking,

00:12:46.358 --> 00:12:48.765
you are more vulnerable because you have no self esteem,

00:12:51.265 --> 00:12:53.265
you treat yourselves so cheaply.

00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:57.223
You do not judge into what lions' den you are entering into

00:12:57.723 --> 00:12:59.723
and you get be so badly hurt,

00:13:00.648 --> 00:13:02.648
with all your sincerity, with all that,

00:13:03.148 --> 00:13:06.134
you do not give a second thought to think that

00:13:06.359 --> 00:13:08.182
even if there are thousands of them going

00:13:08.334 --> 00:13:10.334
before I going there I should find out

00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:12.484
what sort of a nonsense is going on there.

00:13:14.284 --> 00:13:16.830
If you go there as an ordinary visitor,

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.403
you will immediately find out

00:13:18.903 --> 00:13:20.903
that this is a fake and a false thing going on,

00:13:21.078 --> 00:13:22.495
you have been warned in the bible

00:13:27.695 --> 00:13:28.706
it has been warned

00:13:28.752 --> 00:13:31.467
that there will be fake and false people coming on this earth.

00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:39.208
Now there are another type of people also,

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:40.366
I will cover

00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:44.358
the chakras later little, because giving little introduction to the subject

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.783
about how to avoid this thing,

00:13:47.912 --> 00:13:52.028
who are bound by ritualistic ideas, as he said about Christianity,

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.259
of giving very subtle forms of things.

00:13:59.683 --> 00:14:01.683
But we must see what it is doing,

00:14:02.812 --> 00:14:04.120
like Church of England,

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:07.781
can you imagine, Church of England owns the whole of Soho.

00:14:10.127 --> 00:14:12.861
And the question was raised, "how can you own this Soho,

00:14:12.904 --> 00:14:15.096
where all the prostitutes are earning their livings?"

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:16.979
And the answer came in

00:14:17.079 --> 00:14:20.551
that Christ looked after Mary Magdalene, who was a prostitute, see,

00:14:24.651 --> 00:14:28.063
you can see, and the people accepted this answer.

00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:36.207
Then the whole thing of a ritual starts, you see,

00:14:36.288 --> 00:14:38.539
"come along here and sit down,

00:14:38.715 --> 00:14:40.851
and bring the child and we will baptize it."

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.644
It's a joke,

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.541
it's a very big joke.

00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:53.288
Baptism is a living process within you,

00:14:53.712 --> 00:14:55.070
it's a living happening.

00:14:56.599 --> 00:14:58.599
Did Christ baptize anyone of them?

00:15:02.432 --> 00:15:05.799
Did He put His hand on anybody's head and say "you are baptized by Me"?

00:15:09.785 --> 00:15:11.785
Ask the question, did He do it?

00:15:15.256 --> 00:15:16.641
Then how are these people doing it?

00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:18.883
They have taken Christ into their hands

00:15:19.193 --> 00:15:21.520
as if they found Him somewhere in the storm somewhere.

00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:27.394
What right have they got to say they are baptizing?

00:15:28.446 --> 00:15:33.934
It is a living force of God, which resides within you

00:15:34.586 --> 00:15:37.596
He said that, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames."

00:15:38.134 --> 00:15:39.790
Let them explain this point only.

00:15:41.319 --> 00:15:43.610
Then they say He is Alpha and Omega

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.915
what does that mean?

00:15:45.415 --> 00:15:48.088
For all practical purposes what does that mean to you?

00:15:49.807 --> 00:15:52.856
For that you have to read Devi Bhagvatam.

00:15:56.975 --> 00:15:58.975
What was Christ? Who is He?

00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:01.302
How He is Alpha and He is Omega

00:16:02.164 --> 00:16:04.932
Why He came on this earth? Really, what was His purpose?

00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:07.796
There is nothing there. Just some few people who were not realized

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:09.934
saw Him and wrote it down, finished.

00:16:13.863 --> 00:16:16.757
How can that become such an authority for anyone whatsoever,

00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:17.837
that you are fighting.

00:16:19.518 --> 00:16:23.090
It's very deep; it is because it is so narrow it is extremely deep.

00:16:24.085 --> 00:16:25.320
You have to widen to see.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.820
For example, you are standing on a well

00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:28.969
which is very narrow,

00:16:30.212 --> 00:16:32.205
and just hardly you can see anything inside,

00:16:32.212 --> 00:16:33.782
you can just see something flickering.

00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:37.363
To see the complete vision of that well

00:16:37.421 --> 00:16:39.215
you have to increase the narrowness of it,

00:16:42.325 --> 00:16:45.701
and that this we are not prepared to do because, you see Bible is the last one.

00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:48.125
Now I would say any other person

00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:50.752
would come and say, "what is the authority of Bible?",

00:16:50.767 --> 00:16:52.185
now what authority will you give?

00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:55.127
if say Christ is the authority of Bible. Take it like that,

00:16:55.475 --> 00:16:56.641
Christ never wrote Bible,

00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:01.380
He never wrote a word, so how you do connect?

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.493
Could be some journalist, who could write about Him,

00:17:05.164 --> 00:17:06.517
could be anything absurd.

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.398
If they Hindu say the Gita,

00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:16.505
ask them "who wrote Gita?"

00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:22.084
Krishna never wrote Gita; never did he write it?

00:17:24.489 --> 00:17:25.781
So what is the authority of it?

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:30.814
Nothing! Gita has no authority as such,

00:17:31.238 --> 00:17:34.112
how do you say that Gita was the one written by Krishna?

00:17:34.517 --> 00:17:37.291
He had nothing to do. Anybody, supposing you see me today

00:17:37.429 --> 00:17:40.221
and you write about me, you can write anything,

00:17:40.511 --> 00:17:41.464
anything you feel like,

00:17:43.507 --> 00:17:44.776
like a journalist came

00:17:45.352 --> 00:17:46.455
just to sort of

00:17:46.593 --> 00:17:48.784
find false with me. She was paid by some fake guru

00:17:49.284 --> 00:17:52.254
and she wrote that I eat betel nuts, which I have never eaten all my life

00:17:54.487 --> 00:17:57.072
I wish I could because that pleases some people,

00:17:57.382 --> 00:17:59.382
but I never eat I mean, I should have eaten but

00:17:59.577 --> 00:18:01.348
I never eat and she said that she saw

00:18:01.543 --> 00:18:04.557
betel nut, I don't know from which angle she saw me eating betel nuts

00:18:06.504 --> 00:18:08.504
If she had written Bible about me

00:18:08.814 --> 00:18:10.545
it would have been something funny

00:18:13.502 --> 00:18:15.217
than that is not the authority either.

00:18:15.793 --> 00:18:17.791
Moreover they did not have tape recorders to

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:19.607
tape anybody's lectures or anything,

00:18:21.155 --> 00:18:22.912
even His photograph was not there,

00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:24.867
that is today all these things are available

00:18:26.329 --> 00:18:27.457
so what is the authority?

00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:34.909
This is the problem with us is that

00:18:34.971 --> 00:18:38.486
we accept certain thing as an authority because we think we can control

00:18:39.996 --> 00:18:40.759
people

00:18:41.754 --> 00:18:45.206
by this misappropriation of authority to ourselves.

00:18:50.201 --> 00:18:51.702
And there have been people who have said

00:18:51.897 --> 00:18:55.718
"I am the Christ". I said "alright, walk on the water"

00:18:56.225 --> 00:18:58.747
first sign of Christ is see will He walk on the water because

00:18:58.885 --> 00:19:01.112
He was Omkara itself, He is Omkara

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.313
He can walk on it, He has no body as such He can walk on the water,

00:19:04.642 --> 00:19:07.176
alright, "walk on the water", and first step

00:19:08.095 --> 00:19:09.863
maybe in the water, the second he will go down.

00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:14.483
All such hocus pocus could be found out. If somebody says

00:19:14.602 --> 00:19:16.602
"that, you give me money I will make you fly",

00:19:16.912 --> 00:19:19.104
let him go off this leaning tower of Pisa

00:19:19.604 --> 00:19:22.589
what it is meant for, after all it must be used also sometimes,

00:19:22.899 --> 00:19:25.109
and throw him down, see how far he goes with flying.

00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:30.295
Have a nice show for him.

00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:34.820
That's how you can find out these people whether it happens or not.

00:19:39.415 --> 00:19:44.756
So this is how I find in this country also in wagon of negativity

00:19:45.808 --> 00:19:49.715
of these people who are here to spoil your chances of realization.

00:19:50.977 --> 00:19:53.379
And it's very difficult to give realization to people

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.057
who have been to these people,

00:19:56.214 --> 00:19:57.424
have been initiated,

00:19:57.733 --> 00:20:00.788
have been really spoiled in their Kundalini is rather difficult.

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:07.950
I have worked day in and day out to neutralize it,

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:14.694
and I have been working. But the interest in your Self can only come

00:20:14.985 --> 00:20:16.582
when you will have self esteem

00:20:16.834 --> 00:20:20.593
that is very important and that is the center of Vishudhi chakra.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:23.175
This center.

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:26.932
I came up to the Heart chakra the other day

00:20:27.432 --> 00:20:30.862
And now today I'm going to talk to you about the Vishudhi

00:20:31.843 --> 00:20:35.786
Vishudhi is this centre placed at the back of the backbone here

00:20:37.565 --> 00:20:40.087
which has given a human being a specialty,

00:20:41.027 --> 00:20:46.049
which separates him from animals, that he raises his head upward.

00:20:47.883 --> 00:20:49.494
By raising his head upward

00:20:51.328 --> 00:20:52.254
he has been able

00:20:57.059 --> 00:20:59.983
to create a new dimension for his brain.

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:03.945
And this new dimension is a dimension by which

00:21:04.156 --> 00:21:05.921
he creates ego within himself.

00:21:10.946 --> 00:21:13.566
Before becoming a human being

00:21:14.272 --> 00:21:19.580
I hope you can see all of you. Can I? Can you move this?

00:21:22.424 --> 00:21:24.450
Before becoming a human being

00:21:27.013 --> 00:21:28.349
your brain was flat

00:21:29.894 --> 00:21:31.894
and all covered with the super ego.

00:21:33.151 --> 00:21:37.478
At the most like dogs, or you can say the horses,

00:21:37.978 --> 00:21:38.818
they have the super ego.

00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:46.608
And when you became a human being,

00:21:49.763 --> 00:21:52.520
a locking system took place by which

00:21:54.739 --> 00:21:58.261
you started developing, or you can say a twist took place by which

00:21:58.348 --> 00:22:00.348
you started developing your action.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.953
For example an animal

00:22:06.168 --> 00:22:09.380
does not know how to make a chair out of wood,

00:22:12.443 --> 00:22:13.010
an action

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.352
physically, at the most it might carry this chair which is made,

00:22:18.797 --> 00:22:20.934
put it there and mimic you sit on that.

00:22:21.737 --> 00:22:24.314
but it cannot make anything with his hand

00:22:25.763 --> 00:22:30.021
maybe it can weave a small little nest or something like that

00:22:30.315 --> 00:22:32.315
for it to live at the most.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:39.200
So you with your action can overpower the matter.

00:22:41.186 --> 00:22:43.186
You have been able to achieve

00:22:44.539 --> 00:22:46.801
great heights in overpowering

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:52.661
all the five elements by using them as

00:22:53.629 --> 00:22:55.725
power for your everyday use also

00:22:56.404 --> 00:22:59.913
like, electricity, magnetism, sound, everything, ether.

00:23:02.174 --> 00:23:02.660
But

00:23:07.397 --> 00:23:08.160
animals

00:23:10.448 --> 00:23:12.629
when they come in contact with human beings

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.374
they also can be conditioned

00:23:17.057 --> 00:23:18.517
as far as

00:23:19.402 --> 00:23:22.746
their understanding of relationship with human beings is concerned, but

00:23:22.806 --> 00:23:24.847
it is not that they could be made to act

00:23:28.002 --> 00:23:30.349
on to some matter, and this

00:23:31.179 --> 00:23:32.794
action, the physical action

00:23:33.609 --> 00:23:35.294
has given a by-product

00:23:36.661 --> 00:23:38.111
which is called as ego.

00:23:39.358 --> 00:23:40.156
This is the beginning.

00:23:41.578 --> 00:23:43.578
Then the second action is

00:23:45.121 --> 00:23:45.720
the thinking.

00:23:46.811 --> 00:23:49.141
The animal doesn't think of the future,

00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:51.641
he doesn't have any insurances.

00:23:52.334 --> 00:23:54.334
Animal is not bothered about insurance,

00:23:54.944 --> 00:23:57.726
of what will happen to my great grandchildren when I die,

00:23:58.445 --> 00:24:04.577
what part of my house will be going to which of my children,

00:24:05.077 --> 00:24:07.077
he is not bothered about all these things

00:24:07.951 --> 00:24:09.577
and he does not even have

00:24:09.788 --> 00:24:11.941
such a sense of possession as human beings have,

00:24:13.753 --> 00:24:16.091
so it so happens

00:24:16.508 --> 00:24:18.508
that we start developing our ego

00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:20.719
when we start planning for the future,

00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:23.400
thinking of the future, going into the future

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.442
and also when we use our physical being

00:24:27.598 --> 00:24:32.464
to create something or to do any physical work

00:24:34.993 --> 00:24:35.886
If an animal

00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:41.624
goes and attacks a cow or something, say a tiger,

00:24:42.872 --> 00:24:47.214
and brings it home for his family,

00:24:47.714 --> 00:24:51.010
he is not proud, he is not egoistical like human beings are.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.820
While human beings, if they earn about say

00:24:55.719 --> 00:24:58.024
five hundred dollars they become very egoistical,

00:24:59.033 --> 00:25:01.033
they think we have earned such a lot of money

00:25:02.028 --> 00:25:04.912
and we have done so much, we have every right to dominate the wife

00:25:05.287 --> 00:25:06.024
and vice versa.

00:25:07.662 --> 00:25:10.299
But an animal doesn't think he has the right to dominate,

00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:15.672
see whatever he does in the nature of his own personality,

00:25:16.337 --> 00:25:20.230
he doesn't do it as an idea that he has to do this

00:25:20.427 --> 00:25:24.161
and he is very important and he doesn't have this ego,

00:25:24.813 --> 00:25:27.279
so he does not even think that this is karmas

00:25:27.641 --> 00:25:30.386
that I have to face for it and I have done something wrong

00:25:30.515 --> 00:25:34.416
I've killed a cow so I must go a Brahmin and pay him a lot of money

00:25:34.476 --> 00:25:35.867
"because I have done such a sin",

00:25:36.587 --> 00:25:39.125
these ideas do not come into the heads of an animal

00:25:40.203 --> 00:25:42.354
because he is not used to that dimension.

00:25:42.634 --> 00:25:45.829
A new dimension of karmas to which human beings are

00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:48.109
because of this two creations,

00:25:49.132 --> 00:25:52.336
because of ego, you feel you have done bad karmas or good karmas

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.410
if you had no ego you would never have felt that.

00:25:58.321 --> 00:26:00.321
These two things starts at this point

00:26:00.353 --> 00:26:02.668
and you see it very clearly should start from there

00:26:02.975 --> 00:26:06.101
but it's put down there, actually this start maneuvering

00:26:06.147 --> 00:26:07.856
from this point,

00:26:08.576 --> 00:26:11.442
and you start developing ego and super ego in your head

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.305
and you developed a triangular brain

00:26:16.303 --> 00:26:20.457
a prism like brain and when such a brain has developed

00:26:21.221 --> 00:26:26.305
then a new problem starts that through this prism

00:26:27.259 --> 00:26:29.406
whatever energy passes into it

00:26:30.418 --> 00:26:31.850
most of it goes out

00:26:32.452 --> 00:26:34.966
according to the parallelogram of forces

00:26:35.978 --> 00:26:37.978
that I have no time just now to tell you.

00:26:38.478 --> 00:26:41.531
Because of that your attention is all the time outside

00:26:42.382 --> 00:26:44.382
you can only do something outside

00:26:44.633 --> 00:26:46.367
you cannot take your attention inside.

00:26:46.721 --> 00:26:49.060
Now supposing I say, "you put your attention inside"

00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:51.990
because you have to go inside you cannot do it

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:54.261
you just can't do it.

00:26:54.761 --> 00:26:56.291
your attention is always outside

00:26:56.425 --> 00:26:58.851
"I have to do this this, I have to go there, I have to get it"

00:26:58.985 --> 00:27:01.792
But you cannot put your attention inside, that's not possible.

00:27:03.141 --> 00:27:05.979
I cannot just order you that you put your attention inside,

00:27:06.611 --> 00:27:08.876
some happening has to take place within you.

00:27:09.376 --> 00:27:12.436
Supposing something is suddenly falls of then your attention goes there

00:27:12.936 --> 00:27:16.166
In the same way when the happening of the Kundalini awakening takes place,

00:27:16.666 --> 00:27:21.693
then your attention goes through that

00:27:22.017 --> 00:27:25.373
which is awakened there and you just start seeing the awakening,

00:27:25.873 --> 00:27:27.518
or, you can say, the feel the awakening,

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.063
but it is such a quick thing,

00:27:31.077 --> 00:27:32.024
a split of a second,

00:27:32.524 --> 00:27:33.902
that sometimes you miss everything

00:27:33.935 --> 00:27:36.759
except that you see the cool breeze has started flowing through you.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.876
Sometimes you do feel, it's here,

00:27:40.104 --> 00:27:42.190
it's here, so many people feel that way also

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.060
it's come up now, and it's here throbbing,

00:27:45.346 --> 00:27:47.475
now its alright, it has started working.

00:27:48.461 --> 00:27:51.305
It depends on what sort of runway you have,

00:27:51.948 --> 00:27:53.379
if the runway is horrid,

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.501
then you see you go on feeling all the bumps and the dumps and everything.

00:27:59.515 --> 00:28:01.827
Sometimes the runways are so badly spoiled

00:28:03.456 --> 00:28:07.226
that it takes sometimes months for the Kundalini to rise,

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.456
but now I think

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.369
in Sahaja Yoga we have developed such methods and techniques,

00:28:13.512 --> 00:28:15.512
of such permutations and combinations,

00:28:16.112 --> 00:28:19.434
that nowadays it's much easier to raise the Kundalini

00:28:19.534 --> 00:28:22.501
than it was, about say, ten years back.

00:28:22.772 --> 00:28:27.104
Then I had about twenty disciples

00:28:28.258 --> 00:28:30.858
with whom I worked for two years to give them realization.

00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:35.099
In London I had six disciples for four years I have worked on them

00:28:35.442 --> 00:28:38.909
to give them realization. But today we have thousands in UK

00:28:39.195 --> 00:28:41.195
and we have lots of them in Sydney also

00:28:41.295 --> 00:28:43.009
And in India also we have thousands.

00:28:43.352 --> 00:28:45.594
Where they just get it in a second,

00:28:46.794 --> 00:28:49.511
but it is a different thing now because it has evolved so well.

00:28:51.268 --> 00:28:53.412
But this happening is a living happening,

00:28:53.912 --> 00:28:57.360
this you cannot do, you can jump, you can stand on your heads

00:28:57.403 --> 00:29:01.177
take off your clothes, wear some badges, wear some clothes, you can do all that

00:29:01.948 --> 00:29:02.952
but you cannot make

00:29:02.951 --> 00:29:06.170
the Kundalini rise in the sense you see the pulsation there at the

00:29:06.253 --> 00:29:08.542
triangular bone, you can see the pulsation of the Kundalini there,

00:29:09.042 --> 00:29:12.031
actual pulsation, you can see the rising of the Kundalini.

00:29:12.902 --> 00:29:13.510
You see it.

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:17.141
You also feel the cool breeze rising,

00:29:17.855 --> 00:29:24.209
you can also with a stethoscope feel the sound, lap lap lap lap

00:29:25.252 --> 00:29:27.830
coming up to here which Kabir has very clearly said

00:29:28.101 --> 00:29:30.101
/?/

00:29:30.772 --> 00:29:36.946
at the apex of the /?/ zero apex of your head.

00:29:37.446 --> 00:29:41.468
You hear first the anahata. Anahata is this

00:29:41.611 --> 00:29:43.698
sound of the heart without percussion,

00:29:45.027 --> 00:29:47.312
and that is how you feel the Kundalini there

00:29:47.641 --> 00:29:49.946
and then it breaks through you feel it

00:29:50.046 --> 00:29:52.046
actually on your fingers,

00:29:52.117 --> 00:29:54.117
it is an actualization of the experience.

00:29:54.617 --> 00:29:56.617
This is what the baptism is.

00:29:59.031 --> 00:30:01.429
When Warren  said that

00:30:01.586 --> 00:30:03.586
you have never had your real baptism,

00:30:03.815 --> 00:30:04.666
do not be angry.

00:30:06.466 --> 00:30:07.310
Because it is a fact,

00:30:08.539 --> 00:30:10.753
you have not got your realization.

00:30:11.253 --> 00:30:14.835
Christ has said that you have to be born again, hundred times He said,

00:30:15.406 --> 00:30:17.406
so now they are started saying we are born again,

00:30:17.906 --> 00:30:19.228
it's again self certification.

00:30:20.014 --> 00:30:21.811
First of all is to use your baptism,

00:30:22.025 --> 00:30:24.838
now there is this another thing started, that we are born again.

00:30:26.395 --> 00:30:30.433
Now they come and ask, these people they change from one to another.

00:30:31.721 --> 00:30:34.100
That how is it through Christ,

00:30:35.971 --> 00:30:37.984
you have to get trough and you will see,

00:30:38.001 --> 00:30:39.876
only in Sahaja Yoga you will understand that,

00:30:39.913 --> 00:30:43.250
ultimately you have to pass through the gate of Christ only,

00:30:43.293 --> 00:30:46.218
to enter into the Kingdom of God. It is a fact,

00:30:46.718 --> 00:30:48.503
what He said, He never told lies.

00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:51.789
He told the complete truth,

00:30:52.289 --> 00:30:55.139
nothing but the truth. But the way you interpret it,

00:30:55.339 --> 00:30:57.426
the way you understand it, it is so narrow,

00:30:57.926 --> 00:30:59.484
that you do not want to accept it.

00:31:02.268 --> 00:31:05.787
This is the gate about which He has talked

00:31:06.658 --> 00:31:09.119
and this is the greatest thing He has done to us.

00:31:11.105 --> 00:31:16.528
Now this Vishudhi chakra is the centre of Shri Krishna.

00:31:17.499 --> 00:31:19.499
If I say this is the centre of Shri Krishna

00:31:20.485 --> 00:31:22.642
you may start doubting me.

00:31:22.756 --> 00:31:23.934
You should doubt me also,

00:31:23.942 --> 00:31:28.118
it is not problem, with Indians because they know it is the centre,

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.696
they know about centres they know where Krishna resides.

00:31:32.567 --> 00:31:34.838
and they know there are sixteen petals to this

00:31:35.652 --> 00:31:36.949
and that they know that he is

00:31:36.992 --> 00:31:40.728
called as the complete incarnation of the sixteen petals, and all that they know,

00:31:40.928 --> 00:31:42.928
I do not have to quarrel with them.

00:31:43.785 --> 00:31:47.726
And the centre here of Christ

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.673
is actually a little bit confusing because it is called as Mahavishnu.

00:31:51.673 --> 00:31:54.596
In Indians literature is called as Mahavishnu,

00:31:55.096 --> 00:31:57.898
not as Christ, and He is also

00:31:58.627 --> 00:32:01.581
is Bodha not Buddha, but Bodha,

00:32:01.852 --> 00:32:03.852
which they got a little bit confused

00:32:04.896 --> 00:32:10.821
in our old scriptures it is a difference of language.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.580
In one of my lectures on Christ

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.080
you will find out about His origin,

00:32:17.337 --> 00:32:20.403
why He was called Jesus, why He was called Christ

00:32:20.903 --> 00:32:24.587
and what is the origin of these things,

00:32:24.729 --> 00:32:27.205
why He arrived, who was His mother

00:32:27.562 --> 00:32:31.416
and everything you will find out from that lecture that I have got for you.

00:32:32.145 --> 00:32:34.246
It is better that you go through that lecture

00:32:34.404 --> 00:32:36.752
and see for yourself. We have lots of these tapes

00:32:37.252 --> 00:32:42.314
already in Sydney they can sent it over to you, you can look at it

00:32:42.528 --> 00:32:44.528
from that angle I mean in this

00:32:44.685 --> 00:32:49.354
small little time I cannot elaborately talk about Krishna,

00:32:49.611 --> 00:32:51.322
and about Christ,

00:32:52.237 --> 00:32:55.074
but the only thing I have to tell that

00:32:55.145 --> 00:32:57.532
there is a very great relationship between both of them,

00:32:58.032 --> 00:33:01.456
and Krist is the word that comes from the word Krishna,

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.956
and Kist in India is means

00:33:04.256 --> 00:33:05.969
the agriculture and Krishna

00:33:06.253 --> 00:33:09.364
also come from Krishi which also means agriculture.

00:33:10.232 --> 00:33:12.983
Agriculture means the one where you sow,

00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:20.163
and they are the sowers of the seed. They have sown the seed in the fields.

00:33:21.707 --> 00:33:27.266
So the sowing of the seed is done by Shri Krishna,

00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:29.566
and the Gita that he has described

00:33:29.751 --> 00:33:33.854
is also another very interesting thing about which we are very much confused.

00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:39.606
Krishna never wrote Gita, first of all,

00:33:40.106 --> 00:33:44.450
it was never written by an absolute Brahmin or anything who was a born brahmin,

00:33:44.592 --> 00:33:48.710
it was written by the illegitimate child of a fisher woman.

00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:56.888
How can he write, a man like that that you are born as a Brahmin

00:33:58.218 --> 00:34:01.469
you are to be born as a Brahmin what he was meaning,

00:34:01.969 --> 00:34:03.969
that when you are born as a Brahmin

00:34:04.626 --> 00:34:06.741
then you have the aptitude to see God.

00:34:06.784 --> 00:34:09.241
For example you are all Brahmins in his own words.

00:34:09.369 --> 00:34:10.966
That means you are the seekers of God,

00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:13.870
all the seekers of God are Brahmins

00:34:14.041 --> 00:34:16.430
and the seekers of power are /?/,

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:20.234
and the seekers of money are /?/,

00:34:20.877 --> 00:34:25.540
it meant the aptitude, but Hindus as usual

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.148
have made like all others, have made a mess of all that philosophy.

00:34:31.177 --> 00:34:33.349
According to them if you are born a Brahmin,

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.461
even if you are the greatest crook of the world, you are a Brahmin.

00:34:40.035 --> 00:34:44.050
And even if you are a person who is a

00:34:45.308 --> 00:34:47.937
very highly evolved person, if you are not

00:34:48.323 --> 00:34:50.639
born in a Brahmin family, then you are good for nothing.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:56.377
This caste system is such a horrible thing in India,

00:34:56.734 --> 00:34:59.596
which has no explanation at all in the scriptures because

00:35:00.096 --> 00:35:02.832
it is written that in everyone resides the spirit,

00:35:03.332 --> 00:35:05.332
there is spirit in everyone of you,

00:35:05.617 --> 00:35:07.945
how can you have caste system you can have aptitudes,

00:35:09.117 --> 00:35:12.638
but as usual people have escapes for everything,

00:35:12.952 --> 00:35:16.813
this point that everybody has the spirit within yourself.

00:35:17.313 --> 00:35:22.360
Gita has described it, that everyone has the spirit within,

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.673
but one has to know when he says there is spirit within you

00:35:26.902 --> 00:35:30.794
that means his meaning the human being have the spirit, not the devils.

00:35:32.896 --> 00:35:37.320
Because Krishna himself has killed so many devils in his lifetime,

00:35:37.577 --> 00:35:40.157
his one of the powers was /?/, means killing

00:35:40.528 --> 00:35:43.487
He used to kill so many devils so there are devils also

00:35:44.416 --> 00:35:47.072
on this principle that there is spirit in everybody

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.229
why did he kill so many devils?

00:35:49.557 --> 00:35:51.509
The devils do not have spirit in them.

00:35:52.127 --> 00:35:54.127
There are devils, and devils and devils,

00:35:54.441 --> 00:35:56.441
for example say, Hitler

00:35:56.625 --> 00:35:59.113
if he comes to ask for a realisation,

00:35:59.313 --> 00:36:01.313
do you think he can get it or he should get it?

00:36:02.686 --> 00:36:06.520
His greatest reward would be

00:36:07.764 --> 00:36:10.497
a rigorous imprisonment into hell

00:36:10.997 --> 00:36:12.997
or all his lives to come.

00:36:20.535 --> 00:36:26.307
how can you be so sure that he wasn't Krishna casting out devils, more devils?

00:36:27.469 --> 00:36:28.254
he was not

00:36:28.435 --> 00:36:33.801
how can you be so sure that Hitler was not Krishna casting out devils?

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.371
For that you must get your realization. That's why,

00:36:38.871 --> 00:36:41.886
you see, the surety will only will come then you become your absolute.

00:36:42.386 --> 00:36:43.644
Just now, you cannot be sure.

00:36:44.251 --> 00:36:46.964
For example I'll tell you, when you get your realization,

00:36:47.106 --> 00:36:50.486
you get your vibrations, alright? Now with these vibrations

00:36:50.715 --> 00:36:53.291
you can find out what is true and what is not true.

00:36:53.594 --> 00:36:55.322
Now you may say this maybe is all the myth.

00:36:56.269 --> 00:36:59.994
For example we had some Brahmins in one of the programs I had first arranged,

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:03.144
and I didn't know they had a fight with this organizers

00:37:03.358 --> 00:37:06.697
but they said, "She is not a Brahmin, how can have they a program here", or something like that.

00:37:07.197 --> 00:37:08.440
And they were sitting in the front row

00:37:08.618 --> 00:37:11.229
I did not know that they had a quarrel I just asked them

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.098
I said,

00:37:14.957 --> 00:37:20.633
"who is Brahmin among you, who thinks he is a Brahmin, just come forward",

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:25.362
so five, six of them, you see, like great wrestlers came and sat before me,

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:27.576
I said "alright please be seated" very arrogant

00:37:27.843 --> 00:37:30.906
I said "sit down", I said "put your hands towards me like this"

00:37:31.853 --> 00:37:33.853
and they started shaking their hands,

00:37:34.854 --> 00:37:37.357
they got little frightened. I said, "why are you shaking?",

00:37:37.857 --> 00:37:41.665
they said, "because we are Brahmins, and you are the power, that's why we are shaking."

00:37:41.861 --> 00:37:43.861
I said, see your neighbors, "they are also shaking"

00:37:44.361 --> 00:37:46.997
"yes yes they are also shaking, they might be also Brahmins."

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:48.669
I said, "please ask them what are they",

00:37:49.223 --> 00:37:52.837
they are some people, they said "these are the people who had come from a lunatic asylum".

00:37:56.146 --> 00:37:58.346
These were the only two people where shaking there,

00:37:58.846 --> 00:38:00.846
I said "now relatively you can see now

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:07.909
that when you thought you are the Brahmin, you are mad too to believe into such a thing".

00:38:09.375 --> 00:38:11.501
Now to believe that Hitler was also good,

00:38:12.412 --> 00:38:14.412
is a typical sign of escaping,

00:38:15.735 --> 00:38:18.022
in life horrible things,

00:38:22.046 --> 00:38:26.669
you see, just to have an idea that everything is fine,

00:38:26.884 --> 00:38:29.187
is the best way of jumping into the devils' den.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:36.021
And that's what has happened with people, that they never doubted anyone.

00:38:37.111 --> 00:38:39.776
And I don't know from where do people get these ideas

00:38:39.936 --> 00:38:42.239
everybody's life, even Christ,

00:38:43.133 --> 00:38:45.915
he too a hinter in His hand and He was whipping all the people.

00:38:48.794 --> 00:38:52.412
He was love, He was compassion, no doubt, but He did whip them,

00:38:53.323 --> 00:38:56.194
He also said that "don't throw pearls before the swines".

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:01.489
His compassion had a special purpose, which I will tell you just now, why

00:39:01.989 --> 00:39:03.989
He got himself crucified also,

00:39:04.239 --> 00:39:05.826
which is a very important thing,

00:39:06.201 --> 00:39:09.937
but when we just say that everything is fine, everything is good,

00:39:11.045 --> 00:39:13.577
the reason is we do not want to face the reality.

00:39:15.508 --> 00:39:19.184
Because, perhaps maybe we cannot understand

00:39:19.291 --> 00:39:20.932
that there could be anything bad,

00:39:21.969 --> 00:39:23.915
but after realization, you will discover

00:39:24.272 --> 00:39:26.272
that yourself there are problems,

00:39:27.112 --> 00:39:30.689
yourself there is something wrong with you, leave alone others!

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:34.337
There are problems within you which you have not seen and faced.

00:39:35.087 --> 00:39:39.226
Perhaps there are problems within you, which you have not wanted to see in others

00:39:39.547 --> 00:39:41.906
because then you will not be able to justify them.

00:39:42.441 --> 00:39:44.602
But after realization you get out of yourself.

00:39:44.977 --> 00:39:46.238
Like this sari I am wearing,

00:39:46.738 --> 00:39:48.236
if I am not identified with it,

00:39:48.736 --> 00:39:50.648
I see a spot I would like to clean it,

00:39:51.218 --> 00:39:52.636
I see it I want to clean it

00:39:53.049 --> 00:39:55.049
I don't say it is a good thing to have the spots there,

00:39:55.445 --> 00:39:57.445
but supposing I am identified, I'll hide it.

00:39:58.224 --> 00:40:00.675
I'll say, "oh, there's nothing, nothing wrong, everything is alright".

00:40:04.334 --> 00:40:06.614
There are evil doers, not one,

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.863
but so many these days, that you have not at all any idea, if you had

00:40:10.979 --> 00:40:12.416
you would not have lost so much.

00:40:15.132 --> 00:40:15.738
Beg pardon.

00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:25.798
Would you be able to just leave your questions till the end. Mataji will invite questions at the end.

00:40:25.809 --> 00:40:26.228
Alright?

00:40:29.189 --> 00:40:31.189
Now the thing is

00:40:31.689 --> 00:40:35.084
whatever happens to us in our consciousness,

00:40:36.038 --> 00:40:38.426
is only limited to our human awareness,

00:40:39.711 --> 00:40:41.833
whatever we see in our human awareness,

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.845
at the time when Krishna came, we got our human awareness,

00:40:46.078 --> 00:40:48.731
in that what do we have? only two points,

00:40:49.528 --> 00:40:52.863
one is our super ego, which is our conditioning,

00:40:53.625 --> 00:40:54.871
another is our ego,

00:40:55.528 --> 00:40:58.515
which we have achieved as a myth that

00:40:59.015 --> 00:41:03.170
we have done this, I am this, I am that, I like this, you like this.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.706
So we are only two things, either super ego, or ego.

00:41:08.986 --> 00:41:10.818
We wobble between the two.

00:41:11.055 --> 00:41:17.085
The third thing, which should be within us, is our spirit in the heart.

00:41:18.423 --> 00:41:23.704
And for that the central point is the point, by which we balance,

00:41:24.064 --> 00:41:27.190
between these two, between the desire and the action.

00:41:29.348 --> 00:41:35.302
We go on balancing in the center, by understanding what is the best.

00:41:35.366 --> 00:41:36.959
For example a person drinks a lot,

00:41:37.878 --> 00:41:39.271
he kills himself by drinking.

00:41:39.876 --> 00:41:41.876
He certainly not read any book

00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:44.913
to know that drinking is bad, he knows that this is bad

00:41:44.942 --> 00:41:46.905
his father is killed because of drinking, so

00:41:47.257 --> 00:41:53.988
he takes a life which is very much with moderation towards it.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.186
You start learning by so many experiences,

00:41:57.686 --> 00:42:01.960
right and wrong, how to be in the centre, that's all you can learn with human awarenes,

00:42:02.146 --> 00:42:04.614
if you can only learn how to be in the centre.

00:42:07.173 --> 00:42:09.364
Now, you have to go beyond this human awareness

00:42:10.334 --> 00:42:11.864
to be the awareness of the spirit,

00:42:13.219 --> 00:42:15.325
and when you become the awareness of the spirit,

00:42:16.209 --> 00:42:17.580
that you should become

00:42:18.307 --> 00:42:21.312
that you should ask for, that should be our goal,

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:26.117
when you become that then the whole picture becomes different.

00:42:27.315 --> 00:42:30.285
Because you can feel it yourself, and understand

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.372
what is right and wrong.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.665
On your vibratory awareness, which is a new dimension within you.

00:42:37.387 --> 00:42:41.395
Even children. Say, take ten children who are realized souls.

00:42:42.139 --> 00:42:44.366
If you ask them what is the matter with another person,

00:42:46.506 --> 00:42:49.204
they will immediately raise the same finger and say this is the matter.

00:42:50.158 --> 00:42:52.297
And you ask the person "have you got a very bad

00:42:52.325 --> 00:42:54.797
cold, cough or something bronchitis", and he will say, "yes".

00:42:57.618 --> 00:43:00.584
If this hand is shows that means all the left side,

00:43:00.752 --> 00:43:02.628
that means he suffering from emotional trouble.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.963
You do not know anything about your chakras at all before realization.

00:43:09.191 --> 00:43:11.661
One must accept this one has to accept

00:43:12.004 --> 00:43:15.208
whatever it is there is nothing wrong in it, it is only your ego which stops that,

00:43:15.376 --> 00:43:16.126
not accepting.

00:43:18.092 --> 00:43:21.104
And then once you get your realization you start feeling your

00:43:21.604 --> 00:43:24.839
different centres, you start feeling it actually you start feeling it

00:43:25.614 --> 00:43:28.014
and you start feeling the centres of others.

00:43:28.462 --> 00:43:31.682
Anyone who wants to know whether this person is evil or not

00:43:31.781 --> 00:43:33.348
is only to ask the question

00:43:33.447 --> 00:43:36.491
and you can feel it, you can't even bear some of those,

00:43:37.933 --> 00:43:39.580
horrible vibrations you get from people.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.556
Some of the Sahaja yogis try for

00:43:43.405 --> 00:43:45.630
asking for some devilish people and they got

00:43:45.676 --> 00:43:48.240
actual blisters, especially Mr. Hitler,

00:43:48.478 --> 00:43:49.439
whom you are supporting now.

00:43:53.255 --> 00:43:56.376
actual blisters on a finger, actual blisters.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.753
This is what it is. After realization

00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:03.322
your real absolute self comes in because you become spirit

00:44:03.421 --> 00:44:04.293
which is in the heart.

00:44:06.189 --> 00:44:07.649
The spirit resides in the heart

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.550
but this is the place of its' seat.

00:44:10.631 --> 00:44:12.050
There are seven seats in the head,

00:44:12.986 --> 00:44:15.804
and the seat of the spirit is here.

00:44:15.955 --> 00:44:18.746
When the Kundalini goes, it is just a very

00:44:19.071 --> 00:44:22.225
small thread of Kundalini rises because there are lots of problems

00:44:22.481 --> 00:44:25.946
and a very small through the Brahma nadi, the centre most

00:44:26.324 --> 00:44:29.456
channel, which rises and opens this

00:44:29.642 --> 00:44:31.872
when it opens it the grace comes down,

00:44:32.372 --> 00:44:33.757
and when the grace comes down

00:44:34.257 --> 00:44:37.140
you get completely relaxed, because it falls on the both the sides

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:43.388
on the ida and pingala nadi, which are manifesting our left and right
sympathetic nervous system.

00:44:45.598 --> 00:44:49.343
By which you first feel relaxed, thoughtless, and then

00:44:49.634 --> 00:44:51.634
when it is little bit established

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.594
you start feeling the cool breeze,

00:44:53.698 --> 00:44:56.094
because your spirit has started manifesting

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.615
and you just feel a cool breeze,

00:44:59.115 --> 00:45:00.624
like a wind coming into you.

00:45:01.124 --> 00:45:03.124
First you may feel tingling, heat,

00:45:03.188 --> 00:45:04.437
all that is going out,

00:45:04.518 --> 00:45:07.656
sometimes people a little bit shake also, because if the nerves are not

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.896
properly built up,

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.465
if they do not have the strength to bear it,

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:17.630
then it sometimes happens that you shake a little bit, doesn't matter.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:20.163
after some time you start sustaining it.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.730
It takes time in some people

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:25.230
in some people it doesn't take time at all.

00:45:25.922 --> 00:45:29.869
It is the quality of your central path of Sushumna is important.

00:45:30.369 --> 00:45:33.648
If it is very simple,

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.079
there is no problem, then the Kundalini takes no time

00:45:37.163 --> 00:45:39.579
She is anxiously waiting, She is your mother,

00:45:40.533 --> 00:45:43.353
She is the pure desire within you, the power

00:45:43.504 --> 00:45:45.749
to become one with your spirit.

00:45:46.703 --> 00:45:49.420
Unless and until you achieve it, whatever you may try,

00:45:49.519 --> 00:45:51.800
you do anything you like, you spoil your Sushumna,

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.938
but you'll have to get it otherwise your seeking will not be over,

00:45:56.787 --> 00:45:59.425
you have to reach the place where you should say "I have found it."

00:46:00.204 --> 00:46:03.231
If you have not found the spirit,

00:46:03.731 --> 00:46:07.476
you will never be happy with anything sort of thing you do.

00:46:08.412 --> 00:46:11.008
Anything you do. Be kind to yourself.

00:46:11.508 --> 00:46:14.590
Be gracious to yourself and get your realization.

00:46:14.846 --> 00:46:17.507
This is the simple thing as a mother I would like to tell you.

00:46:18.653 --> 00:46:21.646
There is nothing to be done except by getting realisation.

00:46:22.006 --> 00:46:23.353
But if you are an adamant person,

00:46:23.853 --> 00:46:26.486
and if you are employed by some of the gurus to come here,

00:46:26.846 --> 00:46:28.597
or you are running a

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:32.176
lawyers job for other gurus and all that, you cannot get realization.

00:46:33.078 --> 00:46:35.904
I am sorry if you cannot get it, I cannot help it.

00:46:36.252 --> 00:46:38.499
But you have to identify with yourself

00:46:38.737 --> 00:46:40.737
and see to it that you want to have it

00:46:40.905 --> 00:46:43.855
then only you will get it, if you do not have a desire to have it

00:46:44.075 --> 00:46:46.357
you will not get it, at any cost.

00:46:47.381 --> 00:46:49.006
You are not to be forced into it,

00:46:49.286 --> 00:46:51.500
your freedom is completely respected.

00:46:52.927 --> 00:46:55.762
If your freedom is not respected, how are you going to enjoy

00:46:55.826 --> 00:46:57.561
the freedom of your spirit.

00:46:58.148 --> 00:47:02.751
So it is completely in your hands, to be free

00:47:02.971 --> 00:47:06.124
to accept, whether to get realization or not.

00:47:06.641 --> 00:47:09.828
Now this chakra of Vishudhi is very important

00:47:10.783 --> 00:47:14.473
because there are sixteen sub-plexuses which are looked after by it,

00:47:14.571 --> 00:47:16.571
for example ear, nose, throat,

00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:22.674
all these things are looked after by this centre of Shri Krishna,

00:47:24.188 --> 00:47:29.469
and this centre has got two sides, one is the left, and one is the right side,

00:47:31.507 --> 00:47:35.156
I have to talk about it because most of the people in the West

00:47:35.429 --> 00:47:37.922
somehow suffer from the left Vishudhi,

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:40.422
one of them is the reason maybe smoking,

00:47:41.586 --> 00:47:45.294
right is more affected by smoking, but later on it goes to the left also.

00:47:46.021 --> 00:47:48.653
But I think. The more important is that,

00:47:49.468 --> 00:47:52.665
you people have developed a theory, I don't know how,

00:47:52.973 --> 00:47:55.132
that you have to be guilty for everything.

00:47:55.894 --> 00:47:57.894
Maybe it is from your childhood,

00:47:58.674 --> 00:48:02.192
you are brought up this way, don't spoil the carpet, don't spoil that,

00:48:02.377 --> 00:48:04.377
don't do this and don't do that,

00:48:04.667 --> 00:48:08.228
maybe your confessions in the churches maybe, I don't know what to blame

00:48:08.518 --> 00:48:13.632
but it is a very good indulgence for people to sit down "so I shouldn’t have done this

00:48:13.677 --> 00:48:17.379
I should not have done that" criticizing yourself and analyzing yourself.

00:48:19.645 --> 00:48:23.020
This is also a very good escape of egoistical people.

00:48:24.726 --> 00:48:27.664
They are egoistical they dominate others,

00:48:27.832 --> 00:48:30.026
and then they sit down and weep on their left Vishudhi.

00:48:31.103 --> 00:48:33.611
This left Vishudhi is such a dangerous thing,

00:48:34.356 --> 00:48:38.358
that it creates problems of the worst nature in human beings.

00:48:38.858 --> 00:48:42.271
For example, if you have say,

00:48:42.771 --> 00:48:44.771
any cancerous growth within you

00:48:45.009 --> 00:48:48.651
and if you have left Vishudhi, it is going to be difficult to cure you.

00:48:49.215 --> 00:48:53.446
Because the escape of the Kundalini has to be through the Vishudhi chakra,

00:48:53.539 --> 00:48:58.258
and the Vishudhi chakra on left hand side is very

00:48:58.308 --> 00:49:02.018
important for the escape of all these tensions of the cancer.

00:49:02.143 --> 00:49:06.036
And if you have this kind of a bad habit of sitting down and indulging

00:49:06.086 --> 00:49:10.155
into this kind of a nonsensical thing, like sitting down like Lord Byron

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:15.123
and reading some sort of a tragedy and making it a tragedy out of you, it is a drama going on!

00:49:15.223 --> 00:49:19.322
What is there to be tragic about you? What is wrong with you?

00:49:19.422 --> 00:49:23.674
You are very rich people, you have everything, still why do you want to cry and weep

00:49:23.749 --> 00:49:27.338
all the time you are in a crying mood, why? God has given you so much.

00:49:28.366 --> 00:49:32.097
do you ever said that, count your blessings one by one?

00:49:32.693 --> 00:49:36.613
How many blessings you have got? You don't know. You are specially blessed people, especially

00:49:36.688 --> 00:49:40.650
in this Australia, I think you are specially blessed. But you want to show that you are

00:49:40.725 --> 00:49:44.238
extremely miserable. The worst at this are the French I would say.

00:49:44.342 --> 00:49:46.155
Because when I went to France, they said,

00:49:46.322 --> 00:49:49.646
"Mother never say that you are a happy person because they will think you are not sensitive",

00:49:49.875 --> 00:49:50.841
I said, "Really?",

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:56.727
you think this French are very sensitive people, to what?

00:49:57.102 --> 00:49:58.173
Not to holiness,

00:49:59.944 --> 00:50:00.918
not to purity,

00:50:01.418 --> 00:50:05.031
they are sensitive to God knows what. Ten feet you walk and you find a prostitute

00:50:05.114 --> 00:50:06.040
standing on the road,

00:50:07.623 --> 00:50:11.432
and about ten feet you walk and you find three alcoholics lying on the street,

00:50:11.786 --> 00:50:14.760
these are sensitive people? Are they sensitive to their spirit?

00:50:14.906 --> 00:50:17.588
What are they sensitive to? And what are the crying about?

00:50:17.817 --> 00:50:20.443
This a very good thing that in the night you drink a lot,

00:50:20.651 --> 00:50:23.215
sleep with ten women and in the morning you feel guilty.

00:50:25.507 --> 00:50:28.110
Who has asked them to go into this kind of a mess

00:50:28.277 --> 00:50:32.561
and then to come and sit down and cry "Oh I'm so guilty, I have done so wrong and so wrong."

00:50:33.874 --> 00:50:37.269
That is why I have to talk about it, that this centre,

00:50:37.415 --> 00:50:41.461
is very important also because it is the sister of Shri Krishna,

00:50:41.524 --> 00:50:43.128
Vishnumaya who rules it.

00:50:44.128 --> 00:50:46.128
The relationship between brother and sister

00:50:46.295 --> 00:50:49.403
is absolutely gone haven in this country.

00:50:49.611 --> 00:50:50.938
In all the Western countries,

00:50:51.126 --> 00:50:53.126
for us Indians we do not understand,

00:50:53.272 --> 00:50:54.599
really we cannot understand.

00:50:54.932 --> 00:50:57.310
And we cannot explain what it is, the other day only

00:50:57.435 --> 00:50:58.993
we had a very interesting talk,

00:50:59.097 --> 00:51:01.097
because two Indians have come with me, very

00:51:01.264 --> 00:51:02.649
very great Sahaja yogis they are,

00:51:02.982 --> 00:51:04.560
they said "Mother, why did you say

00:51:04.664 --> 00:51:07.757
why did they said, that the girl cannot hold the hand of a girl?"

00:51:09.195 --> 00:51:12.452
I said, "you won't understand." They said, "no, no, but we would like know,

00:51:12.515 --> 00:51:15.452
we went to say we should close all our girls' schools

00:51:15.473 --> 00:51:16.757
girls schools in India?

00:51:17.257 --> 00:51:20.853
I mean a girl can easily hold the hand of a girl, it is much better."	

00:51:20.895 --> 00:51:21.624
I said " why

00:51:21.854 --> 00:51:25.098
this people say, you see is rather difficult for you to understand."

00:51:25.509 --> 00:51:27.509
Now, he said, "but one thing I can't understand

00:51:28.009 --> 00:51:33.506
that if a girl holds the hand of a man will that be a holier relationship?"

00:51:34.823 --> 00:51:35.697
See the accept.

00:51:37.301 --> 00:51:38.749
They think will it be holy

00:51:39.811 --> 00:51:41.811
to hold the hand of a man, it won't be.

00:51:43.722 --> 00:51:45.530
But the girl is a holy relationships.

00:51:46.189 --> 00:51:48.189
To this holy relationship is lost,

00:51:48.954 --> 00:51:52.180
in the so called ventures of the brains, you see

00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:55.551
like, you see if you go and see

00:51:56.444 --> 00:51:58.860
the zoo. If there is a wombat,

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.617
it behaves like a wombat, you see,

00:52:02.117 --> 00:52:04.351
if there is a monkey, it behaves like a monkey,

00:52:04.681 --> 00:52:07.761
if there is a tiger, it behaves like a tiger,

00:52:08.081 --> 00:52:09.816
but a human being if you put him in the zoo,

00:52:11.112 --> 00:52:13.738
you will see, he will eat up all the fruits,

00:52:14.142 --> 00:52:18.299
he will cut down all the trees, he will go to all the depths of it,

00:52:18.629 --> 00:52:22.511
and he will break his nose, he will lose his ears,

00:52:22.629 --> 00:52:26.408
he will spoil his eyes, he cannot sit quietly.

00:52:27.672 --> 00:52:30.559
You will give him a tree, he will eat the fruit,

00:52:32.524 --> 00:52:34.203
he will eat the seed

00:52:34.416 --> 00:52:36.289
he will have a bark inside himself,

00:52:36.418 --> 00:52:38.312
he will have all the roots inside himself,

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.766
he will do whatever is possible, it's so horrid with this brain the way it is moving,

00:52:42.905 --> 00:52:45.457
all the time in this direction, that direction, that direction

00:52:45.649 --> 00:52:47.649
it wants to bang on all the sights.

00:52:48.032 --> 00:52:48.504
For what?

00:52:49.757 --> 00:52:52.537
it cannot sit right, you see, when he is sitting

00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:56.678
for five minutes he thinks it is a jail, it is so boring,

00:52:56.743 --> 00:52:58.954
so he must go and do something very important.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.264
And what is the important thing he does?

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:03.350
Is to really ruin himself.

00:53:03.765 --> 00:53:06.876
He must go to a pub, he must go to a friend,

00:53:07.153 --> 00:53:08.460
he must go somewhere

00:53:08.578 --> 00:53:11.128
he will really ruin himself for his holiness

00:53:11.225 --> 00:53:12.855
and all his sense of self esteem.

00:53:14.607 --> 00:53:17.956
That's why we have no sense as to what is a sister.

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:21.072
the relationship of a sister with other women.

00:53:22.209 --> 00:53:27.729
This is so much missing that to talk about it in England was impossible; they said this is a Victorian

00:53:27.772 --> 00:53:29.368
even an early lady talking

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:32.772
you see, they brand it, you are Victorian, you are Georgian

00:53:32.856 --> 00:53:36.285
or you are...anyway everything moves according to the kings that rule that

00:53:36.444 --> 00:53:37.267
horrible England

00:53:37.437 --> 00:53:40.365
and the kings themselves being so horrible,

00:53:41.848 --> 00:53:44.692
and the kings themselves were such horrible things.

00:53:44.779 --> 00:53:46.779
I mean. I don't know how they were for them.

00:53:46.945 --> 00:53:50.250
So you are branded a Georgian or this or that,

00:53:50.337 --> 00:53:53.669
whatever you say, they cannot see the integration of anything,

00:53:53.776 --> 00:53:57.724
they just, one center they will catch "oh this is absolutely Victorian",

00:53:57.851 --> 00:54:00.585
I said "alright, doesn't matter, but is good

00:54:01.282 --> 00:54:04.810
whether you like it or not". As if Victorian everything to be condemned,

00:54:05.074 --> 00:54:07.074
there must be something good about it also.

00:54:07.574 --> 00:54:10.609
This is how the whole outlook is of the people

00:54:10.657 --> 00:54:13.492
all the time trying to brand others, what about yourself?

00:54:14.149 --> 00:54:16.366
What brand are you to give to yourself?

00:54:16.493 --> 00:54:18.493
That's the point nobody wants to see.

00:54:18.639 --> 00:54:19.968
What brand am I?

00:54:20.566 --> 00:54:23.771
What is my brand? I’m a brat. That's what you are.

00:54:24.035 --> 00:54:26.930
You see, sometimes I feel so many people the way they think

00:54:27.253 --> 00:54:31.087
they have no sense, like in the night like nocturnal animals would

00:54:31.253 --> 00:54:33.154
dash into that and that into that,

00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:37.172
that's how they have broken themselves completely like mad, for what?

00:54:38.242 --> 00:54:40.816
Keep quiet. Be in the centre.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:45.331
You had to just wait, it was going to happen, this is your own,

00:54:45.414 --> 00:54:47.828
you are the people who are searching the truth,

00:54:47.932 --> 00:54:51.008
for which it is all created, the whole scene is there,

00:54:51.029 --> 00:54:54.529
you are just get it, why are you breaking everything that

00:54:54.654 --> 00:54:57.903
God has given you, it is such a beautiful being He has created,

00:54:58.052 --> 00:55:00.403
you are the most beautiful person,

00:55:00.903 --> 00:55:04.611
have you seen that when you go to the zoo all the animals are looking at you?

00:55:12.465 --> 00:55:15.022
In the same way they are looking forward to you,

00:55:15.855 --> 00:55:18.297
what have you got to give to them, I don't know.

00:55:19.818 --> 00:55:21.818
But once you have your realization

00:55:22.443 --> 00:55:26.174
then you will know the meaning of your being, then you will know what you are.

00:55:26.382 --> 00:55:28.382
And this is what one has to establish.

00:55:29.257 --> 00:55:32.042
We have really done lots of wrongs to ourselves

00:55:32.334 --> 00:55:34.748
by not understanding really, self estimation.

00:55:36.831 --> 00:55:39.395
One must know that you are a diamond,

00:55:40.749 --> 00:55:42.749
that you are the spirit,

00:55:43.374 --> 00:55:46.347
that you have to rise into the Kingdom of God,

00:55:46.847 --> 00:55:49.496
you are specially made for this purpose,

00:55:51.579 --> 00:55:54.062
right royal people you are,

00:55:54.208 --> 00:55:56.861
that you have to climbed up there, instead of that

00:55:56.944 --> 00:55:59.454
you are lost into your egos and super egos

00:55:59.537 --> 00:56:03.829
and frantically what you are doing is completely destroying

00:56:03.892 --> 00:56:05.892
all the chances of your ascent

00:56:06.059 --> 00:56:09.084
which is so easily to be done. It is such a living force

00:56:09.584 --> 00:56:13.746
which is going to work out, it is not going to harm you in any way

00:56:14.017 --> 00:56:16.163
it is for you only,

00:56:16.476 --> 00:56:20.147
it is all there, it is Sahaja, it is within you, it is spontaneous,

00:56:20.355 --> 00:56:23.888
and it is going to work out, only thing we have to know

00:56:23.951 --> 00:56:26.923
that you have not to treat yourself so shabbily

00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:29.994
and with such hatred towards yourself.

00:56:31.307 --> 00:56:34.590
There is no need to have such a low opinion about yourself.

00:56:35.965 --> 00:56:41.668
This is the left side, the right side of course is of the people who talk big,

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:45.674
you see, who say this

00:56:47.049 --> 00:56:50.474
who say, the great politicians, things who just

00:56:50.537 --> 00:56:54.430
talk down people, when they speak they just dominate

00:56:54.472 --> 00:56:57.749
and by their speech they control people.

00:56:58.666 --> 00:57:03.035
This centre, right side people have who are hot tempered and

00:57:03.202 --> 00:57:07.443
who lose temper and frighten people with their tempers, you see, they say such horrible things

00:57:07.464 --> 00:57:10.798
that people are just frightened of them and just to keep them quiet

00:57:10.881 --> 00:57:12.005
they manage somehow.

00:57:12.505 --> 00:57:14.609
This type of people have the right Vishudhi

00:57:14.692 --> 00:57:19.055
they also have when they have the colds, coughs and all that it is a balance come to them,

00:57:19.222 --> 00:57:23.957
when they have to talk too much also they have to have this problem of right Vishudhi

00:57:24.457 --> 00:57:25.989
and sometimes some people

00:57:26.052 --> 00:57:27.820
suddenly lose their voices, you see

00:57:28.074 --> 00:57:32.312
when they talk too much also they lose voices because the balance is created within them.

00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.768
Now the centre one is of Shri Khrishna.

00:57:36.997 --> 00:57:41.398
Shri Krishna is the one who creates the witness within us,

00:57:41.586 --> 00:57:44.845
He is the one who refuted all kinds of

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:49.277
formal ritualistic things in religion.

00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.208
But He didn't become a hippie, that's one thing one should understand,

00:57:52.479 --> 00:57:54.479
that He didn't go to another extreme.

00:57:54.687 --> 00:57:58.589
You see when He said that all these junks and formal things that are there,

00:57:59.381 --> 00:58:03.022
He didn't say that you take to drugs, another nonsensical formal thing,

00:58:03.522 --> 00:58:06.673
He said that if you have to get over these things,

00:58:06.965 --> 00:58:08.965
you have to see it as a drama,

00:58:09.173 --> 00:58:12.591
the whole thing is a joke going on, it is a drama going on,

00:58:12.883 --> 00:58:15.355
but for that you have to become,

00:58:15.522 --> 00:58:19.540
it's not a question of your achieving it by rational thinking,

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:22.879
you have to go beyond your mind to achieve it,

00:58:23.087 --> 00:58:26.120
and that going beyond is done by the Kundalini.

00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:30.077
Now He did not do it does not mean He was not in it,

00:58:30.119 --> 00:58:34.013
He was very much there, like a painting you have first you have the background,

00:58:34.305 --> 00:58:37.377
then you have another color, then you have your third color,

00:58:37.481 --> 00:58:39.836
now the fourth color, and now the time has come

00:58:40.107 --> 00:58:42.107
for the whole picture to be ready.

00:58:42.649 --> 00:58:46.792
Everybody has played their part, a very important part in our evolution,

00:58:47.292 --> 00:58:49.774
everyone is needed, among you may be many

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:52.170
who might be having a problem with Shri Krishna

00:58:53.191 --> 00:58:55.965
especially Hare Rama Hare Krishna people, they suffer

00:58:56.090 --> 00:58:59.034
mostly from throat cancers, you can go and find out.

00:58:59.388 --> 00:59:02.541
Because they go against Shri Krishna,

00:59:02.791 --> 00:59:06.046
by taking His name so vainly on Oxford street, they will stand

00:59:06.088 --> 00:59:08.088
with those things they get in the market,

00:59:08.276 --> 00:59:10.867
put them here, attached it here, and go on dancing.

00:59:11.638 --> 00:59:14.060
Making mockery out of Shri Krishna's dignity

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:18.672
like that and apart from that they take a name unauthorized.

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.900
Who has given them authority to take the name of Shri Krishna?

00:59:23.317 --> 00:59:25.126
They spoil this chakra doubly

00:59:25.168 --> 00:59:28.268
because if you take to mantras you spoil left Vishudhi very badly.

00:59:29.414 --> 00:59:32.058
All those who have taken these so-called mantras

00:59:33.246 --> 00:59:34.873
have spoiled their left Vishudhi,

00:59:35.873 --> 00:59:41.238
because these mantras are not like one mantra to someone.

00:59:41.446 --> 00:59:44.573
I mean, are we only one chakra, or part of a chakras?

00:59:45.406 --> 00:59:48.006
And that too like Tinga means this,

00:59:48.214 --> 00:59:50.867
and all these things, where are they within us?

00:59:53.784 --> 00:59:55.784
They ran short of the names I think

00:59:55.867 --> 00:59:58.774
so they started getting hold of any names that they felt like,

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:01.709
or they were sinister to give such horrible names to you.

01:00:01.959 --> 01:00:03.959
Left Vishudhi you catch so badly.

01:00:04.459 --> 01:00:07.615
Mostly people who take to mantras you will find when they speak

01:00:07.886 --> 01:00:12.216
their lower jaw moves like this, they have difficulty in talking.

01:00:13.154 --> 01:00:14.525
They cannot talk properly.

01:00:16.483 --> 01:00:18.145
This is one of the things you will find with them

01:00:18.645 --> 01:00:22.458
they have pain in the left hand side, they have pain at the back,

01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:29.951
this is the beginning of it. Any mantra given to you has to have logical meaning.

01:00:30.076 --> 01:00:33.355
It's a big science of mantra, it is not something nonsensical,

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:35.855
that you come here, I will give you a flower, finished.

01:00:36.001 --> 01:00:38.211
It is a big science, you see how many deities there are.

01:00:39.524 --> 01:00:43.920
You must know where the problem is, it is like a Kundalini

01:00:44.795 --> 01:00:49.336
rising in its living power you know that here is an obstruction,

01:00:49.711 --> 01:00:52.758
and you want to get rid of that obstruction, then you say there

01:00:53.071 --> 01:00:55.071
the password, and you pass trough

01:00:55.425 --> 01:00:58.729
but then Kundalini has not started, what is the use of having a mantra?

01:00:59.875 --> 01:01:01.648
The Kundalini is frozen out there,

01:01:02.481 --> 01:01:05.944
and you are saying a mantra for a chakra, now it would be something like this,

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:08.090
"that I am frozen in England"

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:10.590
and I'm saying a password for a bridge here.

01:01:12.923 --> 01:01:16.571
It is absurd. Because you are so naive about it,

01:01:17.467 --> 01:01:19.024
our Indian modern

01:01:19.087 --> 01:01:22.342
people also who think they are very westernized and sophisticated,

01:01:22.842 --> 01:01:24.842
they also are equally naive,

01:01:25.342 --> 01:01:27.784
they don't want to read anything about the scriptures,

01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:29.656
they are not translated in English

01:01:30.656 --> 01:01:32.656
they do not know anything about mantra Vidya

01:01:33.571 --> 01:01:35.240
the mantra has to be

01:01:35.365 --> 01:01:38.804
connected with your development in your Kundalini.

01:01:38.888 --> 01:01:40.888
Not only that, but it should relate

01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:42.458
to the movement of the Kundalini.

01:01:43.896 --> 01:01:46.504
It should be given by a person who is a realized soul.

01:01:47.296 --> 01:01:50.731
Jagrut, awakened, mantra has to be awakened.

01:01:52.585 --> 01:01:57.316
And that you will find in Sahaja Yoga that it is such a temporary thing.

01:01:57.816 --> 01:02:01.936
For example, the Kundalini is stopping at this point, now what is the mantra for this point,

01:02:03.103 --> 01:02:08.074
Lord's prayer, or "I forgive", to make it shorter.

01:02:08.741 --> 01:02:13.035
That is the weapon Christ has given us of forgiveness, at this point,

01:02:13.264 --> 01:02:14.430
which stops your thinking.

01:02:14.763 --> 01:02:18.279
If any Dick, Tom and Harry cannot do it, you have to have realization first,

01:02:18.425 --> 01:02:22.527
then only because the Kundalini has reached there, you know that it is stopping there

01:02:22.569 --> 01:02:25.367
then you have to say that, alright, this is Lord's Prayer,

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:26.810
you say Lord's Prayer, it opens out.

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:29.533
What is the mantra over here?

01:02:30.033 --> 01:02:33.156
It's Allah Akbar, you put these fingers are of this center,

01:02:33.427 --> 01:02:36.809
put them here and say "Allah Akbar" three times, it will open out

01:02:37.892 --> 01:02:41.650
But you have to be a realized soul, to begin with or the one who is telling you has to be a realized soul.

01:02:41.963 --> 01:02:45.930
There has to be some authority from God, not from theological college or anything.

01:02:46.909 --> 01:02:51.509
It is a mockery, to get knowledge of God in a theological college.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.134
I mean you must enter into the Kingdom of God

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.280
to know what He is, what He is like,

01:02:57.530 --> 01:03:00.868
what is His whole vidya, His knowledge.

01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:04.306
Divine knowledge is very different from the knowledge you have.

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:06.642
Have you ever known that this is the Vishudhi chakra before?

01:03:12.392 --> 01:03:14.624
You have never known this before, it is not written anywhere.

01:03:16.207 --> 01:03:18.713
Some things had to be told by me also,

01:03:19.046 --> 01:03:21.046
so this was left for me to be told.

01:03:22.629 --> 01:03:23.903
Now this chakra,

01:03:25.653 --> 01:03:29.319
of Vishudhi chakra, gives you the witness state

01:03:29.611 --> 01:03:32.571
that Krishna has described that you become the sakshi

01:03:32.696 --> 01:03:34.924
I would like you to also listen to my tape

01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:37.472
on Shri Krishna which is very good,

01:03:37.805 --> 01:03:44.195
recently I spoke about Him in a very detailed manner about Gita also.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:48.012
You can have all these tapes brought down here to Melbourne,

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:52.678
and listen to them, but only listening to them is of no use

01:03:52.991 --> 01:03:57.007
is no use it will give you ideas and you will start behaving again in a funny way.

01:03:57.507 --> 01:04:02.000
I do not want you to make the same pickle out of me as you have pickled out
other people.

01:04:03.375 --> 01:04:06.931
Put it to practice. Because when I spoke in America

01:04:07.035 --> 01:04:08.212
they were all taping me down,

01:04:09.004 --> 01:04:11.503
and everybody said "Mother you should not allow them to tape

01:04:11.711 --> 01:04:15.518
because you see these are all writers and this and that and they will use your knowledge

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.464
and spread the thing, I said "let them do it,

01:04:18.485 --> 01:04:20.928
after all Kundalini I have to awaken, the cannot do it

01:04:20.949 --> 01:04:22.949
if they could do I would be very happy to sit down

01:04:23.178 --> 01:04:24.446
let them do it, I will be very happy."

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:28.746
Anybody who says that "why should you" I said "very good you come along and do it"

01:04:28.871 --> 01:04:30.871
I will be very happy to settle down,

01:04:31.121 --> 01:04:33.390
because I gain nothing, what is my gain?

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:42.539
Anybody who is willing to do it, I will be very happy to retire, absolutely.

01:04:42.602 --> 01:04:46.766
Because by God's grace I am a married woman, and very happily married,

01:04:46.891 --> 01:04:49.201
I have my own children and grand children,

01:04:49.451 --> 01:04:51.135
why should I bother my head,

01:04:51.218 --> 01:04:53.364
of going around the people travelling like this?

01:04:54.114 --> 01:04:59.560
Yesterday in Sydney, here in Melbourne today, again go back Sydney then to India, why should I do it?

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:00.791
For what?

01:05:02.979 --> 01:05:07.106
Only because I love, because I know this is my mission, I have to do it, I'm suppose to do it

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:09.606
this is the job I have,

01:05:09.856 --> 01:05:12.546
but if anybody else can do it I will be very happy for them to do it.

01:05:14.254 --> 01:05:19.244
Now when it comes to all these awakening, and all that,

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:21.348
it is the thing that happens to you,

01:05:22.577 --> 01:05:24.577
it is the thing that moves within you,

01:05:25.077 --> 01:05:28.323
and you have to feel the movement, it is not a blind lane

01:05:28.386 --> 01:05:32.244
where you just pay some money into a counter and say "now we are entering to the blind lane"

01:05:33.098 --> 01:05:34.099
And do what you like.

01:05:34.141 --> 01:05:37.333
Somebody says you jump, somebody says you do this and do that. Nothing.

01:05:37.354 --> 01:05:38.666
Everything is logical.

01:05:39.499 --> 01:05:41.205
First your Kundalini must arise,

01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:43.881
if it does not arise I cannot give you a certificate,

01:05:43.985 --> 01:05:48.008
you cannot give a certificate, nobody can give you a certificate, nothing artificial.

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:52.691
So in America when I went and told them all they had tape recorders and all that

01:05:53.608 --> 01:05:56.749
something bad has also come out of it, it is Born Again.

01:05:57.145 --> 01:05:59.821
All these things have come from there, only from my lectures.

01:06:00.425 --> 01:06:02.719
Because I told the Christians, when they called me,

01:06:02.927 --> 01:06:07.250
thinking they'd be Christians in the churches, you see they thought this is bonafide

01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:12.475
because I was baptized according to them, so I should be baptised by these people

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.600
so I'm alright, I was bonafide.

01:06:14.675 --> 01:06:16.330
They called me in the churches, you see

01:06:16.705 --> 01:06:18.705
and they also collected a collection for me,

01:06:18.755 --> 01:06:19.702
very interesting.

01:06:23.702 --> 01:06:27.529
But best part of it, some of them

01:06:27.579 --> 01:06:28.837
caught up certain words

01:06:28.887 --> 01:06:34.667
I said you are to be born again. You are to be born again, so they have got now a cult called Born Again, finished.

01:06:36.945 --> 01:06:40.018
It is very difficult to talk to these mad people,

01:06:40.093 --> 01:06:42.345
anything you tell them they make a cult out of it.

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.146
Anything you don't they want to pickle up,

01:06:44.271 --> 01:06:46.877
you see it is such a difficult thing with human beings.

01:06:46.927 --> 01:06:48.927
They don't want to take to reality,

01:06:49.052 --> 01:06:52.353
they want to have their ego everywhere asserting by which

01:06:52.453 --> 01:06:54.149
they pluck out all that is living

01:06:54.224 --> 01:06:58.320
and make that dead, ugly and say "this is mine, this is mine, this is mine."

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:04.148
Absurd. But this is what happens to us. Now about Christ,

01:07:06.648 --> 01:07:07.554
I think

01:07:10.079 --> 01:07:12.530
greatest message of Christ is His resurrection,

01:07:13.405 --> 01:07:17.686
this is resurrection, that He showed what Krishna has said in His lifetime,

01:07:18.186 --> 01:07:22.073
that the spirit doesn't die, it cannot be killed,

01:07:22.798 --> 01:07:28.769
it cannot be blown out, it has to rise, and it rises.

01:07:29.644 --> 01:07:32.452
Whatever you may try, it is eternal,

01:07:32.952 --> 01:07:36.042
and that is what Christ has proved by His resurrection.

01:07:36.542 --> 01:07:39.436
But by His resurrection He has achieved a great thing,

01:07:39.936 --> 01:07:41.266
which Hindus do not know

01:07:41.366 --> 01:07:44.651
and the Christians have not carried the message because they also do not know.

01:07:45.826 --> 01:07:47.826
But the greatest thing He has done,

01:07:48.201 --> 01:07:50.201
to our awareness is that,

01:07:50.426 --> 01:07:52.926
that if you pass through that centre

01:07:53.426 --> 01:07:57.077
your karmas are sucked, your sins are forgiven.

01:07:58.827 --> 01:08:01.173
This is the beauty He has created within us,

01:08:01.298 --> 01:08:05.751
by which our ego is sucked in self, He sucks in our ego, He is the sucker of our ego.

01:08:07.051 --> 01:08:10.827
And all the Christian nations are the greatest ego orientated people.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.845
It's very difficult to talk to them.

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.020
First thing they will do is to box your nose.

01:08:17.595 --> 01:08:18.888
If not crucify you.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:25.480
They are extremely aggressive people, extremely aggressive and very ignorant.

01:08:25.755 --> 01:08:27.755
They are so naive, so naive,

01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:29.089
In India

01:08:29.239 --> 01:08:32.372
it is not so difficult to talk to them because they know what is knowledge.

01:08:32.447 --> 01:08:36.469
I mean they know what is Kundalini, they know. They know what is the rising of the Kundalini,

01:08:36.494 --> 01:08:38.135
they know who can do this,

01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:44.565
it's not difficult to talk to them, because the people are so naive in spiritual life,

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:49.304
and then they are so ego orientated, despite the fact that Christ

01:08:49.452 --> 01:08:52.519
is the one who is the sucker of your ego,

01:08:52.633 --> 01:08:54.414
He is the one who sucks your ego,

01:08:54.459 --> 01:08:56.914
so there is no karmas after realization.

01:08:57.414 --> 01:09:02.219
You become the spirit, spirit does not have any karma, it is a myth,

01:09:02.887 --> 01:09:05.461
it is sucked and this is what Christ has done for us.

01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:09.265
So, when Christians, so called, came to India,

01:09:09.494 --> 01:09:13.258
they converted people in such a crude method

01:09:13.557 --> 01:09:15.557
by putting a loaf in a well

01:09:16.124 --> 01:09:20.722
which the poor Indians ate - they are naive as far as Christianity was concerned -

01:09:20.803 --> 01:09:23.003
they said this was the meat of the cows,

01:09:23.084 --> 01:09:25.084
you are all finished, you are Christians,

01:09:25.168 --> 01:09:27.584
so the whole village became Christians.

01:09:28.084 --> 01:09:32.114
Like that they tried all dirty tricks on Indians and they all became Christians

01:09:32.178 --> 01:09:34.178
so Indian Christians are the worst of all,

01:09:35.517 --> 01:09:39.927
poor things, they think they are so condemned forever, now they can never be reconverted,

01:09:40.007 --> 01:09:44.794
they can never be realized, they cannot be resurrected, they are doomed people,

01:09:45.294 --> 01:09:48.836
who have eaten the cows' meat, not they, but their forefathers might.

01:09:50.913 --> 01:09:52.320
It is such a wretched state.

01:09:54.062 --> 01:09:57.768
But if any realized soul had come

01:10:00.315 --> 01:10:03.112
they would have seen that this is what

01:10:03.159 --> 01:10:07.591
Christ was supposed to do, which is written in the Devi Bhagavatam,

01:10:09.064 --> 01:10:13.789
that He is the support of the universe.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.420
But the narrow visions of Christians

01:10:19.339 --> 01:10:23.491
and the narrow visions of Hindus, and the narrow visions of Muslims

01:10:24.813 --> 01:10:28.633
have made such a mess, that the time has come to get the whole picture,

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.393
the complete integration,

01:10:30.557 --> 01:10:33.397
of all these great incarnations, who are within you

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:35.662
and to understand them in reality,

01:10:35.826 --> 01:10:36.859
what they are,

01:10:36.923 --> 01:10:40.747
and becoming yourself such a wider personality as a collective being

01:10:43.244 --> 01:10:46.787
About Christ, I don't know, I must have spoken

01:10:47.975 --> 01:10:51.729
hours and hours, about Krishna I must have spoken for hours and hours.

01:10:52.095 --> 01:10:55.423
In England also we have got about 300 to 400 tapes

01:10:55.604 --> 01:10:58.472
on different subjects which you should get them and listen to them.

01:10:58.539 --> 01:11:03.268
But again do not make it a big library for you please

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:09.471
it is to be actualized, it is to be felt, it is to be practiced within yourself.

01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:13.009
It is not for giving you any big knowledges.

01:11:13.224 --> 01:11:20.636
We have a book called Advent, which is written by a French Sahaja yogi.

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:22.985
Which is a very beautiful book,

01:11:23.233 --> 01:11:26.961
but we do not sell it to people who are not realized, we do not,

01:11:27.461 --> 01:11:31.009
because it is very difficult for a person who is not realized to bear the truth,

01:11:31.509 --> 01:11:34.939
that is why they crucified Christ. That is why they tortured Mohammed.

01:11:35.053 --> 01:11:38.760
That is why they tortured all the saints, because they could not bear the truth,

01:11:38.857 --> 01:11:40.437
their ego could not bear it.

01:11:40.702 --> 01:11:43.820
So we do not give those books to people who are not realized,

01:11:44.253 --> 01:11:46.774
if you are realized then you can order for you a copy,

01:11:47.022 --> 01:11:49.577
you can get the book, but otherwise you cannot get it.

01:11:49.658 --> 01:11:53.575
I am sorry we have certain experiences,

01:11:53.622 --> 01:11:55.791
and we deal on those experiences

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:58.291
that unless and until human beings are realized

01:11:58.623 --> 01:12:01.194
they are not going to value the Divine life,

01:12:01.912 --> 01:12:04.214
they value anything else but their divinity,

01:12:05.402 --> 01:12:09.117
and here you do not pay a single pai, so there is no binding force.

01:12:09.147 --> 01:12:12.373
Like many people say, I said "why are you still doing these things?",

01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:15.009
they said "we have paid for it, so let us go through it",

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.140
even if it is hell you go through it?,

01:12:18.009 --> 01:12:21.267
that's the mentality. Now here there is nothing paid,

01:12:21.566 --> 01:12:24.210
there's on attachment, it is your freedom seeking

01:12:24.911 --> 01:12:27.650
which is the attachment, if you are really a seeker

01:12:27.965 --> 01:12:30.539
you will go deep into it and have the blessings,

01:12:30.989 --> 01:12:34.798
have the beauty of that spirit

01:12:35.097 --> 01:12:36.340
which is within you,

01:12:36.538 --> 01:12:39.840
which you can have. The time has come, this was the time was promised,

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:45.058
this was talked about in John's Revelation.

01:12:45.642 --> 01:12:50.834
Also in many of the Indian scriptures it is described.

01:12:51.552 --> 01:12:56.524
But the best is William Blake, who has described it very beautifully

01:12:57.443 --> 01:13:01.482
in his book called "Milton, even the place where I lived first,

01:13:01.646 --> 01:13:05.871
Surrey Hills, he has said, the first beacons will be lit in Surrey Hills,

01:13:06.086 --> 01:13:08.086
he has also said where our ashram is,

01:13:08.368 --> 01:13:13.037
that in the ruins of Lambeth Way, the foundations will be laid

01:13:13.285 --> 01:13:15.536
come to Lambeth Way and he says

01:13:15.650 --> 01:13:18.136
that it will be a Jerusalem one day

01:13:18.636 --> 01:13:20.636
England will be a Jerusalem

01:13:21.505 --> 01:13:22.606
That's what he has said

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.345
it is a very interesting book "Milton" if you can get

01:13:25.476 --> 01:13:28.300
hold of it please read it, it's all described

01:13:28.364 --> 01:13:30.364
He describes everything even the vibrations

01:13:30.679 --> 01:13:33.799
that Her looms vibrate the sinuous

01:13:34.635 --> 01:13:38.143
it's a Jerusalem now, because people come for Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:38.391 --> 01:13:40.391
There are some very good

01:13:40.891 --> 01:13:42.891
Muslims we have young people

01:13:42.988 --> 01:13:44.988
who just found in their own country

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.220
that fundamentalists are taking

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.277
the rule and they are behaving in such a fanatic manner

01:13:51.777 --> 01:13:53.342
they thought that if God is

01:13:53.372 --> 01:13:55.573
such a fanatic nonsense then better give Him up

01:13:56.073 --> 01:13:59.430
and they wanted to become communists and they have taken to communism

01:13:59.544 --> 01:14:00.219
to a point.

01:14:00.367 --> 01:14:04.398
When one of them came down to London and somehow he happened to come to us

01:14:04.663 --> 01:14:05.902
there he got his realization

01:14:06.721 --> 01:14:08.269
after realization he knew

01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:12.024
that it's one extreme is fanaticism, another extreme is deny of God

01:14:12.138 --> 01:14:14.138
God is there but in the center.

01:14:14.386 --> 01:14:19.403
He went back, he got 500 people realized who are Muslims

01:14:19.551 --> 01:14:21.035
and now they come to London

01:14:21.418 --> 01:14:23.553
his mother wanted to go to Mecca.

01:14:23.919 --> 01:14:25.242
Mecca is also

01:14:25.406 --> 01:14:28.030
according to us is a very great pilgrimage no doubt

01:14:28.178 --> 01:14:30.312
because Mohammed Sahib was really very great

01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:32.896
and he was the incarnation of Primordial Master

01:14:32.943 --> 01:14:34.943
which can be proved on your Kundalini.

01:14:35.594 --> 01:14:38.308
All things that I'm saying can be proved on your Kundalini

01:14:38.573 --> 01:14:41.810
and you can see for yourselves absolutely practical for you to see.

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:44.642
Now when he came to

01:14:45.142 --> 01:14:48.453
his mother wanted to come go to Mecca she told

01:14:49.473 --> 01:14:51.205
that now why I do want to go to Mecca

01:14:51.261 --> 01:14:53.873
now Mecca has shifted to London, better go to London

01:14:54.943 --> 01:14:56.943
that's what it is one has to realize

01:14:57.443 --> 01:15:00.144
that when we talk of anyone

01:15:00.292 --> 01:15:03.071
like Christ or Moses or Abraham

01:15:03.303 --> 01:15:07.178
or Mohammad or anyone, you should know they are all related to each other.

01:15:08.114 --> 01:15:10.732
While we are identified with one or the other.

01:15:11.467 --> 01:15:15.495
Let us identify ourselves with all of them to understanding of Kundalini

01:15:15.592 --> 01:15:17.916
you'll be amazed, when the Kundalini rises,

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:20.821
if somebody's a Muslim he has to take the name of Nanaka

01:15:20.868 --> 01:15:22.868
otherwise the Kundalini doesn't rise.

01:15:23.368 --> 01:15:26.807
All the fanatics have to give up their fanaticism

01:15:26.871 --> 01:15:28.435
before the Kundalini rises.

01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:31.261
And even if their Kundalini rises and gives them realization

01:15:31.392 --> 01:15:34.017
then again suck back into their fanatic paunches

01:15:34.232 --> 01:15:37.370
So all these things will only disappear,

01:15:37.417 --> 01:15:39.283
all these relative things will disappear

01:15:39.431 --> 01:15:42.551
as soon as you find your absolute, that is your spirit.

01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:47.432
About the spirit, I'm sorry I cannot talk in such a small time,

01:15:47.714 --> 01:15:51.636
but there's a very good tape on Sat-Chit-Anand,

01:15:51.733 --> 01:15:54.358
is that is the spirit and it's best is

01:15:55.043 --> 01:15:58.243
to listen to that because I would

01:15:58.491 --> 01:16:00.997
do no honor to your spirit if I

01:16:01.161 --> 01:16:03.719
just finish it in two minutes or three minutes like that.

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.469
It's a very wide subject and very beautiful.

01:16:06.566 --> 01:16:09.569
Most enjoyable to know about your own spirit,

01:16:09.633 --> 01:16:11.633
about yourself, that, truly you are

01:16:11.915 --> 01:16:14.567
not this body, not this mind, not this ego.

01:16:14.731 --> 01:16:16.731
Neither these conditionings and these

01:16:16.812 --> 01:16:20.448
old ideas you have, conceptions. You are what you are.

01:16:21.401 --> 01:16:22.386
Thank you very much.

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.540
Now I'm going away to India

01:16:25.603 --> 01:16:28.624
on the 8th, and tomorrow there's a good program

01:16:29.627 --> 01:16:34.204
in Sydney and 8th I'll be leaving up and

01:16:34.285 --> 01:16:37.575
then I'll be in India for a short time and going back to London.

01:16:37.773 --> 01:16:39.773
Maybe next year I'll be coming here.

01:16:39.904 --> 01:16:42.767
I would request you that you must attend your

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:44.864
collective programs because

01:16:45.179 --> 01:16:47.463
the message of Sahaja Yoga is collectivity.

01:16:47.611 --> 01:16:49.778
If you take my photograph and meditate at home

01:16:49.842 --> 01:16:53.209
after some time you'll find you'll lose vibrations. You will not grow.

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:55.292
You have to grow collectively.

01:16:55.521 --> 01:16:56.527
It's very important

01:16:57.178 --> 01:17:00.590
that all of you should grow together collectively.

01:17:00.771 --> 01:17:02.283
Collectiveness must be developed

01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:05.364
otherwise you must work it out, how it works on others

01:17:05.461 --> 01:17:09.280
and how you cures others and how you help others, is to be seen.

01:17:09.612 --> 01:17:11.612
Some people will be coming from Melbourne,

01:17:11.642 --> 01:17:13.642
or from Sydney to Melbourne,

01:17:13.974 --> 01:17:16.864
in the beginning till you understand Sahaja Yoga

01:17:17.129 --> 01:17:18.451
and then they will go away.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.042
Of course there is no money, nothing involved as you see,

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.240
we have started in a very small way.

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:27.260
Now when next time I come

01:17:27.341 --> 01:17:29.171
I'm sure Melbourne will be

01:17:29.268 --> 01:17:31.268
a seed of very good Sahaja yogis.

01:17:32.506 --> 01:17:34.506
Not doubting, but understanding,

01:17:34.939 --> 01:17:36.939
doubting doesn't give you much chance,

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:39.120
you see, what is there to doubt, is nothing but

01:17:39.284 --> 01:17:40.916
your ego is doubting something.

01:17:41.148 --> 01:17:45.458
There's nothing to doubt, just come and see this is a new university into which you have entered,

01:17:45.488 --> 01:17:47.488
you don't have to pay anything - that's all.

01:17:48.139 --> 01:17:53.025
When you have to pay, you do not doubt and ask questions, I know you'll go head
long, but here

01:17:53.071 --> 01:17:55.378
you are free, you have freedom to doubt

01:17:55.576 --> 01:17:57.929
but do not pull it too fast

01:17:57.993 --> 01:18:00.644
because it you will spoil your chances of realization.

01:18:00.725 --> 01:18:02.509
May God bless you.
