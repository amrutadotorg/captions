Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti
Bhagavati Mataji

00:03:11.972 --> 00:03:14.950
Shri Nirmala Devyai
Namoh Namah.

00:03:15.158 --> 00:03:22.281
Shri Mataji: Why these twenty-one names
are taken before every puja,

00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:25.638
even before the today renovation of it?

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:30.683
First you have to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:03:30.884 --> 00:03:34.604
But even before worshipping why these
names are taken,

00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:38.223
is important to understand, everything
has a why.

00:03:38.424 --> 00:03:48.511
Because these are the twenty-one channels
within your Sushumna,

00:03:48.712 --> 00:03:51.636
twenty-one channels, we should say, in this

00:03:51.837 --> 00:03:56.869
complete Ida, Pingala and Sushumna Nadi.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.491
So to raise you,

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:13.057
absolutely to give you the ascent, twenty-
one channels in Ida, Pingala, Sushumna.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.992
So one would say seven channels
in the Sushumna Nadi.

00:04:17.193 --> 00:04:25.996
But these seven channels are divided
multiplied by seven into three.

00:04:26.197 --> 00:04:31.541
So every channel has got twenty-one
(inner? Unclear) channels.

00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:41.302
So Sushumna Nadi has got also twenty-one
channels.

00:04:42.391 --> 00:04:44.879
Left-hand side Nadis are as you know that –

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.896
perhaps you know, I don’t know if you know
the names or not.

00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:52.932
And the right hand side also, like Gayatri,

00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:57.697
Parvati and all these are on the righ
hand side.

00:04:57.898 --> 00:05:05.056
And the left ones are called as Chamundi,

00:05:05.257 --> 00:05:10.489
and all these left-sided things, there are
seven of them.

00:05:11.673 --> 00:05:20.771
Now, the central path has got twenty-one
channels and has got twenty-one powers.

00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:25.643
And their deities are named

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:31.865
according to the twenty-one aspects
of Shri Vishnu.

00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:37.801
And that’s why these twenty-one aspects
are first said,

00:05:38.002 --> 00:05:41.421
so that within you all these twenty-one
channels are awakened.

00:05:41.622 --> 00:05:44.771
Within you, first of all.

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:52.032
Puja is a double thing, that a cup has
to be made

00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:57.277
and then this source has to be opened out.

00:05:57.478 --> 00:06:04.838
So you are the cup. The Sushumna is the
channel you have by which you suck in.

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.588
So to open the Sushumna these twenty-one
names are said.

00:06:10.892 --> 00:06:14.760
Now, why first Shri Ganesha?

00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:21.701
Because Shri Ganesha is the beginning
of the desire. And the end of the desire.

00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:24.968
You start with Ganesha and end up
with Ganesha.

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.335
And that’s why Shri Ganesha is worshipped.

00:06:27.536 --> 00:06:31.140
Is the other way round now, the source.

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:35.692
When you direct your attention to
the source you worship it,

00:06:35.893 --> 00:06:44.451
and when you want to incite or open out
your own being, then you chant it.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.244
This is the difference between worship
and a mantra.

00:06:50.445 --> 00:06:55.123
If you just say mantra, you open
yourself up.

00:06:55.324 --> 00:07:02.183
But when you worship and chant,
then you tap the source.

00:07:02.987 --> 00:07:04.805
I don’t know if I’ve said this before
or not.

00:07:05.006 --> 00:07:07.718
Yogi: No, no, no.
Shri Mataji: No? All right.

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.406
That’s how you understand the puja part.

00:07:10.607 --> 00:07:18.248
Now, those who are newcomers, their cup
is completely useless.

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.729
And when you excite the deities, they get
busy opening their cups,

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.368
everybody’s cups also. So it’s a double
work.

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:28.378
But if your cup is ready, it’s very easy
to fill in.

00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:33.964
So now these twenty-one names I think
you should take again

00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:37.537
with the understanding, is better.
All right.

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:46.954
Pujari: Om Shri Keshavaya Namah,
Om Shri Narayanaya Namah,

00:07:47.155 --> 00:07:53.672

Shri Nirmala Devyai
Namoh Namah.

00:08:57.889 --> 00:09:00.294
Shri Mataji: Now.

00:09:00.905 --> 00:09:03.652
Pujari: Now we have the mantra
for pranayama.

00:09:03.853 --> 00:09:06.255
Shri Mataji: This is the Gayatri,
the right side.

00:09:06.456 --> 00:09:11.894
Is the right side, and these are all
the seven centers on physical level.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.814
Pujari: Pranayama. Shri Mataji: Pranayama
is the same thing. Is for –

00:09:16.015 --> 00:09:20.258
Prana is right side. It’s physical side.
You are opening the right side.

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:23.304
You see, this Gayatri mantra you say.
Bhur Bhuva Swaha and all these things.

00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:26.940
Now, Bhu is Pruthvi, Bhuva is Antariksha,

00:09:27.141 --> 00:09:30.335
you see, like that, it’s all the centers
[Pujari: “Swaha”],

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:35.269
the essence of the centers, you see?
Now, Antariksha –

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.577
you’ll be surprised that you are the essence
of all the Antariksha,

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:42.557
your centers are. Yes.

00:09:46.823 --> 00:09:50.018
Pujari [recites Pranayama prayer]:
“Pranavasya Parabrahma rishi

00:09:50.218 --> 00:09:58.826
Paramatma Devata, Devi Gayatri chandah.
Pranayame viniyogah.”

00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:17.983
Shri Mataji: You do it only with the one
nose? Yogi: Both noses. (Not audible)

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:21.871
Shri Mataji: Both the noses. Prana:
Prana is right side.

00:10:22.072 --> 00:10:24.895
Prana shakti is right side, Mana shakti
is left side.

00:10:25.096 --> 00:10:28.993
So Prana shakti you are exciting

00:10:29.844 --> 00:10:34.851
because this prana is the one which spreads
in the body,

00:10:35.052 --> 00:10:40.242
gives you the balance, which takes in
and gives out.

00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:45.249
Pujari: Now we have the Gayatri mantra.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.007

awakened within you to begin with first,
