03:08.557 --> 03:11.771
Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti
Bhagavati Mataji

03:11.972 --> 03:14.950
Shri Nirmala Devyai
Namoh Namah.

03:15.158 --> 03:22.281
Shri Mataji: Why these twenty-one names
are taken before every puja,

03:22.482 --> 03:25.638
even before the today renovation of it?

03:25.839 --> 03:30.683
First you have to worship Shri Ganesha.

03:30.884 --> 03:34.604
But even before worshipping why these
names are taken,

03:34.805 --> 03:38.223
is important to understand, everything
has a why.

03:38.424 --> 03:48.511
Because these are the twenty-one channels
within your Sushumna,

03:48.712 --> 03:51.636
twenty-one channels, we should say, in this

03:51.837 --> 03:56.869
complete Ida, Pingala and Sushumna Nadi.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.491
So to raise you,

04:05.516 --> 04:13.057
absolutely to give you the ascent, twenty-
one channels in Ida, Pingala, Sushumna.

04:13.290 --> 04:16.992
So one would say seven channels
in the Sushumna Nadi.

04:17.193 --> 04:25.996
But these seven channels are divided
multiplied by seven into three.

04:26.197 --> 04:31.541
So every channel has got twenty-one
(inner? Unclear) channels.

04:35.311 --> 04:41.302
So Sushumna Nadi has got also twenty-one
channels.

04:42.391 --> 04:44.879
Left-hand side Nadis are as you know that –

04:45.080 --> 04:48.896
perhaps you know, I don’t know if you know
the names or not.

04:49.144 --> 04:52.932
And the right hand side also, like Gayatri,

04:53.133 --> 04:57.697
Parvati and all these are on the righ
hand side.

04:57.898 --> 05:05.056
And the left ones are called as Chamundi,

05:05.257 --> 05:10.489
and all these left-sided things, there are
seven of them.

05:11.673 --> 05:20.771
Now, the central path has got twenty-one
channels and has got twenty-one powers.

05:20.972 --> 05:25.643
And their deities are named

05:27.185 --> 05:31.865
according to the twenty-one aspects
of Shri Vishnu.

05:32.066 --> 05:37.801
And that’s why these twenty-one aspects
are first said,

05:38.002 --> 05:41.421
so that within you all these twenty-one
channels are awakened.

05:41.622 --> 05:44.771
Within you, first of all.

05:44.972 --> 05:52.032
Puja is a double thing, that a cup has
to be made

05:52.233 --> 05:57.277
and then this source has to be opened out.

05:57.478 --> 06:04.838
So you are the cup. The Sushumna is the
channel you have by which you suck in.

06:05.039 --> 06:09.588
So to open the Sushumna these twenty-one
names are said.

06:10.892 --> 06:14.760
Now, why first Shri Ganesha?

06:14.961 --> 06:21.701
Because Shri Ganesha is the beginning
of the desire. And the end of the desire.

06:21.902 --> 06:24.968
You start with Ganesha and end up
with Ganesha.

06:25.169 --> 06:27.335
And that’s why Shri Ganesha is worshipped.

06:27.536 --> 06:31.140
Is the other way round now, the source.

06:31.411 --> 06:35.692
When you direct your attention to
the source you worship it,

06:35.893 --> 06:44.451
and when you want to incite or open out
your own being, then you chant it.

06:46.400 --> 06:50.244
This is the difference between worship
and a mantra.

06:50.445 --> 06:55.123
If you just say mantra, you open
yourself up.

06:55.324 --> 07:02.183
But when you worship and chant,
then you tap the source.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.805
I don’t know if I’ve said this before
or not.

07:05.006 --> 07:07.718
Yogi: No, no, no.
Shri Mataji: No? All right.

07:07.919 --> 07:10.406
That’s how you understand the puja part.

07:10.607 --> 07:18.248
Now, those who are newcomers, their cup
is completely useless.

07:18.449 --> 07:21.729
And when you excite the deities, they get
busy opening their cups,

07:21.930 --> 07:24.368
everybody’s cups also. So it’s a double
work.

07:24.569 --> 07:28.378
But if your cup is ready, it’s very easy
to fill in.

07:31.737 --> 07:33.964
So now these twenty-one names I think
you should take again

07:34.165 --> 07:37.537
with the understanding, is better.
All right.

07:40.355 --> 07:46.954
Pujari: Om Shri Keshavaya Namah,
Om Shri Narayanaya Namah,

07:47.155 --> 07:53.672
Om Shri Madhavaya Namah,
Om Shri Govindaya Namah,

07:53.873 --> 07:59.699
Om Shri Vishnuve Namah,

07:59.900 --> 08:05.795
Om Shri Trivikramaya Namah,
Om Shri Vamanaya Namah,

08:05.996 --> 08:12.098
Om Shri Shridharaya Namah,
Om Shri Hrishikeshaya Namah,

08:12.259 --> 08:18.575
Om Shri Sankarshanaya Namah,
Om Shri Vasudevaya Namah,

08:18.776 --> 08:24.154
Om Shri Pradyumnaya Namah,
Om Shri Aniruddhaya Namah,

08:24.355 --> 08:29.743
Om Shri Purushottamaya Namah,
Om Shri Aghokshajaya Namah,

08:29.944 --> 08:34.651
Om Shri Narasimhaya Namah,
Om Shri Achyutaya Namah,

08:34.852 --> 08:39.698
Om Shri Janardanaya Namah,
Om Shri Padmanabhaya Namah,

08:39.899 --> 08:44.411
Om Shri Damodaraya Namah,
Om Shri Upendraya Namah,

08:44.612 --> 08:49.018
Om Shri Haraye Namah,
Om Shri Krishnaye Namah.

08:49.219 --> 08:52.512
Pujari e gli yogi: Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti

08:52.713 --> 08:57.683
Shri Nirmala Devyai
Namoh Namah.

08:57.889 --> 09:00.294
Shri Mataji: Now.

09:00.905 --> 09:03.652
Pujari: Now we have the mantra
for pranayama.

09:03.853 --> 09:06.255
Shri Mataji: This is the Gayatri,
the right side.

09:06.456 --> 09:11.894
Is the right side, and these are all
the seven centers on physical level.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.814
Pujari: Pranayama. Shri Mataji: Pranayama
is the same thing. Is for –

09:16.015 --> 09:20.258
Prana is right side. It’s physical side.
You are opening the right side.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.304
You see, this Gayatri mantra you say.
Bhur Bhuva Swaha and all these things.

09:23.505 --> 09:26.940
Now, Bhu is Pruthvi, Bhuva is Antariksha,

09:27.141 --> 09:30.335
you see, like that, it’s all the centers
[Pujari: “Swaha”],

09:30.536 --> 09:35.269
the essence of the centers, you see?
Now, Antariksha –

09:35.470 --> 09:38.577
you’ll be surprised that you are the essence
of all the Antariksha,

09:38.778 --> 09:42.557
your centers are. Yes.

09:46.823 --> 09:50.018
Pujari [recites Pranayama prayer]:
“Pranavasya Parabrahma rishi

09:50.218 --> 09:58.826
Paramatma Devata, Devi Gayatri chandah.
Pranayame viniyogah.”

10:15.491 --> 10:17.983
Shri Mataji: You do it only with the one
nose? Yogi: Both noses. (Not audible)

10:18.184 --> 10:21.871
Shri Mataji: Both the noses. Prana:
Prana is right side.

10:22.072 --> 10:24.895
Prana shakti is right side, Mana shakti
is left side.

10:25.096 --> 10:28.993
So Prana shakti you are exciting

10:29.844 --> 10:34.851
because this prana is the one which spreads
in the body,

10:35.052 --> 10:40.242
gives you the balance, which takes in
and gives out.

10:42.585 --> 10:45.249
Pujari: Now we have the Gayatri mantra.

10:45.450 --> 10:49.007
