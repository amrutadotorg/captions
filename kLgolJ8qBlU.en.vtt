00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:10.407
When you are all meditating

00:00:10.608 --> 00:00:15.593
and inside I also find it difficult to be outside.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.218
So today you have arranged to have this puja here.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.328
Just before that you have to prepare yourself

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.367
physically and mentally.

00:00:34.883 --> 00:00:39.595
Physically you must give yourself a bandhan

00:00:39.796 --> 00:00:42.500
and a bandhan is just nothing but

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:46.843
that you give yourself a protection to your aura.

00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:51.148
And how you do it is very simple

00:00:51.492 --> 00:00:53.898
which I will tell you just now how to do it

00:00:54.099 --> 00:01:00.210
and then you sit down for your puja.

00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:03.900
Then mentally you have to put yourself right.

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:08.390
First of all, you should not feel guilty at all.

00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:12.742
If you are guilty, you cannot do my puja.

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:17.664
So, you should be absolutely above that.

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.140
There should be no tension in your mind.

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:24.664
You are not guilty, you are in the present.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.521
See like flowers you are looking.

00:01:27.722 --> 00:01:29.634
How can flowers be guilty?

00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:31.970
First get out of that guilt business.

00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:34.812
You should not feel guilty or tense.

00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:37.366
Everything that is done is the best.

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:39.252
You shouldn’t worry about it.

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:42.930
It’s not your responsibility even to arrange it.

00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:46.414
Just think that everything is done sahaj.

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.546
Gradually when you’ll move in Sahaja Yoga you’ll be surprised

00:01:50.796 --> 00:01:54.851
to see how things are arranged just beautifully.

00:01:55.078 --> 00:01:59.007
When these people just were finding out a place

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.234
they had no place which was for less than 250$ each.

00:02:04.437 --> 00:02:07.161
They said this is rather too much for everybody’s pocket.

00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:10.736
And then suddenly, spontaneously they found this place.

00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:13.281
When they said 50$ nobody could believe.

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:17.266
They thought that we’ll just get some porridge in the morning

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:20.710
and the rest of it will be fasting.

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:22.861
So many were rather worried,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.258
some thought it was a scout camping ground or whatever it is

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.601
and quite worried when it starts raining.

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.594
But, see, this is all God’s grace to get such a place,

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:36.828
such a comfortable place for you to come here.

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.953
Everything is arranged by God’s grace.

00:02:40.154 --> 00:02:41.711
So first we have to remember

00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:44.082
that it is all arrange through God's grace

00:02:44.283 --> 00:02:46.158
If something is not arranged just forget it,

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.412
just leave it, just don’t worry.

00:02:48.613 --> 00:02:50.984
That’s the best way, you have to live.

00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:55.344
Then what happens is that you become one with the present

00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:59.920
and you can overcome all your problems of tension.

00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:02.619
Tension mounts up when we want to do

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.720
which you are not supposed to do,

00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:07.355
which we are not successful.

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:09.414
There is also a mental barrier

00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:11.686
between ourselves and our mind

00:03:11.887 --> 00:03:14.714
that we want to do a particular thing in a particular way.

00:03:14.915 --> 00:03:17.962
If you can give up that, then you will be surprised

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:23.728
that you become absolutely one with the Divine

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:27.641
and you start working it out in a very beautiful manner.

00:03:27.842 --> 00:03:31.776
Now see the root of a little seed.

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:35.810
It just sprouts, it goes this way.

00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:38.516
If it finds there is an obstruction

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:41.993
ot there is some sort of a stone or something, it goes around it.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.159
Then it finds something other obstruction, it goes away from it.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.939
It doesn’t fight that,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.394
just says, “All right, let me find my own way."

00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:55.571
And then he uses the same stone for holding the tree.

00:03:55.772 --> 00:03:59.767
So clever, he goes around the

00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:05.134
little stone and uses that for its own purpose.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.003
This is how a Sahaja Yogi should behave.

00:04:08.204 --> 00:04:12.189
Not to take responsibility and put others into tension:

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.203
“This must be done. This is not here."

00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:16.483
“That is not there." It’s not necessary.

00:04:16.684 --> 00:04:18.769
It’s your love that is important.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.620
For which you must have heard the story of an old woman

00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:26.259
who was living in a forest.

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.478
Her name was Shavari

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:32.438
and she heard that Shri Ram is going to come in the forest.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.899
And she was so much elated, so much happy.

00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:40.102
Such an innocent woman, she didn’t know what to do.

00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:43.688
So when Rama came she gave Him,

00:04:43.915 --> 00:04:47.579
we have some kind of berry, we called as ber,

00:04:47.852 --> 00:04:50.079
she gave them to Him to eat

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.618
and she told in very great innocence

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.360
that everyone of them I have tested to see that they are not sour.

00:04:57.595 --> 00:05:01.727
And she gave them to Him and he ate them so lovingly.

00:05:01.954 --> 00:05:05.317
So his brother was a hot-tempered fellow.

00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:08.782
He got very angry. He said, “What is this? This lady has no sense.

00:05:08.983 --> 00:05:14.183
She is giving all these things which are eaten by her, first of all."

00:05:14.384 --> 00:05:16.044
Which we call as uttishtha

00:05:16.245 --> 00:05:18.900
means somebody has eaten it, then you are not supposed to eat

00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:22.550
even your, say, your brother has eaten something,

00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:23.769
you cannot eat that.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.090
It’s regarded as something not good, not auspicious.

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:31.517
"And this lady, an old lady with her few teeth that are left,

00:05:31.718 --> 00:05:35.248
she has just pierced every berry and has given to my brother."

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.331
Very furious.

00:05:37.532 --> 00:05:42.001
So Rama’s wife, Sita, was just smiling at the whole situation

00:05:42.202 --> 00:05:44.587
and then Rama gave

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.962
Rama gave that berry to his wife and she ate it.

00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:56.626
She looked at her brother-in-law and She said: "See brother-in-law

00:05:56.827 --> 00:05:59.290
“These are the best berrys I've ever eaten.

00:05:59.491 --> 00:06:01.425
I’ve never had such a taste before."

00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:03.212
But I’m not going to give you anything."

00:06:03.413 --> 00:06:05.595
See, the best way to challenge the ego

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:08.439
is not to say that you are not going to have it.

00:06:08.615 --> 00:06:10.681
He said, “Why?” “No, I won’t give you.

00:06:10.882 --> 00:06:13.587
You won’t have them, I will not. I will eat all of them."

00:06:13.788 --> 00:06:16.153
Then He said, “No, how can you eat all of that?”

00:06:16.354 --> 00:06:19.345
He snatched some of them and he ate and also felt the same thing.

00:06:19.556 --> 00:06:22.400
Because they are given out of love.

00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:24.642
Whatever is done out of love

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.337
is a thousand-fold better

00:06:27.538 --> 00:06:30.061
than that is done out of tension and problem.

00:06:30.313 --> 00:06:35.151
I should never like to cause any tension in your mind of any kind.

00:06:35.352 --> 00:06:37.620
So for small, small things you should not worry.

00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:40.478
You must give up your tensions absolutely

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:44.915
and understand that you are the children of God.

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:46.438
You are to be looked after.

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.136
You are to given everything that is available in His realm.

00:06:50.337 --> 00:06:52.227
You should not get into tension at all.

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:54.509
Firstly, not to feel guilty,

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.470
thirdly to feel that we had to go to this guru, that guru.

00:06:57.671 --> 00:06:59.032
All right, forget it.

00:06:59.233 --> 00:07:02.266
Forget it. Whatever has happened has happened. Forget it!

00:07:02.467 --> 00:07:04.024
Don’t worry on that point also

00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:06.235
because that will tie you down all the time saying,

00:07:06.436 --> 00:07:07.977
“Why did you go to that guru?

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:10.556
Why did you pay money to this fellow?”

00:07:10.757 --> 00:07:11.912
Why did you do this?

00:07:12.113 --> 00:07:15.391
Just tell your mind, “I am not bothered.

00:07:15.592 --> 00:07:17.151
I am not bothered."

00:07:17.352 --> 00:07:19.742
Whatever has happened, has happened that person is finished.

00:07:19.943 --> 00:07:21.909
Now whatever my egg has done, now I am a bird.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.996
I have nothing to do."

00:07:23.197 --> 00:07:25.208
So be in the present, that is very important.

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:28.509
Be in the present, have no guilt,

00:07:28.751 --> 00:07:30.470
have no worries of the past

00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:34.800
because if you worry of the past you can never enjoy the present.

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:37.960
And you are here to enjoy and not to worry about the past.

00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:41.172
What ever has happend, has happend, just forget it.

00:07:41.493 --> 00:07:43.665
I hope you understand this very well

00:07:43.866 --> 00:07:47.062
and to forget whatever has happened and forgive.

00:07:47.263 --> 00:07:49.427
There are Sahaja Yogis with you. Enjoy life.

00:07:49.628 --> 00:07:52.025
Always try to see the good points of other Sahaja Yogis

00:07:52.226 --> 00:07:53.768
and not the bad points.

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:57.056
Normally we try to find out what’s wrong with another person,

00:07:57.257 --> 00:07:59.808
especially when we know about chakras.

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:03.612
We just understand that this person has got these very bad chakras.

00:08:03.813 --> 00:08:06.266
Then the only thing what to do is to give yourself a bandhan,

00:08:06.467 --> 00:08:08.599
which I will tell you, and deal with the person.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.040
But when you know that person has this sickness

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.640
or this kind of a chakra caught up,

00:08:12.841 --> 00:08:15.269
no use arguing, no use telling them.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.433
Let them come up, they’ll come right.

00:08:17.634 --> 00:08:19.120
Tell them that this is what it is.

00:08:19.321 --> 00:08:23.530
At the most you can tell your children, you can tell your wife.

00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:27.486
Someone, but somebody who is not that closely connected,

00:08:27.687 --> 00:08:30.289
you cannot put Sahaja Yoga into their heads.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.563
You cannot force Sahaja Yoga in to them.

00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:36.526
Sahaja Yoga cannot be forced into anyone whatsoever.

00:08:36.727 --> 00:08:39.106
It has to be accepted, ask for it.

00:08:39.307 --> 00:08:40.712
It has its own protocol.

00:08:40.915 --> 00:08:44.970
It cannot be just poured into your mouth,

00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:47.487
that you’d better have it, is a wrong thing.

00:08:47.688 --> 00:08:50.712
There are some people who still have lots of doubts,

00:08:50.913 --> 00:08:53.816
I know that, who are sitting here who have doubts.

00:08:54.017 --> 00:08:55.283
These should go away.

00:08:55.484 --> 00:08:57.878
Then because then they feel guilty, “I have doubts."

00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:01.105
Please get rid of those doubts if possible

00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:03.845
because I do not want that you should feel later on that,

00:09:04.046 --> 00:09:05.438
“Oh, Mother, we doubted you."

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:08.487
Just now better get rid of the doubts.

00:09:08.688 --> 00:09:10.189
One thing that one should understand

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.040
that Mataji has nothing to gain for us.

00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:14.111
We cannot give her anything.

00:09:14.312 --> 00:09:15.808
We cannot give her anything.

00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:17.907
Only we have to take from Her.

00:09:18.108 --> 00:09:20.525
If you understand that then you’ll have no doubts

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.480
because that is one of the fears people have.

00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:25.511
That I’m going to start having something from you.

00:09:25.712 --> 00:09:28.649
So once you understand that She has nothing to take away from us,

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.003
She has to give us something.

00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:34.563
Supposing I say there is a diamond available here free for you,

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.105
will you doubt me?

00:09:36.306 --> 00:09:39.860
You’ll say, “All right, let’s see if it’s a diamond or a fake, clutch it.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.191
That’s how your attitude should be.

00:09:42.407 --> 00:09:45.353
So those who have doubts should know that with the doubts

00:09:45.554 --> 00:09:49.454
they will go very slow and they may be thrown out.

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:51.792
So please don’t have any doubts.

00:09:51.993 --> 00:09:54.995
A doubting mind is the most troublesome thing.

00:09:55.196 --> 00:09:59.001
It will never allow you to enjoy your spirit.

00:09:59.259 --> 00:10:01.394
There is no need to doubt about it.

00:10:01.595 --> 00:10:05.040
This is opened everything is so open,

00:10:05.241 --> 00:10:07.704
there is no secret about it.

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:11.704
You understand that and try to imbibe

00:10:12.056 --> 00:10:14.423
the quality of a good Sahaja Yogi,

00:10:14.624 --> 00:10:17.578
of a Sahaja Yogi who is steady.

00:10:17.779 --> 00:10:20.759
By doubting, the steadiness will go away

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.201
and if a tree is not steady how will it imbed itself?

00:10:25.402 --> 00:10:28.370
It’s important that you should give up all doubts.

00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:31.284
You are so quickly into it.

00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:34.165
Seldom we do such a thing, too much of a thing,

00:10:34.366 --> 00:10:37.431
I mean never done like that before. It’s an experiment.

00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:39.644
We want to see now how it works out.

00:10:39.845 --> 00:10:40.729
It’s really an experiment.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.094
We have never done like this before.

00:10:42.295 --> 00:10:43.999
It’s a very dangerous thing.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.251
I’ve seen it that people who get into puja

00:10:47.452 --> 00:10:50.276
then they might get little stomach pain or something,

00:10:50.477 --> 00:10:53.275
or something will happen to you by which you will be cleared out,

00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:54.542
little bit.

00:10:54.743 --> 00:10:57.633
Not much but then you’ll feel much better out of that.

00:10:57.834 --> 00:10:59.956
So it is a thing that has to happen.

00:11:00.157 --> 00:11:03.151
It’s just like an operation which takes place.

00:11:03.352 --> 00:11:06.111
First we used to do is the cleansing of the the people,

00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:07.563
of the chakras, this, that.

00:11:07.764 --> 00:11:09.673
When they are cleansed and have reached a certain position

00:11:09.874 --> 00:11:12.481
then only they were allowed to do my puja.

00:11:12.682 --> 00:11:15.706
But I found that when I came first to America

00:11:15.907 --> 00:11:17.918
I did not talk about puja at all.

00:11:18.126 --> 00:11:19.642
I talked about the abstract things.

00:11:19.843 --> 00:11:21.603
I didn’t want to say about these things.

00:11:21.804 --> 00:11:24.939
We did not do any puja, we did not establish Shri Ganesha,

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.391
nothing of the kind.

00:11:26.592 --> 00:11:29.960
And as a result of that people who came to me got lost.

00:11:30.161 --> 00:11:32.376
I didn’t tell them how to keep their health all right

00:11:32.577 --> 00:11:33.534
or about anything.

00:11:33.735 --> 00:11:35.118
It was just such a short time and

00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:37.628
the whole thing was a bad response from people

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:40.189
that I thought it better to leave it now.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.751
But now time has come for all of you

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.372
to have it in a big way because you are all seekers

00:11:45.573 --> 00:11:47.727
and we cannot delay it anymore.

00:11:47.946 --> 00:11:50.601
So come to me without any doubt.

00:11:50.802 --> 00:11:52.634
If you have doubts it’s better that you go away.

00:11:52.835 --> 00:11:55.699
It will be better idea for me and for you also.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.381
When you’re doubts are removed then you come for the puja.

00:11:58.582 --> 00:12:02.915
Don’t sit here with your doubts, otherwise I will have a headache.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.321
Apart from that you will have a headache.

00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:10.735
So sit in a very cheerful mood, in a receptive mood

00:12:10.936 --> 00:12:13.688
and see for yourself what happens to you.

00:12:13.971 --> 00:12:16.233
May God bless you.

00:12:19.002 --> 00:12:22.338
Did you tell them what we are going to do or should I tell?

00:12:23.455 --> 00:12:26.986
First we are going to do Shri Ganesha's puja.

00:12:27.471 --> 00:12:31.963
Now Shri ganesha's puja is done

00:12:33.932 --> 00:12:37.025
by washing My feet.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.994
Everybody is not going to wash, I wish everybody could do

00:12:42.195 --> 00:12:45.439
because with that your hands open out very much better.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.481
Everybody who came in San Francisco

00:12:47.682 --> 00:12:49.947
washed my feet, felt it very well.

00:12:50.213 --> 00:12:52.729
But we have to have some selection of people

00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:54.895
who we seen are all right,

00:12:55.096 --> 00:12:57.158
they are going to do the worship.

00:12:57.382 --> 00:12:59.315
But the rest of them, I told them

00:12:59.516 --> 00:13:02.439
this water, which is vibrated, you should put it on your head

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.390
to baptise yourself only.

00:13:04.591 --> 00:13:06.278
But nobody should touch that water.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:09.782
When that water is washed out when you are taken the thing

00:13:09.991 --> 00:13:12.479
just with the spoon you can put it on the head

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.807
and then with your hand you can rub it.

00:13:15.008 --> 00:13:18.306
But, I thing best thing will be to put it on the head a little bit

00:13:18.507 --> 00:13:21.830
and then first in the hand clean it

00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:25.369
and then when you put it on the head you can rub it.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.650
Because your hands will show all the vibrations means

00:13:27.851 --> 00:13:31.231
using or spoiled or if there is any defect.

00:13:31.432 --> 00:13:34.369
The best is first to wash your hands and the put it on the head

00:13:34.596 --> 00:13:35.994
so that it is cleaned out.

00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:38.924
We are thinking as a precaution because

00:13:39.125 --> 00:13:42.955
is a very fast thing we are doing

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:44.556
so we are taking a precaution.

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:47.010
Because is a very fast movement.

00:13:47.211 --> 00:13:50.642
And we have to be fast now, so we have started this thing,

00:13:50.843 --> 00:13:54.213
we may loose some of you, I know that, but doesn't matter.

00:13:54.414 --> 00:13:57.760
Some can be lost but many can be brought up.

00:13:57.961 --> 00:13:59.612
So, it's a big operation

00:13:59.813 --> 00:14:03.189
which I hope carefully done may work out wanders.

00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:05.768
So be careful. And now don't start thinking

00:14:05.969 --> 00:14:07.728
that I may be one of them who'll be lost.

00:14:07.929 --> 00:14:10.114
There are people who are thinking like that

00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:20.692
Also created doubts in your mind about yourself.

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:22.033
That's the main point of it,

00:14:22.234 --> 00:14:25.173
if you have doubts about yourself you will have problems.

00:14:25.374 --> 00:14:29.035
Don't have doubts about yourself also, that's very important.

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:31.402
Because if you have doubts about yourself

00:14:31.603 --> 00:14:33.851
then nothing can be worked out.

00:14:34.485 --> 00:14:37.463
So the first thing is the Ganesha.

00:14:37.673 --> 00:14:39.527
Ganesha is the innocence in you

00:14:39.728 --> 00:14:43.628
which is very important to be awaken in America. Is very important.

00:14:44.292 --> 00:14:47.902
So the first we are going to do is the Ganesha's puja.

00:14:48.293 --> 00:14:49.386
Innocence.

00:14:49.587 --> 00:14:53.324
And Ganesha incarnated on this earth as Christ,

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:55.800
which can be proved also through Kundalini awakening,

00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:57.446
we can prove it

00:14:58.004 --> 00:15:02.613
Once that happens to you, that your innocence is awaken

00:15:02.813 --> 00:15:06.402
when your innocence is waken you will be happy to know

00:15:06.603 --> 00:15:09.980
that most of your diseases that come

00:15:10.181 --> 00:15:13.453
from the spoiling of this chakra specialy

00:15:15.246 --> 00:15:19.526
of so many diseases that are like that

00:15:19.963 --> 00:15:23.036
all these bad diseases are [check].

00:15:23.347 --> 00:15:27.325
Ganesha is the greatest power because it is innocent.

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:31.440
And the innocentce if it is awaken within you

00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:33.714
you become a very powerfull person

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:38.784
and most of the diseases are sort of cured

00:15:38.992 --> 00:15:40.838
which are connected with this chakra.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:42.558
But today is not the time to tell you

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:45.464
about what the diseases are and how they are checked and all that

00:15:45.664 --> 00:15:48.129
but all the combinations and permutations

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.308
of this chakra with other chakras

00:15:50.526 --> 00:15:56.607
which gives you horrible diseases, incurrable diseases, can be checked

00:15:56.808 --> 00:16:00.103
and then how to completely cure them,

00:16:00.304 --> 00:16:03.353
for that you have to know the combination of this.

00:16:03.554 --> 00:16:06.771
When you know the combinations of this then you can check them all

00:16:06.972 --> 00:16:08.384
completely to get it cured.

00:16:08.585 --> 00:16:10.353
But at lest they do not advance anymore,

00:16:10.554 --> 00:16:12.744
whenever they are they completely undercheck

00:16:12.945 --> 00:16:14.415
and gradualy they go down.

00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:15.705
But to expedite it

00:16:15.906 --> 00:16:18.782
you have to understand the complete combinations of centers.

00:16:18.983 --> 00:16:23.368
The chakras, their combinations then what mantras to be said

00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:26.611
how to operate it and everything if you learn

00:16:26.812 --> 00:16:28.040
it takes hardly any time.

00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:31.353
Luckily they have ofered us another time

00:16:31.554 --> 00:16:34.572
[display it] in the end of october, what is the date.

00:16:34.773 --> 00:16:41.993
12 st of october here the people who run the camp like us

00:16:42.408 --> 00:16:45.353
and they work with the camp because actualy the camp is closed

00:16:45.554 --> 00:16:47.576
until they considering close it completely.

00:16:47.777 --> 00:16:50.156
They were oposite place, if we wish another seminar

00:16:50.446 --> 00:16:54.774
for the weekend and the 21 st will be an opening date

00:16:54.975 --> 00:16:56.674
so if anyone is realy interested

00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:59.040
let me know before we leave here today,

00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:05.181
so I can tell to the owner of the camp that that will be ok.

00:17:07.116 --> 00:17:10.353
That will be a good idea, that will be aditional help to you

00:17:10.554 --> 00:17:13.171
and there will be people will tell you about this

00:17:13.372 --> 00:17:15.835
because they are all here till one month at least

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:17.944
so we can work it out that way.

00:17:18.153 --> 00:17:22.157
And then Santa Cruz program we have canceled for the time being,

00:17:22.358 --> 00:17:26.608
because the response in Santa Cruz itself has been very very poor.

00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:29.788
People come for a month or so then they dissapear

00:17:29.989 --> 00:17:31.859
you see, they are very swifty people,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.405
they take again back to drugs, the have no will power left in them.

00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:37.999
Those people who are settled in Santa Cruz

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.960
they're very few people who have that will power.

00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:44.179
They've become like old people who have no will power in them left

00:17:44.515 --> 00:17:46.882
to stand up to the truth and

00:17:47.083 --> 00:17:50.890
that's how they've shown no results of improvement.

00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:52.690
And this is the only place I think

00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:55.230
where we have that way receided back

00:17:55.431 --> 00:17:56.730
and we have to receide

00:17:56.931 --> 00:17:59.406
like the root had to receide at certain places.

00:17:59.607 --> 00:18:04.622
Then later on, when San Francisco develop into a good center

00:18:04.823 --> 00:18:07.136
people also from Santa Cruz can go there

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:09.597
because they like to travel. If you make them travel,

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:15.526
make the suffer a little, they like it.

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:18.206
If you tell them it's all here just now you sitting down

00:18:18.407 --> 00:18:20.636
you'll get it, they say o, that's too much.

00:18:21.698 --> 00:18:23.683
That's the nature of american people,

00:18:23.884 --> 00:18:27.046
you see, they want to travel, have some adventure something

00:18:27.247 --> 00:18:28.964
and they want to do like that.

00:18:29.165 --> 00:18:34.086
It's all right, let them travel to San Francisco and suffer a little

00:18:34.266 --> 00:18:36.480
and then get there till settle down.

00:18:36.681 --> 00:18:40.232
Whatever it is San Francisco is going to be a very powerfull center.

00:18:40.433 --> 00:18:43.979
And people from Santa Cruz can go there and work it out.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.394
I think if they can go there,

00:18:46.595 --> 00:18:48.871
then they may develop that earnesness

00:18:49.072 --> 00:18:51.574
to develop it and to settle down.

00:18:53.589 --> 00:18:57.701
So the responsibility is very great on all of you who have come here.

00:18:58.253 --> 00:19:04.017
You all represent here the fundation of Sahaja Yoga in america.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.831
You are the one who will be held responsible for the emancipation

00:19:09.456 --> 00:19:13.608
of this court specialy.

00:19:14.143 --> 00:19:20.189
That so many, I think at least 60% of the seekers

00:19:20.406 --> 00:19:24.193
are born in this part of the country

00:19:24.394 --> 00:19:28.592
and are there, till 60% of the seekers are here.

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:32.456
Some of them are lost because they have gone in a very wrong way,

00:19:32.657 --> 00:19:35.530
head lock, but you can save them.

00:19:36.917 --> 00:19:41.964
You can first off all, establish people who are perfectly all right

00:19:42.165 --> 00:19:44.496
then there are someone little bit spoiled,

00:19:44.697 --> 00:19:47.745
then there are some people who can be brought in.

00:19:47.946 --> 00:19:51.675
But those people who are absoultely wrong cases

00:19:51.876 --> 00:19:53.792
you should no worry just now about them.

00:19:53.993 --> 00:19:56.925
You build up all such people together

00:19:57.126 --> 00:19:59.473
and then it will be grater for you

00:19:59.674 --> 00:20:02.698
to pull out all such people who have no will power.

00:20:02.899 --> 00:20:05.956
Because you can give the the will to come out of their problems.

00:20:06.157 --> 00:20:09.503
We have to save all of them,

00:20:09.729 --> 00:20:11.893
try to save all of them.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.417
It is better that you do it in such a way

00:20:15.618 --> 00:20:17.409
that you first build up your strenght

00:20:17.696 --> 00:20:20.890
and then you try to pull them out.

00:20:21.175 --> 00:20:23.136
And we can do it.

00:20:23.456 --> 00:20:26.393
I am very happy to see so many people here.

00:20:26.776 --> 00:20:29.104
I've great hopes now from America.

00:20:29.409 --> 00:20:32.027
And I'm sure you can save this great country

00:20:32.228 --> 00:20:34.629
by which can save the whole humanity.

00:20:35.761 --> 00:20:37.996
This is such a great news for all the sahaja yogis

00:20:38.197 --> 00:20:40.143
all over the world. They are so anctious.

00:20:40.344 --> 00:20:43.776
People have come from India, have come from Australia,

00:20:43.977 --> 00:20:45.565
have come from Europe.

00:20:45.766 --> 00:20:48.221
They've come from all over the world,

00:20:48.422 --> 00:20:51.466
from England, and every place they are here

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:55.316
just to pull out some americans out

00:20:55.517 --> 00:20:57.722
so that then they'll start doing their job.

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:01.128
Next time we have to export americans.

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:09.112
May God bless you! May God bless you!

00:21:14.386 --> 00:21:19.200
I wanted to say that one thing one should avoid during puja

00:21:19.401 --> 00:21:22.153
or otherwise also is shalowness.

00:21:22.354 --> 00:21:24.761
You should not get puja on a shalow bussiness.

00:21:24.962 --> 00:21:27.332
Because it works out in a very subtler way.

00:21:27.533 --> 00:21:30.081
So shallowness must be avoided in Sahaja Yoga!

00:21:30.282 --> 00:21:34.310
Shallowness or all the time saying that

00:21:34.511 --> 00:21:36.511
we are new to this , we are new to that.

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:38.722
There is nothing new because everything is within you.

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:42.120
It's can be activated. There's nothing new, it's all within you.

00:21:42.321 --> 00:21:45.347
As any indian is, you are, there's no difference whatsoever.

00:21:45.548 --> 00:21:48.878
Only thing they have a little advanced that they can understand me

00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:51.821
faster than you can because they have the education.

00:21:52.037 --> 00:21:54.864
But as far as the mechanism is concerned, you are just the same.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.915
Don't have the idea that you are a new nation

00:21:58.116 --> 00:22:00.524
and all this thing have no meaning at all

00:22:00.725 --> 00:22:04.281
You are ancient people oer seekers of antiquities.

00:22:04.498 --> 00:22:07.884
Just don't worry about these things that you are a new nation.

00:22:08.085 --> 00:22:09.367
You were given this nation

00:22:09.568 --> 00:22:12.481
because you did such good in your last life.

00:22:12.695 --> 00:22:14.992
May God bless you!
