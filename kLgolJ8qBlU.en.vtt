WEBVTT

00:06.944 --> 00:10.407
When you are all meditating

00:10.608 --> 00:15.593
and inside I also find it difficult to be outside.

00:16.710 --> 00:24.218
So today you have arranged to have this puja here.

00:25.609 --> 00:30.328
Just before that you have to prepare yourself

00:30.529 --> 00:33.367
physically and mentally.

00:34.883 --> 00:39.595
Physically you must give yourself a bandhan

00:39.796 --> 00:42.500
and a bandhan is just nothing but

00:42.701 --> 00:46.843
that you give yourself a protection to your aura.

00:47.044 --> 00:51.148
And how you do it is very simple

00:51.492 --> 00:53.898
which I will tell you just now how to do it

00:54.099 --> 01:00.210
and then you sit down for your puja.

01:00.411 --> 01:03.900
Then mentally you have to put yourself right.

01:04.101 --> 01:08.390
First of all, you should not feel guilty at all.

01:08.648 --> 01:12.742
If you are guilty, you cannot do my puja.

01:13.005 --> 01:17.664
So, you should be absolutely above that.

01:17.929 --> 01:21.140
There should be no tension in your mind.

01:21.406 --> 01:24.664
You are not guilty, you are in the present.

01:24.890 --> 01:27.521
See like flowers you are looking.

01:27.722 --> 01:29.634
How can flowers be guilty?

01:29.835 --> 01:31.970
First get out of that guilt business.

01:32.218 --> 01:34.812
You should not feel guilty or tense.

01:35.031 --> 01:37.366
Everything that is done is the best.

01:37.567 --> 01:39.252
You shouldn’t worry about it.

01:39.453 --> 01:42.930
It’s not your responsibility even to arrange it.

01:43.131 --> 01:46.414
Just think that everything is done sahaj.

01:46.679 --> 01:50.546
Gradually when you’ll move in Sahaja Yoga you’ll be surprised

01:50.796 --> 01:54.851
to see how things are arranged just beautifully.

01:55.078 --> 01:59.007
When these people just were finding out a place

01:59.289 --> 02:04.234
they had no place which was for less than 250$ each.

02:04.437 --> 02:07.161
They said this is rather too much for everybody’s pocket.

02:07.362 --> 02:10.736
And then suddenly, spontaneously they found this place.

02:10.937 --> 02:13.281
When they said 50$ nobody could believe.

02:13.482 --> 02:17.266
They thought that we’ll just get some porridge in the morning

02:17.467 --> 02:20.710
and the rest of it will be fasting.

02:21.002 --> 02:22.861
So many were rather worried,

02:23.070 --> 02:26.258
some thought it was a scout camping ground or whatever it is

02:26.459 --> 02:29.601
and quite worried when it starts raining.

02:29.859 --> 02:33.594
But, see, this is all God’s grace to get such a place,

02:33.795 --> 02:36.828
such a comfortable place for you to come here.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.953
Everything is arranged by God’s grace.

02:40.154 --> 02:41.711
So first we have to remember

02:41.912 --> 02:44.082
that it is all arrange through God's grace

02:44.283 --> 02:46.158
If something is not arranged just forget it,

02:46.359 --> 02:48.412
just leave it, just don’t worry.

02:48.613 --> 02:50.984
That’s the best way, you have to live.

02:51.231 --> 02:55.344
Then what happens is that you become one with the present

02:55.545 --> 02:59.920
and you can overcome all your problems of tension.

03:00.121 --> 03:02.619
Tension mounts up when we want to do

03:02.820 --> 03:04.720
which you are not supposed to do,

03:04.921 --> 03:07.355
which we are not successful.

03:07.556 --> 03:09.414
There is also a mental barrier

03:09.615 --> 03:11.686
between ourselves and our mind

03:11.887 --> 03:14.714
that we want to do a particular thing in a particular way.

03:14.915 --> 03:17.962
If you can give up that, then you will be surprised

03:18.163 --> 03:23.728
that you become absolutely one with the Divine

03:23.929 --> 03:27.641
and you start working it out in a very beautiful manner.

03:27.842 --> 03:31.776
Now see the root of a little seed.

03:31.977 --> 03:35.810
It just sprouts, it goes this way.

03:36.011 --> 03:38.516
If it finds there is an obstruction

03:38.717 --> 03:41.993
ot there is some sort of a stone or something, it goes around it.

03:42.220 --> 03:46.159
Then it finds something other obstruction, it goes away from it.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.939
It doesn’t fight that,

03:48.140 --> 03:50.394
just says, “All right, let me find my own way."

03:50.595 --> 03:55.571
And then he uses the same stone for holding the tree.

03:55.772 --> 03:59.767
So clever, he goes around the

04:01.212 --> 04:05.134
little stone and uses that for its own purpose.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.003
This is how a Sahaja Yogi should behave.

04:08.204 --> 04:12.189
Not to take responsibility and put others into tension:

04:12.390 --> 04:14.203
“This must be done. This is not here."

04:14.404 --> 04:16.483
“That is not there." It’s not necessary.

04:16.684 --> 04:18.769
It’s your love that is important.

04:18.970 --> 04:23.620
For which you must have heard the story of an old woman

04:23.821 --> 04:26.259
who was living in a forest.

04:26.501 --> 04:28.478
Her name was Shavari

04:28.679 --> 04:32.438
and she heard that Shri Ram is going to come in the forest.

04:32.639 --> 04:36.899
And she was so much elated, so much happy.

04:37.141 --> 04:40.102
Such an innocent woman, she didn’t know what to do.

04:40.311 --> 04:43.688
So when Rama came she gave Him,

04:43.915 --> 04:47.579
we have some kind of berry, we called as ber,

04:47.852 --> 04:50.079
she gave them to Him to eat

04:50.280 --> 04:52.618
and she told in very great innocence

04:52.819 --> 04:57.360
that everyone of them I have tested to see that they are not sour.

04:57.595 --> 05:01.727
And she gave them to Him and he ate them so lovingly.

05:01.954 --> 05:05.317
So his brother was a hot-tempered fellow.

05:05.518 --> 05:08.782
He got very angry. He said, “What is this? This lady has no sense.

05:08.983 --> 05:14.183
She is giving all these things which are eaten by her, first of all."

05:14.384 --> 05:16.044
Which we call as uttishtha

05:16.245 --> 05:18.900
means somebody has eaten it, then you are not supposed to eat

05:19.101 --> 05:22.550
even your, say, your brother has eaten something,

05:22.751 --> 05:23.769
you cannot eat that.

05:23.970 --> 05:28.090
It’s regarded as something not good, not auspicious.

05:28.291 --> 05:31.517
"And this lady, an old lady with her few teeth that are left,

05:31.718 --> 05:35.248
she has just pierced every berry and has given to my brother."

05:35.449 --> 05:37.331
Very furious.

05:37.532 --> 05:42.001
So Rama’s wife, Sita, was just smiling at the whole situation

05:42.202 --> 05:44.587
and then Rama gave

05:45.470 --> 05:51.962
Rama gave that berry to his wife and she ate it.

05:52.165 --> 05:56.626
She looked at her brother-in-law and She said: "See brother-in-law

05:56.827 --> 05:59.290
“These are the best berrys I've ever eaten.

05:59.491 --> 06:01.425
I’ve never had such a taste before."

06:01.626 --> 06:03.212
But I’m not going to give you anything."

06:03.413 --> 06:05.595
See, the best way to challenge the ego

06:05.796 --> 06:08.439
is not to say that you are not going to have it.

06:08.615 --> 06:10.681
He said, “Why?” “No, I won’t give you.

06:10.882 --> 06:13.587
You won’t have them, I will not. I will eat all of them."

06:13.788 --> 06:16.153
Then He said, “No, how can you eat all of that?”

06:16.354 --> 06:19.345
He snatched some of them and he ate and also felt the same thing.

06:19.556 --> 06:22.400
Because they are given out of love.

06:22.601 --> 06:24.642
Whatever is done out of love

06:24.843 --> 06:27.337
is a thousand-fold better

06:27.538 --> 06:30.061
than that is done out of tension and problem.

06:30.313 --> 06:35.151
I should never like to cause any tension in your mind of any kind.

06:35.352 --> 06:37.620
So for small, small things you should not worry.

06:37.821 --> 06:40.478
You must give up your tensions absolutely

06:40.679 --> 06:44.915
and understand that you are the children of God.

06:45.129 --> 06:46.438
You are to be looked after.

06:46.639 --> 06:50.136
You are to given everything that is available in His realm.

06:50.337 --> 06:52.227
You should not get into tension at all.

06:52.428 --> 06:54.509
Firstly, not to feel guilty,

06:54.710 --> 06:57.470
thirdly to feel that we had to go to this guru, that guru.

06:57.671 --> 06:59.032
All right, forget it.

06:59.233 --> 07:02.266
Forget it. Whatever has happened has happened. Forget it!

07:02.467 --> 07:04.024
Don’t worry on that point also

07:04.225 --> 07:06.235
because that will tie you down all the time saying,

07:06.436 --> 07:07.977
“Why did you go to that guru?

07:08.178 --> 07:10.556
Why did you pay money to this fellow?”

07:10.757 --> 07:11.912
Why did you do this?

07:12.113 --> 07:15.391
Just tell your mind, “I am not bothered.

07:15.592 --> 07:17.151
I am not bothered."

07:17.352 --> 07:19.742
Whatever has happened, has happened that person is finished.

07:19.943 --> 07:21.909
Now whatever my egg has done, now I am a bird.

07:22.110 --> 07:22.996
I have nothing to do."

07:23.197 --> 07:25.208
So be in the present, that is very important.

07:25.409 --> 07:28.509
Be in the present, have no guilt,

07:28.751 --> 07:30.470
have no worries of the past

07:30.671 --> 07:34.800
because if you worry of the past you can never enjoy the present.

07:35.087 --> 07:37.960
And you are here to enjoy and not to worry about the past.

07:38.168 --> 07:41.172
What ever has happend, has happend, just forget it.

07:41.493 --> 07:43.665
I hope you understand this very well

07:43.866 --> 07:47.062
and to forget whatever has happened and forgive.

07:47.263 --> 07:49.427
There are Sahaja Yogis with you. Enjoy life.

07:49.628 --> 07:52.025
Always try to see the good points of other Sahaja Yogis

07:52.226 --> 07:53.768
and not the bad points.

07:53.969 --> 07:57.056
Normally we try to find out what’s wrong with another person,

07:57.257 --> 07:59.808
especially when we know about chakras.

08:00.009 --> 08:03.612
We just understand that this person has got these very bad chakras.

08:03.813 --> 08:06.266
Then the only thing what to do is to give yourself a bandhan,

08:06.467 --> 08:08.599
which I will tell you, and deal with the person.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.040
But when you know that person has this sickness

08:11.241 --> 08:12.640
or this kind of a chakra caught up,

08:12.841 --> 08:15.269
no use arguing, no use telling them.

08:15.470 --> 08:17.433
Let them come up, they’ll come right.

08:17.634 --> 08:19.120
Tell them that this is what it is.

08:19.321 --> 08:23.530
At the most you can tell your children, you can tell your wife.

08:23.731 --> 08:27.486
Someone, but somebody who is not that closely connected,

08:27.687 --> 08:30.289
you cannot put Sahaja Yoga into their heads.

08:30.490 --> 08:32.563
You cannot force Sahaja Yoga in to them.

08:32.764 --> 08:36.526
Sahaja Yoga cannot be forced into anyone whatsoever.

08:36.727 --> 08:39.106
It has to be accepted, ask for it.

08:39.307 --> 08:40.712
It has its own protocol.

08:40.915 --> 08:44.970
It cannot be just poured into your mouth,

08:45.171 --> 08:47.487
that you’d better have it, is a wrong thing.

08:47.688 --> 08:50.712
There are some people who still have lots of doubts,

08:50.913 --> 08:53.816
I know that, who are sitting here who have doubts.

08:54.017 --> 08:55.283
These should go away.

08:55.484 --> 08:57.878
Then because then they feel guilty, “I have doubts."

08:58.079 --> 09:01.105
Please get rid of those doubts if possible

09:01.306 --> 09:03.845
because I do not want that you should feel later on that,

09:04.046 --> 09:05.438
“Oh, Mother, we doubted you."

09:05.639 --> 09:08.487
Just now better get rid of the doubts.

09:08.688 --> 09:10.189
One thing that one should understand

09:10.390 --> 09:12.040
that Mataji has nothing to gain for us.

09:12.241 --> 09:14.111
We cannot give her anything.

09:14.312 --> 09:15.808
We cannot give her anything.

09:16.009 --> 09:17.907
Only we have to take from Her.

09:18.108 --> 09:20.525
If you understand that then you’ll have no doubts

09:20.726 --> 09:22.480
because that is one of the fears people have.

09:22.681 --> 09:25.511
That I’m going to start having something from you.

09:25.712 --> 09:28.649
So once you understand that She has nothing to take away from us,

09:28.850 --> 09:31.003
She has to give us something.

09:31.204 --> 09:34.563
Supposing I say there is a diamond available here free for you,

09:34.774 --> 09:36.105
will you doubt me?

09:36.306 --> 09:39.860
You’ll say, “All right, let’s see if it’s a diamond or a fake, clutch it.

09:40.110 --> 09:42.191
That’s how your attitude should be.

09:42.407 --> 09:45.353
So those who have doubts should know that with the doubts

09:45.554 --> 09:49.454
they will go very slow and they may be thrown out.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.792
So please don’t have any doubts.

09:51.993 --> 09:54.995
A doubting mind is the most troublesome thing.

09:55.196 --> 09:59.001
It will never allow you to enjoy your spirit.

09:59.259 --> 10:01.394
There is no need to doubt about it.

10:01.595 --> 10:05.040
This is opened everything is so open,

10:05.241 --> 10:07.704
there is no secret about it.

10:07.915 --> 10:11.704
You understand that and try to imbibe

10:12.056 --> 10:14.423
the quality of a good Sahaja Yogi,

10:14.624 --> 10:17.578
of a Sahaja Yogi who is steady.

10:17.779 --> 10:20.759
By doubting, the steadiness will go away

10:20.960 --> 10:25.201
and if a tree is not steady how will it imbed itself?

10:25.402 --> 10:28.370
It’s important that you should give up all doubts.

10:28.571 --> 10:31.284
You are so quickly into it.

10:31.485 --> 10:34.165
Seldom we do such a thing, too much of a thing,

10:34.366 --> 10:37.431
I mean never done like that before. It’s an experiment.

10:37.657 --> 10:39.644
We want to see now how it works out.

10:39.845 --> 10:40.729
It’s really an experiment.

10:40.930 --> 10:42.094
We have never done like this before.

10:42.295 --> 10:43.999
It’s a very dangerous thing.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.251
I’ve seen it that people who get into puja

10:47.452 --> 10:50.276
then they might get little stomach pain or something,

10:50.477 --> 10:53.275
or something will happen to you by which you will be cleared out,

10:53.476 --> 10:54.542
little bit.

10:54.743 --> 10:57.633
Not much but then you’ll feel much better out of that.

10:57.834 --> 10:59.956
So it is a thing that has to happen.

11:00.157 --> 11:03.151
It’s just like an operation which takes place.

11:03.352 --> 11:06.111
First we used to do is the cleansing of the the people,

11:06.312 --> 11:07.563
of the chakras, this, that.

11:07.764 --> 11:09.673
When they are cleansed and have reached a certain position

11:09.874 --> 11:12.481
then only they were allowed to do my puja.

11:12.682 --> 11:15.706
But I found that when I came first to America

11:15.907 --> 11:17.918
I did not talk about puja at all.

11:18.126 --> 11:19.642
I talked about the abstract things.

11:19.843 --> 11:21.603
I didn’t want to say about these things.

11:21.804 --> 11:24.939
We did not do any puja, we did not establish Shri Ganesha,

11:25.140 --> 11:26.391
nothing of the kind.

11:26.592 --> 11:29.960
And as a result of that people who came to me got lost.

11:30.161 --> 11:32.376
I didn’t tell them how to keep their health all right

11:32.577 --> 11:33.534
or about anything.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.118
It was just such a short time and

11:35.319 --> 11:37.628
the whole thing was a bad response from people

11:37.829 --> 11:40.189
that I thought it better to leave it now.

11:40.390 --> 11:42.751
But now time has come for all of you

11:42.952 --> 11:45.372
to have it in a big way because you are all seekers

11:45.573 --> 11:47.727
and we cannot delay it anymore.

11:47.946 --> 11:50.601
So come to me without any doubt.

11:50.802 --> 11:52.634
If you have doubts it’s better that you go away.

11:52.835 --> 11:55.699
It will be better idea for me and for you also.

11:55.900 --> 11:58.381
When you’re doubts are removed then you come for the puja.

11:58.582 --> 12:02.915
Don’t sit here with your doubts, otherwise I will have a headache.

12:03.220 --> 12:06.321
Apart from that you will have a headache.

12:07.626 --> 12:10.735
So sit in a very cheerful mood, in a receptive mood

12:10.936 --> 12:13.688
and see for yourself what happens to you.

12:13.971 --> 12:16.233
May God bless you.

12:19.002 --> 12:22.338
Did you tell them what we are going to do or should I tell?

12:23.455 --> 12:26.986
First we are going to do Shri Ganesha's puja.

12:27.471 --> 12:31.963
Now Shri ganesha's puja is done

12:33.932 --> 12:37.025
by washing My feet.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.994
Everybody is not going to wash, I wish everybody could do

12:42.195 --> 12:45.439
because with that your hands open out very much better.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.481
Everybody who came in San Francisco

12:47.682 --> 12:49.947
washed my feet, felt it very well.

12:50.213 --> 12:52.729
But we have to have some selection of people

12:52.917 --> 12:54.895
who we seen are all right,

12:55.096 --> 12:57.158
they are going to do the worship.

12:57.382 --> 12:59.315
But the rest of them, I told them

12:59.516 --> 13:02.439
this water, which is vibrated, you should put it on your head

13:02.640 --> 13:04.390
to baptise yourself only.

13:04.591 --> 13:06.278
But nobody should touch that water.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.782
When that water is washed out when you are taken the thing

13:09.991 --> 13:12.479
just with the spoon you can put it on the head

13:12.680 --> 13:14.807
and then with your hand you can rub it.

13:15.008 --> 13:18.306
But, I thing best thing will be to put it on the head a little bit

13:18.507 --> 13:21.830
and then first in the hand clean it

13:22.031 --> 13:25.369
and then when you put it on the head you can rub it.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.650
Because your hands will show all the vibrations means

13:27.851 --> 13:31.231
using or spoiled or if there is any defect.

13:31.432 --> 13:34.369
The best is first to wash your hands and the put it on the head

13:34.596 --> 13:35.994
so that it is cleaned out.

13:36.259 --> 13:38.924
We are thinking as a precaution because

13:39.125 --> 13:42.955
is a very fast thing we are doing

13:43.156 --> 13:44.556
so we are taking a precaution.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.010
Because is a very fast movement.

13:47.211 --> 13:50.642
And we have to be fast now, so we have started this thing,

13:50.843 --> 13:54.213
we may loose some of you, I know that, but doesn't matter.

13:54.414 --> 13:57.760
Some can be lost but many can be brought up.

13:57.961 --> 13:59.612
So, it's a big operation

13:59.813 --> 14:03.189
which I hope carefully done may work out wanders.

14:03.821 --> 14:05.768
So be careful. And now don't start thinking

14:05.969 --> 14:07.728
that I may be one of them who'll be lost.

14:07.929 --> 14:10.114
There are people who are thinking like that

14:17.591 --> 14:20.692
Also created doubts in your mind about yourself.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.033
That's the main point of it,

14:22.234 --> 14:25.173
if you have doubts about yourself you will have problems.

14:25.374 --> 14:29.035
Don't have doubts about yourself also, that's very important.

14:29.339 --> 14:31.402
Because if you have doubts about yourself

14:31.603 --> 14:33.851
then nothing can be worked out.

14:34.485 --> 14:37.463
So the first thing is the Ganesha.

14:37.673 --> 14:39.527
Ganesha is the innocence in you

14:39.728 --> 14:43.628
which is very important to be awaken in America. Is very important.

14:44.292 --> 14:47.902
So the first we are going to do is the Ganesha's puja.

14:48.293 --> 14:49.386
Innocence.

14:49.587 --> 14:53.324
And Ganesha incarnated on this earth as Christ,

14:53.525 --> 14:55.800
which can be proved also through Kundalini awakening,

14:56.001 --> 14:57.446
we can prove it

14:58.004 --> 15:02.613
Once that happens to you, that your innocence is awaken

15:02.813 --> 15:06.402
when your innocence is waken you will be happy to know

15:06.603 --> 15:09.980
that most of your diseases that come

15:10.181 --> 15:13.453
from the spoiling of this chakra specialy

15:15.246 --> 15:19.526
of so many diseases that are like that

15:19.963 --> 15:23.036
all these bad diseases are [check].

15:23.347 --> 15:27.325
Ganesha is the greatest power because it is innocent.

15:27.526 --> 15:31.440
And the innocentce if it is awaken within you

15:31.641 --> 15:33.714
you become a very powerfull person

15:33.930 --> 15:38.784
and most of the diseases are sort of cured

15:38.992 --> 15:40.838
which are connected with this chakra.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.558
But today is not the time to tell you

15:42.759 --> 15:45.464
about what the diseases are and how they are checked and all that

15:45.664 --> 15:48.129
but all the combinations and permutations

15:48.330 --> 15:50.308
of this chakra with other chakras

15:50.526 --> 15:56.607
which gives you horrible diseases, incurrable diseases, can be checked

15:56.808 --> 16:00.103
and then how to completely cure them,

16:00.304 --> 16:03.353
for that you have to know the combination of this.

16:03.554 --> 16:06.771
When you know the combinations of this then you can check them all

16:06.972 --> 16:08.384
completely to get it cured.

16:08.585 --> 16:10.353
But at lest they do not advance anymore,

16:10.554 --> 16:12.744
whenever they are they completely undercheck

16:12.945 --> 16:14.415
and gradualy they go down.

16:14.616 --> 16:15.705
But to expedite it

16:15.906 --> 16:18.782
you have to understand the complete combinations of centers.

16:18.983 --> 16:23.368
The chakras, their combinations then what mantras to be said

16:23.569 --> 16:26.611
how to operate it and everything if you learn

16:26.812 --> 16:28.040
it takes hardly any time.

16:28.241 --> 16:31.353
Luckily they have ofered us another time

16:31.554 --> 16:34.572
[display it] in the end of october, what is the date.

16:34.773 --> 16:41.993
12 st of october here the people who run the camp like us

16:42.408 --> 16:45.353
and they work with the camp because actualy the camp is closed

16:45.554 --> 16:47.576
until they considering close it completely.

16:47.777 --> 16:50.156
They were oposite place, if we wish another seminar

16:50.446 --> 16:54.774
for the weekend and the 21 st will be an opening date

16:54.975 --> 16:56.674
so if anyone is realy interested

16:56.875 --> 16:59.040
let me know before we leave here today,

16:59.241 --> 17:05.181
so I can tell to the owner of the camp that that will be ok.

17:07.116 --> 17:10.353
That will be a good idea, that will be aditional help to you

17:10.554 --> 17:13.171
and there will be people will tell you about this

17:13.372 --> 17:15.835
because they are all here till one month at least

17:16.036 --> 17:17.944
so we can work it out that way.

17:18.153 --> 17:22.157
And then Santa Cruz program we have canceled for the time being,

17:22.358 --> 17:26.608
because the response in Santa Cruz itself has been very very poor.

17:26.809 --> 17:29.788
People come for a month or so then they dissapear

17:29.989 --> 17:31.859
you see, they are very swifty people,

17:32.060 --> 17:35.405
they take again back to drugs, the have no will power left in them.

17:35.615 --> 17:37.999
Those people who are settled in Santa Cruz

17:38.200 --> 17:39.960
they're very few people who have that will power.

17:40.161 --> 17:44.179
They've become like old people who have no will power in them left

17:44.515 --> 17:46.882
to stand up to the truth and

17:47.083 --> 17:50.890
that's how they've shown no results of improvement.

17:51.091 --> 17:52.690
And this is the only place I think

17:52.891 --> 17:55.230
where we have that way receided back

17:55.431 --> 17:56.730
and we have to receide

17:56.931 --> 17:59.406
like the root had to receide at certain places.

17:59.607 --> 18:04.622
Then later on, when San Francisco develop into a good center

18:04.823 --> 18:07.136
people also from Santa Cruz can go there

18:07.337 --> 18:09.597
because they like to travel. If you make them travel,

18:09.798 --> 18:15.526
make the suffer a little, they like it.

18:15.727 --> 18:18.206
If you tell them it's all here just now you sitting down

18:18.407 --> 18:20.636
you'll get it, they say o, that's too much.

18:21.698 --> 18:23.683
That's the nature of american people,

18:23.884 --> 18:27.046
you see, they want to travel, have some adventure something

18:27.247 --> 18:28.964
and they want to do like that.

18:29.165 --> 18:34.086
It's all right, let them travel to San Francisco and suffer a little

18:34.266 --> 18:36.480
and then get there till settle down.

18:36.681 --> 18:40.232
Whatever it is San Francisco is going to be a very powerfull center.

18:40.433 --> 18:43.979
And people from Santa Cruz can go there and work it out.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.394
I think if they can go there,

18:46.595 --> 18:48.871
then they may develop that earnesness

18:49.072 --> 18:51.574
to develop it and to settle down.

18:53.589 --> 18:57.701
So the responsibility is very great on all of you who have come here.

18:58.253 --> 19:04.017
You all represent here the fundation of Sahaja Yoga in america.

19:04.580 --> 19:08.831
You are the one who will be held responsible for the emancipation

19:09.456 --> 19:13.608
of this court specialy.

19:14.143 --> 19:20.189
That so many, I think at least 60% of the seekers

19:20.406 --> 19:24.193
are born in this part of the country

19:24.394 --> 19:28.592
and are there, till 60% of the seekers are here.

19:28.901 --> 19:32.456
Some of them are lost because they have gone in a very wrong way,

19:32.657 --> 19:35.530
head lock, but you can save them.

19:36.917 --> 19:41.964
You can first off all, establish people who are perfectly all right

19:42.165 --> 19:44.496
then there are someone little bit spoiled,

19:44.697 --> 19:47.745
then there are some people who can be brought in.

19:47.946 --> 19:51.675
But those people who are absoultely wrong cases

19:51.876 --> 19:53.792
you should no worry just now about them.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.925
You build up all such people together

19:57.126 --> 19:59.473
and then it will be grater for you

19:59.674 --> 20:02.698
to pull out all such people who have no will power.

20:02.899 --> 20:05.956
Because you can give the the will to come out of their problems.

20:06.157 --> 20:09.503
We have to save all of them,

20:09.729 --> 20:11.893
try to save all of them.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.417
It is better that you do it in such a way

20:15.618 --> 20:17.409
that you first build up your strenght

20:17.696 --> 20:20.890
and then you try to pull them out.

20:21.175 --> 20:23.136
And we can do it.

20:23.456 --> 20:26.393
I am very happy to see so many people here.

20:26.776 --> 20:29.104
I've great hopes now from America.

20:29.409 --> 20:32.027
And I'm sure you can save this great country

20:32.228 --> 20:34.629
by which can save the whole humanity.

20:35.761 --> 20:37.996
This is such a great news for all the sahaja yogis

20:38.197 --> 20:40.143
all over the world. They are so anctious.

20:40.344 --> 20:43.776
People have come from India, have come from Australia,

20:43.977 --> 20:45.565
have come from Europe.

20:45.766 --> 20:48.221
They've come from all over the world,

20:48.422 --> 20:51.466
from England, and every place they are here

20:51.667 --> 20:55.316
just to pull out some americans out

20:55.517 --> 20:57.722
so that then they'll start doing their job.

20:57.923 --> 21:01.128
Next time we have to export americans.

21:05.347 --> 21:09.112
May God bless you! May God bless you!

21:14.386 --> 21:19.200
I wanted to say that one thing one should avoid during puja

21:19.401 --> 21:22.153
or otherwise also is shalowness.

21:22.354 --> 21:24.761
You should not get puja on a shalow bussiness.

21:24.962 --> 21:27.332
Because it works out in a very subtler way.

21:27.533 --> 21:30.081
So shallowness must be avoided in Sahaja Yoga!

21:30.282 --> 21:34.310
Shallowness or all the time saying that

21:34.511 --> 21:36.511
we are new to this , we are new to that.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.722
There is nothing new because everything is within you.

21:38.923 --> 21:42.120
It's can be activated. There's nothing new, it's all within you.

21:42.321 --> 21:45.347
As any indian is, you are, there's no difference whatsoever.

21:45.548 --> 21:48.878
Only thing they have a little advanced that they can understand me

21:49.079 --> 21:51.821
faster than you can because they have the education.

21:52.037 --> 21:54.864
But as far as the mechanism is concerned, you are just the same.

21:55.110 --> 21:57.915
Don't have the idea that you are a new nation

21:58.116 --> 22:00.524
and all this thing have no meaning at all

22:00.725 --> 22:04.281
You are ancient people oer seekers of antiquities.

22:04.498 --> 22:07.884
Just don't worry about these things that you are a new nation.

22:08.085 --> 22:09.367
You were given this nation

22:09.568 --> 22:12.481
because you did such good in your last life.

22:12.695 --> 22:14.992
May God bless you!
