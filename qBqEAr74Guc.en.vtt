00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.000
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.800
At the very outset, I have to tell you that

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.080
truth is what it is.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.760
We cannot conceptualize it

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.320
or we cannot change it.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.520
Unfortunately we cannot also know it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.840
with this human awareness.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.680
We have to become a subtler being to know the truth;

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.600
that is, we have to be the Spirit.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.680
For that one has to understand that

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.800
it's a evolutionary living process.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.560
It is a living happening within us which makes you the Spirit,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.600
for which you cannot pay,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.760
you cannot put any efforts,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:25.480
but it just works because you are seekers of truth.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.560
Whatever I am telling you, you have to listen to it

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.400
with an open mind of a scientist.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.320
If it is proved to be

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:08.080
the truth, you have to accept it as honest people,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.160
because it is for your benevolence

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.640
and benevolence of the whole world.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:41.760
We see beautiful flowers here, but we take them for granted.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.200
We do not even think that they just come from small little seeds.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.240
Look at our eyes, what a micro-camera it is,

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.600
but we take it for granted.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.640
So, one must understand that there is some power

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.960
which does this living work.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:45.440
So the first truth is that you are not this body, this mind,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.280
this ego or conditionings,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.880
but you are, but you are pure Spirit.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.840
The second truth is that there is a subtle power

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.200
of divine love which does all the living work.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:34.160
Through that power only we have become from amoeba to this stage,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.480
and there is a very small breakthrough

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.880
that we have to achieve, to know the truth.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.080
We do not know the absolute truth.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.360
That is why we are quarreling with each other,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.200
fighting with each other, we have wars.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:32.360
But if all of us know the truth, it is only one...

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.520
As you all can see Me sitting here,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.000
you all know that I am sitting here, there's no quarrel about it.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.760
But when you become the Spirit, then you can feel

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.800
this all-pervading Power which you have never felt before.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:17.040
You feel it on your fingertips, and also

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:23.800
you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:40.880
In the Bible there is the God Almighty

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:47.200
as the Father God, and we have the Son God,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:55.280
and the Trinity, the third one is the Holy Ghost.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:17.280
But how can you have Father and the Son, and no Mother?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.520
The women are called as "second citizen"

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.560
because they say that She was not on the table

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:42.600
of the twelve apostles, who were having the Last Supper.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.520
But then how do you have Paul there,

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.680
who was not sitting on the supper table also?

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.680
But people could feel the Mother of Christ

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:27.440
as a Goddess, so they called her as a Madonna.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.880
And I can't understand,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:46.040
those who do not want Her as the Goddess

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:53.000
go and worship Her as Black Madonna in Poland.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.600
In the same way in every religion they have created problems,

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.800
because they wanted to have it organized

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.800
the way they wanted to have it.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.320
So the people concluded that there is no God,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:47.000
because whatever religion one may follow, they can commit any sin.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.960
So they lost faith in God.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.800
But when you will become Spirit

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.880
you will know that there is God Almighty

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:25.640
and His love, His All-pervading living power.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:39.560
It can be proved by Sahaja Yoga

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:46.480
that there is God, and there is His power of love.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.800
Whether you believe in God blindly

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.840
or don't believe in It, it's just the same.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.240
Many people come and tell Me that,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.000
"Mother, we pray to God and nothing happens to us.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.440
We are just like people who do not believe in God."

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.840
The reason is, you are not connected with God.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:46.800
If this machine is not connected to the mains, it won't work.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:57.200
If your telephone is not connected, it won't work.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:08.680
So the first thing is to get connected to this all-pervading Power.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.920
And all of you have got this divinity within yourself.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.680
You all can get your Self-Realization, and get connected

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.080
to this all-pervading Power.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.400
You should have no diffidence about it.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.920
It's so simple.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.960
"Sahaja" means it is born with you,

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.920
and all of you have the right to get this connection,

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:08.600
yoga, without any difficulty.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.080
As a result of that,

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:24.000
all your physical, mental, emotional problems can be solved.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.760
Even your material problems are solved.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:47.160
Above all, you enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.200
which is the ocean of joy.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.000
This is what is going to happen to you.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:14.240
This is extremely simple, which you cannot achieve

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.640
by reading, by studying or by doing anything.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.640
It is not the mental act,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.960
but it's a living happening.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:47.360
Today I think you have heard about the Kundalini

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.320
and the power which is within you.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:06.720
Tomorrow I will tell you about the nature of the Spirit.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:18.800
In this short time it is difficult to give the complete idea

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.640
of this knowledge of the roots.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.120
I must have given at least four thousand lectures

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.600
on this subject, in English language only.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.160
So, like here there are so many lights

00:18:53.360 --> 00:19:00.280
which we can put on with one switch,

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.080
but if I have to tell you about the electricity and its

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:18.200
history, and how it came here to Prague,

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.400
you'll get bored.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.520
Only one switch can open the light,

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.720
because it is all built in.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.040
In the same way it is all built in within you.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.360
So it is better to get this enlightenment,

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.400
and then to know about the subtle subject.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.280
But in any case,

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.600
I would like you to ask Me questions for a short time.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.560
Only My request is not to ask Me questions

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.720
which are not related to the subject.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.640
Please, try to understand

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.120
that I have not come here to take anything from you.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:09.920
I have come here to give you what is your own.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.680
You may ask Me questions.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.440
Remove all this from there.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:32.880
You can remove all this from the front, because people can't see Me.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.360
Very cold but it's all right.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.760
I'll have My spectacles. It's all right,

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.640
just I'll have My spectacles. Spectacles.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.320
Loudly.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.480
She said You were helping her in Vienna working on her ears,

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.360
but she doesn't hear yet.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.120
All right, that's different.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.280
I will see to it again. Did you meditate?

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.680
All right, we'll see it again.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.880
All right, sit down, we'll see it again.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.200
We'll see it tomorrow.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:50.800
They have no questions. Wonderful people!

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.320
When You open the Kundalini to the people,

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.400
how can the people keep it if they are not ready for this?

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.080
I first of all told you, have no diffidence,

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.960
and don't judge yourself.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.440
All right.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:39.240
The question was, if they are not ready.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.200
Your Kundalini knows everything about you.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:19.400
She is your Mother, your individual Mother,

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.920
and she's anxious to give you your second birth.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.040
Hearing now?

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.680
She started hearing.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.400
Little bit.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.200
She has said that to awaken Kundalini,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.000
to awake Kundalini we have to meditate for a long time.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.200
What does it mean, a long time to meditate?

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:34.160
You have already done it in previous lives, everything.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:49.440
That's why you are here. You are destined to be here.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.240
This lady wants.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.960
How do You see the future of the Earth?

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.520
Of what?

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:40.800
Of the Earth. Of our Earth, of our living, in the future.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.480
In Prague or?

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:52.280
How do You view the future of the mankind?

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.480
Great!

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.240
There are many wars in the world nowadays,

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.520
and very much of violence. Am I to understand

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:52.040
that these wars must come before the joy will come?

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.000
You see, these wars are because of the problems

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.880
with human beings who have created them.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.680
If you could transform human beings,

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.560
these problems will be solved automatically.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:36.720
If certain number of people are transformed, they'll trigger it.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:56.200
Already there are thousands who have been transformed,

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.600
and you can transform others when you are transformed.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.040
This lady.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.480
She's painting and doing very many things

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.760
with the romanys, with the gypsies.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:17.760
Any race, whether these are gypsies or any race,

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.120
can get their transformation.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.720
It has nothing to do with your race, your nationality,

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:43.040
or your religion, nothing to do. It is something inner, innate.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.840
As long as you are a human being it will work out.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.120
The best part of it,

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:09.840
that all so-called bad karmas are also washed off.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:37.680
Only human beings think that they do bad karmas, not the animals.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.720
He's asking whether this Sahaja Yoga

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.040
is based on faith in [unclear], in Christ.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.760
Of course, of course.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:30.800
But Christ has said that those who are not against us are with us.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:43.760
All these incarnations and all these prophets

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.640
are related to each other.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.680
So we see them separated,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.040
and this creates hatred between people.

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:31.280
This one is there.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:53.280
Shri Mataji, do You believe that Jesus Christ

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:59.520
was killed for our sins, to help us?

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:07.880
Yes, He suffered for us. He had to do that.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.800
But incarnations actually never suffer.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.000
He had to do it, which I will tell you later on,

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.880
because the way He had to go through a center of Agnya,

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.920
of optic chiasm was closed like this.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.240
So He had to get crucified for.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.800
His message is His resurrection,

00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:01.720
not crucifixion, Resurrection.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.040
But now we need not suffer.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:19.200
So those who say you must suffer, they are absolutely wrong.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.760
Are we going to suffer more than Christ?

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.200
How can we help the people who don't want

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.040
to get Realization, to get it?

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.760
They can't.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.880
They can't. You cannot force it.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:34.080
Kundalini is the power of pure desire.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:45.520
If you do not have pure desire, I cannot surpass your freedom.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:38:01.200
It has to be a personality like a good seed

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:08.080
which can be embedded in the Mother Earth.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:24.160
But you must have desire, otherwise it cannot be worked.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:32.160
You cannot force a seed to sprout.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.640
Now, this gentleman has a question. Yes.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:07.760
[Anyone is just] will learn how to raise our Kundalini?

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.560
All right, that's a good question,

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.160
that by raising the Kundalini of others

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.440
and also establishing yourself,

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.320
you become a righteous person,

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.080
and another also becomes the righteous person.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:54.000
They become really saintly people.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:05.240
They are peaceful, without any lust and greed.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:17.600
After all, this world is made by human beings,

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.960
and if the human beings are transformed,

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.000
the world will be transformed.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:51.360
Shri Mataji please are you connect with the Saint Grail?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.080
I don't know what you are saying, I don't follow.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:08.040
You should not worry about Me.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.640
I will not tell you anything about Myself.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:33.680
Christ said that He was the Son of God, which He was.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.000
But He said that, so they crucified Him.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.640
People don't want to hear truth,

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.480
unless and until they are realized souls.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:04.840
So I do not want to get crucified;

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.240
I have to do My work still.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.120
As it is because I say you cannot take money,

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.560
all these people who have made a business out of religion

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:31.360
and business out of all this false guru propagation,

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.520
they are all against Me.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.000
Also the religions have made a business,

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.880
all the religions have made a business nowadays,

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.320
so they don't like Me.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:17.080
You cannot make business out of God.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:31.640
So now I think we'll have the session of Self-Realization.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:53.200
For this again I have to say that I cannot force it

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.200
on anyone whatsoever.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:12.200
Only those who want it and desire it, should be in the hall.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.560
Otherwise they should leave the hall.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.960
The whole thing starts shaking if you get up, you know.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.840
Shri Mataji, they want to take Your vibrations down.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.920
They want to have their vibrations, they want Your vibrations down,

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.600
and get their Realization.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.640
I don't understand. You come from this side, I can't hear you.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.080
Shri Mataji, I've told them they should go down

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.200
and sit, sit in front of You to have Your vibrations.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.640
They wanted that?

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.040
See, once, even you come up it shakes and they get up with shakes.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.520
so let it be as they are. The whole things are shaking.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:16.320
And those who do not want should not sit here, please.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:41.240
So, at the very outset I have to again tell you

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:48.840
that be fully confident that you all will get your Realization.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:05.240
The second thing is, there are three conditions

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.440
which you have to understand.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:21.160
The first condition is that you have to forget the past,

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:31.000
and you are not to feel guilty at all.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.680
You are after all human beings,

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:48.120
and if you have done any mistakes, it's all right, you are not God.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:03.560
But feeling guilty is some sort of a mental torture.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.560
But also when you feel guilty,

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.960
this center here catches on the left-hand side,

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.680
and you physically also torture yourself.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:37.320
Because when this center is caught up,

00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:43.880
then you get angina, spondylitis, all these diseases.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.800
So what's the use of feeling guilty?

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.960
Please do not feel guilty.

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.400
When I say "Don't feel guilty", many people are leaving,

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.240
because they want to feel guilty and get sick.

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.240
Now the third condition is

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:43.960
that you should forgive everyone in general.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:54.360
Some people say it is very difficult,

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:03.520
but whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.040
Again, when you don't forgive,

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.600
then you torture yourself for nothing at all.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:28.080
So you should not even think of people whom you are to forgive.

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.000
Just say "I forgive everyone."

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.360
and immediately you'll feel better.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.520
That's all.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:03.120
Now to take the help from the Mother Earth,

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.880
you have to take out your shoes, that's all.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:17.320
Please put your left and right foot away from each other.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.880
Just for about five, ten minutes, that's all.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:40.360
Now as he has told you, there are two powers, left and right

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.600
So...

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:55.880
After, after, after the meditation, all right?

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.480
This little one. I'd like to take one.

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:03.560
All right. Let him, now. Now, that's all. Sit down, sit down.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:16.440
So put your left side on one side, and right side on another.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:22.040
Left side represents your desire power

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:39.040
and right side represents your action power.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:54.800
So please put your left hand on the left side, on the lap,

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:14.280
and the right side we will use for

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:19.720
nourishing our centers on the left-hand side.

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.960
First we'll show you

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:42.080
how to touch your different centers

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.440
on the left hand side,

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.000
to nourish them.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.920
So please see first of all, and then we'll have to close the eyes.

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.920
Put the right hand on your heart.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:26.640
This is the center where there's the reflection

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:31.800
of God Almighty as Spirit.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.600
And Kundalini is the reflection

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.880
of the Holy Ghost, the primordial Mother.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.880
Now, please take your right hand

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.400
in the upper portion of your abdomen.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:20.400
This is the center of your mastery.

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:28.080
When you become the Spirit,

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:31.720
you become your own guide.

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:47.200
Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen,

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.200
on the left-hand side.

00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:03.760
This is the center which is for pure knowledge,

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:15.160
with which we work out all divine work.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.880
Then raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen,

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.800
on the left-hand side.

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:48.120
Now raise your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.800
and turn your head to your right.

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:05.120
This center you catch when you feel guilty.

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:15.000
Now please take your hand on your forehead across,

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:25.080
and bend your head as far as possible.

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:37.080
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:57.000
Now please take your right hand to the back side of your head

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.040
and push back your head.

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:12.840
This is the center where without feeling guilty,

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.440
without counting mistakes,

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:24.240
for your satisfaction you have to say,

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:31.840
forgive, you have to ask forgiveness from the divine Power.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:50.240
Now you have to stretch your palm

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:57.920
and put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area,

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.960
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.320
Now push back your fingers,

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:16.720
and put down your head as far as possible,

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:28.200
so there is a good pressure on your scalp. Push back your fingers.

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.160
Put down your head.

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:42.240
Now you move your scalp seven times clockwise, slowly.

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:11.400
Put down your head.

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:20.800
Now, that's all you have to do.

00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:27.600
Now please

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.360
put both your feet apart from each other,

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.120
left hand towards Me,

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:41.960
and do not sit too much bent down or forward, but comfortably.

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:56.560
Now, please put your right hand on your heart.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:06.880
Left hand towards Me, on your lap.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.360
Now please close your eyes.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:23.960
Here you have to ask Me a fundamental question, three times.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.400
You can call Me "Mother" or "Shri Mataji" -

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.640
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.040
Loudly.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:59.200
If you are the Spirit you become your guide, your master.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.760
So please take down your right hand

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:14.120
on the left-hand side of your abdomen, in the upper part.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.960
We are working only on the left side.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:32.080
Here you have to

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.280
ask another question,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.920
"Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:05.720
I have already told you that I cannot force

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.040
pure knowledge on you,

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.680
because I respect your freedom.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.920
You have to ask for it.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.960
Now please take your right hand

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:37.520
in the lower portion of your abdomen, and press it hard.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.960
Here you have to say six times,

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.480
because this center has got six petals,

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:05.960
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:17.840
Six times.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:25.720
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.440
the Kundalini starts rising higher.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.960
So now we have to nourish the upper centers

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:53.080
with our self-confidence.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.240
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.520
of your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:19.280
Here you have to say with full confidence,

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:25.400
ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:12.200
I've already told you that you are not this body,

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:18.240
not this mind, not this ego or these conditionings,

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.800
but you are pure Spirit.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.760
So now raise your right hand onto your heart,

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.880
and here you have to say

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:53.200
with full confidence ten times, twelve times,

01:05:53.400 --> 01:06:00.520
"Mother, I am the Spirit."

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:15.080
Ten times, twelve times.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.040
This all-pervading Power is the power

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.560
of compassion and love.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:46.320
It is the ocean of absolute knowledge.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.080
Loudly, loudly.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:56.080
Loudly you must say.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.800
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness,

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:11.440
and whatever mistakes you might commit,

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:23.680
this ocean can dissolve it very easily.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:33.960
So please forgive yourself, and put your hand

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:38.520
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.760
and turn your head to your right.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.160
Here with full confidence say sixteen times,

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:59.200
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.440
I have already told you

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:23.480
that whether you forgive or don't forgive,

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.400
you don't do anything;

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.600
but if you don't forgive, then

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.200
you play into wrong hands.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.560
So,

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:57.720
now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across,

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.960
and please put down your head as far as possible.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.160
Here you have to say with full confidence

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:22.680
from your heart, not how many times,

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:28.000
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.880
Now,

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:57.520
please take your right hand on the back side of your head,

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:01.200
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Here, without feeling guilty,

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.840
without counting your mistakes,

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.720
just for your satisfaction you have to say

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:25.000
from your heart, not how many times,

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.960
"Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me."

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:19.280
Now stretch your hand fully,

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.760
your palm fully, and put the center of your palm

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.000
on top of your head.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.960
Now push back your fingers.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:46.840
Please put down your head.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:59.200
Here again, I cannot cross over your freedom.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:11.800
You have to ask for your Self-Realization.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:25.720
So move your scalp seven times slowly clockwise, asking,

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:32.040
"Mother, please give me Self-Realization" - seven times.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:59.320
Now please take down your hands.

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.960
Please put both the hands towards Me like this.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.480
[Gavin], get up.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:24.040
And now put the right hand towards Me like this.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.840
Please stand up.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.960
Please stand up and show otherwise they will not know.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.120
Please put right hand towards Me,

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.000
and put down your head

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.000
and see for yourself with the left hand,

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:48.840
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.080
Loudly, loudly, loudly.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.880
If it is hot, means you have not forgiven,

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.880
so please forgive and don’t feel guilty.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.400
Now left hand towards Me,

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.640
but bend your head, bend your head.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:44.200
Now please see with your right hand

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.920
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head,

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.480
or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.920
Don’t put the hand on top of your head. Away from it.

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.040
Sometimes you get it far away.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.040
Now please put again your right hand.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.080
And put down your head and see for yourself

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.840
again with the left hand.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:52.320
Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky, like this.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.000
Loudly, loudly.

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.440
And push back your head.

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:10.480
And ask any one of these questions three times,

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:19.080
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:31.440
or “Mother, is this the power of Divine Love?”

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.560
or “Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:49.400
Ask any one of these questions, any one question three times.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.280
Now take down your hands please.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:13.840
Now put your hands like this towards Me. Open your eyes.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.680
Watch Me without thinking.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:41.080
Those who have felt cold or hot breeze,

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.680
on their fingertips

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:49.840
or in their hands, or on the fontanel bone area,

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.560
please raise both your hands.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.080
Prague!

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:25.640
All of you have become saints now. I bow to you all.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:34.160
Your saintly life has started.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:44.840
Tomorrow I will come again and explain to you about the Spirit.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:54.880
May God bless you all.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:01.480
Please inform your friends and also call them,

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:06.160
because I am here only for tomorrow.

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:22.320
Those who have felt the cool breeze or hot breeze

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.320
will settle down tomorrow,

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:31.320
and those who have not felt at all will also feel it.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:56.520
May God bless you all.

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.680
You see how it is, it's shaking.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.480
Also tell them not to talk about it.

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:30.760
It is beyond your mind. To be quiet.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.600
Don’t discuss it.
