00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:04.209
I bow to all the sahaja yogis of the world.

00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:19.083
It is very heartening

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:25.209
to see so many of you assembled here to do the Guru Puja.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:47.417
To worship your Guru in person is regarded as the highest blessing.

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:04.584
But in My case it’s a very different combination

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:08.876
that I am your Mother and your Guru.

00:08:17.334 --> 00:08:23.792
So you can understand how Shri Ganesha worshipped his Mother.

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:33.209
You all are created in the same image of Shri Ganesha

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:41.417
who worshipped His Mother

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.918
and then He became the Adi Guru, the first Guru.

00:08:52.167 --> 00:08:57.792
He is the primordial essence of mastery.

00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:08.250
Only the Mother can make the child a master.

00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:15.542
And the motherhood in any Guru – whether male or female –

00:09:16.334 --> 00:09:20.042
can only make the disciple a Guru.

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:33.501
So, first you have to become the prophets

00:09:33.999 --> 00:09:37.584
and develop that motherhood within yourself,

00:09:39.375 --> 00:09:44.083
then you can make others also prophets.

00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:01.209
Now, to become a Guru,

00:10:03.501 --> 00:10:08.876
what do we have to do after our realisation?

00:10:15.083 --> 00:10:18.584
Guru word means gravity.

00:10:23.501 --> 00:10:26.542
Gravity means a person who is grave

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:32.000
who is deep, who is magnetic.

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:42.918
Now as you have learnt in Sahaja Yoga

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:47.417
that realisation takes place in complete effortlessness.

00:10:56.999 --> 00:11:02.959
So normally a Guru tries to make his disciples effortless,

00:11:11.542 --> 00:11:16.751
which is called as prayatna shaytilya – means ‘relax your efforts‘.

00:11:25.542 --> 00:11:28.584
Without doing anything you got

00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:32.959
your prayatna shaytilya, otherwise Kundalini would not have risen.

00:11:43.542 --> 00:11:48.334
Then the second stage is vichara shaithilya – the thoughtless awareness.

00:11:56.959 --> 00:12:00.417
This also you got it without doing anything.

00:12:05.667 --> 00:12:10.709
And the third is complete negation of thought, abhava,

00:12:15.334 --> 00:12:18.209
and the bliss of peace.

00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:25.042
So one has to understand that

00:12:25.292 --> 00:12:28.125
you have to pass then, through three stages.

00:12:33.042 --> 00:12:35.709
First, when you get your realisation

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:40.999
all these things come spontaneously, for that moment.

00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:51.417
When you raise the Kundalini of others,

00:12:51.626 --> 00:12:54.584
these things happen to them spontaneously.

00:12:59.167 --> 00:13:01.250
You too have that power now

00:13:01.542 --> 00:13:05.999
to raise the Kundalini of people and to establish it in them.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.626
But we must understand why it has to be done that way,

00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:25.751
why we have to have vichara shaithilya –

00:13:29.417 --> 00:13:33.250
because when you project any thought,

00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:35.250
it is artificial,

00:13:41.792 --> 00:13:43.459
it is not reality.

00:13:45.334 --> 00:13:48.375
Thought always stands between you and the reality.

00:13:53.209 --> 00:13:59.918
When you put in an effort, you stand against becoming.

00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:15.334
For example, if I have to cure you

00:14:16.292 --> 00:14:19.834
I just put my hand and finished – no effort,

00:14:25.334 --> 00:14:28.334
because I am that.

00:14:30.209 --> 00:14:34.999
You get your realisation because I am that.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:42.959
I don’t put in any effort, I don’t think about it, I am that.

00:14:49.167 --> 00:14:52.876
Just looking at someone, it can be done.

00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:02.751
Just putting attention to someone, it can be done.

00:15:07.501 --> 00:15:11.792
Just with a small desire, it can be done –

00:15:15.542 --> 00:15:21.000
because you are that. You can mould it the way you like.

00:15:28.667 --> 00:15:31.167
You can get an example from gold.

00:15:31.751 --> 00:15:34.000
Now gold is untarnishable

00:15:34.209 --> 00:15:37.083
It does not have to think it is untarnishable,

00:15:37.334 --> 00:15:41.250
it does not have to put in an effort it is untarnishable – it is.

00:15:54.083 --> 00:16:00.959
So to be, to be, you don’t have to put in any effort.

00:16:01.209 --> 00:16:05.042
If you have to put in an effort, that means you are not yet that.

00:16:14.834 --> 00:16:19.626
If you look at the sun – it shines.

00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:24.918
It doesn’t have to put in effort to shine – it shines.

00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:36.918
So to be that, if you have to put in an effort,

00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:40.918
that means you are not that, you are trying, you are artificial.

00:16:50.918 --> 00:16:55.667
The flowers are beautiful so they don’t have to beautify themselves.

00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:06.417
And this is what one has to understand – that innately

00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:11.083
if you are that,  if you have already become,

00:17:11.334 --> 00:17:14.000
then what is the need to put in any more effort?

00:17:25.792 --> 00:17:28.959
But when we say these things, you see,

00:17:29.167 --> 00:17:31.751
then people think you have to be lethargic,

00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:43.709
that you need not do anything,

00:17:46.417 --> 00:17:49.250
you become a Guru without doing anything.

00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:56.709
That’s why, at the very outset, I said it goes in stages.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:06.501
So the first stage is of Shri Ganesha –

00:18:09.959 --> 00:18:13.999
how He surrenders to the Shakti, to the Mother –

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:21.834
that is the beginning. If one cannot surrender…

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.417
That doesn’t mean you don’t do anything,

00:18:24.626 --> 00:18:27.584
but surrendering means the worship,

00:18:40.417 --> 00:18:42.792
the respect of the higher,

00:18:46.999 --> 00:18:49.876
the obedience to the higher.

00:18:53.626 --> 00:18:55.751
Not to argue it out,

00:18:58.959 --> 00:19:03.125
not to react, acceptance,

00:19:05.417 --> 00:19:10.876
absorption. Like a child absorbs the milk of the mother

00:19:15.667 --> 00:19:19.125
without questioning, without reasoning.

00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:23.959
That’s why Christ has said, “You have to become like children”.

00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:31.792
But if you are questioning, then you are no more a child.

00:19:33.792 --> 00:19:35.542
So first is the state,

00:19:35.751 --> 00:19:39.083
which you have to develop, is the child-like state.

00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:47.709
But child, which is a realised child, which has to have a gravity.

00:19:51.959 --> 00:19:58.292
If you can develop childhood first,

00:19:58.584 --> 00:20:01.876
then everything takes proper course,

00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:14.999
because maturity cannot take place unless

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:17.876
and until you start from the very beginning,

00:20:25.667 --> 00:20:29.584
and gravity means maturity not frivolousness.

00:20:35.501 --> 00:20:37.959
So now the quality of Ganesha, as you know,

00:20:38.167 --> 00:20:41.459
is that He has viveka, means He has discretion.

00:20:47.417 --> 00:20:50.876
He ‘has’ means He is discretion.

00:20:54.083 --> 00:20:57.876
So try to develop your discretion power

00:21:03.083 --> 00:21:11.584
so that Shri Ganesha gives you the wisdom – subuddhi – wisdom.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:21.083
And this is why you have to have a dependence on Shri Ganesha.

00:21:25.999 --> 00:21:31.959
So at this point you have to make a negation of efforts.

00:21:35.876 --> 00:21:42.334
Like, whatever are efforts anti-Ganesha,

00:21:42.667 --> 00:21:46.999
or anti-innocence must be negated.

00:21:54.542 --> 00:22:02.375
So the negation of effort

00:22:02.792 --> 00:22:08.792
is to be achieved by negating whatever is the effort –

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:17.999
means the effort of negation.

00:22:22.459 --> 00:22:25.375
So in the beginning you will not be effortless,

00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:36.834
you will have to put in effort for that.

00:22:42.083 --> 00:22:45.918
Like Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:59.876
So how do you make your eyes innocent?

00:23:03.209 --> 00:23:10.000
In Sahaja Yoga we have a method by which we try to distract our eyes

00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:16.501
from effort that makes it adulterous.

00:23:28.125 --> 00:23:30.834
Like, we try to put our attention, our eyes,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.792
on the Mother Earth, on the grass, on the trees.

00:23:40.542 --> 00:23:46.626
So the avoidance, the avoiding of the effort itself is effort.

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:58.000
So those people who have come now,

00:23:59.459 --> 00:24:03.000
recently, have to understand also that they have to put in

00:24:03.209 --> 00:24:06.626
all kinds of efforts to stop the efforts.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:23.375
For example, some people are used to very comfortable life,

00:24:23.542 --> 00:24:26.083
they may talk of all kinds of renunciation,

00:24:26.292 --> 00:24:29.334
when it comes to comfort, they want to have comfort.

00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:42.501
Such people should try to get out of the habit of comfort –

00:24:42.709 --> 00:24:45.918
Sleep on the ground, sleep on the Mother Earth.

00:25:06.334 --> 00:25:08.417
Some people have an attention

00:25:08.626 --> 00:25:10.626
which is all the time looking this side, that side –

00:25:10.792 --> 00:25:13.209
cannot see to one point – so fix your attention.

00:25:26.918 --> 00:25:31.918
So gradually, you will find, you’ll discipline yourself.

00:25:38.334 --> 00:25:41.375
So the effort that you put in

00:25:41.792 --> 00:25:46.083
is very important in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:54.584 --> 00:25:56.667
Another thing is very common, in the West,

00:25:56.959 --> 00:25:59.834
is the harsh tongue, the sarcasm

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:05.834
and hurting others – is a very subtle way of violence.

00:26:16.417 --> 00:26:20.709
Or if they are really blunt

00:26:20.959 --> 00:26:25.709
they can start with ego expressions also “I, I, I…”

00:26:33.292 --> 00:26:34.876
Such people should stop talking

00:26:35.042 --> 00:26:38.334
completely, make an effort to stop – just don’t talk.

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:46.709
Now watch your mind – is it

00:26:46.959 --> 00:26:50.709
is it trying to talk something sarcastic, nonsensical?

00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:04.375
So, this watching also requires effort.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.292
So, to sprout the seed is easy,

00:27:15.542 --> 00:27:20.375
but then one has to put in the effort to look after the little plant.

00:27:34.792 --> 00:27:38.667
And when it matures, then it’s on its own.

00:27:45.584 --> 00:27:50.834
So the, first the effort should be made to protect yourself

00:27:51.042 --> 00:27:54.334
against the mind which you have built in,

00:27:54.584 --> 00:27:56.459
through your ego or superego,

00:27:56.626 --> 00:28:00.918
that goes into the wrong direction of effort.

00:28:16.751 --> 00:28:20.792
But sometimes, be very careful, you have to be discreet.

00:28:28.918 --> 00:28:35.125
And the best way to be safe on discretion is to keep in the centre –

00:28:35.292 --> 00:28:38.709
never go to any extreme of anything.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.459
For example, some people are fond of music, say,

00:28:52.125 --> 00:28:55.542
so they’ll go on after the music part of it.

00:29:00.626 --> 00:29:03.542
Some people, say, are fond of poetry,

00:29:03.834 --> 00:29:06.667
then they’ll go after the poetry only.

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:16.167
There is nothing wrong in those things,

00:29:18.626 --> 00:29:20.876
but whatever you achieve in all these things

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.209
must be brought back to the collective

00:29:23.417 --> 00:29:25.751
and must be enjoyed by everyone,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.083
and you should also enjoy what others have found.

00:29:45.751 --> 00:29:51.667
For example, somebody is a very learned man and a dry person.

00:29:58.751 --> 00:30:03.959
So he has to make an effort to make himself sweet.

00:30:08.751 --> 00:30:14.459
So try to neutralise your extreme nature by coming in the centre,

00:30:22.876 --> 00:30:26.959
and the best way to say is, “I like everything.

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:39.000
The way You keep me, I am happy in that state.”

00:30:46.792 --> 00:30:51.709
And to suggest yourself that, “I am the peace”

00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:56.250
– suggest, autosuggestion,

00:31:03.584 --> 00:31:08.751
“I am the satisfaction, I am the dignity.”

00:31:10.542 --> 00:31:14.334
Try to impose these artificialities upon yourself

00:31:23.667 --> 00:31:26.709
of these virtues and righteousness,

00:31:32.751 --> 00:31:37.375
and then ask yourself “If I am dignified how can I do such a thing?”

00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:42.083
Ask yourself, you judge yourself with those.

00:31:54.876 --> 00:31:57.667
For example, somebody is a miserly person

00:31:57.959 --> 00:32:00.083
and he says, “Oh you must be generous” –

00:32:00.292 --> 00:32:02.417
then you can call him a hypocrite.

00:32:08.042 --> 00:32:13.000
But supposing the miserly, you see, questions himself

00:32:13.501 --> 00:32:16.125
then he is not a hypocrite.

00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:32.626
So when you put all these artificial, so-called,

00:32:32.999 --> 00:32:38.792
values upon yourself – sort of a goal –

00:32:39.042 --> 00:32:43.459
and then try to achieve that goal through your own effort,

00:32:43.834 --> 00:32:45.999
then you become that.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:15.751
So automatically you criticise yourself and you don’t criticise others

00:33:21.459 --> 00:33:25.667
and you know what’s wrong with you.

00:33:28.999 --> 00:33:32.000
Because, what’s the use of knowing what’s wrong with others?

00:33:36.751 --> 00:33:39.918
It is like England trying to improve the conditions in India,

00:33:40.125 --> 00:33:43.501
and India trying to improve the conditions in England.

00:33:47.459 --> 00:33:51.125
But in this also human brain has an escape.

00:33:55.125 --> 00:33:58.417
When they want to criticise themselves, they find a pouch

00:33:58.667 --> 00:34:02.542
called the left Vishuddhi and become settled there.

00:34:13.292 --> 00:34:16.375
The more cunning you are, the more clever you are,

00:34:16.626 --> 00:34:18.751
the worse is the left Vishuddhi.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:28.209
Then you put everything there, settled down nicely to stagnate,

00:34:28.584 --> 00:34:30.918
to get all kinds of filth in it

00:34:31.125 --> 00:34:34.417
and to be settled with yourself nicely.

00:34:46.792 --> 00:34:48.792
It’s like any lousy housewife –

00:34:49.083 --> 00:34:50.542
she takes all the dirt of the house

00:34:50.751 --> 00:34:53.584
and all that and piles up into a room, locks it up,

00:34:53.918 --> 00:34:56.250
and thinks,  oh she has been very efficient.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.292
You have to face it and you have to correct it and see to it!

00:35:16.751 --> 00:35:19.709
And that’s how you become powerful.

00:35:21.709 --> 00:35:24.042
Because if your machinery is out of gear,

00:35:24.292 --> 00:35:27.417
what’s the use of improving somebody else’s machinery?

00:35:32.501 --> 00:35:34.501
And when your machinery is out of gear,

00:35:34.751 --> 00:35:36.209
you put it in a lock and key,

00:35:36.459 --> 00:35:38.834
and lock it up and say, “Now it’s alright.”

00:35:46.626 --> 00:35:49.834
Or you blame somebody because of this, because of that –

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.751
something else other than you.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.250
Thank God to Sahaja Yoga today that you all have got realisation,

00:36:05.459 --> 00:36:08.501
so I don’t have to do all that cleaning, you can do yourself.

00:36:15.918 --> 00:36:20.459
So, in short, you become your own Guru to begin with.

00:36:23.876 --> 00:36:26.834
You try to tell yourself, separate yourself from yourself

00:36:27.042 --> 00:36:31.751
and say, “Hello Sir, how are you now, come along.”

00:36:41.792 --> 00:36:44.459
But in Sahaja Yoga, you see, people

00:36:45.375 --> 00:36:50.000
suddenly assume, you see, a big sort of a ego nonsense,

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.959
and they think they are big gurus,

00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:55.000
you see, big, great people, avadhutas, you see, like that.

00:37:05.042 --> 00:37:07.042
And if you ask them,

00:37:07.209 --> 00:37:09.834
they say, “Mother, Mother I loved You very much.”

00:37:19.459 --> 00:37:21.959
So they think if they love Me, then it is My duty

00:37:22.167 --> 00:37:24.626
that I should really keep you clean.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:36.709
That’s not the attitude of a guru.

00:37:39.999 --> 00:37:44.834
What guru does, is to purify himself and others

00:37:45.042 --> 00:37:49.417
and give those flowers to the Deity.

00:37:55.417 --> 00:37:59.584
Till you all become gurus, I am your Guru,

00:37:59.999 --> 00:38:02.375
but once you become the guru

00:38:02.918 --> 00:38:05.542
then I become your Deity.

00:38:10.083 --> 00:38:17.125
Till they are not yet gurus, I am their Guru.

00:38:17.834 --> 00:38:19.542
Till they reach that state.

00:38:19.834 --> 00:38:24.167
Once they become the guru, then I am their Deity.

00:38:34.918 --> 00:38:39.834
Like all the Gurus, we can say Mohammad sahib –

00:38:40.209 --> 00:38:43.375
He talked of “Allah Hu Akbar.”

00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:50.125
He talked of the Holy Ghost,

00:38:51.209 --> 00:38:54.501
He talked of the resurrection,

00:38:54.876 --> 00:38:57.667
because He was a Guru.

00:38:57.999 --> 00:39:02.417
And whatever He had to say, He said it with full confidence

00:39:02.667 --> 00:39:05.250
pointing out towards the point where

00:39:05.542 --> 00:39:09.709
He looks, or where He gets His guidance from.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:26.167
Like Moses, like Christ also put His two fingers denoting His Father

00:39:29.876 --> 00:39:33.709
So till you become your own guru,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.709
you have to put in effort in the beginning.

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:49.959
Then gradually you can achieve it effortlessly.

00:39:55.918 --> 00:40:00.000
Effortlessness is not to be certified,

00:40:02.999 --> 00:40:05.626
but you can verify it.

00:40:07.167 --> 00:40:10.250
A person who is discrete –

00:40:10.667 --> 00:40:14.167
in his presence others become discrete.

00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:26.792
A person who is honest – others in his presence become honest.

00:40:31.209 --> 00:40:35.834
It is said in Sanskrit language, ‘Yatha raja tatha praja’ –

00:40:36.083 --> 00:40:39.459
‘As the king is that’s how the subjects are’.

00:40:45.083 --> 00:40:49.250
When you are the guru, you are the example.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.999
You have to be the example.

00:40:55.999 --> 00:40:59.250
Now I have seen people who are gurus, who think,

00:40:59.459 --> 00:41:02.250
call themselves gurus, in different varieties and different

00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:04.999
types of life: like professors, teachers,

00:41:05.167 --> 00:41:07.417
you can call them, not spiritual gurus.

00:41:19.334 --> 00:41:21.792
They too, when they try

00:41:22.292 --> 00:41:25.417
to follow a mundane type of life –

00:41:25.667 --> 00:41:27.999
not of something exceptional –

00:41:28.334 --> 00:41:32.584
then their disciples lose faith in them.

00:41:47.125 --> 00:41:50.334
Even political leaders, when they…

00:41:50.584 --> 00:41:54.125
supposing a political leader is licentious, he has weaknesses,

00:41:54.709 --> 00:42:03.250
then the people who try to follow him have no respect.

00:42:14.501 --> 00:42:17.250
So they too have to have a personal character,

00:42:17.459 --> 00:42:20.292
a personal value system.

00:42:29.459 --> 00:42:32.834
So what about the spiritual gurus then?

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.125
They have to be excellent people.

00:42:42.167 --> 00:42:48.709
There should be no two types of life, one outside, one inside.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:59.751
When the outside and inside becomes one, then it is effortless

00:43:09.209 --> 00:43:11.584
and that is what one has to do –

00:43:11.834 --> 00:43:18.125
the inside and the outside, one has to work it out from inside.

00:43:23.709 --> 00:43:27.375
For that you cannot bring the outside inside,

00:43:27.667 --> 00:43:31.250
but inside has to go outside.

00:43:34.876 --> 00:43:38.751
So this is the beginning of antar yoga, the inner yoga.

00:43:42.959 --> 00:43:47.209
At the second stage you have to become thoughtless.

00:43:50.459 --> 00:43:53.999
This is very important in the West

00:43:54.709 --> 00:43:58.417
because they live in thoughts – they do not have other problems

00:43:58.751 --> 00:44:00.918
of a gross nature.

00:44:09.292 --> 00:44:10.667
For example,

00:44:10.834 --> 00:44:17.167
they are brought up in such a way that they are frightened of law.

00:44:24.792 --> 00:44:28.042
They are brought up this way – they’ll keep all their carpets clean,

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:29.792
everything clean, you see,

00:44:29.999 --> 00:44:33.042
very particular about keeping every place clean.

00:44:42.125 --> 00:44:46.542
All the gross things they keep clean,

00:44:56.334 --> 00:45:05.250
and then when they try to adjust themselves, they adjust within.

00:45:11.125 --> 00:45:13.584
Outwardly they are gentlemanly,

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.626
but inside, in their thought, they are not clean.

00:45:24.709 --> 00:45:28.000
In their behaviour they are not clean, their eyes are not clean,

00:45:31.626 --> 00:45:33.375
it’s poison inside.

00:45:34.709 --> 00:45:37.292
And they like that poison to be taken out –

00:45:37.417 --> 00:45:40.334
sometimes it comes out as sarcasm,

00:45:44.501 --> 00:45:49.501
it comes out as their sinister acts of aggression on other countries.

00:45:56.292 --> 00:45:59.626
They may plan out the complete destruction of the world

00:46:04.334 --> 00:46:08.417
and they don’t think there’s anything wrong in it

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:13.626
because it is ‘an ideology’ for which, is a thought

00:46:13.876 --> 00:46:15.167
they are fighting for.

00:46:22.667 --> 00:46:25.709
As long as there is an ideology, there’s a thought,

00:46:25.959 --> 00:46:29.918
there’s some sort of a sublime talk, then they can do what they like.

00:46:41.167 --> 00:46:44.459
This filth is very sophisticated.

00:46:48.459 --> 00:46:51.417
Like the people who don’t take their baths can use some

00:46:51.667 --> 00:46:55.834
artificial things to get a fragrance.

00:46:59.792 --> 00:47:02.083
Inside has to be clean

00:47:03.959 --> 00:47:08.999
and that’s why first the efforts are to be made to have good thoughts.

00:47:14.918 --> 00:47:17.250
Watch your mind –

00:47:19.125 --> 00:47:21.999
how does it think about others?

00:47:24.083 --> 00:47:28.876
I would say, racialism is one of the diseases of the same thing.

00:47:34.918 --> 00:47:38.334
I have seen people who are very well placed,

00:47:38.542 --> 00:47:41.167
sophisticated, wear immaculate dresses:

00:47:41.459 --> 00:47:48.042
when it comes to a person from a developing country,  or from say,

00:47:48.292 --> 00:47:54.250
another colour complexion, they come out with a remark,

00:47:54.626 --> 00:48:00.167
even if they are Sahaja Yogis I have seen they do it.

00:48:17.667 --> 00:48:21.417
I am saying this for the Sahaja Yogis and not for others.

00:48:24.417 --> 00:48:31.167
That suddenly that dead stuff, which we call as dead, becomes alive.

00:48:39.167 --> 00:48:42.459
So the mind is dirty,

00:48:43.792 --> 00:48:50.667
full of lust, greed, and anger, jealousy –

00:48:54.125 --> 00:48:59.167
and that’s why we have to be very, very careful.
Those people who have become sophisticated

00:48:59.459 --> 00:49:02.834
their weaknesses have also become sophisticated,

00:49:09.125 --> 00:49:12.542
and that’s why jealousy is a common disease.

00:49:15.792 --> 00:49:18.501
Like the other day I asked someone,

00:49:18.709 --> 00:49:21.542
“Why the father is angry with the son,

00:49:28.626 --> 00:49:31.626
and with his own brother?”

00:49:31.999 --> 00:49:34.000
So the answer was, “Because

00:49:34.334 --> 00:49:38.584
the brother is looking after the son in London.”

00:50:00.375 --> 00:50:03.417
Normally any person should be thankful

00:50:03.709 --> 00:50:08.125
that: somebody is looking after my son in my absence.

00:50:13.334 --> 00:50:16.042
But the fellow is jealous

00:50:16.334 --> 00:50:19.250
because of possessiveness

00:50:19.709 --> 00:50:22.792
and the possessiveness comes out of insecurity,

00:50:25.751 --> 00:50:28.667
and insecurity comes within us

00:50:28.999 --> 00:50:32.167
because we make others insecured.

00:50:39.918 --> 00:50:43.709
There are many reasons for insecurity,  but one of them is

00:50:43.876 --> 00:50:48.000
because we are ugly and we see that ugliness in others.

00:51:00.792 --> 00:51:04.083
Now this inside filth has to be taken out

00:51:04.334 --> 00:51:07.709
with greater effort than the outside filth,

00:51:15.709 --> 00:51:18.918
and that inside filth

00:51:19.334 --> 00:51:22.584
you can watch and see within yourself.

00:51:32.999 --> 00:51:36.626
Some people try to dominate others, to tell them things –

00:51:36.876 --> 00:51:39.584
just for the bossiness of it.

00:51:51.584 --> 00:51:56.542
Now watch out – first of all, have you bossed yourself enough?

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.209
Have you mastered yourself enough?

00:52:07.459 --> 00:52:12.459
Are you master of your own or you are still lacking in that?

00:52:20.459 --> 00:52:23.667
Those who have not mastered themselves want to have others,

00:52:23.959 --> 00:52:26.501
to master them.

00:52:34.042 --> 00:52:39.209
But the one who is the master of oneself, need not master anyone.

00:52:42.083 --> 00:52:45.125
He becomes the master.

00:52:45.834 --> 00:52:49.042
He doesn’t have to put in any effort, he masters.

00:52:53.834 --> 00:52:56.999
And there are so many tricks by which he can master,

00:53:02.083 --> 00:53:06.334
so many things by which he can correct.

00:53:11.584 --> 00:53:18.751
He may not say, he may not do anything, but just he manages.

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:29.667
Everyone learns a lesson without his doing anything about it.

00:53:38.209 --> 00:53:42.792
But they know that somebody is a master of masters.

00:53:48.083 --> 00:53:50.626
Maybe, such a person will be very unassuming

00:53:50.876 --> 00:53:53.375
simple, innocent looking,

00:54:03.709 --> 00:54:08.834
but that’s Mahamaya, that’s the illusion.

00:54:10.083 --> 00:54:16.876
So, the person who is that power doesn’t want to show it outside,

00:54:25.792 --> 00:54:33.751
on the contrary, it shows in such a way that people know it.

00:54:42.667 --> 00:54:46.292
I mean, the way things happen in life,

00:54:46.584 --> 00:54:51.125
we start understanding that we don’t have to put up any show –

00:55:00.083 --> 00:55:04.209
someone knows everything.

00:55:06.876 --> 00:55:11.918
When we have someone like that, try to follow.

00:55:18.417 --> 00:55:24.792
So, in the third stage the effort should be to follow your Guru

00:55:32.709 --> 00:55:35.501
who is a Sat Guru.

00:55:39.292 --> 00:55:45.918
Now that one becomes the one…a pattern, which you have to follow.

00:55:50.042 --> 00:55:54.167
But in this also Sahaja Yogis can be very superficial.

00:55:59.667 --> 00:56:03.584
One of the Sahaja Yogis used to wear a shawl in a particular way.

00:56:03.918 --> 00:56:06.292
So, I sent him some other sahaja yogis that

00:56:06.584 --> 00:56:10.000
he will try to help them, he can be their guru;

00:56:10.792 --> 00:56:15.167
they all started wearing shawls the same way.

00:56:35.626 --> 00:56:40.375
It’s not the outside; you have to follow the inside.

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:50.999
So when you become the guru, become the guru, you become.

00:56:54.167 --> 00:57:00.709
It’s such a short method – just to become.

00:57:02.792 --> 00:57:04.918
Now if you face yourself, you’ll know

00:57:05.083 --> 00:57:08.334
that there are still some steps you have to cross to become.

00:57:13.959 --> 00:57:16.167
Even now when I am lecturing to you,

00:57:16.417 --> 00:57:19.751
you are thinking of others – “Oh, Mother is talking about him” –

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.959
not about yourself.

00:57:32.792 --> 00:57:35.876
That is how one has to take it inside, the absorption

00:57:36.167 --> 00:57:39.792
from your Guru, that you have to see yourself.

00:57:48.292 --> 00:57:51.999
Now, that is very important

00:57:52.209 --> 00:57:58.000
if we have to become the prophets who will make others prophets.

00:58:06.334 --> 00:58:12.751
Now, the higher stage is that your Guru becomes a Deity.

00:58:13.667 --> 00:58:17.709
When you say “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara“.

00:58:17.999 --> 00:58:20.834
They go up to that point but nobody says “Guru is Devi”.

00:58:21.125 --> 00:58:25.709
You can have a higher stage, than Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

00:58:41.375 --> 00:58:46.918
Because the Guru state is where you have the innocence of all these

00:58:47.167 --> 00:58:51.918
Brahma and Mahesha and Vishnu –

00:59:01.667 --> 00:59:03.918
their power of innocence.

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:09.292
But then ultimately they say, “Guru Sakshat Parabrahma”.

00:59:15.834 --> 00:59:18.425
And Parabrahma is the power of the Mother

00:59:18.978 --> 00:59:22.769
Not only by becoming but now,

00:59:23.227 --> 00:59:26.769
becoming the reflector of your Deity,

00:59:35.435 --> 00:59:42.978
to develop yourself into the reflector from guru to that state.

00:59:56.435 --> 01:00:00.936
At that state you start controlling all the elements.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:12.894
That’s why all these incarnations of Adi Guru

01:00:13.227 --> 01:00:16.310
had control over elements.

01:00:21.519 --> 01:00:27.894
Brahmadeva is absolutely manifested through them.

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:37.644
So out of Ganesha, which is the Adi Guru,

01:00:38.477 --> 01:00:41.060
He is born,

01:00:41.352 --> 01:00:46.519
or He is manifested through these three – Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha –

01:00:57.894 --> 01:01:05.561
and then He comes out as Brahmadeva with four heads,

01:01:12.894 --> 01:01:18.978
three of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, and the fourth of Shri Ganesh.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:32.561
So Brahmadeva becomes the symbol of Guru,

01:01:36.519 --> 01:01:42.269
and as you know Ganesha is chatvari, is four –all the time.

01:01:42.561 --> 01:01:46.894
He becomes these four – in expression, in manifestation.

01:01:54.352 --> 01:01:58.310
And as you become Brahmadeva, at that stage

01:01:58.602 --> 01:02:01.477
you control all the elements.

01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:15.227
So, today I have tried to explain to you the different

01:02:15.519 --> 01:02:22.435
stages of gurupada – the state of guru.

01:02:29.435 --> 01:02:36.102
And one should understand whatever we are today,

01:02:37.435 --> 01:02:42.686
we are extremely blessed and fortunate people

01:02:51.352 --> 01:02:56.686
that, in this short time, you started from a scratch

01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:03.185
in the mud and you have become the lotuses.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:15.686
The lotus will invite many insects

01:03:16.435 --> 01:03:20.519
and will convert them into lotuses.

01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:26.477
madhukar they call it, madhukar,

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:30.978
the ones who are selecting the madhu, the nectar,

01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:33.644
the… what do you call? – the honey.

01:03:48.894 --> 01:03:53.644
When they get the nectar, they become themselves the lotuses.

01:04:02.978 --> 01:04:10.686
The whole dirty, filthy pond is covered with those lotus flowers.

01:04:20.019 --> 01:04:23.894
And one lotus, who is the Guru, grows higher,

01:04:27.019 --> 01:04:34.394
and then is given to the Goddess on which She resides.

01:04:42.811 --> 01:04:47.852
She resides in the heart on the platform,

01:04:48.143 --> 01:04:51.352
beautiful platform that this lotus has created.

01:04:56.811 --> 01:05:01.978
But to bear Her on your heart, you have to have a heart.

01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:12.059
There are so many qualities of a Guru, which I have told you.

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:18.519
All the best qualities, the twelve qualities of all the sides

01:05:18.978 --> 01:05:22.435
should be completely manifested in a Guru,

01:05:29.435 --> 01:05:33.394
and the owner of those qualities is Shiva.

01:05:37.435 --> 01:05:40.019
So that is how the essence of Shiva,

01:05:40.227 --> 01:05:43.310
out of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, the Mahesha’s qualities,

01:05:43.561 --> 01:05:45.310
should shine through you.

01:05:55.394 --> 01:05:57.185
The Vishnu’s qualities of Dharma –

01:05:57.394 --> 01:06:01.227
first you have to make an effort to be dharmic, to be balanced.

01:06:09.811 --> 01:06:13.143
Then you ascend.

01:06:15.059 --> 01:06:18.978
Then you become one with the Viraata

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:26.019
and then you can give Dharma to others.

01:06:30.852 --> 01:06:34.352
So one has to know that stage-by-stage it happens to you

01:06:34.602 --> 01:06:37.102
and you do not become a hypocrite.

01:06:44.185 --> 01:06:47.019
But you become real

01:06:49.644 --> 01:06:55.102
and the reality is shown by its own being.

01:06:58.227 --> 01:07:00.769
That is how you become.

01:07:01.686 --> 01:07:06.310
So understand the reality within yourself, face it, solve it.

01:07:06.644 --> 01:07:09.185
But mostly, I have seen, when I tell anybody,

01:07:09.352 --> 01:07:10.769
“No, Mother I am not like that.

01:07:11.019 --> 01:07:14.227
No Mother, I didn’t say like that, that is not true!”

01:07:28.686 --> 01:07:31.310
Some such people would like to sit in front

01:07:31.561 --> 01:07:33.811
or sort of try to show off or anything,

01:07:34.019 --> 01:07:35.059
but that is not important.

01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:37.477
What is important is how much you know yourself,

01:07:37.644 --> 01:07:39.477
it is Self-realisation.

01:07:51.102 --> 01:07:55.602
Once you develop that, then you know the others in the real way

01:07:59.978 --> 01:08:01.727
and not artificially,

01:08:02.811 --> 01:08:06.059
and then the enjoyment is complete.

01:08:08.519 --> 01:08:13.936
Like a bee will never go to an artificial flower.

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:20.852
But human beings have to become the bee.

01:08:25.477 --> 01:08:34.059
The Guru does not need to say that he’s the Guru.

01:08:37.227 --> 01:08:40.852
Today I bless you.

01:08:46.269 --> 01:08:51.059
I have completed the twelve years of Guru’s

01:08:53.102 --> 01:08:57.852
and you should really assume the Shiva’s powers within yourself

01:09:12.978 --> 01:09:20.477
I, that is My body, My mind, My heart,

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:29.019
everything, has spared no efforts

01:09:30.852 --> 01:09:38.143
to completely indulge into this cleansing, into this making,

01:09:38.561 --> 01:09:41.894
into this becoming of you people.

01:09:50.852 --> 01:09:58.769
I request you now that please do not waste My efforts.

01:10:02.978 --> 01:10:06.852
Look at yourself, help yourself

01:10:08.644 --> 01:10:14.644
and try to rise higher and higher to become your Self.

01:10:18.894 --> 01:10:22.686
When you become your Self, then you become the Guru.

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:28.185
And once you become the Guru,

01:10:28.394 --> 01:10:33.060
you become Brahmadeva , Mahesha and Vishnu.

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:45.477
So first you are made in the pattern of Ganesha,

01:10:46.269 --> 01:10:49.602
then Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

01:10:55.019 --> 01:10:59.686
But very much depends on your readiness to do it

01:11:03.769 --> 01:11:10.936
and, most of all, your honesty and sincerity.

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:15.936
I hope Shri Ganesha will give you the wisdom

01:11:19.394 --> 01:11:22.519
to understand.

01:11:23.059 --> 01:11:28.394
The Shakti will give you shakti to work hard,

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:37.435
and Shiva will give you joy, Sadashiva will give you the joy

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:43.102
so that you proceed in your establishment.

01:11:51.602 --> 01:11:55.102
May God bless you.
