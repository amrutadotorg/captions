00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:39.760
Today
we are going

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:53.050
to worship Shri Ganesha.
Shri Ganesha resides in Mooladhara, on the

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:07.460
chakra, Mooladhara chakra. And not on mooladhar.
In the mooladhar is placed the Kundalini.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:20.650
She is the mother of Shri Ganesh, we call
her Gauri. Yesterday you saw the picture,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:41.869
the drama, how Shri Ganesha got his head of
an elephant. All these things have happened

00:01:41.869 --> 00:02:07.909
in another world. There
are many worlds of which we know of this world,

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:24.910
is a question of our awareness. Now we are
at a human awareness, and we have risen to

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:41.959
a higher awareness which is called as the
fourth dimension. Without Shri Ganesha it

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:57.720
is not possible. As you know he is the symbol
of innocence within us. This innocence never

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:13.760
gets destroyed because it is eternal. But
it may happen that it will get covered with

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.870
some clouds by our mistakes that we commit.
But once you get your realization, your innocence

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.519
is re-established, it manifests. And you become
innocent, your attention becomes innocent.

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.519
It is impossible to follow your religion,
either Christ or Mohammed-Sahib or Jews, if

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.670
you do not have enlightenment.This is one
thing they did not realize, because they were

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.500
of a very high level people. They did not
know what is the condition of human beings.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.090
As in the Bible is written that if your right
eye commits sins – means goes against Shri

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.739
Ganesha- you take it away. Or if your right
hand does anything wrong against Shri Ganesha

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.329
, then cut it out. Just imagine, if Christians
were really practising Christianity, they

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:45.079
all would have been without hands, without
eyes. Because it is said that if you make

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:54.160
any mistakes you better cut out, yourself.
Christ said that you should do it, and also

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:02.940
for men he was very strict, not for women
so much. So Mohammed-Saheb thought , that

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.330
why not say about women also? Why not restrict
them, why only men? So he made strict rules

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.630
for women also. In this case he said that
you should hurt the woman or hit the woman

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.709
or should try to restrict the woman, that
is on the husband. But to do so, the husband

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.390
himself has to be an innocent person. If he
himself committed such mistakes, then what

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.500
right he has got to become strict with his
wife or with his sister? And the worst thing

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.340
was, were the Jews, when Moses brought the
Ten Commandments, he found that the Jews were

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.300
having a decadent society as they have now.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.580
Nowadays we have this decadent society in
America, in.. everywhere. There are no morals,

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.810
and nobody talks of morality. I feel that
Sahaj is the only way where human beings can

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.979
become innocent. Because Jews were given what
you call the Sheriat (sp?). Where it was , if

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.230
you are a thief , cut your hands, cut your
nose, cut this portion, cut that portion…

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.650
it’s very serious. I saw that it is impossible
to follow them because they are too pure,

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.650
too important.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.979
If you are Christians, you can’t have two
eyes, you can’t have your hands. And if

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:15.080
you are Muslims, your wives and your daughters
and your sisters are always in danger. And

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.400
if you are a Jew then all kinds of punishments
are written for them. On the contrary , only

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.389
the saints have been punished. All the good
people are punished. Because there are so

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:28.360
many people who are extremely aggressive and
sinful. And they also do not know that there

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.770
is wrong with them , something very much against
the dharma, against the religion.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.710
With Sahaj only , you get the light of the
spirit. Shri Ganesha is the spirit within

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.169
us. And he incarnated on this earth as our
lord Jesus Christ. But all kinds of things

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.669
have been done against such great people.
And they made separate religions. None of

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.530
these books have separated themselves from
each other. For example, Mohammed-Saheb has

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.490
described about Moses, Abraham, Christ, Mother
of Christ. So he never established another

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.990
religion, he was talking about all the religions
woven together in one. But we have now people

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.099
who do not believe that all the religions
are born out of one tree of spirituality.

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:09.990
They are not only fighting with others, but
among themselves. In the name of God they

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.830
are killing so many people.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:19.030
Innocence is the source of love. Like small
children , when you see them sweetly dancing,

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.360
you feel such tremendous love for them. When
you see a little baby, very sweet baby smiling

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.540
at you, you feel tremendous love for that
child. If you do not respect your innocence,

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:38.099
you can never be a loving person. And without
love you cannot know truth. Only thing is

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:43.689
that we feel rather sometimes awkward, sometimes
frightened, to love the innocent people. The

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.319
innocent are most harmless people. I do not
like parents to beat their children at all.

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:54.340
They are in innocence do something, so you
must be really kind to them, and understand

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:03.460
them. Nowadays, in Russia also, there are
many children who are born realized. Because

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.509
you all are now enlightened, and there are
so many great saints who want to be born.

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:15.590
But you have to be innocent yourself. The
countries where the children are not respected,

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:23.960
children don’t want to be born there. There
is a minus growth in those countries. But

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.810
in a country like India, where there is so
much love for children, they want to take

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.669
birth in India though there is poverty. Children
don’t understand money and material things.

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:32.669
They understand love.

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:36.900
If you don’t have love in your heart, Shri
Ganesha cannot shine within you. Now the difference

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.490
between a mother and a mother who is very
angry with her children is this: the mother

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:48.770
who loves her child, enjoys everything she
has to do for her child, while the mother

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:55.440
who doesn’t love the child feels that she
is doing too much, she can’t do it, it’s

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:03.479
too much. If you ask her what’s the matter
, she will say I have to wash this, I have

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:09.430
to clean this, I have to look after this child,
all kinds of stories. But a mother who is

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.680
enlightened will love doing all that, and
enjoy it. She will have respect for her children,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.289
and she will make them respectable. There
is no need to be harsh with your children.

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:28.150
Children are very sensitive and intelligent.
Maybe among thousands you might find one child

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:33.289
who is not so good. But later on , they pick
up things from elders, especially from parents,

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.490
and from the atmosphere, and they start becoming
troublesome.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.950
That doesn’t mean that you should not control
and restrict your children, and train them.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.370
Best way is to be yourself innocent and dharmic.
Ganesha is the basis of morality. Moral behavior,

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.919
when it is lost in a society, that society
becomes destroyed. Whatever maybe the economic

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:47.890
advantages they have, or they have financial
advantages, or political advantages, but,

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:54.190
they get destroyed from within. For example,
take the case of America, which is supposed

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.420
to be an affluent country. Which is doubtful
to me that they are affluent, because they

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.480
are indebted. But what is happening there?
Small children of twelve years are killing

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.570
and selling drugs. In some other countries
in the west, so many children are killed by

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.920
the parents. Every country which is affluent
has some sort of a specialty of immorality.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.740
They are absolutely violent people, arrogant
and egoistical. Innocence, first of all, absolutely

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.829
dissolves the ego. And when you talk to children
they make such sweet comments, such intelligent

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:22.120
comments, that you are amazed how they are
saying all these things. They are extremely

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.120
affectionate, and extremely kind.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.430
I’ll tell you a story of some friends went
to see the grave of president of America,

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:36.230
Kennedy. So the child was looking at it, you
see, and everybody was very solemn. Then the

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:41.959
child turned to his father and mother and
said “Mommy, why should you put this president

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:48.060
under the earth, all the worms will eat him
up.. Why this punishment?” There are so

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.079
many things which you can see from these children
when they talk, how they describe about other

00:09:52.079 --> 00:09:56.149
people. One day we had gone to the airport,
and one child was doing like that, like that.

00:09:56.149 --> 00:10:01.320
So I said, “What are you doing?” He said
, “I am trying to tie up these people, they

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.120
are all off their heads.” Like yesterday’s
swadisthana chakra, they were. So children

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.040
see also the game, and the whole drama is
absurd. They are very innocent and so its

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.490
the easiest thing to give them good manners.
In the case of Shri Ganesha, you have heard

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:20.810
about the story that they had given – the
parents, the father specially- said that the

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:27.649
one who will go around the mother earth, I’ll
give him some present. And Shri Ganesha thought

00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:33.079
that look at this Kartikkeya, he can go faster
because he’s going on this peacock, which

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:41.149
is a bird, which can fly, what about me? I’m
just going on a little rat. But as he is the

00:10:41.149 --> 00:10:47.600
source of all wisdom , in his wise wisdom
he thought, “My mother is greater than this

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.130
mother earth . ” So he went three times
around his mother, and he got the present.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:59.070
A person who is innocent is extremely humble.
He doesn’t try to show off . He doesn’t

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:06.110
know how to show off. For example, Shri Ganesha
has a little rat as his conveyance. But if

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:17.519
you see people who are show offs, they try
to buy cars beyond their means, with big loans,

00:11:17.519 --> 00:11:24.830
just to show off that they are rich. This
is a disease of people who are not innocent.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:31.740
And people take advantage of this very much
in the world. Like in the west, you see, they

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:37.240
have designers. And they put their stamp as
designers. And one has to pay a lot for that.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:47.600
So if it is on the coat written the designer’s
name, they always try to show like that, while

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:57.190
going on the road. But nowadays, they are
putting the sign here, of the designer. Is

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:03.180
a very much in the west, not so much in Russia,
but it will come. And the enrepreneurs take

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.450
full advantage of it.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:09.870
That way I must say Indians are very very
wise. Not all, but most of them. And because

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:15.509
they believe in Shri Ganesha, they would not
waste their money for showing off. So thus

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:21.400
the entrepreneurs take full advantage of the
people who try to show off.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:30.060
Innocent person is not bothered about his
own body. About any fashions or about any

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:37.660
additions to his body, like people wear things
just to show off. I’m just telling you because

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.890
all this nonsense is coming to your country.
I hope you people will understand that the

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.959
greatest quality of beauty of personality
is innocence. When the innocence is lost,

00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:52.889
people play into the hands of these designers
who make funny clothes. They make clothes

00:12:52.889 --> 00:12:58.430
for women which expose their bodies. And the
more it exposes, the more it is expensive.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:06.880
And despite all the cold, they try to wear
clothes which are very scanty. And you can’t

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:14.699
even look at them. But they think no end of
themselves. And all our films in the west

00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:20.269
are so horrible now that you just don’t
want to see. If they make some films out of

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:24.730
children which are innocent, I tell you they
can earn a lot of money.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:33.050
The foundation of dharma is Shri Ganesh. If
you see children, they don’t know how to

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:39.279
tell lies, very difficult. And they say things
sometimes which might be embarassing. Like

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:45.160
one mother was saying in the presence of the
child to her husband that the man who is coming

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:54.580
in the evening, he eats like a hog. So this
boy heard it and when that gentleman came

00:13:54.580 --> 00:14:04.120
and started eating , he was looking at him.
And then he says, “Mother, he doesn’t

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:13.720
eat like a hog, why did you say that he eats
like a hog? You should not tell lies.” And

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:21.310
the mother was so embarassed. So they minimize
also, innocent person by his innocence minimizes

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.350
the judgement of others and criticism of others.
Because they don’t see things which normally

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:32.610
a person who is immoral can see. Or who is
not innocent can see. I remember my own granddaughter

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:38.399
once she saw a lady in a swimming dress. It
was a picture. So she said “Hey, you go

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:42.740
and dress up properly, otherwise my grandma
will be angry with you.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.829
So when you see all these small little children
talking, the way they behave, the way they

00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:50.980
are innocent, you really enjoy because innocence
is the source of love. And it is the source

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.250
of joy. Because if you do not have love , you
cannot enjoy anything. And you start criticising

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.610
and judging and wasting your energy on nonsensical
things. Like the other day I was listening

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:04.550
to some good music, and the gentleman was
singing with his hands, a little bit more

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:11.790
of action. But he had closed his eyes and
music was wonderful. I really got lost into

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:19.029
it. But there were some ladies who said what
clothes he was wearing, how he was putting

00:15:19.029 --> 00:15:25.560
his hands, all these superficial things they
were saying, not the essence. But innocence

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:32.750
takes to the essence. And the essence is love.
Thus we have to understand that the quality

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:37.490
of Ganesha we must all imbibe within ourselves.
His quality of innocence which is already

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:43.190
there within us has to be manifested. Like
I was with one sahaja yogi in his house, and

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:49.060
we had a meeting there of about 25 people.
And the meeting was over, I thought that he

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:55.360
had said that I’ll have my dinner there.
So I just waited for all of them to go away.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:04.269
This gentleman was in the kitchen when they
all went away. He came back and he said, “Mother

00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:09.200
what have you done?Why have they gone? I have
cooked for all of them.” And tears came

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:16.820
into his eyes. I was so much overwhelmed by
his generosity, by his kindness. And when

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:22.750
the generosity is done innocently, you are
not even aware of what you are doing. You

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.329
just enjoy your generosity, and you don’t
bother as to see what is the reaction of another

00:16:25.329 --> 00:16:26.329
person.

00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:35.389
We have in our shastras description of such
people. Like Shri Rama, he went into the forest

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:39.290
and there was a very old lady of, what you
call, a tribal area. Very old, only she had

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.673
two teeth left. Her name was Shabari. And
she came before Shri Ram and offered him some

00:16:41.673 --> 00:16:49.850
plums, you can say, pears. And she very innocently
told him, “See, all these I have tested

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.970
with my teeth and those who are sour I have
thrown away because you don’t like sour

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.610
ones. But they are all sweet.” Normally
in India people don’t eat anything which

00:16:55.610 --> 00:17:00.980
has been touched by another mouth. So Shri
Ram says “Oh , I see, you have done this

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:07.350
work, so please may I have all these?” But
his brother Lakshmana was angry, what is this

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:11.860
lady she has no manners? So when she started
putting this pear into the mouth of Shri Rama

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.100
, he was getting even worse. So she said “See
how carefully I have done this testing and

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.120
you are enjoying , otherwise you would not
have enjoyed them.”

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.850
And here Lakshmana was getting angry, very
angry. So Shri Rama says, “Oh, what wonderful

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.610
fruits, I have never eaten such fruits in
my lifetime.” So his wife Sita she said

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:28.800
“Why don’t you give me some?” He said
“No, no these are for me, I can’t give

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.370
you.” So Sitaji said that “After all,
I am your wife, and you have to share everything

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:41.520
with me.” So he said, “All right, as a
matter of right, I am giving you.” So he

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:50.090
gave those pears, those fruits to her.
So Sita said, “What ? This is just like

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:59.200
ambrosia, such beautiful fruits I have never
eaten!” So she tells her brother in law,

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:04.640
“See, what fruits, these are heavenly fruits!”
So he got tempted. So Lakshmana said, “Give

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:11.610
me some to taste also.” So Sitaji said “No
no no, I am not going to share, after all,

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:21.980
I have got it with great difficulty from your
brother, I am not going to share.” So Shri

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.600
Rama said, “all right, give him some.”
So this innocent old lady says, “No, I have

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:32.110
some more, I can give him. You can have your
share, I have some more, I can give him.”

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:46.010
And she gave it to Lakshmana. He started eating
and he really enjoyed, so much he enjoyed,

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.310
he said “My god, I have never eaten such
beautiful fruits.” Even Shri Krishna, whenever

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:54.900
he used to go to the capital of Hastinapur,
he would not live with the kings there, with

00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:00.310
Duryodana, but with Vidura, who was the son
of a maidservant. Because Vidura was an enlightened

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:05.840
man, and he used to respect Vidura much more
than anybody else.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:14.170
But sometimes a mistake we commit that we
get too much attached to innocent children.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:20.843
Give them too much importance. Innocence is
like a river flowing, but if you try to stagnate

00:19:20.843 --> 00:19:24.520
it then the children get spoiled. They must
be respected, but one should not try to make

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:30.050
them look like something very exceptional.
They are all just the same, they have certain

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:37.590
various facets, but I have seen, children
are just the same. Firstly, they never get

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:43.630
bored. If you are innocent you will never
be bored, you see beauty all the time, and

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:50.970
even if you are alone you enjoy yourself.
It is only the grownups get bored. Now supposing

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:56.310
you are in the airport and its late, and the
plane is late. All the others, all the older

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.240
people will be very upset. But children will
start playing with something that is in the

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.430
airport – anything, a railing is there,
or a steps are there, they will go up and

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.590
down, enjoy themselves. They don’t want
to make a sort of a life miserable by just

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:12.480
bringing everything to some meticulous definition.
I have seen in the airport many a times people

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:23.500
just feeling very bored and terrible and while
the children are running up and down and playing

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.510
and enjoying and making friends with other
children whom they have never met. Only by

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.490
innocence you can transcend your limited ideas.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:41.310
I have seen parents who are extremely racist.
Their children take to other people in no

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:50.230
time. An innocent person is like that. He
just can carry on with any type of person

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:56.190
without even thinking what sort of a color
he has, what sort of face he has, or what

00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:04.270
sort of hair he has done. These things do
not matter. These are superficial. But children

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:14.710
do not bother about superficial things. They
just want to see the heart of the person.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:22.070
If the person is loving, whatever may be the
race, religion, anything, children will jump.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:30.350
I’ve already told you
that innocence dissolves the ego. Innocent

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:37.170
person cannot be aggressive. And if the aggression
is there that is also very loving aggression.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:44.070
Like a child would come and say that ” Why
don’t you give my clothes to this boy?”

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:58.470
And if you say, “Oh God, I paid so much
money and you want to give it to this boy?”

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:12.030
So he’ll say “Alright, next time again
you buy for me, but let me give this to this

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:18.650
boy” innocently. Innocent children do not
have sense of possession. Also they do not

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:25.110
hesitate to share their things if they are
innocent. But if they are brought up in a

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:40.170
way that they show that “This is yours and
this should be kept as yours” all the time

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.630
put into his head that this is yours, then
they start becoming possessive of their things.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:55.430
The best thing to enjoy is to live with children.
And to be like them. And to enjoy them. This

00:22:55.430 --> 00:23:03.240
is how our innocence gets nourishment. In
Sahaja Yoga I have seen, people become really

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.890
very innocent. Shri Ganesha who is on the
backside of your head also, who is MahaGanesha

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:19.090
here, starts acting on the eyes. The lust
and greed from the eyes just drop out, because

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:25.580
you become innocent in your attention. So
you don’t have to take out your eyes as

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:30.890
Christ has said. Nor you have to cut your
hands. Because you really become moral. I

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.510
don’t know how many of you know that all
of you have become saints. As Ganesha was

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.290
created, you are also created as innocent
saints. Try to respect your innocence. That

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:50.300
will make you feel young and happy.
Is a , in India, in Maharastra, we have eight

00:23:50.300 --> 00:24:04.560
swayambu Ganeshas. And I have seen the people
of Maharastra are quite innocent. Somehow,

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:14.730
its a very ancient country, and in that area
specially Shri Ganesha is worshipped, so people

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:22.000
have become very innocent.
They have a Ganesha being established during

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:51.110
certain time, now is the time, for ten days.
Made out of clay and later on is put in the

00:24:51.110 --> 00:25:01.380
water, sea or river. But as this Coca cola
culture has also come to India, in the presence

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:11.670
of Shri Ganesha they were singing horrible
vulgar song and drinking in his presence.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:21.860
These were all public Ganeshas, you see. So
I warned them in two lectures, that don’t

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:29.190
do this, because if Shri Ganesha gets angry,
y u will get earthquakes. They would not believe

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:45.060
me.
So third year these people in a village, quite

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:58.480
a big place, went to the Ganesha resurgion,
means where they put it Ganesha

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:11.860
in the water, and they came back. And they
were all drunk and they were dancing in the

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:20.420
night. And suddenly this great earthquake
came in, and all of them were buried. Except

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:33.910
for Sahaja Yogis, and the Sahaja Yoga Center
which was there was not at all hit by the

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:44.130
earthquake. And there was a big gap round
the Center, so the people ran toward the Center

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:56.970
that they can be saved. But they all fell
in that big gap and died.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:14.230
So on the other side, the innocence is very
powerful. Anybody who tries to molest or to

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:26.250
try to destroy somebody’s innocence is ultimately
very badly punished by Shri Ganesha. Those

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:36.840
people who do not worship Ganesha in their
heart can become right- sided or can become

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:44.430
left-sided. If they become right-sided they
get all kinds of diseases, which are more

00:27:44.430 --> 00:28:52.410
physical. And if they become left sided then
they get diseases which are psycho-somatic.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:29:36.360
Which are incurable. We have had some horrible
people

00:29:36.360 --> 00:30:00.060
in our country who preached that through mooladhara
chakra , through sex, you can raise the kundalini.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:15.710
And they became tantrikas. People who were
tantrikas did all kinds of horrible things

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:41.360
in the temples they put erotics, insult to
Shri Ganesha. They

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.520
are all now being destroyed.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:31:48.580
So one should never try to challenge a person
who is innocent, who has the blessings of

00:31:48.580 --> 00:37:16.319
Shri Ganesha. Only through enlightenment one
can awaken Shri Ganesha within yourself.

00:37:16.319 --> 01:00:12.889
May God Bless You All.
