00:02.722 --> 00:05.047
My dear seekers,

00:07.032 --> 00:10.468
I’m thankful to Gavin Brown

00:11.000 --> 00:15.390
that he has been able to sum up some of the things I’ve said before

00:15.742 --> 00:23.563
and I don’t have to go into all the details of
what I told you last time.

00:25.933 --> 00:29.458
Some of you have come for the first time here. (Tape interrupted).

00:29.822 --> 00:35.268
As he said Tantra is the technique.

00:37.042 --> 00:41.077
It’s a technique and Yantra

00:41.236 --> 00:46.938
in Sanskrit language means the mechanism.

00:47.990 --> 00:51.606
So the technique of the mechanism.

00:51.765 --> 00:55.574
Now what is this mechanism we are talking about?

00:56.153 --> 01:01.028
Is there any mechanism outside or inside us?

01:04.640 --> 01:11.294
Or is it worked through some subtle method?

01:12.463 --> 01:20.804
All these questions should come to our mind
if you are thinking and if you are true.

01:22.947 --> 01:27.340
But I see that in the West

01:28.225 --> 01:31.381
people though are very much developed materially,

01:31.495 --> 01:38.172
they have sorted out very material questions and problems,

01:39.273 --> 01:42.030
they are very well equipped,

01:42.337 --> 01:47.461
but as far as spiritual life is concerned,

01:47.779 --> 01:51.134
they – they are very naive.

01:54.122 --> 02:01.967
Though they have such a great personality
like Christ to follow about a model form

02:03.589 --> 02:06.910
but maybe because of an organized religion

02:07.114 --> 02:11.342
perhaps it was not possible

02:11.490 --> 02:19.845
for people who were seeking truly
to penetrate into it through meditative methods.

02:22.697 --> 02:27.618
So this Tantra or the technique

02:30.022 --> 02:34.409
which works out our Self Realization

02:35.759 --> 02:39.921
is to be known, to be understood fully

02:40.148 --> 02:42.812
and the Yantra that works out

02:42.949 --> 02:48.878
you have already got and thanks go to
Patrick who has made a beautiful sketch of that

02:49.049 --> 02:55.458
Yantra which is within you, is the instrument which is within you.

02:56.309 --> 02:59.494
But when we think of an instrument

02:59.676 --> 03:06.239
with our human mind we cannot think of
an instrument which is a living instrument.

03:06.682 --> 03:10.615
It is beyond our conception to understand a living machine.

03:13.091 --> 03:18.385
This one is a living instrument within you.

03:18.919 --> 03:25.982
When you see a tree sprouting out of a small little seed,

03:26.501 --> 03:30.685
working out its blossoming one has to know

03:30.902 --> 03:38.239
that there must be some technique of some mechanism

03:38.795 --> 03:43.917
that works out this beautiful tree to grow.

03:44.281 --> 03:48.927
And when we evolved from amoeba to this stage

03:49.075 --> 03:54.608
we have to think there must be some mechanism

03:54.778 --> 04:01.469
which thinks, understands, organizes, loves,

04:01.629 --> 04:07.830
which has brought about this human stage from that amoeba stage.

04:09.781 --> 04:18.421
In the ancient India – long time – people had lots of time

04:18.853 --> 04:26.692
they went into themselves, into their
being through meditative understanding.

04:26.998 --> 04:31.216
‘They’ had a glimpse of this mechanism

04:31.454 --> 04:41.411
and they talked about it and wrote about it
and that’s how this Yantra

04:42.228 --> 04:50.555
– the mechanism – and the Tantra – the maneuvering of it,
the technique of it – came into being.

04:50.998 --> 04:55.215
But it was a secret science.

04:55.522 --> 05:04.991
It was a very secret science and
it was kept hidden from general public.

05:06.216 --> 05:11.954
It was used by very few great masters

05:12.056 --> 05:17.192
who lived in the jungle, had one or two disciples,

05:17.340 --> 05:26.142
worked on them for years together
and taught them about the technique of Divine.

05:26.676 --> 05:33.400
They had to leave everything, their family, everyone,

05:34.103 --> 05:42.132
live with the Guru, lead a complete separate life

05:42.643 --> 05:50.373
and go into a complete transformation
under the guidance of their loving Gurus.

05:51.768 --> 05:56.008
This was in ancient times.

05:59.635 --> 06:04.011
And what did they achieve, and what did they have,

06:04.147 --> 06:09.254
is all written in our scriptures.

06:09.351 --> 06:18.453
What do you expect out of Self Realization
is written in the Bible, in the Koran, in the Torah

06:18.737 --> 06:23.963
and also in all the Indian philosophy.

06:30.018 --> 06:36.986
Only people say it that in some of these scriptures

06:37.111 --> 06:43.199
it is written in a very secretive manner,

06:43.289 --> 06:50.059
under some words that,
“I will appear before you as tongues of flames.”

06:50.370 --> 06:55.477
Now nobody knows what’s ‘tongues of flames’ is.

06:56.158 --> 07:01.225
There are so many sentences which
you can find out now that you go and read

07:01.351 --> 07:07.301
which nobody can explain unless and until
they have had an experience of Kundalini.

07:07.642 --> 07:12.959
This is the Yantra – the mechanism, is the Kundalini,

07:13.640 --> 07:21.743
is a living force within you, It exists,
it is there, is placed for your Realization,

07:22.265 --> 07:32.467
for your jumping into another awareness
which is promised to you through various scriptures,

07:33.148 --> 07:36.401
through various incarnations.

07:36.844 --> 07:45.069
It is within you. Nobody told you lies.
There is nothing but truth written in these books

07:46.408 --> 07:57.845
but it was to be guarded. It was to be made into secret
because people would have used it for their purposes.

07:58.276 --> 08:02.561
And they have despite all that.

08:03.219 --> 08:07.312
First, I would like to speak about Self Realization

08:07.437 --> 08:14.917
because that is blissful and then
answer you about the so-called tantrikas.

08:16.418 --> 08:20.341
I have to talk about it though I have told about these things

08:20.466 --> 08:25.266
in the previous lecture because
there are many here that were not here.

08:27.416 --> 08:37.648
I have now shown here all the centers
and all the mechanism that is within us.

08:37.978 --> 08:44.396
We have also given you a picture of that, I have told you
which are the deities sitting on all these different

08:44.816 --> 08:51.607
Chakras as we call the centers which have incarnated on this earth,

08:51.709 --> 08:57.830
have built up our being one by one gradually
in different evolutionary processes

08:57.966 --> 09:02.988
and how we have become human beings,
this I have told you last time.

09:03.193 --> 09:11.311
This is the Yantra and the mechanism
that is this Yantra – Kundalini –

09:11.811 --> 09:20.833
is a holy mechanism. And this mechanism is specially created

09:22.690 --> 09:30.377
within the being of the One Main , of the One means the Macrocosm

09:30.661 --> 09:37.395
and we are the cells – all of us – in that.

09:37.781 --> 09:42.638
We were made aware as fishes of the soil, we became reptiles.

09:42.785 --> 09:54.177
We were made aware of the food available at the heights,
we raised our head. Gradually we became human beings.

09:54.948 --> 10:01.297
After this state we started thinking of God.

10:02.295 --> 10:07.666
We started thinking on something beyond.

10:07.915 --> 10:16.546
Man is the only animal who thinks of God and of searching.

10:16.751 --> 10:23.303
Is the man aware that he has to become something?

10:23.429 --> 10:29.766
Why is he so confused? Why is he under so tension?
What is he searching?

10:35.283 --> 10:42.285
He is searching something of which he has a glimpse

10:42.796 --> 10:51.855
– a glimpse of that Joy he kept with him
and that Joy comes from his Self – Atma – in his heart –

10:52.331 --> 10:55.159
he has not felt.

10:55.273 --> 10:59.163
He has not been able to manifest the power of his Self

10:59.300 --> 11:06.862
but there is a mechanism placed within him,
properly built up inside,

11:08.268 --> 11:13.109
all the time present in all the human beings

11:13.223 --> 11:21.794
just like this as it is placed in the One Being.
In His image it is also placed within you.

11:24.346 --> 11:35.049
As I said last time that you are
all built to be just like computers.

11:36.190 --> 11:40.121
Now the job is to put you to the Main’s.

11:40.439 --> 11:47.032
That’s why you are seeking. That’s the only urge you have in life.

11:47.201 --> 11:57.189
All other urges are actually the side issues.
You think you are searching in money, in position is a myth.

11:57.507 --> 12:04.024
Those who have money are dissatisfied, those
who have positions are dissatisfied, everybody is dissatisfied.

12:04.251 --> 12:14.506
The satisfaction time only comes to you
when you will reach the real thing which you are searching

12:15.198 --> 12:19.767
and the real thing is your Self and nothing else.

12:20.255 --> 12:25.593
All other things are useless because
you are not searching anything else,

12:25.740 --> 12:35.308
you are only searching your Self
and that Self is the reflection of God almighty,

12:40.116 --> 12:41.916
that is within your heart.

12:42.259 --> 12:47.671
Now the mechanism that is placed
within you is this beautiful thing inside

12:47.833 --> 12:52.343
which is placed inside your spinal chord and not outside

12:52.558 --> 12:58.630
except for the last Chakra which is in the red color

12:59.095 --> 13:05.750
that is outside in the prostate [the pelvic plexus].

13:06.102 --> 13:12.315
And this is a very, very important Chakra

13:13.045 --> 13:19.498
which controls the survival within us

13:19.668 --> 13:24.441
– I’m sorry the Pelvic plexus within us.

13:24.929 --> 13:29.725
It is very important because it is very sensitive

13:31.200 --> 13:36.200
and also it is very delicate because
it is placed outside the spinal chord.

13:42.226 --> 13:47.758
This mechanism that is placed outside the spinal chord,

13:49.142 --> 13:52.275
down below there, is the most important Chakra

13:54.717 --> 14:01.358
and was created first. When the creation
started this was the first thing that was created

14:01.500 --> 14:06.740
and what does it emit holiness, innocence.

14:06.938 --> 14:14.676
It emits innocence. And the deity sitting on this,

14:17.000 --> 14:27.493
is the embodiment of innocence.
This deity was created in another dimension

14:29.160 --> 14:34.946
and He is – you have seen there – is Shri Ganesha.

14:35.174 --> 14:38.900
This is the image of Shri Ganesha that was created

14:39.275 --> 14:45.986
at that stage and what does it represent is
the stage between the animal and the man

14:46.214 --> 14:51.736
and the head is that of the animal showing
that an animal does not have any Ego,

14:51.839 --> 14:59.081
that the man is different from an animal,
that the animal is innocent.

14:59.377 --> 15:02.743
He doesn’t know what is sin, that’s why he is innocent.

15:02.880 --> 15:08.650
Because you know what is sin that’s why ‘you’ are

15:09.116 --> 15:13.911
innocent but you can become the fire of damnation.

15:14.540 --> 15:19.007
He is innocence but [only fire He’s seldom?]. (SM slightly laughs.)

15:19.130 --> 15:27.817
And He incarnates too on this earth.
He incarnated as Jesus Christ, Lord Jesus Christ.

15:28.906 --> 15:35.394
He took His form as Lord Jesus Christ and because He is innocent,

15:35.768 --> 15:46.042
He’s made of that essence of divine nature of God

15:46.411 --> 15:51.332
that we call as Paramtattwa, the highest essence of God.

15:51.507 --> 15:54.915
And that’s why His body is also made out of that

15:55.097 --> 16:01.197
and that is the reason He could resurrect.

16:04.576 --> 16:10.889
By reading Bible which was written by disciples of Christ

16:11.128 --> 16:16.967
how far can you go to understand Him?

16:17.829 --> 16:26.442
Because He was created beyond your thoughts, beyond your mind,

16:26.647 --> 16:34.590
in an unlimited Unconscious.

16:34.783 --> 16:43.309
And how can you with your limited mind understand Him or copy Him.

16:43.740 --> 16:49.007
It is said that even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh
cannot reach Him. He is so pure.

16:50.093 --> 16:55.988
He is purity. He is innocence

16:56.148 --> 17:02.638
and He exists at that point

17:02.797 --> 17:10.862
and it is He at every point, every Chakra
He bestows upon you the blessings of His innocence.

17:11.010 --> 17:15.513
Innocence was the first thing created on this Earth.

17:15.831 --> 17:21.228
Before creating anything else it was innocence already there

17:21.477 --> 17:27.570
and He bestows that innocence
by which you get your Self Realization.

17:28.307 --> 17:35.224
On the left hand side of this mechanism

17:35.609 --> 17:38.499
there are seven stratas.

17:38.783 --> 17:42.454
On the right hand side there are seven stratas,

17:42.647 --> 17:48.145
down below there are seven stratas
and on top there are seven stratas.

17:48.486 --> 17:51.553
What are these stratas and what do they build?

17:52.193 --> 17:59.993
The left hand side chakras, the left hand side channel
which is called as Ida channel represents the subconscious,

18:00.231 --> 18:09.875
the subconscious mind within you. You listen to Me through
your conscious mind and put it back into the subconscious mind.

18:10.012 --> 18:13.228
All your experiences go into the subconscious.

18:13.376 --> 18:17.888
That is the limit of your subconscious of present here.

18:18.036 --> 18:25.609
Beyond that gouge is your subconscious of previous lives

18:25.712 --> 18:33.409
and beyond that gouge is the collective subconscious.

18:34.838 --> 18:48.101
When you listen to Me you have got a conscious mind which
receives it at this moment and there is a pre-conscious mind

18:48.294 --> 18:56.513
which takes it to the subconscious.
This pre-conscious mind is on the right hand side.

18:57.758 --> 19:01.923
This also has got seven stratas on this side.

19:02.151 --> 19:07.978
Just now the pre-conscious mind is the future

19:08.330 --> 19:12.147
that you are thinking about.

19:12.272 --> 19:21.501
Beyond that is the supra-conscious mind means
all the ideas about future you have had before,

19:21.819 --> 19:31.273
many lives before. Those ideas are there.
And beyond that is the collective supra-conscious.

19:31.851 --> 19:36.307
So, on the left hand side you have sub-conscious

19:36.811 --> 19:45.178
and the collective sub-conscious; on the right hand side:
supra-conscious and the collective supra-conscious.

19:45.496 --> 19:54.019
Down below are the seven stratas of Hell. H.E.L.L.

19:54.178 --> 19:58.363
Sometimes the words are so small that it doesn’t register.

19:58.466 --> 20:04.712
If I say ‘Supra-conscious’, then people say,
“Ah! Mataji has said ‘sub-conscious’.” But ‘Hell’!

20:04.837 --> 20:12.569
And Hell is a truth. It exists within us.

20:14.201 --> 20:21.661
It is there. And there are seven stratas of that also.

20:23.963 --> 20:29.486
Conscious mind [on Sushumna Nadhi-Central Channel]
also has got seven stratas

20:29.623 --> 20:36.266
which are built in within us through
our different evolutionary processes.

20:36.452 --> 20:41.926
And these are the seven stratas
which are placed here of the conscious mind

20:42.063 --> 20:47.775
and then you go on top of the head into super-conscious mind

20:48.229 --> 20:59.419
which is the subtle mind – is the eternal mind –
the unconscious in which you have to move in seven stratas.

21:00.553 --> 21:06.486
You may say, “Shri Mataji it’s too much!” But it’s not.

21:07.526 --> 21:10.054
You are already built-in for that.

21:10.333 --> 21:14.576
For example if I tell this light, “You have to get enlightened

21:14.701 --> 21:20.284
and cover the whole hall”, it will say, “Oh! It’s too much.” No,
it is built like that.

21:20.443 --> 21:23.980
You have to just press the button. It opens and works

21:24.082 --> 21:31.440
because it is built that way, has been organized that way,
is placed that way that it works.

21:33.878 --> 21:38.230
When we face things that seem difficult we think we have to do it

21:38.378 --> 21:43.466
and that’s why we are worried. You don’t have to worry:
it’s already done

21:43.693 --> 21:51.933
and it will be done also by the One who is organizing it.

21:52.149 --> 21:55.844
Only thing what we have to do is to witness.

21:56.128 --> 22:01.185
The One who has created this universe very well,

22:01.911 --> 22:07.748
the One who has created all the greenery

22:07.884 --> 22:14.902
then human being very well,

22:15.671 --> 22:18.833
He is the One who is going to do this for you

22:18.937 --> 22:26.070
and the time has come as Gavin has said it beautifully
that the blossom time has come and it will work out.

22:27.546 --> 22:31.855
But it’s surprising you know, human beings sometimes
I cannot understand.

22:31.969 --> 22:37.915
When I told that it is going to work out they said,
“How can it be? It has to be difficult.”

22:39.809 --> 22:48.571
Before even starting about it must you sit down with this idea
on your head : “Oh! It’s going to be very difficult.”

22:48.775 --> 22:56.621
I say it is the easiest and the simplest thing.
Being so important it cannot be difficult.

22:56.836 --> 23:01.802
Anything important like your breathing if it becomes
difficult and if you have to read about breathing,

23:01.881 --> 23:07.226
“How am I to breathe?” Now you go in books and see,
“Now, you have to do like this.”

23:07.317 --> 23:12.446
By the time you take the book, you are out.

23:12.764 --> 23:16.461
If you have to read about your Self Realization

23:16.586 --> 23:20.905
then God saves the Self Realization and God saves you.

23:21.076 --> 23:24.783
It’s your right that you are going to get your Self Realization.

23:24.885 --> 23:29.625
I’m not pampering your Ego. But that’s how you have been made.

23:29.999 --> 23:38.461
Even your Ego which you are condemning every morning
and evening was an essential part of this being.

23:38.949 --> 23:47.497
Only ‘you’ the human beings have evolved
the Ego to know something on their own.

23:49.389 --> 23:56.710
So this mechanism was made specially in such a manner

23:56.870 --> 24:05.463
that through your Ego and your Super Ego
you have become an ‘I’ personality.

24:05.815 --> 24:10.859
Like people say, “This is Mister Kumar. This is X, this is Y.”

24:11.744 --> 24:19.192
You become a separate identity from that big One personality

24:19.533 --> 24:24.974
of which you are just separate.
And the consciousness of that comes to you

24:25.224 --> 24:31.977
that you are a separate identity
and you have to see the oneness with that.

24:32.896 --> 24:35.429
And that is what is Self Realization.

24:37.340 --> 24:40.208
Nothing else!

24:41.129 --> 24:48.080
That you become that. Not what you do but is the becoming of it.

24:48.466 --> 24:51.787
Like you say a seed becomes a flower.

24:52.128 --> 24:58.861
It becomes a flower. You don’t – the seed doesn’t go
and read a book, “Oh! I know what it is.”

24:59.191 --> 25:02.347
Or it doesn’t listen to any lecture of Mataji or anything,

25:02.461 --> 25:07.993
it just becomes a flower. In the same way you have to become that

25:08.198 --> 25:15.604
and not just to be brain washed or to be done something else
which I will tell you later how per misuse you can do

25:15.707 --> 25:19.538
in the name of Self Realization.

25:19.697 --> 25:24.980
So many of them are aware, it happened so. They know that.

25:25.287 --> 25:27.037
But what happens you can know.

25:27.162 --> 25:33.398
What is the mechanism? How it works out? Let us see the
positive side of it and then I will tell you the negative side.

25:33.568 --> 25:40.246
There is a Kundalini placed in that triangular
bone that you can see

25:40.618 --> 25:45.480
pulsate. We have a doctor here he will say that, yes,

25:46.240 --> 25:50.448
he has seen it. You can see the pulsation of
the Kundalini very clearly.

25:50.596 --> 25:55.596
You can see the rising of the Kundalini
very clearly with your naked eyes.

25:56.129 --> 26:00.888
You can also feel it coming up. It comes. How it comes?

26:01.092 --> 26:08.734
How it works out is another detailed program
which I may be able to tell you later on

26:08.995 --> 26:11.928
or I have already told quite a lot about it.

26:13.564 --> 26:16.908
This comes up – the Kundalini –

26:17.078 --> 26:23.779
and pierces your fontanel bone. Pierces! What is this Kundalini?

26:23.961 --> 26:34.182
It is a residual force within you. Is awareness
which understands, thinks, loves and organizes, is an energy.

26:34.375 --> 26:41.416
Now we cannot think, human beings cannot think of
an energy that can think, love, organize.

26:41.575 --> 26:47.058
We cannot.
This is the energy that comes up you can see the pulsation.

26:47.331 --> 26:51.462
You can see the bringing of it with your naked eye.
That’s what you can bring here.

26:51.576 --> 26:57.390
It comes up and pierces your fontanel bone

26:58.410 --> 27:03.098
and you can feel the baptism that you become like a child

27:03.223 --> 27:08.959
because your fontanel bone becomes very soft.

27:09.209 --> 27:17.476
I mean, but that doesn’t mean that if you have a soft bone
here – that doesn’t mean that you are a Self realized person. No.

27:17.881 --> 27:21.856
When you enter not on left side or right hand side

27:21.967 --> 27:26.818
but when you enter onto the top,
onto the first strata of the super-consciousness,

27:28.598 --> 27:37.259
then what happens? First thing that should happen
to you is that you become one with the collective being.

27:40.412 --> 27:46.971
“You become”, again I say. It is not lecturing,
“We are all brothers and sisters.

27:47.357 --> 27:56.756
There should be no racism.” All this is lecturing.
I’m not saying lecturing. It’s ‘become’. How?

27:57.618 --> 28:05.799
When this thing enters through this into that subtle form

28:06.276 --> 28:12.810
you start feeling from your hands a cool breeze flowing.

28:13.048 --> 28:15.931
This is described in our scriptures.

28:16.143 --> 28:24.132
If you read even Christ has said, “Something passed out of My
body when somebody touched Me.” [Luke 8.46 transcriber’s note]

28:24.397 --> 28:31.251
But in our scriptures it’s given very, very clearly.
Here, in some of them, for example I would say Shankara .

28:31.490 --> 28:35.023
– Shankaracharya described that as Saundarya Lahari.

28:37.310 --> 28:41.408
He called it as Saundarya Lahari this force somewhere.

28:41.647 --> 28:48.128
He called as vibrations. So many people are talking
of vibrations but they don’t know what they’re talking

28:48.340 --> 28:54.530
These vibrations that flow from your hand are cool vibrations

28:54.980 --> 29:01.144
and also they understand, they think and heal other people.

29:01.409 --> 29:08.789
When you put your hand towards another person
you start suddenly getting a burning here.

29:09.054 --> 29:15.704
Left hand side burning on this finger is
the Vishuddhi chakra, is this one.

29:16.736 --> 29:20.095
Now, if you know the deity who is there

29:20.252 --> 29:24.143
and if you take the name of
that particular deity who is sitting here …

29:24.249 --> 29:28.323
If you know and if you are a Realized soul then only.

29:28.456 --> 29:32.529
If you are not Realized you have no authority.

29:32.874 --> 29:41.445
You have no authority to take to any mantra
unless and until you are a Realized soul.

29:43.323 --> 29:46.438
Supposing I give you some mantra.

29:46.934 --> 29:51.656
You must know it is a misleading

29:53.641 --> 29:58.873
because whatever is said, whatever is the center in danger

29:59.052 --> 30:00.986
or in trouble,

30:01.185 --> 30:03.090
you must get that one.

30:03.189 --> 30:09.456
The one who is not a Realized soul cannot
make out what is the problem, where is the problem.

30:09.796 --> 30:12.554
And the one who is not Realized

30:12.654 --> 30:17.375
if he is given the mantra, his mantra has no authority.

30:17.539 --> 30:21.086
Like if I want to go and see the Queen

30:21.582 --> 30:25.113
I must take a permission. I must have some connection with her.

30:25.206 --> 30:30.867
I should be able to go and meet her. But if I go and meet
her straight and say, “Oh! Queen, come along.”

30:31.097 --> 30:34.791
The way we call God sometimes is most surprising.
You wouldn’t even call

30:34.833 --> 30:39.057
any servant like that the way we call Him,
“God, come along! Do this.

30:39.157 --> 30:43.536
This is my problem. What are you doing for me?”

30:45.084 --> 30:50.857
“I have faith in God” as if we have sort of
we are getting obligations.

30:51.017 --> 30:56.800
As if He is obliged to us,
“Oh! I have faith in God, Mother, then why did He miss it?”

30:56.999 --> 31:01.899
Who has faith? I mean, He exists.

31:02.058 --> 31:09.796
He’s an eternal being. If you have faith in that,
‘you’ are very false fine, not ‘He’. You cannot add to His Dom

31:10.015 --> 31:15.360
Any mantra is given to you just by any Dick, Tom and Harry.

31:15.667 --> 31:20.082
Anyone coming, “I’ll give you a mantra.”
I’m going to tell you about them later on.

31:20.222 --> 31:24.921
All those mantras that are said are for the deities,

31:25.060 --> 31:30.194
were done by these Gurus as I told you
in ancient times for very few people.

31:30.333 --> 31:35.162
They used to raise the Kundalini very gradually.

31:35.222 --> 31:40.062
They used to take it from that seat which is the Mooladhara
– not the Mooladhara chakra

31:40.122 --> 31:44.456
– from that triangular bone and they used to raise it one by one.

31:44.547 --> 31:47.827
For seven years it used to hang into one center

31:47.927 --> 31:51.001
then they would give one mantra, “All right, now, go and get it!

31:51.300 --> 31:54.970
Work it out! Cleanse it! Do it!” Then again another one.

31:55.367 --> 32:02.569
Then again another chakra. All right.
It has been done like that: very slow process.

32:02.833 --> 32:05.168
As in India, you see,

32:05.333 --> 32:10.664
they said that they have to go to Kashi or Benares.

32:10.863 --> 32:13.831
They used to sell out their houses, everything

32:14.089 --> 32:17.085
and they knew that they may never return.

32:17.165 --> 32:22.779
Or even if they go they might take so many years to reach Benares

32:22.859 --> 32:27.898
that by that time they will be absolutely old people
and they would not have energy to return.

32:28.216 --> 32:35.855
Now, if you have to go to Benares only thing what you can
do is to go from here to Delhi and take a plane and go direct.

32:36.113 --> 32:44.200
So ‘that’ time is over and Kundalini ‘now’

32:45.311 --> 32:47.890
can be worked out just like that

32:47.950 --> 32:51.501
because the time has come for you to become.

32:52.573 --> 32:57.107
There were never so many seekers in the world before
I can tell you.

32:58.288 --> 33:02.791
Only people who existed in the name of religion

33:02.891 --> 33:10.426
were orthodox, rabid, horrible people who crucified Christ,

33:11.022 --> 33:19.652
who killed Mohammad Sahib, who tortured Gnyaneshwara, who tortured

33:19.732 --> 33:24.811
Kabira, who tortured of all the things Shankaracharya,

33:25.665 --> 33:28.731
Buddha, Mahavira, Yuri [?], everyone of them.

33:28.879 --> 33:33.105
All these horrid people in the name of religion tortured.

33:33.244 --> 33:40.085
And today we have got this satanic thing

33:40.383 --> 33:44.351
coming out of that hell. They have suffered there,
you see, they were punished

33:44.411 --> 33:48.815
and after their punishment they are coming out.
It’s a double force.

33:49.192 --> 33:54.668
It’s a new subtler method of befooling you people.

33:55.661 --> 33:59.388
In Self Realization you get complete tranquility,

33:59.634 --> 34:07.907
the collective consciousness
and you can maneuver this power yourself.

34:08.007 --> 34:13.284
It is ‘your’ power that is manifested and nobody else.

34:14.793 --> 34:21.176
But as you have been to all these satanic people
– most of you have been, last time I saw it

34:21.752 --> 34:27.327
– and when I told them [that I tried?],
means I’m working very hard, you know it. I’m working very hard

34:27.367 --> 34:32.863
but some of them have really spoiled their path of Sushumna,
the central path.

34:33.518 --> 34:40.384
So that is they have spoiled it that unless and until
they give up all that it’s not going to work out.

34:41.434 --> 34:45.659
If you are truly seeking I’m there to work for you.

34:46.056 --> 34:49.131
You don’t have to pay any money for it. No,

34:49.231 --> 34:58.079
never think of that because this is divine
and divine cannot be sold in the market.

35:00.143 --> 35:04.270
First thing that should come into your head as Christians specially

35:04.369 --> 35:08.817
that Christ has taken a hunter in his hand and hand it,
beating those people.

35:08.917 --> 35:14.333
That’s the only time He really lost his temper
on them when they were selling the religion.

35:14.413 --> 35:23.202
And today all of them are selling it
and you very, very humbly go and bow.

35:25.326 --> 35:31.935
All kinds of these beggars and parasites have come in
this country and all over the western countries.

35:32.369 --> 35:35.367
They are nothing but beggars take it from me.

35:36.539 --> 35:41.898
Worse than beggars they are the worst culprits.

35:42.136 --> 35:44.398
So, this is what Self Realization is

35:44.517 --> 35:48.922
and in Self Realization you get all the blessings of God,

35:49.021 --> 35:52.056
gradually you go into thoughtless awareness

35:52.167 --> 35:55.549
and then into doubtless awareness which we call Nirvikalpa

35:55.667 --> 35:58.755
and then into Self Realization completely.

35:58.842 --> 36:01.831
In that we have some people in India

36:02.000 --> 36:05.462
– they have met them – who are completely Self Realized

36:05.667 --> 36:09.549
and who, sitting down there, can work out
the Kundalini of other people.

36:09.669 --> 36:11.791
They are living in the family.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.574
They have got their children.

36:13.637 --> 36:16.709
They have got their grand-children. And they are working it out.

36:16.849 --> 36:18.993
You don’t have to run away from it.

36:19.073 --> 36:25.363
No extremes are needed, nothing.
It is ‘within you’ and ‘within you’ it is going to work out.

36:25.482 --> 36:31.196
These outside things and these extreme things are not needed.
Just be normal people.

36:31.236 --> 36:35.479
God has created this world for you to enjoy.

36:35.599 --> 36:40.797
It is for your enjoyment, you see,
these blessings that you have to feel through Self Realization.

36:40.881 --> 36:44.804
When the light of the Self flows in you see the joy pouring.

36:44.884 --> 36:49.551
You see it pouring from your head downwards
and you are just drenched.

36:49.884 --> 36:51.475
All your tensions go.

36:51.559 --> 36:53.102
All your problems go away.

36:53.167 --> 36:57.765
The Ego and Superego which he has shown here
as the black and the yellow,

36:57.825 --> 37:00.443
both of them open up

37:01.238 --> 37:04.620
and you see they’re going down.

37:06.009 --> 37:14.372
It happens. There is an imbalance, there is a
– some sort of a – hurt in you.

37:14.670 --> 37:19.848
Sometimes I can say there could a very great wound into you,

37:19.988 --> 37:26.177
could be there are some spies sitting in you,
could be that you are possessed

37:26.333 --> 37:30.287
without knowing that you are possessed.

37:31.399 --> 37:34.950
You don’t know how these people have maneuvered

37:35.089 --> 37:37.311
and I hope I will be able to tell you now

37:37.391 --> 37:40.922
how they have maneuvered and what sort of horrid people they are.

37:41.020 --> 37:44.236
I should take off my shoes perhaps.

37:51.300 --> 37:55.701
So, about these horrid people now.

37:58.558 --> 38:03.963
In India since long,

38:04.737 --> 38:07.737
if you say the origin of so-called tantrism

38:07.832 --> 38:12.916
which is just the position of real tantra

38:13.095 --> 38:17.718
which is Sahaja Yoga, of the genuine tantra.

38:17.798 --> 38:27.534
If tantrism is to be considered
as a genuine stuff then it is Sahaja Yoga.

38:27.733 --> 38:30.528
But these tantrisms – these so-called

38:30.667 --> 38:34.595
– came into being in our country since long.

38:34.854 --> 38:42.809
Ancient times when these Gurus were
having those few disciples with them,

38:43.127 --> 38:46.850
three, four disciples were taken with great difficulties.

38:47.067 --> 38:49.627
But they were, after all, human beings.

38:49.750 --> 38:55.832
They used to be competition with them
and Guru would accept only one out of them

38:56.428 --> 39:00.654
or two out of them, would take them a little ahead

39:00.813 --> 39:03.451
and would then leave them out saying that, “No.

39:03.670 --> 39:08.670
We cannot treat you anymore.
You cannot be helped. You’d better go away.”

39:09.325 --> 39:15.852
Such a useless, half-baked person would come down to the public

39:16.210 --> 39:22.151
and would start a method by which ‘he’ would put up a show against
[these fools?].

39:22.287 --> 39:29.750
This is the beginning I would say.
So he would now sit down and meditate.

39:30.564 --> 39:35.325
Still, you know, as a Mother, I don’t want to condemn all of them.

39:35.643 --> 39:37.957
I will give them a benefit of doubt

39:38.044 --> 39:46.985
and the benefit of doubt is this that when they were concentrating

39:47.104 --> 39:54.941
they tried to lift you into their Mooladhara chakra

39:55.299 --> 40:00.601
which you cannot enter in, which is below the Kundalini.

40:00.898 --> 40:04.579
This Mooladhara chakra controls the sex.

40:04.738 --> 40:07.495
Why? Because it is innocent.

40:07.774 --> 40:13.091
It’s a child and the child as he doesn’t have

40:13.230 --> 40:24.232
sex that’s why it is not contaminated by it.
It is like a lotus coming out of the mud of sex.

40:24.927 --> 40:29.271
In that lotus sits Shri Ganesha.

40:29.490 --> 40:34.170
These people tried to peep into that

40:34.329 --> 40:37.900
thinking that through sex you might be able to see things

40:37.980 --> 40:43.614
and they might have seen – it is My own way of putting it

40:43.833 --> 40:49.447
– not seen completely but the trunk as you see.

40:49.666 --> 40:57.827
And they might have confused it
– still I say – that trunk to be the Kundalini.

40:58.323 --> 41:01.577
When I tried to understand human beings

41:01.815 --> 41:09.533
I thought it may have been because how could man be
just entering into hell directly with all that sex.

41:09.712 --> 41:17.549
It’s too much to Me. So by mistake maybe, that they saw this.
All right?

41:17.907 --> 41:21.554
So first the tantrikas came in.

41:22.249 --> 41:24.367
Tantrikas were the first.

41:24.500 --> 41:29.228
Then we have tantrikas
– basically I’m telling you- these evil geniuses are.

41:29.308 --> 41:33.276
In the fact, you see, you cannot divide them

41:33.494 --> 41:40.022
into all geniuses but you can give
a basic broad outline about these tantrikas.

41:40.181 --> 41:43.990
Tantrikas are the people who use sex

41:44.149 --> 41:47.363
for so-called Self Realization.

41:47.443 --> 41:53.494
Mantrikas are the people
who use mantras for so-called Self Realization.

41:53.891 --> 42:00.855
Then there are [Jakanikas?] who use evil geniuses

42:00.975 --> 42:05.835
to be introduced as evil spirits into human beings

42:06.114 --> 42:13.891
– called as [Janganikas?].
Then Paishachikas are the people who used

42:14.427 --> 42:22.505
supraconscious devils into human beings.
They are over dynamic, overambitious sort of people.

42:22.883 --> 42:27.942
We have got Aghoris who taught them to put uh,

42:28.022 --> 42:33.716
say they can put a uh put a diamond into their hands.

42:33.835 --> 42:42.565
Aghoris. Then we have got [Behunt?]
[Behunt?] are the people who can

42:42.823 --> 42:46.750
do horrible uh, horrible gestures,

42:46.889 --> 42:50.798
you see, they can pull their stomach in, push it here,

42:50.937 --> 42:57.345
push it there, all sorts of things they do.
And we have also [Sexoyo?]. Minimum.

42:57.425 --> 43:00.314
I have categorized them as that

43:00.453 --> 43:07.278
but I don’t know how many sides of things there are
because when it comes to evil

43:07.457 --> 43:12.804
they come and prosper like viruses.

43:12.914 --> 43:18.062
Viruses they are. And they know how to hit you off.

43:18.301 --> 43:22.824
They themselves are destroying, they cannot see you constructing.

43:23.000 --> 43:33.037
They cannot see you evolve. That is one of
the basic reasons where they are out and oldies.

43:33.196 --> 43:38.216
So these tantrikas were started their jobs.

43:38.851 --> 43:48.590
In the Rama’s time, say about twelve hundred years back

43:48.829 --> 43:54.384
there was a Yajna, a kind of a ceremony known as Ashvamedha.

43:54.484 --> 44:01.276
It’s written in the books about that. Even that
– the books – the scriptures they ruined

44:01.356 --> 44:07.624
by saying that Ashvamedha was nothing else but was a sex act.

44:08.181 --> 44:11.949
The Shakti and Shiva,

44:12.228 --> 44:14.806
which is God who is innocent

44:14.886 --> 44:27.922
and His power the Shakti like light and the lamp or the sun
There also they introduced the symbol of sex.

44:28.835 --> 44:35.180
This happened in the sixth century.

44:35.617 --> 44:41.887
It was at its heights tantrism in our country,
a complete bend. was taken.

44:42.106 --> 44:47.026
Say Satjakuna [?] It was to Khajuraho.

44:47.582 --> 44:51.589
So much so they were influence people

44:51.833 --> 44:58.767
that all other scriptures were thrown into the rivers
and tantrism became the scripture of the Hindus.

44:59.351 --> 45:04.747
Thank God, by organized religion at least
you would not allow people to tamper too much with Bible.

45:04.906 --> 45:09.747
Thought it was but not so much. It could have been.

45:09.867 --> 45:19.609
There is so much freedom, that licentiousness to do whatever
you please with that scripture.

45:19.768 --> 45:24.648
To get … Can you imagine? From this scripture they started spoiling

45:24.768 --> 45:29.384
in the sixth century. Now what was the historical background for

45:29.444 --> 45:31.666
that? That was the best time,

45:31.785 --> 45:35.951
best breeding time of these horrible people.

45:36.051 --> 45:44.265
Because at that time, as you too have
very extreme type of orthodox people,

45:44.563 --> 45:49.327
Jainism, now we have a sect of people called as Jainism.

45:49.743 --> 45:53.393
Now, horrid. I mean, all of them are.

45:53.477 --> 45:58.355
But one of them
– horrid things I can tell you – that they believe in vegetarianism

45:58.732 --> 46:03.568
to such an extent! It’s horrid thing to tell you

46:03.648 --> 46:08.925
because – I’ve already told Gavin that for the first time
I’ll be shameless to tell you people –

46:09.045 --> 46:18.211
that they do not want to destroy
even the insects that are in the filth.

46:18.549 --> 46:22.930
To them an insect …
(tape interrupted)

46:23.625 --> 46:30.192
(…) so that lots of bugs can bite him

46:30.292 --> 46:34.458
and take out his blood and they pay him lot of money.

46:34.716 --> 46:37.950
Is a fact. Even today they do sometimes in the villages.

46:38.089 --> 46:44.217
They think it’s the greatest punya, is the greatest.
What you say ‘Tapoyajna’, means?

46:44.376 --> 46:49.577
Punya is a good deed, you see, religious deed, Is to make a man

46:49.915 --> 46:59.855
get inside a hut and bugs must come and they take the blood.

47:00.530 --> 47:05.760
So these Jains – so-called vegetarians, horrid –

47:05.879 --> 47:11.279
they were the ministers you know.
Some way or other they became ministers. So.

47:11.475 --> 47:19.073
And the maharajas – you know the word ‘raja’ is for the King –
were the Hindus.

47:19.252 --> 47:22.988
And Hindus as usual are very indifferent to religion.

47:23.108 --> 47:27.214
Whatever one may say about it,
I agree it is a very great country and all that

47:27.274 --> 47:32.651
but Hindus these days are even worse because now,
they have all become English, you see.

47:32.731 --> 47:36.936
With English education all of them have become English.
Westernized.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.267
They don’t think we have anything in our country.

47:41.143 --> 47:46.359
So these – that time – great Rajas

47:46.677 --> 47:54.116
who are so indifferent to religion, to their sustaining power,
to understand what is in their scriptures, licentious

47:54.355 --> 48:00.438
and permissive like your Roman kings, horribly Rajas,

48:00.875 --> 48:09.168
once they used to put their money to some sort of
an arrangement for all the licentious people around,

48:09.903 --> 48:18.156
so they thought of a very genius method, you see:
build the temple of God

48:18.871 --> 48:25.803
and make all kinds of erotic pictures in the temple.

48:26.089 --> 48:32.232
Can you believe that thing? In the name of art.

48:32.332 --> 48:39.216
If art is pure as people say, why do you need this vulgarity?

48:40.983 --> 48:46.397
Horrible erotic things were created through big competitions.

48:46.617 --> 48:49.512
Now you are having competitions in this country but that time

48:49.592 --> 48:53.500
– of course now you are also becoming tantrikas
as far as erotic things are concerned

48:53.600 --> 48:55.497
– one better than the other.

48:55.636 --> 48:59.584
And they were given special prices, even jagirs
– as they call the lands –

48:59.667 --> 49:03.600
were given to those people – it’s written in the history –

49:03.672 --> 49:09.272
for creating those pictures. Despite that, you see,
despite all that provocations

49:09.500 --> 49:12.739
and despite all that temptations,

49:12.853 --> 49:17.374
you’ll be amazed, the konaraka, that art is departed.

49:17.533 --> 49:22.394
There has been another thing, a simple thing is,
“Not. We’re ‘not’ going to do it.

49:22.454 --> 49:24.750
On a temple we are ‘not’ doing it.”

49:24.849 --> 49:29.889
So these clever intelligent people, you see, they told them that,

49:30.008 --> 49:35.028
“If you do this, it will be good because all the dirt
that is here should be placed there”,

49:35.108 --> 49:38.222
you see, “and inside should be clean.

49:38.342 --> 49:41.238
Outside we must accept to God that we are like this.”

49:41.377 --> 49:44.980
This is a concession. See the brain,

49:46.230 --> 49:52.630
“This is a concession you must make what all dirty things
you are doing you put them out there.”

49:55.476 --> 49:59.583
This was the – this was the historical side here.

49:59.861 --> 50:04.928
And that time these tantrikas were,
you see, absolutely horrid they came.

50:05.536 --> 50:11.155
You have only one Soho. We have Sohos
and Sohos and Sohos in that great country.

50:11.473 --> 50:15.750
You won’t believe when you see those things, you know,

50:15.929 --> 50:19.461
foreigners are surprised that in India
such erotic things are there.

50:19.560 --> 50:28.092
Wherever there is religion, wherever there is a saint,
these satanic have to reach there to destroy all that is pure.

50:28.271 --> 50:33.337
That is their style, their “happiness”.
This is a crucifixion of the purity.

50:34.918 --> 50:38.214
And such temples were created

50:39.206 --> 50:43.055
and those tantrikas then came forward.

50:43.155 --> 50:52.303
They brought about all their women there for konaraka. If
you go there is the Chausath Bhavani Mandir, they call it

50:52.344 --> 50:56.077
“the sixty-four goddesses”. Imagine Goddesses’ temple!

50:56.252 --> 51:00.538
Now what do they do? Now what is the principle behind all that,

51:00.667 --> 51:04.867
you must know. It is a very secretive principle that they use.

51:05.657 --> 51:12.704
They establish the picture of a Goddess
or create a statue of a Goddess in a chapel

51:12.803 --> 51:19.212
and before the Goddess they do nirvicara,
means sex act of sixteen varieties of different types.

51:19.272 --> 51:24.192
Horrible! In the beginning Shri Ganesha gets angry.

51:24.311 --> 51:30.085
They get all kinds of blisters all around. They – they say
that Kundalini is angry. Kundalini, why will She be angry?

51:30.169 --> 51:37.233
It is Shri Ganesha who is angry, but in such a temper
from the right and the left and they get all blisters.

51:37.411 --> 51:41.449
They start dancing, jumping, they behave like frogs,

51:41.528 --> 51:48.056
they have horrid things. They get blasted in the head,

51:48.167 --> 51:52.371
they get headaches, everything they get.
But still they are adamant

51:52.451 --> 51:57.014
because it is said that, “You have to go further.
It’s a terrible task,

51:57.114 --> 52:01.340
it’s a difficult task. These are your
Karmas that are coming to torture you.

52:01.420 --> 52:07.420
You have to take out your Karmas.
Through your sex you do better Karmas or bad Karmas.”

52:07.551 --> 52:10.367
So they go on poor people.

52:11.122 --> 52:17.466
Then, by that, beyond that what happens is deities slip off.

52:17.546 --> 52:22.843
They go away from there. The area is built-in.

52:22.942 --> 52:29.311
The realm of God from there disappears
as light disappears in the darkness.

52:29.510 --> 52:32.724
They work in the night. They’ll never work in the daytime.

52:32.833 --> 52:37.287
In the night they work and then they call the spirits.

52:37.605 --> 52:43.092
You can call them. Last time I told you what happens to
you when you die and how the spirits are there

52:43.151 --> 52:47.020
and what are the horrible spirits
that are hanging around us to enter into you.

52:47.100 --> 52:51.286
So I will not go into the details of that but later on
I’ll tell you all about it.

52:51.372 --> 52:55.135
I’ll tell you each and everything. You note it down.

52:55.374 --> 52:58.131
So they start, they call the spirits.

52:58.291 --> 53:07.172
When they call the spirits – spirits have the lust in them,
greed, they’re greedy, you see, really dissatisfied –

53:07.272 --> 53:11.738
and they maneuver them. They can give them the name of say ‘Rama’,

53:12.133 --> 53:16.934
then ‘Aim’, ‘Hrim’, ‘Klim’, all sorts of names
they can give to these spirits,

53:17.014 --> 53:20.327
these evil geniuses manage them.

53:22.093 --> 53:26.636
And then they put these spirits on the king,

53:26.740 --> 53:32.513
onto his big ministers. And these
people are captured and possessed.

53:32.607 --> 53:34.517
And they say, “We are very erotic.

53:34.597 --> 53:41.730
We are running after – we used to run after only two women,
now we are running after hundred women.” Mad!

53:42.116 --> 53:45.114
They lose all their sense of Self.

53:45.254 --> 53:48.654
They have no understanding of what they are doing.

53:48.805 --> 53:52.991
Like mad they do. Even some saints can be affected

53:53.091 --> 53:55.425
but they get reactions physically.

53:55.770 --> 53:59.970
Saints if they indulge into it immediately they get reactions.

54:00.167 --> 54:03.167
They get reactions in the head, in the body.

54:03.333 --> 54:08.800
And the reactions could be very strong on them.
Sometimes they vomit too much.

54:09.252 --> 54:14.549
So ‘these’ people start putting those horrible

54:14.827 --> 54:18.398
sexes on you, capturing you, taking out your being.

54:18.616 --> 54:21.828
In India there was a tantrika like that

54:21.928 --> 54:25.439
who amassed lot of money but his wife [has pushed?] him throughout

54:25.519 --> 54:30.252
and he built that horrible temple of that Konaraka
[Temple near Puri].

54:33.337 --> 54:37.577
If he had not put any erotic’s there
it would have been a beautiful temple

54:37.657 --> 54:41.050
but with that erotic you feel like vomiting
all the time when you go.

54:41.169 --> 54:45.992
I mean, if you are healthy, you just can’t bear to see
those kinds of bathroom, the way it is done.

54:46.072 --> 54:53.869
Tomorrow they will ask us to watch
these people sitting down there for the morning ablutions!

54:54.624 --> 55:01.131
Filth and filth and filth! The whole place is nothing but filth.

55:02.441 --> 55:08.869
And then his own son defied him, this horrible tantrika.

55:09.287 --> 55:12.567
This tantrika was killed in a very funny manner

55:12.786 --> 55:15.147
which is worth reading how he was killed.

55:15.365 --> 55:18.470
And the son came down and he completed that temple
[In legends the architect’s son committed suicide jumping from the top of the temple.]

55:18.540 --> 55:22.101
but he told the King that, “Your kingdom will disappear.”

55:22.240 --> 55:27.615
All these – all these kings disappeared once for all.
They had no children,

55:27.736 --> 55:35.729
they had nothing and they became just shamble
and all of their temples were covered

55:35.896 --> 55:39.839
with stones, earth and they were just mounts.

55:39.919 --> 55:42.994
Later on the English came there

55:43.167 --> 55:45.692
and some of them excavated and found out.

55:45.772 --> 55:50.236
They found it artistic, I don’t know how
they found it but it was there.

55:50.356 --> 55:56.585
But in Konaraka you will find the whole thing is so vulgar,

55:56.943 --> 56:02.620
so horrid, where the artists – poor things – had nothing to say.

56:03.434 --> 56:07.323
And I met the artists of that place who are living around.

56:07.442 --> 56:12.958
They said, “We are paying through our drones
all these days for what our forefathers have done

56:13.534 --> 56:16.549
and we don’t want to see that.”

56:17.284 --> 56:24.694
Even today in India an unmarried man and
an unmarried woman will never go to see a konaraka.

56:25.547 --> 56:29.681
Now the only explanation they have is this, you’ll be amazed,

56:29.793 --> 56:35.599
that after marriage Indian women are so innocent as that
they’re married quite young, they don’t understand what is sex,

56:35.679 --> 56:40.579
so teach them how what is sex. It is made for the marriage

56:40.758 --> 56:43.218
and only the husband and wife should go there.

56:43.318 --> 56:48.784
This is the only explanation our Indian
artists could find out to give for that.

56:49.833 --> 56:51.192
But we have to accept.

56:51.291 --> 56:55.438
You see, in every country there could be a satanic force working.

56:55.537 --> 56:59.737
Why should we identify ourselves with those horrible tantrikas

57:01.053 --> 57:03.587
and why should we be ashamed of that?

57:06.291 --> 57:10.854
In Khajuraho the other tantric place you will find

57:10.954 --> 57:16.628
there are some places where you find eroticas.

57:16.787 --> 57:25.398
But if you are alert and if you watch,
these are kept in corners somewhere

57:25.676 --> 57:32.489
while the gods and goddesses have
big form, back, very great attachment, such a thing.

57:32.609 --> 57:39.295
So it never comes to your notice unless and until you are
taken to it and shown out that this is an erotica.

57:39.434 --> 57:47.256
But surprisingly most of the foreigners are specially
Japanese bringing their camera from this angle, from this angle.

57:47.490 --> 57:50.312
Why don’t they take their own photographs like that?

57:50.491 --> 57:53.864
What is there to go all the way
to Konaraka to take those photographs?

57:53.983 --> 57:56.602
Shows your search!

57:57.396 --> 57:59.498
Shows what you are asking for!

57:59.677 --> 58:03.474
The way from here people take all the way those big – big – cameras

58:03.594 --> 58:08.553
and go round. They take photographs like various angles they look.

58:08.832 --> 58:12.462
What is there to take photographs? In that what is there to gain?

58:12.542 --> 58:17.942
Sex, animals know, everybody knows, dog knows.
What is there to teach about sex?

58:19.447 --> 58:23.980
You have done so much of mentally that now there will be impotency.

58:24.167 --> 58:30.061
And in there, you know that, in America,
the highest number impotent are there

58:30.200 --> 58:35.400
because of this kind of perversion and ruining
your innocence within yourself.

58:36.569 --> 58:38.454
Beware of it!

58:39.486 --> 58:50.438
This so-called freedom is nothing but abandonment of
your sustenance of your Dharma that is within you. Is built-in.

58:51.847 --> 58:56.664
It is there. It exists. You cannot from,

58:57.498 --> 59:05.672
“Thou shall not commit adultery.” Christ has said, “Not only
adultery but I will say, ‘Thou shall not have adulterous eyes’.”

59:05.771 --> 59:08.311
And you see people, all the time they…

59:08.391 --> 59:11.843
And they say, “We are intelligent.” What did happen?

59:11.942 --> 59:15.553
Where are you looking?
Where are you seeing? Where is your attention?

59:15.692 --> 59:18.747
This human attention built up ages.

59:20.851 --> 59:26.718
So much has been worked out. You have been
brought from that level to this level today.

59:27.117 --> 59:33.743
Where are you getting? Into gutters, into filth, into dirt.

59:34.081 --> 59:47.000
Rise! And see your glory. Have your self-respect.
As a Mother, I tell you that.

59:47.794 --> 59:50.539
And these horrible tantrikas and mantrikas

59:50.631 --> 59:57.186
who are teaching you all kinds of things like putting a mandala
– the other day somebody told Me – and putting your sex there.

59:57.305 --> 59:59.865
What is a mandala? Do you know is the aura of God?

59:59.964 --> 01:00:02.305
You are showing your sex to God!

01:00:02.444 --> 01:00:06.293
Have some brains at least if nothing else.

01:00:06.809 --> 01:00:13.390
It’s the greatest shameful thing you are doing
if you show your sex part to God.

01:00:13.807 --> 01:00:20.255
Are you all lunatics? Can’t you understand? It’s a ceremony!

01:00:23.727 --> 01:00:25.593
I get upset with those

01:00:25.891 --> 01:00:30.315
because you don’t know. You will lose
all your chances of Realization.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:36.449
Your seeking is going to be lost completely, believe Me.

01:00:37.732 --> 01:00:42.937
Stand in your own glory. Why should you run after women?
Why should you run after men?

01:00:43.037 --> 01:00:47.719
If you are a glorious person, stand in your own image.

01:00:48.116 --> 01:00:51.850
That’s the best way you are going to be a human being.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.989
This kind of licentiousness and permissiveness is
going to completely finish that chakra in the Nabhi.

01:00:59.073 --> 01:01:06.073
If you see that one has got ten petals which are
built so carefully, delicately, beautifully, with love.

01:01:08.116 --> 01:01:12.947
Do not confuse love with licentious behavior.

01:01:13.066 --> 01:01:15.606
It is ‘not’.

01:01:17.667 --> 01:01:19.733
It’s sanctified love.

01:01:20.039 --> 01:01:24.246
I don’t say you become sanyasin, not at all,
I’m against that also, another extreme.

01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:28.492
Then I’m going to tell you about sexo-yogis, the third time.

01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:39.584
The sexo-yogis start as a people who are
suppressing their sex. They do not marry. (Tape interruption)

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:53.378
They use

01:01:54.768 --> 01:01:58.150
– they use the skull of a lady.

01:01:58.331 --> 01:02:04.082
They need skulls for that.
To be in the subconscious you have to have a skull.

01:02:04.294 --> 01:02:10.173
So they kill people, take out their skulls and keep it with them.

01:02:10.531 --> 01:02:14.439
Some people are coming, please open door.

01:02:14.817 --> 01:02:19.003
So the – they keep those skulls with them

01:02:19.499 --> 01:02:23.255
and those skulls they use it for drinking water,

01:02:23.653 --> 01:02:27.799
for eating food, all the time these skulls are there.

01:02:28.137 --> 01:02:36.986
Now there is a very good story written by a great writer in
India, Bankim Chandra [Chattopadhyay], is known as Kapal Kundala.

01:02:37.243 --> 01:02:43.989
This girl, there was a girl whom a Kapali [Mahadji?],

01:02:44.149 --> 01:02:48.305
he used to make her nude, he used to make her dance,

01:02:48.385 --> 01:02:53.523
he used to make her go in the see
and used to control his sex sitting before her.

01:02:53.702 --> 01:02:59.495
And there are several also, very sexual acts he would control also.

01:02:59.932 --> 01:03:04.515
He went on like that and ultimately he wants to kill that girl.

01:03:04.694 --> 01:03:12.466
That is the height of complete abstinence
because you kill the person whom you were supposed to have.

01:03:12.645 --> 01:03:17.763
Just imagine, what perversion! What brain! What habits!

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:26.907
I mean there’s no limit to this. God has not given you freedom
to break your head and to say that, “Oh, bull come and hit me!”

01:03:27.347 --> 01:03:34.767
And this girl was preserved and then someway
or other she ran away and she got married to a man.

01:03:34.946 --> 01:03:38.146
He visited her, brought her back and killed her.

01:03:41.173 --> 01:03:45.597
These are the Kapali.

01:03:46.152 --> 01:03:47.700
If you don’t listen to them,

01:03:47.839 --> 01:03:50.557
they will take you to the smashana that is the burial ground,

01:03:50.637 --> 01:03:53.770
cut your head, take out your skull and keep it.

01:03:54.783 --> 01:03:58.392
They will see to it that you go to the subconscious strata

01:03:58.593 --> 01:04:00.860
and they handle you better there.

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:07.082
They would like to die through their stamina.

01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:08.749
They do it.

01:04:09.146 --> 01:04:13.613
So many of them are doing like that. Even today, you have no idea.

01:04:14.563 --> 01:04:17.758
And people are so much enamored,

01:04:18.219 --> 01:04:20.886
so much under the obsession of these things are,

01:04:20.986 --> 01:04:25.310
that even if you tell them that your gurus are
doing like this and they have found out,

01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:27.943
still they will be there to kill you.

01:04:28.287 --> 01:04:33.087
Absolutely rabid people. They are possessed,
brain-washed completely.

01:04:33.724 --> 01:04:36.541
And if some people should be saved, to say…

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:46.025
I always say that if a sari keeps flying out,
even if you could hold a little bit of it, we can save this sari.

01:04:47.018 --> 01:04:51.684
The sanity must come to you to understand
that these horrible methods

01:04:51.899 --> 01:04:54.832
are not going to give you Self Realization.

01:04:56.046 --> 01:04:58.779
You must know what is Self Realization.

01:04:58.923 --> 01:05:02.414
Now some people think that flying in the air,

01:05:02.613 --> 01:05:05.146
jumping somewhere is something great.

01:05:07.553 --> 01:05:12.553
Which incarnation did? Did you hear any incarnation
[Delete ‘who walked’],

01:05:12.728 --> 01:05:18.521
who sat like this and was floating in the air?

01:05:19.057 --> 01:05:24.474
Which incarnation did that and what are you going to
do with floating in the air? You are going to

01:05:24.871 --> 01:05:26.696
create a problem on the traffic.

01:05:31.742 --> 01:05:34.742
These nonsensical things why should you do?

01:05:35.049 --> 01:05:38.828
There is in Puna [Shivapur],
they say there is one saint who died, you see,

01:05:38.958 --> 01:05:40.358
and there is a stone,

01:05:41.151 --> 01:05:44.934
if there ten people take the name of the saint, it can come up.

01:05:45.081 --> 01:05:47.553
And you can put a finger, it can come up.

01:05:48.467 --> 01:05:54.121
I said, “With that what God should do?” Think of it!

01:05:54.558 --> 01:05:56.442
And when I went there I found out

01:05:56.621 --> 01:06:02.672
that there was a big spirit sitting there and he said, “I’m going
to sit down here Mother. I’m not going to do [other thing?].”

01:06:02.812 --> 01:06:06.107
And the spirit of that horrible fellow
is all the time sitting there.

01:06:06.225 --> 01:06:07.635
He doesn’t want anything.

01:06:07.715 --> 01:06:13.848
He just want to meet good people and sit down there
and listen everybody’s taking his name,

01:06:14.057 --> 01:06:18.839
calling him a saint. When he is not a saint why should
we accept that he is a saint

01:06:18.957 --> 01:06:24.757
and be happy with it? Because human beings can do anything.
They have given that power.

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.974
And moreover God is powerless before you

01:06:29.061 --> 01:06:32.823
because He cannot take away your freedom to be idiots

01:06:32.883 --> 01:06:37.803
or to be foolish or to be self-destroying. He cannot do it.

01:06:37.863 --> 01:06:44.400
He can only weep and cry, beg on you,
“Please don’t do it, please don’t do it”, but He cannot stop it.

01:06:44.748 --> 01:06:51.114
That’s the only problem. And that’s why all of them have taken you.

01:06:51.246 --> 01:06:55.598
They have all come from somewhere like spiders.
At least I know fifteen of them.

01:06:55.757 --> 01:07:01.624
And three horrible women. They’re all there making money,
making money, befooling you.

01:07:05.204 --> 01:07:12.208
Why do you need a guru for telling you a mantra?
Any Dick, Tom, Harry can tell you.

01:07:12.486 --> 01:07:16.990
You must see the result, the proof.

01:07:18.359 --> 01:07:23.159
What’s happening out of it.
You must think. You are intelligent people.

01:07:25.204 --> 01:07:29.809
You understand everything, why don’t you understand this,
“I’m possessed.”

01:07:30.266 --> 01:07:34.115
Are you under the complete obsession of such people?

01:07:34.215 --> 01:07:38.550
Or perhaps you have paid them so much money that you think,
“Oh how we have paid so much now what,

01:07:38.649 --> 01:07:40.415
we should see through the whole thing.”

01:07:40.594 --> 01:07:44.919
Like in the drama you go and you don’t like the drama, still
when you have paid the money, then stand.

01:07:45.157 --> 01:07:48.450
It’s not that casual.

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:54.105
It’s a very serious thing. You are going into the den of devils,

01:07:54.344 --> 01:07:59.674
finishing your Kundalini completely. Now there are
at least twenty-five people among you who will say that.

01:07:59.774 --> 01:08:05.130
It has happened to them. I’ve been correcting them.
I’m doing it. They get it back.

01:08:05.607 --> 01:08:10.940
I only feel sorry for one thing,
that you have been genuine about your seeking.

01:08:11.202 --> 01:08:16.787
You have been genuinely seeking and
I can assure you that I went to America in 1970

01:08:16.887 --> 01:08:23.553
to warn on you but that time they were,
all of them had become something special type of possessed.

01:08:24.883 --> 01:08:30.755
They would not listen to Me. I told Ravi Shankar. He said,
“Mother you just don’t go near them. They will eat you out.”

01:08:30.954 --> 01:08:36.926
That out to have experiences of torn fulsome drugs.

01:08:38.117 --> 01:08:41.878
In India how many people have seen the drugs
– ask them, anyone of them ?

01:08:41.958 --> 01:08:47.292
Ha! Do they even know what is the difference
between bhang and this and that?

01:08:51.046 --> 01:08:54.846
These drugs and all these things were used by tantrikas.

01:08:55.073 --> 01:08:58.540
And they are out here. They have brought out that.

01:08:59.458 --> 01:09:03.743
Things that go against your awareness
whether drugs, alcohol, anything

01:09:03.903 --> 01:09:08.836
is ‘not’ going to give you that higher awareness about
which I’m saying.

01:09:10.268 --> 01:09:17.847
Don’t waste your life. It’s very precious.
The most precious and the greatest time has come.

01:09:19.256 --> 01:09:24.196
Please respect yourself. And please understand your value.

01:09:24.553 --> 01:09:28.978
What you have learned before, find it out and do not waste it.

01:09:29.276 --> 01:09:33.402
You have already wasted lot of your time.

01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:39.404
Means all these – I told you the seven stratas –

01:09:39.662 --> 01:09:44.498
on the left and right have names which I think that time

01:09:44.658 --> 01:09:49.340
I have no time to tell you but there are
names and names and names for everything.

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:53.375
Hakini, Rakini, Lakini, Shakini,
like that on the left hand side they have got.

01:09:53.467 --> 01:09:56.993
This side is Gayatri and Savitri and all that sorts of things.

01:09:57.112 --> 01:10:06.187
It goes on both the sides.
All these are nothing but like resonances.

01:10:06.466 --> 01:10:08.928
They throw you from one to another strata.

01:10:09.087 --> 01:10:11.259
You are sort of tested in every strata

01:10:11.359 --> 01:10:16.775
and when they found you are a gone case you go ‘direct’ into hell.

01:10:17.014 --> 01:10:19.434
These are all achieved!

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:29.950
So I have to make a very simple

01:10:30.565 --> 01:10:34.986
statement that keep your Self, respect your Self.

01:10:35.423 --> 01:10:41.870
Try. If it works with you, well and good. I’m here to work out the

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:47.882
raising of the Kundalini, the bringing it out of it.
You yourself would be able to do after some time

01:10:48.121 --> 01:10:51.854
but cleansing is needed and it should never be given up

01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:54.509
because there is no way out.

01:10:57.228 --> 01:10:59.745
Nanak – Guru Nanak –

01:11:00.202 --> 01:11:08.168
he has written at least three-four chapters against these
tantrikas and mantrikas and these paishakshikas and these jains.

01:11:08.565 --> 01:11:14.993
In India it’s an abuse to say – I mean I have first time used
these words for that on my tongue –

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:20.271
is an abuse to call somebody like this.
If you say that to someone they will take you to the court.

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:23.423
They are kept outside like lepers.

01:11:27.273 --> 01:11:35.200
Kabira has written books after books. These khecharis
and this and that he lashed them left and right,

01:11:35.339 --> 01:11:37.224
He was a great poet.

01:11:37.333 --> 01:11:40.120
Everybody fought with him, tortured him.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.827
Christ was the same.

01:11:42.145 --> 01:11:45.835
He is the one who said not to go towards spirits at all.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.733
This is all spirit’s job.

01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:53.923
But you go in London every fifth house is
a spiritualist sitting there,

01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:57.025
“Free hypnotics!”

01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:03.648
Why do you want to get hypnotized? Why do you want to get

01:12:03.788 --> 01:12:08.251
E.S.P – what they call – Extra Sensory Perception?

01:12:08.986 --> 01:12:15.732
All these so-called geniuses also,
these prodigies are also possessed.

01:12:16.307 --> 01:12:18.288
I’ve seen many prodigies.

01:12:18.371 --> 01:12:22.832
One of them came to Me. I told,
“All right, in My presence you calculate.”

01:12:22.952 --> 01:12:26.106
She could not calculate even in one

01:12:26.404 --> 01:12:32.455
because I put a bandhan to her possession. I said, “You get out!”

01:12:32.813 --> 01:12:37.025
I’ve had many such experiences which I can tell you.
Last time I’ve told you

01:12:37.167 --> 01:12:42.680
how people who are possessed came to Me and how they leave.

01:12:42.919 --> 01:12:51.291
Now there is still time and we can
move into Self Realization experience.

01:12:51.391 --> 01:12:55.120
It will – it might take to some people in five minutes
but to some more.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.848
In any case you must have patience. And don’t be angry with you.

01:13:00.022 --> 01:13:05.244
Because when Gavin said Ego – I was fired when he said –
because if it is not Ego then the Superego comes,

01:13:05.404 --> 01:13:11.804
“We are the worst people, we are the horrible people.
We…” you see, from one extreme to another.

01:13:13.452 --> 01:13:18.789
You have to stand in-between. You are glorious.

01:13:19.245 --> 01:13:23.799
You are not an aggressor neither
you are taking aggression from anyone.

01:13:23.938 --> 01:13:29.453
You stand within your Self and through
that you have your own powers.

01:13:29.949 --> 01:13:34.190
You don’t have to depend on anyone, nothing. You just are.

01:13:34.329 --> 01:13:37.226
But you have to depend on the deities that are within you,

01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:41.333
which I’m going to see. There has been a problem.
They have to be corrected

01:13:41.433 --> 01:13:45.163
and you have to know where are the deities, where are they.

01:13:45.282 --> 01:13:50.335
In the Sahaja Yoga – modern Sahaja Yoga I may call it –
there is no mantra given.

01:13:50.502 --> 01:13:55.375
No. Because every second the Kundalini is going like that.
Now there are people who’ll say,

01:13:55.494 --> 01:13:58.986
“This I can tell you, this I can tell you.”
It is here they saw that.

01:13:59.066 --> 01:14:05.018
You must have seen she came to Me, She tells Me that,
“Mother I’ve caught that.” All right, finished. Agnya catching.

01:14:05.177 --> 01:14:10.070
So nobody is given a mantra but you know where is the catch.
You yourself say.

01:14:10.189 --> 01:14:13.696
She herself came and told Me, “I’ve got it caught on Agnya.”

01:14:13.835 --> 01:14:18.239
And you know what’s the extreme Agnya catching means,
you know: paranoia.

01:14:18.319 --> 01:14:24.219
But she doesn’t mind telling Me because she sees herself
away from herself and she told Me, “I’ve got an Agnya clearly.”

01:14:24.476 --> 01:14:27.781
All of them say, “The Agnya is there.
I can see those coming inside me.”

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:34.487
He told Me that, “I can see these entities now coming into me.”
And I throw them away and they have a nice – a nice program.

01:14:34.666 --> 01:14:39.745
If you all talk to them, they will tell you their experiences.
Some of them went into trance; I had to take them out.

01:14:39.865 --> 01:14:43.634
So many things happen now. People just like you came to Me
and gained.

01:14:43.773 --> 01:14:48.240
And you’ll also gain but be sensible about it, be wise. Be wise.

01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:55.803
You have to expect gains and nothing else.
Nothing else you can found.

01:14:56.419 --> 01:14:57.885
So, may God bless you.

01:14:58.085 --> 01:15:01.299
You can go into a little meditation

01:15:01.617 --> 01:15:03.973
just by putting your hands towards Me

01:15:04.072 --> 01:15:07.028
and if you could take out your shoes it will be better.
It works better

01:15:07.148 --> 01:15:09.945
because the Mother Earth’s there and she helps no doubt.

01:15:10.045 --> 01:15:15.024
All the elements help you. They’re all around.
You see, it was very cold in the street.

01:15:15.163 --> 01:15:17.881
At this time it’s not so much.

01:15:18.199 --> 01:15:20.694
All the elements are there to help you.

01:15:20.833 --> 01:15:26.269
It was extremely cold and now so nice.
You can take out your coats and you’ll be all right.

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:34.255
There is this, your coats you hold out and you can
feel comfortable, then you’ll feel very nice. (Tape interrupted.)
