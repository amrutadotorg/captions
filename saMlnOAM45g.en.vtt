00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:11.520
… So I have attended to some people individually, but not to all; and I would like to attend to some of them later on once we have…

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.560
Please be seated.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.480
Hello! I didn't see you last night.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.120
So now the time has come for us to say goodbye to all of you.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.800
And you have to realize how important it is for us to get Sahaja Yoga settled in America.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.640
And that is why from everywhere people have arrived to work it out.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.120
Now the Americans have to realize their responsibility.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:20.840
I think they have a problem like this: if they have not been to any guru, they have not been anywhere, they have not met anyone like that, then they are not willing to listen to us in any case.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.040
If they have been to some guru, still they are not willing to listen to you.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:41.280
Now, if they have suffered with some guru, then only there's a little thing by which you can creep into their minds.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.640
If they have suffered.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.640
Otherwise they are not willing to listen to us.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.440
Under these circumstances rather difficult to work here, very difficult.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.800
Americans, I have found to be the most difficult people to handle.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:15.560
And… the gurus who are false are very successful because, you see, they are very… they appeal to you in a very shallow way, and if… that appeal is so attractive that people get enamored with it and they get lost.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:24.120
But once they start suffering, then they start thinking about it, and they think that all this kind of junk is of no use.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.280
But otherwise they go on collecting junks, and quite a lot of junk they collect.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.760
Moreover, when they start shifting from one guru to another also, there's a problem.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:45.720
Because they sufficiently do not suffer from one person, so they go to another and suffer from like that; they go on collecting from everyone some sort of a suffering.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.280
And ultimately they end up as a suffered personality, you see, "les miserables".

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.080
So I would request you, all of you, to have patience with them.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.360
You have to have tremendous patience; otherwise at the very outset you might give up so many people.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.960
So you have to have patience — this is their background.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.320
Because all the gurus have come here and they're stationed here.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.680
You see, their operation has been very deep-seated.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.960
They have come here and stationed here.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.400
Others are just… other countries they just visit, but here they are stationed.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.800
So, their operations are on, and we have to be rather careful.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.200
Not to feel upset or to give them up in our disgust.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.920
Because they are seekers, and of very high quality seekers.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.640
Only they have to touch their depth.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:52.480
If they teach… if they learn how to touch that depth, you'll be amazed that they may prove to be very great Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.080
So you have to be only careful on this point that they are shallow.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.000
And they have to be settled down by giving realization to them.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.360
Their concentration is very poor.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.360
And you have to put them towards their Kundalini.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.560
Ask them to put attention to their Kundalini instead of their Sahasrara.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.200
Let them put their attention to their Kundalini first of all.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:33.280
Because at Sahasrara, it's just the blossoming; but if the Kundalini is so weak, it won't rise, and there will be… might be one or two threads coming up and again dropping down.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.400
So the practical question is that how to make them deep seekers.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.080
So ask them to pay attention to their Kundalini — as a mother.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.920
Ans ask them to request the Mother Kundalini to rise.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.800
That She is the Mother and She has to rise.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.200
And then the spirit.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.560
And last of all the Sahasrara.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.120
Otherwise it won't work out.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.760
This is what I have found out with so many people who came to see us in the program.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:17.000
Of course, there are some deeper ones also, and they get to Sahaja Yoga in no time, but on the average, what I… My feeling was that they are not yet aware.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:34.400
And they don't understand that experience is not the same as the… what we call the bodha, means the experience of the knowledge, or the knowledge of awareness, or knowledge that can be understood through our awareness.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.440
They think that if there's somebody can give them a… just a push or a sensation in the body, then that person is something great.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.640
So they are to be told that it has to become your knowledge, it has to become a part and parcel of your awareness.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.400
Otherwise every… such things are of no use.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.360
The another thing is that they talk of big things.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.520
Like, they will say that God is love, so everybody is love.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.280
And this will be a very common thing you'll be facing.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.400
Then you have to ask them: "What about Hitler?"

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.600
Then they'll understand that there are satanic forces, as well as there is divine Love.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:25.240
If you just say, "All right, God is love, everybody is love, so go and ask a snake to bite you."

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.800
Because they do not have discrimination, that's why they come out with such theories.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.120
If they had sense of discrimination, they would not talk like this.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.520
So this is another great talk I hear from everyone, that there is Divine in everyone.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.440
But how far you can stand them, how far you can bear them, and how far you can raise the Divine is not your problem.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.240
You cannot do it.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.840
You have no powers to do it.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.800
On the contrary, you'll be lost trying to do that, playing with it.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:15.440
Thirdly, they cannot understand that you cannot pay, or you cannot have a business, or you cannot depend on the earnings of your God's work for your living.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:26.600
You have to have your own living… but for your livelihood you have to do something else, not God's work.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.760
This is the point which is very important; must be put into their heads properly.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.960
And if you can manage that, then they will understand.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.720
Because to talk to them is also impossible: they have barriers after barriers.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:55.360
So it's… has been a very great experience for Me because this time, first time in America in these three visits, I've really got people who are solidly placed, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:04.080
And I'm very happy and I'm very proud for all those who have come to the seminar and have learned so much about Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:12.560
If you have any questions or any problems — personal, or impersonal, or general — you must wright to Me.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.800
To Gavin's address or to Surbiton.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.280
Best is Gavin's address, so I get the letters.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.200
And even if I don't send you the answer, never think that I've not answered.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.520
You'll find the answer always ready for you.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.400
You just you have to bring it to My notice if you want to bring something to My notice.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.520
And it will be very effective.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.440
Why is he crying?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.920
Bhima! Bhima!

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.200
Why do you cry? Why…

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.920
All right, come here. Come here, come here.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.800
What happened?

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.280
What happened?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.960
Such a sweet thing like you, why are you crying, there is no need for you to cry.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.840
Bhima! Aaa! Now smiling. So sweet.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.360
I think he wanted to come to Me.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.960
They all do like that.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.240
Come along. Bhima! Come, come, what happened.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.200
What happened, what happened?

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.400
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, take him, take him, take him.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.880
All right, all right, [].

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.120
What's the matter? I thought you wanted to come to Me.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.200
Ah? What has happened?

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.920
Now take the milk. Come along, take the milk.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.160
Aha! Yes! You wanted to sit there.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.880
All right. They are wonderful.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.120
Now, I have some photographs to be given to you.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.320
Those who want can come forward.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.000
Now, have you any questions, anyone of you?

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.320
YOGI: Mother, if there's any proof that bhoots cause problems, he's got blisters coming up from his hands now.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.360
Absolutely the negativity coming out.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.240
SHRI MATAJI: Really?

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.880
[]

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.400
Which hand?

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.360
That's all right?

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.640
Still hurts?
YOGI: It still… still…

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.160
SHRI MATAJI: Bring some lemons please. Put a lemon on your left side.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.960
Better? All right? Better?

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.480
Better.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.040
Just now, just let them be, the lemons will absorb.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.840
It's already better now, but still, it will be…

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.000
See, horrible things. Now just see for yourself: "God is love", and this is "love".

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.600
Now, those who want… (says a phrase in Marathi?)

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.880
[] on your heart. You have to put it like this.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.640
Can you let him… let him put it over his heart.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:18.760
Good.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.240
May God bless you!

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.600
Bhima! What about you?

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.160
Why were you crying?

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.000
Put it on the heart.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.240
So I have to talk to you also, talk to you all, to write to people.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.000
Yes. May God bless you.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.160
Better now, much better.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.640
Are you better now?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.600
Hello, [how are you]? Ah? Doing well?

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.480
Good. We'll talk now.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.400
Who else? Good.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.240
What [I were]… ah, Mr. [Katz].

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.080
You have got?

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.320
They will, they will absorb.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.520
Put it to your hand. Hold it down.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.320
Who else is there?

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.560
Please come here.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.880
All the children are so sweet.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.720
Those who will kiss Me only.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.480
YOGI: Is that applied to all of us?

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.880
SHRI MATAJI: Not with mustaches.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.560
YOGI: I had a shave.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.360
SHRI MATAJI: No, still, those who have grown mustaches cannot kiss Me.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.880
YOGI: In this lifetime [].

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.280
SHRI MATAJI: May God bless you!

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.840
YOGI: Ten years too old.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.040
SHRI MATAJI: You are better now?

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.480
How is your husband?

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.400
Let's see him.
YOGINI: [].

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.880
YOGI: That's why [].

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.040
SHRI MATAJI: Good. Good. May God bless you!

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.920
Now, what about you?

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.920
Come along, better have it.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.800
Why not? Everybody's having, so why not have it?

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.680
SHRI MATAJI: May God bless you!
YOGINI: You've given me two, Mother.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.200
SHRI MATAJI: All right, so I'll give you one.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.240
Oh, you came. Competition, all right.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.360
Did you get one? Everyone?

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.600
YOGI: Mother, with Your permission.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:27.520
All the visitors who came here in New York would like to say a big thank to all the East Coast Sahaja Yogis whoever organized this seminar.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:35.480
And we have seen Michael turning like an helicopter around, so perhaps we could give a hand to Michael, Christine and all of them.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.080
SHRI MATAJI: Did you take one? Did she get one?

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.400
[] What about you?

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.240
Now better. Is it better?

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.680
Let Me see. Put them here, both of them.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.320
Now see in your hands. See what… How is it? No, no, just see.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.240
Still there? Better now? Better. Just hold it again.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:13.960
Hello!

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.240
CHILD: Hello!

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.440
SHRI MATAJI: Hello!

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:47.760
You know, she came and told… somebody else was trying to help; she said, "Put your eyes like this."

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.480
This one.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.720
What's that? Chana.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.880
Chana, I know. You have it in your hand now. Come on.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.240
Give it to everyone. Go.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.680
Give to everyone.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.880
Now you give it to everyone.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.000
That's the one for you.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.240
And better not get [any] [].

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.080
Give it to him, give it to Gregoire.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.320
That's the most needed one.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.640
To Gregoire. Give it to him.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.680
Children have them.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.360
Did you take one?

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.600
Now. Any other questions?

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.360
Any other questions?

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.840
YOGI: No questions.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:41.920
SHRI MATAJI: Ah?

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.400
Good idea.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.320
From this side it's OK.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.680
YOGI: They could all sit before You, and we go at the end.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.760
SHRI MATAJI: Now. All right. [That should be there] [].

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:12.080
Now, if there is no question, they would request you, all of you, to sit down around Me here and let them take one photograph.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.600
YOGI: Could we have one question, Mother?

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:24.120
There seems to be some confusion… there seems to be some confusion between centers about the left and right hemispheres.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.120
Where the…

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.960
YOGI: The left Swadhishthana and the right Swadhishthana.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.800
YOGI: Yes, Mother.
SHRI MATAJI: Ah?

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:47.120
YOGI: Mother, do You remember I asked You some time ago — in Austria I think it was, or Switzerland — about the places of these… the different chakras on the head?

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.760
And left Swadhishthana is here, right Swadhishthana is here.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.240
And right Vishuddhi is here, left Vishuddhi is here, like this.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.160
In other words, it's only at Sahasrara that there is the crossing, is that correct?

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.520
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, yes. Just above.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:14.960
Above. No, no, you see, the thing is, the Agnya is higher here, becomes higher than the Swadhishthana, that's why the crossing takes place lower… higher.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.920
So, that's why left Swadhishthana expresses itself here.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:19.960
YOGI: Where, Mother?

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.960
SHRI MATAJI: Left Swadhishthana expresses itself here…

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.400
YOGI: On the right side, Mother?

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.520
SHRI MATAJI: No, sorry, sorry. Left here, right [].

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.720
YOGI: Left Swadhishthana on the left side?

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.600
And left… left Nabhi on the left side also?

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.960
SHRI MATAJI: Left Nabhi, you see, is here. [].

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.400
YOGIS: On the left side. On the left.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.960
SHRI MATAJI: On the left side. Both the Nabhis are.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:55.360
YOGI: The other question, Mother… because there was some… about… as my… my understanding is that You said that Russia was left Agnya and China right Agnya.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.240
Is that co—
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, no.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.920
No, no, no. It's the other way round, how can it be.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.120
I think it's seen in their way of behavior. Like, China—

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.160
YOGI: [All the Far East] psychology is left Agnya…

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.280
SHRI MATAJI: Now, that's the trouble.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.400
Trouble with Germany also.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.960
YOGI: Russia is right Agnya and China left?

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:26.760
SHRI MATAJI: But they get entangled: now China is becoming the rightest and Russia is becoming the leftest, what to do. That's what I…

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.440
So if you say that "What is right Swadhishthana?" — is Germany.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.240
But Germany is all attacked, is full of bhoots now.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.440
So I don't know what to say.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.760
I mean, only human beings can be like that.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.800
All parapsychology, everything Russia has taken.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.360
So what can you do about, this is the trouble with them.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.920
I think egoistical people always take to such things.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.280
Because they think they'll have higher powers.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.440
And then they get enslaved in that.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:10.040
That's why in America, why so much of parapsychology, this thing is — because they thought they'll have higher powers, you see.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.520
Is a power game.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.520
But they don't know these are the spirits.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.560
They get enticed with it.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.720
You can't decide. I mean, you cannot say, but the actual, basic nature is that.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.760
YOGI: Right Agnya, Russian people.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.480
SHRI MATAJI: Very aggressive.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.160
Extremely aggressive Russians are.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.520
I mean, they don't want to sit tight in their own places.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.400
They want to go to Afghanistan, the want to go here, they want to go there; I don't know why shouldn't they sit in their own places.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.360
YOGI: Now, yes, Mother.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.120
Historically, they were always attacked first.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.040
SHRI MATAJI: They always attacked?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.680
YOGI: They were always attacked first.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.080
They never attacked first, the Russians.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.640
SHRI MATAJI: [], you see.
YOGI: They were attacked first by the Swedish, by…

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.960
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, tsar [].

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.920
You see, this is something, I'll tell you, what is tsar system and all that []. Very aggressive people.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.360
[] aggress[ive].

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.680
YOGI: Well, then… then I [got it] from…

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.520
SHRI MATAJI: Aah, you misunderstood. Left Agnya.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.080
Because China was always… you know, they had this opium thing, this, that…

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.080
Even to… China was… Mao, what he did was nothing but left Agnya.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.080
YOGI: Conditioned, very.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.400
SHRI MATAJI: Very much conditioned.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.280
Now they are getting out American influence.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.360
[Mixture].

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.840
Forget about them.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.280
YOGI: Mother, I have a question.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:45.960
When You were [] and the Russians came in and You said, "Go out!" — at what point do You think that that is a responsible…

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:55.160
SHRI MATAJI: What?
YOGI: When is that responsible behavior… for someone like me, for example, I'm just… if people come to me, let's say…

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.200
YOGI: When do we know where to draw a line with…

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.520
YOGI: When do You know to… when to assume that responsibility?
SHRI MATAJI: Gradually you will learn.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.640
You see, just now I would not say that this [] and all that.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.640
But like as a… as a gardener knows [where to nip] the thing, isn't it? In the same way.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.440
Gradually you'll know when to stand up and say something.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:22.960
All right?

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.520
Everything is depending on your growth.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.640
When you start growing, you exactly know what to do when.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.080
It's a question of growth.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.920
You see, like a little child now, she doesn't know how even to hold the bowl.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.360
When you grow, you know how to handle it.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.000
You are not to be told then, isn't it? It's like that.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.880
Is a question of growth.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.040
I mean, simple thing like… you are on a bicycle.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.720
First you fall, these things happen…

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.880
We always say, "When do we think that we are balanced?" — when you are balanced.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.760
That's the only answer.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.200
[]

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.600
YOGI: I wish You reach [], Mother.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:16.360
SHRI MATAJI: You know, for the time being, you could just grow.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.120
You don't have to protect Me. I know how to manage.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.440
All right?

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.960
That's the thing makes people very upset because they can't bear anybody insulting Me.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200
But don't you worry.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.840
It's very serious for those who insult Me, and there will be trouble.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.360
You don't worry on that.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.960
Actually I just go on saying, "[Baba], God save them!"

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.280
That's all.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.240
Now.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.600
So now, individually, where should I sit? In My room?

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.600
Will that be all right?

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.640
So I say goodbye to you and thank you very much.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:00.040
You must grow up in your awareness and realization and become masters.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.800
This is My blessing to all of you.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.400
You all have to be masters of Sahaja Yoga. Every individual.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.480
It's not that "my husband is doing" or "my wife is doing". It's you, alone.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.600
Every individual has to become the master.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.360
First master yourself.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:26.320
If you are dominated by your bad habits, or your own problems, and your own hankerings, then you must know you are not yet a master.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.520
Then master Sahaja Yoga. By that you'll master everyone.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.000
May God bless you!

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.720
I'll be always at your [back and] [], whenever you ask Me.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.360
May God bless you! May God bless you!

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.320
Please come.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.880
They got chana here.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.000
Sit down. All of you has to… photograph is to be taken.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.040
Aah! What an idea!

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.920
She's just remembered.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.280
YOGI: OK, I think that's enough.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.640
SHRI MATAJI: We've done now?

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.960
YOGI: One more photo, one more.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.920
YOGI: So, let's [all be] historical.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:30.400
YOGI: … sincerely thank Mataji through the bottom of our heart for spending time with us for last one and a half month and doing the… such a big work whatever She is… such a magnanimous, magnanimous work She is doing.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.120
I hope all of you Americans will join me …

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.960
YOGI: All of us.
YOGI: And everyone who is not here also.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:44.720
YOGI: … and everyone who is not here joins me in expressing our heartfelt thanks, gratitude to dear Mother.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.400
SHRI MATAJI: Thank you very much.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.960
So, the last []?

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:03.160
So many children to be left here in America; I['ll] look after them.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.960
All right, those who want to see Me now individually can come to My home.

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.600
YOGI: At least we are not orphans, Mother.
