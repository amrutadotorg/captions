00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.320
Please come and sit down.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.880
For those people who’ve come
for the first time,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.720
let me introduce to you
Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.240
She just arrived back from London
after a very brief return visit

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.200
where she had to accompany her husband
who’s a distinguished member

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.640
of the diplomatic community.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.120
He’s Secretary General
of the United Nations Agency

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.280
of the Maritime Agency

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.880
and she’s come back to us
here in America.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.760
Many of you have been before
and experienced Sahaja Yoga

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.680
which means spontaneous union.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.160
And this is what makes Mataji
and Sahaja Yoga different

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.680
to all the other searchings and pathways
that we’ve probably all been following

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.680
because it’s an actual happening.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.040
It’s something that happens
in her presence,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.360
in the presence of a holy person,
a realised soul.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.075
The awakening occurs spontaneously.

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:27.120
The awakening is the presence
of the Holy One.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.560
It’s not the promise
of something to come,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.040
it’s not striving, it’s not discipline,
it’s not certain practices

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.480
which lead to the conclusion
of Self-realisation

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.560
but it’s an actualisation.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.360
So Mataji has to be
somebody very special.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.240
But that you’ll find out yourself.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.720
When you get your realisation
you become connected

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.040
to the all-pervading power of God

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.880
and with that connection
you can find out the truth for yourself.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.560
You actually become like a computer
having been programmed this lifetime

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.680
and previous lives
right up to this point

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.280
where as seekers you want the ultimate.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.680
Now by her grace you get the connection
and when you get the connection

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.480
you get the ultimate.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.440
You find within your body
there is a subtle body

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.800
which is the mechanism
which connects you.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.520
That subtle body is the chakra system.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.560
In her presence the Kundalini rises
just as quickly as a split of a second

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.160
in most cases.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.680
In people who damage their chakras
it may take a little longer

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.800
and may take some perseverance
on your part

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.440
and a lot of care and nurturing
and a lot of love and compassion

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.200
from our holy Mother.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.280
But Kundalini rises through the centres
and passes through the top of the head

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.000
at this centre called the Brahma Andhra

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.880
and when that happens
you become your spirit.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.080
You become a Self-realised soul.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.080
You touch reality for the first time
in all your lives

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.960
that this actually happens.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.760
Many people here tonight
have already got it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.840
because you see her presence is everywhere

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.840
and at the programs that we had
the last two nights

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.680
many people actually got the experience.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.480
As we said to you, Mother is everywhere.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.080
Her presence is everywhere

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.120
and when you ask for it
with a humble heart,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.600
when you ask for your Self-realisation
and your desire is a pure desire

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.800
to be one with God, it’s granted.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.720
The grace of God is overflowing
at this time.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.360
Mother often says that
on the tree of life

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.240
there were very few flowers at first.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.000
Now there are many, many flowers
and the blossom time has come.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.920
Many, many of those flowers
have to turn to fruit.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.720
And so you have to see
that this is what it is.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.520
So without any further talking again
I’d like to introduce to you our Mother,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.240
Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.760
May I suggest that before you start
listening you just slip your shoes off

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.200
because that will help you connect
yourself to Mother Earth

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.040
and simply hold your hands out
in this fashion resting on your lap

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.320
because the vibrations
flow in through your hands

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.440
and the connection with the Earth
will help you to feel the vibrations.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.640
For those people who’ve already got it,
you know what I mean.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.000
For those who are new, be open minded,
be like a scientist

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:18.080
and just verify the experience
for yourself after it happens.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.840
It’s nice to see so many people
who have got realization

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.880
and who are in New York.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:35.360
New York is a very pivotal place
in the history of spirituality.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.560
It is absolutely the centermost point,
of a very important chakra,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.480
which is the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.480
You are stationed at this point.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.560
That’s why Americans talk
of very big things, of universal things,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.480
of universal consciousness,
they talk of solving the problems

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.840
of the world, they talk of the liberty
of the whole universe,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.360
and their attention is all very widespread,
because you stand at that point.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.680
New York is really placed
at a very pivotal point, no doubt,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.040
and that’s why you are attacked the most.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:21.600
The attack comes because they know
that here is the place one has to attack,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.920
the negativity is a cunning.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:37.120
It is very difficult for you people
who are seekers, who are earnestly seeking,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:45.360
who are a special category,
who are the men of God,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.400
to understand the cunning of the negative.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.160
There is no way that you can find it out.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.880
Like in India it’s easy.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.640
Because Indian scriptures have described,
described them at length

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.840
into all details what is the hell,
how the people who are negative act,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.120
how they affect you by their mesmerism,
how they take advantage of you,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:24.720
how they come in a garb or wearing the –
as they say sheep skin by the bhoots.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:31.760
Though we have read about it in the Bible,
and we have heard about it, but still,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.360
as Christ’s life was only
for three or four years, we should say,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.120
it has not been made so clear-cut to us.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.920
Naturally I don’t blame you
if you were misled.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.600
Actually I came to New York,
was nine years back,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.920
and Warren must have told you.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.960
But I found that people still
need more maturity here,

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.560
because they are busy
with their own ideas about things,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.960
and they were given more
through circuses

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.760
and elaborate presentations,
they would not accept a simple thing,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.720
a very, very simple thing,
that is Sahaj Yog.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.080
One must know, whatever God does,
is the simplest of all,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.040
but is also very difficult,
because it’s a mystery.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.120
Like a flower becomes a fruit:
they have never bothered even

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.680
to find out how it happens,
you cannot explain, can you explain?

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.400
Can you explain how a seed sprouts?

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:42.960
We can’t explain anything on that level
of how, with all our scientific things

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.640
we have done, with all our great
enterprises, the big things we talk about,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.040
we cannot explain, that is a mystery,
that is the mystery.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.920
And this is what we should know,
that these people who come to us,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.000
create a mystery out of them,
and try to impress you.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.240
As I said before, I don’t mind.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.800
Let them earn money,
they are people without any background,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.160
they are people…
some of them have been in literally

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.560
like beggars some of them,
came out of the jail,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.480
such things like that.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.480
For them money might be very important,
I don’t know why they do it.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.760
It’s really, they don’t perhaps know also
what they are doing,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.280
it’s absolutely dangerous for them
and for others.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.360
But some of them are real devils.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.880
They are quite aware
as to what they are doing.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.520
Some of them are anti-Christ.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.280
Absolutely born on 666
[inaudible words].

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.520
They can be proved as anti-Christ,
once you become a realized soul.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:10:01.680
But this mystery of a living process,
is to be understood even logically,

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.000
not rationally but logically.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Logically we can approach
at a proper conclusion

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.080
to understand what is good
and what is bad.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.680
What are we to expect,
what should be the seeking.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.440
As I have told also before,
that if you become something else,

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:33.520
if you become master of yourself,
if you know how to handle this power

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.680
you have got, then you have achieved
what was said to be born again.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.400
Not when you play into the hands
of others, like stupid people

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:51.920
just moving without any understanding
into what direction we are moving like,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:11:00.320
just herds of sheep driven into sea
or into any ditch God only knows.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:07.360
With our own ideas if we are identified
also there could be a danger,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.520
so we should keep ourself
absolutely open

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:19.440
and logically come to the conclusion
to find out: what are we seeking?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:26.240
Are we seeking slavery?

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.280
America always talked about the liberty,
and fraternity, and all those things.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:37.120
What is fraternity?
Is collective consciousness.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.760
They are talking of all these
big, big things,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:48.560
without realizing that a day will come
when they will all have to become.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.120
And because you talk so big
they have attacked you also.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.560
Because they know that the Unconscious
has revealed the great truths to you,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.880
great things to you,
that’s why they attack you.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:11.360
This attack is so subtle,
that it is impossible for anybody

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.040
to find out where you are being attacked.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.880
After coming to New York this time,
I found out some new methods

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.320
of these people that are trying
to betray the truth.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.400
But truth will be established,
truth has to be established.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.760
It takes time.
It will have to be established.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.000
But those who do not accept it
will be destroyed.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.080
No doubt about it.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.320
You have to accept the truth:
it’s for you, for your good,

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.400
for your evolution.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.360
And those who do not want to accept,
they’ll have to accept the falsehood.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.760
And falsehood leads you nowhere
but to destruction.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:02.960
It is not realized it, still,
that, in a country like America,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.480
we are not going to be destroyed
by Russia or by any external force,

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:17.520
but by the building internal force
of insecurity, and also of ignorance.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.920
We’ll be gradually destroyed
to such a state

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.880
that nothing will be left out of us,

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:31.600
and people will just see some bubbles
on the shores talking of big things.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:38.400
It is we who have to save ourselves first,
we have to build up ourselves first,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.520
we have to become ourselves inside
so that we become strong,

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.640
so that we know we become the masters.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:54.000
It is not the mastery of the world,
but the mastery of your Self,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.600
which you should have.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.600
A person of Christ’s caliber
came on this earth.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:08.720
And was accepted by Americans,
legally accepted.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.600
He cannot be arrested I think now
if He comes to America.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.320
But how will you recognize Him?

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.880
Is there any method
by which you recognize?

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.080
I can tell you this much,
that if He comes here,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.120
even if He is not arrested,
He won’t stay here for one day

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.560
more than I can stay.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.160
The reason is, when you are talking
to the media here,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.960
you think you are talking to the walls!

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.440
If you go and see in other places,
the media is sensitive!

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.240
Because they have received
so many shocks I believe,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.600
that now they are so stunned
that they don’t want to have anymore!

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.680
But take the other way.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.600
Supposing you have lost a diamond,
and somebody tells you

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.360
there is a diamond here. Why not see?

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.240
I can tell you, if somebody says
there is a diamond freely available,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.400
people will start coming all the way
from Australia and all places,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.360
from Japan, to get that.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.480
But when I say that it is free, I mean,
today the sahaja yogis here were telling Me

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.240
that if you say it is free,
Americans won’t understand.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.320
They think whatever is free
cannot be alright (laughs),

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:36.560
it cannot be alright, something wrong,
there, something snag. Just imagine.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.160
How can you sell, it-Self?

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:48.000
It’s an insult, it’s an insult of God.
It’s an insult of Divinity.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.400
Remember Christ took a hunter in His hand
to beat all the people who were selling.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:02.400
And you believe that you can purchase God,
it’s another nonsense.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.920
God doesn’t understand money,
He never knew what money is.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.000
Neither He’ll know what money is.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.560
It is you who have created money
and all the problems that have come with it.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:28.400
Now God’s message, His laws,
His kingdom is very different.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.080
He has got communications,
which are very subtle.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.880
His ways and methods are so great
that unless and until you come

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.560
into His domain you won’t understand
how great He is.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.880
And His creation’s this.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:54.000
He has to save this creation of His,
it is He who is more anxious,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.320
it is He who wants to do it.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:04.240
It is His own method of bringing forth
this special evolution

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.720
by which you enter into His kingdom,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:12.640
because He is the loving Father,
the Father who is the most loving of all,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:19.040
and wants to bestow the highest
upon His own beloved children.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.840
He has made you so beautifully,
so beautifully He has made you,

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.320
here you can see that.
(She shows the chakra chart)

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.680
Again, artists have tried to make it
beautiful but it is not that beautiful

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.720
as you are.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.800
You are really beautifully styled.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.600
I can see that beauty, and you will also
start seeing and enjoying the beauty

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.440
of others once you get your realization.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.040
This is your Kundalini
(She points to sacrum bone) –

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.960
I’m sure Warren must have told you
about all the seven chakras you have.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.240
I have heard people are doing here called,
something called ‘chakra therapy’,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.800
and I laughed at that.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.000
And a lady asked Me, “They take such
a lot of money, Mother, for this

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.200
chakra therapy”.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.000
Now just ask the one who does that,
that how much money did you pay

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.840
to create these chakras within you?

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.160
How much money did you pay
to become a human being?

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.760
What did we do to get
this beautiful body of ours?

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:28.080
How much did we pay to be just breathing?

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:33.760
Imagine, for your breathing
if you have to pay money, dollars,

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.320
first of all you can’t get more
than two hundred exchange here,

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.280
and how will you exist with that 200
if you have to pay a dollar every breath?

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:52.160
This is a thing we forget,
that we are living human beings,

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.440
and that living process has been always
a mystery for human beings,

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.440
and will remain a mystery
till you get realization.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.240
So far we have done nothing living,
nothing living.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.280
All this is dead, can you find anything
that is living here, is done by you?

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.640
For example, the growth
of these beautiful things, can you achieve?

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:22.880
Nothing. At the most, if there is mud,
you can create a pot.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.800
Look around: can you do anything living?

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.320
And the One who does billions
and billions of such things every moment,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.400
cannot be forgotten.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.160
You may not face it, but that’s a fact,
He exists.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.960
There is a power that exists
which brings forth all these things.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:50.320
Now within us is a power,
is the Kundalini.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.720
And this Kundalini is a living power.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.680
This is a power which is residual,
we call that,

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.040
because it has manifested the whole,
the whole universe and everything,

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.840
and still it has not manifested itself
because it is the residual power

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:13.280
of your desire to be one with the Divine.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.040
Unless and until that has happened,
unless and until you are baptized –

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.160
in the real sense,
the way John the Baptist did,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.080
not just somebody coming:
“Alright, I baptize you”.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.720
It’s all artificial, it’s all a drama.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.873
I’m Myself born a Christian,
I used to laugh aloud as a child,

00:20:30.873 --> 00:20:34.240
I used to laugh aloud: “What’s this
drama going on? No Kundalini rising,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.720
nothing, and they are baptizing!”.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:46.400
Baptism, John the Baptist could do,
because he was a realized soul.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.680
Those who are not realized
cannot give realization,

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.320
they have no authority.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:00.480
Alright, even say, in ignorance
you believe that you can do it.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.200
But now, when it has come to reality,
must you not accept it?

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.440
Must you not get it?

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.400
Why this obstinacy not to get it,
I can’t understand.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.840
And this is what is wrong
with our rationality,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:21.280
that we can justify everything
that we know, like: “I believe”.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.200
Now if you believe that Kundalini is here,
what can I do about it?

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.880
It is not, it is not, it is here.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.160
But because you have read a book
which was nine hundred pages,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.840
naturally you have paid so much effort,
you have every reason to believe

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.600
in that book (She laughs) because you
have put it so much of effort

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.480
that you can’t get over it:
“Now I’ve done Mother,

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.440
what am I to do now? I believe in it”.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.040
Like the other day one fellow said –
there’s one anti-Christ, and he said:

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.680
“I’m taking his name
for the last ten years,

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.480
now how can I forget it?”.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:03.040
If you have lost something,
and you are searching it, and truly,

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:08.880
even for ten years, and if you know that
that is not the way you find it,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:14.640
you will give up. Is common sense,
is absolute common sense one should have

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.240
to understand that within us God must
have placed something beautifully

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.640
to work it out and…

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.320
The chakras and all that they have
started talking quite alright,

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.520
some borrowed feathers from somewhere
I don’t know how;

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.240
I don’t know if they know
about the chakras also besides see

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.440
what they are like, how many centers
they have got, and how many they control,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.360
and they how they work out.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.280
I have no idea as to how much they know
and how much they have learnt,

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:48.800
because you can read any book,
some tantrikas or somebody unauthorized

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.760
might have told them something
and here comes the book.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.440
In America I think it is easiest
to publish any book.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.920
Nobody says no to anything that no sense,
so all kinds of books they may have wrote.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.840
And people are very fond of reading,
I was coming by plane and one gentleman

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.000
finished three books, sitting next to Me.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
I was amazed at his speed,
the way he was reading.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:25.120
This kind of reading gives us
a blurred idea, a confusion, about God.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:31.600
One has to know that if you become
the reality, you should be able to

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.280
reason the reality, you should be able
to discriminate,

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.920
you should be able to see reality.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.440
For example somebody says: “Oh, I am a
person who is born again,” or say

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.280
“I am a realized soul”.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:48.160
Alright, if you are a realized soul,
can you tell Me what is the problem

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.520
with this gentleman, can you tell me what
are the centers catching in this man,

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.880
or can you tell Me what are your problems?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.920
At least minimum that much
you should know.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.920
They said: “No, no, that we don’t know,
but we are born again”.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.520
This is self-certification, I mean,
if you give a certificate to yourself –

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.880
I am the President, President of America
– you don’t become.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.360
Like some people say: “I’m Omkara”

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.040
By saying ‘I’m Omkara’, do you become?

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.400
You have to really become.
Actually become.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:29.760
It has to happen within us,
that’s why becoming is the point.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.960
We should ask ourselves:
what did we become?

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.400
Are we master of ourselves?

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:45.040
Now one may say that,
‘What is the authority of Mataji?’.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.480
I have heard a thing like that (laughs).
It’s correct!

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.400
I don’t say you should not
challenge the authority.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:59.760
But whose authority will you accept?
Best authority is yourself.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:05.120
If I say My authority is Christ,
if I say My authority is Rama,

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.760
is Shri Krishna, and all the ancient
scriptures and all the scriptures,

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:15.840
and all the great poets who have sung
the song of the truth are My authority,

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.840
you won’t be able to relate.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:24.000
But the best thing is you yourself
should be the authority to judge Me.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.960
You yourself should know
and see for yourself.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.040
It’s like you bring ten people
in the room who are blind,

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:40.800
there are no lights, and there you say
that the color of these flowers is red.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:46.400
Then you will say: “What is the
authority of yours that these are red?”.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.640
Now, because I can see! “But we cannot
see, so how are we to believe?”

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.240
So best thing is that I open your eyes,
and put on the lights,

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.040
and you see for yourself.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.800
You can also relatively see.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.960
For example a person who first time
has never seen a red color,

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.480
or a blue or a black,
then how are you to tell him?

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:16.080
You have to take something as an absolute,
you can say: “Alright, if this is red

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.680
then that is red,
that is called as red”.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.360
In the same way we can relatively
also judge this.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.200
The other day I told you an example,
you take two people who are suffering

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:33.440
from cancer, two people who are suffering
from say lunacy,

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.400
and two people who are suffering
from fake gurus (laughter, laughs),

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.960
and two people who are realized souls.
Or – and take two people

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.240
who are not realized.
Let’s take like that, a group.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.600
Now, the person who is sitting before us
– you can see yourself, not Me –

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.640
the one who is from lunatic asylum
or who has got problems, mental problems,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.120
will be shaking, like that.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.560
Some will shake little,
some will really rackle with it,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.960
absolutely rackle.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.360
Then, if you want to see the person
who has got cancer,

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:15.120
he’ll be emitting heat so much, so much,
that the whole room will be filled

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.840
with hot air.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.880
Now, the third person, who is realized,
will feel cool breeze.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.320
Tremendous cool breeze, peace and bliss.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.320
And the one who is not realized
may little bit feel the cool breeze,

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.640
may feel hot, you see,
the mixture of everything,

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.840
so he’ll feel all the mixtures.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.120
Now you ask the lunatic
“From where do you come?”, they’ll say:

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.800
“We are certified mad
coming from lunatic asylum”.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.440
You ask the patient, he’ll say that
“I’m from such and such place”.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:55.120
But people do not want to see this fact.
Is very simple to verify.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:00.320
Now moreover, the credibility of a person
who is taking money from you,

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.320
taking everything from you,
is putting you on the street,

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:10.480
who is making other people mad,
has to be challenged.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:16.480
Instead of that they will challenge My
credibility, but not of those people –

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.680
the reason is you are no more there,
you are hypnotized, you will not.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.600
But here you are free,
and you should challenge.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:31.840
I appreciate it because of freedom,
is an expression, you are free to challenge.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:38.800
But that doesn’t mean freedom is a license
to again drift into nonsense.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.360
You keep your mind open,
receive your realization.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:52.560
I do not know in what words to say
that you are the ones who have been

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.320
seeking truth for ages now.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.840
In the mountains, in the hills,
in the dales, in the Himalayas,

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.320
and all over you have been seeking
for thousands and thousands of years.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:12.720
You are seekers, you are a special
category of people, and you must seek it,

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:18.560
you must find it, instead of it
you seek your hell.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:24.480
What can a person like Me feel about it?
Is such a tragic thing,

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:30.480
that the one who is really seeking
the reality is lost.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:39.520
I wish you could understand My concern
and My anguish, that: look at these people,

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:45.760
they have been seeking, seeking God,
they are such nice people, such good people

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:56.240
– are being harmed, have been tortured,
are now on their way to hell.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:03.040
It’s a very, very sad situation,
and that I am trying My level best

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.440
to convince you that you seek the truth.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.440
You ask for the truth.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:15.120
And you get it, establish it,
and save others who are being ruined.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.200
Because they will be seeking in any case
whatever you may try,

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.560
till the end they will be seeking,
till they are drowned completely.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.840
They are seekers.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.040
Today we were coming and one
of the sahaja yogini was sitting

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.680
at the back in the airplane.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.760
And there was a fellow sitting next to her
who was reading some book on meditation.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.000
And she, she asked him,
‘Are you a seeker?’.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.040
He said: ‘Yes, I am’.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.680
And he got his realization
in the airplane.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:48.320
She herself has come to Me I think,
about few months back.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.600
And she gave him realization
and he got his realization.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.240
You could see from his eyes,
absolutely sparkling eyes he had.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.040
You could see he could feel the vibrations
and the cool breeze.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:05.040
And then you learn further steps
how to organize it, how to maneuver it,

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.320
how to manage it.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.240
So you have to be connected
with the mains.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.480
You have to become divine.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:18.000
Not that you are not, you are;
but you are not aware of it.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000
It is not in your conscious awareness,
it is not in your central nervous system.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.600
Whatever is in our central nervous system
is our achievement in our evolution.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.640
And you have to attain a little more step
and you become that.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.360
Like a triggering into the space
has to take place.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:46.000
This has to happen, and this will happen,
that thousands of you are to be saved.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.680
In some countries it has worked wonders,
especially in a country like Australia,

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:57.911
imagine. You had banished them, sent them
away as criminals or whatever they were –

00:31:57.911 --> 00:32:00.640
they had children, their grandchildren,
and their great-grandchildren

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.400
are great sahaja yogis.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:08.240
It’s spreading like fire,
the media is so sensitive, so sensible.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:14.800
While here I find there is no movement
in a country where I accepted,

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.400
and expected that it could be
a tremendous thing.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:26.160
Let’s see, let’s see, still I leave it
to you people to find out ways

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:31.600
and methods of cracking the brains here.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.920
Of course England was very difficult too,
for four years I was struggling

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.680
with seven people, no doubt.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:44.480
But English, once they are cracked,
they are very wise.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.800
And somehow or other
these seven people proved it so well,

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.240
and they found the change
because they were drug addicts,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:00.560
they had lots of troubles, and they were
about to collapse, some of them were

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.400
absolutely in a coma when they came to Me,
so the change, the tremendous change

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.280
in them convinced other people.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.280
And today we have very good
thousand sahaja yogis at least,

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.840
very good thousand sahaja yogis
who are experts, who are masters

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:22.800
in Kundalini Yoga in England.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.800
Now, as they have told you about all
these centers and all these things,

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.800
today I would like to give a little
introduction about it,

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.920
but later on I will tell you
how the key developments

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.720
in the human awareness started
and how later on the whole thing

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.080
was revealed.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:50.800
And today is the time when one can
talk about it so openly.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.400
I think you have given them the names
and everything of the chakras.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.840
But even knowing all about it,
is of no help.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.760
You must get your realization,
only knowing about them in a bookish way

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.520
is of no use.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:10.400
You must get your realization,
that is very important.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.720
In India very few people really bother
about these things,

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:19.920
because they know Kundalini awakening
is the only way, like sprouting of a seed.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.960
They know that Mother is the one
who is going to do it, second point,

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.240
because Adi Shankaracharya has seen
and this and that.

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.080
Third point they know that once
you get your realization

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.640
you become the Brahmin or the one
who knows the Brahma.

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.800
So in a village I have no problem.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.600
Thousands of people, if they come
to know that Mother is coming,

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.000
there could be six thousand people
in a village.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
All will gather from all over
and they will get their realization

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:53.360
so quick, I mean, so fast,
just like an American fast jet.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.280
Real fast they do it.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.560
In such an American way,
that you can’t imagine that it’s like a jet.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:08.160
And all of them getting, and such a wave
of beautiful Chatanya Lahari,

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:15.440
these vibrations, cool breeze blowing,
just like the waves of the sea or an ocean,

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.720
it’s beautiful to see that many.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.800
I mean, coming to America
some Indians were criticizing:

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.120
“Why should You go to America?
Why not do it here?

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.560
In one day You give realization
to six thousand people.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.560
There one day You might get one
and he’ll also slip out”.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.520
And they were criticizing My coming
to America.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.520
That not in a bad way, but in a good way,
that “It’s better that You spend

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.320
Your time in India”.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.840
But here are the real seekers.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.280
They get it in India
because they are too simple;

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.880
they are so innocent.
They have no problems.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:03.280
Here are the real seekers who are like,
we can say, the people in a war front,

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.640
who do espionage, or something like that,
a very serious type of work,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:13.760
get complicated, get involved,
caught up by the enemies,

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.560
and tortured by the enemies,
which are so dearer.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.240
Those are the heroes,
and they must be saved.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.160
That’s how I am here.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:30.320
And I know that once Americans take it up
we can save the whole world.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.680
It’s very simple to understand.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:40.240
But the way so far you have been
taking up to people is so amazingly foolish

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.600
that people think that you
would never take to Me,

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.520
because I am too sane,
I am too sensible,

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:54.560
and they still are very diffident
about My work in New York especially.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.400
But to see you all here today,
I am overjoyed.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.400
I have great faith in you, you have
no idea how much faith I have.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:11.920
You are born in that special chakra,
which is the chakra of Shri Krishna.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:17.040
Is the chakra of the Primordial Being,
is the chakra from where

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.000
the collectivity is first.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.480
But we have tried everything to ruin it.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.640
First of all it is ruined by smoking.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:33.917
Smoke, Christ may tolerate a little bit
at that point, but not Shri Krishna,

00:37:33.917 --> 00:37:37.440
He can’t tolerate smoke.
He just can’t bear it.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.520
And we have been smoking; thank God
I have heard that smoking is going down,

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.520
that spoils this center.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:51.280
Then, on the right side, when we talk big,
egoistical, when we try to push down people,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.080
specially when we try to dominate,
say within husband and wife,

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.600
which we see all the time if there’s
a quarrel going on,

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.600
your chakra will be ruined completely
on the right side.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.360
Left side is another problem
that comes from feeling guilty.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.560
And which is also very common.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.760
So these three centers that are the most
important thing and the most powerful

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:20.080
in you people here, see how this is
attacked.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:27.040
Moreover the mantras and all that
which are not awakened by a realized soul,

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.240
by a holy person,
can also ruin your left…

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.800
Is very common with the people
who have done mantras, and chakra,

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.760
and all of those things
without any authority.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:45.840
Because the whole thing comes up here,
just, and when you take the responsibility

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:52.400
of such things on your back, say you take
on your shoulders the responsibility

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.840
of wrong type of people, you can imagine,
what would be the shape and condition

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:03.920
of that wonderful center which was created
in a human being when he raised his head

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.240
from animal stage to look forward.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.040
Is a special thing that happened to us
when we raised our head like that,

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:17.040
that within us these two centers,
these two things like, ego and superego,

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.400
started developing.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.080
We had superego alright,
but the ego started developing

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.640
when we just raised our head from
animal stage to this stage.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:31.920
But we do not know that if you raise
your head too much backwards like this,

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.640
it can be spoilt. That means the ego
goes too much … then your head

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.280
goes down like that.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.440
Such people never put down their heads
you see.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.760
If you see somebody walking like this,
find out: he must be something big

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.200
somewhere, or aware that he is a very
big man.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:55.200
So the center that is the Vishuddhi
chakra is this America.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:01.440
And you are the people who are the cells
of that chakra which can be awakened.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.040
You are the cells and you are
to be awakened.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.600
Once you are awakened you can cure
this center and the whole universe

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.520
will be benefited by that.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.000
That’s why I request you to understand
your position in the whole cosmos,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.280
of the universe, and the important
and the pivotal position that you have,

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.800
and the wider role that you have to play,
so that you pay attention to yourself,

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:33.280
your development, your growth,
and you achieve your full maturity

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.960
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.240
May God bless you all.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:43.280
I would like to have some questions today,
and then after that we can have

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:59.680
the realization. Can you open the window?

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.080
Yes. Tomorrow, as he is saying that
many of them have had no idea

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.560
about the chakras and all that,
because they have come

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.920
for the first time today,

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.200
but tomorrow I am going to tell you
all about chakras and all that.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.840
Everything I’ll go gradually
one by one.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.160
Now I’ll be here for five lectures,
and I will see that in every lecture

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:37.840
I’ll try to do step-by-step,
across the thing. And I will explain you.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.480
And also put them somewhere
for advertising.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.440
And moreover there is a book,
you can read that,

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.400
but do not try to remember everything
by heart.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.480
It will be all your own,
the whole knowledge will be your own,

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.000
it won’t be difficult.
So it’s not to be studied,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.040
but it’s to be felt.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.120
I will definitely tell you all about
chakras, and I’ll make you masters.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.360
I’m going to make you gurus,
every one of them. Real gurus.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.880
There’s one fellow in India,
who’s got his realization,

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.160
and he’s given realization to,
as far as I know, ten thousand –

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.907
but some people, twenty thousand –
they say they are twenty thousand people

00:42:21.907 --> 00:42:26.160
he has given realization.
So it’s possible.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.160
Yes, please?

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.880
Mother, I do not mean to be funny,
but I felt a cool breeze

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.320
for quite some time.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.120
You are not funny! You are very good,
you have got it!

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.800
But I cannot tell that
whether it was the wind! (Laughter)

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.520
It happens with everyone, because
we’ve opened it just now, alright?

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.680
There is no wind here,
you can see that nothing is moving.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:58.240
Otherwise these things will be moving.
Yes, it’s alright, you got it very well.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.480
That is a thing I knew
you are going to get it. Alright?

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.920
So nothing to be funny,
is the absolute truth.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.760
There was a scientist we had,
he was from Orissa.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:14.160
And he got his realization.
Then he looked at all the windows,

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.680
and I was just smiling.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.396
Then he looked at his…
he turned like this,

00:43:18.396 --> 00:43:21.360
and then he had more from Me,
he couldn’t believe it.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:26.320
Then he went home,
he shut himself in a cellar,

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.360
there he put, what you call, a candle.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.240
And then he put his hands to the candle
and the candle started giving him

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.040
cool breeze!

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.400
He couldn’t believe it, he thought
there’s something gone wrong with him.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.920
And now today he is
a very great sahaja yogi. Alright?

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.280
So the first step has started,
that proves one thing beyond doubt,

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:49.520
that you are a great seeker. Alright?
My congratulations.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:44:05.280
He has feelings for his family
and friends,

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:09.160
but he has been seeking
for a love relationship with a woman

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:09.514
without any success,

00:44:09.514 --> 00:44:21.760
which is causing him a lot of pain,
and he does not know what to do.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.480
See, I’ll tell you what happens.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.920
You have got a center here
is of the Nabhi, alright?

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.800
Now out of this, is the left Nabhi here.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:36.960
If it is in a problem, left Nabhi
is the center of Gruha Lakshmi.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:42.320
Is the center of the Goddess
in the household, or your wife, see.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:47.360
Of course these days you don’t find
Goddesses as wives, but still! (Laughter)

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:52.240
So, if that goes out, you see,
then lots of problems also can come up,

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.760
but one of them is
that you get such a situation.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:01.680
But all such situations can be overcome,
all kinds of situations:

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.560
people who have had perverted
relationships also get sorted out,

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:14.480
those who have had, what you call,
the problems of divorce

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.920
and sort of a relationship with a woman
and they are frightened of women,

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.400
or the women who are dominating
or they don’t know how to stop their

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.400
domination – they don’t want to dominate
but they somehow dominate –

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.360
all these things will be sorted out.
No problem.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.640
Next year you will be married
very nicely. Alright?

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.720
We had sixteen marriages
(laughter, Shri Mataji laughs)

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.640
recently in England.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.760
One of them was Warren, who was married.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:49.120
And he is a divorcee, and he had given up
hopes of marriage.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:54.560
We had sixteen marriages
the day of Krishna’s birthday.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.240
So don’t you worry.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:01.040
But you have to follow
certain understanding of maintaining

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:06.080
yourself in a position, see,
and I’ll tell you all about it,

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.200
how to do it.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:12.960
And you will have very good marriages,
lasting marriages, not only that;

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.320
but you’ll have realized souls
as your children.

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.480
There are many who want to be born.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:25.280
And all the sahaja yogis who are married
now have got realized souls as children.

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:32.000
Because they want to be born,
they want parents who understand them,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.840
who can bear them, who can look after them,
and love them.

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.120
So you will have everything fine,
don’t you worry.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:48.320
And a very nice wife too. Alright? Yes?

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:58.240
There are subconscious impurities.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.960
I am happy that you have reached
the right conclusion.

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.120
Don’t you worry, I know how
to look after them.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.160
That’s all I’ll say.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.040
And I will teach you how to do it
for others also.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:12.800
You will become Saint Michael
in this respect. Alright?

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.640
And we’ll have to drive them out,
all the subconscious impurities.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:22.560
I think we have got our book here,
of the Advent.

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:29.200
Alright. In that it is, see, Gregoire,
the one who has written the book,

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.200
has called them as UPI, I don’t know
what it means (laughs) but he calls them

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.760
as UPI, and there are so many methods
by which we can drive them out. Eh?

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:44.505
What is it?
Units of Psychic Interference.

00:47:44.505 --> 00:47:47.280
Ah ok! (Shri Mataji laughs)
That’s all the invention. Don’t worry.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.120
You just don’t worry.
Not only yours, but others, you know.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.360
When you will go on the road, if they
know that you are passing that way,

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.160
they’ll all disappear.
You become so powerful.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.200
Now will you forget them?

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:08.640
Forget it, forget your past.
Forget it, that is subconscious,

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.240
just forget it.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:15.120
Do you know that all the sins
and blasphemy is to be forgiven,

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:19.920
and it’s been already promised?
Because you are saints!

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.240
So don’t count them at all, forget it.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.480
You see, when you wash the clothes,
say in a washing machine,

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:32.520
will you count all the stains?
It’s like that.

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.640
Kundalini washes you up
and cleanses you completely.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:40.160
It’s your own Kundalini, it is pure,
holy, your own Mother.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:45.960
She’ll wash it up, don’t you worry.
Alright?

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.800
Yes.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.080
It’s too much to believe, is it?
(Laughs, laughter) it is so.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:57.120
Because you don’t know what you are,
you are fantastic.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:02.720
What worries you? What is worrying you?

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.000
She thinks she has taken somebody
into her house who is not good,

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.680
and she thinks she is becoming
not good as a result of that.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.360
See, there are solutions
for that kind of thing.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:30.320
If he is really a sinister fellow,
he’ll run away. Alright.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.200
Or in case he is capable of improvement,
he’ll improve.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.907
So you become more powerful than them.
You see?

00:49:38.907 --> 00:49:42.960
Is what is more powerful is the point.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:50.320
If the light is more powerful,
the darkness has to run away. Alright?

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:55.680
So because you still do not know
your powers, and to maneuver it,

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:59.200
that’s why you are worrying.
But once you know it’s very simple.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:04.080
Once you are realized I will tell you
how to use it, and you’ll be amazed.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.200
Like yesterday I was coming,
and suddenly I had to go,

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.600
and there was no seat available
in the plane, and so my husband told Me,

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.160
“I’m sorry, there’s no seat
available for you”,

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.400
and suddenly he said: “Oh, it’s
a miraculous thing, they have said

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.720
there’s some seat”.
I said: “Alright, book Me there”.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.160
And two others were coming with me.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:25.120
– See, this is absolutely a material life,
absolutely a material level, isn’t it? –

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:29.280
And two others were coming,
there was no seat at any cost.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.280
And two people who had booked
for one month before, ahead, dropped out

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.320
and these two were with Me
in the airplane.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:41.120
So even at a very, very material level
they help you.

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.280
And spiritual level I need not tell you.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.920
Even at the very baser material level
they help you,

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:53.588
because this Lakshmi tattwa is here
which helps you for the well-being.

00:50:53.588 --> 00:50:56.080
Krishna has said:
Yogakshema Vahamyam,

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.360
I’ll look after your Yoga first,
Yoga means the union,

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:05.360
first you must get your union,
and then the well-being, Kshema.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:10.160
In America we have got the Kshema first,
the well-being, the Yoga is missing.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.240
(She smiles, laughter)

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.080
I wanted to ask a question to Mother.

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:18.720
Yes, please.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.120
First I would like to say that
You were an inspiration…

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:24.720
What is it?
You are an inspiration to him, Mother.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.680
Ah?
You are an inspiration to him.

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.160
Oh, I see. May God bless you.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.360
I am sure all of us have hundreds
of questions that would keep You here

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:37.120
the whole night, but I would like to say
that I would like to become

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:40.880
a realized being and give the answers
from within.

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:47.360
So my question is: after the five
lectures, and You leave us,

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.800
where do we go from there?

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:53.200
I know, everybody feels sad (laughter).

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:57.680
Because you are like small children,
you know. But you grow so fast.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:05.680
That you are amazed, you see. You grow.
You grow very fast. You’ll all grow.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.080
I’m not going to leave you.

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:12.480
I’m going to come back again and again,
and you are all going to come to India,

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:21.600
and we are all going to have
a very nice time (laughter).

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:34.720
We all belong to each other:
how can we leave you? Now.

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:38.000
Is it alright, or any other question?

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.080
Even if you have any personal questions
or anything you can write to Me, alright?

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.320
If you don’t want to discuss it here.

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:53.520
And tomorrow morning if they can come
to the hotel – at the hotel you can come,

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:59.259
I can work it out for you if you have
any personal problems or anything,

00:52:59.259 --> 00:52:59.600
we’ll work it out, alright?

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:11.600
I’m here for a complete 24-hours
in the hotel.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.960
You can ask a question
and you get the answer.

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.640
Yes.
And how do you read that, how do you know…

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:30.320
See, what happens, now say for example
you are connected to a mains. Alright?

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:35.120
Now the mains is an unconsciousness
was so far, it has become a consciousness

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:39.440
within you. You are like a computer
I would say, to make things easy.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.960
It’s a mystery again.

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:45.040
So you put your hands
and ask a question: “Mother, is there God?”.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.200
Just see vibrations. Right?
“Mother, is there God?”.

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.200
And three times if you ask,
you get tremendous vibrations,

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:58.069
already must have started. You see, so,
that’s how you will know.

00:53:58.069 --> 00:54:02.720
But if you ask about somebody
who is not a real guru,

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:07.200
who is not a real person,
then you might even get burning.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:13.040
Sometimes you might even get blisters.
You may lose your vibrations.

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.520
The more you grow
the more you become sensitive,

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.400
and you start understanding where you are.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.520
Can you also ask practical questions
about your life?

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:27.040
Yes, yes, you will. In the beginning
everybody asks: should I buy this?

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:30.480
Or that? (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs).
Then the questions start becoming

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.240
subtler and subtler,
because your priorities change.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:38.080
Whatever level you are,
you start asking questions.

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.200
Then no questions, at a stage
which we call…

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:46.320
first you get thoughtless awareness,
as your… first you get thoughtless awareness.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.920
In Sanskrit, it is called
as “nirvichar samadhi”.

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:58.640
Sama-dhi: “Dhi” means your consciousness,
and sama-dhi is the one which is enlightened.

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:03.360
So, the thoughtless enlightened
awareness first.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:09.200
Then the second state is –
which you have to establish –

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:14.400
is called as Nirvikalpa samadhi,
meaning doubtless awareness.

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.600
It is a state; it is not:
“I have no doubts about Mother,

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.800
I have no doubts about Sahaja Yoga”,
is not that.

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:25.760
And that state is achieved, and at both
the states when you are say

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:33.440
thoughtlessly aware state, you can give
awakening, you can give realization,

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:37.600
you can cure cancer, you can cure
all kinds of diseases,

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.200
so many things you can do
with the first shot.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.080
But much do not indulge in that too much.

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:49.680
You can give realization at the most,
and then you should jump onto the second stage

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.000
where you become Nirvikalpa.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Means where you are doubtlessly aware.
Doubtlessly enlightened awareness.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.280
Then you become that.

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:05.920
At that stage you don’t start catching
from others, such sort of thing;

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:11.200
you see, you may feel “This is the finger
catching there”, but you don’t get involved.

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:17.808
It’s a state, it’s a state,
in which you mature, which happens to you.

00:56:17.808 --> 00:56:19.840
Many people, and will happen to all
of you, there’s no problem about it.

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.760
But some people do it faster,
some take time, but it happens to all of you.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:29.280
It’s a happening again, maturity.
Alright?

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:42.960
If a person has never been interested
and has never come, can this person be influenced?

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.760
Who is not interested?
Yes.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:50.960
Forget it. Let them get lost,
that’s what they are, they are not

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:55.040
interested in their own Spirit,
now what am I to do, should I break My head?

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.200
You have to ask for it.

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:01.920
You see, God has given you freedom,
this is the problem.

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.520
You have the freedom, if you want
to go to hell you can go directly.

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.880
Take two running jumps and go.

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:12.720
But if you want to have realization,
you can get it. Alright?

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:16.480
But if you don’t want it,
don’t force them, please don’t,

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.520
you cannot force it.
You cannot force it.

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:23.200
I can cook food for you, all right?
I can put it in your mouth.

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.280
But the enjoyment of eating it,
has to come within yourself;

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:31.600
you don’t want to enjoy anything,
what are we to do? You can’t force it.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.640
In the beginning only the seekers
are important.

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.720
They need not be your brothers, sisters,
mothers, fathers, they need not be anything.

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.440
Seekers are important,
pay attention to seekers.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.200
They are to be saved, alright?
Once the seekers come up,

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.800
then these second class citizens
will start coming up, you see?

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:53.200
Let us see to the first class citizens
in the Kingdom of God,

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:56.160
then we’ll bother about the second
and the third and the fourth.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:00.320
But don’t waste your energy on somebody
who is not convinced.

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.240
You cannot convince him by your brain,
you cannot.

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:08.160
You see, they are very obstinate people.

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:12.960
I’ve told many-a-times, but still you see
we are involved with the other people

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.640
and we try to convince, and – today only
I received a letter saying,

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.520
“Please, give Realization to mother,
she’s very adamant.

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.960
Give Realization to my father,
he doesn’t want to listen to me,

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:27.360
give Realization to my sister,
she doesn’t believe in it”,

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:31.200
all sorts of things, you see. I said:
“All right, all right”.

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:35.520
So, don’t be concerned,
have no sympathies of this kind.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:39.600
Sympathy: “Sym” means to share,
and “pathy” is the “pathos”.

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:45.520
So don’t try to share the pathos, alright?
Have no such sympathies.

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.760
Only seekers look after the seekers.
And: “Sorry, you are not a seeker”.

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.280
I also tell them you go away.

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:55.200
You see, there are people who will
come and say, “Mother, I once have

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:59.600
gone to the races and I lost”. I say,
“Now you get lost, you go away”.

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:03.600
You see, you can’t give anything
to such people, who are on that gross level.

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.640
Let them be.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:09.680
But first of all let us enlighten those
who are capable of enlightenment.

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.200
They are more important.

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.400
And not those who are just
with very great difficulty are pushed

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:19.520
into it and go back as if pushed
by a piston, you see, better not have them.

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:23.760
All right?
So, don’t you worry on such people.

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:32.240
Of course you feel concerned, no doubt,
but forget it, the seekers are too many

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:48.992
and we have to look after them.

00:59:48.992 --> 00:59:50.240
Yes, My child?
Can people who are really seeking attain it?

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.880
No, if they want to have it,
you can do it, you see?

00:59:52.880 --> 01:00:00.560
Even people who are declared
as greatest… you see, got Realization.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.120
Imagine, the other day – imagine –
archbishop of black magic

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:10.160
got Realization. Can you believe it?
Archbishop of black magic.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.920
He got Realization. Of course I told
people, “Now don’t try all these tricks

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:18.000
with such people because see, they will
try to tempt even you”. So, we are

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.760
treating him separately. But the person
who is supposed to be the archbishop

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:27.200
of black magic. I mean, witchcraft.
He got Realization. So anybody can get it.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.600
But if they do not ask it,
you cannot force them,

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.600
you cannot argue it out,
you cannot tell them:

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.520
‘You must get your realization’,
nothing of the kind.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.640
If they think they are very wise
let them be alone,

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:43.200
don't waste your energy. Instead
you can give to ten people who want it.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:43.920
Alright?

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.840
So just find out who is a seeker,
also from vibrations you can find out.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.360
Those who are seekers
will get their awakening very fast.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:56.240
She says this man is a smoker…
Who is a smoker?

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.800
This man she is speaking of.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:05.040
But he would like to have a Realization?
Oh, smoking is nothing,

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.440
even if he is a chimney (laughter)
he can get that.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.760
If he is a seeker, he has to be seeker,
the first primary consideration is

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.200
that he should be a seeker. It’s nothing,
I mean, smoking, everybody smokes,

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.320
we find nothing but this smoke
in this world, what to do.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.040
But doesn’t matter, I mean,
it’s not such a sin.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.640
Nothing is a sin in the presence
of the Ocean of love. Is it?

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:35.520
What is a sin? Nothing.
So it’s not so important. Smoking at least.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:43.262
Fixation, is that a sin?
He is saying, is fixation a sin?

01:01:43.262 --> 01:01:47.040
It’s not a sin, according to Me
nothing is sin now. Forget it.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:56.080
I mean, fixation, I would say,
will only drop out through Kundalini

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.000
awakening, and awareness,
and alertness.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.920
All fixations can be dropped out,
misidentifications can be dropped out,

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.680
because you become a different person.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.800
Like, say, a caterpillar
becomes a butterfly, alright?

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.911
Now, there must be the part of that
cocoon sticking on to the butterfly,

01:02:15.911 --> 01:02:19.120
must be. So you don’t like it,
you want to throw it away, just falls off,

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.200
because it’s all broken out.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.880
Like an egg-shell becoming,
egg becoming a, say a bird.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:31.640
And the shell is still sticking on
somewhere, so the bird doesn’t like it,

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.400
he throws around. It’s like that.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.680
It’s transformation and transmutation.
Both things take place.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.240
First the transformation which is easier,
you got it just now;

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:48.680
but the transmutation you have to work
it out a little bit, and they drop out.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.120
Little bit power helps you.
And you want to do it,

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.480
you don’t want to have them.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:03:02.466
Because supposing I have a fixation with,
say, a spirit. We’ll catch on this,

01:03:02.466 --> 01:03:05.351
we’ll catch on this, we’ll get a headache.
Normally you won’t get a headache

01:03:05.351 --> 01:03:09.360
till you become mad, you see?
But after realization you start getting.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.640
Like a lady who had liver trouble.
She came to Me, she said:

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.320
“Mother, my head has gone absolutely
heavy now, what am I to do?”.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.560
I said: “You have a liver,
you get it cured.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:30.960
If you don’t get your liver cured,
you’ll have this trouble”.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.379
So she tried her best to get it, and
you can get it cured just like that

01:03:33.379 --> 01:03:35.320
with Sahaja Yoga. It’s very simple.
And she got alright.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.240
So fixations also drop out.&nbsp;

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.020
It’s all ignorance:

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:40.720
we will not call it sin
but it’s ignorance.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:47.440
I was warned that Kundalini caused
problems and one can end up in hospital.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.680
Very true, very true, you see.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:58.080
Now what she says is true
and I know that.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.400
Because it’s not Kundalini
that takes place.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.120
See, Kundalini is your holy Mother.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.280
And not only holy Mother, but she’s the
only Mother you have and you are

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.960
the only child She has.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.960
And she’s not going to give you
this trouble, but these people who do not

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.440
know the job at all, who are not
authorized, they are extremely unholy

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:25.600
people, they are people who should be
in hell, and are trying to do these things,

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.600
and they make you suffer.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:33.200
For example, when you try to excite
the Kundalini by any method like that,

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.000
actually you either move to the left
or to the right.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.160
They push you to the left or to the right.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:43.600
And if you move to the left you can
become mad, and if you push to the right

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:50.960
you become stupid.
So accept one or the other. (laughs)

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.720
You can’t take them up there, you see?
It cannot be reached.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.640
Even they say Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha
cannot reach Ganesha, who informs

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:02.960
the Kundalini to rise. So, you can
imagine. These horrible people,

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:08.480
just to make money, are telling you
stories and they put you in the lunatic asylum.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.840
Not only, I have seen people coming,
who went for flying.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.000
They paid three thousand pounds to fly.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.440
I mean, they must have some brains
to understand: why are you flying?

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.640
Are you going to become birds now?
Make your guru fly!

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.800
I said, why not put them, put him from
this Leaning Tower of Pisa,

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.600
and see where does he fly,
upward or downward? (Laughter)

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.040
You see, when he’ll go down,
then you will see that this is the thing

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.760
he’s doing, and then you are paying
three thousand pounds.

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:39.120
On top of that what you get
is an epilepsy.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:45.200
They are all suffering from epilepsy,
you know? It’s true, it happens, I know.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.640
But this is your Mother.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:53.360
She just gives you your realization,
that’s all. I have never seen one person

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:58.640
getting mad, on the contrary mad
get well with it. How can it be?

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:07.200
You are going to become a Spirit,
on your way to that how can you become mad?

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:12.080
I mean, supposing you are going to Heaven,
and on the way you meet there at station

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:16.960
some lunatic asylums? How can you
become mad? We should use our brains

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:20.000
to see these are horrid people,
I agree with you.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.720
They are using all kinds of dirty methods,
I know.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:28.080
Specially sex. How can you use sex
for your Kundalini?

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:34.720
Because that’s your Mother.
How can you do it? All absurd ideas.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:44.080
If sex is so important all animals
should be realized souls by now.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.000
Not that you have to abhor sex, you have
to lead a sane married life,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.040
and lead a very decent life and all that,
that’s the key to it;

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.800
but not this kind of a thing that you
can raise Kundalini through sex,

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:59.680
it’s all filthy, all bathroom culture
I think, the way these people talk about.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:10.000
Absurd! So filthy you can’t imagine.
It’s filth. I mean, there should be something,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.560
our sex is private, isn’t it?
We call it as private.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:18.000
But how do we handle them –
with these horrible gurus

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.160
and one of them has come down and settled
here in your country.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:32.720
His Vishuddhi’s gone off now.
I’m happy about it.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:45.600
He feels a very nice presence. He’s
asking You if there is any initiation.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:54.320
I’ve already done it, I think (laughter).
I really don’t do anything to be frank.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:08:01.440
If you ask the sun: “Do you take
the color of the leaves?”. He’ll say: “No”.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.320
Because that is his nature.
This is just the case. It just flows.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.160
I really don’t do anything.
Am I doing anything? I’m just talking.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:15.360
But it works, it works,
it works by itself.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:20.640
Because you are a deserving case.
That’s why it is acting.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:36.640
I don’t have to do anything. Alright?
Now. You said it was the last question now.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.640
He asked twenty the other time, so…

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:48.240
Yesterday I told the nice Australian
doctor that I was a traditional minister.

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.160
Tradition?
He is a traditional minister.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.000
He’s a Baptist minister.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.400
Ah! Then you should really become
a Baptist, I’ll make you a real Baptist.

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:04.640
How can I relate Self-realization
to the scriptures?

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.640
I mean, what am I telling you,
everything that is scriptured

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.480
but in the real sense.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.760
For me it will be more difficult
than for others…

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:25.280
You see, they will see your powers.
Alright?

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:30.480
It’s better to tell them and save them
than to allow them to be drowned.

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:35.120
Under the name of Christ and God,
one cannot do like that.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.480
We cannot do like that anymore,
it’s all done, I’m so happy

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.720
you could come here and you could achieve
it, you’ll save so many of them.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:47.520
You face the truth, it is so.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.912
But I will tell you some questions
when you’ll ask, then you be sure

01:09:51.912 --> 01:09:53.120
you are doing that.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:10:09.920
Alright now, any more questions?
Or are you all enjoying the cool breeze?

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:30.160
[Inaudible]
Why did you open?

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.560
What do you say, sorry,
I didn’t talk about it.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.160
Yes, you did, when you were talking
about the Christian gnostics.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:51.840
Oh, I said that the wind of the Holy
Spirit is often referred to by the gnostics

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.120
as the Holy Breath. That’s all.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.040
Ruh, yes, Ruh, means Ruh.
Ruh. And I gave its different names.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.400
But what happened to the disciples
of Christ, you see, is a problem

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:10.080
I don’t want to raise controversy.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:15.760
What happened to them is a little
controversial subject which I will tell you

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.440
later on. All right? Just now you get
your Realization, mature.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.240
Because, you see, today you are learning
Christianity. All right?

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:30.720
So you have problems of Christianity.
Those who are studying, say, Hindu religion,

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:35.680
they have problems from Hindu religion.
Because it is misinterpreted also

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:43.360
many-a-times, isn’t it? The one who has
misinterpreted does not know that he’s

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.640
misinterpreted. And only through your
vibratory awareness you should find out

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:54.560
the absolute truth. Like when I told
people that Christ’s Mother was

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.040
the Holy Spirit, they would not accept it.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.320
In India they said: “What did She do?
She just used to cry and weep,

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.120
but the Holy Spirit is supposed
to give Realization to people,

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.960
She didn’t give Realization to anyone”.
But She was.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.120
So how do you find out? You put your
hands towards Me and ask the question:

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:17.280
“Mother, was She the Holy Spirit?”.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.000
Then why didn’t Christ say that
She was the Holy Spirit?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.720
The question comes in. It’s with Him,
absolutely one can understand

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.120
that She was the Mother of Christ.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.440
And Christ has got eleven destructive
powers, with which He’s going to come back.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:35.200
Eleven destructive powers He’s got.
About which Bible says nothing,

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:40.880
because Christ could not talk to His
disciples who were just fishermen.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.400
And they never believed Him.
Till they saw His resurrection

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.720
they never believed Him.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:53.760
So, His eleven powers that He had,
He could have destroyed the whole world

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:57.440
at that time of His crucifixion,
but crucifixion had to be done

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:02.160
with a special purpose, which I’ll
tell you later on, why He was crucified.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:07.040
And He didn’t want to say that,
because if anybody would have tortured Her,

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:11.200
He would have used all His eleven powers
and the whole game would have been over.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.080
Alright? So it is a very subtle subject,
which you should understand but first

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:19.760
you must become subtler.
Then you will understand each and

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.640
everything very nicely on the Kundalini.
For example, I say the Christ is placed here,

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.280
on this point. That He is to be
awakened here.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.680
When He is awakened, then only the ego
and superego both are sucked in.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:36.880
That’s how your sins
and your sufferings He takes over.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:41.680
Now, if I say so, why should you believe
in it? Isn't it? But what can happen

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.960
that when we raise the Kundalini,
yourself when you will be a realized soul

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.640
you’ll see, the Kundalini may stop here.
Then you have to take Christ’s name.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.800
You have to awaken Him.
If you are a Realized soul only,

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.480
otherwise you cannot.
Then you’ll find the Kundalini will rise.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.760
Or you have to say Lord’s Prayer,
then only the Kundalini will rise.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.800
But only a realized soul can do it.
Anybody says Lord’s Prayer is a waste.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.360
Is a waste. Is not connected. Alright?
So it’s a very subtle subject,

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.320
you be honest about itself,
you become that, and then you’ll start

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:15.760
seeing everything clearly.

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.120
As I said that this room is dark,
you can’t see anything,

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.400
so best thing is to open your eyes
properly, get the lights on

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.280
and see for yourself. All right?

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:30.000
Because if I say something, it may
create the situation of a doubting Thomas,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.320
which I don’t want to have.
First mature yourself, alright?

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.000
You must mature all of you.
Is a good question you asked,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.080
but that’s little further.
One need not hang on to anything.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.440
Just see for yourself what it is,
you must see for yourself.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:54.106
Keep yourself open.

01:14:54.106 --> 01:14:57.199
Is true, what he said is true,
it’s called as Ruh.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:05.600
Is the cool wind of the Holy Spirit
and I don’t know if his book is published

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.440
or not, of Adi Shankaracharya,
he’s written a big book about it,

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.840
Chaitanya Lahari and all that,
he’s written it.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.920
But most of their books
are not translated, what to do?

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:22.320
I mean, it’s such a big book
on this cool breeze.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.640
Of course this knowledge of how to use it,
and how, what fingers are there,

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.560
is not yet there, because that was not
the time to be given perhaps.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:36.320
But all the teachings I’ll be giving you,
and you can verify.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.600
You can verify everything.
So you must verify.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.360
But don’t waste too much time
in these things, first of all you mature.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.160
And gradually you will start
seeing yourself.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:56.480
First thing should be that you mature.
That is first thing and important.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:02.000
See, she got Realization two days back,
I mean, how many days? Four, five days back.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.400
And she can feel everybody’s chakras,
she can raise the Kundalini, she can do it.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.240
So just do that, first start doing it.
First become that.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:15.840
Then you will start understanding
this is not important. Is not important.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:22.560
What is important is to understand
Christ where He is, how we can awaken Him,

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.000
all these things are more important.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:39.520
We should have it?
All right. Agnya is there.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:45.920
Now, those who think, please,
this center of Christ itself is catching.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:50.320
Put your hands towards Me and say that:
“Mother, I forgive everyone”.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:17:31.193
(People repeat). Again (People repeat).
Again (People repeat). Still there.

01:17:31.193 --> 01:18:06.960
Should we say Lord’s Prayer.
(People recite Lord’s Prayer)

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:18.000
Now see is it coming?
Put your hands straight. Here, this side.

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:44.440
You are alright? Are you feeling?
It’s there?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.720
Keep yourself steady.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.240
No body movement is needed.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.640
Just keep yourself steady,
the Kundalini is inside,

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:10.240
She rises by herself,
don’t do any body movements

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.800
because that will spoil it.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:17.200
Just be steady, just keep your eyes shut,
if you don’t shut your eyes

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.000
also the Kundalini won’t rise above Agnya.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.160
You have to keep your eyes shut,
that’s important.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.520
Because you have to get it after all,
what is it?

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.640
You have to get it,
you are here to get it, that’s all.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:37.920
Please close your eyes.
You are here to get it,

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:48.480
that’s the main point, to receive it.

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:57.040
Now put your right hand on your heart.
Right hand on your heart.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.720
And say: “Mother, I am not guilty”.
Thrice, three times say:

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:04.880
“Mother, I’m not guilty”.
(people repeat)

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:22.320
Now ask a question:
“Mother, am I my own guru?”.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.840
(People repeat twice).
Again (people repeat).

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.360
Now ask a question:
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:49.040
(People repeat twice) Again.
(People repeat).

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:53.328
Now say: “Mother, please give me
realization”. (People repeat twice).

01:21:53.328 --> 01:21:53.353
Again (people repeat).
Ah.

01:21:53.353 --> 01:21:54.320
It’s there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.240
Now put your right hand
on top of your head

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.840
and you see a cool breeze coming out
of your fontanel bone area.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:22.000
On the head, on top of your, on top.
Just on top, see.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.280
There will be a cool breeze.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:27.440
Just move your hand and see that if…
little higher you keep your hand,

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.840
and see if there is a cool breeze
coming in.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:42.640
Maybe some people might get little hot;
some people will feel it in the hand,

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:45.680
some in the head, coming out.

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.200
Specially those who smoke do not feel it
in the hand in the beginning,

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.320
doesn’t matter.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:00.560
Put down your hands please again.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.440
Those who did not feel any cool breeze
raise your hand.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.840
You have to be honest about it,
you have to get it, alright?

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.320
Out of these who have not felt:
have you been to a guru?

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:32.560
Those who have not been to any guru
and have not felt it.

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:37.120
Those who have not been to any guru
and have not felt it.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:44.850
Not at all to any guru?
You are not reading any books? Alright.

01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:44.880
[Female seeker says something]

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:49.360
That spiritually stands even worse.
Alright, doesn’t matter. Alright, it’s alright.

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.120
Now put your hands like this.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:56.309
Now those who haven’t felt it
please keep your hands again.

01:23:56.309 --> 01:23:58.600
And sahaja yogis you can go
and look after them.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:03.360
Tracy, you need not. You give realization,
it’s alright.

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:09.040
Now, you haven’t felt cool breeze?
Alright. Good. Yes.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:16.240
Those who haven’t felt any cool breeze
raise your hands. You haven’t. Something.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:19.360
Alright, now put your hands like this,
don’t be upset.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:42.560
Everything is going to be alright, eh?
Got it, you’ve got it. Got it.

01:24:42.560 --> 01:25:04.080
Now see this gentleman, the other one,
just see. Are you? Feeling it?

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.000
Alright. So you are a branded seeker,
and you are sorted now.

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:12.960
See that gentleman,
you should ask the one… yes.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:20.231
Did you feel, My child? Did you?
Good, good.

01:25:20.231 --> 01:25:23.680
Dan, you also go and help now, see,
you just start practicing, all of you,

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.640
from New York. She’s got it.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.640
Alright, you’ve got it now, don’t doubt it.
Don’t think about it, she’s got it,

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:36.160
you got it very well, face has changed.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:43.840
What’s the matter, Steve? Left Nabhi?
Drugs. Alright, put your hand down here,

01:25:43.840 --> 01:26:03.280
on the left side, left side. Alright.
Ah, alright?

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.640
He has been to a guru in the past.
Really?

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:25.520
In the past.
Of course in the future he’s not going to go.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:34.240
He’ll run away (Shri Mataji laughs)
These people leave him, those see the book

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:38.160
they don’t even touch it. You see? Oh God!

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.480
See this lady here, she’s left-sided.
Just see.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.880
Let this gentleman work it out,
come along. Now you give realization.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:27:02.080
Alright, alright, come along, no,
it’s for you, no, no, come here.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:05.200
Now Gavin, let him see the wind coming
out of others.

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:10.480
Let him see from the head, let him see.
This gentleman. Now come along,

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:14.080
you help him. This is Mr. Gavin Brown,
from London. Alright?

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:19.440
Now we have imported them, next time
you have to come to London.

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:26.400
Now show him, how the cool breeze
is coming, raising the Kundalini,

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:31.920
ask him to raise it. Raise it also.

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:34.880
Now we are baptizing, really you are
a real baptist.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:39.280
Now ask him to raise it,
how to raise it also.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:42.160
You people can learn it also,
both of you, come along, you are very strong,

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:48.800
come along. Both of you come along,
get up and get your… raise it.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.960
Christine, just teach these two boys,
they are very good and strong.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:28:00.000
Now forget about your sins, so-called.
She’s there, go, she’ll tell them…

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.080
ah, alright?
One hand towards Me!

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.608
Now there is no window there,
just have a look!

01:28:06.608 --> 01:28:16.640
Show there’s no window in the head!
It’s there!

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:23.496
Take them, let them test everyone.
How are you now, are you better now? Today?

01:28:23.496 --> 01:28:23.572
Are you better? This is the cool breeze.
You help him. Forget about the past,

01:28:23.572 --> 01:28:23.635
and just help him. You are better now
but the Ekadasha is there.

01:28:23.635 --> 01:28:25.200
You are very hot still. Ekadasha Rudra…
How are you? Fine.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:29:05.371
You also got it? You haven’t got it?
Now, come along. Who is there? Hema?

01:29:05.371 --> 01:29:10.600
If you can come here. Gavin?
You just come and look at this.

01:29:30.636 --> 01:30:06.480
You feel? True!
Now. Come along, put your hand.

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:16.960
Put one hand…
Alright? This is the cool breeze.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:36.868
Yes, yes, you can feel it, all of you,
all of you can. You have to forgive!

01:30:36.868 --> 01:30:45.680
You have to forgive,
you have not forgiven really. Have you?

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:48.715
No you haven’t. Say now
“Mother I forgive” Again.

01:30:48.715 --> 01:31:04.160
“I must forgive, I have to forgive”.
Again. Ah, alright?

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:09.680
Now better? Alright?
See now, you’ve taken two,

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:13.680
you have not forgiven also!
Have you forgiven? No
