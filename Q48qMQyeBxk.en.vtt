00:07.300 --> 00:11.890
Now above that, is the, you see the third center.

00:11.976 --> 00:15.070
which is called as Nabhi, means the navel.

00:15.560 --> 00:19.770
This is the center of

00:20.420 --> 00:24.530
the way we absorb the virtues,

00:25.100 --> 00:28.330
or the virtues are enlightened.

00:28.530 --> 00:30.840
When this center is enlightened

00:30.940 --> 00:32.540
we really become righteous.

00:32.621 --> 00:35.729
We don’t have to tell,
“Now you don’t do this and don’t do that”.

00:35.810 --> 00:37.232
You just become.

00:37.313 --> 00:42.050
Like a saint, a real saint,
will not do wrong things.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.859
In the same way when a person
gets his Realization,

00:46.060 --> 00:51.870
by the virtue of this center,
he becomes absolutely balanced:

00:52.990 --> 00:56.699
balanced with his family life,
with his wife, with his children,

00:56.780 --> 00:59.420
balanced with the politics, economics,

00:59.620 --> 01:01.450
balanced with the society,

01:01.650 --> 01:04.860
balanced with all the people whom he knows;

01:05.060 --> 01:09.230
in a very balancing way he starts behaving.

01:09.430 --> 01:11.769
There’s not one-sided activity.

01:11.970 --> 01:15.413
For example, somebody may be
very much attached to the wife

01:15.700 --> 01:17.870
and may try to harm others.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.977
Somebody who is very much attached to others,

01:21.177 --> 01:22.491
may harm his wife.

01:22.692 --> 01:25.910
So a kind of a balance is established by this,

01:26.140 --> 01:28.620
and a person who gets this

01:28.820 --> 01:32.379
develops a personality which we call as regal.

01:32.580 --> 01:35.420
That sense of dignity comes into such a person.

01:35.630 --> 01:39.079
Now you see our children have lost the virtues,

01:39.280 --> 01:41.650
our children don’t have that regalty.

01:41.850 --> 01:43.965
They have become very cheapish also,

01:44.046 --> 01:46.713
and they run after materialism
and things like that;

01:46.914 --> 01:48.745
they fight for small, small things.

01:48.946 --> 01:51.810
It’s not only children, even
the grown-ups are like that

01:52.010 --> 01:54.010
and they try to waste their energy,

01:54.210 --> 01:56.670
fighting for something that is so useless.

01:56.870 --> 01:59.794
So by enlightenment of this center

01:59.995 --> 02:03.510
you understand the value of matter.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.090
And the value of matter is this:

02:06.291 --> 02:08.490
that it has aesthetics, first of all,

02:08.690 --> 02:13.360
and secondly, you can express
your love only through matter.

02:13.570 --> 02:16.490
If you love somebody
you’ll give them something,

02:16.690 --> 02:19.490
a little flower also can express your love.

02:19.690 --> 02:22.450
Anything can express your love through matter,

02:22.650 --> 02:24.730
and then you become a very generous

02:24.930 --> 02:27.260
and very enjoyable person.

02:27.341 --> 02:31.289
Some people feel that if you become
generous, you will be bankrupt.

02:31.370 --> 02:33.431
It’s not so. On the contrary,

02:33.512 --> 02:36.800
if you open one door, no air will come in,

02:37.030 --> 02:40.974
but if you open the other door,
all the air will start circulating.

02:41.175 --> 02:44.340
In the same way, when a person is generous

02:44.540 --> 02:46.921
he starts getting so many blessings

02:47.122 --> 02:50.602
- because he is also connected with the Divine -
that he is amazed.

02:50.683 --> 02:53.369
He doesn’t know what to do
with the things that he has got,

02:53.450 --> 02:55.419
and then he starts pouring it to others.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.988
There are so many things people
are telling Me about,

02:58.069 --> 03:01.120
miracles and miracles of even material things

03:01.201 --> 03:05.130
in their jobs, in their purchasing,
in their shopping,

03:05.211 --> 03:07.970
the way they have seen miracles happening

03:08.051 --> 03:10.260
that it is nothing but just

03:10.341 --> 03:13.420
that this center is enlightened.

03:13.501 --> 03:18.024
And with this center, within you
a righteousness comes in.

03:18.105 --> 03:22.279
And this righteousness
doesn’t force anybody else,

03:22.360 --> 03:27.544
it’s just righteousness itself
which doesn’t command anything

03:27.625 --> 03:29.337
or demand anything,

03:29.418 --> 03:32.535
but it becomes a respectable personality,

03:32.616 --> 03:36.099
and you just start really understanding

03:36.180 --> 03:37.489
that, “Look at this man”.

03:37.570 --> 03:40.502
Somebody was telling Me today
that in the office people asked,

03:40.583 --> 03:42.850
“How are you so dignified?”

03:42.931 --> 03:45.109
He said, “I didn’t know I was so dignified.”

03:45.190 --> 03:47.309
"No, you don’t do anything undignified,

03:47.390 --> 03:50.719
and you do everything just like a child also".

03:50.800 --> 03:53.819
So there’s a child-like dignity you develop,

03:53.900 --> 03:57.049
and it’s a beautiful thing to happen.
Really it’s angelic.
