00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.890
Now above that, is the, you see the third center.

00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:15.070
which is called as Nabhi, means the navel.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.770
This is the center of

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.530
the way we absorb the virtues,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.330
or the virtues are enlightened.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.840
When this center is enlightened

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.540
we really become righteous.

00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:35.729
We don’t have to tell, 
“Now you don’t do this and don’t do that”.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.232
You just become.

00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:42.050
Like a saint, a real saint, 
will not do wrong things.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.859
In the same way when a person 
gets his Realization,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.870
by the virtue of this center, 
he becomes absolutely balanced:

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.699
balanced with his family life, 
with his wife, with his children,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.420
balanced with the politics, economics,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.450
balanced with the society,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.860
balanced with all the people whom he knows;

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.230
in a very balancing way he starts behaving.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.769
There’s not one-sided activity.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.413
For example, somebody may be 
very much attached to the wife

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.870
and may try to harm others.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.977
Somebody who is very much attached to others,

00:01:21.177 --> 00:01:22.491
may harm his wife.

00:01:22.692 --> 00:01:25.910
So a kind of a balance is established by this,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.620
and a person who gets this

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.379
develops a personality which we call as regal.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.420
That sense of dignity comes into such a person.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.079
Now you see our children have lost the virtues,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.650
our children don’t have that regalty.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.965
They have become very cheapish also,

00:01:44.046 --> 00:01:46.713
and they run after materialism 
and things like that;

00:01:46.914 --> 00:01:48.745
they fight for small, small things.

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:51.810
It’s not only children, even 
the grown-ups are like that

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.010
and they try to waste their energy,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.670
fighting for something that is so useless.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.794
So by enlightenment of this center

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:03.510
you understand the value of matter.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.090
And the value of matter is this:

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:08.490
that it has aesthetics, first of all,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.360
and secondly, you can express 
your love only through matter.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.490
If you love somebody 
you’ll give them something,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.490
a little flower also can express your love.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.450
Anything can express your love through matter,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.730
and then you become a very generous

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.260
and very enjoyable person.

00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:31.289
Some people feel that if you become 
generous, you will be bankrupt.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.431
It’s not so. On the contrary,

00:02:33.512 --> 00:02:36.800
if you open one door, no air will come in,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.974
but if you open the other door, 
all the air will start circulating.

00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:44.340
In the same way, when a person is generous

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.921
he starts getting so many blessings

00:02:47.122 --> 00:02:50.602
- because he is also connected with the Divine - 
that he is amazed.

00:02:50.683 --> 00:02:53.369
He doesn’t know what to do 
with the things that he has got,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.419
and then he starts pouring it to others.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.988
There are so many things people 
are telling Me about,

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.120
miracles and miracles of even material things

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:05.130
in their jobs, in their purchasing, 
in their shopping,

00:03:05.211 --> 00:03:07.970
the way they have seen miracles happening

00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:10.260
that it is nothing but just

00:03:10.341 --> 00:03:13.420
that this center is enlightened.

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:18.024
And with this center, within you 
a righteousness comes in.

00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:22.279
And this righteousness 
doesn’t force anybody else,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.544
it’s just righteousness itself 
which doesn’t command anything

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:29.337
or demand anything,

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:32.535
but it becomes a respectable personality,

00:03:32.616 --> 00:03:36.099
and you just start really understanding

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.489
that, “Look at this man”.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.502
Somebody was telling Me today 
that in the office people asked,

00:03:40.583 --> 00:03:42.850
“How are you so dignified?”

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.109
He said, “I didn’t know I was so dignified.”

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.309
"No, you don’t do anything undignified,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.719
and you do everything just like a child also".

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.819
So there’s a child-like dignity you develop,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.049
and it’s a beautiful thing to happen.
Really it’s angelic.
