00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.394
Why? Because it is a practice.

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:07.635
They don't read anything else

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.882
because as Mother says that after reading many religious books

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:13.862
they try to show their importance and don't do anything.

00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:15.408
Shree Mataji has come

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:20.602
and when She will come, you stand at your own place

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:24.936
and when Shree Mataji will sit , then you sit at your own place.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.105
From there only you offer your salutations and sit down.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.538
And if you have brought, any flowers or anything like that

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:33.872
and when the programme will be over

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:36.003
please do not touch Her Feet.

00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:38.770
Here the flowers that have been kept in front of Her

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:42.201
you offer your garland of flowers on that.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:43.326
That itself is enough.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.572
Every body tries that they should garland Her on the stage

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:48.298
Please be kind enough not to do so.

00:00:48.322 --> 00:00:52.236
Shree Mataji has come, please stand up all of you.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:04.361
Bolo Shree Bhagwati Mataji Shree Nirmala Devi ki Jai.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:27.190
Bolo Shree Adi Guru, Shree Adi Shakti  Mataji Shree Nirmala Devi Ki Jai.

00:01:27.214 --> 00:01:34.561
On behalf of all of you, i offer this small garland to Maa.

00:01:34.586 --> 00:04:28.400
Shree Mataji: Dhanyawaad

00:04:28.424 --> 00:04:33.648
In Sahajyoga when the Kundalini gets awakened

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:48.157
She one after the other (Pit it (fan) off, it is producing lot of sound)

00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:49.399
S Y: Close this, close this.

00:04:49.423 --> 00:05:01.599
Shree Mataji: It is too noisy. It is actually the noise of Air mill.

00:05:01.623 --> 00:05:07.489
So, one by one, crossing the chakras

00:05:07.513 --> 00:05:11.650
Kundalini moves upwards.

00:05:11.674 --> 00:05:14.712
This is the UDHVAGATI of Shree Krishna.

00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:25.583
The work Shree Krishna has done in His own time is very intricate.

00:05:25.607 --> 00:05:31.440
and to understand it is the prime duty of Sahajyogis.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:37.365
During the time of Shree Rama, when Shree Vishnuji incarnated

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:47.030
So, he had come to the world specifically

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:51.690
as Socrates has described a benevolent king

00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:55.020
one who thinks of the good of the people.

00:05:55.044 --> 00:05:58.617
He came to this world as a symbol of that.

00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:07.037
He was a symbol of very loving husband

00:06:07.061 --> 00:06:11.372
was a father as well as a brother

00:06:11.396 --> 00:06:15.314
devotee of Mother Land as well as of parents

00:06:15.338 --> 00:06:19.691
he followed all the religions of the world.

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:29.567
And at last He fulfilled even the duties of a king with great penance.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:33.965
He lived in the world like an ascetic.

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:38.420
And he set an example, how a king should behave?

00:06:38.445 --> 00:06:43.051
From His ideals let our politicians learn something.

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:48.134
That will be very helpful.

00:06:49.052 --> 00:06:52.699
But after that Shree Krishna's birth

00:06:52.723 --> 00:06:56.369
took place in a totally different way.

00:06:56.394 --> 00:07:07.274
Whenever any incarnation takes birth, the same incarnation, same (not clear)

00:07:07.299 --> 00:07:18.723
the object which we take as containing special material

00:07:18.748 --> 00:07:23.748
For example, as many Shree Vishnu's limbs are there

00:07:23.773 --> 00:07:26.206
whenever there are incarnations

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.275
they perform their different types of duties

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:36.476
within that period fulfill the needs of that time.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.339
That was the time when Ram Chanderji had to show

00:07:40.363 --> 00:07:42.563
how an ideal king can be?

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:45.267
How an ideal husband can be?

00:07:45.292 --> 00:07:51.582
He with His own character, with His own goodness

00:07:51.607 --> 00:07:57.764
and with His influence laid a foundation of His feelings within us.

00:08:02.312 --> 00:08:06.198
With that only, the right side of our heart

00:08:06.222 --> 00:08:10.360
He made what we call our right heart.

00:08:10.385 --> 00:08:16.928
When the same incarnation had to come during Krishna's time

00:08:16.952 --> 00:08:21.024
The thing that He had made established so much

00:08:21.048 --> 00:08:24.169
detatchment became so prevalent

00:08:24.193 --> 00:08:30.862
there were kings like Harish Chandra who went to the extremes

00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:32.448
went to the extremes.

00:08:32.472 --> 00:08:34.522
The matter turned out to be extreme.

00:08:34.546 --> 00:08:37.932
What they had taught, turned out to be extreme.

00:08:37.956 --> 00:08:41.541
All the kings turned out to be ascetic, became saints

00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:47.698
discarded their wives saying, " We are Ram Chander Ji."

00:08:47.723 --> 00:08:51.461
Then Shree Krishna's birth took place.

00:08:51.485 --> 00:08:57.569
About Shree Ram Chander Ji , it is said

00:08:57.594 --> 00:09:02.597
that His incarnation too should be on the human level only.

00:09:02.621 --> 00:09:05.336
He should be a benevolent king.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.262
So, He had deliberately forgotten

00:09:08.287 --> 00:09:11.665
that He is an incarnation of Shree Vishnu.

00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:17.105
And that is why , He is not on the middle path. He is on the right side.

00:09:17.129 --> 00:09:22.069
But when Shree Krishna came on Vishuddhi Chakra

00:09:22.093 --> 00:09:29.860
to correct the same concept, He took a completely different form.

00:09:29.884 --> 00:09:34.073
Now when He came in the form of Shree Krishna

00:09:34.098 --> 00:09:40.632
He said that all this seriousness should be given up.

00:09:40.657 --> 00:09:45.908
In those days, there were shocks from all sides.

00:09:45.933 --> 00:09:50.841
In those days only there was Neminaath Ji who was very serious.

00:09:50.865 --> 00:09:54.873
He made people to stop eating their food.

00:09:54.897 --> 00:10:02.310
Every type of bond of religion had clashed.

00:10:02.334 --> 00:10:04.967
This is your religion, that is your religion.

00:10:04.991 --> 00:10:07.577
As if some military of religious people had become.

00:10:07.601 --> 00:10:11.818
In the military, after giving up food and drinking

00:10:11.842 --> 00:10:15.397
all of them were sitting after being greatly distressed

00:10:15.429 --> 00:10:18.583
like Parshuram ji.

00:10:18.607 --> 00:10:27.356
So, same Shree Ram took his birth in the form of Shree Krishna.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:37.180
And because of His own conditionings, He made an effort to break it.

00:10:37.205 --> 00:10:40.592
The same thing happened at the time of Mohommad Sahib.

00:10:40.617 --> 00:10:43.480
When Mohommad Sahib came

00:10:43.504 --> 00:10:49.600
the place where was born, people tortured Him much.

00:10:49.624 --> 00:10:52.968
Even poisoned Him, killed Him in a way.

00:10:52.992 --> 00:10:56.384
Bothered Him a lot.

00:10:56.409 --> 00:11:03.176
He taught that to save your life, you can even go for a war.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.466
That was the need of the time.

00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:07.702
That time many people were killed.

00:11:07.727 --> 00:11:09.384
There were many wives.

00:11:09.408 --> 00:11:11.471
If they would have only one wife

00:11:11.495 --> 00:11:14.402
many women would have been without marriage.

00:11:14.426 --> 00:11:17.947
And there was no acceptance for unmarried relationship.

00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:23.502
So He (Mohommad) said, "ok, you have four or five, but marry them".

00:11:23.526 --> 00:11:27.393
Marry, keeping God as witness.

00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:31.162
Because, if the rest of the woman would not have been married

00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:36.507
they would have lived in some ireligious relationship.

00:11:36.532 --> 00:11:42.190
To correct it, He said, "ok, marry four to five times, doesn't matter".

00:11:42.214 --> 00:11:45.813
The young girls with whom nobody marries, even marry those.

00:11:45.837 --> 00:11:48.146
Doesn't matter , but marry.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.818
Means that by marriage, there has to be rightuousness and bonding.

00:11:52.842 --> 00:11:57.511
Then it was calculated that unless every Muslim marries five times

00:11:57.536 --> 00:11:58.867
he is not a Muslim at all.

00:11:58.891 --> 00:12:03.200
We calculate everything.

00:12:03.224 --> 00:12:08.008
And many people, specially I have seen in Uttar Pradesh

00:12:08.032 --> 00:12:10.452
that there they torture their wives a lot

00:12:10.476 --> 00:12:12.322
and turn her out of home on filthy issues.

00:12:12.346 --> 00:12:16.510
And say, even Ram Chander ji had turned out Sita Ji.

00:12:16.534 --> 00:12:24.471
Are all of you Ram Chander ji?

00:12:24.495 --> 00:12:28.101
In this way, in every Yuga, all the great incarnations that came

00:12:28.126 --> 00:12:32.468
man expressed something like this

00:12:32.493 --> 00:12:35.457
that they held their ears about what did they say.

00:12:35.481 --> 00:12:37.679
For example Dr. Sahab said one thing

00:12:37.703 --> 00:12:39.780
that don't take Mother's flowers

00:12:39.804 --> 00:12:41.891
Ganas have their right over these flowers.

00:12:41.915 --> 00:12:46.437
Two hundred and fifty peole gave up Sahajyoga and left.

00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:48.826
Because he said that it is the right of the Gannas

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:50.988
you should not go during the night.

00:12:51.012 --> 00:12:55.615
You will be in little trouble. Gannas will bother you.

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:59.051
Whatever we say, how to look at it in the reverse direction

00:12:59.075 --> 00:13:00.362
man knows very well.

00:13:00.387 --> 00:13:01.455
Don't know, what it is?

00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:03.147
There is some such thing in his eye

00:13:03.172 --> 00:13:05.565
some inverted device is fixed in his mind

00:13:05.589 --> 00:13:09.607
that whatever you say for his benefit, he takes it to his own advantage.

00:13:09.632 --> 00:13:16.842
So, Shri Krishna tried to eliminate many things.

00:13:16.866 --> 00:13:22.431
When He came into this world, He said it is all leela.

00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:30.566
All this is leela, leela dhar, it is leela!

00:13:30.599 --> 00:13:35.018
What is there to be serious about any thing? It is all a play!

00:13:35.042 --> 00:13:40.995
It is all play, what is there to take it so seriously

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:46.890
that you are sitting in this way, like Dudhacharya.

00:13:46.914 --> 00:13:50.055
Why to take to asceticism?

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:52.544
Or why to torture your body?

00:13:52.568 --> 00:13:54.980
It is all Leela.

00:13:55.004 --> 00:13:59.926
And He started showing His Leela from His childhood only.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:06.826
Behind him, his maternal uncle was engaged in the form of a demon.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:15.814
But the leelas he did, you can understand their subtleties in Sahajyog.

00:14:15.838 --> 00:14:18.699
For example, a person would call himself, Shree Krishna

00:14:18.723 --> 00:14:23.186
I am Shree Krishna, so i take off their clothes.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.052
I said,'' Oh! what to speak of you?"

00:14:25.076 --> 00:14:27.353
I asked, "Sir, what business have you sought

00:14:27.377 --> 00:14:29.335
that you take out ladies' clothes?"

00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:30.905
Said, "I am Shree Krishna!"

00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:32.066
I said,''ok!"

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.746
Since when you are Shree Krishna?

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.922
I asked him,"When Shree Krishna would hide ladies' clothes

00:14:40.947 --> 00:14:43.555
how old was He?"

00:14:43.579 --> 00:14:46.082
Only five years.

00:14:46.106 --> 00:14:52.297
What does an innocent child of five years understand?

00:14:52.321 --> 00:14:55.026
And your age is just nothing.

00:14:55.051 --> 00:14:57.592
Whatever it is, your hair has already turned grey

00:14:57.692 --> 00:14:59.142
and you have become bald also.

00:14:59.167 --> 00:15:04.844
Now, how can you be Shree Krishna?

00:15:04.868 --> 00:15:09.928
I said so and within eight days, somebody took off all his clothes

00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:12.283
and he was just jumping here and there.

00:15:12.307 --> 00:15:16.906
So, Shree Krishna showed such leelas

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.570
in each of His work

00:15:18.595 --> 00:15:22.178
you look at it from subtle point of view, you can understand.

00:15:22.202 --> 00:15:25.989
What did He do by taking off (their)clothes?

00:15:26.013 --> 00:15:34.372
When He took off their clothes, they took a dip in  Jamuna ji, taking their bath

00:15:34.411 --> 00:15:39.740
and in Jamuna ji, He had already sunk feet of Radha ji.

00:15:39.764 --> 00:15:42.882
So, that power was already transferred to that.

00:15:42.906 --> 00:15:43.987
and He wanted that

00:15:44.011 --> 00:15:47.277
let the effect of this water be on them for a very long time

00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:51.382
so that  their kundalini would awaken.

00:15:51.406 --> 00:15:53.150
Even then it didn't happen.

00:15:53.174 --> 00:15:55.924
Then they started walking with pots on their heads.

00:15:55.948 --> 00:15:57.552
He threw stones from the back.

00:15:57.576 --> 00:15:59.895
Threw stones from the back!

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:03.915
Same water which was vibrated

00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:09.001
started dripping slowly on their back.

00:16:09.026 --> 00:16:12.681
So, that activated their kundalini.

00:16:12.705 --> 00:16:13.780
Experience it just now.

00:16:13.805 --> 00:16:15.929
If somebody's kundalini doesn't awaken

00:16:15.953 --> 00:16:18.539
apply vibrated water, kundalini will rise.

00:16:18.563 --> 00:16:22.176
Can't say if it will stop somewhere, but it will rise.

00:16:22.255 --> 00:16:26.101
He found a playful method to awaken their kundalini

00:16:26.125 --> 00:16:28.542
that hit a stone from the back

00:16:28.566 --> 00:16:30.589
the water will absolutely fall like this

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:32.319
will fall on their back.

00:16:32.343 --> 00:16:35.039
Because of that, they will get completely wet

00:16:35.063 --> 00:16:38.826
and that will awaken their kundalini.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:46.011
These are the jobs of Leeladhar. Then why would He steal butter?Why does He like butter?

00:16:46.596 --> 00:16:51.807
Those days, all the butter from Gokul

00:16:51.832 --> 00:17:00.087
would be sent for the soldiers of Kansa, who were demons.

00:17:00.111 --> 00:17:04.337
All the women would not give butter to their children

00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:10.615
would take that butter and give it to those soldiers.

00:17:10.639 --> 00:17:13.757
So Shree Krishna said,"Let us steal butter

00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:15.658
what will they sell then."

00:17:15.682 --> 00:17:18.089
So, He taught everyone to steal butter.

00:17:18.113 --> 00:17:20.190
You eat everyone's butter.

00:17:20.214 --> 00:17:23.065
Because their children would not get butter

00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:24.934
the soldiers would get it who are demons.

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:27.391
We too do our work like that.

00:17:27.415 --> 00:17:31.070
We will not give to our children, but we would give it to demons.

00:17:31.094 --> 00:17:35.248
We raise them only.

00:17:35.272 --> 00:17:37.102
So He taught to steal butter.

00:17:37.127 --> 00:17:39.778
It is very bad to steal

00:17:39.802 --> 00:17:41.698
and is considered as evil (Paap).

00:17:41.722 --> 00:17:45.174
But no body considers stealing butter as evil

00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:47.940
because when cow has given milk at home

00:17:47.964 --> 00:17:50.821
and when there is butter at our home

00:17:50.845 --> 00:17:52.549
children at home may not take

00:17:52.574 --> 00:17:53.994
while the demons who are outsiders may take

00:17:54.019 --> 00:17:57.139
what type of mannerism it is?

00:17:57.163 --> 00:18:02.490
Here at this very place Krishna has done a very great thing.

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:06.026
What is moral and what is immoral

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:10.343
has talked about it later.

00:18:10.367 --> 00:18:12.697
What we consider as very moral

00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:15.987
that it is very moral and is like this and like that

00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:21.670
in reality has no special virtue.

00:18:21.694 --> 00:18:26.554
Now suppose somebody is saving his income tax.

00:18:26.578 --> 00:18:30.462
It is good, no problem!

00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:36.068
By giving it to the government, otherwise also government gets it.

00:18:36.092 --> 00:18:39.537
But to do government's work also, money is required.

00:18:39.561 --> 00:18:41.505
So we should pray like this

00:18:41.529 --> 00:18:43.549
that let there be such an honest government

00:18:43.573 --> 00:18:45.367
to which paying income-tax is no problem.

00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:47.839
But you will be surprised

00:18:47.863 --> 00:18:50.862
that Mohommad Sahib has said that you cannot charge tax from people.

00:18:51.227 --> 00:18:54.033
"I will give you everything."

00:18:54.058 --> 00:18:56.737
And when he stopped charging their own tax

00:18:56.762 --> 00:19:00.485
oil came out there and people are living happily.

00:19:00.509 --> 00:19:01.958
There nobody charges tax.

00:19:01.982 --> 00:19:05.065
There is no custom, no tax, nothing.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.699
Rest all the madness is there

00:19:06.723 --> 00:19:09.298
but these two three things are very good.

00:19:09.322 --> 00:19:18.033
There nobody charges tax, no custom, whatever yo may carry except wine.

00:19:18.057 --> 00:19:20.726
In this way, the clash between moral and immoral

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.057
what is moral and what is immoral?

00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:26.869
Shree krishna laid much stress on that.

00:19:26.893 --> 00:19:28.136
in this way

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.656
that Manu had said

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.438
'Satyam Vadey, Priyam Vade'

00:19:35.462 --> 00:19:37.557
Speak truth and speak sweetly.

00:19:37.581 --> 00:19:41.693
People questioned Krishna, what does it mean?

00:19:41.717 --> 00:19:44.945
If we speak truth, people don't like it, they feel bad.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.177
Say anything, it is felt bad.

00:19:47.201 --> 00:19:50.660
Because a human being has so much ego

00:19:50.684 --> 00:19:51.908
tell him something.

00:19:51.933 --> 00:19:55.630
You see Mother is sleeping right now, leave it, not this time

00:19:55.655 --> 00:19:58.322
he feels bad.

00:19:58.346 --> 00:20:01.261
Who has given Mother the right to sleep?

00:20:01.285 --> 00:20:02.504
She can't sleep.

00:20:02.528 --> 00:20:04.188
She doesn't have the right to sleep.

00:20:04.213 --> 00:20:05.459
Why She has come as a mother?

00:20:05.483 --> 00:20:06.912
It is a question of brain.

00:20:06.936 --> 00:20:09.859
They will feel so bad.

00:20:09.883 --> 00:20:13.363
They will never understand that one who is working for twenty four hours

00:20:13.388 --> 00:20:14.921
should be allowed to take a little rest, it doesn't matter.

00:20:14.945 --> 00:20:17.095
No, She is Goddess, She doesn't need to sleep.

00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:22.247
Oh! God also sleeps!

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.564
You go to any temple

00:20:24.588 --> 00:20:27.082
there they say, " All the Gods are sleeping now. They will not wake up".

00:20:27.106 --> 00:20:30.555
It is correct. All the dieties go to sleep.

00:20:30.655 --> 00:20:32.325
Once they sleep

00:20:32.349 --> 00:20:36.006
that time if you awaken Mother She gets perplexed.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.087
But there is no one who can understand.

00:20:38.111 --> 00:20:40.238
Now how to tell the truth?

00:20:40.263 --> 00:20:43.300
It was told after mixing sugar , even then they are angry.

00:20:43.324 --> 00:20:48.073
So He said that the truth cannot be dear.

00:20:48.097 --> 00:20:51.555
Many a times, very unpleasant sounds bitter, very harsh!

00:20:51.579 --> 00:20:54.559
So how to tell, how to tell the truth?

00:20:54.583 --> 00:21:02.559
Shree Krishna said,"See, SATYAM VADE, HITAM VADE, PRIYAM VADE."

00:21:02.583 --> 00:21:05.687
Whatever is for the betterment of the spirit, talk about that.

00:21:05.712 --> 00:21:08.574
Today, they will feel bad, tomorrow they will understand.

00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:11.146
They go to a wrong guru.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.412
After being hit, they came to me.

00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:17.744
I said," you see, that guru is not ok, he is a wrong guy.

00:21:17.768 --> 00:21:20.458
Don't have any relation with him."

00:21:20.483 --> 00:21:24.252
They feel bad.

00:21:24.276 --> 00:21:29.408
But when we suck their negativity

00:21:29.433 --> 00:21:32.515
then we understand that Mother told it for our betterment.

00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:36.156
Shree krishna said that for the benifit of others

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.703
if you have said something for the benifit of spirit

00:21:39.727 --> 00:21:44.478
may be you will feel bad today, tomorrow they will thank you.

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:47.695
And if they have to feel bad, why to worry about such people?

00:21:47.719 --> 00:21:51.765
Forget them! leave them!

00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:56.830
Then somebody said, suppose somebody has come to murder someone

00:21:56.854 --> 00:21:59.137
and he asks

00:21:59.161 --> 00:22:02.931
"Do you know where is the person hiding, whom we want to kill?"

00:22:02.955 --> 00:22:06.297
Now you know as well, should you tell or not tell?

00:22:06.321 --> 00:22:08.511
There is no need to tell!

00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:10.241
Because it is an unauthorised attempt.

00:22:10.265 --> 00:22:12.145
What right he has to ask you?

00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:15.102
He has no right in it.

00:22:15.126 --> 00:22:17.564
He is asking forcefully.

00:22:17.588 --> 00:22:20.644
You may tell him or not, that is your right.

00:22:20.668 --> 00:22:22.543
It is an unauthorised attempt

00:22:22.567 --> 00:22:26.383
and for an unauthorised attempt, you are not answerable.

00:22:26.407 --> 00:22:28.751
It is not your responsibility.

00:22:28.775 --> 00:22:32.800
In this way, Shree Krishna said openly many things

00:22:32.824 --> 00:22:36.083
and to say openly

00:22:36.107 --> 00:22:38.224
there has definitely been one thing

00:22:38.249 --> 00:22:43.096
that people did not understand Shree krishna at that time.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.149
Had they understood Him , there would have been no war.

00:22:46.173 --> 00:22:52.656
And neither the harshness that Duyodhan did, would have taken place.

00:22:52.681 --> 00:22:57.614
But the fight between evil and good continues.

00:22:57.638 --> 00:23:01.612
This is how the whole Mahabharata was created.

00:23:01.636 --> 00:23:07.472
And by that creation man started seeing good and evil.

00:23:07.496 --> 00:23:12.900
Draupadi has a very high status in Shri Krishna's life.

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:20.211
She was his sister who was called Vishnumaya

00:23:20.235 --> 00:23:21.692
whose birth had taken place

00:23:21.716 --> 00:23:25.697
and that had flashed in the sky like lightning

00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:29.905
and who had announced his incarnation.

00:23:29.929 --> 00:23:32.883
That Vishnumaya was Draupadi.

00:23:32.908 --> 00:23:38.685
That is why, He had high regard for Draupadi.

00:23:38.709 --> 00:23:43.193
When Duryodhan put his hand on Draupadi's cloth (Saree)

00:23:43.217 --> 00:23:46.007
and when he started to pull it

00:23:46.031 --> 00:23:48.805
Draupdi also out of faminine modesty

00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:53.182
clenched the border of her saree with her teeth like this.

00:23:53.206 --> 00:23:54.972
After saying 'kri' she stopped.

00:23:54.996 --> 00:23:57.199
'Kri,' by saying 'shan' it would slip.

00:23:57.223 --> 00:23:58.238
It stopped at 'shan'.

00:23:58.262 --> 00:23:59.769
She could not say 'Shan'.

00:23:59.793 --> 00:24:02.501
But when she saw that now the situation is getting worst

00:24:02.525 --> 00:24:06.368
that now my saree is being pulled.

00:24:06.392 --> 00:24:10.706
As soon as, the word 'shan' came out of her mouth

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:14.212
Tulsidas ji has described the situation beautifully.

00:24:14.236 --> 00:24:15.544
It is worth listening.

00:24:15.568 --> 00:24:18.223
Shree Krishna's love for his sister.

00:24:18.247 --> 00:24:21.858
Dwarika main Shor Bhayo, Shor Bhayo Bhari (There was a loud noise in Dwarika).

00:24:21.882 --> 00:24:23.607
He was sitting in Dwarika.

00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:26.825
Dwarika Main Shor Bhayo, Shor Bhayo Bhari (There was a loud noise in Dwarika ).

00:24:26.849 --> 00:24:30.409
Carrying His (weapons) conch, wheel, mace  (not clear)

00:24:30.433 --> 00:24:32.391
was present there.

00:24:32.415 --> 00:24:35.408
He reached there in no time

00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:41.669
to protect the dignity of his sister.

00:24:41.693 --> 00:24:44.516
Now you ask these gentlemen

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.076
if he had no concern for women's modesty

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.061
to keep his sister's honour

00:24:51.085 --> 00:24:53.415
why should he have come running from there to here?

00:24:53.439 --> 00:24:57.387
The work he did at the early age of five

00:24:57.412 --> 00:25:00.706
same, when in youthful stage

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.333
was sitting like a king

00:25:03.357 --> 00:25:10.160
for the sake of safeguarding the honour of of his sister

00:25:10.184 --> 00:25:13.496
why did he come running from there?

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.327
There is no contrast in it.

00:25:16.351 --> 00:25:18.901
There is no contradiction in it.

00:25:18.925 --> 00:25:22.521
These are the qualities of only one character.

00:25:22.545 --> 00:25:26.224
The work a person does in childhood

00:25:26.249 --> 00:25:29.794
is done easily in innocence.

00:25:29.818 --> 00:25:31.718
And then He was Yogeshwara.

00:25:31.742 --> 00:25:35.418
Yogeshwara in reality.

00:25:35.442 --> 00:25:41.573
He was Yogeshwara like this

00:25:41.598 --> 00:25:46.758
that He wedded sixteen thousand women and then five more.

00:25:46.782 --> 00:25:50.000
People will say,"What type of yogeshwara was He?"

00:25:50.024 --> 00:25:52.732
On the one hand, He married sixteen thousand women

00:25:52.757 --> 00:25:54.325
and above that He wedded five more wives.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.475
God save from such a yogeshwara.

00:25:56.499 --> 00:25:58.906
Like this we too can go on doing like that.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.783
Why do you call Wajad Ali Shah a bad man?

00:26:01.807 --> 00:26:04.386
Now a day's wisdom will be like that only.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:08.471
Some take everything on the same platform.

00:26:08.495 --> 00:26:12.311
They are His sixteen thousand powers.

00:26:12.335 --> 00:26:18.874
He was a male, I am a mother. Nobody can tell Me anything.

00:26:18.898 --> 00:26:23.795
Nobody can blame Me in the form of a Mother.

00:26:23.819 --> 00:26:25.787
He was a male.

00:26:25.811 --> 00:26:30.345
Where from could He get sixteen thousand powers in the world?

00:26:30.369 --> 00:26:31.430
You are My sons.

00:26:31.454 --> 00:26:34.660
Sometimes message My feet, sometimes message My head

00:26:34.684 --> 00:26:38.742
You touch My feet. No one can blame Me for touching My feet.

00:26:38.766 --> 00:26:40.378
I am only a Mother!

00:26:40.402 --> 00:26:43.508
Some of My sons are hundred and eight years old.

00:26:43.532 --> 00:26:46.857
Still, I am a Mother, mother is just a mother!

00:26:46.881 --> 00:26:50.370
Mother is always pure. who can touch her?

00:26:50.394 --> 00:26:56.939
But to get Her sixteen thousand powers in the world is not so easy.

00:26:56.973 --> 00:27:00.635
And at that time there were no such people ready as Sahajyogis

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.280
who could be given the responsibility.

00:27:03.308 --> 00:27:07.634
So, He gave birth to His sixteen thousand powers in the form of women.

00:27:07.658 --> 00:27:11.343
And told a king to take them all away from here

00:27:11.367 --> 00:27:13.755
and then after pretending

00:27:13.779 --> 00:27:15.561
It is all a drama.

00:27:15.585 --> 00:27:18.727
And got His sixteen thousand powers to Himself.

00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:21.727
And the five wives He had

00:27:21.751 --> 00:27:24.142
those Panch Mahabhoots

00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:27.568
and made those Panch Mahabhoots also His wives.

00:27:27.592 --> 00:27:30.379
Now this subtle thing you will understand in Sahajyoga.

00:27:30.404 --> 00:27:33.725
You check it on vibrations, if I am telling truth or a lie.

00:27:33.749 --> 00:27:39.414
Whatever I am telling, you will get vibrations, if it is true.

00:27:39.438 --> 00:27:43.354
These sixteen thousand powers and five elements

00:27:43.378 --> 00:27:47.209
He kept them in such a form

00:27:47.233 --> 00:27:48.935
that people could not blame Him.

00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:49.904
Now poor wife

00:27:49.928 --> 00:27:56.508
may be sixteen thousand or any number, she is after all a wife.

00:27:56.563 --> 00:28:00.235
In His playful life

00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:08.340
there are such beautiful melodious moments which cannot be explained.

00:28:08.364 --> 00:28:13.104
Radha ji is His power

00:28:13.128 --> 00:28:18.270
Ra-Dha, Ra means shakti, energy

00:28:18.294 --> 00:28:21.197
Ra, Dha, that which attained it

00:28:21.221 --> 00:28:24.124
that which retained shakti, is Ra-Dha.

00:28:24.148 --> 00:28:28.352
And then when He with that energy

00:28:28.376 --> 00:28:33.953
When He played that RAAS, then again that Ra-Sa...........

00:28:33.978 --> 00:28:35.521
'Sa' means along with that.

00:28:35.546 --> 00:28:40.336
With that power, that 'Ra'

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.663
In this way He played Raas.

00:28:43.687 --> 00:28:46.474
In that also there was arrangement for raising of Kundalini.

00:28:46.498 --> 00:28:49.258
If you are holding your hands

00:28:49.282 --> 00:28:53.499
and if two people get connected to My two feet

00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:56.048
at that time, if some music is going on

00:28:56.072 --> 00:28:58.719
if any Tala is being played, in your hands there will be same Tala.

00:28:58.743 --> 00:29:01.018
If Jap Taal is played then Jap Taal will be in hand.

00:29:01.043 --> 00:29:03.108
If three Taals are played, three taals will be in your hand.

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:05.204
If one Taal is played then one Taal will be in hand.

00:29:05.228 --> 00:29:07.351
You can watch it.

00:29:07.375 --> 00:29:10.842
That is why it was called Raaaas.

00:29:10.866 --> 00:29:13.131
To move it along with energy (Shakti)

00:29:13.155 --> 00:29:16.478
this work He did.

00:29:16.502 --> 00:29:20.727
But once Narad Munni played a trick.

00:29:20.751 --> 00:29:26.691
and he told Shree Krishna

00:29:26.793 --> 00:29:31.220
"Do you really love all these wives?"

00:29:31.245 --> 00:29:34.073
He said , "Yes, I do."

00:29:34.097 --> 00:29:37.660
He (Narada) mesmerized those wives.

00:29:37.684 --> 00:29:42.278
Shree Mataji asks somebody:What is the matter?

00:29:42.302 --> 00:29:49.250
He went and told these wives

00:29:49.274 --> 00:29:57.383
You see, Krishna doesn't love you. He loves only Radha."

00:29:57.407 --> 00:30:00.921
He has left you as His wives just like that

00:30:01.021 --> 00:30:02.648
to be free from any stigma.

00:30:02.673 --> 00:30:06.262
He doesn't love you as such!

00:30:06.286 --> 00:30:08.116
They got mesmerized.

00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:10.719
Ok! It must be so.

00:30:10.743 --> 00:30:17.086
He doesn't love us at all.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:18.671
He loves only Radha ji.

00:30:18.695 --> 00:30:25.368
They told Him,"You don't love us. You love Radhaji."

00:30:25.392 --> 00:30:27.467
Shree Krishna said,"Don't say like that.

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:28.746
My stomach has started hurting too much.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.065
Don't ask me how much it is hurting me".

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:31.976
Why did you feel pain?

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.050
He said,"I feel pain when you talk like this."

00:30:34.074 --> 00:30:35.688
Now they got panicky.

00:30:35.712 --> 00:30:37.458
They asked Him to tell the treatment.

00:30:37.483 --> 00:30:39.614
The treatment is very simple.

00:30:39.638 --> 00:30:42.302
Do it like this, give Me the dust of your feet

00:30:42.326 --> 00:30:45.738
give Me that to drink and I will be ok!

00:30:45.762 --> 00:30:46.948
They said,"Cheers!"

00:30:46.972 --> 00:30:49.301
Already you do not love us

00:30:49.325 --> 00:30:51.949
and you want to deprive us of our virtues also.

00:30:51.973 --> 00:30:56.309
We should drink the dust of your feet.

00:30:56.333 --> 00:30:58.381
That You will take the dust of our feet.

00:30:58.405 --> 00:31:00.222
That will not be possible for us to do.

00:31:00.247 --> 00:31:02.305
All this is to make fool of us. Don't make us fool.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:12.018
He said that this is the only way.

00:31:12.042 --> 00:31:17.643
Saint Narada said,"Narayan, Narayan! What should be done now?"

00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:20.721
He said okay! you go to Radha and tell her.

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:22.509
So, he went to Radha ji.

00:31:22.533 --> 00:31:27.350
He said to Radha ji,''Shree Krishna is very sick."

00:31:27.375 --> 00:31:27.963
She asked , "Why?"

00:31:27.987 --> 00:31:29.777
He said , He is having pain in His stomach.

00:31:29.801 --> 00:31:31.115
Because , He is DHANVANTRI

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.511
He said the treatment is

00:31:32.535 --> 00:31:38.327
the devotee who will send the feet of his dust for Me

00:31:38.352 --> 00:31:40.152
by drinking that I will get well.

00:31:40.176 --> 00:31:44.226
Radha put her foot forward and said, "Ok! Take away the dust of my feet."

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.920
He asked, "Why? Are you not bothered about your Sins and virtuous deeds?"

00:31:47.944 --> 00:31:52.383
He said one who makes us to commit sin

00:31:52.407 --> 00:31:54.587
and one who makes us to do good deeds is He only.

00:31:54.611 --> 00:31:55.487
You go and take it

00:31:55.511 --> 00:31:57.901
and relieve him of his stomach pain.

00:31:57.925 --> 00:32:00.136
So, he took the dust of her feet.

00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:03.724
The soil of Vrindavan is yellow coloured, you must have seen.

00:32:03.748 --> 00:32:06.982
He took it and reached there.

00:32:07.006 --> 00:32:10.204
And said, Yes, Radha ji has given it, and now drink it.

00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:12.979
He mixed it and drank it.

00:32:13.003 --> 00:32:16.443
Shree krishna asked him ," Why are you standing like this?"

00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:19.440
He said," Radha ji said something which i could not understand.

00:32:19.464 --> 00:32:21.223
That You only make one to do virtuous act

00:32:21.247 --> 00:32:22.874
and you only make one to commit sin."

00:32:22.898 --> 00:32:25.282
"Oh! Did you not understand it?"

00:32:25.306 --> 00:32:25.961
He said ,"No."

00:32:25.985 --> 00:32:28.271
Krishna said,"Okay! look into My heart!"

00:32:28.295 --> 00:32:32.874
When he looked at His heart, he found Radha ji sitting in His heart.

00:32:32.898 --> 00:32:40.147
And Her feet were touching the nectar of lotus and  turning yellow coloured.

00:32:40.171 --> 00:32:43.741
Then Narad ji understood that if She is sitting in heart

00:32:43.765 --> 00:32:50.952
then, what does feet or head or hand matter?

00:32:51.023 --> 00:32:53.787
This imagination of sins and virtues

00:32:53.811 --> 00:32:55.716
was changed by shree Krishna.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:33:01.008
What we consider as great sin and great virtue

00:33:01.033 --> 00:33:07.600
its complete knowledge

00:33:07.624 --> 00:33:11.959
its discretion has been given to us by Shree Krishna.

00:33:11.983 --> 00:33:15.884
That is why, when Hamsa chakra gets impaired

00:33:15.908 --> 00:33:18.032
man loses his power of discretion.

00:33:18.057 --> 00:33:20.136
He doesn't understand sin and virtue

00:33:20.161 --> 00:33:22.240
doesn't understand good or bad.

00:33:22.264 --> 00:33:24.497
And there is same treatment for both of them.

00:33:24.521 --> 00:33:30.705
If there is something wrong with Vishudhi chakra or Hamsa chakra

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.697
there is a very simple solution.

00:33:32.721 --> 00:33:36.113
The sahajyogis who have knowledge, let them not speak.

00:33:36.138 --> 00:33:38.500
But those who are ignorant, can feel

00:33:38.524 --> 00:33:44.213
that there was one thing which Shree Krishna liked and that was , butter.

00:33:44.237 --> 00:33:47.040
Its tretment is butter.

00:33:47.064 --> 00:33:54.793
I daily apply a little butter with a little salt to My Vishudhi chakra

00:33:54.818 --> 00:33:56.373
because it goes on talking whole day.

00:33:56.398 --> 00:33:59.381
It doesn't bother Me.

00:33:59.757 --> 00:34:01.771
You also do so.

00:34:01.795 --> 00:34:06.923
Take a little bit of butter on thumb with a little salt on it

00:34:06.947 --> 00:34:09.408
then at the back there is lower part of the tounge

00:34:09.432 --> 00:34:12.077
apply it thrice to it.

00:34:12.101 --> 00:34:14.915
Your throat will be absolutely okay.

00:34:14.939 --> 00:34:18.820
Cough etc. will vanish, everything will be okay.

00:34:18.844 --> 00:34:21.320
And Hamsa chakra catches because

00:34:21.344 --> 00:34:23.448
the place where we live

00:34:23.472 --> 00:34:26.952
there is dryness and because of that

00:34:26.976 --> 00:34:29.394
a great question arises

00:34:29.418 --> 00:34:34.162
is that our inner skin

00:34:34.186 --> 00:34:35.973
which is just like a membrane

00:34:35.997 --> 00:34:40.702
and its epitherial cells

00:34:40.726 --> 00:34:42.280
because it dries up

00:34:42.305 --> 00:34:49.404
As the skin of hands dries up in winter, in the same way it dries up inside.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:54.038
And because of that, you get all these diseases like sinus and all the worldly disases.

00:34:54.062 --> 00:34:56.726
That too has a very simple treatment.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:00.170
If you put butter after melting it in the nose

00:35:00.194 --> 00:35:00.771
your job is done.

00:35:00.796 --> 00:35:03.578
If not, then you make ghee from butter

00:35:03.603 --> 00:35:08.219
then you drain it in a cloth and add a little salt to it

00:35:08.243 --> 00:35:11.281
keep it and then and put it in the nose.

00:35:11.305 --> 00:35:17.696
All your sinus troubles will be clear.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.496
This is the simple solution of Shree Krishna.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.101
You do it and then tell Me.

00:35:26.125 --> 00:35:28.653
Daily in the morning, every Sahajyogi must

00:35:28.677 --> 00:35:33.312
take a little butter in his hand, add a little salt

00:35:33.337 --> 00:35:35.797
and offer thrice to Shree Krishna.

00:35:35.821 --> 00:35:40.771
Then put two drops of ghee in the nose.

00:35:40.795 --> 00:35:42.273
Put it at the time of going to sleep.

00:35:42.297 --> 00:35:45.207
your cold will be over.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:28.244
Those who are having problems with each other, having troubles

00:37:28.269 --> 00:37:29.389
and fights are going on

00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:31.993
in a way, don't know what confusion you are in.

00:37:32.018 --> 00:37:33.470
You did this wrong, he did that wrong

00:37:33.494 --> 00:37:35.580
either he did that wrong and he did that wrong

00:37:35.604 --> 00:37:38.044
And all those who are banging their heads among themselves

00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:40.465
this is just a drama.

00:37:40.489 --> 00:37:43.541
And who is the stage manager of that, is Shree Krishna.

00:37:43.565 --> 00:37:48.045
He makes you fight, He makes you break your head.

00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:53.878
And what does He prove, is that Bramha is the only truth.

00:37:53.902 --> 00:37:59.578
Bramha means the all pervading power which you have felt.

00:37:59.603 --> 00:38:02.177
This is the truth, this only tells the truth.

00:38:02.201 --> 00:38:05.244
From this we will know what is the truth.

00:38:05.268 --> 00:38:08.493
Whatever else is there, is just a joke.

00:38:08.517 --> 00:38:13.953
Mutual quarrel, mutual conversation, mutual this thing is all useless.

00:38:13.977 --> 00:38:18.538
Now this sports instinct

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:21.929
is more than necessary even among us.

00:38:21.953 --> 00:38:25.167
And I also play variety of tricks.

00:38:25.191 --> 00:38:29.397
Now you will also realise and will come to know

00:38:29.421 --> 00:38:32.535
that Mother plays variety of tricks.

00:38:32.559 --> 00:38:36.800
That is why it is said SHASTRARE MAHAMAYA.

00:38:36.824 --> 00:38:39.472
My advent was at Sahastrara.

00:38:39.496 --> 00:38:40.768
I am also Mahamaya.

00:38:40.792 --> 00:38:43.337
It is difficult to recognise and catch hold of Me.

00:38:43.361 --> 00:38:44.609
One who will try to catch hold of Me

00:38:44.634 --> 00:38:46.606
I will run away from his clutches.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:52.689
And the one who will not want to catch hold of Me I will enter into his system.

00:38:52.713 --> 00:38:56.017
So in this way, My life style goes on.

00:38:56.041 --> 00:39:01.137
But even then I will surely talk symbolically so that, you understand.

00:39:01.162 --> 00:39:04.577
That here we are talking about collective consciousness.

00:39:04.601 --> 00:39:07.295
Whatever is in RAAS, it is there.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.835
Whatever is outside is not your own.

00:39:08.859 --> 00:39:12.365
An attempt should be made that everybody comes to RAAS

00:39:12.389 --> 00:39:14.341
but those who are not in Raas, they will be out.

00:39:14.365 --> 00:39:17.186
So, there are two types of forces in Sahajyoga

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:23.140
which you regard as Centripetal and Centrifugal force in Physics.

00:39:23.165 --> 00:39:27.007
If we hold a rope in hand with a stone tied to it and rotate it

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:30.493
one part of it remains pulled inside which we hold with hand

00:39:30.518 --> 00:39:33.253
the second part runs towards outside.

00:39:33.277 --> 00:39:37.955
One who desires to come inside and is stationed inside

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:44.702
and one who establishes connection (with spirit) within himself

00:39:44.726 --> 00:39:45.939
he remains inside.

00:39:45.963 --> 00:39:48.585
Rest , others are thrown out so badly

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.720
that it is a matter of surprise.

00:39:50.745 --> 00:39:52.977
and we are not sad about that.

00:39:53.001 --> 00:39:56.367
Those who can stay inside, let them stay inside

00:39:56.391 --> 00:39:57.031
those who can stay outside , let them stay outside.

00:39:57.055 --> 00:39:59.194
It is written in Bible

00:39:59.218 --> 00:40:04.298
that only, one lakh and forty four thousand people

00:40:04.323 --> 00:40:05.124
will get their realization.

00:40:05.148 --> 00:40:08.427
Now you tell, the population of our country is so much

00:40:08.451 --> 00:40:10.957
that Mr. John has written very nicely

00:40:10.982 --> 00:40:13.090
that more than this number are not going to get realisation.

00:40:13.115 --> 00:40:15.957
Now you tell how many people are going to get it?

00:40:15.981 --> 00:40:20.720
What is the population of kolkatta?

00:40:20.744 --> 00:40:21.847
What is the number of public?

00:40:21.872 --> 00:40:24.396
Three lakh.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.738
So two lakh is the population of Kolkatta.

00:40:26.762 --> 00:40:28.934
So, how many people have gone?

00:40:28.958 --> 00:40:32.673
And what is the population of our country?

00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:34.904
Don't talk about Crore.

00:40:34.928 --> 00:40:38.419
They have stopped the vehichle at one lakh only.

00:40:38.443 --> 00:40:42.592
They are not allowing it to be two lakh, from one lakh.

00:40:42.616 --> 00:40:45.544
So, tell Me how many people are going to get realization?

00:40:45.568 --> 00:40:52.537
HAZIR SE HUZAR NAHI AUR GAIR KI TALASH NAHI

00:40:52.561 --> 00:40:55.833
Those who will come to the center, will survive

00:40:55.858 --> 00:40:57.006
others will just vanish.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:00.598
You may be Lakhpati or a Bakhpati.

00:41:00.622 --> 00:41:02.317
It's not going to matter.

00:41:02.341 --> 00:41:06.196
Those who will come to the center only they will survive

00:41:06.221 --> 00:41:07.598
the rest are not going to survive.

00:41:07.623 --> 00:41:08.857
It is not of this place

00:41:08.882 --> 00:41:10.633
it is the experience I am sharing of

00:41:10.657 --> 00:41:12.911
America and England and every other place.

00:41:12.935 --> 00:41:14.514
I went to America.

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.873
Took out a lot of money from bank

00:41:17.017 --> 00:41:20.456
reached there, spent a lot of money.

00:41:20.481 --> 00:41:25.229
In total we spent forty four thousand Dollars.

00:41:25.253 --> 00:41:28.556
I spent a lot of money and people also spent their money.

00:41:28.581 --> 00:41:32.890
Meanwhile, after doing all this when we  returned from that place

00:41:32.915 --> 00:41:38.729
total four Sahajyogis came from there for the programme, just four.

00:41:38.753 --> 00:41:43.829
Ten thousand Dollars were spent for one person.

00:41:43.853 --> 00:41:45.421
Out of those three stood outside.

00:41:45.445 --> 00:41:53.643
With a great difficulty one came and he ran away at that time.

00:41:53.667 --> 00:41:55.317
I come and thousands of people come

00:41:55.342 --> 00:41:57.749
because, didn't get ticket at a cinema

00:41:57.774 --> 00:42:01.485
let us listen to Mother's lecture.

00:42:01.668 --> 00:42:04.291
Couldn't go to watch a play, let us listen to Mother's lecture.

00:42:04.315 --> 00:42:05.575
The play was not played.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:11.497
Will get atleast something at Mother's place, it is free, let us go!

00:42:11.521 --> 00:42:14.033
You will get lot of free eaters.

00:42:14.057 --> 00:42:16.275
You will get lot of useless people.

00:42:16.299 --> 00:42:20.376
First we will feel, yes, they are coming just like a sea.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:26.337
But how many are there drops of SWATI (the purest first drop of rain ) which give satisfaction to CHAKOR (a bird enamoured of the Moon).
............

00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:32.266
If your atma is CHAKOR, it will consider only drop of SWATI.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:36.485
So, you must not bother so much about quantity.

00:42:36.509 --> 00:42:39.330
Let the quantity be benefitted by Sahajyoga

00:42:39.354 --> 00:42:41.090
but we must fix quality.

00:42:41.114 --> 00:42:48.721
Until quality is good, quantity is useless.

00:42:48.745 --> 00:42:51.111
When Shivaji would go in for a war

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:54.755
behind him, many such people would join in a line.

00:42:54.779 --> 00:42:57.801
Ramdas Swami told him

00:42:57.825 --> 00:42:59.979
See! those who are called Bazaar (not clear)

00:43:00.003 --> 00:43:01.986
all those people who are sitting in the market

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:03.775
you sort out them.

00:43:03.799 --> 00:43:07.438
If they go away, it will be very nice.

00:43:07.462 --> 00:43:12.557
Because these people carry paan, bidi, match box and ciggarette, everything.

00:43:12.581 --> 00:43:16.408
Apart from that they carry all eatables too.

00:43:16.432 --> 00:43:20.134
Because of that those who are soldiers, their attention gets fixed on that itself.

00:43:20.158 --> 00:43:22.258
Remove all this market

00:43:22.282 --> 00:43:24.430
then you will win the battle.

00:43:24.454 --> 00:43:27.197
But Muslims did not do so.

00:43:27.221 --> 00:43:29.040
That is why Shivaji won the battle.

00:43:29.064 --> 00:43:32.328
With very few people he won the battle.

00:43:32.352 --> 00:43:37.288
At last when Aurandjeb invaded

00:43:37.312 --> 00:43:43.694
Tara Bhai defeated him in Kolahpur and he had to return back.

00:43:43.719 --> 00:43:47.408
So it is a matter of quality.

00:43:47.432 --> 00:43:49.120
So its quality must be multiplied.

00:43:49.145 --> 00:43:51.792
In Sahajyoga, the person whose quality will multiply as a result of spiritual connection

00:43:51.816 --> 00:43:53.177
only he can do some work.

00:43:53.201 --> 00:43:56.083
He only is of some use and he only is a Sahajyogi.

00:43:56.107 --> 00:43:58.945
And then there are usually some people

00:43:58.969 --> 00:43:59.937
my mother is sick.

00:43:59.961 --> 00:44:00.928
I treated his mother.

00:44:00.953 --> 00:44:03.124
or, my father is ill, treated him

00:44:03.148 --> 00:44:05.577
Treat my father's father. Father was cured and he was okay.

00:44:05.601 --> 00:44:08.084
And then, my daiughter is sick, plz cure her.

00:44:08.108 --> 00:44:09.504
Plz cure my son.

00:44:09.528 --> 00:44:12.628
Then when you say, it is too much now, they start crying.

00:44:12.652 --> 00:44:13.823
They cry so loudly.

00:44:13.847 --> 00:44:15.132
Hello! what happened to you?

00:44:15.156 --> 00:44:18.694
You have cured everyone and now why you are leaving him uncured?

00:44:18.718 --> 00:44:22.353
Why don't you cure him?

00:44:22.377 --> 00:44:24.023
You will be fine.

00:44:24.047 --> 00:44:25.315
In the beginning it will be so.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.522
You will see that mostly

00:44:27.546 --> 00:44:32.533
it will be, that you will cure cancer patients all over the world.

00:44:32.557 --> 00:44:34.916
I will say the same thing to the people of Lion's club also

00:44:34.941 --> 00:44:40.140
that first of all, you yourself be strong Sahajyogis.

00:44:40.164 --> 00:44:44.079
or when you will go to cure them, you will have headache .

00:44:44.103 --> 00:44:47.766
First be a perfect Sahajyogi and then use your hand.

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.171
And there is no need, give them photo.

00:44:50.195 --> 00:44:51.569
Photo will do everything.

00:44:51.594 --> 00:44:55.123
That will give them faith and they will get cured as well.

00:44:55.147 --> 00:44:58.723
More than you, they will be ok with photograph only.

00:44:58.747 --> 00:45:02.042
Because if you are there, they will be after you,"keep your hand on my head."

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:03.885
Even now you see, wherever I go

00:45:03.909 --> 00:45:06.167
"Mother, please put your hand on my head."

00:45:06.191 --> 00:45:07.820
"put your hand here."

00:45:07.844 --> 00:45:12.107
They will pull My hand (and say) keep it here.

00:45:12.131 --> 00:45:13.501
okay! take it.

00:45:13.525 --> 00:45:14.532
keep it there.

00:45:14.556 --> 00:45:17.001
What to do? leave My life.

00:45:17.026 --> 00:45:23.961
You will also face such a compulsion.

00:45:23.985 --> 00:45:27.775
To be away from this compulsion, the best way is to

00:45:27.799 --> 00:45:30.851
that you give them (My) photo and tell them to use the photograph.

00:45:30.875 --> 00:45:33.046
If they have Photo, let them use it.

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:36.130
One who does not consider photo as valid, cannot recover at all.

00:45:36.154 --> 00:45:38.874
My dear, you take the photo, work on photo.

00:45:38.899 --> 00:45:40.254
We will see if it goes well.

00:45:40.278 --> 00:45:43.904
You just see that, that person is doing well.

00:45:43.929 --> 00:45:47.344
Because, you will be caught.

00:45:47.368 --> 00:45:50.739
In our Sahajyoga, Dr. Warren worked most.

00:45:50.763 --> 00:45:56.066
When he went from here to Australia, he was in high spirits

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:57.495
that now Mother's work has to be done.

00:45:57.519 --> 00:45:59.744
And he also had some experiences like this.

00:45:59.768 --> 00:46:02.161
In a few days, the petrol also was exhausted

00:46:02.185 --> 00:46:04.521
There was not much petrol in the car.

00:46:04.545 --> 00:46:09.792
and people said that strike is going on and petrol will not be available now.

00:46:09.816 --> 00:46:12.356
He said, we will do our work just on this much petrol only.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:16.429
They said that they used only that much petrol for one month

00:46:16.718 --> 00:46:19.599
and when we came to the petrol pump they asked have you  come to get the petrol filled

00:46:19.624 --> 00:46:22.031
but the tank is full of petrol.

00:46:22.055 --> 00:46:25.110
They he got convinced that Mother had given him great encoragement

00:46:25.135 --> 00:46:26.790
and that we are doing this work.

00:46:26.814 --> 00:46:28.578
But there they made a mistake.

00:46:28.602 --> 00:46:32.466
Instead of giving realisation to the people, they started curing them.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.570
There used to be a crowd waiting for them to get well.

00:46:35.594 --> 00:46:39.604
There used to be such crowd that it became impossible for them to live.

00:46:39.628 --> 00:46:42.810
After that he said,"Mother, I am feeling lot of pain in my head.

00:46:42.835 --> 00:46:45.516
my body is falling apart, feel heart attatcks

00:46:45.541 --> 00:46:47.314
don't know, pulpitation is going on."

00:46:47.384 --> 00:46:49.954
I asked him, "What business are you doing there?"

00:46:49.978 --> 00:46:51.602
He said, "i cure all the people."

00:46:51.627 --> 00:46:53.521
I asked him, "Why do you cure them?"

00:46:53.545 --> 00:46:57.820
Here even the wrestlers come and say, "Mother, Please grant us peace."

00:46:57.844 --> 00:46:59.969
What is the use of making them even wreslers?

00:46:59.994 --> 00:47:02.067
They will be about to say,"Why didn't you give us peace first?"

00:47:02.091 --> 00:47:03.764
Give them realisation.

00:47:03.788 --> 00:47:05.522
Why are you curing them?

00:47:05.546 --> 00:47:09.545
Then he understood that he was doing wrong.

00:47:09.569 --> 00:47:12.874
But as soon as he said,"Curing is over."

00:47:12.899 --> 00:47:15.553
The whole crowd could be seen, nowhere.

00:47:15.578 --> 00:47:18.546
It could not be traced where from that crowd had come.

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.967
Just like a ghost disappears

00:47:20.991 --> 00:47:23.608
in that way, they were out of sight.

00:47:23.632 --> 00:47:25.967
Then, it stuck to his mind

00:47:25.991 --> 00:47:27.921
that these people are............KAMARTHI

00:47:27.946 --> 00:47:30.164
They are useless people, useless for God's work.

00:47:30.188 --> 00:47:33.115
Then he started from one to two people.

00:47:33.139 --> 00:47:36.233
Even in Sahajyoga, first only one lady got realisation.

00:47:36.257 --> 00:47:37.594
First only one, just one

00:47:37.618 --> 00:47:40.776
and after that, only twelve people got their realization.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:46.874
And I worked very hard for those twelve, very hard.

00:47:46.898 --> 00:47:50.475
When I started the work first in England

00:47:50.499 --> 00:47:56.252
I worked with seven hippies for four years.

00:47:56.276 --> 00:47:57.540
I worked very hard with my hands for them.

00:47:57.564 --> 00:48:02.062
My husband would say, why are you so engrossed in transforming these fools?

00:48:02.086 --> 00:48:04.965
Nothing can transform them, they are just stones.

00:48:04.989 --> 00:48:06.905
Just see, I made them to stand up

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:09.196
and it is because of them only, that Sahajyoga has established there.

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:12.861
The foundation stones are never visible.

00:48:12.886 --> 00:48:14.934
Some people have the habit of showing off a lot.

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:16.536
Let them do.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.474
They will themselves diminish.

00:48:18.498 --> 00:48:20.234
Either they will be fine

00:48:20.258 --> 00:48:22.771
their show off business would come to an end

00:48:22.795 --> 00:48:26.686
If not so, then they will come to an end.

00:48:26.711 --> 00:48:28.043
Otherwise also they won't come to Sahajyoga.

00:48:28.067 --> 00:48:31.758
You should not worry so much about it.

00:48:31.782 --> 00:48:33.796
You should be in collectivity.

00:48:33.837 --> 00:48:39.382
Those who will be in collectivity, there only shall I reside.

00:48:39.406 --> 00:48:43.457
Where four people will be sitting in my name, I will reside there only.

00:48:43.482 --> 00:48:46.441
Many people will say, we worship at home.

00:48:46.465 --> 00:48:50.604
Mother, we have kept your photo, still we will have cancer.

00:48:50.628 --> 00:48:53.151
Yes, it will definitely happen.

00:48:53.175 --> 00:48:58.658
If you don't come to center, it is none of My responsibility.

00:48:58.682 --> 00:49:01.173
You can get heart attack, you can have cancer

00:49:01.197 --> 00:49:03.573
whatever disease others have, you too can have.

00:49:03.598 --> 00:49:05.039
You are normal people for Me.

00:49:05.063 --> 00:49:07.474
Realisation makes no difference.

00:49:07.498 --> 00:49:09.916
Your tree is not built yet.

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.113
And specially , after realisation

00:49:13.138 --> 00:49:15.227
the responsibility is all the more in the beginning.

00:49:15.251 --> 00:49:17.892
Because if a seed has been sprouted

00:49:17.916 --> 00:49:20.556
you have to take more care in the beginning.

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:24.003
If you don't take its care, there can be any problem

00:49:24.028 --> 00:49:27.114
as is the case with normal people (Not clear).

00:49:27.139 --> 00:49:28.538
You are normal people.

00:49:28.562 --> 00:49:31.656
You don't have any place in the kingdom of God

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.189
nor can I give you any consent.

00:49:34.213 --> 00:49:37.575
Those who come to the center, they should come to the center.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:40.180
This is about collectivity.

00:49:40.204 --> 00:49:42.118
We got collective consciousness.

00:49:42.142 --> 00:49:44.839
We can see a tree, we can see this.

00:49:44.863 --> 00:49:46.552
Immediately you start giving judgment.

00:49:46.576 --> 00:49:48.519
This is not collective consciousness.

00:49:48.543 --> 00:49:51.654
Collective consciousness means

00:49:51.678 --> 00:49:55.431
that we have become part and parcel of Virat

00:49:55.455 --> 00:49:57.383
and there is no one else.

00:49:57.407 --> 00:50:00.028
And till he does not awaken

00:50:00.052 --> 00:50:06.090
till he doesn't become Sahajyogi, he is another.

00:50:06.114 --> 00:50:10.100
But I have seen also Sahajyogis like this, that they are good with others

00:50:10.124 --> 00:50:13.099
come, sit and do this

00:50:13.123 --> 00:50:17.239
and amongst themselves (Not Clear). It is very surprising.

00:50:17.263 --> 00:50:20.452
Only one mother has given birth to all of you

00:50:20.476 --> 00:50:23.664
and you are sons of only one mother.

00:50:23.688 --> 00:50:25.630
Every body has little understanding amongst themselves.

00:50:25.654 --> 00:50:29.403
Why do you fight for others?

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.894
Why do you quarrel over others?

00:50:31.918 --> 00:50:37.828
That cannot give any peace to Me nor to God.

00:50:37.852 --> 00:50:40.178
Don't fight for others amongst yourselves.

00:50:40.202 --> 00:50:42.209
Those who are others, are others

00:50:42.233 --> 00:50:46.210
and you are one and the same, because you are awakened.

00:50:46.234 --> 00:50:50.955
You, who are part and parcel of that virat are awakened

00:50:50.979 --> 00:50:56.722
and the rest of the people are not awakened.

00:50:56.746 --> 00:51:05.265
Now as there is a heart, a liver, a brain, a spleen

00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:08.372
there are different organs.

00:51:08.396 --> 00:51:14.238
In the same way in Sahajyoga, at every place, each person is appointed.

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:18.836
For example, for Bengal, I had asked about Jalan.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:25.297
" You can do it for Bengal. Are you ready for this?"

00:51:25.321 --> 00:51:27.383
He got ready.

00:51:27.407 --> 00:51:29.854
I told him," You are the leader."

00:51:29.878 --> 00:51:34.638
Now, if there is a leader, the whole responsibility is on him.

00:51:34.662 --> 00:51:41.453
Whatever work you have to do, you talk to that leader about it.

00:51:41.484 --> 00:51:43.235
If the leader does something wrong

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:46.039
I get so much angry with him and set him right.

00:51:46.064 --> 00:51:47.086
That is My responsibility.

00:51:47.111 --> 00:51:50.258
That is not yours, you cannot blame a leader.

00:51:50.282 --> 00:51:53.219
Somebody was talking against a leader

00:51:53.244 --> 00:51:54.820
who happened to be his younger brother.

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:56.817
I could not tolerate that

00:51:56.841 --> 00:51:58.812
and big boils appeared on my back due to the heat.

00:51:58.836 --> 00:52:01.374
I told him, " You're causing boils on my back."

00:52:01.398 --> 00:52:03.101
He was surprised.

00:52:03.125 --> 00:52:06.634
These are My sons whom I have established there

00:52:06.658 --> 00:52:09.462
they are my favourites.

00:52:09.486 --> 00:52:13.684
And don't challenge them, please don't challenge them.

00:52:13.709 --> 00:52:15.246
I am managing them.

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:17.102
My feet are on them.

00:52:17.126 --> 00:52:20.230
Don't disturb them in any way.

00:52:20.254 --> 00:52:23.495
The day they start moving, I will move them Myself.

00:52:23.519 --> 00:52:26.188
That responsibility is on Me not on you.

00:52:26.212 --> 00:52:30.685
This should be understood that he who is the driver of this heart

00:52:30.709 --> 00:52:34.291
If you tell him, you go away, I will be there

00:52:34.315 --> 00:52:37.251
you don't have to compare yourself with them

00:52:37.275 --> 00:52:39.251
because I am watching them.

00:52:39.276 --> 00:52:42.189
I can't check each and every person.

00:52:42.236 --> 00:52:44.742
But through them , I watch everyone

00:52:44.766 --> 00:52:47.376
and I know and recognise them.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.471
And this is a very drawback of Sahajyoga

00:52:50.495 --> 00:52:52.442
that they criticize a leader.

00:52:52.466 --> 00:52:56.775
Criticise him that they become leaders and why did they do so?

00:52:56.799 --> 00:53:00.331
You don't have to judge that, I will judge that.

00:53:00.355 --> 00:53:01.412
And you don't know

00:53:01.437 --> 00:53:03.947
very senior leaders have been thrown out by Sahajyoga.

00:53:03.971 --> 00:53:05.685
Very senior people

00:53:05.716 --> 00:53:09.107
such leaders, whom world would consider

00:53:09.132 --> 00:53:11.267
that they came to Sahaj yoga first of all

00:53:11.292 --> 00:53:12.422
they are great leaders.

00:53:12.446 --> 00:53:15.555
And a leader should be all the more cautious.

00:53:15.579 --> 00:53:17.671
They get caught up beforehand.

00:53:17.696 --> 00:53:18.893
Sometimes, they feel proud of themselves.

00:53:19.003 --> 00:53:22.081
They think of themselves to have become very great people.

00:53:22.106 --> 00:53:23.381
Don't know what they think of themselves.

00:53:23.406 --> 00:53:26.858
Leaders should be very cautious

00:53:26.882 --> 00:53:29.290
that before leaving, we have to unite everyone.

00:53:29.314 --> 00:53:32.743
The man who will try to break it

00:53:32.767 --> 00:53:35.213
and doesn't do the work wisely

00:53:35.237 --> 00:53:37.298
he loses his leadership.

00:53:37.322 --> 00:53:41.266
To take the post of leadership is also a great task of responsibility.

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:45.501
And all of you must understand in collective consciousness

00:53:45.526 --> 00:53:48.117
that Mother has appointed them

00:53:48.141 --> 00:53:51.194
and that you don't have to challenge them.

00:53:51.218 --> 00:53:53.943
There are quarrels between two leaders too.

00:53:53.967 --> 00:53:55.693
This is, AHAM BRAMHAS MI

00:53:55.717 --> 00:54:01.086
Bramha stands up to fight against Bramha.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:02.249
Have seen this also.

00:54:02.273 --> 00:54:04.882
But there should be nothing like this.

00:54:04.906 --> 00:54:06.405
Have an understanding amongst yourselves.

00:54:06.429 --> 00:54:08.554
Mostly people fight over me.

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:10.307
Tell me how bad it is.

00:54:10.331 --> 00:54:12.470
People fight over me.

00:54:12.494 --> 00:54:14.128
Why did you do so to Mother?

00:54:14.153 --> 00:54:16.456
Somebody say, "Why did you do so to Mother"?

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.599
Your Mother is a very strong woman.

00:54:18.624 --> 00:54:20.066
She doesn't have a fixed place.

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:23.115
Today she is here, tomorrow she is there, what fixed place She has?

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.907
Leave Her!

00:54:26.915 --> 00:54:31.015
Nobody can make a fool of Me.

00:54:31.039 --> 00:54:37.598
I appear to be a simple person, innocent but I am very clever.

00:54:37.622 --> 00:54:43.011
Nobody can make a fool of Me. This you try to understand.

00:54:43.035 --> 00:54:45.994
Now, outwardly I pose

00:54:46.018 --> 00:54:47.627
but since I am Mahamaya

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:51.523
keep it in mind that you need not be anxious at all on My account.

00:54:51.547 --> 00:54:53.791
What is the need to take care of Me.

00:54:53.816 --> 00:54:58.450
I Myself take care of you, what is the need to take care of Me?

00:54:58.474 --> 00:55:00.339
Stick to this belief.

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:04.746
Whatever Mother does, there is some reason behind that.

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:07.674
We will have to see what the matter is?

00:55:07.698 --> 00:55:11.361
Because I play a much deeper trick than Krishna.

00:55:11.385 --> 00:55:15.828
Because if we have to get them to Sahajyoga, there is a need to  mince them.

00:55:15.852 --> 00:55:22.504
It has to be churned thoroughly, only then you will come up like ghee.

00:55:22.528 --> 00:55:24.912
Otherwise how will it be done?

00:55:24.936 --> 00:55:29.145
In collectivity when you have collected the whole thing

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:32.426
and you have churned it

00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:38.618
now the whole butter is ready, then what do you do?

00:55:38.665 --> 00:55:41.998
You add a little butter to it.

00:55:42.022 --> 00:55:51.429
Now whatever is collected around that is butter, and the rest is thrown away.

00:55:51.454 --> 00:55:56.850
Shree Mataji says,"Better be seated, everybody gets disturbed."

00:55:56.936 --> 00:56:00.529
So, what you should do to that butter is

00:56:00.639 --> 00:56:06.168
just go on tieing up in one circle

00:56:06.193 --> 00:56:07.583
so that everything goes on clinging to that butter.

00:56:07.608 --> 00:56:09.923
That butter itself is the leader.

00:56:09.947 --> 00:56:16.198
That which will not cling to it, will be destroyed.

00:56:16.222 --> 00:56:21.967
In the same way, Sahajyoga has done the work till now

00:56:21.991 --> 00:56:27.051
and by and by they have become such strong Sahajyogis that you will be surprised.

00:56:27.075 --> 00:56:31.328
but you basically have everything at its base.

00:56:31.353 --> 00:56:35.496
You know you have got heritage, you have Shree Krishna.

00:56:35.535 --> 00:56:39.691
You know everything, there is no need to tell you anything special.

00:56:39.715 --> 00:56:43.356
Your roots are thousand years old.

00:56:43.381 --> 00:56:44.260
There is no need to tell you anything.

00:56:44.284 --> 00:56:45.317
You don't have to do anything.

00:56:45.342 --> 00:56:48.798
I am telling you so about foreign countries

00:56:48.822 --> 00:56:54.758
where we had to start from who is Shree Ganesh ji.

00:56:54.782 --> 00:56:57.868
Is there anything like Ganeshji who do not know?

00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.151
those who don't know about it

00:56:59.215 --> 00:57:01.769
Those who don't know anything even about that

00:57:01.793 --> 00:57:09.742
have become such perfect Sahajyogis that they can give seven lectures about Ganesh Tatwa.

00:57:09.767 --> 00:57:11.955
They learnt Sanskrit, did everything

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.816
went there , read all the books and and have presented it.

00:57:15.841 --> 00:57:20.740
People from Australia have mentioned about Ravinder Babu and sent to Me

00:57:20.765 --> 00:57:22.021
you will be so surprised.

00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:26.648
In which he has mentioned about Ganpatipule, about Mahaganpati.

00:57:26.672 --> 00:57:30.349
Till now no Bengali has given it to Me in writing.

00:57:30.373 --> 00:57:32.563
They are great admirers of Ravinder Babu.

00:57:32.588 --> 00:57:35.348
At least some one should have written about it.

00:57:35.372 --> 00:57:39.301
It has been written from there what has been written by Ravinder Babu

00:57:39.325 --> 00:57:41.294
that Mother has awakened.

00:57:41.319 --> 00:57:44.542
People will come on all shores from here, everyone!

00:57:44.566 --> 00:57:47.198
He was a great seer, he saw this.

00:57:47.222 --> 00:57:50.494
All this description these people have sent to Me in writing.

00:57:50.518 --> 00:57:54.756
So in collectivity, all international people ran about

00:57:54.781 --> 00:57:57.855
and collected whatever was written about it.

00:57:57.879 --> 00:58:02.583
He may be European, Chinese or a Russian

00:58:02.607 --> 00:58:08.758
any one who has talked about Sahajyoga, noted down everything.

00:58:08.799 --> 00:58:10.763
What can be done to support Sahajyoga?

00:58:10.787 --> 00:58:13.328
How can we make Sahajyoga collective?

00:58:13.352 --> 00:58:17.741
Because there is no brotherhood among them.

00:58:17.765 --> 00:58:21.738
Now they have got fed up of that, it is all over.

00:58:21.762 --> 00:58:25.006
There the politics has become just rotten.

00:58:25.031 --> 00:58:27.212
They said, leave it, let us put an end to it.

00:58:27.353 --> 00:58:29.991
They don't have brotherhood.

00:58:30.015 --> 00:58:31.952
Brotherhood is awesome.

00:58:31.976 --> 00:58:34.195
I feel so joyous when I see them

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.883
slapping each other, talking to each other loudly with love.

00:58:37.908 --> 00:58:40.633
I feel such a joy.

00:58:40.657 --> 00:58:45.645
Brotherhood is very important. That itself is collectivity.

00:58:45.669 --> 00:58:51.150
Brotherhood itself is collectivity. You are brothers of each other.

00:58:51.174 --> 00:58:55.091
And a brother quarrels with a brother till he is not a Sahajyogi

00:58:55.115 --> 00:58:57.840
then he understands everything.

00:58:57.864 --> 00:59:00.313
We should do the work which Mother likes.

00:59:00.338 --> 00:59:05.748
Who are we to quarrel with each other?

00:59:05.772 --> 00:59:11.688
And you will face this because there is a curse to our country

00:59:11.713 --> 00:59:15.195
that we are ok when we are alone.

00:59:15.219 --> 00:59:17.385
But when ten assemble, the work is undone.

00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:19.310
Useless!

00:59:19.334 --> 00:59:22.072
The moment you get the solution,you go and you are no more there.

00:59:22.096 --> 00:59:25.665
Till the Indians are single, it is the best.

00:59:25.689 --> 00:59:29.191
If ten assemble, it is a problem.

00:59:29.215 --> 00:59:31.833
It is a curse on us

00:59:31.857 --> 00:59:33.921
and it is said in foreign countries also

00:59:33.945 --> 00:59:36.105
that if ten Japanese will sit for a meeting

00:59:36.129 --> 00:59:40.159
only one man will speak and the rest will nod their heads.

00:59:40.183 --> 00:59:42.654
Rest of them will just nod their heads, they won't speak.

00:59:42.678 --> 00:59:45.544
Whatever they have to say, they will discuss and finalize in the background

00:59:45.568 --> 00:59:49.296
A single word nobody will speak, only one person will say.

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:52.315
And tell Indians to join that meeting

00:59:52.339 --> 00:59:54.277
it seems, that where is the proposal

00:59:54.302 --> 00:59:55.915
they have started mutual dispute.

00:59:55.939 --> 00:59:57.446
You had abused my sister.

00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:59.539
That day you had told my father so and so

00:59:59.563 --> 01:00:00.867
all this starts.

01:00:00.891 --> 01:00:07.004
In international meetings the Indians do so.

01:00:07.028 --> 01:00:10.419
So, there is a great thing in our life

01:00:10.443 --> 01:00:15.994
that is we don't get along with each other.

01:00:16.018 --> 01:00:17.911
Everybody is Bramha swaroop.

01:00:17.935 --> 01:00:20.887
Everyone is superior, Bramh fights with Bramh.

01:00:20.911 --> 01:00:25.493
what to do?

01:00:25.517 --> 01:00:27.824
In our country, there is a saying

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.920
that if there are two utensils they will definitely collide.

01:00:30.945 --> 01:00:32.886
If there are utensils, ok then collide with each other

01:00:32.911 --> 01:00:35.281
but if there are pillars, and they go on colliding

01:00:35.306 --> 01:00:37.817
where will the people sit under it?

01:00:37.841 --> 01:00:39.675
Everyone is not a utensil.

01:00:39.699 --> 01:00:41.273
There should be some pillars as well

01:00:41.297 --> 01:00:46.028
and not only utensils which go on colliding lifelong.

01:00:46.052 --> 01:00:48.325
The disease to collide with each other is very difficult.

01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:51.931
And that is why our collectivity breaks down.

01:00:51.955 --> 01:00:55.274
There are many ways of breaking collectivity

01:00:55.298 --> 01:00:59.516
if we look at these from the practical point of view.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.280
For example, regarding vibrations people say

01:01:02.305 --> 01:01:04.312
your vibrations are not good.

01:01:04.336 --> 01:01:06.818
Suppose a new person has come to your programme.

01:01:06.842 --> 01:01:09.711
Hope that all of you are Sahajyogis.

01:01:09.735 --> 01:01:13.452
What I will say just now, it is sahajyogi's internal matter.

01:01:13.476 --> 01:01:16.871
He told him,"Oh! you are a great bhoot."

01:01:16.895 --> 01:01:20.318
A lady came to Me and told Me

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:21.859
"They tell me that i am a bhoot

01:01:21.883 --> 01:01:23.648
I was not bhoot before coming to Sahajyoga.

01:01:23.672 --> 01:01:27.932
How is it that now i have become bhoot?

01:01:27.956 --> 01:01:29.651
I asked," Who told you, you are a bhoot?"

01:01:29.675 --> 01:01:32.483
"Everybody was saying, you are a bhoot. I have  become a bhoot."

01:01:32.507 --> 01:01:34.165
Started weeping bitterly.

01:01:34.189 --> 01:01:36.669
SM: I said, it is not so! You are not understanding.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:39.144
You should think that

01:01:39.168 --> 01:01:42.573
That person is the same that we were previously.

01:01:42.597 --> 01:01:45.107
Now he is coming to Sahajyoga.

01:01:45.132 --> 01:01:46.572
We are sitting at a higher level.

01:01:46.596 --> 01:01:49.344
While he is coming, if we kick him, how will he climb up?

01:01:49.368 --> 01:01:51.309
You are sitting at a higher level

01:01:51.334 --> 01:01:54.681
pull him by offering your hand down.

01:01:54.705 --> 01:01:59.013
Not because you kick him

01:01:59.037 --> 01:02:03.368
Many people are oversmart, too much over smart.They ride on bulls.

01:02:03.392 --> 01:02:06.790
Mother, sit here, get up here, do this, get up here.

01:02:06.815 --> 01:02:12.296
Then after that, he only can be seen standing and sitting.

01:02:12.406 --> 01:02:18.153
Many people say, Mother said so, Mother said like this.

01:02:18.177 --> 01:02:20.900
Nobody has to say that Mother said so and so..

01:02:20.924 --> 01:02:23.919
You say what you want to say.

01:02:23.943 --> 01:02:26.974
For example, Sanjay said

01:02:26.999 --> 01:02:29.887
In our Geeta it is like this: Sanjay said, Krishna said

01:02:29.911 --> 01:02:31.917
Have you to say anything or not?

01:02:31.941 --> 01:02:33.947
You say what you want to say.

01:02:33.971 --> 01:02:35.461
What do you mean by saying," Mother has said."

01:02:35.486 --> 01:02:37.045
Whatever mother has to say is already known.

01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:38.000
It is already written.

01:02:38.024 --> 01:02:39.867
Why are you talking about your Mother?

01:02:39.891 --> 01:02:42.150
They say even contrary to what Mother has said.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:43.811
Mother had said so.

01:02:43.835 --> 01:02:46.780
Now people feel that Mother must have said so.

01:02:46.804 --> 01:02:48.128
Mother, had you said so?

01:02:48.152 --> 01:02:50.388
I told them, I can't say so.

01:02:50.412 --> 01:02:51.642
There is something wrong in it.

01:02:51.666 --> 01:02:53.946
By and by after being in contact with Me

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:56.181
You will understand My style.

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:59.351
Then you will understand that Mother cannot say so.

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:02.899
This is not possible. We will have to tell Mother in a round about way.

01:03:02.923 --> 01:03:04.234
They will come out of it.

01:03:04.258 --> 01:03:05.829
She is not going to be trapped into it.

01:03:05.853 --> 01:03:08.586
But people do it.

01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:09.811
Mother had said.

01:03:09.835 --> 01:03:10.923
There are many people

01:03:10.947 --> 01:03:13.368
for example, Oh! that Rajeev

01:03:13.392 --> 01:03:14.255
yes, who?

01:03:14.279 --> 01:03:16.401
He who is Prime Minister.

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:18.928
Ok! He had come to my house yesterday.

01:03:18.952 --> 01:03:21.177
Yesterday, he was in London.

01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:25.451
No, no, no, no, not yesterday, He had come to me one month back.

01:03:25.475 --> 01:03:26.684
Ok, then what about him?

01:03:26.708 --> 01:03:30.611
He said , "I am going to appoint you as a minister shortly."

01:03:30.635 --> 01:03:32.914
Ok! which portfolio will be assigned to you?

01:03:32.938 --> 01:03:36.730
About that i have planned that i will become finance minister.

01:03:36.754 --> 01:03:37.993
I told him, it is a good news.

01:03:38.018 --> 01:03:40.635
If you become finance minister, it will be beneficial for us.

01:03:40.659 --> 01:03:44.204
Now whatever the income tax we pay, you will not do anything to us.

01:03:44.228 --> 01:03:46.900
I don't have any income, still

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:48.090
No Sahib.

01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:50.930
There is no income tax involved with regard to finance ministry.

01:03:50.954 --> 01:03:52.681
I asked, then what does it do?

01:03:52.706 --> 01:03:54.159
It takes care of farming.

01:03:54.184 --> 01:03:59.367
I told him, "Then you will surely be the minister."

01:03:59.391 --> 01:04:02.431
This is the habit of the people of our country.

01:04:02.455 --> 01:04:04.829
And we too have got the habit of listening.

01:04:04.853 --> 01:04:07.227
Ok! Ok! You are surely going to be the finance minister.

01:04:07.251 --> 01:04:09.531
People usually go on talking like this.

01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:11.514
The same way, they do about Mother.

01:04:11.538 --> 01:04:12.935
I am a poor woman.

01:04:12.959 --> 01:04:15.094
I am a very ordinary, very simple person.

01:04:15.118 --> 01:04:18.107
If you tell Me, I can even roll down and sleep here.

01:04:18.131 --> 01:04:25.589
No body can harm Me in the least.

01:04:25.613 --> 01:04:27.044
Everyone speaks ill of others.

01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:28.894
Who is such in our country whom we do not speak ill of?

01:04:28.918 --> 01:04:30.465
We are smart in doing that.

01:04:30.489 --> 01:04:33.126
If you want to speak ill of anyone, go to India

01:04:33.151 --> 01:04:35.028
Wow! advertisements will be put up.

01:04:35.052 --> 01:04:37.066
He has this drawback, the other one has that drawback.

01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:40.106
One gentleman asked Me, "You are married, why do you wear white sari?"

01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:43.144
I told him,"I am wearing it given to Me by My husband, not by you."

01:04:43.168 --> 01:04:51.984
Laughter

01:04:52.008 --> 01:04:54.345
Everything will be criticized.

01:04:54.369 --> 01:04:58.840
Why is She like this, like that? How are you concerned?

01:04:58.964 --> 01:05:03.517
And we don't criticize them.

01:05:03.541 --> 01:05:04.719
Never!

01:05:04.743 --> 01:05:08.136
But what happens is that they start trembling.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.202
And those whom they want to criticize, they do it openly.

01:05:11.226 --> 01:05:16.341
I am not going to run away on account of being afraid of anyone.

01:05:16.365 --> 01:05:19.423
Whatever is wrong, I will definitely tell.

01:05:19.447 --> 01:05:22.293
But if I don't have to tell anyone

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:26.583
I make him understand with love and affection.

01:05:26.608 --> 01:05:27.614
This is called discretion.

01:05:27.638 --> 01:05:30.882
And when a man gets this sense of discretion

01:05:30.906 --> 01:05:33.209
then I consider him as a sahajyogi.

01:05:33.233 --> 01:05:41.916
We have one leader in our room, named MEDO.

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:44.243
I have lot of regard for him.

01:05:44.267 --> 01:05:52.345
Because he is like a very resolved and balanced sage.

01:05:52.369 --> 01:05:57.023
And he understands so much and there is so much seriousness in him

01:05:57.047 --> 01:06:01.551
Till now he did not create any problem for Me.

01:06:01.576 --> 01:06:05.305
And in everything, he solves a problem like this.

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:10.273
And in the whole of Europe, even better than your India.

01:06:10.297 --> 01:06:15.792
You will be surprised that our work has been done in Italy.

01:06:15.816 --> 01:06:22.671
We got a lot of publicity in all the televisions there.

01:06:22.695 --> 01:06:27.927
There the municpalities, where we go.

01:06:27.951 --> 01:06:33.337
They print our photographs and paste advertisements themselves.

01:06:33.361 --> 01:06:36.054
When are we going to have such days here?

01:06:36.078 --> 01:06:39.584
And the Mayor of that place himself comes to see Me.

01:06:39.608 --> 01:06:42.388
Not only this, now they are going to print a book

01:06:42.413 --> 01:06:50.701
in which six great people of modern age, who are Italians

01:06:50.726 --> 01:06:52.388
are publishing about them.

01:06:52.412 --> 01:06:58.371
They are also publishing about the Vice Premier of that place.

01:06:58.426 --> 01:06:59.426
They are six people.

01:06:59.451 --> 01:07:02.780
And there is a great writer, they are publishing about him too.

01:07:02.804 --> 01:07:09.184
And I who is not an Italian, they are publishing about Me too in that book.

01:07:09.209 --> 01:07:12.158
It is not possible in your country.

01:07:12.182 --> 01:07:14.705
Just now Times of India will come

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:17.756
and will publish something wrong about Me

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:20.485
as if they are our great saviours

01:07:20.509 --> 01:07:22.175
as if I am snatching something from you

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.072
and they are great care takers.

01:07:26.096 --> 01:07:29.939
And they will offend just over trivial issues.

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:32.602
In Italy no body has this type of habit in the least.

01:07:32.626 --> 01:07:35.613
And if I don't go to somebody's house, they will feel offended.

01:07:35.637 --> 01:07:40.624
It is not your house, it is only My house!

01:07:40.648 --> 01:07:42.079
Then why do you feel bad?

01:07:42.103 --> 01:07:44.076
Come to My house, come to My house!

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.450
As long as this love lasts

01:07:45.474 --> 01:07:46.359
it is too much in Indians.

01:07:46.383 --> 01:07:47.796
Come to my house.

01:07:47.821 --> 01:07:50.069
This is against collectivity.

01:07:50.093 --> 01:07:51.796
Which one is My house?

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:56.764
Wherever I am, that is My house.

01:07:56.788 --> 01:07:58.608
Come to my house, come to my house.

01:07:58.633 --> 01:08:01.112
Every one says, come to my house.

01:08:01.136 --> 01:08:03.447
Till this feeling of mine will not go away

01:08:03.471 --> 01:08:06.267
this collectivity will not be there.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:08.447
These are my sons, my children.

01:08:08.471 --> 01:08:10.189
This is my husband, my home.

01:08:10.213 --> 01:08:11.293
This is my car.

01:08:11.318 --> 01:08:13.660
In this you have to give up the 'mineness'.

01:08:13.684 --> 01:08:15.395
You should give up attatchment.

01:08:15.419 --> 01:08:19.120
It comes to man from darkness, from ignorance.

01:08:19.144 --> 01:08:20.800
This is ignorance.

01:08:20.824 --> 01:08:23.088
Be away from this ignorance.

01:08:23.112 --> 01:08:26.383
The speciality about collectivity is that

01:08:26.408 --> 01:08:31.994
you can know other's vibrations and also your vibrations.

01:08:32.018 --> 01:08:35.737
But the discretion is that

01:08:35.761 --> 01:08:38.613
don't tell which vibrations of others are bad.

01:08:38.638 --> 01:08:42.813
Be in bandhan, in Mother's bandhan, be in Nirvicharita

01:08:42.837 --> 01:08:44.316
nobody can harm you.

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:47.964
You keep any mighty ghost in front of Me.

01:08:47.988 --> 01:08:50.022
If I don't want

01:08:50.047 --> 01:08:57.165
he has no right, no power that I should invest My money.

01:08:57.189 --> 01:09:01.297
But if I, out of kindness, take away his problem, I can do so.

01:09:01.321 --> 01:09:04.430
Then I suffer for a little while, doesn't matter.

01:09:04.454 --> 01:09:07.835
I look at Myself in the witness state.

01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:12.842
So, one who wants to be Sahajyogi of a higher level

01:09:12.866 --> 01:09:16.640
he has to look slowly slowly internally to his own self

01:09:16.664 --> 01:09:19.709
and outwardly to give to others.

01:09:19.734 --> 01:09:21.642
These two hands are collectivity.

01:09:21.667 --> 01:09:29.343
Because the plexus we have here(Shree Mataji points to Her vishudhi) are called survical plexus.

01:09:29.368 --> 01:09:30.197
It flows from there.

01:09:30.221 --> 01:09:33.463
If you don't feel vibrations in your hands

01:09:33.488 --> 01:09:35.852
you should understand that there is something missing in your collectivity.

01:09:35.876 --> 01:09:38.694
Here the peetha is of our Vishuddhi Chakra ( Shree Mataji points to the center and top of Her forehead)

01:09:38.718 --> 01:09:40.406
which is the place of Virata.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:51.621
If you rotate this Virata, your collectivity will increase.

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:52.992
I had been to Nepal.

01:09:53.016 --> 01:09:55.774
Everybody had applied kumkum here also.(Shree Mataji points to Her Virata Chakra)

01:09:55.798 --> 01:09:57.655
I asked, "Why do you apply here?"

01:09:57.679 --> 01:10:00.248
They said (Pointing to Hamsa Chakra) here we apply for Shiv ji

01:10:00.273 --> 01:10:03.428
and (Pointing to Virata chakra) here for Krishna.

01:10:03.452 --> 01:10:05.546
This is the place of Virata.

01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:09.595
You rotate here (Virat chakra) a little, you will feel lighter here.

01:10:09.619 --> 01:10:12.891
This is the place of Virata.

01:10:12.915 --> 01:10:14.758
This is his peetha.

01:10:14.782 --> 01:10:20.610
Shri Krishna reaches here and comes to His Virata state.

01:10:20.634 --> 01:10:23.812
Mohommad Sahab said ,"Alla Ho Akbar!"

01:10:23.836 --> 01:10:26.140
Akbar is Virat.

01:10:26.164 --> 01:10:29.006
He talked about Akbar, that Akbar is Virat.

01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:31.721
He talked about Shree Krishna.

01:10:31.745 --> 01:10:35.626
He called Allah to Shree Krishna.

01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:40.940
And He whom he calls Kareem, is Shivji.

01:10:40.964 --> 01:10:43.439
He called them by different names.

01:10:43.463 --> 01:10:48.926
He called One Allah, and the other one Kareem.

01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:53.113
He calls one Rahim and the other one Kareem.

01:10:53.137 --> 01:10:55.234
And in the same way

01:10:55.328 --> 01:10:58.967
they individually named all of them

01:10:58.992 --> 01:11:01.320
and changed the name a little bit.

01:11:01.344 --> 01:11:04.971
And whatever was understood in that language in Arabic was given that name.

01:11:04.995 --> 01:11:07.859
But its mantra is Allaho Akbar.

01:11:07.883 --> 01:11:11.012
With this finger (Index Finger) which you know is of Shree Krishna

01:11:12.296 --> 01:11:15.197
put your finger in your ears, put your head backward

01:11:15.222 --> 01:11:17.083
and say Allaho Akbar sixteen times

01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:21.629
your collectivity will awaken.

01:11:21.653 --> 01:11:26.581
Everyone will have to become Muslim a little.

01:11:26.605 --> 01:11:30.132
Muslim means to surrender.

01:11:30.156 --> 01:11:35.788
Poor people worked very hard for Arabs, but they remained only donkeys.

01:11:35.812 --> 01:11:38.834
How much have I worked hard for you

01:11:38.858 --> 01:11:42.079
but you are involved in ritualism and this and that.

01:11:42.103 --> 01:11:48.855
After coming out of this mud, you have to become lotus.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.718
And the quality of lotus is that

01:11:50.743 --> 01:11:53.418
it passes on fragrance to the whole world.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:59.278
While giving it, he doesn't think whom he is passing on the fragrance

01:11:59.302 --> 01:12:01.159
but at his own time he thinks

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:03.530
that there should be no flaw in my fragrance.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.927
There should be no flaw.

01:12:04.952 --> 01:12:07.508
People on seeing must say

01:12:07.533 --> 01:12:09.962
A person need not speak of his qualities.

01:12:09.986 --> 01:12:11.605
This is Musk.

01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:14.322
Whatever you say, it is musk.

01:12:14.346 --> 01:12:22.815
We cannot agree that it is not Musk, because we are getting fragrance.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:26.395
What is need to take an oath for a fragrant person?

01:12:26.419 --> 01:12:27.925
He is fragrant.

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:31.090
With that fragrance only people will come to you.

01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:36.475
No matter how far a Bumble bee may be, he will have to return back.

01:12:36.499 --> 01:12:41.469
Because when you have fragrance, everybody will come to you.

01:12:41.493 --> 01:12:43.436
And to keep this fragrance alive

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:47.583
how is internal transformation connected with external yoga transformation

01:12:47.607 --> 01:12:49.567
try to understand this in collectivity.

01:12:49.591 --> 01:12:52.488
keep yourself attatched to collectivity

01:12:52.512 --> 01:12:57.913
and please after coming to the center, alleviate the center.

01:12:57.937 --> 01:12:59.688
By staying out of it

01:12:59.712 --> 01:13:02.257
now you are rich people, may be of the world!

01:13:02.281 --> 01:13:06.115
But for God, you are one and the same.

01:13:06.139 --> 01:13:08.358
Another thing to learn from Muslims is that

01:13:08.382 --> 01:13:11.078
he may be a king or anyone else

01:13:11.102 --> 01:13:15.291
while offering Namaz, a person will stand wherever he gets a space.

01:13:15.315 --> 01:13:17.103
Not that there is a special place for a king.

01:13:17.127 --> 01:13:22.238
Never!

01:13:22.262 --> 01:13:24.938
He may be a king or a beggar.

01:13:24.962 --> 01:13:26.243
All of them will stand in one line.

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:29.606
If a beggar comes first, he will be the first of all in the line.

01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:33.168
This they have set as an example to learn from them.

01:13:33.192 --> 01:13:34.847
We should learn that.

01:13:34.871 --> 01:13:36.811
And in our country

01:13:36.835 --> 01:13:41.625
it is believed that this is higher and this is lower.

01:13:41.649 --> 01:13:46.601
For this there are numerous examples

01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:49.965
that Shree Krishna took his meals at the house of Vidhur.

01:13:49.989 --> 01:13:52.346
Who was Vidhur?

01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:55.182
The son of a charioteer!

01:13:55.206 --> 01:13:56.639
Who was Karan?

01:13:56.702 --> 01:13:57.991
The son of a  charioteer!

01:13:58.027 --> 01:14:00.696
Even to Karan they respected so much.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.951
Vidhur, who belonged to a Shudra tribe

01:14:04.975 --> 01:14:07.147
what was the need to go and to have his dinner at his house?

01:14:07.171 --> 01:14:09.619
He (Shree Krishna) discarded Dhuryodan's nuts

01:14:09.643 --> 01:14:11.666
and took green leafy vegetable at Vidhur's house.

01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:12.695
Why did he take?

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:17.551
to show that a sahajyogi is a yogi

01:14:17.575 --> 01:14:21.925
who are great saints sitting in the court of God.

01:14:21.949 --> 01:14:26.016
Nobody is greater than them.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.568
Previously it was a rule

01:14:28.592 --> 01:14:33.707
that if a saint would come, the king would stand up and stand separately.

01:14:33.731 --> 01:14:35.937
It (this rule) was prominent till Shivaji reigned.

01:14:35.962 --> 01:14:38.492
After that don't know what happened in our country.

01:14:38.516 --> 01:14:42.280
Once Ramdas Swami went to king Shivaji's residence

01:14:42.304 --> 01:14:45.201
And said," Jai! Jai! Raghuveer Samarth."

01:14:45.225 --> 01:14:49.879
When he reached, Shivaji wrote a letter.

01:14:49.904 --> 01:14:57.355
In that letter he wrote,"Your majesty, all this whatever it is

01:14:57.379 --> 01:15:02.717
is my wealth, is my power and is my empire

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.645
this is only what i can offer to you.

01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:07.554
I have nothing else to give to you.

01:15:07.578 --> 01:15:12.156
He read it, saw it, stood on the bottom of doorway

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:16.352
And said," Shiva! I am an ascetic

01:15:16.377 --> 01:15:18.182
what shall i get from you and what shall you give to me?"

01:15:18.206 --> 01:15:19.554
Can't give anything to an ascetic.

01:15:19.578 --> 01:15:21.434
I am an ascetic!

01:15:21.458 --> 01:15:24.620
But what you said is true.

01:15:24.644 --> 01:15:26.123
So do one thing.

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:30.611
Make flag of my safron coloured chest.

01:15:30.636 --> 01:15:33.572
The same saffron flag is there today.

01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:38.250
That means there are many atrocities going on under that flag of stupidity.

01:15:38.274 --> 01:15:42.343
But there is Shri Ram Das Swami's role behind it.

01:15:42.367 --> 01:15:44.826
Shivaji Maharaj was a king.

01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:47.317
But he went to Tukaram's house.

01:15:47.341 --> 01:15:52.119
And for his wife, he took lot of clothes and jewellery.

01:15:52.144 --> 01:15:53.559
His wife was very happy to see this

01:15:53.584 --> 01:15:55.673
as she had never seen such a beautiful jewellery.

01:15:55.697 --> 01:15:58.097
In the mean time, Tukaram came.

01:15:58.121 --> 01:15:59.498
He (Shivaji) hid himself behind him (Tukaram).

01:15:59.522 --> 01:16:00.754
He (Tukaram) asked his wife,'Who gave this?"

01:16:00.779 --> 01:16:03.008
She said that Shivaji Maharaj has sent all this .

01:16:03.032 --> 01:16:05.853
He said,"You see, you are my wife.

01:16:05.877 --> 01:16:09.745
If I were a king, it would look good if you wore this.

01:16:09.769 --> 01:16:13.973
Now I am an ordinary farmer

01:16:13.998 --> 01:16:15.348
and you should live like that.

01:16:15.372 --> 01:16:16.845
You return this to him."

01:16:16.869 --> 01:16:21.708
King Shivaji came and kept his turban at his feet.

01:16:21.732 --> 01:16:25.746
Your Majesty, what can we give to you?

01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:30.443
As such, people like Shivaji Maharaj are kings in the true sense.

01:16:30.468 --> 01:16:33.282
They only can understand a king.

01:16:33.306 --> 01:16:35.891
Sages and Saints are no doubt kings

01:16:35.915 --> 01:16:39.136
because they don't respect anything.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.207
they don't need anything.

01:16:41.231 --> 01:16:42.548
Put them to sleep anywhere.

01:16:42.573 --> 01:16:42.853
They have gone to sleep.

01:16:42.878 --> 01:16:43.868
What do they need?

01:16:43.893 --> 01:16:44.783
Who is there to tell them anything?

01:16:44.808 --> 01:16:46.931
I am sitting in My queenship.

01:16:46.955 --> 01:16:48.783
Wherever I am sitting, I am sitting.

01:16:48.807 --> 01:16:51.282
Who are you to give to Me?

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:54.211
This is real kingship

01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:56.533
and you too join this kingship.

01:16:56.557 --> 01:16:59.043
and those who consider themselves kings

01:16:59.067 --> 01:17:01.769
they try to understand that real kingship is this itself.

01:17:01.793 --> 01:17:03.428
If you want to get innate (knowledge)

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:07.468
by joining it your collectivity will become stronger.

01:17:07.492 --> 01:17:10.246
You don't have to see the defects of each other.

01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:13.301
This is possible by loving each other

01:17:13.325 --> 01:17:15.396
see the good of each other

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:18.506
by fraternizing with each other through brotherhood

01:17:18.531 --> 01:17:21.270
by creating brotherly bond.

01:17:21.294 --> 01:17:23.988
May God give wisdom to all of you!

01:17:24.012 --> 01:17:26.910
And it has lot of fun.

01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:30.344
The greatest fun of collectivity is that

01:17:30.369 --> 01:17:33.564
if you have to do anything for Me.

01:17:33.588 --> 01:17:35.798
Don't fight with each other at all.

01:17:35.822 --> 01:17:38.800
I feel very sad. It gives Me lot of pain.

01:17:38.824 --> 01:17:41.231
If I come to know that someone got upset

01:17:41.255 --> 01:17:43.101
got angry at someone and had a fight

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:44.404
then I feel very sad.

01:17:44.428 --> 01:17:46.187
If you have to do anything for Me

01:17:46.211 --> 01:17:48.168
love each other very much.

01:17:48.192 --> 01:17:50.805
I only want that all My children amongst themselves

01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:57.487
should with great love, happiness and sensibility, keep each other in mind.

01:17:57.511 --> 01:18:03.368
We are about to start a very beautiful New Era.

01:18:03.392 --> 01:18:10.352
May God give wisdom to all of you!

01:18:10.376 --> 01:18:11.991
If you have some question, please ask.

01:18:12.015 --> 01:18:14.732
Because it is high time for you all to leave

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:16.740
it is quarter to nine

01:18:16.764 --> 01:18:18.721
you leave at nine o'clock.

01:18:18.745 --> 01:18:25.958
Ok, if there is any question, please ask. Give Me water.

01:18:25.982 --> 01:18:28.107
If you have any question, you should ask it now.

01:18:28.131 --> 01:18:31.769
What is the use of asking after I go?

01:18:31.793 --> 01:18:37.247
After that everything happens.

01:18:37.271 --> 01:18:44.240
Yes, ask now.

01:18:44.264 --> 01:18:47.990
Now ask.

01:18:48.014 --> 01:18:51.028
Give Me water.

01:18:51.052 --> 01:18:55.066
Now you switch on the fan.

01:18:55.090 --> 01:19:00.641
You do one thing, you give in writing, they will read it aloud.

01:19:00.665 --> 01:19:01.799
No, no, it is ok

01:19:01.824 --> 01:19:03.999
There is no need to speak loudly, I will tell you.

01:19:04.023 --> 01:19:05.018
You see to it.

01:19:05.042 --> 01:19:07.530
You read aloud the question.

01:19:07.554 --> 01:19:08.435
Keep it here.

01:19:08.459 --> 01:19:09.528
You sit down.

01:19:09.552 --> 01:19:10.959
Write it down.

01:19:10.983 --> 01:19:12.457
Bring it in writing, My dear, give it in writing.

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:13.847
Take paper and pencil.

01:19:13.871 --> 01:19:19.198
To ask question you should bring paper and pencil.

01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:23.022
Satyanarayan ji Kejriwal

01:19:23.046 --> 01:19:36.492
I am hanging like a tissue, please tell me how to win (your) heart.

01:19:36.516 --> 01:19:38.479
How do you know you are hung up?

01:19:38.503 --> 01:19:43.268
(Not Clear) Please sit in the front.

01:19:43.292 --> 01:19:45.903
Who are you hanging between?

01:19:45.927 --> 01:19:52.147
What?

01:19:52.171 --> 01:20:05.042
Tell me the solution to conquer the mind.

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:08.439
OKay! you go in for meditation.

01:20:08.463 --> 01:20:12.186
In meditation, kundalini awakening

01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:14.699
The thoughts we live on

01:20:14.723 --> 01:20:16.294
we should be away from that and come to vilamb (a little space between thoughts).

01:20:16.318 --> 01:20:18.821
The space that is between thoughts

01:20:18.846 --> 01:20:20.973
you should stay there.

01:20:20.997 --> 01:20:22.886
It is a situation.

01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:25.150
There is no solution for it.

01:20:25.174 --> 01:20:27.090
This is a situation that should take place within us.

01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:30.977
It will be through meditation.

01:20:31.001 --> 01:20:34.446
You learn how to meditate.

01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:39.750
In a simple way I tell you that you take My photograph.

01:20:39.774 --> 01:20:41.514
It should not have a black frame.

01:20:41.538 --> 01:20:45.795
In Kaliyuga, we do not use black.

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:50.466
You lit a lamp or a candle.

01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:56.088
Now a days there is no restriction that you lit a lamp using pure ghee.

01:20:56.112 --> 01:20:57.884
Candles are cheaper.

01:20:57.908 --> 01:21:00.532
You lit it.

01:21:00.556 --> 01:21:04.282
Sahaja Yoga is done with the cheapest products.

01:21:04.306 --> 01:21:08.318
Put your left hand towards that (light)

01:21:08.342 --> 01:21:11.366
and right hand on Mother Earth.

01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:15.748
keep it now.

01:21:15.772 --> 01:21:18.171
And after that observe

01:21:18.196 --> 01:21:20.434
if you are getting cool breeze in the left hand or not.

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:23.233
left hand towards Me and right hand like this (Towards Mother Earth)

01:21:23.257 --> 01:21:26.067
Now there is no need of keeping a photo because I am sitting here.

01:21:26.091 --> 01:21:31.846
Many people bow down to photograph even when I am here.

01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:41.161
And I go on watching, where are they going?

01:21:41.185 --> 01:21:46.647
It happens doesn't it? Many wise people do so.

01:21:46.671 --> 01:21:52.231
Now keep your left hand towards Me and right hand on Mother Earth.

01:21:52.255 --> 01:21:55.085
By keeping right hand on Mother Earth

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:59.278
this Mother Earth sucks everything.

01:21:59.303 --> 01:22:00.536
First of all, bow your head to it.

01:22:00.561 --> 01:22:02.040
This is a wonderful thing.

01:22:02.064 --> 01:22:03.923
Bow your head three times.

01:22:03.947 --> 01:22:05.681
Now put your right hand (towards Mother Earth).

01:22:05.705 --> 01:22:08.035
Now say, Mother suck every thing of mine.

01:22:08.059 --> 01:22:27.377
See it will go.....khat khat khat, into the Mother Earth.

01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:31.743
Now watch, is it going? Are you feeling it in your hands?

01:22:31.767 --> 01:22:33.816
If you are not getting it

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.101
then you should work on left hand.

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:38.813
As far as possible, first of all you should get it in left hand.

01:22:38.838 --> 01:22:40.555
slowly slowly work for one finger

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:43.839
then second finger, then third, then fourth, then fifth

01:22:43.863 --> 01:22:45.981
wait for half an hour.

01:22:46.005 --> 01:22:47.526
Till you don't get cool, sit there only.

01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:49.947
Sit for one day, sit for two days.

01:22:49.971 --> 01:22:52.767
By and by you will get cool.

01:22:52.791 --> 01:22:56.045
You will get cool from that candle.

01:22:56.069 --> 01:23:00.914
After that, once the left side is fixed, fix the right side.

01:23:00.938 --> 01:23:04.703
Whoever's left side is fine, start from the right side.

01:23:04.727 --> 01:23:09.895
For right side, take a little water.

01:23:09.919 --> 01:23:12.785
Now a days you can get of plastic, very cheap.

01:23:12.809 --> 01:23:15.065
What is that called? Bowl.

01:23:15.089 --> 01:23:19.827
Tub, not a big one, a small one.

01:23:19.851 --> 01:23:22.631
Put a little salt into it.

01:23:22.655 --> 01:23:27.116
Take cold water.

01:23:27.141 --> 01:23:29.629
A little bit luke warm in winters.

01:23:29.653 --> 01:23:36.932
And put right hand towards photo.

01:23:36.956 --> 01:23:39.255
And left hand like this (shree Mataji shows towards Ether).

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.146
Don't use light now.

01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:46.339
Because a right sided person has too much light, more than required.

01:23:46.363 --> 01:23:49.135
the Sun channel is working there.

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.119
it should be reduced.

01:23:52.143 --> 01:23:56.673
You do it in the Chandrama (channel) not in Sun Channel.

01:23:56.697 --> 01:24:01.304
You can recite even the mantra of Chandrama.

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:05.958
You can recite the Mahakali mantra for the right side.

01:24:05.982 --> 01:24:09.101
You can say the mantra of Himalaya as well.

01:24:09.125 --> 01:24:12.561
And for left side, you should say the Gayatri mantra.

01:24:12.585 --> 01:24:15.535
But when you start getting even in this (Shree Mataji shows towards right hand)

01:24:15.559 --> 01:24:17.058
Now many people will get from below (the arm)

01:24:17.082 --> 01:24:19.234
They will feel that coolness is coming from below.

01:24:19.258 --> 01:24:22.499
It means that you had gone to some wrong Guru.

01:24:22.523 --> 01:24:23.846
It is someone's misconception.

01:24:23.871 --> 01:24:24.868
Vibrations are coming.

01:24:24.892 --> 01:24:26.461
lift it up like this (Shree Mataji Shows).

01:24:26.485 --> 01:24:31.404
Maa, we know only you! Say like this three times.

01:24:31.428 --> 01:24:35.388
We believe in you only and you only are our Guru.

01:24:35.412 --> 01:24:38.471
So, if some dosha has come from some Guru, it goes away.

01:24:38.495 --> 01:24:41.090
Lift it and bring it here (Shree Mataji shows with Her hand).

01:24:41.114 --> 01:24:42.921
You only are our Guru.

01:24:42.945 --> 01:24:48.973
Although I am not a Guru, but what is the harm in saying that?

01:24:48.998 --> 01:24:52.380
Pick it up from here and bring it here (Shree Mataji shows with Her hand).

01:24:52.443 --> 01:24:54.956
This will fix your right side.

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:57.643
You did this only at your back side.

01:24:57.667 --> 01:25:03.251
It doesn't make any sense.

01:25:03.275 --> 01:25:05.912
Not even the air is coming towards Me.

01:25:05.936 --> 01:25:07.725
Just for a little while.

01:25:07.749 --> 01:25:08.889
Forward it .

01:25:08.913 --> 01:25:25.808
Please move it a little this side.

01:25:25.832 --> 01:25:32.900
It is coming, now it is okay.

01:25:32.924 --> 01:25:39.359
After that you put both the hands towards photo.

01:25:39.383 --> 01:25:41.148
And you lit the lamp as well.

01:25:41.172 --> 01:25:43.350
And put your feet in water.

01:25:43.374 --> 01:25:45.444
When your both the hands are okay.

01:25:45.468 --> 01:25:51.505
Daily in the evening, even if you do it for 5 minutes, all the heat will go.

01:25:51.529 --> 01:25:53.451
It is very comforting.

01:25:53.475 --> 01:25:55.540
Whatever may happen, this you should do.

01:25:55.565 --> 01:25:57.442
Just as we do not give up our food

01:25:57.467 --> 01:26:00.203
the same way, we should do it in any case.

01:26:00.227 --> 01:26:02.638
Because, this is meditation.

01:26:02.663 --> 01:26:07.133
Then in the morning, with folded hands in front of the photo

01:26:07.157 --> 01:26:09.390
just meditate for 5 minutes

01:26:09.414 --> 01:26:14.709
Say , Mother please take me to collective consciousness.

01:26:14.733 --> 01:26:19.802
Plz take me to Nirvichar Samadhi.

01:26:19.826 --> 01:26:25.366
By saying so, whatever you will order for, I will do that.

01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:28.564
If you have a problem in your hand, say, Mother please come in My hand.

01:26:28.588 --> 01:26:30.248
Mother , please come to My head.

01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:35.842
Wherever you will ask for , I will come.

01:26:35.866 --> 01:26:38.319
If your relative is sick

01:26:38.343 --> 01:26:43.099
Say, my relative is sick, he is a nice man, gentle man, please cure him.

01:26:43.123 --> 01:26:44.700
I will cure him.

01:26:44.724 --> 01:26:46.194
Whatever you want to say

01:26:46.219 --> 01:26:48.683
I am your servant.

01:26:48.707 --> 01:26:52.518
And if you are being bothered by someone

01:26:52.542 --> 01:26:55.476
just write his name falsely (on your hand)

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.424
and give bandhan like this (Shree Mataji rotates Her right Hand on Her left hand).

01:26:57.449 --> 01:27:01.604
One, two and three. These are the bandhans of love, power of love.

01:27:01.628 --> 01:27:05.787
That power of love is so amazing

01:27:05.812 --> 01:27:07.104
that t

01:27:07.128 --> 01:27:09.500
he man who was about to attack you with a stitck

01:27:09.525 --> 01:27:11.028
will come with a garland.

01:27:11.052 --> 01:27:12.425
You do it.

01:27:12.449 --> 01:27:16.793
There is no harm in trying.

01:27:16.817 --> 01:27:20.935
Because till now we have not used the power of love

01:27:20.959 --> 01:27:22.680
we have used only of hatered.

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.681
Try using the power of love.

01:27:26.705 --> 01:27:30.748
Its use is very powerful.

01:27:30.772 --> 01:27:33.489
So do like this, Maa, Maa, Maa.

01:27:33.513 --> 01:27:35.794
Do it thrice, Maa, Maa,Maa.

01:27:35.818 --> 01:27:38.316
Mataji, Mataji, Mataji

01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:39.866
The job is over.

01:27:39.891 --> 01:27:42.479
Mataji kas taken charge of him.

01:27:42.503 --> 01:27:46.697
By doing this you will be in meditation

01:27:46.721 --> 01:27:52.784
Then you should come to the center, whatever it may be.

01:27:52.808 --> 01:27:54.247
Don't make excuses.

01:27:54.271 --> 01:27:56.073
In the beginning, make it a habit.

01:27:56.097 --> 01:27:58.564
Just like, to get into the habit of drinking

01:27:58.588 --> 01:28:00.830
people are first dragged into the bar.

01:28:00.857 --> 01:28:03.762
When it becomes a habit, you cannot give up bar.

01:28:03.786 --> 01:28:08.502
This court of God's love will not be missed either.

01:28:08.526 --> 01:28:10.270
You won't enjoy without it.

01:28:10.294 --> 01:28:13.530
After that your friend circle will change.

01:28:13.554 --> 01:28:16.594
Your conversation will change. You will talk about Sahajyoga only.

01:28:16.618 --> 01:28:18.321
You won't talk about anything else.

01:28:18.346 --> 01:28:19.999
You won't enjoy it (other than Sahajyoga talk).

01:28:20.023 --> 01:28:22.982
Because when you get the nectar, who will talk about nonsense things.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.286
Leave it!

01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:27.090
You will feel as if you have wasted your life so long.

01:28:27.114 --> 01:28:29.015
Now our friends have changed.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.042
Now it's just fun.

01:28:31.066 --> 01:28:34.146
And people will get impressed by your character only

01:28:34.171 --> 01:28:35.901
and will see that you are something great.

01:28:35.925 --> 01:28:37.775
A kind of glow appears on the face

01:28:37.799 --> 01:28:39.617
it has already come.

01:28:39.641 --> 01:28:43.483
Just on seeing that only , people are taken aback.

01:28:43.507 --> 01:28:47.001
For example, in a city like london

01:28:47.025 --> 01:28:49.348
when Sahajyogis come to the airport, people go on watching them.

01:28:49.372 --> 01:28:51.140
How is it that they have such amazing faces?

01:28:51.165 --> 01:28:57.501
Such a clean face, shine and glow like a lotus.

01:28:57.525 --> 01:29:02.053
The shadow on their face is always like this colour.

01:29:02.077 --> 01:29:06.450
Everybody says, where are they and where from they are coming?

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:10.318
Impressed by your personality only, people will come and nothing else.

01:29:10.342 --> 01:29:12.032
And be peaceful!

01:29:12.056 --> 01:29:15.976
If like other people you too go on grumbling, then they won't recognise you.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:23.200
Peacefully you say, it is like this, it is like this.

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:27.993
Shree Mataji, four questions are related to each other.

01:29:28.017 --> 01:29:32.124
Okay, just tell Me only one.

01:29:32.148 --> 01:29:33.678
NOT CLEAR

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:35.482
OK! OK ! read it.

01:29:35.506 --> 01:29:37.133
Mother i just declare that

01:29:37.158 --> 01:29:41.262
i meditate in the morning and evening for kundalini

01:29:41.286 --> 01:29:47.022
I cannot understand what shall be our attitude for the rest of the day.

01:29:47.046 --> 01:29:52.736
Recently i tried to keep up the consciousness.

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:55.085
SM: In the morning and evening

01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:56.394
which is the fourth one, is it this one?

01:29:56.419 --> 01:29:57.441
SY: All are different.

01:29:57.466 --> 01:29:58.461
Let us read all the three.

01:29:58.485 --> 01:30:00.906
this fourth one, these are all together.

01:30:00.930 --> 01:30:02.593
Read these.

01:30:02.617 --> 01:30:07.992
Mother, i have been trying to get vibrations since you have come here last time

01:30:08.017 --> 01:30:09.670
but i am not getting it.

01:30:09.694 --> 01:30:18.174
I can't practice much because of my ill health. I am working.

01:30:18.198 --> 01:30:21.743
Third question: How to control the mind?

01:30:21.767 --> 01:30:23.253
That I have told.

01:30:23.277 --> 01:30:25.001
How to proceed in Sahajyoga?

01:30:25.025 --> 01:30:29.036
Is it possible to go for regular practice with some senior Sahajyogi?

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:31.387
Is there any Sahajyoga in Jamshedpur?

01:30:31.411 --> 01:30:33.026
I am staying in Jamshedpur.

01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:34.683
Shree Mataji: You better start it.

01:30:34.707 --> 01:30:38.726
So that i can practice it.

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:40.444
Start it in Jamshedpur.

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:46.610
Unwillingly many times bad, evil thoughts come to my mind.

01:30:46.635 --> 01:30:49.891
How to get free from those bad thoughts?

01:30:49.915 --> 01:30:53.023
Not Clear

01:30:53.047 --> 01:30:55.856
That I told you

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:58.368
that in thoughtless awareness you must just extend the state of VILAMBH.

01:30:58.392 --> 01:31:01.548
For that I told you the simple method.

01:31:01.572 --> 01:31:04.262
You should be in Vilambh by way of meditation.

01:31:04.287 --> 01:31:06.597
Then you must practice one more thing

01:31:06.621 --> 01:31:08.732
that while looking at everything

01:31:08.757 --> 01:31:11.437
that you must be in witness state in thoughtless awareness.

01:31:11.461 --> 01:31:13.147
Take the case of this garland.

01:31:13.171 --> 01:31:15.978
Now I looked at it.

01:31:16.002 --> 01:31:17.340
Somebody will think

01:31:17.365 --> 01:31:18.927
Where from did he purchase it?

01:31:18.951 --> 01:31:20.583
For how much did he purchase it?

01:31:20.607 --> 01:31:22.033
Who must have purchased it?

01:31:22.057 --> 01:31:23.425
All types of thoughts will come to his mind.

01:31:23.449 --> 01:31:26.804
Can also bring some bad thoughts as well.

01:31:26.828 --> 01:31:28.417
And what do I do?

01:31:28.441 --> 01:31:30.030
I simply witness it.

01:31:30.054 --> 01:31:33.568
And he who must have made it

01:31:33.593 --> 01:31:36.953
he who must have threaded it

01:31:36.977 --> 01:31:40.819
and he who must have created it

01:31:40.843 --> 01:31:42.990
the joy he must have expressed in it

01:31:43.014 --> 01:31:44.481
Is he enjoying it?

01:31:44.505 --> 01:31:45.285
I am the enjoyer.

01:31:45.309 --> 01:31:46.660
I am sitting and enjoying.

01:31:46.684 --> 01:31:48.510
Where do I have the time to think?

01:31:48.534 --> 01:31:51.971
Because if you think, then you will think that it should not get spoiled.

01:31:51.996 --> 01:31:54.147
I should take these and store in frigde.

01:31:54.171 --> 01:31:55.379
I should do this.

01:31:55.403 --> 01:31:56.292
I don't take this botheration.

01:31:56.316 --> 01:32:00.034
I am just enjoying someone else's thing.

01:32:00.058 --> 01:32:02.174
The same is the case with anything like that.

01:32:02.198 --> 01:32:03.791
Now look at a tree.

01:32:03.815 --> 01:32:06.321
God has created each leaf differently.

01:32:06.345 --> 01:32:07.886
Each leaf is different.

01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:09.183
It is amazing!

01:32:09.207 --> 01:32:11.596
Millions of leaves have been made in the world.

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:12.658
Each is different.

01:32:12.682 --> 01:32:13.727
It is amazing to see all this!

01:32:13.751 --> 01:32:15.384
How strange it is!

01:32:15.408 --> 01:32:16.336
Go on watching!

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.234
Some new things will attract your attention.

01:32:18.258 --> 01:32:23.691
And you will be stunned, will be stunned!

01:32:23.716 --> 01:32:26.951
One who feels stunned after watching it

01:32:26.976 --> 01:32:30.326
he only is in VILAMBH (present).

01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:33.372
If there is a person, look at his goodness.

01:32:33.396 --> 01:32:36.919
They are such nice people, such wonderful people

01:32:36.943 --> 01:32:38.895
will be absolutely stunned.

01:32:38.919 --> 01:32:40.840
There you are in VILAMBH (PRESENT).

01:32:40.864 --> 01:32:43.481
In this way you make the habit of watching

01:32:43.505 --> 01:32:46.121
each and everything in a witness state.

01:32:46.146 --> 01:32:47.603
It is too easy.

01:32:47.627 --> 01:32:49.204
I am the witness.

01:32:49.228 --> 01:32:51.152
Simply go on watching .

01:32:51.176 --> 01:32:52.250
You will have a great fun.

01:32:52.274 --> 01:32:55.734
The most enjoyable beings are humans.

01:32:55.758 --> 01:32:58.058
You will be surprised!

01:32:58.082 --> 01:33:00.993
The best thing of all are humans.

01:33:01.017 --> 01:33:03.417
The top most of all is a human.

01:33:03.441 --> 01:33:06.150
Only our vision moves from the opposite direction.

01:33:06.174 --> 01:33:08.282
If we look at it properly

01:33:08.306 --> 01:33:10.585
a human's beauty can be seen.

01:33:10.609 --> 01:33:13.030
And as that love comes into your sight

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:15.410
man's beauty goes on increasing further.

01:33:15.434 --> 01:33:21.580
Look at everything in a witness state.

01:33:21.604 --> 01:33:26.097
It is Shree Krishna's blessing, not mine.

01:33:26.122 --> 01:33:31.605
Whatever questions you asked, I think I have answered all of them.

01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:36.773
Now, if you meditate during the day and in the eveniing

01:33:36.798 --> 01:33:39.007
what will be the state during the day?

01:33:39.031 --> 01:33:41.686
The STHITI you are in will be maintained.

01:33:41.710 --> 01:33:46.452
You keep an eye on that situation.

01:33:46.476 --> 01:33:49.692
Gradually you will be surprised that the STHITI has already become inside you.

01:33:49.716 --> 01:33:55.051
You are alredy in the witness state.

01:33:55.076 --> 01:33:58.019
There is one state

01:33:58.043 --> 01:34:00.932
For example, take the case of curds.

01:34:00.956 --> 01:34:02.239
From curds we have got butter.

01:34:02.264 --> 01:34:03.763
Now, can we get curds from butter again?

01:34:03.788 --> 01:34:06.603
Once the butter is made, it's done.

01:34:06.719 --> 01:34:11.019
In the same way, you have now become butter.

01:34:11.074 --> 01:34:12.924
Enjoy it!

01:34:12.948 --> 01:34:14.148
It is a state.

01:34:14.173 --> 01:34:16.400
AS soon as you get that state, it happens.

01:34:16.424 --> 01:34:27.644
What you have to do is, just meditate.

01:34:27.668 --> 01:34:29.067
One thing more!

01:34:29.091 --> 01:34:31.089
Suppose spmebody couldn't meditate in the morning.

01:34:31.113 --> 01:34:33.201
We should not think that i did not meditate, i did not meditate.

01:34:33.226 --> 01:34:34.949
You should not think like that.

01:34:34.973 --> 01:34:37.777
We don't have any system, I told your earlier, there is no system..

01:34:37.801 --> 01:34:40.005
It depends upon your attitude.

01:34:40.029 --> 01:34:41.753
If you were not able to meditate, no problem.

01:34:41.777 --> 01:34:44.392
Close your eyes for one minute, meditation is done.

01:34:44.416 --> 01:34:46.466
Some people meditate for four hours.

01:34:46.491 --> 01:34:48.364
Oh My God! Why you have to do so much?

01:34:48.388 --> 01:34:50.410
Five minutes are enough.

01:34:50.434 --> 01:34:53.419
You don't have to meditate for four hours in Sahajyoga.

01:34:53.443 --> 01:34:56.050
When shall you do the work?

01:34:56.074 --> 01:35:01.518
It is like making machines and storing it.

01:35:01.542 --> 01:35:04.089
It is machine's job, it has to be done.

01:35:04.114 --> 01:35:07.029
What for the machine has been made?

01:35:07.053 --> 01:35:09.867
But there should not be this feeling, that we are working.

01:35:09.892 --> 01:35:18.136
Otherwise you will feel tired, you will get diseases.

01:35:18.161 --> 01:35:31.724
Not Clear (some sahajyogi speaking).

01:35:31.748 --> 01:35:34.699
No, No, sit down.

01:35:34.723 --> 01:35:37.902
See, now you are guilty.

01:35:37.926 --> 01:35:40.989
You have stolen something, just take it that you have stolen something.

01:35:41.013 --> 01:35:43.677
According to you , you are guilty.

01:35:43.701 --> 01:35:46.644
When you go in front of God

01:35:46.668 --> 01:35:50.877
Let Him use His wisdom and decide if you are guilty or not.

01:35:50.902 --> 01:35:54.413
Don't use your brain.

01:35:54.437 --> 01:35:58.264
If He thinks, you are guilty, He will take away your guilt.

01:35:58.288 --> 01:35:59.611
Why do you say?

01:35:59.635 --> 01:36:03.658
Is there anyone who goes to a doctor and says, I have cancer.

01:36:03.682 --> 01:36:05.235
I am suffering from cancer.

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:06.984
Nobody will say like that.

01:36:07.008 --> 01:36:08.364
May be he has cancer.

01:36:08.388 --> 01:36:11.433
He will go to a doctor and say,"Please check if i have cancer or not."

01:36:11.457 --> 01:36:12.753
I feel i don't have.

01:36:12.777 --> 01:36:16.551
Everybody will say like that.

01:36:16.575 --> 01:36:21.679
In the same way, you should not cry in front of God

01:36:21.704 --> 01:36:23.342
"I am guilty, i am like this"

01:36:23.367 --> 01:36:24.858
God says, Ok! you go".

01:36:24.882 --> 01:36:26.373
He doesn't like this.

01:36:26.397 --> 01:36:29.473
I am telling you the right thing about God.

01:36:29.497 --> 01:36:31.667
I have to speak on account of God as well.

01:36:31.691 --> 01:36:36.826
He doesn't like such people who cry day and night.

01:36:36.850 --> 01:36:42.691
Once Vallabhacharya went to meet Surdasji.

01:36:42.716 --> 01:36:47.016
Vallabhacharya is an incarnation.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:52.365
You know Vallabhacharya, who established Vaishnav Dharama.

01:36:52.389 --> 01:36:54.151
(Ashtachaap valle)

01:36:54.176 --> 01:36:57.754
He tells Surdas ji,''Why are you crying?"

01:36:57.809 --> 01:37:00.908
He was very upset by his crying.

01:37:00.933 --> 01:37:02.220
Why are you crying?

01:37:02.245 --> 01:37:08.308
You are sitting in front of God, take it.

01:37:08.333 --> 01:37:09.835
He is sitting there to give.

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:12.815
Why are you considering yourself incapable?

01:37:12.839 --> 01:37:15.332
If you must have stolen anything, it must be of the Government.

01:37:15.357 --> 01:37:22.950
Did you steal anything of God?

01:37:22.974 --> 01:37:27.139
Government is not of God.

01:37:27.163 --> 01:37:33.675
That doesn't mean that I am teaching you to steal.

01:37:33.699 --> 01:37:38.458
Everything will be okay!

01:37:38.482 --> 01:37:40.752
Mataji, you told yesterday

01:37:40.776 --> 01:37:45.337
that when a Lion eats somebody he is not conscious of the sin or virtue.

01:37:45.361 --> 01:37:51.289
In the same way, when a lion eats a deer, the deer also must be feeling bad. Is it so or not?

01:37:51.314 --> 01:37:52.305
No, it doesn't happen.

01:37:52.329 --> 01:37:54.482
Is it not injustice?

01:37:54.507 --> 01:37:58.560
See, we have wrong concepts.

01:37:58.584 --> 01:38:02.727
A deer doesn't have any awareness of that.

01:38:02.751 --> 01:38:06.349
In the human awareness

01:38:06.374 --> 01:38:11.894
the sufferings, mental anxiety and pain that we have

01:38:11.918 --> 01:38:15.789
that awareness animals do not have.

01:38:15.813 --> 01:38:18.173
There have been many experiments regarding that.

01:38:18.197 --> 01:38:21.323
And now it has been proved by experiments

01:38:21.348 --> 01:38:24.164
that there is a great difference between their awareness and human awareness.

01:38:24.188 --> 01:38:29.270
For example, there is a gentleman named Dayal Watson.

01:38:29.294 --> 01:38:34.375
He has recently written a book named SUPER NATURE.

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:36.107
Although a few people got mesmerrised

01:38:36.132 --> 01:38:39.477
get mesmerrised still, whatever was talked about

01:38:39.501 --> 01:38:42.421
that there was a female monkey.

01:38:42.445 --> 01:38:45.092
Her child was sick, and she was very anxious.

01:38:45.116 --> 01:38:47.158
Was screaming and screaming.

01:38:47.183 --> 01:38:49.029
But, as soon as the child died

01:38:49.054 --> 01:38:51.254
she left her child there and went in a different direction.

01:38:51.279 --> 01:38:54.598
It has died.

01:38:54.622 --> 01:38:55.762
No concern (with that dead child).

01:38:55.786 --> 01:38:58.018
After that all crying is over.

01:38:58.042 --> 01:38:59.888
As soon as they see that the child has died, it is over.

01:38:59.913 --> 01:39:01.149
Now what is the use of crying?

01:39:01.174 --> 01:39:03.294
They move forward.

01:39:03.318 --> 01:39:06.980
But with us, as long as we are alive, no one will cry.

01:39:07.004 --> 01:39:10.114
Nobody will even ask where are you sitting?

01:39:10.139 --> 01:39:12.191
When he dies, people all over the world will come.

01:39:12.215 --> 01:39:15.573
Oh my God! Wherefrom they have come?

01:39:15.597 --> 01:39:17.979
The place where we lived in London, a gentleman died.

01:39:18.003 --> 01:39:21.551
Nobody knew.

01:39:21.576 --> 01:39:24.655
He was lying dead for one month.

01:39:24.679 --> 01:39:27.377
The milkman who used to deliver milk

01:39:27.402 --> 01:39:29.509
saw that so many bottles had accumulated.

01:39:29.533 --> 01:39:30.631
Was he dead or alive?

01:39:30.655 --> 01:39:34.365
He gave the information.

01:39:34.389 --> 01:39:38.557
It was found that he had been lying dead for about a month back.

01:39:38.581 --> 01:39:41.536
The last date that he had written in a letter, it was one month back.

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.247
He has children, children of his children, grand children.

01:39:46.271 --> 01:39:48.744
Afterwards we saw that he had a big compound

01:39:48.768 --> 01:39:50.858
It was filled with people.

01:39:50.883 --> 01:39:52.389
All people were mourning.

01:39:52.413 --> 01:39:54.519
What is the use?

01:39:54.543 --> 01:39:58.330
The awareness of an animal and our awareness

01:39:58.354 --> 01:40:01.977
We are very anxious about deer.

01:40:02.001 --> 01:40:05.127
But the human being, who is sitting next to us

01:40:05.151 --> 01:40:11.808
We don't know how much pain we are causing him.

01:40:11.832 --> 01:40:16.130
A human being must first of all take care of a human being.

01:40:16.154 --> 01:40:20.420
What is the need to take so much care of an animal?

01:40:20.444 --> 01:40:23.400
Now the people are taking care even of bed bugs

01:40:23.424 --> 01:40:25.339
and want to save mosquitoes as well.

01:40:25.364 --> 01:40:26.914
God save us!

01:40:26.938 --> 01:40:30.556
Can I give realization to them?

01:40:30.581 --> 01:40:32.536
Save hens? what for?

01:40:32.561 --> 01:40:37.934
Am I going to give realization to hens?

01:40:37.958 --> 01:40:45.011
Govt. of India has banned the export of crocodile skin from here.

01:40:45.035 --> 01:40:46.724
Now there are so many crocodiles

01:40:46.749 --> 01:40:49.681
that they can't understand how to solve this problem.

01:40:49.705 --> 01:40:53.869
Whatever is the utility of a thing is to be accomplished.

01:40:53.893 --> 01:40:58.738
We feel that the animal must be feeling that he is being slaughtered.

01:40:58.762 --> 01:41:04.059
It is not so.

01:41:04.083 --> 01:41:07.737
The level they follow is a different level.

01:41:07.761 --> 01:41:10.520
Our level is different, our awareness is different.

01:41:10.545 --> 01:41:17.068
What we feel as great, animals don't.

01:41:17.092 --> 01:41:22.099
A lion does not think what will a deer think.

01:41:22.123 --> 01:41:25.927
And if he eats a deer after killing him, this is his food.

01:41:25.952 --> 01:41:28.701
He will take only what God has told him to eat.

01:41:28.725 --> 01:41:29.974
You eat a deer only.

01:41:29.999 --> 01:41:32.342
Can a poor lion become a vegeterian?

01:41:32.366 --> 01:41:40.134
What shall he do? Will he become a vegeterian and take grass and leaves.

01:41:40.158 --> 01:41:45.024
Durga ji has to eat all the bhoots.

01:41:45.048 --> 01:41:47.881
She had to drink the blood of Rakhtbeej.

01:41:47.905 --> 01:41:51.110
You will say, why did She drink the blood of Rakhtbeej?

01:41:51.134 --> 01:41:53.583
She is not a vegeterian, so that's it.

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:54.965
The matter is over.

01:41:54.989 --> 01:41:57.340
Will you drink (the blood of Rakhtbeej)?

01:41:57.364 --> 01:42:00.557
Show Me, who is there who can take the blood of Rakhtbeej?

01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:03.931
Useless talks.

01:42:03.955 --> 01:42:07.305
Leave the deer in the wilderness. You look at the human beings.

01:42:07.329 --> 01:42:09.039
In Sahajyoga there is respect for a human being.

01:42:09.063 --> 01:42:13.023
It doesn't mean that you go on killing every goat.

01:42:13.047 --> 01:42:15.959
I have to tell you repeatedly.

01:42:15.983 --> 01:42:18.748
But for Indians I will definitely say

01:42:18.772 --> 01:42:21.199
that those who are strict vegeterians

01:42:21.223 --> 01:42:23.650
should start taking protein food in any case.

01:42:23.674 --> 01:42:25.651
Otherwise you won't be able to walk.

01:42:25.676 --> 01:42:26.647
Here you see

01:42:26.672 --> 01:42:29.927
many ladies cannot lift their feet after getting fifty year old.

01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:32.203
It is very important to eat protein.

01:42:32.227 --> 01:42:33.261
This I will tell repeatedly.

01:42:33.285 --> 01:42:35.249
Even if you are a vegeterian, that doesn't matter

01:42:35.273 --> 01:42:39.201
but take protein in any case, otherwise your feet will become week.

01:42:39.225 --> 01:42:41.607
You will suffer from Angina.

01:42:41.631 --> 01:42:42.876
You will have heart trouble.

01:42:42.901 --> 01:42:44.995
All your muscles will be weak.

01:42:45.019 --> 01:42:53.113
You will have all muscular problems, Parkinson, Mellitus.

01:42:53.137 --> 01:42:56.377
And those who take too much in foreign countries

01:42:56.401 --> 01:42:58.603
I tell them to be vegeterians.

01:42:58.627 --> 01:43:02.417
There is a great need to be in balance.

01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:05.941
I am telling you again that it is very important to eat proteins.

01:43:05.965 --> 01:43:10.222
Those who are vegeterians, should include proteins in their meals.

01:43:10.246 --> 01:43:13.205
They should eat it the way they like.

01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:15.748
But they are very fond of taking rice.

01:43:15.772 --> 01:43:18.689
They are vegeterian , but the food should be tasty.

01:43:18.713 --> 01:43:23.317
I asked somebody why don't you take this new soyabean that is available.

01:43:23.342 --> 01:43:24.894
She said ,"Maa, It is not tasty."

01:43:24.919 --> 01:43:29.508
Then, how are you a vegeterian?

01:43:29.532 --> 01:43:34.714
Till we are fond of Rasna, we are neither vegeterian, nor non vegeterian.

01:43:34.738 --> 01:43:38.483
Rasna should be given up.

01:43:38.507 --> 01:43:44.994
The Indians will give up Rasna with a great difficulty.

01:43:45.018 --> 01:43:48.044
Mataji, please i wish to know

01:43:48.068 --> 01:43:50.801
Mataji (Not Clear)Fasting?

01:43:50.825 --> 01:43:54.909
Oh! no fasting at all!

01:43:54.933 --> 01:43:58.831
When you want to torture Me, you can fast.

01:43:58.855 --> 01:44:01.140
This is how we torture our mother.

01:44:01.164 --> 01:44:02.697
When we are angry with her, we say

01:44:02.722 --> 01:44:05.139
"Alright, i am angry with you, i will not eat my food."

01:44:05.163 --> 01:44:06.838
Finished, that mother is finished.

01:44:06.862 --> 01:44:09.403
No fasting allowed in Sahajyoga.

01:44:09.427 --> 01:44:14.831
But for your health sake if you fast, don't tell Me, you can fast.

01:44:14.855 --> 01:44:18.553
For your health, if you have to fast, Mother feels bad about it.

01:44:18.578 --> 01:44:20.760
Why to fast? What is the need?

01:44:20.784 --> 01:44:22.769
I have fasted for you.

01:44:22.793 --> 01:44:24.616
So many have fasted for you. Finish!

01:44:24.641 --> 01:44:27.942
Now you don't do fasting. Now you really enjoy!

01:44:27.966 --> 01:44:30.343
I have done the cooking for you!

01:44:30.367 --> 01:44:34.840
But overeating! That doesn't mean overeating!

01:44:34.864 --> 01:44:38.029
Mother has said,"Don't fast."

01:44:38.053 --> 01:44:47.831
So , let us have competition in eating Rassogulla.

01:44:47.855 --> 01:44:50.563
Shree Mataji, Please tell us how to conquer anger?

01:44:50.588 --> 01:44:51.232
For what?

01:44:51.256 --> 01:44:54.426
Anger!

01:44:54.450 --> 01:44:55.074
Anger!

01:44:55.098 --> 01:44:57.886
Truth is that it comes.

01:44:57.910 --> 01:45:00.331
Tried many methods, but that didn't help.

01:45:00.355 --> 01:45:02.749
Please tell it, from the beginning.

01:45:02.773 --> 01:45:06.023
Anger comes because of Liver.

01:45:06.047 --> 01:45:08.109
Not Clear

01:45:08.133 --> 01:45:11.208
That we are always right and other people are wrong

01:45:11.232 --> 01:45:13.096
when we think like that, we always get anger.

01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:15.415
Now by showering anger

01:45:15.439 --> 01:45:18.117
accumulates and becomes like a bomb.

01:45:18.141 --> 01:45:19.762
And as soon as somebody comes

01:45:19.787 --> 01:45:22.254
just for nothing, our anger is showered on him.

01:45:22.279 --> 01:45:25.708
and then we justify that i got angry

01:45:25.733 --> 01:45:30.838
this was right, that was right.

01:45:30.862 --> 01:45:35.276
We should get angry, but it should be under our control.

01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:38.064
You have mounted a horse.

01:45:38.088 --> 01:45:40.564
The horse should be under your control.

01:45:40.588 --> 01:45:45.875
But you get carried away by the horse, I do not consider it as anger.

01:45:45.899 --> 01:45:48.115
It comes from Liver.

01:45:48.139 --> 01:45:53.333
Its treatment is that, rub a little ice on liver daily.

01:45:53.357 --> 01:45:54.778
It will be very helpful.

01:45:54.802 --> 01:45:56.845
It will reduce heat.

01:45:56.869 --> 01:46:05.344
Rub ice in the void in foot.

01:46:05.368 --> 01:46:10.744
Rub ice on the liver.

01:46:10.768 --> 01:46:15.184
And right hand towards photograph

01:46:15.209 --> 01:46:16.180
and left hand like this (towards eather).

01:46:16.204 --> 01:46:19.090
and sit in ice cold water.

01:46:19.114 --> 01:46:20.675
It will make you cool.

01:46:20.699 --> 01:46:23.538
Coolness will subside your anger.

01:46:23.562 --> 01:46:25.451
It all happens because of the liver problem.

01:46:25.475 --> 01:46:27.422
If a person has liver problem

01:46:27.447 --> 01:46:32.615
and if you have to see him, you should carry a rod with you.

01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:36.212
And if such a person is sleeping you should never wake him up, never.

01:46:36.237 --> 01:46:43.201
He will get up and slap you two to four times.

01:46:43.225 --> 01:46:47.293
So when the liver is damaged, a person gets very angry.

01:46:47.317 --> 01:46:50.806
There are some people who murmur a lot and bore you.

01:46:50.830 --> 01:46:53.034
There are some people who do not talk at all.

01:46:53.058 --> 01:46:56.488
And when they speak, they roar.

01:46:56.512 --> 01:46:58.302
You should be in the center.

01:46:58.327 --> 01:47:01.312
Talk when you have to talk, when you don't have to talk, don't talk.

01:47:01.336 --> 01:47:04.623
Anger is treated by treating the liver.

01:47:04.647 --> 01:47:08.181
To treat your liver I tell you to take LIV 52.

01:47:08.204 --> 01:47:09.984
This generates heat.

01:47:10.009 --> 01:47:11.845
And next put ice on your liver.

01:47:11.869 --> 01:47:14.973
This will cure your cold and cough.

01:47:14.997 --> 01:47:16.644
Many people do not put on undershirt.

01:47:16.668 --> 01:47:18.284
You don't know, in Sahajyoga there is compulsion

01:47:18.308 --> 01:47:19.735
that you have to wear undershirt.

01:47:19.759 --> 01:47:21.885
For Sikhs, five things are compulsory

01:47:21.909 --> 01:47:24.609
whereas in Sahajyoga, everyone should wear undershirt.

01:47:24.633 --> 01:47:28.233
That causes chest conjestion and heat

01:47:28.257 --> 01:47:29.624
That too damages liver.

01:47:29.648 --> 01:47:35.913
Alcohol causes liver damage.

01:47:35.937 --> 01:47:38.326
Those who go on thinking about future

01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:39.761
I have to go now.

01:47:39.785 --> 01:47:41.423
If i go from here i will take a bus.

01:47:41.447 --> 01:47:43.558
Then take a bus and go there.

01:47:43.582 --> 01:47:46.181
A person who thinks everytime about future

01:47:46.205 --> 01:47:50.254
his liver also gets damaged and he also gets diabetes.

01:47:50.278 --> 01:47:53.581
Both the diseases are caused by over thinking.

01:47:53.605 --> 01:47:57.806
You see, the people take so much sugar in villages

01:47:57.830 --> 01:48:00.248
they say that spoon should stand straight in sugar.

01:48:00.273 --> 01:48:03.881
We need this much sugar, it may be five or six spoons.

01:48:03.905 --> 01:48:08.708
In Maharashtra, I observe that they put six spoons of sugar in one small cup.

01:48:08.733 --> 01:48:14.136
People drink but nobody gets diabetes, because they don't think.

01:48:14.247 --> 01:48:16.987
We get diabetes only because of the disease of thinking.

01:48:17.011 --> 01:48:20.388
Those who have got diabetes, whenever they start thinking

01:48:20.413 --> 01:48:22.313
should say, not this, not this, not this

01:48:22.338 --> 01:48:24.579
Ya Neti, Neti Vachne Nigmo.............

01:48:24.603 --> 01:48:29.014
Nothing, not this thought, not this thought, not this thought.

01:48:29.038 --> 01:48:31.951
Instantly you see, God will think about you.

01:48:31.975 --> 01:48:41.347
The more you think, the more your liver will damage.

01:48:41.371 --> 01:48:46.892
Shree Mataji, how to attain self realisation?

01:48:46.916 --> 01:48:48.883
Not Clear

01:48:48.907 --> 01:48:52.649
After reading the whole Ramayana

01:48:52.673 --> 01:49:00.139
who was Sita's Ram and who was Ram's Sita?

01:49:00.163 --> 01:49:02.427
You didn't have even an idea of their gender.

01:49:02.451 --> 01:49:05.156
Question: Shree Mataji: Is it that with Sahajyoga

01:49:05.181 --> 01:49:08.839
or do all diseases go away by doing Sahajyoga?

01:49:08.863 --> 01:49:11.319
And is there no need of going to a doctor?

01:49:11.344 --> 01:49:12.442
No, there is no need.

01:49:12.466 --> 01:49:16.544
But you see there are some diseases, like I said about cataract.

01:49:16.568 --> 01:49:19.359
The thing which is dead, has to be taken out.

01:49:19.384 --> 01:49:20.468
For this you should see a doctor.

01:49:20.492 --> 01:49:23.378
We should see a doctor for many things.

01:49:23.402 --> 01:49:25.436
If you are doing Sahajyoga, you won't have any disease

01:49:25.461 --> 01:49:27.136
why will the question of doctors arise?

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:32.041
Did you get the thought of doctors like deers?

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:33.467
These people will die of hunger.

01:49:33.491 --> 01:49:37.641
They are not going to die of hunger.

01:49:37.665 --> 01:49:39.800
How many Sahajyogis we are?

01:49:39.824 --> 01:49:42.366
At least let our health be good.

01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:57.846
They need some free time, let them go.

01:49:57.870 --> 01:50:05.833
Dr. Talwar is sitting here......... (Laughter).

01:50:05.857 --> 01:50:07.691
SM: I will tell you one thing which is meaningful.

01:50:07.715 --> 01:50:12.112
One book was printed by Brighumani.

01:50:12.136 --> 01:50:15.099
One which he has written is Brigu Sangeeta.

01:50:15.123 --> 01:50:17.794
And one more book he printed.

01:50:17.818 --> 01:50:22.690
He has written clearly in that book

01:50:22.714 --> 01:50:27.206
that such a time will come when Param Chaitanya will incarnate Himself.

01:50:27.230 --> 01:50:30.158
And when Param Chaitanya will incarnate

01:50:30.182 --> 01:50:33.079
then everybody's Kundalini will awaken spontaneously.

01:50:33.103 --> 01:50:36.022
The name of that book is Nadi Granth.

01:50:36.046 --> 01:50:37.872
If you get that book anywhere in Sanskrit, read it.

01:50:37.897 --> 01:50:42.042
But I have seen its Marathi translation.

01:50:42.066 --> 01:50:44.963
People's kundalini will awaken very easily.

01:50:44.987 --> 01:50:46.653
And in that book, it is also written that

01:50:46.678 --> 01:50:56.400
there will be no need of hospitals for those people.

01:50:56.424 --> 01:50:59.198
SY: But there will be maternity homes.

01:50:59.222 --> 01:51:12.454
SY: But there will be maternity homes. (Everybody laughs.)

01:51:12.478 --> 01:51:24.386
Shree Mataji, (Not Clear) your consent is requested, if you permit

01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:26.869
on 16th and 17 th

01:51:26.893 --> 01:51:28.157
Do it surely!

01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:30.808
You people enjoy doing it, why should I say 'No' to it?

01:51:30.833 --> 01:51:32.758
Do it surely.

01:51:32.782 --> 01:51:43.736
But this announcement will be extended up to 17th.

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:47.191
Are the question over?

01:51:47.215 --> 01:51:54.021
Ask, you are asking something.

01:51:54.045 --> 01:51:57.574
Anyone has brought anything, some salt, water?

01:51:57.668 --> 01:51:59.238
Salt, sugar they have brought.

01:51:59.263 --> 01:52:01.214
So, i think we should make.

01:52:01.238 --> 01:52:03.713
SM: I will make it. Take salt from everyone.

01:52:03.738 --> 01:52:05.840
Give it to everyone, salt, water.

01:52:05.864 --> 01:52:07.676
Shree Mataji: Have you brought?

01:52:07.724 --> 01:52:11.239
Get some water, not separately. Give it to Me.

01:52:11.263 --> 01:52:12.181
Wait !

01:52:12.205 --> 01:52:14.291
Please sit down.

01:52:14.315 --> 01:52:22.433
Get salt and water.

01:52:22.457 --> 01:52:30.227
Collect salt and get it vibrated.

01:52:30.251 --> 01:52:32.040
Please!

01:52:32.065 --> 01:52:39.312
Here also we can have center on Sundays, from 8-9 in the morning.

01:52:39.336 --> 01:52:41.175
Yes, yes sure, why not?

01:52:41.199 --> 01:52:46.325
Yes, ask Kim. I after taking permission from you, can I give them permission?

01:52:46.349 --> 01:52:49.971
laughter!

01:52:49.995 --> 01:52:57.357
You are saying that on Sundays from 8-9 here we can have one center.

01:52:57.382 --> 01:52:59.903
I permit you for that (clapping).

01:52:59.928 --> 01:53:04.172
Lot of thanks!

01:53:04.197 --> 01:53:05.062
Very Good!

01:53:05.086 --> 01:53:11.610
It is very convenient, if you give permission to do it on Sundays.

01:53:11.635 --> 01:53:16.912
Yes, it is ok!

01:53:16.936 --> 01:53:21.376
Then from here, the word will also reach the market as well.

01:53:21.401 --> 01:53:22.505
PLease pay attention!

01:53:22.530 --> 01:53:27.554
The brothers and sisters who have got sugar, salt or water with them

01:53:27.578 --> 01:53:31.605
let them collect it in some big vessel.

01:53:31.629 --> 01:53:32.443
Shree Mataji: No, No!

01:53:32.467 --> 01:53:36.052
You do one thing, get some water

01:53:36.076 --> 01:53:38.161
Yes!

01:53:38.185 --> 01:53:41.325
It will be difficult to do for everyone.

01:53:41.349 --> 01:54:06.083
No, No, through adding to that

01:54:06.107 --> 01:54:08.939
(Not Clear)

01:54:08.963 --> 01:54:12.805
Now, give Me the salt.

01:54:12.829 --> 01:54:14.446
SM: They will pour it.

01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:17.402
Please, all of you do not come here.

01:54:17.426 --> 01:54:20.972
If you sit at your place

01:54:20.996 --> 01:54:25.240
(Not Clear)

01:54:25.265 --> 01:54:26.805
You please sit down.

01:54:26.829 --> 01:54:28.381
Not Clear.

01:54:28.405 --> 01:54:30.776
Shree Mataji: You do one thing, he is giving to all, he will give it to you.

01:54:30.801 --> 01:54:33.269
You get it to him.

01:54:33.293 --> 01:54:35.151
SY: You assemble at one place.

01:54:35.175 --> 01:54:36.213
I am coming there.

01:54:36.237 --> 01:54:36.915
Shall we keep it here.

01:54:36.939 --> 01:54:39.993
Will you stand in the center, instead of coming in front of Mother.

01:54:40.017 --> 01:54:41.492
Please stand in queue on one side.

01:54:41.516 --> 01:54:43.252
SM:Take a spoon.

01:54:43.277 --> 01:54:44.502
I will give them a little.

01:54:44.527 --> 01:54:45.892
SM: Listen,take a spoon.

01:54:45.917 --> 01:54:50.158
You please make queue, that will make it quite easy

01:54:50.183 --> 01:54:53.212
and you will get it there only.

01:54:53.237 --> 01:54:57.824
Please sit down.

01:54:57.848 --> 01:55:03.221
SM: No, No, No we will put it into yours. Give up worrying.

01:55:03.245 --> 01:55:08.268
It has water. Have you got a spoon? Let us have a spoon.

01:55:08.292 --> 01:55:12.828
SM: Find out a spoon, take that spoon.

01:55:12.853 --> 01:55:14.476
SM: Now it is okay!

01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:18.518
SM: It is ok! Even a drop is enough. Don't worry.

01:55:18.557 --> 01:55:22.041
SM: Take it in this pot, pour it every body's pot.

01:55:22.066 --> 01:55:27.650
SY: You keep your things here. Don't worry and sit in your place.

01:55:27.674 --> 01:55:29.212
SY says: Have you kept it?

01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:33.535
SM: You go there, go there and take it.

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:36.542
SM: Please help them and take these there.

01:55:36.566 --> 01:55:38.212
SY: May i please request

01:55:38.236 --> 01:55:39.249
SY: Excuse me you take your.......

01:55:39.273 --> 01:55:42.336
SM: No! No! Wait for a minute!

01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:44.110
SM: Pick up this stuff and keep it there.

01:55:44.134 --> 01:55:47.065
SY: Keep it on one side, keep everything on one side.

01:55:47.089 --> 01:55:51.477
SY: PLease empty this space. Please come down, please.

01:55:51.502 --> 01:55:52.444
SM: Take it.

01:55:52.469 --> 01:55:57.011
SY: Please come down. It is all (not clear) vibrated.

01:55:57.036 --> 01:56:00.135
SY: You come down please, please come down.

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:05.354
SY: It will be all the more better.

01:56:05.378 --> 01:56:06.857
SM: Somebody please help them.

01:56:06.882 --> 01:56:08.908
SY: Please don't give suggestions.

01:56:08.932 --> 01:56:11.625
SM: Take this water, take this water there.

01:56:11.649 --> 01:56:13.859
SM: You take it and please help them.

01:56:13.883 --> 01:56:16.311
You also take this, it is over now.

01:56:16.335 --> 01:56:24.023
You go out and put it in everything.

01:56:24.047 --> 01:56:27.817
Take the water etc. there.

01:56:27.842 --> 01:56:29.552
SY: Shall i pick it up?

01:56:29.577 --> 01:56:35.512
SM: yes, yes pick it up.

01:56:35.536 --> 01:56:38.343
SM: Go one by one and everyone will get it automatically.

01:56:38.382 --> 01:56:40.296
You can yourself understand it.

01:56:40.327 --> 01:56:47.477
SM: Please listen to organizers, otherwise it is not possible.

01:56:47.501 --> 01:56:52.515
SM: Which books are these?

01:56:52.539 --> 01:56:57.845
SM: Yes, I have heard, but it is of no use.

01:56:57.869 --> 01:57:00.578
Why do you connect with the subconscious mind?

01:57:00.602 --> 01:57:02.774
It is not necessary to connect to mind.

01:57:02.798 --> 01:57:05.110
You get connected to God.

01:57:05.134 --> 01:57:06.643
It is all useless.

01:57:06.667 --> 01:57:10.423
See how their disciple's hands are shivering.

01:57:10.447 --> 01:57:15.096
You see this is wrong, don't do so. Why do you do so?

01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:17.558
Connect yourself to God.

01:57:17.582 --> 01:57:18.533
All this is very wrong.

01:57:18.557 --> 01:57:21.772
You yourself see how much your hands are shivering.

01:57:21.797 --> 01:57:25.606
Leave this. You come and put both your hands towards Me.

01:57:25.630 --> 01:57:29.419
Tulsi Das ji, I know he got cancer and died.

01:57:29.443 --> 01:57:31.153
SM: Who is he?

01:57:31.177 --> 01:57:34.358
SY: Those who have kept their belongings here

01:57:34.383 --> 01:57:37.528
take their belongings and be in a queue there.

01:57:37.552 --> 01:57:40.801
There Mother has given vibrated products.

01:57:40.825 --> 01:57:43.277
SY: You have got all your vibrated things.

01:57:43.301 --> 01:57:54.228
SM: He was the guru of Rajesh's mother.

01:57:54.252 --> 01:57:58.984
SM: You see all this is useless, you get it, get it, get it.

01:57:59.009 --> 01:58:00.495
See your hands are shivering.

01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:01.931
There can be something wrong.

01:58:01.956 --> 01:58:05.589
SY: Shree Mataji is telling

01:58:05.613 --> 01:58:07.481
SM: Your case is very much clear.

01:58:07.505 --> 01:58:10.843
Your hands are shivering. Tell Me what shall I say now?

01:58:10.867 --> 01:58:14.751
In this way everyone mesmerizes.

01:58:14.775 --> 01:58:18.572
What is the need to go to subconscious state?

01:58:18.596 --> 01:58:21.970
My dear, don't mind, you look after yourself.

01:58:21.994 --> 01:58:24.773
You are not born for anyone, you are born for yourself.

01:58:24.797 --> 01:58:28.417
I am Mother. I won't tell you anything wrong.

01:58:28.442 --> 01:58:33.857
You fix your problems. Why are you worried about others?

01:58:33.881 --> 01:58:35.981
Fix your own problems yourself. See your selfishness.

01:58:36.005 --> 01:58:39.530
Follow the selfishness and become selfish.

01:58:39.555 --> 01:58:42.245
One who has found the meaning of 'Self ', has become selfish.

01:58:42.269 --> 01:58:44.455
Leave all the people of the world.

01:58:44.479 --> 01:58:46.022
You get your self realisation.

01:58:46.046 --> 01:58:47.275
You get your self realisation

01:58:47.300 --> 01:58:48.437
sit down, We will get you your self realisation.

01:58:48.462 --> 01:58:52.031
Give him his self realisation. Give up all this. It is all useless.

01:58:52.055 --> 01:58:55.244
Why run after someone who doesn't give any benefit?

01:58:55.268 --> 01:58:57.791
Here is a mother, ask her if she has got any benefit?

01:58:57.815 --> 01:58:58.494
Have you got?

01:58:58.518 --> 01:59:00.829
If you haven't got, leave it.

01:59:00.853 --> 01:59:05.656
SY: Those who hav e taken (Not Clear).

01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:07.694
SM: Take it yours.

01:59:07.855 --> 01:59:12.017
SM: You have brought such small bottles

01:59:12.041 --> 01:59:16.203
the mouth of the bottles should be bigger.

01:59:16.227 --> 01:59:19.507
Now pick up these things kept in front of mother and come in a queue.

01:59:19.531 --> 01:59:23.868
SM: To whom does this belong?

01:59:23.892 --> 01:59:26.743
SM: Let this also be kept with that.

01:59:26.767 --> 01:59:27.930
SY: They will take themselves.

01:59:27.954 --> 01:59:31.897
SM: No, No. the lady whose they have taken, it belongs to her.

01:59:31.921 --> 01:59:44.502
Keep it with that only.

01:59:44.526 --> 01:59:49.700
Shree Mataji, they are requesting to vibrate this and then  distribute it.

01:59:49.725 --> 01:59:52.318
SM: Water is done, but to vibrate everything it will take a very long time.

01:59:52.343 --> 02:00:04.476
SY: Yes, keep it there only.

02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:12.795
SM: Put it in that also.

02:00:12.819 --> 02:00:15.208
SM: Open that too.

02:00:15.232 --> 02:00:35.958
SM: They have brought such small bottles.

02:00:35.982 --> 02:00:39.763
SY: You have broght such small bottle, how can we insert hand into it?

02:00:39.787 --> 02:00:41.702
The can is big.

02:00:41.727 --> 02:00:42.292
SM: It is ok!

02:00:42.316 --> 02:00:48.720
SM: Yes, the cans are there. It is ok now.

02:00:48.806 --> 02:00:50.727
Now get rid of this one.

02:00:50.751 --> 02:01:07.880
Can we move now?

02:01:07.904 --> 02:01:09.257
SM: How are you?

02:01:09.281 --> 02:01:09.876
SY: Fine.

02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:12.691
SM: Your husband is alright?

02:01:12.715 --> 02:01:15.764
SM: Alright! May God bless you!

02:01:15.789 --> 02:01:28.516
SM: keep it there only.

02:01:28.877 --> 02:01:36.936
SY: Please don't put your hand or fingers into the vibrated water.

02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:43.305
Not Clear.

02:01:43.330 --> 02:01:46.961
and continue to use it without touching it with your hands.

02:01:46.985 --> 02:01:56.116
SY: Ask somebody to bring this oil for vibration.

02:01:56.140 --> 02:02:00.951
SY: All of you are requested not to touch Shree Mataji's feet, while leaving.

02:02:00.975 --> 02:02:09.156
and second thing, those who haven't got self realization, can wait.

02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:36.540
Will talk to Dr. Talwar and he will give everyone his self realization.

02:02:36.564 --> 02:03:02.847
Not clear

02:03:02.871 --> 02:03:09.715
Salt, Salt!

02:03:09.739 --> 02:03:56.732
Not clear

02:03:56.756 --> 02:03:58.250
Shree Mataji leaving the pendal.

02:03:58.275 --> 02:04:03.148
Take a little water.

02:04:03.172 --> 02:04:49.373
Get some salt.

02:04:49.397 --> 02:06:23.870
Everybody leaving.

02:06:23.894 --> 02:07:18.970
S.Yogini: Give him Sugar.

02:07:18.994 --> 02:07:25.406
THE END
