00:00.399 --> 00:03.480
Now, then you have to go further.

00:03.480 --> 00:07.570
See you find yourself that your right side
is hot.

00:07.570 --> 00:10.690
What you do is put your right side towards
the photograph

00:10.690 --> 00:14.219
and the left side up towards the ether.

00:14.219 --> 00:17.529
The ether takes away the heat.

00:17.529 --> 00:19.630
But what actually happens is that

00:19.630 --> 00:22.949
your right side gets the vibration and

00:22.949 --> 00:28.699
the heat is pushed towards your left and passes
out into the ether.

00:28.699 --> 00:33.270
Now this heat comes from too much futuristic
living.

00:33.270 --> 00:37.230
Those people who are too much futuristic,
they have too much heat.

00:37.230 --> 00:39.750
And too much heat has to go away,

00:39.750 --> 00:44.730
and when this heat starts going away then
you are amazed how it works.

00:44.730 --> 00:47.760
For that there are various things we have
to use,

00:47.760 --> 00:52.640
but mainly for right-sided people they should
not use any light at all.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.900
They should not sit in the sun.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.580
They should sit in the moonlight.

00:56.580 --> 00:59.040
They should read some poetry.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.820
They should not tie up watches.

01:01.820 --> 01:04.320
They should not look at time.

01:04.320 --> 01:09.530
They should allow the time to pass,

01:09.530 --> 01:13.390
and they should just become very, sort of
emotional people.

01:13.390 --> 01:15.890
They should sing songs of bhakti.

01:15.890 --> 01:17.100
They should not do Hatha Yoga.

01:17.100 --> 01:21.090
There are so many things they should not do
if they are right sided.

01:21.090 --> 01:27.710
You will be surprised how people have been
helped through this kind of a treatment,

01:27.710 --> 01:30.960
which treats one side of your being.

01:30.960 --> 01:40.790
On the left hand side people are the people
as you know are the ones who are docile,

01:40.790 --> 01:42.880
who bear up lots of things from others

01:42.880 --> 01:51.560
and cry and weep and all the time are on the
losers end.

01:51.560 --> 01:56.840
Such people have problems also because all
their organs are lethargic

01:56.840 --> 01:59.880
and they have problems of a lethargic heart,

01:59.880 --> 02:03.860
lethargic liver, lethargic intestines.

02:03.860 --> 02:07.100
Everything becomes very lethargic.

02:07.100 --> 02:10.450
All these left side things can be cured.

02:10.450 --> 02:13.219
Plus they might have some sort of a badha
in them,

02:13.219 --> 02:15.859
in the sense they are possessed by someone.

02:15.859 --> 02:19.079
Of course, some of them are possessed by right
side also.

02:19.079 --> 02:20.980
Not that only the left side is possessed.

02:20.980 --> 02:24.239
But from the right side also they are possessed.

02:24.239 --> 02:29.170
And left sided possessions are of a peculiar
type,

02:29.170 --> 02:31.069
because they give you pain in the body.

02:31.069 --> 02:33.230
You get pains in the body.

02:33.230 --> 02:35.659
Right sided person doesn’t get any pain
himself.

02:35.659 --> 02:37.319
He gives pain to others.

02:37.319 --> 02:41.439
He is very sarcastic, he is very aggressive,
he troubles others,

02:41.439 --> 02:44.720
but the left sided people have pains themselves.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.900
They get a pain here and a pain there and
pain here.

02:47.900 --> 02:51.370
So left side has to be cleared, as you know
very well through the light.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.419
Light is put before the photograph,

02:53.419 --> 02:57.870
left hand towards the photograph, right hand
on the Mother Earth.

02:57.870 --> 03:00.659
So the left hand gets the light

03:00.659 --> 03:06.590
and the light passes through and the negativity
of the left side passes to the right hand,

03:06.590 --> 03:08.919
and the right hand is on the Mother Earth.

03:08.919 --> 03:15.269
The Mother Earth is the one who sucks in all
these negative forces of the left hand side.

03:15.269 --> 03:17.579
So these are the two sides which we clear.

03:17.579 --> 03:21.080
But once you have cleared these two sides
then you can use the photograph.

03:21.080 --> 03:25.859
Sit with your both the hands towards the photograph
and put both the feet in the water,

03:25.859 --> 03:30.269
little bit of salt in it and about five ten
minutes

03:30.269 --> 03:34.449
you must allow the vibrations to clear you
out.

03:34.449 --> 03:36.180
Then wipe your feet.

03:36.180 --> 03:42.579
Put the water properly into some disposal
and then sit down for meditation.

03:42.579 --> 03:48.639
If you can do that everyday, even ten minutes,
is more than sufficient.

03:48.639 --> 03:52.949
Don’t have to do anything in an extreme
manner.

03:52.949 --> 03:54.010
In the morning time,

03:54.010 --> 03:56.970
you have to give yourself a bandhan when you
are going out.

03:56.970 --> 04:00.059
Don’t go out without giving a bandhan.

04:00.059 --> 04:05.239
And attention should be all the time inside,
in the sense that,

04:05.239 --> 04:09.589
walking on the road people have habit of seeing
this, seeing that, seeing like that.

04:09.589 --> 04:11.790
The attention gets frittered away.

04:11.790 --> 04:12.790
What you should see is

04:12.790 --> 04:17.190
you should see about three feet or four feet
at the most from the ground and not above.

04:17.190 --> 04:20.590
Because you can see all the beautiful children,
flowers everything.

04:20.590 --> 04:24.379
There is nothing very beautiful above that.

04:24.379 --> 04:29.720
So better is to see only up three four feet
if possible, to fix your attention,

04:29.720 --> 04:33.030
so the attention becomes concentrated.

04:33.030 --> 04:38.870
And you feel very relaxed and relieved of
too much of wobbling of your eyes.

04:38.870 --> 04:40.970
Eyes are very important.

04:40.970 --> 04:45.199
Very important, and as you will notice, because
you are all realized souls,

04:45.199 --> 04:50.460
that your eyes now have got a glint, a kind
of a light in the eye.

04:50.460 --> 04:53.590
And that light shows that you are realized
souls.

04:53.590 --> 05:03.050
But to keep it up you have to look at things
which are not anti God,

05:03.050 --> 05:08.820
which are not dirty, which are not filthy,
which are against Sahaj religion,

05:08.820 --> 05:11.820
which is against Sahaj culture.

05:11.820 --> 05:17.120
If you can manage that, it is going to help
you a lot.
