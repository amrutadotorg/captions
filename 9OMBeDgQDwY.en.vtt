00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.480
Now, then you have to go further.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.570
See you find yourself that your right side
is hot.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.690
What you do is put your right side towards
the photograph

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.219
and the left side up towards the ether.

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.529
The ether takes away the heat.

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.630
But what actually happens is that

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.949
your right side gets the vibration and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.699
the heat is pushed towards your left and passes
out into the ether.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.270
Now this heat comes from too much futuristic
living.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.230
Those people who are too much futuristic,
they have too much heat.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.750
And too much heat has to go away,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.730
and when this heat starts going away then
you are amazed how it works.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.760
For that there are various things we have
to use,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.640
but mainly for right-sided people they should
not use any light at all.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.900
They should not sit in the sun.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.580
They should sit in the moonlight.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.040
They should read some poetry.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.820
They should not tie up watches.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.320
They should not look at time.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.530
They should allow the time to pass,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.390
and they should just become very, sort of
emotional people.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.890
They should sing songs of bhakti.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.100
They should not do Hatha Yoga.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.090
There are so many things they should not do
if they are right sided.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.710
You will be surprised how people have been
helped through this kind of a treatment,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.960
which treats one side of your being.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:40.790
On the left hand side people are the people
as you know are the ones who are docile,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.880
who bear up lots of things from others

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:51.560
and cry and weep and all the time are on the
losers end.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.840
Such people have problems also because all
their organs are lethargic

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.880
and they have problems of a lethargic heart,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.860
lethargic liver, lethargic intestines.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.100
Everything becomes very lethargic.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.450
All these left side things can be cured.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.219
Plus they might have some sort of a badha
in them,

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.859
in the sense they are possessed by someone.

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:19.079
Of course, some of them are possessed by right
side also.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.980
Not that only the left side is possessed.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.239
But from the right side also they are possessed.

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.170
And left sided possessions are of a peculiar
type,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.069
because they give you pain in the body.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.230
You get pains in the body.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.659
Right sided person doesn’t get any pain
himself.

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.319
He gives pain to others.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.439
He is very sarcastic, he is very aggressive,
he troubles others,

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.720
but the left sided people have pains themselves.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.900
They get a pain here and a pain there and
pain here.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.370
So left side has to be cleared, as you know
very well through the light.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.419
Light is put before the photograph,

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.870
left hand towards the photograph, right hand
on the Mother Earth.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.659
So the left hand gets the light

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:06.590
and the light passes through and the negativity
of the left side passes to the right hand,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.919
and the right hand is on the Mother Earth.

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:15.269
The Mother Earth is the one who sucks in all
these negative forces of the left hand side.

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.579
So these are the two sides which we clear.

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.080
But once you have cleared these two sides
then you can use the photograph.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.859
Sit with your both the hands towards the photograph
and put both the feet in the water,

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.269
little bit of salt in it and about five ten
minutes

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.449
you must allow the vibrations to clear you
out.

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.180
Then wipe your feet.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.579
Put the water properly into some disposal
and then sit down for meditation.

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.639
If you can do that everyday, even ten minutes,
is more than sufficient.

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.949
Don’t have to do anything in an extreme
manner.

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.010
In the morning time,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.970
you have to give yourself a bandhan when you
are going out.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.059
Don’t go out without giving a bandhan.

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:05.239
And attention should be all the time inside,
in the sense that,

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.589
walking on the road people have habit of seeing
this, seeing that, seeing like that.

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:11.790
The attention gets frittered away.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.790
What you should see is

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.190
you should see about three feet or four feet
at the most from the ground and not above.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.590
Because you can see all the beautiful children,
flowers everything.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.379
There is nothing very beautiful above that.

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:29.720
So better is to see only up three four feet
if possible, to fix your attention,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.030
so the attention becomes concentrated.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.870
And you feel very relaxed and relieved of
too much of wobbling of your eyes.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.970
Eyes are very important.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.199
Very important, and as you will notice, because
you are all realized souls,

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.460
that your eyes now have got a glint, a kind
of a light in the eye.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.590
And that light shows that you are realized
souls.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:03.050
But to keep it up you have to look at things
which are not anti God,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.820
which are not dirty, which are not filthy,
which are against Sahaj religion,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.820
which is against Sahaj culture.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.120
If you can manage that, it is going to help
you a lot.
