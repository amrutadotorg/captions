00:07.433 --> 00:11.637
This is paroksha, is the outside,

00:11.717 --> 00:16.543
by which your material life can be projected more.

00:16.663 --> 00:20.216
You can see more.

00:20.296 --> 00:22.997
But if I say you have to see inside,

00:23.077 --> 00:27.156
you can’t turn your eyes back to see inside.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.198
That you cannot do.

00:30.398 --> 00:35.865
Now, what is the method by which you can see inside

00:35.945 --> 00:39.865
or feel inside or go inside?

00:40.711 --> 00:43.783
Through our eyes our attention goes out.

00:43.863 --> 00:45.269
We see everything.

00:45.349 --> 00:48.063
But supposing tomorrow something topples down.

00:48.143 --> 00:52.923
Immediately our attention is attracted towards that happening.

00:54.936 --> 01:00.372
So inside us there must be some arrangement

01:01.545 --> 01:09.531
for this happening that must be attracting our attention inside

01:09.611 --> 01:13.279
and that’s how we must be going inside.

01:16.967 --> 01:20.812
We have evolved from amoeba to this stage.

01:20.892 --> 01:23.339
We are human beings.

01:23.419 --> 01:35.513
Our evolution has come through
our attention fixed outside.

01:38.008 --> 01:42.879
The happening has to go inside.

01:45.207 --> 01:49.464
But the evolution so far has been by going outside.

01:49.544 --> 01:55.791
Like some fishes felt the land and tried to crawl out

01:55.871 --> 01:59.364
and they became the reptiles.

02:01.484 --> 02:08.929
The reptiles wanted to run fast
so they developed four legs as a tortoise.

02:10.608 --> 02:20.767
As animals they could not eat;
so they raised their head.

02:23.587 --> 02:28.214
Things at the height they could not see,
so they raised their body more.

02:28.294 --> 02:34.619
So all the evolution so far has come
through the urge of seeking only,

02:35.138 --> 02:38.004
but it has been outside.

02:41.253 --> 02:44.320
We have been seeking food,

02:46.160 --> 02:51.069
as human beings we are seeking power,

02:51.403 --> 02:56.150
we have been seeking money, possessions, comfort.

03:01.278 --> 03:07.678
But now the seeking has to go within.

03:09.988 --> 03:12.408
For example, when we are building a house

03:12.488 --> 03:17.122
we build all the outside and everything properly.

03:19.588 --> 03:27.641
When it is all done outside
then you go inside and start decorating.

03:31.123 --> 03:46.987
In the same way you have to go inside
to achieve the last breakthrough.

03:48.483 --> 03:52.685
For example, we have made a fortress for ourselves

03:52.765 --> 03:58.286
and we have to enter inside the fortress

03:59.833 --> 04:01.627
to enjoy it.

04:03.113 --> 04:08.555
We have to penetrate inside the house to enjoy it.

04:08.949 --> 04:13.294
But our attention is outside. We cannot go inside.

04:16.115 --> 04:20.923
So something has to happen that you are to be sucked in.

04:21.596 --> 04:26.548
Some sort of a vacuum is created inside
by which you are sucked in.

04:26.628 --> 04:33.133
It’s a beautiful arrangement which has been sahaja,

04:33.213 --> 04:36.339
means spontaneously growing within us.
