00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:11.637
This is paroksha, is the outside,

00:00:11.717 --> 00:00:16.543
by which your material life can be projected more.

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:20.216
You can see more.

00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:22.997
But if I say you have to see inside,

00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:27.156
you can’t turn your eyes back to see inside.

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:30.198
That you cannot do.

00:00:30.398 --> 00:00:35.865
Now, what is the method by which you can see inside

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:39.865
or feel inside or go inside?

00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.783
Through our eyes our attention goes out.

00:00:43.863 --> 00:00:45.269
We see everything.

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:48.063
But supposing tomorrow something topples down.

00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:52.923
Immediately our attention is attracted towards that happening.

00:00:54.936 --> 00:01:00.372
So inside us there must be some arrangement

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:09.531
for this happening that must be attracting our attention inside

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:13.279
and that’s how we must be going inside.

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:20.812
We have evolved from amoeba to this stage.

00:01:20.892 --> 00:01:23.339
We are human beings.

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:35.513
Our evolution has come through 
our attention fixed outside.

00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:42.879
The happening has to go inside.

00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:49.464
But the evolution so far has been by going outside.

00:01:49.544 --> 00:01:55.791
Like some fishes felt the land and tried to crawl out

00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:59.364
and they became the reptiles.

00:02:01.484 --> 00:02:08.929
The reptiles wanted to run fast 
so they developed four legs as a tortoise.

00:02:10.608 --> 00:02:20.767
As animals they could not eat; 
so they raised their head.

00:02:23.587 --> 00:02:28.214
Things at the height they could not see, 
so they raised their body more.

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:34.619
So all the evolution so far has come 
through the urge of seeking only,

00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:38.004
but it has been outside.

00:02:41.253 --> 00:02:44.320
We have been seeking food,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.069
as human beings we are seeking power,

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:56.150
we have been seeking money, possessions, comfort.

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:07.678
But now the seeking has to go within.

00:03:09.988 --> 00:03:12.408
For example, when we are building a house

00:03:12.488 --> 00:03:17.122
we build all the outside and everything properly.

00:03:19.588 --> 00:03:27.641
When it is all done outside 
then you go inside and start decorating.

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:46.987
In the same way you have to go inside 
to achieve the last breakthrough.

00:03:48.483 --> 00:03:52.685
For example, we have made a fortress for ourselves

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:58.286
and we have to enter inside the fortress

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:01.627
to enjoy it.

00:04:03.113 --> 00:04:08.555
We have to penetrate inside the house to enjoy it.

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:13.294
But our attention is outside. We cannot go inside.

00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:20.923
So something has to happen that you are to be sucked in.

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:26.548
Some sort of a vacuum is created inside 
by which you are sucked in.

00:04:26.628 --> 00:04:33.133
It’s a beautiful arrangement which has been sahaja,

00:04:33.213 --> 00:04:36.339
means spontaneously growing within us.
