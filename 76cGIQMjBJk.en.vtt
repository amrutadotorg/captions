00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:14.640
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.960
It is said about him, that

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.560
He is the first deity that was created on this earth

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:35.840
by Adi Shakti.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.400
And about his creation, you know the story.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.480
And also you know

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.000
how an elephant´s head was attached to him.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.320
Today, I am going to tell something more subtler

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:08.200
about him, Kundalini and the Mother Earth.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.680
He was made out of the Mother Earth,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.680
with the vibrations of his Mother.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.920
Now, the significance of Mother Earth,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.360
we have never understood.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.400
Now look at the Mother Earth,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.560
She is the one who produces all kinds of

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.720
beautiful flowers of different fragrance,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.880
of different nature, color, heights.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.280
The trees are different.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.320
Trees, when they grow up,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.760
they grow in such a manner that every leaf,

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.040
every leaf of that tree, gets the sun.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.760
Look at the collective sense

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.000
which is given to us by this Mother Earth.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.080
We have never realized that this Mother Earth,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.880
which is giving us everything that we want

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.640
and the sun helps the Mother Earth,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.360
cooperates, coordinates with Her.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.200
To go further with it, you have seen that picture

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.440
where the Kundalini is coming out of the Mother Earth,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.120
and half of it is seen.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.880
So what does this Kundalini do for us?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.840
Or what does this Mother Earth do for us?

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.080
The Kundalini leaves the Mother Earth as a reflection,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.560
and what does She do within us,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.560
to build us up in which way?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.200
So it is the primordial power

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.160
which is coming out of the Mother Earth.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.600
Mother Earth itself acts like a Mother,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.680
She looks after you, She gives you whatever you want,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.200
and another miraculous thing is

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.840
that the highest tree is a coconut tree,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.280
and a coconut will never fall

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.880
on any creature or any human being.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.560
That means it´s all thinking,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.440
all understanding, all consciousness,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.760
all awareness is coming from the Mother Earth.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.960
But we never understand.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.800
As it is we take it for granted.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.760
Now what does She do for us, for us human beings?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.240
She´s the primordial power.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.040
What she does is to build in us a primordial

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.840
– what we can call – restrictions

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.960
or primordial taboos or primordial dharmas.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.280
For example, you see the steel is here.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.640
It has its own dharma,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.240
it cannot behave like wood.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.720
Wood has its own dharma,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.760
it cannot behave like silver.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.400
They all have their dharma and they are bound in that dharma.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.360
Everything that is in the nature has its own dharma.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.320
If you see the tiger, if you see the lion,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.560
if you see a mongoose or if you see a snake,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.040
they all have their dharma, their style, their everything.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.040
It´s very surprising, how they are bound by it.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.520
Once in Prathisthan,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.360
I went from the other side to my bedroom,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.000
and I saw a very big snake came out of a hole.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.360
Of course I was quite away from it,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.840
but it felt my vibrations and started running away.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.480
It fell in the swimming pool and it wouldn´t come out.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.000
So somebody went down and killed it

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.560
and brought his body up there.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.040
I was surprised; it was such a big one, about six feet,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.880
but it intertwined itself in a very beautiful pattern,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.800
surprisingly, when it was there. Alright.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.320
Then what they did, they said that, “Mother, if we leave it,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.440
it will fall in the water and again it will come to life,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.840
so what should we do?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.400
I said “Let it be then. What do you do?"

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.520
They said “we burn it”. So they burned the snake.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.760
But the female of the snake came out after 10 days.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.040
They said “there must be a female”,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.560
and she was searching for him

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.400
when suddenly somebody saw her.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.680
They killed her also, they killed her

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.360
and she also made the same kind of a pattern.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.880
I was amazed,

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.800
very beautiful pattern

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.760
of the body going round, like this, like this, like this.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.080
Exactly the same, she also made.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.160
So I was surprised

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.880
how is it that this lady knows how

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.200
to copy her husband?

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.320
She did it, and when we burnt her,

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.880
she was finished of course, both of them were killed.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.520
But what I felt is that animals,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.960
creepers, those who creep permanently,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.360
other people also, every type of animal,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.160
the whole of biology I studied, I was amazed

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.160
that every type of animal has the exact,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.360
the same sample of behavior.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.880
For example, you can put the dog in the water

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.560
he´ll swim, but the cat may not.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.800
See it´s a thing that is built in, the dharma,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.040
what I call the primordial taboos.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.000
We have in the same way, primordial taboos

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.800
built within us, which are dharma.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.240
A human being has to be like that.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.200
If he tries to be something else

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.160
something goes wrong with his life.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.960
It´s like say if you, you have a glass,

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.360
you drop it on the ground, it will break, that is the dharma.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.920
In the same way when human beings

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.960
start deviating from the line of dharma,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.360
they get into trouble.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.080
But it is only human beings who can do that.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.840
They can only cross over these taboos, these primordial taboos,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.520
and can become horrible.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.920
You see a person,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.000
sometimes I wonder what´s wrong with him.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.840
He has a nice home, very good wife, everything,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.320
then he has a keep (another woman), what is the need?

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.480
For a man it is primordial that he should have

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.280
only one wife, and she, one husband.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.120
It´s a taboo, as soon as you deviate from that

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.920
something goes wrong.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.840
Now who punishes, or who corrects or who destroys

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:48.720
is this primordial power which we call as Paramchaitanya.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.800
If you can understand that it´s a structure.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.120
Say this is the structure of this hangar,

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.120
now you want to break it, you can break it

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.920
because you are human beings,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.440
but it will be broken.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.320
As simple as that,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.000
we have to understand we are human beings

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.400
and we cannot do things

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.920
which go against our dharma.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.760
Now why the dharma?

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.840
Dharma has to be there for our ascent.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.560
Now man, in his intelligence and his progressiveness

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.400
thinks that anything he does – what´s wrong?

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.040
Especially in the west, this is very common.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.680
But I must say, for the aboriginal people,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.240
or people who are,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.840
I mean I don´t know if I should call Indians aboriginal or not.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.000
But those people who were made aware

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.720
of their primordial taboos somehow.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.080
As the animals know what is bad for them

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:21.120
and that knowledge was there with aboriginals.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.120
Today we are here with Australians,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.680
and in Australia aboriginals are so many

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.000
I was surprised, most of their words were Sanskrit.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:43.120
So might be they might have got it from India,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.680
or maybe they have gone there from India.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.560
So many words they have got which are Sanskrit.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.320
So I started thinking about them.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.840
Normally aboriginals, say in India we have aboriginals.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:07.360
We call them “gorn, korku, peel”.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.360
We had a lady who was a maid with us,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.920
Gaynabai was her name,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.040
she was an excellent cook,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.200
but she had her maryadas.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.800
All the time, like if my father came

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.360
she would immediately cover her head

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.720
and go in the other room, to respect him.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.360
Nobody told her to do that.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.440
Their marriage system was also very surprisingly good,

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.920
and their relationships with the children also was very good.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.560
Somehow or another in my childhood I met many of them

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.880
because I also had a habit of going to the jungles

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.040
where I used to meet them

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.120
and I was surprised, they would not drink

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:06.000
this I´m telling you was about 60 years back, maybe more.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.000
They would not drink,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.720
very “lajashi” means shame of everything.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.360
A matter of, sort of prestige, for them was important.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.640
They would never steal anything,

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.560
and I was really very impressed,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.680
how these people were so dharmic,

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.120
so good and happy.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.120
They lived in huts, they didn´t mind,

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.520
but they were very clean and neat people.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.480
It is now changed.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.800
The same people have changed so much.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.720
I mean they were like sacred people, I tell you, holy people.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.720
They worship Mother,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.040
they worship Mother Earth, nothing else,

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.040
and I asked this lady “why do you worship Mother Earth?”.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.640
She said “she gives us everything.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.040
She is a just Mother,

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.640
we live in the jungles, she looks after us,

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.880
and she is the most conscious person,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.600
she knows that we are there and she has to look after us”.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:41.080
Even to take out some leaves from the trees,

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.040
they used to think about it.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.920
But then the missionaries came,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.440
they converted them,

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.360
they gave them skirts and blouses

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.720
and I don´t know what all they did.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.520
But Gaynabai did not take,

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.600
she said “what is this?”

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.960
Why should I wear a dress like this

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.480
where the whole body is exposed?

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.240
No I´ll wear a sari, I can never give it up.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.200
Why should I wear this kind of a useless dress?”

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:18.320
But when they met with these so called advanced people

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.000
so many of them started living like that.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.720
They said “you have no freedom;

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.480
you are just bound by something, by someone”.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.640
But actually they were bound by the sacredness,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.000
by the divine understanding

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.760
and then they started changing.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.800
She was alright, her husband was alright

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.240
but her son started drinking,

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.320
this is the beginning of the end,

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.560
then gambling and all other sorts of things he started.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:02.560
Then her grandson started going to prostitutes,

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.920
and the idea was only that “we are free,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.560
what´s wrong?”

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.920
Now these primordial taboos

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.840
are in you, built in. They are there.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.920
These are existing maybe in a potential state,

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.880
maybe you have curbed them down,

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.760
maybe you have turned them out,

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.760
but they are there.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.080
All the time they are there,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.760
and that´s what we say that you are leaving the maryadas,

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.000
or else we say that you are insulting Shri Ganesh.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.440
So when Mother created this universe,

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.880
first deity was Shri Ganesh.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.720
Auspiciousness was created.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.920
Now, we don´t understand what is auspiciousness.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:18.600
Auspiciousness is a complete understanding

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:30.800
of primordial restrictions, and also of the protocol.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.080
For example, in India we all used to do that,

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.800
though I was in a Christian family,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.360
that before touching the Mother Earth,

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.640
getting up from the bed,

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.920
we used to say “Oh Mother Earth, please forgive us

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.240
because we are touching you with our feet”.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.040
So respect for the Mother Earth and for nature

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.880
is built in within us,

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.640
it´s part and parcel, we are part and parcel of this whole

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.560
we can call it whole universe.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000
But when you get into this nonsensical idea of freedom

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.120
then you are leaving your Mother Earth,

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.680
your gravity itself reduces.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.200
This Mother Earth has to teach us,

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.320
while we are plundering everything,

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.480
the ecology, their ecology – ecology people are trying.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.600
Whatever is outside is also inside.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.080
If you want to exploit your Mother inside,

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.480
or if you want to trouble your Mother inside,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.960
you can also trouble this Mother Earth.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:09.080
Now what has replaced our understanding is very simple,

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:20.840
is that we are paying more attention to money.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.200
If you can cut a tree you say, to get money,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.960
then it is hurting the Mother.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.840
But if you are cutting the tree for beautifying her,

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.040
then she´s happy.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.520
Her discretion is so great,

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.880
see the way she produces flowers.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.680
Different, different types of flowers.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.120
In different countries, different types of flowers.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.760
Like I saw in my country

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.520
that flowers are extremely fragrant,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.440
very fragrant.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:08.680
And she understands so much.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.200
Once I went to Australia

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.200
and this flower you call hibiscus,

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.960
it´s a red flower, it becomes pink and then red,

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.000
imagine it becomes first pink

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.920
and then gradually it becomes red.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.000
Even the sunflower goes on turning its face with the sun.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.800
Now how can you say there is no connection

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
between a sunflower and the sun?

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.120
Automatically it goes on changing.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.520
So these hibiscus flowers are the flowers

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.640
which we use to worship Shri Ganesh,

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.000
and the program was to worship Shri Ganesh.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:04.560
On the way I saw so many trees of hibiscus, just flowering.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.360
I said “at this time so many flowers”.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.200
I said “I think you´d better get these flowers for the puja”.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:19.520
I went and when I arrived in the hall

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.960
all the Sahaja Yogis had got hibiscus on their own.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.080
I never talked to them, just on their own.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.360
They didn´t know that it is to be used for Shri Ganesh

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.200
but the Mother Earth herself created at that time.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.480
This is the time of Shri Ganesh when you should get hibiscus.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.160
It´s very remarkable

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.400
how the nature is so much within us

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.080
and how this, whatever it is within us,

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:59.840
guides outside and receives the blessings.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.760
We are not something separate.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.200
This Mother Earth is our home,

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.320
we have a home in her and she has a home within us.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.680
I said today that for Shri Ganesha,

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.400
He had a body of the clay,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.760
just ordinary clay.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.520
So you can imagine,

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.800
if you can really think of it,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
how this whole universe has created us;

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.960
all of it is within us

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.960
and when we try to hurt something,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.040
then we are hurting ourselves.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.200
The intelligence of Mother Earth

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.720
I have seen from my childhood.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.400
It´s such a beautiful thing to know the nature

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.920
and the Mother Earth

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.440
that´s why all the saints, in India especially,

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.000
used to go and live in the forest.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.280
Only in the forest you could see clearly

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:26.520
how this primordial bondage was absolutely obeyed,

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.320
absolutely obeyed, naturally by the nature.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.880
For us it is difficult,

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.600
we are rather, “free” people.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:49.440
So simple things, simple things like a woman

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.280
should be always covered properly in her body.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.880
Because she respects her body,

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.560
she respects her chastity.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.320
But if you tell this to somebody

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.560
they won´t listen.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.520
As you see the evergreens, they are always clad,

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.160
no leaf falls off.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.200
I call them as the females,

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.560
and the other trees, deciduous,

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:27.600
they do lose their leaves so I call them as men.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.640
Because they are men.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.240
Here it´s the other way round, I have seen.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.120
If I used to go to any party

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.800
somehow or another they thought I was a very serene person,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.640
you meet someone, immediately

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.720
the man will button up himself

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.720
and the women will open themselves.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.760
I said the whole brain from here has gone to this side

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.560
and this one has gone this side.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.440
It´s so stupid.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.040
But even Mrs. Thatcher they said that she said,

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:06.000
that it is our culture that women must expose their bodies.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.440
For what? Are they prostitutes or what?

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.440
So this craze of exposure of the body

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.280
has become so strong now that even in India,

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.120
it´s not on the streets or in the household,

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.000
but in the cinema, in films, you see women,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.920
really this never happens in India.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.560
What you see in the films, never happens!

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.680
If they start wearing dresses like that

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.720
so many people will throw stones at them.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.000
Then all other sorts of,

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.280
I shouldn´t say clumpsy but very grotesque

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.920
things happened, like, I can´t understand

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.280
man having relation with man, woman having relation with woman,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.440
and children, and this and that and that.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.560
We didn´t know these things in India, I didn´t know.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.560
Why? Why has it happened here?

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.160
I don´t think 50 years back they used to do that,

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.040
also in these countries.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.720
Why have we given up our sense of shame?

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.760
And this kind of nonsense that has come into us.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.240
I think must be some bhoots in them or badhas in them

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.920
or something horrible,

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.920
but this is something absolutely unnatural.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.000
Absurd!

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.520
Then a married man having eyes on unmarried women

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:56.200
and unmarried men are having relations.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.840
All kinds of things people do.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.520
And you won´t believe, this doesn´t happen in India.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.920
Really I tell you, these days it sort of spread out,

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:15.400
but I would say in good families you don´t have it.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.080
Somebody told me there is AIDS in India,

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.640
yes because they take bath in the river.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.440
If they stopped taking bath in the river this will stop.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.560
I was a medical student, I have studied,

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.160
I came from a very open family,

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.320
I never knew these things,

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.680
that men can do such things, it´s stupid!

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.200
Even in the lunatic asylum in India

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.040
we have never heard of such reports.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.520
This is absurd!!

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.040
You see the children.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.360
The other day Guido gave me a present of a girl,

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.120
who was feeling shy,

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.120
you know, the little girl was holding her frock like this and feeling shy.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:16.160
Shyness is the ornament of women.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.680
Children are all shy.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.160
I remember my granddaughter

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.560
she was once watching one magazine,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.040
she was very small, two years or so.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.720
So she saw one woman in a bikini or something,

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.040
she was hitting her, “what are you doing?”

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.560
She saw in the magazine.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.360
My grandmother will come

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.880
and give you two slaps, you shut up!

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.920
Please wear your dresses”.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.520
They would not. Children don´t like, have you noticed it.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.520
I don´t know if they are advanced,

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:58.680
but normally children don´t like it, this shamelessness.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.840
But the shamelessness has gone,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.480
to such an extent

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:10.360
that to them keeping nude is a very great advancement.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.720
This is nothing.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.320
Somebody told me that he wanted to save the aboriginals

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.040
but they were so much,

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:34.000
so much impressed by the white skin,

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.400
that they accepted everything.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.720
But they were even having relations

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.760
with their own sister, daughter, mother.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.760
Competition.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.480
These are the subjects,

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.520
it´s rather heinous to talk about,

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.280
and I can´t understand

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:02.040
how can a human being go to that level.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:08.800
And at this time we have Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.920
where you have become aware, aware

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.200
of your natural taboos.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.400
It is there, because I told you, potentially it is there,

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.880
it is enlightened and suddenly you have accepted.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.200
I never expected so much, I tell you,

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.960
but you have accepted it,

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.600
and not only that, but you are enjoying it,

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.480
your practicing it.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.400
You see the lives of all the great saints.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:53.080
You can´t have something, like Diana,

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.200
see, they are going to call her a saint.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.240
She had no maryadas.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.640
Oh I have sympathies with her because

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.440
her husband tortured her or maybe something,

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.800
but maryadas are very important.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.120
How can she be a saint?

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:16.760
Now if you become just an ordinary human being

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:22.320
who has his taboos, who understands, who is aware,

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.520
then they will say, “Oh what a man he was”,

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.760
I mean that´s what he was,

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.920
he was born like that,

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:36.440
so such a man is praised, in the West especially.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.800
Also the other way round is that,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.800
now the majority is the law.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.880
If the majority is stupid,

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:52.480
then all the stupidity is regarded as great.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.280
They have no brains they have no intelligence

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.960
to understand how can these things help;

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.920
alcohol for example.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.640
I mean alcohol, it has done no good to anyone,

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:17.480
but alcohol, without alcohol you are no good.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.240
They won´t talk to you they say that

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.320
unless you have alcohol you cannot talk.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.840
And it is so rampant,

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.880
it is so much in the society

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.480
that all the parties I attended,

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.480
except for me and my husband, everybody was drinking,

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:44.000
and drinking much more than normal because it was free.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.640
They are all poisons,

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.320
these are all poisons

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:56.920
spoiling us completely from one to another.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:04.240
This one is a taboo now, for cigarettes,

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.280
imagine – why to smoke?

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.720
I don´t understand, like a chimney people are smoking.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.560
But they have no courage to give it up now.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.800
Everywhere, no smoke, no smoke, no smoke.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.320
When will they start “no alcohol?”

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:34.520
Everybody sees that it´s so dangerous.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.240
It is against human awareness, everybody sees it.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.040
You see people falling down,

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.720
you see people cursing each other, fighting.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.440
I tell you, if you stop this alcoholism

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.760
all this shamelessness will go away.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.520
Because when you take alcohol your awareness is abated.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.360
One alcoholic told me

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.920
“when I take alcohol I don´t see my sister as my sister,

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.760
but see her as my beloved”.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.800
Well how do you do that? “Yes”.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:19.360
But for all social status and all that you must drink.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.520
Now, we don´t even understand how

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:29.280
our primordial taboos are completely battered

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.120
by the society here.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:40.720
The simple thing is that

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:55.560
to understand your own self,

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.880
better sometimes to see the stupid people,

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.240
you´ll be amazed what sort of things they are doing

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.640
because I have seen, I used to be very amazed

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.320
what are they doing?

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.960
And then to cover it up, to cover it up,

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.600
they have etiquettes you know, very elite.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.960
They talk in a very special manner,

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.280
move themselves in a very,

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.640
I should say, like a trained personality

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:44.640
and anybody who doesn´t do that is out of their sight.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:50.280
They think that He lacks eliteness.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:58.400
So another idea is that we have to be elite.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.360
Ganesha is how made – you see that.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.640
Look at him, He´s by no means elite.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:17.040
He eats like a glutton

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:27.120
and He looks at you

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:34.560
as if He´s going to hit you with his mace.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:45.640
For Ganesha there is no forgiveness,

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:52.200
when he became Christ there He developed,

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.320
I don´t know how it worked out,

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:06.360
but as Ganesha there is not at all forgiveness.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.680
Don´t try to ask forgiveness from Shri Ganesha,

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.640
He´ll never forgive,

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.440
even if his mother says “now you´d better forgive”,

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.840
“No, that I´ll not do”.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.160
He never forgives!!

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.200
Then only it comes to the point that the Mother has to say

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.320
“I forgive you”, then He can do it,

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.240
because one thing about Him is,

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.640
He´s extremely obedient to his Mother, absolutely,

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.000
so if the Mother has forgiven, finished.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.800
But otherwise, he will never, never forgive,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:52.520
and that´s why all kinds of these horrible diseases are here.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.520
Thousands of them.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:03.560
Also if you don´t respect Him then impotency can come

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:11.000
or AIDS and all these secret diseases that people have.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:19.240
I had a very bad time with people who suffered

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.040
from these secret diseases,

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:28.520
because Shri Ganesha accepts my forgiveness

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.800
but whenever he has a chance, again He comes back!

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.240
Now see, they are deities with their own dharma.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.160
They too have their own dharma.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.560
He gives you a lot of things, he gives you

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.920
mainly wisdom, discretion, understanding,

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.560
but if you don´t obey Him, his qualities,

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.120
then he´s a very difficult man.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.480
So to tell somebody “Don´t do it” is very difficult,

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.200
but the nature takes respite.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:19.240
If you want to become patient it´s not difficult;

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.520
but to get you cured on the Mooladhara

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.920
is very, very difficult.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.840
You do get cured no doubt, ultimately,

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:38.960
but the most difficult disease is from Mooladhara.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.320
He´s a child, alright,

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:49.600
He´s an eternal child, He´s innocence,

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:56.320
despite all that He cannot forgive you

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.640
if you disturb your innocence.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.920
Mother is just the opposite,

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.000
she wants to save at any cost, she wants to save people.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.680
But not Ganesha,

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.760
Ganesha says “alright,

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.280
you better go to hell”

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.440
and hell is in our own lives here, you see,

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:29.680
those people who like drinking, smoking,

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.760
prostitution all this – this is all hell.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.040
What else is hell?

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:43.680
And he will never save you from hell.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.920
Only in your Aarti, in Marathi, of Shri Ganesha,

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.960
they say that at the time

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:03.400
when I am getting my realization

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.680
you must save me.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.200
That´s the only thing they ask,

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:17.600
at the time of my resurrection you must save me.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.920
It does not say that

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:24.120
at the time of my resurrection you protect me, no!

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.960
You save me.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:34.680
Because he´s the one who is sitting on every chakra

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.480
like a vice-chancellor of the university.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.320
Even if you have Vishnu on your side,

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.040
Mahadeva on your side,

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.040
but if Shri Ganesha is there sitting

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:55.800
and He says “no, not his ascent”,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.320
it doesn´t work out, it´s very difficult.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:06.920
So now I am telling you this that your children are here.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.160
In these modern times

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:13.160
horrible things are happening to children.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:19.160
I mean, I think the whole of this negativity is against the innocence.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.760
Wherever they get the children they misuse them,

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.920
they teach them bad things.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.920
Even the schools everything is so horrid.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.280
So then we have to be careful.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:38.520
We have to be very very careful about our children.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.360
We have to guide them properly, look after them,

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:47.960
and let their primordial taboos should be that,

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:59.000
that restriction, that taboo, that is to be preserved.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.480
So if a child does something nice, appreciate it.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.000
I´m not worried about a child

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.600
being little bit, what you can call,

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:15.480
being a little bit mischievous, here they have to be.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.080
It´s alright.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:25.240
But if he takes to anything that is anti Ganesha, be careful!

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:31.040
All kinds of diseases can develop,

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.400
and if they are destroyed in childhood, these taboos,

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.560
then they are very difficult to revive.

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:43.960
Still I have always said that innocence is never lost,

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.480
only there are some clouds

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.680
which try to cover innocence

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:57.200
and we become rather ignorant about it,

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.080
that we have done anything wrong.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.040
That is your duty.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.080
Your society is horrible.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.880
Next generation I don´t know where it is going to end up.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.840
When I think about it I really get a fright.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.760
The solution is that you have to be

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:32.320
careful about your children and their thinking

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:39.800
and their attitude towards Shri Ganesha.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:46.760
They are special lovable things for Shri Ganesha.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:51.240
You can´t imagine how he loves the children

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:56.120
and he´s always there to protect your children,

00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.920
if he protects anything it is the children he protects,

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:07.760
and if you people really understand what I am saying now,

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:15.160
because if you have to cross this margin

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.960
of human life and spiritual life,

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:24.880
first thing is your Shri Ganesh!

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.240
When Kundalini rises Shri Ganesh is quiet,

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:36.960
he just supports the Kundalini to rise.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:43.040
He´s the one who also suggests to you

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.440
that it´s the wrong way you are doing things.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:56.120
He looks after you, but he´ll not forgive you.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.720
It is not so difficult.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.320
The way people talk

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.160
about their physical needs and all this nonsense,

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.640
even the animals don't talk like that.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:17.880
Try to enjoy things which will give you real enjoyment.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:24.240
For example flowers, nature, garden.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:28.080
Instead of destroying this nature, try to build it up,

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:33.440
try to see how you can make it a beautiful garden,

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:38.480
or a beautiful place.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:41.200
Every time I am here

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.560
I am thinking what should I do with this land here

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:50.760
which is very barren, how can I change it.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.120
All the time there is thought

00:46:54.320 --> 00:47:00.360
about how to make it beautiful,

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:07.320
and in that, if there is innocence,

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.360
no greed,

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:13.120
there is no competition,

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.200
there is no attachment,

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.360
but just to enjoy the beauty

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:24.120
of your own creation, to see how things are.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.720
Out of proportion people have gone,

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.960
out of understanding.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.520
For example, here or anywhere else in Europe

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:41.600
you are not supposed to grow anymore fruits.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.080
Why? Because the price must be kept low.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.040
If you have so many fruits

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:53.560
why don´t you send it to places where they don´t have fruits?

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.480
They will destroy it, finish it, but they will not do that.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:09.520
So the love and feeling for others is not there,

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:16.160
and they destroy if something is overproduced by the Mother Earth

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.960
just to keep the prices high.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.960
Very cruel!

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.040
They are very cruel still.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:31.360
Only thinking about money, money, money, money.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.360
All this happens.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:40.360
So it´s still happening

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:46.560
and I´m sure one day will come when it will all stop.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:57.080
The pubs are the best buildings in the village.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:04.840
Then the way they glorify drinking

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.040
is the best part of it.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:13.080
It´s all done, you see it.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.360
Now only thing I would like you to have a desire

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:23.000
that let drinking be finished, like smoking.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:29.360
If you think like that might solve a little bit.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.480
I personally think

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:39.600
it is with drinking you develop all these perverted attitudes.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:45.440
Otherwise if it´s a normal man with a normal brain

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.840
why should he do such things?

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:53.720
Fighting, quarrelling, killing, violence.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.720
It´s impossible to understand

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:03.480
how can a normal person do such a thing.

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.720
Shri Ganesha gives you balance,

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.320
he keeps you on the proper track.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.200
But if you don´t want to listen to him,

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.200
you are thrown away.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:29.680
I hope you understand our relationship with nature,

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.840
with Shri Ganesha

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:38.800
and with our Kundalini is like,

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:47.120
absolutely identified with each other, absolutely.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.840
If you start loving the nature

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:57.160
all these ideas of spoiling your innocence will be finished.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:02.840
I used to write poetry, I´m very fond of nature,

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:07.920
but then I told myself you have to do work for Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.920
If you take to poetry they´ll all call you a poetess

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.120
and I don´t want to have any such position

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.280
to be a poetess and all that, I gave it up.

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.840
And I was a very good sportswoman.

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:25.800
I used to play things, I used to be first in every sort of game

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.960
and I had championship, this and that. I gave it up.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.280
Whatever I did I used to get into it,

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.120
I studied medicine

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:39.800
I stood in the first at the whole university. I gave it up.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:47.800
Why? Because I´m the Primordial Mother,

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.760
and I have to do the job

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:56.720
of awakening the primordial nature,

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.280
the dharma within human beings,

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:02.840
and that´s what I have to do

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.760
and nothing else.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.800
But for that I don´t do anything I am “Nishkriya”

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.680
I don´t do anything, really I don´t do.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.880
It is done by the nature.

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.640
Done by Shri Ganesha.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.520
Vishnu, Mahesha, everybody, they are doing it.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:27.520
But, then what is the relationship?

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:35.080
The relationship is, they are all in my body

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:39.280
and they are all bound by their own dharma,

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.480
and they act.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.400
This is the relationship,

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:48.360
spontaneous, automatic, like a built-in relationship.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.720
For example, the fan is built in

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.640
so as soon as you push the button it starts moving.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.160
It´s like that.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.720
All of them are related to me,

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.840
and they have a tremendous protocol,

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.280
tremendous respect,

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:15.280
that if I say anything they will not finish it.

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.920
You see this thing is that

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:24.440
very very deep thing that I am telling you,

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.640
that you are a human being,

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.240
that there is built in.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:36.520
Within you are your dharmas

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.440
and if you go against your dharmas

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.320
then you´ll be finished.

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.960
They´re all built in within you,

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:54.040
they are all there, potentially.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:54:00.200
I hope you´ll understand how important it is

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:07.040
to be aware of your restrictions within yourself.

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.680
So thank you very much all of you.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.600
May God bless you!!
