00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.767
Today, we have decided to worship the Yogeshwara.

00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:14.967
I think that is the greatest name of Shri Krishna for us.

00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:20.867
That means He is the Ishwara of yoga.

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:26.700
Yoga means the union, as you know, with the divine.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.800
But also yoga has another meaning which means "yukti".

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.700
In English language to translate it properly is not possible.

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:43.566
We can call it as - "yukti" means the trick.

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:52.700
But trick is always connected with something funny and bad.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.933
But this 'yukti' means the technique. But 'technique' is mechanical.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.600
So I couldn't find any proper word for 'yukti'.

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:09.533
But one can say, it is: to know the technique and the trick of the technique

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.600
is also another meaning of yoga - yukti.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:21.600
So, even if you are connected, if you do not know the trick of the union

00:05:22.067 --> 00:05:28.600
then it is useless, it is of no avail.

00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:36.967
So what one has to learn, after getting realization, is

00:05:37.767 --> 00:05:41.600
not only the technique but the trick of the technique.

00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:46.633
At Krishna's level when we reach

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.600
- it is an incarnation after Shri Rama's.

00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:58.833
So Shri Rama came as a 'Maryada Purushottama', means

00:05:58.867 --> 00:06:13.600
a person who is a complete ideal of maryadas and a benevolent king.

00:06:15.067 --> 00:06:22.600
But in the case of Shri Krishna it was a different phase

00:06:22.733 --> 00:06:26.867
because people had become extremely serious, very disciplined,

00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:34.600
and were leading a life which was, we can say, over-dharmic.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:46.067
And this had put the people at a level, fixed,

00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:50.767
and they thought that "If we are doing all these things every day

00:06:50.967 --> 00:06:54.100
then it's alright. We have reached the last."

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.633
So Shri Krishna had to come -

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.100
Himself, Shri Vishnu, came as Shri Krishna -

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:10.600
to tell us about the ascent, and that - all this is just a play.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:22.067
But only a person who is a master of the play can do the play.

00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:28.600
So to know the play. Supposing you have communication,

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:32.600
you have electrical communications.

00:07:32.967 --> 00:07:37.967
Now you don't know how to play with it - play.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.033
Not how to know or how to connect but to play.

00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:47.600
Supposing only you know all the technique,

00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:52.600
then it becomes quite a headache,

00:07:53.566 --> 00:07:56.600
because all the time you think you are doing it.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.967
You have to do this and, this is to be done, that has to be done,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.600
and this connection is not all right; that should be properly connected.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.733
You get tired and bored.

00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:16.733
But if it's a play for you, just a play. For any master it's a play.

00:08:17.867 --> 00:08:23.600
If it's just a play for you, then you don't feel tired - it's fun.

00:08:25.733 --> 00:08:30.600
And that is what is 'Leela', that's why He is called as 'Leeladhara' -

00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:37.600
because He is a master. He came as a master, master not as a guru,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:46.600
but master of all the arts of this yoga, yukti.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:59.600
So He's so deft, He's so capable, that for Him it's a play.

00:09:01.067 --> 00:09:06.867
All this is a play for Him. And this is what one has to know,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.600
that, in yoga, everything that you do should be just a play.

00:09:14.733 --> 00:09:20.600
Say, getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning, should be a play.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.033
In the morning you get up.

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:32.867
The sun has not yet come, to suggest what you have to do,

00:09:33.767 --> 00:09:38.933
and the moon has departed, and in that twilight

00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:44.600
or a little darkness if you get up, it's very beautiful.

00:09:46.566 --> 00:09:50.566
And at that time you sit down for your dhyan.

00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:58.566
But it's not a serious thing, it's not something that is boring, it's a play.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.833
But for that you have to be a master.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.600
If you are the master of yoga, then it's a play.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.867
So first Shri Rama's state has to be there

00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:19.600
where you become really a Vishwa Nirmala Dharmi

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.600
so that it becomes your play.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:35.600
Now communication with the Divine has to go to the whole world.

00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:44.833
The whole world has to get this communication that you have received.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.833
For this part Shri Krishna arranged something

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:55.000
in His lifetime in a very simple way, as a child.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.600
It looks, very childlike.

00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:07.600
Like when the gopis were taking their baths He hid their clothes -

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:11.033
I mean, Indian women are never fully nude, never -

00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:16.566
He hid their saris and all that and He could see their back,

00:11:16.566 --> 00:11:20.600
this little boy. What is for a little boy?

00:11:22.533 --> 00:11:27.533
He is sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their Kundalini.

00:11:28.767 --> 00:11:34.600
They are coming out of the river Jamuna which is being vibrated by Radha.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.600
Already there are vibrations here, see - raising their Kundalini.

00:11:42.533 --> 00:11:50.666
Then they are taking the water and He breaks their pitchers, from the back,

00:11:50.933 --> 00:11:54.533
which have also got vibrated water in.

00:11:55.666 --> 00:11:59.666
So the vibrated water falls on the backs of these ladies and

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.800
He tries to awaken their Kundalini.

00:12:05.033 --> 00:12:09.000
See the play of a child,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:16.600
how He tried to play in His childhood, just like a child.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:25.600
And then He shows, later on, His child-like expertise

00:12:27.067 --> 00:12:32.033
in dealing with politics, with people, with communication and everything.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.833
And His power was Radha, Radha 'Ra'-'dha' .

00:12:37.867 --> 00:12:41.800
'Ra' means energy, 'Dha' means the one which sustains 'Ra-dha'.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.033
So, "Dharayati sa dharma-ha"  as they say,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.600
in the same way, 'Ra' 'Dha' - the one who sustains the energy.

00:12:52.767 --> 00:12:58.900
So the first quality that He got from Her is - She's the 'Alaahda Dayini'.

00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:03.767
There is no word. I couldn't find a word in English for 'Alaahd'.

00:13:05.067 --> 00:13:10.833
'Alaahd' is when you suddenly see something nice and joy starts.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.833
Just feel very happy.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.600
I mean, there are very few words in English, as you know,

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:25.600
for joy or at the most happiness.

00:13:26.666 --> 00:13:29.666
But 'Alaahd' is a kind of a joy which,

00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:35.600
as you get the fresh air - then how you feel.

00:13:35.666 --> 00:13:38.600
That is Alaahd. So She is 'Alaahda Dayini'.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.600
She's the one who is the giver of Alaahd.

00:13:41.833 --> 00:13:48.867
And so with Her powers, He could work out this Alaahd

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.666
to all the people with whom He was connected.

00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:58.600
So all the gop and gopis who were with Him had to do Ras.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.600
'Ra' is 'energy', 'Sa' means 'with'.

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:05.566
To dance with the energy that is Radhaji.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.733
He used to just play the flute and She used to dance,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.767
the energy used to pass through Her hands to all the other people

00:14:15.833 --> 00:14:19.600
and the Kundalini would be awakened.

00:14:20.933 --> 00:14:24.533
So this was another play that He had.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.600
So in the play only He raised the Kundalini.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.800
But in modern times it's very difficult,

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.566
it is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern times in that way.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:49.867
I mean, nobody will understand also.

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:59.600
So in modern times when Sahaja Yoga is not just raising the Kundalini

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:02.933
but giving the complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga

00:15:03.633 --> 00:15:07.767
and also empowering the person with

00:15:08.067 --> 00:15:12.900
the power to give others realization, it was tremendous task.

00:15:14.566 --> 00:15:17.100
And that's why we had to find out these methods

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.600
by which we could give realization to people.

00:15:24.033 --> 00:15:30.566
In those days Kundalinis were awakened but the Sahasrara was not broken.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.600
So Kundalini must be somewhere hanging in the Agnya,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.566
maybe at heart, maybe somewhere.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:44.600
And such people became the seekers and that's how we find,

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.867
today, people are here as Sahaja Yogis whose Sahasrara's are open

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:54.900
and they know all the yukti of Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:56.566 --> 00:16:03.733
But there are subtler and subtler yuktis of Sahaja Yoga which you have to master.

00:16:04.666 --> 00:16:12.666
The first is that His character was 'madhurya', meaning the sweetness.

00:16:13.967 --> 00:16:20.600
Sweetness. We always say, "He's sweet like honey".

00:16:22.967 --> 00:16:29.600
So when He talked to anyone or He communicated with anyone,

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:39.600
it was through sweetness; and this communication,

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:46.600
if you have not developed, then you are nowhere near Yoga.

00:16:47.933 --> 00:16:53.933
To talk to someone sweetly, automatically.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.566
Everything is madhurya for Him, His talking,

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:08.600
His actions, His face. Everything is madhurya.

00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:15.600
So when we talk of communications first of all the greatest thing is

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.800
the communication between human beings

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.700
and when we have to think of the communication with the human beings

00:17:24.967 --> 00:17:29.600
many people think that by aggression you will communicate better,

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.800
which is not true.

00:17:34.833 --> 00:17:38.867
I mean if somebody wants to get something out of someone, say;

00:17:40.633 --> 00:17:46.600
so you go there and just talk, "I have to have! How can you do it?

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.767
This, that!" As it is - it's no good.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.533
But if you are sweet and start talking sweetly

00:17:58.867 --> 00:18:04.600
then 99% will definitely dissolve.

00:18:05.867 --> 00:18:12.600
So to dissolve people with sweetness - how to do it -

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.800
that trick one has to learn:

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:25.033
how, with sweetness, you can dissolve people.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.867
This is one of His special qualities,

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:35.933
that you talk to someone in such a manner, genuinely,

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:40.600
in a very sweet manner, and

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:49.833
the problem between you and that person will be dissolved, absolutely.

00:18:51.033 --> 00:18:53.600
Now there are many tricks

00:18:54.067 --> 00:19:00.600
and how to talk to someone is one of the biggest things one has to learn.

00:19:02.566 --> 00:19:04.800
First of all, you must always show

00:19:04.833 --> 00:19:08.600
that you are less intelligent than another person.

00:19:13.833 --> 00:19:16.833
Like if I'm talking to a scientist I will say,

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.600
"I'm sorry I don't know any science you know;

00:19:21.767 --> 00:19:28.600
no good for a scientist." So they feel "ah, very good."

00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:40.933
If you have to talk to some musician, you must say "I don't know any music.

00:19:41.867 --> 00:19:47.600
No, I just have learnt a little bit, but not much."

00:19:48.933 --> 00:19:50.933
Musician feels very happy.

00:19:50.967 --> 00:19:55.600
You may call it a pampering of the ego. You may call it [that].

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:02.600
But there's no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared to you".

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:11.600
So the first trick is complete humility when you talk to another person.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.800
It's the sign of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.

00:20:17.867 --> 00:20:23.600
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits they bend down.

00:20:26.867 --> 00:20:34.000
So, first of all, if you say "I am no one. I don't understand anything

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.600
but I would like to hear" this is first.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.933
The first quality of communication is to be

00:20:43.933 --> 00:20:45.933
extremely humble about yourself.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.600
The other person should not know who you are.

00:20:52.933 --> 00:20:56.600
And there's a lot of fun in it.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.633
Say for example now - I can say about Myself

00:21:04.833 --> 00:21:07.933
that My husband was very highly placed in India.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.600
But I met a friend in Delhi - she was studying with Me in school

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.600
and in college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"

00:21:18.767 --> 00:21:20.600
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.533
just a useless, small, little place

00:21:24.566 --> 00:21:27.600
meant for very ordinary officers because they had

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.767
not allotted us any house or anything so, temporarily, we were there.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.767
She said "what? What is your husband doing?"

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.767
I said "He's some government servant." I didn't tell her [his position]!

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.666
He came down, so he just looked at Me and he smiled.

00:21:45.767 --> 00:21:48.600
She said "do you know him?" I said "He's My husband".

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.733
She was shocked!, "He's your husband? Oh my God!

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:56.566
Why didn't you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing changed

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:58.833
and she felt so ashamed of herself.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.600
She had started looking down upon Me,

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.600
"Ah, Married to some clerk or someone."

00:22:09.767 --> 00:22:17.600
So the best thing is to play down. Play down everything.

00:22:18.767 --> 00:22:20.733
Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis they say,

00:22:20.767 --> 00:22:25.600
"oh Mother has giving me such powers. I can do this, I can do that."

00:22:25.933 --> 00:22:28.600
This boastfullness is of no use.

00:22:29.067 --> 00:22:33.100
"I haven't got any powers you see. I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.600
But if you want I can try."

00:22:41.867 --> 00:22:50.967
So, is to play down as much as you can. Practice this at home.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.600
First, practice and then do it.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:02.533
So that is one of the greatest qualities of communication with others.

00:23:05.633 --> 00:23:08.633
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita, if you read it,

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.867
there's one is very important thing,

00:23:09.867 --> 00:23:12.700
It says "Krodhat bhavati sammohah"  (Gita 2:61)].

00:23:12.867 --> 00:23:17.700
You see among all the worst things that we have -

00:23:17.733 --> 00:23:22.600
according to Him we have six enemies.

00:23:25.033 --> 00:23:28.733
But in Gita He started with 'Krodh'.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.600
He said - it starts with krodh, means anger.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.967
If you have anger within you then you are not a master at all.

00:23:41.967 --> 00:23:47.600
There's no need for a master to get angry because he can play about.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.767
He can make you dance like this.

00:23:51.633 --> 00:23:54.600
What is the need to lose your temper?

00:23:55.933 --> 00:23:59.933
But that mastery if you don't have, of handling people,

00:24:00.767 --> 00:24:04.967
then after five/six minutes of talk your voice starts raising

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.933
and something starts barking,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.767
because that temper is still inside you, burning.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.533
But for a master there should be no temper - no need.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.033
He has started with krodha, that: with the krodha all problems start.

00:24:30.733 --> 00:24:33.600
from one to another to another to another.

00:24:33.733 --> 00:24:37.933
So we should watch out if we are angry people.

00:24:41.767 --> 00:24:48.900
Anger comes from Vishuddhi, starts from liver - Vishnu -

00:24:49.566 --> 00:24:51.700
but expressed through Vishuddhi.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.600
Face becomes red, eyes become red.

00:24:55.933 --> 00:25:00.833
From the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible things

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.033
and the whole expression becomes so different when you are angry.

00:25:06.767 --> 00:25:12.600
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it within us? Where is it this anger?

00:25:13.033 --> 00:25:15.733
Liver? alright, I'll put it right."

00:25:15.933 --> 00:25:21.000
So to master it you have to face yourself clearly.

00:25:21.733 --> 00:25:23.600
Many people I have seen people say

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.867
"Mother, do you know, this lady is such a hot-tempered women,

00:25:25.867 --> 00:25:28.967
she is so dominating. She does this, she does that."

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.800
But if you tell her she says, "No no, I don't do that way.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.867
No, no I'm very good."

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:40.600
"But how other's saying that?", "I don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

00:25:41.666 --> 00:25:44.600
If somebody is saying that then you watch yourself -

00:25:45.033 --> 00:25:51.600
do you get into tempers or not? Are you loosing your temper?

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.600
It's very easy to make it out then face it.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.600
So the trick of the trade is to face yourself

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.767
and see for yourself how much you are lacking.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.800
So first is humility, which should be genuine,

00:26:09.033 --> 00:26:16.933
and secondly is equanimity - no temper.

00:26:17.666 --> 00:26:19.600
There is no need to take to temper.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.767
At the most you can say "What are you doing?

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.100
Why are you doing that way?"

00:26:25.566 --> 00:26:28.600
Now if you do something, you know, maybe something I might say which

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.600
I would not like, so I don't want to say."

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:37.600
Like that - at the most! Up to that point is alright;

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.600
that you should say that, "I dislike it", but not to go further with it.

00:26:46.067 --> 00:26:49.867
If you just stop at a point,

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.600
then this habit of getting into temper will go away.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.867
This arrogance will go away, which has to go.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.600
This arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.600
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel very much relieved.

00:27:07.867 --> 00:27:11.867
Because this anger, once it comes in, reacts,

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:17.000
and catches your left Vishuddi, and you become guilty,

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.600
you feel very bad - "Why I said so? I should not have said this."

00:27:23.033 --> 00:27:28.700
So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi, means - it's a headache.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.067
It goes on accumulating like a store house there - all your anger,

00:27:33.533 --> 00:27:37.733
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi catches,

00:27:38.733 --> 00:27:41.700
and you know the problems of left Vishuddhi.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:49.533
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel guilty

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.600
but go before the mirror and slap yourself nicely, twice.

00:27:56.033 --> 00:27:58.600
Now you get angry with yourself, "let me get angry!"

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.600
Then stand before the mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" like that

00:28:05.833 --> 00:28:09.767
In the same manner as you get angry try to act,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
you'll never feel guilty.

00:28:13.533 --> 00:28:16.600
Or maybe more angry - would be better.

00:28:16.867 --> 00:28:19.533
So you empty out your left Vishuddhi.

00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:23.800
Next time you won't do it.

00:28:25.033 --> 00:28:28.933
But feeling guilty means you will repeat and repeat the same thing.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:35.933
So this temper is expressed by men and women differently.

00:28:37.566 --> 00:28:38.600
And I'm very much worried about

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:43.600
the women sometimes because they take to water power - then I'm lost.

00:28:44.733 --> 00:28:48.900
But those who have ego too much, cry much more. That's the sign.

00:28:49.633 --> 00:28:54.600
I've seen. If you say anything to them immediately they start crying,

00:28:56.033 --> 00:29:01.666
because already the left Vishuddhi is there, full, like a full balloon

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.566
and when you touch them it becomes water.

00:29:07.633 --> 00:29:12.867
But men, their temper is a different style, as you know very well,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.833
that: when they get angry they might fight with each other,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.600
box everyone and then settle down nicely and have something to drink.

00:29:25.867 --> 00:29:28.033
"Let us have it out!" you see, they'll say. Take out.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.067
But women don't, they keep it there

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.933
and once they keep it then it becomes tears, it starts coming down.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.067
So, if these are just tears out of joy, happiness, that's different,

00:29:41.767 --> 00:29:45.666
or out of feelings for others - but it is not that,

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.600
but it's tears just to impress another person that

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.600
you are very sad or something.

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:08.633
So the second trick is how to master your own temper

00:30:08.967 --> 00:30:12.600
and the third one is how to master

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:19.600
the temper of others - that's even better.

00:30:22.033 --> 00:30:24.533
I don't know if I have told you the trick of

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.600
Gagangadh Maharaj, when I went to him.

00:30:28.733 --> 00:30:31.533
He is a very hot-tempered avadhuta, sitting on

00:30:31.533 --> 00:30:33.600
a tiger, and he's lost his legs, because he was feeling hot

00:30:33.767 --> 00:30:35.600
so he was sitting in the water

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.967
all the time, so his feet are useless and he goes on a tiger, they say.

00:30:41.033 --> 00:30:43.533
I never saw the tiger, of course.

00:30:43.566 --> 00:30:46.833
But he knows about Me and all that and he told everyone about Me

00:30:46.867 --> 00:30:48.833
so I went to see him.

00:30:49.033 --> 00:30:54.600
And he's supposed to control the rain. It was quite a steep climb

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.633
for about one and a half hours,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.566
and as soon as I stepped in, it started raining, raining,

00:31:01.566 --> 00:31:04.833
raining heavily throughout and he couldn't stop it,

00:31:05.767 --> 00:31:07.733
so he felt very challenged!

00:31:07.933 --> 00:31:11.867
When I went up he was sitting on his own stone outside the cave,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.600
and he was doing like this [twisting his head], with anger.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.633
He didn't know what to do. I looked at him then I walked

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:23.033
into his cave and sat down nicely, then he came, they brought him.

00:31:25.566 --> 00:31:27.600
He touched My feet, everything he did and then he said,

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.600
"You tell me now - why did You not allow me to stop the water?

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.867
You got completely drenched. I'm very angry with this rain I know,

00:31:37.933 --> 00:31:41.666
but why did you do that? Is it to control my ego?"

00:31:41.867 --> 00:31:46.566
I said "No, not at all I never knew you had ego or anything,"

00:31:49.633 --> 00:31:54.767
"Then why?" So - because I'm a master as you know -

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.933
I said "You see you are a sanyasi and you brought a sari for Me,

00:32:00.633 --> 00:32:02.566
that too of an orange colour, and I would

00:32:02.633 --> 00:32:04.933
not take the orange colour sari from you.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.900
Any sari I wouldn't take, because you're a sanyasi.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.600
But I had to get drenched to get the sari, isn't it?"

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:19.600
Immediately - he melted away. But I had to be the master!

00:32:23.067 --> 00:32:31.067
First of all how to melt him, and secondly the master of his mind.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:38.800
This is the subtler part of it. You can be a master of a person.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.867
Like that you can know what he has done for you,

00:32:43.733 --> 00:32:48.000
what he has prepared for you, what is coming for you.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.600
I wouldn't say that you'd know all the whole future.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.867
But if you try just to know about a person -

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.600
you can know everything about that person, very simple.

00:33:00.867 --> 00:33:04.600
So first try to understand a person.

00:33:06.867 --> 00:33:09.867
My father had lots of tricks with him, I know,

00:33:10.666 --> 00:33:13.700
and a very humorous person.

00:33:14.867 --> 00:33:17.600
And one day My brother told Me, Babamama,

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.600
that he has a friend who sings very well.

00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:23.800
So I asked My father "How does he sing?"

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.967
"Oh, he is very courageous," he said. I said "Why?"

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.733
"He sings whether he knows or not - that's the trouble!"

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:37.533
What an exact description he gave Me of this gentleman!

00:33:37.733 --> 00:33:39.033
"He's very courageous you see.

00:33:39.566 --> 00:33:42.033
He doesn't know but he sings - quite alright,

00:33:42.666 --> 00:33:46.100
so he's very courageous." I mean, he didn't say anything against him.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.867
he said "He's courageous" -

00:33:47.967 --> 00:33:50.600
but he gave Me the complete picture of the gentleman that:

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.767
"You have to be careful you see, he might start singing in a funny way,

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.600
you shouldn't laugh." And, all that came in that 'courageous' word.

00:33:57.933 --> 00:34:02.600
In the same way, if you study someone, you see,

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.600
then you will just describe that person in an interesting way,

00:34:11.566 --> 00:34:13.600
and you will not feel that this person has these bad habits

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.600
or those bad habits or this is wrong with him, that is wrong,

00:34:17.733 --> 00:34:21.600
but you'll describe - it's part of that person.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.600
It's a way of knowing a person in totality with all his defects,

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.600
with all his qualities, with everything

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.600
and accepting that person as he is.

00:34:38.533 --> 00:34:40.800
If that mastery you can have.

00:34:41.566 --> 00:34:45.633
Now how will you have? If your attention is not on his

00:34:45.733 --> 00:34:49.666
qualities you'll only know his bad things.

00:34:51.666 --> 00:34:56.700
And if you know his qualities then bad things will be there, a little bit,

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.700
but they'll just be adding a little massala to his character.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.800
You'll feel "ahhhh, that's it, you see, he is a little bit like that."

00:35:07.633 --> 00:35:13.800
Little additional svara (musical note) is added to his character.

00:35:14.733 --> 00:35:19.800
And you wouldn't mind it so much, such a person. You will really enjoy.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.900
Like my son-in-law is very fond of dogs

00:35:24.566 --> 00:35:26.767
and his wife says, "no dog in the house," it's a flat.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.733
So there is a fight between them for the dog.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.033
So Prabhat said "You never meet me,"

00:35:32.566 --> 00:35:38.600
I said "This is not proper but next time I have decided to be a dog,"

00:35:39.067 --> 00:35:45.067
Immediately he took the point. You see, so the way you talk to a person

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:51.600
you can suggest to him what is so special about that person

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.067
or the defects of that person.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.134
But you need not say directly something to him.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.933
If you say indirectly, in such a humorous manner

00:36:06.933 --> 00:36:08.933
that the person will understand.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:17.700
So in communication with others you have to be a very humorous person.

00:36:19.633 --> 00:36:24.767
But mostly I've seen people have humour if somebody cannot walk straight.

00:36:24.833 --> 00:36:27.100
If a physical problem is there they'll laugh.

00:36:27.933 --> 00:36:32.134
If he has not properly made his hair then they will laugh.

00:36:32.666 --> 00:36:37.800
On some sort of a very superficial thing they laugh. This is not humorous.

00:36:38.067 --> 00:36:42.134
This is some sort of a criticism in laughter.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.633
Or some people have a humour like this that they say sarcastic things.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.833
that's no good.

00:36:52.933 --> 00:36:57.600
You say one word to somebody, sarcastic; you think you are very brilliant,

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.867
but you are lost forever for that person.

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.600
That person will remember "He said such a such things to me."

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.933
So sarcasm is against you completely; against Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:09.167 --> 00:37:13.600
If you have to say something, say it in such a manner

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.867
that it doesn't hurt the person,

00:37:17.533 --> 00:37:24.600
and the person enjoys that subtle humour

00:37:24.767 --> 00:37:28.600
and understands also that "This is the problem with me".

00:37:31.134 --> 00:37:41.600
Now in a humorous way, if I have to tell something to you -

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.933
I need not tell you directly, "You are like this, you are like that,"

00:37:45.033 --> 00:37:51.633
but I'll say, "There was one crow which came to my house..."

00:37:52.167 --> 00:37:55.767
and, like that, I can transfer all your qualities to that crow

00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.200
and describe to you and say that, "This crow did like this and did that."

00:38:01.666 --> 00:38:04.767
Immediately you'll start thinking, "Is it about me Mother was saying

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:12.600
or about the crow?" So transfer it to somebody else.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.733
Transfer it to somebody else, that's the best way.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.767
For example, if you want to say that:

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.666
all the names of the people who are coming to the puja

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.767
should be there at the right time.

00:38:25.033 --> 00:38:26.833
So now, this time, Americans [are hosting].

00:38:26.933 --> 00:38:30.134
Alright, "Americans have sent the word..." - they have not -

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.867
"...have sent the word that all the names should be there."

00:38:33.067 --> 00:38:36.600
No harm telling such lies, no harm.

00:38:37.933 --> 00:38:41.533
So that people will not put it on you, they'll not be angry with you.

00:38:41.566 --> 00:38:44.767
At the most they'll be angry with the Americans - doesn't matter,

00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:49.700
for the time being. So transfer it.

00:38:50.134 --> 00:38:56.800
And this transference is 'hastaantar' as they call it.

00:38:56.967 --> 00:39:03.733
To transfer from one hand to another hand, Shri Krishna was an expert.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.600
There is a story about Him

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:13.600
when He is called as Ranchordas, means He ran away from the battlefield.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.733
He doesn't mind "I ran away, so what?"

00:39:18.566 --> 00:39:22.933
The reason was like this: there was a very bad rakshasa

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.833
who had all kinds of boons from Brahmadeva

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.600
and Shri Krishna didn't know how to overcome that,

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.600
nobody knew, and He was killing so many people.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.067
So He thought of a trick, transfer it to somebody else.

00:39:40.867 --> 00:39:45.800
He knew of another great yogi you see, special type,

00:39:46.033 --> 00:39:52.533
who has meditated and taken a boon from the same Brahmadeva

00:39:52.733 --> 00:39:58.600
that: "If I'm sleeping and anybody disturbs my sleep

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.633
and if I open my eyes

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.633
and look at that person, that person should become ashes - bhasma"

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:13.033
So Shri Krishna thought of Him, "Better transfer the job from me to Him."

00:40:13.867 --> 00:40:17.833
So He started running away from the field.

00:40:17.967 --> 00:40:20.833
So this Rakshasa also followed Him.

00:40:21.167 --> 00:40:28.867
Then Shri Krishna stealthily went into the cave of this avadhuta,

00:40:29.134 --> 00:40:35.600
and put His own shawl on top of Him, covered Him,

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.600
and hid himself in the cave.

00:40:41.566 --> 00:40:44.933
Now this Rakshasa came here, he thought this was Shri Krishna who was sleeping,

00:40:45.134 --> 00:40:47.700
"Ahhh now you are tired, you are sleeping.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.833
Now I'm going to see how you can save yourself."

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.566
And he started waking [him] up.

00:40:53.767 --> 00:40:58.933
This avadhuta got up and looked at him and he became bhasma (ashes).

00:40:59.967 --> 00:41:07.633
So transfer your jobs to a more capable (Shri Mataji laughs) person

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:15.134
who can do this better, than taking upon yourself

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.134
straight-forward, going, "Alright,come long, I'll fight with you."

00:41:19.733 --> 00:41:23.933
you cannot win. It's a guerrilla warfare as you call it.

00:41:24.733 --> 00:41:30.167
Transfer it, and you can transfer it to somebody,

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.633
you can make friends with that person, pamper his ego; do what you like.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.733
But the main point is that you should get rid of the ills,

00:41:39.967 --> 00:41:44.800
the bad, the rakshasas. So you can transfer it to anyone.

00:41:47.167 --> 00:41:50.167
And so many tricks He played.

00:41:56.067 --> 00:42:03.967
In the Mahabharata, Bhishma had a blessing

00:42:04.633 --> 00:42:11.600
that, unless and until he wants to die, nobody can kill him.

00:42:14.733 --> 00:42:24.800
So Shri Krishna decided that He should use some tricks.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:31.600
So He told Arjuna that you put him...

00:42:32.134 --> 00:42:33.933
He told Arjuna not himself;

00:42:34.067 --> 00:42:40.600
He was just doing the chariot drivers job - sarathya.

00:42:41.033 --> 00:42:49.033
So Krishna told him that you just make him sleep on the arrows,

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:55.533
let His body be on the arrows and he has to decide that he will die.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:07.933
But Dronacharya was a great guru, also of Arjuna, who was siding with Kauravas.

00:43:08.733 --> 00:43:13.900
Now how can you kill this Dhronacharya, big problem.

00:43:14.833 --> 00:43:22.933
Because you see, he knew all the tricks of archery.

00:43:23.533 --> 00:43:26.800
How are you going to save there?

00:43:29.134 --> 00:43:33.700
Because archery is such a thing that he was the master of archery,

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.033
while Arjuna was his disciple.

00:43:38.134 --> 00:44:03.967
So how to stop him, answering back the arrows of Arjuna?

00:44:04.566 --> 00:44:07.900
How to do that, that he doesn't answer back?

00:44:08.134 --> 00:44:17.167
Because he was a master. So Krishna organized it, in a very special way.

00:44:17.767 --> 00:44:22.067
He got a Shikhandi, a eunuch.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.600
What is the advantage of having a eunuch? Of course it's a big story

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:32.767
how they became Shikhandi. But He got him in front of Arjuna.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.666
A eunuch in India is regarded as a woman,

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:46.666
so Dhronacharya said, "I cannot kill a woman,"

00:44:48.666 --> 00:44:52.800
and that's how He killed Dhronacharya.

00:44:54.067 --> 00:44:59.733
So [He played] these tricks, because to get rid of ill is the main thing.

00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:01.933
To get rid of the ill -

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.767
if you are not capable - you better tell somebody else to get rid.

00:45:05.767 --> 00:45:10.733
Because that is very important - to get rid of the evil -

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.633
and if you can transfer this to somebody else who is more capable,

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:21.633
in your own humility, you'll do much better than to directly attack that person.

00:45:22.566 --> 00:45:24.666
That's Tomfoolery. No use.

00:45:26.033 --> 00:45:29.134
So this was the trick of Shri Krishna throughout.

00:45:29.733 --> 00:45:35.867
If you have seen Mahabharata. Shri Krishna told Arjuna that,

00:45:36.134 --> 00:45:41.566
"Either you can the have all of My army or you can have Me."

00:45:42.067 --> 00:45:46.566
Same He told to the Kauravas. The Kauravas said, "We'll have your army."

00:45:46.967 --> 00:45:51.200
But Arjuna said, "You will be mine, Krishna You'll be on our side."

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:56.800
But He said, "No, I'll be just on the chariot. I'll not hold any weapon."

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:03.800
But He is a master of tricks. He does not need any weapons with Him.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.033
Without weapons also He can do everything.

00:46:06.933 --> 00:46:12.600
So Arjuna said, "alright, You be my chariot driver," and He was there.

00:46:13.933 --> 00:46:21.600
Because Shri Krishna knew about each and every thing, mostly He used to smile.

00:46:23.533 --> 00:46:25.800
Now, if somebody's telling Me something,

00:46:26.633 --> 00:46:30.533
sometimes you will find I also smile, but I try to control

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.767
because I don't want them to see.

00:46:32.967 --> 00:46:37.700
But I know what they are doing, what they're up to, what is their trick.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.600
Because you are such a trick master you know all the tricks

00:46:42.167 --> 00:46:44.666
and you know what they are playing with you.

00:46:44.867 --> 00:46:50.134
So you just smile about it, just to smile in a very sweet way,

00:46:50.533 --> 00:46:54.933
"ah, that's it. Ah, of course, what you say is true, no doubt."

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.767
But, by this kind of thing, you'll be surprised, your communications

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.833
will improve very much with others.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.033
Now some people I've seen in Sahaja Yoga - very common, very common,

00:47:10.633 --> 00:47:16.767
"Mother", they came and told me, "our leader told me, that you are bhootish."

00:47:17.833 --> 00:47:19.700
What is bhootish?"

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:23.733
Another one says, "But he told me that you are a bhoot," - alright.

00:47:23.933 --> 00:47:28.566
And somebody says, "Mother no he told me that you have got a bhoot in you.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.900
Now what are these three categories? Tell us."

00:47:33.833 --> 00:47:38.867
Why to tell anybody you are bhootish or anything? There's no need.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:43.600
If you know how to correct it, just say "left Swadisthana" and correct it.

00:47:43.733 --> 00:47:47.633
Take it out. Ask him, if he had any guru or anything.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.767
Alright, if the person is good natured and a good person

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.533
then it's even more important.

00:47:54.767 --> 00:47:57.733
You should say "It's nothing, you see, it's just a badha from outside.

00:47:57.767 --> 00:47:59.600
We'll have to take it out."

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.833
But a person who has got agnya and all these things,

00:48:04.867 --> 00:48:09.134
plus that he has got this left Swadisthana,

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.933
then, of course, you should say, "Baba, we cannot help you,"

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.800
because you know he is cunning.

00:48:15.666 --> 00:48:17.200
What's the use of playing with that?

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.033
But in Sahaja Yoga we forget.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:24.600
Anybody who comes "Alright, come along, come along, come along."

00:48:26.566 --> 00:48:32.666
Everybody is not capable of Sahaja Yoga, one has to know that.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:34.867
Not the whole world.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.800
Sahaja Yoga can only be given to people who are deserving,

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:47.000
who are seekers and who are courageous - viras.

00:48:47.733 --> 00:48:49.833
It's not meant for ordinary people.

00:48:50.666 --> 00:48:55.600
So we open our door to everyone and all such people walk in

00:48:55.733 --> 00:48:59.933
and then we work very hard on them, do all kinds of things,

00:49:00.633 --> 00:49:03.800
and we find that they create problems for us.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:09.633
So first, only deal with people who are simple,

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.867
as Shri Krishna dealt with gopas and gopis;

00:49:13.933 --> 00:49:18.933
and then we can see, in a collective way, if we can face somebody who's complicated.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:26.000
But no use transforming Hitler or Rajneesh, not possible.

00:49:27.167 --> 00:49:31.167
So one should not try to do impossible tasks in Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.933
which Shri Krishna has shown in His own character

00:49:35.867 --> 00:49:39.833
by avoiding things which He didn't want to do - no.

00:49:42.566 --> 00:49:45.700
And He did it because He was such a master.

00:49:46.833 --> 00:49:51.134
Of course, for Him, it was not necessary to face himself

00:49:51.566 --> 00:49:53.800
to master himself, because He knew himself,

00:49:53.967 --> 00:49:58.000
He is the Ishwara of yoga, He knew everything.

00:49:59.134 --> 00:50:00.833
When you know everything

00:50:00.933 --> 00:50:03.933
there is no need for you to master, what are you going to master?

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.800
On the contrary you sometimes get frightened of yourself, that you know so much.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:19.600
So, best is that, when we are dealing as human beings in Sahaja Yoga,

00:50:19.833 --> 00:50:24.134
we have to know ourselves very well - "Now oh that's my speciality."

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.600
In that you have to see: "How I face myself all the time?

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:36.967
Why do I say such a thing? What is lurking in my mind?"

00:50:38.633 --> 00:50:43.033
Negativity is something to be seen very clearly within yourself.

00:50:43.833 --> 00:50:46.134
As I must have told you so many examples

00:50:46.666 --> 00:50:48.633
that the western negativity is like this

00:50:48.633 --> 00:50:53.000
that, their minds are all the time labor saving devices.

00:50:54.833 --> 00:50:57.900
They don't like to work anyway.

00:50:58.067 --> 00:51:05.767
For example, you tell them "You go and telephone to someone."

00:51:06.134 --> 00:51:09.600
Immediately they will tell you ten explanations:

00:51:09.767 --> 00:51:14.867
he may not be there, his wife will shout, he might have gone to work,

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.933
it's ten o'clock, this, that.

00:51:19.867 --> 00:51:24.933
But if you telephone he's there, but they won't telephone.

00:51:25.967 --> 00:51:30.600
Hundred excuses. Now new excuses have started:

00:51:30.767 --> 00:51:34.900
"the computer was not working, fax was not working."

00:51:35.533 --> 00:51:38.633
Except for your brain everything works.

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.033
But the other way around it is:

00:51:42.767 --> 00:51:46.633
your brain is not working and everything is not working.

00:51:46.933 --> 00:51:50.800
"The lights were not working." I mean, whatever it is.

00:51:51.633 --> 00:51:56.900
But you must learn, "Why can't I find the solution?

00:51:58.533 --> 00:52:00.800
I must do something."

00:52:01.666 --> 00:52:04.767
Like I have told you, the tip of a root -

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.867
how it manages to go round and round and seek the source of water.

00:52:11.967 --> 00:52:14.600
In the same way, are we doing something about it?

00:52:14.666 --> 00:52:16.800
Alright, if this is not available, do that,

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.167
if that is not available do this.

00:52:19.733 --> 00:52:23.134
Out of nothing you can do so many things.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:29.867
But if you want to find out all the time "That cannot be done, that cannot be done".

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.000
[That was] not [the case] with Shri Krishna!

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:37.600
After all He was the incarnation of Virata,

00:52:38.134 --> 00:52:40.600
the Master of Masters we should say.

00:52:40.833 --> 00:52:47.600
Like when Draupadi was in trouble - Draupadi was actually Vishnumaya His sister -

00:52:48.633 --> 00:52:50.167
She thought of Shri Krishna.

00:52:50.633 --> 00:52:55.967
She was holding onto her sari, when it was pulled out by Duryodhana.

00:52:56.134 --> 00:52:58.633
And She was holding it like this (with Her teeth). "Kri",

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.933
She wanted to say "Krishna" but She said, "If I say 'shna' it will fall down."

00:53:02.566 --> 00:53:04.600
So She was holding on.

00:53:04.967 --> 00:53:07.767
As soon as She dropped it, "shna",

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:15.666
sari dropped out (of Her mouth), then it's described, about Shri Krishna,

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:24.767
"Dwarika me shora bhayo, shor bhayo bhare.

00:53:24.933 --> 00:53:30.600
Shankha chakra gadaa padma, Garuda laysidhare."

00:53:32.033 --> 00:53:36.700
[Meaning:] that sound went into Dwarika. Now where is Dwarika

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.967
and where is Hastinapur - at least a distance of two thousands miles [apart].

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:50.933
But the sound went through Chaitanya and made a big sound there;

00:53:52.533 --> 00:53:55.633
and "Shankha Chakra Gadaa Padma".

00:53:55.867 --> 00:53:59.633
Shankha, Chakra Gadaa, Padma are the weapons (of Vishnu) as you know.

00:53:59.833 --> 00:54:05.600
All of them He took and came on His Garuda

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.033
to save the chastity of His sister -

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:14.767
immediately, spontaneously, that moment.

00:54:15.033 --> 00:54:19.967
He could have said, "Alright let it be, let one sari come out then I'll go later."

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:27.900
I'm sure He must have stolen My saris which you give for My Pujas,

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.833
which are too many!

00:54:30.167 --> 00:54:36.100
That's what I feel, that, from where did He get all these saris to give to Her?

00:54:36.733 --> 00:54:39.800
Must be from My own storage I'm sure,

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.033
and that's why you are giving Me so many saris,

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.100
so that He can save the chastity of many women.

00:54:49.833 --> 00:54:55.566
All this is so related, so connected, so one, so united.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:00.867
There's such a big drama going on but you can't see it.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:06.533
But if you believe in yourself

00:55:06.967 --> 00:55:14.000
and if you really believe that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:55:14.933 --> 00:55:20.600
that: what are your qualities, what you are, what's your value is,

00:55:22.134 --> 00:55:28.100
then I'm sure you can become masters.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:32.633
But first of all we have no value of our realization.

00:55:33.833 --> 00:55:36.800
We do not know what we are capable of, what we can do.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.800
You still think, "oh, I was such an ordinary person,

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:44.600
Mother has given me realization. I have never been to university."

00:55:44.767 --> 00:55:46.633
Nobody has been to university.

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.900
I mean, if you see, Rama never went to any university,

00:55:54.067 --> 00:55:56.700
Krishna never went into university,

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:01.566
Christ never went to any university, an ordinary man, a son of a carpenter.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:06.767
But you are realized souls but you don't realize your worth and value.

00:56:07.167 --> 00:56:09.800
Once you realize it, you will just smile at everything.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.600
Because you don't know you are sitting on top of the world.

00:56:15.334 --> 00:56:18.566
Once you know that - only then your mastery will work.

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.666
Otherwise imagine a master sitting under the foot of a disciple,

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.767
what will it look like?

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.100
But it's not that you dominate

00:56:28.633 --> 00:56:33.600
but you are in charge, absolutely in charge.

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:38.833
You know everything, you know how to handle, you know how to manage.

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.666
This is the mastery you have to get.

00:56:41.933 --> 00:56:46.200
This is possible, absolutely possible, for all of you to do it.

00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.967
But the first and foremost thing you have to know

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.600
is that we have to master ourselves.

00:56:52.533 --> 00:56:54.334
But then immediately people say

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:59.733
"Mother it's the most difficult to master yourself."

00:57:01.833 --> 00:57:03.833
I can't understand this.

00:57:04.967 --> 00:57:09.600
Why not? You try to master everyone, why can't you master yourself?

00:57:10.967 --> 00:57:15.900
Yourself is with you, you are with yourself, it's your own,

00:57:16.334 --> 00:57:22.134
it's your own property. You can correct the property of others,

00:57:22.267 --> 00:57:24.600
why can't you correct your own property?

00:57:26.033 --> 00:57:27.600
It should be the easiest thing to do

00:57:27.633 --> 00:57:30.700
but you're not sure that this is your own,

00:57:30.967 --> 00:57:34.633
you do not know that you are capable, but you are

00:57:34.933 --> 00:57:39.134
and now you have Self-knowledge, so why should you not do it?

00:57:40.566 --> 00:57:44.267
Why should you not try to watch yourself and see for yourself?

00:57:44.566 --> 00:57:50.600
And then you will know that you know all the tricks, the yukti.

00:57:52.666 --> 00:57:55.234
I don't have to tell you "do this, do that," nothing!

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.767
You yourself will know "ha, come along!"

00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:06.533
We know so many things, little things, about ordinary material things:

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.967
something's falling? Alright - put some support to it.

00:58:11.267 --> 00:58:14.234
This is happening? Put it that way.

00:58:14.867 --> 00:58:19.600
But in spiritual life it's the easiest thing

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:23.000
because you are in the ocean of knowledge.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.067
But if you do not know that you are, in the ocean of knowledge,

00:58:29.566 --> 00:58:32.833
you will not know the tricks, of dealing with others.

00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:38.000
Because the main purpose of our communication is to emancipate

00:58:38.033 --> 00:58:40.933
the whole world, to emancipate them.

00:58:41.067 --> 00:58:43.900
To bring them out of their ignorance.

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:47.633
So for that we have to develop this mastery

00:58:49.967 --> 00:58:52.967
and not to get lost into nonsensical things

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.600
but this mastery has to be developed.

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.733
For that, meditation early in the morning is required

00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:04.600
- to begin with. And then facing yourself

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.633
all the time, "Why did I say such a thing?"

00:59:08.967 --> 00:59:14.600
"Aah must be this. This is the word I picked up from that person."

00:59:16.733 --> 00:59:19.600
So when you start facing yourself, you will be surprised

00:59:19.666 --> 00:59:26.167
that you are trying to avoid the reality and just using your mind.

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.833
See there, as I say, that this mind cheats you

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:34.600
and tells you, "all right, forget it".

00:59:37.566 --> 00:59:40.234
And the last, but not the least,

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:49.633
is that Shri Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama.

00:59:50.933 --> 00:59:59.600
He creates drama, He acts in the drama, and He's the spectator also.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.933
In these three forms you should see yourself.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:10.300
You create the drama of yourself, "aha this one now, see now,

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.767
how I'm acting here!"

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.900
Then you become the spectator also.

01:00:17.334 --> 01:00:20.600
Become the spectator of your own dramas,

01:00:21.234 --> 01:00:25.666
then you will realize what you are doing,

01:00:26.566 --> 01:00:29.234
how you are working out everything.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:35.600
Then the deception that we have, all the time, against ourselves,

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:38.100
will just run away.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.600
Because if an artist knows he's the spectator,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.600
if the one who is acting knows he is the spectator,

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:51.600
he can never deceive himself, because He knows this is acting.

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.600
So this self-deception is the one [that] one should try to avoid -

01:00:59.067 --> 01:01:01.000
"let me face it."

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.300
But also there is another way out, people find out.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.300
I mean, there are ways and ways.

01:01:07.733 --> 01:01:11.566
Like you tell somebody, "why didn't you write a letter?"

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.933
"I know!" 'I know' means what?

01:01:14.767 --> 01:01:17.867
"But don't you think you should have written a letter to that person,

01:01:18.134 --> 01:01:21.600
who has done so much for you?" "I know."

01:01:24.067 --> 01:01:26.933
"But don't you think it's very bad and cruel on your part

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.767
not to have written the letter?" "I know."

01:01:30.033 --> 01:01:35.967
'I know' means what? "I know I'm bad. I know I have been stupid.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.767
I know I should not have done it. But I know also that."

01:01:39.933 --> 01:01:41.933
So what next?

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.867
Because they think that if they have confessed that "I know," [it's] finished!

01:01:46.267 --> 01:01:49.533
So this is a new escape which was not [there] at the time of Shri Krishna,

01:01:49.666 --> 01:01:54.267
it's a new modern one, where people say "I know, alright so what?"

01:01:54.566 --> 01:02:00.200
"Ohhh alright I'm a sinner so what?" This is the second side of it.

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:03.234
First of all "I know that I'm a sinner"

01:02:03.533 --> 01:02:09.600
and second is a higher state is that: "so what, what's wrong?"

01:02:10.234 --> 01:02:15.833
So this is how the derailment starts and one goes from one to another.

01:02:16.234 --> 01:02:20.900
If I know something then why shouldn't I correct myself?

01:02:23.867 --> 01:02:29.900
That's what it should be. "I know I'm like that I know it."

01:02:31.134 --> 01:02:35.600
If you know then you should also know the trick - how to get rid of it.

01:02:35.767 --> 01:02:40.933
Because you are detached from that personality about which you know,

01:02:41.334 --> 01:02:42.900
you can correct yourself.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:48.867
This is what yoga is, where all your attention is one with the Divine

01:02:49.334 --> 01:02:53.100
and you are so detached that you can see it.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:01.700
The attachment to all the things are finished

01:03:02.033 --> 01:03:06.700
and now the force that is coming to you is acting through you

01:03:06.767 --> 01:03:10.167
and acting on these attachments also.

01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:18.733
The situation changes, absolutely, in Sahaja Yoga in a very different way,

01:03:18.967 --> 01:03:22.100
and if there is one bad Sahaja Yogi who comes in,

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:25.100
either he's thrown out or he has to be alright.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.600
It's the other way around.

01:03:27.767 --> 01:03:30.967
Anyone who is a bad Sahaja Yogi, if he comes in Sahaja Yoga,

01:03:31.134 --> 01:03:34.600
then he has to be corrected, otherwise thrown out.

01:03:35.566 --> 01:03:40.767
It is a, I think, a more evolved state now

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:45.666
than it was at the time of Shri Krishna, because He talked only to one, Arjuna.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.733
Now I'm talking to thousands - this knowledge.

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:54.833
That time He just talked about it at the time of war.

01:03:54.867 --> 01:03:57.200
I'm talking at the time of peace.

01:03:58.134 --> 01:04:03.533
And it's much more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give him realization.

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:07.067
But you have got the realization, you've got the knowledge,

01:04:07.134 --> 01:04:10.700
you know everything. You have all the subtle ideas.

01:04:10.933 --> 01:04:16.200
So this is what it is today, as it is, the situation is that

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.600
you have become part and parcel of Virata already.

01:04:19.833 --> 01:04:21.600
You have not seen the Virata (as Arjuna did),

01:04:21.633 --> 01:04:23.800
but you are part and parcel of it.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.967
You are not watching it, you are inside it.

01:04:27.566 --> 01:04:34.200
So that anymore of not watching yourself,

01:04:34.967 --> 01:04:39.267
will be only thing that you'll be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:45.200
Or else you better watch yourself and correct yourself

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.700
and be one with the body of the Virata.

01:04:49.833 --> 01:04:52.800
This is the sign of a Yogeshwara,

01:04:53.067 --> 01:04:58.100
and that's how you have to be, in a mood which is very smiling,

01:04:58.733 --> 01:05:02.267
knowing everything and not sarcastic,

01:05:02.867 --> 01:05:09.300
but [with a] very paternal smile, very loving, affectionate smile,

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.767
that you should have for all the other people

01:05:13.767 --> 01:05:15.234
and immediately they'll recognize.

01:05:15.533 --> 01:05:18.600
I have seen small children are like that.

01:05:19.134 --> 01:05:21.767
They are extremely patronising sometimes, you know.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.767
They see their parents and this and that.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:29.800
So they come and tell you that, "don't worry everything will be all right,

01:05:29.867 --> 01:05:32.867
after all God is there to look after."

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:40.533
And they can be extremely loving and kind and the way they talk

01:05:40.633 --> 01:05:42.600
they will neutralize the whole thing.

01:05:42.767 --> 01:05:45.600
So we have to learn a lot from our children,

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.600
from all the little babies that we have

01:05:48.733 --> 01:05:55.600
and that we ourselves should have that Ganesha principal within us,

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.234
with innocence we should work it out.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:02.267
Innocence is the most intelligent thing and most effective thing.

01:06:02.867 --> 01:06:06.700
So I would request you, all of you, to face yourself

01:06:07.533 --> 01:06:10.200
and don't hate yourself but correct yourself,

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:14.600
respect yourself and try to evolve your own glory.

01:06:14.733 --> 01:06:17.767
May God bless you.
