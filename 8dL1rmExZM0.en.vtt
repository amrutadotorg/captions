03:50.180 --> 03:57.614
1991-09-01 Shri Krishna puja - The technique of the play, Cabella, Italy

04:00.010 --> 04:07.077
Today, we have decided to worship the Yogeshwara.

04:08.377 --> 04:15.277
I think that is the greatest name of Shri Krishna for us.

04:16.177 --> 04:21.177
That means He is the Ishwara of yoga.

04:22.843 --> 04:27.010
Yoga means the union, as you know, with the divine.

04:28.010 --> 04:32.110
But also yoga has another meaning which means yukti.

04:32.910 --> 04:37.010
In English language to translate it properly is not possible.

04:37.177 --> 04:43.876
We can call it as... Yukti means the trick.

04:44.177 --> 04:53.010
But trick is always connected with something funny and bad.

04:53.110 --> 04:58.243
But this 'yukti' means the technique. But 'technique' is mechanical.

04:58.910 --> 05:01.910
So I couldn't find any proper word for 'yukti'.

05:02.177 --> 05:09.843
But one can say it is: to know the technique and the trick of the technique

05:10.110 --> 05:15.910
is also another meaning of yoga - yukti.

05:17.043 --> 05:21.910
So, even if you are connected, if you do not know the trick of the union

05:22.377 --> 05:28.910
then it is useless, it is of no avail.

05:29.943 --> 05:37.277
So what one has to learn, after getting realization, is

05:38.077 --> 05:41.910
not only the technique but the trick of the technique.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.943
At Krishna's level when we reach

05:47.910 --> 05:51.910
- it is an incarnation after Shri Rama's.

05:53.077 --> 05:59.143
So Shri Rama came as a 'Maryada Purushottama', which means

05:59.177 --> 06:13.910
a person who is a complete ideal of maryadas and a benevolent king.

06:15.377 --> 06:22.910
But in the case of Shri Krishna it was a different phase

06:23.043 --> 06:27.177
because people had become extremely serious, very disciplined,

06:27.377 --> 06:34.910
and were leading a life which was, we can say, over-dharmic.

06:37.110 --> 06:46.377
And this had put the people at a level, fixed,

06:47.843 --> 06:51.077
and they thought that "If we are doing all these things every day

06:51.277 --> 06:54.410
then it's alright. We have reached the last."

06:55.010 --> 06:57.943
So Shri Krishna had to come -

06:58.410 --> 07:01.410
Himself, Shri Vishnu, came as Shri Krishna -

07:02.110 --> 07:10.910
to tell us about the ascent, and that - all this is just a play.

07:16.010 --> 07:22.377
But only a person who is a master of the play can do the play.

07:23.243 --> 07:28.910
So to know the play. Supposing you have communication,

07:29.976 --> 07:32.910
you have electrical communications.

07:33.277 --> 07:38.277
Now you don't know how to play with it - play.

07:38.910 --> 07:43.343
Not how to know or how to connect but to play.

07:43.976 --> 07:47.910
Supposing only you know all the technique,

07:49.243 --> 07:52.910
then it becomes quite a headache,

07:53.876 --> 07:56.910
because all the time you think you are doing it.

07:56.910 --> 08:00.277
You have to do this and, this is to be done, that has to be done,

08:01.010 --> 08:05.910
and this connection is not all right; that should be properly connected.

08:06.910 --> 08:09.043
You get tired and bored.

08:10.077 --> 08:17.043
But if it's a play for you, just a play. For any master it's a play.

08:18.177 --> 08:23.910
If it's just a play for you, then you don't feel tired - it's fun.

08:26.043 --> 08:30.910
And that is what is Leela, that's why He is called 'Leeladhara' -

08:31.143 --> 08:37.910
because He is a master. He came as a master, master not as a guru,

08:37.910 --> 08:46.910
but master of all the arts of this yoga, yukti.

08:50.110 --> 08:59.910
So He's so deft, He's so capable, that for Him it's a play.

09:01.377 --> 09:07.177
All this is a play for Him. And this is what one has to know,

09:07.910 --> 09:13.910
that, in yoga, everything that you do should be just a play.

09:15.043 --> 09:20.910
Say, getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning, should be a play.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.343
In the morning you get up.

09:26.976 --> 09:33.177
The sun has not yet come, to suggest what you have to do,

09:34.077 --> 09:39.243
and the moon has departed, and in that twilight

09:39.943 --> 09:44.910
or a little darkness if you get up, it's very beautiful.

09:46.876 --> 09:50.876
And at that time you sit down for your dhyaan.

09:51.043 --> 09:58.876
But it's not a serious thing, it's not something that is boring, it's a play.

10:01.143 --> 10:04.143
But for that you have to be a master.

10:05.910 --> 10:10.910
If you are the master of yoga, then it's a play.

10:11.310 --> 10:14.177
So first Shri Rama's state has to be there

10:14.343 --> 10:19.910
where you become really a Vishwa Nirmala Dharmi

10:21.010 --> 10:25.910
so that it becomes your play.

10:28.110 --> 10:35.910
Now communication with the Divine has to go to the whole world.

10:37.976 --> 10:45.143
The whole world has to get this communication that you have received.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.143
For this part Shri Krishna arranged something

10:49.876 --> 10:55.310
in His lifetime in a very simple way, as a child.

10:56.410 --> 11:00.910
It looks, very childlike.

11:01.377 --> 11:07.910
Like when the Gopi's were taking their baths He hid their clothes -

11:08.177 --> 11:11.343
I mean, Indian women are never fully nude, never -

11:12.177 --> 11:16.876
He hid their saris and all that and He could see their back,

11:16.876 --> 11:20.910
this little boy. What is for a little boy?

11:22.843 --> 11:27.843
He's sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their Kundalini.

11:29.077 --> 11:34.910
They're coming out of the river Jamuna which is being vibrated by Radha.

11:35.910 --> 11:39.910
Already there are vibrations, you see - raising their Kundalini.

11:42.843 --> 11:50.976
Then they are taking the water and He breaks their pitchers, from the back,

11:51.243 --> 11:54.843
which have also got vibrated water in.

11:55.976 --> 11:59.976
So the vibrated water falls on the backs of these ladies and

12:01.110 --> 12:05.110
He tries to awaken their Kundalini.

12:05.343 --> 12:09.310
See the play of a child,

12:10.110 --> 12:16.910
how He tried to play in His childhood, just like a child.

12:18.110 --> 12:25.910
And then He shows, later on, His child-like expertise

12:27.377 --> 12:32.343
in dealing with politics, with people, with communication and everything.

12:35.210 --> 12:38.143
And His power was Radha, Radha 'Ra' 'dha' .

12:38.177 --> 12:42.110
'Ra' means energy, 'Dha' means the one which sustains 'Ra-dha'.

12:43.910 --> 12:46.343
So the "Dha Re Di Sa Dharmaha"  as they say.

12:46.910 --> 12:51.910
In the same way Radha 'Ra' 'Dha' - the one who sustains the energy.

12:53.077 --> 12:59.210
So the first quality that He got from Her is - She's the 'Alaahda Dayini'.

12:59.943 --> 13:04.077
I couldn't find a word in English for 'Alaahd'.

13:05.377 --> 13:11.143
'Alaahd' is when you suddenly see something nice and joy starts.

13:12.143 --> 13:14.143
Just feel very happy.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.910
I mean, there are very few words in English, as you know,

13:16.910 --> 13:25.910
for joy or at the most happiness.

13:26.976 --> 13:29.976
But 'Alaahd' is a kind of a joy which,

13:30.177 --> 13:35.910
as you get the fresh air - then how you feel.

13:35.976 --> 13:38.910
That is Alaahd. So She is 'Alaahda Dayini'.

13:38.910 --> 13:41.910
She's the one who is the giver of Alaahd.

13:42.143 --> 13:49.177
And so with Her powers, He could work out this Alaahd

13:49.910 --> 13:52.976
to all the people with whom He was connected.

13:53.343 --> 13:58.910
So all the Gopas and Gopis who were with Him had to do Rasa.

13:59.010 --> 14:01.910
'Ra' is 'energy', 'Sa' means 'with'.

14:02.143 --> 14:05.876
To dance with the energy that is Radhaji.

14:06.110 --> 14:11.043
He used to just play the flute and She used to dance,

14:11.310 --> 14:16.077
the energy used to pass through Her hands to all the other people

14:16.143 --> 14:19.910
and the Kundalini would be awakened.

14:21.243 --> 14:24.843
So this was another play that He had.

14:25.010 --> 14:28.910
So in the play only He raised the Kundalini.

14:31.910 --> 14:35.110
But in modern times it's very difficult,

14:37.210 --> 14:41.876
it is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern times in that way.

14:42.210 --> 14:50.177
I mean, nobody will understand also.

14:53.077 --> 14:59.910
So in modern times when Sahaja Yoga is not just raising the Kundalini

15:00.043 --> 15:03.243
but giving the complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga

15:03.943 --> 15:08.077
and also empowering the person with

15:08.377 --> 15:13.210
the power to give others realization, it was tremendous task.

15:14.876 --> 15:17.410
And that's why we had to find out these methods

15:17.910 --> 15:21.910
by which we could give realization to people.

15:24.343 --> 15:30.876
In those days Kundalinis were awakened but the Sahasrara was not broken.

15:31.210 --> 15:33.910
So Kundalini must be somewhere hanging in the Agnya,

15:33.910 --> 15:37.876
maybe at heart, maybe somewhere.

15:38.110 --> 15:44.910
And such people became the seekers and that's how we find,

15:44.910 --> 15:51.177
today, people are here as Sahaja Yogis whose Sahasrara's are open

15:51.177 --> 15:55.210
and they know all the yukti of Sahaja Yoga.

15:56.876 --> 16:04.043
But there are subtler and subtler yuktis of Sahaja Yoga which you have to master.

16:04.976 --> 16:12.976
The first is that His character was 'madhuriya', meaning the sweetness.

16:14.277 --> 16:20.910
Sweetness. We always say, "He's sweet like honey".

16:23.277 --> 16:29.910
So when He talked to anyone or He communicated with anyone,

16:31.110 --> 16:39.910
it was through sweetness; and this communication,

16:41.010 --> 16:46.910
if you have not developed, then you are nowhere near Yoga.

16:48.243 --> 16:54.243
To talk to someone sweetly, automatically.

16:57.210 --> 17:00.876
Everything is madhuriya for Him, His talking,

17:00.910 --> 17:08.910
His actions, His face. Everything is madhuriya.

17:10.343 --> 17:15.910
So when we talk of communications first of all the greatest thing is

17:15.910 --> 17:19.110
the communication between human beings

17:20.010 --> 17:25.010
and when we have to think of the communication with the human beings

17:25.277 --> 17:29.910
many people think that by aggression you will communicate better,

17:31.110 --> 17:33.110
which is not true.

17:35.143 --> 17:39.177
I mean if somebody wants to get something out of someone, say;

17:40.943 --> 17:46.910
so you go there and just talk, "I have to have! How can you do it?

17:46.910 --> 17:51.077
This, that!" As it is - it's no good.

17:53.110 --> 17:58.843
But if you are sweet and start talking sweetly

17:59.177 --> 18:04.910
then 99% will definitely dissolve.

18:06.177 --> 18:12.910
So to dissolve people with sweetness - how to do it -

18:13.110 --> 18:17.110
that trick one has to learn:

18:21.343 --> 18:25.343
how, with sweetness, you can dissolve people.

18:26.110 --> 18:29.177
This is one of His special qualities,

18:30.010 --> 18:36.243
that you talk to someone in such a manner, genuinely,

18:36.843 --> 18:40.910
in a very sweet manner, and

18:43.110 --> 18:50.143
the problem between you and that person will be dissolved, absolutely.

18:51.343 --> 18:53.910
Now there are many tricks

18:54.377 --> 19:00.910
and how to talk to someone is one of the biggest things one has to learn.

19:02.876 --> 19:05.110
First of all you must always show

19:05.143 --> 19:08.910
that you are less intelligent than another person.

19:14.143 --> 19:17.143
Like if I'm talking to a scientist I will say,

19:17.910 --> 19:20.910
"I'm sorry I don't know any science you know.

19:22.077 --> 19:28.910
I'm no good for a scientist." So they feel "ahhhh, very good."

19:36.243 --> 19:41.243
If you have to talk to some musician, you must say "I don't know any music.

19:42.177 --> 19:47.910
No, I just have learned a little bit, but not much."

19:49.243 --> 19:51.243
Musician feels very happy.

19:51.277 --> 19:55.910
You may call it a pampering of the ego. You may call it [that].

19:56.910 --> 20:02.910
But there's no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared to you".

20:05.910 --> 20:11.910
So the first trick is complete humility when you talk to another person.

20:13.910 --> 20:18.110
It's the sign of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.

20:18.177 --> 20:23.910
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits they bend down.

20:27.177 --> 20:34.310
So, first of all, if you say "I am no one. I don't understand anything

20:36.110 --> 20:39.910
but I would like to hear" this is first.

20:40.910 --> 20:44.243
The first quality of communication is to be

20:44.243 --> 20:46.243
extremely humble about yourself.

20:46.910 --> 20:50.910
The other person should not know who you are.

20:53.243 --> 20:56.910
And there's a lot of fun in it.

20:57.910 --> 21:03.943
Say for example now - I can say about Myself

21:05.143 --> 21:08.243
that My husband was very highly placed in India.

21:08.910 --> 21:13.910
But I met a friend in Delhi - she was studying with Me in school

21:14.110 --> 21:18.910
and in college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"

21:19.077 --> 21:20.910
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was

21:20.910 --> 21:24.843
just a useless, small, little place

21:24.876 --> 21:27.910
meant for very ordinary officers because they had

21:27.910 --> 21:32.077
not allotted us any house or anything so, temporarily, we were there.

21:32.310 --> 21:34.077
She said "what? What is your husband doing?"

21:34.110 --> 21:38.077
I said "He's some government servant." I didn't tell her [his position]!

21:38.310 --> 21:45.976
He came down, so he just looked at Me and he smiled.

21:46.077 --> 21:48.910
She said "do you know him?" I said "He's My husband".

21:49.110 --> 21:53.043
She was shocked, "He's your husband? Oh my God!

21:53.143 --> 21:56.876
Why didn't you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing changed

21:57.043 --> 21:59.143
and she felt so ashamed of herself.

21:59.310 --> 22:01.910
She had started looking down upon Me,

22:01.910 --> 22:04.910
"Ah, Married to some clerk or someone."

22:10.077 --> 22:17.910
So the best thing is to play down. Play down everything.

22:19.077 --> 22:21.043
Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis they say,

22:21.077 --> 22:25.910
"oh Mother has giving me such powers. I can do this, I can do that."

22:26.243 --> 22:28.910
This boastfullness is of no use.

22:29.377 --> 22:33.410
"I haven't got any powers you see. I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all.

22:33.410 --> 22:36.910
But if you want I can try."

22:42.177 --> 22:51.277
So play down as much as you can. Practice this at home,

22:52.910 --> 22:55.910
first practice and then do it.

22:57.010 --> 23:02.843
So that is one of the greatest qualities of communication with others.

23:05.943 --> 23:08.943
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita, if you read it,

23:09.010 --> 23:10.177
there's one is very important thing.

23:10.177 --> 23:13.010
He says "krodho'bhijaayate sammohah"  (Gita 2:61)].

23:13.177 --> 23:18.010
You see among all the worst things that we have -

23:18.043 --> 23:22.910
according to Him we have six enemies.

23:25.343 --> 23:29.043
But in Gita He started with 'Krodha'.

23:29.310 --> 23:32.910
He said - it starts with Krodha, means anger.

23:35.410 --> 23:41.277
If you have anger within you then you are not a master at all.

23:42.277 --> 23:47.910
There's no need for a master to get angry because he can play about.

23:48.910 --> 23:51.077
He can make you dance like this.

23:51.943 --> 23:54.910
What is the need to lose your temper?

23:56.243 --> 24:00.243
But that mastery if you don't have, of handling people,

24:01.077 --> 24:05.277
then after five/six minutes of talk your voice starts raising

24:05.910 --> 24:10.243
and something starts barking,

24:12.910 --> 24:16.077
because that temper is still inside you, burning.

24:16.310 --> 24:22.843
But for a master there should be no temper - no need.

24:25.310 --> 24:30.343
He has started with Krodha, that: with the Krodha all problems start.

24:31.043 --> 24:33.910
from one to another to another to another.

24:34.043 --> 24:38.243
So we should watch out if we are angry people.

24:42.077 --> 24:49.210
Anger comes from Vishuddhi. Starts from liver - Vishnu -

24:49.876 --> 24:52.010
but is expressed through Vishuddhi.

24:52.410 --> 24:55.910
The face becomes red, eyes become red.

24:56.243 --> 25:01.143
From the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible things

25:01.910 --> 25:06.343
and the whole expression becomes so different when you are angry.

25:07.077 --> 25:12.910
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it within us? Where is it this anger?

25:13.343 --> 25:16.043
Liver? alright, I'll put it right."

25:16.243 --> 25:21.310
So to master it you have to face yourself clearly.

25:22.043 --> 25:23.910
Many people I have seen people say

25:23.910 --> 25:26.177
"Mother you know this lady is such a hot tempered women,

25:26.177 --> 25:29.277
she is so dominating. She does this, she does that."

25:29.910 --> 25:32.110
But if you tell her she says, "No no, I don't do that way.

25:32.110 --> 25:34.177
No, no I'm very good."

25:35.177 --> 25:40.910
"But how other's saying that?", "I don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

25:41.976 --> 25:44.910
If somebody is saying that then you watch yourself -

25:45.343 --> 25:51.910
do you get into tempers or not? Are you loosing your temper?

25:51.910 --> 25:54.910
It's very easy to make it out then face it.

25:55.910 --> 25:58.910
So the trick of the trade is to face yourself

25:58.910 --> 26:03.077
and see for yourself how much you are lacking.

26:05.110 --> 26:09.110
So first is humility, which should be genuine,

26:09.343 --> 26:17.243
and secondly is equanimity - no temper.

26:17.976 --> 26:19.910
There is no need to take to temper.

26:19.910 --> 26:23.077
At the most you can say "What are you doing?

26:23.910 --> 26:25.410
Why are you doing that way?"

26:25.876 --> 26:28.910
Now if you do something, you know, maybe something I might say which

26:28.910 --> 26:30.910
I would not like, so I don't want to say."

26:30.910 --> 26:37.910
Like that - at the most! Up to that point is alright;

26:37.910 --> 26:42.910
that you should say that, "I dislike it", but not to go further with it.

26:46.377 --> 26:50.177
If you just stop at a point,

26:52.910 --> 26:56.910
then this habit of getting into temper will go away.

26:57.010 --> 27:00.177
This arrogance will go away, which has to go.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.910
This arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

27:04.110 --> 27:07.910
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel very much relieved.

27:08.177 --> 27:12.177
Because this anger, once it comes in, reacts,

27:12.410 --> 27:17.310
and catches your left Vishuddi, and you become guilty,

27:17.910 --> 27:21.910
you feel very bad - "Why I said so, I should not have said this."

27:23.343 --> 27:29.010
So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi, means - it's a headache.

27:29.910 --> 27:33.377
It goes on accumulating like a store house there - all your anger,

27:33.843 --> 27:38.043
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi catches,

27:39.043 --> 27:42.010
and you know the problems of left Vishuddhi.

27:43.910 --> 27:49.843
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel guilty

27:50.410 --> 27:54.910
but go before the mirror and slap yourself nicely, twice.

27:56.343 --> 27:58.910
Now you get angry with yourself, "let me get angry!"

27:58.910 --> 28:01.910
Then stand before the mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" like that

28:06.143 --> 28:10.077
In the same manner as you get angry try to act,

28:11.310 --> 28:13.310
you'll never feel guilty.

28:13.843 --> 28:16.910
Or maybe more angry - would be better.

28:17.177 --> 28:19.843
So you empty out your left Vishuddhi.

28:21.143 --> 28:24.110
Next time you won't do it.

28:25.343 --> 28:29.243
But feeling guilty means you will repeat and repeat the same thing.

28:30.010 --> 28:36.243
So this temper is expressed by men and women differently.

28:37.876 --> 28:38.910
And I'm very much worried about

28:38.910 --> 28:43.910
the women sometimes because they take to water power - then I'm lost.

28:45.043 --> 28:49.210
But those who have ego too much, cry much more. That's the sign.

28:49.943 --> 28:54.910
I've seen. If you say anything to them immediately they start crying,

28:56.343 --> 29:01.976
because already the left Vishuddhi is there, full, like a full balloon

29:02.110 --> 29:05.876
and when you touch them it becomes water.

29:07.943 --> 29:13.177
But men, their temper is a different style, as you know very well,

29:13.910 --> 29:17.143
that: when they get angry they might fight with each other,

29:17.310 --> 29:22.910
box everyone and then settle down nicely and have something to drink.

29:26.177 --> 29:28.343
"Let us have it out!" you see, they'll say. Take out.

29:28.910 --> 29:31.377
But women don't, they keep it there

29:31.910 --> 29:36.243
and once they keep it then it becomes tears, it starts coming down.

29:36.410 --> 29:41.377
So, if these are just tears out of joy, happiness, that's different,

29:42.077 --> 29:45.976
or out of feelings for others - but it is not that,

29:46.110 --> 29:49.910
but it's tears just to impress another person that

29:49.910 --> 29:52.910
you are very sad or something.

30:03.177 --> 30:08.943
So the second trick is how to master your own temper

30:09.277 --> 30:12.910
and the third one is how to master

30:12.910 --> 30:19.910
the temper of others - that's even better.

30:22.343 --> 30:24.843
I don't know if I have told you the trick of

30:24.910 --> 30:27.910
Gagangan Maharaj, when I went to him.

30:29.043 --> 30:31.843
He is a very hot tempered avadhuta, sitting on

30:31.843 --> 30:33.910
a tiger, and he's lost his legs, because he was feeling hot

30:34.077 --> 30:35.910
so he was sitting in the water

30:35.910 --> 30:41.277
all the time, so his feet are useless and he goes on a tiger, they say.

30:41.343 --> 30:43.843
I never saw the tiger, of course.

30:43.876 --> 30:47.143
But he knows about Me and all that and he told everyone about Me

30:47.177 --> 30:49.143
so I went to see him.

30:49.343 --> 30:54.910
And he's supposed to control the rain. It was quite a steep climb

30:54.910 --> 30:57.943
for about one and a half hours.

30:58.310 --> 31:01.876
And as soon as I stepped in, it started raining, raining,

31:01.876 --> 31:05.143
raining heavily throughout and he couldn't stop it,

31:06.077 --> 31:08.043
so he felt very challenged!

31:08.243 --> 31:12.177
When I went up he was sitting on his own stone outside the cave,

31:12.310 --> 31:13.910
and he was doing like this [twisting his head], with anger.

31:13.910 --> 31:18.943
He didn't know what to do. I looked at him then I walked

31:19.010 --> 31:23.343
into his cave and sat down nicely, then he came, they brought him.

31:25.876 --> 31:27.910
He touched my feet, everything he did and then he said,

31:27.910 --> 31:31.910
"You tell me now - why did you not allow me to stop the water?

31:31.910 --> 31:37.177
You got completely drenched. I'm very angry with this rain I know.

31:38.243 --> 31:41.976
But why did you do that? Is it to control my ego?"

31:42.177 --> 31:46.876
I said "No, not at all I never knew you had ego or anything,"

31:49.943 --> 31:55.077
"Then why?" So - because I'm a master as you know -

31:55.910 --> 32:00.243
I said "You see you are a sanyasi and you brought a sari for Me,

32:00.943 --> 32:02.876
that too of an orange colour, and I would

32:02.943 --> 32:05.243
not take the orange colour sari from you.

32:05.910 --> 32:08.210
Any sari I wouldn't take, because you're a sanyasi.

32:08.910 --> 32:11.910
But I had to get drenched to get the sari, isn't it?"

32:12.110 --> 32:19.910
Immediately - he melted away. But I had to be the master.

32:23.377 --> 32:31.377
First of all how to melt him and secondly the master of his mind.

32:32.910 --> 32:39.110
This is the subtler part of it. You can be a master of a person.

32:40.110 --> 32:43.177
Like that you can know what he has done for you,

32:44.043 --> 32:48.310
what he has prepared for you, what is coming for you.

32:48.910 --> 32:51.910
I wouldn't say that you'd know all the whole future.

32:51.910 --> 32:56.177
But if you try just to know about a person -

32:57.010 --> 33:00.910
you can know everything about that person, very simple.

33:01.177 --> 33:04.910
So first try to understand a person.

33:07.177 --> 33:10.177
My father had lots of tricks with him, I know,

33:10.976 --> 33:14.010
and a very humorous person.

33:15.177 --> 33:17.910
And one day My brother told me, Babamama,

33:17.910 --> 33:20.910
that he has a friend who sings very well.

33:21.943 --> 33:24.110
So I asked my father "How does he sing?"

33:24.210 --> 33:28.277
"Oh, he is very courageous," he said. I said "Why?"

33:28.910 --> 33:32.043
"He sings whether he knows or not - that's the trouble!"

33:32.910 --> 33:37.843
What an exact description he gave Me of this gentleman!

33:38.043 --> 33:39.343
"He's very courageous you see.

33:39.876 --> 33:42.343
He doesn't know but he sings - quite alright,

33:42.976 --> 33:46.410
so he's very courageous." I mean, he didn't say anything against him -

33:46.910 --> 33:48.177
he said "He's courageous" -

33:48.277 --> 33:50.910
but he gave Me the complete picture of the gentleman that:

33:50.910 --> 33:54.077
"You have to be careful you see, he might start singing in a funny way,

33:54.110 --> 33:57.910
you shouldn't laugh." And, all that came in that 'courageous' word.

33:58.243 --> 34:02.910
In the same way, if you study someone, you see,

34:05.910 --> 34:10.910
then you will just describe that person in an interesting way,

34:11.876 --> 34:13.910
and you will not feel that this person has these bad habits

34:13.910 --> 34:17.910
or those bad habits or this is wrong with him, that is wrong,

34:18.043 --> 34:21.910
but you'll describe - it's part of that person.

34:25.910 --> 34:30.910
It's a way of knowing a person in totality with all his defects,

34:30.910 --> 34:32.910
with all his qualities, with everything

34:32.910 --> 34:36.910
and accepting that person as he is.

34:38.843 --> 34:41.110
If that mastery you can have.

34:41.876 --> 34:45.943
Now how will you have? If your attention is not on his

34:46.043 --> 34:49.976
qualities you'll only know his bad things.

34:51.976 --> 34:57.010
And if you know his qualities then bad things will be there, a little bit,

34:57.010 --> 35:02.010
but they'll just be adding a little massala to his character.

35:02.910 --> 35:07.110
You'll feel "ahhhh, that's it, you see, he is a little bit like that."

35:07.943 --> 35:14.110
Little additional swara (musical note) is added to his character.

35:15.043 --> 35:20.110
And you wouldn't mind it so much, such a person. You'll really enjoy.

35:21.110 --> 35:24.210
Like my son-in-law is very fond of dogs

35:24.876 --> 35:27.077
and his wife says, "no dog in the house," it's a flat.

35:27.110 --> 35:30.043
So there is a fight between them for the dog.

35:30.910 --> 35:32.343
So Prabhat said "You never meet me,"

35:32.876 --> 35:38.910
I said "This is not proper but next time I have decided to be a dog,"

35:39.377 --> 35:45.377
Immediately he took the point. You see, so the way you talk to a person

35:46.110 --> 35:51.910
you can suggest to him what is so special about that person

35:52.110 --> 35:54.377
or the defects of that person.

35:55.410 --> 35:58.444
But you need not say directly something to him.

36:01.110 --> 36:06.243
If you say indirectly, in such a humorous manner

36:07.243 --> 36:09.243
that the person will understand.

36:10.010 --> 36:18.010
So in communication with others you have to be a very humorous person.

36:19.943 --> 36:25.077
But mostly I've seen people have humour if somebody cannot walk straight.

36:25.143 --> 36:27.410
If a physical problem is there they'll laugh.

36:28.243 --> 36:32.444
If he has not properly made his hair then they will laugh.

36:32.976 --> 36:38.110
On some sort of a very superficial thing they laugh. This is not humorous.

36:38.377 --> 36:42.444
This is some sort of a criticism in laughter.

36:43.310 --> 36:50.943
Or some people have a humour like this that they say sarcastic things.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.143
that's no good.

36:53.243 --> 36:57.910
You say one word to somebody, sarcastic; you think you are very brilliant,

36:58.110 --> 37:00.177
but you are lost forever for that person.

37:00.410 --> 37:03.910
That person will remember "He said such a such things to me."

37:04.210 --> 37:09.243
So sarcasm is against you completely; against Sahaja Yoga.

37:09.477 --> 37:13.910
If you have to say something, say it in such a manner

37:13.910 --> 37:16.177
that it doesn't hurt the person,

37:17.843 --> 37:24.910
and the person enjoys that subtle humour

37:25.077 --> 37:28.910
and understands also that "This is the problem with me".

37:31.444 --> 37:41.910
Now in a humorous way, if I have to tell something to you -

37:42.410 --> 37:45.243
I need not tell you directly, "You are like this, you are like that,"

37:45.343 --> 37:51.943
but I'll say, "There was one crow which came to my house..."

37:52.477 --> 37:56.077
and, like that, I can transfer all your qualities to that crow

37:56.110 --> 38:00.510
and describe to you and say that, "This crow did like this and did that."

38:01.976 --> 38:05.077
Immediately you'll start thinking, "Is it about me Mother was saying

38:05.210 --> 38:12.910
or about the crow?" So transfer it to somebody else.

38:13.410 --> 38:16.043
Transfer it to somebody else, that's the best way.

38:16.110 --> 38:19.077
For example, if you want to say that:

38:19.110 --> 38:21.976
all the names of the people who are coming to the puja

38:22.210 --> 38:25.077
should be there at the right time.

38:25.343 --> 38:27.143
So now, this time, Americans [are hosting].

38:27.243 --> 38:30.444
Alright, "Americans have sent the word..." - they have not -

38:30.910 --> 38:33.177
"...have sent the word that all the names should be there."

38:33.377 --> 38:36.910
No harm telling such lies, no harm.

38:38.243 --> 38:41.843
So that people will not put it on you, they'll not be angry with you.

38:41.876 --> 38:45.077
At the most they'll be angry with the Americans - doesn't matter,

38:46.143 --> 38:50.010
for the time being. So transfer it.

38:50.444 --> 38:57.110
And this transference is 'astantar' as they call it.

38:57.277 --> 39:04.043
To transfer from one hand to another hand, Shri Krishna was an expert.

39:07.010 --> 39:08.910
There is a story about Him.

39:09.010 --> 39:13.910
He is called as Ranchordas, means He ran away from the battlefield.

39:14.210 --> 39:18.043
He doesn't mind "I ran away, so what?"

39:18.876 --> 39:23.243
The reason was like this: there was a very bad rakshasa

39:23.310 --> 39:28.143
who had all kinds of boons from Brahmadeva

39:28.410 --> 39:31.910
and Shri Krishna didn't know how to overcome that,

39:31.910 --> 39:34.910
nobody knew, and He was killing so many people.

39:36.110 --> 39:40.377
So He thought of a trick, transfer it to somebody else.

39:41.177 --> 39:46.110
He knew of another great yogi you see, special type,

39:46.343 --> 39:52.843
who has meditated and taken a boon from the same Brahmadeva

39:53.043 --> 39:58.910
that: "If I'm sleeping and anybody disturbs my sleep

39:58.910 --> 40:00.943
and if I open my eyes

40:01.310 --> 40:06.943
and look at that person, that person should become ashes - bhasma."

40:08.910 --> 40:13.343
So Shri Krishna thought of Him, "Better transfer the job from me to Him."

40:14.177 --> 40:18.143
So He started running away from the field.

40:18.277 --> 40:21.143
So this Rakshasa also followed Him.

40:21.477 --> 40:29.177
Then Shri Krishna stealthily went into the cave of this avadhuta,

40:29.444 --> 40:35.910
and put His own shawl on top of Him, covered Him,

40:36.910 --> 40:40.910
and hid himself in the cave.

40:41.876 --> 40:45.243
Now this Rakshasa came here, he thought this was Shri Krishna who was sleeping,

40:45.444 --> 40:48.010
"Ahhh now you are tired, you are sleeping.

40:48.110 --> 40:51.143
Now I'm going to see how you can save yourself."

40:51.310 --> 40:53.876
And he started waking [him] up.

40:54.077 --> 40:59.243
This avadhuta got up and looked at him and he became bhasma (ashes).

41:00.277 --> 41:07.943
So transfer your jobs to a more capable (Shri Mataji laughs) person

41:10.210 --> 41:15.444
who can do this better, than taking upon yourself

41:16.010 --> 41:19.444
straight-forward, going, "Alright,come long, I'll fight with you."

41:20.043 --> 41:24.243
you cannot win. It's a guerrilla warfare as you call it.

41:25.043 --> 41:30.477
Transfer it, and you can transfer it to somebody,

41:31.210 --> 41:34.943
you can make friends with that person, pamper his ego; do what you like.

41:35.110 --> 41:40.043
But the main point is that you should get rid of the ills,

41:40.277 --> 41:45.110
the bad, the rakshasas. So you can transfer it to anyone.

41:47.477 --> 41:50.477
And so many tricks He played.

41:56.377 --> 42:04.277
In the Mahabharata, Bhishma had a blessing

42:04.943 --> 42:11.910
that, unless and until he wants to die, nobody can kill him.

42:15.043 --> 42:25.110
So Shri Krishna decided that He should use some tricks.

42:26.510 --> 42:31.910
So He told Arjuna that you put him...

42:32.444 --> 42:34.243
He told Arjuna not himself;

42:34.377 --> 42:40.910
He was just doing the chariot drivers job - Sarathi.

42:41.343 --> 42:49.343
So Krishna told him that you just make him sleep on the arrows,

42:50.110 --> 42:55.843
let His body be on the arrows and he has to decide that he will die.

42:57.410 --> 43:08.243
But Dronacharya was a great guru, also of Arjuna, who was siding with Kauravas.

43:09.043 --> 43:14.210
Now how can you kill this Dhronacharya, big problem.

43:15.143 --> 43:23.243
Because you see, he knew all the tricks of archery.

43:23.843 --> 43:27.110
How are you going to save them?

43:29.444 --> 43:34.010
Because archery is such a thing that he was the master of archery,

43:34.210 --> 43:37.343
while Arjuna was his disciple.

43:38.444 --> 44:04.277
So how to stop him, answering back the arrows of Arjuna?

44:04.876 --> 44:08.210
How to do that, that he doesn't answer back?

44:08.444 --> 44:17.477
Because he was a master. So Krishna organized it, in a very special way.

44:18.077 --> 44:22.377
He got a Shikhandi, a eunuch.

44:22.910 --> 44:26.910
What is the advantage of having a eunuch? Of course it's a big story

44:26.910 --> 44:33.077
how they became Shikhandi. But He got him in front of Arjuna.

44:34.110 --> 44:37.976
A eunuch in India is regarded as a woman,

44:39.010 --> 44:46.976
so Dhronacharya said, "I cannot kill a woman,"

44:48.976 --> 44:53.110
and that's how He killed Dhronacharya.

44:54.377 --> 45:00.043
So [He played] these tricks, because to get rid of ill is the main thing.

45:00.277 --> 45:02.243
To get rid of the ill -

45:02.410 --> 45:06.077
if you are not capable - you better tell somebody else to get rid.

45:06.077 --> 45:11.043
Because that is very important - to get rid of the evil -

45:12.110 --> 45:15.943
and if you can transfer this to somebody else who is more capable,

45:16.010 --> 45:21.943
in your own humility, you'll do much better than to directly attack that person.

45:22.876 --> 45:24.976
That's Tomfoolery. No use.

45:26.343 --> 45:29.444
So this was the trick of Shri Krishna throughout.

45:30.043 --> 45:36.177
If you have seen Mahabharata. Shri Krishna told Arjuna that,

45:36.444 --> 45:41.876
"Either you can the have all of My army or you can have Me."

45:42.377 --> 45:46.876
Same He told to the Kauravas. The Kauravas said, "We'll have your army."

45:47.277 --> 45:51.510
But Arjuna said, "You will be mine, Krishna You'll be on our side."

45:52.010 --> 45:57.110
But He said, "No, I'll be just on the chariot. I'll not hold any weapon."

45:57.210 --> 46:04.110
But He is a master of tricks. He does not need any weapons with Him.

46:04.110 --> 46:06.343
Without weapons also He can do everything.

46:07.243 --> 46:12.910
So Arjuna said, "alright, You be my chariot driver," and He was there.

46:14.243 --> 46:21.910
Because Shri Krishna knew about each and every thing, mostly He used to smile.

46:23.843 --> 46:26.110
Now, if somebody's telling Me something,

46:26.943 --> 46:30.843
sometimes you will find I also smile, but I try to control

46:31.110 --> 46:33.077
because I don't want them to see.

46:33.277 --> 46:38.010
But I know what they are doing, what they're up to, what is their trick.

46:38.310 --> 46:41.910
Because you are such a trick master you know all the tricks

46:42.477 --> 46:44.976
and you know what they are playing with you.

46:45.177 --> 46:50.444
So you just smile about it, just to smile in a very sweet way,

46:50.843 --> 46:55.243
"ah, that's it. Ah, of course, what you say is true, no doubt."

46:56.910 --> 47:01.077
But, by this kind of thing, you'll be surprised, your communications

47:02.010 --> 47:05.143
will improve very much with others.

47:06.110 --> 47:10.343
Now some people I've seen in Sahaja Yoga - very common, very common,

47:10.943 --> 47:17.077
"Mother", they came and told me, "our leader told me, that you are bhootish."

47:18.143 --> 47:20.010
What is bhootish?"

47:20.210 --> 47:24.043
Another one says, "But he told me that you are a bhoot," - alright.

47:24.243 --> 47:28.876
And somebody says, "Mother no he told me that you have got a bhoot in you.

47:28.910 --> 47:32.210
Now what are these three categories? Tell us."

47:34.143 --> 47:39.177
Why to tell anybody you are bhootish or anything? There's no need.

47:39.910 --> 47:43.910
If you know how to correct it, just say "left Swadisthana" and correct it.

47:44.043 --> 47:47.943
Take it out. Ask him, if he had any guru or anything.

47:48.310 --> 47:52.077
Alright, if the person is good natured and a good person

47:52.910 --> 47:54.843
then it's even more important.

47:55.077 --> 47:58.043
You should say "It's nothing, you see, it's just a badha from outside.

47:58.077 --> 47:59.910
We'll have to take it out."

48:00.410 --> 48:05.143
But a person who has got agnya and all these things,

48:05.177 --> 48:09.444
plus that he has got this left Swadisthana,

48:09.910 --> 48:12.243
then, of course, you should say, "Baba, we cannot help you,"

48:12.910 --> 48:15.110
because you know he is cunning.

48:15.976 --> 48:17.510
What's the use of playing with that?

48:18.210 --> 48:20.343
But in Sahaja Yoga we forget.

48:20.410 --> 48:24.910
Anybody who comes "Alright, come along, come along, come along."

48:26.876 --> 48:32.976
Everybody is not capable of Sahaja Yoga, one has to know that.

48:33.410 --> 48:35.177
Not the whole world.

48:37.010 --> 48:41.110
Sahaja Yoga can only be given to people who are deserving,

48:41.210 --> 48:47.310
who are seekers and who are courageous - viras.

48:48.043 --> 48:50.143
It's not meant for ordinary people.

48:50.976 --> 48:55.910
So we open our door to everyone and all such people walk in

48:56.043 --> 49:00.243
and then we work very hard on them, do all kinds of things,

49:00.943 --> 49:04.110
and we find that they create problems for us.

49:06.210 --> 49:09.943
So first, only deal with people who are simple,

49:10.110 --> 49:13.177
as Shri Krishna dealt with Gopas and Gopis;

49:14.243 --> 49:19.243
and then we can see, in a collective way, if we can face somebody who's complicated.

49:20.010 --> 49:26.310
But no use transforming Hitler or Rajneesh, not possible.

49:27.477 --> 49:31.477
So one should not try to do impossible tasks in Sahaja Yoga,

49:32.210 --> 49:35.243
which Shri Krishna has shown in His own character

49:36.177 --> 49:40.143
by avoiding things which He didn't want to do - no.

49:42.876 --> 49:46.010
And He did it because He was such a master.

49:47.143 --> 49:51.444
Of course, for Him, it was not necessary to face himself

49:51.876 --> 49:54.110
to master himself, because He knew himself,

49:54.277 --> 49:58.310
He is the Ishwara of yoga, He knew everything.

49:59.444 --> 50:01.143
When you know everything

50:01.243 --> 50:04.243
there is no need for you to master, what are you going to master?

50:04.910 --> 50:09.110
On the contrary you sometimes get frightened of yourself, that you know so much.

50:12.510 --> 50:19.910
So, best is that, when we are dealing as human beings in Sahaja Yoga,

50:20.143 --> 50:24.444
we have to know ourselves very well - "Now oh that's my speciality."

50:25.510 --> 50:29.910
In that you have to see: "How I face myself all the time?

50:31.910 --> 50:37.277
Why do I say such a thing? What is lurking in my mind?"

50:38.943 --> 50:43.343
Negativity is something to be seen very clearly within yourself.

50:44.143 --> 50:46.444
As I must have told you so many examples

50:46.976 --> 50:48.943
that the western negativity is like this

50:48.943 --> 50:53.310
that, their minds are all the time labor saving devices.

50:55.143 --> 50:58.210
They don't like to work anyway.

50:58.377 --> 51:06.077
For example, you tell them "You go and telephone to someone."

51:06.444 --> 51:09.910
Immediately they will tell you ten explanations:

51:10.077 --> 51:15.177
he may not be there, his wife will shout, he might have gone to work,

51:15.410 --> 51:19.243
it's ten o'clock, this, that.

51:20.177 --> 51:25.243
But if you telephone he's there, but they won't telephone.

51:26.277 --> 51:30.910
Hundred excuses. Now new excuses have started:

51:31.077 --> 51:35.210
"the computer was not working, fax was not working."

51:35.843 --> 51:38.943
Except for your brain everything works.

51:40.210 --> 51:42.343
But the other way around it is:

51:43.077 --> 51:46.943
your brain is not working and everything is not working.

51:47.243 --> 51:51.110
"The lights were not working." I mean, whatever it is.

51:51.943 --> 51:57.210
But you must learn, "Why can't I find the solution?

51:58.843 --> 52:01.110
I must do something."

52:01.976 --> 52:05.077
Like I have told you, the tip of a root -

52:05.310 --> 52:11.177
how it manages to go round and round and seek the source of water.

52:12.277 --> 52:14.910
In the same way, are we doing something about it?

52:14.976 --> 52:17.110
Alright, if this is not available, do that,

52:17.910 --> 52:19.477
if that is not available do this.

52:20.043 --> 52:23.444
Out of nothing you can do so many things.

52:24.410 --> 52:30.177
But if you want to find out all the time "That cannot be done, that cannot be done".

52:30.510 --> 52:33.310
[That was] not [the case] with Shri Krishna!

52:33.910 --> 52:37.910
After all He was the incarnation of Virata,

52:38.444 --> 52:40.910
the Master of Masters we should say.

52:41.143 --> 52:47.910
Like when Draupadi was in trouble - Draupadi was actually Vishnumaya His sister -

52:48.943 --> 52:50.477
She thought of Shri Krishna.

52:50.943 --> 52:56.277
She was holding onto her sari, when it was pulled out by Duryodhana.

52:56.444 --> 52:58.943
And She was holding it like this (with Her teeth). "Kri",

52:59.110 --> 53:02.243
She wanted to say "Krishna" but She said, "If I say 'shna' it will fall down."

53:02.876 --> 53:04.910
So She was holding on.

53:05.277 --> 53:08.077
As soon as She dropped it, "shna",

53:09.110 --> 53:15.976
sari dropped out (of Her mouth), then it's described, about Shri Krishna,

53:18.910 --> 53:25.077
"Dwarika me shora bhayo, shor bhayo bhare.

53:25.243 --> 53:30.910
Shankha chakra gadaa padma, Garuda laysidhare."

53:32.343 --> 53:37.010
[Meaning:] that sound went into Dwarika. Now where is Dwarika

53:37.110 --> 53:41.277
and where is Hastinapur - at least a distance of two thousands miles [apart].

53:42.110 --> 53:51.243
But the sound went through Chaitanya and made a big sound there;

53:52.843 --> 53:55.943
and "Shankha Chakra Gadaa Padma".

53:56.177 --> 53:59.943
Shankha, Chakra Gadaa, Padma are the weapons (of Vishnu) as you know.

54:00.143 --> 54:05.910
All of them He took and came on His Garuda

54:06.310 --> 54:09.343
to save the chastity of His sister -

54:10.110 --> 54:15.077
immediately, spontaneously, that moment.

54:15.343 --> 54:20.277
He could have said, "Alright let it be, let one sari come out then I'll go later."

54:22.510 --> 54:28.210
I'm sure He must have stolen My saris which you give for My Pujas,

54:28.310 --> 54:30.143
which are too many!

54:30.477 --> 54:36.410
That's what I feel, that, from where did He get all these saris to give to Her?

54:37.043 --> 54:40.110
Must be from My own storage I'm sure,

54:40.210 --> 54:42.343
and that's why you are giving Me so many saris,

54:42.910 --> 54:46.410
so that He can save the chastity of many women.

54:50.143 --> 54:55.876
All this is so related, so connected, so one, so united.

54:55.910 --> 55:01.177
There's such a big drama going on but you can't see it.

55:02.510 --> 55:06.843
But if you believe in yourself

55:07.277 --> 55:14.310
and if you really believe that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

55:15.243 --> 55:20.910
that: what are your qualities, what you are, what's your value is,

55:22.444 --> 55:28.410
then I'm sure you can become masters.

55:29.010 --> 55:32.943
But first of all we have no value of our realization.

55:34.143 --> 55:37.110
We do not know what we are capable of, what we can do.

55:37.910 --> 55:41.110
You still think, "oh, I was such an ordinary person,

55:41.210 --> 55:44.910
Mother has given me realization. I have never been to university."

55:45.077 --> 55:46.943
Nobody has been to university.

55:51.210 --> 55:54.210
I mean, if you see, Rama never went to any university,

55:54.377 --> 55:57.010
Krishna never went into university,

55:57.110 --> 56:01.876
Christ never went to any university, an ordinary man, a son of a carpenter.

56:02.910 --> 56:07.077
But you are realized souls but you don't realize your worth and value.

56:07.477 --> 56:10.110
Once you realize it, you will just smile at everything.

56:10.210 --> 56:13.910
Because you don't know you are sitting on top of the world.

56:15.644 --> 56:18.876
Once you know that - only then your mastery will work.

56:18.910 --> 56:22.976
Otherwise imagine a master sitting under the foot of a disciple,

56:23.310 --> 56:25.077
what will it look like?

56:25.510 --> 56:28.410
But it's not that you dominate

56:28.943 --> 56:33.910
but you are in charge, absolutely in charge.

56:35.610 --> 56:39.143
You know everything, you know how to handle, you know how to manage.

56:39.910 --> 56:41.976
This is the mastery you have to get.

56:42.243 --> 56:46.510
This is possible, absolutely possible, for all of you to do it.

56:46.910 --> 56:49.277
But the first and foremost thing you have to know

56:49.310 --> 56:51.910
is that we have to master ourselves.

56:52.843 --> 56:54.644
But then immediately people say

56:55.010 --> 57:00.043
"Mother it's the most difficult to master yourself."

57:02.143 --> 57:04.143
I can't understand this.

57:05.277 --> 57:09.910
Why not? You try to master everyone, why can't you master yourself?

57:11.277 --> 57:16.210
Yourself is with you, you are with yourself, it's your own,

57:16.644 --> 57:22.444
it's your own property. You can correct the property of others,

57:22.577 --> 57:24.910
why can't you correct your own property?

57:26.343 --> 57:27.910
It should be the easiest thing to do

57:27.943 --> 57:31.010
but you're not sure that this is your own,

57:31.277 --> 57:34.943
you do not know that you are capable, but you are

57:35.243 --> 57:39.444
and now you have Self-knowledge, so why should you not do it?

57:40.876 --> 57:44.577
Why should you not try to watch yourself and see for yourself?

57:44.876 --> 57:50.910
And then you will know that you know all the tricks, the yukti.

57:52.976 --> 57:55.544
I don't have to tell you "do this, do that," nothing!

57:55.910 --> 57:59.077
You yourself will know "ha, come along!"

58:00.410 --> 58:06.843
We know so many things, little things, about ordinary material things:

58:07.310 --> 58:11.277
something's falling? Alright - put some support to it.

58:11.577 --> 58:14.544
This is happening? Put it that way.

58:15.177 --> 58:19.910
But in spiritual life it's the easiest thing

58:19.910 --> 58:23.310
because you are in the ocean of knowledge.

58:26.310 --> 58:29.377
But if you do not know that you are, in the ocean of knowledge,

58:29.876 --> 58:33.143
you will not know the tricks, of dealing with others.

58:33.410 --> 58:38.310
Because the main purpose of our communication is to emancipate

58:38.343 --> 58:41.243
the whole world, to emancipate them.

58:41.377 --> 58:44.210
To bring them out of their ignorance.

58:44.610 --> 58:47.943
So for that we have to develop this mastery

58:50.277 --> 58:53.277
and not to get lost into nonsensical things

58:53.910 --> 58:55.910
but this mastery has to be developed.

58:55.910 --> 59:00.043
For that, meditation early in the morning is required

59:00.910 --> 59:04.910
- to begin with. And then facing yourself

59:05.910 --> 59:08.943
all the time, "Why did I say such a thing?"

59:09.277 --> 59:14.910
"Aah must be this. This is the word I picked up from that person."

59:17.043 --> 59:19.910
So when you start facing yourself, you will be surprised

59:19.976 --> 59:26.477
that you are trying to avoid the reality and just using your mind.

59:26.910 --> 59:31.143
See there, as I say, that this mind cheats you

59:31.377 --> 59:34.910
and tells you, "all right, forget it".

59:37.876 --> 59:40.544
And the last, but not the least,

59:41.210 --> 59:49.943
is that Shri Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama.

59:51.243 --> 59:59.910
He creates drama, He acts in the drama, and He's the spectator also.

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:04.243
In these three forms you should see yourself.

01:00:04.577 --> 01:00:10.610
You create the drama of yourself, "aha this one now, see now,

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:14.077
how I'm acting here!"

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:17.210
Then you become the spectator also.

01:00:17.644 --> 01:00:20.910
Become the spectator of your own dramas,

01:00:21.544 --> 01:00:25.976
then you will realize what you are doing,

01:00:26.876 --> 01:00:29.544
how you are working out everything.

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:35.910
Then the deception that we have, all the time, against ourselves,

01:00:36.876 --> 01:00:38.410
will just run away.

01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:42.910
Because if an artist knows he's the spectator,

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:46.910
if the one who is acting knows he is the spectator,

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:51.910
he can never deceive himself, because He knows this is acting.

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:58.910
So this self-deception is the one [that] one should try to avoid -

01:00:59.377 --> 01:01:01.310
"let me face it."

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:05.610
But also there is another way out, people find out.

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:07.610
I mean, there are ways and ways.

01:01:08.043 --> 01:01:11.876
Like you tell somebody, "why didn't you write a letter?"

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:14.243
"I know!" 'I know' means what?

01:01:15.077 --> 01:01:18.177
"But don't you think you should have written a letter to that person,

01:01:18.444 --> 01:01:21.910
who has done so much for you?" "I know."

01:01:24.377 --> 01:01:27.243
"But don't you think it's very bad and cruel on your part

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:30.077
not to have written the letter?" "I know."

01:01:30.343 --> 01:01:36.277
'I know' means what? "I know I'm bad. I know I have been stupid.

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:40.077
I know I should not have done it. But I know also that."

01:01:40.243 --> 01:01:42.243
So what next?

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:46.177
Because they think that if they have confessed that "I know," [it's] finished!

01:01:46.577 --> 01:01:49.843
So this is a new escape which was not [there] at the time of Shri Krishna,

01:01:49.976 --> 01:01:54.577
it's a new modern one, where people say "I know, alright so what?"

01:01:54.876 --> 01:02:00.510
"Ohhh alright I'm a sinner so what?" This is the second side of it.

01:02:00.943 --> 01:02:03.544
First of all "I know that I'm a sinner"

01:02:03.843 --> 01:02:09.910
and second is a higher state is that: "so what, what's wrong?"

01:02:10.544 --> 01:02:16.143
So this is how the derailment starts and one goes from one to another.

01:02:16.544 --> 01:02:21.210
If I know something then why shouldn't I correct myself?

01:02:24.177 --> 01:02:30.210
That's what it should be. "I know I'm like that I know it."

01:02:31.444 --> 01:02:35.910
If you know then you should also know the trick - how to get rid of it.

01:02:36.077 --> 01:02:41.243
Because you are detached from that personality about which you know,

01:02:41.644 --> 01:02:43.210
you can correct yourself.

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:49.177
This is what yoga is, where all your attention is one with the Divine

01:02:49.644 --> 01:02:53.410
and you are so detached that you can see it.

01:02:53.910 --> 01:03:02.010
The attachment to all the things are finished

01:03:02.343 --> 01:03:07.010
and now the force that is coming to you is acting through you

01:03:07.077 --> 01:03:10.477
and acting on these attachments also.

01:03:11.143 --> 01:03:19.043
The situation changes, absolutely, in Sahaja Yoga in a very different way,

01:03:19.277 --> 01:03:22.410
and if there is one bad Sahaja Yogi who comes in,

01:03:22.843 --> 01:03:25.410
either he's thrown out or he has to be alright.

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:27.910
It's the other way around.

01:03:28.077 --> 01:03:31.277
Anyone who is a bad Sahaja Yogi, if he comes in Sahaja Yoga,

01:03:31.444 --> 01:03:34.910
then he has to be corrected, otherwise thrown out.

01:03:35.876 --> 01:03:41.077
It is a, I think, a more evolved state now

01:03:41.143 --> 01:03:45.976
than it was at the time of Shri Krishna, because He talked only to one, Arjuna.

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:49.043
Now I'm talking to thousands - this knowledge.

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:55.143
That time He just talked about it at the time of war.

01:03:55.177 --> 01:03:57.510
I'm talking at the time of peace.

01:03:58.444 --> 01:04:03.843
And it's much more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give him realization.

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:07.377
But you have got the realization, you've got the knowledge,

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:11.010
you know everything. You have all the subtle ideas.

01:04:11.243 --> 01:04:16.510
So this is what it is today, as it is, the situation is that

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:19.910
you have become part and parcel of Virata already.

01:04:20.143 --> 01:04:21.910
You have not seen the Virata (as Arjuna did),

01:04:21.943 --> 01:04:24.110
but you are part and parcel of it.

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:27.277
You are not watching it, you are inside it.

01:04:27.876 --> 01:04:34.510
So that anymore of not watching yourself,

01:04:35.277 --> 01:04:39.577
will be only thing that you'll be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:45.510
Or else you better watch yourself and correct yourself

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:49.010
and be one with the body of the Virata.

01:04:50.143 --> 01:04:53.110
This is the sign of a Yogeshwara,

01:04:53.377 --> 01:04:58.410
and that's how you have to be, in a mood which is very smiling,

01:04:59.043 --> 01:05:02.577
knowing everything and not sarcastic,

01:05:03.177 --> 01:05:09.610
but [with a] very paternal smile, very loving, affectionate smile,

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:13.077
that you should have for all the other people

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.544
and immediately they'll recognize.

01:05:15.843 --> 01:05:18.910
I have seen small children are like that.

01:05:19.444 --> 01:05:22.077
They are extremely patronising sometimes, you know.

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:24.077
They see their parents and this and that.

01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:30.110
So they come and tell you that, "don't worry everything will be all right,

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:33.177
after all God is there to look after you."

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:40.843
And they can be extremely loving and kind and the way they talk

01:05:40.943 --> 01:05:42.910
they will neutralize the whole thing.

01:05:43.077 --> 01:05:45.910
So we have to learn a lot from our children,

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:48.910
from all the little babies that we have

01:05:49.043 --> 01:05:55.910
and that we ourselves should have that Ganesha principal within us,

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:58.544
with innocence we should work it out.

01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:02.577
Innocence is the most intelligent thing and most effective thing.

01:06:03.177 --> 01:06:07.010
So I would request you, all of you, to face yourself

01:06:07.843 --> 01:06:10.510
and don't hate yourself but correct yourself,

01:06:10.843 --> 01:06:14.910
respect yourself and try to evolve your own glory.

01:06:15.043 --> 01:06:18.077
May God bless you.
