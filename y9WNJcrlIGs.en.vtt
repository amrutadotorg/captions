00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.317
All right. Put your hands towards Me.

00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:13.146
First of all, I must say

00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:20.469
I am very happy to see so many Sahaja
Yogis in Hong Kong.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.995
Hong Kong is a very materialistic place,
as you know,

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:31.775
and people are too busy,

00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:36.861
but the problems come out of that busyness.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:40.976
All this busy life creates lots
of problems.

00:01:41.177 --> 00:01:49.199
So I am sure there will be more coming
from the last program, definitely,

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.121
lots of them, and your hands will be full.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.275
So I just wanted to tell you

00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:09.657
what should we really do to achieve
the maximum results.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.069
First of all, we have to establish

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.769
that we are Sahaja Yogis, we are very
sober people

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:32.324
and we have among ourselves tremendous
respect and love.

00:02:32.747 --> 00:02:35.911
So one should never support

00:02:36.112 --> 00:02:41.988
an outsider who is not yet a Sahaja Yogi
or who will be a Sahaja Yogi

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.075
but support each other, all the time.

00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:50.822
Do not argue among yourselves.

00:02:51.023 --> 00:02:56.120
Maybe one person may be wrong, I am
not saying.

00:02:56.321 --> 00:03:03.110
But [it] is important that we should
support each other,

00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:07.306
and above all, we must support the leader.

00:03:07.507 --> 00:03:11.811
Whatever the leader says, we must listen
to him.

00:03:12.012 --> 00:03:19.959
It’s very important, in Sahaja Yoga we are
a collective organisation,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.245
that too a living organisation.

00:03:24.446 --> 00:03:29.962
If somebody is not collective, he is thrown
out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:30.163 --> 00:03:32.802
We are not very happy with such people.

00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:37.012
So you must try to put

00:03:46.664 --> 00:03:54.903
all effort to see that you are all
collectively one

00:03:55.104 --> 00:03:58.510
and say the same thing.

00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:04.692
This is very important to know.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:11.327
Also there are people who may not be
so good among you

00:04:11.528 --> 00:04:16.178
who can judge the vibrations, possibly.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:20.821
If so, you should ask your leader.

00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:24.476
But among yourselves you should never
argue, because we know

00:04:24.677 --> 00:04:28.990
that Sahaja Yoga gives you absolute truth.

00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:31.805
So others should not doubt

00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:38.535
by your behaviour that these people don’t
know anything. All right?

00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:45.578
Then second thing of Sahaja Yoga is that
it is the power of love,

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.220
it’s of compassion, of divine love.

00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:53.029
Must understand what is divine love is.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.870
That is the love that is the, like the sap,
as I always say,

00:04:58.071 --> 00:05:07.164
that runs in the tree. It gives nourishment
to the roots,

00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:18.211
then to all parts of the tree, and then
it evaporates or it goes down.

00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:26.359
Supposing it gets stuck into one flower,
what will happen

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.535
that the tree will die, and ultimately
the flower will also die.

00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:37.247
So our love is not limited love.

00:05:37.448 --> 00:05:41.577
Like, we love our children, all right,
[we] love other children also.

00:05:41.778 --> 00:05:51.005
Everybody is absolutely in full pure love
with each other.

00:05:51.206 --> 00:05:59.633
Now, one must understand the pure love,
that it is not attached to anyone,

00:05:59.834 --> 00:06:03.836
but at the same time, it is pure love.

00:06:04.037 --> 00:06:13.476
If you don’t have pure love in your heart
because the culture is different,

00:06:13.691 --> 00:06:25.630
people start moving their attention and
spoiling their attention.

00:06:26.106 --> 00:06:29.792
So, so many people asked Me: “Mother,
what to do?”

00:06:29.993 --> 00:06:34.154
I said: “Keep your eyes only up to three
feet,

00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:38.425
so you will see beautiful things, like you
will see flowers,

00:06:38.626 --> 00:06:43.923
you will see children, and nothing
horrible”.

00:06:44.124 --> 00:06:51.844
So, whatever makes your attention
disturbed, try to avoid.

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:57.469
Best is to concentrate on your meditation.

00:06:58.028 --> 00:07:04.971
For meditation in the morning you can
just put

00:07:05.172 --> 00:07:09.785
your right hand towards the photograph

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.299
and the left hand up there.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.822
Then put your left hand towards
the photograph… - like this.

00:07:23.188 --> 00:07:28.923
Then left hand towards the photograph
and right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:07:29.124 --> 00:07:35.009
[It] is better to sit on the ground,
in the morning.

00:07:35.564 --> 00:07:42.295
Then, if thoughtless awareness is
established

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:47.006
by looking at the photograph, close your
eyes.

00:07:47.276 --> 00:07:52.209
Now, some people say: “Mother, my heart
is not open”. All right.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:57.047
So you can say, looking at the Mother:

00:07:57.248 --> 00:08:03.180
“Mother, please, come in my heart.”

00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:06.647
Somebody’s Sahasrara is not open.

00:08:06.847 --> 00:08:10.987
Then you have to say: “Mother, please
come in my head”.

00:08:11.188 --> 00:08:13.957
With both the hands.

00:08:14.158 --> 00:08:20.927
Whatever portion you think in the body
is not doing well,

00:08:21.128 --> 00:08:26.826
I am always available, so you can ask.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.157
Your meditation should be good, first
and foremost.

00:08:32.358 --> 00:08:38.189
If you are good Sahaja Yogis, then only
others will believe you.

00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:43.651
But if you are not good Sahaja Yogis,
nobody will believe you.

00:08:43.852 --> 00:08:48.093
For so many people I have seen I am
something beyond them.

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:52.766
But Sahaja Yogis are the ones which really
make them feel

00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:57.062
that “these are extraordinary people”.

00:08:59.771 --> 00:09:05.913
Then, after that, dealing with them
as I said,

00:09:06.114 --> 00:09:13.140
has to be absolutely with pure attention.

00:09:13.341 --> 00:09:16.655
To begin with, the men should deal only
with men

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:21.112
and the women should deal only with women

00:09:21.313 --> 00:09:24.344
and no complications should come out.

00:09:24.545 --> 00:09:28.714
Because that is the biggest blemish Sahaja
Yoga can have,

00:09:28.915 --> 00:09:33.202
that they are just like ordinary people.

00:09:37.014 --> 00:09:41.457
So, you have to be careful about yourself.

00:09:41.658 --> 00:09:46.337
Before sleeping, if you have time, you must
do footsoaking.

00:09:46.538 --> 00:09:49.602
If one day you do not do it, don’t torture
yourself for that,

00:09:49.803 --> 00:09:53.829
but it’s better that you do footsoaking.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.865
And in footsoaking first of all you
must know

00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:03.235
what sort of a personality you have.

00:10:03.467 --> 00:10:06.810
Mostly you are right-sided, mostly.

00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:09.870
So put [your] right hand towards
the photograph,

00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:16.145
both the feet in the water with little salt
and left hand like that.

00:10:16.346 --> 00:10:19.807
But some are left-sided, some are
definitely very much.

00:10:20.008 --> 00:10:23.010
They should not touch water.

00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:29.390
Two types of treatments are there.

00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:34.532
Especially left-sided people should
not soak,

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:40.028
should not use ice. This is all right-sided
treatment.

00:10:40.229 --> 00:10:45.581
After doing your right-sided or left-sided
treatment,

00:10:45.782 --> 00:10:52.034
I would say you put both your hands towards
the photograph

00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:57.262
and see for yourself how it is working out,

00:10:59.174 --> 00:11:03.329
without water, without candle.

00:11:03.641 --> 00:11:07.350
But I would again say that right-sided
people should not

00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:11.498
use candle as far as possible.

00:11:13.892 --> 00:11:19.057
This electricity is all right, you can
use it.

00:11:19.258 --> 00:11:22.011
They should not sit in the sun, they should
put

00:11:22.212 --> 00:11:26.008
ice on their liver; also they can put ice
here

00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:29.399
when it is very hot, it’s very good to put
ice here.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.133
Also for diabetes you can put the ice here.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.058
In Sahaja Yoga the treatment is very
simple:

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:43.921
for right-sided people very simple, and
for left-sided.

00:11:44.122 --> 00:11:48.339
Right-sided people get problems like liver,

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:54.885
diabetes, blood cancer,

00:11:56.243 --> 00:12:00.095
kidney coagulation,

00:12:00.296 --> 00:12:05.811
that means they can’t pass urine,
constipation,

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:12.999
also asthma, heart attack – massive,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:22.480
and also paralysis, on the right side;
so many.

00:12:22.681 --> 00:12:29.868
Now, the left-sided people get pain
all over left side;

00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:36.981
also can get all kinds of psychosomatic
diseases which are not curable,

00:12:37.182 --> 00:12:46.083
like cancer, myelitis, Parkinson’s,
all kinds.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.143
But if you do your meditation every day,

00:12:50.344 --> 00:12:53.060
once in a while you may miss it, it doesn’t
matter,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.160
you will immediately feel that you are
completely cured

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:02.121
and you keep good health.

00:13:02.322 --> 00:13:05.897
That’s the only way you can grow.

00:13:06.098 --> 00:13:14.410
And try to bring the point where you are
thoughtlessly aware.

00:13:14.611 --> 00:13:22.216
The best way to be thoughtless is to say
the mantra of Nirvichara.

00:13:22.832 --> 00:13:26.803
That’s very important. And secondly,

00:13:27.004 --> 00:13:29.595
to go on for forgiving: “I forgive
everyone, I forgive everyone”

00:13:29.796 --> 00:13:37.440
so the thoughts will stop. That is the time
when you are in the present.

00:13:37.641 --> 00:13:43.794
That is the time really you will grow
in spirituality.

00:13:45.353 --> 00:13:50.166
We have people in India and abroad

00:13:50.367 --> 00:13:53.877
who have become such powerful Sahaja Yogis

00:13:54.078 --> 00:13:58.493
that just by prayer they can achieve
lot of things.

00:13:58.694 --> 00:14:04.228
We are not here to destroy anyone
or to torture anyone:

00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:11.411
we are here to help everyone, to make
them joyous.

00:14:11.802 --> 00:14:18.584
So one should not talk loudly, sharply,
never.

00:14:18.801 --> 00:14:23.860
And show your compassion. Now supposing
somebody has some problem:

00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:27.570
we should not suddenly say: “You are
a bhut”, no.

00:14:27.771 --> 00:14:31.249
“What’s your problem? Oh, you are
left-sided”.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.553
“What’s your problem? You are right-sided”.

00:14:34.754 --> 00:14:39.200
“All right, it can be cured. I was like
this”. If you say, they won’t feel hurt.

00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:43.411
“I was like you. You will be cured.
Don’t worry”.

00:14:43.612 --> 00:14:49.924
So we have to understand that we have
to be extremely careful

00:14:50.125 --> 00:14:55.170
as to what kind of words we are using,

00:14:55.864 --> 00:15:02.601
and what kind of things we are doing
in their presence.

00:15:02.802 --> 00:15:06.684
Some people are extremely fast, they will
walk fast

00:15:06.885 --> 00:15:13.110
and they will be handling things with such
a funny gestures

00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:16.885
that people will be frightened.

00:15:17.544 --> 00:15:20.342
You should not be such.

00:15:20.543 --> 00:15:28.543
What you have to do is to see that whatever
actions you take,

00:15:28.744 --> 00:15:32.874
you talk to them or do, do it in a gentle
way;

00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:38.436
that’s very important to be gentle and kind
to them.

00:15:38.637 --> 00:15:45.243
Also you’ll get people who will have bhuts,
who will have gurus on their heads,

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:48.378
like the other day that lady was arguing
with Me.

00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:52.178
Try to convince [them] and tell if the -

00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:55.382
you know now who are real and who
are unreal.

00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:59.244
If you don’t know, ask your leader.

00:15:59.445 --> 00:16:07.033
You better tell them that, “This is not
going to help you, it has not helped you,

00:16:07.405 --> 00:16:12.025
so you have to give up.” And I’m sure
they’ll agree.

00:16:12.226 --> 00:16:14.501
I’m very sure they’ll agree.

00:16:14.702 --> 00:16:20.728
Because the way other day that Sindhi
lady, she was arguing with me.

00:16:20.929 --> 00:16:23.894
And she said that, “We get Vibhutis
[Sacred ash] in all centers.”

00:16:24.095 --> 00:16:28.444
I said: “This is all bhuta vidya, preta
vidya and smashana vidya.

00:16:28.645 --> 00:16:34.396
What do you get out of the vibhuti that
comes in, what is so great?”

00:16:34.597 --> 00:16:40.023
All these things are just to mislead you.

00:16:40.224 --> 00:16:48.024
So tell them firmly, but with full
attention,

00:16:48.225 --> 00:16:54.747
that you are trying to help them. If you
want to help them

00:16:54.948 --> 00:17:03.420
then you cannot afford to be rude to them
in no way.

00:17:07.514 --> 00:17:16.364
It is sometimes difficult to handle some
people who start arguing,

00:17:16.565 --> 00:17:24.480
so best is not to argue. Tell them:
“By argument we cannot convince you.

00:17:24.713 --> 00:17:28.757
It is not in the mind, it is beyond
the mind.”

00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:35.523
Up to a point it’s all right, after that
you should give up: “All right, I’m sorry.”

00:17:36.401 --> 00:17:44.518
Then your relationships in your family
should be good.

00:17:44.719 --> 00:17:49.935
You can’t have Sahaja Yoga if there is
no understanding

00:17:50.136 --> 00:17:54.450
between you, your wife, your children.

00:17:54.651 --> 00:17:59.976
We have to show that family is very
important in Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:00.177 --> 00:18:05.818
extremely important, and children are
even more important.

00:18:06.019 --> 00:18:09.675
You see how much we have done for
the children now,

00:18:09.876 --> 00:18:16.067
we have got schools, this, that, is a very
big responsibility.

00:18:16.268 --> 00:18:22.561
So we must understand what is
the responsibility.

00:18:22.762 --> 00:18:26.673
We should not spoil the children.

00:18:27.503 --> 00:18:31.745
We should appreciate whatever good they
are doing,

00:18:31.946 --> 00:18:34.869
whatever nice things they are doing.
But if they do anything wrong,

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:40.476
you must tell them, “You are Sahaja Yogis
and you can't do like this.”

00:18:40.677 --> 00:18:45.714
That you have to tell them, whatever it is,
you have to tell them.

00:18:45.914 --> 00:18:50.027
If the children are very thin, then
understand they have got liver.

00:18:50.228 --> 00:18:51.892
So liver should be treated.

00:18:52.093 --> 00:18:54.559
And next time when you come to India

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.591
we are going to get you all the medicines
of liver.

00:18:59.834 --> 00:19:03.607
If they are very fat, then they are
left-sided.

00:19:03.808 --> 00:19:09.876
Try to bring them to the centre with
the three candle treatment.

00:19:10.558 --> 00:19:13.672
But first of all, test it what is
the situation.

00:19:13.873 --> 00:19:18.657
Sometimes they develop a puffy fat, [that]
is all right, but they become all right.

00:19:18.858 --> 00:19:22.136
So that is how you should look after
their health.

00:19:22.337 --> 00:19:29.332
Then also look after their behaviour.
Tell them how to behave.

00:19:29.533 --> 00:19:34.034
As I have seen in the West the children
are not properly brought up

00:19:34.235 --> 00:19:38.151
because the parents neglect them, I won’t
blame the children.

00:19:38.352 --> 00:19:41.765
Parents neglect them. You should be
loving, kind -

00:19:41.966 --> 00:19:49.071
at the same time you must tell them what
is discipline is. It is very important.

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:55.352
Then keep a-watch on them: How they are,
what they are doing.

00:19:55.553 --> 00:20:00.135
Of course, we have a school, but it has
limited seats there.

00:20:00.336 --> 00:20:07.253
Whatever it is, they are going to adjust
as many as possible.

00:20:07.454 --> 00:20:13.452
Even then supposing you have any problem,
don’t go arbitrarily into it.

00:20:13.653 --> 00:20:22.430
You may ask your leader or you may write
to Me and inform Me.

00:20:22.631 --> 00:20:26.444
Among you somebody might become very
ego-oriented,

00:20:26.645 --> 00:20:30.028
may start his own organisation, “I will
do this.”

00:20:30.229 --> 00:20:33.853
Let him say: “You get out” and he will
suffer.

00:20:34.054 --> 00:20:38.025
You do not have to worry. “All right, you
get out.”

00:20:38.226 --> 00:20:39.866
Anybody who is arbitrary will not work out.

00:20:40.067 --> 00:20:42.970
Supposing one finger starts acting more
than the rest –

00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:46.653
that means there is cancer, this is
malignancy.

00:20:46.854 --> 00:20:48.655
So we can’t have malignancy.

00:20:48.856 --> 00:20:53.641
All of you should work together with
understanding,

00:20:53.842 --> 00:21:00.754
before others as well as among yourselves.
It is very important to understand.

00:21:00.955 --> 00:21:04.068
Now, Sahaja Yoga has worked out in so
many countries.

00:21:04.269 --> 00:21:08.875
In such a big way in some, in such a small
way in some.

00:21:09.076 --> 00:21:16.550
But wherever it is, Sahaja Yogis have to be
something special.

00:21:16.751 --> 00:21:21.962
Even the children have to be something
special.

00:21:22.898 --> 00:21:26.096
You have any other problem which you do
not want to discuss,

00:21:26.297 --> 00:21:31.286
with, say, with your leader, then you can
write to Me directly, no harm.

00:21:31.487 --> 00:21:35.340
Either, if I answer well and good, if I do
not answer also well and good,

00:21:35.541 --> 00:21:38.678
it will work out.

00:21:40.108 --> 00:21:44.714
But attention should not be all the time
about yourself:

00:21:44.915 --> 00:21:49.451
me, my family, my children, my house,
my job, no.

00:21:49.652 --> 00:21:55.194
As soon as your attention is on other
people, it works out faster,

00:21:55.395 --> 00:21:59.520
it helps you very much. But on yourself:
“I am sick.

00:21:59.721 --> 00:22:04.322
I have this problem, that problem”,
nothing.

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:09.458
You are now at a stage when you can
absolutely solve all the problems,

00:22:09.659 --> 00:22:13.301
but first and foremost thing: if your
attention is on yourself,

00:22:13.502 --> 00:22:18.074
it won’t work out. Attention should be
on others.

00:22:18.275 --> 00:22:21.994
And if it has to be on yourself, attention,

00:22:22.195 --> 00:22:27.306
then just find out: “What’s wrong with me?”

00:22:27.507 --> 00:22:31.913
But some people in that also go too far.
“Mother, my Agnya is catching.

00:22:32.114 --> 00:22:36.467
Mother, my this is catching…” [it] is
nothing, [it] is nonsense.

00:22:36.668 --> 00:22:41.707
Maybe you are catching from other people,
possible.

00:22:43.412 --> 00:22:46.091
There are some nice books, now already
in Sahaja Yoga

00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:54.240
translated in Chinese, luckily, and also
My tapes could be translated also.

00:22:54.441 --> 00:22:58.549
But you have to keep My voice, as I told
you,

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.684
because that is mantra, isn’t it?

00:23:01.893 --> 00:23:06.396
And you can have subtitles, would be better
if you could do it.

00:23:06.597 --> 00:23:13.469
But it’s a very good idea that you can have
subtitles, really.

00:23:13.968 --> 00:23:19.027
Specially for Russians if they could do
in Russia.

00:23:19.228 --> 00:23:24.789
Now, [if] you have any questions, now you
can ask Me.

00:23:43.548 --> 00:23:46.856
So it should be always like, if you are
Chinese,

00:23:47.057 --> 00:23:51.862
then you should not only deal with Chinese.
They should all come to the collective.

00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:55.649
Supposing you are Indians, you should not
only deal with the Indians,

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.692
but they should come to the collective.

00:23:57.893 --> 00:24:00.572
Because unless and until they come
to the collective

00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:03.100
[they] will not know what the problem is.

00:24:03.301 --> 00:24:06.307
It’s not that you can organise separately
a group,

00:24:06.508 --> 00:24:09.837
another group separately. It has to be
one group.

00:24:10.038 --> 00:24:15.273
Of course, you could have two ashrams
or three ashrams, makes no difference.

00:24:18.766 --> 00:24:21.545
Any other question?

00:24:21.746 --> 00:24:25.163
Yogi: Is the camphor treatment good for
left side? Shri Mataji: What?

00:24:25.364 --> 00:24:28.375
Yogi: Camphor … Yogi 2: Camphor treatment.

00:24:28.576 --> 00:24:31.620
Yogi 2: The camphor treatment. He is asking
if the camphor treatment

00:24:31.821 --> 00:24:35.006
is good for left side. Shri Mataji: What?
Yogi 2: The camphor.

00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:37.274
Shri Mataji: No no no no. No need.

00:24:37.475 --> 00:24:40.222
Camphor, only once in a while. Don’t do
camphor.

00:24:40.423 --> 00:24:45.145
But you have done all mixed up things,
you see, just do left-sided treatment,

00:24:45.361 --> 00:24:48.810
then you will be all right. Just mixed up.

00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:52.835
And you cannot earn money in the name
of God

00:24:53.036 --> 00:24:56.157
or Divine work, that’s one thing.

00:24:56.358 --> 00:24:59.064
You cannot organise like that. No, never.

00:24:59.295 --> 00:25:00.594
Because once you start getting it,

00:25:00.795 --> 00:25:03.205
left-sided bhuts will come into you.
Yogi: I’ve never done that.

00:25:03.406 --> 00:25:08.286
Shri Mataji: That is the part of Sahaja
Yoga. We cannot.

00:25:10.779 --> 00:25:14.709
Also if you have any guru’s photographs
and all that,

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.178
it’s better to put them in the sea.

00:25:18.386 --> 00:25:24.968
Because this keeping any photograph,
any book about them creates problems.

00:25:25.169 --> 00:25:32.216
So religiously search it out and put them
in the sea.

00:25:32.417 --> 00:25:35.241
[Video interrupts brieftly]

00:25:35.701 --> 00:25:38.441
No no no no no no. No no no no. Don’t do
all that.

00:25:38.642 --> 00:25:43.379
They will work on the photograph. If you
want to help somebody, you see,

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:48.722
some other people who have come, whom
you want to raise, don’t touch them.

00:25:48.923 --> 00:25:54.459
Take a bandhan yourself and give them
a bandhan.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:58.315
Put them before the photograph and you
just raise the Kundalini.

00:25:58.516 --> 00:26:07.372
But be careful. Because you are still,
you see, not that sort of thing

00:26:07.573 --> 00:26:11.391
that you cannot catch, you might catch.

00:26:11.592 --> 00:26:17.710
So among yourselves also you should not
do that. Don’t touch.

00:26:17.911 --> 00:26:20.498
If somebody says, “I have this problem”,
all right,

00:26:20.699 --> 00:26:25.012
put him on the photograph, take a bandhan
yourself,

00:26:25.213 --> 00:26:28.769
ask him to take a bandhan, you also give
a bandhan

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:33.602
and then raise the Kundalini. Be careful.

00:26:37.472 --> 00:26:41.480
Even if there is somebody who has come
now who is a sick man.

00:26:41.681 --> 00:26:46.905
So you can give them a photograph, [it] is
all right, if they are willing to do it.

00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:53.766
But somebody in his family is willing
to take Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:53.967 --> 00:26:59.044
who is a healthy person, he should bring.
Otherwise don’t get after sick.

00:26:59.245 --> 00:27:03.024
You will have many sick, in thousands
to begin with.

00:27:03.225 --> 00:27:06.766
Don’t worry about sick.

00:27:07.808 --> 00:27:12.506
Or if they are sick tell them to take
the photograph

00:27:12.707 --> 00:27:16.694
and work it out, if they are left-sided
or right-sided.

00:27:16.895 --> 00:27:19.445
Then the faith grows, they improve.

00:27:19.646 --> 00:27:23.367
But you don’t touch the sick. No, no,
not at all.

00:27:23.568 --> 00:27:32.394
We are not here to cure the sick, but we
are here to give realisation.

00:27:36.976 --> 00:27:41.287
May God bless you.
Yogi: Shri Mataji, for technique,

00:27:41.488 --> 00:27:44.290
if you have a problem on one side, you have
imbalance

00:27:44.491 --> 00:27:49.335
and if the left side is weak or caught up,
do you raise the Kundalini

00:27:49.536 --> 00:27:52.692
on this side and give a bandhan
to the other side? Correct?

00:27:52.893 --> 00:27:55.530
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:27:57.041 --> 00:28:02.662
Supposing you are right-sided,

00:28:02.902 --> 00:28:07.607
then you have to put down the right side,

00:28:08.408 --> 00:28:12.103
remember that way, it’s much better.

00:28:12.304 --> 00:28:16.042
So then you raise your left side and put
the right side down,

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.427
if you have right-side problem.

00:28:18.628 --> 00:28:24.521
Now, if you have a left-side problem, so
you have to put down the left side.

00:28:24.722 --> 00:28:33.036
It’s easier to remember this way. So
there is no confusion.

00:28:38.274 --> 00:28:42.740
But tying up of Kundalini should be done
after you have moved out

00:28:42.941 --> 00:28:45.083
left to right or right to left, whichever
way.

00:28:45.284 --> 00:28:51.230
Then raise your Kundalini and tie up and
take a bandhan,

00:28:51.431 --> 00:28:54.378
it’s the best way.

00:29:02.617 --> 00:29:06.825
I would request you, all of you, to take
a photograph of yours

00:29:07.026 --> 00:29:13.910
and make an album, write it down below
that: what is your name,

00:29:14.111 --> 00:29:19.381
date of birth and of Self-realisation.

00:29:19.582 --> 00:29:24.520
Send it over to Me. Because I go on seeing
them sometimes, you see.

00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:29.616
So I’ll know you better and also I’ll have
My attention on you.

00:29:29.817 --> 00:29:35.334
Of the children as well as of bigger
people.

00:29:39.875 --> 00:29:42.321
So I’ll talk to you and talk to him

00:29:42.522 --> 00:29:45.600
because you have little individual
problems, both of you.

00:29:45.801 --> 00:29:49.997
What about you? Are you reconciled?

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:58.740
I’m going to get, you see, this one,
Werner, to task.

00:29:58.941 --> 00:30:02.774
He came here to do Sahaja Yoga and not
to disturb a family.

00:30:02.975 --> 00:30:09.903
He’s been very wrong. I’m going to be
very angry with him.

00:30:11.971 --> 00:30:16.468
He is an old Sahaja Yogi, he should have
behaved himself.

00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:21.913
It’s not - never to disturb a family. You
have such sweet beautiful children.

00:30:22.114 --> 00:30:26.562
I will never support you in nonsense,
I must tell you.

00:30:26.763 --> 00:30:30.807
And your husband is a very good man. If you
behave all right

00:30:31.008 --> 00:30:35.090
he’ll come round to Sahaja Yoga, I’m sure.

00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:39.858
You cannot be a Sahaja Yogi if you have
no dharma,

00:30:40.059 --> 00:30:53.018
“shield” as Buddha has called it. It’s what
we call as your character.

00:30:53.219 --> 00:30:58.320
Your morality is the most important
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:58.521 --> 00:31:03.444
If you are not moral, it has no meaning
at all.

00:31:03.645 --> 00:31:09.010
What we need is morality today. This is
happening everywhere, nonsense.

00:31:09.211 --> 00:31:17.858
We have to imbibe it in ourselves and we
have to generate it for others also.

00:31:18.059 --> 00:31:21.282
Whole world is full of immoral people.

00:31:21.483 --> 00:31:26.766
A very, very few who are standing
for morality.

00:31:26.967 --> 00:31:33.606
That is the greatest ornament we have.

00:31:37.532 --> 00:31:45.247
All right? Don’t go astray. This will never
help you.

00:31:45.455 --> 00:31:50.858
It was very wrong of you and also for
your children.

00:31:51.059 --> 00:31:55.289
Now go back and behave yourself properly,

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:59.560
otherwise you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:06.833 --> 00:32:12.555
Ha, if there was something wrong, then
it’s all right.

00:32:12.756 --> 00:32:16.433
We have divorce in Sahaja Yoga. We allow
people to divorce.

00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:21.353
But there should be substantial reason
for that.

00:32:28.825 --> 00:32:33.012
“Or to sub thik hai” [Is everything
all right?] What are we to do?

00:32:33.213 --> 00:32:35.532
That will do? All right.
Yogi: Thank You, Mother.

00:32:35.733 --> 00:32:38.572
Shri Mataji: May God Bless you all.

00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:43.047
I am sorry you had to come so late
in the night.

00:32:43.248 --> 00:32:45.495
Yogi: Mother, we have a small gift for You.

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:49.511
Shri Mataji: Why, you’ve done so much!

00:32:52.266 --> 00:32:57.956
Oh. Where is the children’s this thing,
presents?

00:33:03.625 --> 00:33:09.404
My God, a small present, is it?
Yogi: It’s very small.

00:33:24.562 --> 00:33:27.779
Shri Mataji: All right, what is this?

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:31.819
This is supposed to be small, is it?
From what angle?

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:36.799
Yogi: It’s just a big box!
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

00:33:43.687 --> 00:33:49.136
Ah. So now. What is that? Let’s see.

00:33:52.361 --> 00:33:55.575
My goodness.

00:33:57.798 --> 00:34:01.085
This is the one for what?
Yogis: Confucius.

00:34:01.286 --> 00:34:03.472
Yogis: Confucius. Guru.

00:34:03.673 --> 00:34:06.672
Shri Mataji: Confucius!

00:34:11.324 --> 00:34:19.463
He too has… you see?
Yogi: A stick.

00:34:22.688 --> 00:34:26.780
Shri Mataji: Fine, such an expensive one.

00:34:28.438 --> 00:34:33.740
Great. It’s very well done.

00:34:34.651 --> 00:34:38.831
Is it written here Confucius?
Yogi: Yes.

00:34:39.879 --> 00:34:45.974
Shri Mataji: All right. Thank you very
much.

00:34:46.523 --> 00:34:48.684
But you’ll have to bring it to India when
you come.

00:34:48.885 --> 00:34:51.822
[Yogi: “Yes, Shri Mataji”.]

00:34:54.896 --> 00:34:57.003
But such an expensive thing, you should not
have bought it.

00:34:57.204 --> 00:35:01.440
Yogi: Very good price, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Really?

00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:04.706
What is this? Yogi: This is Lao-Zi.
Yogi: Lao-Zi.

00:35:04.907 --> 00:35:08.098
Yogini: Lao-Tse. Yogi: Lao-Tse.
Shri Mataji: This is Lao-Tse?

00:35:08.299 --> 00:35:11.262
Nice!

00:35:44.545 --> 00:35:50.876
All right. He’s great I must say, Lao-Tse.

00:35:56.793 --> 00:36:02.746
Beautiful. He’s sitting on the clouds.

00:36:06.019 --> 00:36:08.535
Beautiful.

00:36:12.621 --> 00:36:16.809
[Yogini: “Wow”.] Good.

00:36:20.474 --> 00:36:25.936
This is His vahana. This is the one, is…
Yogi: Vehicle.

00:36:26.137 --> 00:36:28.044
Shri Mataji: Vahana, you know, this vahana
is …

00:36:28.245 --> 00:36:30.824
Yogi: Vehicle, isn’t it? Vehicle?
Shri Mataji: Conveyance.

00:36:31.055 --> 00:36:34.621
Yogi: Conveyance, yes.
Yogini: Conveyance, yes.

00:36:37.731 --> 00:36:42.899
Shri Mataji: Beautifully done. Thank you
very much, thank you.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:49.335
Is written here?
Yogi: This is Lao-Tse.

00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:56.068
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:05.580
This shows the little boy is controlling.
(Unclear) This is what?

00:37:05.781 --> 00:37:10.183
[Inaudible comments – Yogini: “This is
a cloth, and yes, a...”.

00:37:10.384 --> 00:37:14.139
Yogi: “A Goddess”.
Yogini: “A Goddess…”.]

00:37:34.963 --> 00:37:37.338
Shri Mataji: Who is that?
Yogi: Is a Goddess.

00:37:37.552 --> 00:37:41.194
Yogi: Goddess. Goddess. She is from China.

00:37:41.395 --> 00:37:43.256
Shri Mataji: Goddess. Yogis and Yoginis:
From China. Yes. A Goddess.

00:37:43.457 --> 00:37:46.855
Shri Mataji: Saraswati.
[Indistinct comments]

00:37:47.056 --> 00:37:53.371
Shri Mataji: Ah, it looks like Saraswati.
Very Indian silk.

00:37:55.119 --> 00:37:58.050
Yogi: Yes, we had this picture when
Buddhism first came…

00:37:58.251 --> 00:38:00.851
Yogi: We had this kind of picture

00:38:01.052 --> 00:38:05.763
when Buddhism first came to China.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

00:38:05.964 --> 00:38:11.089
Buddhism didn’t talk of women.

00:38:14.689 --> 00:38:21.473
Beautiful, very beautiful. Thank you very
much, thank you. Beautiful.

00:38:24.196 --> 00:38:27.309
Very well done.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.545
These two books he gave Me, where are
they? All right.

00:38:41.746 --> 00:38:45.613
You can keep them – please keep it
somewhere.

00:38:45.814 --> 00:38:48.928
Now what is that?
Yogini: From Vietnam.

00:38:49.129 --> 00:38:50.947
Yogini: Yes, it’s from Vietnam.

00:38:51.148 --> 00:38:52.287
Yogi: From Vietnam.
Shri Mataji: From Vietnam?

00:38:52.488 --> 00:38:55.013
Yogi: Vietnam.
Yogini: Yes, from Malaysia collective.

00:38:55.214 --> 00:38:57.561
Shri Mataji: You are from Vietnam?
Yogini: Yes.

00:38:57.762 --> 00:39:00.951
Shri Mataji: Really?
Yogini: Yes.

00:39:05.418 --> 00:39:09.330
Shri Mataji: One place I’ve not been to
is Vietnam.

00:39:09.539 --> 00:39:14.783
But [to] Korea I’ve been - South Korea
I’ve been.

00:39:35.724 --> 00:39:37.503
[Yogini (not clearly audible): “Lacquer
and sewing”]

00:39:37.704 --> 00:39:43.492
Oh, they make these in Vietnam?
Yogini: Yes.

00:39:43.693 --> 00:39:47.385
Yogi: It’s a beautiful thing through sewing.
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful.

00:39:47.586 --> 00:39:50.395
Is a painting?
Yogis: It’s a lacquer. Lacquer work.

00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:56.318
Shri Mataji: Lacquer work. Thank you
very much.

00:39:58.414 --> 00:40:05.488
So beautiful. Such a big lacquer work
I’ve never seen.

00:40:21.991 --> 00:40:27.871
Must be very expensive.
Yogini: We got it quite at a good price.

00:40:28.072 --> 00:40:33.874
Shri Mataji: Very beautiful. Thank you
very much.

00:40:34.452 --> 00:40:39.066
You want to take? Too close.

00:40:39.267 --> 00:40:43.123
[Yogi: “That’s we can take later.”]

00:40:44.999 --> 00:40:48.637
I’ll hold it.

00:41:03.726 --> 00:41:07.107
Very beautiful.

00:41:19.265 --> 00:41:22.425
Oh, thank you.

00:41:25.565 --> 00:41:30.793
All this has to come when you come
to Ganapatipule.

00:41:30.994 --> 00:41:34.584
Yogi: Actually, I would have loved one
Chinese to come this time.

00:41:34.785 --> 00:41:38.424
I’ll have to get lot more to carry all
these things.

00:41:38.625 --> 00:41:43.624
Shri Mataji: See, what I was saying,
for all the people from the East,

00:41:43.825 --> 00:41:47.387
there’s a concession they offer and it’s
much cheaper.

00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:53.710
I think what you can carry is quite a lot
but I don't know, they told Me...

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:57.345
I don't know how much – quite a bit
[not clearly audible].

00:41:57.546 --> 00:42:01.475
So I think they can come, Chinese.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:13.146
At least Ganapatipule. I've no idea,
I'll ask them.

00:42:23.215 --> 00:42:30.283
Last time who went on the tour from here?
Complete tour - was a complete.

00:42:30.491 --> 00:42:39.114
Yogi: Well, I was on the 11th of December.
[Indistinct conversation follows]

00:42:48.924 --> 00:42:52.497
Shri Mataji: This is for children.

00:42:53.312 --> 00:42:59.569
Now. So we’ll have boys first, come along.

00:43:01.295 --> 00:43:07.274
May God bless you. Now you have to write
poems in this, all right?

00:43:09.048 --> 00:43:12.209
You move forward.

00:43:15.163 --> 00:43:20.932
Is there any other boy? Come along.

00:43:21.163 --> 00:43:29.672
You must write poems. Thank you.
Come along.

00:43:31.944 --> 00:43:38.872
You are a boy also! Kuber, come along.

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:53.291
He’s done the pay week for Me.

00:43:54.486 --> 00:43:57.789
Now for the girls.

00:43:59.382 --> 00:44:04.732
He’s done a beautiful painting today,
you see?

00:44:28.143 --> 00:44:31.047
Did you do this one?
Child: Yes.

00:44:31.248 --> 00:44:36.059
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Good. Thank you.

00:44:37.891 --> 00:44:41.520
[Conversation aside with a yogi] Where is
that tea set we had bought? Did you get it?

00:44:41.721 --> 00:44:45.436
[Yogi: “Yes. Tea seats were at the back,
yes, two. There were two tea sets, Mother.

00:44:45.637 --> 00:44:48.552
I took the small one. The small one”.]

00:44:48.753 --> 00:44:54.145
Let it be now, you took only one so will
be a problem. All right.

00:44:54.368 --> 00:44:59.679
Who will get? I was thinking of dolls.
All right, for the girls.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:08.421
Now. You write poems. All right.
Come along.

00:45:12.527 --> 00:45:17.868
You want - which one you want? All right?

00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:22.405
Who else? All the girls.

00:45:26.556 --> 00:45:29.350
Ah.

00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:38.649
Yes, good.

00:45:45.758 --> 00:45:51.472
Very wise. Thank you.

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:07.885
Just… [To another girl] Which one?
All right.

00:46:11.292 --> 00:46:14.191
[Aside to a girl] Did you get one?
Girl: No, it’s ok.

00:46:14.399 --> 00:46:16.463
Shri Mataji: Is it all right?
Girl: It’s all right.

00:46:16.664 --> 00:46:18.798
Shri Mataji: Very sweet.
Girl: They need it…

00:46:18.999 --> 00:46:22.689
Boy: They need it more than you.
Shri Mataji: Ah?

00:46:23.697 --> 00:46:31.732
We could give her that tea set, and all
that, so we have. Can you find that?

00:46:34.245 --> 00:46:38.219
Girl: Thank you, Mataji.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

00:46:57.673 --> 00:47:02.125
All right, come along, you are lucky.

00:47:02.326 --> 00:47:06.464
Quite heavy. May God bless you.
Girl: Thank you very much.

00:47:06.665 --> 00:47:11.119
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you.
Girl: Thank you.

00:47:12.312 --> 00:47:15.040
Shri Mataji: You got it, Rishi?
Sahaja Yogi: Such cool vibrations.

00:47:15.241 --> 00:47:19.827
[Unclear] [Indistinct conversation]

00:47:20.787 --> 00:47:24.281
Shri Mataji: All right, Soma is better now?
Yogi: Yes, it has improved…

00:47:24.482 --> 00:47:28.125
Shri Mataji: Better, yes.
Yogi: … since she came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:28.335 --> 00:47:31.987
Girl: Thank you very much, Shri Mataji.

00:47:32.188 --> 00:47:35.145
Shri Mataji: Next time I would like to see
your poems.

00:47:35.346 --> 00:47:41.349
All right? Kuber, you too.

00:47:42.516 --> 00:47:49.388
And also nice drawings. Where is
the drawing gone of Kuber?

00:47:49.597 --> 00:47:54.229
This I want to take with Me.
It’s refreshing.

00:47:57.678 --> 00:48:01.876
All right. May God bless you. May God
bless you.

00:48:02.077 --> 00:48:07.001
Look after yourself. And know that you are
Sahaja Yogis,

00:48:07.202 --> 00:48:12.034
is a very big position, you are saints.
Special people.

00:48:12.235 --> 00:48:15.304
You are the foundation.

00:48:15.505 --> 00:48:21.662
Anyway I may go to mainland China and
talk to the…

00:48:23.657 --> 00:48:31.188
Let’s see if Prime Minister listens to Me.
May be.

00:48:31.389 --> 00:48:34.429
May God bless you.

00:48:37.684 --> 00:48:42.446
Yogis: Thank you, Mother.
Shri Mataji: It’s all right.

00:48:42.647 --> 00:48:44.865
Yogi: Thank You Mother, for coming
to Hong Kong…

00:48:45.066 --> 00:48:49.253
Shri Mataji: Wah-wah.
Yogi: …and blessing us all.

00:48:53.978 --> 00:48:56.480
Shri Mataji: You just wait and - you just
wait. [Yogi: “OK”.]

00:48:56.681 --> 00:49:00.293
Then I will go and talk to him.

00:49:00.494 --> 00:49:03.533
May God bless you.

00:49:06.651 --> 00:49:12.146
And I think people are very simple, very
simple people in North Korea.

00:49:12.347 --> 00:49:14.825
You are South-Korean? Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Ah, I went to South Korea,

00:49:15.026 --> 00:49:19.455
I’m sorry, not North, South Korea.

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:26.256
But you see, still they have no idea
of a spiritual life. No idea.

00:49:26.457 --> 00:49:30.154
So, you go there quite often?
Yogini: Yes, tomorrow I’ll go there.

00:49:30.355 --> 00:49:31.970
Shri Mataji: She goes to… She goes…

00:49:32.171 --> 00:49:34.247
Yogini 2: She is my sister who came here
today.

00:49:34.448 --> 00:49:38.668
Shri Mataji: So start talking about Sahaja
Yoga. All right?

00:49:38.869 --> 00:49:45.711
Yogini: Yes. It’s the first time…
Shri Mataji: No, no, you can do it.

00:49:45.912 --> 00:49:49.912
So have programme, or something. And get
more people here

00:49:50.113 --> 00:49:58.196
from South Korea. And send them over.
You can do very well.

00:49:58.397 --> 00:50:01.583
Too much American influence.
[Yogini: “Right”.]

00:50:01.784 --> 00:50:10.777
That’s the problem. And also then I saw
one programme

00:50:10.978 --> 00:50:14.830
they had invited us to, supposed to be
a very special one.

00:50:15.031 --> 00:50:21.404
And we were sitting on the top from
the galleries, you see, for VIPs

00:50:21.605 --> 00:50:25.573
and downstairs, and I’ve never seen
such a show.

00:50:25.781 --> 00:50:30.733
Very dirty show they showed. Very dirty.

00:50:30.934 --> 00:50:34.295
I’ve never seen. And CP was wearing his
glasses and he just closed his eyes,

00:50:34.496 --> 00:50:37.322
and I had to, said it, “Close your eyes,
you can’t bear it”.

00:50:37.531 --> 00:50:43.128
And both of us vomited. Leave show.

00:50:43.329 --> 00:50:47.396
I’ve never seen such a dirt anywhere.

00:50:47.971 --> 00:50:51.139
You know, I mean, can’t imagine how
they have

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:56.419
taken these things from these stupid
Americans.

00:50:57.788 --> 00:51:00.895
You can work it out, all right?
May God bless you.

00:51:01.096 --> 00:51:04.907
Yoginis: Thank You, Mother.

00:51:05.108 --> 00:51:08.816
Shri Mataji: We have to think of our
countries, we have to save them.

00:51:09.017 --> 00:51:15.854
Don’t you think so? It’s very important,
to save your own country.

00:51:16.055 --> 00:51:22.514
Just I give you all the powers.
May God bless you.

00:51:22.715 --> 00:51:25.866
First grow in Sahaja Yoga, first grow
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:51:26.067 --> 00:51:28.262
these people can also come sometimes.

00:51:28.463 --> 00:51:34.247
We can send some other people. We could
have programmes. All right?

00:51:34.448 --> 00:51:35.967
May God bless you. Yogini: Are You going
to come to Korea again?

00:51:36.168 --> 00:51:39.031
Yogini: Are You going
to come to Korea again, another time?

00:51:39.239 --> 00:51:41.364
Yogi: She is asking if You are you going
to come to Korea.

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:47.225
Shri Mataji: Anyone at this time - I’m
so busy now, I don’t know.

00:51:47.426 --> 00:51:52.878
Keeping Me too busy. That’s all right,
I think it will work out.

00:51:53.079 --> 00:51:56.321
These people can go and work it out.
All right?

00:51:56.568 --> 00:52:00.279
Yogini: Thank you. /Shri Mataji: May God
bless you. /Yogini: Thank you.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.459
Shri Mataji: So, are you feeling better
now, with him?

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.920
You have Ekadasha, you know?
Yogini: Yes, I know.

00:52:06.121 --> 00:52:10.077
Shri Mataji: Ekadasha means beginning
of cancer, do you know?

00:52:10.278 --> 00:52:15.015
Don’t struggle anymore. You know,
no mother can live without children.

00:52:15.215 --> 00:52:20.913
See, all this is a temporary sort
of infatuation, finished, is this.

00:52:21.115 --> 00:52:23.155
Mother is a mother.

00:52:23.356 --> 00:52:28.191
How she stands, you know, for her children.
All right? That’s more important.
