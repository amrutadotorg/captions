00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:06.515
Today, you are all celebrating my birthday.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:13.714
This is a matter of great satisfaction,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.720
as in this time of Kaliyuga, who celebrates the birthday of mother?

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:23.677
This shows that though you all are

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.849
born in this Kaliyuga,

00:00:28.436 --> 00:00:33.162
you don’t just know about your duty towards the mother,

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:36.638
but you also follow it.

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:42.152
At this age,

00:00:42.383 --> 00:00:46.363
To celebrate birthdays means, a year is getting deducted every year.

00:00:47.956 --> 00:00:51.527
and there are so many tasks still to be done.

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:57.567
I can see many tasks,, which are incomplete

00:00:57.962 --> 00:01:00.533
We will have to work hard and pay attention to them,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.833
only then can they be completed.

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:12.857
Like I said yesterday, in Delhi,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.503
we should pay attention to our culture.

00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:23.518
We should sort out our cultural state also.

00:01:25.537 --> 00:01:29.378
and the third thing which is very important,

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:31.116
is that

00:01:31.493 --> 00:01:35.366
towards our spiritual ascent, we

00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:41.583
should pay not just the attention but as a

00:01:43.528 --> 00:01:50.286
martyr who is ready to sacrifice his life for his cause,

00:01:50.437 --> 00:01:55.794
same fervour we should have for the Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:57.443 --> 00:02:01.483
Until we have this sentiment within us,

00:02:01.713 --> 00:02:04.641
Sahaja Yoga is going to be only for our benefit.

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:09.061
What are our benefts, what kind of happiness we got from this,

00:02:09.593 --> 00:02:12.497
is what I keep hearing all the time.

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:17.852
Whatever we have benefited from it,

00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:21.259
whatever good has happened,

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:29.096
is because of the only reason – that we have found your spirit.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.702
But when the light has come in you, you have become the lamp,

00:02:35.453 --> 00:02:38.429
then you can’t hide the lamp somewhere.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.526
You should bring your lamp out.

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:48.455
And Sahaja yog, as I have said many times, is society-facing.

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.901
Facing towards the society- that is Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:56.926
The light that can’t be spread, is of no use.

00:02:57.936 --> 00:03:00.182
So every Sahaj yogi should think,

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:07.245
"how and in which dimension or style have I spread Sahaja Yoga".

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:11.889
Firstly, a sort of speciality should enter your personality.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.237
And on attaining this speciality, I have enlightened so many people.

00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:26.335
Today, when you embark on any task, in any country,

00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.440
the first question arises about the state of the people there.

00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:34.836
What are their vices, what are their conditionings,

00:03:35.155 --> 00:03:38.615
how much ego do they have? that is measured first.

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.766
Then the consideration comes if this work can be achieved or not.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.305
The biggest problem is the human being.

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.543
Even if the number of people is huge,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.592
if their state is not good, then no task can be  completed properly.

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:57.816
Sahaja Yoga has done this greatest task,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.514
of transforming human beings, has changed humen so much.

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.850
it has brought forth their ascent.

00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:11.365
Today, Sahaj yogis are honest, truthful, hard-working people.

00:04:11.763 --> 00:04:15.675
the kind of people which are very difficult to find in this country.

00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:21.032
Very rare type of people, who do what they say,

00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:25.496
They think what they know.

00:04:26.637 --> 00:04:29.518
Sahaj yoga has readied such rare type of people

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:34.954
In this respect, Sahaj yoga is a massive blessing on this country.

00:04:36.388 --> 00:04:40.715
However, if you have these fine people,

00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:44.612
like a talented artisan, who is without any work,

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.750
then this talent goes to waste.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:53.534
So, every Sahaj yogi has to think about "how I can use my talent".

00:04:54.843 --> 00:05:01.907
But, he also first thinks of his physical troubles and comfort

00:05:06.117 --> 00:05:08.680
Or he thinks how I can-

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.037
I may have to spend money on this.

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:14.863
or the expenditure may increase, how to manage that?

00:05:16.878 --> 00:05:20.957
In reality, you can not purchase joy, you can only experience it.

00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:25.368
But, whatever we obtain,

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:31.566
or accept and adopt, get joy from it within us,

00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:38.365
is different and Sahaj Yoga is different.

00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:46.034
You get the joy here only by sharing it and there is no other way.

00:05:47.443 --> 00:05:51.101
For that you may have to bear some troubles

00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:53.471
face some problems,

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.921
but they don’t seem like troubles because your spirit gets satisfied.

00:05:58.136 --> 00:06:00.786
Bodily comforts don’t matter to you anymore.

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:03.291
You have to test yourself

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.244
that when you become the spirit,

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:10.411
when you share this light of the spirit with others,

00:06:10.514 --> 00:06:13.173
then you go beyond bodily comforts.

00:06:15.383 --> 00:06:18.525
You get so much joy of the spirit

00:06:18.793 --> 00:06:21.530
that in that joy of spirit,

00:06:23.055 --> 00:06:25.372
you get immersed completely.

00:06:26.056 --> 00:06:27.912
"Atmani atmana tushtah".

00:06:28.548 --> 00:06:30.722
spirit gets satisfied only by the spirit

00:06:30.802 --> 00:06:33.535
and does not require any other satisfaction.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.103
He doesn’t look for anything else.

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:41.024
He gets so satisfied that He feels he’s drunk ambrosia.

00:06:41.941 --> 00:06:45.909
After having ambrosia, there is no need to have anything else.

00:06:46.984 --> 00:06:48.745
when you get this state,

00:06:48.897 --> 00:06:51.230
then you should know that you have become a Sahaj yogi,

00:06:51.341 --> 00:06:53.341
else you are still incomplete.

00:06:54.954 --> 00:06:57.573
Now You all know that I have become old

00:06:57.676 --> 00:07:01.534
and I have worked hard for 14 years tirelessly.

00:07:01.661 --> 00:07:04.684
You can say my penance is now complete.

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:08.646
But, these last twelve years of hard work has been too much.

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:13.197
It seems the hard work will have to continue for another 12 years.

00:07:13.926 --> 00:07:17.347
But, you have to see how much hard work you are putting in.

00:07:17.712 --> 00:07:20.579
Your mind will find one excuse or the other

00:07:20.736 --> 00:07:23.926
– that it can’t be done, I have my family,

00:07:24.157 --> 00:07:28.964
my children, my house, my this, my that.

00:07:29.294 --> 00:07:34.881
But, beyond all these things is the universe of joy.

00:07:34.977 --> 00:07:38.740
If you want to achieve that, then you should know that

00:07:38.836 --> 00:07:42.265
you have to fulfil the desire of your spirit.

00:07:42.952 --> 00:07:45.880
Until you don’t fulfil the desires of your spirit,

00:07:46.211 --> 00:07:48.528
all your desires will stay as they are

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.711
and all your tasks will stay as they are.

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:52.433
You can’t achieve anything,

00:07:52.568 --> 00:07:55.663
especially welfare, unless your yoga is fully established.

00:07:55.846 --> 00:08:00.905
But, as soon as your yoga takes place and gets established,

00:08:01.008 --> 00:08:04.319
you will notice that all your problems will be solved instantly.

00:08:04.447 --> 00:08:06.980
your problems have been solved, right?

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:09.113
All of yours have!

00:08:09.731 --> 00:08:14.302
Then you move forward and see whtever we think is a problem for us,

00:08:14.747 --> 00:08:18.317
we think is very difficult for us,

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:23.496
instead you just think "we are involved in the work of Sahaj yoga,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.367
and God is going to look after us,

00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:28.507
then you will find that

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.840
all that you consider as problems will all disappear altogether.

00:08:35.072 --> 00:08:38.826
I told you once before that the Kundalini,

00:08:42.094 --> 00:08:47.855
remains beyond any cause and effect.

00:08:48.454 --> 00:08:51.295
And, When you rise in your Kundalini, then

00:08:51.763 --> 00:08:54.516
the cause gets omitted, as does the effect.

00:08:54.611 --> 00:08:57.896
When the cause is not there, effect also is not there.

00:08:58.654 --> 00:09:01.083
You have witnessed it.

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:03.940
Many of you know that these things happen all the time.

00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:05.266
And it is happening.

00:09:05.338 --> 00:09:09.385
We’ve got the things we never imagined,

00:09:09.457 --> 00:09:11.206
we have achieved it.

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:15.500
we have got so much happiness, we have got everything in Sahaj yoga,

00:09:15.851 --> 00:09:20.342
And even then if we are troubled about small-small things,

00:09:21.677 --> 00:09:23.962
then it will become a difficult situation.

00:09:24.182 --> 00:09:27.237
We should now think

00:09:27.452 --> 00:09:33.182
that we have found so much happiness, comfort and security

00:09:33.349 --> 00:09:34.571
and this Sahaj Yoga

00:09:34.738 --> 00:09:38.079
when we give to others, they can also achieve these things.

00:09:38.349 --> 00:09:42.325
But, when we give it to others, then we get more of it ourselves.

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:47.495
There are many thousand messengers of God, at work for us.

00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:55.821
There are crores of hands, crores of their powers behind you all.

00:09:55.933 --> 00:09:59.623
If one person stands up to do the work of Sahaj Yoga,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.422
then you will not realise how things will happen,

00:10:02.478 --> 00:10:04.334
how things will get arranged,

00:10:04.433 --> 00:10:07.686
no one knows how things happen, but it will happen.

00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:10.667
But, first, you have to prepare yourself.

00:10:10.937 --> 00:10:15.802
because the deities which are inside you, know what you are?

00:10:16.548 --> 00:10:19.056
whether you are truthful or fake

00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:24.279
How high or low you are, they know everything.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:30.759
And until they are sure that you are fully dedicated,

00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:32.719
they will not help you.

00:10:33.118 --> 00:10:40.729
Once they know that you haven’t come just for your selfish reasons,

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:45.253
but have come to do Sahaj yoga- which is society- facing-

00:10:45.902 --> 00:10:47.639
you have come to spread it,

00:10:47.838 --> 00:10:49.746
then you will be surprised that

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.040
that you will be showered with blessings from all four directions,

00:10:53.143 --> 00:10:57.299
– like the whole atmosphere will become fragrant

00:10:57.379 --> 00:10:59.118
and you will feel light

00:10:59.286 --> 00:11:02.019
as if " I have no weight on my shoulders" everything is happening,

00:11:04.056 --> 00:11:06.992
and everything gets organised by itself.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.649
We have to come to that state.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.408
Then you can see every person can do a lot of work and spread Sahaja.

00:11:17.447 --> 00:11:22.938
I know that in Delhi, we still have to work a lot individually,

00:11:24.288 --> 00:11:26.097
and then collectively.

00:11:27.055 --> 00:11:28.007
It’s possible

00:11:28.071 --> 00:11:32.103
for you all to talk to your neighbours and relatives about it.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.427
You can call them all and tell them.

00:11:34.658 --> 00:11:38.141
In India we have a very nice arrangement where we have our children,

00:11:38.229 --> 00:11:41.029
our relatives, and acquaintances.

00:11:41.253 --> 00:11:42.966
we can talk to all of them about it.

00:11:43.031 --> 00:11:45.880
It is possible, among them Only a handful may believe in it.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:50.642
But, when they will see how your state and realise the change in you,

00:11:50.853 --> 00:11:53.122
then they will definitely make an effort.

00:11:53.202 --> 00:11:54.479
At least some will.

00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:58.630
In this manner, you can help spread Sahaj yoga.

00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:03.019
Every person, whether it’s a woman or a man or a child,

00:12:03.147 --> 00:12:06.678
every person when enlightened,

00:12:07.138 --> 00:12:10.359
has a right to establish in Yoga,

00:12:10.447 --> 00:12:14.447
but, it is their duty to give this light to others.

00:12:15.146 --> 00:12:18.018
You have the power and everything

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.381
and if even then you didn’t give yoga to others,

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:24.730
then I can’t say how appropriate that would be.

00:12:30.315 --> 00:12:34.113
In our Delhi centre,

00:12:34.651 --> 00:12:39.357
many questions have arisen about which I would like to talk.

00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:41.987
I will tell these people the problems we have

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.768
and how you can obtain

00:12:49.038 --> 00:12:50.664
the solutions to these questions.

00:12:50.824 --> 00:12:52.117
It’s not a difficult task.

00:12:52.256 --> 00:12:55.366
However, what we think from our mind

00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:00.390
and any decisions we take based on our opinions,

00:13:00.563 --> 00:13:03.505
still, until we

00:13:03.656 --> 00:13:06.966
haven’t won over our Hamsa chakra and haven’t got the discretion,

00:13:07.046 --> 00:13:09.579
until we develop descretion within us,

00:13:09.854 --> 00:13:18.781
until we have the power to know what is right and wrong,

00:13:19.043 --> 00:13:23.551
anything we know what is beneficial for Sahaj yoga,

00:13:23.758 --> 00:13:28.543
until we develop the subtlity within us, to understand this,

00:13:28.735 --> 00:13:32.378
until then you haven’t completely achieved Sahaj yoga.

00:13:33.228 --> 00:13:35.379
How does that wisdom come?

00:13:35.474 --> 00:13:36.506
Some ask, how do you get it?

00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:39.871
How do you know you can ride a cycle? when you can actually ride it.

00:13:40.699 --> 00:13:43.627
How do you drive a motor car? When you start driving it!

00:13:43.921 --> 00:13:47.968
Similarly how does subtle intelligence come? Just when it comes!

00:13:50.415 --> 00:13:52.963
How does it come? By being indifferent to it.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:56.264
You start watching everything in a witness state, meditate,

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:02.372
and spend your time thinking about Sahaj yoga, then it will come.

00:14:04.216 --> 00:14:06.606
But, how will it come, when will it happen?

00:14:06.916 --> 00:14:09.130
It will happen when it does happen.

00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:13.162
And if this hasn’t developed inside us yet,

00:14:13.282 --> 00:14:15.687
then we should try to achieve it.

00:14:15.775 --> 00:14:19.234
That’s why I said that now we should try really hard.

00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.640
We should try really hard.

00:14:22.041 --> 00:14:25.200
I had told them to invite only those people to the puja,

00:14:25.319 --> 00:14:28.287
who have actually achieved something, and

00:14:30.496 --> 00:14:36.665
(okay, wait, wait, now who ever has sent him, what do they understand? he is a child,)

00:14:37.087 --> 00:14:39.687
Anyone capable of achieving something,

00:14:40.022 --> 00:14:42.736
to give them is your paramount duty.

00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:48.069
On every birthday, you make some or other new resolution.

00:14:51.452 --> 00:14:56.381
Now, I understand that I should also make a new resolution.

00:14:58.114 --> 00:15:02.384
And the new resolution is that

00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:06.703
the Vishwa Dharma that We have made,

00:15:07.194 --> 00:15:10.742
the universal religion that We have established,

00:15:11.353 --> 00:15:12.793
and we all follow it,

00:15:14.263 --> 00:15:17.199
if whoever doesn’t follow its ‘Maryada’ (boundaries),

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.692
such a person have no right to be called a Sahaj yogi.

00:15:19.843 --> 00:15:23.366
This is what I thought that we should all resolve.

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:30.453
Anyone who follows its Maryada, only he/she can be its follower.

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:34.637
Any follower of Vishwa dharma, who doesn’t live by it,

00:15:34.962 --> 00:15:37.621
then we can’t accept him/her as a Sahaj yogi.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.839
For example, if a person is Sahaja Yogi, and he takes dowry,

00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:44.356
then he can’t be a Sahaj yogi.

00:15:44.525 --> 00:15:48.382
Anyone believing in the caste system, can’t be a Sahaj yogi.

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:52.207
Any person believing in class system can not be a SahajaYogi.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.582
So, Today I have decided that from today any person,

00:15:57.253 --> 00:15:59.157
who calls himself a Sahaj yogi,

00:15:59.253 --> 00:16:02.943
should have a complete understanding of Vishwa Dharma.

00:16:03.364 --> 00:16:08.245
Not only this, but if it doesn’t reflect in their behaviour,

00:16:08.331 --> 00:16:11.124
Supposing any sahaja Yogi behaves this way,

00:16:11.244 --> 00:16:13.833
then he has no right to be in Sahaj Yoga.

00:16:14.064 --> 00:16:16.992
He should be told that he should atone for his mistakes,

00:16:17.103 --> 00:16:20.208
and correct himself as part of their atonement,

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.897
only then he can come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.763
There is no problem if people say only fewer people are left.

00:16:28.549 --> 00:16:31.287
There is very less space left in God’s kingdom.

00:16:31.541 --> 00:16:33.081
You don’t know.

00:16:34.138 --> 00:16:37.005
How many people can you accommodate there?

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.273
Even hell doesn’t have enough space.

00:16:43.246 --> 00:16:47.053
People will have to be kept somewhere in between only.

00:16:50.666 --> 00:16:53.761
That’s why, half baked people,

00:16:55.137 --> 00:16:57.401
who are good for nothing,

00:16:57.655 --> 00:16:59.996
shouldn’t come to Sahaj Yoga.

00:17:02.027 --> 00:17:04.407
There is no need to trouble us.

00:17:05.678 --> 00:17:09.424
People who come to Sahaj should follow it's protocol,

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.815
and instil them in their behaviour, practice them,

00:17:14.163 --> 00:17:18.552
Tell your neighbours completely about it

00:17:18.857 --> 00:17:22.079
and say that we believe in universal religion,

00:17:22.452 --> 00:17:24.714
and not in any other religion.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:29.491
If yogis don’t say that then we can’t accept them as yogis.

00:17:29.659 --> 00:17:33.533
people who are scared to tell people in their society that

00:17:33.851 --> 00:17:35.918
they are Yogis of Vishwa Dharma,

00:17:36.216 --> 00:17:39.864
people who are afraid to tell that they are Sahaja Yogis,

00:17:40.647 --> 00:17:43.631
Sahaja Yoga is not available for such people.

00:17:44.307 --> 00:17:48.783
You will have to fully follow the protocols of Sahaj yoga.

00:17:49.353 --> 00:17:50.972
Like, many people are there

00:17:51.107 --> 00:17:55.028
who tell that that ‘Mother, we sometimes drink a little alcohol,

00:17:55.621 --> 00:17:58.819
smoke a little, consume tobacco also’,

00:17:59.248 --> 00:18:01.315
Then you can not be a Sahaj yogi.

00:18:01.643 --> 00:18:06.182
If a person doesn’t follow the Maryada of Sahaj yoga,

00:18:06.444 --> 00:18:08.639
then he can not follow a universal religion.

00:18:08.837 --> 00:18:10.971
And this Universal relegion of ours,

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.423
we must keep completely pure as it’s not just a universal religion,

00:18:15.647 --> 00:18:17.623
but Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:18:17.742 --> 00:18:20.630
I can’t allow any impurity to creep in,

00:18:20.798 --> 00:18:23.678
That’s why anyone impure, can’t come into it.

00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:30.991
Only those people who have fully accepted this universal religion

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.294
and follow the protocol can stay in it.

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:37.770
This is the resolution I have made for my birthday

00:18:37.913 --> 00:18:42.195
and I hope you will accept it with love.

00:18:45.855 --> 00:18:49.439
Now, about the specialities of this universal religion,

00:18:50.137 --> 00:18:53.811
how should it be and what is its depth-

00:18:53.994 --> 00:18:56.400
– all this, I will tell you on some other day.

00:18:56.766 --> 00:19:03.123
But, for now, you mustn’t do things that you roughly know to be wrong,

00:19:04.582 --> 00:19:05.582
Things

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:10.208
even in the normal light,

00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:17.666
if you can see that, is not Sahaj, that thing you cannot do.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.617
And If you can’t get rid of these things, then you must spare Me.

00:19:23.252 --> 00:19:24.772
I can’t fight you.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.687
I have seen many people come just to get cured.

00:19:29.165 --> 00:19:32.752
Then they will come with the second disease, then the third.

00:19:32.951 --> 00:19:36.093
The reason is after being cured once, you should become Sahaj.

00:19:36.253 --> 00:19:39.847
If you don’t become Sahaj, and after that you become a-Sahaj,

00:19:40.044 --> 00:19:41.980
then you become ill yet again.

00:19:42.608 --> 00:19:43.949
Again you become sick.

00:19:44.076 --> 00:19:47.736
Do I keep washing you like a washerman the whole life?

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.919
So, you should also keep yourself pure,

00:19:52.047 --> 00:19:55.837
and should follow this religion like it’s our ornament,

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.202
this is our glory, our speciality,

00:19:59.313 --> 00:20:03.043
This is why we are sitting in a high pedestal in the world.

00:20:03.875 --> 00:20:06.748
Every part of our body should have this thought.

00:20:07.455 --> 00:20:10.034
From each core of body the vibrations flow.

00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:15.337
You should understand that God is so eager to decorate you with this,

00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:18.441
But, how aware you are about it,

00:20:18.632 --> 00:20:22.544
and how much you are ready for this, you should know.

00:20:24.753 --> 00:20:27.959
I tell you as much as I can.

00:20:28.247 --> 00:20:30.477
Now, the yardstick is

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:34.048
that unless you follow the religion of Sahaj yoga,

00:20:34.235 --> 00:20:38.798
you can’t enter Sahaja Yoga and you don’t have a right to pujas.

00:20:40.836 --> 00:20:42.987
and you will have no right to anything else.

00:20:43.187 --> 00:20:48.107
Whoever stays in the Maryada, only will have this right.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:51.371
We might have only 4-5 people left, but doesn’t matter.

00:20:51.464 --> 00:20:54.019
That will make things easier.

00:20:56.856 --> 00:20:59.745
You should be very aware towards this,

00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:05.060
make your life such that you all are together

00:21:05.172 --> 00:21:09.584
and attain the meaning of your self, and be with one another.

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:12.423
And with that, you should become capable.

00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:18.082
This is my blessing to you that you all should realise your powers

00:21:18.439 --> 00:21:22.359
and then nourish the whole world with this power of love.

00:21:28.908 --> 00:21:32.583
Since, today is my birthday, the puja will not be a long one.

00:21:32.901 --> 00:21:34.397
A simple puja is going to happen,

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:37.487
first of all, with names of shri Ganesha My feet will be washed,

00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:39.326
and with that nectar of the feet will be made. (charanamrit)

00:21:39.446 --> 00:21:42.525
After that My feet will be washed with water,

00:21:42.817 --> 00:21:44.976
and that water will be theerth.(Holy water)

00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:48.110
And after that I will prepare the charanamrit using My hands,

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.013
and at that time 108 names of Devi will be taken.

00:21:52.085 --> 00:21:55.044
That's it. There will not be much puja.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.586
Does everybody has the 108 names?

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:03.467
Ganesha's name?

00:22:03.643 --> 00:22:06.668
No, no. Devi's name.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.303
Devi;s name. Distribute 108 names .

00:22:11.533 --> 00:22:12.017
What?

00:22:12.303 --> 00:22:14.570
You have it but do others have it?

00:22:15.861 --> 00:22:17.551
Does Everybody have it?

00:22:18.859 --> 00:22:21.462
Have you got printed?

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:26.729
But now, they don't have that now, just now.

00:22:29.231 --> 00:22:32.706
Okay now, among the 108 names,

00:22:32.905 --> 00:22:34.706
He will tell you the first name,

00:22:34.905 --> 00:22:37.639
then you convert it intio mantra and say.

00:22:38.563 --> 00:22:42.293
Then you convert it into mantra and say.
