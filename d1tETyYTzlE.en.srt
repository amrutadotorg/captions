1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,800
Today we have assembled here

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,120
to worship Shri Ganesha,

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,680
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:41,760
He is the ocean of innocence.

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:53,760
And though He is such a young, little boy,

6
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,000
He can fight the whole world,

7
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:10,800
He can destroy all the negativity.

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,080
That’s the sign of innocence.¶

9
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,480
There have been stories

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,160
that children who have fallen from a very great height

11
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,920
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

12
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:42,480
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,040
that it doesn’t harm anyone

14
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,400
who is not to be harmed.

15
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,160
It has all the wisdom of the world,

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,920
all the understanding of the world;

17
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,920
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,080
the world, the whole world

19
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:21,360
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,640
might not have worshiped innocence so much,

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,680
but they all stand,

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,640
stand up against anybody who tries

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,560
to harm the innocence.¶

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:47,720
You can see in your own lives around you,

25
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,680
anybody tries to trouble children,

26
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,040
all of the them, whatever they are,

27
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,760
whatever they are coming from,

28
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,760
whatever maybe their nationality,

29
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,240
they all jump,

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,200
all jump to control and to safeguard that child.

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,280
What is it?

32
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,800
What is it within us

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,360
that makes us so very conscious

34
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,320
to protect the innocence?¶

35
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,720
It’s really a shame,

36
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,440
a great shame for us,

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,720
when we find in this world

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
that innocence is under attack.

39
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,120
Anything else can be tolerated.

40
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,680
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

41
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,480
those who have no malice,

42
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:09,720
who are living like little children, I should say,

43
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,840
if they are attacked by anyone,

44
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,960
- not that the whole world reacts to that –

45
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,720
but every one of them

46
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,560
cannot bear any innocent person

47
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,280
or ‘innocent being’ being harmed.¶

48
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,480
We don’t realise that within us

49
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,760
there is the ocean of love

50
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,360
and ocean of understanding for children.

51
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,480
Why? Why should it be?

52
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,440
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

53
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,480
Especially for innocence?

54
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,480
There are people

55
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,240
who are always attacking innocent people,

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,480
innocent children, there are.

57
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,680
But no-one wants to support them.

58
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,000
No-one thinks that it’s proper to ill-treat children.

59
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,600
And those who have done this have to suffer.

60
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,400
They all suffer as a reaction.¶

61
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,520
What is it within us

62
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,000
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

63
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,320
against innocence?

64
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,040
For example if there is a regular war,

65
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,840
and if there are people fighting;

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,480
in a regular war, they don’t have much sympathy.

67
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,760
In the world also, they say “Alright,

68
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,120
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

69
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,480
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

70
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,320
That’s what human beings have.

71
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,120
Within themselves they have the power,

72
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,880
power of Shri Ganesha,

73
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:46,960
which gives you that feeling, that capacity,

74
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:55,640
that understanding that you have to protect innocent,

75
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,840
innocent children, innocent people.

76
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,080
And the whole world can rise against all such people

77
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,480
who are trying to kill the innocent.

78
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,920
There cannot be any doubt.

79
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,840
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

80
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,680
or criticize such a thing,

81
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,080
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.¶

82
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:41,920
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

83
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,240
and can give up anything,

84
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,400
but they cannot give up the feeling they have for innocence.

85
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,600
It’s very remarkable.

86
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:02,000
We don’t realize how much there is this ocean

87
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,320
of protection and love for the innocent.

88
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,000
What attracts the greatest strength

89
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,960
is when we see an innocent person,

90
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,600
innocent children, are under attack.

91
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,400
That’s the beauty of human beings.

92
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,920
Of course there are many human beings, who can be cruel,

93
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,520
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

94
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:44,600
But when it comes to children, and to innocent people,

95
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,320
everyone feels his responsibility.¶

96
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,680
It’s difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

97
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:07,480
because they have a kind of an understanding

98
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,280
that they are something great,

99
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,040
that they understand everything,

100
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,120
that they can analyze everything,

101
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,400
and they could be crooks,

102
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,400
they could be aggressive,

103
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,240
they could be troublesome,

104
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,800
they could be anything,

105
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,320
and they can give explanation for that, doesn’t matter –

106
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,160
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

107
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,840
and they can never be honored

108
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,400
for the thing they are doing.¶

109
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,080
For us, the Sahaja Yogi, the Sahaj culture is

110
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,080
to respect your innocence.

111
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,680
You might feel a little bit cheated,

112
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,600
you might feel a little bit dominated,

113
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,480
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

114
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,320
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

115
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,160
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

116
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,600
They should not feel dejected if they are being used,

117
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:28,400
insulted, tortured, dominated, it’s alright.

118
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,520
They should not try to destroy

119
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,680
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

120
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,360
Automatically it will work.

121
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:48,840
You will be amazed that when innocence is challenged,

122
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,880
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.¶

123
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,640
An example of this is the recent war,

124
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,440
so-called war, of America.

125
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,800
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong –

126
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,600
have been tortured, have been killed.

127
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,760
At that time, all over the world,

128
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,720
it’s a big support for them.

129
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,840
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

130
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:43,240
is anxious to look after those who have done this crime.

131
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,680
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

132
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,000
they may not be belonging to the same country,

133
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,240
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

134
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,760
but at this moment,

135
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,160
who does not take the side of the innocence

136
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,800
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

137
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,320
Once for all they will learn a lesson

138
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,480
that ‘you cannot attack innocent people’.¶

139
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,400
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

140
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,280
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

141
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,720
We should not, in no way punish them.

142
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,400
Our main achievement

143
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,080
should be that loving attention for children.

144
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,760
All over the world,

145
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,560
whether he belongs to your family or to some other family,

146
00:12:50,720 --> 00:13:02,680
or has some sort of detached attention with you,

147
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,680
still because he’s a child, he’s innocent,

148
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,600
the innocence within itself,

149
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,760
your own innocence, will try to protect.¶

150
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,880
It’s very surprising

151
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,480
how people take to sacrificing their lives

152
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:34,600
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

153
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,200
Children should never be attacked.

154
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,960
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

155
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,040
But you shouldn’t waste your energy on something

156
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,120
that is extremely inauspicious,

157
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,160
extremely cruel

158
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,200
and extremely ugly.¶

159
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,360
If you cannot love children,

160
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,000
you cannot love anything.

161
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,840
I have not come across anyone so far who says

162
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,120
that they don’t love children – luckily!

163
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,920
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”.

164
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,240
Why? Why do you love flowers?

165
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Because they are innocent.

166
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,720
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

167
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,720
You love nature – why?

168
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,640
Because it is innocent.

169
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,080
But the greatest innocence

170
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:48,360
is seen among human beings who are Sahaja Yogi!¶
