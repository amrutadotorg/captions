1
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:11,929
Yogi: In the year 1947, P.K. Salve was a
Member of the Central Legislative Assembly
at Delhi,

2
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:16,737
while Nirmala was studying in Her 4th year
of Medicine, at Lahore. It was at this

3
00:00:16,737 --> 00:00:21,062
juncture that a tall, young man was
introduced into the Salve household.

4
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:27,383
His name was Chandrika Prasad Shrivastav.
Chandrika Prasad Shrivastav was a college

5
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:33,024
friend of Nirmala's older brother Narendra
Kumar Salve. He was temporarily working

6
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:37,356
for the Ministry of Commerce in Delhi and
needed a place to stay for a few days.

7
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:41,829
Narendra Kumar invited him to stay as a
house guest at the Feroze Shah Road house

8
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:46,350
and C.P. Shrivastav accepted the invitation.
Little did he know, that this was a move,

9
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,664
that would change his life in such a significant
manner. He soon became very popular in the

10
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:58,785
large Salve family, both among the elders
and the young. It was natural therefore,

11
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:03,265
for Narendra Kumar to think of him as a
suitable match for his sister, Nirmala.

12
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:10,073
Shri Mataji: In our country, in those days, there
was no choice, nothing. Whatever parents said,

13
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:16,558
you had to listen. So, according to the
choice of My parents, they selected him.

14
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:24,201
He was a friend of My brother and My brother
said, "He's a very nice person, this, that,"

15
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:28,814
so they married Me to him; That's what
it is.

16
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:35,664
Yogi: On the 7th of April 1947, Nirmala Salve
and C.P. Shrivastav were married in a simple

17
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:41,239
civil ceremony. It was a unique marriage
from all angles.

18
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:44,892
There was hardly anything common between
the two.

19
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:52,771
Sir C.P. Shrivastav: This was a situation of a very
remarkable kind. I came, as I told you, from a,

20
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:59,528
from old families, conservative families,
pro-establishment families, you know and

21
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:06,996
holders and She was a family, fighting
the British - totally on the other side,

22
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:13,934
so it was a totally different background.
My background was totally different and

23
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:23,700
I was from UP but that particular community,
She belonged them of another community,

24
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,903
as you know, so there was nothing common
between us, as far as heritage goes.

25
00:02:30,903 --> 00:02:35,937
Yogi: But despite the regional, cultural and
linguistic differences, there was a very

26
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:42,662
strong common point that they both shared
- their love for their country, their love for India.

27
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:53,307
And soon, they both saw their biggest dream come
true - the dream of seeing India as a free nation.

28
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:58,384
Sir C.P. Shrivastav: On 15th August, we were
together standing with the whole family, Salve

29
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:06,367
family, in front of the Secretariat, watching
the Union flag going down and the Indian
flag going up -

30
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:13,170
India becoming independent. So we together,
which we wanted very much, saw India rising.

31
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,349
Yogi: In the early years of Her marriage, Nirmala
Salve lived like a normal housewife, with

32
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:25,196
Her extraordinary husband. They soon had
two lovely daughters, Kalpana and Sadhana

33
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:33,422
and Nirmala's life was woven around their
upbringing and education. Wherever he went

34
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:38,314
as an officer of the prestigious Indian
Administrative Service, Mr. C.P. Shrivastav

35
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:43,563
distinguished himself with his extreme
efficiency, honesty and academic brilliance.

36
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:50,511
Shri Mataji was right besides C.P. Shrivastav
in all the ups and downs of his high office.

37
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:56,165
She was no silent housewife, in fact She took
active interest in the affairs of the state

38
00:03:56,165 --> 00:04:00,686
and was part of many a discussion, which 
eventually shaped the National policy.

39
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:06,161
The Tashkent Agreement was a high point in
the diplomatic life of Mr. C.P. Shrivastav.

40
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:15,116
However, the untimely death of the Prime
Minister, while still at Tashkent, was like

41
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:20,438
a bolt from the blue and was a huge loss to
the nation. For Mr. C.P. Shrivastav and his

42
00:04:20,438 --> 00:04:27,222
family, it was a great personal loss. Soon
afterwards, Mr. C.P. Shrivastav was made

43
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:31,801
The Chairman and Managing Director of The
Shipping Corporation of India and the whole

44
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:37,291
family shifted to Bombay. Here too, he
excelled beyond all expectations and was

45
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:42,640
lauded universally for making SCI the
largest Public Sector Company in India, in

46
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:50,225
the shortest possible time. In the meanwhile,
Shri Mataji was readying Herself for a much

47
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:55,876
larger role in the world. Both Her daughters
were, more or less, settled in life and

48
00:04:55,876 --> 00:05:01,409
She was now in a position to give more
time to Her deepest interest, Spirituality.

49
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:07,936
Until now, She had been an excellent wife
and a loving Mother but it was time to

50
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:13,717
fulfill Her true destiny, it was time to
become the Loving Mother to the whole world.
