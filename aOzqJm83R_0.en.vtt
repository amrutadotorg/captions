WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:07.696
The most precious thing that
we have, within ourselves…

00:09.052 --> 00:18.337
the preciousness of your spirit is immeasurable

00:19.044 --> 00:24.663
and that’s why it is called,
as a thing of eternal value.

00:24.688 --> 00:27.955
Because it is infinite.

00:27.980 --> 00:30.697
You cannot measure.

00:38.912 --> 00:57.427
Now, God, The Almighty, we say, is, Sat-Chit-Anand.

00:59.297 --> 01:04.127
Sat means, the truth.

01:04.702 --> 01:12.699
The truth we understand, in human terminology, is relative.

01:12.771 --> 01:19.427
But the Sat I am telling you, is the absolute,

01:19.452 --> 01:24.273
from where all the relations start.

01:24.953 --> 01:29.653
Example I will tell you how to understand.

01:33.335 --> 01:46.130
This Earth has got, oceans, and rivers,

01:46.789 --> 01:55.027
and all kinds, of, waters you can say.

01:58.912 --> 02:05.041
But, Earth is enveloping all of them.

02:10.267 --> 02:14.432
If, the Mother Earth was not there,

02:14.457 --> 02:25.030
there could not have been, any of these existing.

02:26.943 --> 02:34.980
So, we can say, that Mother Earth is the support,

02:35.574 --> 02:39.486
of all the things that exist on Her.

02:40.699 --> 02:47.287
She is enveloping us… in the atoms She exists…

02:48.319 --> 02:51.525
in the big mountains She exists,

02:51.550 --> 02:56.650
because the elements are part, of that Earth.

02:59.935 --> 03:08.086
In the same way, God Almighty,
the Sat part of Him,

03:08.341 --> 03:17.488
the truth, is the support, of all the things,

03:17.988 --> 03:21.794
that are created, or not created.

03:21.953 --> 03:26.888
Another example you try to understand.

03:27.361 --> 03:34.343
How, the Sat, is the purusha [–man -ed.], is the God,

03:34.359 --> 03:40.700
who does not, take actual part in the creation itself,

03:40.811 --> 03:45.073
but, is a catalyst.

03:45.487 --> 03:51.853
The example can be like this, that
I am doing all the work,

03:51.886 --> 03:57.508
I am creating everything, but I have a light in my hand.

03:57.533 --> 04:00.928
Without the light, I cannot do anything.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.650
Light is the support of my work.

04:05.326 --> 04:09.609
But, the light, does not, in any way,

04:10.244 --> 04:13.448
do anything about what I do.

04:13.722 --> 04:22.109
In the same way, God Almighty,
is just a witness, like a light.

04:23.780 --> 04:29.504
But His another quality
is His chitta, is His attention.

04:30.331 --> 04:38.780
When it is excited, in Sanskrit,
there is a very good word, sphuran,

04:39.225 --> 04:49.169
is pulsates, when it pulsates
His attention  when it pulsates,

04:50.953 --> 04:56.767
then through His attention, He starts creating.

04:58.790 --> 05:07.191
And he has third quality, which we call as Anand.

05:07.725 --> 05:14.358
Anand is the feeling, of joy

05:14.383 --> 05:21.692
that He gets by His perception, by His creation.

05:21.717 --> 05:24.329
The joy that He gets.

05:24.354 --> 05:31.512
All these three things, when they are
at a zero point, where they meet,

05:32.694 --> 05:38.654
then, they become, the principle of Brahma,

05:39.377 --> 05:42.591
where these things are one.

05:42.710 --> 05:46.743
Where there is complete silence.

05:46.768 --> 05:51.935
Nothing is created, nothing is manifested,

05:53.650 --> 05:59.554
but the joy is one with the attention,

06:00.916 --> 06:06.365
because, attention has reached and merged into joy,

06:07.580 --> 06:13.214
and joy has become one with the truth.

06:16.792 --> 06:28.459
This, combination, of three qualities, separate,

06:29.539 --> 06:37.408
and create three types of phenomena.

06:39.416 --> 06:59.211
The Anand, the joy, in God, moves with His
creation, and with the truth.

07:03.008 --> 07:11.344
When the joy starts moving with the creation,

07:12.146 --> 07:17.432
the creation starts moving down from first,

07:17.457 --> 07:20.583
the truth stage  to asat [–untruth -ed.].

07:20.608 --> 07:28.608
From Sat to untruth, to maya, to illusion.

07:29.714 --> 07:37.384
And that time, the creation starts, on the
right hand side.

07:37.519 --> 07:40.952
The creative forces start working out,

07:40.977 --> 07:44.530
and when it starts working out, the joy in it,

07:44.555 --> 07:49.057
which is on the left hand side,
is the emotional side of God,

07:49.082 --> 07:55.226
also starts becoming grosser and grosser.

07:55.251 --> 07:57.968
The creation starts becoming grosser,

07:57.992 --> 08:00.916
and the joy in it also starts becoming grosser,

08:00.941 --> 08:08.780
and the Sat, the light of God, also starts
becoming grosser and grosser, and grosser,

08:08.780 --> 08:18.129
till they reach a stage, where there is, we
can say, a complete darkness of tamoguna,

08:18.605 --> 08:31.425
the complete creation of the creativity, and
the complete sleeping of the joy limit, exists.

08:32.989 --> 08:34.625
Clearer?

08:34.650 --> 08:38.422
Do you understand now Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati?

08:39.581 --> 08:44.085
That’s why Christ he said, I am the light.

08:45.252 --> 08:50.007
Because, He represents the Sat,
the light of God,

08:50.586 --> 09:00.437
and light of God becomes absolutely,
gross, dormant, dead,

09:00.462 --> 09:04.422
when it reaches the seventh stage of creation.

09:04.747 --> 09:11.684
All these things go deeper and deeper, becoming
grosser, and grosser.

09:12.779 --> 09:16.330
That’s one part of the parabolic.

09:16.880 --> 09:24.028
Now, the another part of the parabolic starts
when you are ascending back to God Almighty.

09:24.333 --> 09:29.132
That grossness, now, gradually starts becoming

09:29.156 --> 09:36.001
higher, and higher, subtler and subtler, and, finer and finer.

09:37.434 --> 09:49.125
In that refinement, you find, ultimately the
light, works for the evolutionary process.

09:49.339 --> 09:55.565
Gradually, the grosser parts start becoming
enlightened.

09:55.590 --> 10:01.235
You find the lower animal is not that much
enlightened as the higher animal is.

10:01.326 --> 10:12.536
Gradually, even the joy starts becoming subtler,
and we can call it, beautiful.

10:13.115 --> 10:20.325
Human joys are much more beautiful than that
of animals.

10:21.746 --> 10:30.959
So, the joys also start changing their manifestation,
in the sense you start seeing more

10:30.984 --> 10:34.834
and more and wider range of joy comes into your hand.

10:35.128 --> 10:45.195
For example, to a dog, beauty has no meaning,
decency has no meaning.

10:46.115 --> 10:54.639
So, at a stage when you reach, when you
are a human being, to that extent, you develop,

10:54.664 --> 11:08.396
you are Sat, which is awareness, to that extent,
you also develop, your joy,

11:11.015 --> 11:16.876
and to that extent, you also
develop your creative action.

11:17.206 --> 11:25.304
Now you see, how the creativity of God, passes
into the hand of man…

11:27.090 --> 11:30.082
when it turns down.

11:31.585 --> 11:36.277
How the joy of God passes into the hand of man,

11:36.475 --> 11:44.376
and how His light comes into the heart of man, as Spirit.

11:44.510 --> 11:46.868
Its beautiful.

11:47.201 --> 11:52.029
And at that stage, when
you have become a human being,

11:52.807 --> 11:56.200
people say, human beings have a soul.

11:56.394 --> 12:03.610
Not that others do not have, but the light
starts burning in a human being only.

12:03.809 --> 12:08.496
Because of that light,
we talk of religion, we talk of God,

12:08.584 --> 12:12.258
and we talk of eternal things.

12:14.765 --> 12:20.969
But, its a very precarious stage,
that is to be human beings.

12:20.994 --> 12:27.095
Because at this stage, you have to
jump only a little bit that side,

12:27.182 --> 12:30.006
while you start jumping this side and that side,

12:30.031 --> 12:35.350
because this jumping
is not possible, unless and until, the awareness

12:35.375 --> 12:41.565
reaches that stage, where, you become independent,

12:41.590 --> 12:48.945
and, in that independence, you find your own glory.

12:50.586 --> 12:59.058
This is the position, because your glory cannot
be yours, unless and until you are independent.

13:00.050 --> 13:10.620
As long as you are slaves, or under bondage,
of something that is gross,

13:10.645 --> 13:21.171
how can you enjoy, that eternal joy, that is within you.

13:21.798 --> 13:27.865
So, it is for you to expose yourself more
to that joy,

13:28.699 --> 13:34.573
by opening out yourself more and more,

13:34.771 --> 13:46.560
getting subtler, and cleaner, so
that you feel that joy.

13:50.666 --> 13:58.479
Once, you know this point, that,

14:01.186 --> 14:07.233
after getting Self-realization,
unless and until these three things,

14:07.258 --> 14:19.718
start merging together, you cannot
feel, that you have established yourself.

14:20.077 --> 14:31.707
The joy within you, must be felt through your
awareness, otherwise you cannot feel it.

14:32.162 --> 14:36.222
Supposing you had no eyes, how can you see.

14:37.222 --> 14:42.230
If you were not aware to see Me, how will
you feel Me.

14:42.758 --> 14:47.874
If you are not aware to feel Me, how can you
see Me.

14:49.413 --> 14:56.765
If you are not aware to hear Me, how can you
understand Me.

14:57.723 --> 15:06.497
And once that awareness comes to you, then
only, the joy awakens within you,

15:06.522 --> 15:15.964
because, only through these subtle feelings of
awareness, you are going to absorb the joy.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.773
As just now you felt it when you said

15:18.798 --> 15:21.606
“oh, what a beautiful thing it is”, you felt very happy.

15:21.631 --> 15:26.418
You are feeling the joy of this creation that
is there.

15:27.099 --> 15:31.066
And man is the summit of creation.

15:32.558 --> 15:41.884
But, only the crowning part is such a little
thing, very little it is, its a very little distance,

15:42.210 --> 15:48.389
it crosses in no time, but only
thing is, that these three things,

15:48.414 --> 15:50.611
have to be combined.

15:50.636 --> 15:57.064
And that’s why I find, that,
even you get realization,

15:57.263 --> 15:59.929
you do not feel the silence,

15:59.954 --> 16:02.799
because you have not become the light.

16:02.824 --> 16:07.208
You do not feel the joy, because
you have not become the Anand,

16:07.233 --> 16:09.589
that is the left side of yourself.

16:09.589 --> 16:11.944
In every thing there is joy.

16:11.969 --> 16:16.685
As human beings you start seeing joys, in
the patterns.

16:16.710 --> 16:22.924
You see a tree bark, you open it out, you
see the patterns, you call it the veneer

16:22.949 --> 16:29.690
you call it the roughness,
and the smoothness, and the harmony of it,

16:29.690 --> 16:35.137
you start seeing in the matter,
the joy of its creation.

16:35.162 --> 16:44.614
But now, after realization,
you start feeling the joy of creation,

16:45.416 --> 16:49.795
this summit of creation, is the human being.

16:51.827 --> 16:55.524
And thats why for a Sahaja Yogi, he must realize,

16:55.588 --> 17:00.630
that if he tries to be, say, friendly,

17:00.655 --> 17:06.511
or interested, or involved in a person,
who is at a lower level,

17:06.536 --> 17:10.122
he can never get joy from that person.

17:10.147 --> 17:15.446
Only thing what he can do is to raise that
person higher to his own level,

17:15.471 --> 17:19.895
and make him also feel the same joy as you are getting.

17:19.920 --> 17:27.720
Supposing a man, who is an artist, marries
a blind girl, whats the use.

17:28.052 --> 17:31.891
She cannot enjoy the art created by this man.

17:32.304 --> 17:37.375
In the same way, if you, are interested in
say, your family people,

17:37.400 --> 17:41.855
in your relations, in your friends,
the first thing, and the highest,

17:41.880 --> 17:45.115
and the greatest thing that you can give,

17:45.140 --> 17:53.039
is to give them Self-realization, means,
the joy of your Spirit.

17:53.039 --> 18:00.005
Expose them to the joy of their Spirit, which
is the most precious.

18:02.926 --> 18:07.002
And this is the reason why people flicker,

18:07.042 --> 18:10.342
and they… they fidget, and they feel uneasy.

18:10.367 --> 18:18.440
They… they lose their joy, very easily,
at a small thing, that has passed away, finished.

18:19.236 --> 18:24.244
Its like the ocean before you, and I am there,

18:24.269 --> 18:28.765
and I want you all to come into it, and enjoy.

18:28.790 --> 18:34.741
It is all for you, the whole thing was created,
for your enjoyment.

18:37.512 --> 18:41.460
You have to become subtler, and subtler.

18:41.485 --> 18:45.934
You are wasting lot of time here, on very gross things,

18:45.969 --> 18:50.386
you have noticed it.
