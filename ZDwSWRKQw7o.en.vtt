00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.960
Then there's Victoria, Felicity, Hinge and Alan Morrissey. Yes, so we can start with

2
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:23.200
Meera. So she's been on the marriage committee for so long and she has so many experiences

3
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:34.560
with Shrimati ji that she can tell us a lot about. Can you hear me? Yeah. Can you hear

4
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:44.200
me well? Yes. Okay. First of all, thank you very much for being again, in this beautiful

5
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:53.960
group to share with you all our experiences. And first of all, I would like to have a request

6
00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:03.880
because IMC is collecting stories and happenings about marriages, how it was in earlier times,

7
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:13.080
which Shrimati ji and everyone maybe could send me their stories because we are going to have

8
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:23.160
a booklet for the 100 years of anniversary of Shrimati ji. So this is our plan. So we need all

9
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:31.720
your beautiful stories, which we can use, of course, not those which is not possible to use.

10
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:41.000
So that would be my request. And maybe I will send an email address from IMC for these collections,

11
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.320
if that would be possible. That would be great. Also, you are welcome.

12
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.440
I'm waiting. We are very happy to share. We had already a great session

13
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.240
recently about marriage testimonies. There was a wonderful evening a few months ago. So for my,

14
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:16.040
what I can say today, I was asked about my experiences with Shrimati ji by preparing

15
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:26.040
for the marriages. And I tried to write together because it was really a very special moment.

16
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:39.160
And it was in late summer in 2000. And I was in the castle and worked there as usual, but it was

17
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:47.160
my duty. So many things. I lived that time in in Chantrasi. And it happened a few days before

18
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:56.280
I just went out of the kitchen and suddenly Yogi Mahajan arrived. And he was in charge for

19
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.440
marriages in India and also in Kavella for a few years. And he just asked me for a cup of tea.

20
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.400
So then I went, prepared for him the tea, and then we were sitting there. And then he was talking

21
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:20.920
about the work, what has to be done for the upcoming marriages. And then he asked me to

22
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:30.120
help him. And I didn't know much what to do because the preparation were not like today.

23
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.800
So there were some applications and mostly ladies from the ashram in the castle prepared everything.

24
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:48.840
So I don't remember that we have list registrations like today. And also not so many,

25
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.800
maybe 50, maximum 60 applications were there compared to the six, seven hundreds.

26
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:06.200
And that was not that big work that time. And then he asked me to help with the work.

27
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.760
And of course, it was an honour to me. And also a challenge because I had to work

28
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:26.520
with the mother chief in that days. And yeah, there were also some folders with applications.

29
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:40.040
And we were sitting in a room in an opera office in the castle. And he asked me just to give him a

30
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:49.000
boy or an application from a boy or a girl age wise. And I just remember I just went to the

31
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.360
folders and pick up, picked out the girl and then other one, a boy. And then I gave it to him.

32
00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:04.120
And it was very interesting to me to see how the vibration work went on. And he just went

33
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:11.160
into meditation with both of forms. And then sometimes he asked, okay, for another one.

34
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.120
And then he went to Shri Mataji. She was just sitting in a room nearby.

35
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:27.720
And but it was everything very, very quiet, very, very deep, very, it was a huge vibration work.

36
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.600
But no one else were there. I don't remember only Shri Mataji, Yogi Mahajan and me.

37
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:42.120
And so then he went to Shri Mataji with the applications. Shri Mataji took both of them.

38
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:53.000
And she just observed the photos mostly. She was just watching the yogis. She was not much

39
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.960
interested what they are doing, what the height is. And then sometimes she said, okay, give me

40
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:09.800
another girl. So I was running back, took another girl application, Gavi to Shri Mataji.

41
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:17.160
And then she just said, okay, it's a match. Or she said, it's done. Or she said,

42
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:25.160
give me another boy or give me another girl. So like, so the work went on and on three days long.

43
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:36.200
And I just remember I was, I was not on earth, I think it was so much work, but

44
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:46.840
I didn't feel tired somehow. Three days I didn't, didn't sleep. And I don't remember if I eat

45
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:53.800
something in Shri Mataji as well. She was just sitting there and worked very, very hard.

46
00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:04.200
And yeah, so that was the beginning of the work. And sometimes later on I helped in Genoa also

47
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:16.920
with the applications. And then the main work started in 2011 when the IMC was founded by the

48
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:25.480
by the CC actually. Mostly Gregor was very, very much interested that we have this group

49
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:34.520
all together. And yeah, so these days it's a little bit different because we have so many

50
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.760
applications from all over the world. We are around 16 Octave members.

51
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:50.200
And this year even, even we managed online to take vibrations six days long.

52
00:07:52.200 --> 00:08:00.600
Also for an early morning till in the night. And what is nice is this time we have

53
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:09.560
a much higher agreement of the matches. So this is also very good, even in India. So we have

54
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:19.160
so we have more than 70% who were agreed with the matches. And of course we had a tremendous

55
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:26.920
weekend. Krishna Puja with the marriages last week. So what to say more?

56
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.880
If someone has a question. Yes, it was such a joyful experience watching

57
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:44.600
online. Continue with this tradition of broadcasting. This is so wonderful. And we all

58
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:54.440
felt so one, the sense of oneness we could feel. It was amazing. It was incredible because we have

59
00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:03.400
many, many, you were shocked this, I mean, born children, I mean, growing up, who got married and

60
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:12.280
that was very, very special. So to see them also to match them. So this work was also incredible.

61
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:21.880
We just saw, oh, this boy, oh, this girl and vibration were just shutting and it's working.

62
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:28.360
It works. So it was actually easy, easy to do work this year. Yeah.

63
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.320
They were so perfect. This matches, they were really perfect.

64
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.480
I know quite a few of the Uvists who I've known since they were babies.

65
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:51.640
Yeah. It's just so perfect. I just can't really describe how beautiful it was

66
00:09:52.200 --> 00:10:00.120
to see them actually perfect matches. I mean, this year, I guess we had many,

67
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:07.320
many and what other most beautiful is if you see marriages from previous years and now we have so

68
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:16.280
many babies, you know, walking or just born and it's incredible. I don't know. We just see babies

69
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:24.920
in Cabela. So this is the other nice, nice part. So we hope very much we can continue and that

70
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:35.080
these work will be always, always very auspicious for, for the Sangha. And yeah, we are just,

71
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:42.360
it's a, it's a beautiful team. Also each of them, we are friends, sisters, family, we are sometimes

72
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:49.320
talking, meditating. Also, if someone has a problem, we share together. It's, it's incredible

73
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:55.800
deepness between the members also. I mean, after 10 years work also almost all of us

74
00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:03.400
are there since long time and also worked with Shri Mataji, of course, more than me, probably,

75
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:12.280
of course, Mr. Nagikar and, and others. So it's, I love it. We missed her this year.

76
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.400
She was, she could not come this year. Yeah. She couldn't come, but I mean,

77
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.640
she completely loves the, the, the group, you know, she says it's just amazing.

78
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:29.240
We love each other very much. I have to say, so this makes more easier to, because we are one. So

79
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.640
if you have ever worked and you, you have a oneness, then that's the most beautiful. So

80
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:42.040
I would say this group is probably the most beautiful in Sahaj maybe also others,

81
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:55.240
but this group is, is excellent. And please, please send, send me the, the stories, what you

82
00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:03.800
have, especially from earlier time, we try to, to make him in a chronological way, how the marriage

83
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:10.520
started and how, how many stories are there just to share and joy. We have some already

84
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.360
and yeah, that would be great. Maybe I will write in the chat, the email address.

85
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:28.840
If you, thank you, Meera, about the marriage committee, how it came into being very nice.

86
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:40.120
Very nice. Yes. Thank you. And congratulations to you also. Okay. So next we have,

87
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:48.840
who will go next Felicity? I think you might be one of the earliest marriages.

88
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:56.040
Yes, it's interesting you, you were asking Meera. So I just first wanted to say,

89
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:04.440
because our son got married this weekend at Krishna Puja. And I just, I was trying to say to

90
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.680
Victoria, thank you really so much. We weren't able to be there, any of the family at all,

91
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:20.440
it was so beautiful to see how loved and taken care of he was. And they all were the, the couples.

92
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:28.200
And we had such a strong sense of family of Sahaj family through watching the whole marriages

93
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:34.360
online. And I wanted to thank the marriage committee for all the hard work and everything

94
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:41.000
that they've done to bring about such a joyful occasion. And I had never seen him. I saw photos.

95
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.720
I've never seen him, not just happy, so joyful was just, and it reminds, so it reminded us,

96
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:54.280
my husband and I, of when we got married, because when we got married in 1982, we got married in

97
00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:02.120
India and we had no family there, no family. And we were all married. And we were all married.

98
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:10.440
And we had no family there. Nobody had Sahaj family then. And so it was a similar experience

99
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:20.200
for him. So when we got married, Oh, I lost you all. Wait a minute. Sorry. Yeah, I keep getting

100
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:34.200
messages. I was trying to anyway. So we, before so I came into Sahaj Yoga in 79, in 80, there was

101
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:40.440
one Dawn and Anthony were the first Tony with the first marriage and then Maureen. And then I think

102
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.560
Gresham will remember dates better, but 81 was when she started having more collective

103
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:54.760
weddings, collective marriages. And we got married in 82 and it was the first collective marriages

104
00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:01.400
in Delhi, in India. And there were 12 couples, but it was a very different situation.

105
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:10.600
We were on tour. There were about, I think, 84 Yogis on tour, a lot of Australians. And

106
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:17.640
suddenly we were on the tour with Shrimataji and we were sitting somewhere listening with her.

107
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:24.200
And she suddenly said, and where's the marriage list? Pull out the marriage list. And on this,

108
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:31.800
she, no, she said, everybody who's on the marriage list, please stand up. So there were about 27

109
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:38.440
people on the marriage list. We sent, we just sent in our names, put in our names. They all stood up

110
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.880
mother saw where they were. And we all sat down again. And then she started to proceed to talk

111
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:53.320
about each person and many of them she'd never physically met before, but each person, she said,

112
00:15:53.320 --> 00:16:00.840
some really good quality about them. And if there was something, some weakness, she also shared

113
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:08.360
that. So it was very, very open. Everything was upfront. And she was basically introducing

114
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:14.520
all the people on the marriage list to the collective and to, to them, to everyone else

115
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:20.280
on the marriage list. And we actually have a recording somewhere somewhere where we recorded

116
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:27.480
this, this on tape. And then she said, and when everyone had, she'd spoken about everyone, she

117
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:33.320
said, and now I want you to go away and put down on a piece of paper who you would like to marry.

118
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:41.320
So we just went, what, what, you know, I was like, no, no, this is not my, you know, I'm waiting for

119
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.800
mother mother to tell me who to marry. You know, so this was really, she said, three people, you

120
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:52.600
put down three names and then you, you, you bring the pieces of paper, you know? So for me, I went

121
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.400
away and I thought, ah, I can't choose. I know only by that, you know, I'd have different

122
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:04.040
experiences to this point, knowing that only she could know the right person for me because she

123
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:12.120
knows everything. Anyway, I, I sort of went through, so I had to sit and think about all the men on the

124
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:19.320
list because mother said that. And I picked out two or three people that I knew didn't quite feel

125
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:26.360
right. And the one person, when my attention went to my future husband and I just went, no, we're

126
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.960
totally unsuited. I didn't even think any more about him. It was just like, no, I'd had a couple

127
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:38.040
of conversations. I thought we're totally opposite. No, that's not going to work. So imagine my shock.

128
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:43.400
I got a little bit nervous the next day. So everything is, you know, mother's, I guess we

129
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:49.400
didn't hear anything. And then the next day my husband, Richard tells the story that Warren was

130
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.880
running backwards and forwards from mother's house to the camp and talking to people and talking and

131
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.720
then going backwards and forwards. So like, he would be talking to saying, you know, oh, well,

132
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:03.560
I really would accept this match that, you know, this match has been been made. And, and I just

133
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:09.240
suddenly got cold feet and I went to him and I said, oh, I, I don't, I can't do this. You'll have

134
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.720
to take my name off the list. I'm not ready. And he went, oh really mother's found a match for you.

135
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:22.360
So I went, okay, who is it? And he said, Richard. So I was just like, Richard, you know,

136
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.960
so I, I sort of, I must've gone away and thought about it. And then I came back to him and I said,

137
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.600
is mother happy about the match? And he said, yes, yes, she's very happy about the match.

138
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:40.520
So then I just said, okay, that's, that's if this is the match, you know, and once I accepted

139
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:49.000
and surrendered to it, then it was like, she showed me inside myself, why this is a good match,

140
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.360
you know? And, and I could see, I remember, and we were, ah, so we weren't allowed to talk to

141
00:18:54.360 --> 00:19:00.360
each other for more than two minutes each day. So we had the matches, the matches came together

142
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:06.280
very quickly. Six of them were rematches. Six of them were people who were already married,

143
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:11.160
had come into Sahaja Yoga married and had asked for a remarriage. And there were only

144
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:20.440
six other matches that, that came together. And it was 10 days from that point of engagement

145
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:26.040
to when we actually went to Delhi and had the marriage ceremonies in Delhi.

146
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.000
I can't remember if we each had individual, but I think we did have individual fires.

147
00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:39.320
And, but she said to us, you only can speak two minutes each day. And I'm sure this was just so

148
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:45.720
that our egos and our superegoes didn't come up and start judging each other. So I remember

149
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.840
standing in the line, the dinner line. So I thought, okay, we can't talk, but we can be

150
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:56.120
together. So it was very sweet. So I can remember standing with him in the dinner line and you

151
00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:02.920
really have a sense of, of the spirit of the person. And you don't have any complications

152
00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:09.320
from conversations or talking, you just feel the spirit of the person. And I suddenly had

153
00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:16.520
felt mother inside me say, see, you are two halves of the same coin. He is the same coin.

154
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:23.480
And together you make, you make, you know, the one coin. And then I felt her say inside

155
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:29.640
at the same time that she said, I felt her say to me, you are very different on the outside,

156
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:36.920
but inside you share the same values. The deep things are the same. And over the years,

157
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.360
the outside things will all be the same. And I felt her say to me, you are very different on the

158
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:49.720
outside. And over the years, the outside things will all smooth away and melt away. And gradually

159
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:55.560
you will become more in the center together and then you will just enjoy. And, and the actually,

160
00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:01.400
and that is what happened. So, so it was, it was very sweet. And I just add one little other thing.

161
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:10.520
So the saris for the marriages, Sumadachi had ordered somebody to, had, had arranged for someone

162
00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:17.880
and we were all invited down into this, where this table was laid out with wedding saris.

163
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:24.680
And all the brides were invited to come down and choose a sari. And my friend Pamela was there.

164
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:32.600
She also got married that year to a Swiss at the time. And she found this amazing sari. It was

165
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:39.000
completely multicolored, like filled with gold and silver and colors of the rainbow.

166
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:45.400
And she came to me and she, and all the other saris were fairly subdued, you know, reds and

167
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:51.000
greens. There were some pinks, typical. And she came and she said to me, Oh, what do you think?

168
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.760
You know, I went, Oh, Pamela, I think this is a bit much, you know, it's a bit loud.

169
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.880
She said, I really like it. I really like it. So she held onto this sari.

170
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:06.920
And I couldn't choose. And people said to me, Oh, you should take this pink one. So I got it,

171
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.640
picked up a pink one. And then we were standing in a line and Srimadaji was there. And she had

172
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:17.880
each bride come up to her holding the sari with the sari they had. So my friend Pamela was in

173
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.760
front of me. So she got to Srimadaji and my mother went, no, no, no, not this sari and put it down.

174
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.640
And my ego must have thought, Oh yeah, yeah, right. You know, and she picked out a different

175
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.680
one, a very lovely green one for her. And then it was my turn. And I went up and I,

176
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.520
I felt this pink one was too much associated with left side and stuff. And she said, no, no,

177
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:45.160
not this one. And she picked up the multicolored one and she gave it to me and she said,

178
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:54.040
do you like it? And I just kind of went, yes, mother. Yes. I went gulp, of course, you know,

179
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.400
and you're just sort of reprocessing and adjusting, you know, and I went, was, you know,

180
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:05.640
mother's a wonderful joke, you know, and how she breaks down your conditionings and ideas.

181
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:12.280
And it was an amazing sari for me because there was nothing from my past or my being that could

182
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:18.920
identify in any way with this sari. And it was like being given a completely new joyful skin,

183
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:25.080
you know, just an incredible sari. So it was such, such sweet, you know, those experiences

184
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:31.160
of being with Shomataji. We were so blessed to see her incredible attention to the detail,

185
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:37.720
to the smallest things, how she knew us, you know, through and through. She knows all of us,

186
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:44.840
you know, through and through. And so that, that was part of our experience. And we,

187
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.640
we got married in Delhi. We had a little, we did have the Gauri poocher. I remember

188
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:59.720
coming out. We didn't have the big sheet like you have now. We were given the garlands as we came

189
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:05.240
out of the room where we'd been having the pooch with Shomataji. She gave us the garland.

190
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:14.120
She gave the brides the garland, and we then came out and met our future husband and garlanded them

191
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:20.360
and started the ceremony. Meanwhile, I shouldn't forget to say the grooms arrived on horses.

192
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:29.320
As is traditional in India, they found 12, no 11, they only could find 11 horses for 12 grooms. And

193
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:35.000
my husband should tell that story, but you can see there is a video where you see them arriving

194
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.840
with beautiful crowns. I didn't remember us having crowns before, but this was the first collective

195
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.920
marriages in India. So it was very much, we were enjoying the Indian style of doing things. And

196
00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:53.240
they had the crowns with Shomataji's picture in the first time. And then after the weddings,

197
00:24:53.240 --> 00:25:00.600
we all sat up on a, like on a dais, no on a, like a little kind of stage. And

198
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:07.640
Shomataji came by and blessed us all and congratulated us and gave us some gifts,

199
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:14.680
each couple and even some of the Indian collectives gave gifts too. I think I've overdone my time,

200
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:26.920
but I just, I just add one little thing. So when, before in 79, 80, we were again with Shomataji

201
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:34.040
in a room in her flat in Victoria gardens. And she'd been talking about everyday sort of more

202
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:41.240
mundane things, maybe programs. And then suddenly the atmosphere changed and she started to talk to

203
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:48.440
us about marriage, about how important it was that at that time, the only married couple were Jim and

204
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:55.880
Hillary and Gavin and Jane who'd come into Sahaj married. So none of the rest of us. And we were all

205
00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:04.600
fairly young in our mid, mid twenties, some early thirties, but mostly that 23 upwards.

206
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.920
And she really stressed the importance that we all had to get married. She actually said,

207
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.760
anybody who doesn't want to get married in Sahaj Yoga can just get out, just get out. That's it.

208
00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:24.200
And then she then said, and the whole, I could feel, I just remember it as being,

209
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:29.880
it was felt so historic to me. And I remember her sitting, I see her sitting on her chair

210
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:37.000
framed with a window and the light was coming in and she seemed so large. We were all at her feet

211
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.360
on the ground. And she said, you are the foundation stones I'm building. We're building Sahaj Yoga

212
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:50.760
upon, but I'm sending you the children and they are the ones that are going to change the world.

213
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.880
And she also talked about the schools, but I never forgot that I am sending you the children

214
00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:02.120
and they are the ones that will change the world. And this weekend at Krishna puja, when we saw

215
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:10.200
these amazing, so many of them who've grown up in Sahaj Yoga and just so joyful. So many of them

216
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:16.600
who'd been to the school in ISPS at that same time, she said to us, and I'm, we will, I'm building

217
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:22.520
you a school and you will send your children there. And these are the children that, that came

218
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:32.200
through from there. And so it's such a, to, to see, you know, so many things you might, she promised

219
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:38.200
us in those early years of what would happen, how things would change. And I have to say that,

220
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:45.880
you know, like two thirds have already come true and to see these generations now getting

221
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.600
getting married. And as you said, having their own children and us being grandparents,

222
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:58.200
which is amazing. And even those, you know, some of the children have gone out of the collective,

223
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:04.920
the Sahaj collective, but still you see how shining they are in their lives, however they've

224
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:10.920
chosen to lead them. And I feel as if wherever they are, whether they're in the Sahaj collective

225
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:17.880
or they're outside, these are mother's children and they are just shining and leading the life

226
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:26.360
and, and giving the vibrations that she, she bestowed upon all of them. So anyway.

227
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:35.720
Yes. Very nice. Thank you, Felicity. Yes, these are indeed very precious stories from the

228
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:45.080
earliest weddings. Very nice. So now we have two more, Inge and Victoria. Should we start

229
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.920
with Inge and Alan Morrissey and Felicity I hope one day Richard.
