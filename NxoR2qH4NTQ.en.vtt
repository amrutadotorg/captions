Sahasrara Puja, "How it was decided". Fregene (Italy), 8 May 1988.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.240
Today is the nineteenth Sahasrara Day.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.040
If you count the first one the day the Sahasrara was opened.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.760
I'll have to tell..

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.160
I'll have to tell you the story

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.560
about the Sahasrara day,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.840
about which it was decided, long time back,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.280
before I incarnated.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.000
They had a big meeting in the heavens,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.440
all the thirty-five crores (350 million)

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.120
of Gods, the deities were there present

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.160
to decide what is to be done.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.160
This is the ultimate that we have to give to human beings,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.080
is to open their Sahasrara;

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.400
to open their awareness to the Spirit;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.320
to the real knowledge of the Divine.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.240
To remove the darkness of ignorance,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.520
and it had to be spontaneously,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.960
because it has to work - the living force of God.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.480
Also it had to be very quick.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.280
So all the Gods requested that now,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.600
I, the Adi Shakti, has to take the birth.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.040
They all tried their best.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.320
They did whatever was possible,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.880
the saints were made by them, but very few.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.000
They incarnated and people made religions out of them

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.400
which were perverted - brought them bad name.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.720
No reality in those religions.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.840
These religions were money oriented

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.480
or power oriented.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.960
There was no Divine force working, actually it was all anti-divine.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.120
How to now turn human beings

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.280
away from these superficial religions,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.320
these perverted paths of destruction.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.160
How to tell them about all these established organisations.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.600
For ages they have been ruling,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.240
making money, making power.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.600
It was a tremendous task,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.720
had to be done with great patience and the love.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.000
It was a very delicate work also,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.320
because they believed in those religions,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.040
innocent people, simple people.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.160
To blast them that this is all nonsense,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.720
UNCLEAR (they/there) are no religions,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.880
they are against incarnations, against all the prophets,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.600
against all the saints.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.480
That's why all the real saints had to suffer.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.440
It's a powerful work that was to be done,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.840
and that's why Adi Shakti had to take birth on this earth.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.400
It had to be before the sixth of May

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.560
because sixth of May was the doomsday in that year.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.920
It was done on the fifth of May at the nick of time.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.080
It was all decided beforehand,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.600
and every deity's job was allotted to all of them.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.720
Very efficient deities, very obedient,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.560
they knew me very well.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.480
Completely dedicated and devoted.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.880
They knew me very very well,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.000
every end of my hair, they knew.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.960
I didn't have to teach them protocol,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.600
love itself gives you protocol

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.800
but love that is Divine, is not selfish love.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.960
It's not the way we love my child, my husband,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.160
my country, my clothes.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.000
It is the love

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.720
which is Divine,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.440
which spreads from your heart,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.200
from your Spirit,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.280
like the light of knowledge.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.440
What a tremendous task it was.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.840
So I said, at Sahasrara

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.560
I had to be Mahamaya.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.520
I had to be Mahamaya. I had to be something

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.840
that people can't recognise me easily.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.200
But deities know!

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.320
This Mahamaya had to come on this earth,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.160
not the Adi Shakti in her purest form, it's too much.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.480
So she was covered with this Mahamaya.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.960
Now you see,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.160
in nineteen years what we have achieved.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.400
So many yogis are sitting before me.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.320
The difference between

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.120
a saint and a yogi is

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.840
that a saint himself is righteous,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.240
himself is holy,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:08.120
but he doesn't know much about the Kundalini.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.840
But the yogi knows about the Kundalini.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.320
But the difference between a yogi and a Sahaja Yogini -

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.040
Sahaja Yogi, is that a Sahaja Yogi has powers.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.040
A Sahaja Yogini has powers to give realisation to others.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.160
A yogi can cleanse himself but he cannot cleanse others,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.480
while a Sahaja Yogi can cleanse others and cleanse himself.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.960
So this is the superior most state

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.120
which you achieved through your

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.400
great punyas I should say.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.720
So many of you have been searching the truth in previous lives,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.080
and now here you are to achieve

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.120
what you have been searching for.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.960
All that has happened now, so beautifully.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.040
You are not even aware what has happened to you.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.000
Automatically,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.560
spontaneously you have got the powers

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.760
within your central nervous system in a split of a second.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.840
Your attention has been fixed now.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.720
Of course even now some people don't have.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.920
Even now I see the attention wobbles.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.160
But so many of you have achieved that state as he was saying,

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.040
Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham. You have it.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.000
What Adi Shankaracharya has described about himself,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.320
you can say that about all of you.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.280
So many Adi Shankaracharyas sitting before Me.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.560
But still I am a Mahamaya.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.240
I just behave like you,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.160
I too have a family,

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.480
I too have children which can be called as mine,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.040
and you are my children too.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.960
So when you are mature enough

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.280
the first sign is that you get discretion.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.800
That Divine discretion is love, again.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.920
But I see people falter. They don't mind saying

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.440
"Mother, I am catching on my Agnya."

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.240
Why? You know how to cleanse it.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.320
You know what to do about it.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.920
Why don't you clear it? Why don't you get to it?

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.240
What is the thing? The Maya.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.680
First starts

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.720
the problem of family.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.720
My wife, my mother, my brother,

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.440
my husband, my children, all right.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.640
That's Maya.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.680
With that you get drowned.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.040
Again you are brought up.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.160
Then subtler and subtler this Maya becomes.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.680
The situation of the family improves, everybody knows that.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.320
But so many falter,

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.560
so many get lost

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.560
in Sahaja Yoga because they had a bad wife or a bad husband.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.680
You have to ascend alone, yourself.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.320
You don't have to depend on others.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.520
And those who do not allow you to ascend have to be thrown away.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.480
Nothing is more important than your ascent;

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.920
higher and higher, because it has a very great Divine purpose.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.720
The ultimate, the climax

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.080
where the whole humanity is to be saved through your efforts.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.040
You have to work it out.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.880
And at this situation we see the thousand petals.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.680
These are the powers of Virata within you.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.960
And this is where we falter,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.960
that the light of the Sahasrara

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:36.240
is the Brahmarandhra, which is your heart chakra.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.480
Now the heart chakra can be also misunderstood, very much.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.480
And this misunderstanding always comes

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.560
from the Mahamaya, for testing.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:58.960
Like we have, say, we have to have a family.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.120
We must have good families, we must have good children.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.800
Immediately the Mahamaya acts.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.600
We start worrying about the husband, worrying about the family.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.320
We should be your family.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.320
There's a saying in Sanskrit:

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.840
”Udāracharitānām vasudhaiva vasu kutumbakam”

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:31.480
the one who are of a character of saints,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.560
the whole world is their family.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.440
You worry about an individual family

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.840
so that the collective family is strengthened,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.040
not to worry about individual families,

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.080
so that the collective suffers.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.040
And if there is such a family tie, better throw it away.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.080
We have to sacrifice.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.480
No sacrifice, it's only getting rid of the disease.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.360
So we waste our time with our children,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.280
with our family, which is very small.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:29.560
Then the situation changes in different areas,

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.840
that's the compassion,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.400
the love and affection.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.400
We believe that we have to love Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.280
I asked somebody to go away,

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.240
because he had a disease and he told me lies.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.760
So a negative person's attention will go to him more,

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.160
and will try to look after that person more

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.240
than to other Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.040
Do you have more compassion and love than I have?

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.680
Why do you get attracted to people who are out of Sahaja Yoga?

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.960
Why do you sympathise with people

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.760
who are like this.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.840
You are not here to help

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.040
the downtrodden, the poor,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.280
the so called suffering people.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.800
No, you are not incarnations.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.720
You are not here to help women

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.560
who are crying all the time,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.640
and to children who had to be separated from their parents.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.880
It's a hospital that we are in.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.560
We are getting cured all of us.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:27.000
Have you heard of a patient going and helping other patients?

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.400
It's the doctors that have to do the job.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.080
But Sahaja Yogis always, in the beginning,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.120
used to fall a prey to this kind of an appeal;

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.320
like a bad apple, and there are many good apples.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.160
How can the good apples cure the bad apple, can they?

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.120
Even if you put

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.440
twenty thousand on top of that bad apple it will spoil all others.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.760
That's not your job, that's the job of God.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:15.880
Only thing what you can do is to pull that person

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.240
in the collectivity showing that

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.480
you are wrong, you are wrong, you are wrong -

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.080
and you have to be all right.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.760
But these ideas, I don't know from where they have crawled,

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.960
that there's nothing like evil in this world.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.840
There's nothing like bad in this world. There is evil,

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.680
there is something bad.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.120
And you can know, if your vibrations are correct,

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.400
your discretion is correct you'll know immediately.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.280
So you waste your energies in correcting people

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.480
who can never, never be corrected,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.960
and forgetting that you have not corrected the person,

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.360
on the contrary you are corrupted.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.960
That means that you are not yet matured enough.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.040
In the breaking of the Sahasrara

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.280
I have never left anything undone, it's a perfect job.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.680
Your nerves are not hurt. Your brain is not hurt.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.400
Such a powerful Kundalini comes up.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.560
How sweetly, beautifully, delicately she pierces through.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.080
Only a thread comes out.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.960
And how then the connection is established

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.040
and the relaxation starts coming in on the sympathetic.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.400
How all the beautifully all the chakras open

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.560
and more of these threads are coming up.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.320
Now you are also told how to work it out.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.120
You know all the technical know-how.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.960
What you don't know, that you are not yet a perfect machine.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:13.040
You have to perfect yourself, moreover there's a Mahamaya.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.240
She doesn't take you for granted, that's the trouble.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.600
She puts you deliberately into temptations.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.680
Deliberately she gives you positions.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.840
Now leaders, world leaders, universe leaders.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:43.040
and so - you develop first one tail, then one horn,

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.720
and then something comes out of Sahasrara also.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.880
Look like a clown.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.960
To test you she may marry you to funny people also.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.160
This testing has to be done.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.040
That's the job of a Mahamaya. She has to test you.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.760
Gold has to be tested.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.080
The diamond has to be tested.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.680
All that is valuable has to be tested.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.040
Without that how can you certify.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.840
It's not like going to the church.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.560
Somebody puts the water on your head, all right,

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.760
now you are baptised. Finished, now you are chosen.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.920
The water will evaporate in no time.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.600
And when you will go to God he'll say

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.760
"How are you baptised?", "This water",

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.520
"Where is it? I can't see it."

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.960
So all these things are to be understood in right perspective.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.920
They are for our ascent.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.600
For our benevolence. For our higher state.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.080
But for that,

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.160
you must know, we have to fix up

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.160
our whole will to it.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.600
When people climb, say, Himalayas.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.200
What do they do?

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.760
They take a big nail, nail it at a higher point,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.320
then tie up a rope and climb up to that.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.560
They don't look down.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.040
Then put another nail up there, climb up to that.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.400
And that's how they climb Himalayas.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.280
Now what do we do in Sahaja Yoga, we take a nail

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.720
from the top, put it downward.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.720
First day when you get realisation the experience is tremendous.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.160
Then one by one coming down, the other way round.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:09.080
But as soon as you get realisation, if you are intelligent enough,

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.640
then you decide; "How should I fix up myself?"

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:21.840
Like, decide like this:

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.640
Supposing you are very fond of milk, take it like this.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.040
Now you should say "Till I achieve a certain state

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.560
I'll not take milk."

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.840
But that should not be treated as a sacrifice

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.480
but as a joyous ascent.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.800
Do the people who nail upwards to go to

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.960
the top of the Himalayas,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.880
do they feel they are sacrificing something.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:00.200
If you start thinking that "Oh God I have sacrificed milk."

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.080
Then you're finished. Downward movement starts.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.480
But if you like something,

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.280
then you have to say "all right if I like it,

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.080
let me like my ascent more than this.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.520
Till I have ascended I will not have."

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.800
Such determination should be there.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.920
And without that how do you think

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.240
you can get over the horrible,

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:40.320
monstrous mountain of ignorance that you have got?

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.080
Actually, in realisation I have put you on the top of the mountain.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.400
But you start slipping down.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:56.440
So you have to keep to that topmost point.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:04.280
I tell you about everything.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.320
You go and ask anyone of the saints or

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.840
anyone of the great incarnations,

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.120
did they know so much about Kundalini.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.880
If they had they would have written about it.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.840
They have never written anything about Kundalini.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.120
If they have it's very little.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.760
To such an extent that it acts on your fingertips.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:43.240
That now we have brought science

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.800
close to reality,

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.960
the truth, the Divine science,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.840
all explained.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.960
It's become completely integrated now with us.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.960
Sahaja Yoga is the most scientific thing

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.160
that you could think of, exact.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.040
The biggest computer that you are,

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.160
but the computer has to be workable.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.760
And there's why we have failed.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.920
And we fail every day.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:31.320
Sometimes it is disastrous, horrible.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.880
Now nineteen years we have had the Sahasrara,

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.160
and eighteen years I have worked.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:54.440
You have to now understand your responsibility.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.960
We have to emancipate the human beings.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:08.960
We don't want to do anything

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.960
that is a little out the way.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.240
Now Sahasrara day is on the fifth,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.120
but we must celebrate today

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.320
because everybody must have a Sunday holiday.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.880
According to our conveniences, we have to work out everything.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.240
All right, doesn't matter. It's permitted.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:38.880
The deities, they are working twenty-four hours,

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:47.840
all the months and all the years now, continuously.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.600
Because they have a continuous supply of energy,

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.640
which you can also have.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:03.240
The importance given to your ascent

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.960
is very little, I think,

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:12.040
compared to the growth of eighteen years.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.320
You know in the western countries, after eighteen years

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.320
you are regarded as adults, no more children,

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.840
you all have become now adults.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.960
Adults, all right, but I don't know how far you have grown.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.840
I don't know really, you are still big babies,

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:44.040
or you have really achieved that state of adulthood.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.720
And there, at that time, you are given lots of

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.080
concessions and freedoms and rights.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.600
You have already all rights:

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.000
if you want to go to heaven you can go,

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.120
if you want to go to hell you can go,

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.200
all freedom, no problem on that.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.600
But the adults are those who have discretion,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.720
who know what is the purpose of their life,

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.920
who can do anything to achieve that purpose,

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.800
who have powers to fight and understand.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.880
While I find people who are even grown up people

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:33.640
in Sahaja Yoga, behave in such a manner.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.680
that you're surprised, how do you get impressed

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.280
by superficial people, by superficiality.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.760
If somebody is very sweet to talk,

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:48.240
doesn't mean that person is good, that person is Divine, does it?

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.240
On the contrary a Divine person is never that sweet

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.480
that you get sick of that sweetness.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.400
He has to keep both the reins in the hands.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:09.360
Yes, freedom, all right, the accelerator all right, also the brake.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:16.000
But you always like a person who pampers your ego,

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:20.360
says something very sweet.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.720
What does it take to say sweet these days, people are training them

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.480
in that kind of an artificial.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.120
You must judge a person on their vibrations.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.880
But as it is

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.160
because you are superficial you cannot feel the vibrations.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.880
You pay attention to people who are nonsensical.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:44.560
Now accept one thing at that point that you have still mature.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.320
That you don't accept, then your ego comes up "Oh God,"

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.600
or you feel guilty. How will you progress then?

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.960
Only thing you have to do is to get into a boat, that's all, fully.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:07.280
But here you put your foot in the mouth of a crocodile, all right.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.320
If you take it out from there, in a  mouth of a shark,

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.800
and the boat is pulling you, which way you stand?

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.960
But the worst are human sharks and crocodiles

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.600
because they never show you their teeth.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.880
They never show you their eyes.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.600
They cover themselves with such deceitful appearances,

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.720
such dubious behaviour

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.040
that you can't see them unless and until you are a Realised soul.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.840
So now here we go further in our adulthood.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.720
And a woman who is brought up properly,

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:10.120
in her adulthood develops her shyness, her shame, her sense of chastity.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.920
As a child she doesn't know all that.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.040
But here the other way round, as soon as they become adult

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:22.480
they go amuck - boys become vagabonds;

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.240
When it is adulthood?

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.160
It never happens with animals. I don't know what is this.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:38.160
But we are Sahaja Yogis and we have our Sahaj culture.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.320
We live with our culture, proud of it, and this is our religion.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:48.160
We have our pure religion on which we thrive,

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.960
we're not going to change.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.960
Ourselves we are going to change the whole world.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.480
We have a culture of our own

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.600
and we are going to behave in that manner

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.280
which is going to change the whole world.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.520
This is our responsibility.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.240
You are chosen for this work.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.960
You are the real chosen ones. You are the real pure ones.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.680
You are the ones who have established the kalisthan.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:26.160
Be aware of it, of your responsibility.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.200
Be aware of your powers.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.680
The greatest power that you have is of Divine love,

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.680
not the stupid love that blinds you

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.200
and that you fall in love, but you rise in love.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.800
The way we talk, the way we walk, the way we live,

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.720
the way we behave.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.800
Everything has to be Sahaj.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.040
And it is such a real, living culture

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.440
of beautiful people in the world.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.160
We see in the animals

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:17.040
in the birds; we see a swan, it's described.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.680
among animals the elephant, which has the wisdom.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.920
The swan that knows how to separate water from milk.

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:36.400
Then among human beings, Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.640
Today, in these modern times,

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.720
I think by the time it is twenty-one years

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:51.960
we will be all very well established, matured,

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.440
wonderful Sahaja Yogis,

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:02.480
pulling out this mad world from its ignorance and from its Maya.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.600
We'll be that powerful people of love,

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.720
of understanding, of discretion

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.240
and of humility.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.080
I would like to see those days in my lifetime.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.960
I hope you will give me full asistance.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.760
You have to know

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.200
there's only one point was fixed in this meeting of the Devas

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.480
and that I cannot overcome.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.400
They said " we'll tolerate any nonsense

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.560
because they are coming from ignorance,

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.720
but anybody who doesn't love You

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.120
anybody who insults You,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.800
anybody who takes advantage of You

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.840
anybody who exploits You,

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.760
anybody who shows lack of protocol,

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.840
anybody who doesn't recognise you, we'll hit them hard,

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.960
and that permission You must give us,

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.120
otherwise we are not for this work".

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.720
They formed a union against Me.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.960
And I had to give in.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.040
And be very careful, I tell you, don't touch me, be careful.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.880
Some people just try to put my sari right.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.360
You're not to do that, don't have to do that.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.880
Don't play with my money,

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:40.480
don't take my hospitality, be careful.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.440
I tell you as much as I can,

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.560
and this is what it is.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.880
One side is Mahamaya, another side these deities,

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.720
and poor Sahaja Yogis in between.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.920
I sympathise with you, I know

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.320
but you better be careful.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.360
It's a razor's edge I think, of course,

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.000
but otherwise it's wonderful.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:19.600
If these two things, if you know, that this is Mahamaya

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.160
and that the deities are around sitting now here, all of them,

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:29.000
peering into you, all of them,

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.200
judging you, having a big meeting there. Who's who?

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.640
Where is the attention of this gentleman? Where is he looking?

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.360
What is he doing? They are all sitting here.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:47.560
But at the same time they are flowers, Divine flowers,

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:53.000
Divine blessings and all the angels are just going round,

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:57.120
I can see them. Your cameras can catch them.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.520
You've got photographs that will show you all of them sitting.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:06.880
And it's already predicted that the whole world will

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.040
come down at the Lotus Feet of your Mother,

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.760
and that you will decide the future of this world.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.760
It is written already, fourteen-thousand years back,

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.960
and there's another one who's prophesizing the same.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.960
So you have to be aware.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.400
Where is your attention?

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.560
What are you worried about?

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.920
Where are you spending your time?

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.840
Leave your children to me.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.680
Leave your families to me.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.000
You can only keep your purse,

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.040
but the rest of it,

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.680
you can leave all your headaches to Me.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.840
But don't play tricks with Me.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:26.040
Mahamaya knows all your tricks, everything, in and out.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.840
If I want to know, I can know each and everything about you.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.080
I don't want to know.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.320
Under these circumstances

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.400
we are supported, looked after,

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.120
managed, taken to reality so easily,

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.680
so much, with care.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.240
You tell me "Mother, suddenly I went there

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.120
and what do I find, Sahaja Yogis sitting there.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.360
And we wanted to know someone. He was just there.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.680
How is it?"

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.840
You are assisted.

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.760
Here these Prime Ministers have only five, six bodyguards,

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:26.160
you have millions and millions, each one of you, with you.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:32.040
Nobody can touch you except for you can harm yourself that's all.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.480
Nobody can harm you.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.560
So today, again a day of great determination,

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.120
and taking a vow

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:48.680
that for us, our ascent is the only concern,

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.720
is the only idea, nothing else,

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.480
and it will work out.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:00.560
All the rest will be taken care of.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.720
You have all the mechanics to do that,

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.840
but first give it to the mechanics to work out.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.880
All will work in a reflex action.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.400
Clear, clear out your chakras.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.440
Don't say "I have this, I have that." Just clear out.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.360
"How dare I have all these problems."

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.040
How dare I have all these chakras still lingering.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:30.080
Clear out, morning, evening. Clear out.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.400
I'm sure it will work out.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:41.200
Next year I hope I'll have some good news.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.360
May God Bless You.
