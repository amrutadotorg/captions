00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.863
We have a center specially for futuristic behavior

00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:12.937
called as Swadhisthana Chakra which is in the gross

00:00:13.018 --> 00:00:17.738
manifesting the plexus called the aortic plexus within us.

00:00:17.858 --> 00:00:20.697
Now this Swadhisthana Chakra is very important for human

00:00:20.817 --> 00:00:24.822
beings, specially for people who are developed people.

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:29.488
With this chakra actually we convert the fat of the stomach

00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:31.822
for the use of the brain.

00:00:31.942 --> 00:00:36.187
Now this is the center of the Surya, of the sun.

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:40.733
Now when we start thinking, these cells are converted

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.405
in such a way that they become useful to the brain.

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:48.947
Now, if you are thinking all the time, all the time

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:50.858
you are thinking, then what will happen?

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.738
I mean the horns are not going to grow out of that.

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:57.488
You are consuming all that, and then you are consuming

00:00:57.608 --> 00:01:00.989
all those cells, you have to have replacement,

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.738
and for that replacement this Swadhisthana Chakra has to work

00:01:04.858 --> 00:01:10.279
very hard to convert the cells for the use of your brain.

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.822
Now, when it is doing that there are other things which this

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:18.488
Swadhisthana Chakra has to look after; for example your liver,

00:01:18.608 --> 00:01:24.405
your pancreas, your spleen, your kidneys, all are to be looked

00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:29.947
after by this center, and also uterus for the ladies.

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:33.197
Now, when there’s only one work is given to this

00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:36.989
Swadhisthan Chakra and it cannot do any other work,

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.530
then other things are neglected, so you develop a

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.983
terrible disease called liver trouble.

00:01:43.817 --> 00:01:47.072
Now liver trouble is another thing that you do not feel yourself.

00:01:47.192 --> 00:01:49.558
Others know that you are liverish the way you are

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:55.114
hot tempered, the way you are fussy, the way you always

00:01:55.234 --> 00:02:02.197
snarl at people and the way you are never satisfied

00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:04.863
with anything, the way you criticize others;

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:09.488
all this is liverish and such liverish people are never happy

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:12.738
with themselves because liver looks after your attention.

00:02:12.858 --> 00:02:15.918
And those who have liver problems, their attention is horrid,

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.096
that goes like this, you see, you cannot keep your attention straight.

00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:23.239
On the street you’ll walk straight into a car because you are looking at something which

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:24.655
you are not supposed to look.

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:29.001
But all the time you are looking at like this, you
cannot walk, I mean you won’t find any animal like

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.863
that who walks like this, but only human beings do it.

00:02:31.944 --> 00:02:36.028
If you see them on the street you’ll be amazed.
Where are they walking? They don’t walk straight,

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.628
they don’t look straight, but their eyes are going this way,
that way, because the attention is wobbly,

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.197
the attention is wobbly because of a bad liver.

00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:46.488
So this liver is a very, very important thing.

00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:52.197
Now, this liver has a special capacity to extract all the poisons

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:56.655
from the body as heat, and the heat in the body is to be

00:02:56.775 --> 00:03:02.197
transformed or should be conveyed to the blood,

00:03:02.317 --> 00:03:05.363
or the water in the blood, and that has to be taken out

00:03:05.483 --> 00:03:09.863
of your body maybe as perspiration or in another forms.

00:03:09.983 --> 00:03:12.613
But what happens that when this liver is

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:17.530
out of gear it cannot do it, it cannot pass this heat into

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.239
the blood stream and the heat remains in the body

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.989
and you really become heated and that

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.363
heat makes all these problems for you.

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:32.989
So in Sahaja Yoga what happens that when Kundalini rises,

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.775
She changes the form of the blood.

00:03:37.858 --> 00:03:41.530
The hydrogen and oxygen which are placed because

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.863
of this heat and all that in a very funny way, like this,

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:49.239
get like that and they start receiving this heat within them.

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.947
That’s why those people who have bad livers feel

00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:54.072
little heat when the Kundalini rises.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:57.072
But one can cure it by giving it that peace

00:03:57.192 --> 00:04:00.989
and comfort to that liver organ, and you can definitely

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.680
cure your liver, no doubt about it.
