1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:13,620
So the truth about you is that you are not
this body, mind, your ego, your conditionings.

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,120
Because you say this is my
ego, it is my conditioning,

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,540
this is my house, this is my wife, my husband.

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,660
So this 'my', who is the 'my' there?

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,040
So you become the 'I', the 'self',
that is the Spirit which you are.

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:40,740
And the second truth is that there is all
pervading power which does all the living work.

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,560
Look at these beautiful flowers;
it's a miracle, if you see.

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,700
There are different flowers from
different seeds of certain heights,

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,320
certain shapes, certain colour.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,640
And we take it for granted.

11
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,780
We don't even think about them
how they have come out like that.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,854
Who runs our heart?

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,760
The doctors will say autonomous nervous system.

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,676
But who is the 'auto'?

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,280
So we never question anything about
living process, because we can't answer.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:28,299
This living process is done by a very subtle
energy, which you can call by any name,

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,720
is the divine power of love.

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:44,700
You can call it as 'Ruah' as in Quran, you can
call it as 'Brahma Chaitanya' as in Sanskrit

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,260
and as 'Ritambhara Pragya' by Patanjali.

20
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,140
You can give it any name to it,
is different but, it is a power

21
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,200
which we have never felt before which is
a subtle power which does all living work.

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,700
So, as if, if you have not
reached that source of energy,

23
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,780
the whole development outside is collapsing.

24
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:28,260
Also, supposing this instrument is
not connected to the mains, then,

25
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,560
it has no identity, it has no meaning.

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,484
Why was it created?

27
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,968
And everywhere these days I find the seekers
are trying to find out their identity.

28
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:54,180
So what is your identity, is that you are the
Spirit, you are the Spirit and this Spirit is

29
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,580
the ultimate that you have to become.

30
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:07,440
Once you become the Spirit, in the
light of the Spirit you see the Truth.

31
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:17,100
First of all on your fingertips you start feeling
this cool breeze, 'Cool breeze of the Holy Ghost',

32
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,280
you can call it or this 'all
pervading power of divine love'.

33
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,620
And when you start feeling that power,
is… your body acts like a computer.

34
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,747
You ask any question.

35
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:35,203
There are many people who
don't believe, there is no God.

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:44,700
I think it is very unscientific to say there
is no God, because you have not found out.

37
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,060
Without finding out how can
you say there is no God?

38
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,440
They have all kinds of funny
stories even about Christ.

39
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,874
They say He was not the son of God.

40
00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:56,534
How do you say?

41
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,020
You are not at that point where you
can decide, what is true, what is not.

42
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:10,140
Just mental projections, they go on
condemning all the great incarnations,

43
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,200
and all the great prophets, and seers
and sages because they are all blind.

44
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:23,820
Kabira says that, "O God, how am I to explain to
all these people who are blind in this world".

45
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,993
”Kaise samajhaavu, sab jagah andha."
