00:04.063 --> 00:07.906
Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers
of truth.

00:14.563 --> 00:23.023
[Short introduction of Shri Mataji
in Arabic by the Tunisian interviewer.]

00:23.224 --> 00:26.844
Interviewer (Lady): Shri Mataji, which are
the benefits one can get from Sahaja Yoga

00:27.045 --> 00:30.828
and what is special about this technique?

00:31.383 --> 00:36.771
Shri Mataji: First of all, one has to know
that it is the breakthrough

00:36.972 --> 00:43.358
into a new awareness and the last
breakthrough of our evolution.

00:43.559 --> 00:46.488
The benefits are, first of all,

00:46.689 --> 00:54.418
that the fundamental energy centres
within us are called as chakras,

00:54.619 --> 01:00.957
and they are responsible for our physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual being.

01:01.158 --> 01:06.973
So when this power, which is a Kundalini
in the triangular bone called as sacrum -

01:07.174 --> 01:10.418
that shows the Greeks knew it was
a sacred bone -

01:10.618 --> 01:14.645
which is awakened and passes through
six centres,

01:14.846 --> 01:22.183
as a result, these centres are integrated
and are nourished and enlightened.

01:22.384 --> 01:26.745
So your physical, mental, emotional and
spiritual problems are solved.

01:26.946 --> 01:32.901
As a result also your financial, political
and income problems are also solved,

01:33.102 --> 01:35.893
because you become a transformed
personality.

01:36.094 --> 01:41.995
And when this transformed personality
starts behaving in a manner

01:42.196 --> 01:48.921
that is so congenial to spirituality,
people are amazed!

01:49.438 --> 01:54.690
Now our problem is that we don’t know
the absolute truth.

01:54.891 --> 01:59.707
By this you know the absolute truth and you
become empowered

01:59.908 --> 02:04.659
that you can give Realization to others.
You can solve their problems.

02:04.860 --> 02:10.002
So it is something that, like one
enlightened light can enlighten many.

02:10.203 --> 02:14.968
This is Resurrection as described
in the Koran.

02:15.999 --> 02:21.322
[Question in Arabic and in French what
are Shri Mataji’s feeling about Tunisia.]

02:21.540 --> 02:26.352
Interviewer (Lady): Shri Mataji, which is
your feeling coming to Tunisia?

02:27.529 --> 02:30.165
Shri Mataji: I think, it’s a very spiritual
place.

02:30.366 --> 02:35.376
Then I heard that there was a great saint
who died here.

02:35.577 --> 02:41.485
That is, I could feel it that his blessings
are here on this country.

02:41.686 --> 02:47.329
And there is such a balance, I’ve seen,
the women are treated so well

02:47.530 --> 02:51.227
in this Islamic country, it’s something
remarkable.

02:51.396 --> 02:56.766
And a thing of hope for all the women
of the world in Islamic countries

02:56.967 --> 02:59.633
who are really suffering very much.

02:59.857 --> 03:02.929
Interviewer: Thank you very much,
“merci, madame”.
