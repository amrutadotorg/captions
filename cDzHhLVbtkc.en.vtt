Shivaratri Puja, Pune (India)

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.700
16 March 2003

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:19.450
Today we are going to worship Shri Shiva, Sadashiva.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.950
His quality is that He is forgiveness personified.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.950
The amount of forgiveness He has,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.660
has helped many of us to exist,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.370
otherwise this world would have perished,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.790
so many would have been finished

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.660
because you know what is the condition of human beings.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.370
They don't understand what is wrong, what is right.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.950
Apart from that, they cannot forgive.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.160
They go on making mistakes- doesn't matter.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.660
But they cannot forgive others.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.080
This is what we have to learn from Shri Sadashiva.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:34.370
Today we are going to worship Shri Sadashiva.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:45.870
He is the embodiment of forgiveness, so powerful that

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.290
nobody is able to be against him, to challenge him.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:03.660
He forgives all our mistakes, no matter what they are.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.790
If he does not, he could banish the world because

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.160
within him there is a destructive power which

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.450
is able to ruin the entire creation.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.450
Although forgiveness is his inherent quality

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.450
this power of destruction could be awakened within him as well.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.790
His power of forgiveness increases gradually until it

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.580
becomes mature and then finally he is able to destroy.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.450
So first of all we need to acquire his quality of forgiveness.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.580
We as human beings are capable of forgiving to some

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.290
extent but, nevertheless we get angry and are ready to quarrel.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.290
But now He, who is the embodiment of forgiveness itself,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.200
reaches the point where his destructive power

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.370
could be awakened?

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.370
How does that happen?

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.790
Once his power is awakened,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.080
he is able to banish even himself,

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.200
the whole universe and every creation he has already created.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.410
So people should remember that in case we have not

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.080
learned to forgive and forgiveness is not established

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.200
within us, this destructive power will be awakened one day.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.290
And then we will destroy even our own people.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.910
That's why you should always keep in mind

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.500
that there is no need to get angry

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.410
with others in vain.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.790
You have absolutely no right to be angry with others.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.620
If Shiva is not doing so why should you?

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.620
But people get angry extremely often and very heavily.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:56.200
Animals never get angry to such an extent.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.410
They won't get annoyed without any reason.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.200
Thus while getting angry at small things

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.700
we should always remember that

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.620
the power of Shri Shiva exists within us as well.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:25.200
Forgetting that Shiva exists within us is exactly what

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.200
makes us get angry with people

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:41.910
and unable to forgive their faults and mistakes.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.910
But what makes us act like this

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.830
and what can such a person achieve?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.830
Wherever and whenever big events and occasions

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.200
have occurred men have started to destroy

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.830
other people out of pride and arrogance.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.830
This destructive power was even stronger in the past when

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:29.330
people were banishing each other without any reason.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
We do not need to think about where

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.120
has this attitude come from and why.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:47.000
The only thing we need to remember is not to fix

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.540
our attention on such an inferior thing.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:05.200
If we could live in peace, if we could be able

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.040
to see the peace in every single thing,

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.200
we would be capable of making our lives peaceful too.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.620
But the point is that human beings

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:28.040
are not able to control themselves.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:36.200
Moreover, they feel pleased getting angry with

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:42.910
someone and giving punishment,

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:50.750
to such an extent that even countries could be involved.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.330
If a person starts to quarrel with another one

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:03.250
from a different country, all the people go behind him

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.330
and nobody thinks of discussing, everyone is ready to fight.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.040
This inclination of human beings is very strange.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.620
How could one feel happy

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.950
because of getting angry withsomeone,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.540
suppression, fighting

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.830
or killing someone?

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.540
But you can see for yourself.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.750
Imagine that while travelling on

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:46.330
the road you see a crowd gathered.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.450
What are you going to do?

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:59.250
Some of you will join the crowd, but some will just watch.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:06.040
Sometimes such strange outbursts

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.830
in our temper are a sign that

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.950
the power of Shri Shiva inside us comes out.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.750
By worshipping this power heartily human anger

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.160
and wrath could be banished.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:27.750
It is considered an auspicious thing that

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:38.040
even Shri Krishna has done this greatest feat out of anger.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:46.750
All the things were born out of anger, the whole creation.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:52.450
But you people are very proud with what you've done

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.330
and consider yourself very powerful because of that.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:03.950
I am very angry with you about that.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:11.660
I can not see the beauty of humanity in your behaviour.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:19.160
To get angry for small things is a very typical thing.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.830
You get angry very easily

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:31.950
and are not able to find an excuse for someone's faults.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:39.950
But this anger can cause many troubles - wars can begin,

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:46.830
homes can be ruined and countries can be banished.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.450
With every passing day I can see human anger

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:56.660
and wrath not decreasing but increasing

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.450
and people proclaiming it with pride.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.160
I know you want Me to speak in English language, only.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.750
But people who don't know English are outnumbering you.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.160
What I'm trying to say,

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.250
that it's very important

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.450
to understand when you are worshipping Shri Shivashankar

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:31.250
that He is the complete embodiment of forgiveness.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.950
He forgives.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.370
He forgives everything very sweetly.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.450
As one would forgive all small children.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.750
He forgives.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.950
He doesn't get angry.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.750
He's not that easily perturbed.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:59.580
Also we have certain amount of prejudices.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.870
For example, a woman in India,

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:11.080
if she speaks, then people don't like it.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.950
A woman should not speak, a man can speak.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.080
And a woman can never beat

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.370
- a woman can never beat a man,

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.870
even if the man kills the wife.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.660
That is the criteria of a good wife in India, or a good woman.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:36.660
So you can imagine how men are getting towards their discretion.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.160
All this kind of concession that is given,

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:49.290
is very dangerous, is the destructive of the whole community.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.080
Same I've seen abroad.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.290
There are people who go on beating their wives,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.160
killing their wives - I don't know all kinds of things.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.870
Because they have married somebody,
they think they have every right

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.450
to expect everything good from their wives,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.870
while they may not be at all good,

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.790
and they go on torturing their wives.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.080
Not only that but in the school, the teachers,

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:25.290
they ill-treat the students so badly, the students pick it up.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:31.290
And later on they carry on the tradition

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.000
of beating others and troubling others.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So every time you say, "I get very angry,"

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:44.700
tell yourself you are on the wrong path.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.790
I've told so many times to so many of you

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:56.700
that to boast of your anger is the worst thing because

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:07.580
it is like boasting about your sins you are committing.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.700
These are the sins.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.080
I can understand some people who are drunkards,

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:22.450
or some who are mad, or some who are out of their minds

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.450
- but a mad person you'll find very, very sensible otherwise,

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:35.700
can be very ferocious, can be very dangerous.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:42.910
It is difficult to say from where do you get these qualities,

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.700
because none of the Divine Personalities

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.290
had this kind of thing.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.700
For no rhyme and reason They won't lose their temper

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:02.290
and even if They do, it has to be a very strong

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.200
reason up to the point of destruction.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.120
But I can understand Them,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.120
because They have to maintain this world

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.200
and They have to look after

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.790
the people who are supposed to be human beings.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:29.700
But sometimes I've seen human beings are

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.700
even worse than animals.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.000
They get provoked for nothing at all.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.500
What is the reason? Why are you angry?

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.000
They'll give you an excuse which is absolutely unreasonable.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:53.620
In this world you have come to enjoy peace and joy.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.120
Without peace, you can't have joy.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.620
If you cannot give peace to others, how can you have joy?

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:10.120
And the way people treat others in such a contemptuous manner,

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.120
it's very surprising, what do they think of themselves?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.410
Why should they think so low about other people?

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:29.540
It's beyond understanding to see a man losing temper

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.040
on small, small things.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.200
But actually they are cowards.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:43.200
If it comes to some facing some real problem in life,

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.910
they recede back. Then they cannot come forward.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.620
This is the biggest tragedy of the whole thing.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:04.040
In our country hot-tempered people are very well known too.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.700
In the villages they call them tetchy or naggers, or flares-up.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.040
Nobody likes to live with them.

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:20.250
All right. Imagine that someone has done a mistake. Forgive him!

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:28.120
If somebody has done something very wrong, forgive him

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.410
because tomorrow you could be in the same situation.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.910
And then someone could come and ask you questions

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.410
and you could be given a punishment.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:49.750
So you should understand that as Sahaja yogis

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:58.830
you have  absolutely no right to preach and punish anybody.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.910
You have to respect Shri Shiva.
This is the right thing to be done.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:09.750
So one has the nature of Shri Shiva within himself,

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.040
one is on the right path and is protected by Shri Shiva.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:20.330
Those who have open hearted

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.040
and fair have nothing to be concerned about.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:31.040
Shri Shivshankar looks after them and takes care of them.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.750
If it is so, then why do you need to get angry at all?

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.540
That's very strange.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:50.250
All the time you trust other people for your good prospects.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.330
And at the same time,

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.450
you are not able  to forgive anything which is wrong.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:06.330
When somebody has made a mistake

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.750
you wish that he would be ruined.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:16.160
Unless and until you overcome this desire,

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:22.950
you will not be able to understand your real nature.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:30.250
And you won't be able to answer the question.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:36.160
"Are you a human or an animal?"

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:43.830
Animals never get angry without reason.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.830
The power of Shivaji is very strong inside them.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:54.950
But man is exactly the one who is able

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.250
to completely destroy all human beings.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.870
He reckons he has the right to destroy

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.750
hundreds of thousands of people. Such a man was Hitler.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:16.250
He killed so many people without even creating a small child

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.950
Who did he think he was?

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:24.450
The families of all these people have also bee ruined

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.540
and their countries were destroyed too.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.950
Who did that man think he was?

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:36.370
There were a few more people like him in the world

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:43.250
but you do not need to follow his example.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.040
You are Sahaja Yogis so you have to forgive.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.250
Fair and open-hearted people are capable of forgiving.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.660
Their quality of forgiveness is very strong.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:02.250
But the very embodiment of forgiveness

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.950
is Shri Shivashankar.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:14.450
That's why He is the supreme one.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.160
He doesn't need any property.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.080
He can wear any clothing,

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.870
but if he hasn't got any,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.790
he would simply put some ash to cover his body.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.290
He can live and survive in any circumstances.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.950
He has no need of anything.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.870
But is someone feels wrath

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.160
and tortures somebody,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.160
finally Shri Shiva will destroy him.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.790
His power of forgiveness is as strong as his power of destruction.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.950
Why is it so?

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:04.950
Because when a man sees somebody being oppressed,

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.870
he should feel pity and should know

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.580
that if someone dares to behave like this

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:18.450
- oppressing others, he will be finished soon.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.450
Today not many people dare to act like this.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:31.080
In the past there were many more.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:41.000
They were famous for having tortured
and killed lots of people,

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:49.080
and having interfered in many countries and destroying them.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.790
But today, nobody hangs their pictures on the wall,

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.700
nobody remembers them,
nobody worships them as idols.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:05.290
Nobody remembers their faces either.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.580
You do not need to build such a temper.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:14.290
You'd better try to understand that if you are hot-tempered,

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:20.870
people might obey you out of fear.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:26.080
But you will be pleased with something

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.790
done under a threat?

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:34.200
And what is so special about that?

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:41.200
Consider for yourself how many people

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:46.000
have you been  angry with in this world

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.700
and how many people you have destroyed?

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:56.410
How many people you have quarrelled with?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:05.410
There are some people whose dharma is to be wrathful

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.580
and to quarrel for small things all the time.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.000
Hey will argue with someone in the morning,

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:17.580
with someone else in the afternoon

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.410
and with someone else in the evening.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
People keep away from such individuals.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.410
They will even cross the street in order

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.290
to avoid such a quarrel some person.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:39.120
All this can be overcome only through pure love.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.620
Sahaja yoga is the pure love

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:51.700
and we have Jesus Christ as a great example to follow.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:57.620
If we have established within us the quality of forgiveness

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:04.700
to the same extent as Christ has, we will be able to realize

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.410
the true nature of Shri Shiva and acquire his qualities.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.500
To get angry with someone is not unusual at all.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:22.200
That's why today all of you have to consider for yourself

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:30.120
- do you wish to destroy some other people

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.410
and living creatures and to what extent?

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:42.500
As Sahaja Yogis, you should completely give up this

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:48.200
because it is useless and it isn't worth doing.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.830
Today while worshipping Shri Shiva,

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:57.120
you people make a decision not to

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:03.120
get angry in any situation.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.540
If it makes no sense,

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.910
why do you need to feel wrath?

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:16.540
You doing that will just make you feel worse.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:22.330
So today, let us all worship Shri Shiva

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.830
and pray for acquiring his qualities.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.410
May God bless you.
