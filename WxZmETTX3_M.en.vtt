00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:13.740
Today is a special day of Guru Nanaka’s
birthday.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:27.730
We have celebrated one Guru puja and, as you
know that, Guru Nanak was also the incarnation

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.380
of the Primordial Master.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.210
The same Spirit came on this Earth.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:46.379
And he’s the one who tried to re-establish
the work of Mohammed.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:57.430
Mohammed was the incarnation of the same Spirit
– the Primordial Master.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.510
He came on this earth to establish the religion.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:15.340
Islam is the name of that religion, is the
religion of every Sahaja Yogi, of every Christian,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.369
of every Hindu.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:31.530
We all belong to one religion which believes
in expanding our awareness to the new perception

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.219
of collectivity.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:02:00.110
From human level to the higher level where
you can perceive and manifest the Divine Power.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.549
This is the religion we are following.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:16.849
All the religions were established on this
Earth to create the seekers.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:17.950
You are the seekers.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.250
You are the “men of God."

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.010
Now, all of you have to become prophets.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.920
And to become prophets today’s Sahaja Yoga
has taken the form of Mahayoga.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.099
All of you have to become prophets.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:48.760
The prophets have two special qualities, as
all the prophets had: First of all, they have

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.239
to talk about spiritual education.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.760
All of them did that.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:08.090
Mohammed Saheb did it, Raja Janaka did it,
Nanaka did it, Moses did it, Abraham did it.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:26.920
All of them prophesised and taught you how
to lead yourself in the right path, by the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.680
right action, by leading a right life.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.940
You are going to be the prophets of a little
different nature.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:04:02.450
You are prophets, you are Islamic, you are
Jews, you are Parsees, you are all those,

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:21.799
but you are going to become prophets which
are called as “pir’ in Islam, in Hindu

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.150
scriptures it’s called as “Atmasakshatkari’,
“Atmajas."

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:42.140
In the way Nanaka has described, he calls
them “par."

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:51.950
But you are endowed with a greater power.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.880
There’s more power in you.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.510
There they had a bigger propensity.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:11.380
You have another delicate power by which you
can raise the Kundalini of people.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:21.790
You are going to be prophets who are going
to make others prophets.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:29.870
Not only to establish religion but to make
them prophets.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.150
This is the most important thing.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:45.340
Not just to maintain a static state of righteous
religious good people but to evolve those

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:52.460
seekers, those righteous, good, religious
people into prophets.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:04.210
And those prophets whom you will evolve will
also be the same type of prophets but they

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:13.590
will also have this additional power by which
they will also evolve.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.210
That is why it is a Mahayoga.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:33.560
This is the greatest work in the history of
all spiritual history, that you are the prophets

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:42.090
who are looking after the men of God, and
you are going to transform them into prophets.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:56.990
To have so many prophets now, for me – you
can’t imagine how happy I must be feeling.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:08.640
I have been, sometimes, very, very sharp with
you.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.570
Sometimes I had to goad you.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:23.510
Sometimes I had to love you, express my love
in that way, that you could feel that Mother

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.790
is very kind.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:33.970
Sometimes I had to be very critical.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.310
Sometimes also angry.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.830
Behind all these aspects of your Mother, She
is nothing but Love.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:50.180
Because She loves you so much, and She knows
that you have to be the prophets.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:57.281
Your calibre may not be of the same level
as those prophets, maybe – you can’t say

00:07:57.281 --> 00:08:04.870
– but definitely you have got special powers.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:15.800
Like, you can say, an old Rolls Royce might
be a better car as far as the propensity goes,

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.930
or an effect goes, or its behaviour goes – is
a good car.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:30.170
But one of the modern ones may have more capacity
to show new acrobats.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:39.409
For example it may tumble down, it may go
round the whole place and nothing will happen

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:40.409
to it.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:47.490
Maybe, after some time, you might find a car
which goes half way and comes up a little,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:55.550
like a hovercraft and then goes in the air,
and then again drops back.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:14.850
So, this new generation of great prophets
are here before me.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:24.560
But the big difference between them and you
is this: that none of them had a Mother to

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:38.500
guide them, to love them, to encourage them
when they were depressed, and also to spoil

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.330
them.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:55.500
But you have here a Mother who may apparently
look to be spoiling her children.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:06.500
But She is the Master of Masters and She knows
how far to take them and how to correct them.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:15.160
Now, for all of you, I have to tell you that
you have to develop your independent discretion.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:24.050
First of all we have to know that, in this
new realm where you have entered, you have

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:33.160
to have proper spiritual education, about
which I have given you so many lectures and

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.269
things.

00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:41.649
But education doesn’t mean listening to
lectures after Realisation, it means it should

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:50.810
be imbibed within you, it should penetrate
into your veins, and into your every artery,

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.639
into every cell of your being.

00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:59.490
You have to educate yourself spiritually.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:12.160
And Guru Nanaka prophesised, just like William
Blake, that, “The men of God are going to

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.519
come during Kali Yuga, and there will be many
prophets who will be transforming prophets,

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:27.870
who will be transforming people into prophet
state,” [this] he had prophesised.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:33.069
They have all prophesised about you!

00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:41.020
Now you have to prophesise (sic) about those
who are going to be prophets.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:50.190
But, as it is, you know that we need spiritual
education.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:57.220
Because your Guru is a Mother we lack discipline.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:03.139
There’s complete freedom for all of you.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:08.589
You know that if you go to a guru what kind
of discipline you have to observe!

00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:13.300
I mean the real one, also.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.650
Unreal, of course.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:21.180
But even the real ones, how they test your
attention.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:27.449
Even for the smallest thing, how they treat
you.

00:12:27.449 --> 00:12:35.889
I’ll give an example of Ravi Shankar, who
was a very great, you know, who is a very

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:46.730
great sitar player: my father was an advisor
to the Maharaja of Maihar where their guru

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.180
(Allauddin Khan) was living.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:56.660
This guru was a Muslim but he used to worship
Kali, Mother.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.990
He used to worship Mother!

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.730
And [a] very self disciplined man.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:09.270
They say he died at the age of 110 or 120
– Allauddin Khan Saheb.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:15.760
And this Ravi Shankar was there.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:22.690
I saw him as a young man, and this Ali Akbar
(Allauddin Khan’s son) whom you heard.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.029
They were literally frightened of their guru,
who was a master himself.

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:31.360
He knew so many of these instruments.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:40.559
One day my father, whom he used to respect
very much, always used to bow to him, though

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:46.050
he was a Muslim, they touched feet because
my father was a great connoisseur of music,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:53.279
and a supporter of music, and he bowed to
him and he said, “Now, should I play?”

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:55.730
So he said, “Why not ask your disciple,
this Ravi Shankar, to play?”

00:13:55.730 --> 00:14:00.480
And he said, “Yes, yes, come along, play."

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.480
he said, “Not today sir.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.880
Please, not today."

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.470
he was very frightened.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:11.129
Then he said, “Alright, let it be!” he
started playing.

00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:12.980
He used to play on mrudangam.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.379
Used to play beautiful mrudangam – tremendous!

00:14:17.379 --> 00:14:22.160
I mean, you can’t imagine! he was a Realised-soul,
no doubt.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:29.459
Then Ravi Shankar, when he finished and he
bowed to my father and he went away.

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:34.749
Then Ravi Shankar came to my father and he
said, “Don’t ask me to play before my

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.940
guruji!” he lifted his head and said, “See
here.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.869
Do you see this bump?

00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:47.279
This morning only, he hit me with my sitar,
which he broke, and this is the bump I have

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:48.279
got!”

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:50.910
So my father said, “What did you do?”

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.270
he said, “Only one note I played wrong!

00:14:55.270 --> 00:15:01.740
That too not wrong but little out of tune,
and on that point he has broken this part

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:06.950
of my head and I have been in this terrible
pain and he said, “You are not to see any

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:07.950
doctor!”

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:08.950
And really there was a big bump.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.759
He had covered it like that, with the hair.

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:24.569
(Laughter) That’s why today they have fame
as great masters, because to be masters you

00:15:24.569 --> 00:15:30.709
have to obey your master and to discipline
yourself.

00:15:30.709 --> 00:15:39.880
The spiritual education in Sahaja Yoga, under
Mataji Nirmala Devi, is absolutely left to

00:15:39.880 --> 00:16:00.620
your own wisdom: there is no force, there
is no compulsion, there is no organisation.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:09.959
It is you who has to feel the joy of your
Spirit and it is you who has to share it with

00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:10.959
others.

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:19.540
It is you who has to raise the Kundalini of
others.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:39.290
Now, today, when we are thinking of a Great
Prophet who, on this Earth, came to establish

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:45.540
good relationships between Hindus and Muslims.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:53.399
Imagine, when Mohammed Sahib came he did not
know that he was facing these horrible people

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:56.730
there who murdered him.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.129
Actually they murdered him.

00:17:00.129 --> 00:17:03.529
They gave him poison.

00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:15.040
And when he died he said that, “There will
not be any need for any prophet to come in."

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.060
Naturally, if you torture somebody, what else
he’s going to say?

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:27.290
Also, he felt that whatever he has said, being
such a truth, it will definitely prosper and

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.220
the seed has been sown.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:37.270
And he said, “There is no need for another
advent of a master."

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:49.900
But he found out that there was a big aggression
by the so-called followers of Mohammed, who

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:57.270
talked of nothing but rehmat (رحمت) – is
compassion.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:11.060
Now, before his death he encountered all kinds
of attacks from the negative people.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:16.950
Of all of them, the worst of all!

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.140
I think he has suffered the worst.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:26.660
He had to move from places to places, hiding
the children away from negative forces, [from]

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.800
tribes to tribes.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:43.450
It was a tremendous life, the way he led it.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:54.390
And all his life there was nothing but struggle
for existence.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:59.470
Only struggle for existence.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:16.410
When Nanaka came in, he saw that Hindus and
Muslims were fighting, so he started his theme

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:30.000
with Kabira, saying that, “Ram and Rahim
are both the same, and how can you differentiate

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.240
between the two?”

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:37.150
All their theme was like this, of integration
of these two main religions which existed

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:43.230
in India.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.090
That time, there was no question of giving
Realisation.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:53.020
People were trying to defend their faiths
and fight each other and kill each other.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.020
Imagine!

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.110
Created by the same Spirit!

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.320
Fighting among themselves!

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.660
How silly it must be, and absurd.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.970
In many places Nanak Saheb has proved that
he was Mohammed.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:13.640
Once, he was lying down and his feet were
towards Mecca.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.030
So people said, “How can you put your feet
towards Mecca?”

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.720
He had Muslim disciples and also Hindu disciples.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.050
He said, “Alright, whichever way you say,
I’ll put my feet."

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.420
He turned round his feet.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.980
They said, “Still you are towards Mecca."

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:33.650
He went round and round and round [but] still
they saw him facing Mecca!

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:46.600
And they could not understand how it was that
he was facing, his feet were towards Mecca,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.360
that Mecca was at his lotus feet.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.480
Same with Mohammed.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:21:02.430
Now, all these great incarnations had a special
power over water.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:12.740
Because you know, in the stomach we have our
Void and Nabhi Chakra which is made of ocean.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:22.840
Ocean represents the incarnation of Adi Guru
– Dattatreya.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.420
These had great powers over oceans and over
water.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:35.540
Like Moses – he crossed the ocean by creating
a road.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:41.990
That’s one of the very significant things
which shows that the Void can be crossed with

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:43.770
the help of the Guru.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:51.240
And even Mohammed Saheb had a tremendous power
over ocean.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:59.870
Then, Nanaka once put his hand on a rock and
water started coming out of that.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:04.870
People were amazed how it started.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.410
And that’s why it is called as ‘Punja-saheb’.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:08.970
‘Punja’ means ‘the hand’.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.030
‘Punja’ means ‘the five fingers’,
like this.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:20.950
What do you say to this, this part, [of the]
hand?

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.810
Hand with five fingers?

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.890
Yogis: This is the palm.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.450
Shri Mataji: No, no, not the palm!

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.140
The whole thing.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.140
Like this is a punja.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.140
‘Hand’.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.140
Yogis: The hand.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.140
The open hand.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.830
Shri Mataji: But hand can be like this (a
fist) you see?

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:38.830
This way.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.380
There’s no word, alright.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.850
So this is ‘punja’ – this is five.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:53.880
And ‘punjab’ is five waters, five rivers
– in that area – are called Punjab.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:01.060
Now, another thing about these: all these
incarnations had to deal with your attention.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:05.770
So they were particular about looking after
your attention.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:15.830
And that is why, from the time Moses or Abraham
came in, they talked of no alcoholism.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.450
All of them.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:26.960
It is written very clearly in The Bible that
the strong alcohols, fermented, should not

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.960
be taken.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.870
If you don’t want to read it, one need not.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:34.920
But they think it was Moses who said it and
Christ did not say – so Christians can take

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.900
it, the Moses people should not take it.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:42.890
There is no breaking of link between Moses
and Christ.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.260
They are of the same tree, of the same pattern,
of the same thing.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:54.870
But those who want to use Moses for their
own purpose will follow as much as Moses has

00:23:54.870 --> 00:24:00.780
said, and those who want to follow Christ
will follow only as much as Christ has said,

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.610
because it’s very good for them.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:10.800
For such useless people Sahaja Yoga has no
place.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:20.160
We have to understand that all these people
have said for our good and for the maintenance

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:28.330
of our spiritual life and none of them are
to be criticised or to be challenged but to

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.790
be fully respected as our Guru.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.230
All of them.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:42.590
Whether one belongs to Islam religion or to
the Jew religion or to the Christian religion

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.150
or to the Hindu religion.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:51.040
And if they are fanatic they are going against
their guru – it is against their guru.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.890
So, they were against fanaticism.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:57.840
First thing they were against [was] alcoholism.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:03.240
That’s the first thing, they thought, because
somehow human beings take to alcoholism very

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.240
fast.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:10.280
At the time of Mohammed Saheb, people did
not know how to smoke.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.590
Then they developed, became modern.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:18.460
At the time of Nanaka they started smoking
so he prohibited that.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:26.030
But Mohammed Sahib said that, “Anything
that goes against your awareness, any intoxication

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:37.840
of any kind” – he generally, he gave a
very general instruction, “is against God."

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:47.430
So, our training, our spiritual education
should be that we cannot be fanatics anymore.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:56.140
If you are fanatic anymore, or you are identified
with any one of your old ideas, then beware!

00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:02.280
Be very, very careful!

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:09.730
You cannot have fanatic ideas anymore if you
want to be a good Sahaja Yogi or a Maha Yogi

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:18.100
– meaning a person who is a prophet, not
only a prophet, but who is capable of transforming

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:24.210
others into prophets.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:28.910
First is, you have to be away from alcoholism.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.790
You should be deadly against it.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:40.070
Whenever you have a chance you find it that
it is possible for you to say something against

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.070
alcoholism.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:45.420
It should be absolutely boycotted.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:58.210
Every place, anywhere you meet, it should
be smoking or any kind of intoxication, drugging,

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:06.250
anything, has to be completely branded as
anti-God, anti-Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:11.490
Then, fanaticism of any kind.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:12.950
That lingers on.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:17.320
This is another very deep misidentification.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.200
I am aware of it.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:29.110
I did not talk of Catholicism till the other
day I went to Portugal, when I had to talk.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.920
So I said [for the] first time.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:37.320
I never talked about Protestants before, till
I had to talk that they are another mad race

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320
going round!

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.430
There are 27 churches of this kind.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:52.600
None of them, except for we, are really Christians.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:28:01.190
All are nonsensical fanatics: Seventh Day
Adventists and Pentecostals, and this and

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.150
that.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.470
All are absurd ideas!

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.890
All are playing into the hands of bhoots,
take it from me.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.980
They have nothing to do with God, they are
anti-God.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:21.270
All those who still stick on to all these
churches and to this kind of fanaticism – I

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:28.650
am saying here of churches because here I
have to talk about churches – should know

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.880
that all these churches have now become the
place of bhoots.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:39.650
You’ll go to one church and you’ll rush
to me!

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:46.910
From my house I see in the night, hosts of
bhoots waiting out of the church.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:55.750
(Laughter) I do not know! (laughing) And somehow
it’s happening that, whatever house I decide

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:56.750
to stay in, there’s a big church in front
of me.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.850
(Laughter) It may be a Catholic church, may
be a Protestant church.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:09.190
And they have seen to it that they make it
really bhootish by making all those who die

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:13.410
stay in that church.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.970
They are not Realised people.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:22.050
Realised people only should be buried and
all others should be burnt off.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.050
It’s better.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.340
At least the bhoots go out of them.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:30.550
And they are roaming about in the church,
and you are taking the children down there

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.480
into the cemetery!

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:38.260
Apart from that wherever there is a anadhikaar
cheshta (अनधिकार चेष्टा

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:42.270
meaning ‘unauthorised activity’) – when
it is unauthorised – Gods do not exist there.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.370
They leave the place.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:51.510
So, we have to know that we are no more fanatics.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.480
First and foremost thing is that we cannot
be fanatics.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:03.850
Now, training ourselves is very important,
spiritual education is very important.

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:12.040
But in Sahaja Yoga, as your Mother is a very
kind teacher, but even such a kind teacher

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:19.600
is not such a help sometimes because all corrections
are left to yourself, and then you commit

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:24.860
really blunders and then you think, “Why
didn’t Mother tell us?

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.280
Why didn’t She protect us, why didn’t
She correct?”

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:35.520
But this is the style I have adopted because
in modern times, Sahaja Yoga is working out

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.770
because I do not challenge your ego.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:43.890
Otherwise you would have crucified me long
time back.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:47.160
So I leave it to you to decide to discipline
yourself.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:52.250
It is for you to discipline yourself and understand
yourself.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:59.760
Now, the best way to discipline yourself is
to find out, “What’s wrong with me?”

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.760
Not with others.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.280
We are very good at that.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.590
I have seen every day there’s some complaint
about somebody coming from someone.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:15.570
But there are very few who will say, “This
is wrong with me, Mother, what to do?”

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:19.660
So just try to find out what is wrong with
you.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.110
You are like a fort.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:27.120
The fort has some sort of a weakness.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:35.330
So, the man in charge of the fort – what
do you call him?

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:42.310
We call kiledaar ( किलेदार ) because
a fort is kila and the gentleman is the owner

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.830
of the kila, is called as kiledaar.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:53.720
Now, this kiledaar finds out what are the
weak points of the fort and he sees to it

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.270
that they are all corrected one by one.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:32:00.400
We are just the other way round.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.420
We know we have weaknesses which we hide and
keep them there as they are.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:12.040
Whatever strong points we have that we boast
of and we try to see the weaknesses of others,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:18.950
and from these loopholes all these negative
things creep in and suddenly you find that

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.650
you are finished.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:28.410
So try to find out what are your weaknesses.

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:37.160
One of the weaknesses, which is very common
is that we are very materialistic people,

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:42.690
we are still very materialistic, extremely
materialistic.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:50.600
And the materialism is getting subtler and
subtler the subtler we be.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.100
Try to give up some things.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:33:03.220
Keep a kind of a little balanced attitude,
a little detached attitude, not too many things.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.630
Few things of value.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:09.030
Try to detach yourself.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:11.190
I don’t say you become sanyasis.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:14.030
That is also another thing against.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:17.520
But from inside you detach.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:29.950
See, I’m wearing a very nice sari, but from
inside see what is the colour.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:31.280
(Laughter)

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:36.510
From inside you should be detached, not from
outside.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:40.650
So that, try to practice this detachment.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:44.770
Whatever you want to possess, you just don’t
possess.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:48.270
Teach your body, teach your mind: “No!

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:51.460
You want a shirt?

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.390
No!Nothing doing!”

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:54.390
You try.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.290
Train up your body.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:01.440
Now some people want comfort, the body wants
comfort.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.240
Alright, “You want comfort?

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:10.450
No, I will sleep on the ground and teach you
a lesson!”

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:13.609
Teach your body a lesson!

00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:17.179
Teach your wants and desires a lesson!

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.639
Let’s see what happens.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:25.490
Now, I don’t know why, but in England it
should not be so.

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:29.710
I mean I expected people absolutely detached
because they have got everything.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:34.720
But here it is much more attachment than detachment.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:39.099
There is no satisfaction of any kind.

00:34:39.099 --> 00:34:53.869
So, a kind of a detachment must be developed,
to your desires, to your belongings, to your

00:34:53.869 --> 00:35:01.009
possessions and whatever kind of a material
aspect you want to build up.

00:35:01.009 --> 00:35:09.029
I always said that you must not look like
people who are coming from the lunatic asylum,

00:35:09.029 --> 00:35:16.099
that’s true, but you should also not look
like a dandy person, with a flair, a big bow

00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:19.640
here, and a sort of a thing.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.579
You should be in the centre.

00:35:21.579 --> 00:35:26.990
And how are you in centre?

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:28.230
When you are detached.

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.780
Then nothing can impress you.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:37.109
But that doesn’t mean…some people I’ve
seen that outside they make a show, that they

00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:43.140
are absolutely dishevelled, absolutely in
a very filthy condition, smelling like pigs.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.880
(Laughter) They think they are going to take
an avatara of Varaha (boar incarnation of

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.819
Shri Vishnu) by smelling like pigs!

00:35:51.819 --> 00:35:59.520
And all sorts of funny things they do in the
name of detachment.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.069
No – detachment is within.

00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:06.869
Try to practice it.

00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:10.299
That is one of the educations you have to
develop.

00:36:10.299 --> 00:36:12.599
How do you develop that detachment?

00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:16.349
Is by giving things away.

00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:20.549
Not to me, but giving things away to others.

00:36:20.549 --> 00:36:24.619
Say you reach a certain state of – say you
have two suits.

00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:28.070
If you have a third one then give it away.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:29.109
Give away things.

00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:37.499
It’s a very good way of developing detachment,
and enjoying the giving away than possessing.

00:36:37.499 --> 00:36:45.360
It’s greater, is much greater, take it from
me, is much greater than possessing.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:57.049
Now for you, at this stage, I cannot say,
but maybe after some time, it will become

00:36:57.049 --> 00:37:04.000
that I prophesise that you will become sinless,
absolutely sinless.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.730
You cannot do sin and whatever you do will
not be sin.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.910
I am sinless.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:15.980
Even if I rob you of all your wealth nobody
can say I have committed sin.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.190
I am absolutely sinless.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:26.400
Even if I kill thousands and thousands of
people nobody would say that I have killed

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.180
because I am sinless.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:39.160
But, despite all that state, I do not commit
any so-called sin because I have to lay down

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:44.640
my life in such a way that you people follow.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:50.759
That you should not tomorrow say that, “Mother
did this, She has done this so why not we?”

00:37:50.759 --> 00:37:53.569
That’s why I’m so very particular.

00:37:53.569 --> 00:38:03.480
At the same point I would like to tell you
that today Chaya, in her sweetness, went and

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.089
bought a very expensive sari.

00:38:06.089 --> 00:38:15.160
And she brought with such love and affection
to me, that I had told her just buy me a £10

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:20.630
worth of a shawl and she couldn’t bear the
idea.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:30.710
But she should know [that] for me anything
is valuable that you give to me.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:33.569
Nothing expensive is needed.

00:38:33.569 --> 00:38:41.150
Even if you give me the most expensive I have
every right on that.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:49.680
But you must understand that if this practice
is continued too much it will create a bad

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.680
public opinion.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:57.690
So, at the most, definitely decide that you’ll
give me only two saris, that’s all.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:00.519
I don’t need even these two.

00:39:00.519 --> 00:39:01.770
And I can have all of them.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:07.560
So, the situation is such that we have to
be very careful about the public opinion,

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.000
and people may start saying tomorrow, “Oh!

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.910
Mother, She wears all expensive saris."

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:17.950
Let my husband buy for me, he has lots of
money!

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:21.410
And you can buy me very ordinary things.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:25.089
And I told once Modi that, “You buy me khadi
(homespun) saris, that’s the best,” but

00:39:25.089 --> 00:39:26.200
he couldn’t bear it.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.470
It was too much for him.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:33.150
He says that, “Mother, we are middle class
people and we are giving you something middle

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:34.150
class."

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.150
I said, “Alright."

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:38.450
So, once for all I told them, “Alright,
you buy some saris."

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:42.800
And then I bought for them, one of them is
this one, and I don’t know if the whole

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.720
money is paid – most of the money I have
paid.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.710
But still, you know, there was somebody who
came out with an objection!

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:58.490
I know you love me very much and you want
to do something for me like that, but I would

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:06.150
request that try to get things which are sober
and simple for me.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:12.739
By God’s Grace, you should know your Mother
is looked after, you don’t have to worry.

00:40:12.739 --> 00:40:23.400
Supposing I was a beggar then you would have
had to spend much more money but that is not

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.400
so.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.000
And it is not that it is in any way wrong,
on the contrary, it’s a very great thing.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.960
After all these are going to be in your Mother’s
personal archives and people are going to

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:38.150
see what saris you people gave me, and they’re
going to be very happy – of course, no doubt

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.850
– and that’s going to be very, very great
for you.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:47.260
But, still, where the public is concerned
you be careful and understand that when you

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:54.930
do anything like that for me, this public
is mad and we have to keep a proper balance.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:41:06.519
Now, about training yourself, as I said, detachment,
then another thing is astuteness – astuteness.

00:41:06.519 --> 00:41:12.789
Try to develop astute habits – astute – specially
for religious work.

00:41:12.789 --> 00:41:19.760
First of all understand that you have to give
some money for Sahaja Yoga work.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.530
In that you should be astute.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:28.050
I was amazed to hear from some people that
for food also you want to have free – that

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:31.279
sometimes you had food you didn’t pay even
one pound.

00:41:31.279 --> 00:41:33.010
I mean this is absurd.

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:39.210
If you were beggars is alright, but for Sahaja
Yoga, first of all, it’s not too much.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:42.140
But little you have to pay.

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.529
And you should not make your Mother pay for
you.

00:41:44.529 --> 00:41:45.529
It’s wrong.

00:41:45.529 --> 00:41:49.960
I never said this before, but today I’m
telling you.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:54.920
Not aesthetically, but spiritually it is wrong
that I should pay for you.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:42:00.130
It’s alright – I may give you a dinner,
it’s different, I may give you anything,

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:07.020
it’s different, but that you should not
try to take advantage in any way or exploit

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:16.539
in any way this Mother of yours, who has got
lots of things other than what you know of,

00:42:16.539 --> 00:42:19.970
which can work out against your spiritual
growth.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:23.450
So just don’t do anything like that.

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:25.890
No exploitation.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:28.339
Learn that.

00:42:28.339 --> 00:42:33.190
Those who have done such a thing must decide
that no more like that.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:38.609
Now, I’ll tell you a difference between
Indians and you people is this: that an Indian

00:42:38.609 --> 00:42:40.890
would never do that.

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:46.539
We had one Indian coming here and he was not
such a big Sahaja Yogi, but he used to come

00:42:46.539 --> 00:42:50.740
for his puja, and he would not take money
for his puja and these people had to fight

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.740
with him.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.549
Ask him, he’s sitting down, he would not
take.

00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:58.269
But how materialistic we are!

00:42:58.269 --> 00:43:03.910
And then, when people mesmerise you then you
buy a Rolls Royce for that person, and here

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:09.550
a Mother is giving you all the freedom, so
you are exploiting your Mother!

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:14.250
“I have no job,” all this is wrong.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:18.680
You must pay for your food, and must pay where
you have to pay.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.020
That’s your dharma, that’s your religion,
of every Sahaja Yogi.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:28.960
Alright, you need not pay too much, but you
must pay where it has to be paid.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.900
And never take a parasitic attitude.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:36.289
That will kill your growth, will dwarf you.

00:43:36.289 --> 00:43:39.430
I am warning you about it.

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:40.430
Astuteness.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:46.079
For payment, for accounting, for everything,
one has to be extremely astute.

00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:51.609
Like, I’ll tell you, I have seen people
used to come to my house, long time back – I

00:43:51.609 --> 00:43:55.589
shouldn’t say this but [it] used to be so
funny – they would go in the kitchen, take

00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:58.470
out anything, eat anything, walk off anywhere.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.609
It was amazing!

00:44:00.609 --> 00:44:02.160
Our cooks could not understand.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.430
Nobody could understand such people.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:09.359
Just coming in the house, walking into the
kitchen, taking off whatever they like, eat

00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:10.359
anything.

00:44:10.359 --> 00:44:11.359
Like bounders!

00:44:11.359 --> 00:44:23.920
This training has to come within you where
you must realise and understand that astuteness

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:29.239
towards Sahaja Yoga has to be maintained.

00:44:29.239 --> 00:44:37.529
Like going into the ashram, walking into somebody’s
kitchen, taking out things.

00:44:37.529 --> 00:44:44.440
Using the ashram in a state as if it does
not matter.

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.440
It’s ashram!

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.660
It’s a pure thing.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.670
You cannot fight in an ashram.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.359
You cannot talk loudly in an ashram.

00:44:52.359 --> 00:44:55.019
You have to lead a pure life in an ashram.

00:44:55.019 --> 00:44:57.759
You cannot play games with each other.

00:44:57.759 --> 00:44:59.400
You cannot make it dirty.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.489
You cannot spoil it, otherwise your spiritual
growth won’t come up.

00:45:03.489 --> 00:45:09.099
This is the simplest thing one should know,
is to respect Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:09.099 --> 00:45:12.109
Love without respect has no meaning.

00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:16.789
You have to respect, and respect the place,
respect everything.

00:45:16.789 --> 00:45:21.289
Keep it clean, be astute about it.

00:45:21.289 --> 00:45:24.130
And this is one of the greatest trainings.

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:30.049
I don’t know how, but to a British mind
it should not be told, because they are known

00:45:30.049 --> 00:45:31.660
for this kind of a training!

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:43.119
But I don’t know, because now you are saints,
I think, I feel that you have had other kind

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:48.480
of training before, that you are born as saints.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:57.670
Perhaps you have no self-esteem yet, of the
value that should be given to your own character.

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:02.369
Without that, nobody is going to be impressed
by you.

00:46:02.369 --> 00:46:05.140
Nobody is going to be impressed by you.

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.920
Nobody is going to become a prophet.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.750
You have to first of all impress.

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.810
You have to dress up in such a way that you
impress others.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:17.770
It’s a very important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:20.529
You have to talk in such a way that you impress
others.

00:46:20.529 --> 00:46:25.839
Supposing somebody’s very fat, he must reduce,
somebody’s very thin, he must put on.

00:46:25.839 --> 00:46:28.859
He must try to have a body of the centre.

00:46:28.859 --> 00:46:33.970
Should not allow the body to move this way
or that way.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:41.599
One has to be in a proper shape, in proper
dress, because you have to impress on others.

00:46:41.599 --> 00:46:46.230
You must know that if the personality is not
impressive how are you going to communicate?

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:51.749
Because first of all the people see you, those
of you who come to you, see your outside.

00:46:51.749 --> 00:46:55.859
They don’t see your vibrations they see
your outside.

00:46:55.859 --> 00:47:04.119
So, all of you must learn how to dress up
and how to behave towards others, how to appear

00:47:04.119 --> 00:47:10.400
before others, how to talk to others, so that
you become prophets who will do wonders and

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:18.770
who will transform many, many, many more people
into the same state as you are.

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:24.259
Now, this training you have to take yourself.

00:47:24.259 --> 00:47:30.099
The another point in training in Sahaja Yoga
is that you have to read.

00:47:30.099 --> 00:47:39.589
There are many people who have not read even
Gregoire’s book, leave alone any other.

00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:47.789
You have to learn certain things like chakras
and centres and mantras and you have to dedicate.

00:47:47.789 --> 00:47:52.692
Even people like Vivekanada’s who never
got Realisation – do you know, these people,

00:47:52.692 --> 00:47:57.319
twelve people – they used to study for fourteen
hours.

00:47:57.319 --> 00:48:06.309
Now you will know what to study, what not
to study, and even if you study wrong things,

00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:07.309
you will know where it is wrong.

00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:08.309
So you have to study.

00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:11.609
For example, there are Jews with us – let
them study Torah and see there where is it,

00:48:11.609 --> 00:48:12.920
Sahaja Yoga, in there written down.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.540
Find it out!

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:18.249
If you are Christians read the Bible, find
out.

00:48:18.249 --> 00:48:22.720
You should read Gita, you should read Upanishadas,
and you should be masters.

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:30.099
You’ll find that Sahaj Yoga is such a light
that you will know what it is.

00:48:30.099 --> 00:48:36.589
We have got the Devi’s names and the Sahastranamas:
try to read them and try to understand the

00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:40.460
meaning of that and try to understand what
it means, how far it goes.

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:45.970
That’s how the depth of your knowledge will
increase and your Sahaja Yoga will tell you

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:51.619
what is right and what is wrong.

00:48:51.619 --> 00:48:57.479
Now emotionally, some of you have terribly
emotional weaknesses: the idea of ‘love’.

00:48:57.479 --> 00:49:04.970
[About] that I must speak to you because it
has come from a group of people who went into

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:07.680
another style against the ego-oriented people.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:12.290
And they believe that love means hugging each
other, kissing each other.

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:16.460
This type [of] nonsense is not love.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:25.119
Love is this, that flows, that is love.

00:49:25.119 --> 00:49:28.170
And understand the person through this alone.

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:34.260
And all nonsensical loves that people talk
of is not love.

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:40.519
When a person loves you he doesn’t stare
into you.

00:49:40.519 --> 00:49:51.160
If somebody stares into you then know he does
not love you – he’s full of a bhoot.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:59.239
Only when a realised soul is angry he stares
to drive out the badhas.

00:49:59.239 --> 00:50:05.079
So, anybody who stares into your eyes and
says, “I have love,” then know that it

00:50:05.079 --> 00:50:06.089
is mesmerism.

00:50:06.089 --> 00:50:16.050
With discretion you will know this: that anybody
who loves, only a glance is sufficient.

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:28.749
But when it is an anti-Christ activity going
on then you can stare at that person and the

00:50:28.749 --> 00:50:30.229
thing increases.

00:50:30.229 --> 00:50:36.940
So the idea of love is so absurd.

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:46.650
Love is the one that corrects, that improves,
that elevates, which is blissful.

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:53.279
The relationship is blissful, not hallucinations.

00:50:53.279 --> 00:51:01.619
And this blissfulness is only felt through
vibrations not through by hugging or by kissing

00:51:01.619 --> 00:51:08.080
or anything, just through vibrations.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:13.750
Of course, I don’t say you should not hug
each other and you should not kiss each other

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:16.980
– you should, but that’s not the way it
is expressed, it’s through the vibrations.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:25.099
It’s the pure love of your being which emits
just like light.

00:51:25.099 --> 00:51:34.859
Everything should be done in the proper education
of the spiritual love.

00:51:34.859 --> 00:51:39.569
We are people of dignity and sobriety.

00:51:39.569 --> 00:51:42.569
I have told you this before.

00:51:42.569 --> 00:51:46.529
Like, some people have a habit of doing this
in the — no!

00:51:46.529 --> 00:51:57.450
If you are sitting in a posture try to sit
for at least an hour – try.

00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:04.640
I have sat on one posture for nine hours,
people have seen: didn’t go to bathroom

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.369
or eat anything and just sitting there nine
hours.

00:52:07.369 --> 00:52:13.410
This is known as baithak is ‘the seat’.

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:18.269
And this baithak has to be great in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:52:18.269 --> 00:52:23.819
Try to establish your baithak, that is very
important, so that your attention is brought

00:52:23.819 --> 00:52:29.390
in line with your Mooladhara and is straight
there.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:38.630
Once you do that, practice it, you will find
your spiritual growth would be better.

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:41.859
Walk erect, be straight.

00:52:41.859 --> 00:52:46.309
In your talks be straight, kind and gentle.

00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:47.640
Need not shout.

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:54.089
No Sahaja Yogi should shout at anybody else,
should play games with another, should not

00:52:54.089 --> 00:53:01.920
in any way be angry with each other – is
prohibited.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:07.930
Should not get into any tantrums of pulling
your hair or doing something like that – is

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:09.020
all nonsensical.

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.650
You have to be very, very dignified.

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:22.050
But another foxy method which we employ very
much is to tease and provoke another Sahaja

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:27.539
Yogi, which is even worse, because it hits
you at a subtler point.

00:53:27.539 --> 00:53:31.779
Try to be straight, straightforward.

00:53:31.779 --> 00:53:37.989
Allow your mind to come to normal when you
talk.

00:53:37.989 --> 00:53:47.059
If you have to say something, wait and try
to say something nice, not artificial.

00:53:47.059 --> 00:53:53.609
Try to say something from your heart, not
to show off.

00:53:53.609 --> 00:54:01.329
In talking also too much quietness is not
good, too much talking is not good.

00:54:01.329 --> 00:54:06.269
Some suffer from too much talking and some
do not talk at all.

00:54:06.269 --> 00:54:12.170
It’s better to talk whenever it is necessary.

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:18.400
Talk something sweet, no sharpness and sarcasm.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.359
That will spoil your Vishuddhi.

00:54:21.359 --> 00:54:25.050
Sarcasm is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:30.359
You are not to be sarcastic to each other.

00:54:30.359 --> 00:54:41.319
Because of a new generation and a new race
that you are, you have to learn that to keep

00:54:41.319 --> 00:54:47.450
your vibrations alright you have to have collectivity
within you.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:53.190
Because you are collectively so much charged
that’s why the Kundalini’s rising.

00:54:53.190 --> 00:55:02.619
If your collectivity breaks then it’s a
very, very, very, very wrong thing.

00:55:02.619 --> 00:55:10.329
So, try to be nice to each other, kind to
each other, try to understand each other’s

00:55:10.329 --> 00:55:11.329
problem.

00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:19.789
And never, never complain to me about any
other Sahaja Yogi – till I ask.

00:55:19.789 --> 00:55:22.130
It’s prohibited!

00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:27.160
If you have to say, tell me about yourself.

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:31.950
Unless and until of course something happens,
then it’s alright, but not against anyone.

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:38.259
Because you will only see the bad points of
the another person and you will not imbibe

00:55:38.259 --> 00:55:39.450
the good points.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:46.390
You have to meditate and think about what
you have to do to become the real prophets

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:50.219
of modern times of Mahayoga.

00:55:50.219 --> 00:55:55.359
How you have to dress up, how you have to
behave, how you have to talk, and how you

00:55:55.359 --> 00:56:02.089
have to be kindly, that you have to decide.

00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:15.300
On this day, I would say that I have talked
a lot and only thing that you have to do is

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:19.890
to imbibe it in you and not on others, that’s
all.

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:30.109
To others you have to be kind, you have to
be sweet, you have to be patient, gentle.

00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:35.240
Now, today’s puja has to be very simple
because it is the puja of Guru, who is an

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.240
avadhuta.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:43.559
Avadhuta, as I told you, always teaches you
that the whole thing is futile, all this pattern

00:56:43.559 --> 00:56:44.720
is futile.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:50.329
He even doesn’t talk of any Deities, because
he says, “Alright, let’s worship the Abstract.

00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:52.480
Why talk of the Deity?”

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.690
Though they will talk of the Mother, alright.

00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:56.910
All of them talk of the Mother.

00:56:56.910 --> 00:57:00.940
But not of a Deity, because they think if
you talk of the Deity, people will talk more

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.289
about the Deity and not about the essence.

00:57:04.289 --> 00:57:05.579
But talk is a talk.

00:57:05.579 --> 00:57:15.819
Only at this stage you are prophets who are
talking about the Deities, and who are giving

00:57:15.819 --> 00:57:21.539
Realisation, and who know the Abstract is
flowing through them.

00:57:21.539 --> 00:57:23.960
You are empowered to do that.

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:27.859
You know all about Deities, and you know all
about their mantras and you know how to awaken

00:57:27.859 --> 00:57:30.339
them and you know about yourself.

00:57:30.339 --> 00:57:31.960
You are all very great.

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:36.219
This may be the last puja now in London.

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:49.259
As a great thing we are worshipping today
Guru Nanaka, that’s me [so] that – may

00:57:49.259 --> 00:57:56.650
you become great Guru Nanakas.

00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:01.339
All of them were created by Adi Shakti.

00:58:01.339 --> 00:58:04.920
All these Gurus were created by her.

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:15.609
And today I say that you all become as great
as Guru Nanak, as great as Moses, as great

00:58:15.609 --> 00:58:22.869
as Sai Nath, as great as Nanaka, Janaka, Mohammed.

00:58:22.869 --> 00:58:28.510
All [of you] have to become as great as all
these great incarnations.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:29.720
Just desire!

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:35.190
Have earnestness in you and alertness to achieve
it.

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:39.339
[Only] earnestness is not sufficient, you
have to be alert.

00:58:39.339 --> 00:58:46.109
I have already told you how to practice this
alertness.

00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:47.219
Try to do it.

00:58:47.219 --> 00:58:52.561
I have told Hari certain things, you can ask
him, and I have told other people also, how

00:58:52.561 --> 00:58:58.450
to become alert, and how to change your little
habits here and there.

00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:03.250
Anything overdoing should be stopped: taking
of too much tea, taking of too much milk,

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:04.680
eating too much, too much reading.

00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:08.230
Anything like that, just try to moderate.

00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:14.119
Moderation has to be brought in, and you will
be surprised [that] you can master your tongue,

00:59:14.119 --> 00:59:15.789
you can master it.

00:59:15.789 --> 00:59:24.119
May God bless you all, this day, in the name
of Nanaka I bless you all with that great

00:59:24.119 --> 00:59:31.759
Spirit of Master, which you all should become
– the great prophets who are going to change

00:59:31.759 --> 00:59:41.460
all the men of God into prophets.

00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:47.009
May God bless you!

00:59:47.009 --> 00:59:51.829
Today the puja has to be in a different way
if you don’t mind.

00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:59.729
Gavin, first of all you do me any favour.

00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:10.569
I have to tell you that today I want to give
some presents to you all and accordingly I

01:00:10.569 --> 01:00:15.289
have brought some presents for you all.

01:00:15.289 --> 01:00:22.239
Because these are material things, but all
are used by me, all are vibrated, and very

01:00:22.239 --> 01:00:25.150
spontaneously we are going to choose them
all.

01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:28.920
It was within two hours time we have done
some choosing.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:34.690
But in this one has to understand that it’s
all done just to express the Dhanesh Shakti

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:39.390
of the Mother, just that She loves to give.

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:45.329
She loves to give.

01:00:45.329 --> 01:00:50.819
Just out of joy that I had in Hampstead, I
felt I should now give you something.

01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:59.619
It’s beautiful there and that’s how we
have today tried to make some arrangement

01:00:59.619 --> 01:01:02.630
for that kind of a thing.

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:13.569
So just before the puja I wanted to announce
this and then we can have the puja – very

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:21.640
simple one, because today is a day of simplicity
– complete surrendering.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:36.660
Just imagine that these two colours are in
the Void, green and yellow, and if you mix

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:41.569
them what is the colour you get?

01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:43.280
Green and yellow?

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.549
You get the blue.

01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:50.390
So the green is the Nature.

01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:55.220
So an avadhuta has to become one with the
Nature.

01:01:55.220 --> 01:02:01.849
This is the sign of the Surya nadi, the Sun.

01:02:01.849 --> 01:02:10.700
That means an avadhuta has to be brilliant
like the Sun, brilliant like the Sun, and

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:15.599
that detached as the Sun is.

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:17.339
All the detachment must come into him.

01:02:17.339 --> 01:02:21.269
He need not have liver on Sun line.

01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:25.730
He will not have liver if he knows what to
eat and what not to eat.

01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:26.829
Normally all these gurus ate fruits, and they
ate meat, never fats and that’s how they

01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:27.829
kept their liver alright.

01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:37.410
This is, these are the two combinations which
are there in the Void.

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:42.160
And the combination of these two, when they
combine, it makes a blue.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.160
What is the blue?

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.160
Is the water.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.759
So, in the water.

01:02:45.759 --> 01:02:51.299
Now see the Gurus are surrounding the Lakshmi
on the Nabhi.

01:02:51.299 --> 01:02:57.079
On the Nabhi is the Lakshmi is in the centre
and they are surrounding her.

01:02:57.079 --> 01:02:59.089
They are her beauty.

01:02:59.089 --> 01:03:03.019
Without vairAgnya, without ascetic temperament,
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

01:03:03.019 --> 01:03:04.019
It has no meaning.

01:03:04.019 --> 01:03:05.779
It is expressed in giving, is giving.

01:03:05.779 --> 01:03:15.969
That is what it means, that without vairAgnya
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

01:03:15.969 --> 01:03:19.720
Without the feeling of giving Lakshmi has
no meaning.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.789
Why should Lakshmi come to anyone if they
do not want to give?

01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:27.593
And that is what one has to understand, is
the significance of giving.

01:03:27.593 --> 01:03:34.910
Now, today’s speciality is this, that: though
I am the Lakshmi – alright, I am the Mahalakshmi

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:41.490
in everything – but I am also Vairagyi,
I am the detached.

01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:44.829
The One who is Nirmama, is beyond.

01:03:44.829 --> 01:03:48.119
Nobody can tie me, nobody can.

01:03:48.119 --> 01:03:50.309
Nothing can bound me.

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:54.240
I just talk but it has no meaning, I am beyond.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:58.140
In the same way, all of you should try to
be beyond.

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:05.469
So, from the Lakshmi angle I want to give
you something, because Lakshmi looks after

01:04:05.469 --> 01:04:08.469
the saints, and the saints have to be detached.

01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:17.630
That is the way it is going to work out.

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:25.180
I hope you won’t go back and wear kashayas,
the orange robes (laughter).

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.700
Discretion, discretion, has to mature.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.700
It’s the maturity of discretion now.

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.830
So, now, for puja today, Chaya, let’s have
a very simple puja, whichever way you like.

01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:30.329
Now, have you got Guru’s names?

01:04:30.329 --> 01:04:31.880
Just see it, their name.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.400
That I know, Graham.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.900
Guillemette: Guillemette.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.140
Shri Mataji: Loudly.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.630
Guillemette: Guillemette.

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:41.869
Gavin Brown: Guillemette.

01:04:41.869 --> 01:04:46.770
Shri Mataji: How do you spell?

01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:52.369
Gavin Brown: G-u-i-l-l-e-m-e-t-t-e.

01:04:52.369 --> 01:05:03.560
Shri Mataji: What’s your name, please?

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.420
Loudly.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.150
Brian: Brian

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:14.750
Shri Mataji: Brian?

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:18.480
Rachel: Rachel

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:24.079
Shri Mataji: Rachel?

01:05:24.079 --> 01:05:27.810
Christopher: Christopher

01:05:27.810 --> 01:05:33.400
Shri Mataji: Christopher?

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.130
Christopher: Nicolas

01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:42.730
Shri Mataji: Nicolas.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:53.920
Shri Mataji: What’s your name please?

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:59.510
Richard: Richard Mother.

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:03.250
Bernard: Bernard

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:08.839
Shri Mataji: Bernard.

01:06:08.839 --> 01:06:12.569
What’s your?

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:16.300
Ian: Ian

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:29.359
Shri Mataji: Now who else is here?

01:06:29.359 --> 01:06:31.220
Eileen?

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:36.820
I now here.

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:41.789
You haven’t washed my hands?

01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:45.249
No, Isodor has.

01:06:45.249 --> 01:06:48.719
Alan you have?

01:06:48.719 --> 01:06:49.869
Never?

01:06:49.869 --> 01:06:53.339
Imagine! (laughter) Alright.

01:06:53.339 --> 01:06:57.660
So let’s have the start.

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:03.079
Gavin Brown: Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur
Devo Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat Parabrahma,

01:07:03.079 --> 01:07:04.079
Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma, Tasmai Guruve namaha.

01:07:04.079 --> 01:07:05.920
Shri Mataji: You all know the meaning of this?

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.920
Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur Devo Maheshwara.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:21.190
The Guru is the creator, Guru is the protector,
and Guru is the existence and the destroyer.

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:35.130
Guru is the embodiment of the Parabrahma,
it’s the beyond state.

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:42.900
And to such a Guru we bow.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:57.089
Just a little you can take it on your fingers
you can dip it, you see, and put it on your

01:07:57.089 --> 01:07:58.089
forehead, maybe.

01:07:58.089 --> 01:07:59.390
It’s a water which is now [vibrated].

01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:00.390
Haa!

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:02.900
You will feel better.

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:09.150
On the Sahasrara you can put it.

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:15.849
Just sprinkle it all over you can.

01:08:15.849 --> 01:08:18.719
Let him do.

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:23.739
Sprinkle it all over.

01:08:23.739 --> 01:08:29.829
Who are these?

01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:34.900
Maria is here.

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:37.799
Yes.

01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:55.210
Jaldi karo! (hindi: do it quickly)

01:08:55.210 --> 01:09:01.409
Five people together should come forward – alright?

01:09:01.409 --> 01:09:05.569
Come along!

01:09:05.569 --> 01:09:11.819
Five of you.

01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:13.900
Yes.

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:18.069
Come along!

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:29.120
Get your finger into there and to my hand.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.109
Turn it like that, clockwise, with both the
hands.

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:34.109
Alright.

01:09:34.109 --> 01:09:39.949
Now you rub your own hand.

01:09:39.949 --> 01:09:45.810
Now come along, you do it.

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:47.760
Come along.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.719
Rub it.

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:51.670
It’s good.
