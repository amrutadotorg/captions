WEBVTT

00:06.670 --> 00:13.740
Today is a special day of Guru Nanaka’s
birthday.

00:13.740 --> 00:27.730
We have celebrated one Guru puja and, as you
know that, Guru Nanak was also the incarnation

00:27.730 --> 00:29.380
of the Primordial Master.

00:29.380 --> 00:34.210
The same Spirit came on this Earth.

00:34.210 --> 00:46.379
And he’s the one who tried to re-establish
the work of Mohammed.

00:46.379 --> 00:57.430
Mohammed was the incarnation of the same Spirit
– the Primordial Master.

00:57.430 --> 01:02.510
He came on this earth to establish the religion.

01:02.510 --> 01:15.340
Islam is the name of that religion, is the
religion of every Sahaja Yogi, of every Christian,

01:15.340 --> 01:17.369
of every Hindu.

01:17.369 --> 01:31.530
We all belong to one religion which believes
in expanding our awareness to the new perception

01:31.530 --> 01:39.219
of collectivity.

01:39.219 --> 02:00.110
From human level to the higher level where
you can perceive and manifest the Divine Power.

02:00.110 --> 02:07.549
This is the religion we are following.

02:07.549 --> 02:16.849
All the religions were established on this
Earth to create the seekers.

02:16.849 --> 02:17.950
You are the seekers.

02:17.950 --> 02:20.250
You are the “men of God."

02:20.250 --> 02:27.010
Now, all of you have to become prophets.

02:27.010 --> 02:34.920
And to become prophets today’s Sahaja Yoga
has taken the form of Mahayoga.

02:34.920 --> 02:40.099
All of you have to become prophets.

02:40.099 --> 02:48.760
The prophets have two special qualities, as
all the prophets had: First of all, they have

02:48.760 --> 02:52.239
to talk about spiritual education.

02:52.239 --> 02:55.760
All of them did that.

02:55.760 --> 03:08.090
Mohammed Saheb did it, Raja Janaka did it,
Nanaka did it, Moses did it, Abraham did it.

03:08.090 --> 03:26.920
All of them prophesised and taught you how
to lead yourself in the right path, by the

03:26.920 --> 03:35.680
right action, by leading a right life.

03:35.680 --> 03:43.940
You are going to be the prophets of a little
different nature.

03:43.940 --> 04:02.450
You are prophets, you are Islamic, you are
Jews, you are Parsees, you are all those,

04:02.450 --> 04:21.799
but you are going to become prophets which
are called as “pir’ in Islam, in Hindu

04:21.799 --> 04:24.150
scriptures it’s called as “Atmasakshatkari’,
“Atmajas."

04:24.150 --> 04:42.140
In the way Nanaka has described, he calls
them “par."

04:42.140 --> 04:51.950
But you are endowed with a greater power.

04:51.950 --> 04:54.880
There’s more power in you.

04:54.880 --> 05:02.510
There they had a bigger propensity.

05:02.510 --> 05:11.380
You have another delicate power by which you
can raise the Kundalini of people.

05:11.380 --> 05:21.790
You are going to be prophets who are going
to make others prophets.

05:21.790 --> 05:29.870
Not only to establish religion but to make
them prophets.

05:29.870 --> 05:35.150
This is the most important thing.

05:35.150 --> 05:45.340
Not just to maintain a static state of righteous
religious good people but to evolve those

05:45.340 --> 05:52.460
seekers, those righteous, good, religious
people into prophets.

05:52.460 --> 06:04.210
And those prophets whom you will evolve will
also be the same type of prophets but they

06:04.210 --> 06:13.590
will also have this additional power by which
they will also evolve.

06:13.590 --> 06:17.210
That is why it is a Mahayoga.

06:17.210 --> 06:33.560
This is the greatest work in the history of
all spiritual history, that you are the prophets

06:33.560 --> 06:42.090
who are looking after the men of God, and
you are going to transform them into prophets.

06:42.090 --> 06:56.990
To have so many prophets now, for me – you
can’t imagine how happy I must be feeling.

06:56.990 --> 07:08.640
I have been, sometimes, very, very sharp with
you.

07:08.640 --> 07:12.570
Sometimes I had to goad you.

07:12.570 --> 07:23.510
Sometimes I had to love you, express my love
in that way, that you could feel that Mother

07:23.510 --> 07:27.790
is very kind.

07:27.790 --> 07:33.970
Sometimes I had to be very critical.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.310
Sometimes also angry.

07:35.310 --> 07:40.830
Behind all these aspects of your Mother, She
is nothing but Love.

07:40.830 --> 07:50.180
Because She loves you so much, and She knows
that you have to be the prophets.

07:50.180 --> 07:57.281
Your calibre may not be of the same level
as those prophets, maybe – you can’t say

07:57.281 --> 08:04.870
– but definitely you have got special powers.

08:04.870 --> 08:15.800
Like, you can say, an old Rolls Royce might
be a better car as far as the propensity goes,

08:15.800 --> 08:20.930
or an effect goes, or its behaviour goes – is
a good car.

08:20.930 --> 08:30.170
But one of the modern ones may have more capacity
to show new acrobats.

08:30.170 --> 08:39.409
For example it may tumble down, it may go
round the whole place and nothing will happen

08:39.409 --> 08:40.409
to it.

08:40.409 --> 08:47.490
Maybe, after some time, you might find a car
which goes half way and comes up a little,

08:47.490 --> 08:55.550
like a hovercraft and then goes in the air,
and then again drops back.

08:55.550 --> 09:14.850
So, this new generation of great prophets
are here before me.

09:14.850 --> 09:24.560
But the big difference between them and you
is this: that none of them had a Mother to

09:24.560 --> 09:38.500
guide them, to love them, to encourage them
when they were depressed, and also to spoil

09:38.500 --> 09:40.330
them.

09:40.330 --> 09:55.500
But you have here a Mother who may apparently
look to be spoiling her children.

09:55.500 --> 10:06.500
But She is the Master of Masters and She knows
how far to take them and how to correct them.

10:06.500 --> 10:15.160
Now, for all of you, I have to tell you that
you have to develop your independent discretion.

10:15.160 --> 10:24.050
First of all we have to know that, in this
new realm where you have entered, you have

10:24.050 --> 10:33.160
to have proper spiritual education, about
which I have given you so many lectures and

10:33.160 --> 10:34.269
things.

10:34.269 --> 10:41.649
But education doesn’t mean listening to
lectures after Realisation, it means it should

10:41.649 --> 10:50.810
be imbibed within you, it should penetrate
into your veins, and into your every artery,

10:50.810 --> 10:53.639
into every cell of your being.

10:53.639 --> 10:59.490
You have to educate yourself spiritually.

10:59.490 --> 11:12.160
And Guru Nanaka prophesised, just like William
Blake, that, “The men of God are going to

11:12.160 --> 11:19.519
come during Kali Yuga, and there will be many
prophets who will be transforming prophets,

11:19.519 --> 11:27.870
who will be transforming people into prophet
state,” [this] he had prophesised.

11:27.870 --> 11:33.069
They have all prophesised about you!

11:33.069 --> 11:41.020
Now you have to prophesise (sic) about those
who are going to be prophets.

11:41.020 --> 11:50.190
But, as it is, you know that we need spiritual
education.

11:50.190 --> 11:57.220
Because your Guru is a Mother we lack discipline.

11:57.220 --> 12:03.139
There’s complete freedom for all of you.

12:03.139 --> 12:08.589
You know that if you go to a guru what kind
of discipline you have to observe!

12:08.589 --> 12:13.300
I mean the real one, also.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.650
Unreal, of course.

12:15.650 --> 12:21.180
But even the real ones, how they test your
attention.

12:21.180 --> 12:27.449
Even for the smallest thing, how they treat
you.

12:27.449 --> 12:35.889
I’ll give an example of Ravi Shankar, who
was a very great, you know, who is a very

12:35.889 --> 12:46.730
great sitar player: my father was an advisor
to the Maharaja of Maihar where their guru

12:46.730 --> 12:50.180
(Allauddin Khan) was living.

12:50.180 --> 12:56.660
This guru was a Muslim but he used to worship
Kali, Mother.

12:56.660 --> 12:58.990
He used to worship Mother!

12:58.990 --> 13:00.730
And [a] very self disciplined man.

13:00.730 --> 13:09.270
They say he died at the age of 110 or 120
– Allauddin Khan Saheb.

13:09.270 --> 13:15.760
And this Ravi Shankar was there.

13:15.760 --> 13:22.690
I saw him as a young man, and this Ali Akbar
(Allauddin Khan’s son) whom you heard.

13:22.690 --> 13:26.029
They were literally frightened of their guru,
who was a master himself.

13:26.029 --> 13:31.360
He knew so many of these instruments.

13:31.360 --> 13:40.559
One day my father, whom he used to respect
very much, always used to bow to him, though

13:40.559 --> 13:46.050
he was a Muslim, they touched feet because
my father was a great connoisseur of music,

13:46.050 --> 13:53.279
and a supporter of music, and he bowed to
him and he said, “Now, should I play?”

13:53.279 --> 13:55.730
So he said, “Why not ask your disciple,
this Ravi Shankar, to play?”

13:55.730 --> 14:00.480
And he said, “Yes, yes, come along, play."

14:00.480 --> 14:01.480
he said, “Not today sir.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.880
Please, not today."

14:02.880 --> 14:05.470
he was very frightened.

14:05.470 --> 14:11.129
Then he said, “Alright, let it be!” he
started playing.

14:11.129 --> 14:12.980
He used to play on mrudangam.

14:12.980 --> 14:17.379
Used to play beautiful mrudangam – tremendous!

14:17.379 --> 14:22.160
I mean, you can’t imagine! he was a Realised-soul,
no doubt.

14:22.160 --> 14:29.459
Then Ravi Shankar, when he finished and he
bowed to my father and he went away.

14:29.459 --> 14:34.749
Then Ravi Shankar came to my father and he
said, “Don’t ask me to play before my

14:34.749 --> 14:37.940
guruji!” he lifted his head and said, “See
here.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.869
Do you see this bump?

14:39.869 --> 14:47.279
This morning only, he hit me with my sitar,
which he broke, and this is the bump I have

14:47.279 --> 14:48.279
got!”

14:48.279 --> 14:50.910
So my father said, “What did you do?”

14:50.910 --> 14:55.270
he said, “Only one note I played wrong!

14:55.270 --> 15:01.740
That too not wrong but little out of tune,
and on that point he has broken this part

15:01.740 --> 15:06.950
of my head and I have been in this terrible
pain and he said, “You are not to see any

15:06.950 --> 15:07.950
doctor!”

15:07.950 --> 15:08.950
And really there was a big bump.

15:08.950 --> 15:12.759
He had covered it like that, with the hair.

15:12.759 --> 15:24.569
(Laughter) That’s why today they have fame
as great masters, because to be masters you

15:24.569 --> 15:30.709
have to obey your master and to discipline
yourself.

15:30.709 --> 15:39.880
The spiritual education in Sahaja Yoga, under
Mataji Nirmala Devi, is absolutely left to

15:39.880 --> 16:00.620
your own wisdom: there is no force, there
is no compulsion, there is no organisation.

16:00.620 --> 16:09.959
It is you who has to feel the joy of your
Spirit and it is you who has to share it with

16:09.959 --> 16:10.959
others.

16:10.959 --> 16:19.540
It is you who has to raise the Kundalini of
others.

16:19.540 --> 16:39.290
Now, today, when we are thinking of a Great
Prophet who, on this Earth, came to establish

16:39.290 --> 16:45.540
good relationships between Hindus and Muslims.

16:45.540 --> 16:53.399
Imagine, when Mohammed Sahib came he did not
know that he was facing these horrible people

16:53.399 --> 16:56.730
there who murdered him.

16:56.730 --> 17:00.129
Actually they murdered him.

17:00.129 --> 17:03.529
They gave him poison.

17:03.529 --> 17:15.040
And when he died he said that, “There will
not be any need for any prophet to come in."

17:15.040 --> 17:20.060
Naturally, if you torture somebody, what else
he’s going to say?

17:20.060 --> 17:27.290
Also, he felt that whatever he has said, being
such a truth, it will definitely prosper and

17:27.290 --> 17:31.220
the seed has been sown.

17:31.220 --> 17:37.270
And he said, “There is no need for another
advent of a master."

17:37.270 --> 17:49.900
But he found out that there was a big aggression
by the so-called followers of Mohammed, who

17:49.900 --> 17:57.270
talked of nothing but rehmat (رحمت) – is
compassion.

17:57.270 --> 18:11.060
Now, before his death he encountered all kinds
of attacks from the negative people.

18:11.060 --> 18:16.950
Of all of them, the worst of all!

18:16.950 --> 18:19.140
I think he has suffered the worst.

18:19.140 --> 18:26.660
He had to move from places to places, hiding
the children away from negative forces, [from]

18:26.660 --> 18:27.800
tribes to tribes.

18:27.800 --> 18:43.450
It was a tremendous life, the way he led it.

18:43.450 --> 18:54.390
And all his life there was nothing but struggle
for existence.

18:54.390 --> 18:59.470
Only struggle for existence.

18:59.470 --> 19:16.410
When Nanaka came in, he saw that Hindus and
Muslims were fighting, so he started his theme

19:16.410 --> 19:30.000
with Kabira, saying that, “Ram and Rahim
are both the same, and how can you differentiate

19:30.000 --> 19:31.240
between the two?”

19:31.240 --> 19:37.150
All their theme was like this, of integration
of these two main religions which existed

19:37.150 --> 19:43.230
in India.

19:43.230 --> 19:46.090
That time, there was no question of giving
Realisation.

19:46.090 --> 19:53.020
People were trying to defend their faiths
and fight each other and kill each other.

19:53.020 --> 19:54.020
Imagine!

19:54.020 --> 19:56.110
Created by the same Spirit!

19:56.110 --> 19:57.320
Fighting among themselves!

19:57.320 --> 20:01.660
How silly it must be, and absurd.

20:01.660 --> 20:05.970
In many places Nanak Saheb has proved that
he was Mohammed.

20:05.970 --> 20:13.640
Once, he was lying down and his feet were
towards Mecca.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.030
So people said, “How can you put your feet
towards Mecca?”

20:16.030 --> 20:18.720
He had Muslim disciples and also Hindu disciples.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.050
He said, “Alright, whichever way you say,
I’ll put my feet."

20:21.050 --> 20:24.420
He turned round his feet.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.980
They said, “Still you are towards Mecca."

20:26.980 --> 20:33.650
He went round and round and round [but] still
they saw him facing Mecca!

20:33.650 --> 20:46.600
And they could not understand how it was that
he was facing, his feet were towards Mecca,

20:46.600 --> 20:49.360
that Mecca was at his lotus feet.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.480
Same with Mohammed.

20:52.480 --> 21:02.430
Now, all these great incarnations had a special
power over water.

21:02.430 --> 21:12.740
Because you know, in the stomach we have our
Void and Nabhi Chakra which is made of ocean.

21:12.740 --> 21:22.840
Ocean represents the incarnation of Adi Guru
– Dattatreya.

21:22.840 --> 21:27.420
These had great powers over oceans and over
water.

21:27.420 --> 21:35.540
Like Moses – he crossed the ocean by creating
a road.

21:35.540 --> 21:41.990
That’s one of the very significant things
which shows that the Void can be crossed with

21:41.990 --> 21:43.770
the help of the Guru.

21:43.770 --> 21:51.240
And even Mohammed Saheb had a tremendous power
over ocean.

21:51.240 --> 21:59.870
Then, Nanaka once put his hand on a rock and
water started coming out of that.

21:59.870 --> 22:04.870
People were amazed how it started.

22:04.870 --> 22:07.410
And that’s why it is called as ‘Punja-saheb’.

22:07.410 --> 22:08.970
‘Punja’ means ‘the hand’.

22:08.970 --> 22:11.030
‘Punja’ means ‘the five fingers’,
like this.

22:11.030 --> 22:20.950
What do you say to this, this part, [of the]
hand?

22:20.950 --> 22:24.810
Hand with five fingers?

22:24.810 --> 22:26.890
Yogis: This is the palm.

22:26.890 --> 22:28.450
Shri Mataji: No, no, not the palm!

22:28.450 --> 22:30.140
The whole thing.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.140
Like this is a punja.

22:31.140 --> 22:32.140
‘Hand’.

22:32.140 --> 22:33.140
Yogis: The hand.

22:33.140 --> 22:34.140
The open hand.

22:34.140 --> 22:37.830
Shri Mataji: But hand can be like this (a
fist) you see?

22:37.830 --> 22:38.830
This way.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.380
There’s no word, alright.

22:40.380 --> 22:42.850
So this is ‘punja’ – this is five.

22:42.850 --> 22:53.880
And ‘punjab’ is five waters, five rivers
– in that area – are called Punjab.

22:53.880 --> 23:01.060
Now, another thing about these: all these
incarnations had to deal with your attention.

23:01.060 --> 23:05.770
So they were particular about looking after
your attention.

23:05.770 --> 23:15.830
And that is why, from the time Moses or Abraham
came in, they talked of no alcoholism.

23:15.830 --> 23:19.450
All of them.

23:19.450 --> 23:26.960
It is written very clearly in The Bible that
the strong alcohols, fermented, should not

23:26.960 --> 23:27.960
be taken.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.870
If you don’t want to read it, one need not.

23:29.870 --> 23:34.920
But they think it was Moses who said it and
Christ did not say – so Christians can take

23:34.920 --> 23:36.900
it, the Moses people should not take it.

23:36.900 --> 23:42.890
There is no breaking of link between Moses
and Christ.

23:42.890 --> 23:47.260
They are of the same tree, of the same pattern,
of the same thing.

23:47.260 --> 23:54.870
But those who want to use Moses for their
own purpose will follow as much as Moses has

23:54.870 --> 24:00.780
said, and those who want to follow Christ
will follow only as much as Christ has said,

24:00.780 --> 24:03.610
because it’s very good for them.

24:03.610 --> 24:10.800
For such useless people Sahaja Yoga has no
place.

24:10.800 --> 24:20.160
We have to understand that all these people
have said for our good and for the maintenance

24:20.160 --> 24:28.330
of our spiritual life and none of them are
to be criticised or to be challenged but to

24:28.330 --> 24:32.790
be fully respected as our Guru.

24:32.790 --> 24:35.230
All of them.

24:35.230 --> 24:42.590
Whether one belongs to Islam religion or to
the Jew religion or to the Christian religion

24:42.590 --> 24:44.150
or to the Hindu religion.

24:44.150 --> 24:51.040
And if they are fanatic they are going against
their guru – it is against their guru.

24:51.040 --> 24:55.890
So, they were against fanaticism.

24:55.890 --> 24:57.840
First thing they were against [was] alcoholism.

24:57.840 --> 25:03.240
That’s the first thing, they thought, because
somehow human beings take to alcoholism very

25:03.240 --> 25:04.240
fast.

25:04.240 --> 25:10.280
At the time of Mohammed Saheb, people did
not know how to smoke.

25:10.280 --> 25:14.590
Then they developed, became modern.

25:14.590 --> 25:18.460
At the time of Nanaka they started smoking
so he prohibited that.

25:18.460 --> 25:26.030
But Mohammed Sahib said that, “Anything
that goes against your awareness, any intoxication

25:26.030 --> 25:37.840
of any kind” – he generally, he gave a
very general instruction, “is against God."

25:37.840 --> 25:47.430
So, our training, our spiritual education
should be that we cannot be fanatics anymore.

25:47.430 --> 25:56.140
If you are fanatic anymore, or you are identified
with any one of your old ideas, then beware!

25:56.140 --> 26:02.280
Be very, very careful!

26:02.280 --> 26:09.730
You cannot have fanatic ideas anymore if you
want to be a good Sahaja Yogi or a Maha Yogi

26:09.730 --> 26:18.100
– meaning a person who is a prophet, not
only a prophet, but who is capable of transforming

26:18.100 --> 26:24.210
others into prophets.

26:24.210 --> 26:28.910
First is, you have to be away from alcoholism.

26:28.910 --> 26:31.790
You should be deadly against it.

26:31.790 --> 26:40.070
Whenever you have a chance you find it that
it is possible for you to say something against

26:40.070 --> 26:41.070
alcoholism.

26:41.070 --> 26:45.420
It should be absolutely boycotted.

26:45.420 --> 26:58.210
Every place, anywhere you meet, it should
be smoking or any kind of intoxication, drugging,

26:58.210 --> 27:06.250
anything, has to be completely branded as
anti-God, anti-Sahaja Yoga.

27:06.250 --> 27:11.490
Then, fanaticism of any kind.

27:11.490 --> 27:12.950
That lingers on.

27:12.950 --> 27:17.320
This is another very deep misidentification.

27:17.320 --> 27:20.200
I am aware of it.

27:20.200 --> 27:29.110
I did not talk of Catholicism till the other
day I went to Portugal, when I had to talk.

27:29.110 --> 27:30.920
So I said [for the] first time.

27:30.920 --> 27:37.320
I never talked about Protestants before, till
I had to talk that they are another mad race

27:37.320 --> 27:38.320
going round!

27:38.320 --> 27:41.430
There are 27 churches of this kind.

27:41.430 --> 27:52.600
None of them, except for we, are really Christians.

27:52.600 --> 28:01.190
All are nonsensical fanatics: Seventh Day
Adventists and Pentecostals, and this and

28:01.190 --> 28:03.150
that.

28:03.150 --> 28:05.470
All are absurd ideas!

28:05.470 --> 28:09.890
All are playing into the hands of bhoots,
take it from me.

28:09.890 --> 28:12.980
They have nothing to do with God, they are
anti-God.

28:12.980 --> 28:21.270
All those who still stick on to all these
churches and to this kind of fanaticism – I

28:21.270 --> 28:28.650
am saying here of churches because here I
have to talk about churches – should know

28:28.650 --> 28:32.880
that all these churches have now become the
place of bhoots.

28:32.880 --> 28:39.650
You’ll go to one church and you’ll rush
to me!

28:39.650 --> 28:46.910
From my house I see in the night, hosts of
bhoots waiting out of the church.

28:46.910 --> 28:55.750
(Laughter) I do not know! (laughing) And somehow
it’s happening that, whatever house I decide

28:55.750 --> 28:56.750
to stay in, there’s a big church in front
of me.

28:56.750 --> 28:59.850
(Laughter) It may be a Catholic church, may
be a Protestant church.

28:59.850 --> 29:09.190
And they have seen to it that they make it
really bhootish by making all those who die

29:09.190 --> 29:13.410
stay in that church.

29:13.410 --> 29:16.970
They are not Realised people.

29:16.970 --> 29:22.050
Realised people only should be buried and
all others should be burnt off.

29:22.050 --> 29:23.050
It’s better.

29:23.050 --> 29:25.340
At least the bhoots go out of them.

29:25.340 --> 29:30.550
And they are roaming about in the church,
and you are taking the children down there

29:30.550 --> 29:32.480
into the cemetery!

29:32.480 --> 29:38.260
Apart from that wherever there is a anadhikaar
cheshta (अनधिकार चेष्टा

29:38.260 --> 29:42.270
meaning ‘unauthorised activity’) – when
it is unauthorised – Gods do not exist there.

29:42.270 --> 29:44.370
They leave the place.

29:44.370 --> 29:51.510
So, we have to know that we are no more fanatics.

29:51.510 --> 29:55.480
First and foremost thing is that we cannot
be fanatics.

29:55.480 --> 30:03.850
Now, training ourselves is very important,
spiritual education is very important.

30:03.850 --> 30:12.040
But in Sahaja Yoga, as your Mother is a very
kind teacher, but even such a kind teacher

30:12.040 --> 30:19.600
is not such a help sometimes because all corrections
are left to yourself, and then you commit

30:19.600 --> 30:24.860
really blunders and then you think, “Why
didn’t Mother tell us?

30:24.860 --> 30:28.280
Why didn’t She protect us, why didn’t
She correct?”

30:28.280 --> 30:35.520
But this is the style I have adopted because
in modern times, Sahaja Yoga is working out

30:35.520 --> 30:38.770
because I do not challenge your ego.

30:38.770 --> 30:43.890
Otherwise you would have crucified me long
time back.

30:43.890 --> 30:47.160
So I leave it to you to decide to discipline
yourself.

30:47.160 --> 30:52.250
It is for you to discipline yourself and understand
yourself.

30:52.250 --> 30:59.760
Now, the best way to discipline yourself is
to find out, “What’s wrong with me?”

30:59.760 --> 31:00.760
Not with others.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.280
We are very good at that.

31:02.280 --> 31:06.590
I have seen every day there’s some complaint
about somebody coming from someone.

31:06.590 --> 31:15.570
But there are very few who will say, “This
is wrong with me, Mother, what to do?”

31:15.570 --> 31:19.660
So just try to find out what is wrong with
you.

31:19.660 --> 31:22.110
You are like a fort.

31:22.110 --> 31:27.120
The fort has some sort of a weakness.

31:27.120 --> 31:35.330
So, the man in charge of the fort – what
do you call him?

31:35.330 --> 31:42.310
We call kiledaar ( किलेदार ) because
a fort is kila and the gentleman is the owner

31:42.310 --> 31:44.830
of the kila, is called as kiledaar.

31:44.830 --> 31:53.720
Now, this kiledaar finds out what are the
weak points of the fort and he sees to it

31:53.720 --> 31:56.270
that they are all corrected one by one.

31:56.270 --> 32:00.400
We are just the other way round.

32:00.400 --> 32:05.420
We know we have weaknesses which we hide and
keep them there as they are.

32:05.420 --> 32:12.040
Whatever strong points we have that we boast
of and we try to see the weaknesses of others,

32:12.040 --> 32:18.950
and from these loopholes all these negative
things creep in and suddenly you find that

32:18.950 --> 32:21.650
you are finished.

32:21.650 --> 32:28.410
So try to find out what are your weaknesses.

32:28.410 --> 32:37.160
One of the weaknesses, which is very common
is that we are very materialistic people,

32:37.160 --> 32:42.690
we are still very materialistic, extremely
materialistic.

32:42.690 --> 32:50.600
And the materialism is getting subtler and
subtler the subtler we be.

32:50.600 --> 32:53.100
Try to give up some things.

32:53.100 --> 33:03.220
Keep a kind of a little balanced attitude,
a little detached attitude, not too many things.

33:03.220 --> 33:07.630
Few things of value.

33:07.630 --> 33:09.030
Try to detach yourself.

33:09.030 --> 33:11.190
I don’t say you become sanyasis.

33:11.190 --> 33:14.030
That is also another thing against.

33:14.030 --> 33:17.520
But from inside you detach.

33:17.520 --> 33:29.950
See, I’m wearing a very nice sari, but from
inside see what is the colour.

33:29.950 --> 33:31.280
(Laughter)

33:31.280 --> 33:36.510
From inside you should be detached, not from
outside.

33:36.510 --> 33:40.650
So that, try to practice this detachment.

33:40.650 --> 33:44.770
Whatever you want to possess, you just don’t
possess.

33:44.770 --> 33:48.270
Teach your body, teach your mind: “No!

33:48.270 --> 33:51.460
You want a shirt?

33:51.460 --> 33:53.390
No!Nothing doing!”

33:53.390 --> 33:54.390
You try.

33:54.390 --> 33:56.290
Train up your body.

33:56.290 --> 34:01.440
Now some people want comfort, the body wants
comfort.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.240
Alright, “You want comfort?

34:04.240 --> 34:10.450
No, I will sleep on the ground and teach you
a lesson!”

34:10.450 --> 34:13.609
Teach your body a lesson!

34:13.609 --> 34:17.179
Teach your wants and desires a lesson!

34:17.179 --> 34:19.639
Let’s see what happens.

34:19.639 --> 34:25.490
Now, I don’t know why, but in England it
should not be so.

34:25.490 --> 34:29.710
I mean I expected people absolutely detached
because they have got everything.

34:29.710 --> 34:34.720
But here it is much more attachment than detachment.

34:34.720 --> 34:39.099
There is no satisfaction of any kind.

34:39.099 --> 34:53.869
So, a kind of a detachment must be developed,
to your desires, to your belongings, to your

34:53.869 --> 35:01.009
possessions and whatever kind of a material
aspect you want to build up.

35:01.009 --> 35:09.029
I always said that you must not look like
people who are coming from the lunatic asylum,

35:09.029 --> 35:16.099
that’s true, but you should also not look
like a dandy person, with a flair, a big bow

35:16.099 --> 35:19.640
here, and a sort of a thing.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.579
You should be in the centre.

35:21.579 --> 35:26.990
And how are you in centre?

35:26.990 --> 35:28.230
When you are detached.

35:28.230 --> 35:29.780
Then nothing can impress you.

35:29.780 --> 35:37.109
But that doesn’t mean…some people I’ve
seen that outside they make a show, that they

35:37.109 --> 35:43.140
are absolutely dishevelled, absolutely in
a very filthy condition, smelling like pigs.

35:43.140 --> 35:46.880
(Laughter) They think they are going to take
an avatara of Varaha (boar incarnation of

35:46.880 --> 35:51.819
Shri Vishnu) by smelling like pigs!

35:51.819 --> 35:59.520
And all sorts of funny things they do in the
name of detachment.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.069
No – detachment is within.

36:02.069 --> 36:06.869
Try to practice it.

36:06.869 --> 36:10.299
That is one of the educations you have to
develop.

36:10.299 --> 36:12.599
How do you develop that detachment?

36:12.599 --> 36:16.349
Is by giving things away.

36:16.349 --> 36:20.549
Not to me, but giving things away to others.

36:20.549 --> 36:24.619
Say you reach a certain state of – say you
have two suits.

36:24.619 --> 36:28.070
If you have a third one then give it away.

36:28.070 --> 36:29.109
Give away things.

36:29.109 --> 36:37.499
It’s a very good way of developing detachment,
and enjoying the giving away than possessing.

36:37.499 --> 36:45.360
It’s greater, is much greater, take it from
me, is much greater than possessing.

36:45.360 --> 36:57.049
Now for you, at this stage, I cannot say,
but maybe after some time, it will become

36:57.049 --> 37:04.000
that I prophesise that you will become sinless,
absolutely sinless.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.730
You cannot do sin and whatever you do will
not be sin.

37:07.730 --> 37:09.910
I am sinless.

37:09.910 --> 37:15.980
Even if I rob you of all your wealth nobody
can say I have committed sin.

37:15.980 --> 37:19.190
I am absolutely sinless.

37:19.190 --> 37:26.400
Even if I kill thousands and thousands of
people nobody would say that I have killed

37:26.400 --> 37:28.180
because I am sinless.

37:28.180 --> 37:39.160
But, despite all that state, I do not commit
any so-called sin because I have to lay down

37:39.160 --> 37:44.640
my life in such a way that you people follow.

37:44.640 --> 37:50.759
That you should not tomorrow say that, “Mother
did this, She has done this so why not we?”

37:50.759 --> 37:53.569
That’s why I’m so very particular.

37:53.569 --> 38:03.480
At the same point I would like to tell you
that today Chaya, in her sweetness, went and

38:03.480 --> 38:06.089
bought a very expensive sari.

38:06.089 --> 38:15.160
And she brought with such love and affection
to me, that I had told her just buy me a £10

38:15.160 --> 38:20.630
worth of a shawl and she couldn’t bear the
idea.

38:20.630 --> 38:30.710
But she should know [that] for me anything
is valuable that you give to me.

38:30.710 --> 38:33.569
Nothing expensive is needed.

38:33.569 --> 38:41.150
Even if you give me the most expensive I have
every right on that.

38:41.150 --> 38:49.680
But you must understand that if this practice
is continued too much it will create a bad

38:49.680 --> 38:50.680
public opinion.

38:50.680 --> 38:57.690
So, at the most, definitely decide that you’ll
give me only two saris, that’s all.

38:57.690 --> 39:00.519
I don’t need even these two.

39:00.519 --> 39:01.770
And I can have all of them.

39:01.770 --> 39:07.560
So, the situation is such that we have to
be very careful about the public opinion,

39:07.560 --> 39:10.000
and people may start saying tomorrow, “Oh!

39:10.000 --> 39:12.910
Mother, She wears all expensive saris."

39:12.910 --> 39:17.950
Let my husband buy for me, he has lots of
money!

39:17.950 --> 39:21.410
And you can buy me very ordinary things.

39:21.410 --> 39:25.089
And I told once Modi that, “You buy me khadi
(homespun) saris, that’s the best,” but

39:25.089 --> 39:26.200
he couldn’t bear it.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.470
It was too much for him.

39:27.470 --> 39:33.150
He says that, “Mother, we are middle class
people and we are giving you something middle

39:33.150 --> 39:34.150
class."

39:34.150 --> 39:35.150
I said, “Alright."

39:35.150 --> 39:38.450
So, once for all I told them, “Alright,
you buy some saris."

39:38.450 --> 39:42.800
And then I bought for them, one of them is
this one, and I don’t know if the whole

39:42.800 --> 39:44.720
money is paid – most of the money I have
paid.

39:44.720 --> 39:50.710
But still, you know, there was somebody who
came out with an objection!

39:50.710 --> 39:58.490
I know you love me very much and you want
to do something for me like that, but I would

39:58.490 --> 40:06.150
request that try to get things which are sober
and simple for me.

40:06.150 --> 40:12.739
By God’s Grace, you should know your Mother
is looked after, you don’t have to worry.

40:12.739 --> 40:23.400
Supposing I was a beggar then you would have
had to spend much more money but that is not

40:23.400 --> 40:24.400
so.

40:24.400 --> 40:28.000
And it is not that it is in any way wrong,
on the contrary, it’s a very great thing.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.960
After all these are going to be in your Mother’s
personal archives and people are going to

40:32.960 --> 40:38.150
see what saris you people gave me, and they’re
going to be very happy – of course, no doubt

40:38.150 --> 40:40.850
– and that’s going to be very, very great
for you.

40:40.850 --> 40:47.260
But, still, where the public is concerned
you be careful and understand that when you

40:47.260 --> 40:54.930
do anything like that for me, this public
is mad and we have to keep a proper balance.

40:54.930 --> 41:06.519
Now, about training yourself, as I said, detachment,
then another thing is astuteness – astuteness.

41:06.519 --> 41:12.789
Try to develop astute habits – astute – specially
for religious work.

41:12.789 --> 41:19.760
First of all understand that you have to give
some money for Sahaja Yoga work.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.530
In that you should be astute.

41:21.530 --> 41:28.050
I was amazed to hear from some people that
for food also you want to have free – that

41:28.050 --> 41:31.279
sometimes you had food you didn’t pay even
one pound.

41:31.279 --> 41:33.010
I mean this is absurd.

41:33.010 --> 41:39.210
If you were beggars is alright, but for Sahaja
Yoga, first of all, it’s not too much.

41:39.210 --> 41:42.140
But little you have to pay.

41:42.140 --> 41:44.529
And you should not make your Mother pay for
you.

41:44.529 --> 41:45.529
It’s wrong.

41:45.529 --> 41:49.960
I never said this before, but today I’m
telling you.

41:49.960 --> 41:54.920
Not aesthetically, but spiritually it is wrong
that I should pay for you.

41:54.920 --> 42:00.130
It’s alright – I may give you a dinner,
it’s different, I may give you anything,

42:00.130 --> 42:07.020
it’s different, but that you should not
try to take advantage in any way or exploit

42:07.020 --> 42:16.539
in any way this Mother of yours, who has got
lots of things other than what you know of,

42:16.539 --> 42:19.970
which can work out against your spiritual
growth.

42:19.970 --> 42:23.450
So just don’t do anything like that.

42:23.450 --> 42:25.890
No exploitation.

42:25.890 --> 42:28.339
Learn that.

42:28.339 --> 42:33.190
Those who have done such a thing must decide
that no more like that.

42:33.190 --> 42:38.609
Now, I’ll tell you a difference between
Indians and you people is this: that an Indian

42:38.609 --> 42:40.890
would never do that.

42:40.890 --> 42:46.539
We had one Indian coming here and he was not
such a big Sahaja Yogi, but he used to come

42:46.539 --> 42:50.740
for his puja, and he would not take money
for his puja and these people had to fight

42:50.740 --> 42:51.740
with him.

42:51.740 --> 42:53.549
Ask him, he’s sitting down, he would not
take.

42:53.549 --> 42:58.269
But how materialistic we are!

42:58.269 --> 43:03.910
And then, when people mesmerise you then you
buy a Rolls Royce for that person, and here

43:03.910 --> 43:09.550
a Mother is giving you all the freedom, so
you are exploiting your Mother!

43:09.550 --> 43:14.250
“I have no job,” all this is wrong.

43:14.250 --> 43:18.680
You must pay for your food, and must pay where
you have to pay.

43:18.680 --> 43:23.020
That’s your dharma, that’s your religion,
of every Sahaja Yogi.

43:23.020 --> 43:28.960
Alright, you need not pay too much, but you
must pay where it has to be paid.

43:28.960 --> 43:31.900
And never take a parasitic attitude.

43:31.900 --> 43:36.289
That will kill your growth, will dwarf you.

43:36.289 --> 43:39.430
I am warning you about it.

43:39.430 --> 43:40.430
Astuteness.

43:40.430 --> 43:46.079
For payment, for accounting, for everything,
one has to be extremely astute.

43:46.079 --> 43:51.609
Like, I’ll tell you, I have seen people
used to come to my house, long time back – I

43:51.609 --> 43:55.589
shouldn’t say this but [it] used to be so
funny – they would go in the kitchen, take

43:55.589 --> 43:58.470
out anything, eat anything, walk off anywhere.

43:58.470 --> 44:00.609
It was amazing!

44:00.609 --> 44:02.160
Our cooks could not understand.

44:02.160 --> 44:03.430
Nobody could understand such people.

44:03.430 --> 44:09.359
Just coming in the house, walking into the
kitchen, taking off whatever they like, eat

44:09.359 --> 44:10.359
anything.

44:10.359 --> 44:11.359
Like bounders!

44:11.359 --> 44:23.920
This training has to come within you where
you must realise and understand that astuteness

44:23.920 --> 44:29.239
towards Sahaja Yoga has to be maintained.

44:29.239 --> 44:37.529
Like going into the ashram, walking into somebody’s
kitchen, taking out things.

44:37.529 --> 44:44.440
Using the ashram in a state as if it does
not matter.

44:44.440 --> 44:45.440
It’s ashram!

44:45.440 --> 44:47.660
It’s a pure thing.

44:47.660 --> 44:49.670
You cannot fight in an ashram.

44:49.670 --> 44:52.359
You cannot talk loudly in an ashram.

44:52.359 --> 44:55.019
You have to lead a pure life in an ashram.

44:55.019 --> 44:57.759
You cannot play games with each other.

44:57.759 --> 44:59.400
You cannot make it dirty.

44:59.400 --> 45:03.489
You cannot spoil it, otherwise your spiritual
growth won’t come up.

45:03.489 --> 45:09.099
This is the simplest thing one should know,
is to respect Sahaja Yoga.

45:09.099 --> 45:12.109
Love without respect has no meaning.

45:12.109 --> 45:16.789
You have to respect, and respect the place,
respect everything.

45:16.789 --> 45:21.289
Keep it clean, be astute about it.

45:21.289 --> 45:24.130
And this is one of the greatest trainings.

45:24.130 --> 45:30.049
I don’t know how, but to a British mind
it should not be told, because they are known

45:30.049 --> 45:31.660
for this kind of a training!

45:31.660 --> 45:43.119
But I don’t know, because now you are saints,
I think, I feel that you have had other kind

45:43.119 --> 45:48.480
of training before, that you are born as saints.

45:48.480 --> 45:57.670
Perhaps you have no self-esteem yet, of the
value that should be given to your own character.

45:57.670 --> 46:02.369
Without that, nobody is going to be impressed
by you.

46:02.369 --> 46:05.140
Nobody is going to be impressed by you.

46:05.140 --> 46:06.920
Nobody is going to become a prophet.

46:06.920 --> 46:09.750
You have to first of all impress.

46:09.750 --> 46:12.810
You have to dress up in such a way that you
impress others.

46:12.810 --> 46:17.770
It’s a very important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

46:17.770 --> 46:20.529
You have to talk in such a way that you impress
others.

46:20.529 --> 46:25.839
Supposing somebody’s very fat, he must reduce,
somebody’s very thin, he must put on.

46:25.839 --> 46:28.859
He must try to have a body of the centre.

46:28.859 --> 46:33.970
Should not allow the body to move this way
or that way.

46:33.970 --> 46:41.599
One has to be in a proper shape, in proper
dress, because you have to impress on others.

46:41.599 --> 46:46.230
You must know that if the personality is not
impressive how are you going to communicate?

46:46.230 --> 46:51.749
Because first of all the people see you, those
of you who come to you, see your outside.

46:51.749 --> 46:55.859
They don’t see your vibrations they see
your outside.

46:55.859 --> 47:04.119
So, all of you must learn how to dress up
and how to behave towards others, how to appear

47:04.119 --> 47:10.400
before others, how to talk to others, so that
you become prophets who will do wonders and

47:10.400 --> 47:18.770
who will transform many, many, many more people
into the same state as you are.

47:18.770 --> 47:24.259
Now, this training you have to take yourself.

47:24.259 --> 47:30.099
The another point in training in Sahaja Yoga
is that you have to read.

47:30.099 --> 47:39.589
There are many people who have not read even
Gregoire’s book, leave alone any other.

47:39.589 --> 47:47.789
You have to learn certain things like chakras
and centres and mantras and you have to dedicate.

47:47.789 --> 47:52.692
Even people like Vivekanada’s who never
got Realisation – do you know, these people,

47:52.692 --> 47:57.319
twelve people – they used to study for fourteen
hours.

47:57.319 --> 48:06.309
Now you will know what to study, what not
to study, and even if you study wrong things,

48:06.309 --> 48:07.309
you will know where it is wrong.

48:07.309 --> 48:08.309
So you have to study.

48:08.309 --> 48:11.609
For example, there are Jews with us – let
them study Torah and see there where is it,

48:11.609 --> 48:12.920
Sahaja Yoga, in there written down.

48:12.920 --> 48:14.540
Find it out!

48:14.540 --> 48:18.249
If you are Christians read the Bible, find
out.

48:18.249 --> 48:22.720
You should read Gita, you should read Upanishadas,
and you should be masters.

48:22.720 --> 48:30.099
You’ll find that Sahaj Yoga is such a light
that you will know what it is.

48:30.099 --> 48:36.589
We have got the Devi’s names and the Sahastranamas:
try to read them and try to understand the

48:36.589 --> 48:40.460
meaning of that and try to understand what
it means, how far it goes.

48:40.460 --> 48:45.970
That’s how the depth of your knowledge will
increase and your Sahaja Yoga will tell you

48:45.970 --> 48:51.619
what is right and what is wrong.

48:51.619 --> 48:57.479
Now emotionally, some of you have terribly
emotional weaknesses: the idea of ‘love’.

48:57.479 --> 49:04.970
[About] that I must speak to you because it
has come from a group of people who went into

49:04.970 --> 49:07.680
another style against the ego-oriented people.

49:07.680 --> 49:12.290
And they believe that love means hugging each
other, kissing each other.

49:12.290 --> 49:16.460
This type [of] nonsense is not love.

49:16.460 --> 49:25.119
Love is this, that flows, that is love.

49:25.119 --> 49:28.170
And understand the person through this alone.

49:28.170 --> 49:34.260
And all nonsensical loves that people talk
of is not love.

49:34.260 --> 49:40.519
When a person loves you he doesn’t stare
into you.

49:40.519 --> 49:51.160
If somebody stares into you then know he does
not love you – he’s full of a bhoot.

49:51.160 --> 49:59.239
Only when a realised soul is angry he stares
to drive out the badhas.

49:59.239 --> 50:05.079
So, anybody who stares into your eyes and
says, “I have love,” then know that it

50:05.079 --> 50:06.089
is mesmerism.

50:06.089 --> 50:16.050
With discretion you will know this: that anybody
who loves, only a glance is sufficient.

50:16.050 --> 50:28.749
But when it is an anti-Christ activity going
on then you can stare at that person and the

50:28.749 --> 50:30.229
thing increases.

50:30.229 --> 50:36.940
So the idea of love is so absurd.

50:36.940 --> 50:46.650
Love is the one that corrects, that improves,
that elevates, which is blissful.

50:46.650 --> 50:53.279
The relationship is blissful, not hallucinations.

50:53.279 --> 51:01.619
And this blissfulness is only felt through
vibrations not through by hugging or by kissing

51:01.619 --> 51:08.080
or anything, just through vibrations.

51:08.080 --> 51:13.750
Of course, I don’t say you should not hug
each other and you should not kiss each other

51:13.750 --> 51:16.980
– you should, but that’s not the way it
is expressed, it’s through the vibrations.

51:16.980 --> 51:25.099
It’s the pure love of your being which emits
just like light.

51:25.099 --> 51:34.859
Everything should be done in the proper education
of the spiritual love.

51:34.859 --> 51:39.569
We are people of dignity and sobriety.

51:39.569 --> 51:42.569
I have told you this before.

51:42.569 --> 51:46.529
Like, some people have a habit of doing this
in the — no!

51:46.529 --> 51:57.450
If you are sitting in a posture try to sit
for at least an hour – try.

51:57.450 --> 52:04.640
I have sat on one posture for nine hours,
people have seen: didn’t go to bathroom

52:04.640 --> 52:07.369
or eat anything and just sitting there nine
hours.

52:07.369 --> 52:13.410
This is known as baithak is ‘the seat’.

52:13.410 --> 52:18.269
And this baithak has to be great in Sahaja
Yoga.

52:18.269 --> 52:23.819
Try to establish your baithak, that is very
important, so that your attention is brought

52:23.819 --> 52:29.390
in line with your Mooladhara and is straight
there.

52:29.390 --> 52:38.630
Once you do that, practice it, you will find
your spiritual growth would be better.

52:38.630 --> 52:41.859
Walk erect, be straight.

52:41.859 --> 52:46.309
In your talks be straight, kind and gentle.

52:46.309 --> 52:47.640
Need not shout.

52:47.640 --> 52:54.089
No Sahaja Yogi should shout at anybody else,
should play games with another, should not

52:54.089 --> 53:01.920
in any way be angry with each other – is
prohibited.

53:01.920 --> 53:07.930
Should not get into any tantrums of pulling
your hair or doing something like that – is

53:07.930 --> 53:09.020
all nonsensical.

53:09.020 --> 53:11.650
You have to be very, very dignified.

53:11.650 --> 53:22.050
But another foxy method which we employ very
much is to tease and provoke another Sahaja

53:22.050 --> 53:27.539
Yogi, which is even worse, because it hits
you at a subtler point.

53:27.539 --> 53:31.779
Try to be straight, straightforward.

53:31.779 --> 53:37.989
Allow your mind to come to normal when you
talk.

53:37.989 --> 53:47.059
If you have to say something, wait and try
to say something nice, not artificial.

53:47.059 --> 53:53.609
Try to say something from your heart, not
to show off.

53:53.609 --> 54:01.329
In talking also too much quietness is not
good, too much talking is not good.

54:01.329 --> 54:06.269
Some suffer from too much talking and some
do not talk at all.

54:06.269 --> 54:12.170
It’s better to talk whenever it is necessary.

54:12.170 --> 54:18.400
Talk something sweet, no sharpness and sarcasm.

54:18.400 --> 54:21.359
That will spoil your Vishuddhi.

54:21.359 --> 54:25.050
Sarcasm is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

54:25.050 --> 54:30.359
You are not to be sarcastic to each other.

54:30.359 --> 54:41.319
Because of a new generation and a new race
that you are, you have to learn that to keep

54:41.319 --> 54:47.450
your vibrations alright you have to have collectivity
within you.

54:47.450 --> 54:53.190
Because you are collectively so much charged
that’s why the Kundalini’s rising.

54:53.190 --> 55:02.619
If your collectivity breaks then it’s a
very, very, very, very wrong thing.

55:02.619 --> 55:10.329
So, try to be nice to each other, kind to
each other, try to understand each other’s

55:10.329 --> 55:11.329
problem.

55:11.329 --> 55:19.789
And never, never complain to me about any
other Sahaja Yogi – till I ask.

55:19.789 --> 55:22.130
It’s prohibited!

55:22.130 --> 55:27.160
If you have to say, tell me about yourself.

55:27.160 --> 55:31.950
Unless and until of course something happens,
then it’s alright, but not against anyone.

55:31.950 --> 55:38.259
Because you will only see the bad points of
the another person and you will not imbibe

55:38.259 --> 55:39.450
the good points.

55:39.450 --> 55:46.390
You have to meditate and think about what
you have to do to become the real prophets

55:46.390 --> 55:50.219
of modern times of Mahayoga.

55:50.219 --> 55:55.359
How you have to dress up, how you have to
behave, how you have to talk, and how you

55:55.359 --> 56:02.089
have to be kindly, that you have to decide.

56:02.089 --> 56:15.300
On this day, I would say that I have talked
a lot and only thing that you have to do is

56:15.300 --> 56:19.890
to imbibe it in you and not on others, that’s
all.

56:19.890 --> 56:30.109
To others you have to be kind, you have to
be sweet, you have to be patient, gentle.

56:30.109 --> 56:35.240
Now, today’s puja has to be very simple
because it is the puja of Guru, who is an

56:35.240 --> 56:36.240
avadhuta.

56:36.240 --> 56:43.559
Avadhuta, as I told you, always teaches you
that the whole thing is futile, all this pattern

56:43.559 --> 56:44.720
is futile.

56:44.720 --> 56:50.329
He even doesn’t talk of any Deities, because
he says, “Alright, let’s worship the Abstract.

56:50.329 --> 56:52.480
Why talk of the Deity?”

56:52.480 --> 56:53.690
Though they will talk of the Mother, alright.

56:53.690 --> 56:56.910
All of them talk of the Mother.

56:56.910 --> 57:00.940
But not of a Deity, because they think if
you talk of the Deity, people will talk more

57:00.940 --> 57:04.289
about the Deity and not about the essence.

57:04.289 --> 57:05.579
But talk is a talk.

57:05.579 --> 57:15.819
Only at this stage you are prophets who are
talking about the Deities, and who are giving

57:15.819 --> 57:21.539
Realisation, and who know the Abstract is
flowing through them.

57:21.539 --> 57:23.960
You are empowered to do that.

57:23.960 --> 57:27.859
You know all about Deities, and you know all
about their mantras and you know how to awaken

57:27.859 --> 57:30.339
them and you know about yourself.

57:30.339 --> 57:31.960
You are all very great.

57:31.960 --> 57:36.219
This may be the last puja now in London.

57:36.219 --> 57:49.259
As a great thing we are worshipping today
Guru Nanaka, that’s me [so] that – may

57:49.259 --> 57:56.650
you become great Guru Nanakas.

57:56.650 --> 58:01.339
All of them were created by Adi Shakti.

58:01.339 --> 58:04.920
All these Gurus were created by her.

58:04.920 --> 58:15.609
And today I say that you all become as great
as Guru Nanak, as great as Moses, as great

58:15.609 --> 58:22.869
as Sai Nath, as great as Nanaka, Janaka, Mohammed.

58:22.869 --> 58:28.510
All [of you] have to become as great as all
these great incarnations.

58:28.510 --> 58:29.720
Just desire!

58:29.720 --> 58:35.190
Have earnestness in you and alertness to achieve
it.

58:35.190 --> 58:39.339
[Only] earnestness is not sufficient, you
have to be alert.

58:39.339 --> 58:46.109
I have already told you how to practice this
alertness.

58:46.109 --> 58:47.219
Try to do it.

58:47.219 --> 58:52.561
I have told Hari certain things, you can ask
him, and I have told other people also, how

58:52.561 --> 58:58.450
to become alert, and how to change your little
habits here and there.

58:58.450 --> 59:03.250
Anything overdoing should be stopped: taking
of too much tea, taking of too much milk,

59:03.250 --> 59:04.680
eating too much, too much reading.

59:04.680 --> 59:08.230
Anything like that, just try to moderate.

59:08.230 --> 59:14.119
Moderation has to be brought in, and you will
be surprised [that] you can master your tongue,

59:14.119 --> 59:15.789
you can master it.

59:15.789 --> 59:24.119
May God bless you all, this day, in the name
of Nanaka I bless you all with that great

59:24.119 --> 59:31.759
Spirit of Master, which you all should become
– the great prophets who are going to change

59:31.759 --> 59:41.460
all the men of God into prophets.

59:41.460 --> 59:47.009
May God bless you!

59:47.009 --> 59:51.829
Today the puja has to be in a different way
if you don’t mind.

59:51.829 --> 59:59.729
Gavin, first of all you do me any favour.

59:59.729 --> 01:00:10.569
I have to tell you that today I want to give
some presents to you all and accordingly I

01:00:10.569 --> 01:00:15.289
have brought some presents for you all.

01:00:15.289 --> 01:00:22.239
Because these are material things, but all
are used by me, all are vibrated, and very

01:00:22.239 --> 01:00:25.150
spontaneously we are going to choose them
all.

01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:28.920
It was within two hours time we have done
some choosing.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:34.690
But in this one has to understand that it’s
all done just to express the Dhanesh Shakti

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:39.390
of the Mother, just that She loves to give.

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:45.329
She loves to give.

01:00:45.329 --> 01:00:50.819
Just out of joy that I had in Hampstead, I
felt I should now give you something.

01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:59.619
It’s beautiful there and that’s how we
have today tried to make some arrangement

01:00:59.619 --> 01:01:02.630
for that kind of a thing.

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:13.569
So just before the puja I wanted to announce
this and then we can have the puja – very

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:21.640
simple one, because today is a day of simplicity
– complete surrendering.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:36.660
Just imagine that these two colours are in
the Void, green and yellow, and if you mix

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:41.569
them what is the colour you get?

01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:43.280
Green and yellow?

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.549
You get the blue.

01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:50.390
So the green is the Nature.

01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:55.220
So an avadhuta has to become one with the
Nature.

01:01:55.220 --> 01:02:01.849
This is the sign of the Surya nadi, the Sun.

01:02:01.849 --> 01:02:10.700
That means an avadhuta has to be brilliant
like the Sun, brilliant like the Sun, and

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:15.599
that detached as the Sun is.

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:17.339
All the detachment must come into him.

01:02:17.339 --> 01:02:21.269
He need not have liver on Sun line.

01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:25.730
He will not have liver if he knows what to
eat and what not to eat.

01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:26.829
Normally all these gurus ate fruits, and they
ate meat, never fats and that’s how they

01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:27.829
kept their liver alright.

01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:37.410
This is, these are the two combinations which
are there in the Void.

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:42.160
And the combination of these two, when they
combine, it makes a blue.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.160
What is the blue?

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.160
Is the water.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.759
So, in the water.

01:02:45.759 --> 01:02:51.299
Now see the Gurus are surrounding the Lakshmi
on the Nabhi.

01:02:51.299 --> 01:02:57.079
On the Nabhi is the Lakshmi is in the centre
and they are surrounding her.

01:02:57.079 --> 01:02:59.089
They are her beauty.

01:02:59.089 --> 01:03:03.019
Without vairAgnya, without ascetic temperament,
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

01:03:03.019 --> 01:03:04.019
It has no meaning.

01:03:04.019 --> 01:03:05.779
It is expressed in giving, is giving.

01:03:05.779 --> 01:03:15.969
That is what it means, that without vairAgnya
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

01:03:15.969 --> 01:03:19.720
Without the feeling of giving Lakshmi has
no meaning.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.789
Why should Lakshmi come to anyone if they
do not want to give?

01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:27.593
And that is what one has to understand, is
the significance of giving.

01:03:27.593 --> 01:03:34.910
Now, today’s speciality is this, that: though
I am the Lakshmi – alright, I am the Mahalakshmi

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:41.490
in everything – but I am also Vairagyi,
I am the detached.

01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:44.829
The One who is Nirmama, is beyond.

01:03:44.829 --> 01:03:48.119
Nobody can tie me, nobody can.

01:03:48.119 --> 01:03:50.309
Nothing can bound me.

01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:54.240
I just talk but it has no meaning, I am beyond.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:58.140
In the same way, all of you should try to
be beyond.

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:05.469
So, from the Lakshmi angle I want to give
you something, because Lakshmi looks after

01:04:05.469 --> 01:04:08.469
the saints, and the saints have to be detached.

01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:17.630
That is the way it is going to work out.

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:25.180
I hope you won’t go back and wear kashayas,
the orange robes (laughter).

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.700
Discretion, discretion, has to mature.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.700
It’s the maturity of discretion now.

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.830
So, now, for puja today, Chaya, let’s have
a very simple puja, whichever way you like.

01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:30.329
Now, have you got Guru’s names?

01:04:30.329 --> 01:04:31.880
Just see it, their name.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.400
That I know, Graham.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.900
Guillemette: Guillemette.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.140
Shri Mataji: Loudly.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.630
Guillemette: Guillemette.

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:41.869
Gavin Brown: Guillemette.

01:04:41.869 --> 01:04:46.770
Shri Mataji: How do you spell?

01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:52.369
Gavin Brown: G-u-i-l-l-e-m-e-t-t-e.

01:04:52.369 --> 01:05:03.560
Shri Mataji: What’s your name, please?

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:05.420
Loudly.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.150
Brian: Brian

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:14.750
Shri Mataji: Brian?

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:18.480
Rachel: Rachel

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:24.079
Shri Mataji: Rachel?

01:05:24.079 --> 01:05:27.810
Christopher: Christopher

01:05:27.810 --> 01:05:33.400
Shri Mataji: Christopher?

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.130
Christopher: Nicolas

01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:42.730
Shri Mataji: Nicolas.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:53.920
Shri Mataji: What’s your name please?

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:59.510
Richard: Richard Mother.

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:03.250
Bernard: Bernard

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:08.839
Shri Mataji: Bernard.

01:06:08.839 --> 01:06:12.569
What’s your?

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:16.300
Ian: Ian

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:29.359
Shri Mataji: Now who else is here?

01:06:29.359 --> 01:06:31.220
Eileen?

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:36.820
I now here.

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:41.789
You haven’t washed my hands?

01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:45.249
No, Isodor has.

01:06:45.249 --> 01:06:48.719
Alan you have?

01:06:48.719 --> 01:06:49.869
Never?

01:06:49.869 --> 01:06:53.339
Imagine! (laughter) Alright.

01:06:53.339 --> 01:06:57.660
So let’s have the start.

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:03.079
Gavin Brown: Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur
Devo Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat Parabrahma,

01:07:03.079 --> 01:07:04.079
Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma, Tasmai Guruve namaha.

01:07:04.079 --> 01:07:05.920
Shri Mataji: You all know the meaning of this?

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.920
Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur Devo Maheshwara.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:21.190
The Guru is the creator, Guru is the protector,
and Guru is the existence and the destroyer.

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:35.130
Guru is the embodiment of the Parabrahma,
it’s the beyond state.

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:42.900
And to such a Guru we bow.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:57.089
Just a little you can take it on your fingers
you can dip it, you see, and put it on your

01:07:57.089 --> 01:07:58.089
forehead, maybe.

01:07:58.089 --> 01:07:59.390
It’s a water which is now [vibrated].

01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:00.390
Haa!

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:02.900
You will feel better.

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:09.150
On the Sahasrara you can put it.

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:15.849
Just sprinkle it all over you can.

01:08:15.849 --> 01:08:18.719
Let him do.

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:23.739
Sprinkle it all over.

01:08:23.739 --> 01:08:29.829
Who are these?

01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:34.900
Maria is here.

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:37.799
Yes.

01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:55.210
Jaldi karo! (hindi: do it quickly)

01:08:55.210 --> 01:09:01.409
Five people together should come forward – alright?

01:09:01.409 --> 01:09:05.569
Come along!

01:09:05.569 --> 01:09:11.819
Five of you.

01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:13.900
Yes.

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:18.069
Come along!

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:29.120
Get your finger into there and to my hand.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.109
Turn it like that, clockwise, with both the
hands.

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:34.109
Alright.

01:09:34.109 --> 01:09:39.949
Now you rub your own hand.

01:09:39.949 --> 01:09:45.810
Now come along, you do it.

01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:47.760
Come along.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.719
Rub it.

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:51.670
It’s good.
