00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:05.460
Shri Hanumana had attained it.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.720
Just as Anjani Devi (Mother of Shri Hanumana)
had attained it.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.280
Like Anjani Devi and Hanumana, if we can,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.570
see the Spirit residing in our heart,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.500
if we get our Self-Realization,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.920
then there will be no question standing before us.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.280
All pain, wretchedness, poverty can go far away.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.050
We have many principles within us.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.259
They are still in the dormant state.

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:39.809
They should get awakened.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.780
Unless they get awakened, there is no meaning of our lives.

00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:48.852
Our connection with God Almighty has not been established until now.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.100
Till our relationship with God Almighty is not established,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.950
how we will enter then into His Kingdom?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.364
And how we will get the boons that He wants to bestow upon us.

00:00:58.523 --> 00:01:00.970
That's why our relationship with God Almighty

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.600
has to be established and has to be everlasting.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.610
This is the main thing, that it has to be ever-lasting.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.350
If meaninglessly we repeatedly call Vitthala

00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:17.588
and if He comes and stands before you, how will you recognize Him?

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.930
Thus, the Apara Bhakti which exists

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.830
and which is done without seeing, without knowing God Almighty,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.330
its fruit is today our Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:43.070
To Ganesha we say,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.480
that, "Spontaneously we dived into the current

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.880
so at the time of salvation, You protect us".

00:01:49.158 --> 00:01:51.288
The time of salvation has arrived today.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.882
It must be preserved and we should stay forever in it.

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:57.610
For that there is no need to give money.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.250
God doesn't know what to do with money.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.602
This many people may not know that to God money is unknown.

00:02:04.803 --> 00:02:07.710
Now we went to rural places and told them, “See,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.930
you should not give us money or anything like that."

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.290
So they said, "Instead of 10 paisa should we give 20?"

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.850
Does God understand money?

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.550
When Shri Rama has come here,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.320
did He know what for are the money?

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.080
Otherwise, there is an example of Hanumana,

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.310
that Sitaji gave Him a big necklace of gold,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.750
and He was breaking every jewel seeing into it.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.670
They said, "Why are You breaking these golden balls?"

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.300
He said, "I'm seeing if there is Shri Rama in it or not?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.150
In none of it is Shri Rama."

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.160
The whole gold He thought was useless and He threw it away.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.140
Because Shri Rama was not there the gold was useless.

00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:44.137
This is what Hanumana showed you.

00:02:44.336 --> 00:02:46.629
Hence, Shri Ram who is residing within us,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.700
has to be attained by us.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.900
And after travelling in Shri Rama's kingdom,

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.750
all our sorrows will end. This we know.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.310
And that happens.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.530
I want to tell you of a recent miracle.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.240
It doesn't mean that you should believe in it,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.150
but, it can happen, and has happened

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.270
and similarly all of you should get your wellbeing

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.830
and all of you should be happy.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.260
That's why God has made this plan,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.190
that "My devotees who are living in India,

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.720
who have kept so much faith in God Almighty,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.360
should verily get this.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.490
They should verily get this. They should be blessed,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.790
that your benevolence should manifest.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.900
You should attain God.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.560
I'll tell you an experience.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.850
There is a small village called as Kalwa.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.490
A householder by the name Rajaram Patil stays there.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.150
He was very humbly placed in life, his situation was very humble.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.421
And he used to attend My program

00:03:47.652 --> 00:03:51.273
and would bring along his son and other fellows.

00:03:51.474 --> 00:03:54.190
So he used to bring his family and friends from Kalwa,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.447
and would bring garlands and things for Me. I said, "Rajaram Patil,

00:03:57.648 --> 00:04:00.909
at least allow Me to pay for your conveyance, it's too much for you.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.910
You feel like meeting Me is alright but how do you manage this?"

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.355
He said, "God arranged everything for me, Mother."

00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:08.000
I asked him, "What happened?"

00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:10.244
He said, “I had a small uncultivated plot of land.

00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:13.079
There, I do meditation in the morning.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.453
One day a man came and said, "Your land has some special properties.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.841
Using this soil,

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:24.920
someone told me that the bricks become like stones.

00:04:25.094 --> 00:04:27.420
That's why we have come here to see it.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.840
And this soil we shall buy in units of share (measuring unit).

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.600
That land which he thought was barren and has abandoned,

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.109
it got transformed into gold.

00:04:36.284 --> 00:04:39.061
This golden Dwarika, God can establish for you,

00:04:39.262 --> 00:04:41.530
if you attain God.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.920
His principle is extremely great. Many people just do not accept.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.524
Educated people do not accept that there is some Power of God.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.920
Now, just see around, all these trees that we see

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.009
where do they come from? Who made them green?

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.590
Who produces mangoes in a mango tree?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.710
Why does it not bear any other fruit?

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.180
All this is being done by the Divine Power.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.580
And you are going to witness today
if this Divine Power exists or not.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.734
And when that Divine Power of God will come in you

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.430
then the dormant, extremely

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.390
deep type of principles, even the principle of Lakshmi itself,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.050
will get awakened and your life will change tremendously.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.160
People got many benefits out of Sahaja Yoga. First and foremost is

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.400
that people have attained physical well being.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.750
Physical illnesses get cured.

00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:37.655
Because of that plenty of our money and

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.200
troubles get saved.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.290
Then, many people who have mental problems get cured.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.550
Then, many who have intellectual problems are saved from them.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.798
You are luckily not so highly educated,

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:53.405
having less intellectual problems.

00:05:53.606 --> 00:05:56.180
Highly educated people have plenty of intellectual problems.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.911
So, lacking those problems is a good thing.

00:06:01.103 --> 00:06:03.520
And, after that

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.000
those people

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.200
who have Lakshmi problems (financial problems), that also gets solved.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.349
This way, many problems which we are in fear of, get destroyed,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.180
and we enter into the Kingdom of God

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.600
and there we live in peace and joy.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.168
This is Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:23.343 --> 00:06:25.827
and no matter how much is told about it, it's still too less.

00:06:26.028 --> 00:06:31.790
I mean I'm constantly, daily, giving one lecture.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.060
And at every place,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.260
I speak so much and still people say that I have said something new.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.963
So, there is no end to it.

00:06:39.106 --> 00:06:42.411
If you have any question, please ask Me now.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.819
He was Pawan Putra (Son of Wind God), isnt it?

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:00.879
So the wind is blowing.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.880
Ha, if there are any questions, you should ask.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.760
Are there no questions?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.860
Some questions should be asked, isn't it?

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.130
O.k. Now I'll tell you one question.

00:07:35.792 --> 00:07:37.623
One question which should be asked is,

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:39.859
"Mataji how does this all happen?

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.370
How does it take place?" Shouldn't we ask such a question?

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.100
Just because somebody says something, we should not believe it.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.820
You should ask, "How can it be like this? You say so,

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.560
all these big stories are true or not?"

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.650
So within us there is one such power,

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.060
which is known as Kundalini.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.457
She resides at the base of our spine in the triangular bone,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.440
coiled like a serpent.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.000
She is stationed as a power in the shape of three and a half coils.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.120
This power is called as Kundalini.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.046
And since immemorial times She has been described

00:08:19.247 --> 00:08:22.438
by Dattatreya and so on.

00:08:22.653 --> 00:08:27.363
It is described in many books. Markandeya existed 1400 years back.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.600
Even he has described Kundalini.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.530
In the Devi Mahatmyam and Devi Puran that he has written

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.834
he has described the Kundalini.

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:39.870
This power is in a dormant state within us,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.740
because this power is our pure desire, our true desire.

00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:50.021
Now we think that our true desire means that today

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.550
if we have a house is enough, It is not so.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.359
If you get the house then you want to have a vehicle.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.400
After the vehicle you want to have children.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.287
After children you want something else.

00:08:59.488 --> 00:09:02.650
So which is the pure, true desire?

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.190
She is a power within us. Pure desire is

00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.261
that our relationship with God Almighty

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.434
should be established,

00:09:11.635 --> 00:09:13.869
that we should meet God Almighty,

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.990
that our connection (Yoga) with God Almighty should be established.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.680
This is the pure desire and it has not yet been awakened.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.590
She is the Kundalini power which resides in our triangular bone.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.060
If She gets awakened then this work manifests.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.370
And many times She will also be visible to your eyes.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.620
In the triangular bone She is working like a heart,

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.650
because She pulsates.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.030
And if that Kundalini power gets awakened,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.880
the cool breeze of the divine power starts flowing in our hands.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.513
and you experience chaitanya which spreads in all four directions.

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:50.460
This Divine Power which is working in all four directions

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.420
which does all the Divine work,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.400
is first and foremost experienced.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.310
And how to do it? That in short words,

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.497
I am thinking to do it now. But if you have questions better ask.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:14.910
Ask, ask because otherwise your attention remains there, I've seen.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.480
Ask, ask.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.770
Ask. A question or so should be asked.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:33.100
S: (Inaudible)

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.450
SM: [unclear]

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.913
S: The road going to and from the Hanuman Temple and vehicle -

00:10:42.114 --> 00:10:46.101
these issues raised by the Trust;
will this pure desire get fulfilled?

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.040
SM: It will happen.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.230
But it is not such a big issue.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.056
Road for going to Hanumana will be made. You do not know,

00:10:55.257 --> 00:10:58.040
many things will come to this country,

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.520
but with that your satisfaction will not be gained.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.670
This is the main thing to be told.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.590
The road will be built, everything will happen,

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.079
maybe here one of our ashrams will also be built.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.060
Something will happen, quite a lot will happen.

00:11:11.261 --> 00:11:13.200
but still it will not bring any satisfaction.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.740
Satisfaction will come after attaining God.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.870
Means what? What will happen?

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.430
The biggest thing is that all your addictions will drop off.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.220
For attaining Hanumana the addictions should be dropped, shouldn't they?

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.829
If we have all the addictions how will Hanumana be pleased with us?

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.370
And if you want to go to the temple, go there, get your legs broken,

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.800
and finally what will you get?

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.470
Then I will ask one question on behalf of God.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.540
First your addictions should go away, shouldn't they?

00:11:45.065 --> 00:11:50.680
To get the blessings of God, should
we not be capable of receiving them?

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.790
As I said, first you get that capability.

00:11:53.936 --> 00:11:55.426
That's Mother's work, so I'll do it.

00:11:55.627 --> 00:11:57.493
Hanumana's mother did everything she could.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.269
Now, let your Mother do what She wants to do.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.570
That capability you should attain and then everything will happen.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.800
Then whatever you say will happen.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.680
But first shall we not enter into the Kingdom of God?

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:14.382
Now ask the second question. The question was too good.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.980
I'm a Mother after all. so there is no problem in asking Me any question.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.890
Mother is all ours. We ask her all the questions, don't we?

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.490
If we don't ask Mother, then whom shall we ask?

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.960
Yes ask some more.

00:12:28.157 --> 00:12:30.490
S: What should be done for raising the Kundalini?

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.125
SM: That's the right question.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.501
That I will do. I'll tell you about, but otherwise?

00:12:34.702 --> 00:12:38.190
Right. He asked the right question. This is a seeker's question.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.390
This is the right question. For that very little has to be done.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.054
She rises spontaneously.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.932
As if there is some seed. If we want to sprout it, what do we do?

00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:48.912
You will say, "Plant it in the Mother Earth".

00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:52.570
It's just like that. This is the work of the Mother Earth.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.610
It happens spontaneously.

00:12:54.869 --> 00:12:58.185
"Saha-ja", "Saha" means: born with you.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.401
This Kundalini is born with you.

00:13:00.575 --> 00:13:02.561
And the connection that you get with Her,

00:13:02.724 --> 00:13:05.129
is your right, it's your birth right.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.555
Getting the connection established is your birth right.

00:13:07.756 --> 00:13:09.613
That you should take.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.004
Once you get enlightened, just like a lamp enlightens another one,

00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:18.730
similarly you can enlighten others also.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.280
Just a little bit of it you should know.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.670
Small children can also do it. Everyone can do it.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.952
Now ask one more question and then we will do it.

00:13:31.127 --> 00:13:32.952
S: Provision for water also?

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.570
SM: Yes, everything.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.620
Everything that you have asked for, is material.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.519
Provision for water should be made, there's so much poverty,

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.020
there's so much distress.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.310
If I'm to speak, the village from where my father hailed,

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.392
I'd been to that village...

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:53.145
L: What is this Sahaja Yoga?

00:13:54.526 --> 00:13:57.100
SM: What did she say?

00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:06.458
What do you want, tell Me.

00:14:07.985 --> 00:14:11.375
What did she say? Her language is different.

00:14:11.576 --> 00:14:14.265
How should a person get rid of Tamo guna?

00:14:14.464 --> 00:14:17.170
How can we establish oneness and affection with others?

00:14:17.371 --> 00:14:20.647
The Tamo-guna that exists in a person, how can it be reduced?

00:14:20.812 --> 00:14:23.237
And, how can a person experience oneness with others.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.090
SM: That's right. That's a very nice question.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.814
His question is related to dharma,

00:14:28.053 --> 00:14:30.999
that how can we get the feeling of love for others.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.480
Because of Tamo-guna we don't feel love for others;

00:14:34.681 --> 00:14:39.729
also because of Rajo-guna when people become bumptious.

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.750
Then how does this happen?

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.020
Now, these people are here from 14 countries.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.670
They have love for you. They came here to meet you.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.240
But you people lack oneness. What's the reason for that?

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.440
Now see this finger of Mine;

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.344
if it gets hurt,

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.400
I don't need to tell anyone, because if I get hurt,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.090
then I will soothe it and relieve it Myself.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.070
Isn't it? Because it's My own finger.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:12.822
Similarly, you are part and parcel of the Viratha Purusha.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.200
All of you are! But still the awareness is missing,

00:15:17.618 --> 00:15:21.750
the awareness that we are part and parcel of Almighty God

00:15:21.988 --> 00:15:23.555
This awareness is missing.

00:15:23.763 --> 00:15:26.466
The moment this Realization takes place,

00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:28.509
the cool breeze comes in your hands,

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.690
and a new awareness gets awakened.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.990
Now, we have various awarenesses.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.828
Compared to animals we are much more evolved.

00:15:38.035 --> 00:15:39.273
Evolution has taken place.

00:15:39.474 --> 00:15:41.070
Suppose an animal is told,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.660
"You walk across this filth", it will walk across.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.881
But, if you tell a human being, he won't be able to.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.910
But, when you realize your Self

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:55.817
then, the first and foremost awareness that you get is,

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:00.080
that we all are part and parcel of the same Being.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.830
On you fingers you will know

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.530
what problems a person is having.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.690
What problems does a person have?

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.670
His stomach is paining. You'll be sitting and you'll say,

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.970
"Do you have a headache?", "How do you know?".

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.440
Means, "I know it through my fingers".

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.440
Your fingers  will start speaking

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.870
and you will know that he has that problem,

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.140
that his one chakra or another is catching.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.320
That means that the collective consciousness gets awakened.

00:16:26.658 --> 00:16:28.091
Who is the other?

00:16:28.292 --> 00:16:30.781
It is told to Me, "Mataji, You have done lot of favors",

00:16:30.982 --> 00:16:32.391
but who is the other?

00:16:32.592 --> 00:16:35.300
If everyone is part and parcel of our being, then who is the other?

00:16:35.492 --> 00:16:37.572
If you are having any pain I'll also get the pain.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.870
If I remove my own pain then what favor have I bestowed upon you?

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.020
So, this awareness is not yet awakened in us.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.230
Once it gets awakened,

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.452
we'll give our life for each other because as our nose, eyes, mouth

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.260
is all ours, similarly all these people are also ours;

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.410
this awareness comes into us.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.520
This is an awareness and it comes within us.

00:17:01.702 --> 00:17:07.842
This is the transition from the state of "human" to "super-human".

00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:10.878
When a human becomes a super-human

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.060
then we realize what are the troubles of others.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.940
This awareness has to be awakened.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.880
And that will happen.

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.709
Then there will be love among us. Jealously, hatred, all will go.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.195
Because we are all one, we should help each other.

00:17:27.396 --> 00:17:29.758
Because we are one, one and the same being.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.080
But because this awareness is not yet awakened,

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.900
due to the ignorance,

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.201
this knowledge has to be awakened within,

00:17:36.402 --> 00:17:38.223
we should feel it on our central nervous system.

00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:40.960
On your fingers you should feel it.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.310
It should be felt. Jaaniv, is a very good Marathi word.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.440
You should know it, not with your brain,

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.760
like saying "we are brothers and sisters" and then start quarrelling.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:55.070
We should feel it from within.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.500
This will happen in the whole universe.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.429
All right? Very nice question.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.245
Such thought should exist

00:18:05.446 --> 00:18:07.344
that there should be oneness between all of us.

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.550
We are all one, but due to the ignorance,

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.270
blind people always feel that we are all different.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.160
But once we get the vision then we are all one,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.460
then there is no difference.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.280
As they say Avya(Spirit) has no caste.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.710
The one who becomes a Yogi, to him caste and so on. has no meaning.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.090
It's all the same.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.920
O.k. now, what has to be done for it?

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.919
First of all I'm a Mother, so no need of wearing a cap in front of Me.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.223
You sit straight as you sit in front of your mother.

00:18:40.424 --> 00:18:43.346
Sit as you sit in front of your mother, absolutely simple and sober.

00:18:43.547 --> 00:18:47.157
There should be no difficulty in it. Sit in a very simple posture.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.851
How do we sit in front of our mother?

00:18:49.052 --> 00:18:52.527
Think of it while sitting in front of Me.

00:18:52.755 --> 00:18:55.741
You should have the same kind of love that you have for your mother.

00:18:55.942 --> 00:18:57.309
All our work is that of love.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.657
So we should sit in complete love.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.436
Now, just place both the hands like this on your lap, slowly.

00:19:05.635 --> 00:19:08.043
Place them like this slowly.

00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:16.501
Quietly.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.440
And now we should close our eyes. Everybody should close the eyes.

00:19:40.842 --> 00:19:43.866
No giggling. See,

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:47.141
it's not going to work out like this. Be quiet,

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.960
we are doing Divine work, aren't we?

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.970
Close your eyes. Close your eyes and sit down.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.950
What's there to giggle in closing your eyes?

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.680
Because of this in our villages,

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.500
that's why it doesn't work out in villages.
