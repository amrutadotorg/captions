00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:17.741
The sign of life is that it goes against the matter,

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:21.007
the one that is jara.

00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:33.329
Like the tree goes against the gravity;

00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:42.310
like the great human beings have lifted their body

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.529
against the gravity in a straight posture.

00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:59.788
In the same way, if you see, the flame goes against the gravity.

00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:11.393
Nobody has heard of fire going from the top floor to the ground floor.

00:01:16.654 --> 00:01:20.785
It starts from the ground floor and it goes upward.

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:31.486
But the fire also comes from the matter which is burning.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.732
So the matter has to be burnt, if you want to rise.

00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:52.554
If your attention is all the time towards baser things,

00:01:52.554 --> 00:02:00.534
materialistic things, towards physical pleasures, you cannot rise.

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:14.843
You may do any amount of meditations, use My Photographs, come to My Pujas

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:17.481
but if your attention is imbedded

00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:23.487
it's like you are standing on a crocodile trying to get into a boat.

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:45.372
Now, that doesn't mean when a flame burns it gives up matter,

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:55.388
but it gets detached and it burns it.

00:02:59.697 --> 00:03:06.374
So this body, this mind, this ego, this superego,

00:03:06.622 --> 00:03:13.881
is all to be burned to keep this flame burning all the time.

00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:26.737
You don't have to give up anything

00:03:26.608 --> 00:03:31.371
but to use the same thing for a higher life,

00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:46.188
and that is what should be the aim of every Sahaja Yogi.
