00:00:47.906 --> 00:00:51.952
Today I just thought that there are

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:54.827
quite a lot of people who have come for the first time.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.499
And I should tell them about

00:00:58.313 --> 00:01:01.859
the significance of Puja.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.716
Because, as the western style of life is,

00:01:08.622 --> 00:01:13.047
that they're meant to be like this.

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:18.416
To seek something outside, to go outside,

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:22.478
find out new ways and methods to grow outside.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.212
Now this is the knowledge of your roots.

00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:31.761
Knowledge, through which you receive your nourishment,

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.613
this knowledge is not known to you before

00:01:37.044 --> 00:01:39.645
and was not deliberately told

00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:43.055
because you are supposed to grow outside.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.224
Now when you have to go inside, then you have to understand

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:53.175
the divine laws and divine methods, how it works out.

00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:57.138
The Puja has a significance,

00:01:57.427 --> 00:02:01.385
from ancient times the saints described them.

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:04.518
Because in India, the whole climate is such

00:02:04.768 --> 00:02:08.007
that you can live under a tree,

00:02:08.532 --> 00:02:11.352
live in a forest no problem,

00:02:11.553 --> 00:02:15.115
you can eat fruits and very happily you could be in a forest.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.166
There is no need to have bed or anything, it is so warm and nice,

00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:23.416
and then always enjoy the bliss of a forest.

00:02:24.432 --> 00:02:27.824
And thus many people went into the forest

00:02:28.057 --> 00:02:32.236
and started thinking, looking at the whole world from that

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:35.509
solitude,

00:02:35.907 --> 00:02:37.395
what is the problem with human being?

00:02:37.603 --> 00:02:38.993
Why are we here?

00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:40.909
What should we do?

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.787
What is the purpose of this human life?

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.657
Why God has given us this beautiful human life?

00:02:46.857 --> 00:02:48.981
They started thinking about it.

00:02:49.224 --> 00:02:52.093
And that is how they went into meditative position,

00:02:52.294 --> 00:02:56.076
meditative entry within themselves.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:03:00.037
And when they started meditating, they found all about Kundalini,

00:03:00.238 --> 00:03:04.301
about chakras and the deities that reside on them.

00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:08.902
Now, these deities have resided from eternal times.

00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:13.923
We can say in the abode of God they have all resided there

00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:18.652
and then they were reflected on this Earth

00:03:19.147 --> 00:03:23.878
and they incarnated just to give us

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:26.897
a better and better awareness.

00:03:27.295 --> 00:03:29.759
We could have avoided all this.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.837
It could have been very easy

00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:37.701
if we had listened to God at the time of Adam and Eve.

00:03:38.052 --> 00:03:40.805
At the time of Adam and Eve,

00:03:41.165 --> 00:03:45.910
it was told that you should not eat the fruit of knowledge.

00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:49.110
Now, that was not the fruit of the true knowledge,

00:03:49.344 --> 00:03:52.956
but the fruit of knowledge was the knowledge about the matter,

00:03:53.157 --> 00:03:55.375
the knowledge about things.

00:03:55.601 --> 00:04:00.724
So, as you know, the story is, satanic forces worked,

00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:04.529
they lured both of them and they started

00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:08.716
developing themselves on the other side.

00:04:09.201 --> 00:04:10.935
That is how they made a mistake.

00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:13.958
That is why it is called as original sin.

00:04:14.243 --> 00:04:17.747
And that original sin has brought us to this brink now,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.660
and we have to go back.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.031
We have to go back within ourselves to find our roots.

00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.248
And that is why to improve

00:04:25.448 --> 00:04:28.540
on their mistakes and to improve on their ignorance

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.317
that is how the first ignorance was set in.

00:04:33.637 --> 00:04:37.019
The darkness of ignorance was set in because of that mistake.

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.692
And then from darkness we had to come to human stage.

00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:43.438
And when we have to come to human stage, we have to pass

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.795
through all those different various stages of life where

00:04:50.732 --> 00:04:53.107
incarnations had to take place.

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:55.460
So, now, as as you know very well,

00:04:55.903 --> 00:05:00.037
that we have incarnations placed within our centres

00:05:00.343 --> 00:05:03.210
which are not yet awakened.

00:05:03.772 --> 00:05:06.917
That means they are not in our attention.

00:05:07.117 --> 00:05:10.659
They are not to be felt in our central nervous system.

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:14.949
Or we cannot feel them on our finger tips, to be very very simple.

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:19.651
So they are there, but they are not acting according to our desire.

00:05:19.851 --> 00:05:23.073
We do not know them and they do not listen to us.

00:05:23.273 --> 00:05:27.276
They do what is right for them or what they think is proper.

00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:30.640
You have no connection with them so far.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.039
So, the first thing is to connect yourself

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.556
with those different stages through which you have passed.

00:05:38.757 --> 00:05:41.156
So, the first as you know is the Ganesha's stage,

00:05:41.378 --> 00:05:44.071
it is innocence. Innocence, the

00:05:44.272 --> 00:05:48.198
formless of innocence was made into Shri Ganesha,

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.190
because some nucleus has to emit that innocence.

00:05:55.424 --> 00:05:58.275
Now, in the whole world

00:05:58.713 --> 00:06:02.607
there are eight such creations of the Mother Earth,

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.453
and luckily they are in Maharastra.

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.788
You will find Maharastrian people on the whole are innocent,

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:13.244
compared to others, they are rather innocent by nature.

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:17.917
And the reason is from the Mother Earth only the innocence is emitted.

00:06:18.237 --> 00:06:21.380
So the first thing is that within us to establish innocence

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.606
we have to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:06:23.807 --> 00:06:26.008
So, when you worship Me as Shri Ganesha,

00:06:26.208 --> 00:06:29.002
the Shri Ganesha within you is awakened.

00:06:29.228 --> 00:06:31.682
You see the result of that.

00:06:31.937 --> 00:06:33.579
So, the people who are suffering,

00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:38.617
say, from the trouble of all these perversions,

00:06:38.817 --> 00:06:41.423
these modern diseases that have come,

00:06:41.665 --> 00:06:43.524
must establish their Shri Ganesha.

00:06:43.724 --> 00:06:47.350
If they cannot establish their Shri Ganesha, they cannot be cured.

00:06:47.623 --> 00:06:50.385
So their innocence has to be first established.

00:06:50.747 --> 00:06:53.007
If he cannot establish their innocence,

00:06:53.207 --> 00:06:54.966
we cannot cure them.

00:06:55.166 --> 00:06:58.581
First and foremost thing is to establish Shri Ganesha.

00:06:58.824 --> 00:07:02.509
And Shri Ganesha is made out of the Mother Earth element.

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:06.347
So, by praying to Shri Ganesha we also establish Him,

00:07:06.547 --> 00:07:10.466
in a city, in a place like this place now

00:07:10.666 --> 00:07:14.766
is San Francisco, where I came here first we had no Puja, nothing.

00:07:14.966 --> 00:07:17.773
That is why the whole thing was just touch and go.

00:07:18.012 --> 00:07:19.542
I couldn't go deep into people.

00:07:19.743 --> 00:07:22.035
I couldn't go deep into the place and so the,

00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:24.307
I didn't know how I would be able to manage,

00:07:24.508 --> 00:07:28.718
because there is no education on this.

00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:31.046
People are not educated about it.

00:07:31.247 --> 00:07:33.642
But in India immediately the first thing is Puja.

00:07:33.842 --> 00:07:35.034
They will not come to my lecture,

00:07:35.234 --> 00:07:36.893
they will not come to anything, first is Puja.

00:07:37.093 --> 00:07:39.912
If there is a Puja, everybody is getting up at 4 o'clock,

00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:42.666
having a bath, getting ready to come to Puja.

00:07:42.866 --> 00:07:44.879
Because they know the importance of it,

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:50.430
that just your essence is awakened by it.

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:54.274
Essence is awakened and to awaken the essence

00:07:54.475 --> 00:07:57.618
you have to be

00:07:57.873 --> 00:08:00.053
there, at a place where this is done,

00:08:00.318 --> 00:08:03.274
so that your essence is awakened.

00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:06.399
Now, the trouble is with ego-oriented societies,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.396
is very difficult to tell them about Puja.

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.914
Itâ€™s find it difficult, that is why we do not allow

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.135
everyone to come to Puja for one reason,

00:08:13.335 --> 00:08:15.907
because as soon as they see something happening,

00:08:15.932 --> 00:08:17.604
their ego starts up, you see.

00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:19.775
And instead of doing anything to them,

00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:25.135
the barrier is so much, that I can't just do anything about it.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.361
The barrier is too much in their ego, they have their own ideas,

00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:30.822
their own conceptions, their own feeling,

00:08:31.022 --> 00:08:36.264
and it's impossible to penetrate deep into them, so it is a waste.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.642
And if you cannot receive the vibrations,

00:08:38.842 --> 00:08:41.621
I feel the pain in my own centres.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.145
Because the deities, you see, get so annoyed,

00:08:44.369 --> 00:08:46.257
and they don't like it and they think that

00:08:46.457 --> 00:08:49.089
why Mother should waste Her energy with these people

00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:50.744
who do not understand about Puja.

00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:54.609
So, I want to prepare you beforehand, that you keep yourself open.

00:08:54.843 --> 00:08:56.687
Don't allow your ego to come up.

00:08:56.712 --> 00:08:59.420
It's nothing for Me to gain. It is for you to gain.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.171
Keep your minds open.

00:09:01.371 --> 00:09:03.785
The trouble is that at the time of this Sahasrara opening,

00:09:03.988 --> 00:09:06.937
this brain, everybody's brain is upside down.

00:09:07.137 --> 00:09:10.154
It is impossible, you try to turn it and they jump on you.

00:09:10.354 --> 00:09:12.648
It is a big problem for me, it is the biggest problem.

00:09:12.848 --> 00:09:14.609
Because, all other incarnations came,

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:18.406
they didn't have to do this difficult work of making you something.

00:09:18.606 --> 00:09:22.209
Just it was to awaken within you a awareness,

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.057
like Christ had to awaken your Agyna Charka.

00:09:25.277 --> 00:09:28.802
Alright, he has crucified himself for the same reason,

00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:31.393
He resurrected Himself for the same reason.

00:09:31.593 --> 00:09:33.642
It was a very hard life for him

00:09:33.842 --> 00:09:36.942
and, for the Mother, it was even worse, no doubt.

00:09:37.142 --> 00:09:42.595
But still, one should know that this is a very hazardous thing,

00:09:42.837 --> 00:09:46.302
to transform people and then to establish them

00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:52.454
and create out of these little seeds a huge big tree of a saint.

00:09:53.107 --> 00:09:56.690
Now, in the same way, we have got Moses, we have got Abraham,

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.272
all these great saints are within our, in our void.

00:10:00.473 --> 00:10:03.123
They are the gurus. And on a Guru Puja,

00:10:03.324 --> 00:10:05.347
when you worship me on the Guru Puja day,

00:10:05.547 --> 00:10:08.864
that time these are awakened within you, and you become a master,

00:10:09.064 --> 00:10:10.308
you become yourself a Guru.

00:10:10.508 --> 00:10:13.257
You yourself know so much,

00:10:13.457 --> 00:10:15.734
even I don't have to tell you, I don't think

00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:20.295
I have talked to people very much in private, or explain to things.

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:23.115
But somehow they become so much full of knowledge,

00:10:23.315 --> 00:10:25.890
that is rather surprising how they understand. Like,

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.556
I was talking to Yogi Mahajan

00:10:27.756 --> 00:10:30.985
and he was telling me what's the problem is with human being and,

00:10:31.186 --> 00:10:34.624
you see, he was telling me how we cannot relate to them and all.

00:10:34.691 --> 00:10:37.545
Which is interesting, because My father did same to Me.

00:10:37.746 --> 00:10:41.809
I said that he is my first guru and all of you my second gurus.

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:44.776
Because I don't understand human beings.

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:46.982
You see for example, this homosexual business.

00:10:47.182 --> 00:10:49.702
When Gregoire, with very great reluctance, you see,

00:10:49.902 --> 00:10:51.159
told me through somebody else,

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.210
I nearly fainted, actually could not understand,

00:10:54.235 --> 00:10:56.659
what's happened to them? Now, what am I to do?

00:10:56.859 --> 00:10:59.412
And I couldn't eat my food for one week.

00:10:59.612 --> 00:11:01.609
I felt so bad about the whole thing.

00:11:01.634 --> 00:11:04.371
Like, My own children where are they?.

00:11:04.396 --> 00:11:08.480
If you have a heart of an intense Mother,

00:11:08.715 --> 00:11:10.553
you can understand what she feels about it.

00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.121
And I knew they are in for trouble,

00:11:12.322 --> 00:11:16.345
I knew everything was going to be very very hazardous.

00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:18.536
But doesn't matter, by God's grace

00:11:18.737 --> 00:11:20.821
everything will be all right. I am sure it will work out.

00:11:21.022 --> 00:11:23.307
So, first we have to establish Shri Ganesha.

00:11:23.515 --> 00:11:26.002
First of all, we have to establish Shri Ganesha within ourselves

00:11:26.203 --> 00:11:29.998
and Shri Ganesha in this place called San Francisco.

00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:33.490
Alright? That is why we have to first do Shri Ganesha's Puja.

00:11:33.732 --> 00:11:35.226
Then, secondly I told him

00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:38.773
that if possible we should do little bit of Shri Vishnu's,

00:11:38.974 --> 00:11:42.830
because he is the one who gives us the evolutionary power

00:11:43.031 --> 00:11:46.938
by which we can evolve ourselves and evolve others.

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:50.466
So we have a little time for Shri Vishnu's Puja.

00:11:50.666 --> 00:11:53.279
Also, they do Havanas all that for Shri Vishnu's Puja,

00:11:53.604 --> 00:11:56.558
which is very good to clear the atmosphere sort of thing.

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:59.494
But we will do next year all these things, perhaps, maybe,

00:11:59.695 --> 00:12:02.160
because now we don't have these arrangements.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.366
But that would be a very good idea, too.

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:10.257
And then thirdly they want to do the the Puja of Shakti, the Mother.

00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:13.030
Because, unless and until you have power,

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.458
even if all the deities are there, you will be exhausted,

00:12:15.659 --> 00:12:16.833
you wouldn't be able to work it out.

00:12:17.034 --> 00:12:20.981
So the third is of your own power, of your Kundalini,

00:12:21.182 --> 00:12:26.065
of the power that is going to work out this Divine work.

00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:27.660
That is how we have three Pujas.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.621
But none of you should get into an ego trip.

00:12:30.822 --> 00:12:33.198
Please, keep your ego on one side.

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:36.900
Just now, see for yourself how it works within yourself.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.635
You start feeling good, you start feeling better vibrations

00:12:40.917 --> 00:12:44.806
and you start feeling much better and healthier within yourself.

00:12:45.006 --> 00:12:47.849
So, just keep your self open. It is you

00:12:48.052 --> 00:12:49.941
who has to achieve something, not Me.

00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:54.025
I don't have to achieve anything. So you better make use of Me.

00:12:54.234 --> 00:12:57.895
Because I am here only for today and then I will go away.

00:12:58.095 --> 00:12:59.775
So, make best use of Me

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.964
and that is why I said as many as possible try to call

00:13:03.165 --> 00:13:05.425
the people over here will be a good idea.

00:13:05.478 --> 00:13:06.275
May God Bless you.
