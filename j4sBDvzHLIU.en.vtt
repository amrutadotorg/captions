00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.058
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:31.058
As Dr. Warren has told you, that the blossom time has come.

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:37.819
You could never have found so many seekers,

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.058
on this Earth,

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.179
say even before 50 years.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.139
Suddenly so many seekers have been born,

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.939
who are seeking something beyond.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.139
They are not satisfied with rationality,

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.539
with materialism, with all the ideologies given

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:11.779
by the people who talk that that we should be satisfied

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.819
with ourselves

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:18.819
as far as matter goes

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:23.139
or as far as mental projection is concerned.

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.339
They want to know that there must be something beyond.

00:01:29.058 --> 00:01:33.059
And thus we find

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.299
there is a great

00:01:38.058 --> 00:01:42.219
shopping center that has opened especially in your country,

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:46.339
of all those people who think they can surprise us.

00:01:47.058 --> 00:01:50.339
That is one of the signs which were described even by Christ.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.339
Of course in our country,

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.058
there are books and books written

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.179
about those people who will come here

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.259
as fake people and take full advantage of your seeking.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:10.659
Now the problem with the Western mind is this,

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:15.058
that it does not understand the dangers

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.539
of getting into all kinds of things,

00:02:19.058 --> 00:02:24.179
and that is why they are really

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.299
[led] into things

00:02:27.058 --> 00:02:29.339
where they should not have been.

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.939
And they have no knowledge also,

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:36.019
in a way what to expect

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.299
of themselves.

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.899
When they are seeking, what should be expected?

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.259
What should happen to us?

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.058
What is the criteria that we are realized souls?

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:59.058
Which is the way we can find out that we have got our Realization?

00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:07.099
As it is, there is so much of book-knowledge, the worst,

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:10.899
as Shankaracharya calls as, calls it shabda jaalam,

00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:12.819
the net of worse.

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:15.899
And people were lost in those words.

00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:19.058
The books are there, the words are there,

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.219
and the people start thinking that

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.259
by reading these books or by understanding them mentally,

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.299
or some of them think by remembering by heart,

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.539
they will achieve their Realization.

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:40.419
That means Realization is only for people, who are able to read.

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:44.058
And what about the people who cannot read?

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.339
Are they not going to evolve?

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.058
Perhaps they are going to evolve much faster

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.058
than the people who can read.

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.939
Because they have no complications in their heads.

00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:55.259
They are simple, straight forward people.

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.058
I've seen the example of that in India.

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.779
Not only that, but they are very sensitive.

00:04:01.058 --> 00:04:02.779
It's because they live with the Mother Earth

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.019
They are extremely sensitive.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.939
They know a tug, they know a cheat,

00:04:08.058 --> 00:04:11.019
they know a hypocrite and they know the reality.

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.058
While where people live with artificialities,

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:16.939
with artificial love,

00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:19.099
it's impossible for them to judge,

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.059
what is real and what is artificial.

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:26.819
As I told you before, that minimum of minimum,

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:31.058
you must cancel all the people who live on your money.

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.339
They are parasites, in simple words.

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.459
Or they may be your servants.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:39.099
But they cannot be the people who can deliver the goods.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.779
If they are poor, they live like poor people.

00:04:43.058 --> 00:04:47.058
If they are rich, they live there, but absolutely detached.

00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:52.219
Now, what should we expect?

00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:55.099
What should happen to us,

00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:58.819
when we say that "I have got Realization".

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:04.379
This is the point people do not know they are not educated in that.

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:06.379
They are naive about it,

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:11.059
and that's why people have taken full advantage of their ignorance.

00:05:12.058 --> 00:05:13.299
I came ten years back,

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.939
and told them frankly about all these things, with names and things,

00:05:18.058 --> 00:05:19.259
But they didn’t like Me.

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:21.379
They said, "Why should You stop us from doing all these?"

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:22.939
I said, "Go ahead."

00:05:23.058 --> 00:05:26.819
But now what I find most of them are lost.

00:05:27.058 --> 00:05:29.058
They have just became like cabbages.

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.859
They are so mesmerized, they don’t know what they are doing,

00:05:34.058 --> 00:05:36.179
where they have to go.

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.179
Now if the Spirit has to shine within us,

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.939
what should happen, what is Self Realization?

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:51.259
Let’s see if there is a light in this room,

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:54.899
if you become the light, you don’t see the light.

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:59.179
But through that you can see everyone, the light can see everyone.

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:03.499
And what do you see? First you must see yourself.

00:06:04.058 --> 00:06:06.219
You have never faced yourself.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.739
People become mad.

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:11.939
Till they are mad they don’t know that they are becoming mad.

00:06:12.058 --> 00:06:16.459
They get cancers, their diseases in the body is crawling up.

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.259
They don’t know they got the disease, there’s any problem.

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:22.299
They just continue with the life, without understanding.

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:25.499
They have no way of finding out,

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:28.739
or diagnosis cannot be done by them.

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:31.379
But once you become the Spirit,

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.058
the Spirit when it emits through your fingers,

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.058
when you start feeling enlightenment of your fingertips,

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:44.139
you can feel what’s wrong with your chakras, means your centers.

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:46.739
Now somebody can decode it

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.939
and tell you, that this fingers means that,

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:51.139
this finger means that, this finger means that,

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:55.299
the combination and permutations of these seven centers,

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:59.019
one two, three four, five, six, seven, as shown here.

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:02.419
We have marked with the colors to show you

00:07:03.058 --> 00:07:06.019
that how on the finger, hands,

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.179
feet have different, but hands,

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:14.859
you see the effect of those centers when you are enlightened.

00:07:15.058 --> 00:07:18.058
Before that you cannot. Because you are like a computer.

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:19.939
You are really a computer, otherwise

00:07:20.058 --> 00:07:22.339
also if you want to see rationally

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:26.299
that you see something and you don’t think about it, but you see.

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:29.179
What a perfect computer you are already.

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:32.939
But the computer becomes

00:07:33.058 --> 00:07:36.058
a part and parcel of your awareness.

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:39.859
You sort of become the master of that computer

00:07:40.058 --> 00:07:44.019
so that you can understand the decoding,

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:49.058
and the maneuvering of all the processes of that computer.

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:51.819
This computer is beautifully made,

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:54.058
Is very beautifully made as you can see it.

00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:55.899
Is not a mix bag,

00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:57.939
as most of the psychologists believe

00:07:58.058 --> 00:08:00.259
that you have to go to the subconscious,

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:03.259
to get to the higher super consciousness.

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:05.899
Here you can see on the left hand side

00:08:06.058 --> 00:08:08.099
is the subconscious and the collective subconscious.

00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:11.979
On the right hand side you have got this supraconscious

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:15.058
that is the future and the collective supraconscious.

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:18.339
Down below is what you call the hell,

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:21.058
and on top is the superconsciousness.

00:08:21.339 --> 00:08:24.179
To rise there is a passage kept very firmly.

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.179
You have to pass through these centers

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:29.058
and whatever problems are in the centers

00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:33.899
if you start feeling on your fingertips and know how to cure them,

00:08:34.058 --> 00:08:40.058
you can make your Kundalini rise very nicely and establish Agnya.

00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:44.859
All these knowledge can be yours, very easily,

00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:48.058
but the first thing is that you have to get your Realization.

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:50.539
Unless and until there is light,

00:08:51.058 --> 00:08:54.058
and if I tell you, this is not a snake, this is just a cord,

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:56.179
you are not going to believe it.

00:08:57.058 --> 00:09:01.899
The light has to come to give you the complete idea about yourself,

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:03.539
so you know yourself.

00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:07.019
First of all you must know physically what is wrong.

00:09:07.219 --> 00:09:11.179
Secondly you must know what's wrong with you mentally.

00:09:11.379 --> 00:09:14.259
Now people who are ego oriented.

00:09:15.339 --> 00:09:18.939
They torture others, they aggress others,

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:23.859
but they don’t know that they are full of ego.

00:09:24.058 --> 00:09:25.939
The people who are superego,

00:09:26.058 --> 00:09:28.539
means those who take tortures upon others,

00:09:28.939 --> 00:09:30.859
they start indulging into their miseries

00:09:31.058 --> 00:09:32.939
and start saying, "I must suffer,

00:09:33.058 --> 00:09:36.058
I must have done something wrong, so I must suffer".

00:09:36.219 --> 00:09:38.179
They accept that kind of a life.

00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:41.179
But after Realization you understand

00:09:41.379 --> 00:09:45.259
that you are not your ego or superego, but you are your Self.

00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:49.058
And you are not to suffer, nor do you have to aggress anyone.

00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:51.899
Nor you have to take aggression from anyone,

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:55.539
but you stand in the center, as the light.

00:09:57.219 --> 00:09:58.899
You have to just have to just

00:09:59.058 --> 00:10:02.459
have the source of joy flowing into you.

00:10:03.058 --> 00:10:06.339
All the time you have to get connected to the whole,

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:09.379
so that you are looked after by the whole.

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:13.059
You become part and parcel of the whole. You are part and parcel,

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:16.058
but you are not aware. You become aware of it.

00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:17.939
So the first thing happens to you

00:10:18.058 --> 00:10:21.299
that you come to know about your physical side and

00:10:21.539 --> 00:10:24.179
mental side, whether you are emotional

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:27.499
or whether you are ego oriented.

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:30.979
Then you start in the center.

00:10:31.099 --> 00:10:32.819
When I’m talking to you

00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:34.499
maybe you are thinking of your past

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:37.459
or maybe you are thinking about of you future at this time.

00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:40.979
But if I say that pay attention to yourself, you cannot pay.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.899
Your attention is outside.

00:10:43.058 --> 00:10:44.939
That is why this happening takes place,

00:10:45.058 --> 00:10:47.379
which attracts your attention inside.

00:10:48.058 --> 00:10:51.179
And when the attention is attracted inside,

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:54.139
then you start seeing yourself clearly,

00:10:54.339 --> 00:10:57.219
understanding yourself, "That is the matter with me".

00:10:58.339 --> 00:11:02.058
What's wrong with the world today is wrong with every individual.

00:11:02.219 --> 00:11:06.058
If the individuals improve, the whole world is going to improve.

00:11:07.539 --> 00:11:12.058
So physically and mentally you get perfectly all right.

00:11:12.219 --> 00:11:15.058
All kinds of diseases can be cured by Sahaja Yoga;

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:18.419
you can cure yourself, I don’t have to cure you.

00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:21.979
Because you become empowered by that.

00:11:22.099 --> 00:11:26.058
Secondly, you also know what is wrong with you, Spiritually.

00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:28.779
Supposing you have been to a wrong guru,

00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:34.058
supposing you have been mesmerized by a wrong person,

00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:36.139
now how are you going to know

00:11:36.339 --> 00:11:38.459
whether he is wrong or a right person?

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:42.419
How will you find out? Supposing Christ comes stands before you,

00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:44.099
how will you recognize Christ?

00:11:44.299 --> 00:11:46.259
Have you any way of finding out?

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:48.179
Anybody who talks sweetly

00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:53.179
has all these professional methods of enticing you,

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.179
you can fall a pray to that.

00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:59.899
But after Realization you find from your hand

00:12:00.058 --> 00:12:03.259
a new kind of a vibratory awareness is going.

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:05.939
Through these vibrations you can find out

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:10.099
whether the person is false, hypocritical or a devil.

00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:14.859
If he is a devil you might even get blisters on your hand.

00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:19.819
And that's how you correct your Spiritual

00:12:20.058 --> 00:12:22.219
seeking when you have gone wrong.

00:12:22.419 --> 00:12:24.019
If you know how to correct it,

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:28.739
the methods which are very simple, the movement of your hands,

00:12:28.939 --> 00:12:30.939
you can get out of that.

00:12:31.058 --> 00:12:34.899
Many people as you must have known, that who have been to cults,

00:12:35.058 --> 00:12:39.419
had fake gurus, have suffered. They have become like cabbages.

00:12:40.219 --> 00:12:45.499
But all those people can be saved if they get their Realization

00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:49.259
and gradually understand their power of getting out of it.

00:12:49.459 --> 00:12:55.019
Because Spirit is self-powered, it works on itself.

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.779
So first of all you know about yourself.

00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:03.058
As a result of that, you drop off all your habits.

00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:07.058
Supposing there is a black spot on my sari,

00:13:07.499 --> 00:13:11.058
I cannot see and I am identified with it,

00:13:11.219 --> 00:13:14.058
so anybody tells me there is black spot, I won’t like it.

00:13:14.219 --> 00:13:20.058
But supposing I can see it, then I clean it myself.

00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:27.299
When the nectar or ambrosia of God’s love starts flowing in you,

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:31.019
you just don’t need to drink, you just don't need to smoke,

00:13:31.139 --> 00:13:34.499
you are no more a slave of any habits.

00:13:34.859 --> 00:13:36.059
You just become a free bird.

00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:40.058
That’s the real freedom, that nothing can entice you,

00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:42.019
nothing can enslave you.

00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:44.819
You become so integrated that if you don’t want it,

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:47.499
you just don’t want it. Then your body will support you,

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:49.939
your mind will support you, your Spirit will support you.

00:13:50.058 --> 00:13:52.499
You are completely integrated at that point.

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:55.299
That is the first thing happens to you,

00:13:55.499 --> 00:13:58.058
as a person who comes to Sahaja Yoga;

00:13:58.219 --> 00:14:01.179
I’ve seen many of them, were alcoholics.

00:14:01.379 --> 00:14:04.058
We have some artists in India, were great alcoholics.

00:14:04.459 --> 00:14:08.739
Very great artists. They came to Sahaja Yoga

00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:11.539
and they dropped their habits.

00:14:11.859 --> 00:14:14.339
They dropped them completely.

00:14:14.779 --> 00:14:17.539
They were amazed. Next day they dropped it.

00:14:17.939 --> 00:14:20.139
Because once you get the test

00:14:20.339 --> 00:14:27.939
of this great understanding that you are the Spirit,

00:14:28.058 --> 00:14:32.099
you just become so powerful that nothing can overpower you.

00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:35.499
It has happened with many.

00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:38.739
Now only thing is that,

00:14:38.939 --> 00:14:43.058
what is the use, people ask Me, of becoming.

00:14:43.859 --> 00:14:49.819
The becoming is actually, is the epitome of your evolution.

00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:53.539
You have to do it. You cannot avoid it. If not today, tomorrow.

00:14:53.939 --> 00:14:57.139
If you don’t accept it,

00:14:57.339 --> 00:15:00.859
then you'll have to face the consequences.

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:03.979
But you have to become the Spirit.

00:15:04.459 --> 00:15:07.539
The another very great thing it happens,

00:15:07.819 --> 00:15:12.058
that the light that you have, gives light to others.

00:15:12.339 --> 00:15:14.939
You can enlighten their lights.

00:15:15.058 --> 00:15:17.219
Their candles are not yet ready,

00:15:17.419 --> 00:15:20.058
then you know how to put them right.

00:15:20.179 --> 00:15:23.459
You can enlighten their lights with your light,

00:15:23.859 --> 00:15:27.058
without obliging them.

00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:29.058
Like the sun shines.

00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:32.259
It doesn’t say "I’m shinning, I’m doing all this,

00:15:32.459 --> 00:15:36.299
I’m creating chlorophyll". It doesn’t. It just shines.

00:15:37.058 --> 00:15:40.099
But we can say that it doesn’t do any work,

00:15:40.299 --> 00:15:43.259
or we say he does non-work, a-karma.

00:15:43.539 --> 00:15:46.699
In the same way it starts flowing through your being,

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:48.499
just working out.

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:53.339
And anybody says, "Mother, I am thankful", I’m surprised.

00:15:54.058 --> 00:15:57.058
Because if you are a part and parcel of My being,

00:15:57.219 --> 00:16:02.939
if this is my finger, if I try to soothe My finger,

00:16:03.058 --> 00:16:05.459
is not going to thank Me.

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:08.539
In the same way, there is not the other left,

00:16:08.939 --> 00:16:12.899
you just start feeling another person upon your fingertips.

00:16:13.299 --> 00:16:17.058
That means you become again collectively conscious,

00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:22.459
and later on as you grow you become cosmic conscious.

00:16:23.058 --> 00:16:27.899
That means that you know how to handle even the elements.

00:16:28.058 --> 00:16:31.379
But first you have to become collectively conscious.

00:16:31.779 --> 00:16:33.979
When you become collectively conscious,

00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:38.058
suddenly a tremendous compassion and love starts growing in you.

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:41.939
You feel so nourished yourself that you want to give.

00:16:42.058 --> 00:16:45.059
You have so much that the charity just

00:16:45.259 --> 00:16:47.299
makes you feel that you should give.

00:16:47.499 --> 00:16:49.939
And when this charity starts flowing,

00:16:50.058 --> 00:16:53.219
then you are amazed how it works.

00:16:54.058 --> 00:16:56.819
We invite people to our house to create good relationships.

00:16:57.019 --> 00:17:00.659
We give them food, we give them this, try to make good relationship.

00:17:00.859 --> 00:17:03.899
Here the relationship is spontaneous.

00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:06.979
You don’t have to say about it, it just exists.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:08.979
You feel it that is there.

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:12.379
I’ll give you an example of a girl who went to Sicily

00:17:12.539 --> 00:17:14.059
and she was feeling very lonely she said

00:17:14.259 --> 00:17:16.699
"now what am I to talk to these people, you see,

00:17:16.899 --> 00:17:19.259
there is nobody here who is a realized soul".

00:17:19.459 --> 00:17:21.099
She was feeling very lonely.

00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:23.259
Suddenly she felt some vibrations around her.

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:28.259
She turn around and she saw another lady sitting there.

00:17:28.739 --> 00:17:32.499
She said, “Are you the child of Mother?"

00:17:32.899 --> 00:17:36.219
She just got up and grasped her, she said “Yes, I am".

00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:39.219
"I could feel your vibration, you could feel mine"

00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:41.939
And just they understood each other,

00:17:42.058 --> 00:17:44.819
that they were, they had never met before,

00:17:45.019 --> 00:17:46.219
their language is very different,

00:17:46.419 --> 00:17:47.979
they were from two different countries,

00:17:48.099 --> 00:17:49.939
they had nothing to do with each other.

00:17:50.058 --> 00:17:52.179
But the love and understanding, that they had,

00:17:52.379 --> 00:17:54.899
that all these identifications drop off,

00:17:55.058 --> 00:17:56.499
that you are an Italian,

00:17:56.779 --> 00:17:59.099
or you are an Indian, or you are an American

00:17:59.299 --> 00:18:00.899
you become a human being,

00:18:01.058 --> 00:18:04.779
and a super human being who can feel others.

00:18:05.859 --> 00:18:08.139
This knowledge is not new.

00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:11.099
It was a secret knowledge for some time.

00:18:11.459 --> 00:18:16.459
In the sixth century in our country, a great incarnation came

00:18:16.859 --> 00:18:20.339
as Adi Shankaracharya and he talked about it openly.

00:18:20.539 --> 00:18:24.058
And after that also, we had many poets who talked about it.

00:18:24.219 --> 00:18:26.779
Hundred years back, William Blake came in.

00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:30.939
And he said all about it, so clearly, he's such a seer,

00:18:31.058 --> 00:18:33.859
that he beats all the sears, everywhere.

00:18:34.058 --> 00:18:36.179
The amount of precision he has used,

00:18:36.379 --> 00:18:37.939
because perhaps he felt

00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:42.419
that if Western mind has to understand, they need precision.

00:18:42.819 --> 00:18:47.419
Even My house he has described, exact place he has described.

00:18:47.939 --> 00:18:49.979
Even what Sahaja Yogis will be doing,

00:18:50.099 --> 00:18:53.299
where our ashram will be in London, what places I’ll be visiting,

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:55.779
I mean to such a detailed thing.

00:18:55.979 --> 00:18:59.019
And surprisingly, we discovered all these

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:02.939
after we have been to that place, after we have done it.

00:19:03.058 --> 00:19:05.539
Like in London, we had our ashram,

00:19:05.819 --> 00:19:07.939
and it was a very dilapidated house, bombed.

00:19:08.058 --> 00:19:12.859
That he has written down. It will be a house, ruined house,

00:19:13.058 --> 00:19:15.539
because people didn’t have so much money.

00:19:15.939 --> 00:19:19.179
So, and then I laid the foundation.

00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:22.058
And he said "the foundation will be laid in Lambert,

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:23.219
come to Lambert.

00:19:23.419 --> 00:19:26.499
Her sinews vibrated. He used the word "Her" all the time.

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:29.779
And the clear cut picture he has given.

00:19:29.979 --> 00:19:33.139
But people called him crazy, that he is a psychological case.

00:19:33.379 --> 00:19:37.499
Because they don’t have that super consciousness to understand.

00:19:37.899 --> 00:19:41.379
But if you ask any Sahaja Yogi, he understands him very well.

00:19:41.779 --> 00:19:46.058
So even only 100 years back, there was someone who talked about Me.

00:19:46.219 --> 00:19:49.859
I would say 70 years back, somebody talked about Me, in India.

00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:54.099
But people at 14 000 years back, have also talked about Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:54.339 --> 00:19:56.859
So you can imagine that it is not

00:19:57.058 --> 00:19:59.939
that today I've just started coming out of the blue,

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:02.059
and some sort of a neo business has started.

00:20:02.259 --> 00:20:05.539
It`s a traditional growth,

00:20:05.819 --> 00:20:07.819
in a very traditional way,

00:20:08.019 --> 00:20:13.058
respecting all the establishments, not to demolish anything.

00:20:13.499 --> 00:20:17.939
But whatever is not correct, drops out by itself.

00:20:18.058 --> 00:20:21.899
All that is useless drops out by itself.

00:20:22.058 --> 00:20:26.699
In the living process, even a flower has to drop out its [chalis]

00:20:26.899 --> 00:20:28.539
if it has to become the fruit.

00:20:28.939 --> 00:20:33.419
In the same way everything works out so naturally, the way it grows,

00:20:33.819 --> 00:20:40.058
that you are amazed that at the end of it you remain pure Spirit.

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:44.499
Your eyes become innocent. There is no lust and greed in it.

00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:48.379
What Christ has said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes",

00:20:48.779 --> 00:20:50.779
that innocence is awakened within you

00:20:50.979 --> 00:20:54.019
and you just become, become innocent.

00:20:54.139 --> 00:20:57.059
Becoming innocent is not possible otherwise,

00:20:57.259 --> 00:20:59.179
but you just become innocent.

00:20:59.379 --> 00:21:01.139
You become really childlike.

00:21:01.339 --> 00:21:04.339
Your whole attitude towards life becomes childlike.

00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:07.939
Now some people may say that, "When people become like that, Mother,

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:10.058
then what happens to our business?"

00:21:10.179 --> 00:21:12.859
There was a girl in San Francisco,

00:21:13.058 --> 00:21:16.099
an Indian girl who had married another Indian.

00:21:16.379 --> 00:21:19.859
And they were having a shop. And she said:"After realization Mother,

00:21:20.058 --> 00:21:24.779
I forgot about counting this, that, I was very meticulous.

00:21:24.979 --> 00:21:26.939
But I never made any profits."

00:21:27.058 --> 00:21:29.459
But now I’m told that they have made so many profits,

00:21:29.739 --> 00:21:33.979
they are no more there, that they have 14 stores all over New York.

00:21:34.339 --> 00:21:40.058
So how things [help] you and work it out when you leave it to God,

00:21:40.819 --> 00:21:45.299
because He is thousand fold more efficient.

00:21:45.819 --> 00:21:49.058
I mean He is absolutely, we cannot compare Him to ourselves,

00:21:49.219 --> 00:21:51.819
because He is perfect.

00:21:52.058 --> 00:21:56.339
Everything is perfect, but you must enter into His Kingdom.

00:21:56.819 --> 00:22:01.179
If i don’t come to America, how will I know how Americans operate?

00:22:01.499 --> 00:22:04.179
When I have come here, then only I’ve come to know.

00:22:04.459 --> 00:22:10.939
But if you see God's realm is such, that when you enter it,

00:22:11.058 --> 00:22:14.259
you feel you are looked after every moment.

00:22:14.459 --> 00:22:17.099
How He guides you, how He watches you,

00:22:17.299 --> 00:22:21.379
in the smallest way and in the biggest way, it's most surprising.

00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:24.058
It's not easy to understand His ways.

00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:27.659
One of the examples, I don’t know, if Warren has told you.

00:22:27.859 --> 00:22:31.058
Did you tell them about the Bedford example, Warren? No.

00:22:31.299 --> 00:22:32.939
I must tell you this one, so that you’ll

00:22:33.058 --> 00:22:34.859
understand His ways are so great.

00:22:35.058 --> 00:22:40.099
I was in Bedford one night, and we had about 600 people there.

00:22:40.379 --> 00:22:43.459
I was speaking to them, about 7 o’clock I was there,

00:22:43.739 --> 00:22:45.019
till about 10 o’clock.

00:22:45.139 --> 00:22:51.939
At 8 o’clock about 10-15 miles away, one boy fell down in a ditch,

00:22:52.058 --> 00:22:55.219
in a sense that there was a bridge and he fell down very low,

00:22:55.419 --> 00:22:57.739
with his motorcycle.

00:22:58.259 --> 00:22:59.979
And when they sent for the ambulance,

00:23:00.099 --> 00:23:01.499
he just walked up and came out,

00:23:01.779 --> 00:23:04.419
so they were quite surprised that how could he come.

00:23:05.139 --> 00:23:07.939
So they took him in the ambulance to the hospital,

00:23:08.058 --> 00:23:09.739
and the police also came.

00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:13.058
Then he told them, that "A lady, Indian lady

00:23:13.219 --> 00:23:15.939
came in a white car - I have a white car -

00:23:16.058 --> 00:23:21.019
and She came down and She healed me completely".

00:23:21.139 --> 00:23:23.859
But She said that, "At the base of the spine there is still problem,

00:23:24.058 --> 00:23:25.419
you come and see me at my house."

00:23:25.819 --> 00:23:28.179
And She went away. But the people who were there, they said,

00:23:28.379 --> 00:23:31.139
"We saw no car, we saw no lady coming here.

00:23:31.339 --> 00:23:33.059
What is he talking about?"

00:23:33.299 --> 00:23:35.939
So they noted down everything and next day,

00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:38.099
because he was completely all right, they were surprised,

00:23:38.299 --> 00:23:40.899
falling from that distance, nothing had happened.

00:23:41.058 --> 00:23:43.979
He saw My photograph in the newspaper,

00:23:44.099 --> 00:23:46.939
and then he said, "This is the lady".

00:23:47.058 --> 00:23:50.339
And that was at 8 o’clock when I was speaking to so many people.

00:23:50.779 --> 00:23:52.939
So they were quite surprised when he went and told the police,

00:23:53.058 --> 00:23:57.299
and he told the hospital people, that they informed the newspaper.

00:23:57.979 --> 00:23:59.939
And newspaper people wrote to us

00:24:00.058 --> 00:24:04.979
and one of our Sahaja Yogis, answered back,

00:24:05.099 --> 00:24:07.058
and the whole thing was in the newspaper.

00:24:07.219 --> 00:24:08.939
And they were quite amazed at it.

00:24:09.058 --> 00:24:12.779
Now how this has happened. You may say how can this happen, Mother?

00:24:12.979 --> 00:24:15.859
It can happen, because as you have got television,

00:24:16.058 --> 00:24:20.139
God has tremendous organization of television.

00:24:20.739 --> 00:24:23.739
He has all telecommunication, everything.

00:24:23.939 --> 00:24:27.179
Don’t think that you can only produce these, these are dead.

00:24:27.379 --> 00:24:28.979
These are good for nothing.

00:24:29.099 --> 00:24:33.499
His working is so great that tat-kshane, at that moment.

00:24:33.899 --> 00:24:38.058
As soon as you see, as soon as you speak

00:24:38.219 --> 00:24:40.939
as soon as you desire, it works out.

00:24:41.058 --> 00:24:44.139
Even if somebody just desires,

00:24:44.339 --> 00:24:49.099
and he is a man looked after God,

00:24:49.299 --> 00:24:53.819
even he may not be a realized soul. He is helped in such a way.

00:24:54.058 --> 00:24:56.379
Now then after that they described all such

00:24:56.779 --> 00:24:59.019
happenings that took place in India, and everywhere.

00:24:59.139 --> 00:25:00.779
But what I am trying to say,

00:25:00.979 --> 00:25:04.499
that we are so much proud of what our achievements are.

00:25:04.899 --> 00:25:10.058
These achievements are nothing, compared to what God has for you.

00:25:10.539 --> 00:25:12.979
In His realm once you enter,

00:25:13.099 --> 00:25:15.499
actually you yourself become so beautiful,

00:25:15.899 --> 00:25:22.459
you yourself become such a dynamic, beautiful, silent flame of love,

00:25:22.939 --> 00:25:28.019
that you are not bothered at all as to what is happening around,

00:25:28.139 --> 00:25:31.058
what is going wrong, you don’t get upset with it.

00:25:31.419 --> 00:25:35.299
You are silently watching all this joke, all this drama,

00:25:35.499 --> 00:25:38.299
hoping that one day, the rest of the world

00:25:38.499 --> 00:25:42.179
will also become realized,

00:25:42.379 --> 00:25:46.499
and the rest of the world will also enjoy the blessings of God.

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:51.139
This is what is desired by every Sahaja Yogi,

00:25:51.339 --> 00:25:53.979
and that's why they forced Me to come to America,

00:25:54.099 --> 00:25:56.979
that I should come and speak to people here.

00:25:57.099 --> 00:26:00.219
So we must understand what are the barriers within us,

00:26:00.419 --> 00:26:02.099
not to understand Divinity

00:26:02.339 --> 00:26:04.179
Why we cannot understand Divinity?

00:26:04.379 --> 00:26:06.859
First of all we have had no education.

00:26:07.058 --> 00:26:11.139
Whatever education we have had was about the tree that is outside.

00:26:11.339 --> 00:26:14.939
But we have no education about the roots, doesn’t matter.

00:26:15.058 --> 00:26:17.339
To go to the roots, you have to become subtle.

00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:20.058
When you get Realization you enter into the roots,

00:26:20.219 --> 00:26:22.139
and the knowledge becomes yours in no time.

00:26:22.339 --> 00:26:25.019
You don’t need much time to know about it,

00:26:25.139 --> 00:26:28.419
because you become the light and through that light you can see.

00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:32.179
Like you must have seen these people who work in the mines, you see,

00:26:32.379 --> 00:26:33.939
they have a light placed here

00:26:34.058 --> 00:26:35.459
and through that they can see everything.

00:26:35.859 --> 00:26:38.499
In the same way you become the light, you don’t see the light,

00:26:38.899 --> 00:26:43.058
You become the light, and in that light you see everything.

00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:47.299
Now, when this happens to you,

00:26:47.499 --> 00:26:51.058
your attention, as I told you, becomes collective.

00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:56.139
Your attention starts feel another personality,

00:26:56.379 --> 00:27:00.939
another person, another person’s, another people,

00:27:01.058 --> 00:27:03.899
and you start understanding what the problem is.

00:27:04.058 --> 00:27:06.899
And you can help them,

00:27:08.379 --> 00:27:13.499
by just doing some sort of a blessing, as you say,

00:27:13.939 --> 00:27:15.259
and you can work it out.

00:27:15.459 --> 00:27:17.939
But there are people who are unwise.

00:27:18.059 --> 00:27:19.859
In this world, there are people who are stupid.

00:27:20.058 --> 00:27:21.299
They need not be educated.

00:27:21.499 --> 00:27:24.859
Educated people also can be very unwise people.

00:27:25.058 --> 00:27:30.259
They need not be very intelligent,

00:27:30.459 --> 00:27:32.139
or they may be intelligent,

00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:35.299
but wisdom is an innate quality in a person.

00:27:35.499 --> 00:27:37.059
If they are wise enough,

00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:40.058
they know how to handle the situation, to understand themselves

00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:42.779
and they settle down in Sahaja Yoga in no time.

00:27:42.979 --> 00:27:46.139
But those who are not so wise, take time.

00:27:46.859 --> 00:27:51.099
So one has to understand that we have to have perseverance about it

00:27:51.299 --> 00:27:54.779
we have to settle down into it, absolutely master it,

00:27:54.979 --> 00:27:57.339
because you become the master.

00:27:57.539 --> 00:27:59.859
That’s the point is, you become the master of yourself

00:28:00.058 --> 00:28:02.899
you don`t need any guru. You become the master.

00:28:03.058 --> 00:28:07.019
As I will tell you, the left and the right, is here.

00:28:07.139 --> 00:28:11.939
We can compare it to the brake and the accelerator of a car.

00:28:12.059 --> 00:28:13.539
Left side is the brake

00:28:13.939 --> 00:28:15.299
- Gregoire later you do it, because you see,

00:28:15.499 --> 00:28:17.379
people have attention very much confused.

00:28:17.539 --> 00:28:19.499
If you get up immediately their eyes go there.

00:28:19.899 --> 00:28:22.819
We should keep, you see, he is just taking a photograph.

00:28:23.019 --> 00:28:24.499
We have seen so many people in this world.

00:28:24.899 --> 00:28:28.058
For a change, keep your attention little concentrated.

00:28:30.499 --> 00:28:32.139
But it will happen.

00:28:32.339 --> 00:28:34.779
It will happen, once you get your Realization,

00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:38.058
your attention will be very, very nicely placed.

00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:43.819
Now, when you people know that this has happened to you,

00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:48.339
and when you become the master,

00:28:49.058 --> 00:28:53.259
you know the brake and the accelerator in you.

00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:57.219
But still, actually you are not the master,

00:28:57.419 --> 00:28:59.058
you are still the driver.

00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:02.379
And when you are a driver, you automatically do it driving,

00:29:02.779 --> 00:29:05.299
but still one should not say that you are a driver.

00:29:05.499 --> 00:29:07.979
You know the balancing of it, you know how to maneuver it,

00:29:08.099 --> 00:29:10.058
how to act.

00:29:11.058 --> 00:29:16.058
But then, what happens? To become the master, what do you do?

00:29:16.819 --> 00:29:18.539
This Realization takes place.

00:29:18.939 --> 00:29:22.379
Then you become the master, and you see the driver,

00:29:22.779 --> 00:29:26.419
you see the accelerator, and you see the brake in yourself.

00:29:26.939 --> 00:29:29.139
And you just enjoy like a master.

00:29:29.339 --> 00:29:32.979
When you become the master, you cannot be slave of anything.

00:29:33.219 --> 00:29:35.539
No more slavery, the real freedom lies

00:29:35.979 --> 00:29:37.979
in becoming the master of yourself.

00:29:38.099 --> 00:29:40.939
No use mastering others, just master yourself.

00:29:41.058 --> 00:29:43.939
But that mastering cannot be done by lecturing

00:29:44.058 --> 00:29:46.939
or by brainwashing, or by talking to you,

00:29:47.058 --> 00:29:49.019
but it's a happening that has to take place.

00:29:49.139 --> 00:29:53.019
The Kundalini has to rise and has to give you Realization.

00:29:53.899 --> 00:29:59.058
This, unless and until this happens we should not say that we know.

00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:04.779
Know, knowledge is not, when we are not one with the Divine.

00:30:05.058 --> 00:30:10.259
It’s like a machine or you can say telephone not connected.

00:30:10.899 --> 00:30:14.299
We have to get our connection first, establish the connection,

00:30:14.499 --> 00:30:17.859
and then we become the knower.

00:30:18.058 --> 00:30:21.819
And the knowledge becomes a part and parcel of you.

00:30:22.219 --> 00:30:24.659
But this cannot happen to stupid people.

00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:26.499
It’s not meant for stupid at all,

00:30:26.899 --> 00:30:28.819
neither for the cowardly.

00:30:29.019 --> 00:30:32.058
It is meant for people who are courageous,

00:30:32.179 --> 00:30:35.058
who are people of wisdom,

00:30:35.179 --> 00:30:39.939
who are not given to nonsensical things easily.

00:30:40.058 --> 00:30:43.259
That`s why in Sahaja Yoga there are two forces working all the time.

00:30:43.459 --> 00:30:45.539
You may get your Realization today here,

00:30:45.939 --> 00:30:49.058
but I won’t say that you’ll sustain it. I won’t guarantee that.

00:30:49.219 --> 00:30:51.058
The reason is, we have two forces,

00:30:51.219 --> 00:30:54.058
one is centripetal and another is centrifugal.

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:56.259
By one force you are attracted towards it,

00:30:56.459 --> 00:30:58.259
by another force you are thrown out.

00:30:58.459 --> 00:31:00.259
Because you have come out of matter.

00:31:00.459 --> 00:31:02.459
And the matter tries to drag you down.

00:31:02.859 --> 00:31:04.058
You have to master it,

00:31:04.219 --> 00:31:07.859
in such a way that the Spirit sits on the top of the matter.

00:31:08.058 --> 00:31:10.058
And the matter doesn’t dominate you anymore.

00:31:10.219 --> 00:31:15.139
And for that you have to meditate, and you will be in meditation.

00:31:15.339 --> 00:31:18.539
It's simple thing to be done, there’s nothing difficult.

00:31:18.819 --> 00:31:20.939
Sahaja Yoga is the simplest method.

00:31:21.058 --> 00:31:26.299
Sahaja also means, it means also a simple, easy.

00:31:26.779 --> 00:31:28.979
But "saha-ja", saha means with,

00:31:29.099 --> 00:31:30.979
"ja" means born, is born with you.

00:31:31.099 --> 00:31:34.019
But today this is called in India as Maha Yoga.

00:31:34.139 --> 00:31:36.939
Because before this, all the Realizations

00:31:37.058 --> 00:31:39.099
took place of course through Sahaj only,

00:31:39.299 --> 00:31:42.058
by Kundalini awakening. There is no other way.

00:31:42.259 --> 00:31:45.459
Only Kundalini awakening is the way you get your Realization.

00:31:45.819 --> 00:31:47.739
Like some people said, there must be some another way.

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:51.058
There is none. Because like a seed has to sprout

00:31:51.219 --> 00:31:54.939
through the primule only, in the same way, in your case,

00:31:55.058 --> 00:31:58.379
in human beings, the Kundalini has to rise to give you Realization.

00:31:58.779 --> 00:32:00.899
There’s no other way, but this.

00:32:01.058 --> 00:32:03.939
It is called as Sahaja method, means spontaneous method.

00:32:04.059 --> 00:32:05.939
But today it is called as Maha Yoga,

00:32:06.058 --> 00:32:09.379
because you`ll find thousands of people get Realization.

00:32:09.779 --> 00:32:11.979
People who have been with Me in the villages of India,

00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:15.499
have seen 6000, 8000 people gathered.

00:32:15.899 --> 00:32:18.939
I mean in New York we have so many people, see how many have come.

00:32:19.058 --> 00:32:21.939
But if you go to a village, one village in India,

00:32:22.058 --> 00:32:25.179
you’ll be surprised, people will be pouring on their bullock carts,

00:32:25.379 --> 00:32:26.699
" There, Mataji has come".

00:32:26.899 --> 00:32:29.979
Because they know, and in that atmosphere, you see,

00:32:30.099 --> 00:32:33.379
the fragrance of this good news spreads so fast,

00:32:33.979 --> 00:32:37.779
spreads so fast, because that’s the atmosphere for that.

00:32:37.979 --> 00:32:40.499
But where there is so much of mental activity,

00:32:40.779 --> 00:32:42.058
nothing can penetrate.

00:32:42.219 --> 00:32:47.179
They cannot see, they have no sensitivity to visualize

00:32:47.379 --> 00:32:50.058
what is good for them and what is not.

00:32:50.779 --> 00:32:53.058
So the last chakra is of the 7-th,

00:32:53.219 --> 00:32:55.819
all the 7 chakras are in the last chakra.

00:32:56.019 --> 00:32:58.299
And that's how you get complete integrated.

00:32:58.499 --> 00:33:00.939
Your emotional being, your mental being,

00:33:01.058 --> 00:33:04.499
your physical being, your spiritual being completely integrated.

00:33:04.979 --> 00:33:07.939
You go beyond time. You are not bothered about time at all.

00:33:08.058 --> 00:33:09.939
If you say "Mother, when will get Realization?

00:33:10.059 --> 00:33:13.058
I say "Just now". That's the point is.

00:33:13.299 --> 00:33:17.419
But if you don’t get it, all right. If you get it, just now.

00:33:17.739 --> 00:33:19.979
This Kundalini rises in a split of a second,

00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:22.099
like a jet it goes out of your head.

00:33:22.299 --> 00:33:25.139
But with so many people it just struggles [for days].

00:33:25.459 --> 00:33:28.459
She is there at the base just trying to come up.

00:33:28.859 --> 00:33:30.058
It's very difficult sometimes.

00:33:30.179 --> 00:33:32.739
I've seen some Kundalinis in such a bad shape

00:33:32.939 --> 00:33:35.939
that it horrifies Me. What we have done to ourselves?

00:33:36.058 --> 00:33:39.459
By this kind of a tomfoolery, "What is wrong? What is wrong?",

00:33:39.739 --> 00:33:41.499
going into this and going into that,

00:33:41.779 --> 00:33:44.819
we have really ruined our chances of our evolution.

00:33:45.019 --> 00:33:46.939
And then you say you are seeking.

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:50.899
How to help people? You have already weakened yourself so much.

00:33:51.219 --> 00:33:52.499
It takes time.

00:33:52.899 --> 00:33:55.139
It’s one of my concerns, that so many saints

00:33:55.339 --> 00:33:58.219
are born in this country, are born in the West.

00:33:58.419 --> 00:34:01.899
But where are they lost, what has happened to them?

00:34:02.259 --> 00:34:05.058
Why do they take so much time to take to reality?

00:34:05.219 --> 00:34:07.419
They are driven to any fake guru

00:34:07.699 --> 00:34:09.779
to any fake person who is making money,

00:34:10.019 --> 00:34:12.058
who has got Rolls Royces, this, that.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:15.179
Why should it impress you so much, I can’t understand.

00:34:15.379 --> 00:34:18.058
Like a newspaper I went to, and they said,

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:19.859
"How many Rolls Royce She has got?"

00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:21.139
They said, "She has no Rolls Royces".

00:34:21.339 --> 00:34:23.859
Then they said, "We are not interested". Imagine!

00:34:24.099 --> 00:34:29.179
Such a thing happening in your country is absolutely absurd,

00:34:29.379 --> 00:34:33.219
that such a thing should happen to people who are intelligent,

00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:35.058
that God cannot be purchased,

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:39.739
He cannot be paid in Rolls Royces and all these material things.

00:34:39.979 --> 00:34:43.019
They are nothing to Him, they are not equal to the dust of His feet.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.179
And what is there to give up? Some people talk

00:34:45.379 --> 00:34:47.339
that you must give up this and give up that.

00:34:47.539 --> 00:34:50.019
When you are not holding to anything, what is there to give up?

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.499
All these nonsensical ideas,

00:34:51.779 --> 00:34:53.659
that you give up this for God, give up that.

00:34:53.859 --> 00:34:57.299
God doesn't want all these nonsensical things you give to yourself.

00:34:57.499 --> 00:35:00.019
But what happens, you get out of it.

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:04.339
A thought rises and falls off. Another thought rises and falls off.

00:35:04.979 --> 00:35:07.859
When you are in the thought, you are materialistic

00:35:08.058 --> 00:35:12.819
you are mentally thinking and all those things happening.

00:35:13.058 --> 00:35:15.859
But in the center is a little space,

00:35:16.058 --> 00:35:18.058
which is called in Sanskrit as vilamba.

00:35:18.219 --> 00:35:20.379
When you rise above that,

00:35:20.699 --> 00:35:22.779
then neither you are in the future nor in the past.

00:35:23.019 --> 00:35:24.699
You are above time.

00:35:24.939 --> 00:35:26.058
You are absolutely detached.

00:35:26.219 --> 00:35:28.379
You start seeing the whole thing as a joke.

00:35:28.699 --> 00:35:31.058
And then you become a real dynamic person.

00:35:31.219 --> 00:35:35.219
And you create things which are superb and eternal.

00:35:35.419 --> 00:35:37.859
Like I would say Mozart was a realized soul.

00:35:38.058 --> 00:35:40.179
Michelangelo was another realized soul.

00:35:40.379 --> 00:35:43.499
They created all those things because they were realized souls.

00:35:43.819 --> 00:35:47.219
They could go out and see for themselves what’s happening.

00:35:47.419 --> 00:35:50.058
All the great geniuses who have lust,

00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:53.499
all useless, vulgar, cheap type have fallen.

00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:56.979
They do not stand, they cannot stand the test of time.

00:35:57.099 --> 00:36:00.459
They have all gone out. See, Christ came 2000 years back.

00:36:00.979 --> 00:36:05.139
How many artists from 2000 years back, have stood the test of time?

00:36:06.058 --> 00:36:08.339
He is still there. He is still there.

00:36:08.539 --> 00:36:11.099
Why? Because He was genuine.

00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:13.939
He was real. What He said was the truth.

00:36:14.058 --> 00:36:15.939
That's why He is still there.

00:36:16.058 --> 00:36:18.219
And that's what we have to understand that once you become

00:36:18.419 --> 00:36:20.299
that genuine Self, that is you,

00:36:20.739 --> 00:36:23.219
the beauty, the glory within you.

00:36:23.459 --> 00:36:25.699
Then you don’t have to worry, you never perish,

00:36:25.939 --> 00:36:28.179
you get into the eternal life.

00:36:29.019 --> 00:36:32.139
Now there is no end to my talking. I’ve been talking

00:36:32.379 --> 00:36:36.459
for now, at least one and a half month continuously.

00:36:37.179 --> 00:36:40.939
Apart from that I was 21 days out in tour in Europe,

00:36:41.058 --> 00:36:44.219
just 2 days in between, and again I came here.

00:36:45.219 --> 00:36:47.939
I have given so many lectures, that in London if you go,

00:36:48.058 --> 00:36:49.659
you’ll find thousands of them.

00:36:49.859 --> 00:36:53.058
I have spoken individually about ego, superego,

00:36:53.179 --> 00:36:56.058
all these things, about chakras, all the details about it,

00:36:56.179 --> 00:36:59.339
and I’ve gone through all the details.

00:36:59.539 --> 00:37:03.979
But in these 3 days whatever I could cover, I've tried to tell you,

00:37:04.219 --> 00:37:06.099
and I also allowed you to ask questions.

00:37:06.299 --> 00:37:09.419
But yesterday as you know, some stupid people came in

00:37:09.699 --> 00:37:11.539
and tried to disturb Me. Now look at them.

00:37:11.859 --> 00:37:13.739
There is, I can’t understand that,

00:37:13.979 --> 00:37:16.539
because their daughter telephoned to Me, today also,

00:37:16.819 --> 00:37:19.779
that her father has gone to work, he is not there.

00:37:20.019 --> 00:37:21.739
So they are cheating their daughter,

00:37:21.979 --> 00:37:23.699
coming and disturbing others.

00:37:23.939 --> 00:37:25.779
Abd why are they doing this?

00:37:26.019 --> 00:37:27.939
Why don’t they understand their child?

00:37:28.058 --> 00:37:30.339
They don’t believe in God, but the child believes in God,

00:37:30.539 --> 00:37:34.219
let the child, because that child is free now, in this country.

00:37:34.459 --> 00:37:36.859
You should allow the child to know about the God.

00:37:37.058 --> 00:37:39.979
Even supposing she does wrong, I say even if it is a cult,

00:37:40.099 --> 00:37:43.139
how can you stop? But they can’t see the point.

00:37:43.339 --> 00:37:47.058
That the point is, she is a different category of a person.

00:37:47.179 --> 00:37:50.339
She’s a person who’s a seeker. She has to seek.

00:37:50.539 --> 00:37:53.299
Even if she is making mistakes, they cannot stop it,

00:37:53.499 --> 00:37:55.058
that is her nature.

00:37:55.179 --> 00:37:57.699
She will never stop, till she has found it.

00:37:57.939 --> 00:37:59.859
Because that is a special category.

00:38:00.058 --> 00:38:03.058
She is not a mundane type of materialistic personality

00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:05.058
who can take just to anything.

00:38:05.219 --> 00:38:07.859
She is a person who is a seeker. I know they have done mistakes,

00:38:08.058 --> 00:38:09.659
they have gone to cults, they have ruined themselves,

00:38:09.859 --> 00:38:10.939
whatever it is.

00:38:11.059 --> 00:38:13.099
But she’ll be born again and again and will be seeking.

00:38:13.339 --> 00:38:17.859
Because she is a person who is a seeker,

00:38:18.058 --> 00:38:20.058
is a very special category,

00:38:20.219 --> 00:38:24.219
and that say, special category is at the epitome of evolution.

00:38:24.459 --> 00:38:27.419
The mundane type of vulgar, loafer type of people,

00:38:27.699 --> 00:38:29.699
are not meant for God.

00:38:29.939 --> 00:38:32.939
He is not bothered about that, just a waste product.

00:38:33.419 --> 00:38:37.099
The people who are seekers are only under His grace

00:38:37.299 --> 00:38:39.499
and He is only worried and concerned about them

00:38:39.819 --> 00:38:41.139
and not about the people

00:38:41.339 --> 00:38:44.019
who maybe are occupying very big positions or anything,

00:38:44.139 --> 00:38:46.539
I mean My husband is in the, you know,

00:38:46.859 --> 00:38:48.219
he is a secretary general and all that,

00:38:48.419 --> 00:38:49.859
but i never went to the UN, at all.

00:38:50.058 --> 00:38:52.058
I said, "I have nothing to do with your", It has nothing to do,

00:38:52.259 --> 00:38:54.819
because this is a special category of people.

00:38:55.058 --> 00:38:58.058
They will meet Me here, that`s what it is.

00:38:58.219 --> 00:39:04.219
One has to understand that is not what family you come from,

00:39:04.459 --> 00:39:09.058
what nationality you come from, or what color you have,

00:39:09.219 --> 00:39:11.058
what education you have had,

00:39:11.219 --> 00:39:14.739
but what kind of a being, the inner being you have, is important.

00:39:14.979 --> 00:39:18.219
If that is the seeker, then you get your Realization.

00:39:19.059 --> 00:39:21.219
May God bless you all.

00:39:23.459 --> 00:39:26.019
Now can you ask Me some questions?

00:39:26.139 --> 00:39:30.019
If you want to, but don’t try to dominate Me, that’s not good.

00:39:30.139 --> 00:39:32.219
Yesterday they misbehaved to such an extent.

00:39:32.419 --> 00:39:34.819
What happened? Is all right?

00:39:35.058 --> 00:39:36.219
SM: She has come?
SY: Yes she is here.

00:39:36.459 --> 00:39:38.299
She's come, she told the police.

00:39:38.699 --> 00:39:41.179
SY: She's just sitting there quietly with her mother.

00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:43.058
SM: Where?

00:39:43.179 --> 00:39:47.059
SY: Any questions? Yes.

00:39:49.339 --> 00:39:52.259
Q: Shri Mataji, when you spoke

00:39:52.859 --> 00:39:54.299
SM: Yes he is asking it.

00:39:54.499 --> 00:39:56.859
Q: all about the people from Your country

00:39:57.058 --> 00:39:59.499
who came to our country the United States,

00:39:59.779 --> 00:40:04.979
as teachers who, who are [unclear] false teachers

00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:09.059
and not very [unclear] and not realized, not realized.

00:40:10.419 --> 00:40:14.019
Are there any in Your country or in our country as teachers

00:40:14.139 --> 00:40:18.019
who do respect and [unclear] are realized people?

00:40:18.139 --> 00:40:22.058
SY: You’ve spoken of teachers and gurus who come from your country,

00:40:22.179 --> 00:40:25.779
who are either false teachers or not realized.

00:40:26.779 --> 00:40:29.659
Are there [unclear] are realized?

00:40:29.859 --> 00:40:32.939
SM: There are many, but they don`t want to come. Let`s sit.

00:40:33.058 --> 00:40:34.539
Q: I mean are there any...

00:40:34.819 --> 00:40:36.699
Agree that, I understand.

00:40:36.899 --> 00:40:39.419
There are many real ones also in India.

00:40:39.779 --> 00:40:42.059
They know about My work.

00:40:49.058 --> 00:40:51.739
There are many who are real gurus in India.

00:40:51.979 --> 00:40:55.459
And they know about My work. They respect Me very much.

00:40:56.058 --> 00:40:58.459
And I asked one of them,

00:40:58.739 --> 00:41:01.939
who was [real] one, to come to United States,

00:41:02.058 --> 00:41:04.819
because I could not come, it's dangerous.

00:41:05.058 --> 00:41:06.939
He just refused first of all.

00:41:07.058 --> 00:41:10.379
But he [unclear] and within 3 days he ran away.

00:41:10.779 --> 00:41:12.059
He said "They'll never understand me".

00:41:12.259 --> 00:41:16.058
Mother they want me to wear some horns. He would not stay.

00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:19.058
So they are. There are many who are real gurus,

00:41:19.179 --> 00:41:23.979
but they are hiding themselves in the hills and vales.

00:41:24.099 --> 00:41:27.059
And they are very strict people, I'm afraid they are not [for us].

00:41:27.259 --> 00:41:30.299
[unclear]

00:41:30.899 --> 00:41:33.539
"Because we have worked very hard to become like this

00:41:33.819 --> 00:41:37.339
and these people want to take advantage of our achievements

00:41:37.539 --> 00:41:40.058
[unclear].

00:41:40.339 --> 00:41:46.059
There is one called as Narendra Maharaj because [unclear].

00:41:46.299 --> 00:41:51.379
They say [unclear] and poor person

00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:54.139
his legs and hands were broken by other people, you see.

00:41:54.339 --> 00:41:56.939
That's what they do [unclear].

00:41:57.058 --> 00:41:59.299
Till the person [unclear]

00:41:59.499 --> 00:42:03.219
and they always trouble the right people.

00:42:04.099 --> 00:42:07.379
So I went to see him, because he was telling people,

00:42:07.539 --> 00:42:09.739
that "Now, Mother has come, so why do you want to [trouble me]?

00:42:09.939 --> 00:42:11.459
Go and see Her".

00:42:12.058 --> 00:42:14.859
And he told Me that, "If anybody troubles you Mother

00:42:15.058 --> 00:42:16.939
send him over to me".

00:42:17.299 --> 00:42:19.939
I didn't know he was such a straight man, Myself.

00:42:20.058 --> 00:42:22.859
So there was one fellow who was torturing My life,

00:42:23.058 --> 00:42:26.058
in the program often he used to come and ask such questions and,

00:42:26.219 --> 00:42:29.859
very funny type. So I told him, [unclear].

00:42:30.058 --> 00:42:33.859
[unclear] to Maharashtra.

00:42:34.058 --> 00:42:36.819
He thought, "Oh, Mother [unclear]

00:42:37.019 --> 00:42:38.459
I went to see him.

00:42:38.859 --> 00:42:41.219
After one month I saw him, he was sitting like this

00:42:41.459 --> 00:42:43.939
in the passage, [unclear].

00:42:44.059 --> 00:42:48.058
And this fellow had put his legs on his neck and was juggling.

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:51.379
And people brought him [unclear].

00:42:51.539 --> 00:42:54.299
The whole thing was horrifing, tears came into My eyes.

00:42:54.499 --> 00:42:56.419
I said, "What's the matter?"

00:42:56.739 --> 00:42:59.699
He said, "Mother, I must tell you what has happened to me,

00:42:59.899 --> 00:43:00.939
[unclear]

00:43:01.058 --> 00:43:03.139
"What happened?" "I went to that guru".

00:43:03.339 --> 00:43:04.779
"Then why? What happened?

00:43:04.979 --> 00:43:06.459
He said, "I just told [unclear] things against You".

00:43:06.739 --> 00:43:07.939
I said, "What did you tell him?"

00:43:08.058 --> 00:43:10.058
I just said that, "She gives Realization

00:43:10.219 --> 00:43:12.779
to every Tom, Dick and Harry and She should be careful

00:43:12.979 --> 00:43:14.859
[unclear] all kinds of things like this.

00:43:15.058 --> 00:43:16.939
He said, "You are wiser than Mother, are you?"

00:43:17.059 --> 00:43:19.499
And that's all he said and I slept off.

00:43:19.899 --> 00:43:22.379
In the night he [unclear] a tiger

00:43:22.779 --> 00:43:24.699
so the tiger pushed me into a ditch

00:43:24.899 --> 00:43:27.259
and then I fell down, about 3 feet down.

00:43:27.459 --> 00:43:29.339
and I broke my legs.

00:43:29.539 --> 00:43:33.059
And then he locks up

00:43:33.259 --> 00:43:36.058
[unclear]

00:43:36.219 --> 00:43:39.299
about three inch [unclear]. He said, "Now, eat it".

00:43:39.859 --> 00:43:42.059
I was there for 5-6 days like that.

00:43:42.259 --> 00:43:44.058
Then he sent somebody to pick me up,

00:43:44.179 --> 00:43:45.899
they wanted to [unclear], treat me

00:43:46.058 --> 00:43:50.099
and then they said, "Now see our guru". So they brought him there.

00:43:50.339 --> 00:43:53.419
He said, "Now you take his legs and put them in your neck

00:43:53.819 --> 00:43:57.058
and [unclear] to your Mother. She is your guru, not me".

00:43:57.779 --> 00:43:59.139
I was a really shocked at it.

00:43:59.339 --> 00:44:02.099
Another fellow, a doctor used [to think] no end of himself,

00:44:02.299 --> 00:44:03.739
and he tried to argue much with Me

00:44:03.939 --> 00:44:06.699
so I said, "You go and see [unclear]".

00:44:06.899 --> 00:44:08.899
So he went to see him.

00:44:09.058 --> 00:44:10.699
And when he went to see him, you see,

00:44:10.899 --> 00:44:14.219
he told him some sort of a thing, I don't know what he told him,

00:44:14.419 --> 00:44:17.259
but when he came back I saw he was looking thin.

00:44:17.459 --> 00:44:20.939
So I said, "Why [unclear]. What has happened?

00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:23.299
He said, "Every day I had to carry seven miles,

00:44:23.499 --> 00:44:28.058
two buckets of water". [unclear]

00:44:28.379 --> 00:44:29.699
I said, "But for what?"

00:44:29.899 --> 00:44:33.019
He said "That's what You said [unclear] do like this.

00:44:33.139 --> 00:44:35.939
So I asked this man, I said, "Why did you do like that?"

00:44:36.058 --> 00:44:39.659
He said, "For a donkey, he must be [brought] this way.

00:44:39.859 --> 00:44:41.019
You are too kind.

00:44:41.139 --> 00:44:43.058
They don't know how much we have [worked].

00:44:43.219 --> 00:44:45.859
They are extremely strict people, I've seen that.

00:44:46.058 --> 00:44:48.099
They beat their disciples sometimes.

00:44:48.299 --> 00:44:53.019
Another one I've met, was called as [unclear], something like that.

00:44:53.139 --> 00:44:54.859
And he lived [unclear].

00:44:55.058 --> 00:44:58.058
And he came to see Me in another place called Ambarnath,

00:44:58.219 --> 00:45:01.499
where his disciple was living [unclear].

00:45:03.419 --> 00:45:06.019
And this disciple took Me to see him there,

00:45:06.139 --> 00:45:08.099
in the ashram that he had.

00:45:08.379 --> 00:45:13.819
And he, as soon as we entered, you see

00:45:14.058 --> 00:45:15.939
[unclear] his disciple told me,

00:45:16.058 --> 00:45:19.099
"Mataji, my guru [unclear], very badly".

00:45:19.499 --> 00:45:21.779
So I went there, he touched My Feet and all.

00:45:21.979 --> 00:45:23.699
I said, "Why did you beat him?

00:45:23.899 --> 00:45:29.379
He said, you know when going [unclear] he was smoking.

00:45:29.539 --> 00:45:30.939
So I hit him hard".

00:45:31.058 --> 00:45:32.939
Then I said, "Really you should not have done it.

00:45:33.058 --> 00:45:35.539
If you give him Realization then he won't.

00:45:35.939 --> 00:45:37.379
But his Agnya chakra is catching.

00:45:37.779 --> 00:45:39.979
And the Agnya chakra is catching, so poor fellow, you see,

00:45:40.099 --> 00:45:42.379
he does not know to get rid of it, so he's smoking

00:45:42.779 --> 00:45:44.499
He said, "Who cleared my Agnya chakra?

00:45:44.899 --> 00:45:47.059
I cleared mine for years together, I've worked hard.

00:45:47.259 --> 00:45:48.739
Why should I [unclear]?

00:45:48.939 --> 00:45:50.379
I said, "This is five minutes job".

00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:52.058
"For You this is five minutes job".

00:45:52.219 --> 00:45:54.019
I cleared his Agnya chakra.

00:45:54.179 --> 00:45:57.899
Then on My way back, he told Me that he raised him [unclear],

00:45:58.058 --> 00:46:00.539
hang him on a well before he [unclear].

00:46:00.939 --> 00:46:04.859
[unclear] they take you to tests to much, they do this,

00:46:05.058 --> 00:46:07.899
but there are many people like that.

00:46:08.058 --> 00:46:10.058
Another one who was here [unclear]

00:46:10.179 --> 00:46:14.059
[unclear] Realization and started making money and I didn`t know.

00:46:14.259 --> 00:46:16.939
He came back and he told me that he's doing very well.

00:46:17.058 --> 00:46:18.939
But the vibrations were very bad and we discovered

00:46:19.059 --> 00:46:21.939
that he was making money out of his vibrations.

00:46:22.058 --> 00:46:25.299
And I scolded him, I said, "Why did you make money like this?"

00:46:25.499 --> 00:46:26.939
He said, "Should I become poor man?"

00:46:27.058 --> 00:46:29.459
I said, "Whatever you were doing, as if you were a teacher...

00:46:29.859 --> 00:46:31.219
Why don't you become a teacher?

00:46:31.419 --> 00:46:32.899
Why do you want to sell vibrations?

00:46:33.058 --> 00:46:35.059
Did I give you vibrations for money?"

00:46:35.259 --> 00:46:37.419
He said, "No, but I have to do it". He shouted at Me.

00:46:37.699 --> 00:46:39.939
But then he went away [unclear].

00:46:40.058 --> 00:46:42.299
And he went to see him [in Calcutta], this fellow.

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:44.099
And the description is like this,

00:46:44.299 --> 00:46:46.859
because he came back and [unclear].

00:46:47.058 --> 00:46:48.939
He said that, "As soon as I went there he started,

00:46:49.059 --> 00:46:51.859
and the guru started throwing big stones at me.

00:46:52.058 --> 00:46:53.499
So [unclear] back to the station

00:46:53.899 --> 00:46:58.219
and the people from there came and told Me that

00:46:58.499 --> 00:47:00.099
"The guru is very angry with you

00:47:00.299 --> 00:47:01.419
because you went to Mother and misbehave,

00:47:01.699 --> 00:47:03.899
and he`s not going to talk to you.

00:47:04.058 --> 00:47:06.219
So he was quite surprised. He said, "All right,

00:47:06.419 --> 00:47:07.859
I've never seen this guru, please ask him."

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:11.419
Then three times he went there and the guru was beating him,

00:47:12.058 --> 00:47:14.179
throwing stones at him.

00:47:14.379 --> 00:47:17.939
But this fellow, you see, I think human beings have this habit,

00:47:18.058 --> 00:47:21.058
the more you try to discard them, the more they'll stick to you.

00:47:21.219 --> 00:47:22.699
Otherwise if you're kind to them,

00:47:22.899 --> 00:47:24.739
they don't understand kindness perhaps.

00:47:24.979 --> 00:47:28.939
Then forth day [unclear]

00:47:29.058 --> 00:47:32.979
[unclear]

00:47:33.099 --> 00:47:36.939
[unclear]

00:47:37.058 --> 00:47:40.379
[unclear]

00:47:40.859 --> 00:47:45.899
But this fellow has been doing such wrong things, even now in a way,

00:47:46.058 --> 00:47:48.219
that he cannot come and see Me

00:47:48.419 --> 00:47:50.899
because he is making money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:51.058 --> 00:47:52.939
He is calling himself as a Sahaja Yogi

00:47:53.059 --> 00:47:56.939
and he is curing people and he is trying to befool them.

00:47:57.058 --> 00:47:59.339
And surprisingly, he is an Indian but  I can't understand

00:47:59.539 --> 00:48:01.779
why he took to such a [gain].

00:48:02.019 --> 00:48:04.299
In India we have so many Sahaja Yogis, thousands,

00:48:04.499 --> 00:48:06.299
but nobody does like this.

00:48:06.499 --> 00:48:09.058
I don`t know why he is doing like this, really.

00:48:09.419 --> 00:48:12.979
So this is what it is. There are gurus, many gurus,

00:48:13.859 --> 00:48:17.899
but they don`t want to have anything to do with others.

00:48:18.058 --> 00:48:20.058
They are very [unclear] people.

00:48:20.859 --> 00:48:24.058
I am [trying], yet I am not given up.

00:48:30.058 --> 00:48:36.058
Q: Would excessive fatigue have an effect of your Self Realization,

00:48:36.259 --> 00:48:39.459
or impair your powers of discrimination?

00:48:41.058 --> 00:48:43.419
Would excessive fatigue

00:48:43.859 --> 00:48:45.859
impair your discrimination

00:48:46.058 --> 00:48:48.299
and have an effect on your Self Realization?

00:48:48.499 --> 00:48:51.179
SM: Excessive what? SY: Fatigue, tiredness.

00:48:51.379 --> 00:48:52.699
Excessive physical exhaustion.

00:48:52.899 --> 00:48:56.179
SM: Excessive fatigue if you have is very simple to get rid of it.

00:48:56.379 --> 00:48:59.259
You see what you have to do, when you are having this fatigue,

00:48:59.459 --> 00:49:01.859
your right side is exhausted, all right?

00:49:02.058 --> 00:49:04.859
When put your left hand towards the photograph,

00:49:05.058 --> 00:49:06.899
because in the beginning you have to use My photograph.

00:49:07.058 --> 00:49:09.179
Later on you need not, but in the beginning.

00:49:09.379 --> 00:49:12.779
Even if My photograph is not there, you can put the hand,

00:49:13.019 --> 00:49:17.058
and raise your left side like this.

00:49:17.259 --> 00:49:21.699
Left. Raise the left side to the right. Like this.

00:49:21.899 --> 00:49:25.219
And put it here. Even for a heart attack it is very important.

00:49:26.058 --> 00:49:29.139
Even if you have heart attacks as hearth is [unclear]

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:32.179
you can raise your left side, raise it up

00:49:32.379 --> 00:49:34.939
take it out from your head and put it down.

00:49:35.058 --> 00:49:38.058
The fatigue will go away, you get balanced.

00:49:38.979 --> 00:49:41.259
But one should not go to extremes in Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:41.459 --> 00:49:44.058
You should work to a point then finish off.

00:49:44.339 --> 00:49:46.979
But once the energy is established,

00:49:47.099 --> 00:49:50.058
connection is established [unclear].

00:49:51.058 --> 00:49:56.299
We are very resistant, quite a lot. Look at Me.

00:50:01.459 --> 00:50:06.019
Q: I have something that is in away question

00:50:06.139 --> 00:50:09.299
but it's difficult for me to put it in that form

00:50:09.499 --> 00:50:12.179
so I would like just say something that

00:50:12.499 --> 00:50:14.819
that might make it so.

00:50:16.259 --> 00:50:19.539
I was listening with a friend yesterday,

00:50:20.058 --> 00:50:22.979
and listening just some wonderful music,

00:50:23.139 --> 00:50:27.499
and, and I had, I had some moments

00:50:28.099 --> 00:50:32.939
of, of real feeling, of real, and some more realization

00:50:33.058 --> 00:50:35.939
and sense of the beauty in the world

00:50:36.058 --> 00:50:37.459
than I have had in the past.

00:50:37.739 --> 00:50:40.979
It seems to be something that has been growing and developing

00:50:41.099 --> 00:50:43.179
with what I hear, what I see,

00:50:43.379 --> 00:50:47.819
as I am still quite a beginner on the spiritual path,

00:50:48.019 --> 00:50:52.259
but I have been on, long enough to feel this.

00:50:52.899 --> 00:50:57.058
And, and I was about to remark to my friend

00:50:57.259 --> 00:51:03.058
that such a beautiful world, and yet it seems that the more

00:51:03.219 --> 00:51:08.539
the more that we do in a positive [side] in this world

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:13.539
it seems, that there seems to be on the, always on the other extreme

00:51:13.939 --> 00:51:20.058
more problems, more, more...

00:51:20.219 --> 00:51:25.058
things that are threatening, threatening us.

00:51:25.299 --> 00:51:30.219
[unclear] and in myself I feel that as I, as I haven't tried

00:51:30.419 --> 00:51:34.859
to develop spirituality, I feel that sometimes

00:51:35.058 --> 00:51:39.379
on one hand I have moments of this type of wonders

00:51:39.779 --> 00:51:43.459
and on the other hand more and more feelings of fear.

00:51:43.899 --> 00:51:47.139
So in a way, is like an internal fear that I hope

00:51:47.339 --> 00:51:52.219
that I will survive that exploding

00:51:52.419 --> 00:51:56.859
on, on the, without destroying myself in this path,

00:51:57.058 --> 00:52:01.459
and in a larger sense I hope that the world will survive,

00:52:01.739 --> 00:52:06.339
this period of so...SY [unclear]

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:14.339
The basic conflict between what we see as a [unclear]

00:52:14.539 --> 00:52:16.939
consciousness and the beauty of things,

00:52:17.058 --> 00:52:20.179
for example the music he was listening to yesterday

00:52:20.379 --> 00:52:23.539
made him closer to [unclear].

00:52:23.939 --> 00:52:26.859
But yet on the outside he sees that struggle, that conflict,

00:52:27.058 --> 00:52:31.058
that fear and [he things what's the] solution

00:52:31.219 --> 00:52:32.739
and how the Realization....

00:52:32.939 --> 00:52:35.058
SM: You see that is what I say

00:52:35.179 --> 00:52:37.659
that unless and until the Realization is established,

00:52:37.859 --> 00:52:39.939
you don't become the master of the situation.

00:52:40.058 --> 00:52:43.299
Now wone must know that if you see a conflict or anything

00:52:43.499 --> 00:52:44.939
you don`t know how to master it.

00:52:45.058 --> 00:52:46.259
That is the point is.

00:52:46.459 --> 00:52:49.099
But if you somehow get your Realization established,

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:51.499
then what happens is that you are out of it.

00:52:51.939 --> 00:52:54.339
Because you are out of it you can handle the situation very well.

00:52:54.539 --> 00:52:56.939
And you are amazed how things work out.

00:52:57.339 --> 00:53:00.979
How things work out and how it helps you.

00:53:01.099 --> 00:53:04.259
So you don`t have to worry. You become just the master.

00:53:04.459 --> 00:53:06.859
Because you are still not the master.

00:53:07.058 --> 00:53:08.779
That`s why there is the problem.

00:53:08.979 --> 00:53:11.419
But once you are the master you handle all the situation.

00:53:11.819 --> 00:53:14.219
Then what you do is to give others.

00:53:15.058 --> 00:53:17.379
You become so confident, you give others.

00:53:17.779 --> 00:53:21.259
Now for example now, Dr. Warren went to Australia.

00:53:21.459 --> 00:53:24.058
SM: Now the amount of centers is?
SY: Eight.

00:53:24.219 --> 00:53:28.259
We have eight centers, and at least three to four thousands people

00:53:28.459 --> 00:53:30.058
were realized by him.

00:53:31.058 --> 00:53:37.819
So once you become the master, then no, nothing can disturb you.

00:53:38.019 --> 00:53:40.979
You have no fear because you are the master, You know how to handle.

00:53:41.099 --> 00:53:43.179
You are the master of the ship.

00:53:43.379 --> 00:53:46.779
When the ship is seaworthy and the master is an expert,

00:53:46.979 --> 00:53:48.539
he knows how to handle the situation.

00:53:48.939 --> 00:53:50.539
In the same way you become the master.

00:53:50.939 --> 00:53:55.059
That's the point is, you have to become the master.

00:53:57.819 --> 00:54:01.539
Make a choice. all right? The question is [unclear], please.

00:54:02.139 --> 00:54:06.058
Yes, yes, you tell. You are the [winner?].

00:54:06.659 --> 00:54:10.979
P: Teacher, on our spiritual journey, as we are seekers,

00:54:11.099 --> 00:54:15.058
how we know a true teacher from a false teacher?

00:54:16.139 --> 00:54:19.299
SY: On our Spiritual path for Realization

00:54:19.499 --> 00:54:22.699
how do we know a true teacher from a false teacher?

00:54:22.979 --> 00:54:26.139
SM: It's very simple My child, I tell you to find out.

00:54:26.339 --> 00:54:28.939
First thing is that a person who is a true teacher

00:54:29.058 --> 00:54:31.179
he never takes any money from you. He has to give you.

00:54:31.379 --> 00:54:36.299
He doesn't take anything. He cannot sell.

00:54:37.058 --> 00:54:39.419
Secondly, the life style of that person

00:54:39.699 --> 00:54:41.539
is according to his own balance.

00:54:41.819 --> 00:54:44.058
Supposing I'm a carpenter,

00:54:44.339 --> 00:54:47.058
then I live like a carpenter in complete [unclear].

00:54:47.259 --> 00:54:49.699
If I am [not], supposing I'm a wife of such and such.

00:54:49.899 --> 00:54:51.539
All right, I live with that.

00:54:51.819 --> 00:54:54.219
But I am completely detached about it.

00:54:54.419 --> 00:54:57.499
Thirdly, a person who doesn't give you

00:54:57.939 --> 00:55:01.859
the experience of the Divine,

00:55:02.259 --> 00:55:03.739
is not true.

00:55:03.979 --> 00:55:06.059
Truth is what? Not such mesmerism.

00:55:06.259 --> 00:55:09.539
Now how to understand what is their experience of the Divine.

00:55:09.939 --> 00:55:13.219
Because Divine does things which human being cannot do.

00:55:13.419 --> 00:55:16.019
Like a flower becomes a fruit. All right?

00:55:16.139 --> 00:55:20.259
Now supposing somebody makes you jump, or shout, or scream,

00:55:20.459 --> 00:55:24.058
or makes you say some things going through mantras, this, that.

00:55:24.179 --> 00:55:26.659
Anybody can do, what's so special?

00:55:26.859 --> 00:55:29.058
Any human being can do it. You can always jump,

00:55:29.219 --> 00:55:31.939
you can always shout, you can do all kinds of things.

00:55:32.058 --> 00:55:35.779
Somebody mesmerizes you, it's very simple.

00:55:36.058 --> 00:55:40.499
But if you get a cool breeze coming out of your head,

00:55:40.779 --> 00:55:43.539
and through your fingers, this cannot be done.

00:55:43.939 --> 00:55:45.939
This is divine.

00:55:46.058 --> 00:55:48.259
Anybody who does that, is a great teacher.

00:55:48.459 --> 00:55:49.539
Otherwise you become the teacher,

00:55:49.939 --> 00:55:51.899
now why you want a teacher to be followed?

00:55:52.058 --> 00:55:55.058
You become the teacher. That is why is Mother's job.

00:55:56.899 --> 00:56:00.939
Mother is the best teacher I think because she is born teacher.

00:56:01.058 --> 00:56:07.979
She has to be. And the teacher who loves, who is compassion,

00:56:10.219 --> 00:56:13.979
Is very difficult these days. I wish there were some [unclear]

00:56:14.099 --> 00:56:17.939
But they are so [unclear], so difficult.

00:56:18.058 --> 00:56:21.939
Anyone of them takes My responsibility, I would be really happy,

00:56:22.058 --> 00:56:26.058
because to travel all over the world, like this, is too much for Me.

00:56:26.179 --> 00:56:28.299
But I couldn't find anybody who will give you

00:56:28.499 --> 00:56:29.939
that love and affection.

00:56:30.058 --> 00:56:33.299
They get so annoyed and so easily disturbed.

00:56:33.499 --> 00:56:35.939
that they want to go back to their places,

00:56:36.058 --> 00:56:38.459
they don't want to face you, what to do?

00:56:38.859 --> 00:56:40.779
I wish you people become experts

00:56:40.979 --> 00:56:44.058
and do the job for Me. You will do it.

00:56:45.819 --> 00:56:47.058
SM: All right?
SY: Yes.

00:56:47.259 --> 00:56:51.179
What's the vibration, always speak [unclear] and feeling vibrations

00:56:51.379 --> 00:56:54.779
but I don't have sensation of cold.

00:56:54.979 --> 00:56:57.179
SY: Good evening.
P: I [can] get vibrations.

00:56:57.379 --> 00:56:59.019
SY: What, what [unclear]?

00:56:59.139 --> 00:57:00.499
SM: Are you feeling the cool breeze?

00:57:00.779 --> 00:57:02.459
No, that's the point. She said she feels

00:57:02.739 --> 00:57:04.819
that she is [frightened] of vibrations, but is not always cool.

00:57:05.019 --> 00:57:08.058
No, no, cool, it should be cool. It should be cool.

00:57:08.219 --> 00:57:10.899
If it is only vibrations then it's not all right.

00:57:11.058 --> 00:57:13.219
That means the cool breeze is trying to come in

00:57:13.419 --> 00:57:16.699
but there is still an obstruction. All right?

00:57:16.899 --> 00:57:19.659
It's all right. There is nothing wrong, it is all [working].

00:57:19.859 --> 00:57:21.859
It will not take much time. It's all right, doesn't matter.

00:57:22.058 --> 00:57:25.059
Just started [unclear], the feeling has started.

00:57:25.259 --> 00:57:28.899
But if it is the cool breeze coming in the hands

00:57:29.058 --> 00:57:34.139
and the cool, not very cool, but cooler type, then it is correct.

00:57:37.459 --> 00:57:40.339
I have two simple questions.

00:57:41.419 --> 00:57:46.058
The first is how to evolve [in collectivity as human race]

00:57:46.179 --> 00:57:50.499
from man to superman. Some people think this was suggested

00:57:50.779 --> 00:57:54.339
[unclear] India and Europe, that we have done so far.

00:57:54.819 --> 00:57:57.979
One at a time, yes. What is the first question? Let him.

00:57:58.099 --> 00:58:01.939
Maybe he wants to connect it with [You].

00:58:02.058 --> 00:58:09.339
And is Shri Mataji, the only manifestation of the Adi Shakti

00:58:09.539 --> 00:58:13.299
in a human body, [in these days].

00:58:16.058 --> 00:58:17.539
Man to superman.

00:58:17.819 --> 00:58:21.219
How we evolve, how we are evolving at this stage

00:58:21.419 --> 00:58:23.219
from man to superman?

00:58:23.419 --> 00:58:25.939
And is Shri Mataji,

00:58:26.059 --> 00:58:29.819
the only one who is Adi Shakti in a human body

00:58:31.699 --> 00:58:33.739
on the Earth today?

00:58:34.058 --> 00:58:39.299
SM: One answer is...
SY: Sorry ,in this century.

00:58:39.499 --> 00:58:43.499
You better ask the question. And get the vibrations as an answer.

00:58:43.779 --> 00:58:45.659
[unclear], "Mother are You an Incarnation?"

00:58:45.859 --> 00:58:48.899
Ask the question, "Mother are You the Adi Shakti?"

00:58:49.058 --> 00:58:50.819
P: Mother are you the Adi Shakti?

00:58:51.019 --> 00:58:52.459
SM: Ask three times.

00:58:52.739 --> 00:58:55.419
P: Mother are you the Adi Shakti?
SY: Again.

00:58:55.699 --> 00:58:57.219
Mother are you the Adi Shakti?

00:58:57.419 --> 00:59:00.019
SY: Are you feeling the cool vibrations on your hands?

00:59:00.139 --> 00:59:01.459
P: Yes.
SY: That's your answer.

00:59:01.739 --> 00:59:03.899
SM: That's the answer. You are comfortable.

00:59:04.058 --> 00:59:07.499
SY: You can ask any question. It will give you cool vibrations.

00:59:07.779 --> 00:59:11.459
SM: And definitely human beings are, have to evolve.

00:59:11.739 --> 00:59:16.979
They cannot [unclear] unless and until they get their Realization.

00:59:19.779 --> 00:59:23.539
This is the way you can find out whether [unclear].

00:59:24.259 --> 00:59:27.019
All absolute questions can be answered.

00:59:29.219 --> 00:59:32.139
SY: Same, people can ask, "Mother are you the Holy Ghost?"

00:59:32.379 --> 00:59:34.058
[unclear]

00:59:34.179 --> 00:59:35.379
SY: Put your hands [unclear].

00:59:35.659 --> 00:59:40.779
I think the best you put right [unclear] on the left hand side.

00:59:42.699 --> 00:59:45.379
SY: Close your eyes.
SM: Right hand.

00:59:47.699 --> 00:59:49.379
Right hand up [unclear].

00:59:49.539 --> 00:59:53.539
SY: Left towards Shri Mataji, right hand up in the air like this.

00:59:53.819 --> 00:59:56.219
No, like this [unclear].

00:59:57.899 --> 01:00:00.979
Ask it, in your heart.

01:00:07.299 --> 01:00:08.819
SM: All right?
SY: Ask it three times.

01:00:09.019 --> 01:00:11.058
Yes, it's working out [unclear].

01:00:11.659 --> 01:00:13.379
Put the hand at the back side, like this.

01:00:13.659 --> 01:00:16.779
facing like this, not [unclear].

01:00:25.899 --> 01:00:28.459
He looks so [unclear]. I could not understand. How are you?

01:00:28.739 --> 01:00:31.058
Feeling all right?

01:00:31.259 --> 01:00:34.699
What a simple thing has worked out, yes?

01:00:35.859 --> 01:00:39.219
You should come and see Me again to see about it.

01:00:39.819 --> 01:00:43.379
[unclear]

01:00:43.819 --> 01:00:46.539
SM: You are coming to the second?
SY: Yes, yes.

01:00:46.979 --> 01:00:51.779
We are having a seminar, at the weekend.

01:00:52.819 --> 01:00:55.739
about eighty miles from here. Very nice place.

01:00:55.939 --> 01:00:58.539
And i don't know, whatever it is.

01:00:58.819 --> 01:01:00.179
And those who want to come,

01:01:00.379 --> 01:01:04.019
should give their addresses to Dr. Warren.

01:01:05.219 --> 01:01:07.819
And today is the last day.

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:11.019
And I'm afraid I have to say good bye to you.

01:01:11.139 --> 01:01:13.058
I hope I'll try to come next year,

01:01:13.219 --> 01:01:15.139
but I can't say that I'll be here.

01:01:15.499 --> 01:01:19.058
But in any case, let's try to get Realization.

01:01:19.179 --> 01:01:22.259
So we put our hands again, like this, and sit comfortable.

01:01:22.459 --> 01:01:23.859
SY: [You take your shoes out].

01:01:24.259 --> 01:01:27.539
Today I think all of you have [unclear] on the heart,

01:01:27.819 --> 01:01:30.019
[little while].

01:01:32.059 --> 01:01:35.499
On the heart, more on the heart.

01:01:42.339 --> 01:01:47.379
Put your left hand towards Me, and right hand on the heart.

01:01:47.659 --> 01:01:49.099
And close your eyes,

01:01:49.299 --> 01:01:54.179
putting both the feet on the ground, separately.

01:01:54.499 --> 01:01:58.739
Separated from each other. Just put them on the ground.

01:02:12.419 --> 01:02:15.699
Now put your hand on your heart, and just close your eyes.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.859
Just close your eyes.

01:02:18.058 --> 01:02:22.419
Close your eyes. Heart.

01:02:24.459 --> 01:02:28.059
Now, today, as it is the last day,

01:02:28.259 --> 01:02:31.459
let's jut be [receptive] about it.

01:02:32.099 --> 01:02:36.058
And you have to say,

01:02:36.739 --> 01:02:42.779
in your heart, with full confidence, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

01:02:42.979 --> 01:02:46.459
Say it twelve times.

01:04:10.419 --> 01:04:14.939
You can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head, most of you.

01:04:15.979 --> 01:04:20.058
It's working very fast today. Let's see if it is there.

01:04:23.779 --> 01:04:26.499
Put your left hand towards Me.

01:04:27.058 --> 01:04:29.459
You can feel it first, and then with the right hand.

01:04:29.859 --> 01:04:33.139
See if the cool breeze is coming.

01:05:04.058 --> 01:05:06.659
All right? It's there. Most of you [have got].

01:05:06.859 --> 01:05:09.659
I'll tell you how to raise your Kundalini.

01:05:09.899 --> 01:05:11.739
Today it has worked much faster.

01:05:11.939 --> 01:05:15.058
But those who have not felt the cool breeze we'll see them [after].

01:05:15.179 --> 01:05:18.899
First of all, put your left hand in front of your Kundalini.

01:05:19.058 --> 01:05:21.339
Don't get upset if you have not felt. You'll feel.

01:05:21.539 --> 01:05:23.259
Because [unclear].

01:05:23.459 --> 01:05:26.058
Now left hand in front of your Kundalini,

01:05:26.179 --> 01:05:28.058
and right hand has to be moved

01:05:28.219 --> 01:05:31.139
here, front, below, front.

01:05:31.339 --> 01:05:34.779
Like that. We have to raise it now, ourselves.

01:05:39.899 --> 01:05:41.058
Watch your hand.

01:05:41.179 --> 01:05:45.379
Now, make your shoulders loose, and push back your head,

01:05:45.539 --> 01:05:50.859
and give them twist, and now a knot.

01:05:52.899 --> 01:05:55.459
We have to do it three times.

01:05:57.299 --> 01:06:01.058
Watch your hand with concentration, left hand.

01:06:01.219 --> 01:06:05.058
Now loosen and put the twist.

01:06:06.058 --> 01:06:08.058
And with a knot.

01:06:08.379 --> 01:06:11.059
Third time, 3 knots [have to do].

01:06:20.499 --> 01:06:27.179
One, two and three.

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:30.299
Now see if you are feeling it.

01:06:34.939 --> 01:06:39.219
All right? You can put up your hands, in the air.

01:06:39.459 --> 01:06:41.339
And now put up your head,

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:44.339
and say, "Mother, is this the Holy Ghost?"

01:06:44.539 --> 01:06:48.259
or we can say, "Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:06:52.379 --> 01:06:56.058
Is this the chaitanya lahari of the Adi Shakti?

01:07:01.058 --> 01:07:04.058
Ask the question thrice.

01:07:06.779 --> 01:07:08.139
[All you feel it?]

01:07:08.379 --> 01:07:10.259
Now let's see if you have cool breeze in the hand.

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:12.179
All right? Got it?

01:07:12.659 --> 01:07:15.299
Those who are not feeling it?

01:07:16.058 --> 01:07:18.899
All right, you see Me. Let's see them. They are not feeling it.

01:07:19.058 --> 01:07:22.459
One or two. The Sahaja Yogis will come and see you, all right?

01:07:23.058 --> 01:07:26.259
[But you get it out, you get it all right,] there's no problem.

01:07:26.819 --> 01:07:29.939
Must be some problem there. Who is the gentleman there?

01:07:30.058 --> 01:07:32.019
There's one gentleman there. Can you see [unclear]?

01:07:32.139 --> 01:07:34.979
Dan, are you there?

01:07:38.899 --> 01:07:41.339
SM: This gentleman there.
SY: [unclear]
