00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Today we had a very nice session of puja in the morning,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and to celebrate that session in an artistic way,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we have arranged this beautiful program of Kathak dancing for you.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now Kathak word, as you know, comes from the word Katha.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Katha means the story.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It means the story.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
My God bless you.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And the story is to be told,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and this is a very, very ancient style of dancing,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
which was practiced in the northern part of India,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and then part of it also went to the south,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and they used it in a different way.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Now Kathak is so ancient and so traditional,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that it has gone various changes and various aspects,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
have been expressed in this style of dancing.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
To begin with, it was originally done

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to express the stories about the gods and goddesses,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and their different way of dealing with human beings.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Then gradually it became subtler and subtler.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Then they started performing also the dances

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
about the Parabrahma Shakti and all those things.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Later on when the Muslims came to north India,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
they introduced their delicate style to this style of dancing,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and one of the Nawabs of Lucknow was very much fond of Kathak dancing,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and he himself introduced so many ideas in this.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So also the romanticism,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
not the variety of western style,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000
but the last is the relationship between the power and its deity,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and all those were performed beautifully during that time.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
All the delicate ways of expression were acquired,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
so it added another kind of a dimension to Kathak style.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Now this style has got the beauty that it is woven with the footwork,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
as you people have those tap dancing.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
It has a tremendous type of an intricate, complicated tap dancing.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
You can say one side,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
but tap dancing you don't do with the face anything with that.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I mean the face remains the same.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But in this the face has the bhavas,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
or the feelings are expressed through the face, different bhavas.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Then also the gait, how a person walks in different moods,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
in different professions, in different styles.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So the gait is also very important.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So it is not only the tap dancing,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
which is, you will see at the end,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
mostly it builds up at the end of it,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
when it becomes a very fast dancing.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But in between you will see the different gaits,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
then the different moods, see how they are expressed.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
All this is shown through the movement of the body,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
through the going forward, backward,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and everything has a meaning.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Apart from that the face changes with every feeling,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
with one feeling say of anger.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Then suddenly the another feeling of love,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and this can be expressed very clearly.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Sometimes one person does both the actions,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
like the mother of Krishna and the child of Krishna,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
would be the same person, and they can act.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
But sometimes two persons do this.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So I am very happy that we have Sahaja Yogi,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Matthews you know, he has taken to this dancing,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and there are so many other Sahaja Yogi,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Pedro and other people who are learning Kathar dancing,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
which they find it very interesting.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But it's a study and a tremendous discipline,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
an Indian dancing or any Indian instrument,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
or any Indian music or paintings or any art,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
cannot be learned without proper disciplining yourself.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
You have to have a tremendous discipline

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and very hard work.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Indian music as you know, people have to sing for hours together,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
to get to the stage even.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So it is not just that people can do it without any practice.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So the technique has to be learned,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and spontaneity works it out,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the technique in a beautiful way.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Now everybody will be surprised that in Kathar dancing,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
the tabla that is played,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the avartanas, the movement of the percussions are fixed.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But the number of these fixed, say, one tala is,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
you can go on with it,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and you have to come to the first note.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Any number of times you might move,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
but you have to come to the first note,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and it is all built up.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
The whole, what we call the bol,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
is the sound of the tabla,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
whatever are the different sounds of the tabla,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
are built up with the sound of the bells in the feet.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So it is a very intricate science,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and requires very good character,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and very steady mind,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and a very upright level of understanding.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Otherwise you cannot acquire this great art.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I am very happy today that we have such a great artist like

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Mr. Pawar with us,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
who is a very well-known,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
of a very high repute in India,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
a person who is going to show us this dancing.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Most surprising is that he is from Maharashtra,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and you all love Maharashtra very much,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and you will always like Maharashtrians,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and he has so many qualities of those Maharashtrians,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and he is from the same caste as myself,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
is what you call the Marathas,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
he is also a Maratha,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and the beauty about the whole thing,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I feel, is that Maharashtrians,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I have never seen them taking to Kathak dancing,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
because Maharashtrians being very orthodox about dancing,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
as this Kathak style came to Maharashtra,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
the cheap women learnt it,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and started using it for tamashas and all that,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
though they are also very great dancers,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I must say, in our folklore.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So the respectable people didn't think proper

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
for their daughters or their family people

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
to see that dancing,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
because according to them it was cheap type dancing,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
but even that is the same style as Kathakis,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
but not to that extent,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
so much of a formal education

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and so much of traditional training in that is given.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So it is more manoeuvring they do,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and they dance in that fashion,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
same style as the Kathak style.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So this style was later on also,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
as I told you, was taken up in the south,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and they use it for their dancing called as Tilana.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
The same style is used there,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
is from the word Tarana,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
because when these people play on the harmonium,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that or that tune is used as the Tarana,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
what they have picked up,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and that's why they call it Tilana.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So there is a very big integration

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
of various cultures in this dance,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and Mr. Pawar has been so beautifully

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
able to grasp the essence of it,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and he's a Sahaja Yogi too,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and his wife is another Sahaja Yogi,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and they are great dancers,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and I really admire the way they precisely,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
they know the art,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and the way they expose it,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and the way they do it spontaneously.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It's very remarkable that we should have

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
such a great artist, so well known,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
among us to celebrate the Guru Puja,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and his wife being not so well,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and his daughter, whose name is Asavari Pawar,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
is going to dance,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and she's also another very great dancer.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So we have on Tabla,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Mr. Misran, whom you have heard many times,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
who is another great, very well known Tabla player.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
You can see from the way he has acquired

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
this great art of playing Tabla.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Tabla is, as you see, is a simple thing,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
made out of a hollow wood,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and covered with a parched,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
you can say a parched skin,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and a little bit of this black thing is nothing,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
but like a carbon is put on top,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and the way it is played at different points

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
by putting your fingers on the percussion,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
the way it is done, I mean the amount of varieties

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
people can create out of simple things

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
is really so remarkable,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and to practice it one has to really dedicate to it,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and one has to have really rhythm within yourself.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So the whole thing is interwoven between each other,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and it's a very beautiful blending.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
With our Sahaja Yoga we have to say

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that it's a great blessing,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that such a great artist like him

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
has taken to Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
It's a very big thing for us.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
There are many other artists we have

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
who have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
As you know, those, as like Debuchodri

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
is another Sahaja Yogi we have.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
We have another one, Jasraj,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and also we have Pandit Bhimsen Joshi

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
who is another artist,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Karekar is another artist.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
There are so many artists

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
who are musicians who have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
But as far as the dancing is concerned,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I will give the highest marks to Mr. Pawar

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
who is taking so much interest in it.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
By God's grace today he could make it to come here,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and we all should give him a great hand

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
for coming down and honoring this occasion.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Thank you.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
First of all he will be doing

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Saraswati Vandana.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Saraswati you know very well

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and he will be doing Saraswati Vandana

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and perhaps it may be the same

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Shloka which you know where they describe.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Saraswati with the white dress

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and the way she is sitting with the Veena
