WEBVTT

00:47.087 --> 00:50.865
[A little child calls loudly:
“Mataji! Jai!”.]

00:56.740 --> 01:05.563
Today's puja we have arranged of Durga
or the Kali.

01:05.936 --> 01:14.911
That is the destroying form of the Goddess
of all the evil and negativity.

01:15.112 --> 01:19.329
This we had to do it in France,

01:19.530 --> 01:27.738
because I feel very strongly that day
by day, in general,

01:27.939 --> 01:32.795
France is going down and down and down.

01:32.996 --> 01:35.283
While you people are coming up,

01:35.484 --> 01:40.646
the rest of the France is in the most
pitiable condition.

01:40.847 --> 01:46.788
Firstly, as you understand, is the Catholic
church,

01:46.989 --> 01:52.174
which - perhaps you are not aware of,
perhaps maybe -

01:52.375 --> 01:57.664
because you don't read any other languages,

01:57.865 --> 02:03.614
you just read French compulsorily
by this country.

02:03.815 --> 02:11.106
So you have no international views
or international news

02:11.307 --> 02:19.639
that this Catholic church has done
so many horrible things in the past,

02:19.840 --> 02:25.569
that is unbelievable that they have
anything to do with God.

02:25.770 --> 02:35.802
They burnt many cardinals in the hearth -
roasted them.

02:38.692 --> 02:42.720
Not only that, they killed so many people

02:42.921 --> 02:46.870
who ever tried to utter a word about them.

02:47.071 --> 02:51.730
They were much worse than Muslim people.

02:52.023 --> 02:56.886
They went to other countries like South
America, America -

02:57.087 --> 03:04.451
all these places they're all Catholics -
even our country.

03:04.665 --> 03:12.657
And they killed millions and millions
of people.

03:15.881 --> 03:20.323
Now as this is Kruta Yuga that has started,

03:20.524 --> 03:23.670
one of the things as I said yesterday
is that:

03:23.871 --> 03:28.245
you will have to pay for whatever you
have done,

03:28.446 --> 03:32.846
on mass scale or individual scale.

03:35.418 --> 03:38.604
If that is the case,

03:38.805 --> 03:42.990
then one must know that France has to pay
a lot

03:43.191 --> 03:48.704
and this Catholic church has to pay more.

03:49.776 --> 03:54.374
Catholic church has just taken out yarns
out of their heads

03:54.575 --> 03:59.573
and started a theory of original sin.

03:59.774 --> 04:04.847
That's how to condemn every other
Incarnation, every other Prophet -

04:05.048 --> 04:07.556
that they were all with original sin.

04:07.757 --> 04:10.789
And even they said Mary was born with
original sin,

04:10.990 --> 04:15.337
for many popes they were discussing it.

04:17.171 --> 04:23.208
This shows that this whole hocus-pocus
religion of Catholic church

04:23.409 --> 04:30.166
had to establish itself by forcing people,
by torturing them,

04:30.367 --> 04:37.694
by taking all their ideas into their
own control,

04:37.895 --> 04:43.131
give them funny ideas like original sin.

04:43.332 --> 04:50.508
Another is that you must confess, giving
them the left Vishuddhis.

04:50.730 --> 04:56.035
They treated women as nothing

04:56.236 --> 05:00.368
and to Mother of Mary they called Her
a woman.

05:00.569 --> 05:04.221
And this Paul, as I told you yesterday,
is a fact.

05:04.435 --> 05:08.454
Now it's necessary for Sahaja Yogis
to understand

05:08.655 --> 05:17.512
how this Catholic church is so dangerous
and has been doing such harm.

05:17.713 --> 05:22.357
As there has been so many books about it -

05:22.558 --> 05:28.220
that you people don't read, because
it's not in French.

05:28.713 --> 05:34.710
There are English books from America -
you must learn English.

05:34.911 --> 05:38.769
It's very important now I feel, that
all the French must know English,

05:38.970 --> 05:41.853
they must read English.

05:42.054 --> 05:46.994
French will not give you the international
personality

05:47.195 --> 05:51.031
that you are supposed to acquire.

05:51.245 --> 05:54.933
You had some scholarship, not much.

05:55.134 --> 05:58.468
The real scholarship comes from England

05:58.669 --> 06:06.421
and also from America in English language,
and also from India.

06:06.622 --> 06:11.957
One gentleman who tried to translate
all these things in UNESCO,

06:12.158 --> 06:15.613
he was thrown out by your media.

06:15.820 --> 06:20.794
Your media is taking full advantage that
you don't read any other newspapers;

06:20.995 --> 06:24.353
they are doing whatever they feel like.

06:24.554 --> 06:31.994
All kinds of scandals, all kinds
of sensationalization -

06:32.195 --> 06:36.132
whatever they want to write, they write
in free press.

06:36.333 --> 06:41.616
On one side there's suppression of natural
life of human beings,

06:41.817 --> 06:44.991
let them to go to Freud.

06:45.192 --> 06:48.694
When Freud is the dirtiest man you
could think of,

06:48.895 --> 06:52.062
who has put his ideas into your head.

06:52.263 --> 06:59.017
But as if you are already brainwashed
people that you accepted all that.

06:59.218 --> 07:03.257
How could you accept Freud? If Freud
had come to India,

07:03.458 --> 07:06.363
they would have killed him in no time!

07:06.564 --> 07:10.450
What happens is that, somehow or other -
I don't know what is the reason,

07:10.651 --> 07:15.055
I don't know where to place it, but
the wisdom is not there.

07:15.256 --> 07:18.861
There is no maturity, there is no wisdom.

07:19.062 --> 07:23.678
America I can understand because it is only
two-three hundred years old.

07:23.879 --> 07:27.901
But what about the French? They have
not been able

07:28.102 --> 07:32.946
to mature but they have become extremely
frivolous.

07:33.147 --> 07:36.449
Maturity is finished.

07:36.650 --> 07:43.401
One of the reasons could be that they want
that you should be always young.

07:43.602 --> 07:49.974
In India, young people are called
as stupid:

07:51.078 --> 07:56.543
you call it gadha pachisi, means
at twenty-five years they are donkeys.

07:56.744 --> 08:02.591
They are never regarded as sensible people
to be followed.

08:03.186 --> 08:10.419
And gradually by this movement from
Catholic church to Freud,

08:10.623 --> 08:14.347
what has happened that you haven't got
your own personality

08:14.548 --> 08:19.141
to understand what is right and what is
wrong.

08:19.342 --> 08:22.730
Of course, I must say Sahaja Yogis must
have done lots of punyas

08:22.931 --> 08:28.393
and must be very courageous people to be
born in this country.

08:28.594 --> 08:32.533
Otherwise I don't know how you could have
taken your birth here.

08:32.734 --> 08:41.297
The law is so funny that they said it
depends on the mood of the magistrate,

08:41.498 --> 08:48.226
As if, you see, the magistrate doesn't
know the law.

08:48.822 --> 08:53.209
Such a stupid country in modern times
I've never known.

08:53.410 --> 08:56.879
Nowhere in the world there's such a stupid
law as it is here.

08:57.080 --> 09:01.137
Of course, in America, there is no justice,
they do what they like.

09:01.338 --> 09:06.816
But here is so-called modern people.

09:07.017 --> 09:11.225
What is their condition is that they have
no sense of law.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.903
If you ask them, "What is the law?"
They don't care.

09:14.104 --> 09:16.744
It's the mood of the magistrate.

09:16.945 --> 09:21.149
Now supposing he has had a big drink
in the last night,

09:21.350 --> 09:25.764
second day he comes with a hangover,
so finished.

09:25.965 --> 09:33.020
And then he will be very much biased
towards the drunkards only.

09:33.666 --> 09:41.305
So, here it is becoming such a horrible
society

09:41.506 --> 09:48.632
that Indians would be shocked, beyond
doubt, but nothing but prostitution.

09:53.813 --> 09:57.857
To see and to be seen.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.411
Why?

10:00.612 --> 10:03.392
Every woman has to dress up in such a way

10:03.593 --> 10:10.275
that she should be attractive, for what?
Is she a prostitute?

10:12.821 --> 10:19.454
All kinds of bathroom cultures developed.

10:19.655 --> 10:25.799
For example French bath, you know what
it means, all over the world.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.359
It's a very dirty habit of laziness,
it comes because of drinking.

10:32.560 --> 10:36.189
If you drink too much, next morning you
are so lethargic

10:36.390 --> 10:40.779
that you take just a French bath and
go away.

10:40.980 --> 10:43.483
So, please try to remember as French
Sahaja Yogis,

10:43.684 --> 10:49.193
that your task is much more difficult
than the task of other countries,

10:49.394 --> 10:57.515
because it lacks completely wisdom.

10:58.085 --> 11:03.393
Neither you'll find in your institutions,
nor in your government,

11:03.594 --> 11:11.227
nor in any education.

11:11.762 --> 11:16.663
It's lacking wisdom completely.

11:18.262 --> 11:22.001
And to have wisdom, according to these
Freudian people,

11:22.202 --> 11:26.269
is that you are egoistical!

11:29.017 --> 11:34.101
They have such funny ideas from the yarn
of Mr. Freud

11:34.302 --> 11:39.276
that no sensible man would accept.

11:40.482 --> 11:46.203
But people have lost their senses,
and like blotting paper,

11:46.404 --> 11:56.567
whatever is filthy, destructive, horrible,
subhuman, they try to absorb.

11:57.553 --> 12:01.743
Supposed to be Christian nation.

12:05.391 --> 12:09.781
Please, all Sahaja Yogis must understand:

12:09.982 --> 12:16.057
you must get hold of books and find out,
where are we?

12:16.258 --> 12:20.610
I worked very hard in France, you know
that very well.

12:20.811 --> 12:23.861
I used to think, this is the gate of hell.

12:24.062 --> 12:27.825
But it is much worse than that,

12:28.026 --> 12:33.097
it's a mire of filth. And you are born here

12:33.298 --> 12:39.655
and you have become like lotuses,
so fragrant and beautiful,

12:39.856 --> 12:42.612
you'll have to fight it out.

12:42.813 --> 12:45.752
I am always with you, all My powers
with you.

12:45.953 --> 12:49.127
But remember that you have to fight
the society,

12:49.328 --> 12:54.872
you have to save so many people, you have
to rescue them.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.565
Children are given liberty, "Do what
you like."

12:59.766 --> 13:02.819
They have no sense of liberty!

13:03.020 --> 13:05.469
Supposing there's an aeroplane,

13:05.670 --> 13:08.472
which was not fixed properly and made
to fly.

13:08.673 --> 13:11.959
What will happen to the aeroplane?

13:12.160 --> 13:18.461
If the children are given liberty without
the right sense of their duty

13:18.662 --> 13:23.403
and the right sense about themselves,
what will happen to them?

13:23.604 --> 13:30.761
Why children are born to parents?
It is to get spoiled,

13:30.962 --> 13:36.273
to have liberty or to get some guidance?

13:36.656 --> 13:40.178
You cannot guide your children.

13:40.379 --> 13:45.948
They are so rude, they are so arrogant.

13:46.149 --> 13:52.004
They have gone off, completely.

13:52.205 --> 13:55.917
You know for one month we had to struggle
with these western children.

13:56.140 --> 13:59.346
And we had come to the point of urge
of closing down that school

13:59.547 --> 14:03.656
because they were really violent children,

14:03.857 --> 14:06.857
as if coming from some jungle.

14:07.064 --> 14:11.115
Even the jungle animals have some sense.

14:12.051 --> 14:15.781
So you have to think about your children.

14:15.982 --> 14:19.338
What's going to happen to your children?

14:19.539 --> 14:23.429
What is going to be their situation?

14:23.802 --> 14:29.745
If they are going to live in the same
manner in this dirt,

14:29.946 --> 14:37.220
these children will turn out to be waste,
just a waste!

14:37.421 --> 14:43.324
They will have no education, no character,
no personality,

14:43.525 --> 14:53.264
they'll end up with AIDS or with drugs
or something like that.

14:53.465 --> 14:59.636
I do not see any future for the children
of France, no future.

15:02.819 --> 15:08.224
And you have to fight that, "We want
to have future for our children,

15:08.425 --> 15:11.084
we don't want them to be ruined."

15:11.285 --> 15:15.301
And you must have courage to fight it.

15:15.502 --> 15:19.812
It's very important to have courage.

15:20.013 --> 15:25.104
If you do not have the courage, you cannot
fight it.

15:25.305 --> 15:31.371
And today's puja is to give that courage
in your hearts.

15:31.572 --> 15:37.451
See it all around you, what's happening?

15:37.652 --> 15:41.374
You are all nicely enjoying yourself
in the realm of God,

15:41.575 --> 15:43.473
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

15:43.674 --> 15:47.955
But what about the rest of the people?

15:48.173 --> 15:53.084
The majority of the people, where are they
going?

15:56.470 --> 16:10.397
What is going to be the future of this
horrible Mooladhara place?

16:12.151 --> 16:17.760
Now Freud has been discovered
as a fraudulent man,

16:17.961 --> 16:20.874
and now there are books after so many
years,

16:21.075 --> 16:25.054
when he has already ruined the people
all over the world.

16:25.255 --> 16:29.735
But the worst of all, they have ruined
here.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.598
It's a responsibility specially
of the women I think,

16:36.799 --> 16:40.644
because they are responsible for
the society.

16:40.845 --> 16:46.221
The society of France has gone to dogs

16:46.657 --> 16:52.837
and for you to now take up upon yourself

16:53.038 --> 16:59.471
to talk against this kind of anarchy

16:59.672 --> 17:05.082
that is working out the destruction
of your families.

17:06.825 --> 17:15.379
If the women decide, I am sure, they
can very, very easily work it out.

17:15.580 --> 17:20.649
Instead of asking for liberation
nonsensical,

17:21.225 --> 17:25.874
you better ask for the ascent of this
country.

17:26.075 --> 17:29.236
I know, I've worked very hard and you are
all there.

17:29.437 --> 17:32.229
I am very happy to see that you all
are there

17:32.430 --> 17:44.084
to fulfill the desires of the Divine.

17:44.285 --> 17:50.010
Because now you should know in a very
big way,

17:50.211 --> 17:56.042
masses of masses of people will be
destroyed.

17:59.821 --> 18:04.261
Not from without but from within.

18:05.995 --> 18:11.945
Suddenly you'll hear so many millions
disappear with this disease.

18:15.799 --> 18:20.906
Also you must protect yourself, all of you:

18:21.107 --> 18:28.624
always give yourself a bandhan; always
lead a clean life.

18:28.825 --> 18:35.051
There are certain hygienic rules of Sahaja
Yoga, please try to follow them.

18:35.252 --> 18:38.424
Do not neglect it.

18:38.625 --> 18:42.644
If somebody gets AIDS, you'll not have him
in Sahaja Yoga,

18:42.845 --> 18:47.294
whatever may be the conditions, whatever
may be the reason.

18:49.387 --> 18:54.787
You have to be very careful, also I would
say never treat a AIDS patient.

18:54.988 --> 18:57.573
Like the one yesterday who was arguing
with Me,

18:57.774 --> 19:01.890
actually because they have only two types
of people:

19:02.091 --> 19:09.117
one who are arrogant and another one
which always

19:11.347 --> 19:16.129
think that it's better they should die.
They have no will to live.

19:16.330 --> 19:20.848
So there are only two types of people,
either right-sided or left-sided.

19:21.049 --> 19:25.605
And they can never ascend. We have tried,
we have tried.

19:25.806 --> 19:28.915
Of course, one person is living
for the last seven years,

19:29.153 --> 19:34.560
but still he has no faith in himself.

19:34.761 --> 19:40.066
Maybe next generation might be better on,
if they come back.

19:40.267 --> 19:44.435
But as far as this generation is concerned,

19:44.636 --> 19:49.391
you should know your responsibility
is very great.

19:49.592 --> 19:54.335
All the Sahaja Yogis must take a vow

19:54.536 --> 19:59.372
that they'll fight this society and try
to save their country

19:59.573 --> 20:05.138
and their countrymen from a complete
disaster.

20:05.339 --> 20:08.707
There is going to be no war,

20:08.908 --> 20:13.975
only they will fight themselves and die.

20:15.951 --> 20:18.232
It's a very serious matter.

20:18.433 --> 20:23.809
For that, we decided to have this puja
of Durga today

20:24.010 --> 20:28.278
that all negativity should be destroyed.

20:28.479 --> 20:35.485
So many Deities build up the body of Kali.

20:35.686 --> 20:41.202
Every part of Her body was created
by a Deity, looked after by a Deity,

20:41.403 --> 20:49.187
and is also, later on, is reflected
in you all.

20:51.381 --> 20:55.455
So they say that God has made human beings
in His own image,

20:55.656 --> 20:59.277
I would say, I've made you in My own
image,

20:59.478 --> 21:04.391
all the Deities at your disposal.

21:04.592 --> 21:08.889
They're all with you, and they have created
you - if you see it minutely -

21:09.090 --> 21:14.379
it is the Deities who have brought forth
all the beauty that you had.

21:14.580 --> 21:24.178
They have made all this beautiful
congregation, beautiful transformation,

21:24.379 --> 21:32.034
and they have created such angelic people
out of you.

21:32.710 --> 21:35.306
They are always working it out,

21:35.507 --> 21:40.980
but one thing you have to do is to have
the drive.

21:41.181 --> 21:46.332
You had pure desire to ascend, but
for what?

21:46.533 --> 21:50.964
You want to have the light, but for what?

21:51.165 --> 21:55.111
You want to become gurus, for what?

21:55.312 --> 21:59.905
To save people, for their salvation.

22:00.135 --> 22:03.549
Only through your channels I can work out
Sahaja Yoga.

22:03.750 --> 22:06.981
If I could work out Myself, I would have.

22:07.182 --> 22:11.739
It's not question of killing one rakshasa.

22:11.940 --> 22:16.855
God knows how many there are, rakshasas
and rakshasas.

22:17.056 --> 22:23.062
And they are everywhere, even within you
they were.

22:23.263 --> 22:26.759
Now they have gone away.

22:30.103 --> 22:35.893
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja
Yoga, that's very important.

22:36.094 --> 22:39.088
I knew the puja would be very late,
because Kali's puja

22:39.289 --> 22:45.652
is always done in the night, after twelve.
So it had to be this way.

22:45.853 --> 22:48.287
Though last night I slept at four o'clock
and I,  tonight,

22:48.488 --> 22:55.483
I don't know what time I will sleep -
it all works out. It's all worked out.

22:55.684 --> 22:58.734
But you have to have deliberations
and you have to think,

22:58.935 --> 23:01.547
“What can we do to change this?”

23:01.748 --> 23:08.538
Why not write some books, why not write
some experiences?

23:08.739 --> 23:14.257
Get them published in French only. Let
the French know what’s happening outside.

23:14.458 --> 23:18.610
Get some of the books translated –

23:19.972 --> 23:26.226
some American books, some English books.
At least give quotations from there.

23:26.427 --> 23:30.581
How they are unaware. First this Catholic
church has to go away.

23:30.782 --> 23:37.014
It will, no doubt, I am sure about it.
They are literally frightened of us.

23:42.929 --> 23:49.566
And we have to now really show them
what we are capable of.

23:51.598 --> 23:59.370
And the funniest thing is that a president
has chosen

23:59.571 --> 24:01.938
his lady-friend as the prime minister.

24:02.139 --> 24:09.133
I mean, it’s not possible in any sensible
country. It’s never heard of.

24:09.334 --> 24:14.475
I must say, English are thousand times
better.

24:15.363 --> 24:17.801
They are really very good.

24:18.002 --> 24:21.861
At least, as far as administration
is concerned,

24:22.062 --> 24:26.024
as far as their parliament is concerned.
Their justice is not stupid like this,

24:26.225 --> 24:31.159
it’s based on law, not based on the mood
of a magistrate.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.662
How you are still continuing with such
stupidity

24:34.863 --> 24:39.579
which are really even before medieval age:

24:39.780 --> 24:45.683
primitive, people are absolutely primitive
to accept such laws.

24:45.884 --> 24:53.803
At least you can write a book about
the strange laws of French, one title.

24:58.013 --> 25:01.644
How it has harmed. There is a very nice
book, “Fraudulent Freud”.

25:01.845 --> 25:06.227
Please read that, and see how Freud
has ruined the French,

25:06.428 --> 25:09.861
how their brains are twisted, how they
have twisted ideas.

25:10.062 --> 25:14.260
You are all so intelligent, clever people.

25:16.633 --> 25:23.996
So if not with the sword, Kali has to work
through the pen.

25:30.921 --> 25:37.017
I never knew it was in that bad shape,
though I knew it was.

25:38.478 --> 25:43.643
So this is a challenge for all of us,

25:43.844 --> 25:50.924
and let Me see what you can write, all
of you, put together your experiences:

25:51.125 --> 25:54.455
how the French parents behave, how
the grandparents behave,

25:54.656 --> 25:58.896
what’s happening in this country and
all that.

26:04.198 --> 26:08.391
They are living in fool’s paradise.

26:10.509 --> 26:18.749
They don’t know how destruction is just
hanging over their heads.

26:22.562 --> 26:27.783
Though you are all saved, but you have
to think of others,

26:27.984 --> 26:35.469
that is what Sahaja Yoga is, that is not
only that we care for the bhaktas –

26:35.670 --> 26:44.109
like Kali just wanted to protect
the bhaktas, the sadhakas.

26:44.847 --> 26:53.841
But you have to protect many, many more
people.

26:54.042 --> 27:00.780
You have all the powers, just assume them
and use them.

27:02.582 --> 27:05.536
You can do it.

27:05.737 --> 27:09.096
Your media is the worst of all

27:09.297 --> 27:13.588
and we can start a newspaper also calling
it anti-media.

27:13.789 --> 27:17.012
What can they do to us?

27:17.213 --> 27:22.410
Or some sort of an independent name,
we can give it.

27:22.957 --> 27:26.531
And it should be open for people who
are suffering

27:26.732 --> 27:33.170
from media sensationalization.
They can write:

27:33.371 --> 27:37.165
how the media is harming them, how they
are giving false reports and things.

27:37.366 --> 27:40.492
We can! Why not?

27:43.564 --> 27:46.793
I am sure it will work out.

27:48.374 --> 27:53.378
Think it over what you can do with
your pen.

27:57.110 --> 28:01.487
Whatever you have gained, whatever you
are enjoying: beautiful music,

28:01.688 --> 28:05.184
all the pujas, everything. But think
of others.

28:05.385 --> 28:11.878
They are already drunk and tossing
their heads on their pillows.

28:12.079 --> 28:18.213
Think of them. They, when will they feel
this joy?

28:18.432 --> 28:21.057
I simply feel pity for them

28:21.258 --> 28:25.616
that they should have taken to all these
bad things,

28:25.817 --> 28:27.818
because of the suppression of the Catholic
church.

28:28.019 --> 28:30.226
It’s the Catholic church which has
suppressed them,

28:30.427 --> 28:33.588
that’s why they have come to this.
No other way –

28:33.789 --> 28:38.227
reason why they should accept this kind
of thing.

28:42.516 --> 28:47.243
In Sahaja Yoga, we do not do all these
things, we are in the centre.

28:47.444 --> 28:51.465
We do not have this kind of problems,
because we don’t suppress anyone,

28:51.666 --> 28:55.790
nor do we go to the other extreme
of indulgences.

28:55.991 --> 28:59.440
I think the whole Europe can be divided
into two types of people:

28:59.641 --> 29:03.807
one are Anglo-Saxons, and others are
Latins.

29:04.008 --> 29:08.901
Anglo-Saxons are right-sided and the Latins
are left-sided:

29:09.102 --> 29:16.498
they cry, weep, miserable, they indulge
into dirt and filth.

29:17.127 --> 29:20.196
Just these two types they are.

29:20.397 --> 29:26.056
Now, unluckily you are in the Latin side.

29:26.814 --> 29:33.165
So here, Catholic church is prospering.

29:33.800 --> 29:39.251
Now, if you see to the Latin side and
understand

29:39.452 --> 29:42.833
to what extent they have gone to the left
side,

29:43.034 --> 29:48.125
and getting to the left side what diseases
you get, very nicely,

29:48.326 --> 29:51.619
make a list of them.

29:51.820 --> 29:56.292
So what I said will work out in France:

29:56.493 --> 30:00.311
the left-sided incurable diseases.

30:00.512 --> 30:04.086
As it is, you walk on the street, you find
at least three, four

30:04.287 --> 30:09.518
mad people, lunatic people walking,
you’ll find them.

30:10.321 --> 30:15.066
Very simple it is. You don’t have to go
to the lunatic asylum, on the street!

30:15.267 --> 30:20.936
They’ll be all talking and saying things,
but it’s all there.

30:21.137 --> 30:24.574
“That’s why they drink, that’s why they
are miserable.”.

30:24.774 --> 30:30.335
I do not know what are the statistics
of the diseases.

30:34.743 --> 30:39.580
So the problem is extremely grave,
very grave.

30:39.781 --> 30:43.098
And you have to work it out,

30:43.299 --> 30:48.214
with the gravity of your Gurupada which
you have asked Me the other day –

30:48.415 --> 30:54.161
you asked for the status of a guru,
for ladies as well as for men.

30:54.362 --> 30:58.917
And I said, “All right, start!”

31:00.210 --> 31:05.477
I hope you all have heard the song
I’ve made, for asking.

31:05.678 --> 31:08.108
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

31:08.309 --> 31:09.892
All right, once they will sing that song.

31:10.093 --> 31:12.389
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]
All right.

31:12.590 --> 31:23.002
They will sing that song to you. There are
different requests from the Mother,

31:23.203 --> 31:27.366
and in this the last one is that: “Mother,
now you give us

31:27.567 --> 31:31.727
the Gurupada, the status of a guru.”

31:31.928 --> 31:37.476
But every guru has a duty: to cleanse
the society in which he lives.

31:37.677 --> 31:40.737
It’s his duty, he has to fight it.

31:40.938 --> 31:45.489
Christ fought it alone, so many saints
fought it alone,

31:45.690 --> 31:50.787
they were treated very badly, put in jail,
given poisons, things, but they fought it.

31:50.988 --> 31:56.088
In the same way you stand on Truth,
and you have to fight it.

31:58.346 --> 32:01.721
Because you are saints.

32:05.253 --> 32:07.619
May God bless you.
