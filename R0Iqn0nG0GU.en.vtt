00:00:05.013 --> 00:00:14.140
This sixth chakra was created in the human beings

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.245
when he started thinking.

00:00:18.537 --> 00:00:30.381
Thinking is language expressed.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.348
If we do not have a language we cannot think.

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:43.974
But it does not mean there is no thought coming into us.

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:47.545
If we cannot express it,

00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:51.479
it does not mean there is no thought process working in us.

00:00:51.672 --> 00:00:57.307
But at that subtle stage when the thoughts are coming to us

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.355
they are not in language,

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:06.270
so they are not communicated to us,

00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:09.917
and that’s why if we do not have language

00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:16.452
we cannot understand what we are thinking.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:22.376
That’s why you must have seen children cannot communicate to us

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:27.045
what they want because they cannot say what they are wanting.

00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:31.272
They feel the urge in the stomach

00:01:31.395 --> 00:01:35.827
and they want to ask for, say, water or something,

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:39.364
but they can’t say it to us,

00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:46.908
and that’s why they cannot think what they have to say about.

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:52.701
But afterwards when you start thinking

00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:54.855
and putting it into language,

00:01:54.936 --> 00:01:59.641
that language is stored in our brain as shown in the picture

00:01:59.722 --> 00:02:04.584
on the left hand side and also on the right hand side

00:02:04.665 --> 00:02:08.654
of that yellow and black, then it comes back to us,

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:15.622
later on as, thought waves. As if somebody is talking to us.

00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:19.966
But before the language starts,

00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:23.006
we can call it the inspiration

00:02:23.087 --> 00:02:26.124
or the thought process at the very early stage,

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:35.251
comes to us in certain forms,
and those forms are in light and shade.

00:02:35.332 --> 00:02:39.413
They are not in language but in light and shade.

00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:44.707
And after coming to Sahaja Yoga
if you go deep into your thoughts

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:53.300
you’ll find they are nothing but lights and shade
that are covering our Agya chakra.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:03:05.007
One after another a light and shade, like a circular lighthouse,

00:03:05.155 --> 00:03:09.269
they give a kind of a pattern in our head.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:17.638
Now these patterns are moulded into language
by us at a very early stage

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:22.208
and these are sort of filled into the cups of language

00:03:22.322 --> 00:03:26.086
and then these cups are kept reserved in the brain

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.734
and they come to us that way.

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:37.249
When we think we really understand
because it’s a language that comes to us.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.495
So what happens to the animals? Do they think or not?

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:48.412
They get a thought, an inspiration

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:52.952
but they won’t be just thinking about it.

00:03:53.127 --> 00:04:01.016
Now, these inspirations come to them
as words when they start living with human beings.

00:04:01.097 --> 00:04:05.499
So these inspirations go into the thought again as we do.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.702
For example you give somebody a name,

00:04:07.793 --> 00:04:12.519
say you call him say Tom, or something – you call a dog

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.939
– so now he knows that this word means ‘calling me’.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.955
So he connects himself with that word.
But when he does not have the word,

00:04:24.036 --> 00:04:31.625
when he’s just an animal,
he’s just there, he doesn’t think.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.152
That’s why they are very spontaneous and we are not.

00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:44.664
Animals are extremely spontaneous. 
That cause they do not think the way we think.

00:04:44.745 --> 00:04:50.434
And this has created the greatest problem for human beings:
how to get beyond thoughts.

00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:54.511
It’s a little complicated thing because

00:04:54.592 --> 00:04:59.400
perhaps I can see that very clearly,
as you cannot see the light.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:09.158
And then the light forms the language,
and then language, according to us, becomes our thoughts.

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:12.673
But these thoughts are really conditionings on us

00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:15.212
and they are not inspired things.

00:05:15.293 --> 00:05:21.380
They are not coming from inside
and that’s why we are not spontaneous.

00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:27.623
For example if I am sitting here,
now I cannot keep quiet as a human being.

00:05:27.704 --> 00:05:32.599
I’ll be thinking about something.
I’ll be thinking, “What am I going to say?”

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.619
Then “Should I say this or not?”
“What if I say this, will that be alright or not?”

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.926
“Will that go to their heads or not?”
All sorts of thoughts will be coming into My head.

00:05:41.085 --> 00:05:46.065
Then from one side I will be questioning myself.
From the other side the answers will be coming,

00:05:46.185 --> 00:05:48.875
“Alright you say this and if you say like this

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:52.505
they may appreciate you Go this way that way they will understand.”

00:05:52.675 --> 00:06:00.085
Like that you see. So the sorting out goes on in our 
brain through our experiences of this lifetime of ours.

00:06:01.673 --> 00:06:05.230
Whatever have been our experiences in this lifetime

00:06:05.311 --> 00:06:09.061
in dealing with people in getting experiences from others:

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.384
all these are conditioned into our brain

00:06:11.544 --> 00:06:14.875
and the whole thing becomes a thought process,

00:06:14.956 --> 00:06:22.196
which comes to us through this interaction of thought

00:06:22.277 --> 00:06:25.590
and action, action and thought, which just starts waves

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.089
– which action to take, what thought to be put in,

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.236
how to solve it and we think we are analysing ourselves.

00:06:32.317 --> 00:06:35.867
It’s a very superficial thing.

00:06:35.948 --> 00:06:41.503
Actually you do not analyse anything whatsoever, you do not.

00:06:41.584 --> 00:06:45.443
As I told you the other day you do not do anything.

00:06:45.524 --> 00:06:49.293
So your thinking is nothing but a bubbling going on.

00:06:49.374 --> 00:06:54.471
Because when, like a sea even, which is, so deep down, so quiet

00:06:54.552 --> 00:06:58.261
– when it touches the shore it has a action and reaction.

00:06:58.342 --> 00:07:01.812
In the same way when you are seeing at something,

00:07:01.893 --> 00:07:04.330
because your attention is outside,

00:07:04.411 --> 00:07:07.266
immediately a thought wave is created out of that,

00:07:07.347 --> 00:07:10.867
which goes back and gives you all the images about it,

00:07:10.948 --> 00:07:13.288
whatever you know about that particular thing

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:17.361
and it comes back to you as thought process.

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:21.382
It’s going on all the time,

00:07:22.547 --> 00:07:29.013
and it can be so maddening that we cannot 
stop our thoughts: it just goes on like mad.

00:07:29.094 --> 00:07:32.030
You don’t know, you can’t sleep because thoughts are coming.

00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:37.172
Sometimes they could be horrifying,
sometimes they are gratifying, sometimes romantic,

00:07:37.253 --> 00:07:41.650
sometimes absolutely negative, sometimes very positive.

00:07:41.731 --> 00:07:46.312
Sometimes you feel “I must do this,”
sometimes you feel “I shouldn’t do this”.

00:07:46.393 --> 00:07:49.867
But when you [are] actually doing – you do not think.
