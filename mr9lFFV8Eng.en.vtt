00:08.360 --> 00:14.480
Vibrations, as I said, that is the manifestation of the Spirit.

00:14.560 --> 00:18.320
But it is a very vague way of expressing it.

00:18.440 --> 00:23.280
Now see, if there’s a nice flame before me,

00:23.360 --> 00:26.000
this candle has been enlightened.

00:26.080 --> 00:30.999
Now what does it do? It gives you light.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.480
Alright, but how does it give you light?

00:36.640 --> 00:40.480
By throwing light towards you, by emitting light.

00:40.999 --> 00:47.040
It is the emitting, of pulsation from the Self.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.560
This light, this is light.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.999
Actually there is sound, there is light;

00:54.040 --> 00:57.200
very high frequency sound – very high frequency.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.999
Actually many types of sounds are mixed in.

00:59.999 --> 01:03.160
There’s is magnetism in this, in these vibrations.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.999
It has all the five elements

01:05.999 --> 01:11.320
-the subtle of all the five elements inside these vibrations only.

01:11.999 --> 01:14.600
They are talking, they are telling you,

01:14.680 --> 01:17.320
they are guiding you, they are helping you.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.680
It’s because the Spirit is working through them.

01:20.760 --> 01:25.080
Like this light that you take in your hand: you go in the darkness,

01:25.999 --> 01:28.999
and you see that there is an impediment in between

01:29.000 --> 01:34.480
[and] you have to cross it. So you get the idea with this light.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.360
The light is doing that for you.

01:39.240 --> 01:43.680
So, when the Spirit pulsates in your conscious mind,

01:43.760 --> 01:49.760
in your conscious mind, then it is a Self-realised personality.

01:50.600 --> 01:53.999
But in the unconscious it is there, all the time working.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.560
Actually the Spirit Itself comes out.

01:56.680 --> 02:02.600
It’s as big as your thumb is.

02:03.960 --> 02:07.720
But you can contain your thumb in your heart.

02:08.560 --> 02:16.360
That is the reflection of the God Almighty within us,

02:16.640 --> 02:25.280
because heart receives that image within itself,

02:25.720 --> 02:35.200
it is pulsating and is emitting the Knowledge

02:36.120 --> 02:39.240
through our unconscious.

02:42.040 --> 02:46.360
Spirit is an unconscious being till we are realised.

02:46.440 --> 02:51.999
Once we are realised it becomes conscious,

02:53.040 --> 02:56.960
it starts emitting itself and pulsating.

02:56.999 --> 03:01.400
And what is Spirit? Is God Almighty Himself,

03:01.480 --> 03:05.080
in a miniature form, which is reflected within us.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.680
The more we clean our heart,

03:07.760 --> 03:10.800
which represents all the seven chakras within us.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.240
There are seven auras around our heart.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.680
All the seven chakras which are here in the Sahastrara,

03:17.800 --> 03:22.960
the seats are there, and all the seven chakras that are there, within us,

03:22.999 --> 03:28.320
have seven auras around our heart and when all of them are clear-cut,

03:28.400 --> 03:34.720
absolutely clear, pure, integrated

03:34.999 --> 03:42.120
then the complete emission starts, of those vibrations.

03:45.999 --> 03:50.720
They are much more than I can explain because, say,

03:50.800 --> 03:54.720
the other day, a lady was writing a letter to me

03:55.360 --> 03:59.960
and she was saying that, “Mother I am so sorry.

03:59.999 --> 04:02.960
I have my accommodation problem is at the climax…”

04:02.999 --> 04:05.680
and, very frustrating letter you see, to begin with

04:05.760 --> 04:08.040
and absolutely as if she was going to be doomed,

04:08.120 --> 04:11.480
the way she was writing it! And, I mean, such a trivial thing like that,

04:11.600 --> 04:14.999
but she was very concerned because she didn’t know where to go.

04:14.999 --> 04:17.160
And first half of the letter was like that.

04:17.280 --> 04:20.600
Second half was this that, “Mother, just now I have received a letter

04:20.720 --> 04:24.560
from the authorities that they have allotted me a very beautiful place”

04:24.680 --> 04:28.080
in such and such place!! (laughing)

04:28.200 --> 04:30.400
Now, I would say this is all vibrations

04:30.480 --> 04:33.240
because it is All-pervading now, and you become one

04:33.360 --> 04:35.999
with the All-pervading Power so how it helps!

04:36.040 --> 04:39.560
Because when she was writing to me, the vibrations were feeling it,

04:39.640 --> 04:41.480
what she was writing from the paper,

04:41.560 --> 04:43.999
so they communicated to the All-pervading Power.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.560
And as the Angels, or you can say the Deities, also,

04:47.640 --> 04:49.520
can understand and they must have thought,

04:49.600 --> 04:51.720
“Why bother Mother with all this nonsense,

04:51.800 --> 04:55.440
better give her the letter as soon as possible, finish it off!”

04:55.560 --> 04:57.240
So in the second letter she says,

04:57.320 --> 05:00.680
“I’m such a fool to write this but I must write to you to give you

05:00.760 --> 05:05.400
the night and the day of my life.” So she wrote to me.

05:05.520 --> 05:10.320
So, it can work out that way, that quick.

05:10.999 --> 05:16.880
So the vibrations are actually the things which are the doers

05:16.960 --> 05:18.760
and the enjoyers.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.999
They are the one, who enjoy, also,

05:21.000 --> 05:24.120
if they find a very good Self-realised soul coming.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.080
Then you just feel the Self-realised soul and you say,

05:27.160 --> 05:30.640
“Oh very good. Come along, come along. Just have it”

05:30.760 --> 05:37.160
Everybody starts enjoying that joy that’s coming from that person.

05:37.240 --> 05:44.760
And that is what it is, that you start enjoying that beauty

05:44.840 --> 05:46.999
in that person through the vibrations.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.440
It’s a multi-dimensional thing – though it looks so simple,

05:51.520 --> 05:53.800
that you are feeling in the hand, that’s all.

05:53.880 --> 05:58.200
So it is a multi-dimensional thing just like the God Almighty.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.800
And, for your information, it is only He does everything.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.040
So only the vibrations work out everything.

06:04.160 --> 06:07.400
We really do not do anything whatsoever –

06:07.480 --> 06:10.999
[if we think we do] we are living in a fool’s paradise!

06:14.920 --> 06:18.080
For example, a tree dies and you chain it over

06:18.200 --> 06:21.200
and make a nice seat for me to sit down – so what?

06:21.280 --> 06:23.720
Tree is dead and you make a seat and you say,

06:23.800 --> 06:28.560
“Oh, we have built this, we have done that!” Nothing! What do you do?

06:30.720 --> 06:35.960
Can you sprout even a small, little seed? You cannot.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.999
But these vibrations only,

06:42.080 --> 06:45.200
which connect you with the All-pervading Power,

06:45.320 --> 06:47.320
which are part of the All-pervading power,

06:47.440 --> 06:53.000
these pervading Almighty’s eyes, you can say

06:53.120 --> 06:56.999
– they are the ones who look after each and every minute thing

06:56.999 --> 07:02.560
in this whole world. Can you think of such a multi-dimensional thing?

07:04.600 --> 07:07.120
Now you have seen how vibrations work on people,

07:07.240 --> 07:10.160
how they dissolve even the thick bones

07:10.280 --> 07:12.600
and how they bring out the Kundalini here

07:12.720 --> 07:16.800
and how you see the softness on your head.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.640
Just you cannot explain how, because they only do everything.

07:21.760 --> 07:26.040
They have the universal communication centres

07:26.120 --> 07:29.840
and they have universal broadcasting stations,

07:29.960 --> 07:35.440
they have universal TV centres there. Everything is there.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.520
In short, you just copy them a little bit and you think

07:40.600 --> 07:45.480
you are doing something but you really don’t do anything whatsoever.

07:47.999 --> 07:50.360
That’s why it is said that Brahma

07:50.480 --> 07:53.800
– this is the expression of Brahma, these vibrations are the Brahma –

07:53.880 --> 07:59.440
is the only Truth, the rest is all avidya, is all a maya,

07:59.520 --> 08:04.120
is just an illusion. We live in illusions you see.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.999
He is the Enjoyer, He is the Doer,

08:08.999 --> 08:11.999
you are just in between to see Him.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.640
It would be like this mic (microphone) thinking

08:14.720 --> 08:19.360
that he’s giving the lecture of Sahaja Yoga – it’s really like that!!

08:26.360 --> 08:36.800
So to explain what is vibrations may not be so simple

08:36.880 --> 08:43.000
in all its details. But the overall idea I have given to you. Is it alright?
