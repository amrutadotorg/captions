1
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:29,318
I’m just trying to remember if I had a more
fantastic birthday than this!

2
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:44,278
Where words do not come, there the joy
cannot be expressed.

3
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:52,390
When it becomes so deep, that there is no movement.

4
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,113
This is a great country.

5
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,013
Australia has been created

6
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:12,458
for a special purpose in Sahaja Yoga.

7
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:28,385
This is the Mooladhara chakra, where resides Shri Ganesha, of this world.

8
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:42,081
How important it is to keep this centre awakened within us.

9
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:47,895
The information about my coming

10
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:56,684
can only be broadcasted from this centre.

11
00:05:56,885 --> 00:06:01,403
Then the world Kundalini is going to rise.

12
00:06:01,604 --> 00:06:04,885
When you are putting your hands towards me,

13
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:13,191
then the divine love passes through
your fingers,

14
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:20,542
goes down through your Ida and Pingala

15
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:28,455
and informs Shri Ganesha about my presence

16
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:32,877
and then the Kundalini rises.

17
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:52,695
So today, we should say, is a great day
in the history of divine work,

18
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:58,950
where I came to Australia.

19
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:06,916
They asked me, “Was there any incarnation
in Australia?"

20
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:13,223
"Did God visit Australia in human form?"

21
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:20,873
I said, “It’s not easy to reach Shri Ganesh!”

22
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:26,569
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh could not reach Shri Ganesh.

23
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:33,351
And you know that he is placed like a lotus

24
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:56,489
where all kinds of people who are insulted,
tortured, ignored, are saved.

25
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:07,362
Here he really decides whom to save
from hell, and whom not to save.

26
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:11,586
God’s decisions are very different,
they are absolute.

27
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:16,752
Human decisions are extremely cruel
and blind.

28
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:24,669
And today you find so many saints in this
Mooladhara.

29
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:30,666
This is the work of Shri Ganesh.

30
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:35,613
He has called you on this great chakra

31
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:42,476
where Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha
also cannot enter in it

32
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:48,903
that you should stay here and grow
into beautiful saints

33
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:53,578
of very great magnitude in spirituality.

34
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:59,464
Such glory is to him, is such a fortunate thing,

35
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,828
and such a blessing,

36
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:08,717
that even Indians could be jealous of you.

37
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:26,906
One has to see how Shri Ganesha acts within us.

38
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:32,029
It’s very important to recognise him,

37.1

39
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:36,429
to understand him and to imbibe,

40
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:43,118
otherwise, you will be wasting all His
energies staying in this place,

41
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:49,379
living in this place, so close to him.

42
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:56,841
And though he is the giver of wisdom,

43
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:03,696
I wonder how many people understand
the word ‘wisdom’.

44
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:09,615
Wisdom is the centre of gravity within us

45
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:15,954
which gives us the fulcrum on which
we rotate,

46
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:19,363
by which we realise that we are inclined

47
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:23,470
to the left or to the right.

48
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:35,222
This fulcrum we have to be aware of,

49
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:40,054
because otherwise we will not know
how far we have gone.

50
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:47,133
Not only [that], but we should know that it is so much

51
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:55,261
the centre of gravity and our fulcrum - so close.

52
00:10:55,462 --> 00:11:01,938
Because if your centre of gravity and
fulcrum are separated

50.1

53
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,776
there’s no integration.

54
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,776
You can be ruined completely.

55
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:18,826
So wisdom means this integration between
your understanding

56
00:11:19,337 --> 00:11:29,918
and the understanding of Shri Ganesha, <i>within you.</i>

57
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:39,485
For example, we go to extremes, extremes of behaviour.

58
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,034
I would give you a very simple example:

55.1

59
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:46,034
I was going to Hong Kong

60
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:52,369
and the lady who organised it,
she telephoned to me again and again

61
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:58,643
and she told me that, “A big batch of people are coming to receive you

62
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:06,699
and you are going to be on the television
from the moment you land..

63
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,190
and this is going to happen and that is going to happen”.

64
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:11,457
Every day spending so much money.

65
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:14,457
Describing to me the scene

66
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:19,999
that I’ll be a “hot news” and all sorts of things, you see,

61.1

67
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:22,999
encourage lots of people to come and see you

68
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:26,673
And she was on and on and on.

69
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:30,673
And also, she told Dr Warren

70
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:36,127
except for giving the newspaper [advert] she didn’t
have to pay for it.

71
00:12:39,621 --> 00:12:42,797
It was going too far.

72
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:50,917
At that juncture, just it was not necessary

73
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:56,467
to go to <i>such</i> a limit and plan it out that there will be people coming

74
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:59,485
inside the aeroplane to receive me

68.1

75
00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:01,020
makes no difference to me!

76
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:05,646
And there would be a car waiting near
the aeroplane just to receive me.

77
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:13,552
I don’t know! I don’t know who was waiting
where, at every point!

78
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,944
And when we reached there, it was six
hours late

79
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:22,409
and I told Warren, “It’s all going to be a fizzled out, take it easy!”

80
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:30,180
And the plane just deposited us in Bangkok!

73.1

81
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:34,580
There was no way – six hours.

82
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,900
And we had to take another plane

83
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:43,131
in which nobody came in

84
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:45,131
no car

85
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:46,131
nothing.

86
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:50,037
We went down looking for her, couldn’t see
her.

87
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:55,079
Telephoned to the hotel, they said, “No arrangements thrown.”

88
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,070
Warren thought, “Mother has gone to another extreme now!”

89
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:09,190
Quite worried that there’s no one to receive us at the airport in Hong Kong.

90
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:11,789
It’s all a joke

91
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,516
Going to extremes has to be corrected in you as well.

92
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:21,395
because if you get successful with your this kind of planning,

93
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:24,312
then you’ll go on doing this kind of artificial planning

94
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:27,572
and not the planning of the divine.

95
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:30,461
The divine has its own plans

96
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:33,461
and we have to feel the plans of the divine.

97
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:38,316
It works it out. You are just an instrument to work it out.

98
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:46,210
So if you try to do something of your own,
something too much,

99
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:52,647
then who is going to suggest the balance - is Shri Ganesh

100
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:57,118
And that balance, once it’s established in you

101
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,622
you know how you should balance yourself.

90.1

102
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:03,622
Now, there is no alternative

103
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:07,651
for Sahaj Yog, no alternative.

91.1

104
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,651
One must know.

105
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:13,402
Everything that is living has no alternatives.

106
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:22,111
For example, if a mango tree says that,
“I will create a pomegranate,” it cannot!

107
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,839
There’s no alternatives. Whatever is there, it has to see and enjoy;

108
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,878
but not to force its way on it.

109
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,516
This is one of the things we have to understand

110
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:38,572
to establish our wisdom.

111
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:49,640
Because of our concept, our idea, our anything,

112
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:58,093
even about God for example, about our achievements itself,

113
00:15:58,294 --> 00:16:03,180
can be absolutely wrong if you have no wisdom.

114
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:12,199
But in nature, if you see, those who grow

115
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,596
are never bothered about what shape
they are going to take, do they?

116
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:23,203
Does a tree measure itself up to know how
many dimensions it is going to grow?

117
00:16:23,404 --> 00:16:27,225
It grows as much as it can

104.1

118
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,825
slowly, steadily

119
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:35,129
in coordination with nature itself.

120
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:45,781
Like that, the wisdom is the one that understands.

121
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:50,964
 It is an establishment, is a state of mind.

122
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:57,362
We can say it’s the state of <i>being</i>, when you become wisdom.

123
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:06,812
Such a wisdom outside, also expresses so beautifully.

124
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:13,478
Such a wisdom gives you a gentleman and a gentlelady

125
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:23,923
only in a personality which is settled down.

126
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:26,707
If you are frustrated

112.1

127
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,707
and if there’s a problem

128
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:32,400
if you are unhappy, if you are suppressed

129
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:41,969
any <i>extremes</i> will not allow this flower of wisdom to grow.

130
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,955
So even in frustration you have to look back,

131
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:47,736
you have to stand back and see for yourself,

132
00:17:47,937 --> 00:17:49,890
“Why am I to be so frustrated?”

133
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:55,705
Count your blessings one by one.

118.1

134
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:57,705
Count your blessings one by one.

135
00:17:57,906 --> 00:18:04,119
I’ll say again, <i>count your blessings one by one.</i>

136
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,201
Once you start counting your blessings,

137
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:12,705
you will find in such a short time, where are you.

138
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,316
Now the extreme projections of the mind can take you to:

139
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:23,716
“I’m not going to face!” and you would like to do it.

140
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:37,707
But in <i>wise</i> projection, you can see this, that you are what you have to be.

141
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,222
You are saints.

142
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:45,696
You were born to be saints in this great country.

143
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:49,273
You are specially blessed people in the heavens,

144
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:58,875
and are sent on this Earth to do this Maha Yoga, to spread it.

145
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:01,558
You have achieved that state.

146
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,909
And if you are saints, you should not be bothered as to a few things like,

147
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,985
“Oh! I haven’t got a suitcase” or something
sort of a thing like that

148
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:15,107
which you have never been very much bothered before.

149
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:17,485
Can you see that?

133.1

150
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:20,855
Any kind of extreme behaviour

151
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:25,340
For example, for materialism you people are not so bad

152
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:32,290
in the sense that you understand the value
of aesthetics.

153
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:37,767
But in possessiveness let us take the wise
path, the wisdom

154
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,562
logical, it has to be logical

137.1

155
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:48,562
What do we possess in this world?

156
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:53,286
Just think of <i>one</i> thing that we can possess!

157
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:57,197
Except for your own Spirit, you don’t possess anything.

158
00:19:57,398 --> 00:20:02,755
Except for your evolutionary development, you don’t possess anything.

159
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:05,925
For example, now you are a saint you’ll be born a saint always

160
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:09,655
this is what you possess

142.1

161
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:10,655
The rest you don’t possess

162
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,743
It’s logical, logical.

163
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:16,743
You need not to be realised to understand what I am saying.

164
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,604
So why should we worry about our possessions?

165
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:29,710
When you leave this worry, this is another wisdom,

166
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:31,761
this is the higher wisdom

167
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:35,361
which you develop within yourself.

168
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:40,345
And if we leave our possessions, our material problems are solved.

169
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:42,985
‘Leave’ doesn’t mean you throw them in the sea,

170
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:46,485
but the attachment to it dissolves

149.1

171
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:48,982
It is solved.

149.2

172
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:51,382
Let me give you an example

173
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,485
Like Kay lost her travellers’ cheques


150.1

174
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,184
she did not know, she was not knowing

175
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:00,485
Suddenly one man bumped into her.

151.1

176
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:02,662
I was with her.

177
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:06,074
He said, “Imagine, I never knew I was going to meet you!”

178
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:10,004
He said, “I went to a particular cashier or somebody"

179
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:14,388
And he said “Do you know this lady? I’ve got her travellers cheques with me.”

180
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:18,466
"And here, suddenly, I bump into you!”

181
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:21,795
How the news has been organised, in the nature you see,

182
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:28,198
when the flowers bloom, how these bees come all the way.

183
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:35,708
How the birds fly all the way from Siberia to Australia?

184
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:39,606
What wisdom, is that magnetism in them

159.1

185
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:42,606
the magnetism that is in the Mother Earth

186
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:51,174
which tells them, “This is the way you have to go.”

187
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:55,737
So we have to see to this magnetism within us:

188
00:21:55,938 --> 00:22:02,788
What makes us magnetic

189
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:06,827
is not what we could have, what unnatural
things we have

190
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:09,274
but what naturally we have achieved within

191
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:12,471
and we are not afraid to express it

192
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:17,771
In fear you are never aggressive

193
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:28,438
but even in fearlessness you are never aggressive

194
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:35,118
In fear you might say that you are not afraid

195
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:39,121
but you could be aggressive

196
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,768
When people look very frightened, if you push them

197
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:51,556
to the extreme of fright, they can come back

198
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:54,171
But if you are fearless, you are innocent

172.1

199
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:58,171
you are just standing and watching

200
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:07,579
Fearlessness never means aggression

201
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:13,462
So the confusion of our own concepts

202
00:23:13,663 --> 00:23:16,485
can only be cleared out

203
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:19,380
if there is light within us.

204
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:25,100
For us, if somebody is aggressing us, then we think

205
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:28,830
[that] if we do not aggress the other
person, we are frightened

206
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:32,082
then we are useless,

178.1

207
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:37,482
we are weak, we are weak people

208
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,485
so we should fight back.

179.1

209
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:44,183
Even when you are fighting back, you are weak people.

210
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:50,310
If it was not so, what is there to fight
back?

211
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:55,290
In fearlessness you become the witness.

212
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:57,587
You see the joke

213
00:23:57,601 --> 00:24:01,587
joke behind all this extreme behaviour of another person.

214
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:05,905
And also you know the technique, kaushalam.

215
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:08,921
Yoga also means kaushalam, it means technique

184.1

216
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:10,921
how to manage the show

217
00:24:11,122 --> 00:24:17,686
by which his action doesn’t trouble you

185.1

218
00:24:18,485 --> 00:24:20,686
if you want to.

219
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:25,509
If you don’t want, you can even take
the action upon yourself, to prove it

220
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,278
that, “Whatever you are doing is a little
silly and stupid.”

221
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:34,280
Like Christ getting Himself crucified.

222
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:39,226
It was a wise decision to do

223
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,433
because if you have to prove that life is eternal

224
00:24:44,634 --> 00:24:48,077
the best thing is to die and show.

225
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:52,843
And to be [done] publicly, so that nobody
should say that he was not dead.

226
00:24:53,044 --> 00:24:56,703
Still there are many people who are saying he was not dead.

227
00:24:56,904 --> 00:25:00,359
Still there are people who are talking this: “He was not dead.

228
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,608
He was alive. So he got out of the place.”

229
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:09,142
Because they don’t know how to explain!

230
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:15,784
So he had to die publicly

231
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:22,770
and then his resurrection was to be seen
by many people.

232
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:31,446
This drama had to be performed

233
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:39,201
for you to have the wisdom to know that life is eternal.

234
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,112
It doesn’t mean that he was weak, by any chance.

235
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:55,127
So the idea of our aggression, or our suppression

236
00:25:55,185 --> 00:26:02,786
Both come from either fear

203.1

237
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:11,786
or some sort of a satanic pleasure

203.2

238
00:26:12,185 --> 00:26:15,786
to oppress others

239
00:26:16,171 --> 00:26:21,462
So wisdom lies in seeing yourself also

240
00:26:21,987 --> 00:26:24,760
See how wisdom is so important!

241
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:30,233
Throughout if you find, in every chakra resides pranava

242
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:33,181
is the life of every chakra.

243
00:26:33,382 --> 00:26:39,090
Because it is the <i>wisdom</i> that tells you whether you are in the chakra or not.

244
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,177
So how wisdom is [so] important


209.1

245
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:44,785
that you even become a sakshi if you have wisdom

246
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:45,639
otherwise you cannot

247
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,084
You become a witness <i>only</i> when you have that focal point

211.1

248
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,485
adjusted to your centre of gravity

249
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:03,035
That is wisdom!

250
00:27:04,046 --> 00:27:06,912
When people tell me about somebody who has harmed them

251
00:27:07,113 --> 00:27:11,946
they paint such a dark picture of the whole thing

252
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:18,943
as if it was another war that was fought.

253
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:22,772
Then you go and listen to another side,

254
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:28,370
they paint another horrible picture
of this side.

255
00:27:28,802 --> 00:27:34,052
Between these two pictures you stand.

256
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:39,756
You find the one is reflecting the other,
the other is reflecting the other.

257
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:49,837
There is no end to it, it’s eternally going
on from this to that, to that to this.

258
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:56,004
How do you end it up?

259
00:27:56,771 --> 00:28:05,247
Only by your wisdom, by understanding it’s an illusion.

260
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:09,657
The main thing is the mirror on which it is reflected,

261
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:16,195
It’s just an illusion that is appearing, and we are worried about it.

262
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:20,733
The whole illusion will drop out as soon as you just see the mirror

263
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:24,947
and don’t worry about the reflections.

264
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:32,862
They’ll come and go: it is for you just to witness it, that’s all.

265
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:37,686
It’s not..the mirror is a mirror, which is a solid thing,

266
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:42,009
and all the reflections are illusions.

267
00:28:44,328 --> 00:28:53,213
That’s how we miss all the sweetness of our own being.

268
00:28:57,865 --> 00:29:04,083
Wisdom lies in understanding that you are the Spirit.

269
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,285
You are not all these illusions. You are the Spirit.


232.1

270
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,977
You are the Spirit.

271
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,086
The attention was, as animals, was on food only, you can say.

272
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:19,237
You were aware of food, nothing else but food only.

273
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:22,041
This grows higher and higher in awareness,

274
00:29:22,242 --> 00:29:25,485
then he came up to a point where he started thinking that

275
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,485
he is the prime minister

237.1

276
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,899
or he is an actor or an actress

277
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,722
and this and that and so-called things they have achieved.

278
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:40,530
Or maybe they start thinking - oh, they are atheists

279
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:42,679
agnostics and all sorts of things, you see.

240.1

280
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:45,679
Communists!

240.2

281
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:51,679
And specialists!

282
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:00,485
It’s a drama going on!

241.1

283
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:03,344
They are wearing wigs after wigs.

284
00:30:03,545 --> 00:30:06,452
If they like this wig they’ll wear this, otherwise throw away!

285
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:09,511
This has killed the romance <i>completely!</i>

286
00:30:09,712 --> 00:30:14,167
You start loving the wigs of a person!

287
00:30:16,802 --> 00:30:20,561
And wigs can be bought!

245.1

288
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:24,561
They could be exchanged.

289
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:30,390
If you go into the market, you can get about ten types of wigs.

290
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:36,540
Supposing you say, “Oh, I like this colour for the hair,”

291
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:41,356
so the lady will go and wear that and come out

292
00:30:41,557 --> 00:30:45,331
and then you’ll like her for the wig that she has got

293
00:30:45,532 --> 00:30:50,122
Then another may wear the same

294
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:58,206
Or this same lady, who looks nice with one wig,

295
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:00,788
could bore you completely!

296
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:09,522
Because there’s no living dynamism, that charisma

297
00:31:09,723 --> 00:31:13,693
Every moment is so beautiful

254.1

298
00:31:13,723 --> 00:31:15,733
It breaks into new waves

299
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:19,660
of such beautiful colours and beautiful music.

300
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:25,904
That’s all lost with these bought images.

301
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:31,624
Every minute the image changes, with a living personality,

302
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:33,398
into tremendous beauty.

258.1

303
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,398
But the first point is the wisdom

304
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,325
to know that our images cannot be purchased

305
00:31:38,526 --> 00:31:41,485
or bought or created or made.

260.1

306
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:45,160
<i>They evolve!</i>

307
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:49,768
So we have to only see to our evolving force..

308
00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:52,797
are we nearer it or are we out of it?

309
00:31:53,006 --> 00:31:57,485
Are we moving with our evolving force

310
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,516
Of getting ourselves crucified

264.1

311
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:09,716
with all these artificial misidentifications that says that,

312
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:11,785
You are this, you are that.

265.1

313
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:14,335
You are nothing but a seeker.

314
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:17,020
It’s a category, I have told many-a-times

266.1

315
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:19,020
that you are a seeker and you have to seek

316
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:22,998
Now, what do you seek? Is your Spirit.

317
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:26,034
And once you have found it, establish yourself on that.

268.1

318
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:27,334
That’s what you are!

319
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:33,806
And to know that you are that Spirit itself is so satisfying

320
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:39,826
is itself emitting wisdom in you

270.1

321
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:42,485
Which is so joy giving

322
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,485
and is nothing but love

271.1

323
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:46,426
It’s love, I tell you!

324
00:32:46,627 --> 00:32:48,992
I mean, I cannot go beyond this.

325
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:56,625
There’s no word in human language to say
what is love.

326
00:32:56,826 --> 00:33:00,722
To me it is nothing but silence.

274.1

327
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:04,222
Everything stops at that point.

328
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:09,204
This feeling within yourself, where the wisdom is becoming love,

329
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,608
and love becomes wisdom.

276.1

330
00:33:11,705 --> 00:33:16,608
that’s the real integration of life.

331
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:19,447
Open your hearts!

277.1

332
00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:25,485
Allow Shri Ganesha to be settled in that

333
00:33:25,648 --> 00:33:28,731
That innocence which enhances everything.

334
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:30,776
Look at the little ones.

279.1

335
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:32,776
How they came forward to give me flowers.

336
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:38,225
Every step, every movement was so joyous

337
00:33:38,426 --> 00:33:42,928
was creating such a beautiful, delicate ripple in my heart.

338
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:47,577
And it’s written as history for me,

339
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:54,644
to see these little, little sweet, innocent Ganeshas coming forward

340
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,415
And the wisdom becomes so powerful

341
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:04,133
that you know the source of love as Ganesha in you.

342
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,019
For him, he did not know anybody else but one

286.1

343
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:11,319
That which is the source of love.

344
00:34:12,605 --> 00:34:18,317
Never questioned, never argued. No alternatives!

345
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:25,454
No new ideas came to his mind.

288.1

346
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:28,454
It's just taking in.

347
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:35,265
Working it out within yourself and the whole thing just works out.

348
00:34:35,466 --> 00:34:40,265
The more you enter into it, you will
understand that you have really entered

349
00:34:40,466 --> 00:34:43,692
into the Kingdom of God where he looks after everyone.

350
00:34:43,785 --> 00:34:45,485
You want a house? All right, have it!

351
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,672
What do you want? You want that? Alright!

352
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,672
You have a problem? Have it.

353
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:54,965
It’s all God’s, the own thing. Who owns it but God?

354
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:59,463
He is the One who owns everything and He’s
the One who enjoys everything.

355
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,164
And he wants you to enjoy everything.

356
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:10,287
Only through the power of your wisdom that you can achieve it

357
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:18,841
Today, You all have to show a part of that achievement in your wisdom

358
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:24,918
in which there is no artificiality. It’s so natural.

359
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:31,145
But natural doesn’t mean baser. Some
people think to be angry is also natural.

360
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:35,203
But you are a human being and
a Sahaja Yogi.

361
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:38,263
Whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

362
00:35:38,464 --> 00:35:43,545
is not the same as whatever is natural
to a buffalo.

363
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:49,090
We have nothing to learn from them,
they have to learn from us.

364
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:53,349
So whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

365
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:57,401
has to be learnt in the school of wisdom.

366
00:35:57,602 --> 00:36:01,046
Not by any rules or anything

367
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,846
that I say, “You don’t do this,” and, “You do this!”

368
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:09,414
“You are not to do like that.” “You are not
to do this way!”

369
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:20,840
Even in the hand if you see: this portion is Australia.

370
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:27,317
Now just see: this portion is the source for all the fingers

371
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,868
is the connecting point, this is your point

312.1

372
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:35,268
But it doesn’t say anything!

373
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:38,973
For example, this thumb means something,

374
00:36:39,174 --> 00:36:40,485
this finger means something

314.1

375
00:36:40,486 --> 00:36:41,622
this means something

376
00:36:41,823 --> 00:36:46,743
but this doesn’t say anything, doesn’t do anything.

377
00:36:46,944 --> 00:36:49,940
But without this nothing exists.

378
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:55,458
If it is cut out here, you are paralysed,
all the movements are finished, you see.

379
00:36:55,659 --> 00:37:05,001
This is the connecting link with the divine
and the guiding link.

380
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:07,042
This only tells which finger to move

319.1

381
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:10,042
where to take, how to contract which muscle.

382
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:16,225
All of this is controlled in this portion.

383
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:25,441
The day will come when the information
will reach the whole world

384
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:30,524
through the awakening of Ganesha in my children

322.1

385
00:37:30,642 --> 00:37:33,524
the Sahaja Yogis in Australia.

386
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:39,990
And the whole world is going to get the blessings coming into it

387
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:43,669
Of course, you know that Kundalini is in India

388
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:48,669
and only then the Kundalini can rise.

389
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:57,183
But one thing you have to remember

390
00:37:57,627 --> 00:38:04,480
is that you are really placed at a very pivotal point here

391
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:09,617
and that the responsibility is too much on you.

392
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:17,410
And the responsibility is to keep the whole atmosphere pure

393
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:21,605
and send forth all the fragrance of the lotus.

394
00:38:21,806 --> 00:38:28,271
Though maybe you will feel you are surrounded by all the mud and everything,

395
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:34,577
but still you have to be very strong lotuses.

396
00:38:34,778 --> 00:38:40,082
For the whole world you have to come up

397
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:45,535
and send forth that beautiful fragrance

398
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:52,352
of announcement that the Blossom Time has come.

399
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,525
I was asking for the river’s name

335.1

400
00:38:56,696 --> 00:38:58,525
what’s the name of the river

401
00:38:58,726 --> 00:39:02,142
I wonder if you thought about it

336.1

402
00:39:02,226 --> 00:39:05,142
See, the river’s name is ‘Parramatta’

403
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:10,495
‘Para’ in Greek means ‘above, beyond’ should be Para

404
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:14,485
And ‘Mata’ means ‘the mother’

338.1

405
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:19,464
Your river’s name itself is Parramatta.

406
00:39:19,665 --> 00:39:26,147
It’s a Greek word and how the Greeks
have known this word ‘Parramatta’?

407
00:39:26,348 --> 00:39:30,369
This river had to be here, the Adi Shakti itself only, had to be here

408
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:34,582
to bless the Ganesha all the time which has to do the work.

409
00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:39,758
He’s the one who sorts out

342.1

410
00:39:39,783 --> 00:39:42,158
The Lambodara!

411
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:50,160
The one you will see in the Sistine Chapel, very well pointed out.

412
00:39:50,361 --> 00:39:52,066
It’s a huge big stomach.

344.1

413
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:54,485
It’s really an Australian character, personality,

414
00:39:56,267 --> 00:40:03,524
standing there, sorting out people,
throwing left to the right.

415
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:07,679
It’s so beautiful, I wish you could get
that picture some time.

416
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,633
And you will be surprised – it’s an
Australian. you can see it perfectly -

417
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:15,932
it’s Australian character.

418
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:22,421
That is Christ, absolutely an Australian
body, standing up.

419
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:26,815
I don’t know how Michelangelo could see that so clearly

420
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:32,066
that he had to be Australian like that.

421
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:43,838
It has been so beautiful to come down here.

422
00:40:43,886 --> 00:40:45,838
So beautiful.

423
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:55,905
It’s blissful for you maybe, but for me it’s nothing but complete joy.

424
00:40:56,095 --> 00:41:00,905
complete joy.

425
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:10,192
I had told that I will not do anything
after three years time;

426
00:41:10,393 --> 00:41:11,766
I will just settle down

355.1

427
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:14,766
because the saintly person is not supposed

428
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:17,389
to move from places to places, they must settle down,

429
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:22,353
they must have their own round pillow that’s called as takiya,

430
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:24,312
and you are not to leave that.

431
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:30,312
But I am a Mother who is moving all over.

432
00:41:30,513 --> 00:41:36,424
And can you imagine, I’ve been all over
the places, but never to Australia before.

433
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:45,405
So to come here first thing was so great
that even,

434
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:50,496
today I have not been able to put
all that into words.

435
00:41:50,697 --> 00:41:54,196
May God bless you all.

436
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,098
You are really the Ganeshas, the amount
of food you have.
