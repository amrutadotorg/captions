1
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:29,681
I’m just trying to remember if I had a more
fantastic birthday than this!

2
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:44,641
Where words do not come, there the joy
cannot be expressed.

3
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:52,753
When it becomes so deep, that there is no movement.

4
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:59,476
This is a great country.

5
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:04,376
Australia has been created

6
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,821
for a special purpose in Sahaja Yoga.

7
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:28,748
This is the Mooladhara chakra, where resides Shri Ganesha, of this world.

8
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:42,444
How important it is to keep this centre awakened within us.

9
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,258
The information about my coming

10
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:57,047
can only be broadcasted from this centre.

11
00:05:57,248 --> 00:06:01,766
Then the world Kundalini is going to rise.

12
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:05,248
When you are putting your hands towards me,

13
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:13,554
then the divine love passes through
your fingers,

14
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:20,905
goes down through your Ida and Pingala

15
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:28,818
and informs Shri Ganesha about my presence

16
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:33,240
and then the Kundalini rises.

17
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:53,058
So today, we should say, is a great day
in the history of divine work,

18
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:59,313
where I came to Australia.

19
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:07,279
They asked me, “Was there any incarnation
in Australia?"

20
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,586
Did God visit Australia in human form?

21
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:21,236
I said, “It’s not easy to reach Shri Ganesh!”

22
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:26,932
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh could not reach Shri Ganesh.

23
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:33,714
And you know that he is placed like a lotus

24
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:56,852
where all kinds of people who are insulted,
tortured, ignored, are saved.

25
00:07:57,715 --> 00:08:07,725
Here he really decides whom to save
from hell, and whom not to save.

26
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:11,949
God’s decisions are very different,
they are absolute.

27
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,115
Human decisions are extremely cruel
and blind.

28
00:08:17,316 --> 00:08:25,032
And today you find so many saints in this
Mooladhara.

29
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:31,029
This is the work of Shri Ganesh.

30
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,976
He has called you on this great chakra

31
00:08:36,177 --> 00:08:42,839
where Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha
also cannot enter in it

32
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:49,266
that you should stay here and grow
into beautiful saints

33
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:53,941
of very great magnitude in spirituality.

34
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:59,827
Such glory is to him, is such a fortunate thing,

35
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:03,191
and such a blessing,

36
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:09,080
that even Indians could be jealous of you.

37
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:27,269
One has to see how Shri Ganesha acts within us.

38
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:32,392
It’s very important to recognise him,

39
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:36,792
to understand him and to imbibe,

40
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:43,481
otherwise, you will be wasting all His
energies staying in this place,

41
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:49,742
living in this place, so close to him.

42
00:09:53,484 --> 00:09:57,204
And though he is the giver of wisdom,

43
00:09:57,413 --> 00:10:04,059
I wonder how many people understand
the word ‘wisdom’.

44
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:09,978
Wisdom is the centre of gravity within us

45
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:16,317
which gives us the fulcrum on which
we rotate,

46
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:19,726
by which we realise that we are inclined

47
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:23,833
to the left or to the right.

48
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:35,585
This fulcrum we have to be aware of,

49
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:40,417
because otherwise we will not know
how far we have gone.

50
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:47,496
Not only [that], but we should know that it is so much

51
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:55,624
the centre of gravity and our fulcrum - so close.

52
00:10:55,825 --> 00:11:02,301
Because if your centre of gravity and
fulcrum are separated

53
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:05,139
there’s no integration.

54
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:09,139
You can be ruined completely.

55
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:19,189
So wisdom means this integration between
your understanding

56
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:30,281
and the understanding of Shri Ganesha, within you.

57
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:39,848
For example, we go to extremes, extremes of behaviour.

58
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,397
I would give you a very simple example:

59
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,397
I was going to Hong Kong

60
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:52,732
and the lady who organised it,
she telephoned to me again and again

61
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:59,006
and she told me that, “A big batch of people are coming to receive you

62
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:07,062
and you are going to be on the television
from the moment you land..

63
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:09,553
and this is going to happen and that is going to happen”.

64
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:11,820
Every day spending so much money.

65
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:14,820
Describing to me the scene

66
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:20,362
that I’ll be a “hot news” and all sorts of things, you see,

67
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:23,362
encourage lots of people to come and see you

68
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:27,036
And she was on and on and on.

69
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:31,036
And also, she told Dr Warren

70
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:36,490
except for giving the newspaper [advert] she didn’t
have to pay for it.

71
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:43,160
It was going too far.

72
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:51,280
At that juncture, just it was not necessary

73
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:56,830
to go to such a limit and plan it out that there will be people coming

74
00:12:57,031 --> 00:12:59,848
inside the aeroplane to receive me

75
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:01,383
makes no difference to me!

76
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:06,009
And there would be a car waiting near
the aeroplane just to receive me.

77
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:13,915
I don’t know! I don’t know who was waiting
where, at every point!

78
00:13:14,696 --> 00:13:17,307
And when we reached there, it was six
hours late

79
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:22,772
and I told Warren, “It’s all going to be a fizzled out, take it easy!”

80
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,543
And the plane just deposited us in Bangkok!

81
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,943
There was no way – six hours.

82
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:38,263
And we had to take another plane

83
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:43,494
in which nobody came in

84
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:45,494
no car

85
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:46,494
nothing.

86
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:50,400
We went down looking for her, couldn’t see
her.

87
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:55,442
Telephoned to the hotel, they said, “No arrangements thrown.”

88
00:13:55,643 --> 00:14:00,433
Warren thought, “Mother has gone to another extreme now!”

89
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:09,553
Quite worried that there’s no one to receive us at the airport in Hong Kong.

90
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:12,152
It’s all a joke

91
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:17,879
Going to extremes has to be corrected in you as well.

92
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,758
because if you get successful with your this kind of planning,

93
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,675
then you’ll go on doing this kind of artificial planning

94
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:27,935
and not the planning of the divine.

95
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:30,824
The divine has its own plans

96
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:33,824
and we have to feel the plans of the divine.

97
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:38,679
It works it out. You are just an instrument to work it out.

98
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:46,573
So if you try to do something of your own,
something too much,

99
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:53,010
then who is going to suggest the balance - is Shri Ganesh

100
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:57,481
And that balance, once it’s established in you

101
00:14:57,682 --> 00:15:00,985
you know how you should balance yourself.

102
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:03,985
Now, there is no alternative

103
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:08,014
for Sahaj Yog, no alternative.

104
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:10,014
One must know.

105
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:13,765
Everything that is living has no alternatives.

106
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:22,474
For example, if a mango tree says that,
“I will create a pomegranate,” it cannot!

107
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:28,202
There’s no alternatives. Whatever is there, it has to see and enjoy;

108
00:15:28,403 --> 00:15:31,241
but not to force its way on it.

109
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:34,879
This is one of the things we have to understand

110
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,935
to establish our wisdom.

111
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:50,003
Because of our concept, our idea, our anything,

112
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:58,456
even about God for example, about our achievements itself,

113
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:03,543
can be absolutely wrong if you have no wisdom.

114
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:12,562
But in nature, if you see, those who grow

115
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,959
are never bothered about what shape
they are going to take, do they?

116
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,566
Does a tree measure itself up to know how
many dimensions it is going to grow?

117
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:27,588
It grows as much as it can

118
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:30,188
slowly, steadily

119
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:35,492
in coordination with nature itself.

120
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:46,144
Like that, the wisdom is the one that understands.

121
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:51,327
It is an establishment, is a state of mind.

122
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:57,725
We can say it’s the state of being, when you become wisdom.

123
00:16:59,574 --> 00:17:07,175
Such a wisdom outside, also expresses so beautifully.

124
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:13,841
Such a wisdom gives you a gentleman and a gentlelady

125
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:24,286
only in a personality which is settled down.

126
00:17:24,776 --> 00:17:27,070
If you are frustrated

127
00:17:27,076 --> 00:17:29,070
and if there’s a problem

128
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:32,763
if you are unhappy, if you are suppressed

129
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:42,332
any extremes will not allow this flower of wisdom to grow.

130
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:45,318
So even in frustration you have to look back,

131
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,099
you have to stand back and see for yourself,

132
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,253
“Why am I to be so frustrated?”

133
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:56,068
Count your blessings one by one.

134
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:58,068
Count your blessings one by one.

135
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:04,482
I’ll say again, count your blessings one by one.

136
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,564
Once you start counting your blessings,

137
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:13,068
you will find in such a short time, where are you.

138
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:17,679
Now the extreme projections of the mind can take you to:

139
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:24,079
“I’m not going to face!” and you would like to do it.

140
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:38,070
But in wise projection, you can see this, that you are what you have to be.

141
00:18:38,271 --> 00:18:41,585
You are saints.

142
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:46,059
You were born to be saints in this great country.

143
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,636
You are specially blessed people in the heavens,

144
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:59,238
and are sent on this Earth to do this Maha Yoga, to spread it.

145
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,921
You have achieved that state.

146
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:07,272
And if you are saints, you should not be bothered as to a few things like,

147
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:12,348
“Oh! I haven’t got a suitcase” or something
sort of a thing like that

148
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,470
which you have never been very much bothered before.

149
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,848
Can you see that?

150
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:21,218
Any kind of extreme behaviour

151
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,703
For example, for materialism you people are not so bad

152
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:32,653
in the sense that you understand the value
of aesthetics.

153
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:38,130
But in possessiveness let us take the wise
path, the wisdom

154
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:39,925
logical, it has to be logical

155
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:48,925
What do we possess in this world?

156
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:53,649
Just think of one thing that we can possess!

157
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:57,560
Except for your own Spirit, you don’t possess anything.

158
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:03,118
Except for your evolutionary development, you don’t possess anything.

159
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:06,288
For example, now you are a saint you’ll be born a saint always

160
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:10,018
this is what you possess

161
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:11,018
The rest you don’t possess

162
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:13,106
It’s logical, logical.

163
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:17,106
You need not to be realised to understand what I am saying.

164
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:24,967
So why should we worry about our possessions?

165
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:30,073
When you leave this worry, this is another wisdom,

166
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:32,124
this is the higher wisdom

167
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:35,724
which you develop within yourself.

168
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:40,708
And if we leave our possessions, our material problems are solved.

169
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:43,348
‘Leave’ doesn’t mean you throw them in the sea,

170
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:46,848
but the attachment to it dissolves

171
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:49,345
It is solved.

172
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:51,745
Let me give you an example

173
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:55,848
Like Kay lost her travellers’ cheques

174
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:58,547
she did not know, she was not knowing

175
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:00,848
Suddenly one man bumped into her.

176
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:03,025
I was with her.

177
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:06,437
He said, “Imagine, I never knew I was going to meet you!”

178
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:10,367
He said, “I went to a particular cashier or somebody"

179
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:14,751
And he said “Do you know this lady? I’ve got her travellers cheques with me.”

180
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:18,829
And here, suddenly, I bump into you!”

181
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,158
How the news has been organised, in the nature you see,

182
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:28,561
when the flowers bloom, how these bees come all the way.

183
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:36,071
184
How the birds fly all the way from Siberia to Australia?

184
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:39,969
"What wisdom, is that magnetism in them"

185
"00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,121
the magnetism that is in the Mother Earth"

185
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:51,537
which tells them, “This is the way you have to go.”

186
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:56,100
So we have to see to this magnetism within us:

187
00:21:56,301 --> 00:22:03,151
What makes us magnetic

188
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:07,190
is not what we could have, what unnatural
things we have

189
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:09,637
but what naturally we have achieved within

190
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:12,834
and we are not afraid to express it

191
00:22:13,035 --> 00:22:18,134
In fear you are never aggressive

192
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:28,801
but even in fearlessness you are never aggressive

193
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:35,481
In fear you might say that you are not afraid

194
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:39,484
but you could be aggressive

195
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:46,131
When people look very frightened, if you push them

196
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:51,919
to the extreme of fright, they can come back

197
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,534
But if you are fearless, you are innocent

198
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:58,534
you are just standing and watching

199
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:07,942
Fearlessness never means aggression

200
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:13,825
So the confusion of our own concepts

201
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,848
can only be cleared out

202
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:19,743
if there is light within us.

203
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:25,463
For us, if somebody is aggressing us, then we think

204
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:29,193
[that] if we do not aggress the other
person, we are frightened

205
00:23:29,394 --> 00:23:32,445
then we are useless,

206
00:23:32,448 --> 00:23:37,845
we are weak, we are weak people

207
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:39,848
so we should fight back.

208
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:44,546
Even when you are fighting back, you are weak people.

209
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:50,673
If it was not so, what is there to fight
back?

210
00:23:50,874 --> 00:23:55,653
In fearlessness you become the witness.

211
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:57,950
You see the joke

212
00:23:57,964 --> 00:24:01,950
joke behind all this extreme behaviour of another person.

213
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:06,268
And also you know the technique, kaushalam.

214
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:09,284
Yoga also means kaushalam, it means technique

215
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:11,284
how to manage the show

216
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:18,049
by which his action doesn’t trouble you

217
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:21,049
if you want to.

218
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:25,872
If you don’t want, you can even take
the action upon yourself, to prove it

219
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:30,641
that, “Whatever you are doing is a little
silly and stupid.”

220
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:34,643
Like Christ getting Himself crucified.

221
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:39,589
It was a wise decision to do

222
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:44,796
because if you have to prove that life is eternal

223
00:24:44,997 --> 00:24:48,440
the best thing is to die and show.

224
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:53,206
And to be [done] publicly, so that nobody
should say that he was not dead.

225
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:57,066
Still there are many people who are saying he was not dead.

226
00:24:57,267 --> 00:25:00,722
Still there are people who are talking this: “He was not dead.

227
00:25:00,923 --> 00:25:04,971
He was alive. So he got out of the place.”

228
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:09,505
Because they don’t know how to explain!

229
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:16,147
So he had to die publicly

230
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:23,133
and then his resurrection was to be seen
by many people.

231
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:31,809
This drama had to be performed

232
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:39,564
for you to have the wisdom to know that life is eternal.

233
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:45,475
It doesn’t mean that he was weak, by any chance.

234
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:55,490
So the idea of our aggression, or our suppression

235
00:25:55,548 --> 00:26:03,149
Both come from either fear

236
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:12,149
or some sort of a satanic pleasure

237
00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:16,149
to oppress others

238
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:21,825
So wisdom lies in seeing yourself also

239
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,123
See how wisdom is so important!

240
00:26:25,324 --> 00:26:30,596
Throughout if you find, in every chakra resides pranava

241
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,544
is the life of every chakra.

242
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:39,453
Because it is the wisdom that tells you whether you are in the chakra or not.

243
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:42,540
So how wisdom is [so] important

244
00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:45,148
that you even become a sakshi if you have wisdom

245
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:46,002
otherwise you cannot

246
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:52,447
You become a witness only when you have that focal point

247
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:59,848
adjusted to your centre of gravity

248
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:03,398
That is wisdom!

249
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:07,275
When people tell me about somebody who has harmed them

250
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:12,309
they paint such a dark picture of the whole thing

251
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:19,306
as if it was another war that was fought.

252
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:23,135
Then you go and listen to another side,

253
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:28,733
they paint another horrible picture
of this side.

254
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:34,415
Between these two pictures you stand.

255
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:40,119
You find the one is reflecting the other,
the other is reflecting the other.

256
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:50,200
There is no end to it, it’s eternally going
on from this to that, to that to this.

257
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:56,367
How do you end it up?

258
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:05,610
Only by your wisdom, by understanding it’s an illusion.

259
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:10,020
The main thing is the mirror on which it is reflected,

260
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:16,558
It’s just an illusion that is appearing, and we are worried about it.

261
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:21,096
The whole illusion will drop out as soon as you just see the mirror

262
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:25,310
and don’t worry about the reflections.

263
00:28:27,694 --> 00:28:33,225
They’ll come and go: it is for you just to witness it, that’s all.

264
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:38,049
It’s not..the mirror is a mirror, which is a solid thing,

265
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:42,372
and all the reflections are illusions.

266
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:53,576
That’s how we miss all the sweetness of our own being.

267
00:28:58,228 --> 00:29:04,446
Wisdom lies in understanding that you are the Spirit.

268
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:07,648
You are not all these illusions. You are the Spirit.

269
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:11,340
You are the Spirit.

270
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,449
The attention was, as animals, was on food only, you can say.

271
00:29:15,658 --> 00:29:19,600
You were aware of food, nothing else but food only.

272
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,404
This grows higher and higher in awareness,

273
00:29:22,605 --> 00:29:25,848
then he came up to a point where he started thinking that

274
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:28,848
he is the prime minister

275
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:31,262
or he is an actor or an actress

276
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:35,085
and this and that and so-called things they have achieved.

277
00:29:35,286 --> 00:29:40,893
Or maybe they start thinking - oh, they are atheists

278
00:29:41,094 --> 00:29:43,042
agnostics and all sorts of things, you see.

279
00:29:43,094 --> 00:29:46,042
Communists!

280
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:52,042
And specialists!

281
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,848
It’s a drama going on!

282
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:03,707
They are wearing wigs after wigs.

283
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:06,815
If they like this wig they’ll wear this, otherwise throw away!

284
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:09,874
This has killed the romance completely!

285
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:14,530
You start loving the wigs of a person!

286
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:20,924
And wigs can be bought!

287
00:30:22,848 --> 00:30:24,924
They could be exchanged.

288
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:30,753
If you go into the market, you can get about ten types of wigs.

289
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:36,903
Supposing you say, “Oh, I like this colour for the hair,”

290
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:41,719
so the lady will go and wear that and come out

291
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,694
and then you’ll like her for the wig that she has got

292
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:50,485
Then another may wear the same

293
00:30:50,686 --> 00:30:58,569
Or this same lady, who looks nice with one wig,

294
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,151
could bore you completely!

295
00:31:01,352 --> 00:31:09,885
Because there’s no living dynamism, that charisma

296
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:14,056
Every moment is so beautiful

297
00:31:14,086 --> 00:31:16,096
It breaks into new waves

298
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:20,023
of such beautiful colours and beautiful music.

299
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:26,267
That’s all lost with these bought images.

300
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:31,987
Every minute the image changes, with a living personality,

301
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:33,761
into tremendous beauty.

302
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,761
But the first point is the wisdom

303
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:38,688
to know that our images cannot be purchased

304
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:41,848
or bought or created or made.

305
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:45,523
They evolve!

306
00:31:46,874 --> 00:31:50,131
So we have to only see to our evolving force..

307
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:53,160
are we nearer it or are we out of it?

308
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:57,848
Are we moving with our evolving force

309
00:31:58,043 --> 00:32:01,879
Of getting ourselves crucified

310
00:32:02,043 --> 00:32:10,079
with all these artificial misidentifications that says that,

311
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,148
You are this, you are that.

312
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,698
You are nothing but a seeker.

313
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:17,383
It’s a category, I have told many-a-times

314
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:19,383
that you are a seeker and you have to seek

315
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:23,361
Now, what do you seek? Is your Spirit.

316
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:26,397
And once you have found it, establish yourself on that.

317
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:27,697
That’s what you are!

318
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:34,169
And to know that you are that Spirit itself is so satisfying

319
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:40,189
is itself emitting wisdom in you

320
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,848
Which is so joy giving

321
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,848
and is nothing but love

322
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,789
It’s love, I tell you!

323
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,355
I mean, I cannot go beyond this.

324
00:32:49,556 --> 00:32:56,988
There’s no word in human language to say
what is love.

325
00:32:57,189 --> 00:33:01,085
To me it is nothing but silence.

326
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:04,585
Everything stops at that point.

327
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:09,567
This feeling within yourself, where the wisdom is becoming love,

328
00:33:09,768 --> 00:33:11,971
and love becomes wisdom.

329
00:33:12,068 --> 00:33:16,971
that’s the real integration of life.

330
00:33:17,172 --> 00:33:19,810
Open your hearts!

331
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:25,848
Allow Shri Ganesha to be settled in that

332
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:29,094
That innocence which enhances everything.

333
00:33:29,295 --> 00:33:31,139
Look at the little ones.

334
00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:33,139
How they came forward to give me flowers.

335
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:38,588
Every step, every movement was so joyous

336
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:43,291
was creating such a beautiful, delicate ripple in my heart.

337
00:33:43,492 --> 00:33:47,940
And it’s written as history for me,

338
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:55,007
to see these little, little sweet, innocent Ganeshas coming forward

339
00:33:55,393 --> 00:33:59,778
And the wisdom becomes so powerful

340
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:04,496
that you know the source of love as Ganesha in you.

341
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:07,382
For him, he did not know anybody else but one

342
00:34:07,448 --> 00:34:11,682
That which is the source of love.

343
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:18,680
Never questioned, never argued. No alternatives!

344
00:34:18,881 --> 00:34:25,817
No new ideas came to his mind.

345
00:34:25,848 --> 00:34:28,817
It's just taking in.

346
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:35,628
Working it out within yourself and the whole thing just works out.

347
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:40,628
The more you enter into it, you will
understand that you have really entered

348
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:44,055
into the Kingdom of God where he looks after everyone.

349
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,848
You want a house? All right, have it!

350
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:50,035
What do you want? You want that? Alright!

351
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:51,035
You have a problem? Have it.

352
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:55,328
It’s all God’s, the own thing. Who owns it but God?

353
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:59,826
He is the One who owns everything and He’s
the One who enjoys everything.

354
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:03,527
And he wants you to enjoy everything.

355
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:10,650
Only through the power of your wisdom that you can achieve it

356
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:19,204
Today, You all have to show a part of that achievement in your wisdom

357
00:35:19,405 --> 00:35:25,281
in which there is no artificiality. It’s so natural.

358
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:31,508
But natural doesn’t mean baser. Some
people think to be angry is also natural.

359
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:35,566
But you are a human being and
a Sahaja Yogi.

360
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,626
Whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

361
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:43,908
is not the same as whatever is natural
to a buffalo.

362
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:49,453
We have nothing to learn from them,
they have to learn from us.

363
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:53,712
So whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

364
00:35:53,913 --> 00:35:57,764
has to be learnt in the school of wisdom.

365
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:01,409
Not by any rules or anything

366
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,209
that I say, “You don’t do this,” and, “You do this!”

367
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:09,777
“You are not to do like that.” “You are not
to do this way!”

368
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:21,203
Even in the hand if you see: this portion is Australia.

369
00:36:21,984 --> 00:36:27,680
Now just see: this portion is the source for all the fingers

370
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:31,231
is the connecting point, this is your point

371
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:35,631
But it doesn’t say anything!

372
00:36:35,832 --> 00:36:39,336
For example, this thumb means something,

373
00:36:39,537 --> 00:36:40,848
this finger means something

374
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:41,985
this means something

375
00:36:42,186 --> 00:36:47,106
but this doesn’t say anything, doesn’t do anything.

376
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:50,303
But without this nothing exists.

377
00:36:50,504 --> 00:36:55,821
If it is cut out here, you are paralysed,
all the movements are finished, you see.

378
00:36:56,022 --> 00:37:05,364
This is the connecting link with the divine
and the guiding link.

379
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:07,405
This only tells which finger to move

380
00:37:07,565 --> 00:37:10,405
where to take, how to contract which muscle.

381
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:16,588
All of this is controlled in this portion.

382
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:25,804
The day will come when the information
will reach the whole world

383
00:37:26,005 --> 00:37:30,887
through the awakening of Ganesha in my children

384
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:33,887
the Sahaja Yogis in Australia.

385
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:40,353
And the whole world is going to get the blessings coming into it

386
00:37:40,554 --> 00:37:44,032
Of course, you know that Kundalini is in India

387
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:49,032
and only then the Kundalini can rise.

388
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:57,546
But one thing you have to remember

389
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:04,843
is that you are really placed at a very pivotal point here

390
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:09,980
and that the responsibility is too much on you.

391
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:17,773
And the responsibility is to keep the whole atmosphere pure

392
00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:21,968
and send forth all the fragrance of the lotus.

393
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:28,634
Though maybe you will feel you are surrounded by all the mud and everything,

394
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:34,940
but still you have to be very strong lotuses.

395
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:40,445
For the whole world you have to come up

396
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:45,898
and send forth that beautiful fragrance

397
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:52,715
of announcement that the Blossom Time has come.

398
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:56,888
I was asking for the river’s name

399
00:38:57,059 --> 00:38:58,888
what’s the name of the river

400
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:02,505
I wonder if you thought about it

401
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:05,505
See, the river’s name is ‘Parramatta’

402
00:39:05,706 --> 00:39:10,858
‘Para’ in Greek means ‘above, beyond’ should be Para

403
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:14,848
And ‘Mata’ means ‘the mother’

404
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:19,827
Your river’s name itself is Parramatta.

405
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:26,510
It’s a Greek word and how the Greeks
have known this word ‘Parramatta’?

406
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:30,732
This river had to be here, the Adi Shakti itself only, had to be here

407
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:34,945
to bless the Ganesha all the time which has to do the work.

408
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:40,121
He’s the one who sorts out

409
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:42,521
The Lambodara!

410
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:50,523
The one you will see in the Sistine Chapel, very well pointed out.

411
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,429
It’s a huge big stomach.

412
00:39:52,454 --> 00:39:54,848
It’s really an Australian character, personality,

413
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:03,887
standing there, sorting out people,
throwing left to the right.

414
00:40:04,088 --> 00:40:08,042
It’s so beautiful, I wish you could get
that picture some time.

415
00:40:08,243 --> 00:40:12,996
And you will be surprised – it’s an
Australian. you can see it perfectly -

416
00:40:13,197 --> 00:40:16,295
it’s Australian character.

417
00:40:16,496 --> 00:40:22,784
That is Christ, absolutely an Australian
body, standing up.

418
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:27,178
I don’t know how Michelangelo could see that so clearly

419
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:32,429
that he had to be Australian like that.

420
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:44,201
It has been so beautiful to come down here.

421
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:46,201
So beautiful.

422
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:56,268
It’s blissful for you maybe, but for me it’s nothing but complete joy.

423
00:40:56,458 --> 00:41:01,268
complete joy.

424
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:10,555
I had told that I will not do anything
after three years time;

425
00:41:10,756 --> 00:41:12,129
I will just settle down

426
00:41:12,146 --> 00:41:15,129
because the saintly person is not supposed

427
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,752
to move from places to places, they must settle down,

428
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:22,716
they must have their own round pillow that’s called as takiya,

429
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,675
and you are not to leave that.

430
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:30,675
But I am a Mother who is moving all over.

431
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:36,787
And can you imagine, I’ve been all over
the places, but never to Australia before.

432
00:41:36,988 --> 00:41:45,768
So to come here first thing was so great
that even,

433
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:50,859
today I have not been able to put
all that into words.

434
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,559
May God bless you all.

435
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:24,461
You are really the Ganeshas, the amount
of food you have.
