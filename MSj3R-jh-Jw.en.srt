1
01:39:42,906 --> 01:39:51,486
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
01:39:51,486 --> 01:40:02,295
So much has been said and really my heart
is full of gratitude for all of you to come

3
01:40:02,295 --> 01:40:13,356
here, all the way, and the way people have
described about Sahaja Yoga.

4
01:40:13,356 --> 01:40:21,226
To understand Sahaja Yoga, we should know
where are we today in this Kali Yuga.

5
01:40:21,226 --> 01:40:23,876
What are we facing today?

6
01:40:23,876 --> 01:40:31,446
It should really make you feel quite disturbed
to see the way things are going on in every

7
01:40:31,446 --> 01:40:32,966
country, everywhere.

8
01:40:32,966 --> 01:40:35,926
What's the problem?

9
01:40:35,926 --> 01:40:47,986
What is the, such a need for people to become
so restless, full of tensions.

10
01:40:47,986 --> 01:40:55,616
Collectively, country-wise, anywhere you go
you find some sort of a confusion.

11
01:40:55,616 --> 01:40:58,186
Terrible.

12
01:40:58,186 --> 01:41:09,086
The whole society seems to be boiling with
a kind of a fear of destruction.

13
01:41:09,086 --> 01:41:10,276
What is the reason?

14
01:41:10,276 --> 01:41:16,246
There are so many religions, so many organized,
disorganized, all kinds of things.

15
01:41:16,246 --> 01:41:20,116
There are so many sadhus and saints.

16
01:41:20,116 --> 01:41:26,186
There are so many books written about what
you should have.

17
01:41:26,186 --> 01:41:40,616
But the only one who is a seeker of truth
should see one point: Why, why there is so

18
01:41:40,616 --> 01:41:45,926
much problem in this world and how can you
help them?

19
01:41:45,926 --> 01:41:48,665
Where is the problem?

20
01:41:48,665 --> 01:41:53,836
It is inside the human being.

21
01:41:53,836 --> 01:41:59,636
As described, you see, we have come out of
a animal stage to a human stage.

22
01:41:59,636 --> 01:42:02,276
We have a human awareness, no doubt.

23
01:42:02,276 --> 01:42:12,876
In that awareness, we start seeing all kinds
of things that are not good, which are destructive,

24
01:42:12,876 --> 01:42:14,836
which are disturbing.

25
01:42:14,836 --> 01:42:18,416
If it doesn't disturb you, that means you
are not at all a sensitive person.

26
01:42:18,416 --> 01:42:22,776
But you are sensitive as a human being.

27
01:42:22,776 --> 01:42:26,766
So now what is the reason for this, is there.

28
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:33,886
In every field of life, whether it is political,
economic or any field of life in which human

29
01:42:33,886 --> 01:42:44,636
beings are living, there's a very subtle problem
which people don't understand.

30
01:42:44,636 --> 01:42:53,145
Now if I say that, "There is spirit within
us which shines in our heart," you need not

31
01:42:53,145 --> 01:42:55,526
believe, need not believe.

32
01:42:55,526 --> 01:43:00,206
But our attention is not on the spirit.

33
01:43:00,206 --> 01:43:08,956
They call it "atma vimukh" - our attention
is outside.

34
01:43:08,956 --> 01:43:17,946
At this stage at the human awareness, our
attention is outside, outside in various things.

35
01:43:17,946 --> 01:43:20,886
Now where should our attention go?

36
01:43:20,886 --> 01:43:24,346
To evolve, for what?

37
01:43:24,346 --> 01:43:26,786
To achieve what?

38
01:43:26,786 --> 01:43:41,946
The firstly, our attention has now go towards
our spirit, towards spiritual understanding.

39
01:43:41,946 --> 01:43:46,876
This is one thing has to happen to human beings
to begin with.

40
01:43:46,876 --> 01:43:49,056
Otherwise our attention is outside.

41
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:54,866
We are worried about money, worried about
power, worried about this, worried about that,

42
01:43:54,866 --> 01:43:58,485
in competition and all kinds of things going
on.

43
01:43:58,485 --> 01:44:08,996
But if your attention is turned somehow towards
your spirit then what happens to you is that

44
01:44:08,996 --> 01:44:16,846
you become a power of the spirit.

45
01:44:16,846 --> 01:44:24,186
And the power of the spirit is the highest
power that you could think of.

46
01:44:24,186 --> 01:44:31,406
First of all, spirit is the one that loves.

47
01:44:31,406 --> 01:44:40,346
Loves without asking for anything, without
expecting anything, just loves.

48
01:44:40,346 --> 01:44:47,776
It's an unconditional type of a personality
which just emits love.

49
01:44:47,776 --> 01:44:54,246
Anybody in trouble, anybody having a problem,
just it flows.

50
01:44:54,246 --> 01:45:02,216
This capacity to flow in the heart exists
but on top of that, is the closing point,

51
01:45:02,216 --> 01:45:07,126
is that our attention is not on our spirit.

52
01:45:07,126 --> 01:45:14,385
Even in political endeavors or your economic
endeavors, any endeavor, what happens is that

53
01:45:14,385 --> 01:45:17,466
attention is outside.

54
01:45:17,466 --> 01:45:26,376
So you go into competition, you go into this
thing, you go on becoming very competent and

55
01:45:26,376 --> 01:45:30,036
then suddenly you find another one coming
up.

56
01:45:30,036 --> 01:45:35,926
There are so many struggles when your attention
is outside.

57
01:45:35,926 --> 01:45:41,046
Because in attention outside, there is no
purity.

58
01:45:41,046 --> 01:45:43,926
There is no purity.

59
01:45:43,926 --> 01:45:49,986
It's just attention to yourself and that too
is so limited.

60
01:45:49,986 --> 01:45:59,426
Very limited it is because if you pay attention
to yourself, there's no end to your troubles

61
01:45:59,426 --> 01:46:01,046
and woes.

62
01:46:01,046 --> 01:46:06,636
For a person, as they said, really is fact
that: I don't mind sleeping anywhere.

63
01:46:06,636 --> 01:46:08,646
I don't mind eating anything.

64
01:46:08,646 --> 01:46:12,256
I am not bothered about all these things,
is a fact.

65
01:46:12,256 --> 01:46:17,646
Because, you see, it's not very important
I think.

66
01:46:17,646 --> 01:46:19,665
But without thinking, I am made like that.

67
01:46:19,665 --> 01:46:21,486
I am like that, all right.

68
01:46:21,486 --> 01:46:24,246
But Sahaja yogis have become like this.

69
01:46:24,246 --> 01:46:32,616
This is the miracle that human beings have
turned their attention to their spirit.

70
01:46:32,616 --> 01:46:37,605
Then you are amazed how things work out.

71
01:46:37,605 --> 01:46:47,896
Without any competition, without any fights,
without any quarrels, how your attention becomes

72
01:46:47,896 --> 01:46:49,846
fixed on your spirit.

73
01:46:49,846 --> 01:46:55,346
First, the first thing that happens to you
is good health.

74
01:46:55,346 --> 01:46:58,466
Your health improves.

75
01:46:58,466 --> 01:47:04,575
Firstly, if your health is all right, I mean
so many problems are solved.

76
01:47:04,575 --> 01:47:09,586
This world, I think at least 30% people are
always sick.

77
01:47:09,586 --> 01:47:15,385
Because of the tensions, maybe because of
bad food and this and that.

78
01:47:15,385 --> 01:47:20,096
This is first thing that happens to you is
your health improves.

79
01:47:20,096 --> 01:47:27,706
Today now in Sahaja Yoga, we have people who
have learned that by these modern ways of

80
01:47:27,706 --> 01:47:32,706
economics and all that, has not given any
peace to anyone.

81
01:47:32,706 --> 01:47:38,436
We think of America; I mean I've been to America,
I know Americans: How terribly disturbed they

82
01:47:38,436 --> 01:47:39,436
are.

83
01:47:39,436 --> 01:47:40,436
Their families are ruined.

84
01:47:40,436 --> 01:47:41,436
Their children are ruined.

85
01:47:41,436 --> 01:47:45,156
And all kinds of stupid things are happening.

86
01:47:45,156 --> 01:47:49,206
Our Indian gurus are going and making a big
money there.

87
01:47:49,206 --> 01:47:50,876
And they just want peace.

88
01:47:50,876 --> 01:47:54,146
They just want peace of the heart.

89
01:47:54,146 --> 01:48:00,066
That's only possible when your attention goes
to your heart because in the heart resides

90
01:48:00,066 --> 01:48:05,186
the spirit and the spirit is the source of
peace.

91
01:48:05,186 --> 01:48:13,825
First is the love and second as I told you
just now is the peace.

92
01:48:13,825 --> 01:48:16,755
You become extremely peaceful.

93
01:48:16,755 --> 01:48:21,885
You become like a witness and you see the
whole drama like a joke.

94
01:48:21,885 --> 01:48:25,856
It's nothing so serious to be worried about.

95
01:48:25,856 --> 01:48:28,505
It all works out.

96
01:48:28,505 --> 01:48:36,216
And this is what one has to become is to become
the spirit which is your own, which is in

97
01:48:36,216 --> 01:48:44,886
your own heart and that is the source, as
I told you, of love and again I say of peace.

98
01:48:44,886 --> 01:48:56,036
And the third thing that happens to you, that
the source of spirit being joy, that joy bubbles

99
01:48:56,036 --> 01:48:57,955
in your life.

100
01:48:57,955 --> 01:48:59,226
It just bubbles in your life.

101
01:48:59,226 --> 01:49:07,356
You don't know how to get out of that great
ocean of joy.

102
01:49:07,356 --> 01:49:11,816
You start swimming in it, enjoying it, every
bit of it.

103
01:49:11,816 --> 01:49:18,185
You touch all the shores, going round the
whole world, their hearts and everything.

104
01:49:18,185 --> 01:49:20,786
It is in the heart that resides.

105
01:49:20,786 --> 01:49:24,955
Again I say, it is not in the brain.

106
01:49:24,955 --> 01:49:29,656
No mental activity can take you to spirit.

107
01:49:29,656 --> 01:49:35,465
Spirit is only possible if your attention
could be somehow taken to the spirit.

108
01:49:35,465 --> 01:49:40,156
And that's possible only through Kundalini
awakening.

109
01:49:40,156 --> 01:49:48,786
This change of attitude towards life, this
change of complete peace and joy has come

110
01:49:48,786 --> 01:49:55,156
to you all because your attention is now on
your spirit.

111
01:49:55,156 --> 01:49:59,175
Now you don't think of money, money walks
your way.

112
01:49:59,175 --> 01:50:02,536
You don't think of power, power walks your
way.

113
01:50:02,536 --> 01:50:13,465
And the power of the spirit is the highest,
the most powerful and the most righteous thing.

114
01:50:13,465 --> 01:50:22,046
It is not necessary that you should become
a sanyasi, sadhu baba, do all kinds of things.

115
01:50:22,046 --> 01:50:24,666
No necessity of these rituals.

116
01:50:24,666 --> 01:50:27,406
The spirit is residing within you.

117
01:50:27,406 --> 01:50:29,346
Already all you have done in last lives.

118
01:50:29,346 --> 01:50:35,156
Now this life only thing you have to do is
to put attention to your spirit.

119
01:50:35,156 --> 01:50:41,126
And that's only possible through the awakening
of this Kundalini - the Primordial Mother.

120
01:50:41,126 --> 01:50:45,916
When She starts, I mean that's also your own.

121
01:50:45,916 --> 01:50:55,546
When She starts rising, She passes through
the centers and enriches them, integrates

122
01:50:55,546 --> 01:51:03,515
them, and pierces through the last fontanel
bone area and makes you connected to this

123
01:51:03,515 --> 01:51:07,195
all pervading power of divine love.

124
01:51:07,195 --> 01:51:14,546
But this power of divine love is not only
"the love," if you want to say, it is also

125
01:51:14,546 --> 01:51:24,635
peace and joy and also it is the superior
wisdom.

126
01:51:24,635 --> 01:51:27,515
It is rather subtle for normal man to understand.

127
01:51:27,515 --> 01:51:28,515
I know that.

128
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:29,906
I've gone through that.

129
01:51:29,906 --> 01:51:37,735
For persons to understand that one can become
the spirit .. but this is in the evolutionary

130
01:51:37,735 --> 01:51:38,735
process.

131
01:51:38,735 --> 01:51:42,675
Today is the time for people to become the
spirit.

132
01:51:42,675 --> 01:51:49,525
This is the blessing of this blossom time
as I call it and people have to become the

133
01:51:49,525 --> 01:51:50,856
spirit.

134
01:51:50,856 --> 01:51:56,606
Otherwise what is left of them is like all
other human beings who'll, I don't where they'll

135
01:51:56,606 --> 01:51:57,775
end up.

136
01:51:57,775 --> 01:52:03,106
So this is an essential step today to become
the spirit.

137
01:52:03,106 --> 01:52:08,985
All the saints, all the prophets, all the
religions have talked about it.

138
01:52:08,985 --> 01:52:10,166
Not that they have not.

139
01:52:10,166 --> 01:52:12,075
Of course, we have twisted them.

140
01:52:12,075 --> 01:52:15,175
We have made separate, separate things.

141
01:52:15,175 --> 01:52:26,365
But it's only one simple thing is that you
are a spirit and that spirit, unless and until

142
01:52:26,365 --> 01:52:36,085
you become, you cannot achieve any peace,
any joy and no love.

143
01:52:36,085 --> 01:52:44,395
The Sahaja yogis here are sitting have achieved
it.

144
01:52:44,395 --> 01:52:51,176
They don't think they are from foreign countries
or from this country or that country.

145
01:52:51,176 --> 01:52:52,176
They don't want.

146
01:52:52,176 --> 01:52:58,346
Now here it is in this camp we don't have
very good arrangement for sleeping or eating

147
01:52:58,346 --> 01:53:01,005
or anything, no good bathrooms, nothing.

148
01:53:01,005 --> 01:53:04,455
They are just enjoying themselves.

149
01:53:04,455 --> 01:53:05,455
Nobody minds it.

150
01:53:05,455 --> 01:53:09,635
Of course certain things of particular country
may linger on.

151
01:53:09,635 --> 01:53:13,525
But then it drops, it drops.

152
01:53:13,525 --> 01:53:17,416
Gradually it starts dropping out.

153
01:53:17,416 --> 01:53:20,376
Like a flower when it becomes the fruit.

154
01:53:20,376 --> 01:53:26,056
All its petals and everything drops out and
then it becomes the fruit.

155
01:53:26,056 --> 01:53:34,385
So you have now become the fruit -fruit of
knowledge, fruit of wisdom and of love.

156
01:53:34,385 --> 01:53:38,395
For knowledge, you don't have to read books.

157
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:39,585
There's no need to.

158
01:53:39,585 --> 01:53:43,476
People who have read too many are difficult
to get Sahaja Yoga.

159
01:53:43,476 --> 01:53:51,215
But what you have to see yourself: What is
the reality?

160
01:53:51,215 --> 01:53:56,575
But that's only possible if you are a realized
soul.

161
01:53:56,575 --> 01:54:00,335
Otherwise you get lost in the illusions of
the world.

162
01:54:00,335 --> 01:54:04,855
You live with the illusions all your life,
struggling, fighting and I don't want to say

163
01:54:04,855 --> 01:54:07,085
what's the end is.

164
01:54:07,085 --> 01:54:13,385
So a simple thing that has happened with Sahaja
Yoga, in your evolutionary process your attention

165
01:54:13,385 --> 01:54:18,835
now has gone to spirit than to anything else.

166
01:54:18,835 --> 01:54:26,055
As soon as the power of the spirit comes,
you find yourself successful in everything.

167
01:54:26,055 --> 01:54:27,666
You don't want;.

168
01:54:27,666 --> 01:54:33,735
You don't ask for it and if you are not, you
don't mind.

169
01:54:33,735 --> 01:54:36,115
You don't mind because you think they don't
understand.

170
01:54:36,115 --> 01:54:38,695
It's all right, forget it.

171
01:54:38,695 --> 01:54:42,566
So there's no use fighting for it, asking
for it.

172
01:54:42,566 --> 01:54:51,545
For this, one thing is important, first and
foremost thing, you have to forgive everyone.

173
01:54:51,545 --> 01:54:56,416
Human beings, I don't know sometimes they're
illogical.

174
01:54:56,416 --> 01:54:58,816
Supposing somebody tries to harm you.

175
01:54:58,816 --> 01:55:01,085
All right, I forgive him.

176
01:55:01,085 --> 01:55:04,495
Forget it because I have no headache of that.

177
01:55:04,495 --> 01:55:08,625
What he is trying to do is to give me a headache
which I will not take.

178
01:55:08,625 --> 01:55:10,495
I just forgive.

179
01:55:10,495 --> 01:55:15,735
So that is a very important point, that Christ
has also said that, "You have to forgive."

180
01:55:15,735 --> 01:55:21,085
Mohammad Sahib has said so many things but
I don't know how people have twisted.

181
01:55:21,085 --> 01:55:25,455
Christ has said so many things, how I don't
know how they are being twisted.

182
01:55:25,455 --> 01:55:32,235
Every one of them has said one thing: that
you have to become the Spirit.

183
01:55:32,235 --> 01:55:38,656
And how people have twisted it and have formed
so many religions and in that religion why

184
01:55:38,656 --> 01:55:39,985
should they quarrel?

185
01:55:39,985 --> 01:55:43,715
If there is one God there should be no quarrel.

186
01:55:43,715 --> 01:55:48,515
Now in Sahaja yoga, you find people have come
from different race, different countries,

187
01:55:48,515 --> 01:55:51,335
different ideologies, everything.

188
01:55:51,335 --> 01:55:54,476
One thing great about Sahaja yogis, they are
very pure people.

189
01:55:54,476 --> 01:55:57,275
There's so much of purity in them.

190
01:55:57,275 --> 01:55:58,275
There's no problem.

191
01:55:58,275 --> 01:56:05,786
I do not have that problem of immorality in
Sahaja Yoga.

192
01:56:05,786 --> 01:56:08,455
We don't find anybody being immoral.

193
01:56:08,455 --> 01:56:12,695
If somebody has been immoral, he just gets
corrected.

194
01:56:12,695 --> 01:56:17,125
If somebody has been cheating, he gets corrected.

195
01:56:17,125 --> 01:56:23,165
If somebody has been a corrupt person, he
gets corrected.

196
01:56:23,165 --> 01:56:30,745
Because spirit gives the light for you to
see for yourself what is good for you.

197
01:56:30,745 --> 01:56:34,536
Supposing you are going on a road and you
are blind.

198
01:56:34,536 --> 01:56:37,085
You can walk into a ditch.

199
01:56:37,085 --> 01:56:40,685
But supposing you have the light and the eyes
open.

200
01:56:40,685 --> 01:56:42,425
You know how to go.

201
01:56:42,425 --> 01:56:48,686
And that's exactly what has happened in Sahaja
Yoga, that people have realized how to move,

202
01:56:48,686 --> 01:56:55,206
how to go about, how to walk, and not to fall
in the ditch.

203
01:56:55,206 --> 01:56:59,145
I have seen people who have fallen into ditch
also.

204
01:56:59,145 --> 01:57:01,436
But I have nothing but love for them.

205
01:57:01,436 --> 01:57:06,706
Because they were blind, you see, for a blind
person you can just have love, isn't it?

206
01:57:06,706 --> 01:57:13,636
And I found that once I forgive them completely
and I ask them, all right, even if they have

207
01:57:13,636 --> 01:57:17,585
abused Me, said things against Me, it's all
right.

208
01:57:17,585 --> 01:57:19,575
Because they don't know what they are doing.

209
01:57:19,575 --> 01:57:21,735
They are blind people.

210
01:57:21,735 --> 01:57:27,975
So once you feel that way about others, that
doesn't matter.

211
01:57:27,975 --> 01:57:35,225
Whatever they have done, whatever they have
so far, so called harmed you also, is no harm

212
01:57:35,225 --> 01:57:41,475
to you because you are standing on a pedestal
of truth.

213
01:57:41,475 --> 01:57:48,745
So the second point is that the spirit is
the source of truth, not of untruth.

214
01:57:48,745 --> 01:57:52,745
For example, there is some false guru.

215
01:57:52,745 --> 01:57:54,886
Immediately you will know who is false.

216
01:57:54,886 --> 01:57:55,886
How?

217
01:57:55,886 --> 01:58:01,776
On your vibrations, on your fingertips you
know that this man is false.

218
01:58:01,776 --> 01:58:07,906
Is all said by Mohammad Sahib that, "Your
hands will speak at the time of resurrection."

219
01:58:07,906 --> 01:58:12,215
That exactly happens that you see: this is
the trouble.

220
01:58:12,215 --> 01:58:18,995
Now if you want you can avoid that person
or if you want you can bring him round and

221
01:58:18,995 --> 01:58:20,176
put him right.

222
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:28,286
But we should not try on the complicated characters
very much in the beginning, I said, because

223
01:58:28,286 --> 01:58:30,105
they will complicate you.

224
01:58:30,105 --> 01:58:36,975
Now those people who have matured in Sahaja
Yoga can easily manage that also.

225
01:58:36,975 --> 01:58:42,066
And also we must know that all the elements
are working for us.

226
01:58:42,066 --> 01:58:49,485
All the events of the world are just to show
how wrong things are wrong and how right things

227
01:58:49,485 --> 01:58:50,676
should be done.

228
01:58:50,676 --> 01:58:53,945
Say for example, when Hitler came.

229
01:58:53,945 --> 01:58:55,845
He started destroying people.

230
01:58:55,845 --> 01:58:58,806
And he took nine years to build himself up.

231
01:58:58,806 --> 01:59:04,756
And he did all kinds of things which cannot
be forgiven by anyone.

232
01:59:04,756 --> 01:59:11,355
But he died and suddenly you find in Germany,
people are so enlightened.

233
01:59:11,355 --> 01:59:19,926
Now you heard some people, I was amazed how
they are so enlightened about love and about

234
01:59:19,926 --> 01:59:21,626
the divine.

235
01:59:21,626 --> 01:59:28,096
All these countries, I've seen are doing so
well unexpectedly.

236
01:59:28,096 --> 01:59:34,105
Imagine in England, who came to India and
ruled us for three hundred years, there are

237
01:59:34,105 --> 01:59:36,206
so many Sahaja yogis.

238
01:59:36,206 --> 01:59:44,656
And also as you see today when I speak there,
we have the whole hall filled up with people,

239
01:59:44,656 --> 01:59:45,656
in England.

240
01:59:45,656 --> 01:59:54,516
I've seen also in the countries like Russia,
where these people were on the verge of collapsing

241
01:59:54,516 --> 01:59:57,725
after they started on democracy.

242
01:59:57,725 --> 02:00:04,235
Whether it is democracy or communism or anything,
these are all isms.

243
02:00:04,235 --> 02:00:10,686
You have to come out of it and see for yourself
that so called democracy has become demon-ocracy.

244
02:00:10,686 --> 02:00:14,965
So called communism has failed.

245
02:00:14,965 --> 02:00:15,965
Why?

246
02:00:15,965 --> 02:00:17,735
Basically what's wrong with them?

247
02:00:17,735 --> 02:00:22,605
It was all based not on the spiritual level.

248
02:00:22,605 --> 02:00:24,896
There was no spirit involved in it.

249
02:00:24,896 --> 02:00:36,886
It was all based on, I should say, on the
endeavors which are outside, which were very

250
02:00:36,886 --> 02:00:38,046
limited.

251
02:00:38,046 --> 02:00:42,065
And those limits, once they break, you see
you have a problem.

252
02:00:42,065 --> 02:00:46,196
Now economics, the world economics if you
see is collapsing.

253
02:00:46,196 --> 02:00:48,495
Everywhere there is recession.

254
02:00:48,495 --> 02:00:53,146
If they are such experts then why there is
recession?

255
02:00:53,146 --> 02:00:54,806
Why there are problems?

256
02:00:54,806 --> 02:00:57,566
Now the people say we must remove the poverty.

257
02:00:57,566 --> 02:01:07,306
I agree but not by giving some sort of a beggar's
gift but with self respect.

258
02:01:07,306 --> 02:01:11,776
You can do it.

259
02:01:11,776 --> 02:01:22,546
You can do it because if you can approach
people who need with Sahaja Yoga and enrich

260
02:01:22,546 --> 02:01:28,725
them, you'll be amazed, they themselves will
do better and work it out.

261
02:01:28,725 --> 02:01:34,756
All kinds of things, you see, like in abroad
people used to say, "Mother, You talk of spiritual

262
02:01:34,756 --> 02:01:37,156
life then why is it India is so poor?"

263
02:01:37,156 --> 02:01:41,266
I said, "They are not so poor in spirituality."

264
02:01:41,266 --> 02:01:44,705
They may be poor in money.

265
02:01:44,705 --> 02:01:49,995
Those who have got lots of money, are they
also very good people?

266
02:01:49,995 --> 02:01:52,995
Are they also doing something very good?

267
02:01:52,995 --> 02:01:57,945
In the same way, those who are poor are not
doing something good that one should have

268
02:01:57,945 --> 02:01:59,066
compassion on them.

269
02:01:59,066 --> 02:02:00,066
Agreed.

270
02:02:00,066 --> 02:02:02,245
Now what to do?

271
02:02:02,245 --> 02:02:05,335
If both sides are so miserable, what should
we do?

272
02:02:05,335 --> 02:02:06,815
Is to change them.

273
02:02:06,815 --> 02:02:11,495
Change the whole attitude towards life.

274
02:02:11,495 --> 02:02:17,906
Immediately I've seen people who are supposed
to be rich start understanding poverty.

275
02:02:17,906 --> 02:02:21,416
They start sharing.

276
02:02:21,416 --> 02:02:24,866
They start working it out.

277
02:02:24,866 --> 02:02:29,836
In Sahaja Yoga, you'll be amazed how people
help each other.

278
02:02:29,836 --> 02:02:38,636
How they work out everybody's difficulties
and problems into something very beautiful.

279
02:02:38,636 --> 02:02:43,626
You see, it's the wisdom that you get from
this all pervading divine power.

280
02:02:43,626 --> 02:02:47,256
This power has been described in every religion.

281
02:02:47,256 --> 02:02:53,386
You call it nirakar, you call it ruuh, you
can call it paramchaitanya; you can call by

282
02:02:53,386 --> 02:02:54,806
any name.

283
02:02:54,806 --> 02:02:57,016
But name is not the point.

284
02:02:57,016 --> 02:03:01,605
Whatever it is, once you are connected with
this power, you are blessed.

285
02:03:01,605 --> 02:03:06,396
Thousand times you are blessed than you are
as a normal human being.

286
02:03:06,396 --> 02:03:10,616
As a normal being, no blessings it has.

287
02:03:10,616 --> 02:03:15,985
It has nothing but your own endeavors that
the amount you push in, that's what you get.

288
02:03:15,985 --> 02:03:21,136
Here nobody pushes oneself.

289
02:03:21,136 --> 02:03:22,926
Automatically you are pushed into that.

290
02:03:22,926 --> 02:03:27,516
This force, divine force brings you to that.

291
02:03:27,516 --> 02:03:32,396
And you have seen that in your own lives how
you came to Me, how you came to Sahaja Yoga.

292
02:03:32,396 --> 02:03:39,845
It was some sort of a divine force which worked
it out, which is Sahaja, which you may not

293
02:03:39,845 --> 02:03:45,059
realize but when you get your realization,
you just think about your own life: "How I

294
02:03:45,059 --> 02:03:48,745
came to Sahaja Yoga?

295
02:03:48,745 --> 02:03:50,656
How I got this?"

296
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:55,006
And then you see this peace, reigning over
your hearts.

297
02:03:55,006 --> 02:03:58,506
The love, affection, everything.

298
02:03:58,506 --> 02:04:05,636
What is, as you said, I have many powers,
maybe I don't know, but one thing for definite,

299
02:04:05,636 --> 02:04:16,656
one thing that Sahaja yogis can get all My
powers.

300
02:04:16,656 --> 02:04:27,066
As a Mother, Mother wants to give everything
to Sahaja yogis.

301
02:04:27,066 --> 02:04:38,446
This greatest joy for a Mother is to see Her
son or daughter grow up like Her.

302
02:04:38,446 --> 02:04:44,595
I, I have a great vision of life.

303
02:04:44,595 --> 02:04:49,995
And I see the picture of that here today.

304
02:04:49,995 --> 02:04:54,876
I was a ordinary housewife without much money.

305
02:04:54,876 --> 02:04:56,756
You know My interest in money is zero.

306
02:04:56,756 --> 02:05:02,235
I don't understand even the bank and the somebody
has to sign a cheque for Me.

307
02:05:02,235 --> 02:05:05,796
My husband has to count My money, I am so
bad.

308
02:05:05,796 --> 02:05:08,416
But still I've never had problem.

309
02:05:08,416 --> 02:05:18,355
Never had problem because it is the greed
in man, terrible greed in man that creates

310
02:05:18,355 --> 02:05:19,465
problems.

311
02:05:19,465 --> 02:05:27,506
But if he learns how to be satisfied, automatically
the greed drops out and you feel absolutely

312
02:05:27,506 --> 02:05:28,506
comfortable.

313
02:05:28,506 --> 02:05:33,906
But that doesn't mean that you become a sadhu
baba or you become a sanyasi or a something

314
02:05:33,906 --> 02:05:35,256
you give up.

315
02:05:35,256 --> 02:05:37,006
Those days are gone.

316
02:05:37,006 --> 02:05:39,577
Those ordeals you have passed through.

317
02:05:39,577 --> 02:05:40,577
You've been to the Himalayas.

318
02:05:40,577 --> 02:05:43,355
You've stood on your heads and did all kinds
of things.

319
02:05:43,355 --> 02:05:45,406
Now no more is needed.

320
02:05:45,406 --> 02:05:52,026
What is needed is that: you have to put your
attention to your spirit, the more you do

321
02:05:52,026 --> 02:06:01,695
it, the more you absorb all other attentions
and put it to your spirit, which is there

322
02:06:01,695 --> 02:06:03,386
already existing.

323
02:06:03,386 --> 02:06:08,416
There is nothing to be brought from outside
or nothing to be learnt.

324
02:06:08,416 --> 02:06:12,786
It is inside every one of you, is in the heart.

325
02:06:12,786 --> 02:06:17,636
Only thing you have to, you have to just feel
it.

326
02:06:17,636 --> 02:06:24,455
Now that feeling can only come if you are
awakened in the Kundalini.

327
02:06:24,455 --> 02:06:38,235
I know that no one like Mohammad Sahib or
Christ or Abraham or Moses, who have created

328
02:06:38,235 --> 02:06:46,075
books or whatever history they have created,
no where They would have ever thought that

329
02:06:46,075 --> 02:06:54,896
people will form an organized religion and
start in a way as if they are against each

330
02:06:54,896 --> 02:06:55,896
other.

331
02:06:55,896 --> 02:06:58,286
But it has happened.

332
02:06:58,286 --> 02:07:00,335
It has happened.

333
02:07:00,335 --> 02:07:07,075
To remove that, you have to give them the
knowledge, the pure knowledge.

334
02:07:07,075 --> 02:07:10,176
Not the knowledge of the book but the pure
knowledge.

335
02:07:10,176 --> 02:07:14,176
And the knowledge that is pure is wisdom.

336
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:18,435
Through this wisdom only I've worked.

337
02:07:18,435 --> 02:07:21,126
This wisdom I had from My childhood.

338
02:07:21,126 --> 02:07:22,215
Nobody has given Me.

339
02:07:22,215 --> 02:07:23,215
It's there.

340
02:07:23,215 --> 02:07:30,095
But this wisdom has taught Me one thing: that
whatsoever maybe the condition of a human

341
02:07:30,095 --> 02:07:39,186
being, whatsoever maybe his style, whatsoever
may be his ego or his conditioning if he can

342
02:07:39,186 --> 02:07:45,865
feel the love then his spirit gets [transformed?].

343
02:07:45,865 --> 02:07:48,896
This transformation has taken place.

344
02:07:48,896 --> 02:07:55,266
Here we have only one percent of the people
who have got realization all over the world.

345
02:07:55,266 --> 02:08:03,896
But I know, I remember them all today who
are not here, that they have been seekers,

346
02:08:03,896 --> 02:08:08,705
madly seeking, seeking the truth.

347
02:08:08,705 --> 02:08:12,315
They went through horrible time seeking.

348
02:08:12,315 --> 02:08:13,615
They had very bad gurus.

349
02:08:13,615 --> 02:08:17,396
They had all kinds of expenses, everything
they did.

350
02:08:17,396 --> 02:08:22,695
But once they came to Sahaja Yoga, they have
found what was the truth is.

351
02:08:22,695 --> 02:08:27,495
And the truth is very simple: that you are
the spirit.

352
02:08:27,495 --> 02:08:33,985
You are not this body, this mind, but you
are the spirit.

353
02:08:33,985 --> 02:08:37,876
This is the truth and they have found the
spirit.

354
02:08:37,876 --> 02:08:41,526
That's what is the truth that they have found.

355
02:08:41,526 --> 02:08:49,565
Once this truth is established within you,
that you are the spirit, nothing can destroy

356
02:08:49,565 --> 02:08:53,386
you, nothing can harm you.

357
02:08:53,386 --> 02:08:56,156
It cannot have any wants.

358
02:08:56,156 --> 02:08:57,156
It doesn't have.

359
02:08:57,156 --> 02:09:02,115
What wants can you have when you have the
spirit because such a satisfying thing?

360
02:09:02,115 --> 02:09:05,965
It doesn't condemn anyone.

361
02:09:05,965 --> 02:09:09,435
It doesn't runs after anyone.

362
02:09:09,435 --> 02:09:14,075
Is satisfied with itself, absolutely satisfied.

363
02:09:14,075 --> 02:09:19,735
You see, I was very anxious that I should
lead a very normal life.

364
02:09:19,735 --> 02:09:25,825
I should not be like some Himalaya fellow
or something like that.

365
02:09:25,825 --> 02:09:30,085
Because this is needed for a common people.

366
02:09:30,085 --> 02:09:36,636
Today it's a aim en mass, en mass awakening.

367
02:09:36,636 --> 02:09:38,695
It is not for one person.

368
02:09:38,695 --> 02:09:45,615
This was the thing because once any discovery
is made, supposing, and that discovery only

369
02:09:45,615 --> 02:09:48,335
is for one individual, it has no meaning.

370
02:09:48,335 --> 02:09:50,266
It has to go to masses.

371
02:09:50,266 --> 02:09:54,646
And this is what I knew: I have to do it.

372
02:09:54,646 --> 02:09:59,855
And I had to work - they say so but I don't
think I ever worked.

373
02:09:59,855 --> 02:10:02,185
I was just witness to whole thing.

374
02:10:02,185 --> 02:10:09,656
I saw it just like a witness enjoying all
kinds of things as you sit on the shore of

375
02:10:09,656 --> 02:10:10,656
a ocean.

376
02:10:10,656 --> 02:10:14,026
You see waves coming, going like that.

377
02:10:14,026 --> 02:10:25,086
But inside, inside that is a human being who
wants to evolve, who wants to become the spirit.

378
02:10:25,086 --> 02:10:28,886
Then he starts thinking what good he can do
to others.

379
02:10:28,886 --> 02:10:35,276
So far I've been very anxious that people
should become Sahaja yogis.

380
02:10:35,276 --> 02:10:39,595
I didn't take to any missionary work or any
social work.

381
02:10:39,595 --> 02:10:44,516
I used to do when I was not in Sahaja Yoga,
I should say, when I didn't start the Sahaja

382
02:10:44,516 --> 02:10:45,516
Yoga.

383
02:10:45,516 --> 02:10:54,575
But later on, I discovered that unless and
until you transform people, unless and until

384
02:10:54,575 --> 02:10:59,636
you become the spirit, you'll become like
any other social worker.

385
02:10:59,636 --> 02:11:02,335
I was working in a, say, blind school.

386
02:11:02,335 --> 02:11:07,376
I was the chairman of the blind school, blind
people.

387
02:11:07,376 --> 02:11:13,906
And I was surprised, the people who were with
Me were very funny type you know?

388
02:11:13,906 --> 02:11:19,006
The governor was to come and they said, "Who
will sit next to governor?"

389
02:11:19,006 --> 02:11:21,095
I said, "What is this?"

390
02:11:21,095 --> 02:11:25,185
So they said also, "I being the president,
I have to sit."

391
02:11:25,185 --> 02:11:26,575
I said, "Not necessary.

392
02:11:26,575 --> 02:11:28,156
I can sit anywhere."

393
02:11:28,156 --> 02:11:31,095
But they all started quarreling on this point.

394
02:11:31,095 --> 02:11:39,036
So I said, "All right, we'll take a plank
and put it on head of the - of the governor

395
02:11:39,036 --> 02:11:42,845
and you all sit on that like sparrows."

396
02:11:42,845 --> 02:11:45,935
That humor helped a lot and they settled down.

397
02:11:45,935 --> 02:11:52,136
So this is the stupid thing where you see
it, what is your position, what do you get?

398
02:11:52,136 --> 02:11:59,445
I mean it's so stupid that even the ant knows
how to work out the collectivity.

399
02:11:59,445 --> 02:12:06,195
I don't know how human beings are dying after
useless nonsensical things.

400
02:12:06,195 --> 02:12:10,805
But the only thing is, he has not yet become
the spirit.

401
02:12:10,805 --> 02:12:14,865
So he doesn't respect himself, no respect.

402
02:12:14,865 --> 02:12:20,776
So he does all these things which are not
very respectable I think.

403
02:12:20,776 --> 02:12:27,536
Then I thought that this kind of work people
are doing, they think no end of themselves.

404
02:12:27,536 --> 02:12:34,416
Once you start doing something good, why should
you think you are very great?

405
02:12:34,416 --> 02:12:40,065
I, I can't understand, you see, My brain is
that way useless.

406
02:12:40,065 --> 02:12:45,316
Because what I found with these people who
were working with Me, very anxious to take

407
02:12:45,316 --> 02:12:47,286
the credit for this.

408
02:12:47,286 --> 02:12:49,896
Somebody wanted to become the chairman, vice-chairman.

409
02:12:49,896 --> 02:12:52,425
I said, "You become everything."

410
02:12:52,425 --> 02:12:59,876
So the attention being on your promotion,
it's not a real promotion, no promotion.

411
02:12:59,876 --> 02:13:05,675
Everybody used to laugh at them, it's a degradation.

412
02:13:05,675 --> 02:13:15,266
Your promotion is not through your own being
but through your own spirit.

413
02:13:15,266 --> 02:13:22,316
Being means a very big thing, I think, but
spirit is very subtle, very beautiful which

414
02:13:22,316 --> 02:13:24,626
is residing in all of you like a light.

415
02:13:24,626 --> 02:13:27,656
It's a light in you.

416
02:13:27,656 --> 02:13:32,156
Now there are Sahaja, so many Sahaja yogis
who are giving enlightenment to others.

417
02:13:32,156 --> 02:13:34,956
There are people who are going all over the
world.

418
02:13:34,956 --> 02:13:45,016
I was surprised that people from Germany and
Austria came to help Me when I first went

419
02:13:45,016 --> 02:13:46,016
to Russia.

420
02:13:46,016 --> 02:13:48,706
I said, "What are you doing here?"

421
02:13:48,706 --> 02:13:55,406
Said, "Mother we have to do something because
so many people were killed by our forefathers."

422
02:13:55,406 --> 02:14:00,436
Then My heart started really thanking them.

423
02:14:00,436 --> 02:14:03,805
Look at this, what has come into them?

424
02:14:03,805 --> 02:14:10,426
Then they went, you'll be amazed, to Israel
and from Israel they brought lots of Sahaja

425
02:14:10,426 --> 02:14:11,746
yogis to Egypt.

426
02:14:11,746 --> 02:14:15,795
So I asked the Israelis, Sahaja yogis, "Why
are you here?"

427
02:14:15,795 --> 02:14:24,315
They said, "Mother it's our job now to make
friends with these Sahaja yogis from Egypt."

428
02:14:24,315 --> 02:14:33,126
Just see how love engulfs all these angularities,
all these thorns of life and dissolves it

429
02:14:33,126 --> 02:14:35,255
completely.

430
02:14:35,255 --> 02:14:42,336
It's so joy giving to see your love acting
on others.

431
02:14:42,336 --> 02:14:48,416
Small, small things and very big things, all
that works out with love.

432
02:14:48,416 --> 02:14:58,206
For example, in an industry now people have
problems of strikes.

433
02:14:58,206 --> 02:15:09,456
Very common struggle, haves and have not and
this going on.

434
02:15:09,456 --> 02:15:16,235
But if you can raise the people to the spiritual
height, to their spiritual need which is the

435
02:15:16,235 --> 02:15:25,166
most important need today, you'll be amazed
there will be no problem of any kind.

436
02:15:25,166 --> 02:15:29,265
You see, it is a kind of a communism.

437
02:15:29,265 --> 02:15:31,495
It's a kind of a socialism.

438
02:15:31,495 --> 02:15:33,746
It's a kind of a democracy.

439
02:15:33,746 --> 02:15:38,626
It's all things put together which works.

440
02:15:38,626 --> 02:15:46,305
Democracy means we have Sahaja yogis who wanted
to organize this.

441
02:15:46,305 --> 02:15:49,016
They said, "Mother what should we do?"

442
02:15:49,016 --> 02:15:50,616
I said, "I am not going to say anything.

443
02:15:50,616 --> 02:15:52,515
You do what you like.

444
02:15:52,515 --> 02:15:57,086
You choose whatever you like, whatever you
want to do."

445
02:15:57,086 --> 02:16:01,745
And I was just busy arranging the flowers
in the house because so many flowers came

446
02:16:01,745 --> 02:16:03,045
and I am worried about the flowers.

447
02:16:03,045 --> 02:16:06,005
I was just arranging the flowers in the house.

448
02:16:06,005 --> 02:16:14,916
And what I find, now see how they've done:
no quarrel, no fight, no discussion, nothing.

449
02:16:14,916 --> 02:16:17,896
How have they done?

450
02:16:17,896 --> 02:16:21,756
Otherwise you cannot make ten people sit together
and talk the same way.

451
02:16:21,756 --> 02:16:25,805
One will talk, another will talk, another
will talk, will go on discussing, discussing

452
02:16:25,805 --> 02:16:29,285
this, reaching nowhere.

453
02:16:29,285 --> 02:16:33,186
Otherwise only one man has to work it out,
otherwise nothing can work.

454
02:16:33,186 --> 02:16:42,216
So you see, it changes the whole atmosphere
of every human being.

455
02:16:42,216 --> 02:16:49,756
Changes his attitude, changes his endeavors
and everything becomes so beautiful and joy

456
02:16:49,756 --> 02:16:54,426
giving.

457
02:16:54,426 --> 02:17:01,126
You are a socialist also because you start
thinking about the people who are down trodden,

458
02:17:01,126 --> 02:17:10,035
people who have no money who are poor, and
you try to work out something by which they

459
02:17:10,035 --> 02:17:11,745
get some money.

460
02:17:11,745 --> 02:17:18,486
I used to go with My father for a case in
a district called Chanda.

461
02:17:18,486 --> 02:17:23,066
And there I saw people just with one cloth
around them.

462
02:17:23,066 --> 02:17:30,156
What was shocking to Me: just one cloth, whether
it is winter or summer.

463
02:17:30,156 --> 02:17:36,136
I used to weep so My father would say, "Why
to weep before them?"

464
02:17:36,136 --> 02:17:37,716
I said, "What can I do?

465
02:17:37,716 --> 02:17:40,496
I must try to do something for them."

466
02:17:40,496 --> 02:17:49,346
Now when I got so many Sahaja yogis, I told
them, "I want to help these people somehow.

467
02:17:49,346 --> 02:17:53,586
And what they make is pottery."

468
02:17:53,586 --> 02:17:55,206
So they said, "Mother, all right.

469
02:17:55,206 --> 02:17:56,566
You can get the pottery.

470
02:17:56,566 --> 02:18:00,146
We'll import here and we'll sell them."

471
02:18:00,146 --> 02:18:06,456
You'll be amazed now, these people have got
houses, they have got a good life to live

472
02:18:06,456 --> 02:18:08,186
and they are living very well.

473
02:18:08,186 --> 02:18:12,666
So in a way, it is a kind of a socialism.

474
02:18:12,666 --> 02:18:20,706
That you see problems and you know collectively
to solve it, collectively, not singularly

475
02:18:20,706 --> 02:18:21,706
but collectively.

476
02:18:21,706 --> 02:18:26,406
The all of the Sahaja yogis suggest, "Mother,
this can be solved."

477
02:18:26,406 --> 02:18:34,036
So far I have not done anything directly,
I must say, like starting a organization of

478
02:18:34,036 --> 02:18:35,166
that kind.

479
02:18:35,166 --> 02:18:41,106
But now when there are so many Sahaja yogis
with their attention on their heart, now My

480
02:18:41,106 --> 02:18:46,136
attention is going to the people who need
our help.

481
02:18:46,136 --> 02:18:53,466
So first time, I have asked them to make an
NGO for destitute women and for children who

482
02:18:53,466 --> 02:18:56,786
are being deserted by their parents.

483
02:18:56,786 --> 02:19:00,285
And immediately, you'll be amazed, it all
did.

484
02:19:00,285 --> 02:19:01,285
We got the land.

485
02:19:01,285 --> 02:19:02,285
We got the people.

486
02:19:02,285 --> 02:19:06,216
I mean, I'm not doing anything and it's all
done.

487
02:19:06,216 --> 02:19:10,956
Moreover, so many people have written, "Mother
if You want land, we can give You.

488
02:19:10,956 --> 02:19:13,426
You come here, do this, do that."

489
02:19:13,426 --> 02:19:14,996
Can you imagine?

490
02:19:14,996 --> 02:19:19,976
Once I just thought of it: that we have to
do something for the poor people.

491
02:19:19,976 --> 02:19:28,086
Also other so many things can be done with
your attention which is pure, full of love

492
02:19:28,086 --> 02:19:35,436
because the love, you see, is something that
gives you the wisdom how to do it.

493
02:19:35,436 --> 02:19:43,656
If you have love, it gives you the complete
insight into the problems and how it works.

494
02:19:43,656 --> 02:19:54,116
See it's surprising for Me, I mean, I used
to do that always but even after Sahaja Yoga

495
02:19:54,116 --> 02:19:58,216
I found that is the love is the solution.

496
02:19:58,216 --> 02:20:04,485
Is this only way we can enter into the hearts
of people.

497
02:20:04,485 --> 02:20:10,795
But for that love, we should not try to do
it for some money or for some achievements

498
02:20:10,795 --> 02:20:20,366
or for some sort of a reward, but just the
whim of the love and that is what is today

499
02:20:20,366 --> 02:20:25,596
paying all of you: The way you love all the
people.

500
02:20:25,596 --> 02:20:27,057
The way you have done so much work.

501
02:20:27,057 --> 02:20:31,716
You don't know what gratitude I have for you.

502
02:20:31,716 --> 02:20:33,876
Single-handed I could not have done it.

503
02:20:33,876 --> 02:20:36,406
I could not have gone to so many countries.

504
02:20:36,406 --> 02:20:41,976
It's a like a place like Benin, where there
are only Muslims are there, I would never

505
02:20:41,976 --> 02:20:47,636
- I could never have thought of going to that
far fetched place where these people are there

506
02:20:47,636 --> 02:20:52,736
and imagine these people are Muslims and they
have all taken to Sahaja Yoga.

507
02:20:52,736 --> 02:20:57,826
And in that they are understanding the beauty
of love.

508
02:20:57,826 --> 02:21:00,285
You, this is done by French.

509
02:21:00,285 --> 02:21:03,826
Can you believe these French?

510
02:21:03,826 --> 02:21:08,976
Going down all the way to Benin and getting
it done.

511
02:21:08,976 --> 02:21:20,426
Even English have gone all the way to different
countries; even the Austrians and also Germans

512
02:21:20,426 --> 02:21:26,716
and Italians are another quality of people
who have a very rich heart, I must say.

513
02:21:26,716 --> 02:21:32,846
They have a very rich heart and the way they
are spreading Sahaja Yoga throughout Italy

514
02:21:32,846 --> 02:21:34,146
is really remarkable.

515
02:21:34,146 --> 02:21:43,186
I am amazed how these people are approaching
all these people who have never known what

516
02:21:43,186 --> 02:21:48,295
is spirit is and how they are getting them
to Mother.

517
02:21:48,295 --> 02:21:52,666
Now with that, you see, we don't have to say
"prohibition."

518
02:21:52,666 --> 02:21:56,096
We don't have to say "don't take drugs," nothing.

519
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:58,886
No don'ts in Sahaja Yoga.

520
02:21:58,886 --> 02:21:59,916
Automatically they drop.

521
02:21:59,916 --> 02:22:02,706
I don't have to say, "Don't do it."

522
02:22:02,706 --> 02:22:05,156
Just automatically they drop.

523
02:22:05,156 --> 02:22:13,916
I mean you'll be amazed, once we had a program
and there was a light to be put in a one of

524
02:22:13,916 --> 02:22:18,616
the deepas and nobody had a matchbox.

525
02:22:18,616 --> 02:22:19,616
Can you imagine?

526
02:22:19,616 --> 02:22:20,616
Nobody has a matchbox.

527
02:22:20,616 --> 02:22:24,416
Is such a problem with thousands of people
there, nobody has matchbox.

528
02:22:24,416 --> 02:22:28,206
So we had to send somebody to get the matchbox.

529
02:22:28,206 --> 02:22:29,765
There's no need.

530
02:22:29,765 --> 02:22:32,725
So I never say, "Don't do this," never.

531
02:22:32,725 --> 02:22:38,005
I've never said it but it has worked like
that, it has worked.

532
02:22:38,005 --> 02:22:43,636
I don't know how, how you have dropped it
but it's very simple when the light of the

533
02:22:43,636 --> 02:22:45,285
spirit is there.

534
02:22:45,285 --> 02:22:49,566
In that light, you just don't.

535
02:22:49,566 --> 02:22:53,956
Now all the people have said, "Don't drink."

536
02:22:53,956 --> 02:23:01,255
Say for example: Sikhs, Muslims but you see
they all drink because they are not really

537
02:23:01,255 --> 02:23:03,906
Muslims, they are not really Sikhs.

538
02:23:03,906 --> 02:23:06,456
If they were really that, they would not have
drunk.

539
02:23:06,456 --> 02:23:10,495
How is it possible then?

540
02:23:10,495 --> 02:23:12,326
They have to be the spirit.

541
02:23:12,326 --> 02:23:17,846
In the light of the spirit, we just don't
do anything that is destructive, just don't

542
02:23:17,846 --> 02:23:18,846
do it.

543
02:23:18,846 --> 02:23:20,136
You don't have to tell anybody.

544
02:23:20,136 --> 02:23:25,296
Now you are all sitting here, you know that
I've never told you anyone, "Don't do this."

545
02:23:25,296 --> 02:23:31,156
But I was amazed in London that people overnight
gave up drugs, overnight.

546
02:23:31,156 --> 02:23:36,235
People employ military, this, that drugs is
[INAUDIBLE].

547
02:23:36,235 --> 02:23:37,785
They gave up prostitution.

548
02:23:37,785 --> 02:23:44,096
They gave (up) drugs, all kinds of destructive
things to which human being take sometimes

549
02:23:44,096 --> 02:23:50,226
out of frustration and sometimes because they
feel very lonely.

550
02:23:50,226 --> 02:23:54,376
But now in Sahaja Yoga, you can never be lonely.

551
02:23:54,376 --> 02:23:58,216
All over the world, you have brothers and
sisters.

552
02:23:58,216 --> 02:24:04,096
If they come to know somebody is there somebody
is coming, they'll all go to the airport to

553
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:05,096
receive.

554
02:24:05,096 --> 02:24:10,776
It's not a brotherhood of a ordinary life.

555
02:24:10,776 --> 02:24:12,795
It's a very deep type of a brotherhood.

556
02:24:12,795 --> 02:24:15,446
It's a very deep understanding.

557
02:24:15,446 --> 02:24:19,975
But they are very deep people, I must say,
because they have been seekers and in that

558
02:24:19,975 --> 02:24:29,525
seeking they have really got completely into
a turmoil and that has made them very deep

559
02:24:29,525 --> 02:24:30,525
people.

560
02:24:30,525 --> 02:24:35,466
This book is "Light of Quran" is written by
a lady Gilmet.

561
02:24:35,466 --> 02:24:36,466
You read it.

562
02:24:36,466 --> 02:24:39,536
I would request you to read it because she
is so deep.

563
02:24:39,536 --> 02:24:46,735
I knew she was very deep but the way she has
expressed is so beautiful, so joy giving that

564
02:24:46,735 --> 02:24:52,606
she's not a Muslim, she married a Muslim,
so called, because they were all Sahaja yogis

565
02:24:52,606 --> 02:24:58,076
and the way she has narrated her seeking is
so beautiful.

566
02:24:58,076 --> 02:25:03,995
We have so many big writers in Sahaja Yoga
who have given very, very nice books and things.

567
02:25:03,995 --> 02:25:06,146
But this Gilmet is very shy.

568
02:25:06,146 --> 02:25:07,146
She doesn't talk.

569
02:25:07,146 --> 02:25:08,586
She keeps quiet.

570
02:25:08,586 --> 02:25:12,606
But inside, she's so deep because of her seeking.

571
02:25:12,606 --> 02:25:20,066
So there are many people in this world who
are seeking the truth because they cannot

572
02:25:20,066 --> 02:25:27,725
bear the nonsense of modern world and they
are very sensitive.

573
02:25:27,725 --> 02:25:30,045
They are not insensitive, very sensitive people.

574
02:25:30,045 --> 02:25:33,966
That's how you all got your realization.

575
02:25:33,966 --> 02:25:35,805
It's nothing of Mine.

576
02:25:35,805 --> 02:25:38,456
To say that "I did it," is not proper.

577
02:25:38,456 --> 02:25:44,076
If you were not like a candle, I could not
have enlightened you.

578
02:25:44,076 --> 02:25:46,035
So I am very thankful to you.

579
02:25:46,035 --> 02:25:53,235
And I am so much enamored by the way you people
are feeling about Sahaja Yoga: that collectively

580
02:25:53,235 --> 02:25:57,626
you have to work it out, globally you have
to work it out.

581
02:25:57,626 --> 02:26:01,226
You have to help each other and bring up the
people.

582
02:26:01,226 --> 02:26:09,346
Most important thing is to create a mind universally
which is towards the spirit.

583
02:26:09,346 --> 02:26:11,966
Then we'll solve all the problems, no problem.

584
02:26:11,966 --> 02:26:18,166
Now if I say I am starting some sort of a
project here for the poor.

585
02:26:18,166 --> 02:26:22,026
Immediately all of them will send Me money.

586
02:26:22,026 --> 02:26:23,026
Immediately they'll all work.

587
02:26:23,026 --> 02:26:27,106
They'll find out who can work it out, who
can come and help Mother.

588
02:26:27,106 --> 02:26:28,896
What work can we give them?

589
02:26:28,896 --> 02:26:32,176
How to work it out, all over the world.

590
02:26:32,176 --> 02:26:34,786
I mean, it spreads so fast.

591
02:26:34,786 --> 02:26:36,936
I have to just say that.

592
02:26:36,936 --> 02:26:38,566
I never asked for money.

593
02:26:38,566 --> 02:26:44,226
I never said, "I need money," but immediately
they will plan out the whole thing, bring

594
02:26:44,226 --> 02:26:46,706
the whole thing here and work it out.

595
02:26:46,706 --> 02:26:49,805
It can work in India, it can work anywhere.

596
02:26:49,805 --> 02:26:53,066
It's not just they are interested in India.

597
02:26:53,066 --> 02:26:56,416
But globally they are interested in the problems.

598
02:26:56,416 --> 02:27:03,965
It is not for making some sort of a show or
some sort of a, we can say, a cult.

599
02:27:03,965 --> 02:27:11,826
It is something which is very innate, which
is very subtle and that works, that gives

600
02:27:11,826 --> 02:27:12,956
them joy.

601
02:27:12,956 --> 02:27:16,456
That gives them joy to do something for Sahaja
Yoga.

602
02:27:16,456 --> 02:27:27,535
I am sometimes amazed how they feel for the
whole world, how they care for the whole world,

603
02:27:27,535 --> 02:27:29,106
how they are willing to do for [?].

604
02:27:29,106 --> 02:27:32,876
Of course as I said, every country has some
problems.

605
02:27:32,876 --> 02:27:41,376
Like, we can say that north Indians are interested
always in politics because Delhi is here.

606
02:27:41,376 --> 02:27:43,316
But is reduced now, very much reduced now.

607
02:27:43,316 --> 02:27:46,166
There's not much going on.

608
02:27:46,166 --> 02:27:49,126
And they don't like to hear anything against
anyone.

609
02:27:49,126 --> 02:27:50,846
That's a good thing.

610
02:27:50,846 --> 02:27:58,216
And in the south, we can say in the beyond
Narmada river, whatever we have, Maharashtra

611
02:27:58,216 --> 02:28:02,656
and all that, they are very ritualistic, very
ritualistic people.

612
02:28:02,656 --> 02:28:07,096
Even if they put the thali [thali MEANS PLATE
FOR DINING], you must put salt here, you must

613
02:28:07,096 --> 02:28:13,156
put vegetable here, you .. so that a blind
man can also eat food properly.

614
02:28:13,156 --> 02:28:15,096
You must use only one hand.

615
02:28:15,096 --> 02:28:16,775
You must keep another hand tied up.

616
02:28:16,775 --> 02:28:22,246
They're very, very ritualistic because of
these two things, you see, in Sahaja Yoga

617
02:28:22,246 --> 02:28:24,316
they do not grow.

618
02:28:24,316 --> 02:28:31,285
Whatever it is, we have to understand that
these are [lingering PROBABLY ?] still are

619
02:28:31,285 --> 02:28:32,285
behind us.

620
02:28:32,285 --> 02:28:37,806
For example in north India, I would say if
anybody speaks anything ill about anybody,

621
02:28:37,806 --> 02:28:38,986
just put your.

622
02:28:38,986 --> 02:28:41,936
This principle of Gandhiji was correct.

623
02:28:41,936 --> 02:28:45,356
Never listen to any nonsensical gossip.

624
02:28:45,356 --> 02:28:47,255
Gossip is going on.

625
02:28:47,255 --> 02:28:51,166
People like to listen to gossip because of
this media also.

626
02:28:51,166 --> 02:28:54,316
They were showing nothing but gossip before
election.

627
02:28:54,316 --> 02:28:58,735
And the whole gossip goes into our mind and
that's how we work out.

628
02:28:58,735 --> 02:29:04,965
So for this part, I would request all the
people from the north India to never to listen

629
02:29:04,965 --> 02:29:09,236
any criticism, never to criticize anyone.

630
02:29:09,236 --> 02:29:11,255
What is the use?

631
02:29:11,255 --> 02:29:17,146
Just see logically: if you listen to somebody's
criticism, what is the use?

632
02:29:17,146 --> 02:29:19,826
What do you gain out of it?

633
02:29:19,826 --> 02:29:25,446
Now by repeating it to somebody else, what
do you gain?

634
02:29:25,446 --> 02:29:26,446
What is the gain?

635
02:29:26,446 --> 02:29:32,126
Simple thing, always ask the question: What
is the gain?

636
02:29:32,126 --> 02:29:35,816
And why to see something wrong with others?

637
02:29:35,816 --> 02:29:38,816
I know by that you can be cheated.

638
02:29:38,816 --> 02:29:42,275
Somebody can deceive you, is true.

639
02:29:42,275 --> 02:29:44,416
But doesn't matter.

640
02:29:44,416 --> 02:29:46,816
You don't get anything into your head.

641
02:29:46,816 --> 02:29:50,975
You don't get any filth and any poison in
your head.

642
02:29:50,975 --> 02:29:57,025
I know there are people who create problem,
talk from one to another, do this, do that.

643
02:29:57,025 --> 02:30:03,305
But that should not harm you in anyway because
you have the spirit and the spirit cannot

644
02:30:03,305 --> 02:30:04,305
be harmed.

645
02:30:04,305 --> 02:30:05,316
It cannot be destroyed.

646
02:30:05,316 --> 02:30:09,586
It is said that, "It cannot be destroyed by
any weapon.

647
02:30:09,586 --> 02:30:12,255
It lives and lives forever."

648
02:30:12,255 --> 02:30:20,316
So the attention towards the atma is lacking,
atma vimukta.

649
02:30:20,316 --> 02:30:30,225
We, our eyes have gone, our attention is gone
to something away from the spirit and that's

650
02:30:30,225 --> 02:30:32,696
why all the problems are there.

651
02:30:32,696 --> 02:30:39,896
Once you are one with your spirit, it works.

652
02:30:39,896 --> 02:30:46,106
It works for you because it is in connection
with the God almighty.

653
02:30:46,106 --> 02:30:53,926
It is in connection with the all pervading
power, which works out everything.

654
02:30:53,926 --> 02:30:56,015
I know this all pervading power.

655
02:30:56,015 --> 02:31:01,116
It has showing so many miraculous photographs
about Me.

656
02:31:01,116 --> 02:31:05,196
And actually I, I didn't ask It but It is
doing.

657
02:31:05,196 --> 02:31:07,326
Because very active, It is very active.

658
02:31:07,326 --> 02:31:12,765
And if It sees anybody who is subtle and who
is deep, It acts.

659
02:31:12,765 --> 02:31:19,636
In your business, in your politics, in your
family in everywhere you'll find this light

660
02:31:19,636 --> 02:31:29,726
will shine and you'll respect, respect the
hearts of a person.

661
02:31:29,726 --> 02:31:32,406
You'll respect the love of others.

662
02:31:32,406 --> 02:31:37,616
You will respect the spirit that is shining
in others.

663
02:31:37,616 --> 02:31:44,846
This is the reason why you have learned to
respect each other, because your spirit is

664
02:31:44,846 --> 02:31:45,846
enlightened.

665
02:31:45,846 --> 02:31:46,846
I can see it so clearly.

666
02:31:46,846 --> 02:31:53,136
I am so very happy to see so many of you here
for My birthday.

667
02:31:53,136 --> 02:31:59,676
I don't know what is the significance of a
birthday is but whatever it is, it is one

668
02:31:59,676 --> 02:32:06,106
of the things that I can meet you, all of
you here, so very happy.

669
02:32:06,106 --> 02:32:11,525
I am thankful to these people who are elites
of our society.

670
02:32:11,525 --> 02:32:19,436
They are very great people elected and sometimes
given very high positions and also there are

671
02:32:19,436 --> 02:32:21,265
some very well known industrialists.

672
02:32:21,265 --> 02:32:29,116
All of them have to understand the value of
sprititual life.

673
02:32:29,116 --> 02:32:31,966
It's very important for them.

674
02:32:31,966 --> 02:32:41,555
Not to avoid this point but to be one with
your spirit is your own property, is in your

675
02:32:41,555 --> 02:32:50,126
own, I should say, the complete glory that
you have is to be the spirit.

676
02:32:50,126 --> 02:32:56,735
With all this, I don't know how to thank you
all and how to thank all these people who

677
02:32:56,735 --> 02:32:59,386
spoke so nicely.

678
02:32:59,386 --> 02:33:06,846
Only thing, I wish you all a great growth
in your spiritual life atmonnati, into your

679
02:33:06,846 --> 02:33:15,596
spirituality so that it covers all the corners
of the world and create a beautiful world

680
02:33:15,596 --> 02:33:16,596
of tomorrow.

681
02:33:16,596 --> 02:33:18,326
May God bless you!
