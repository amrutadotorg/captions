00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.200
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

00:09:35.534 --> 00:09:41.659
to this great country of yoga.

00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:54.950
Today first of all we have to establish

00:09:56.617 --> 00:10:02.200
our desire within ourselves

00:10:02.283 --> 00:10:04.950
that we are seekers

00:10:05.033 --> 00:10:12.200
and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:19.200
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

00:10:19.866 --> 00:10:24.783
The whole universe

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:29.700
should be enlightened with your desires.

00:10:30.117 --> 00:10:34.033
Your desires should be so intense

00:10:34.117 --> 00:10:38.450
that they should emit out

00:10:38.534 --> 00:10:44.117
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.283
which is the pure desire

00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:53.700
of attaining the spirit.

00:10:53.866 --> 00:10:56.367
That's the real desire.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:03.699
All the other desires are like mirage.

00:11:07.117 --> 00:11:15.699
You are the people who are chosen by God.

00:11:17.783 --> 00:11:25.783
Specially, first to express your desire,

00:11:25.866 --> 00:11:29.700
and then to achieve it.

00:11:29.866 --> 00:11:41.450
And by intense desire of purity

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:46.200
you have to purify the whole world.

00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:48.450
Not only the seekers,

00:11:48.534 --> 00:11:52.783
but even those who are not seekers.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:05.534
You have to create an aura around this universe,

00:12:05.617 --> 00:12:13.534
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

00:12:13.617 --> 00:12:17.033
the spirit.

00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:29.117
Without desire this universe would not have been created.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:41.200
This Desire of God is the one that is the Holy Ghost,

00:12:41.367 --> 00:12:45.367
is this all-pervading power,

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:50.450
is the Kundalini within you.

00:12:51.033 --> 00:12:54.700
Kundalini has only one desire,

00:12:54.866 --> 00:12:58.283
is to be the spirit

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:03.283
and anything else if you desire

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.450
the Kundalini doesn't rise.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.950
Only when it knows

00:13:11.033 --> 00:13:17.617
that this desire is going to be fulfilled

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:28.617
by somebody, who is facing the seeker,

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.283
it is awakened.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:40.950
If you do not have the desire,

00:13:41.033 --> 00:13:43.950
no-one can force you.

00:13:44.033 --> 00:13:46.450
Sahaja Yogis should never try

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:51.783
to force this desire on other people.

00:13:51.866 --> 00:13:54.450
The first ordeal we face,

00:13:54.534 --> 00:13:58.033
as soon as you get your Realization,

00:13:58.117 --> 00:14:03.700
is that you just start thinking of your family.

00:14:04.783 --> 00:14:08.367
You start thinking: 'My mother has not got it,

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.699
my father has not got it,

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.367
my wife has not got it,

00:14:14.534 --> 00:14:18.699
my children have not got it.'

00:14:21.117 --> 00:14:27.617
You must know that these relations are worldly.

00:14:27.699 --> 00:14:29.866
Sanskrit is loukik.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.450
They are not aloukik,

00:14:32.534 --> 00:14:36.450
they are not beyond the worldly relationships.

00:14:36.617 --> 00:14:38.699
These are worldly relations,

00:14:38.783 --> 00:14:41.950
and these attachments are worldly.

00:14:42.033 --> 00:14:46.950
So if you play into that of course as you know,

00:14:47.033 --> 00:14:50.367
that Mahamaya Shakti allows you to play with that.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.617
You go ahead, as long as you like.

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:57.200
People bring Me all their relations,

00:14:57.283 --> 00:14:59.450
parents, this and that

00:14:59.534 --> 00:15:01.950
and ultimately they discover

00:15:02.117 --> 00:15:07.283
that this was a very wrong thing they did.

00:15:07.367 --> 00:15:14.283
They lost so many precious moments,

00:15:14.367 --> 00:15:16.950
so many hours, so many years,

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:19.866
wasting their energy on people

00:15:20.033 --> 00:15:25.033
who never deserved any attention of Mother.

00:15:25.367 --> 00:15:31.534
Sooner you realize the better that this desire

00:15:31.866 --> 00:15:36.783
may be within you,

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:42.534
and may not be in anyone of your so-called worldly relations.

00:15:42.699 --> 00:15:47.450
Makes no difference.

00:15:47.866 --> 00:15:49.866
As Christ was told

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.783
that His brothers and sisters are waiting outside,

00:15:53.866 --> 00:16:00.283
He said: 'Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?'

00:16:02.283 --> 00:16:06.367
So one has to realize that those people who involve themselves

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.783
into the problems of their family all the time,

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.866
and attract My attention,

00:16:13.033 --> 00:16:16.700
you must know that I am just playing about.

00:16:16.783 --> 00:16:20.783
It is of no value to you.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.450
For your ascent it is important first of all

00:16:24.534 --> 00:16:26.783
to have no desires

00:16:26.866 --> 00:16:31.950
to create desire in your kith and kin.

00:16:32.699 --> 00:16:36.950
This is the first principle of establishment

00:16:37.117 --> 00:16:41.117
of Mahakali Power.

00:16:43.783 --> 00:16:46.866
Specially in India

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.534
where people are too much attached to their family,

00:16:50.617 --> 00:16:54.367
it's a very big problem.

00:16:54.617 --> 00:16:57.783
If you give Realization to one person,

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:02.534
you are amazed to see that all relationship they have

00:17:02.617 --> 00:17:06.117
is with a big bunch of bhoots.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:12.367
And once you give Realization to one person you are in for trouble.

00:17:12.534 --> 00:17:16.617
Then all the bhoots walk in, slowly,

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:20.283
torturing My life, wasting My energy,

00:17:20.367 --> 00:17:24.033
and absolutely disgusting.

00:17:24.617 --> 00:17:27.367
It should happen to you to understand

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.534
that this is not auspicious.

00:17:30.617 --> 00:17:33.200
If you want to waste your time,

00:17:33.283 --> 00:17:37.117
I will allow you to waste your time.

00:17:37.367 --> 00:17:43.450
But if you want to have the ascent fast,

00:17:43.534 --> 00:17:45.699
first of all one must remember

00:17:45.783 --> 00:17:50.700
that these are relations which are absolutely worldly relations

00:17:50.783 --> 00:17:54.700
and this is not your pure desire.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.534
So try to separate your pure desire

00:17:59.617 --> 00:18:03.783
from your worldly desires.

00:18:04.617 --> 00:18:08.283
It does not by any means,

00:18:08.534 --> 00:18:13.117
suggest that you give up your family,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.699
you give up your mother or give up your sister - nothing.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.033
But you witness them

00:18:20.117 --> 00:18:26.200
and see, as you would see anybody else,

00:18:27.534 --> 00:18:31.699
and see for yourself, whether

00:18:31.783 --> 00:18:35.699
they are really desirous or not.

00:18:35.783 --> 00:18:37.450
If they are - well and good.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:41.117
They should not be disqualified because they are your relations.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.033
It works both ways.

00:18:43.117 --> 00:18:46.783
As they cannot be qualified because they are your relations,

00:18:46.866 --> 00:18:52.117
they cannot be disqualified because they're your relations.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:19:00.367
So in Sahaja Yoga to make your desire a pure desire,

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:07.699
you have to get out of so many things.

00:19:07.783 --> 00:19:12.283
But for people who are attached to their family,

00:19:12.534 --> 00:19:16.033
are bound by their family,

00:19:16.283 --> 00:19:18.200
they have to see to it

00:19:18.367 --> 00:19:22.200
that they do not force Sahaja Yoga on anyone of their relations,

00:19:22.283 --> 00:19:26.283
at least don't force them on Me.

00:20:34.242 --> 00:20:40.409
Now this desire within us,

00:20:41.242 --> 00:20:44.908
which is the Mahakali Power which is manifesting,

00:20:44.991 --> 00:20:48.367
comes to us in so many ways.

00:20:48.492 --> 00:20:50.908
As I told you first of all,

00:20:50.991 --> 00:20:53.450
it comes to us after Realization,

00:20:53.575 --> 00:20:55.825
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:01.409
to do something about our relations.

00:21:01.617 --> 00:21:04.866
Then the second desire that comes to us,

00:21:05.117 --> 00:21:09.991
that let us try to cure people,

00:21:10.075 --> 00:21:14.617
who are our relations.

00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:17.075
This is the second desire,

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.617
you should face yourself and see,

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.825
that this has happened to many of you.

00:21:21.908 --> 00:21:27.450
So, right from leprosy

00:21:27.699 --> 00:21:32.825
to any small thing like cold or sneezing,

00:21:32.908 --> 00:21:35.158
whatever they have,

00:21:35.409 --> 00:21:41.117
you think you should bring to Mother.

00:21:42.908 --> 00:21:48.409
And all the worries of your families should be brought to Mother.

00:21:48.534 --> 00:21:52.950
Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing,

00:21:53.158 --> 00:21:58.158
very simple things - which are so natural

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:05.409
are brought into your attention.

00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:08.866
So when you have them in your attention I say:

00:22:08.991 --> 00:22:14.325
'All right, go ahead with it. Try to solve it, if possible.'

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.075
But if you do not have them in your attention

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.117
they are in My attention.

00:22:23.325 --> 00:22:28.033
You leave them in My attention, I'll manage that.

00:22:28.117 --> 00:22:32.158
But then it's a vicious circle.

00:22:32.825 --> 00:22:36.825
It's a very subtle projection of the mind

00:22:36.908 --> 00:22:38.700
that thinks: 'All right,

00:22:38.783 --> 00:22:40.908
that Mother we don't have this in our attention,

00:22:40.991 --> 00:22:46.741
You'd better look after it." That's not the way.

00:22:46.825 --> 00:22:51.741
You should have only one intense desire within yourself:

00:22:51.825 --> 00:22:55.534
"Have I become the spirit?

00:22:55.908 --> 00:22:59.741
Have I achieved my ultimate?

00:22:59.866 --> 00:23:04.699
Have I risen above the worldly desires?"

00:23:04.741 --> 00:23:07.741
Purify it.

00:23:10.033 --> 00:23:13.575
Once you start purifying whatever falls off,

00:23:13.699 --> 00:23:16.825
I'll look after that.

00:23:16.908 --> 00:23:22.825
This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee.

00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:31.325
If it deserves My attention I will definitely look after you.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:40.534
You have to value your attention as I value My attention.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.950
I think you have to value much more of your attention

00:23:49.991 --> 00:23:54.699
than Me, because I can manage,

00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:56.534
many more things within Myself,

00:23:56.659 --> 00:24:02.117
because everything is in My attention.

00:24:03.075 --> 00:24:08.075
But you try to purify your desires,

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.200
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

00:24:13.325 --> 00:24:17.200
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

00:24:17.325 --> 00:24:24.492
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

00:24:27.908 --> 00:24:31.492
All right, give Me the map of your country - finished.

00:24:31.575 --> 00:24:35.158
That's more than sufficient.

00:24:38.699 --> 00:24:42.783
Then purify yourself.

00:24:42.908 --> 00:24:47.991
The desire that you have, you leave it.

00:24:48.117 --> 00:24:49.699
And once you are purified

00:24:49.783 --> 00:24:52.825
that area will be covered through your attention,

00:24:52.908 --> 00:24:56.825
it's very interesting.

00:24:56.908 --> 00:25:03.617
When you get over it then only you can throw light,

00:25:04.283 --> 00:25:06.908
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

00:25:07.033 --> 00:25:10.575
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

00:25:10.699 --> 00:25:13.450
You all rise above that desire.

00:25:13.575 --> 00:25:16.534
Every time you get a desire you rise above it,

00:25:16.659 --> 00:25:21.367
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

00:25:21.492 --> 00:25:23.242
that you are facing

00:25:23.367 --> 00:25:28.699
which you think should be solved by Me.

00:25:29.575 --> 00:25:34.659
These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.991
You have to do only one thing is to become the spirit

00:25:38.117 --> 00:25:40.659
that's all. Is a simple thing.

00:25:40.741 --> 00:25:45.200
The rest of it is My headache.

00:25:47.117 --> 00:25:53.575
Now the problems

00:25:53.659 --> 00:26:00.659
that should take your desire on the collective

00:26:00.741 --> 00:26:08.492
should be very different.

00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:14.367
To substantiate your purity,

00:26:14.617 --> 00:26:19.617
to be fragrant with your purity,

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.991
your attention should be on the other side.

00:26:23.075 --> 00:26:24.783
Now you are not facing Me,

00:26:24.866 --> 00:26:27.033
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

00:26:27.117 --> 00:26:32.450
See, the whole attitude will change.

00:26:32.534 --> 00:26:37.825
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:41.283
How can I give?

00:26:41.409 --> 00:26:44.699
What is my mistake in giving?

00:26:44.783 --> 00:26:47.325
I have to be more alert.

00:26:47.409 --> 00:26:51.741
Where is my attention?

00:26:51.991 --> 00:26:54.242
I have to be more alert towards myself

00:26:54.325 --> 00:26:58.617
what am I doing?

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:03.741
What's my responsibility?'

00:27:05.741 --> 00:27:11.700
You must desire that you should be pure.

00:27:11.783 --> 00:27:14.950
You should be pure desire.

00:27:15.075 --> 00:27:18.783
That means you should be the spirit.

00:27:18.908 --> 00:27:23.825
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:30.075
You should desire that your responsibility to yourself

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.908
should be manifested,

00:27:34.033 --> 00:27:38.492
should be complete.

00:27:38.575 --> 00:27:44.283
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:44.367 --> 00:27:48.283
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:48.367 --> 00:27:50.825
which is the work of God,

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:57.367
which has started and you are My hands.

00:27:59.117 --> 00:28:03.242
You have to do the work of God,

00:28:03.367 --> 00:28:07.700
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

00:28:07.825 --> 00:28:10.200
the satanic elements.

00:28:10.409 --> 00:28:12.825
You are not responsible for your family any more,

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.575
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

00:28:16.699 --> 00:28:20.367
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

00:28:20.492 --> 00:28:23.200
All such will drop out, their families will suffer,

00:28:23.283 --> 00:28:25.866
I know this is going to happen.

00:28:25.991 --> 00:28:28.367
Because now the forces are gathering in such a way

00:28:28.492 --> 00:28:32.117
that sorting out will start.

00:28:32.242 --> 00:28:37.617
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the spirit,

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:43.825
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:44.699 --> 00:28:48.991
your responsibility to understand Me,

00:28:49.117 --> 00:28:53.659
better and better and better.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.741
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

00:28:56.825 --> 00:28:59.825
that is within you,

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:04.033
your responsibility to understand how this mechanism

00:29:04.158 --> 00:29:08.700
works out everything.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:14.699
The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself.

00:29:15.617 --> 00:29:21.158
Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality.

00:29:21.283 --> 00:29:23.950
A responsibility to be a respectable person

00:29:24.075 --> 00:29:28.825
and not a cheap personality.

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:31.950
Every one of you

00:29:32.033 --> 00:29:39.242
is worth the whole universe.

00:29:40.659 --> 00:29:45.450
If you want to rise to that height.

00:29:46.825 --> 00:29:53.117
Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet.

00:29:53.659 --> 00:29:56.200
If you want to rise to that height,

00:29:56.283 --> 00:30:02.325
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

00:30:04.409 --> 00:30:06.908
But those people,

00:30:07.033 --> 00:30:16.950
who still want to live on a very low level cannot rise.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.325
For example,

00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:26.117
the western Sahaja Yogis have certain problems

00:30:28.033 --> 00:30:34.492
of committing the sin against the Mother,

00:30:34.617 --> 00:30:37.659
and the eastern Sahaja Yogis have the problem

00:30:37.741 --> 00:30:42.450
of committing sin against the Father.

00:30:43.534 --> 00:30:49.450
It's not difficult at all

00:30:50.825 --> 00:30:55.741
for you to get out of it.

00:31:02.492 --> 00:31:10.575
The attention is to be kept pure.

00:31:10.783 --> 00:31:15.617
In Sahaja Yoga you know all the methods

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.991
how the attention one can keep it pure.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.242
If the attention is not pure

00:31:23.367 --> 00:31:26.450
then this desire

00:31:26.575 --> 00:31:31.242
will be always attacked

00:31:31.367 --> 00:31:34.283
by all petty nonsensical things

00:31:34.409 --> 00:31:38.367
which has no meaning in your ascent.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.409
Now a person who is a good Sahaja Yogi

00:31:41.534 --> 00:31:44.117
is not bothered about clothes, what others say to him

00:31:44.242 --> 00:31:46.367
or what others are talking to him,

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.283
how they are behaving towards him and

00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:52.158
the attention is not on that

00:31:52.283 --> 00:31:57.325
criticism that this person is like this, that person is like that.

00:31:57.409 --> 00:32:03.200
Nor there is the aggressiveness

00:32:05.409 --> 00:32:09.367
of anyone else,

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:12.409
because nobody is the other.

00:32:12.534 --> 00:32:17.283
But the problem is when I say that,

00:32:17.534 --> 00:32:23.325
no-one thinks that I'm saying about you, each persons.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:27.825
Those who are aggressive take the other role

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:34.450
and those who are non-aggressive think the other way.

00:32:34.866 --> 00:32:38.783
Like I say something for a person who is aggressive,

00:32:38.866 --> 00:32:42.242
the non-aggressive immediately thinks of the person who is aggressive,

00:32:42.325 --> 00:32:45.825
not about himself.

00:32:45.908 --> 00:32:49.033
You immediately start shifting your mind to other person,

00:32:49.117 --> 00:32:53.699
finding faults with other people.

00:32:56.117 --> 00:32:59.991
So this desire becomes

00:33:00.117 --> 00:33:05.825
gradually lower and lower and lower

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:10.991
because of the loads that are put onto it.

00:33:11.117 --> 00:33:14.492
So the alertness is very important,

00:33:14.617 --> 00:33:19.617
complete alertness - satarkata,

00:33:19.699 --> 00:33:24.741
that we should keep our attention

00:33:24.825 --> 00:33:32.659
purely for the sustenance of our pure desire.

00:33:34.367 --> 00:33:38.700
Desire comes from your heart

00:33:38.825 --> 00:33:40.575
and you are so built

00:33:40.659 --> 00:33:45.158
that your brahmarandra is also the heart.

00:33:45.283 --> 00:33:48.242
If you don't have a clean heart,

00:33:48.325 --> 00:33:52.700
this won't keep clean.

00:33:52.783 --> 00:33:55.492
There are people

00:33:55.617 --> 00:33:58.325
who think if they talk about Sahaja Yoga big,

00:33:58.409 --> 00:34:01.492
and all that, they are all right.

00:34:01.575 --> 00:34:05.033
They are cheating themselves.

00:34:05.283 --> 00:34:09.033
If the heart is not open

00:34:09.158 --> 00:34:12.699
then this is closed.

00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:18.991
So try to open your heart by projecting.

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:28.117
Projecting it.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:32.242
I hope today when you do this puja

00:34:32.367 --> 00:34:36.409
and you do the worship of Mahakali

00:34:36.534 --> 00:34:41.450
and this special yagya,

00:34:41.575 --> 00:34:46.242
we will definitely establish this aura,

00:34:46.367 --> 00:34:51.117
and enlighten the universe.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.033
But your outlook should be:

00:34:53.158 --> 00:34:58.158
'How much I have contributed to this.

00:34:59.075 --> 00:35:02.409
Am I still thinking of other people,

00:35:02.534 --> 00:35:07.617
am I still thinking of my petty small problems,

00:35:07.699 --> 00:35:13.950
or I'm thinking of my spirit?'

00:35:15.659 --> 00:35:20.991
So, the left side

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:28.325
starts and ends with Shri Ganesh.

00:35:28.409 --> 00:35:34.741
Shri Ganesh has only basic one quality,

00:35:34.825 --> 00:35:37.700
that He's completely surrendered to His Mother,

00:35:37.783 --> 00:35:41.492
He does not know any other God,

00:35:41.617 --> 00:35:45.242
He does not even know His Father.

00:35:45.783 --> 00:35:47.950
He only knows His Mother

00:35:48.075 --> 00:35:54.534
and completely surrendered to Her.

00:35:58.075 --> 00:36:04.200
But this pure desire has to have the action,

00:36:04.825 --> 00:36:06.908
and about which I'll tell you later

00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:11.575
as we will be having more pujas and more pujas.

00:36:11.659 --> 00:36:17.492
But today let us establish ourselves

00:36:18.534 --> 00:36:25.575
into that pure desire, to be the spirit.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:33.741
Now, as it is, with the western mind we'll say: 'How?'

00:36:36.117 --> 00:36:41.242
Is always coming, "How to do it?"

00:36:41.325 --> 00:36:47.991
Should I tell you? It's very simple.

00:36:48.117 --> 00:36:52.991
Adi Shankaracharya wrote 'Viveka Chudamani'

00:36:53.117 --> 00:36:57.575
and so many other books of treaties,

00:36:57.659 --> 00:37:04.200
and then all these big intellectuals got after his life.

00:37:04.283 --> 00:37:06.575
And they said:

00:37:06.699 --> 00:37:09.783
'How this and how that and how?'

00:37:09.866 --> 00:37:12.367
He said: 'Forget these people.'

00:37:12.492 --> 00:37:17.158
Then he wrote 'Saundarya Lahari',

00:37:17.242 --> 00:37:19.367
it's just a description of his Mother

00:37:19.575 --> 00:37:21.908
and his devotion to Her

00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:31.409
and every couplet that He wrote is a mantra.

00:37:32.033 --> 00:37:33.783
It is not the surrender

00:37:33.866 --> 00:37:39.783
of your mind through your mind,

00:37:39.908 --> 00:37:45.659
but the surrender of your heart.

00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:52.617
Is absolutely the surrender of your heart.

00:37:52.699 --> 00:37:56.659
Western Sahaja Yogis know very well

00:37:56.825 --> 00:38:00.200
how there have been attacks

00:38:00.283 --> 00:38:04.200
and attacks of negativity on them,

00:38:04.367 --> 00:38:10.866
specially when horrible people like Freud

00:38:11.409 --> 00:38:18.825
came to destroy their basic, the roots.

00:38:18.908 --> 00:38:24.200
And how the West accepted it blindfolded,

00:38:24.325 --> 00:38:29.367
and put them on the path of hell.

00:38:29.492 --> 00:38:33.200
All that has to be brought out.

00:38:33.325 --> 00:38:37.492
That is all nonsense, is wrong, absolutely

00:38:37.617 --> 00:38:42.450
against God, it's anti-God activity.

00:38:42.659 --> 00:38:45.991
Then you will realize

00:38:46.117 --> 00:38:54.492
that you will fight fully, by saying,

00:38:54.617 --> 00:39:01.283
"This is the destruction of our basics, our roots,

00:39:01.409 --> 00:39:02.825
when our Mother is the source

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:07.700
of everything that is sublime, noble,

00:39:08.117 --> 00:39:11.075
all that is nourishing,

00:39:11.158 --> 00:39:16.700
all that is elevating, emancipating.

00:39:16.783 --> 00:39:20.325
You have cutting us from our roots.

00:39:20.409 --> 00:39:25.908
"When he dealt with, I think, animal-like creatures

00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:33.158
and he wants all of you to go down to that low level

00:39:33.283 --> 00:39:36.866
of human beings,

00:39:36.991 --> 00:39:45.033
which exist as pathological cases, I don't know.

00:39:45.158 --> 00:39:48.700
So it is important for you to understand all the attacks

00:39:48.825 --> 00:39:50.409
that came on you,

00:39:50.492 --> 00:39:51.991
and be alert

00:39:52.075 --> 00:39:57.699
and don't be identified with anyone of these.

00:39:57.741 --> 00:40:01.117
Last I would say you have come to this country

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.659
to see the roots and not the shoot.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.075
Change your attitude of western style.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.575
Telephones are no good.

00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:14.075
You cannot get any telephones done here.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.325
Postage is horrible.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.450
Railways are worst.

00:40:19.575 --> 00:40:25.700
I shouldn't say because we are in a railway.

00:40:30.659 --> 00:40:37.825
But, the people are excellent.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:39.783
They know what is dharma.

00:40:39.908 --> 00:40:41.700
They are not being attacked, somehow or other

00:40:41.825 --> 00:40:43.699
because it being the Kundalini.

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:49.367
The Ganesha is sitting here how dare anybody attack?

00:40:49.575 --> 00:40:53.825
This great Maharashtra has got eight Ganeshas,

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:55.033
protecting them.

00:40:55.117 --> 00:40:59.117
I don't know if these Maharashtrians know this fact.

00:40:59.242 --> 00:41:01.575
And so many marutis,

00:41:01.699 --> 00:41:04.325
so who can attack this country?

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:05.700
There is no negative attack

00:41:05.825 --> 00:41:11.117
except that they themselves are rather money-minded sort.

00:41:11.242 --> 00:41:14.283
That's the only curse they have, if they can get out of it

00:41:14.367 --> 00:41:18.200
they are great people.

00:41:21.242 --> 00:41:28.117
So, we have come to this country not to enjoy the comfort

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:33.492
of the West, but the comfort of the spirit.

00:41:33.617 --> 00:41:39.033
So to change your attitude towards India

00:41:39.117 --> 00:41:44.450
I don't mean Air India, by any chance.

00:41:44.534 --> 00:41:47.325
This is a wrong idea that you come by Air India

00:41:47.409 --> 00:41:49.908
because you are a Sahaja Yogi. Not at all.

00:41:49.991 --> 00:41:52.991
Air India is nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:53.117 --> 00:41:55.492
All our railways, all our everything,

00:41:55.575 --> 00:41:57.534
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:57.617 --> 00:41:59.950
so far.

00:42:02.409 --> 00:42:06.492
So you be patriotic and use your own airlines,

00:42:06.617 --> 00:42:10.075
for heaven's sake.

00:42:11.325 --> 00:42:13.825
But when you arrive here

00:42:13.908 --> 00:42:16.950
you will see that the people are too innocent,

00:42:17.075 --> 00:42:19.534
they can't understand Freud, you can't talk to them,

00:42:19.617 --> 00:42:22.242
it's beyond them.

00:42:22.367 --> 00:42:24.700
They are a higher type of people in this respect

00:42:24.825 --> 00:42:26.991
now because they are not attacked,

00:42:27.117 --> 00:42:29.783
while you are higher in a way that though you are attacked

00:42:29.866 --> 00:42:33.283
you've come out of it.

00:42:33.409 --> 00:42:36.825
You just turn your faces and you are on the other way.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:42.033
That's something great.

00:42:42.158 --> 00:42:44.783
So you would also have a confidence

00:42:44.908 --> 00:42:47.950
there are many people who believe the same way as you believe,

00:42:48.033 --> 00:42:53.492
in this big country where there's such a big population to support you.

00:42:53.617 --> 00:42:58.699
So you shouldn't feel lost.

00:42:59.783 --> 00:43:04.492
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

00:43:04.617 --> 00:43:08.409
on Mahakali Day.

00:43:08.492 --> 00:43:12.825
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:16.033
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

00:43:16.158 --> 00:43:22.659
though according to the schedule time it may not be.

00:43:22.741 --> 00:43:24.575
But according to Me,

00:43:24.659 --> 00:43:29.158
let us establish within ourself on a subtler level

00:43:29.283 --> 00:43:35.033
the desire to be pure,

00:43:38.283 --> 00:43:42.409
and to be cleansed out.

00:43:42.492 --> 00:43:49.741
All the barriers and unclean things that are within us,

00:43:50.325 --> 00:43:54.991
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

00:43:55.117 --> 00:44:01.700
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

00:44:01.783 --> 00:44:06.699
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:08.783
It's not difficult.

00:44:08.866 --> 00:44:11.908
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

00:44:11.991 --> 00:44:13.991
because what you surrender,

00:44:14.117 --> 00:44:17.075
I don't want anything from you,

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:22.242
except that you accept My Love.

00:44:22.367 --> 00:44:27.242
Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love.

00:44:27.367 --> 00:44:30.200
Give up this ego.

00:44:30.325 --> 00:44:33.534
That's all and it will work out.

00:44:33.617 --> 00:44:37.825
I'm sure it's going to work out.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:41.325
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:45.367
and I'll definitely settle down there.

01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:47.492
Mahakali has a special capacity to weep,

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.741
because She is left-sided.

01:09:49.825 --> 01:09:52.242
When She's helpless and She cannot act,

01:09:52.367 --> 01:09:55.117
She weeps.

01:09:55.242 --> 01:09:57.409
This is the only manifestation

01:09:57.534 --> 01:10:00.617
of Mahakali is that She desires,

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:04.117
and if She doesn't get Her desire enacted

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.617
then She just weeps,

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:08.825
that's the only thing She can do in helplessness, isn't it.

01:10:08.991 --> 01:10:13.242
And sometimes when She's full of Love

01:10:13.325 --> 01:10:16.367
as I've seen you today all of you coming down here

01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:19.492
and all these people sitting down here.

01:10:19.617 --> 01:10:22.575
When She cannot express Herself fully,

01:10:22.699 --> 01:10:24.741
with full heart,

01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:35.075
also She feels that joy pouring as tears.

01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:37.367
May God bless you for today's puja,

01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:41.075
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.700
that the subtlest of subtle

01:10:43.825 --> 01:10:46.367
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:50.492
every way, and the Love,

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.783
which culminates into joy.

01:10:53.866 --> 01:11:00.200
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

01:11:00.325 --> 01:11:05.492
will manifest in today's puja.

01:11:05.575 --> 01:11:08.409
May God bless you!
