00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.683
Finding faults with others is a very nice thing, very easy also

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.602
but find out faults within yourself.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.158
What are these things that are strangling us?

00:00:25.832 --> 00:00:32.931
This is the best way of improving your awareness.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.471
Like you are going in the car and you have to know the road,

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:45.880
you have to know how you are driving,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.361
you have to see what are the problems.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.455
But instead of you think, oh, no end of yourself

00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:56.971
– it won’t work out.

00:00:57.348 --> 00:01:03.056
Today is a day of very great happening, I should say.

00:01:03.198 --> 00:01:08.791
Celebrating the Diwali is a very, very

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.156
joyous thing.

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:21.718
But this joy is not for ourselves;

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.520
this joy is for the whole world.

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:28.346
We have to work for the whole world.

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:34.820
We work for ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, whatever it is,

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:39.913
but what are you doing for others?

00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:43.411
That you should see for yourself,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.306
that’s very important.

00:01:46.427 --> 00:01:51.783
Only such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga

00:01:52.537 --> 00:01:57.093
because they have concern, they have care,

00:01:57.237 --> 00:02:00.530
and they are doing something for others.

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:07.570
It’s a great enjoyment with that, when the lights are burning,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.549
it’s to give you happiness; they are burning their bodies

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.520
to give you happiness. They are the ones who should teach us

00:02:18.643 --> 00:02:22.184
that we have to do something ourselves

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:27.708
to enjoy our own higher awareness.

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:36.376
All this will work out, I am sure. I am also trying My best

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.399
to make this light unshaky

00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:51.008
and full of enthusiasm.

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:57.505
It’s there. It is you who are

00:02:58.316 --> 00:03:02.796
anxious to fill your pitchers.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.524
You can do it.

00:03:08.324 --> 00:03:12.564
It’s not My anxiety that’s going to help you.

00:03:13.954 --> 00:03:18.438
So you’ll start, and even if you want to have

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:24.375
complete picture about yourself,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.440
you have to first give up identification with yourself;

00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:36.878
otherwise you’ll never know what’s wrong with you.

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:41.825
If you are too much identified with you, you cannot come up.

00:03:43.853 --> 00:03:48.173
Now as it is, what is the aim after all,

00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:52.025
what is the aim of our lives?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.080
We have to change the whole world into a peaceful theme.

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.416
Changing yourself, of course, is great thing, no doubt;

00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:14.937
but changing others also will stop all the problems of the world.

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:19.706
If all the people of this world become good people, Sahaja yogis,

00:04:20.698 --> 00:04:23.561
then can you imagine what will happen?

00:04:23.682 --> 00:04:26.385
Think of that dream I have,

00:04:26.634 --> 00:04:33.474
that we have to change each and every person that we can change,

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:38.521
and we have to transform them into good people.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.560
If they are not transformed

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.510
they are like a candle without any flame in it.

00:04:44.707 --> 00:04:50.010
And if they are capable of getting transformed,

00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:57.651
we should try all methods, all the tricks to do that.

00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:03.057
I’m sure very soon such a day will come when you will say,

00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:06.577
“Mother, now we are very safe.”

00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:13.760
Don’t think of the past and the problems of the past

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.400
– you have now overcome it.

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:21.639
Just enjoy yourself and have faith in yourself,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.400
and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen,

00:05:28.753 --> 00:05:35.353
very quickly it will happen. It is your desire, also

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.560
your method of working it out,

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:44.034
your anxiety to work it out.

00:05:44.452 --> 00:05:49.662
Main anxiety should be, “How can I transform this person?”

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.623
You can transform anyone.

00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:58.255
You know, you tell one person, another person follows it.

00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:00.541
Like when we came in the plane,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.640
I found at the airport so many people

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.480
had put up their hands towards Me like this.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.040
I said, “Who are these people?” They were not Sahaja yogis.

00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:17.712
They had seen somebody, or what had happened I couldn’t ask them,

00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:21.143
but all of them said, “We are feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

00:06:22.102 --> 00:06:24.022
” They didn’t know anything about it,

00:06:24.143 --> 00:06:26.501
they didn’t know about kundalini, nothing.

00:06:26.622 --> 00:06:28.622
Then what is this cool coming?

00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:35.008
That basically they are there to get their realization,

00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:38.298
only we have to extend our ideals,

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.633
we have to extend our love to them.

00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:47.516
Instead of getting annoyed with them,

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:50.673
better is to give them a chance

00:06:51.508 --> 00:06:57.985
and you’ll be amazed that they are very anxious to get transformed.

00:06:58.176 --> 00:07:04.016
They’re all fed up with all the artificial things they’re having.

00:07:04.137 --> 00:07:07.743
It’s over now. You will be amazed

00:07:07.864 --> 00:07:13.321
how many are waiting there for you to give them Self-realization

00:07:13.442 --> 00:07:18.923
and let them celebrate their Diwali with you, enjoy the Diwali.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.930
Diwali you cannot celebrate with one candle.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.800
You have to have more and more of candles,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.391
and that’s what is your job.
