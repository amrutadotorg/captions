WEBVTT

06:23.026 --> 06:29.275
Today we have gathered here to do
Guru puja.

06:30.962 --> 06:34.237
This system started long time back
in India,

06:34.438 --> 06:39.420
I think even at the time of Patanjali,

06:39.621 --> 06:45.904
maybe even earlier, when there were
great seekers.

06:46.105 --> 06:52.500
And their gurus were sitting
in the jungles, where they used to get

06:54.034 --> 06:58.928
permission to go there and then
they would get their realisation,

06:59.129 --> 07:02.000
very few of them, one or two.

07:02.201 --> 07:08.641
So we had many rishis and munis
in the olden times in India.

07:08.842 --> 07:12.642
So this system of guru started.

07:13.251 --> 07:21.209
Also one of the reasons is that, that there
is no organised religion in India.

07:21.410 --> 07:27.567
There’s no popes, there are no priests,
nothing like them.

07:27.768 --> 07:31.754
They have priests just for worshipping
in the temples.

07:31.955 --> 07:38.932
But for giving realisation, for talking
about higher life,

07:39.133 --> 07:47.155
they all had to go to very great
realised souls.

07:48.797 --> 07:55.136
And it was absolutely the freedom of the
guru, whom to accept whom not to accept.

07:55.337 --> 08:00.719
And everybody was tested thoroughly
by the guru

08:00.920 --> 08:08.133
if they are capable of achieving
Self-realisation or not.

08:08.333 --> 08:15.547
And this test was so hard, so difficult,

08:15.748 --> 08:24.030
and also to a point of cruelty, that very
few could pass through that test.

08:24.231 --> 08:29.118
It’s not like Sahaja Yoga, everybody is
a Sahaja Yogi, it’s not like that.

08:30.542 --> 08:37.723
That, of course, made it a very narrow
margin for people

08:37.924 --> 08:43.966
to achieve their realisation and these
gurus never used to leave

08:44.167 --> 08:47.724
their own seats, they call it takiya
(meaning: pillow).

08:47.925 --> 08:51.778
They would be there in their own place,
all those who would like to go to him

08:51.979 --> 08:59.044
could come. If he allowed, then only
they can meet him.

08:59.245 --> 09:02.164
You may go on for miles together, nothing,

09:02.365 --> 09:06.653
no obligations of the guru that he should
meet you.

09:10.942 --> 09:20.115
Perhaps they didn’t feel that love and
compassion for the seekers.

09:20.316 --> 09:26.932
They didn’t understand that these seekers
are ardently seeking the truth

09:27.133 --> 09:30.180
and they should not suffer.

09:30.644 --> 09:37.007
That may be the reason they were not
so much concerned.

09:37.208 --> 09:40.963
All the time they were testing
their disciple.

09:41.164 --> 09:45.109
Even Ramdas, who was the guru of Shivaji,

09:45.310 --> 09:49.690
was testing even Shivaji for so many times,

09:49.891 --> 09:52.943
though he was a born realised.

09:54.740 --> 09:59.436
So to get this Gurupada, to [the] position
of a guru,

09:59.637 --> 10:09.421
after that they had to work very, very hard
to achieve a state of a saint.

10:11.983 --> 10:16.745
But in Sahaja Yoga that is not the case,
as you know.

10:17.580 --> 10:21.317
I just thought – if people get their
realisation,

10:21.518 --> 10:24.675
they’ll see for themselves what’s wrong
with them,

10:24.876 --> 10:30.577
they will introspect themselves and will
try to correct themselves.

10:30.778 --> 10:38.168
It is true, for many, many people, but some
of them still are lingering behind

10:38.369 --> 10:42.557
and are going on and on and on thinking
that they are Sahaja Yogis,

10:42.758 --> 10:48.589
they have achieved a lot, they are
something very special.

10:48.790 --> 10:53.587
So this delusion is all the time
is creating this problem.

10:53.788 --> 11:01.143
This delusion makes them very
narrow minded,

11:01.344 --> 11:09.784
selfish, self-centred, and people can’t
believe how can they be Sahaja Yogis.

11:12.502 --> 11:15.336
So the first and foremost thing we have
to know

11:15.537 --> 11:21.630
that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out
because Paramchaitanya

11:21.831 --> 11:26.495
is transmitting compassion. It never
did before.

11:26.696 --> 11:35.163
It never had that kind of an attitude
which it is there because I am a Mother.

11:35.364 --> 11:40.649
And this compassion has worked it this way
that: you all have got your realisation,

11:40.881 --> 11:46.362
you have achieved a state which we can
call as a Self-realised souls.

11:46.563 --> 11:53.698
But still, because you got it so easily,
cheaply,

11:53.899 --> 11:59.145
I think, still we don’t realise what we
have got.

11:59.346 --> 12:09.578
Still we do not practice meditation,
introspection and dedication.

12:09.779 --> 12:13.106
Some are very much there,

12:13.307 --> 12:20.202
but mostly we are just living in the idea
that we have already achieved.

12:22.846 --> 12:27.240
So, the first thing we should introspect:

12:28.971 --> 12:33.555
Are we concerned about ourselves?

12:35.472 --> 12:39.191
All the time do we think that we are
suffering,

12:39.392 --> 12:42.925
we have this problem, that problem,

12:43.126 --> 12:46.851
or this should be done, that should
be done.

12:47.052 --> 12:54.356
If the attention is on that, that all
the time you are worried about yourself,

12:56.094 --> 13:03.766
then you cannot break, you cannot break
through this shell of your being,

13:03.967 --> 13:13.478
which is under the domination of your
mental selfishness or self-centredness.

13:13.679 --> 13:19.761
Even self-centredness is absolutely
against your growth.

13:19.962 --> 13:23.238
There are many people who come,
I have seen, even to Cabella,

13:23.439 --> 13:27.093
I know they have to suffer a lot because
they think

13:27.294 --> 13:30.927
it’s a very open space where they have
to live

13:31.128 --> 13:34.844
and they must make all arrangements
to make themselves comfortable.

13:35.045 --> 13:37.805
Such people have to grow still much more.

13:38.006 --> 13:43.231
For a saint, any place has to be heavenly.

13:43.432 --> 13:48.467
You must have seen Me enjoying everything.

13:48.668 --> 13:54.726
I can live anywhere, I can sleep anywhere.
I have no demands of any kind.

13:54.927 --> 14:02.839
But if you are worried about your body
comforts or your body troubles

14:03.040 --> 14:09.102
then still you are at a body level, which
you have to transcend.

14:09.303 --> 14:14.499
Worried about how you look, how you
dress up,

14:14.700 --> 14:19.355
what sort of things you have to wear:

14:19.835 --> 14:26.839
all this makes you yet not a good
Sahaja Yogi.

14:29.942 --> 14:37.749
This is one style of Sahaja Yogis who
still want very great comforts.

14:37.950 --> 14:43.334
So, what you have to do, if you are used
to comforts:

14:43.535 --> 14:47.613
try to go and sleep on the street.

14:48.015 --> 14:54.127
I will not do that, but you can do it.
Or sleep on a tree.

14:54.328 --> 14:57.826
You may fall down, doesn’t matter.

15:03.681 --> 15:08.008
Do all kinds of things that are necessary
to punish your body to understand

15:08.209 --> 15:13.234
that you are not bound with this comfort
of the body.

15:15.482 --> 15:19.225
This is one of the greatest things one
has to see,

15:19.426 --> 15:23.288
that you are not bound by your body.

15:23.489 --> 15:27.945
It’s alright - if you have comfort, well
and good, if you don’t have, well and good.

15:28.146 --> 15:35.313
For a Sahaja Yogi it is very important that
he should be able to live like a saint.

15:35.514 --> 15:39.660
Not necessarily that you should become
a sanyasi,

15:39.836 --> 15:48.656
but from inside your body should be such
that you can dominate your body.

15:48.857 --> 15:55.196
How can you not sleep anywhere?
Why can you not sleep anywhere?

15:56.713 --> 16:05.631
Then also, that they want to have a very
comfortable arrangements

16:05.832 --> 16:09.776
about bathrooms, this, that.

16:10.919 --> 16:15.853
All these ideas are there because you are
very self-conscious

16:16.054 --> 16:20.126
but not superconsciousness, it’s not there.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.983
You want to have everything first class,

16:23.184 --> 16:29.263
and anybody who tries to interfere with
that kind of a thing, you don’t like it.

16:29.464 --> 16:34.209
I can understand a person who is very old –
he cannot manage things,

16:34.410 --> 16:40.343
he has to have a certain amount
of body comfort,

16:40.544 --> 16:47.269
but even young people these days are
extremely comfort-oriented.

16:48.724 --> 16:51.802
That is not for Sahaja Yoga.

16:53.593 --> 16:58.882
Of course, I’ve seen people in the West
are better off in this matter.

16:59.083 --> 17:02.366
Because when they go to India they told Me
they like

17:02.567 --> 17:06.701
[Maharashtra] S.T. buses better than
comfortable buses.

17:06.902 --> 17:08.353
So I said, “Why?”

17:08.554 --> 17:13.466
“Because Mother, you can jump in the bus
nicely with all the luggage,”

17:13.667 --> 17:19.990
“Because the windows are open, you can
breathe. Very natural, very good”.

17:20.192 --> 17:25.398
And they wanted to go on bullock carts
also. I mean they enjoy all that.

17:25.599 --> 17:30.275
Actually if you see you'll notice,
in the Western World mostly,

17:30.476 --> 17:33.194
people are taking to [a] more rustic life.

17:33.395 --> 17:36.370
They are enjoying more the rustic style
of life

17:36.571 --> 17:40.119
than to this so-called comfortable,
artificial life.

17:40.320 --> 17:46.614
Not so much Indians, I would say,
also Malaysians.

17:46.815 --> 17:54.204
I think, most of the people I have met
in the Western countries are really great

17:54.405 --> 17:59.143
because they can sleep anywhere,
they can eat anything.

17:59.344 --> 18:05.229
You ask them, “How did you like the food?”
“What did we eat, I don’t know Mother?”

18:05.430 --> 18:10.066
That is the sign. That is the sign
of a person

18:10.267 --> 18:16.233
who is not bothered as to what he
is eating, what he’s getting,

18:16.434 --> 18:24.894
what is his taste, “I like this, I like
that,” these words drop out.

18:25.974 --> 18:29.671
It’s not difficult, it’s not difficult,

18:29.872 --> 18:34.212
you might think that I am asking you to do
something, hazardous thing, you see.

18:34.413 --> 18:39.029
It’s not difficult at all. Because if you
have to impress

18:39.230 --> 18:43.594
the people around, you have to be
like a saint.

18:43.795 --> 18:48.668
And if you are a fussy person, if you are
a fusspot,

18:48.869 --> 18:55.371
then you cannot impress others that you
have got Self-realisation.

18:55.572 --> 18:58.558
Many people tell Me, “Mother, people
had to do so much:

18:58.759 --> 19:03.966
to go to Himalayas, do this, do that,
and then they got their realisation.

19:04.167 --> 19:09.718
How is it these people you have blessed?”
Even some great saints asked Me that.

19:09.919 --> 19:13.375
“What right they had to get this
realisation?

19:13.576 --> 19:17.178
Why did you give them realisation?
What have they achieved?”

19:17.379 --> 19:19.754
I said, “Only their desire.

19:19.955 --> 19:24.024
Their desire was very much there that
they should get their Self-realisation

19:24.225 --> 19:27.394
and that’s how they got it”.

19:27.661 --> 19:35.968
But now to go into only desire,
is not sufficient.

19:36.169 --> 19:39.221
You have to depend on your Self,

19:39.422 --> 19:43.653
on the light of your Spirit you should see
what’s wrong with you.

19:43.854 --> 19:48.578
This is a very important thing.
Ask questions to yourself.

19:48.779 --> 19:54.783
“Why do I want this? Why do I need this?
What is the purpose?”

19:54.984 --> 19:59.163
Because as you have seen, all the rest
of the world is mad,

19:59.364 --> 20:06.652
[we] call it mad, because they are
running after stupid things,

20:06.853 --> 20:12.659
they are wanting things which
has no meaning to spirituality.

20:12.860 --> 20:17.560
So spirituality itself should be
self-satisfying.

20:17.761 --> 20:22.087
If you are spiritually endowed, then you
are self-satisfied.

20:22.288 --> 20:28.393
And this self-satisfaction within you
will lead you

20:28.593 --> 20:33.155
to that Ocean of Joy about which
I have been telling you

20:33.356 --> 20:37.707
and all the Scriptures have described.

20:38.638 --> 20:44.733
For Sahaja Yogis, the word we use
is Nirananda.

20:44.934 --> 20:52.579
Nirananda means: A joyous state, where
nothing is needed.

20:52.984 --> 20:58.012
Joy itself is joy. You are enjoying
only joy.

20:58.213 --> 21:01.294
Nothing is needed to make you happy.

21:01.495 --> 21:09.089
You are happy because of joy that you have,
in the Nirananda state.

21:09.664 --> 21:16.158
If you go and see how these saints lived,
you will be amazed.

21:16.359 --> 21:21.544
How they managed their life, you’ll be
very much amazed.

21:21.745 --> 21:24.874
How many days they used to fast,
without food.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.448
Never bothered! They never thought
it was fasting.

21:27.649 --> 21:32.050
They just used to think, “We have no food,
so no, don’t eat.”

21:32.669 --> 21:36.982
Of course, you don’t have to go through
[that], you have got your realisation.

21:37.183 --> 21:42.290
So now you have a power to achieve
this mastery.

21:42.491 --> 21:45.119
Now you have this power.

21:45.320 --> 21:49.966
The another thing I have noticed
about Sahaja Yogis,

21:50.167 --> 21:55.830
some of them have grudges about others.

21:56.091 --> 22:00.048
Sahaja Yoga is

22:02.303 --> 22:11.354
the blessings of love, blessings
of compassion.

22:11.877 --> 22:16.902
There is no place for any kind of hatred,

22:17.103 --> 22:25.408
or any kind of revenge, or anger
among Sahaja Yogis.

22:26.734 --> 22:30.489
If you have that, you must conquer it.

22:30.690 --> 22:37.740
Is a good chance, if you find somebody
who is very hot-tempered,

22:38.111 --> 22:44.215
who is a very angry type, go and make
friends with that person.

22:44.416 --> 22:48.193
Just see if you can carry on with that
person or not.

22:48.394 --> 22:53.163
If there’s a fusspot, also make friends
with such a fusspot,

22:53.364 --> 23:00.555
and see that you achieve that peace

23:00.756 --> 23:04.555
which will keep you above all kinds
of hatred,

23:04.756 --> 23:09.437
all kinds of temper, which is a very
bad thing.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.838
But some Sahaja Yogis lose their temper
very fast.

23:13.039 --> 23:15.686
I would say they cannot be Sahaja Yogis,

23:15.887 --> 23:20.814
because if you have no control over
your anger,

23:21.015 --> 23:26.670
then how are you powerful of compassion
and love?

23:26.871 --> 23:31.352
But you don’t even have to control it –
just there.

23:31.553 --> 23:36.954
Once you have it, you have that state,
then you just watch and see.

23:37.293 --> 23:45.649
In the olden days, the saints, mostly, used
to be very much angry type people.

23:45.850 --> 23:49.443
They couldn’t bear the stupidity
of the world

23:49.644 --> 23:55.574
and they used to be very, very angry type
and they used to run away from people.

23:55.775 --> 24:02.136
I know of a saint, Nityanandswami, who
always lived on the tree,

24:02.337 --> 24:06.133
and anybody tried to come near him,
he used to throw stones at him.

24:06.334 --> 24:13.442
Couldn’t bear people who were all
heated up and coming to him.

24:13.643 --> 24:18.737
But you don’t need that. You have a way
of achieving

24:18.938 --> 24:25.786
love and affection of the people who seem
to be very, very troublesome

24:25.987 --> 24:30.985
and grudging type or maybe some people
who are very aggressive.

24:31.186 --> 24:36.747
This is not a difficult task if you try
a little bit the other way round.

24:36.964 --> 24:41.506
Mostly people, when they find somebody
who is a very hot-tempered person,

24:41.720 --> 24:46.182
they run away from them. «We don’t want
to have anything to do [with them]».

24:46.383 --> 24:55.037
Those who are not hot-tempered, those
who are good natured,

24:55.258 --> 24:59.728
you can always be friendly, what is
so great about it?

25:00.813 --> 25:11.085
What is so nice about it?
What is so sweet about it?

25:12.154 --> 25:17.339
But how you speak to the person, how you
talk to that person,

25:17.539 --> 25:25.109
how you manage that person: your love
will definitely melt him down,

25:25.310 --> 25:29.829
because he’s a Sahaja Yogi, I’m not saying
for non-sahaja yogis.

25:30.030 --> 25:35.831
Sahaja Yogis as they are, you have
to be extremely

25:36.032 --> 25:40.926
compassionate and affectionate
and love.

25:44.039 --> 25:49.311
The another thing which is extremely
important for us to know,

25:49.512 --> 25:54.927
that we have got this realisation
through Mother’s love.

25:55.128 --> 25:57.815
Only My compassion has acted,

25:58.016 --> 26:02.238
only the power of Mother’s compassion
could have worked it out.

26:02.439 --> 26:08.438
Now, even if this love is flowing towards
the stones,

26:08.639 --> 26:15.582
or towards the mountains, or towards
anything which is very solid,

26:15.783 --> 26:20.796
the ripples come back, they have
to come back.

26:20.997 --> 26:24.906
In the same way, you people now,
who have got realisation,

26:25.107 --> 26:28.437
have to know that compassion and love

26:28.638 --> 26:33.112
is the only power you have got,
nothing else.

26:34.447 --> 26:39.428
If you love yourself, you care
for yourself,

26:39.629 --> 26:44.050
you care for your family and care
for your children –

26:44.251 --> 26:47.687
then you haven’t achieved much.

26:47.888 --> 26:51.282
You are only worried about yourself,

26:51.483 --> 26:55.872
because that’s your limited area
where you move.

26:56.073 --> 27:04.361
But if you can break that and find out
places

27:04.562 --> 27:10.513
where you have to express your love,
you can.

27:10.714 --> 27:13.796
As they say, the water finds it’s own
level.

27:13.997 --> 27:19.338
In the same way, this compassion has
to flow to all the places,

27:19.539 --> 27:24.975
to all the ditches everywhere,
and should find its own level.

27:25.176 --> 27:31.969
But if you are just satisfied with yourself
and you are not bothered,

27:32.170 --> 27:40.990
you are just trying to believe that you are
a great soul because you are a Sahaja Yogi,

27:41.191 --> 27:46.118
then I must say that you are sadly
mistaken.

27:46.319 --> 27:50.510
In this lifetime you can achieve
that state.

27:50.711 --> 27:58.930
In this lifetime you can get to that state
within yourself.

27:59.131 --> 28:02.637
Now, the third thing that troubles
Sahaja Yogis is that

28:02.838 --> 28:08.322
“Mother, we want God’s realisation,”
that makes Me laugh.

28:08.523 --> 28:14.743
You see, it is already there, already
there.

28:14.944 --> 28:17.351
Like once you get into the sea

28:17.552 --> 28:19.846
and you say, “Mother, we want to go
to the bottom of the sea,”

28:20.047 --> 28:24.769
you can always go, just slip,
and you will be there.

28:24.970 --> 28:32.835
In the same way, once you have developed
a kind of a Self-realisation

28:33.036 --> 28:37.910
and have jumped into the Ocean
of this compassion,

28:38.111 --> 28:41.039
there’s no need to achieve anything.

28:41.240 --> 28:44.826
The sense of achievement, “I should be
that, I should be this,”

28:45.027 --> 28:49.484
is all coming from your human haunting.

28:49.685 --> 28:52.814
That should be over. Now you are
Godly people.

28:53.015 --> 28:57.524
So you should not think, “I should achieve
this state, I should achieve that state,”

28:57.725 --> 29:03.368
but just go on slipping, just giving up all
the weights that you have in your heads

29:03.576 --> 29:09.866
and it will work out. This is what I have
been saying to you that:

29:10.327 --> 29:17.234
you have to dissolve yourself
into the compassion.

29:17.459 --> 29:24.526
Also, there are still some very people
who want to be in the front.

29:24.883 --> 29:30.252
Specially Indians will all sit together
in front, I’ve seen that way.

29:30.453 --> 29:36.327
They have no right, they have no right
to sit in front.

29:36.528 --> 29:42.925
Nobody has right to sit in front or to seek
a place.

29:43.126 --> 29:51.047
They should sit wherever they get seat
to sit down with complete satisfaction.

29:51.912 --> 29:55.809
Whether you sit in front or at that corner,
even in the darkness,

29:56.010 --> 30:01.503
you can get My vibrations, you can get
everything.

30:01.704 --> 30:09.631
So to be prominent, to sit some place where
you are prominent, is not necessary.

30:11.052 --> 30:14.778
What is it in a prominence, what do
you get?

30:14.986 --> 30:23.850
To be lost into the crowds, to be lost
into the Ocean of Love is the main thing.

30:25.099 --> 30:31.827
All these are mythical that, we should
somehow or other get the front place.

30:32.027 --> 30:38.178
You see as Marathi apan manto (We say),
“Samor chi zaaga patkauli mi!”

30:42.921 --> 30:47.453
means “I have managed to get the front
seat!”

30:47.654 --> 30:54.023
Front will be the back, and back will be
the front.

30:54.319 --> 31:00.209
It is very surprising how still people
are trying

31:00.427 --> 31:04.968
to achieve something so nonsensical.

31:05.261 --> 31:10.638
So where is your mind, where is your
attention, what are you thinking?

31:10.839 --> 31:16.266
If you are thoughtless you'll be satisfied,
you'll be happy,

31:16.467 --> 31:21.379
you'll not ask for anything, you’ll not
want anything.

31:21.580 --> 31:27.063
What is there to have? What is
so important?

31:28.570 --> 31:32.726
All these ideas come from ignorance, I must
tell you, is from ignorance.

31:32.927 --> 31:36.463
Once this ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’ fellow
came to Me.

31:36.663 --> 31:41.239
And he said that, “We have heard you
are a great saint,

31:41.440 --> 31:45.350
this thing, that thing, and you have
all the comforts of life –

31:45.551 --> 31:49.913
you have everything here, very nice,
this thing, that thing.

31:50.980 --> 31:55.453
So, how are you a saint?”
I said, “How are you a saint?”

31:55.654 --> 32:01.958
[He said,] “I have given up my family,
I have given up my cars,

32:02.166 --> 32:08.184
I have given up my house, I have given up
my children.”

32:08.812 --> 32:13.857
I said, “One more thing you have given up”,
he said, “What?” “Your brains!”

32:23.093 --> 32:25.585
So they said, “But how do you say we have
given up our brains?”

32:25.786 --> 32:32.470
I said, “Very simple, I’ve given up
nothing, because I am holding nothing.

32:32.671 --> 32:36.577
What is there to give up when you are
not holding anything?

32:36.778 --> 32:42.199
Now, I would say in this house,
or on my body, anywhere,

32:42.400 --> 32:47.182
[if] you think you can find anything equal
to the dust particle

32:47.383 --> 32:55.838
of Shri Krishna, you can take it.
Should be equal though.”

32:56.039 --> 32:59.126
Now they started looking here and there.

32:59.327 --> 33:05.235
I said, “Then what have you given up?
Just stones! What have you given up?

33:05.436 --> 33:09.227
Why are you boasting about giving up that,
and giving up this and giving up…?”

33:09.428 --> 33:13.960
They even shaved their head. What is it?

33:14.161 --> 33:20.049
All these useless ideas that, “We have done
this, we have done that.”

33:20.254 --> 33:23.520
Anybody in Sahaja Yoga who thinks he
is doing a lot of work for Sahaja Yoga,

33:23.721 --> 33:27.397
should give up completely.

33:28.995 --> 33:32.240
That’s the sign of another ignorance.

33:32.441 --> 33:36.296
If you are part and parcel of the Ocean,

33:36.497 --> 33:39.868
everything is done by Ocean, you are
doing nothing.

33:40.069 --> 33:48.148
To have such ideas about yourself shows
how little you know about yourself.

33:48.349 --> 33:53.284
You are the Ocean. Now, if you are
the Ocean how can you claim,

33:53.485 --> 33:57.792
“I have touched this shore, I have touched
that shore, I have touched this shore”?

33:57.993 --> 34:03.001
No more “I” is left. Once this I-ness
drops out,

34:03.202 --> 34:09.218
then only the Universal Being within you
shines.

34:10.440 --> 34:21.273
All these things are so clearly evident
in our characters.

34:21.455 --> 34:27.741
Some people are very identified, say
with their country,

34:27.942 --> 34:34.030
or maybe with their worshipping style,
whatever it is.

34:34.231 --> 34:38.954
All these misidentifications have to be
given up.

34:39.155 --> 34:42.666
It’s very difficult for people because
they are so conditioned.

34:42.867 --> 34:48.878
And as long as you have conditioning
you cannot rise above your mind,

34:49.079 --> 34:52.754
which is a myth, you cannot.

34:52.970 --> 34:57.975
Now, try to understand what are
your conditionings are.

35:02.347 --> 35:06.463
One of them, I would say, I have seen
and I am so surprised,

35:06.664 --> 35:13.753
you go to the Western countries, all
of them only sing songs of Shri Ganesha.

35:13.954 --> 35:15.986
They know all the songs of Shri Ganesha,

35:16.187 --> 35:21.708
Shri Ganesha’s photographs, Shri Ganesha’s
everything, children also.

35:21.945 --> 35:24.693
And now I have seen that vibrations stop!

35:24.894 --> 35:28.640
Why should they stop? Why should Ganesha
stop the vibrations?

35:28.841 --> 35:31.680
Why they are doing it, I realised, was
because I said

35:31.881 --> 35:35.162
Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ.

35:35.386 --> 35:41.900
Their identification is with Christ and
Christianity, in a very subtle way.

35:44.611 --> 35:50.937
So all the vibrations stopped! Imagine
with Shri Ganesha’s music, we heard

35:51.138 --> 35:57.024
in one of the Eastern Block countries,
and all the vibrations had stopped

35:57.225 --> 36:00.711
and they were singing all the songs,
all the songs of Shri Ganesha,

36:00.920 --> 36:10.605
not one song of Sahaja Yoga, leave alone
about the Guru, not one song.

36:11.287 --> 36:17.778
So, even this, there is a very subtle,
subtle identification.

36:17.979 --> 36:27.124
There was one fellow in Russia, supposed
to be very intelligent,

36:27.325 --> 36:31.648
he said that, “Alright, if we keep Mother’s
photograph and also the icons,

36:31.849 --> 36:37.362
we can get the same type of vibrations.”
You cannot,

36:37.893 --> 36:42.635
because icons are made by some artist’s
imaginary.

36:42.836 --> 36:45.327
These are not representing actually

36:45.528 --> 36:50.183
even Maria or Christ or anyone, they are
all, all imaginary.

36:50.384 --> 36:56.108
If Italian ones makes Christ, he is
Italian style,

36:56.309 --> 37:01.814
if somebody - French one makes, he is
thin like [a] Frenchman,

37:02.031 --> 37:10.372
if you get somebody, say from Holland,
he'll have a forehead like that.

37:11.067 --> 37:17.712
You see all of them, they depict Christ
as they want to.

37:17.952 --> 37:25.454
Then we have Maria the same way.
Her expression, her photograph, everything,

37:25.662 --> 37:29.624
is all according to the imagination
of the artist

37:29.825 --> 37:35.073
and to whatever country he belongs,
that he will do.

37:35.274 --> 37:38.423
And they are not free, you can see,
they are not free,

37:38.624 --> 37:42.927
because all these artists have a certain
style.

37:43.128 --> 37:46.533
Now if it is Rembrandt, it’s a style,

37:46.734 --> 37:50.739
if it is, say Leonardo, it’s a style.

37:50.940 --> 37:54.969
Though they are born realised, still
they have a style. Nobody is like this,

37:55.170 --> 38:00.087
that he’ll make today like this, tomorrow
like this: there’s no freedom.

38:00.428 --> 38:04.551
They are bound by their own styles.

38:05.646 --> 38:10.960
Everybody has one style, and that is
the style they follow.

38:11.161 --> 38:18.403
Because, what is the reason? Reason is,
they must have done 3, 4 types of styles,

38:18.603 --> 38:23.723
must have done, sure, but people must
have rejected,

38:23.930 --> 38:29.779
“This is no good, this is no good.” So
it's all, you see, opinion of the people.

38:29.980 --> 38:33.651
So they must have taken to one style:
alright, this is the style.

38:33.852 --> 38:40.488
So you can see Christ if he’s Japanese,
he’ll have chinky eyes,

38:42.194 --> 38:46.367
if he’s Chinese, he’ll have no nose,

38:47.248 --> 38:53.621
if it’s Indian, he’ll be dark. So all kinds
of Christs I have seen

38:53.822 --> 39:00.103
and I feel that, how can they emit
vibrations? Tell Me.

39:01.468 --> 39:04.207
While with My photograph, how can you
compare?

39:04.408 --> 39:10.167
Also, cameras were to be developed at this
time: do you notice that point?

39:10.368 --> 39:15.424
Cameras were developed at this time,
not before that.

39:15.624 --> 39:20.343
This loudspeaker was not developed
before this.

39:20.544 --> 39:25.904
Aeroplanes were not developed before.
I have been travelling for 19 days,

39:26.105 --> 39:30.712
one day in the plane, second day
in the public programme.

39:30.913 --> 39:36.174
They could not do all that. Nobody could
do this.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.439
Neither Shri Krishna, nor anyone.

39:39.640 --> 39:44.480
They could not fly by aeroplane
in those days.

39:44.681 --> 39:48.797
Now we say we have 65 countries, somebody
says there’s “No, 68 countries”

39:48.998 --> 39:54.679
or go on correcting. But is only possible
because today, today:

39:54.880 --> 39:59.433
there are aeroplanes. They were never
there [before].

39:59.634 --> 40:06.419
So all these things are – even video, even
the way you are seeing My image there,

40:06.580 --> 40:10.590
was that available before? No.

40:12.291 --> 40:19.083
So this is a very special time, where
science has also supported

40:19.300 --> 40:22.719
seekers to find the Truth – science
has supported.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.877
We have to be thankful to science:

40:26.046 --> 40:30.613
that part of science which has been
so much supportive.

40:30.826 --> 40:36.434
Even [if] there was not a car, I could not
have gone up to Milan even!

40:36.855 --> 40:41.432
Imagine going on a bullock cart, what would
have happened to Me?

40:42.952 --> 40:48.495
So all these things are created today
for you.

40:48.696 --> 40:54.881
You were also born in those times
for this special reason.

40:55.082 --> 41:01.772
They could not give realisation because
that time you were not there.

41:02.457 --> 41:05.280
Very few people of your calibre were there.

41:05.481 --> 41:08.241
But I wonder if you understand
your calibre.

41:08.442 --> 41:14.659
The way you are sometimes growing,

41:14.860 --> 41:19.000
shows that you don’t understand
your calibre.

41:19.201 --> 41:21.372
You don’t know what you are,

41:21.573 --> 41:27.314
how much the whole atmosphere has
worked out for you,

41:27.515 --> 41:33.881
the science has been worked out for you.
Science is a gift of the nature.

41:34.082 --> 41:37.524
All this has been worked out for you

41:37.725 --> 41:44.537
to achieve the highest state
in the shortest time.

41:44.870 --> 41:53.171
But for that, one has to be extremely
introspective.

41:53.664 --> 41:59.113
Instead of thinking of what you have
to achieve: be introspective.

41:59.314 --> 42:07.742
This introspection will help you and you
will really become real gurus.

42:07.943 --> 42:14.920
When you go to other villages, other
places, other cities,

42:15.121 --> 42:21.187
people should know from your being itself
that some great person has come.

42:22.084 --> 42:26.885
You don’t have to tell, you don’t have
to certify,

42:27.086 --> 42:33.424
it’s the simplicity of your temperament
itself.

42:33.624 --> 42:39.832
First time I went to Leningrad, nobody
knew about Me.

42:40.033 --> 42:47.084
No advertisements, nothing. They just
put some posters, some.

42:47.285 --> 42:51.058
And there were 2000 people in the hall,
2000 outside.

42:51.259 --> 42:56.617
In the hall they had to pay, alright.
I was wondering what’s the matter.

42:56.818 --> 43:02.776
And when I came out I gave them realisation
but I said, “You come tomorrow“.

43:02.977 --> 43:08.638
So 2000 from inside and 2000 from outside
and about 2000 more came,

43:08.839 --> 43:12.559
and were all were sitting on the ground.

43:12.844 --> 43:19.250
I was amazed. I said, “What made you come
to My programme?”

43:20.191 --> 43:24.274
[They] said, “Mother, so obvious,
Your photograph!”

43:24.474 --> 43:31.885
Such sensitivity of spirituality:
“So obvious, from Your photograph!”

43:32.086 --> 43:34.434
And they were scientists, they were
doctors,

43:34.635 --> 43:37.314
they were all kinds of intelligent people.

43:37.523 --> 43:42.337
But they could feel the spirituality
from the face.

43:44.723 --> 43:49.191
That kind of a sensitivity we should have.

43:49.392 --> 43:51.685
When you don’t need any discretion,
nothing, you know:

43:51.886 --> 43:54.935
this is this, this is this, this
is this.

43:55.136 --> 43:59.378
Don’t have to judge, don’t have to think
about it.

44:01.211 --> 44:08.938
You cannot say who will be best fitted
for this:

44:09.139 --> 44:12.644
those who have come for the first time,
those who have come later on,

44:12.845 --> 44:20.868
or those who will be coming, younger
or older, women, men or children.

44:21.399 --> 44:24.037
It is there.

44:25.209 --> 44:29.984
In my lifetime if I see so many of you,
so much transformed,

44:30.185 --> 44:36.504
looking so beautiful, so nice, creating
such a good atmosphere.

44:36.781 --> 44:39.663
It’s more than satisfaction for Me.

44:39.864 --> 44:44.963
And sometimes I think I - there is nothing
to be done now anymore – finished.

44:45.164 --> 44:51.137
But then they invite Me here, and invite Me
there, so I’m just doing.

44:51.338 --> 44:54.179
But to be very frank I am over satisfied.

44:54.380 --> 44:59.462
Now, once you have planted the tree…
it’s like a mango tree.

44:59.663 --> 45:04.773
Once you have planted the mango tree
and looked after it for 3 - 4 years,

45:04.981 --> 45:08.042
then it looks after itself.

45:08.579 --> 45:13.875
It gives fruits, it doesn’t need any water,
nothing, it just grows by itself.

45:14.076 --> 45:20.868
In the same way it should happen with you.
You should grow by yourself.

45:21.844 --> 45:26.090
Of course, you will find people who are
stupid, who are aggressive,

45:26.299 --> 45:30.461
who are not at all Sahaja Yogis

45:30.662 --> 45:33.147
and trying to be Sahaja Yogis.
You’ll find all kinds.

45:33.348 --> 45:38.554
So just see them, that’s all.

45:41.495 --> 45:53.686
In this Guru puja, you have to decide
that what are the criteria.

45:53.887 --> 46:02.694
First a Guru has to be without desires,
any desires whatsoever:

46:05.025 --> 46:10.677
Nirichcha, as they say. There is one
false guru in India

46:10.878 --> 46:14.303
who said that, “If I had the powers
as Mother has,

46:14.504 --> 46:18.594
then I would have become the king
of this world.”

46:18.795 --> 46:22.701
So people said, “Then why don’t you
become?”

46:22.902 --> 46:27.920
“Why doesn’t Mother become like that?
Why doesn’t She become the king?”

46:28.121 --> 46:31.228
So they said, “Because She is Nirichcha -
means She has no desires.

46:31.429 --> 46:35.715
A person who has no desires will not
become anything.”

46:35.916 --> 46:42.090
So I said go and tell him, “If you have
desires, you cannot have powers also.”

46:43.580 --> 46:48.825
It’s only because you have no desires,
that’s why all these powers are there.

46:49.026 --> 46:54.541
So any desire that comes into your mind,
you should say, “Ah, forget it.

46:57.731 --> 46:59.512
Just forget it.”

46:59.713 --> 47:07.710
When the desire is overpowering,
you just divert your attention.

47:07.911 --> 47:12.497
Any kind of stupid desire can take charge

47:12.698 --> 47:21.654
and how do you become desireless is
by getting to the thoughtless awareness.

47:21.854 --> 47:24.744
Any crisis comes in, you should be
able to rise

47:24.945 --> 47:30.529
into that state of thoughtless awareness.
Just be peaceful.

47:31.168 --> 47:34.936
Look at your desires with peace.

47:35.137 --> 47:38.095
You can tell the desire, “Oh, I’m very
much satisfied, now don’t come,

47:38.296 --> 47:40.874
I don’t want.”

47:42.473 --> 47:47.013
That’s how you can become desireless.

47:47.331 --> 47:53.215
There is this compassion, and
the compassion

47:53.416 --> 47:59.807
that becomes actually the power.

48:01.021 --> 48:08.491
[With] small, small things you can express
your love, very small, small things.

48:08.927 --> 48:13.728
In very sweet ways you can express
your love.

48:14.204 --> 48:19.897
Is very important. The whole world needs
today love and peace.

48:20.098 --> 48:27.120
And you have to give peace and love
to everyone that is possible.

48:27.321 --> 48:31.893
Of course [with] Sahaja Yogis [it] is
very easy, but even non-sahaja yogis,

48:32.094 --> 48:36.238
you must treat them with respect and love.

48:36.695 --> 48:44.080
But you should not have a desire that
you should get back anything from them.

48:44.281 --> 48:46.830
It’s alright, whatever done, is forgotten.

48:47.031 --> 48:50.831
You have known so many Sahaja Yogis who
came to Sahaja Yoga, have gained so much

48:51.032 --> 48:56.813
and have betrayed us – [it] doesn’t matter,
[it’s] not important.

48:57.033 --> 49:03.112
Because they are going to be losers,
not we.

49:03.739 --> 49:07.972
So, there’s nothing to bother about
these things.

49:08.173 --> 49:14.097
Then another thing is: try to see that
your mind doesn’t react.

49:14.298 --> 49:20.204
Some people have a habit, or I think most
of them have, to react.

49:20.595 --> 49:27.597
You tell them something, they’ll put their
own one tail with it, something.

49:27.987 --> 49:32.546
Never will they accept if somebody
says something.

49:32.747 --> 49:37.139
If you are reacting, what will go into
your heads? What will go into your heart?

49:37.340 --> 49:40.477
What will go into your attention?

49:41.827 --> 49:49.715
So the reaction itself is a sign of not
proper development within yourself.

49:49.916 --> 49:54.502
This attention which is trying to go
into all the areas of your mind

49:54.703 --> 49:59.559
and your body and everywhere, is not there.

49:59.760 --> 50:08.319
It cannot enter, because as soon as
it tries to enter, you shut it by reacting.

50:08.896 --> 50:14.114
You cannot see anything just for seeing
sake, you must react.

50:14.315 --> 50:18.112
You say, “This is not good, that’s not
good.”

50:18.635 --> 50:25.311
If I say, “It's 5 o’clock”, you’ll say,
“No, it is 5 past, 2 minutes, 3 seconds.”

50:27.347 --> 50:32.773
This comes with terrible conditioning
which has to go away.

50:32.974 --> 50:37.899
Not to react. Why should you react?

50:38.802 --> 50:44.688
Then the argument starts, then fight
starts, then wars come in.

50:46.093 --> 50:47.931
If you tell your mind,

50:48.132 --> 50:53.380
“Nothing doing, you are a myth and I am
not going to react to anything!”

50:53.872 --> 50:58.544
99. 9% problems will be solved.

51:04.472 --> 51:08.832
Then the last, but not the least is
the ego.

51:09.682 --> 51:17.095
I can’t understand a saint having a ego,
just can’t understand.

51:21.690 --> 51:26.324
It’s so stupid to have ego.

51:26.525 --> 51:33.780
It’s a kind of a domination, if slightest
things are wrong, you get angry.

51:34.852 --> 51:37.821
If somebody says something, you get angry.

51:38.022 --> 51:44.450
That means your power of love and
compassion is still not full.

51:47.631 --> 51:52.777
You can, of course, correct people
when they have to be corrected,

51:52.978 --> 51:57.915
but for that you should have this power
within yourself.

51:58.116 --> 52:01.056
The person should know that you are
correcting that person

52:01.257 --> 52:08.687
because you love that person,
not for selfishness, not for any gain.

52:08.888 --> 52:13.498
But this ego is a very big problem
and that comes up

52:13.699 --> 52:23.452
by, I should say, not only ignorance
but stupid ideas about yourself.

52:25.483 --> 52:32.699
If you think you are something great,
already, then what can you do?

52:33.694 --> 52:39.124
Ego makes you very arrogant, horrible.

52:39.325 --> 52:44.945
But if you are humble, really, not to just
to have the humility of a businessman,

52:45.114 --> 52:49.225
but if you are humble from within yourself,

52:49.426 --> 52:55.268
from your heart, enjoying your humility,

52:56.930 --> 53:00.005
then this ego can run away.

53:00.206 --> 53:03.769
You have to ask yourself, “Now what
are you angry for?”

53:03.970 --> 53:08.674
Again I come back to the same point:
introspection.

53:08.851 --> 53:12.888
Because you are not here just to carry on
some jobs,

53:13.089 --> 53:17.969
but you are here to become saints.

53:18.811 --> 53:28.772
Then this ego should be made into a great
instrument of love and joy.

53:28.973 --> 53:31.918
You can, it's not difficult.

53:32.119 --> 53:40.084
This one is what is ego is, reactions
to things.

53:40.484 --> 53:47.983
You can react to things in a sweet way
or you can react to things in a deadly way.

53:49.047 --> 53:52.553
Then [the] humour comes in.

53:53.491 --> 54:03.547
Also you speak as if there is fragrant
flowers which are coming out.

54:03.748 --> 54:10.323
Then every action of yours, everything
becomes very gentle and sweet.

54:10.524 --> 54:18.571
Have this ego that will be gentle,
will be kind, will be sweet,

54:18.772 --> 54:23.833
will be forgiving, will be loving.
Let’s have this ego.

54:24.033 --> 54:28.041
Start with this kind of a ego – the other
way round.

54:28.242 --> 54:34.013
You’ll be surprised how you can really
conquer the whole world.

54:34.326 --> 54:40.019
On this day of Guru Puja, is, Guru is
supposed to tell something

54:40.220 --> 54:44.322
to his disciples about correcting
themselves.

54:44.523 --> 54:48.833
In My own sweet way I’ve said to you
which you shouldn’t mind.

54:49.034 --> 54:52.905
I don’t mean to condemn you by any chance
but to give you

54:53.106 --> 54:58.691
a proper sense of introspection, proper
sense of introspection

54:58.892 --> 55:03.531
by which you all get your Gurupada.

55:03.732 --> 55:10.863
My only, I shouldn’t say desire, because
I don’t have desires.

55:11.064 --> 55:16.486
So My only vision is, that I should see
all the Sahaja Yogis

55:16.687 --> 55:23.695
drenched in the power of love, enjoying
each other's love,

55:23.896 --> 55:31.164
enjoying each other's relationship, and
improving relationships.

55:31.594 --> 55:35.957
I know there are problematic people,
I know, they are problematic,

55:36.158 --> 55:42.534
but if you cannot solve the problem
what’s the use of your become masters?

55:44.907 --> 55:50.562
So, I leave it to you to solve

55:51.037 --> 55:59.575
your own problems which you are facing.
And introspection,

55:59.776 --> 56:06.866
with love and compassion, not by condemning
yourself, I am sure you can manage it.

56:07.067 --> 56:09.968
May God bless you.

56:42.705 --> 56:45.975
Shri Mataji: Is there warm water for...?

57:46.370 --> 57:50.457
Guido: All the children from five to twelve
years old.

57:50.658 --> 57:54.446
I bambini dai cinque ai dodici anni.

57:54.907 --> 57:59.712
Les enfants entre cinq and douze ans.

58:43.062 --> 58:48.262
Yogini (in Russian): All the children from
five to twelve years old can come.

59:45.993 --> 59:49.421
Guido: Shri Ganesha’s mantra.

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:26.771

01:13:38.545 --> 01:13:43.236

Yogi: All the leaders come to the stage.

01:22:30.873 --> 01:22:33.691
All the leaders.

01:24:17.818 --> 01:24:22.017
Yogi 2: These are praises to the Guru –

01:24:28.098 --> 01:24:37.434
these are praises to the Guru, Shri Mataji,
from Shri Gyaneshwara.

01:24:37.804 --> 01:24:41.356
Salutations to You, O Guru Mauli.

01:24:41.557 --> 01:24:47.443
You are famous as One who generously
showers on Your children

01:24:47.644 --> 01:24:53.429
the immaculate and eternal joy, Nirananda.

01:25:01.692 --> 01:25:06.843
[Long pause, during which Shri Mataji says
something to somebody on stage,

01:25:15.864 --> 01:25:21.339
then Yogi Mahajan repeats]

01:26:15.659 --> 01:26:19.765
1) Salutations to You, O Guru Mauli.

01:26:19.966 --> 01:26:24.765

Please repeat all of you.

01:26:38.617 --> 01:26:42.306
2) O Guru Mauli, the compassionate One,

01:26:42.507 --> 01:26:49.202
when the snake of sensuality takes a grip
on us, and stings us,

01:26:49.403 --> 01:26:55.116
the poison which is difficult to be removed
takes away our awareness.

01:26:55.317 --> 01:27:02.129
But O Mother, with Your just one glance,
that poison vanishes,

01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:05.337
and we get back our awareness.

01:27:05.538 --> 01:27:09.072

(Shri Mataji says something).
Yogi: Yes, everything.

01:27:17.433 --> 01:27:24.061
The second part everybody should say
together. (Shri Mataji says something) Yes.

01:27:25.239 --> 01:27:29.783
3) Shri Mataji, our most beloved Guru,

01:27:29.992 --> 01:27:33.192
when we have the flood of Your ambrosia,

01:27:33.393 --> 01:27:40.784

01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:30.836

sing to us the lullaby of Anahat sound,

of Your Lotus Feet.

01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:28.096

over the universe of words.

We get the power of effective expression
of subtle feelings through words,

01:30:51.897 --> 01:30:55.941
and the Divine knowledge comes on the tip
of the tongue.

12) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

Your mere remembrance makes one’s speech

01:33:47.138 --> 01:33:53.036
But when You manifest Your Brahma rupa,

When a magician casts the spell of his

his spectators become oblivious to the rest
of the world.

01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:21.441
But the magician cannot hide himself.

01:34:21.642 --> 01:34:24.857
But Shri Mataji, in the spell of Your maya,

01:34:25.058 --> 01:34:27.907
the awareness of the truth about You
is lost,

and give them the enlightenment,

01:34:56.643 --> 01:35:00.199
while those engrossed in maya are
ignorant about You.

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:06.068

21) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

01:35:18.194 --> 01:35:22.339
It is Your Shakti which has given to water
its liquid nature,

and to Mother Earth her forgiving nature.

The wind blows freely everywhere
because of Your power.

And the sky which is seen to be all
encompassing

24) Not just this, Shri Mataji.

01:36:27.067 --> 01:36:31.436
The Maya is also a constituent of Your
Virata form,

01:36:31.637 --> 01:36:34.785
and the enlightenment is due to Your power.

01:36:34.986 --> 01:36:39.262
Your form could not be understood even
by the Shrutis,

01:36:39.463 --> 01:36:43.122
who had to make futile efforts
to describe You.

The Vedas were said to be experts
in describing the form of God,

01:37:00.372 --> 01:37:05.518
but it was only till such time they did
not behold Your Brahma Rupa.

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:08.276
When they start describing Your pure form,

01:37:08.477 --> 01:37:12.914
they become silent as we are
in our meditation.

Greece,

02:56:40.295 --> 02:56:43.168
Slovenia,

02:56:53.398 --> 02:56:56.001
Poland,

02:57:01.683 --> 02:57:04.508
Portugal,

02:57:12.448 --> 02:57:15.226
Brazil,

02:57:24.699 --> 02:57:27.500
Sweden,

02:57:47.024 --> 02:57:50.905
Estonia and Lithuania.

02:58:12.020 --> 02:58:16.697
One sari from New Zealand, one sari
from Malaysia.

02:58:17.381 --> 02:58:19.891
Malaysia.

02:58:54.572 --> 02:58:58.755
Now the international present.

03:00:08.792 --> 03:02:59.424
«Repetition of video»

03:03:27.222 --> 03:03:30.223
This is a national present which
is presented by the countries

03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:34.482
which co-organised the puja.

03:05:01.775 --> 03:05:07.499
Guido: As you all know, Shri Mataji has
been always trying to encourage art,

03:05:07.700 --> 03:05:11.792
to support the artists, and She is
travelling all over the world

03:05:11.993 --> 03:05:19.369
collecting pieces, trying to improve
the artisans

03:05:19.570 --> 03:05:22.358
and handicraft all over the world.

03:05:22.559 --> 03:05:30.223
So this time Italy has found some art
pieces from different artists,

03:05:30.424 --> 03:05:36.580
in Sardinia, and we would like
to present Shri Mataji.

03:05:36.875 --> 03:05:46.652
They are all different way of treating
the ceramics.

03:05:51.237 --> 03:05:54.417
Shri Mataji: Where did you get this?
Guido: Sardinia, Shri Mataji.

03:05:54.618 --> 03:05:57.023
Shri Mataji: Eh? Guido: Sardinia.
Shri Mataji: What’s this? Yogini: Sardinia.

03:05:57.224 --> 03:06:01.040
Guido: This is cooked in a wood oven.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

03:06:01.249 --> 03:06:06.097
Guido: Wood oven. Shri Mataji: Wood?
Guido: Wood oven. In the oven...

03:06:06.298 --> 03:06:10.779
Shri Mataji: It’s a marble? (Unclear)
Guido: No, it's made in a wood oven.

03:06:10.987 --> 03:06:15.404
Shri Mataji: Ah! And where did you find it?
Guido: In Sardinia.

03:06:15.605 --> 03:06:23.667
Shri Mataji: Sardinia!
This is Sardinian. That’s beautiful.

03:06:50.064 --> 03:06:54.938
Guido: The another one (?) is from Sicily.
This is all Sardinian.

03:06:55.146 --> 03:06:58.123
Shri Mataji: All Sardinians?
Guido: All Sardinians.

03:07:13.732 --> 03:07:18.153
Shri Mataji: All such is a... (unclear)
Guido: No, only that one.

03:08:36.938 --> 03:08:46.757
Now, you see, every puja I give presents
to all the countries who are hosting:

03:08:46.965 --> 03:08:50.475
to all the ladies, all the men,
the leaders.

03:08:50.676 --> 03:08:56.900
Only in Guru puja, I’m sorry, I’m not
supposed to give any presents to anyone.

03:08:57.109 --> 03:09:05.394
It’s a thing when the guru, only, has
to grab everything from you!

03:09:14.577 --> 03:09:17.364
All this has to be given only on Guru puja:

03:09:17.565 --> 03:09:21.001
specially the saris, that have been given
to Me,

03:09:21.211 --> 03:09:24.650
are all to be given only during Guru puja.

03:09:24.851 --> 03:09:33.794
But I’m sorry, I can’t give anything
to the leaders or to anyone on this day.

03:09:33.995 --> 03:09:37.353
I hope you people don’t mind.

03:09:49.917 --> 03:09:53.845
To be the guru and to be Mother is a very
difficult thing

03:09:54.046 --> 03:10:02.718
because, if you see, the gurus have been
very strict disciplinarians:

03:10:02.919 --> 03:10:08.458
they always try to discipline the disciples
and [be] quite hard with them.

03:10:08.659 --> 03:10:13.859
But the mother can’t be that hard, you see.
This is the trouble with the motherhood is!

03:10:14.060 --> 03:10:20.278
That may be one of the reasons that people
take, sometimes, Sahaja Yoga for granted.

03:10:20.479 --> 03:10:26.202
But you should not, because you have got
your realisation now.

03:10:26.403 --> 03:10:29.898
Now you are realised-souls, you are
masters,

03:10:30.099 --> 03:10:32.475
so you should look after your ascent.

03:10:32.676 --> 03:10:35.755
I don’t have to tell you what [is] to be
done,

03:10:35.956 --> 03:10:40.713
because you have the light in your hand
and you can do that very well.

03:10:40.914 --> 03:10:46.527
I hope today’s lecture, you liked very much
and you don’t mind

03:10:46.728 --> 03:10:51.775
if I have said something that might have
upset you a little bit.

03:10:51.976 --> 03:10:57.360
But it is a thing [that] one has to see
because we all have to grow

03:10:57.561 --> 03:11:02.634
inside and outside and we have to spread
Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

03:11:02.835 --> 03:11:06.988
So we should see everyone - whether
it’s a woman or a man -

03:11:07.189 --> 03:11:11.175
we should see how many people we have
given realisation to.

03:11:11.376 --> 03:11:15.844
It’s very important that you should start
giving realisation all over the world.

03:11:16.045 --> 03:11:21.527
In this fashion it will spread and I don’t
have to then travel so much

03:11:21.728 --> 03:11:24.839
as nowadays I am travelling still.

03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:29.836
I think, you all should take it up upon
yourself that you will do,

03:11:30.043 --> 03:11:35.624
at least if not travelling, around your
cities, around in your places of work,

03:11:35.825 --> 03:11:39.844
you can start talking about Sahaja Yoga
openly.

03:11:40.045 --> 03:11:44.504
All the blessings are there, all the powers
are there, you can work it out very well.

03:11:44.705 --> 03:11:48.207
Anybody you find difficult you give bandhan
and can manage things.

03:11:48.408 --> 03:11:51.305
You know it very well. You know everything
about Sahaja Yoga,

03:11:51.506 --> 03:11:54.769
so I don’t have to tell you about it.
Only thing: use it!

03:11:54.970 --> 03:11:58.931
Even if you have all the instruments and
if you don’t use it, it won’t work out.

03:11:59.132 --> 03:12:04.744
With all My love, with all My blessings,

03:12:04.945 --> 03:12:07.686
I say goodbye now to you, for the time
being.

03:12:07.887 --> 03:12:10.681
Thank you.

03:12:23.266 --> 03:12:29.960
Guido: Bolo Shri Adi Guru Mata
Shri Nirmala Devi ki! Yogis: Jai!
