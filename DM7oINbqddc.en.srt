1
00:00:27,957 --> 00:00:32,317
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

2
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:37,410
brothers and sisters from Europe

3
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,060
and our brothers and sisters from the host countries,

4
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,890
We welcome you to our concert this evening.

5
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,590
I'll let my colleague, Alex Henshaw

6
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,530
tell you what we have for your entertainment

7
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:59,180
and hope that you all enjoy, very
much, what we have to present for you.

8
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,710
Thank you.

9
00:01:13,642 --> 00:01:16,224
So with a packed programme tonight, we'll start

10
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:19,254
with a saxophone raga, Raag Jog

11
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:24,144
and this is with Nicholas Buff on the saxophone

12
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:26,655
and Sandesh playing tabla.

13
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:49,295
We have another raga, this time a synthesiser raga,

14
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:51,345
Bhageshwari

15
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:54,689
and Dhananjay Dhumal is playing this,

16
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:59,344
again accompanied by Sandesh on the tabla.

17
01:12:06,299 --> 01:12:11,854
So our next item we have a sitar raag.

18
01:12:11,864 --> 01:12:16,124
This is performed by Avaneendra Sheolika

19
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:20,520
and again accompanied by Sandesh on tabla.

20
01:12:41,485 --> 01:12:44,780
Jai Shri Mataji,

21
01:12:44,786 --> 01:12:46,980
in today's concert, tonight's concert

22
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,770
I've decided to play Raag Puriya Kalyan

23
01:12:52,896 --> 01:13:00,336
I'll play Alaap, Jyot, Jala, the pure description of raga

24
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:03,666
followed by free composition

25
01:13:03,703 --> 01:13:11,093
Vilambit, a slow one. It is set to Teen
Tal, a rhythmic cycle of sixteen beats.

26
01:13:11,103 --> 01:13:16,403
Followed by Mandela Jhap Taal,
a rhythmic cycle of ten beats.

27
01:13:16,418 --> 01:13:22,248
Then again a true Teen Tal, a fast
one. It is set to Teen Tal again.

28
01:13:22,281 --> 01:13:26,888
a rhythmic cycle of sixteen beats.
Raag Puriya Kalyan. Thank you.

29
02:21:27,250 --> 02:21:31,867
Just now we have heard all these four artists.

30
02:21:31,867 --> 02:21:36,610
The first one is an Australian.

31
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:41,125
I only know his surname, but I don't know his name.

32
02:21:41,125 --> 02:21:42,765
What is his name?

33
02:21:42,765 --> 02:21:45,265
Nick Buff

34
02:21:45,265 --> 02:21:46,265
Nick?

35
02:21:46,265 --> 02:21:55,092
Right! So his name is Nick and I heard him before also.

36
02:21:55,110 --> 02:21:58,332
But this instrument that he played

37
02:21:58,372 --> 02:22:02,392
I've never heard anybody playing
classical Indian Music with that.

38
02:22:02,504 --> 02:22:05,004
I think it must be very difficult to play

39
02:22:05,004 --> 02:22:10,287
with that particular saxophone that you have seen,

40
02:22:10,326 --> 02:22:14,737
but how he is played it because
Indian Music is all melodious,

41
02:22:14,737 --> 02:22:17,936
and it cannot be played in parts and it's...

42
02:22:17,946 --> 02:22:20,526
I was amazed how he managed it

43
02:22:20,594 --> 02:22:26,263
and another thing which has really
enamoured me about him is this,

44
02:22:26,281 --> 02:22:33,923
that my father had a great desire to spread our Indian Classical Music all over the world.

45
02:22:33,923 --> 02:22:37,091
And he said if you spread this music

46
02:22:37,103 --> 02:22:46,161
then all kinds of music, which are
not music but are noises, will vanish.

47
02:22:46,176 --> 02:22:53,220
And so people should know this classical music, then they can play any other music they want.

48
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:56,846
His ambition was like that,

49
02:22:56,865 --> 02:23:04,406
and I am so happy that Baba Mama
has started a beautiful academy,

50
02:23:04,436 --> 02:23:09,425
very beautiful land he has got in Nagpur.

51
02:23:09,422 --> 02:23:15,111
And from that academy, this
gentleman, Mr Nick has come up.

52
02:23:15,148 --> 02:23:17,958
And in such a short time,

53
02:23:17,978 --> 02:23:23,669
so remarkable, he is a genius, must be
something special that in such a short time

54
02:23:23,670 --> 02:23:29,400
to play a raag, like Jog, is very difficult.

55
02:23:29,415 --> 02:23:32,980
Only great musicians play that I have seen.

56
02:23:33,010 --> 02:23:35,510
I have heard Vilayat Khan Sahib

57
02:23:35,510 --> 02:23:40,767
and also I've heard our....

58
02:23:40,776 --> 02:23:43,907
his nephew as you have known him very well.

59
02:23:43,940 --> 02:23:51,041
So, all these difficult ragas, I thought
he'd play Yaman or something like that,

60
02:23:51,051 --> 02:23:54,981
but here he plays Jog and so well:

61
02:23:55,025 --> 02:23:58,466
like any other great musician.

62
02:23:58,507 --> 02:24:02,311
So actually my eyes were filled with tears,

63
02:24:02,356 --> 02:24:07,976
I don't know what to say that I never knew
this academy can produce such good artists

64
02:24:07,976 --> 02:24:10,476
and such good talent would be utilised.

65
02:24:10,489 --> 02:24:13,569
It's more creditable because he is not an Indian.

66
02:24:13,569 --> 02:24:19,289
And in such a short time, he has
picked up this difficult music.

67
02:24:19,301 --> 02:24:25,600
It's really, absolutely an impossible feat.

68
02:24:25,620 --> 02:24:30,550
And I have no words actually, to describe My joy,

69
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:36,440
that one of the desires My father had, is fulfilled.

70
02:24:36,441 --> 02:24:42,341
Now once we establish this academy,
many people will go. I am sure to it

71
02:24:42,341 --> 02:24:47,867
and will learn this. In that, of
course, Guruji has helped a lot,

72
02:24:47,877 --> 02:24:52,327
Sandesh has helped a lot, Jane
has helped, everybody has helped.,

73
02:24:52,351 --> 02:24:56,197
but still, I must say is creditable to the talent.

74
02:24:56,231 --> 02:24:58,327
I never knew Australians were that talented.

75
02:24:58,327 --> 02:25:01,065
They are! You will see their talent now.

76
02:25:01,079 --> 02:25:05,595
They are quite talented. I think it
is Shri Ganesha's blessings on them,

77
02:25:05,582 --> 02:25:07,725
that they're so talented.

78
02:25:07,725 --> 02:25:14,235
But this playing Indian Music
you see, it's not an easy thing

79
02:25:14,234 --> 02:25:19,786
And it's remarkable, I don't know,
maybe My father's blessings are working

80
02:25:19,798 --> 02:25:23,096
or I don't know what's
happening to this academy, that

81
02:25:23,107 --> 02:25:33,359
such a brilliant and such a beautiful, melodious
rendering of this Jog Raga you have heard.

82
02:25:33,379 --> 02:25:45,250
I am very grateful to him for really reproducing
something, that is an impossible feat.

83
02:25:45,270 --> 02:26:03,104
The second person for whom a great love,
is as you know, is our little Dhananjay.

84
02:26:03,114 --> 02:26:11,654
He is such a young boy and he is also, I
think, is a born genius, something like that.

85
02:26:11,681 --> 02:26:16,964
These days lots of prodigies are born. I
think he is also a prodigy or something.

86
02:26:16,980 --> 02:26:26,162
See he plays so well. I mean to play this raga, in such a beautiful manner and this is a western instrument again.

87
02:26:26,171 --> 02:26:32,154
To play on this western instrument,
he really... if you know Vivaldi,

88
02:26:32,154 --> 02:26:37,214
if you have heard Vivaldi, many a
time it sounded like Vivaldi today.

89
02:26:37,229 --> 02:26:39,251
Do you think so?

90
02:26:41,093 --> 02:26:46,091
And this is something remarkable
again at this young age.

91
02:26:46,090 --> 02:26:52,008
I don't know what to say, but all My
blessings and I take the bad eye from them.

92
02:26:52,028 --> 02:26:55,718
Nobody should do anything wrong to these boys.

93
02:26:55,740 --> 02:26:59,578
He couldn't come. It's a big story.  He couldn't come.

94
02:26:59,604 --> 02:27:04,136
They said, "You pay no income tax." At this
young age who can pay income tax in India?

95
02:27:04,150 --> 02:27:06,650
And moreover he's the son of a farmer.

96
02:27:06,650 --> 02:27:10,616
In India, farmers are not paying any income tax.

97
02:27:10,634 --> 02:27:16,791
So, the Italians thought, they are
not paying income tax, so how can they go?

98
02:27:16,805 --> 02:27:20,354
They might start working here or
something. I don't know what was the idea.

99
02:27:20,373 --> 02:27:28,811
but thank God, it came into My...
just into My own inspiration

100
02:27:28,828 --> 02:27:30,961
I felt I better tell Guido.

101
02:27:30,978 --> 02:27:33,081
And Guido knows somebody there, luckily.

102
02:27:33,081 --> 02:27:37,599
Now anybody who doesn't get visas, tell Guido.

103
02:27:40,919 --> 02:27:42,919
For Italy!

104
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:46,250
Because they are very troublesome. They have
become very funny now all these Italians.

105
02:27:46,291 --> 02:27:49,720
I don't know, but they have become quite funny.

106
02:27:49,731 --> 02:27:54,440
And when they are coming only for 2 or 3
days, what is there to trouble them so much.

107
02:27:54,440 --> 02:28:00,840
So he went down and he...

108
02:28:00,860 --> 02:28:09,700
Guido had told somebody there, whom
he knows and they gave him the visa.

109
02:28:09,708 --> 02:28:11,708
So he came to the Customs

110
02:28:11,699 --> 02:28:14,518
and the Customs said, "Why are
you carrying this big instrument?"

111
02:28:14,552 --> 02:28:18,142
They thought he was coming here to sell it, you see.

112
02:28:18,132 --> 02:28:25,292
He said, "You see, I am going for a programme of
Shri Mataji." In India! He showed him the badge.

113
02:28:25,316 --> 02:28:28,962
The Customs know Me there very
well. They said. "All right. Go."

114
02:28:28,982 --> 02:28:31,538
But surprisingly here in...

115
02:28:36,608 --> 02:28:43,928
when he came here, the Airport Authority again,
objected to his carrying this instrument.

116
02:28:43,928 --> 02:28:48,168
Again he showed My badge and
they said, "All right, go!"

117
02:28:48,190 --> 02:28:55,580
So, I think now Sahaja Yoga is... everywhere
is acceptable, at least in Italy it is now.

118
02:28:55,607 --> 02:28:58,107
And it's a very great thing.

119
02:29:08,409 --> 02:29:12,602
There is something about Italians I've felt always,

120
02:29:12,617 --> 02:29:19,222
that they are very simple-hearted people, good people and also something like Indians.

121
02:29:19,266 --> 02:29:24,992
You see, their ways are different little bit, but they can cheat as much as Indians can cheat.

122
02:29:29,222 --> 02:29:35,382
But Indian cheating is different and
the Italian cheating is another style.

123
02:29:36,186 --> 02:29:43,983
But still, I must say they are very sensitive to
spirituality and they all have great love for Me.

124
02:29:44,003 --> 02:29:49,360
"Madre." All the time they say and they just... I tell you, I am surprised how they accept Me.

125
02:29:49,373 --> 02:29:52,420
This I can't expect from Germans,

126
02:29:52,433 --> 02:29:55,453
I can't expect this from English,

127
02:29:55,453 --> 02:29:57,953
from the France, of course no question.

128
02:30:04,463 --> 02:30:09,914
So the authorities also here are spiritual

129
02:30:09,927 --> 02:30:13,114
and surprisingly, when I was coming from Russia,

130
02:30:13,136 --> 02:30:20,379
in Moscow airport, we met
a very well known designer.

131
02:30:20,415 --> 02:30:22,379
They say he is the guru of designers

132
02:30:22,379 --> 02:30:24,879
and he just asked for his Realisation.

133
02:30:24,879 --> 02:30:29,627
Then another lady came, she is very well
known here, she also asked for Realisation.

134
02:30:29,622 --> 02:30:33,127
Then another gentleman, who was some
sort of a minister or something,

135
02:30:33,127 --> 02:30:37,382
he also asked for his Realisation. Can you imagine?

136
02:30:37,387 --> 02:30:42,407
In what country, people can
ask Realisation like this?

137
02:30:42,417 --> 02:30:46,447
And now they are trying to contact us.

138
02:30:46,465 --> 02:30:49,565
So we are very well placed here in Italy, I think

139
02:30:49,575 --> 02:30:57,845
and I feel quite safe with these people,
because they have respect for Mother.

140
02:30:57,863 --> 02:30:59,933
They have respect for children

141
02:30:59,977 --> 02:31:04,603
and that the Ganesh Puja should be
here is a very, very, good thing,

142
02:31:04,643 --> 02:31:10,098
because the respect for children is
as mush as in India, maybe more.

143
02:31:10,103 --> 02:31:13,918
In this country you don't
find funny things happening.

144
02:31:13,947 --> 02:31:19,658
So tomorrow again, we will
have a nice session of Puja,

145
02:31:19,648 --> 02:31:24,362
but Sandesh is the one, I would say,

146
02:31:24,362 --> 02:31:30,658
for whom I must thank him, because I was
thinking his hands would be paining now.

147
02:31:33,167 --> 02:31:37,421
We have known him very well and
every time he plays something new.

148
02:31:37,433 --> 02:31:44,283
He is working so hard and he
has achieved such excellence.

149
02:31:44,313 --> 02:31:48,023
Now about Avi, I don't know what to say,

150
02:31:48,038 --> 02:31:50,538
because he is nothing but creativity personified.

151
02:31:50,538 --> 02:31:52,275
I don't know...

152
02:31:52,295 --> 02:31:56,815
Baba Mama told me, "I don't know how he
creates things, how it comes to him."

153
02:31:56,814 --> 02:32:04,368
and such creation of this
raga, is not so easy you know.

154
02:32:04,384 --> 02:32:06,884
It just has so much expansion.

155
02:32:06,884 --> 02:32:15,149
But the way he changed every
time, a new sort of a composition.

156
02:32:15,139 --> 02:32:21,389
But they don't have anybody like Vivaldi
or 'Waldi' or anyone in front of them

157
02:32:21,386 --> 02:32:24,860
and the way he was really, I tell you...

158
02:32:24,893 --> 02:32:27,153
I don't know how to say,

159
02:32:27,153 --> 02:32:33,383
but I am so lucky that even in this country
I can hear and enjoy such nice music

160
02:32:33,392 --> 02:32:36,303
and that you all are enjoying such nice music,

161
02:32:36,303 --> 02:32:39,773
thanks to these four young people.

162
02:32:39,782 --> 02:32:46,341
Now, because it was Ganesha's
Day, we are celebrating here,

163
02:32:46,370 --> 02:32:49,631
I thought we should get all the
young people who are not yet married.

164
02:32:49,658 --> 02:32:53,663
But I am told here, Avi is getting married, so
next year he will not come for Ganesha Puja,

165
02:32:53,683 --> 02:32:56,183
but can come for another Puja.

166
02:32:57,825 --> 02:33:01,165
And Sandesh, I don't know why
he doesn't want to get married.

167
02:33:04,007 --> 02:33:07,276
So it was not to be done by married people,

168
02:33:07,321 --> 02:33:12,156
but Baba Mama sent somebody from
there to show what they have achieved

169
02:33:12,162 --> 02:33:15,738
And this Nick has married an Indian lady

170
02:33:15,749 --> 02:33:19,869
and that was really remarkable.

171
02:33:19,869 --> 02:33:23,789
So, we all should give them a big, big, big hand.

172
02:33:53,442 --> 02:33:59,882
Now I am sorry for this cold weather, suddenly
it has come, I think, with Russians I think.

173
02:34:02,422 --> 02:34:05,972
In Russia, I was dressed up
like an Eskimo all the time.

174
02:34:07,518 --> 02:34:17,395
And this is a very cold today, but I think daytime will be good tomorrow and also it might improve a little bit.

175
02:34:17,414 --> 02:34:23,896
There is one thing I have to explain,
because Michael Fogarty asked me a question

176
02:34:23,910 --> 02:34:30,426
that, "What is the tradition? Is the Classical
Music is first or the other thing is?"

177
02:34:30,426 --> 02:34:33,392
Actually, we have changed it a little bit here.

178
02:34:33,392 --> 02:34:45,152
Why? Because they come out with very good films and last time they showed us a very beautiful film from America,

179
02:34:45,162 --> 02:34:50,612
and all their programmes were very
good, but they needed darkness.

180
02:34:50,610 --> 02:34:55,482
So we started their programme
after 10 o'clock or 10.30,

181
02:34:55,482 --> 02:35:01,472
because then we said all right, the classical music
we can have even in the daytime doesn't matter,

182
02:35:01,505 --> 02:35:04,042
So we changed, but today is the other way round,

183
02:35:04,082 --> 02:35:09,632
somebody came to see me and I was delayed
also and it became dark very fast.

184
02:35:09,650 --> 02:35:16,202
So I don't know what to do now. You changed
according to the need and here it is.

185
02:35:16,208 --> 02:35:21,961
I hope you people do not mind the second shift.

186
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:32,300
One thing about classical music
is, that it does settle you down

187
02:35:32,333 --> 02:35:40,656
and to me, it's nice to have
something classical first,

188
02:35:40,671 --> 02:35:43,171
not all, but a little bit at least.

189
02:35:43,171 --> 02:35:48,270
It helps, helps us to meditate
and to come to the proper mood,

190
02:35:48,270 --> 02:35:52,980
but today it was in this way and I
hope you all enjoyed it very much.

191
02:35:53,017 --> 02:35:55,517
So now the second shift is there.

192
02:35:55,517 --> 02:36:00,132
There's going to be an interval for
about 5-10 minutes and after that,

193
02:36:00,138 --> 02:36:08,506
we will start the second one and hero
is Alex, who is going to do the job.
