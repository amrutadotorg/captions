1
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:16,650
Shri Ganesha Gauri Puja

2
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:20,843
Sydney, Australia

3
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:24,837
April 4, 1981

4
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:41,179
Today is a very unique thing that is happened,

5
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:48,222
is a special luck for Sahaja yogis of Australia.

6
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,110
This day has never been celebrated before

7
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,866
in the history of Sahaja Yoga.

8
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:59,272
Today is the New Year’s Day for Sahaja yogis,

9
00:01:59,473 --> 00:02:06,747
because this is the New Year’s Day

10
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:09,750
of the Shalivahan calendar.

11
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:14,243
As you know, Shalivahan is My dynasty,

12
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:16,768
and they are called as Shalivahan

13
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,598
because they are the carriers of the shawls of the Goddess,

14
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,724
they are called as the, because as you are also carrying

15
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:26,697
so many times My shawls around.

16
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,203
And they were called as Shalivahan.

17
00:02:29,404 --> 00:02:38,119
So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess,

18
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,324
the nine days there are.

19
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:49,814
Then in another times that there are Satya Yug,

20
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:55,130
then there’s Dvapara, Treta, Kali Yuga: there are four yugas.

21
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:59,792
So in two yugas the Goddess incarnated,

22
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:04,146
one before the Satya Yuga and one after it.

23
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:11,075
So today is the day to mark absolutely the first day

24
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:15,596
when She incarnated on this Earth.

25
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:19,848
That’s the day also of the Gauri,

26
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:24,869
because Virgin is the first form of the Goddess.

27
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:39,523
And She created also Ganesha on Tuesday,

28
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:42,919
just starting this week.

29
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,723
What is the day? The day today is …?

30
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:47,178
[Today’s the fourth.]

31
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:48,379
 Today ….

32
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,021
[Saturday, Mother.]

33
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:53,740
[Saturday.]

34
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:57,969
Saturday. Now, now, it’s over. Now don’t stay, all right?

35
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,375
While I’m speaking you should not take My photographs.

36
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:03,287
It’s a very wrong idea, because it disturbs Me.

37
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:06,255
Moreover, you see, when the speaking, while I’m speaking

38
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:07,590
and when you take My photograph

39
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,454
sometimes I’ve seen they come out very odd.

40
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:12,820
Best take photographs when I’m not speaking, you see,

41
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:16,496
because all the time the sound is coming, everybody is distracted

42
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:18,809
and the attention doesn’t fix, you see.

43
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,245
Is a very important thing I’m talking, all right?

44
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:24,456
Now don’t take any photographs, please.

45
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:27,813
Pay attention to what I’m saying.

46
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,114
[Hindi]

47
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:45,579
So Tuesday is the day when Ganesha was established,

48
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,254
and then the Goddess started working.

49
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:58,392
The first one, the one day when She started is, was the Wednesday.

50
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:01,237
She started working out on Wednesday.

51
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:04,316
Wednesday is the action day,

52
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:07,107
that’s why she started on Wednesday.

53
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:11,484
Today is, under the circumstances it is Saturday;

54
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:16,052
but I’m telling you about the original timings.

55
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:22,864
Because Wednesday is the day of the Swadisthana,

56
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:27,588
that’s the day She started working it out, the whole thing.

57
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:32,193
So first, Tuesday is the first day in Sahaja Yoga,

58
00:05:32,394 --> 00:05:34,986
Wednesday is the second day.

59
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:39,919
And you’ll be surprised that the stars are also the same,

60
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,571
because Tuesday is the day of the Mars

61
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:49,389
which is resided by Shri Ganesh.

62
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:56,655
Wednesday is the day of Mercury, and Mercury is the Swadisthana.

63
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:07,667
Third day – yes – third day is the day of Jupiter:

64
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,157
what you call, we call it guru, is the day of the guru,

65
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:14,873
is the Jupiter, is the teacher.

66
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:20,275
Now, Friday is the day of the Goddess.

67
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:23,814
Now see the chakras also, of the Goddess,

68
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:27,103
Mother of the Earth, Mother of the Universe,

69
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,546
Venus.

70
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:35,111
But in Indian Sanskrit language the names of the days

71
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:40,577
are exactly the same, tallying with the stars,

72
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:48,713
Then Saturday is the day of Shri Krishna, Shani, is Saturn.

73
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:57,206
Then Sunday is the day of Christ, the Sun.

74
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:03,863
Monday is the day of Sadashiva,

75
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:07,665
is of realization, of integration.

76
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:13,033
These are the seven days when God created the whole universe.

77
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:18,468
That’s what I told yesterday, that in this narrow way

78
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:20,875
you cannot understand Christianity.

79
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:24,888
You’ll think it’s all mad, which is not.

80
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:27,928
Only when you read other things, other scriptures,

81
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,324
then only you will understand what Christ said.

82
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,605
So today is the day of – first day –

83
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:40,264
of when Ganesha was created,

84
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:47,600
in the sense that, though today is not a Tuesday,

85
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:53,403
but according to dates of the moon,

86
00:07:53,604 --> 00:08:01,225
today is the day, first day of the moon in this month.

87
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:02,961
[Marathi]

88
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:07,036
Chaitra. We call it Chaitra. Chaitra is the month.

89
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,970
And this is the time when –

90
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:12,651
[Marathi]

91
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,656
Gauri is the Chaitra.

92
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:22,074
So the establishment of the Gauri

93
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:24,962
is taken place during these nine days.

94
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:29,097
But Ganesha has to be established before anything else.

95
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:31,626
Though first Gauri had to come,

96
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:37,225
you can see that. Gauri had to come first to establish Ganesha.

97
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:41,467
But Ganesha is always put before even Gauri.

98
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:48,016
Before the pujana of the, worship of the Ganesha,

99
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:50,003
nothing starts;

100
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:53,369
because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles,

101
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,339
all the negativities,

102
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,049
all the hurdles that are going to come up,

103
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,992
all the attentions that are here and there.

104
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:06,728
So that’s why we first worship Ganesha,

105
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:09,684
just to ask Him to protect us.

106
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:11,647
But first the Gauri has to come,

107
00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:16,694
and that’s how the Gauri is this nine days.

108
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:23,827
She came on this Earth to fight the devils and demons,

109
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:31,897
negativity, for people to transcend

110
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:36,695
the Bhavasagara, the Void,

111
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:40,465
the maya, the illusion.

112
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:44,914
When they were praying, when they were doing anything,

113
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:47,799
people used to obstruct

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,147
and then they troubled the bhaktas, the devotees of God.

115
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:59,689
Rakshasas, in those days the rakshasas were separate

116
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,575
and the saints were separate;

117
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:05,573
there was not such a mixture as it is today.

118
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:09,054
We find in saints there are negativities sitting there.

119
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:12,437
Was never so before. This is Kali Yuga.

120
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:15,476
It’s such a confusion that there is no absolute saint

121
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:18,070
or there’s no absolute rakshasas.

122
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:21,486
These rakshasas have come and sitting in our heads.

123
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,332
They are within us, so the negativity is there,

124
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:27,154
so we are not absolute saints.

125
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:30,609
 And this is the big problem of Sahaja Yoga is, that

126
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,873
even when you are worshipping Me,

127
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:37,244
try to be more on the saints than on the negative side.

128
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:40,690
Try to be more on the saintly side.

129
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,170
Because you are saints, no doubt,

130
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:47,114
but these horrible things have somehow or other

131
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,723
gone into your heads and they are sitting in

132
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:53,633
your superego and ego, these horrible negativities,

133
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:57,664
which you must really decide today to throw them away.

134
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:03,117
Because you are really saints and these are the bad spots,

135
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:05,477
kalanka.

136
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:08,897
Is the thing that really ruins you, is within you.

137
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:13,008
So try to throw it away; try to become positive,

138
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,783
be one with the puja.

139
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:23,112
The second thing is the importance of this day is,

140
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:29,626
that I have never celebrated this first day anywhere, so far.

141
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,776
It was to be in Australia.

142
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:37,770
It is the right of Australia to have this day here,

143
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:40,611
celebrated here.

144
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,595
We had other pujas, other Navaratris we had;

145
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:54,113
with that I celebrated the first, second, third,

146
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,970
over nine days we have done.

147
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:58,163
But never this Navaratri as such

148
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:02,313
we have celebrated this day anywhere, of the Shalivahana.

149
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:06,323
Though in London they had a little sort of a thing on this, which I,

150
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:10,309
we had on the seventh of April, then I spoke about it;

151
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,867
but actually on this day we had no puja, before.

152
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:22,513
So, this is very creditable that it should happen here.

153
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:29,676
I’m very happy, because this is where Gauri established Shri Ganesh.

154
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:41,454
Now for today we have two things to be worshipped:

155
00:12:41,655 --> 00:12:48,803
one, Ganesha, because Ganesha can preserve our status,

156
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:52,654
our heights,

157
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,631
in our realization.

158
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:57,798
He protects us when we are getting our realization,

159
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,068
we are rising high;

160
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,653
so He preserves and He protects.

161
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:10,667
And He looks after us and gives us wisdom,

162
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:16,614
to have our ascent in such a way

163
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:21,123
that we do not deviate into the left and the right side;

164
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:24,139
we have full dignity;

165
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:30,036
and that we are fully integrated with our heart,

166
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:33,584
with Shiva Tattwa, with our realization,

167
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:37,010
and do it with our heart genuinely.

168
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:40,953
That’s why we worship Shri Ganesh.

169
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,474
But today is actually the puja of the Gauri,

170
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:47,982
that is, the Kundalini.

171
00:13:48,183 --> 00:13:51,518
So Shri Ganesh we’ll do first of all,

172
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:55,657
and then we’ll worship the Kundalini, which is the Gauri.

173
00:13:55,883 --> 00:14:01,611
Now luckily I got a sari: this is really remarkable,

174
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:05,346
because this is the color of Australia.

175
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:09,642
Green is the color of the Gauri. Gauri wears the green sari.

176
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:13,636
And there is also – this is the, this is the,

177
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:17,350
this is the symbol of Gauri only.

178
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:22,902
This is the symbol of Gauri, and this one inside is the Ganesha,

179
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:26,483
is in that color, is most surprising this sari I got.

180
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:28,670
So this one also is just the other way round,

181
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:32,730
more of Ganesha color and less of the Gauri color.

182
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:36,825
This is a very traditional combination

183
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:42,276
in the Indian color scheme, because red is the color of Ganesha.

184
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:50,519
In you people it is very red and it can become more crimson,

185
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,957
can become absolutely black,

186
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:57,070
can be absolutely reduced to nothing.

187
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:06,720
But in Me it is the color of this clay,

188
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:10,285
because it’s absolutely obedient, it’s absolutely one with Me,

189
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:15,509
so it’s the color of the clay. And the Gauri is the Mother Earth.

190
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:21,470
That’s the place where the Gauri exists, in the Mother Earth;

191
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,813
and that’s why the color is green

192
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:27,053
because Mother Earth is always covered with green,

193
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:30,508
at least She’s covered with.

194
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:34,579
And Ganesha’s color is that of the clay

195
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,453
because He’s made out of the Mother Earth,

196
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:40,739
element is the Mother Earth.

197
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:47,865
I hope I have been able to explain to you the symbolic relationship.

198
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:52,634
Do you know the story how Ganesha was created by Gauri?

199
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:55,578
So that I will tell you; and then we all can have.

200
00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:00,864
It’s very interesting, that’s why I said I’ll have My bath here.

201
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:03,073
It is said this ….

202
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:06,702
[Excuse me, Mother, we can’t hear very well down the back.]

203
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:09,382
[Is there any way You can speak louder or that we can hear better?]

204
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,442
What’s she say?

205
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:11,536
[They cannot hear.]

206
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,962
 You can’t hear Me?e …]

207
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:14,163
[Yogini: No, Mother.]

208
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:18,112
 All right, so I’ll have to shout.

209
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:19,989
Not at all?

210
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,540
[Yogini: Yes, a little, most of the time...]

211
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:24,458
All right. Should I use this?

212
00:16:26,124 --> 00:16:29,030
 All right. This you can hear.

213
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:37,259
So I’m now going to tell you

214
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,405
the story of Shri Ganesha’s birth.

215
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:44,972
Is very interesting, it’s very symbolic. This is Christ, and that is,

216
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:49,317
He is the Omega and He is the Alpha and all that they talk of,

217
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:51,765
they don’t know what they are talking.

218
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:55,558
There’s so short form of what the whole thing is.

219
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,188
They don’t know Ganesha at all, nothing.

220
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:03,599
They just take one word here and there, just talk like that.

221
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:09,125
So He’s the first one created.

222
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,506
Now it’s very symbolic:

223
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:15,779
the pure power

224
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:23,480
of desire to be one with the spirit is symbolized in the Gauri.

225
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:28,286
The primordial Gauri is that power

226
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:32,461
which has separated from Her Lord,

227
00:17:32,658 --> 00:17:35,486
we can say.

228
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:39,959
In Her previous lives She was separated,

229
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,822
and again She’s born as Parvati.

230
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:49,491
And She wants to be one with Shiva, which is the Spirit.

231
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:53,824
So now the marriage has taken place,

232
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:57,758
in the sense that now She can meet Him.

233
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:01,404
The wedding kindling has to start.

234
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:03,784
But She’s not yet married,

235
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:05,870
in the sense that She’s still a Virgin,

236
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:14,315
but married otherwise – means She is now about to rise.

237
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:18,742
Before that She wants to have a bath,

238
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:21,883
because She has to meet Her Lord.

239
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:25,632
So She must have Her bath, the bridal bath.

240
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:30,997
She’s a virgin, absolutely virgin, and She goes for Her bath.

241
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,953
Now, She’s afraid that anybody might come inside

242
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:38,075
when She’s having Her bath.

243
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,244
Look at the delicacy of the whole thing:

244
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:46,154
this desire, which just is meant for the spirit,

245
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:48,632
doesn’t want to be exposed to anything else,

246
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,450
any negativity coming in, anything happening like that.

247
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:56,545
So She closes the door,

248
00:18:56,746 --> 00:19:01,597
but still She’s worried from the back side somebody may come.

249
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:12,846
So She puts this scented powder, which we use in India,

250
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:16,329
for the bride specially it is the right one,

251
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,283
and rubs Her body with that, and She finds

252
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:22,693
that a lot of it comes out. So She makes the Ganesha out of that,

253
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:27,151
now imagine how much vibrated it must be.

254
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:33,687
She puts that – is made of camphor

255
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:37,859
and all these beautiful things which are really celestial –

256
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,599
and that is completely vibrated on Her body.

257
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,339
She makes a Ganesha and puts Him to the back of the bathroom;

258
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:51,571
She’s having Her bath nicely.

259
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:56,869
At that time Shiva comes suddenly, knocks at the door.

260
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,421
She doesn’t hear Him.

261
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:05,504
So He goes from the back door. There
He sees Shri Ganesha sitting.

262
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:08,787
He asks Shri Ganesha, “Who are You?”

263
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:13,577
So He says, “I am the Son of Gauri.”

264
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,538
Shiva can’t understand; She is a Virgin

265
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:19,602
and this one is saying, “I am the Son of the Gauri.”

266
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:23,672
See now the Immaculate Conception,

267
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:26,191
try to understand.

268
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:34,338
So Shiva says, “How can She have a child? She is the Virgin.”

269
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:39,341
And He thinks [She’s] He’s bringing slander on His wife who is a Virgin.

270
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:44,053
So He cuts His neck in anger,

271
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:46,856
and He enters into the bathroom.

272
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:50,937
And Gauri is ready to receive Him.

273
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:55,083
And She looks out and She sees Her child is dead.

274
00:20:55,284 --> 00:21:00,088
So He asked Her, “What is this?”

275
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:05,017
Said, “That’s My child I created out of My, this mala” –

276
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:08,255
what you call this, all the body things that came out –

277
00:21:08,456 --> 00:21:12,134
“I’ve created Him, and I have put Him down there.

278
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:15,163
How dare You kill Him?”

279
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,552
She said, “ Now what to do?”

280
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:20,364
He said, “All right, what You do is to go

281
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:28,129
and find the head of any animal that is available,

282
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,481
and we will put that on this trunk

283
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:36,297
and He’ll be My son again.”

284
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:40,657
Now it’s all prearranged;

285
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:44,776
because this child was not to grow into

286
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:47,859
a human ego and superego business.

287
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,231
It had to be the embodiment of childhood,

288
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:57,767
embodiment of childlike innocence,

289
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:01,016
because He’s the embodiment of innocence.

290
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:04,778
So they had to get the head of an animal.

291
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:13,904
Now the wisest animal on this Earth is elephant,

292
00:22:14,105 --> 00:22:17,676
and elephant was saved in evolution in a very miraculous way,

293
00:22:17,877 --> 00:22:21,603
is also another description which I’ll give you later on.

294
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:25,721
So a she-elephant, mother elephant

295
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:29,805
was lying down with her back towards her child,

296
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:33,553
that’s why in India women never sleep with their back

297
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:35,897
towards their children, never.

298
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:39,734
The child has to be in front, pudhe, in front.

299
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:43,227
It should never be put at the back of the mother, never.

300
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,948
Mother will get up and go on the other side and change the sides,

301
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:49,717
but she would never put the child at the back.

302
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:53,613
So the head of that little animal was cut,

303
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:57,832
and He brought it and was put for Shri Ganesh.

304
00:22:58,033 --> 00:23:01,829
And that’s how Shri Ganesha was created.

305
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:11,411
But you know, elephant is the conveyance of Mahalakshmi.

306
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:17,363
So the body is from Mahakali,

307
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:23,064
but the head is given by Mahalakshmi, the evolutionary power.

308
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:35,127
Now this Ganesha within us resides

309
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:38,328
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

310
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:43,633
Some people who tried all kinds of tricks to find God

311
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:50,154
must have seen the trunk of Shri Ganesha,

312
00:23:50,355 --> 00:23:52,965
and must have thought this is the kundalini,

313
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,632
because as a Mother I give them few marks for that,

314
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:59,411
and that’s how they started all these perversions

315
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:02,058
and wrong things about Ganesha.

316
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,841
But He is embodiment of innocence,

317
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:10,449
and later on you must read in “Devi Bhagwat”

318
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:16,657
how He incarnated on this Earth as Christ;

319
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:20,769
and how He is going to come with His eleven powers

320
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,744
on this Earth as Kalki.

321
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:26,587
It is very difficult for Hindus to accept that Ganesha,

322
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:28,752
such a dynamic personality like Him,

323
00:24:28,953 --> 00:24:32,403
should become a person like Christ, who got Himself crucified.

324
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:34,323
And it is impossible,

325
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:36,552
at least Hindus have much wider knowledge

326
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:41,738
and much wider sense, but it is impossible for ardent Christians

327
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:47,742
to understand that Christ could be this elephant boy.

328
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:52,097
That is beyond them, because for them Christ should be a man

329
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:56,238
who has no power to kill anyone.

330
00:24:56,698 --> 00:24:59,937
And then they say that He’s coming to kill us,

331
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,704
I don’t know how they manage these things.

332
00:25:05,846 --> 00:25:08,316
They catch hold of one thing,

333
00:25:08,517 --> 00:25:10,790
like He was the Omega and Alpha, finished;

334
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:14,486
now how are they authorized, God knows?

335
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:18,087
But whatever it is, they do not see the other things,

336
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:21,466
that He had a Mother; He said about the Holy Spirit.

337
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,711
He said it in such a good way,

338
00:25:23,912 --> 00:25:27,683
that “I’ll be sending Holy Spirit.” And also He said

339
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:31,223
that “Those who are,

340
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:34,214
those who have sinned against Me or have insulted Me,

341
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:37,164
it’s all right, but with the Holy Spirit nothing will be tolerated”,

342
00:25:37,365 --> 00:25:41,048
very clearly. Why did He say so?

343
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:45,262
He’s Alpha and Omega, but why did He say so?

344
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:48,038
Of course, He’s the first who was created,

345
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:51,050
and at this stage, at Kalki stage also it is He who,

346
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:54,249
He’s there at the end of it, no doubt.

347
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,340
But that doesn’t mean because you are Christians

348
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:59,325
you have a special right.

349
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:02,278
Not at all. On the contrary, I would say many Hindus

350
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:06,762
have much more right on Ganesha than you have,

351
00:26:06,963 --> 00:26:11,150
because you have spoilt your innocence.

352
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:15,114
They have not spoilt their innocence.

353
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,257
So though you may call yourself Christians,

354
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:21,363
Christians and fight for Christ, but you are not;

355
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:24,109
because the basics of Christ is innocence,

356
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,859
which we have ruined.

357
00:26:27,698 --> 00:26:30,817
So those who – also Sahaja yogis – get identified

358
00:26:31,018 --> 00:26:34,111
with Christ must know that this identification is actually

359
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:36,657
a conditioning;

360
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,114
it is not factually so. If so, you have to become innocent.

361
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:45,958
You must re-establish your innocence.

362
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,481
Then you are really Christians, and then you are really so.

363
00:26:51,682 --> 00:26:55,097
And I would say people in India – as it is, you know,

364
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:59,494
luckily we did not get advanced as you people got.

365
00:26:59,695 --> 00:27:03,383
We never fall into the traps of advancement, luckily:

366
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:06,333
too sluggish, elephant-like people,

367
00:27:06,534 --> 00:27:09,241
we could not fall into anything.

368
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:12,812
India is like, large like an elephant.

369
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:15,820
 Anything comes in, this just goes on throwing this side,

370
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:17,908
that side, that doesn’t accept anything.

371
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:20,637
We never bothered about Freud. For us he’s some sort of

372
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:23,649
a legendary fellow living in fool’s paradise,

373
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,803
we never accepted him.

374
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:29,182
Nothing can penetrate that elephantine thing.

375
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:33,622
You see, it just goes on blowing off all the things that comes round,

376
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,982
so nothing got into their heads.

377
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:38,017
They never spoiled their innocence,

378
00:27:38,218 --> 00:27:41,577
simply because they are too large and very lethargic

379
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:44,538
to new ideas.

380
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,722
And that’s how they have, despite everything

381
00:27:48,938 --> 00:27:50,797
they are not converted Christians,

382
00:27:50,998 --> 00:27:52,822
they never heard of Christ, some of them.

383
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:56,178
They have maintained their innocence much more

384
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:58,870
and their sincerity of their heart,

385
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:01,560
because they are not disconnected.

386
00:28:01,778 --> 00:28:03,897
When Ganesha is destroyed you get disconnected.

387
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:08,046
Your heart works on one side, your brain works on another side.

388
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:10,977
So, that they have not been able to yet achieve,

389
00:28:11,178 --> 00:28:14,178
that kind of a dissociation. And whatever they may try,

390
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:16,923
they know in their – that it is wrong.

391
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:18,921
They may try, I mean, like people steal

392
00:28:19,122 --> 00:28:23,124
but they know it is wrong; in the same way they still know.

393
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:28,667
So for us, we must know that we have to achieve

394
00:28:28,868 --> 00:28:35,391
our position as innocent people.

395
00:28:35,645 --> 00:28:38,941
But your Mother is very gracious,

396
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:42,746
She’s very powerful, She’s very loving,

397
00:28:42,947 --> 00:28:49,790
and She has created you on the same pattern as Ganesha.

398
00:28:50,013 --> 00:28:53,237
You have all the powers that Shri Ganesha has.

399
00:28:53,438 --> 00:28:55,985
The greatest power that Shri Ganesha has,

400
00:28:56,186 --> 00:28:59,936
that you can come so close to Me.

401
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:05,801
No other gods can come that close to Me as you can come.

402
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:14,166
Kundalini cannot be risen by any gods, any incarnations

403
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:17,421
but Shri Ganesha.

404
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:24,152
He has to inform the kundalini, otherwise kundalini cannot rise.

405
00:29:24,498 --> 00:29:28,907
And it is you who have the power to raise the kundalini

406
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:31,538
on your fingers. How many powers I have given you.

407
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:34,959
you have no idea at all.

408
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:41,199
I have made you in the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

409
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:45,158
So you have to establish that innocence within you;

410
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,811
that is being also established.

411
00:29:48,012 --> 00:29:50,502
You’ll get back your innocence.

412
00:29:50,703 --> 00:29:54,599
But the second thing which is so important about Shri Ganesh

413
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,165
one has to learn, that

414
00:29:56,366 --> 00:30:00,649
He does not know any other god but His Mother.

415
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,803
For Him nothing exists but His Mother.

416
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,593
He’s so dedicated.

417
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:12,159
There’s a story once when Parvati,

418
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,039
His Mother gave –

419
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:21,333
said that “I will give You a big present,

420
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:24,380
that there should be competition between You two brothers.”

421
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:28,545
Second was the Kartikeya, the one, another brother of His

422
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:32,847
who came on this Earth just to destroy this Narakasura.

423
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:35,947
Is the, all the destructive powers

424
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:38,896
were combined to create Kartikeya.

425
00:30:39,097 --> 00:30:44,594
So She said, “Whosoever goes round this Earth,

426
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:47,638
I’ll give You a prize.”

427
00:30:48,438 --> 00:30:53,752
So, the conveyance of

428
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:57,360
Kartikeya is such a fast one, is a peacock.

429
00:30:57,561 --> 00:31:01,943
So He got onto His peacock, started flying out like an aeroplane.

430
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:07,423
And Shri Ganesha’s conveyance is just a little mouse,

431
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:10,842
so what should He do? He took to wisdom.

432
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:14,988
He said, “Who can be greater than My Mother?

433
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:17,977
She has created all the gods.

434
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:21,270
She’s the Mahakali, She’s the Adi Shakti.

435
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:24,123
She has created all the gods, She has created all the universes,

436
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:27,307
She’s the one who has done everything, who can be greater than Her?

437
00:31:27,508 --> 00:31:31,665
She’s the greatest of all.” So she just, He just went round Her

438
00:31:31,866 --> 00:31:34,719
only thrice and He got the prize.

439
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,177
And still He was flying in the air, Kartikeya.

440
00:31:39,474 --> 00:31:42,802
He fought even Shiva.

441
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,947
He fought everyone.

442
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:49,417
It’s a very interesting story how all that happened,

443
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:53,407
that shows complete dedication.

444
00:31:53,608 --> 00:31:55,732
 And for Sahaja yogis

445
00:31:55,933 --> 00:32:01,379
it is important to understand complete surrendering, dedication,

446
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:07,853
and also a genuine feeling from the heart.

447
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:13,731
I will ask Raul Bai sometimes to talk to you about the protocol,

448
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,299
that’s important, though I am so close.

449
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:23,220
Even Christ would not say anything;

450
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:28,569
sometimes the way you people talk to Me, I am amazed.

451
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:31,188
Certain things you say to Me, I’m amazed:

452
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:36,064
how can you say these things to Me, knowingly what I am?

453
00:32:36,265 --> 00:32:39,304
But you forget.

454
00:32:39,547 --> 00:32:45,191
So it is important to understand that they were great

455
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:50,289
because they knew the greatness of their Mother.

456
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,850
In the same way, you all have to learn certain protocols

457
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:56,488
which Raul Bai will teach you,

458
00:32:56,689 --> 00:33:00,501
so that you do not make any mistakes

459
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:03,496
of saying things which are not proper.

460
00:33:03,697 --> 00:33:05,822
It comes from bad Vishuddhi, no doubt,

461
00:33:06,023 --> 00:33:08,963
but consciously if you work it out

462
00:33:09,164 --> 00:33:12,359
you will do good to yourself; because you know,

463
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,373
anything against the Holy Spirit won’t be tolerated,

464
00:33:15,574 --> 00:33:19,472
anything, can you believe it?

465
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:23,995
What strong words these are! Just think of it,

466
00:33:24,196 --> 00:33:28,188
anything against the Holy Spirit.

467
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:32,559
So one has to understand the protocol, for Sahaja yogis,

468
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,538
for Sahaja yogis, don’t talk against the Holy Spirit.

469
00:33:37,758 --> 00:33:40,996
But the protocol is there which one must understand,

470
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:44,365
and how far to go, how far to understand

471
00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:50,292
is very, very, absolutely rudimentary for Sahaja Yoga.

472
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,267
So today we have a great day

473
00:33:53,468 --> 00:34:01,038
of Shri Ganesha’s Mother being established, incarnated.

474
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:05,264
Today is the day She had Her bath, we can say,

475
00:34:05,465 --> 00:34:08,734
and that’s why I said I’ll come and have a bath here.

476
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:10,935
About the times and timings,

477
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:13,971
one should know that Mother knows best,

478
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:17,759
and everything works out with the timing properly.

479
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,413
Because the, you know you are, you are ahead of India,

480
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:28,286
and all the timings work out in that way.

481
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:32,069
So everything has to work in the way,

482
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,694
actually the timings are of the moon,

483
00:34:34,895 --> 00:34:37,470
so you don’t have to worry about what is the timing,

484
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:39,552
what time this works out, this thing, that.

485
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:42,162
The watches and all that, in Sahaja Yoga,

486
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:46,809
work out according to My understanding.

487
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,698
So one has to relax and just enjoy the puja.

488
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:55,024
I think today you are going to receive lots of vibrations.

489
00:34:55,225 --> 00:34:57,393
 Just enjoy them, just enjoy them.

490
00:34:57,594 --> 00:35:00,389
And if your ego is there or anything,

491
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:04,152
just ask them to shut up, that’s all.

492
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:07,496
All right?

493
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:11,567
Now, so first we’ll have Ganesha Puja,

494
00:35:11,768 --> 00:35:13,436
as Modi will be doing,

495
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:17,797
and he will be explaining what is to be done.

496
00:35:17,998 --> 00:35:22,013
How Ganesha is pleased with small, small things you will see now.

497
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,714
[Hindi]

498
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:34,968
Who will come for the – children should come for the puja?

499
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:39,165
Let all the children come for the puja.
