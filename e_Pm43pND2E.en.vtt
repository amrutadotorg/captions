00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:06.000
I would like to have some questions from you
about it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.240
And then we’ll see how it works out.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.780
All right?

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.849
And not to be afraid, there’s nothing to
have any fear about kundalini.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.599
Because you must have read such big, big books
saying that kundalini burns you, kundalini

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.599
does this.

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.169
No she is your own mother.

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.409
She doesn’t do anything of the kind.

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.380
These are the people who have never known
what kundalini is.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:36.060
It’s like somebody putting the fingers into
the plug and saying electricity burns you.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:45.680
They are unauthorized people who have done
all this, and that’s how they have suffered.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.769
So any questions please?

00:00:50.769 --> 00:01:00.109
Can’t think; if the kundalini rises above
this you become thoughtless just can’t think.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.600
And when she gets out from here you start
feeling the cool breeze from your head.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.360
Really a cool breeze you feel it and from
your fingers.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.750
As simple as that

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.840
You are still doubting something.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.549
Ask a question.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.020
Can’t hear.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.259
Loudly.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.200
Come, come, come here.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.439
Come

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.910
(Lady inaudible)

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:37.110
All right All right May God bless you sit.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.039
She is saying that have you to pray to kundalini?

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.510
No nothing you don’t have to.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:55.009
You see prayer before realization has no meaning
it’s like telephoning without connection.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.899
There’s nothing to pray nothing to pray
nothing to pray.

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:12.190
(Lady inaudible) Can you come here?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:41.430
(Man: I think everybody has got a question
to ask but they don’t know how to ask you)

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.030
They don’t want to?

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.730
What, What Questions?

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.240
Ask now What is there?

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.320
What is you don’t know?

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.170
I know English at least so ask me any question
in English.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.370
Now what did you say?

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.370
(Lady)

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.560
Oh very good question.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.120
That’s a good question.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.670
That’s a good one.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.150
Yes sit down sit down sit down.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.210
She asked me a question if it is awakened
can it die out?

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.250
It doesn’t.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.040
Once it is awakened it goes up it opens out.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.080
But, but is there.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:34.552
At the first shot you see it goes really in
a big way you get it in a really big way.

00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:35.552
You remember.

00:03:35.552 --> 00:03:42.700
But then it goes back and looks after other
parts where there’s a problem so the force

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.750
is reduced.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:53.410
But then you have to learn how to keep the
force there and how to raise it and this is

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.630
called as vidya, called as the knowledge.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.820
How to raise the kundalini….

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:05.330
Side B: ….What is all this about?

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.230
So that part you have to know.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.890
I am here to decode it.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.610
Somebody come and told me, Mother I feel here
tickling, all the time tickling, I said this

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.079
centre is not all right you have to open this
centre.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.060
Now how to open this centre then I had to
tell that person you have to do this very

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.060
simple method.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.810
You see certain movements, because it is flowing
from your hands, certain movements how to

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.490
do it, which are the deities on different
centers if you come to know about it.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.360
For example this centre is the centre of Christ.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.800
Between the optic chiasm is placed a very
subtle centre of Christ.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.620
In the Indian scriptures He is called as Maha
Vishnu.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.789
Now He was born on this earth to suck the
ego and superego.

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:57.319
His crucifixion was there to suck our sins
means the ego and the superego.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.880
But He is to be awakened.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.620
Unless and until He’s awakened it cannot
happen you go to church or you pray to Him

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.620
nothing will happen.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.870
But if kundalini goes and stops there, and
if you say Lord’s Prayer, it will rise.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.280
Is the proof that it is Christ’s centre.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:23.509
Now this very important point that He should
be awakened that Christ was for this was never

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.659
known to Christians.

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.080
It’s a living process.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.590
He said I’m a living God.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:37.900
And when they went to India the way they talked
about Christianity was something absurd.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.289
So Hindus still believe that this one who
has to redeem us has to come.

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.990
They don’t know that He’s already born
and crucified and He’s the one.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.710
He is Maha Vishnu who is described in Devi
Mahatmyam very, very clearly.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.229
He was specially made.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.680
Who was His father; who was His mother all
described.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.759
But the people who know English have no repor
with our ancient scriptures and those who

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:10.919
went from here have no repor with Christ.

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.940
That He’s to be awakened within us.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.419
He said I am to be born.

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:21.849
And how to awaken it nobody knew only through
kundalini you can do it.

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:27.080
He said, it’s said in the bible I’ll appear
before you like tongues of flames.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.039
Now what are these tongues of flames?

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.029
Go and ask these people.

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:37.400
These Jews do they know?

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:45.090
Mohammed has very clearly said that you are
to become a peer; you have to be born again.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:53.469
I mean namas is one of the very good ways
of raising the kundalini, if you are using

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:55.490
the Sahaja Yoga method.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.410
Means you get your realization and then you
do namas.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.320
You’ll be amazed.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.400
Everything has a meaning only when it is a
living thing.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.809
Otherwise it’s dummy.

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:08.360
Everything is a dummy stuff you see like this
is a dummy thing.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.879
I shout at it or do whatever you like its
not going to work.

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:20.110
That’s why everything is a dummy and that’s
why people say oh Christianity is wrong.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.969
If you go to the Muslims they will say the
Jews are wrong.

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:27.070
The Jews will say the Muslims are wrong, the
Hindus are wrong.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.470
I mean they are all blaming each other.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.780
If you have to learn about yourself better
go to the other party.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.360
But they are all dummies.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.469
Once you get realized you will know they are
all connected with each other absolutely one

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:45.150
there’s complete harmony and concord.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.909
Christ Himself has said those who are not
against Me are with Me.

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:55.270
Now go and ask these priests who are those
who are not against Him; who are with Him.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:02.719
I mean, He was not even given sufficient time
only for four years He could talk and He was

00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:03.719
killed.

00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:08.779
Everywhere they have done a nice pickling
up of all these great people.

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:21.550
But Sahaja Yoga completely exposes their advents,
their purpose, their places within us and

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:27.630
also establishes all the fundamental things
that are described in all the scriptures and

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.599
their core relationships.

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:33.930
It’s such a fantastic thing.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.120
How it establishes?

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.210
By proving it.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.290
I’ll tell you one example, a simple example.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.791
There was a gentleman from Iran he was a doctor
he came to see me.

00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:47.850
I mean it is now we cannot contact him because
he’s in Iran.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.510
But he came to see me he was a Muslim.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:56.030
And I told him that Mohammed Sahib was born
as Nanak Sahib in India.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.030
He could not believe it.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.030
He said how can it be?

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:03.390
Though Nanak Sahib had said it in a way, because
Nanak Sahib was sleeping and somebody told

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.650
Him that you are placing your feet towards
Mecca he said all right I’ll turn my feet

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.770
to other side and the Mecca came that side.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.820
He said I can’t believe it’ I can’t
believe it.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.290
I said but Mohammed Sahib Has said that He
is the last.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:24.200
I said I’m not sure of that but maybe He
must have decided to come back the way people

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.200
are.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200
He could not believe it.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:34.760
And he had stomach cancer, which is caused
by one of the reasons is fanaticism.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.980
I told him you have to believe in Him.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:43.130
He was one of the incarnations of the Primordial
Master and He was the same Abraham was the

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.150
same Moses was the same Socrates was the same.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.460
And you have to believe it.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.780
He said I can’t believe it.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.100
I said I can’t cure you.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.070
Then he went back and he was very sick.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.580
His wife said now what is there after all,
you see, we became Muslims because our parents

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.070
were Muslims and they told us Mohammed Sahib
was the last.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.790
After all you are to be saved.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:06.540
Then he came and said all right Mother whatever
you say I’m going to say.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.780
I said now you pray to Nanak Sahib instead
of Mohammed Sahib because it is Mohammed Sahib

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.270
who’s angry with you.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.010
He got cured; he’s still living.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.010
He got cured.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.010
It’s so simple.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.010
We can’t believe it; it is so fantastic.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.900
It is worth seeing yourself with your own
eyes.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:28.310
The other day only, in Scotland, there was
a Gentleman was suffering from terrible, terrible

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.310
arthritis.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.950
He got completely cured and he came to see
me in Edinburgh.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:40.760
Arthritis absolutely curable; Diabetes is
absolutely curable; paralysis is absolutely

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.760
curable.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.510
These all come out of your imbalances.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:51.390
If you want to treat a tree and if you just
treat a flower or a leaf you cannot treat

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.390
the tree.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.000
You have to go through the sap.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.010
Sahaja Yoga is a system by which you go through
the sap of a personality and treat the whole

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.250
body as a whole.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:07.171
Because the whole is the one, which is to
be looked after and not a part of it, because

00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:09.830
you are a part of the whole.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:15.330
And once you get connected with the whole
that whole that primordial being looks after

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.760
you.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:22.070
And this is what has exactly happened to us
that we are all separated from the whole and

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:27.120
we have to become one with that with all our
awareness and understanding; so that that

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.320
whole looks after us.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:37.670
So coming back to your question about kundalini
that it falls off is a true thing with some

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.430
people it does go down.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.540
But all the forces that are divine are looking
after you.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:49.180
You have to little bit cooperate with your
kundalini and she comes up she makes you beautiful,

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:54.730
absolutely beautiful.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.990
Now any more questions?

00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.590
Man: Could you explain what exactly you have
to do?

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.760
That’s the exact point.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.220
You don’t have to do anything.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.010
You see I have to do something about it not
you.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.860
In the beginning then you can do it.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.540
Like this light is here all right?

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.580
This is enlightened.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:18.930
Now there’s another candle, which is not
enlightened that candle has to sit straight

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.080
just keep the wick out that’s all.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:26.930
And this candle has to just go near that and
that gets enlightened.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:30.101
I mean, I’m not doing anything about it
that also I must say because sometimes the

00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:32.250
ego gets challenged; you know somebody says,
why Mother you?

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.790
I said you better do it.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:39.670
I’ll be very happy to be replaced.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.541
If you can come and do it, nothing like it.

00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:44.541
You see it’ll be such a change.

00:12:44.541 --> 00:12:45.541
But what can I do?

00:12:45.541 --> 00:12:48.790
I have to do it.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:55.160
Otherwise I’m a happily married woman; I
have my children, grandchildren, everyone

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.690
there, I have no problems.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:03.890
But I see your problems, and I see that spirit
in you, and I just feel in all my love and

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.990
compassion that you must know it; that’s
all.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.390
And once you know it you can do it yourself.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.060
Like one light can enlighten many.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.060
Isn’t it?

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.160
It’s as simple.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.420
You become that.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.960
You don’t have to do anything about it;
you have to just put your fingers like this

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.850
and the power flows into you.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:21.920
It’s that simple.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.980
You won’t believe but it is so because you
are ready.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.640
You are just ready to be enlightened.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.740
Now this instrument is made, if it is not
put to the mains what’s the use?

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:34.740
But how do you put to the mains?

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.010
Just put to the mains, that’s all.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.580
The mains are there and this is ready you
just put to the mains.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.580
You are just there.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:46.580
Like a television set to a villager if you
tell, he won’t believe that it is so fantastic.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.320
That there are all things around you; he will
say I can’t see anything.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.380
How can he believe it?

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.410
When you put to the mains and you start seeing
the television manifesting, which is so fantastic.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.760
In the same way, you are a special instrument
created by God.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.380
You are just put to the mains.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.940
You don’t have to do anything.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.660
What did you do for your evolution?

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.410
When we became human beings from a monkey
what did we do?

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:15.720
Nothing, we did not cut our tail or anything
it just dropped off.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.770
In the same way, we don’t do anything for
this also; it’s just there; you are just

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.890
ready; you just get it like that.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.430
You don’t know how fantastic you are.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.460
You don’t know that, na?

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.590
I know that.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.100
But you will also know very soon.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.020
When you know you will be amazed how fantastic
you are within.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:34.480
It’s said all ways, all the scriptures,
all the great people have described you as

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.480
very great.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.890
All of them have described.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.280
But you must have faith in yourself that you
are great, no doubt.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.540
And that instrument is ready, just ready.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.410
It is to be applied to the mains and once
you start manifesting you can give it to others.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.870
It’s that simple.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:54.080
You can’t believe it I know, but it is so,
you will see that very soon.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.970
Do not doubt it too much all right?

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.280
Otherwise this brain will be working khat
khat khat.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:05.900
That’s why I’ve said for a while you should
stop thinking about it then it will work out.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.790
Because I’ve seen people who go on doubting
very much they take time.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:18.280
Just open, open out yourself, you must open
yourself fully and it will work out.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.510
After all you want to have your realization
isn’t it?

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.130
What else you want?

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.680
You don’t want to doubt for doubting sake.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.840
What’s the use of doubting also?

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.690
I mean if there is supposing I say there’s
a diamond here.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:35.530
You will all run not only you but people from
Australia will come if I say it is free available.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.100
Don’t you think so?

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:43.720
They will say worth going by plane, if there’s
such a big diamond available.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.790
So no use doubting.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.790
Just have it.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.090
You have a diamond in your heart.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:52.000
No doubt it will spark.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.210
Do not doubt.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:56.680
This mind has been doubting all the time,
what has it given you?

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.490
Nothing it will give you problems and headaches.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:09.810
Don’t be doubting Thomas’s; be trusting.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:15.430
Come here; come.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:25.860
Lady: do you find people’s problems stop
them getting realization?

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.890
Problems it stops a little sometimes little
bit.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:34.880
But I know all the permutations, combinations
now.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.520
So I can get over all the problems; I think
so.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.200
All right?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.940
I know many permutations and combinations
now of problems.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:49.340
In the beginning you’ll be amazed in this
England I came here when my husband got elected

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.480
to this job.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:57.040
For four years I worked on six people, for
four years, can you imagine?

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.430
And now they just get it like that.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:03.720
Now I know all the permutations, combinations
of English people and England and western

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.720
people.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.639
Now I’m going to America and I’ve been
there before also; so keep your fingers crossed;

00:17:09.639 --> 00:17:13.760
I’m sure I’ll work it out there also.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.120
Everybody’s an interesting sample of some
combination.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.100
But I know all the keys somehow; I’ve studied
it and I’ve put all attention to it.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:27.160
It has worked out and all these problems I
know what you all have.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.260
Somehow it works out so don’t you worry
about that.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.840
If there were no problems, there was no need
to do this.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.049
I mean you would be just there.

00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:39.960
There has to be problems.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:45.960
Any other problem?

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:56.210
Man: We’ve got seven chakras over there;
can you please tell us what part each one

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.210
plays?

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.210
That’s good.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.710
Now all that is so elaborate I may not be
able to tell you today; but can you come and

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:02.710
show?

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.070
But I will be able to say in short, all right?

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.809
Now he is coming; he will show you.

00:18:09.809 --> 00:18:22.210
Now the first chakra which is below the kundalini
the first one is the very important centre,

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:31.160
which is bestowed by a deity, which is the
embodiment of innocence.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.100
Is the centre of innocence, the first chakra.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:42.519
To explain it more we can say when we were
at the carbon stage, carbon stage.

00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:46.500
Now Carbon is a very important element, you
know that.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:52.790
In the periodical laws it is placed in the
centre; it is tetravalent means it has four

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.900
hands either it can give four hands or take
four hands.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:01.549
And at that stage only the nature started
producing life.

00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:04.870
So that is the stage where we were at carbon
level.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:10.110
And nature is innocent a chair doesn’t get
angry with you.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.270
Its only we can get angry.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:19.399
So the nature that we are, is innocent our
basis is innocence.

00:19:19.399 --> 00:19:21.779
We are surrounded first by innocence.

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:24.520
We are basically innocent people.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.450
So this is the first centre, is of innocence.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.629
Then the second centre that you see.

00:19:30.629 --> 00:19:32.570
Actually the Nabhi we can take it.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.269
Is the second centre and the third centre
are connected.

00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:40.850
From the second centre arises the third centre.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:49.659
The second centre is the centre of our seeking.

00:19:49.659 --> 00:19:52.870
This one manifests our solar plexus.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:57.460
And this caters to our seeking.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:04.019
As amoeba we were seeking our food through
our stomach; it is in the stomach we can say.

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:08.080
Actually they are all placed in the medulla
oblongata; they are placed in the spinal chord.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.750
But they manifest outside the plexuses.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:19.549
For example, the first one manifests the plexus
called as pelvic plexus, which is responsible

00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:21.570
for our excretory functions.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.600
All right?

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:28.499
Now the second one, which is the one I told
you just now, manifests the solar plexus,

00:20:28.499 --> 00:20:30.240
is for our seeking.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:36.419
And now you are at a stage where you are seeking
the ultimate the beyond.

00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:40.710
But there are people who are still seeking
money, there are people who are still seeking

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.470
other things.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:48.070
But I take if for granted that you are seeking
divine.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.779
So the seeking reaches that state at that
centre.

00:20:51.779 --> 00:20:56.559
The other centre that comes out of it is the
centre of action.

00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:59.690
The seeking has to put into action.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.049
Otherwise supposing you are hungry you have
to go into action to get it.

00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:10.039
So this is the centre of action within us,
which works within us all the activities for

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:11.039
the future.

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:22.249
It thinks and all the activities that we require
for our mental or our physical needs.

00:21:22.249 --> 00:21:25.320
So this is a center of the creator.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:33.529
The above centre to that is the centre which
is the centre of Heart as we call it.

00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:38.380
Is the centre which represents your sense
of security.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:46.470
When the child is about twelve years of age
this centre creates anti bodies in your sternum

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:51.990
bone and these antibodies by the time the
child is about twelve years of age go into

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:59.520
the whole body and they are the ones who react
to any invasion on the body.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:06.929
And these antibodies react; say for example,
all our injection system works on that.

00:22:06.929 --> 00:22:14.019
We put a little virus, which is an outsider
invader inside the body and when you put that

00:22:14.019 --> 00:22:16.270
they get energetic to fight.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:20.179
And because of their energies they fight the
disease and we get cured.

00:22:20.179 --> 00:22:22.509
This is the principle of that is.

00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:25.570
This is the center of our sense of security.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:32.419
When we are insecure then this centre starts
pulsating and emitting more antibodies and

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:33.419
looking after us.

00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:35.679
And this is a very important centre within
us.

00:22:35.679 --> 00:22:40.440
But there are other two other centers on sides
of it; one is of the mother, one of the father;

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440
on both sides.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.760
I mean they have sub centers also.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.639
Now this one can be called as the one which
manifests cardiac plexus.

00:22:47.639 --> 00:22:54.940
Then above that is the centre which is behind
here, is the centre of our collectivity.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.649
Is the centre where we become one with the
whole.

00:22:58.649 --> 00:23:01.990
Is the centre which gives us the idea that
we are one.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:07.860
By this centre we become also the witness
of the play of the divine later on when it

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:08.860
is enlightened.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:13.860
It is a very important centre by which we
talk to others, we communicate to others on

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.129
the right hand side.

00:23:15.129 --> 00:23:21.440
On the left hand side emotionally we become
attached to people.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:27.980
Then above that is the centre as I told you
of Christ or we can say the centre of ascent.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:36.019
There is the door, which goes into this area
of limbic area, which is grossly known as

00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:38.169
limbic area, which is the kingdom of God.

00:23:38.169 --> 00:23:42.730
And above is the last one here where this
point.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.110
The whole thing is one centre the limbic area
and this point.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.940
When the ego and superego are sucked in, the
kundalini rushes through, and this fontanel

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:56.379
bone area becomes very soft and you start
getting the cool breeze from that part.

00:23:56.379 --> 00:24:00.830
Now in short I’ve told you but in details
you can go through the book it’s all written

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.239
down about these centers.

00:24:02.239 --> 00:24:08.239
Which are the basic seven centers but there
are many other centers, which are sub plexuses

00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:09.450
of this.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:14.840
Amazingly there’s one thing that all these
centers are manifesting the plexuses outside

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.809
and all these plexuses.

00:24:16.809 --> 00:24:22.519
For example here, the plexus is the one that
looks after the pituitary and the pineal,

00:24:22.519 --> 00:24:24.140
these two things.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:30.989
So it is related absolutely with the gross
as well but we go from inside outward while

00:24:30.989 --> 00:24:32.890
the doctors go from outward inside.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:37.080
Which you cannot go you cannot enter into
a tree through a leaf you can enter only through

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.940
the sap into it.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.299
These are in short I have told you.

00:24:41.299 --> 00:24:44.971
But there are all these things are clearly
written down in a book that they will give

00:24:44.971 --> 00:24:45.971
you.

00:24:45.971 --> 00:24:46.971
They have got it.

00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:47.971
Have you got that book?

00:24:47.971 --> 00:24:48.971
You can get.

00:24:48.971 --> 00:24:49.971
It’s a very small booklet.

00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:51.130
Do you charge any money for that?

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.130
No?

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.130
It’s free?

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.130
You charge a little.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:55.130
How much?

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.750
Man: Ten pie or something.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.149
Ten pie or something they charge.

00:24:59.149 --> 00:25:05.289
You see because maybe, so far all these boys
have been printing it and paying for it for

00:25:05.289 --> 00:25:06.289
the whole also.

00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:10.030
I mean this thing requires money no doubt,
but these boys have been doing it.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.159
And it’s all right not much you see.

00:25:12.159 --> 00:25:18.639
Birmingham is a cheep place that way I must
say compared to some places I went to.

00:25:18.639 --> 00:25:24.870
Also everybody is trying to fund it so that,
I mean there is no sort of any profit basis

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:25.870
or anything.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:31.070
But like ashram we have got we have got say
ten people they take a house they live there,

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.370
look after it and that’s an ashram.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:38.390
There’s no sort of a profit making or any
fees or anything.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.789
Because they live there, they have a house,
they live there that’s all.

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:41.809
It’s as simple as that.

00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:46.179
We do not have any such organization; there
is nobody who is organized in it.

00:25:46.179 --> 00:25:47.919
You cannot organize God.

00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:52.679
So there’s no organization they are there
because of their free will, because of their

00:25:52.679 --> 00:25:57.440
freedom and because of their love and because
they feel responsible that they should do

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.440
it.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.799
There’s no force on you; there’s no compulsion;
there’s no money taking; there’s no membership.

00:26:03.799 --> 00:26:11.419
Man: Is it also possible please for any of
those centers to awaken without the knowledge

00:26:11.419 --> 00:26:15.369
of the individual?

00:26:15.369 --> 00:26:24.540
You see, sometimes it happens, that a person
can be attacked from the sides and then that

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.970
centre can go on emitting too much.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.020
Like in cancer it happens.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.539
That one of the centers you see, say for instance
the stomach.

00:26:32.539 --> 00:26:39.669
If you are eating say something which is irritating
the stomach centre, then what happens that

00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:46.309
this centre receives all the energies from
everywhere, all the stored up energy and starts

00:26:46.309 --> 00:26:47.470
working very hard.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.789
When it starts working very hard, it gets
dislocated.

00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:55.820
When it gets dislocated, what happens that
there is no relationship left with the whole

00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:02.519
and the cells starts growing more than in
relation to the whole.

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:05.110
And we say malignancy has been set in.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.249
And like that can happen they can get over
excited.

00:27:08.249 --> 00:27:13.590
But the energy from other centers is brought
in one and they get over excited with out

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.499
any relationship to the whole.

00:27:15.499 --> 00:27:17.249
And that’s a very dangerous situation.

00:27:17.249 --> 00:27:22.730
Such a thing can happen and sometimes it can
happen on certain centers where people just

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:23.730
get possessed.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.720
And they think they have got some sort of
a great experience.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.720
Is not so.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.940
Like there was a lady who always felt she’s
getting out of her body.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.419
Ultimately she got her cancer.

00:27:32.419 --> 00:27:34.750
Now, of course, she is cured; she’s all
right.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:39.429
But these all such experiences come from the
left and the right side.

00:27:39.429 --> 00:27:40.429
Not from the superior.

00:27:40.429 --> 00:27:45.600
The one experience on the left hand side is
of the collective subconscious because on

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.629
the left hand side of this channel that you
see is the collective subconscious.

00:27:50.629 --> 00:27:55.510
Now we do not know because these are unknown
areas for us; the collective subconscious

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.409
on this area and the collective supraconscious
on this area.

00:27:58.409 --> 00:28:02.080
Now, for example, spiritualists they work
from the collective subconscious; very dangerous

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.429
thing to do.

00:28:03.429 --> 00:28:06.549
We have nothing to do with spirits, nothing
to do with them.

00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:09.210
We are in the centre and the present.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:14.559
If you indulge into spiritualism, you’ll
find you develop a very funny situation and

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:16.539
I don’t know how they end it up.

00:28:16.539 --> 00:28:22.899
Apart from mental trouble, you’ll be amazed,
I’m amazed at it myself, that all the cancer

00:28:22.899 --> 00:28:30.619
patients I’ve seen so far are all attacked
from the left side not from the right side.

00:28:30.619 --> 00:28:34.619
Those who are attacked from the right side
is the supraconscious the collective supraconscious

00:28:34.619 --> 00:28:36.110
are the people like Hitler.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:43.919
Who get possessed by very, you can say very,
very dominating personalities who are dead

00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:47.519
or those who lived in the future great planners
this that they get attacked.

00:28:47.519 --> 00:28:52.360
And once they get attacked there’s an outlet.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.639
For example you can say Hitler was like a
medium and he transformed other people into

00:28:56.639 --> 00:29:00.039
that kind of a frantic temperament.

00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:04.999
I mean it took him eleven years to build up
that kind of a domain of Satans you see but

00:29:04.999 --> 00:29:06.100
it took eleven years.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:11.470
And I would blame then the people who allowed
this to grow and once this grew up and suddenly

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:15.220
it blew up them then they realized; oh God
where are we?

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:20.480
So these attacks can come from these two areas
they are called as Adiboutic and Adidevic

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.030
in Sanskrit language.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:28.879
But this is, is the spirit; is the Atma; is
the superior; is the super most experience

00:29:28.879 --> 00:29:35.039
where you become the spirit itself, your spirit
not somebody else’s.

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:40.999
So all these experiences are not healthy;
they should be avoided for all those who are

00:29:40.999 --> 00:29:41.999
seeking reality.

00:29:41.999 --> 00:29:46.241
I mean if you want to have some jugglery,
then it’s a different thing but it is a

00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:48.389
very dangerous thing to play with it.

00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:51.989
All these gurus are using only this either
left or the right side.

00:29:51.989 --> 00:29:53.929
They use the spirits and that’s how they
mesmerize.

00:29:53.929 --> 00:29:57.850
That’s a very dangerous state.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:04.659
The other day Sahaja Yoga has become so powerful
now that they these people gave realization

00:30:04.659 --> 00:30:07.410
to an archbishop of black magic.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.410
Can you imagine?

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.960
I was amazed.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.750
And this fellow was quite all right then he
went home and he found everything was moving

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.750
around.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:18.519
This all the things that were there were moving
around.

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:23.360
Now the spirits were tempting him back they
thought if we show some sort of this jugglery

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.999
he will be back again.

00:30:24.999 --> 00:30:27.090
And they telephoned to me Mother now what
to do.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.389
I said why did you give him realization?

00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:30.419
There was no need to give him realization.

00:30:30.419 --> 00:30:32.330
He said just he came and he got it.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.139
I said leave him alone I’ll look after him
you don’t worry.

00:30:34.139 --> 00:30:37.409
It happens now.

00:30:37.409 --> 00:30:42.369
This Sahaja yoga is so great imagine giving
realization to the archbishop of black magic.

00:30:42.369 --> 00:30:44.519
I mean this is too much.

00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:45.809
It’s doing.

00:30:45.809 --> 00:30:47.090
It’s happening.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:57.480
Man: May I say by the way that um I can see
a white aura around your head for the last

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.480
hour.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.570
Yes it’s true, but I would say don’t see
that.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.159
You’ll see many things because I’m something
more; there’s no doubt.

00:31:03.159 --> 00:31:04.159
Quite a lot I am.

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:06.940
That you have to discover later.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.429
You can see many things.

00:31:08.429 --> 00:31:13.659
But I would say don’t say anything because
this also seeing is not the thing experiencing

00:31:13.659 --> 00:31:18.299
is the thing and that’s why you must experience
your being.

00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:20.749
And People have seen me in many forms many
things.

00:31:20.749 --> 00:31:22.309
That’s not important.

00:31:22.309 --> 00:31:23.870
That’s not important.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:28.049
Important is that you must get your realization.

00:31:28.049 --> 00:31:30.799
I must be something isn’t it to do it?

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:32.789
No doubt there must be something about me.

00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:34.929
But I don’t want to talk about it just now.

00:31:34.929 --> 00:31:38.330
I’m very tactful; you better find out.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.602
Lady: Why is peace and tranquility adjusted
on your face?

00:31:41.602 --> 00:31:48.289
On my face?

00:31:48.289 --> 00:31:49.539
You are also going to get it.

00:31:49.539 --> 00:31:51.299
That’s all I can say.

00:31:51.299 --> 00:31:53.889
It is there inside.

00:31:53.889 --> 00:31:58.269
It is all whatever is inside comes out isn’t
it?

00:31:58.269 --> 00:32:03.309
You are all peace, tranquility everything
inside you are also the same not only me.

00:32:03.309 --> 00:32:06.669
You have to just feel it.

00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:13.100
You will, you will no doubt, you will no doubt.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.100
I assure you.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.769
That’s why I’m here; I want you to enjoy
that what I am enjoying.

00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:16.850
That’s all.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.440
You see it’s like a drunkard who cannot
enjoy his drink.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.289
That’s why I say that I am a capitalist
because I have all these powers and I am the

00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:26.710
greatest communist because I must share.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.429
I can’t help it without sharing.

00:32:29.429 --> 00:32:34.919
So this such a combination, all right?
