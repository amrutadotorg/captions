WEBVTT

00:01.209 --> 00:06.000
I would like to have some questions from you
about it.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.240
And then we’ll see how it works out.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.780
All right?

00:10.780 --> 00:15.849
And not to be afraid, there’s nothing to
have any fear about kundalini.

00:15.849 --> 00:19.599
Because you must have read such big, big books
saying that kundalini burns you, kundalini

00:19.599 --> 00:20.599
does this.

00:20.599 --> 00:22.169
No she is your own mother.

00:22.169 --> 00:23.409
She doesn’t do anything of the kind.

00:23.409 --> 00:26.380
These are the people who have never known
what kundalini is.

00:26.380 --> 00:36.060
It’s like somebody putting the fingers into
the plug and saying electricity burns you.

00:36.060 --> 00:45.680
They are unauthorized people who have done
all this, and that’s how they have suffered.

00:45.680 --> 00:50.769
So any questions please?

00:50.769 --> 01:00.109
Can’t think; if the kundalini rises above
this you become thoughtless just can’t think.

01:00.109 --> 01:03.600
And when she gets out from here you start
feeling the cool breeze from your head.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.360
Really a cool breeze you feel it and from
your fingers.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.750
As simple as that

01:10.750 --> 01:14.840
You are still doubting something.

01:14.840 --> 01:18.549
Ask a question.

01:18.549 --> 01:21.020
Can’t hear.

01:21.020 --> 01:22.259
Loudly.

01:22.259 --> 01:27.200
Come, come, come here.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.439
Come

01:28.439 --> 01:30.910
(Lady inaudible)

01:30.910 --> 01:37.110
All right All right May God bless you sit.

01:37.110 --> 01:43.039
She is saying that have you to pray to kundalini?

01:43.039 --> 01:46.510
No nothing you don’t have to.

01:46.510 --> 01:55.009
You see prayer before realization has no meaning
it’s like telephoning without connection.

01:55.009 --> 02:02.899
There’s nothing to pray nothing to pray
nothing to pray.

02:02.899 --> 02:12.190
(Lady inaudible) Can you come here?

02:12.190 --> 02:41.430
(Man: I think everybody has got a question
to ask but they don’t know how to ask you)

02:41.430 --> 02:45.030
They don’t want to?

02:45.030 --> 02:47.730
What, What Questions?

02:47.730 --> 02:52.240
Ask now What is there?

02:52.240 --> 02:53.320
What is you don’t know?

02:53.320 --> 02:57.170
I know English at least so ask me any question
in English.

02:57.170 --> 03:00.370
Now what did you say?

03:00.370 --> 03:01.370
(Lady)

03:01.370 --> 03:03.560
Oh very good question.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.120
That’s a good question.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.670
That’s a good one.

03:08.670 --> 03:13.150
Yes sit down sit down sit down.

03:13.150 --> 03:19.210
She asked me a question if it is awakened
can it die out?

03:19.210 --> 03:20.250
It doesn’t.

03:20.250 --> 03:25.040
Once it is awakened it goes up it opens out.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.080
But, but is there.

03:27.080 --> 03:34.552
At the first shot you see it goes really in
a big way you get it in a really big way.

03:34.552 --> 03:35.552
You remember.

03:35.552 --> 03:42.700
But then it goes back and looks after other
parts where there’s a problem so the force

03:42.700 --> 03:43.750
is reduced.

03:43.750 --> 03:53.410
But then you have to learn how to keep the
force there and how to raise it and this is

03:53.410 --> 03:56.630
called as vidya, called as the knowledge.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.820
How to raise the kundalini….

03:58.820 --> 04:05.330
Side B: ….What is all this about?

04:05.330 --> 04:08.230
So that part you have to know.

04:08.230 --> 04:10.890
I am here to decode it.

04:10.890 --> 04:15.610
Somebody come and told me, Mother I feel here
tickling, all the time tickling, I said this

04:15.610 --> 04:19.079
centre is not all right you have to open this
centre.

04:19.079 --> 04:24.060
Now how to open this centre then I had to
tell that person you have to do this very

04:24.060 --> 04:25.060
simple method.

04:25.060 --> 04:28.810
You see certain movements, because it is flowing
from your hands, certain movements how to

04:28.810 --> 04:32.490
do it, which are the deities on different
centers if you come to know about it.

04:32.490 --> 04:36.360
For example this centre is the centre of Christ.

04:36.360 --> 04:41.800
Between the optic chiasm is placed a very
subtle centre of Christ.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.620
In the Indian scriptures He is called as Maha
Vishnu.

04:45.620 --> 04:50.789
Now He was born on this earth to suck the
ego and superego.

04:50.789 --> 04:57.319
His crucifixion was there to suck our sins
means the ego and the superego.

04:57.319 --> 04:58.880
But He is to be awakened.

04:58.880 --> 05:05.620
Unless and until He’s awakened it cannot
happen you go to church or you pray to Him

05:05.620 --> 05:06.620
nothing will happen.

05:06.620 --> 05:11.870
But if kundalini goes and stops there, and
if you say Lord’s Prayer, it will rise.

05:11.870 --> 05:16.280
Is the proof that it is Christ’s centre.

05:16.280 --> 05:23.509
Now this very important point that He should
be awakened that Christ was for this was never

05:23.509 --> 05:25.659
known to Christians.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.080
It’s a living process.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.590
He said I’m a living God.

05:30.590 --> 05:37.900
And when they went to India the way they talked
about Christianity was something absurd.

05:37.900 --> 05:42.289
So Hindus still believe that this one who
has to redeem us has to come.

05:42.289 --> 05:46.990
They don’t know that He’s already born
and crucified and He’s the one.

05:46.990 --> 05:51.710
He is Maha Vishnu who is described in Devi
Mahatmyam very, very clearly.

05:51.710 --> 05:54.229
He was specially made.

05:54.229 --> 05:58.680
Who was His father; who was His mother all
described.

05:58.680 --> 06:04.759
But the people who know English have no repor
with our ancient scriptures and those who

06:04.759 --> 06:10.919
went from here have no repor with Christ.

06:10.919 --> 06:12.940
That He’s to be awakened within us.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.419
He said I am to be born.

06:15.419 --> 06:21.849
And how to awaken it nobody knew only through
kundalini you can do it.

06:21.849 --> 06:27.080
He said, it’s said in the bible I’ll appear
before you like tongues of flames.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.039
Now what are these tongues of flames?

06:29.039 --> 06:34.029
Go and ask these people.

06:34.029 --> 06:37.400
These Jews do they know?

06:37.400 --> 06:45.090
Mohammed has very clearly said that you are
to become a peer; you have to be born again.

06:45.090 --> 06:53.469
I mean namas is one of the very good ways
of raising the kundalini, if you are using

06:53.469 --> 06:55.490
the Sahaja Yoga method.

06:55.490 --> 06:58.410
Means you get your realization and then you
do namas.

06:58.410 --> 07:00.320
You’ll be amazed.

07:00.320 --> 07:04.400
Everything has a meaning only when it is a
living thing.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.809
Otherwise it’s dummy.

07:05.809 --> 07:08.360
Everything is a dummy stuff you see like this
is a dummy thing.

07:08.360 --> 07:12.879
I shout at it or do whatever you like its
not going to work.

07:12.879 --> 07:20.110
That’s why everything is a dummy and that’s
why people say oh Christianity is wrong.

07:20.110 --> 07:23.969
If you go to the Muslims they will say the
Jews are wrong.

07:23.969 --> 07:27.070
The Jews will say the Muslims are wrong, the
Hindus are wrong.

07:27.070 --> 07:28.470
I mean they are all blaming each other.

07:28.470 --> 07:32.780
If you have to learn about yourself better
go to the other party.

07:32.780 --> 07:37.360
But they are all dummies.

07:37.360 --> 07:42.469
Once you get realized you will know they are
all connected with each other absolutely one

07:42.469 --> 07:45.150
there’s complete harmony and concord.

07:45.150 --> 07:48.909
Christ Himself has said those who are not
against Me are with Me.

07:48.909 --> 07:55.270
Now go and ask these priests who are those
who are not against Him; who are with Him.

07:55.270 --> 08:02.719
I mean, He was not even given sufficient time
only for four years He could talk and He was

08:02.719 --> 08:03.719
killed.

08:03.719 --> 08:08.779
Everywhere they have done a nice pickling
up of all these great people.

08:08.779 --> 08:21.550
But Sahaja Yoga completely exposes their advents,
their purpose, their places within us and

08:21.550 --> 08:27.630
also establishes all the fundamental things
that are described in all the scriptures and

08:27.630 --> 08:29.599
their core relationships.

08:29.599 --> 08:33.930
It’s such a fantastic thing.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.120
How it establishes?

08:36.120 --> 08:37.210
By proving it.

08:37.210 --> 08:40.290
I’ll tell you one example, a simple example.

08:40.290 --> 08:43.791
There was a gentleman from Iran he was a doctor
he came to see me.

08:43.791 --> 08:47.850
I mean it is now we cannot contact him because
he’s in Iran.

08:47.850 --> 08:50.510
But he came to see me he was a Muslim.

08:50.510 --> 08:56.030
And I told him that Mohammed Sahib was born
as Nanak Sahib in India.

08:56.030 --> 08:57.030
He could not believe it.

08:57.030 --> 08:58.030
He said how can it be?

08:58.030 --> 09:03.390
Though Nanak Sahib had said it in a way, because
Nanak Sahib was sleeping and somebody told

09:03.390 --> 09:07.650
Him that you are placing your feet towards
Mecca he said all right I’ll turn my feet

09:07.650 --> 09:12.770
to other side and the Mecca came that side.

09:12.770 --> 09:15.820
He said I can’t believe it’ I can’t
believe it.

09:15.820 --> 09:18.290
I said but Mohammed Sahib Has said that He
is the last.

09:18.290 --> 09:24.200
I said I’m not sure of that but maybe He
must have decided to come back the way people

09:24.200 --> 09:25.200
are.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.200
He could not believe it.

09:26.200 --> 09:34.760
And he had stomach cancer, which is caused
by one of the reasons is fanaticism.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.980
I told him you have to believe in Him.

09:36.980 --> 09:43.130
He was one of the incarnations of the Primordial
Master and He was the same Abraham was the

09:43.130 --> 09:46.150
same Moses was the same Socrates was the same.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.460
And you have to believe it.

09:47.460 --> 09:48.780
He said I can’t believe it.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.100
I said I can’t cure you.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.070
Then he went back and he was very sick.

09:52.070 --> 09:56.580
His wife said now what is there after all,
you see, we became Muslims because our parents

09:56.580 --> 09:59.070
were Muslims and they told us Mohammed Sahib
was the last.

09:59.070 --> 10:00.790
After all you are to be saved.

10:00.790 --> 10:06.540
Then he came and said all right Mother whatever
you say I’m going to say.

10:06.540 --> 10:09.780
I said now you pray to Nanak Sahib instead
of Mohammed Sahib because it is Mohammed Sahib

10:09.780 --> 10:12.270
who’s angry with you.

10:12.270 --> 10:16.010
He got cured; he’s still living.

10:16.010 --> 10:17.010
He got cured.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.010
It’s so simple.

10:18.010 --> 10:19.010
We can’t believe it; it is so fantastic.

10:19.010 --> 10:21.900
It is worth seeing yourself with your own
eyes.

10:21.900 --> 10:28.310
The other day only, in Scotland, there was
a Gentleman was suffering from terrible, terrible

10:28.310 --> 10:29.310
arthritis.

10:29.310 --> 10:33.950
He got completely cured and he came to see
me in Edinburgh.

10:33.950 --> 10:40.760
Arthritis absolutely curable; Diabetes is
absolutely curable; paralysis is absolutely

10:40.760 --> 10:41.760
curable.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.510
These all come out of your imbalances.

10:44.510 --> 10:51.390
If you want to treat a tree and if you just
treat a flower or a leaf you cannot treat

10:51.390 --> 10:52.390
the tree.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.000
You have to go through the sap.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.010
Sahaja Yoga is a system by which you go through
the sap of a personality and treat the whole

10:59.010 --> 11:00.250
body as a whole.

11:00.250 --> 11:07.171
Because the whole is the one, which is to
be looked after and not a part of it, because

11:07.171 --> 11:09.830
you are a part of the whole.

11:09.830 --> 11:15.330
And once you get connected with the whole
that whole that primordial being looks after

11:15.330 --> 11:16.760
you.

11:16.760 --> 11:22.070
And this is what has exactly happened to us
that we are all separated from the whole and

11:22.070 --> 11:27.120
we have to become one with that with all our
awareness and understanding; so that that

11:27.120 --> 11:31.320
whole looks after us.

11:31.320 --> 11:37.670
So coming back to your question about kundalini
that it falls off is a true thing with some

11:37.670 --> 11:39.430
people it does go down.

11:39.430 --> 11:42.540
But all the forces that are divine are looking
after you.

11:42.540 --> 11:49.180
You have to little bit cooperate with your
kundalini and she comes up she makes you beautiful,

11:49.180 --> 11:54.730
absolutely beautiful.

11:54.730 --> 11:55.990
Now any more questions?

11:55.990 --> 12:00.590
Man: Could you explain what exactly you have
to do?

12:00.590 --> 12:02.760
That’s the exact point.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.220
You don’t have to do anything.

12:04.220 --> 12:08.010
You see I have to do something about it not
you.

12:08.010 --> 12:10.860
In the beginning then you can do it.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.540
Like this light is here all right?

12:12.540 --> 12:13.580
This is enlightened.

12:13.580 --> 12:18.930
Now there’s another candle, which is not
enlightened that candle has to sit straight

12:18.930 --> 12:21.080
just keep the wick out that’s all.

12:21.080 --> 12:26.930
And this candle has to just go near that and
that gets enlightened.

12:26.930 --> 12:30.101
I mean, I’m not doing anything about it
that also I must say because sometimes the

12:30.101 --> 12:32.250
ego gets challenged; you know somebody says,
why Mother you?

12:32.250 --> 12:33.790
I said you better do it.

12:33.790 --> 12:39.670
I’ll be very happy to be replaced.

12:39.670 --> 12:43.541
If you can come and do it, nothing like it.

12:43.541 --> 12:44.541
You see it’ll be such a change.

12:44.541 --> 12:45.541
But what can I do?

12:45.541 --> 12:48.790
I have to do it.

12:48.790 --> 12:55.160
Otherwise I’m a happily married woman; I
have my children, grandchildren, everyone

12:55.160 --> 12:57.690
there, I have no problems.

12:57.690 --> 13:03.890
But I see your problems, and I see that spirit
in you, and I just feel in all my love and

13:03.890 --> 13:07.990
compassion that you must know it; that’s
all.

13:07.990 --> 13:11.390
And once you know it you can do it yourself.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.060
Like one light can enlighten many.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.060
Isn’t it?

13:14.060 --> 13:15.160
It’s as simple.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.420
You become that.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.960
You don’t have to do anything about it;
you have to just put your fingers like this

13:18.960 --> 13:20.850
and the power flows into you.

13:20.850 --> 13:21.920
It’s that simple.

13:21.920 --> 13:25.980
You won’t believe but it is so because you
are ready.

13:25.980 --> 13:28.640
You are just ready to be enlightened.

13:28.640 --> 13:33.740
Now this instrument is made, if it is not
put to the mains what’s the use?

13:33.740 --> 13:34.740
But how do you put to the mains?

13:34.740 --> 13:37.010
Just put to the mains, that’s all.

13:37.010 --> 13:39.580
The mains are there and this is ready you
just put to the mains.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.580
You are just there.

13:40.580 --> 13:46.580
Like a television set to a villager if you
tell, he won’t believe that it is so fantastic.

13:46.580 --> 13:49.320
That there are all things around you; he will
say I can’t see anything.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.380
How can he believe it?

13:50.380 --> 13:54.410
When you put to the mains and you start seeing
the television manifesting, which is so fantastic.

13:54.410 --> 13:57.760
In the same way, you are a special instrument
created by God.

13:57.760 --> 14:01.380
You are just put to the mains.

14:01.380 --> 14:02.940
You don’t have to do anything.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.660
What did you do for your evolution?

14:04.660 --> 14:09.410
When we became human beings from a monkey
what did we do?

14:09.410 --> 14:15.720
Nothing, we did not cut our tail or anything
it just dropped off.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.770
In the same way, we don’t do anything for
this also; it’s just there; you are just

14:18.770 --> 14:20.890
ready; you just get it like that.

14:20.890 --> 14:22.430
You don’t know how fantastic you are.

14:22.430 --> 14:23.460
You don’t know that, na?

14:23.460 --> 14:24.590
I know that.

14:24.590 --> 14:26.100
But you will also know very soon.

14:26.100 --> 14:30.020
When you know you will be amazed how fantastic
you are within.

14:30.020 --> 14:34.480
It’s said all ways, all the scriptures,
all the great people have described you as

14:34.480 --> 14:35.480
very great.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.890
All of them have described.

14:37.890 --> 14:41.280
But you must have faith in yourself that you
are great, no doubt.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.540
And that instrument is ready, just ready.

14:44.540 --> 14:47.410
It is to be applied to the mains and once
you start manifesting you can give it to others.

14:47.410 --> 14:48.870
It’s that simple.

14:48.870 --> 14:54.080
You can’t believe it I know, but it is so,
you will see that very soon.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.970
Do not doubt it too much all right?

14:55.970 --> 14:58.280
Otherwise this brain will be working khat
khat khat.

14:58.280 --> 15:05.900
That’s why I’ve said for a while you should
stop thinking about it then it will work out.

15:05.900 --> 15:09.790
Because I’ve seen people who go on doubting
very much they take time.

15:09.790 --> 15:18.280
Just open, open out yourself, you must open
yourself fully and it will work out.

15:18.280 --> 15:21.510
After all you want to have your realization
isn’t it?

15:21.510 --> 15:23.130
What else you want?

15:23.130 --> 15:25.680
You don’t want to doubt for doubting sake.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.840
What’s the use of doubting also?

15:27.840 --> 15:30.690
I mean if there is supposing I say there’s
a diamond here.

15:30.690 --> 15:35.530
You will all run not only you but people from
Australia will come if I say it is free available.

15:35.530 --> 15:37.100
Don’t you think so?

15:37.100 --> 15:43.720
They will say worth going by plane, if there’s
such a big diamond available.

15:43.720 --> 15:44.790
So no use doubting.

15:44.790 --> 15:45.790
Just have it.

15:45.790 --> 15:48.090
You have a diamond in your heart.

15:48.090 --> 15:52.000
No doubt it will spark.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.210
Do not doubt.

15:53.210 --> 15:56.680
This mind has been doubting all the time,
what has it given you?

15:56.680 --> 16:01.490
Nothing it will give you problems and headaches.

16:01.490 --> 16:09.810
Don’t be doubting Thomas’s; be trusting.

16:09.810 --> 16:15.430
Come here; come.

16:15.430 --> 16:25.860
Lady: do you find people’s problems stop
them getting realization?

16:25.860 --> 16:30.890
Problems it stops a little sometimes little
bit.

16:30.890 --> 16:34.880
But I know all the permutations, combinations
now.

16:34.880 --> 16:38.520
So I can get over all the problems; I think
so.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.200
All right?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.940
I know many permutations and combinations
now of problems.

16:42.940 --> 16:49.340
In the beginning you’ll be amazed in this
England I came here when my husband got elected

16:49.340 --> 16:50.480
to this job.

16:50.480 --> 16:57.040
For four years I worked on six people, for
four years, can you imagine?

16:57.040 --> 16:59.430
And now they just get it like that.

16:59.430 --> 17:03.720
Now I know all the permutations, combinations
of English people and England and western

17:03.720 --> 17:04.720
people.

17:04.720 --> 17:09.639
Now I’m going to America and I’ve been
there before also; so keep your fingers crossed;

17:09.639 --> 17:13.760
I’m sure I’ll work it out there also.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.120
Everybody’s an interesting sample of some
combination.

17:17.120 --> 17:22.100
But I know all the keys somehow; I’ve studied
it and I’ve put all attention to it.

17:22.100 --> 17:27.160
It has worked out and all these problems I
know what you all have.

17:27.160 --> 17:30.260
Somehow it works out so don’t you worry
about that.

17:30.260 --> 17:33.840
If there were no problems, there was no need
to do this.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.049
I mean you would be just there.

17:36.049 --> 17:39.960
There has to be problems.

17:39.960 --> 17:45.960
Any other problem?

17:45.960 --> 17:56.210
Man: We’ve got seven chakras over there;
can you please tell us what part each one

17:56.210 --> 17:57.210
plays?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.210
That’s good.

17:58.210 --> 18:01.710
Now all that is so elaborate I may not be
able to tell you today; but can you come and

18:01.710 --> 18:02.710
show?

18:02.710 --> 18:05.070
But I will be able to say in short, all right?

18:05.070 --> 18:09.809
Now he is coming; he will show you.

18:09.809 --> 18:22.210
Now the first chakra which is below the kundalini
the first one is the very important centre,

18:22.210 --> 18:31.160
which is bestowed by a deity, which is the
embodiment of innocence.

18:31.160 --> 18:36.100
Is the centre of innocence, the first chakra.

18:36.100 --> 18:42.519
To explain it more we can say when we were
at the carbon stage, carbon stage.

18:42.519 --> 18:46.500
Now Carbon is a very important element, you
know that.

18:46.500 --> 18:52.790
In the periodical laws it is placed in the
centre; it is tetravalent means it has four

18:52.790 --> 18:55.900
hands either it can give four hands or take
four hands.

18:55.900 --> 19:01.549
And at that stage only the nature started
producing life.

19:01.549 --> 19:04.870
So that is the stage where we were at carbon
level.

19:04.870 --> 19:10.110
And nature is innocent a chair doesn’t get
angry with you.

19:10.110 --> 19:13.270
Its only we can get angry.

19:13.270 --> 19:19.399
So the nature that we are, is innocent our
basis is innocence.

19:19.399 --> 19:21.779
We are surrounded first by innocence.

19:21.779 --> 19:24.520
We are basically innocent people.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.450
So this is the first centre, is of innocence.

19:27.450 --> 19:30.629
Then the second centre that you see.

19:30.629 --> 19:32.570
Actually the Nabhi we can take it.

19:32.570 --> 19:36.269
Is the second centre and the third centre
are connected.

19:36.269 --> 19:40.850
From the second centre arises the third centre.

19:40.850 --> 19:49.659
The second centre is the centre of our seeking.

19:49.659 --> 19:52.870
This one manifests our solar plexus.

19:52.870 --> 19:57.460
And this caters to our seeking.

19:57.460 --> 20:04.019
As amoeba we were seeking our food through
our stomach; it is in the stomach we can say.

20:04.019 --> 20:08.080
Actually they are all placed in the medulla
oblongata; they are placed in the spinal chord.

20:08.080 --> 20:10.750
But they manifest outside the plexuses.

20:10.750 --> 20:19.549
For example, the first one manifests the plexus
called as pelvic plexus, which is responsible

20:19.549 --> 20:21.570
for our excretory functions.

20:21.570 --> 20:22.600
All right?

20:22.600 --> 20:28.499
Now the second one, which is the one I told
you just now, manifests the solar plexus,

20:28.499 --> 20:30.240
is for our seeking.

20:30.240 --> 20:36.419
And now you are at a stage where you are seeking
the ultimate the beyond.

20:36.419 --> 20:40.710
But there are people who are still seeking
money, there are people who are still seeking

20:40.710 --> 20:42.470
other things.

20:42.470 --> 20:48.070
But I take if for granted that you are seeking
divine.

20:48.070 --> 20:51.779
So the seeking reaches that state at that
centre.

20:51.779 --> 20:56.559
The other centre that comes out of it is the
centre of action.

20:56.559 --> 20:59.690
The seeking has to put into action.

20:59.690 --> 21:03.049
Otherwise supposing you are hungry you have
to go into action to get it.

21:03.049 --> 21:10.039
So this is the centre of action within us,
which works within us all the activities for

21:10.039 --> 21:11.039
the future.

21:11.039 --> 21:22.249
It thinks and all the activities that we require
for our mental or our physical needs.

21:22.249 --> 21:25.320
So this is a center of the creator.

21:25.320 --> 21:33.529
The above centre to that is the centre which
is the centre of Heart as we call it.

21:33.529 --> 21:38.380
Is the centre which represents your sense
of security.

21:38.380 --> 21:46.470
When the child is about twelve years of age
this centre creates anti bodies in your sternum

21:46.470 --> 21:51.990
bone and these antibodies by the time the
child is about twelve years of age go into

21:51.990 --> 21:59.520
the whole body and they are the ones who react
to any invasion on the body.

21:59.520 --> 22:06.929
And these antibodies react; say for example,
all our injection system works on that.

22:06.929 --> 22:14.019
We put a little virus, which is an outsider
invader inside the body and when you put that

22:14.019 --> 22:16.270
they get energetic to fight.

22:16.270 --> 22:20.179
And because of their energies they fight the
disease and we get cured.

22:20.179 --> 22:22.509
This is the principle of that is.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.570
This is the center of our sense of security.

22:25.570 --> 22:32.419
When we are insecure then this centre starts
pulsating and emitting more antibodies and

22:32.419 --> 22:33.419
looking after us.

22:33.419 --> 22:35.679
And this is a very important centre within
us.

22:35.679 --> 22:40.440
But there are other two other centers on sides
of it; one is of the mother, one of the father;

22:40.440 --> 22:41.440
on both sides.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.760
I mean they have sub centers also.

22:43.760 --> 22:47.639
Now this one can be called as the one which
manifests cardiac plexus.

22:47.639 --> 22:54.940
Then above that is the centre which is behind
here, is the centre of our collectivity.

22:54.940 --> 22:58.649
Is the centre where we become one with the
whole.

22:58.649 --> 23:01.990
Is the centre which gives us the idea that
we are one.

23:01.990 --> 23:07.860
By this centre we become also the witness
of the play of the divine later on when it

23:07.860 --> 23:08.860
is enlightened.

23:08.860 --> 23:13.860
It is a very important centre by which we
talk to others, we communicate to others on

23:13.860 --> 23:15.129
the right hand side.

23:15.129 --> 23:21.440
On the left hand side emotionally we become
attached to people.

23:21.440 --> 23:27.980
Then above that is the centre as I told you
of Christ or we can say the centre of ascent.

23:27.980 --> 23:36.019
There is the door, which goes into this area
of limbic area, which is grossly known as

23:36.019 --> 23:38.169
limbic area, which is the kingdom of God.

23:38.169 --> 23:42.730
And above is the last one here where this
point.

23:42.730 --> 23:46.110
The whole thing is one centre the limbic area
and this point.

23:46.110 --> 23:50.940
When the ego and superego are sucked in, the
kundalini rushes through, and this fontanel

23:50.940 --> 23:56.379
bone area becomes very soft and you start
getting the cool breeze from that part.

23:56.379 --> 24:00.830
Now in short I’ve told you but in details
you can go through the book it’s all written

24:00.830 --> 24:02.239
down about these centers.

24:02.239 --> 24:08.239
Which are the basic seven centers but there
are many other centers, which are sub plexuses

24:08.239 --> 24:09.450
of this.

24:09.450 --> 24:14.840
Amazingly there’s one thing that all these
centers are manifesting the plexuses outside

24:14.840 --> 24:16.809
and all these plexuses.

24:16.809 --> 24:22.519
For example here, the plexus is the one that
looks after the pituitary and the pineal,

24:22.519 --> 24:24.140
these two things.

24:24.140 --> 24:30.989
So it is related absolutely with the gross
as well but we go from inside outward while

24:30.989 --> 24:32.890
the doctors go from outward inside.

24:32.890 --> 24:37.080
Which you cannot go you cannot enter into
a tree through a leaf you can enter only through

24:37.080 --> 24:38.940
the sap into it.

24:38.940 --> 24:41.299
These are in short I have told you.

24:41.299 --> 24:44.971
But there are all these things are clearly
written down in a book that they will give

24:44.971 --> 24:45.971
you.

24:45.971 --> 24:46.971
They have got it.

24:46.971 --> 24:47.971
Have you got that book?

24:47.971 --> 24:48.971
You can get.

24:48.971 --> 24:49.971
It’s a very small booklet.

24:49.971 --> 24:51.130
Do you charge any money for that?

24:51.130 --> 24:52.130
No?

24:52.130 --> 24:53.130
It’s free?

24:53.130 --> 24:54.130
You charge a little.

24:54.130 --> 24:55.130
How much?

24:55.130 --> 24:56.750
Man: Ten pie or something.

24:56.750 --> 24:59.149
Ten pie or something they charge.

24:59.149 --> 25:05.289
You see because maybe, so far all these boys
have been printing it and paying for it for

25:05.289 --> 25:06.289
the whole also.

25:06.289 --> 25:10.030
I mean this thing requires money no doubt,
but these boys have been doing it.

25:10.030 --> 25:12.159
And it’s all right not much you see.

25:12.159 --> 25:18.639
Birmingham is a cheep place that way I must
say compared to some places I went to.

25:18.639 --> 25:24.870
Also everybody is trying to fund it so that,
I mean there is no sort of any profit basis

25:24.870 --> 25:25.870
or anything.

25:25.870 --> 25:31.070
But like ashram we have got we have got say
ten people they take a house they live there,

25:31.070 --> 25:33.370
look after it and that’s an ashram.

25:33.370 --> 25:38.390
There’s no sort of a profit making or any
fees or anything.

25:38.390 --> 25:40.789
Because they live there, they have a house,
they live there that’s all.

25:40.789 --> 25:41.809
It’s as simple as that.

25:41.809 --> 25:46.179
We do not have any such organization; there
is nobody who is organized in it.

25:46.179 --> 25:47.919
You cannot organize God.

25:47.919 --> 25:52.679
So there’s no organization they are there
because of their free will, because of their

25:52.679 --> 25:57.440
freedom and because of their love and because
they feel responsible that they should do

25:57.440 --> 25:58.440
it.

25:58.440 --> 26:03.799
There’s no force on you; there’s no compulsion;
there’s no money taking; there’s no membership.

26:03.799 --> 26:11.419
Man: Is it also possible please for any of
those centers to awaken without the knowledge

26:11.419 --> 26:15.369
of the individual?

26:15.369 --> 26:24.540
You see, sometimes it happens, that a person
can be attacked from the sides and then that

26:24.540 --> 26:26.970
centre can go on emitting too much.

26:26.970 --> 26:29.020
Like in cancer it happens.

26:29.020 --> 26:32.539
That one of the centers you see, say for instance
the stomach.

26:32.539 --> 26:39.669
If you are eating say something which is irritating
the stomach centre, then what happens that

26:39.669 --> 26:46.309
this centre receives all the energies from
everywhere, all the stored up energy and starts

26:46.309 --> 26:47.470
working very hard.

26:47.470 --> 26:50.789
When it starts working very hard, it gets
dislocated.

26:50.789 --> 26:55.820
When it gets dislocated, what happens that
there is no relationship left with the whole

26:55.820 --> 27:02.519
and the cells starts growing more than in
relation to the whole.

27:02.519 --> 27:05.110
And we say malignancy has been set in.

27:05.110 --> 27:08.249
And like that can happen they can get over
excited.

27:08.249 --> 27:13.590
But the energy from other centers is brought
in one and they get over excited with out

27:13.590 --> 27:15.499
any relationship to the whole.

27:15.499 --> 27:17.249
And that’s a very dangerous situation.

27:17.249 --> 27:22.730
Such a thing can happen and sometimes it can
happen on certain centers where people just

27:22.730 --> 27:23.730
get possessed.

27:23.730 --> 27:25.720
And they think they have got some sort of
a great experience.

27:25.720 --> 27:26.720
Is not so.

27:26.720 --> 27:30.940
Like there was a lady who always felt she’s
getting out of her body.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.419
Ultimately she got her cancer.

27:32.419 --> 27:34.750
Now, of course, she is cured; she’s all
right.

27:34.750 --> 27:39.429
But these all such experiences come from the
left and the right side.

27:39.429 --> 27:40.429
Not from the superior.

27:40.429 --> 27:45.600
The one experience on the left hand side is
of the collective subconscious because on

27:45.600 --> 27:50.629
the left hand side of this channel that you
see is the collective subconscious.

27:50.629 --> 27:55.510
Now we do not know because these are unknown
areas for us; the collective subconscious

27:55.510 --> 27:58.409
on this area and the collective supraconscious
on this area.

27:58.409 --> 28:02.080
Now, for example, spiritualists they work
from the collective subconscious; very dangerous

28:02.080 --> 28:03.429
thing to do.

28:03.429 --> 28:06.549
We have nothing to do with spirits, nothing
to do with them.

28:06.549 --> 28:09.210
We are in the centre and the present.

28:09.210 --> 28:14.559
If you indulge into spiritualism, you’ll
find you develop a very funny situation and

28:14.559 --> 28:16.539
I don’t know how they end it up.

28:16.539 --> 28:22.899
Apart from mental trouble, you’ll be amazed,
I’m amazed at it myself, that all the cancer

28:22.899 --> 28:30.619
patients I’ve seen so far are all attacked
from the left side not from the right side.

28:30.619 --> 28:34.619
Those who are attacked from the right side
is the supraconscious the collective supraconscious

28:34.619 --> 28:36.110
are the people like Hitler.

28:36.110 --> 28:43.919
Who get possessed by very, you can say very,
very dominating personalities who are dead

28:43.919 --> 28:47.519
or those who lived in the future great planners
this that they get attacked.

28:47.519 --> 28:52.360
And once they get attacked there’s an outlet.

28:52.360 --> 28:56.639
For example you can say Hitler was like a
medium and he transformed other people into

28:56.639 --> 29:00.039
that kind of a frantic temperament.

29:00.039 --> 29:04.999
I mean it took him eleven years to build up
that kind of a domain of Satans you see but

29:04.999 --> 29:06.100
it took eleven years.

29:06.100 --> 29:11.470
And I would blame then the people who allowed
this to grow and once this grew up and suddenly

29:11.470 --> 29:15.220
it blew up them then they realized; oh God
where are we?

29:15.220 --> 29:20.480
So these attacks can come from these two areas
they are called as Adiboutic and Adidevic

29:20.480 --> 29:22.030
in Sanskrit language.

29:22.030 --> 29:28.879
But this is, is the spirit; is the Atma; is
the superior; is the super most experience

29:28.879 --> 29:35.039
where you become the spirit itself, your spirit
not somebody else’s.

29:35.039 --> 29:40.999
So all these experiences are not healthy;
they should be avoided for all those who are

29:40.999 --> 29:41.999
seeking reality.

29:41.999 --> 29:46.241
I mean if you want to have some jugglery,
then it’s a different thing but it is a

29:46.241 --> 29:48.389
very dangerous thing to play with it.

29:48.389 --> 29:51.989
All these gurus are using only this either
left or the right side.

29:51.989 --> 29:53.929
They use the spirits and that’s how they
mesmerize.

29:53.929 --> 29:57.850
That’s a very dangerous state.

29:57.850 --> 30:04.659
The other day Sahaja Yoga has become so powerful
now that they these people gave realization

30:04.659 --> 30:07.410
to an archbishop of black magic.

30:07.410 --> 30:08.410
Can you imagine?

30:08.410 --> 30:09.960
I was amazed.

30:09.960 --> 30:14.750
And this fellow was quite all right then he
went home and he found everything was moving

30:14.750 --> 30:15.750
around.

30:15.750 --> 30:18.519
This all the things that were there were moving
around.

30:18.519 --> 30:23.360
Now the spirits were tempting him back they
thought if we show some sort of this jugglery

30:23.360 --> 30:24.999
he will be back again.

30:24.999 --> 30:27.090
And they telephoned to me Mother now what
to do.

30:27.090 --> 30:28.389
I said why did you give him realization?

30:28.389 --> 30:30.419
There was no need to give him realization.

30:30.419 --> 30:32.330
He said just he came and he got it.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.139
I said leave him alone I’ll look after him
you don’t worry.

30:34.139 --> 30:37.409
It happens now.

30:37.409 --> 30:42.369
This Sahaja yoga is so great imagine giving
realization to the archbishop of black magic.

30:42.369 --> 30:44.519
I mean this is too much.

30:44.519 --> 30:45.809
It’s doing.

30:45.809 --> 30:47.090
It’s happening.

30:47.090 --> 30:57.480
Man: May I say by the way that um I can see
a white aura around your head for the last

30:57.480 --> 30:58.480
hour.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.570
Yes it’s true, but I would say don’t see
that.

30:59.570 --> 31:03.159
You’ll see many things because I’m something
more; there’s no doubt.

31:03.159 --> 31:04.159
Quite a lot I am.

31:04.159 --> 31:06.940
That you have to discover later.

31:06.940 --> 31:08.429
You can see many things.

31:08.429 --> 31:13.659
But I would say don’t say anything because
this also seeing is not the thing experiencing

31:13.659 --> 31:18.299
is the thing and that’s why you must experience
your being.

31:18.299 --> 31:20.749
And People have seen me in many forms many
things.

31:20.749 --> 31:22.309
That’s not important.

31:22.309 --> 31:23.870
That’s not important.

31:23.870 --> 31:28.049
Important is that you must get your realization.

31:28.049 --> 31:30.799
I must be something isn’t it to do it?

31:30.799 --> 31:32.789
No doubt there must be something about me.

31:32.789 --> 31:34.929
But I don’t want to talk about it just now.

31:34.929 --> 31:38.330
I’m very tactful; you better find out.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.602
Lady: Why is peace and tranquility adjusted
on your face?

31:41.602 --> 31:48.289
On my face?

31:48.289 --> 31:49.539
You are also going to get it.

31:49.539 --> 31:51.299
That’s all I can say.

31:51.299 --> 31:53.889
It is there inside.

31:53.889 --> 31:58.269
It is all whatever is inside comes out isn’t
it?

31:58.269 --> 32:03.309
You are all peace, tranquility everything
inside you are also the same not only me.

32:03.309 --> 32:06.669
You have to just feel it.

32:06.669 --> 32:13.100
You will, you will no doubt, you will no doubt.

32:13.100 --> 32:14.100
I assure you.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.769
That’s why I’m here; I want you to enjoy
that what I am enjoying.

32:15.769 --> 32:16.850
That’s all.

32:16.850 --> 32:19.440
You see it’s like a drunkard who cannot
enjoy his drink.

32:19.440 --> 32:24.289
That’s why I say that I am a capitalist
because I have all these powers and I am the

32:24.289 --> 32:26.710
greatest communist because I must share.

32:26.710 --> 32:29.429
I can’t help it without sharing.

32:29.429 --> 32:34.919
So this such a combination, all right?
