00:07.300 --> 00:10.183
The knowledge about Kundalini

00:10.326 --> 00:18.262
has been expressed in many Sanskrit Shastras since long

00:20.721 --> 00:27.715
and also in Ayurveda it is described, not only that

00:28.091 --> 00:35.911
but the books which are for curriculum talk about Kundalini and the chakras,

00:38.108 --> 00:43.045
because Ayurveda is very, very close to Sahaja Yoga.

00:46.203 --> 00:49.915
Even in the western medicine to begin with,

00:50.035 --> 00:56.886
you should see the history they took to -dealt with three doshas.

00:57.073 --> 01:07.003
They dealt with three problems that we have as in Ayurveda.

01:08.767 --> 01:13.885
The right side which has got Pitta means bile;

01:14.005 --> 01:18.410
left side which has got Kapha means phlegm,

01:18.530 --> 01:27.072
and the central part, the problems of vayu means the gases.

01:28.659 --> 01:34.776
Now luckily so many western people have taken to Sahaja Yoga

01:35.964 --> 01:40.756
and have tried to bring down all the permutations and combinations

01:40.876 --> 01:45.891
to the simple reasoning of left, right and centre.

01:46.896 --> 01:56.526
But the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is absolutely basics;

01:57.745 --> 02:04.204
even in Ayurveda is one step away from reality,

02:05.034 --> 02:07.935
of which it says the fundamentals.

02:08.055 --> 02:13.479
So you are dealing with the fundamentals of which a human being is built.

02:14.399 --> 02:20.794
And if this knowledge was found out long time back in India,

02:21.180 --> 02:23.828
should we not accept it?

02:25.143 --> 02:28.946
The reason why people went into meditation in those days

02:29.135 --> 02:34.393
and found out all these deeper things within ourselves,

02:35.010 --> 02:38.573
because they didn’t have to fight the nature.

02:38.729 --> 02:41.886
You have seen here nature how beautiful it is.

02:43.222 --> 02:46.828
You can spend all your life under a tree,

02:47.638 --> 02:52.753
while in the West, even before getting out of the house you have to take

02:52.997 --> 02:57.527
at least 15 to 20 minutes to be prepared to go out.

02:59.854 --> 03:02.926
It’s quite a struggle.

03:03.222 --> 03:09.612
So the nature has been so kind and that is the reason people took to meditation

03:09.768 --> 03:13.566
and found out all these deeper things within themselves.

03:16.125 --> 03:22.722
When they found it out it was all written in Sanskrit language.

03:24.683 --> 03:31.323
I have such a big thick book on this, which has described all the Shakti,

03:31.746 --> 03:41.135
Pithas and all the Shri Chakras, Brahma chakra, lalita chakras and all that.

03:41.609 --> 03:48.487
But this was just written down, but hardly any person got realisation.

03:50.441 --> 03:56.582
But in any other language like Marathi or Hindi

03:56.702 --> 04:01.911
which was spoken and written by common people nothing was done.

04:02.269 --> 04:06.310
Nobody knew about it; only a few people who read about it.

04:06.573 --> 04:11.886
Especially the Shaiwas, they went into the research

04:12.006 --> 04:14.008
and they went into the world.

04:14.128 --> 04:18.237
But very few people really got realisation; very, very few.

04:19.003 --> 04:31.469
Then in the 12th century, only the Nath Panthis, who were experts of Sanskrit,

04:31.589 --> 04:33.773
who were following it rigidly,

04:33.893 --> 04:37.802
that one master, should have one disciple not more than that.

04:37.933 --> 04:40.543
This was their tradition.

04:40.997 --> 04:48.453
But in the 12th century Gyanadeva,Gnaneshwara, who was another Nath Panthi,

04:48.573 --> 04:51.355
his guru was his own brother,

04:59.315 --> 05:03.409
he asked the permission from his brother that please allow me

05:03.596 --> 05:07.394
to say all these things openly.

05:10.389 --> 05:14.405
At least to say in Marathi language

05:15.559 --> 05:20.081
because the common people don’t know anything about this knowledge.

05:20.378 --> 05:28.279
So he allowed him and he wrote the 6th chapter of Gnaneshwari

05:28.399 --> 05:31.699
in which he described Kundalini.

05:34.425 --> 05:36.774
But it was in the 12th century.

05:37.299 --> 05:41.948
After that many saints described and talked about it.

05:42.068 --> 05:44.349
Where we went yesterday to Satara,

05:44.469 --> 05:48.017
you know that’s the place where Shri Ramdasa lived.

05:50.602 --> 05:53.383
He said that Kundalini -there somebody asked him

05:53.503 --> 05:56.733
“How much time does it take to raise the Kundalini?" –

05:56.862 --> 06:00.183
he said that Tatshan. Means that moment.

06:00.303 --> 06:05.276
But the person who wants to take it should be deserving

06:05.983 --> 06:08.721
and the one who wants to give should be capable.

06:09.062 --> 06:11.532
It's a big condition.

06:11.689 --> 06:15.949
This is such a big if- a capital if I tell you.

06:16.496 --> 06:22.112
As a result very, very few peop1e got their realisation,

06:22.797 --> 06:25.280
and those who were born as realised souls

06:25.400 --> 06:27.715
found it impossible to talk to people.

06:27.835 --> 06:31.398
Gnaneshwara, such an enlightened soul himself

06:31.518 --> 06:33.930
wrote one beautiful book called “Amruta Anubhar”

06:34.050 --> 06:36.940
which I will try to translate,

06:38.401 --> 06:42.812
which is very joy giving. To me at
least it’s very great joy giving.

06:42.932 --> 06:47.685
He went so deep into the understanding of this joy.

06:48.331 --> 06:55.433
I wish English language would provide me that subtlety to translate that book.

06:55.950 --> 07:01.097
Today I was thinking we should do the Puja of Shri Chakra and Lalita Chakra

07:01.217 --> 07:03.293
which we have never done.

07:03.413 --> 07:08.077
This is the right place to do these two chakras today.

07:13.272 --> 07:18.197
A lot has been written about Shri Chakra, and about Lalita Chakra,

07:18.355 --> 07:28.715
but to understand fundamentally, the left side when it reaches up to Vishuddhi,

07:28.835 --> 07:36.379
then it uses on the right side the Shri Chakra,

07:36.499 --> 07:41.669
on the left side the Lalita Chakra, to manifest itself.

07:44.405 --> 07:54.225
These two chakras are the ones who manifest all that you see.

07:57.459 --> 08:04.618
But these chakras are the ones who emit vibrations of different kinds

08:04.834 --> 08:15.339
and because of their angularities, like if you have some sort of a cardboard

08:15.459 --> 08:19.379
attached with small-small holes of different colours

08:19.499 --> 08:22.258
which rotates all the time,

08:22.378 --> 08:25.362
you get different colours, also you can get

08:25.482 --> 08:28.532
different permutations and combinations.

08:30.202 --> 08:36.342
In the same way different permutations and combinations are created,

08:36.462 --> 08:40.819
and that is how you get all the advantages of Sahaja Yoga.

08:41.719 --> 08:44.608
So these two chakras are very important.

08:44.749 --> 08:49.872
I do not know if you know of any mantras about Shri Chakra

08:49.992 --> 08:53.842
but I'll give you a book. Later on I'll translate it to you

08:53.962 --> 08:58.657
and you can compose something for Shri Chakra.

09:00.167 --> 09:04.011
Shri Chakra on the right side, Lalita Chakra on the left side.

09:04.131 --> 09:06.741
So what we are really worshipping today is

09:06.861 --> 09:12.802
Maha Saraswati Power and Maha Kali Power both put together.

09:12.987 --> 09:17.812
So now we've started combining things, not individually.

09:18.858 --> 09:23.069
Now these two energies are very important.

09:23.979 --> 09:29.040
Without the energy, without the power, nothing exists,

09:29.374 --> 09:37.882
for example if this light had no power to give light or to burn it is useless.

09:41.217 --> 09:48.553
In the same way without getting your realisation, you are useless,

09:48.673 --> 09:52.046
because your power is not awakened.

09:52.210 --> 09:54.030
At least not completely.

09:54.150 --> 10:08.800
But these two powers, give us lots of benefits even without realisation.

10:11.077 --> 10:13.373
Whatever you see in this world created,

10:13.493 --> 10:19.303
is done by these two chakras of the Adi Shakti.

10:21.256 --> 10:26.405
But here the power doesn't move, it's not moving.

10:27.016 --> 10:37.166
But in the human being the power starts moving, and when it starts moving

10:37.286 --> 10:46.246
then we can say it is creating another world.

10:46.366 --> 10:50.345
But movement is not the only thing.

10:50.983 --> 10:57.042
This power acts, gives you intelligence, gives you all kinds of things

10:57.162 --> 11:00.576
which you have as human beings.

11:02.053 --> 11:07.843
But later on, this power itself becomes enlightened within you.

11:08.574 --> 11:14.834
In the left and right side both become enlightened.

11:15.068 --> 11:20.924
This enlightenment, you get it when you get yourself realisation,

11:21.121 --> 11:26.260
but not immediately, not immediately, this one should understand.

11:26.380 --> 11:34.427
For example, if you have pain, or if your chakra is catching,

11:35.098 --> 11:38.001
you have to use your hands.

11:38.121 --> 11:40.843
You cannot say that, 'the energy is flowing within me,

11:40.964 --> 11:44.991
it's alright, I can manage', it's not like that.

11:45.111 --> 11:53.650
You have to use your hands to impart that power to yourself or to others.

11:53.770 --> 11:58.886
If you have pain in the stomach, then
you can say that if there's energy

11:59.006 --> 12:04.079
in my stomach why should I have pain in the stomach?

12:04.371 --> 12:08.152
But the play of these chakras has to come,

12:09.425 --> 12:20.355
and that is why you have to use your power of your hands.

12:22.501 --> 12:30.215
If you cannot use your hands, then you cannot impart this energy.

12:31.246 --> 12:32.649
Many people have asked me,

12:32.769 --> 12:38.701
that Mother, when will it move horizontal?

12:40.015 --> 12:45.125
It will move horizontal no doubt, it does,

12:45.245 --> 12:48.218
but even that horizontal movement

12:48.338 --> 12:54.432
is to be guided by these two very important chakras.

12:55.265 --> 13:00.635
So you must understand the importance of these two chakras within yourself.

13:00.755 --> 13:05.154
That's why I have told many a times, don't move your head too many times,

13:05.335 --> 13:11.425
and this way many people talk, this style of talking, "no, this, that,"

13:11.687 --> 13:15.028
very common with French specially.

13:15.148 --> 13:19.759
That's another way you are not respecting your chakras,

13:19.879 --> 13:23.448
shouldn't move your shoulders too much.

13:23.568 --> 13:31.139
Mostly they talk like this, its anti-chakras, anti-chakras.

13:31.259 --> 13:34.820
Should keep your shoulders straight.

13:34.991 --> 13:41.106
When you are singing you can move your whole upper part,

13:41.226 --> 13:46.309
is all right, but not your shoulders.

13:46.429 --> 13:49.843
This is the thing, one has to understand,

13:49.963 --> 13:54.156
that these two centres are to be looked after.

13:54.598 --> 14:00.028
You can move your neck, your body when you are singing,

14:00.148 --> 14:02.815
is important, that helps,

14:04.399 --> 14:07.182
but not your shoulders.

14:07.352 --> 14:10.513
Shoulders are to be kept intact,

14:10.874 --> 14:15.661
but while saying just yes, you need not go on "yes, yes, yes, yes."

14:15.781 --> 14:20.349
Is very very simple thing, but it can have a very bad effect,

14:20.469 --> 14:26.138
and those who move their shoulders too much do not feel vibrations much

14:26.258 --> 14:31.219
because the chakras are not alright.

14:34.547 --> 14:37.223
It's a very simple thing to be understood

14:37.343 --> 14:40.950
that they are the most important chakras we have

14:41.070 --> 14:46.849
and whatever is to be used out of this Paramachaitanya,

14:46.969 --> 14:52.169
they have to be used by these two centres.

14:52.289 --> 14:56.934
Even supposing your some chakra is catching on your spinal cord,

14:57.054 --> 15:00.367
you have to use your hands.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.176
Somebody can say, "I can just put my attention."

15:04.296 --> 15:07.281
Doesn't work out, that good.

15:08.448 --> 15:11.034
Because yet your attention has not that,

15:11.154 --> 15:13.909
reached that stage where these chakras,

15:14.187 --> 15:22.298
like Lalita Chakra and Shri Chakra obey your attention, they do not.

15:25.264 --> 15:29.934
So you have to work out with your hands, be careful,

15:30.054 --> 15:33.052
don't move your shoulders too much.

15:33.172 --> 15:38.606
And, if you see now Indians when they sing bhajans, they move the whole body.

15:38.726 --> 15:41.590
They'll do like this, but never their shoulders.

15:41.710 --> 15:47.201
The shoulders will move in the same way as the neck is moving.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.080
They might move their neck also.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.786
But they'll never move their shoulder like this,

15:51.906 --> 15:57.484
and it's regarded as inauspicious according to Indian standards.

15:58.890 --> 16:04.869
Because of this culture, based on what the saints have told,

16:05.023 --> 16:08.419
and also about many seers have told,

16:08.539 --> 16:13.562
it is more related to spiritual life than to materialistic life.

16:15.047 --> 16:16.622
Now the materialistic life,

16:16.742 --> 16:20.367
unless and until there is the foundation of the spiritual life,

16:20.487 --> 16:27.717
takes you to a very partial development, we can say.

16:27.837 --> 16:38.496
But to get a full development, you must have your foundation on spirituality.

16:39.817 --> 16:43.556
That's why spirituality being the foundation has to be deep,

16:43.676 --> 16:49.967
has to be fully equipped, has to be absolutely perfect.

16:50.087 --> 16:53.367
Then the whole building can be built.

16:54.468 --> 16:59.903
It's gone wrong in the West, doesn't matter, now you can build it up,

17:00.023 --> 17:06.082
and then, you'll be surprised how you become really solid people.

17:08.960 --> 17:13.138
This is a very short talk about Shri Chakra.

17:13.258 --> 17:16.114
I think I should sit down and write all about it,

17:16.234 --> 17:20.570
and it will be nice handy thing for you to read.

17:22.538 --> 17:28.501
But you must know, that, beyond thought when you go,

17:30.545 --> 17:35.549
these chakras become extremely efficient,

17:35.669 --> 17:40.429
because the thought puts a pressure on them,

17:40.593 --> 17:44.085
and because of the pressure the movement of these chakras

17:44.205 --> 17:47.201
is very slow and ineffective.

17:47.406 --> 17:53.289
But once you can get out of your thoughts and go into thoughtless awareness,

17:53.445 --> 17:55.896
then these chakras start working it out

17:56.031 --> 17:59.933
and you start moving much deeper into your own being.
