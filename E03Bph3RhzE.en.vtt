WEBVTT

00:02.344 --> 00:06.844
It was very spontaneously decided

00:07.004 --> 00:16.804
that we should have the Devi Puja in England.

00:21.636 --> 00:26.078
And this is the place where really Devi Puja should be,

00:26.238 --> 00:29.717
because it’s the place of Sadashiva

00:29.877 --> 00:33.717
and where Adi Shakti should be worshipped.

00:44.989 --> 00:50.509
We have to today understand

00:51.005 --> 00:55.325
that why do we do Devi Puja?

00:56.550 --> 01:03.390
What is the reason for this Devi Puja?

01:04.021 --> 01:06.940
What do we get out of it?

01:07.100 --> 01:12.735
What are we supposed to achieve in our contents

01:12.895 --> 01:16.049
within ourselves?

01:19.007 --> 01:25.927
The first thing is that Kundalini is the Devi.

01:26.637 --> 01:30.157
She’s the reflection of the Adi Shakti.

01:31.630 --> 01:34.817
So when you worship Devi,

01:34.977 --> 01:39.219
first you worship also your own Kundalini

01:39.379 --> 01:46.384
by giving Her credit because She has given you this realization.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.918
It’s much deeper understanding

01:50.078 --> 01:53.847
than normally people have about the Devi Puja

01:54.007 --> 01:57.428
because they are not realized souls.

01:57.588 --> 02:00.079
Their Kundalini not is awakened.

02:00.239 --> 02:03.590
So normally when they do Devi Puja it’s for the purpose

02:03.750 --> 02:05.566
of getting realization

02:05.726 --> 02:08.205
so that the Devi should be pleased

02:08.365 --> 02:11.927
– prasanna – and should give them realization,

02:12.087 --> 02:15.337
or must get our chance to get to somebody

02:15.497 --> 02:19.045
who will give them realization.

02:20.620 --> 02:23.534
But you are at a different level now.

02:23.694 --> 02:28.124
So it’s more of a thanksgiving to your own Kundalini

02:28.284 --> 02:30.550
and to Adi Shakti,

02:30.710 --> 02:37.379
glorifying that whatever has happened so miraculously

02:37.539 --> 02:41.062
is because of the Kundalini which was within you,

02:41.222 --> 02:47.214
which was reflected by the Adi Shakti.

02:49.061 --> 02:53.426
But one has to know that

02:53.802 --> 03:02.061
only we are realized souls is not the point,

03:02.221 --> 03:07.101
only that we can feel the vibrations is not the point,

03:08.501 --> 03:14.022
that we can give realizations to other is also not the point.

03:16.654 --> 03:20.830
Then what is it? Very important –

03:20.990 --> 03:24.791
it’s the content within us.

03:25.130 --> 03:29.734
What do we have within us is the point.

03:29.894 --> 03:33.487
These are all the expressions of what we have within.

03:33.647 --> 03:37.469
Supposing somebody is generous,

03:37.629 --> 03:42.950
then know that he’s a rich man, otherwise he cannot be.

03:43.110 --> 03:48.390
So the content within us, we have to see.

03:49.364 --> 03:53.714
And when we start seeing the content,

03:58.390 --> 04:03.096
where do we find in the nature there is real content?

04:03.256 --> 04:10.321
We see the sea; sea is there you see, full of water.

04:12.182 --> 04:16.384
So much of water it sucks in from everywhere,

04:16.544 --> 04:22.119
and then it allows itself to be boiled by the sun

04:22.279 --> 04:25.463
and gives rain.

04:29.214 --> 04:33.671
But sea is the lowest level,

04:34.188 --> 04:35.872
stands at the lowest level

04:36.032 --> 04:40.373
and sucks in all the water from everywhere.

04:42.070 --> 04:46.607
In the same way a Sahaja yogi must know that

04:46.767 --> 04:53.119
to be really achieving more content,

04:53.279 --> 05:03.039
we have to be not at a higher level outside.

05:05.215 --> 05:07.871
It’s said in the Bible, “You have to be meek,”

05:08.031 --> 05:11.022
but I think it was not explained to people.

05:11.182 --> 05:16.296
Only the strong people can be meek,

05:16.456 --> 05:19.543
secured people can be meek,

05:19.703 --> 05:25.254
only the rich in essence can be meek,

05:25.414 --> 05:31.881
not the people who are insecured.

05:32.041 --> 05:36.621
Because they are insecured, how can they be meek?

05:38.830 --> 05:44.438
And not the people whom we think are rich, so-called,

05:44.598 --> 05:48.584
because if they are rich they are not generous,

05:48.744 --> 05:53.335
they are not satisfied, they are not philanthropic,

05:53.495 --> 05:58.677
so they are not rich. They are still greedy beggars.

06:01.366 --> 06:07.159
So the content within us is to be seen. What is our content?

06:10.246 --> 06:15.275
You love Me, I love you – it’s very good.

06:17.941 --> 06:23.141
But when you love Me,

06:23.765 --> 06:28.198
you have to know that there are certain qualities

06:28.358 --> 06:32.398
which are very lovable in a Sahaja yogi.

06:33.910 --> 06:38.726
Actually people get lost even after Sahaja Yoga.

06:38.886 --> 06:41.726
They think they can get over everything,

06:41.886 --> 06:44.206
they’re perfectly all right,

06:44.366 --> 06:48.322
and they are thrown overboard.

06:52.519 --> 06:55.085
So when we say that we have to be meek,

06:55.245 --> 07:00.608
this is a content, the humility is a content.

07:01.020 --> 07:05.860
So try to that, try to be humble with someone.

07:06.020 --> 07:09.260
You’ll like yourself.

07:11.900 --> 07:15.564
You’ll enjoy that quality within this that,

07:15.724 --> 07:19.971
“You see, I’m humbler than another person.”

07:20.947 --> 07:25.350
And what is another thing we find has content

07:25.604 --> 07:29.053
are the great mountains,

07:29.213 --> 07:32.500
because they have heights

07:32.660 --> 07:38.892
and they are the only ones who can capture the clouds.

07:39.052 --> 07:41.380
So such a rapport there is

07:41.540 --> 07:46.965
between the humility of the ocean

07:47.125 --> 07:51.349
and the heights of the mountain.

07:51.509 --> 07:54.661
That’s how a Sahaja yogi should be.

07:54.821 --> 08:02.541
He is too high because so much of

08:07.474 --> 08:10.980
content is there in that ocean,

08:11.140 --> 08:14.340
then it has become beautiful

08:14.500 --> 08:22.700
like clouds and touched his height, his Kailasha

08:22.860 --> 08:25.915
where resides the Shiva.

08:26.075 --> 08:30.435
So it’s so joy-giving.

08:31.883 --> 08:35.060
Of course as you have painted Me there,

08:35.220 --> 08:39.340
it’s true that was My situation once upon a time.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.900
Today also it is My situation no doubt,

08:42.060 --> 08:43.860
in a very subtle manner,

08:44.020 --> 08:47.100
because there’s so much of negativity

08:47.260 --> 08:54.460
and I have to work it out on all kinds of levels.

09:00.883 --> 09:04.940
There is no excuse for some human being to be a devil,

09:05.100 --> 09:09.474
no excuse, and for a Sahaja yogi there is no excuse at all.

09:09.634 --> 09:13.475
But still once I have called you My son, My child,

09:13.635 --> 09:16.836
there is a little blessing;

09:16.996 --> 09:21.964
goes, I would say, a long rope.

09:23.300 --> 09:29.380
But that long rope one should not care for.

09:29.540 --> 09:34.060
You have to care for your own quality,

09:34.220 --> 09:39.780
for your own inner capacity to suck in.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.388
Now look at the ocean as it is.

09:43.548 --> 09:50.211
All that is around falls into the ocean, everything.

09:50.796 --> 09:57.005
And then the sun – we can say that’s the Spirit – evaporates.

09:57.165 --> 10:00.548
Only possible in the ocean.

10:00.708 --> 10:03.940
It doesn’t evaporate the rivers so much as it can

10:04.100 --> 10:06.685
because it’s such a wide thing, such a deep thing,

10:06.845 --> 10:10.000
inexhaustible.

10:10.160 --> 10:17.080
And then absolutely pure material comes out of that,

10:17.703 --> 10:22.078
and that can go and touch the heart.

10:22.238 --> 10:26.121
Because as a Sahaja Yogi those hearts are at a very high level

10:26.281 --> 10:32.059
where there is Shiva residing.

10:32.703 --> 10:37.823
Nobody can reach there except for the purity,

10:38.207 --> 10:42.807
and unless and until you have that largeness,

10:42.999 --> 10:49.538
that depth, that humility, and the maryadas.

10:49.698 --> 10:54.440
You know that sea never leaves its own maryadas,

10:54.600 --> 10:58.720
and if you press it from one end it will express on one other side –

10:58.880 --> 11:00.640
it never leaves.

11:00.800 --> 11:04.560
If Pacific Ocean was

11:04.720 --> 11:09.048
even hundred feet deeper there would have been a problem.

11:09.208 --> 11:15.160
So even in depth, in its height, in its spreading

11:15.320 --> 11:17.208
it has its own maryadas.

11:17.368 --> 11:22.320
But in that maryada he has the feeling

11:22.480 --> 11:26.088
that he is one with the nature, one with Mother.

11:26.248 --> 11:29.897
He is not disturbing the Mother Earth,

11:30.057 --> 11:35.124
nicely placed in the body of Mother Earth.

11:36.823 --> 11:40.680
Nature is bound by the Divine.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.840
The Divine looks after the nature.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.526
So everything works out beautifully and you have freedom.

11:47.686 --> 11:52.186
And after Sahaja Yoga you have greater freedom,

11:53.000 --> 11:57.136
absolute freedom, because you cannot be bound

11:57.296 --> 12:04.520
by anything nonsensical, anything sinful, anything base.

12:04.680 --> 12:10.176
You are above that like a mountain.

12:11.245 --> 12:15.537
And so wherever there is a combination

12:15.697 --> 12:20.898
of a mountain and an ocean, the ships can come.

12:21.934 --> 12:25.352
Deep people can only come to such shores

12:25.512 --> 12:28.207
where there is depth.

12:28.367 --> 12:31.600
That’s how you achieve your depth,

12:31.760 --> 12:37.960
between your Heart and your Bhavasagara,

12:38.248 --> 12:41.633
that beautiful area where people can come to you

12:41.793 --> 12:46.425
and just they know this is something great,

12:49.974 --> 12:53.440
everybody knows that.

12:53.600 --> 12:57.720
You have seen that I am like any other woman to look at.

12:57.880 --> 13:02.574
I don’t know, you might think I am different, but normally…

13:03.167 --> 13:07.200
But how many people come to My program?

13:07.360 --> 13:10.345
How do they come to My program? Must think.

13:10.505 --> 13:15.418
In Colombia when nobody had even heard My name,

13:22.943 --> 13:26.560
thousands came – I mean, very surprising.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.148
And people had no place to sit.

13:30.308 --> 13:33.751
In Russia where, I mean, no question of My, their knowing My name,

13:33.911 --> 13:38.020
there are no books published, nothing.

13:40.960 --> 13:44.080
So you can say that, “Mother,

13:44.240 --> 13:48.942
You manipulate it through the collective unconscious.”

13:49.102 --> 13:53.542
I do not, but it does – I think so.

13:55.120 --> 14:02.345
So when the Sahaja yogis have that content within themselves,

14:02.534 --> 14:06.208
the collective unconscious,

14:06.368 --> 14:11.968
the Divine will act, definitely act.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.440
Like a person who is spreading advertisements,

14:16.600 --> 14:19.880
this that, yes people come.

14:20.040 --> 14:25.200
Because he takes money they think they can purchase this man.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.040
But where there is no money involved,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.728
no business involved, nothing,

14:29.888 --> 14:36.465
you people are just simple people just like them, so?

14:37.407 --> 14:42.167
But it’s all done by the Divine, isn’t it?

14:43.727 --> 14:47.520
So the Divine works it out.

14:47.680 --> 14:54.095
But if the Sahaja yogis in a place are good for nothing,

14:54.255 --> 14:59.447
then even if I am there it does not work.

14:59.607 --> 15:03.967
Half-hearted people if they are it does not work.

15:04.399 --> 15:07.665
In no way to discourage you but to tell you

15:07.825 --> 15:11.471
that you have to develop your content within yourself,

15:11.631 --> 15:15.408
a complete faith in yourself.

15:15.568 --> 15:20.808
This is the greatest property of a Sahaja yogi.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.744
And what is this ocean?

15:24.904 --> 15:29.264
It’s love, it’s love and love.

15:31.360 --> 15:35.843
It doesn’t talk, it doesn’t do much, nothing is to be done in this.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.800
It just works spontaneously.

15:38.960 --> 15:42.440
The less you do the better.

15:43.320 --> 15:47.366
The more you try to do, “I will do this, manipulate there”, no,

15:47.526 --> 15:51.950
you just develop your content within yourself.

15:56.079 --> 15:58.504
And imagine, you are all so lucky,

15:58.664 --> 16:01.591
you have so many provisions which nobody had.

16:01.751 --> 16:05.192
They had to go into jungles, they had to

16:05.352 --> 16:09.207
take all the wrath of their gurus

16:09.367 --> 16:13.963
and nobody to protect them.

16:15.037 --> 16:19.834
And they never had Adi Shakti to worship.

16:22.016 --> 16:24.360
So you have Adi Shakti with you,

16:24.520 --> 16:29.280
whose power is all this Divine.

16:30.149 --> 16:33.880
So you are at such an advantageous position.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.865
But first you must realize.

16:37.025 --> 16:40.920
So when we say we should have content,

16:41.080 --> 16:45.280
then the vessel has to be strong

16:46.031 --> 16:50.520
otherwise everything will break.

16:50.680 --> 16:54.214
And this strength is the one you should know,

16:54.374 --> 16:58.654
that you are completely protected.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.089
No one can harm you.

17:01.249 --> 17:02.376
They’ll try.

17:02.536 --> 17:04.938
This has to be otherwise how will you test

17:05.098 --> 17:08.320
whether you are absolutely safe or not.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.726
So somebody has to try some tricks

17:11.886 --> 17:17.826
just to see and for you to watch how you are successful.

17:17.986 --> 17:20.200
Without doing anything you’ll be amazed,

17:20.360 --> 17:22.386
everything will be cleared out.

17:22.546 --> 17:24.984
And you’ll not know how things have cleared out,

17:25.144 --> 17:28.864
how things have worked out.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.640
So the strength comes.

17:33.800 --> 17:38.180
Again the question is how the strength comes into a Sahaja yogi.

17:38.340 --> 17:41.985
There I would say it’s the shraddha.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.688
Shraddha is not blind faith.

17:44.848 --> 17:48.400
After Sahaja Yoga, after realization

17:48.560 --> 17:51.800
you know everything.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.446
You’ve seen My photographs,

17:56.606 --> 17:58.960
you have seen how Sahaja Yoga works,

17:59.120 --> 18:01.950
you’ve seen how you can raise the Kundalini of people,

18:02.110 --> 18:06.073
you can feel the vibrations;

18:07.855 --> 18:11.271
you can feel others', you can cure others.

18:11.431 --> 18:13.960
All this power is within you.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.960
But just to realize

18:18.958 --> 18:23.560
that power without ego is your strength.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.960
And when you are powerful you don’t have the ego

18:26.120 --> 18:28.296
because what is the need there?

18:28.456 --> 18:32.120
Ego is there only when you don’t have power

18:32.280 --> 18:35.864
because you want to have more, more, more.

18:36.024 --> 18:41.596
But when you are fully there, there’s no ego.

18:41.800 --> 18:46.952
So this power is to be ascertained first,

18:47.112 --> 18:51.280
to find out whether you are powerful or not,

18:51.440 --> 18:53.608
to find out first.

18:53.768 --> 18:56.935
And then, like if I’ve to sit on the chair I’ll see,

18:57.095 --> 18:58.872
“Is it all right or it’s shaking?"

18:59.032 --> 19:02.312
"Oh it’s all right, I can sit on this.”

19:07.899 --> 19:12.280
Some Sahaja yogis still remain on the periphery.

19:12.440 --> 19:18.000
There’s sometimes a very big gap between some

19:18.160 --> 19:21.000
who have reached great heights and some

19:21.160 --> 19:23.760
who are outside.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.840
All these are negative forces

19:26.000 --> 19:29.240
which were killed long time back.

19:33.728 --> 19:38.248
Only one Shakti was sufficient to kill them,

19:39.344 --> 19:44.258
of Kali Shakti, Durga Shakti,

19:44.495 --> 19:48.615
but you have so many of them.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.847
You have Mahalakshmi Shakti,

19:53.007 --> 19:55.354
you’ve got Saraswati Shakti,

19:55.514 --> 20:00.194
you have all the twelve deities are there working for you.

20:05.840 --> 20:12.113
So “realizing it” is the meaning that

20:12.273 --> 20:17.246
you must have complete faith in yourself.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.988
If you still doubt yourself,

20:23.727 --> 20:26.440
that’s also a human quality.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.033
I mean a dog knows that he’s a dog.

20:29.193 --> 20:34.048
He doesn’t doubt that he’s a dog, or a cat, does he?

20:36.160 --> 20:37.800
Or a tiger knows he’s a tiger,

20:37.960 --> 20:40.240
and he knows what capacities he’s got.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.726
It’s only the human beings have got apart from other

20:43.886 --> 20:49.446
stupid qualities is one, this, that they can doubt themselves.

20:55.400 --> 21:02.320
And this doubting quality has made them cowards.

21:02.480 --> 21:08.120
In Sahaja Yoga you should have no doubts about yourself,

21:09.440 --> 21:11.945
“Because I’m doing, still doing like this, Mother,

21:12.105 --> 21:14.903
I am still doing like this, then how?”

21:15.063 --> 21:18.040
Then get rid of it!

21:18.200 --> 21:19.960
I mean, how can I solve your problem

21:20.120 --> 21:22.440
if you want to carry monkey on your back?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.560
And I’m still carrying the monkey on your back.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.960
You get rid of the monkey, finished.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.160
It’s so simple. I mean to My simple logic,

21:29.320 --> 21:32.431
this is what is the answer.

21:32.591 --> 21:35.378
Why do you want to carry the monkey and then come and tell Me,

21:35.538 --> 21:42.230
“Mother, I am carrying the monkey”? I can see it!

21:44.670 --> 21:49.536
Get it off your head! Get it off your back!

21:49.696 --> 21:53.970
It’s very simple, you are a Sahaja yogi.

21:56.614 --> 21:59.477
And this is what I’ve found about Russians.

21:59.637 --> 22:02.440
They didn’t have any monkeys really, very surprising.

22:02.600 --> 22:06.344
I think there are no monkeys at all there.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.292
None of them!

22:10.880 --> 22:15.000
No private problems, no public problems, no any other problem,

22:15.160 --> 22:19.567
nothing, nothing, they discuss nothing.

22:19.727 --> 22:22.157
This is the, they could have said that

22:22.317 --> 22:26.368
“Our government is such, it’s…”, nothing, nothing, nothing.

22:26.528 --> 22:29.160
They had enough of everything, they must have.

22:29.320 --> 22:32.053
Very well-read people, very well-educated,

22:32.213 --> 22:35.622
very big professions, very humble,

22:35.782 --> 22:41.293
very open-hearted; they just wanted realization, that’s all.

22:41.453 --> 22:43.960
They said, “You have come here for our liberation.”

22:44.120 --> 22:46.448
They would even touch My sari like that.

22:46.608 --> 22:50.254
The place I walk they would touch, just imagine.

22:50.414 --> 22:55.730
Who has told them about vibrations? I never said I am Adi Shakti.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.022
How did they recognize Me?

22:59.182 --> 23:04.734
They developed that strength within themselves, that shraddha.

23:04.894 --> 23:07.455
And they never talked about God in that country.

23:07.615 --> 23:09.735
They have some stupid people who have

23:09.895 --> 23:15.565
churches and things like that and Islamic institutions, but

23:15.725 --> 23:19.920
most of the people are so strong

23:20.080 --> 23:23.120
and the content is showing itself.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.720
Imagine every time they have a program,

23:25.880 --> 23:27.480
even now on follow-on,

23:27.640 --> 23:31.880
at least one thousand people are there.

23:34.135 --> 23:39.484
In this England we can’t even get one thousand for Devi Puja.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.998
And they come all the way from thousands of miles,

23:43.158 --> 23:46.120
from Siberia, this, that.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.647
And they have booked themselves,

23:47.807 --> 23:50.560
because there the halls you have to pay for.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.840
So though the Sahaja yogis don’t take money, but they pay for halls.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.030
But the mediocrity to be on the periphery,

23:59.190 --> 24:03.096
not to work it out, take it easy,

24:04.426 --> 24:07.880
not the way for Sahaja Yoga.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.800
We don’t have to kill demons.

24:10.960 --> 24:17.240
There’s no need to join any war

24:17.560 --> 24:23.800
or to fight like soldiers as they fought with Devi, nothing.

24:24.560 --> 24:27.920
You have just to take out the negativity within yourself,

24:28.080 --> 24:32.805
lethargy from you, but work it out.

24:34.920 --> 24:38.845
We say mantras, we know what are the powers of the mantras are,

24:39.005 --> 24:42.320
but you have to keep them awakened.

24:42.480 --> 24:46.920
For that I have told you a hundred times, you must meditate.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.240
Not the way to meditate,

24:48.400 --> 24:50.800
"All right, it’s like playing golf, sort of."

24:50.960 --> 24:56.080
It’s not that way. It’s a serious thing,

24:56.240 --> 25:01.008
you are worshipping the Adi Shakti.

25:01.168 --> 25:07.712
With that complete understanding and dedication

25:08.103 --> 25:13.680
you have to do it; not a mechanical thing, it’s not a game.

25:13.840 --> 25:18.044
It’s something very subtle and special.

25:18.360 --> 25:23.216
In no action we can describe it,

25:23.400 --> 25:31.160
but it’s just a very deep feeling.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.800
To that depth no other feeling goes;

25:34.975 --> 25:38.521
with that feeling you have to meditate.

25:38.681 --> 25:40.629
And then see the results.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.360
Many people say, “I’ve done this, Mother, I’ve done that.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.680
I’ve this still” –

25:45.840 --> 25:51.520
because you are not deep enough.

25:53.113 --> 25:58.000
It’s not how much you pray,

25:58.160 --> 26:02.440
it’s not how many words you use for prayer,

26:02.600 --> 26:07.774
but it is how deeply you have touched

26:09.040 --> 26:17.240
the feet of the Divine that is important.

26:18.080 --> 26:23.275
So today we have to see that

26:23.435 --> 26:30.387
Devi is using Her sword to pierce through our heart

26:32.040 --> 26:35.120
so that all negativity runs away,

26:35.280 --> 26:41.193
and through that She wants to plant the lotus

26:41.353 --> 26:44.393
for Shiva to settle down.

26:44.880 --> 26:50.480
She wants to take away all that ugliness from within.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.840
It’s like an operation

26:53.000 --> 26:57.360
but so delicate and so beautifully done,

26:57.520 --> 26:59.640
you never even felt it.

26:59.800 --> 27:03.760
The other day somebody gave Me a book of on the Devi's

27:03.920 --> 27:07.160
and the vibrations are called as 'spanda' – means 'pulsation'

27:07.320 --> 27:09.480
– it’s correct, no doubt,

27:09.640 --> 27:12.520
and it’s called as 'anahata' in Sanskrit language,

27:12.680 --> 27:15.160
meaning 'without percussions'.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.080
But I was reading that book, I said,

27:17.240 --> 27:21.040
“It’s like going round and round, up and down,

27:21.200 --> 27:23.360
going into ‘this means, that means'."

27:23.560 --> 27:26.480
How can anybody understand this book, it’s so terrible!

27:26.640 --> 27:30.000
While I have said all these things and much more than this,

27:30.160 --> 27:34.200
and they know it so easily.

27:34.360 --> 27:38.880
If you read that book, two pages, you’ll get a headache, I tell you.

27:39.040 --> 27:42.360
But how the whole knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

27:42.520 --> 27:47.160
has come to you so beautifully,

27:48.480 --> 27:52.920
it’s very remarkable, I tell you.

27:56.160 --> 28:01.560
If you read the mantras they’ll give you explanations

28:01.720 --> 28:04.903
which has nothing to do with reality sometimes, I feel.

28:05.063 --> 28:12.023
But even if it has, it’s so circuitous, so complicated.

28:15.588 --> 28:18.641
I would say Adi Shankaracharya realized it and that’s why

28:18.801 --> 28:21.565
He gave up the idea of writing any treatises and,

28:21.725 --> 28:24.120
“Let’s make it simple, the praise of the Mother." Finished.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.480
"If you praise the Mother, everything okay.”

28:26.640 --> 28:29.518
But that’s not. I find that’s not so, it’s easy.

28:29.678 --> 28:31.760
You see, human beings are great experts,

28:31.920 --> 28:34.520
they can be just like radios praising, praising.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.938
Nothing goes inside the heart.

28:41.485 --> 28:45.205
But you have to develop that depth.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.440
In Sahaja Yoga we work through our heart,

28:47.600 --> 28:50.160
not through our brains.

28:50.392 --> 28:53.972
You have to develop that heart

28:56.342 --> 29:04.288
and to receive into it the greatness of other people.

29:06.856 --> 29:11.999
Now people can see what’s wrong with others very easily.

29:12.159 --> 29:15.033
They don’t want to see what’s wrong with them.

29:15.193 --> 29:16.857
Any intelligent man can see that,

29:17.017 --> 29:19.285
there’s no need to have his realization.

29:19.445 --> 29:22.320
But a wise person sees what’s wrong with him

29:22.480 --> 29:25.640
and he trusts. He trusts

29:25.800 --> 29:30.521
himself then because he’s wise.

29:31.776 --> 29:35.575
He doesn’t doubt, he knows he’s wise.

29:35.735 --> 29:39.408
He knows what’s wrong with him and what is to be done.

29:39.568 --> 29:45.512
So the work of the Goddess is very different today,

29:45.672 --> 29:47.639
as you can see it clearly.

29:47.799 --> 29:52.279
Of course, symbolically it is the same

29:52.607 --> 29:56.534
but it has become very subtle, very subtle.

29:56.694 --> 30:01.534
The first work is to destroy the negativity

30:01.960 --> 30:03.983
which is going on as you know.

30:04.143 --> 30:07.279
The more light comes in, the ignorance will disappear.

30:07.439 --> 30:11.085
This light will spread, all the darkness will go away.

30:11.245 --> 30:14.925
But you are the lights.

30:16.191 --> 30:19.400
You have to put the lights on

30:19.752 --> 30:22.048
and you have to look after your light,

30:22.208 --> 30:27.888
and you have to make that light eternal.

30:30.078 --> 30:35.718
This is one work which you are doing.

30:37.680 --> 30:41.160
It’s a beautiful work of the Goddess you are doing

30:41.320 --> 30:46.760
is to spread light, enlighten people.

30:47.040 --> 30:50.560
The negativity that is around you

30:50.720 --> 30:54.520
is not so dangerous as whatever is in you.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.453
Today it has become subtler.

30:57.613 --> 31:00.280
The negativity has become subtler.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.688
It’s entered into your being,

31:02.848 --> 31:07.807
and be careful – it may anytime topple you.

31:11.126 --> 31:13.926
Even one step

31:14.320 --> 31:16.825
you do not put right when you are climbing up,

31:16.985 --> 31:19.505
you can go down.

31:19.854 --> 31:23.665
So one has to be alert, without tension.

31:23.825 --> 31:27.150
You have to be alert without tension.

31:27.310 --> 31:30.880
And the alertness grows.

31:31.040 --> 31:35.432
When the light goes within you start seeing it.

31:35.592 --> 31:37.967
Immediately you see, “Oh, that’s it!

31:38.127 --> 31:42.293
So I, the so and so – that’s it!”

31:42.453 --> 31:47.079
And you know how to correct it and you know how to put it right.

31:47.239 --> 31:48.880
And immediately you take to it.

31:49.040 --> 31:53.720
Like a good sari now has something fallen on it,

31:53.880 --> 31:57.120
immediately you clean it.

31:59.279 --> 32:07.745
In the same way we have to be very, very alert;

32:07.905 --> 32:10.695
'daksha' is the word for that.

32:10.855 --> 32:14.801
Now this was the work of the Goddess before.

32:14.961 --> 32:17.280
Goddess used to give enlightenment

32:17.440 --> 32:20.049
and Goddess used to be alert for you.

32:20.209 --> 32:24.249
She would sit like a tigress for Her children.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.600
They are praying, they are doing puja,

32:26.760 --> 32:31.409
they are doing some sort of a homa, havana,

32:31.569 --> 32:34.397
so the Goddess would sit down, protect them

32:34.557 --> 32:36.816
from all negativity coming,

32:36.976 --> 32:40.109
all rakshasas coming, kill them, this, do that.

32:40.269 --> 32:46.372
But that stage is gone now. Now She’s entered into you.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.366
So you have to kill your negativity,

32:50.526 --> 32:55.308
you’ve become as powerful as your Mother.

32:56.368 --> 33:00.648
No negativity can touch you.

33:01.489 --> 33:06.207
So you can give realization, you’ve got that power very well;

33:06.367 --> 33:12.727
and you can watch your defects more than that of others.

33:13.880 --> 33:17.400
And you try to put them out because they’re not good,

33:17.560 --> 33:21.760
they’re not for your benevolence, they’re not for your ascent.

33:21.920 --> 33:25.263
By that nobody is going to gain.

33:26.085 --> 33:30.313
At the collective level it just works automatically.

33:30.473 --> 33:32.084
You don’t have to worry.

33:32.244 --> 33:36.480
It comes to culmination and a person goes out;

33:36.640 --> 33:40.640
as if somebody runs up like a blind fellow

33:40.800 --> 33:43.520
on a cliff and jumps, jumps down.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.040
You don’t have to worry too much about this.

33:46.200 --> 33:50.940
It just works. You have seen it has worked that way.

33:54.513 --> 33:57.841
Now another quality that you have:

33:58.001 --> 34:00.400
to believe that Goddess is working through you.

34:00.560 --> 34:04.480
In you She resides, you have got the powers,

34:04.640 --> 34:07.160
it’s penetrated into you

34:07.320 --> 34:14.720
is that you can comfort people, you can cure them,

34:16.920 --> 34:22.202
you can give them peace, you can give them bliss.

34:22.527 --> 34:25.680
But then what Goddess has done in you is that

34:25.840 --> 34:30.208
She has given you the bliss, you have become bliss.

34:30.399 --> 34:34.680
Like there’s say a cool air-conditioner,

34:34.840 --> 34:36.240
you get the cool from there.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.240
In the same way if you are emitting bliss,

34:39.400 --> 34:40.720
you give bliss to others.

34:40.880 --> 34:43.360
But there is no bliss within yourself,

34:43.520 --> 34:46.311
but what bliss you can give to others?

34:46.471 --> 34:49.695
So a Sahaja yogi has to be a blissful like the Goddess.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.895
You see She has very extreme characters,

34:52.061 --> 34:56.496
as you must have known that She’s extremely cruel,

34:56.656 --> 34:58.400
She can be very cruel,

34:58.560 --> 35:02.695
and She can be extremely gentle

35:02.855 --> 35:06.682
– like two ragas of yesterday.

35:08.040 --> 35:21.397
She could be extremely harsh, extremely harsh,

35:21.557 --> 35:25.328
beyond all human expectations,

35:25.488 --> 35:31.888
and She could be extremely mild.

35:34.840 --> 35:41.920
So this harsh part you need not have.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.160
It will just work.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.880
This part is only kept for the Divine.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.718
You just take to the other side.

35:50.878 --> 35:54.480
Let this harsh part be looked after by the Divine.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.560
After all, Divine also must do some work.

35:56.720 --> 36:03.920
If you do all the work then what will Divine do?

36:04.496 --> 36:07.854
So the Divine will look after that part.

36:08.014 --> 36:13.190
So you have to enjoy yourself as the Goddess enjoys Herself;

36:13.350 --> 36:15.925
enjoys Her bliss, enjoys Her peace,

36:16.085 --> 36:20.263
enjoys Her everything: Her creation, Her children,

36:20.423 --> 36:23.104
their love – everything She enjoys.

36:23.264 --> 36:26.541
In the same way you have to enjoy.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.360
You have to know about everything,

36:30.520 --> 36:34.426
you have to be absolutely knowledgeable.

36:37.300 --> 36:42.180
And nothing more is needed but just to say that

36:42.340 --> 36:46.060
“Oh Divine, please protect us.”

36:46.220 --> 36:48.668
At the most!

36:48.828 --> 36:52.540
Even if you don’t say it’s all right, you are looked after.

36:52.700 --> 36:54.820
The Divine is working out the stage, you see.

36:54.980 --> 36:59.492
You don’t see it, all there, invisible.

36:59.652 --> 37:01.180
And you are on the stage,

37:01.340 --> 37:03.500
so they are looking out what to focus light,

37:03.660 --> 37:06.260
where to put, what light to put, what is to be done,

37:06.420 --> 37:07.660
what is to be changed around.

37:07.820 --> 37:12.605
Everything they are arranging. You are nicely here.

37:12.765 --> 37:15.045
So you need not do all that work.

37:15.205 --> 37:20.364
You do your work of acting and saying dialogues.

37:20.524 --> 37:25.141
That’s your work. Let them do their jobs, they are doing very well.

37:25.301 --> 37:32.341
They are excellently placed and they are experts.

37:33.213 --> 37:36.547
So to leave certain things into the hands

37:36.707 --> 37:41.889
of the Divine is what we call as 'surrender'.

37:42.540 --> 37:47.484
And that much of this, if done, then

37:47.812 --> 37:51.650
most of your things will work out so miraculously.

37:51.810 --> 37:56.500
I mean, you’ll be amazed, “How, Mother, how it is worked out?

37:56.660 --> 38:01.956
We never expected how things we got it done?”

38:02.116 --> 38:04.476
There’s a very, very big force working:

38:04.636 --> 38:08.100
the Force, the Energy

38:08.260 --> 38:11.317
which is the Source of all the energies,

38:11.477 --> 38:14.414
which has created this great universe,

38:14.574 --> 38:17.854
which has created this Mother Earth, created this sun,

38:18.094 --> 38:21.910
which has created you very delicately.

38:22.070 --> 38:24.710
This Force is working.

38:25.510 --> 38:27.270
And that Force is looking after you,

38:27.430 --> 38:32.949
so proud of you that you have come on the stage now.

38:36.724 --> 38:41.541
So as it is we are today praying to the Goddess that

38:41.701 --> 38:46.041
“Help us to fight our negativity within us.

38:46.285 --> 38:48.430
Give us Your tiger so that we fight,

38:48.590 --> 38:52.190
give us Your lion so we fight.”

38:52.350 --> 38:56.580
Let us fight all these horrible animals that are within us,

38:56.740 --> 39:00.564
these horrible haunting things that are within us,

39:00.724 --> 39:03.093
these horrible conditionings we have.

39:03.253 --> 39:06.316
You have to get rid of it.

39:06.476 --> 39:10.653
Still, still if you watch yourself, lots of conditionings are there,

39:10.813 --> 39:14.230
lots of things, you see. If you see,

39:14.390 --> 39:19.476
there are covered with very thin curtains and you don’t see it,

39:19.670 --> 39:22.284
but they are there.

39:22.444 --> 39:27.196
But let the tiger enter into all these dens and find out.

39:27.356 --> 39:29.987
And you enjoy that, riding over the horse,

39:30.147 --> 39:36.267
riding over the lion, and riding over the tiger

39:36.885 --> 39:39.933
– like a Goddess. Why not?

39:40.093 --> 39:45.550
After all, children get all the heritage of the mother, don’t they?

39:45.724 --> 39:48.910
So you have all the heritage available to you.

39:49.070 --> 39:52.949
But you have to be worthy,

39:53.109 --> 39:57.667
in the sense that you have to know that you are worthy, that’s all.

39:57.827 --> 40:01.280
You have to just know that you are worthy

40:01.440 --> 40:03.920
and that you can do it.

40:04.888 --> 40:10.282
So again today we are here to do this puja,

40:10.920 --> 40:15.953
which would have been in Perth but somehow or other it was not so,

40:16.113 --> 40:20.505
and is luck for you to have this puja.

40:20.665 --> 40:26.216
And it is something of a very deeper nature,

40:26.376 --> 40:30.399
very subtler nature.

40:31.933 --> 40:35.720
Like your blood it is, because on these seven days they say

40:35.880 --> 40:39.163
the Goddess has to wear the red all the time

40:39.323 --> 40:41.600
because it’s blood.

40:41.760 --> 40:46.759
And the first color you see in the womb of your mother is red.

40:46.919 --> 40:51.873
It’s the security. One side is the red rag,

40:52.033 --> 40:54.968
another side it is the security.

40:55.128 --> 40:59.488
So for you it is the security around you.

40:59.648 --> 41:05.523
Every place you go, it is there – just feel it.

41:05.920 --> 41:10.836
You have entered I must say, entered the Kingdom of God,

41:10.996 --> 41:14.272
no doubt about it. You all have entered,

41:14.432 --> 41:16.901
so beautifully you are settled down.

41:17.080 --> 41:20.774
May God bless you.
