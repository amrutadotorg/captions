00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:06.844
It was very spontaneously decided

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:16.804
that we should have the Devi Puja in England.

00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:26.078
And this is the place where really Devi Puja should be,

00:00:26.238 --> 00:00:29.717
because it’s the place of Sadashiva

00:00:29.877 --> 00:00:33.717
and where Adi Shakti should be worshipped.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.509
We have to today understand

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:55.325
that why do we do Devi Puja?

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.390
What is the reason for this Devi Puja?

00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:06.940
What do we get out of it?

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.735
What are we supposed to achieve in our contents

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:16.049
within ourselves?

00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:25.927
The first thing is that Kundalini is the Devi.

00:01:26.637 --> 00:01:30.157
She’s the reflection of the Adi Shakti.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.817
So when you worship Devi,

00:01:34.977 --> 00:01:39.219
first you worship also your own Kundalini

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:46.384
by giving Her credit because She has given you this realization.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.918
It’s much deeper understanding

00:01:50.078 --> 00:01:53.847
than normally people have about the Devi Puja

00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:57.428
because they are not realized souls.

00:01:57.588 --> 00:02:00.079
Their Kundalini not is awakened.

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.590
So normally when they do Devi Puja it’s for the purpose

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.566
of getting realization

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:08.205
so that the Devi should be pleased

00:02:08.365 --> 00:02:11.927
– prasanna – and should give them realization,

00:02:12.087 --> 00:02:15.337
or must get our chance to get to somebody

00:02:15.497 --> 00:02:19.045
who will give them realization.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.534
But you are at a different level now.

00:02:23.694 --> 00:02:28.124
So it’s more of a thanksgiving to your own Kundalini

00:02:28.284 --> 00:02:30.550
and to Adi Shakti,

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.379
glorifying that whatever has happened so miraculously

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:41.062
is because of the Kundalini which was within you,

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:47.214
which was reflected by the Adi Shakti.

00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:53.426
But one has to know that

00:02:53.802 --> 00:03:02.061
only we are realized souls is not the point,

00:03:02.221 --> 00:03:07.101
only that we can feel the vibrations is not the point,

00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:14.022
that we can give realizations to other is also not the point.

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:20.830
Then what is it? Very important –

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.791
it’s the content within us.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.734
What do we have within us is the point.

00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:33.487
These are all the expressions of what we have within.

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:37.469
Supposing somebody is generous,

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.950
then know that he’s a rich man, otherwise he cannot be.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.390
So the content within us, we have to see.

00:03:49.364 --> 00:03:53.714
And when we start seeing the content,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.096
where do we find in the nature there is real content?

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:10.321
We see the sea; sea is there you see, full of water.

00:04:12.182 --> 00:04:16.384
So much of water it sucks in from everywhere,

00:04:16.544 --> 00:04:22.119
and then it allows itself to be boiled by the sun

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:25.463
and gives rain.

00:04:29.214 --> 00:04:33.671
But sea is the lowest level,

00:04:34.188 --> 00:04:35.872
stands at the lowest level

00:04:36.032 --> 00:04:40.373
and sucks in all the water from everywhere.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.607
In the same way a Sahaja yogi must know that

00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:53.119
to be really achieving more content,

00:04:53.279 --> 00:05:03.039
we have to be not at a higher level outside.

00:05:05.215 --> 00:05:07.871
It’s said in the Bible, “You have to be meek,”

00:05:08.031 --> 00:05:11.022
but I think it was not explained to people.

00:05:11.182 --> 00:05:16.296
Only the strong people can be meek,

00:05:16.456 --> 00:05:19.543
secured people can be meek,

00:05:19.703 --> 00:05:25.254
only the rich in essence can be meek,

00:05:25.414 --> 00:05:31.881
not the people who are insecured.

00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:36.621
Because they are insecured, how can they be meek?

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.438
And not the people whom we think are rich, so-called,

00:05:44.598 --> 00:05:48.584
because if they are rich they are not generous,

00:05:48.744 --> 00:05:53.335
they are not satisfied, they are not philanthropic,

00:05:53.495 --> 00:05:58.677
so they are not rich. They are still greedy beggars.

00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:07.159
So the content within us is to be seen. What is our content?

00:06:10.246 --> 00:06:15.275
You love Me, I love you – it’s very good.

00:06:17.941 --> 00:06:23.141
But when you love Me,

00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:28.198
you have to know that there are certain qualities

00:06:28.358 --> 00:06:32.398
which are very lovable in a Sahaja yogi.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.726
Actually people get lost even after Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:38.886 --> 00:06:41.726
They think they can get over everything,

00:06:41.886 --> 00:06:44.206
they’re perfectly all right,

00:06:44.366 --> 00:06:48.322
and they are thrown overboard.

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:55.085
So when we say that we have to be meek,

00:06:55.245 --> 00:07:00.608
this is a content, the humility is a content.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.860
So try to that, try to be humble with someone.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.260
You’ll like yourself.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.564
You’ll enjoy that quality within this that,

00:07:15.724 --> 00:07:19.971
“You see, I’m humbler than another person.”

00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:25.350
And what is another thing we find has content

00:07:25.604 --> 00:07:29.053
are the great mountains,

00:07:29.213 --> 00:07:32.500
because they have heights

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.892
and they are the only ones who can capture the clouds.

00:07:39.052 --> 00:07:41.380
So such a rapport there is

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.965
between the humility of the ocean

00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:51.349
and the heights of the mountain.

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:54.661
That’s how a Sahaja yogi should be.

00:07:54.821 --> 00:08:02.541
He is too high because so much of

00:08:07.474 --> 00:08:10.980
content is there in that ocean,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.340
then it has become beautiful

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:22.700
like clouds and touched his height, his Kailasha

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.915
where resides the Shiva.

00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:30.435
So it’s so joy-giving.

00:08:31.883 --> 00:08:35.060
Of course as you have painted Me there,

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.340
it’s true that was My situation once upon a time.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.900
Today also it is My situation no doubt,

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.860
in a very subtle manner,

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.100
because there’s so much of negativity

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:54.460
and I have to work it out on all kinds of levels.

00:09:00.883 --> 00:09:04.940
There is no excuse for some human being to be a devil,

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.474
no excuse, and for a Sahaja yogi there is no excuse at all.

00:09:09.634 --> 00:09:13.475
But still once I have called you My son, My child,

00:09:13.635 --> 00:09:16.836
there is a little blessing;

00:09:16.996 --> 00:09:21.964
goes, I would say, a long rope.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:29.380
But that long rope one should not care for.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.060
You have to care for your own quality,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.780
for your own inner capacity to suck in.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.388
Now look at the ocean as it is.

00:09:43.548 --> 00:09:50.211
All that is around falls into the ocean, everything.

00:09:50.796 --> 00:09:57.005
And then the sun – we can say that’s the Spirit – evaporates.

00:09:57.165 --> 00:10:00.548
Only possible in the ocean.

00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:03.940
It doesn’t evaporate the rivers so much as it can

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.685
because it’s such a wide thing, such a deep thing,

00:10:06.845 --> 00:10:10.000
inexhaustible.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:17.080
And then absolutely pure material comes out of that,

00:10:17.703 --> 00:10:22.078
and that can go and touch the heart.

00:10:22.238 --> 00:10:26.121
Because as a Sahaja Yogi those hearts are at a very high level

00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:32.059
where there is Shiva residing.

00:10:32.703 --> 00:10:37.823
Nobody can reach there except for the purity,

00:10:38.207 --> 00:10:42.807
and unless and until you have that largeness,

00:10:42.999 --> 00:10:49.538
that depth, that humility, and the maryadas.

00:10:49.698 --> 00:10:54.440
You know that sea never leaves its own maryadas,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.720
and if you press it from one end it will express on one other side –

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.640
it never leaves.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.560
If Pacific Ocean was

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.048
even hundred feet deeper there would have been a problem.

00:11:09.208 --> 00:11:15.160
So even in depth, in its height, in its spreading

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.208
it has its own maryadas.

00:11:17.368 --> 00:11:22.320
But in that maryada he has the feeling

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.088
that he is one with the nature, one with Mother.

00:11:26.248 --> 00:11:29.897
He is not disturbing the Mother Earth,

00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:35.124
nicely placed in the body of Mother Earth.

00:11:36.823 --> 00:11:40.680
Nature is bound by the Divine.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.840
The Divine looks after the nature.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.526
So everything works out beautifully and you have freedom.

00:11:47.686 --> 00:11:52.186
And after Sahaja Yoga you have greater freedom,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.136
absolute freedom, because you cannot be bound

00:11:57.296 --> 00:12:04.520
by anything nonsensical, anything sinful, anything base.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:10.176
You are above that like a mountain.

00:12:11.245 --> 00:12:15.537
And so wherever there is a combination

00:12:15.697 --> 00:12:20.898
of a mountain and an ocean, the ships can come.

00:12:21.934 --> 00:12:25.352
Deep people can only come to such shores

00:12:25.512 --> 00:12:28.207
where there is depth.

00:12:28.367 --> 00:12:31.600
That’s how you achieve your depth,

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.960
between your Heart and your Bhavasagara,

00:12:38.248 --> 00:12:41.633
that beautiful area where people can come to you

00:12:41.793 --> 00:12:46.425
and just they know this is something great,

00:12:49.974 --> 00:12:53.440
everybody knows that.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.720
You have seen that I am like any other woman to look at.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.574
I don’t know, you might think I am different, but normally…

00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:07.200
But how many people come to My program?

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.345
How do they come to My program? Must think.

00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:15.418
In Colombia when nobody had even heard My name,

00:13:22.943 --> 00:13:26.560
thousands came – I mean, very surprising.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.148
And people had no place to sit.

00:13:30.308 --> 00:13:33.751
In Russia where, I mean, no question of My, their knowing My name,

00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:38.020
there are no books published, nothing.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.080
So you can say that, “Mother,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.942
You manipulate it through the collective unconscious.”

00:13:49.102 --> 00:13:53.542
I do not, but it does – I think so.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:02.345
So when the Sahaja yogis have that content within themselves,

00:14:02.534 --> 00:14:06.208
the collective unconscious,

00:14:06.368 --> 00:14:11.968
the Divine will act, definitely act.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.440
Like a person who is spreading advertisements,

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.880
this that, yes people come.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.200
Because he takes money they think they can purchase this man.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.040
But where there is no money involved,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.728
no business involved, nothing,

00:14:29.888 --> 00:14:36.465
you people are just simple people just like them, so?

00:14:37.407 --> 00:14:42.167
But it’s all done by the Divine, isn’t it?

00:14:43.727 --> 00:14:47.520
So the Divine works it out.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:54.095
But if the Sahaja yogis in a place are good for nothing,

00:14:54.255 --> 00:14:59.447
then even if I am there it does not work.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:03.967
Half-hearted people if they are it does not work.

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:07.665
In no way to discourage you but to tell you

00:15:07.825 --> 00:15:11.471
that you have to develop your content within yourself,

00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:15.408
a complete faith in yourself.

00:15:15.568 --> 00:15:20.808
This is the greatest property of a Sahaja yogi.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.744
And what is this ocean?

00:15:24.904 --> 00:15:29.264
It’s love, it’s love and love.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.843
It doesn’t talk, it doesn’t do much, nothing is to be done in this.

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:38.800
It just works spontaneously.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.440
The less you do the better.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.366
The more you try to do, “I will do this, manipulate there”, no,

00:15:47.526 --> 00:15:51.950
you just develop your content within yourself.

00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:58.504
And imagine, you are all so lucky,

00:15:58.664 --> 00:16:01.591
you have so many provisions which nobody had.

00:16:01.751 --> 00:16:05.192
They had to go into jungles, they had to

00:16:05.352 --> 00:16:09.207
take all the wrath of their gurus

00:16:09.367 --> 00:16:13.963
and nobody to protect them.

00:16:15.037 --> 00:16:19.834
And they never had Adi Shakti to worship.

00:16:22.016 --> 00:16:24.360
So you have Adi Shakti with you,

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:29.280
whose power is all this Divine.

00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:33.880
So you are at such an advantageous position.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.865
But first you must realize.

00:16:37.025 --> 00:16:40.920
So when we say we should have content,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.280
then the vessel has to be strong

00:16:46.031 --> 00:16:50.520
otherwise everything will break.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.214
And this strength is the one you should know,

00:16:54.374 --> 00:16:58.654
that you are completely protected.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.089
No one can harm you.

00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:02.376
They’ll try.

00:17:02.536 --> 00:17:04.938
This has to be otherwise how will you test

00:17:05.098 --> 00:17:08.320
whether you are absolutely safe or not.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.726
So somebody has to try some tricks

00:17:11.886 --> 00:17:17.826
just to see and for you to watch how you are successful.

00:17:17.986 --> 00:17:20.200
Without doing anything you’ll be amazed,

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.386
everything will be cleared out.

00:17:22.546 --> 00:17:24.984
And you’ll not know how things have cleared out,

00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:28.864
how things have worked out.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.640
So the strength comes.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.180
Again the question is how the strength comes into a Sahaja yogi.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.985
There I would say it’s the shraddha.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:44.688
Shraddha is not blind faith.

00:17:44.848 --> 00:17:48.400
After Sahaja Yoga, after realization

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.800
you know everything.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.446
You’ve seen My photographs,

00:17:56.606 --> 00:17:58.960
you have seen how Sahaja Yoga works,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.950
you’ve seen how you can raise the Kundalini of people,

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:06.073
you can feel the vibrations;

00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:11.271
you can feel others', you can cure others.

00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:13.960
All this power is within you.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.960
But just to realize

00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:23.560
that power without ego is your strength.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.960
And when you are powerful you don’t have the ego

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.296
because what is the need there?

00:18:28.456 --> 00:18:32.120
Ego is there only when you don’t have power

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.864
because you want to have more, more, more.

00:18:36.024 --> 00:18:41.596
But when you are fully there, there’s no ego.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.952
So this power is to be ascertained first,

00:18:47.112 --> 00:18:51.280
to find out whether you are powerful or not,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.608
to find out first.

00:18:53.768 --> 00:18:56.935
And then, like if I’ve to sit on the chair I’ll see,

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:58.872
“Is it all right or it’s shaking?"

00:18:59.032 --> 00:19:02.312
"Oh it’s all right, I can sit on this.”

00:19:07.899 --> 00:19:12.280
Some Sahaja yogis still remain on the periphery.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:18.000
There’s sometimes a very big gap between some

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.000
who have reached great heights and some

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.760
who are outside.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.840
All these are negative forces

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.240
which were killed long time back.

00:19:33.728 --> 00:19:38.248
Only one Shakti was sufficient to kill them,

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:44.258
of Kali Shakti, Durga Shakti,

00:19:44.495 --> 00:19:48.615
but you have so many of them.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.847
You have Mahalakshmi Shakti,

00:19:53.007 --> 00:19:55.354
you’ve got Saraswati Shakti,

00:19:55.514 --> 00:20:00.194
you have all the twelve deities are there working for you.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:12.113
So “realizing it” is the meaning that

00:20:12.273 --> 00:20:17.246
you must have complete faith in yourself.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.988
If you still doubt yourself,

00:20:23.727 --> 00:20:26.440
that’s also a human quality.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.033
I mean a dog knows that he’s a dog.

00:20:29.193 --> 00:20:34.048
He doesn’t doubt that he’s a dog, or a cat, does he?

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.800
Or a tiger knows he’s a tiger,

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.240
and he knows what capacities he’s got.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.726
It’s only the human beings have got apart from other

00:20:43.886 --> 00:20:49.446
stupid qualities is one, this, that they can doubt themselves.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:02.320
And this doubting quality has made them cowards.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:08.120
In Sahaja Yoga you should have no doubts about yourself,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.945
“Because I’m doing, still doing like this, Mother,

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.903
I am still doing like this, then how?”

00:21:15.063 --> 00:21:18.040
Then get rid of it!

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.960
I mean, how can I solve your problem

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.440
if you want to carry monkey on your back?

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.560
And I’m still carrying the monkey on your back.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.960
You get rid of the monkey, finished.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.160
It’s so simple. I mean to My simple logic,

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.431
this is what is the answer.

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:35.378
Why do you want to carry the monkey and then come and tell Me,

00:21:35.538 --> 00:21:42.230
“Mother, I am carrying the monkey”? I can see it!

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:49.536
Get it off your head! Get it off your back!

00:21:49.696 --> 00:21:53.970
It’s very simple, you are a Sahaja yogi.

00:21:56.614 --> 00:21:59.477
And this is what I’ve found about Russians.

00:21:59.637 --> 00:22:02.440
They didn’t have any monkeys really, very surprising.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.344
I think there are no monkeys at all there.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.292
None of them!

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.000
No private problems, no public problems, no any other problem,

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.567
nothing, nothing, they discuss nothing.

00:22:19.727 --> 00:22:22.157
This is the, they could have said that

00:22:22.317 --> 00:22:26.368
“Our government is such, it’s…”, nothing, nothing, nothing.

00:22:26.528 --> 00:22:29.160
They had enough of everything, they must have.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.053
Very well-read people, very well-educated,

00:22:32.213 --> 00:22:35.622
very big professions, very humble,

00:22:35.782 --> 00:22:41.293
very open-hearted; they just wanted realization, that’s all.

00:22:41.453 --> 00:22:43.960
They said, “You have come here for our liberation.”

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.448
They would even touch My sari like that.

00:22:46.608 --> 00:22:50.254
The place I walk they would touch, just imagine.

00:22:50.414 --> 00:22:55.730
Who has told them about vibrations? I never said I am Adi Shakti.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.022
How did they recognize Me?

00:22:59.182 --> 00:23:04.734
They developed that strength within themselves, that shraddha.

00:23:04.894 --> 00:23:07.455
And they never talked about God in that country.

00:23:07.615 --> 00:23:09.735
They have some stupid people who have

00:23:09.895 --> 00:23:15.565
churches and things like that and Islamic institutions, but

00:23:15.725 --> 00:23:19.920
most of the people are so strong

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.120
and the content is showing itself.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.720
Imagine every time they have a program,

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.480
even now on follow-on,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.880
at least one thousand people are there.

00:23:34.135 --> 00:23:39.484
In this England we can’t even get one thousand for Devi Puja.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.998
And they come all the way from thousands of miles,

00:23:43.158 --> 00:23:46.120
from Siberia, this, that.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.647
And they have booked themselves,

00:23:47.807 --> 00:23:50.560
because there the halls you have to pay for.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.840
So though the Sahaja yogis don’t take money, but they pay for halls.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.030
But the mediocrity to be on the periphery,

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:03.096
not to work it out, take it easy,

00:24:04.426 --> 00:24:07.880
not the way for Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.800
We don’t have to kill demons.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:17.240
There’s no need to join any war

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:23.800
or to fight like soldiers as they fought with Devi, nothing.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.920
You have just to take out the negativity within yourself,

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.805
lethargy from you, but work it out.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.845
We say mantras, we know what are the powers of the mantras are,

00:24:39.005 --> 00:24:42.320
but you have to keep them awakened.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.920
For that I have told you a hundred times, you must meditate.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.240
Not the way to meditate,

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.800
"All right, it’s like playing golf, sort of."

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.080
It’s not that way. It’s a serious thing,

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:01.008
you are worshipping the Adi Shakti.

00:25:01.168 --> 00:25:07.712
With that complete understanding and dedication

00:25:08.103 --> 00:25:13.680
you have to do it; not a mechanical thing, it’s not a game.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.044
It’s something very subtle and special.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:23.216
In no action we can describe it,

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:31.160
but it’s just a very deep feeling.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.800
To that depth no other feeling goes;

00:25:34.975 --> 00:25:38.521
with that feeling you have to meditate.

00:25:38.681 --> 00:25:40.629
And then see the results.

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:43.360
Many people say, “I’ve done this, Mother, I’ve done that.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.680
I’ve this still” –

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:51.520
because you are not deep enough.

00:25:53.113 --> 00:25:58.000
It’s not how much you pray,

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.440
it’s not how many words you use for prayer,

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.774
but it is how deeply you have touched

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:17.240
the feet of the Divine that is important.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.275
So today we have to see that

00:26:23.435 --> 00:26:30.387
Devi is using Her sword to pierce through our heart

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.120
so that all negativity runs away,

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:41.193
and through that She wants to plant the lotus

00:26:41.353 --> 00:26:44.393
for Shiva to settle down.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:50.480
She wants to take away all that ugliness from within.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.840
It’s like an operation

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.360
but so delicate and so beautifully done,

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.640
you never even felt it.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.760
The other day somebody gave Me a book of on the Devi's

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.160
and the vibrations are called as 'spanda' – means 'pulsation'

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.480
– it’s correct, no doubt,

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.520
and it’s called as 'anahata' in Sanskrit language,

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.160
meaning 'without percussions'.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.080
But I was reading that book, I said,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.040
“It’s like going round and round, up and down,

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.360
going into ‘this means, that means'."

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.480
How can anybody understand this book, it’s so terrible!

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.000
While I have said all these things and much more than this,

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.200
and they know it so easily.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.880
If you read that book, two pages, you’ll get a headache, I tell you.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.360
But how the whole knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:47.160
has come to you so beautifully,

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.920
it’s very remarkable, I tell you.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:01.560
If you read the mantras they’ll give you explanations

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.903
which has nothing to do with reality sometimes, I feel.

00:28:05.063 --> 00:28:12.023
But even if it has, it’s so circuitous, so complicated.

00:28:15.588 --> 00:28:18.641
I would say Adi Shankaracharya realized it and that’s why

00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:21.565
He gave up the idea of writing any treatises and,

00:28:21.725 --> 00:28:24.120
“Let’s make it simple, the praise of the Mother." Finished.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.480
"If you praise the Mother, everything okay.”

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.518
But that’s not. I find that’s not so, it’s easy.

00:28:29.678 --> 00:28:31.760
You see, human beings are great experts,

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.520
they can be just like radios praising, praising.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.938
Nothing goes inside the heart.

00:28:41.485 --> 00:28:45.205
But you have to develop that depth.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.440
In Sahaja Yoga we work through our heart,

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.160
not through our brains.

00:28:50.392 --> 00:28:53.972
You have to develop that heart

00:28:56.342 --> 00:29:04.288
and to receive into it the greatness of other people.

00:29:06.856 --> 00:29:11.999
Now people can see what’s wrong with others very easily.

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:15.033
They don’t want to see what’s wrong with them.

00:29:15.193 --> 00:29:16.857
Any intelligent man can see that,

00:29:17.017 --> 00:29:19.285
there’s no need to have his realization.

00:29:19.445 --> 00:29:22.320
But a wise person sees what’s wrong with him

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.640
and he trusts. He trusts

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.521
himself then because he’s wise.

00:29:31.776 --> 00:29:35.575
He doesn’t doubt, he knows he’s wise.

00:29:35.735 --> 00:29:39.408
He knows what’s wrong with him and what is to be done.

00:29:39.568 --> 00:29:45.512
So the work of the Goddess is very different today,

00:29:45.672 --> 00:29:47.639
as you can see it clearly.

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:52.279
Of course, symbolically it is the same

00:29:52.607 --> 00:29:56.534
but it has become very subtle, very subtle.

00:29:56.694 --> 00:30:01.534
The first work is to destroy the negativity

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.983
which is going on as you know.

00:30:04.143 --> 00:30:07.279
The more light comes in, the ignorance will disappear.

00:30:07.439 --> 00:30:11.085
This light will spread, all the darkness will go away.

00:30:11.245 --> 00:30:14.925
But you are the lights.

00:30:16.191 --> 00:30:19.400
You have to put the lights on

00:30:19.752 --> 00:30:22.048
and you have to look after your light,

00:30:22.208 --> 00:30:27.888
and you have to make that light eternal.

00:30:30.078 --> 00:30:35.718
This is one work which you are doing.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.160
It’s a beautiful work of the Goddess you are doing

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.760
is to spread light, enlighten people.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.560
The negativity that is around you

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.520
is not so dangerous as whatever is in you.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.453
Today it has become subtler.

00:30:57.613 --> 00:31:00.280
The negativity has become subtler.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.688
It’s entered into your being,

00:31:02.848 --> 00:31:07.807
and be careful – it may anytime topple you.

00:31:11.126 --> 00:31:13.926
Even one step

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.825
you do not put right when you are climbing up,

00:31:16.985 --> 00:31:19.505
you can go down.

00:31:19.854 --> 00:31:23.665
So one has to be alert, without tension.

00:31:23.825 --> 00:31:27.150
You have to be alert without tension.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.880
And the alertness grows.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.432
When the light goes within you start seeing it.

00:31:35.592 --> 00:31:37.967
Immediately you see, “Oh, that’s it!

00:31:38.127 --> 00:31:42.293
So I, the so and so – that’s it!”

00:31:42.453 --> 00:31:47.079
And you know how to correct it and you know how to put it right.

00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:48.880
And immediately you take to it.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.720
Like a good sari now has something fallen on it,

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.120
immediately you clean it.

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:07.745
In the same way we have to be very, very alert;

00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:10.695
'daksha' is the word for that.

00:32:10.855 --> 00:32:14.801
Now this was the work of the Goddess before.

00:32:14.961 --> 00:32:17.280
Goddess used to give enlightenment

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.049
and Goddess used to be alert for you.

00:32:20.209 --> 00:32:24.249
She would sit like a tigress for Her children.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.600
They are praying, they are doing puja,

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.409
they are doing some sort of a homa, havana,

00:32:31.569 --> 00:32:34.397
so the Goddess would sit down, protect them

00:32:34.557 --> 00:32:36.816
from all negativity coming,

00:32:36.976 --> 00:32:40.109
all rakshasas coming, kill them, this, do that.

00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:46.372
But that stage is gone now. Now She’s entered into you.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.366
So you have to kill your negativity,

00:32:50.526 --> 00:32:55.308
you’ve become as powerful as your Mother.

00:32:56.368 --> 00:33:00.648
No negativity can touch you.

00:33:01.489 --> 00:33:06.207
So you can give realization, you’ve got that power very well;

00:33:06.367 --> 00:33:12.727
and you can watch your defects more than that of others.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.400
And you try to put them out because they’re not good,

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:21.760
they’re not for your benevolence, they’re not for your ascent.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.263
By that nobody is going to gain.

00:33:26.085 --> 00:33:30.313
At the collective level it just works automatically.

00:33:30.473 --> 00:33:32.084
You don’t have to worry.

00:33:32.244 --> 00:33:36.480
It comes to culmination and a person goes out;

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.640
as if somebody runs up like a blind fellow

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.520
on a cliff and jumps, jumps down.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.040
You don’t have to worry too much about this.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.940
It just works. You have seen it has worked that way.

00:33:54.513 --> 00:33:57.841
Now another quality that you have:

00:33:58.001 --> 00:34:00.400
to believe that Goddess is working through you.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:04.480
In you She resides, you have got the powers,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.160
it’s penetrated into you

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:14.720
is that you can comfort people, you can cure them,

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:22.202
you can give them peace, you can give them bliss.

00:34:22.527 --> 00:34:25.680
But then what Goddess has done in you is that

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.208
She has given you the bliss, you have become bliss.

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:34.680
Like there’s say a cool air-conditioner,

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.240
you get the cool from there.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.240
In the same way if you are emitting bliss,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.720
you give bliss to others.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.360
But there is no bliss within yourself,

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.311
but what bliss you can give to others?

00:34:46.471 --> 00:34:49.695
So a Sahaja yogi has to be a blissful like the Goddess.

00:34:49.855 --> 00:34:51.895
You see She has very extreme characters,

00:34:52.061 --> 00:34:56.496
as you must have known that She’s extremely cruel,

00:34:56.656 --> 00:34:58.400
She can be very cruel,

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.695
and She can be extremely gentle

00:35:02.855 --> 00:35:06.682
– like two ragas of yesterday.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:21.397
She could be extremely harsh, extremely harsh,

00:35:21.557 --> 00:35:25.328
beyond all human expectations,

00:35:25.488 --> 00:35:31.888
and She could be extremely mild.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:41.920
So this harsh part you need not have.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.160
It will just work.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.880
This part is only kept for the Divine.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.718
You just take to the other side.

00:35:50.878 --> 00:35:54.480
Let this harsh part be looked after by the Divine.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.560
After all, Divine also must do some work.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:03.920
If you do all the work then what will Divine do?

00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:07.854
So the Divine will look after that part.

00:36:08.014 --> 00:36:13.190
So you have to enjoy yourself as the Goddess enjoys Herself;

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.925
enjoys Her bliss, enjoys Her peace,

00:36:16.085 --> 00:36:20.263
enjoys Her everything: Her creation, Her children,

00:36:20.423 --> 00:36:23.104
their love – everything She enjoys.

00:36:23.264 --> 00:36:26.541
In the same way you have to enjoy.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.360
You have to know about everything,

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.426
you have to be absolutely knowledgeable.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:42.180
And nothing more is needed but just to say that

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:46.060
“Oh Divine, please protect us.”

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:48.668
At the most!

00:36:48.828 --> 00:36:52.540
Even if you don’t say it’s all right, you are looked after.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.820
The Divine is working out the stage, you see.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:59.492
You don’t see it, all there, invisible.

00:36:59.652 --> 00:37:01.180
And you are on the stage,

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.500
so they are looking out what to focus light,

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.260
where to put, what light to put, what is to be done,

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.660
what is to be changed around.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:12.605
Everything they are arranging. You are nicely here.

00:37:12.765 --> 00:37:15.045
So you need not do all that work.

00:37:15.205 --> 00:37:20.364
You do your work of acting and saying dialogues.

00:37:20.524 --> 00:37:25.141
That’s your work. Let them do their jobs, they are doing very well.

00:37:25.301 --> 00:37:32.341
They are excellently placed and they are experts.

00:37:33.213 --> 00:37:36.547
So to leave certain things into the hands

00:37:36.707 --> 00:37:41.889
of the Divine is what we call as 'surrender'.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:47.484
And that much of this, if done, then

00:37:47.812 --> 00:37:51.650
most of your things will work out so miraculously.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:56.500
I mean, you’ll be amazed, “How, Mother, how it is worked out?

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:01.956
We never expected how things we got it done?”

00:38:02.116 --> 00:38:04.476
There’s a very, very big force working:

00:38:04.636 --> 00:38:08.100
the Force, the Energy

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:11.317
which is the Source of all the energies,

00:38:11.477 --> 00:38:14.414
which has created this great universe,

00:38:14.574 --> 00:38:17.854
which has created this Mother Earth, created this sun,

00:38:18.094 --> 00:38:21.910
which has created you very delicately.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.710
This Force is working.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.270
And that Force is looking after you,

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:32.949
so proud of you that you have come on the stage now.

00:38:36.724 --> 00:38:41.541
So as it is we are today praying to the Goddess that

00:38:41.701 --> 00:38:46.041
“Help us to fight our negativity within us.

00:38:46.285 --> 00:38:48.430
Give us Your tiger so that we fight,

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:52.190
give us Your lion so we fight.”

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:56.580
Let us fight all these horrible animals that are within us,

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.564
these horrible haunting things that are within us,

00:39:00.724 --> 00:39:03.093
these horrible conditionings we have.

00:39:03.253 --> 00:39:06.316
You have to get rid of it.

00:39:06.476 --> 00:39:10.653
Still, still if you watch yourself, lots of conditionings are there,

00:39:10.813 --> 00:39:14.230
lots of things, you see. If you see,

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:19.476
there are covered with very thin curtains and you don’t see it,

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:22.284
but they are there.

00:39:22.444 --> 00:39:27.196
But let the tiger enter into all these dens and find out.

00:39:27.356 --> 00:39:29.987
And you enjoy that, riding over the horse,

00:39:30.147 --> 00:39:36.267
riding over the lion, and riding over the tiger

00:39:36.885 --> 00:39:39.933
– like a Goddess. Why not?

00:39:40.093 --> 00:39:45.550
After all, children get all the heritage of the mother, don’t they?

00:39:45.724 --> 00:39:48.910
So you have all the heritage available to you.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:52.949
But you have to be worthy,

00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:57.667
in the sense that you have to know that you are worthy, that’s all.

00:39:57.827 --> 00:40:01.280
You have to just know that you are worthy

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.920
and that you can do it.

00:40:04.888 --> 00:40:10.282
So again today we are here to do this puja,

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.953
which would have been in Perth but somehow or other it was not so,

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:20.505
and is luck for you to have this puja.

00:40:20.665 --> 00:40:26.216
And it is something of a very deeper nature,

00:40:26.376 --> 00:40:30.399
very subtler nature.

00:40:31.933 --> 00:40:35.720
Like your blood it is, because on these seven days they say

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.163
the Goddess has to wear the red all the time

00:40:39.323 --> 00:40:41.600
because it’s blood.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:46.759
And the first color you see in the womb of your mother is red.

00:40:46.919 --> 00:40:51.873
It’s the security. One side is the red rag,

00:40:52.033 --> 00:40:54.968
another side it is the security.

00:40:55.128 --> 00:40:59.488
So for you it is the security around you.

00:40:59.648 --> 00:41:05.523
Every place you go, it is there – just feel it.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.836
You have entered I must say, entered the Kingdom of God,

00:41:10.996 --> 00:41:14.272
no doubt about it. You all have entered,

00:41:14.432 --> 00:41:16.901
so beautifully you are settled down.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.774
May God bless you.
