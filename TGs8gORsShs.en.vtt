00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.830
To see so many Sahaja Yogis assembled here, I’m
sure the devil must have run away long time

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:37.729
back. And the caravan must have left but I
hope we are aware of it and we forget about

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:46.819
our fears of our catches, of our past, of
all the nonsense we have done so far. Suddenly

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:59.840
in My presence, I think, people get into a
sense of guilt. I’m here to soothe you,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:13.940
to cleanse you, to make you beautiful and
not to feel guilty.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:33.599
Actually when we start
looking at ourselves the first thing you notice
is that there’s a block on the Agnya, but

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.230
this block in the Agnya is the worst thing
that can happen to us because it is the door

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.040
of the Kundalini. She reaches up to Vishuddhi
all right, and then She has to move forward,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:58.000
this Agnya stops it. That’s why we have
left Vishuddhi, we have all
the Vishuddhi problems. The flow cannot take

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:11.110
place. Also this is one of the reasons we
feel guilty because of left Vishuddhi. It’s

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.340
a symptom of a disease.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.920
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna.
So we have to understand first of all that

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.880
we’re Sahaja Yogis. We’re not ordinary
people or we’re not people who have not

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.310
known the truth; we have known the truth.
We have to be completely aware of it. That’s

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.940
one truth if you establish, you have established
yourself quite a lot.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:50.370
Now the ordinary people as you have seen on
Oxford St., you see, they wear Indian dresses

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.500
funnily tied, they don’t know how to tie
it up, dhotis and saris and they shake their

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:07.910
heads and buy some of these, what we call
them, shindis or bodhis or I don’t know

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:19.410
what you call, tails, pigtails, and attach
them with some glue and they start dancing.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:32.720
When they dance, their pigtail falls off,
and the saris and the dhotis, everything start

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.539
opening out. That’s a very funny, ridiculous
scene. One side you see the punks and another

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.120
side you see this nonsense, in the name of
Shri Krishna, that’s even worse. Punks do

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.090
not do it in the name of, I don’t know if
they do it in the name of King Solomon. But

00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:00.010
they do it in somebody’s name, these people
that is so great as Shri Krishna. On the contrary,

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:22.880
Shri Krishna’s hair are described in all
the books and in all the poetry that poets

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.130
could sing about. He was never shaven-headed.
It is impossible to understand how these people

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:36.860
got the idea that you must shave your head.
So the Shri Krishna’s aspect of Yogeshwara

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:46.970
has been so misunderstood. It’s absolutely
misunderstood because we cannot understand

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:55.660
that the truth is covered with maya, always.
And you should keep maya on one side and go

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.479
to the truth. Instead of that, we get lost
in the maya, like very simple example, as

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.050
it is, that He is a Yogeshwara; so these people
have idea of a yogi, that He should be shaven,

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.550
He should wear that dhoti, dirty one, and
must put on a pigtail. Another concept, maya

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.610
is a concept. And when you start living on
those concepts of your own, you may gather

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.210
it up with something else, you may think that
Christ was a person who was a sanyasi, who

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.470
used to wear another kind of a robe and He
had a beard and He had hair like this.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:40.270
All those ideas, “So if we become like this,
we’d be very great yogis.” These are all

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:47.430
our concepts about someone whom we have never
seen, whom we have never known. And because

00:06:47.430 --> 00:07:00.080
we live with those concepts, we get limited.
It’s very difficult for these people to

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.300
break through because maya can only be broken
through realization. That’s why first thing

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.910
in Sahaja Yoga is realization. Take your realization.
You are a drunkard, all right, get your realization.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:17.479
You are a drug addict, get your realization.
You are a bad man, get your realization. Anyone,

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:26.060
get your realization first; put the light
first into a person. Let him see for himself.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:36.000
So all this identification with different
concepts is responsible for giving us a very

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:46.139
mayami or illusive personality. We live in
an illusive personality, live with it, enjoy

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:59.830
it and we think we are perfectly all right.
Now if you are aware you are Sahaja Yogis

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:08.720
and you have come here for Shri Krishna Puja,
what is the preparation we have to do. We’re

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.880
Sahaja Yogis, we know about Kundalini, we
know about Vishuddhis, we know about Shri

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:25.580
Krishna. All right, how are we going to prepare
ourselves for the puja of Shri Krishna?

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:38.610
First of all, He tried to break all the concepts.
First the concept He broke was that you have

00:08:38.610 --> 00:09:00.699
to be like a ascetic to look. He broke this
concept; He lived like the king. In His childhood

00:09:00.699 --> 00:09:15.019
He used to go and play with the cows. And
there He would use a peacock’s feather to

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:30.839
decorate Himself, and He would listen to beautiful
music of the river Yamuna and reproduce it.

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:44.749
He was leelala, He was the one who created
all kinds of mirth. What is mirth in French?

00:09:44.749 --> 00:10:00.910
They don’t have mirth, I believe. It’s
not fun, it’s more than… , it’s mirth.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:25.879
Mirth is sweeter than fun, all right, sweet
fun. What a word! Sweet fun! This is mirth,

00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:37.720
now what is happening to you is mirth. I’m
creating mirth in which you feel tickled,

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:43.040
you know. Mirth is something where you feel
tickled.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:55.569
So He tried to create mirth, never seriousness
but He was not frivolous. He was Yogeshwara.

00:10:55.569 --> 00:11:09.619
He was not frivolous, so this difference between
frivolity and mirth is to be understood only

00:11:09.619 --> 00:11:30.809
through Him because He’s also discretion.
Mirth is joy-giving, frivolity is destructive.

00:11:30.809 --> 00:11:52.779
Anything frivolous if you do…
So we have to be in a state of mirth, so no

00:11:52.779 --> 00:12:00.589
question of feeling guilty comes in, you’re
not prisoners are we? We’re prisoners of

00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:11.339
our own concepts and our own ideas and our
own degradation. We degrade ourselves, God

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:23.889
does not. So we should be in the state of
complete mirth and enjoyment. Now it has rained,

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:37.129
all right. That’s a very good thing to happen
today. Yesterday I was listening to the program,

00:12:37.129 --> 00:12:48.779
I was just smiling, because I knew it would
not work out that way.

00:12:48.779 --> 00:13:01.079
And in India, on this day, when they celebrate
in the morning, children of the village or

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:15.449
children of the particular areas gather together.
And for them the house-holders tie a little

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:24.230
pitcher, which we call as a matka, and in
that there is money, anything valuable they

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:33.489
want to give to the children, sweets, everything
put inside, and is tied up in the air. Normally

00:13:33.489 --> 00:13:40.350
it rains, if it doesn’t rain then they pour
water on the children to make them feel it’s

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:51.889
raining. Rain is very much connected with
Shri Krishna. So the children come and they

00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:59.929
go in a way that the taller boys are first,
then smaller, then smaller like a pyramid

00:13:59.929 --> 00:14:06.459
they go up till at the end there’s one boy
who’s sort of representing Shri Krishna

00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:14.299
and then he breaks that. And from there everything
falls down and flowers, everything on them,

00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:23.019
they take the money, they take all those things
and start enjoying. Then they go to another

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:31.419
place, the whole day they are moving in the
city like that and every good house-holder

00:14:31.419 --> 00:14:43.329
ties that matka for these children, for them
to come and enjoy themselves. That’s in

00:14:43.329 --> 00:14:51.389
the real sense, is the Krishna Astami in Gokul
where He lived as a child.

00:14:51.389 --> 00:15:08.779
Now why is He so much connected with rain?
Once all His friends and He were looking after

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:23.139
the cows and Indra felt that He is very powerful,
somehow, I don’t know, He gets into jealousies

00:15:23.139 --> 00:15:46.519
sometimes. And He sent rain to test His patience,
His leela, His play, His mirth. It rained

00:15:46.519 --> 00:16:00.929
and rained and rained and they did not know
what to do. So there was a mountain called

00:16:00.929 --> 00:16:10.129
Govardhan. Shri Krishna lifted it with His
stick or His finger and just put it up on

00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:18.410
top of His finger, like that. That’s why
He is called as Govardhan Dhari. And the whole

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:30.239
mountain was on top and all the children joined
Him and now the cows and He asked the children,

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:40.229
“You also put your sticks up to help.”
And they all put their sticks and standing

00:16:40.229 --> 00:16:56.079
very sweetly holding the Govardhan. That is
one of His names, Govardhan Dhari.

00:16:56.079 --> 00:17:03.959
So the rain had to come and the cows with
their bells have to remind us. Imagine the

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:13.120
lake has a name which is a black; Krishna
means black, Krishna word itself means black.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:24.280
How Sahaj the whole thing has worked out.
Can you see the coincidences are so Sahaj

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:42.120
but are so . And here we are sitting, it’s
raining, nicely enjoying everything. But on

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:56.700
the contrary when we start not enjoying we
play into, either into our ego or superego.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:12.730
Supposing we are starved people, tortured
people, then we start making others like ourselves.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:25.519
We like to make them suffer and torture them.
That’s why I always say, “Poverty is leprosy.”

00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:31.610
Anybody who is in poverty can develop horrible
things within themselves. It is never to be

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:36.120
sided with, not to be sympathized but to be
completely eradicated.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:46.139
Another side is the ego where we try to dominate
others and enjoy that. There’s no joy, there’s

00:18:46.139 --> 00:18:54.940
no joy in dominating others and saying things
to others. I was sorry to hear yesterday that

00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:00.179
there are some girls who are married, some
Indian girls who are married and their husbands

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:06.130
are not respecting them and troubling them.
It hurt Me very much. That shows they’re

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:13.870
so low level people, very low level. Such
a mediocracy, such useless people. They should

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:22.870
have never come to Sahaja Yoga and deceived
us like this. They will go to hell direct,

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.830
I can tell you this.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:33.840
Now there are some who are caught up with
their superego; they suffer from some sort

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:47.950
of a funny Sahaja Yoga schizophrenia. And
they don’t want to get rid or it. They just

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:53.190
don’t want to understand that they’re
not normal people, they have to be perfectly

00:19:53.190 --> 00:20:05.940
all right. They make everyone miserable, jump
on to all the places where they should not

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:13.340
be. Like a person who has got, say, example,
tuberculosis, a disease which is contagious.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:22.630
Must understand he has got tuberculosis, keep
out, don’t give it to others, at least.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:30.929
But those who have got badhas will definitely
come, either they’ll give big lectures.

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:41.889
I start seeing them like big bhoots speaking,
or if not they have badhas then they will

00:20:41.889 --> 00:20:45.460
come at a place where they should not be.
They’ll put their hands in the prasada,

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:52.220
they’ll be sitting in the puja in the front,
all kinds of things they’ll be doing, catching

00:20:52.220 --> 00:21:05.500
people. And they enjoy it because they are
identified with the badhas. How will they

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.389
improve?

00:21:07.389 --> 00:21:15.350
There’s one fellow who is a bhootish fellow,
we have had him for, I think, for at least

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:23.809
for a century I should say, and he’s giving
lectures to others, “You must clean the

00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:33.960
shoes of all the Sahaja Yogis to get rid of
your ego.” So such a gross, depraved and

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:44.129
low level people are still in Sahaja Yoga.
So the enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga becomes less.

00:21:44.129 --> 00:21:58.399
If you eat rice with stones in it, how will
you enjoy it? And that’s what it is.

00:21:58.399 --> 00:22:11.100
We are here to enjoy the blessings of God,
to have the mirth but still we are living

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:24.700
with all joy-killing things that we have.
How are we going to get rid of those things.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:35.210
So at least we do not become thorns in the
lives of others. So the so-called free will,

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:40.200
I’m happy Rustom has told you about it,
is nothing but your ego and superego because

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:53.120
you’re not in the center. In the center,
you have nothing but freedom, that’s all,

00:22:53.120 --> 00:23:03.759
nothing but freedom; nothing like free will,
freedom, complete freedom. There’s nothing

00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:19.940
like will or nothing like bhoots, nothing
like bondage, it’s entire avenue of freedom.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:41.049
Then this freedom is the knowledge, this freedom
is the love, this freedom is the discretion.

00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:51.720
Then you say God gives you freedom and others
freedom equally then you act which doesn’t

00:23:51.720 --> 00:24:04.580
bound you nor anybody else because it is knowledge,
it is discretion.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:16.590
Age does not matter, what age you are. I’ve
seen some also very old people singing beautifully

00:24:16.590 --> 00:25:40.259
and enjoying Sahaja Yoga

00:25:40.259 --> 00:29:11.159
and make Me enjoy also. Life is for us to
enjoy, nothing else. But because we’re not

00:29:11.159 --> 00:31:55.980
free people, we cannot enjoy. There is no
bondage of

00:31:55.980 --> 00:34:47.849
any evil thought

00:34:47.849 --> 00:37:07.230
which keeps you down. It is so subtle but
penetrating into every that is gross, that

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:24.219
is Shri Krishna’s beautiful flute which
creates a picture of the nature. The description

00:37:24.219 --> 00:37:32.089
, the whole thing becomes silent like a picture.

00:37:32.089 --> 00:38:08.859
So this evening we’ll have the puja, we’ll
have
all the enjoyment of Shri Krishna’s blessings

00:38:08.859 --> 00:39:23.049
upon us. There’s no end to

00:39:23.049 --> 00:44:37.390
the stories of

00:44:37.390 --> 00:47:32.470
Shri Krishna, all full of mirth and play and
innocence that kills rakshashas, devils. So

00:47:32.470 --> 00:48:43.890
today I’ve talked to

00:48:43.890 --> 00:50:07.180
you

00:50:07.180 --> 00:55:29.359
about His childhood, and the puja I’ll tell
you about Gita.

00:55:29.359 --> 00:56:22.680
May God bless you.
