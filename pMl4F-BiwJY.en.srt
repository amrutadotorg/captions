00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,170
October 9, 1987
Mahalakshmi Puja, Belgium

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:12,170
It was so very nice to come to Belgium and
have so many people for our program and I

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:24,960
must say, now we are getting to people who
are very sensitive. [translation follows - yes]

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,640
It is a .. it is a new dimension I think,
I feel, we are entering into. Because now

5
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:03,620
we are really getting people who are seriously
interested in their realization and are very

6
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,880
respectful. And that aggressiveness is much
less. You don’t find anybody being aggressive.

7
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,950
So we can say, that now the road is paved
for all of you to work it out in a Sahaj manner

8
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:46,139
to bring them properly to Sahaja Yoga and
settle them nicely. Now this Sahaj manner

9
00:01:53,139 --> 00:02:00,139
should be understood. In a Sahaj manner, when
they come to you, you must know they are absolutely

10
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:10,359
new to Sahaja Yoga.

11
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:18,610
So first and foremost thing, you should not
talk about Me. You should not tell them anything

12
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:29,750
about Me; but you have to tell them about
Sahaja Yoga and about yourself. Like you can

13
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:48,379
say, “I had the same problem as you have.”
Or you can say that “See, it took me more

14
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,840
time then it 
took you.” It’s a little lie, but doesn’t
matter. [Shri Mataji laughs.] You see, because

15
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:22,140
first of all, you must understand human beings.
If you tell them directly “You are bad”

16
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:32,450
or “You are evil; you are bootish” then
they will run away, though it is true.

17
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:44,099
A lady from France came to see Me. She said
that “They told me I’m evil.” So I said,

18
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,620
“No, no you are not. Who told you that?”
And gradually she improved. So you have to

19
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:13,260
tell them that “You are the Spirit” and
whatever is hanging on to them will be dropped

20
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,640
out 
and will be cleared out by their Kundalini.
So if that happens they feel happy and they

21
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,620
get their benevolence. It is how beautifully
you handle another person.

22
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:59,199
Now there maybe people who want to argue.
With them you should say, “You know, you

23
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:10,479
cannot argue it out, because it is beyond
human awareness.” And you better tell them

24
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:21,810
that it is … “You better take your Realization,
then we will talk about it. Not before your

25
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,410
Realization.” So then, if they are not getting
any Realization, you don’t tell them that

26
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:40,410
“There is a bhoot sitting in your left Nabhi
or right Nabhi.” This is our language – Sahaja

27
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:54,449
Yogi’s language, not their language. Ya,
so you have to be very careful to handle them

28
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:04,930
very carefully.
Now there could be a problem between, say,

29
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:14,289
a sad man’s parent’s mother and a daughter
or maybe husband and wife. So …

30
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:22,410
(Just a minute, this side - listen to Me,
all right? All of you should pay attention

31
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:38,379
to Me. All right? No, no it’s all right.
Let her be there. It’s all right, but she

32
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,500
should pay attention this time, all right?
Sit down.)

33
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:54,500
So we have to tell them that “You carry
on, don’t worry about it, because the inner

34
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:02,979
joy will start giving you strength.” 
Then gradually the another partner will understand
you - 
see you’re honest, your purpose and would

35
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,560
try to appreciate you. Gradually it works
out. But if it does not, then we’ll see

36
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:46,080
about it. Now when you handle them with love
and care, you can establish them. But if they

37
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:09,009
start misbehaving you also should not lose
temper at all. You should be very forgiving.

38
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:24,639
Now I must say, that in Sahaja Yoga you have
to respect your leaders. Of course, you might

39
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:38,150
not find them perfect, maybe. Or maybe 
you may find them to be little bossy, possibly.
But you need some bossing sometimes. And leaders

40
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:07,390
must know how to also correct people, because
you need correction. I met a lady, I was telling

41
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:21,269
you, we had told them, that you need not have
a guru. So, she said “No, no we must have

42
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:32,740
somebody to guide us. And that guru will guide
us and also will support us, so we would like

43
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:47,010
to follow him. In spite of the fact he is
a very bossy fellow and he always gets annoyed

44
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:54,290
with us and he takes money from us. And it’s
not a guru, if he’s not, if he is very soft,

45
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:10,560
means he should not be kind.”

46
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,200
So we have another kind also of people who
want somebody to dominate 
them for their spiritual ascent. They are

47
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:39,810
better people, because they want their ascent
in any case. And they accept corrections,

48
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:54,490
because they want their ascent. That’s the
first thing. So even if the leader bosses,

49
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:03,550
they like it very much. In some places people
told Me, “Our guru is very soft – we must

50
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:16,209
get some strong fellow.” 
So I leave it to the leaders, who are called
as gurus by some people to be kind, compassionate,

51
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:47,529
good. But should not compromise with nonsense
and laziness. Because the first thing, people

52
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:01,930
get into is laziness after Sahaja Yoga. We
have to be committed. Now I too have a family

53
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:18,010
and I have grandchildren. My daughter has
come all the way to see Me in London. She’s

54
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:27,250
been there for one month and I haven’t been
there yet. She’s waiting for Me.

55
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:45,260
So it’s all right, one has to do it. This
is My commitment, because this is your purpose

56
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:57,990
of life. And the purpose that you have mainly
is to ascend and help others to ascend. You

57
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:14,850
are special people, who have to do such a
tremendous task. Otherwise how can we have

58
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:25,459
lots of people coming to Sahaja Yoga? So the
Sahaja way is to yourself improve with meditation

59
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:44,570
and introspect yourself and see yourself.
You must meditate and you should not see the

60
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,339
defects of others.

61
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:04,339
The second thing to be Sahaj is to be collective.
If you do not meet collectively every day,

62
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:20,449
then there will be a problem. In the collective
only the maturity starts. It is a living process

63
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:32,019
as I told you. Now supposing a tree is growing
and you take out a leaf from there and the

64
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:45,639
leaf will say, “I’m going to grow by myself.”
It cannot grow. It will be left out. So that

65
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:03,670
is what one has to remember: that it is a
collective happening. We all have to meet

66
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,290
and grow together.

67
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:18,290
Now, those who are not collective will disappear
one day into thin air, like a dead leaf. I

68
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:33,920
think people don’t understand the meaning
of collective happening. It is just like a

69
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:45,610
tree growing and with the tree everything
else that belongs to tree also grows. So for

70
00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:01,060
the growth of this tree one has to remember
that you have to stick onto the tree. But

71
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,800
the tree is not going to run after you, “Stick
on, stick on to me, stick on to me.” For

72
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:24,529
that whatever has to be done, has to be done.
You know, when the winter comes, all the leaves

73
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:39,019
fall off. What they do is to create a barrier
between themselves and the tree by some living

74
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,759
process. They create a barrier in between,
there's a little bark that comes in between.

75
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Now when that happens the leaves fall off
and the tree becomes barren.

76
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:16,710
Now same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga. When
you do not accept the principle of Sahaja

77
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:29,130
Yoga you put a barrier in between the sap
and 
the leaf. Now when that happens, the leaf

78
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:48,220
falls off. So you have to open out yourself,
your heart, everything to suck in the sap

79
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:56,980
to nourish. You have to give up your Ego and
Superego, your conditionings and ideas you

80
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:16,540
have had from before. This is what is the
surrender, is the Islam. And that is to be

81
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:34,310
achieved. But that is not going to help the
tree, it is going to help you. Now some people

82
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:46,530
say, “I'm not ready.” Then how will you
grow? Actually when a little child is born,

83
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,700
immediately it wants to suck in the mother's
nourishment. It feels it has starved all this

84
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:10,570
time and it should suck mother's milk immediately.
And all those are seekers, once they find

85
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:25,650
their Realization must behave in that manner.
They should all give up all the conditionings

86
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:37,280
and all these nonsensical ideas and immediately
push themselves and also cleanse themselves

87
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,200
fully to suck in more and more of this nourishment.

88
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:02,730
But it does not happen that way. That's why
some people do not grow that fast. It is a

89
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:16,890
pure intelligence that gives you that sense
I think. Pure intelligence comes from pure

90
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,240
heart and if you pay more attention to your
heart, your Spirit, then it will work out.

91
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:43,450
In the course of your movement in Sahaja Yoga
you will see you’ll be blessed. Not only

92
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,460
that you’ll have the blessings but you will
have jobs, you will have money or else children

93
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:12,080
will pass with flying colors. They will become
obedient. Your health will improve, you will

94
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,760
get money, you will get married, you will
have nice children, wise wife, you’ll get

95
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:43,010
homes and ashrams. But these are all temptations.
Many people get lost in one of those. Now

96
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:03,350
supposing I've to catch the plane and on the
way I see very nice gardens or things, then

97
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:16,900
I get down to enjoy the gardens, how will
I reach the airport and the aeroplane? So

98
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:30,240
these temptations must be seen as just entertainments…
as entertainments. Entertainment, all right?

99
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:54,910
Now our understanding of Sahaj is simple if
you do not think about it. But if you start

100
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:13,680
thinking you’ll go mad. How can you explain
that a person just like you can give Realization

101
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:23,870
to thousands? How can you explain that you
can see the sun on My heart in a picture?

102
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:43,140
All this pictures which are there, how can
you explain? For example, you get My photographs

103
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:53,210
in the sky, is a fact. How will you explain
that? So it is beyond your brains. So better

104
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:09,370
not think about it. Just gradually accept
the joy. I always say I've done the cooking

105
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:20,310
for you and very good food. Now only thing
is for you to eat it and taste it. Why do

106
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,600
you want to know, how it was cooked, when
it was kept and what else has been done to

107
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:46,270
make it so tasty? You should just appreciate
and enjoy. Like a painting you have, you don't

108
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:06,400
think, “From where did he get the paint,
how did he paint and how was he sitting, what

109
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,850
food he must have taken, before or after?”

110
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:25,850
But in Sahaja Yoga we do these ridiculous
things, you know. It's very surprising, that

111
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:39,580
people do not understand one simple thing:
that Kundalini has risen without thinking

112
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:46,580
and not by our effort. The Kundalini has given
us this good health, good temperament and

113
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:05,950
has changed us so much. So She is going to
do the job, only thing we should try to support

114
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:17,270
Her and to keep our central path clean. It's
very simple.

115
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:30,150
So now I feel very much encouraged to that
from Holland and from Belgium we have such

116
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:36,500
nice Sahaja Yogis here, and also I would say
it is rather difficult for some people to

117
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:42,770
come to India. But try to come, because those
who have been to India have settled down much

118
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:49,770
better, because India has got something magical
about it, that it transforms people to a deeper

119
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:58,300
level. You should not come half heartedly.
I feel that those who can come on [literally??

120
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,570
– UNCLEAR] should not find excuses, “I'm
not ready, I'm not thinking”, because such

121
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:03,570
half hearted people are not going to gain
anything. You 
have to come with full force, as I told you

122
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:21,120
the newly born child, otherwise it is useless.
Don't play into the tricks of your mind. It's

123
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:40,610
like a donkey - if you take a donkey lightly,
then it will just start grazing anywhere it

124
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:53,250
finds grass. And if it knows that the person
sitting on his back is a lousy fellow or a

125
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:08,240
lazy person, it will drop him. And when it
knows that it can go ahead of the person then

126
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:22,430
it can even kick you back. That is how your
mind is. It dominates you, it sometimes starts

127
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:40,040
grazing on pastures and you think that's a
very good thing, you are very peaceful or

128
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:52,570
else it starts dominating you. So how to manage
this donkey? Best way is to catch hold of

129
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:09,890
the ears, and carry it with you. Donkey is
for you, you are not for the donkey. So this

130
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:27,300
is one of the hurdles, that we have very much.

131
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:38,190
As far as you all are concerned you have to
know that Sahaja Yoga is to be understood

132
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:48,170
not by brain, but by heart. I have known people
who can give big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,

133
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,840
can write books, but have no vibrations. So
this is not the way Sahaja Yoga is. You have

134
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:14,420
to be a Yogi. That's a religion in a way in
our being. That's the religion of a Yogi.

135
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Like human beings have ten valencies, a Yogi
must have at least eleven valencies. And the

136
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:46,140
eleventh valency integrates you with the religion.
You get identified with righteousness, with

137
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:06,040
compassion, with love, with assiduity - perseverance
- or also detachment. That means you do not

138
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:31,810
expect anything. You do it for doing’s sake.
You love for loving’s sake. That's the best

139
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:45,330
way to enjoy. You enjoy your loving capacity.
You enjoy your generosity. You enjoy your

140
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:01,980
forgiveness. Enjoy all these great qualities
of righteousness. You’ll never feel hurt.
