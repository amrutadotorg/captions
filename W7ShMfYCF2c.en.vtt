00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.020
I'm happy that Dr. Warren could explain to you

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.000
those chakras about which I told you yesterday,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.150
because in one short lecture

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.080
you can't cover all these points.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.190
And if you get your Realization

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.030
and you progress well,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
then you can listen to My tapes

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.000
which are in hundreds,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.140
and you can understand the knowledge is vast like ocean.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.090
As I yesterday told you

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.160
that when you get enlightenment,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.170
you become the knowledge.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.090
It's a very confused statement;

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.160
people don't understand

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.000
what does it mean to "become the knowledge."

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.140
The other day a gentleman came to Me and he told Me that

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.090
"My guru has already given me the knowledge."

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.060
I said, "How?"

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.150
"Because he told me, 'I've given you the knowledge.'"

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.140
I said, "But still, how is it, it is knowledge?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.060
How do you believe that he has given you the knowledge?"

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.150
So he said, "No Mother, he touched me on my forehead

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.140
and I saw a light."

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.200
I said, "Then still, you can see the light otherwise also.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.230
How is it you have got the knowledge?"

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.220
So he started thinking about it.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.030
He said that "What should happen If I get the knowledge?"

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.030
I said, "See, this is another person sitting next to you,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.050
he is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.130
He knows what Kundalini is;

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.130
also he knows how to raise your Kundalini.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.080
He knows what is your problem,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.110
what your chakras are catching.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.170
He also knows what are his problems."

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.000
So he asked Me, "How does he know?"

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.000
I said, "He has become the knowledge."

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.030
As I yesterday I told you,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.190
that on your central nervous system you should be able

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.080
to feel others and yourself which is inside.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.160
Now, for example, a person who is mad.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.100
When he started becoming mad, he did not realize.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.220
He did not realize that he's already possessed

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.080
and that he's getting mad,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.160
and that he should have treatment, nothing he realized.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.100
Gradually he became mad and he is in the lunatic asylum.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.000
Or a person who gets a cancer

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.190
doesn't know he has developed a cancer,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.110
till they say that

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.130
"Now it's hardly fifteen days you have to die."

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.160
This is on physical level, mental level.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.220
A person who is egoistical

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.160
does not know that he is egoistical,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.080
that he's oppressing others

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.030
and that others are part and parcel of himself.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.100
Like Hitler never realized

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.130
that he was such a horrible devil,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.140
that he will go to hell

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.060
and those who were around Hitler that time

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.080
did not realize that a devil is growing in this society.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.030
That a devil is going to come.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.020
Nobody realized everything,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.110
and suddenly after eleven years he comes back

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.240
as a horrible, destructive, satanic force.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.210
So if you read the books written before his regime,

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.220
they were actually supporting him.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.060
Because they said that "We are getting decadent,

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.060
our society is decadent

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.060
and we need a person who'll take us to austerities

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.030
and who will make us a little disciplined;

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.240
we need discipline, we must have discipline,"

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.190
and so they liked him.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.110
Even the young students liked him,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.100
when he went to the universities he charmed them by saying,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.060
"We must have discipline, we should be austere,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160
you should not eat this food, you should not that food,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.140
you should become very austere."

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.000
And that thing was very much appreciated

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.030
by the young people.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.240
They did not realize whether this man was a devil or not.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.160
Now knowledge is such that

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.100
in that you see the subtle of yourself and subtle of others.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.050
And the subtle of ours

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.170
and the subtle of others resides in the chakras.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.110
These are the chakras which reside within us,

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.240
and these chakras are the ones

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.030
who cater to the need of any emergencies we have.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.050
For example, if we have to run very fast,

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.080
we can run very fast.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.210
Our heart starts beating, the sympathetic goes into action,

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.130
then these chakras bring it back to normal

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.030
by supplying proper energy

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.030
to that part which has been over-used.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.060
They bring it back to normal.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.220
When, say, on the left hand side and the right hand side

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.190
we have two extraction of the sympathetic nervous system.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.110
When this extraction is too much on the chakras,

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.100
these chakras get separated

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.240
and there is a deity in every chakra.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.130
And when that deity sleeps off,

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.170
there is a separation from the whole,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.240
because that is how we are connected with the whole.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.190
You see, supposing this is the vertebra, it's like this,

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.140
once it is broken off, you are broken off from the whole,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.000
the control is lost.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.020
Once the control is lost,

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.080
then you start working on your own.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.000
Once a cell starts working on its own,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.130
it becomes malignant.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.110
It loses that relationship with the whole

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.100
which gives it balance,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.170
a sense of proportion and coordination,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.110
how much to grow, and that's how cancer is set in.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.100
In the society, also, nowadays

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.110
because the society is becoming ego-oriented,

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.140
we go on saying, "What's wrong?

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.070
What's wrong in this, what's wrong in this?"

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.030
As today, just now Warren was telling you

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.030
that there is a dharma within us.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.070
We have got ten dharmas, the ten sustainers within us,

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.020
the Ten Commandments that we have to obey. Why?

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.160
Because if you go out of them,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.140
then you go into an imbalance.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.080
And if the imbalance is set in,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.240
then you can develop any one of these problems

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.050
which come out of the imbalances.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.110
That is how we cannot cure cancer,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.100
because we cannot make the cells

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.050
go back to its normal condition.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.160
At the most what we can do is to remove the cells

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.080
from the body who start attacking others

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.220
and making them also ego-oriented.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.220
But we cannot make them again normal cells.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.000
Only through vibrations you can do it,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.050
because when you vibrate these centres

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.170
they become more powerful,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.080
they expand their aura

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.240
so the circle that was small becomes bigger,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.210
engulfs both the sides and bring them together,

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.080
and again the deities are awakened

00:07:54.170 --> 00:08:00.100
and the cells start getting the message from the whole.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.130
This is a simple principle, which is a subtle principle,

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.180
but a person who gets a cancer,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.160
how will he know he's got a cancer or not?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.140
Because there is no way of knowing it.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.210
But when you become the knowledge,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.070
you start developing the sensation on your fingers

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:25.180
and there are decoding words,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.020
decoding language which tells you

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.240
which are the centres catching and how to cure it.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.130
Immediately you are on the alert,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.010
because you know it's happening.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.180
Now people who have, say, mental problem,

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.120
they don't know they have mental problem.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.120
Some of them, they are not at all aware of it.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.060
but then they realize they have a mental problem.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.150
A psychiatrist came to see Me,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.070
today only he was with Me,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.200
he is a Sahaja Yogi and he treated some mentally

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.240
handicapped person. He's a psychiatrist,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.000
so he finds always this finger shakes before Me, you see -

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.110
this finger and this thumb.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.090
If this is burning and this is shaking

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.110
that means there's a possession working on you -

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.000
a simple thing like that.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.000
Now this person can clear it out because Sahaja Yogi,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.020
takes hardly two minutes to clear it out.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.130
But the person who has got it can be also cleared out,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.170
because once you know what is the centre,

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.110
and if you know the deities whom to awaken,

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.110
and if you know how to awaken them,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.170
you get it cleared out.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.170
That's how mad people can also get cured.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.130
Now here there's a madman on the road,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.060
just now when he was speaking I was in the room,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.090
he was saying, "You must seek Christ, you must seek God"

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.060
and all those things on the street.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.090
He is himself mad, you see. A mad leading others into what,

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.110
a lunatic asylum?

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.020
He's talking like that loudly,

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.050
"You must seek Lord, you must seek God."

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.090
How? How do you seek?

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.140
Just giving lectures, "Seek the Lord, seek gods"

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.190
- is this the way?

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.090
If I say, “Now put your attention inside" -

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.010
Just now you are sitting in front of Me;

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.060
a simple thing, your attention is towards Me,

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.060
now turn your attention inside. Can you do it?

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.130
You may say, "Yes we are doing it."

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.020
That's wrong; that you are not doing, at all.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.220
Something has to happen within.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.190
Unless and until something happens

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.120
your attention cannot go inside.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.200
Many people just believe into something false,

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.080
go on believing into it till they suffer from it.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:49.080
I've seen people who have been like that. Fanatics.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.140
In their old age they become,

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.120
absolutely either violent people or useless

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.190
or aggressive or boring.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.090
Some of them become really half mad,

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.050
and some of them full mads.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.050
So believing into anything without the knowledge about it

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.090
is a very blind game.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.160
Now sustenance has to be there.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.080
Now we can say in India we have Sikhism

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.170
which is a very great religion.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.170
But the people who belong to Sikhism

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.080
are not supposed to drink at all.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.200
After all, Guru Nanaka when He said,

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.030
"You are not to drink," because He knew about it,

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.110
He knew what He was saying about it.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.000
He was an incarnation of the Primordial Being.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.060
He was the Primordial Master

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.080
and when He said that "You should not drink,"

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.230
now I'm told that in England the Sikh people drink

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:53.160
more than the, even the Scotland people.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.170
It's most surprising.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.160
Imagine! Same about Islam because Mohammed Sahib

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.210
and Nanak Sahib are the same person, same persons,

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.220
He said the same thing.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.160
Moses said the same thing, ask the Jews,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.170
what are they doing?

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.190
He said, "Strong drinks, alcohols, all must be avoided."

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.110
At the time of Mohammed Sahib there were no cigarettes,

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.170
so He didn't say about cigarettes so Moslems say,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.240
"Oh, cigarettes are all right, it doesn't matter."

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.110
You see these things are so, there are so many loopholes.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.100
In India we have communities and communities like that,

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.050
where you go and see, you'll be amazed.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.080
Like Jains, they won't eat meat but they will drink.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.160
Can you imagine?

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.030
Drinking goes against your awareness is a fact,

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.070
while Mahavira has talked about nothing but Chaitanya.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.130
Buddha never said, "Don't eat meat."

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.040
That doesn't mean that you should eat meat,

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.240
but what I'm saying He never talked on that,

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.100
that's not so important.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.180
He Himself, Buddha Himself

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:04.020
died because He ate a raw pork.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:08.050
He went to a house, you see Buddha was a realized soul,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.220
a great personality, He was an incarnation

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:16.110
and He went into a house where, as a guest.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.070
Suddenly He appeared there,

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.160
and the person was just a hunter

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.100
and he said, "Oh Buddha, You have come to my house,

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.050
what should I give You, what should I do?" He said,

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.120
"I have very little time, whatever you have, you give me."

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.170
He said, "I've killed a wild boar,

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.080
but the food is still to be cooked and it will take some time."

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.060
He said, "All right, give Me half way."

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.120
And He died of that.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.220
Even in Jainism, you'd be surprised,

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.150
that Naminath is the first one

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.220
who was the cousin of Shri Krishna.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:49.000
In his marriage there was a big function

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.170
and lots of birds were bought -

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.110
I mean they were Jains, imagine.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:56.130
And the birds and all that, when he saw so many killed,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.050
he got a kind of a feeling against it and he said,

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.020
"All right, no more of this."

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.050
But they have gone to another extreme of vegetarianism,

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.030
I mean they can be very cruel themselves

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.190
but they don't mind that, they can be vegetarians,

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.140
to such an extent that you can't imagine.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.080
So this is the problem with the religion has been,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.160
that you go to extreme of things.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.040
First thing about religion is not to go to extremes,

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.130
that's the basis of every religion.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.050
For Christianity you know Christ has said,

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.160
"Keep away the dead, have nothing to do with the dead,"

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.240
He took out the dead spirits and put them in the pigs

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.120
and put the pigs in the sea.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.190
You all know that story,

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.040
but every church has got all the dead

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.200
lying under their feet.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.160
You don't know how to walk in the church,

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.200
they're all lying down there.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.120
Luckily I have been living or unluckily, I should say,

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.120
living next to the church all the time I've been in England,

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.160
and in the night I see all of them coming out of the graves,

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.240
and I say, "Oh God." And here the children sit down,

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.160
pray to God and everything.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.160
Now, what do they get?

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.160
No wonder Catholicism is bringing such a catastrophe,

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.150
or these so-called Christianity.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.070
I mean the basics of every religion has been contradicted

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.180
by the disciples.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.130
First Christ is the One Who controls the dead.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:29.080
He's the One Who sucks the effects of the dead,

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:34.130
and He absolutely banned them everywhere you go, any church.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.070
Only in India they don't do it somehow,

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.030
I don't know how they have managed it.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.080
But here every church you go there's dead bodies hanging there.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.200
Sahaja Yogis now don't go to church, because they are frightened.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.070
Once a Sahaja Yogi is caught up by a spirit,

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.240
immediately he knows, he gets headache,

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.050
he doesn't want to go there.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.190
But a person who is not a Sahaja Yogi, he goes to a church,

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.100
he catches the bhoot, he does not know.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:01.110
One of My disciples had a mother who was a Catholic lady,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.160
very staunch Catholic, and she was MA in mathematics

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.220
and things like that, you see, and very staunch Catholic.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.220
She came to see Me and I told her

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.210
that "You should give up all this fanaticism

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.110
about church-going, because in the church

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.020
there are all these dead bodies placed there."

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.080
But she wouldn't listen to Me.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.050
Now then after old age, about sixty years

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.020
they go mad actually, really,

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.240
and she started using her bidet for W.C.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.240
and all sorts of things, problems arose.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.190
But she would get up in the morning of Sunday,

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.100
get ready and go to church and come back very nicely.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.020
Every time it was a Sunday, she would get up,

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.040
she would dress up well, go to church and come back.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.220
As if somebody was taking her down there

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.100
and somebody was bringing her back.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.070
But one day it happened that she got lost,

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.020
and this lady telephoned to the police and said,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.220
"What to do now, this lady is lost, and my mother is lost,"

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.010
and she got very worried. She telephoned to Me I said,

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.220
"You'll find her, she's all right, but she'll come back."

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.190
After three days she came from somewhere, God knows,

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.090
came back and again she started the same things,

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.110
using this for that, and that for that,

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.230
and absolutely like a mad person. But the police said,

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.200
"Nothing doing, now you’d better put her

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.070
in the old mad ones’ place."

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.180
So she put her in one of these places

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.210
where the old people live.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:26.240
Now this Marie, My disciple she told Me it's most amazing,

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.150
the people who are there are mostly Catholics or Christians.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.040
They are all mad like this,

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.090
the nurses are having a bad time,

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.130
but all of them get ready on a Sunday

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:40.040
and go to a church which is specially made for them.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.160
Can you imagine?

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.230
Just look at this obsession,

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.100
it's an obsession with us,

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.130
we must know these are obsessions,

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.020
we are not free people; we are slaves to these things.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.180
Now once you come to this side,

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:03.120
the other side of slavery are our habits, they enslave us.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.070
They enslave us, I have seen now people,

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:11.230
we once had a minister sitting with Me

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:17.160
and a Russian minister, very powerful man otherwise.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.100
And suddenly he got up, he was the host,

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.240
suddenly he got up, "Oh I must go."

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.030
I said, "What happened?"

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.190
He said, "I am a sick man." I said, "What's the matter with you?"

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.000
"You see, I am a football fan and I can't sit any longer,

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.240
the football match must have started."

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.110
Imagine, he was the chief host,

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.020
and so many people were there, he just couldn't sit.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.110
I mean, he could not glue himself to the chair

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.020
and he wanted to get up and walk,

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.110
and he just didn't know what to do.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.130
I was amazed, he had no poise, no control over himself,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.210
I mean I just thought must be some possession

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.100
from this football is coming to him, or what is it?

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.180
But such a grown - up, matured person behaves like this!

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.180
This is nothing, other habits that we have are much worse,

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.100
are much worse and they all enslave us,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.010
we can't live without them.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.210
Anything that is in this world is for us,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.150
we are not for anything.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.100
If anything can enslave us,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.190
we should know that we are the masters of everything.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.150
If a chair doesn't make you

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.150
comfortable or uncomfortable,

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.010
it's not important.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.180
What is important is that this doesn't enslave you.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.120
Nothing should enslave you.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.060
The one who is a king, who is the emperor,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.090
is least bothered.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.240
If you put that person on the street, he'll sleep well.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.040
If you put him anywhere he'll be happy,

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.100
that's the person is the real emperor.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.190
But not the emperor who cannot live without

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.020
complete comfort.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:49.040
If he's slave of the comfort, then he's not an emperor.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.180
All these things we can learn

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.220
when our centre here, Nabhi Chakra, is awakened,

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.130
when the light spreads in that area,

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.160
in the Void the green color you see,

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.180
then what happens immediately in that light

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.130
you don't see anything

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.110
but the light works.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.110
Enlightenment is such that it goes into action,

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.080
the light itself acts, can you imagine?

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.110
The light itself act in you.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.210
We had a doctor who was very fond of wine,

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.180
his drinks and all. I never tell you, "Don't drink."

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.130
I never say that, because I don't want people to run away.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.220
No, no, nothing of the kind.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.180
You sit down comfortably, just take your Realization,

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.080
then you'll see about it.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.050
This fellow gave up his drinking next day,

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.120
but then he had to go to Germany, and he thought,

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:45.020
"I’d better try some special type of wine,"

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.210
that he had liked.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.240
So he tried it and then he vomited, vomited, vomited,

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.130
couldn't bear. He said,

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:56.040
"The taste was so bad; I never tasted such a dirty thing."

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.080
I never told him. It just happened.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:03.020
He saved money, he could buy things out of the money

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.100
he saved and he was a free bird.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.130
But I don't have to tell you this,

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.110
because we are so addicted and identified,

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.160
that even if you say that

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.210
"This can happen with Sahaja Yoga," many people will refuse.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:22.080
Our identifications have gone so deeper into our beings,

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.240
so deeper into our being,

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.070
our hangs-up, as we say, that we are not free people at all.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.150
We might be free politically all right,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.070
but this is so superficial.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.110
The Spirit is the only thing that is free within,

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:41.070
which has no hangs-up, which has no habits,

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.010
which does not stick on to anything,

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.220
is completely detached and emitting joy to us.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.240
It is a thing that makes our Spirit,

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.150
our attention so enlightened.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.110
Now enlightened attention, as I said,

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.190
is not the attention that we understand,

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.130
that "There's a light, we see the light,"

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.170
nothing of the kind.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.060
But with this enlightened attention

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.240
our awareness becomes enlightened,

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.240
so that we start feeling other people on our hands.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.220
Like the other person here sitting yesterday

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.010
you must have seen.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.120
The other day one gentleman was here and he told Me that

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.050
"Your energies are different from mine,"

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.210
nothing of the kind.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.120
If you have negative energies

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.010
for the time being you will shake,

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.230
definitely you will shake for a while, no doubt,

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.240
if you have too much negative energies.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.070
Like once we had a program

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.080
and some people were there, some Brahmins,

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.130
and they were very much against Me

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.190
because I'm not a Brahmin.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.020
They said, "We'll not have Mother's program."

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.050
I didn't know all these stories, they never told Me,

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.020
but they came before Me and started shaking like this,

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.150
so I said, "Why are you shaking so much?"

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.130
They said, "We are Brahmins and we understand

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.050
You are Shakti, so we are shaking."

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.150
I said, "But why are you shaking? Nobody is shaking here."

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.100
So they pointed out to other four people,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.050
they said, "See, they are also shaking."

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.150
So I said, "Go and find out from where do they come."

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:13.010
They went and found out that they came from lunatic asylum.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.150
I said, "Relatively you should see who are shaking and

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.160
who are these people, nobody else."

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.230
So if there are negative forces you do shake a little bit.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.100
But we should see again what's the use,

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.230
what's the use of getting this energy within us?

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.070
That is very important because we are

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:41.080
utility-oriented people. Everything must have an utility,

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.190
as it is what do we have which has utility in this world?

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.190
Nothing.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.020
If we had something which had real utility

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.200
we would not hanker after anything else.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.100
The hankering is still on.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.100
So we should conclude that whatever we have got now

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.190
is not the ultimate.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.150
The utility of the ultimate is that

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:10.100
once you get the ultimate, everything becomes relative,

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.020
everything becomes relative.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.020
That is, what becomes relative

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.230
is all these changing things,

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.160
all those things which are perishable,

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.050
all those things which try to enslave us,

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.150
all those things they’re attracted outwardly,

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:33.240
but inside they are like snakes,

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.070
and what we become is a detached personality.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:45.130
(Mother is speaking Hindi: There is some problem putting)

00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:01.140
Now, our idea about any

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.090
understanding about religion

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:11.030
is that we go to a limited church and a limited society,

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.080
a limited club, do exactly the same,

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.200
wear the same sort of dresses, wear the same sort of cap

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.200
or things we belong to one religion.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.120
There is nothing like that, it's all manmade,

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.220
you see it's all artificial.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.200
Whatever is manmade is artificial you know that.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.220
They write it down also for

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:34.150
all the clothes that are made by man,

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:38.060
they said "manmade material," so it is not God- made,

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.200
it’s we have made our own religions and we are fighting for it.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.000
The religions are something within yourself,

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.170
within your being.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.140
It has nothing to do with what sort of nonsense

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.170
we have made out of it.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.140
This is the quality of a person,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.190
like carbon has got four valencies,

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.030
you have got these ten valencies.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.040
And if these valencies are missing then what happens,

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.000
that as in the combination of chemical combinations

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.110
you have seen, if one valency is missing,

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.060
then it becomes a negative,

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.080
and then it combines with another

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.000
so there are negative and positive valencies.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.020
So if you have some additional valencies with you,

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.210
then you will jump onto other people;

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.020
if you have less, then you catch some other people.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:30.130
It's exactly the same as it happens in a chemical compound.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.040
Now these valencies within us are to be there to give us a balance,

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.190
and that's what Warren has told you what it means.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.000
When you get your Realization, your dharma,

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.240
your Ten Commandments get enlightened.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.000
Means you get empowered,

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.220
you become that.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.040
You go beyond religion.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.000
You don't have to follow anybody, you just become.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.000
You become so integrated.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.050
For example,

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.190
some people it doesn't suit to have, say, potatoes,

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.050
they will just don't like it, just don't like it.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.110
Before Realization it is just the other way round,

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.230
if they are not suppose to eat potatoes,

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.230
they'll eat potatoes more.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.120
After Realization, you won't just have it,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.220
you won't have it, you are so integrated.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:24.010
The sustenance within us gets so enlightened

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.030
that our priorities change completely;

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.040
we start judging everything on vibrations.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.110
Now, we have a little girl you have seen, Olympia,

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.010
she eats very little,

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.150
practically solid food she does not eat.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:42.110
But if I give her anything to eat, she will eat,

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.220
from nobody else; but if I give her anything

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.080
she'll ask for more and eat it.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.010
It's surprising, she understands vibrations.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.180
If you understand vibrations

00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:00.230
then it is very easy to retain your valencies intact,

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.040
because you are empowered.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.090
Not only that, but you just don't like anything else

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.060
because you like the vibrations to flow.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.000
When the vibrations are flowing,

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.010
the Spirit is emitting

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:17.080
through your central nervous system ‘the joy’

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.120
that is the quality of your Spirit.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.090
The joy you start feeling,

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:25.170
and when you start feeling the joy,

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.050
then you don't want to give up. For anything you

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.010
just don't want to give up, you want to enjoy it.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.150
So you become the knowledge,

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.100
and the attention which is actually placed in this area

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.160
and sustained by your liver, becomes enlightened.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.100
As I told you yesterday, sitting down here,

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.160
if you want to feel

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.130
about anyone you can find out.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.220
Like just now I saw one gentleman

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.090
sitting a little awkwardly, I thought,

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.140
he is not sitting properly, I said, "Sit properly."

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.080
But then I paid attention to him,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.220
I knew he is not well so I said, "Have you got any problem?"

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.160
He said, "Yes." I said, "Then it is all right."

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.170
So with attention you immediately understand a person,

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.220
what's the problem with that person is.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.080
Sitting down here you can find out the vibrations of anyone.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.050
For example now we can say -

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.020
if there is no Russian! - that

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:23.000
(should I say or not?)

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.050
Brezhnev is possessed.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:29.040
He is a possessed man just now.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.020
I'm going to Russia, I hope I'll take out his possessions.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.150
He's a possessed man.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:38.050
They are dealing in these parapsychology,

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.180
same in America it's going to happen,

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.070
it is going to happen everywhere

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:46.150
where you try to practice these spirit,

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.150
spiritualists and all that what we call preta vidya,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.070
smashana vidya and all that

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.050
which is absolutely horrible things,

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.110
calling them with sophisticated names

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:00.240
like “parapsychology” and calling, by

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.100
what other names they call it? -

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.150
charismatic movements and all sorts.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.160
It's nothing but spirits,

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.140
nothing but spirits.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.080
All these people are practicing nothing but spirits.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.170
They bring out these dead spirits

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.190
and call it the Holy Ghost, imagine?

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.000
This charismatic movement is another horrible thing,

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.220
I don't know how to tell you about it,

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:31.140
but I must say that the whole science

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.080
has become so subtle that nobody knows that

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.170
this is the scorpious, horrible, satanic force

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.090
that is working through us and attracting

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.140
us to these spirits.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Some people said,

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.090
"Mother there are good spirits and bad spirits."

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.070
But why, why, why go to the dead?

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.020
You don't know which is good and which is bad.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.120
How will you know, why go to the dead?

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.230
We have to be in the present,

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.240
we don't have to be in the past.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.130
So that's one thing happens

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:04.130
when you lose your valencies, that you go to the left.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.240
When you go to the right, you may be very austere,

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.230
you don't eat that food, that food, and this and that,

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.060
you may become a very ego-oriented person.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.150
You go to another side, called supraconscious,

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.120
the collective supraconscious.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.230
The left side is the collective subconscious

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.170
and the right side is the collective supraconscious.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.100
When I started My work

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.050
I decided not to talk about these dead spirits.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.190
I said, "I'll manage without that."

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.080
But it's not possible. For three years I never talked about it.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.190
I didn't talk about the deities,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.050
I didn't talk about anything.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:43.000
For three years I managed it,

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.210
but then among us a lady came who was practicing

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.020
all these things, and she possessed so many people.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.180
And thousands of people used to go to her.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.210
She would tell them which horse will come first,

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.190
where is the money lost.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.150
All sorts of things,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.190
and thousands of people used to throng, you know.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.100
Here we have so few people but let some tantrika come in

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:15.100
you won't be able to control your traffic.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:16.180
This will be the condition,

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.180
with any one of these horrible people coming in.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:25.050
And this lady really made Me talk of these things

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.180
and that's what it is. They exist.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.240
So going to the left or to the right,

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.100
you go into a problem,

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.150
because you enter into an unknown area

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.190
which is very dangerous, very dangerous.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.180
For your information cancer is caused by left side movement.

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.220
I've not seen one patient of cancer

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.240
who has had no such experiences.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.070
For example, these fake gurus,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.130
or these initiation by this horrible people,

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.240
or reading the books of these left sided things

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.050
like what's his name, Rampa Sampa,

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.210
and all these so-called Buddhists:

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.160
any one of these things can cause cancer.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:13.210
And recently I saw a very good film on this,

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:17.160
by your television here, English television.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.040
They showed where some doctors had made

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:24.160
an investigation and they said that they have seen

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.110
that the cancer is triggered by some proteins

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.020
which they recognize;

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.220
they call them as 52 - protein 52,

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:34.180
58 - that's the name they give.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.150
But they recognized that they are coming

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.180
from the area which is built within us since our creation.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.080
So it is the collective subconscious,

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.150
and they have pictured also, photographed.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:53.200
So now, though I mean what I have said about ten years back,

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:54.200
they are saying now.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:56.130
But they are reaching that point

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:58.050
they have to just cross the limit.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.220
They have to just get their Realization,

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:06.000
and because the doctors cannot reach that area themselves,

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:09.020
they cannot cure cancer, at the most they may stop it,

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:13.140
they may try to reduce the possibilities and all that,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.170
but complete cure they cannot give,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.220
because they cannot extract people

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.000
from that area altogether.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.030
They can always be drawn into it,

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.130
if that area is made like this.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.000
It's very interesting to see

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.060
how these things are caused within us.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.130
This centre is one of the most important centre

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.220
because it gives us our seeking,

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:43.220
and our pure seeking should be for Spirit, for nothing else.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.230
But those people who go wrong,

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:52.080
all that you see in such people

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:56.000
who have bent their forehead before wrong people,

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:58.110
they develop a ridge on their head

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.030
and there are eleven centres here which just come up,

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.100
like a ridge.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.230
And these are the eleven centres called as

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:11.120
Ekadesha Rudras which are responsible for the destruction,

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:12.190
the ultimate destruction.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.100
The Kalki as called as, or what you call the Matreya

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:19.130
or the coming Christ

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.040
on the white horse.

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.150
That ridge once set in,

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.020
it starts developing more and more,

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.160
and destruction is near.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.210
I must say from the unconscious many people get ideas.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.150
I've seen people drawing or showing some pictures

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.050
where they show a very devilish person

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:44.020
with a horrible this thing coming out and a squarish thing.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:48.100
I don't know how they get these ideas, but that's a fact.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:55.040
Now the destructive forces are also on action.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.180
They are also working out their forces,

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.160
we have to be very careful, we are very precariously placed.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.180
Formerly if you had gone too much to the left and right,

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.070
you would have been not so badly off,

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.050
and people didn't care also so much.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:14.050
But today you are so precariously placed

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:18.080
and you are so sensitive and vulnerable

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.240
that you have to be extremely careful.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.100
The rate of destruction is set in very fast

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:30.190
and the rate of construction has to be set in much faster.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.160
If you see along - I mean, when I see, what is constructive?

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.240
Nothing.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.130
If you read in the newspaper morning till evening

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.000
one good news will come,

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.110
that the princess has delivered a beautiful boy.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.190
The rest is horrifying.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.190
You ask them to publish something nice,

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:51.190
I told them to publish about Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.040
they are not interested.

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:55.190
They are interested if there's a mishap, an accident,

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.130
some people died, some people killed,

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.100
they want to put all these photographs

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.160
of how the people were killed and what wars took place,

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.050
this and that.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.160
They have no time for some good news.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.240
Some good message, something of hope, they don't want it.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.240
That's how you see any organization

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.050
that is working out today,

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:22.050
how they are building up ego-oriented organization.

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:24.100
Every even charity organizations

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:27.170
are nothing but ego-oriented ones.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.170
I have, Myself, been with many organizations like that

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.100
and worked with them. I was amazed!

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.140
These people had no charity in them.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.160
Charity is something that should come as compassion,

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.190
should just flow from you,

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.200
but it is some sort of a camouflage

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:48.210
for earning better position or a better status,

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.080
and all nonsense going on.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.030
A person who is charitable is actually a person

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:58.050
who just flows.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.170
Who is the other to be charitable?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.140
If they are the part and parcel of Me,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
whom am I going to be charitable?

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.200
If this finger is paining,

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.120
am I going to be charitable to this finger?

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.200
I must look after it, jolly well, because it's paining Me;

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:18.060
I have to do rubbing of it, whatever is necessary,

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.150
I have to do it.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:22.010
And that's what people don't understand.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:29.110
All this kind of our facade will one day fall down,

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.230
and we'll find out that we have been wasting our energy

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:38.000
over something very, very trivial.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.180
Actually the all-pervading Power does everything.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:46.170
We do not do anything, believe Me, we do not do anything.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:52.090
How many flowers are turning into fruits just now?

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.170
Who is doing that job?

00:38:55.010 --> 00:39:00.010
How many seeds are sprouting at this moment, just now?

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.230
Who is doing all that?

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:08.010
How many children are born at this moment?

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:12.230
In the human body, no foreign matter can stay,

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.120
no foreign matter.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.200
It tries always to expel it,

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.200
but when it comes to fetus,

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:24.040
not that the body only keeps it there, but sustains it,

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.000
nurtures it, looks after it, makes it grow,

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:31.010
and when the right time’s come, it throws out.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.030
Who does that?

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.000
We take everything for granted.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.230
Take our eyes, if you are a doctor,

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:41.150
you can see what an intricate thing has been created as eyes,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.080
that we see people through these eyes.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.120
Who has done all that? Have we done it?

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.040
Can we make even one eye?

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.220
And then we see so many different type of eye.

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:56.120
This is the compassion of God, this is the power of God

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.000
that is all-pervading.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:01.140
First time when you get Realization, first time,

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.080
you feel that compassion,

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.150
you feel those vibrations,

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.030
you feel that all-pervading Power.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:15.170
You can now know that the all-pervading Power is there

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.150
and then you can see the maneuvering of it.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.110
You can work it out, you can work it out.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:24.090
Use it; you are the instrument, as I said.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.120
You are the master, only you have to become,

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.010
assume that power.

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.220
Warren, I hope, has told you how he came to Me.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:35.030
I don't know if he has told you,

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:37.140
he just came with a phone call.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:39.000
He had My phone number,

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.230
and the person who sent him gave a big idea about Me,

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.120
that “She’s not available,” this is that and all - all nonsense,

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.230
I'm the most available person.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:49.230
He just called Me, and I said “Come along.”

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.170
He came to My house and he got his realization.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:57.010
and now in Australia he's transformed so many people,

00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:01.000
we have ashrams in seven cities of Australia.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.150
England is the most lethargic, I must say.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.060
Seven cities of Australia are now there, ready to get it,

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.150
there are so many people working it out

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:16.220
because once you get the light, you give it to others.

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:24.080
So now we move to another centre above that,

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:28.150
is the centre of the Mother of the Universe.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:33.150
The father resides in this centre, previous centre,

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:38.000
the Nabhi Chakra and rises above and then settles down

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:41.170
onto the right side,

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.220
this is the fatherhood.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:48.040
Say a gentleman yesterday told Me that

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.120
he had trouble with his asthma.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:54.030
I don't know if he's come back or not, is he here?

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:58.190
Yes, good. Now, this gentleman has asthma.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.130
Of course I told him that he had trouble

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:04.100
because of too much bathing systems of India,

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.180
Indians you see, we bathe too much, apart from that

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.130
it comes from the father's grief.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.120
His father had died, and the father himself

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.020
is not willing to leave him, he is worried about him.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.010
It can happen to any one of us,

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.210
if a man is unkind to his son,

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:25.220
it's a father principle.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:30.190
If the son is unkind to the father, so the father is hurt.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:35.050
It's the father principle, if it is disturbed by any chance

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:40.050
or if suddenly father dies and you feel the pinch of that

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.130
all your life, all that can work out here,

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:46.070
and you get this right heart catch.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.210
With that you get asthma.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.050
It is said that in homeopathy

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:53.120
they believe that with more tension you get it,

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:55.080
because wheneverr we are more tensed, you see,

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.020
you remember your father.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.200
If he was here he would have helped you.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:01.010
In the subconscious sometimes it works out.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.090
And that’s how it adds to the problem.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:09.010
It is so simple to work out,

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.170
that you'd be amazed that if you have to just raise

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:16.140
the principle of father in a person like that -

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.110
who might be a dejected father,

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.040
who might be a cruel father,

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:24.010
who might be a son who has lost a father, can be anything,

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.110
that you have to just put your hand on that part,

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:35.110
and just say a mantra, a chanting

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.080
which will raise or which will awaken the fatherhood

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.140
in a full bloom, and you get cured,

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.190
it's very simple.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.220
The centre Heart is governed by the Mother of the Universe.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:53.160
She gives us the sense of security.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.210
When you are at the age of twelve years, you see,

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.190
the bone that is in front here

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:08.210
starts emitting antibodies,

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.210
it creates antibodies within

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.120
you till the age of twelve years

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:16.130
and then these antibodies are really the soldiers

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.160
of the Mother of the Universe.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.130
We call Her Jagadamba in Sanskrit language,

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:24.130
and they spread to the whole of the body

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.160
and wherever there is an attack,

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.080
they inform each other and they fight it out.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.240
These antibodies are created in the sternum bone

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:36.080
in the front side of the,

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:40.070
we can say, the ribs, where the ribs meet,

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.080
thoracic region, that part,

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:50.050
they stay there, are created till the age of twelve years.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.000
Now what happens in ladies specially,

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.120
they are the mothers also,

00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:00.090
when their motherhood is challenged, they get a problem.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.060
Like a woman, say her husband is a flirt,

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.110
he has a roving eyes sort of a thing, and she is insecure.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.010
Then this motherhood is challenged,

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:15.090
and when it is challenged, she gets a problem there,

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:20.220
and she gets, then she gets a disease of the breast,

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:22.120
breast cancer and all that

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:26.030
is caused by the insecurity of a woman.

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:30.160
If a woman is insecure, she may be with any reason insecure,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.160
she gets this breast cancer.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.020
There was a girl who was married,

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.220
she was married to a Catholic or someone like that,

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.160
and there was a inter-religion marriage,

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:48.190
and the people of the boy's side tried to trouble her a lot.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.190
It's very common in India, but here also I it see it is so.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:56.130
And they tried to sort of say these things to them,

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.230
that thing to her and to her parents and things like that,

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.050
and she developed this insecurity within her heart,

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.220
that she developed breast cancer.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.020
Now when we are cruel to others,

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.110
we don't know we are giving them cancers.

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:16.220
What does it take for us to be kind to a girl who's married

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.060
in our family, who has come to us?

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.240
We are experts in saying things that hurt others.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:27.140
We learn from childhood how to talk to people

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.130
so that they are really hurt.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.030
By hurting them, we give them cancers.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:38.060
But this only one realizes when you get your Realization.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.170
Then you really understand

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:44.000
that how much a person is suffering,

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:47.090
because you also feel a little pain there,

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:51.130
your whole style of talking, your whole style of behaviour,

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.140
of commuting with others completely changes.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.030
This centre is very important.

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:03.160
On the left hand side is the mother's side,

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.180
and the mother itself is - if the mother is a lunatic,

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:09.180
you get a problem there.

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.210
You might get it, we call it a Heart,

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.020
there are two Hearts,

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.130
one is the Heart of the Spirit and one is the Heart Chakra.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.160
If a mother is a fanatic,

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:22.130
she is a woman who is very fanatic about her food,

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:25.010
things like that, then the children get it.

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:28.020
It's a dangerous thing to play with children like that,

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.180
to have complete discipline on the children

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:33.220
and just keep them, "Must walk straight like a horse,

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:35.100
put two things that"

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:37.150
Children should be allowed to have their freedom.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.190
Actually when we suppress them too much,

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.210
they become hooligans. That way Indians are better,

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:44.100
they know how to bring up their children.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:47.130
They allow their children to have all the freedom.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.050
Just give them the idea of dignity,

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:53.100
and when the children are so free with the parents

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:56.050
in childhood, by the time they are about four or five

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:58.220
they become extremely dignified.

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.240
Like I see the children saying the words like,

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.100
"Get out, get away." From where do they learn these words?

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:09.070
They learn it from their parents, or learn it from friends,

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:11.040
or someone they must be learning,

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:14.120
because these words are normally not spoken by children.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.050
"Get lost." I've seen a little child saying that -

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:21.100
"Get lost." I mean it is too much to say to someone.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.240
But it happens like that,

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:26.040
because we do not understand

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.020
what we should talk before the children, how decently.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.120
We may be most indecent people, doesn't matter.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:33.150
We might be absolutely rotten people,

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.050
even a dacoit knows that he should behave properly

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:39.240
before his children, because children will become dacoits.

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:43.210
Even a prostitutes, even a prostitute will understand that

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.160
she should not behave in a manner

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.080
that the child takes to prostitution.

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:49.190
It's a common sense,

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.080
that whatever we do the children take so easily,

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:54.070
so whatever you want give them,

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.020
whatever you want to impart them,

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.220
that's how you should behave before them.

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:03.020
But now as the society is today, people are not paying

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.080
so much attention to their children, at all.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:09.180
They're so, I mean still the ladies are,

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:12.150
the mothers are still like brides,

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.240
you know busy finding new husbands.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.150
Husbands are still like bridegrooms, finding new wives,

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:21.150
and the children, poor things, don't know where to look.

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.180
God knows in what orphanage they have to end up their life.

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:26.180
Even the industry is like that,

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:30.010
I wanted to buy yesterday a pure cotton frock

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.100
for a little child, and couldn't find anywhere,

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:35.120
not one frock I could get in the whole of Derbyshire

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:37.220
and also in London for your information,

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:40.120
which was pure cotton.

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:42.190
I mean we don't think that children

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.040
can't bear this artificial manmade fiber.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.130
It's very dangerous, it's very bad for their skin.

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:49.210
When you were young you used cotton.

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:51.210
You had mills of cotton here.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:54.160
And why give this horrible stuff to your children,

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.090
which you never had?

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:58.050
By the time they grow up to your age

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:00.130
they will have all blotches on their faces. They'll be -

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:04.000
I don't know what diseases they may have on their skin.

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:07.130
No one realizes this is the kind of panties you are using,

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:09.100
the kind of things you are using for them,

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.220
it's very dangerous,

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:13.130
I don't know what's going to happen to them.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.040
The things they are using,

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:18.080
you never used them when you were young, believe Me,

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.180
and these are the times when they really require

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.130
complete attention, and these are the times

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:27.240
when they are absolutely tortured.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.240
Even the industry is not worried about them.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.220
Why not make some cotton clothes for little children?

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:35.180
Actually, I would say that the government

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:36.220
must pass a law that

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:39.130
"No children's clothes should be made

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:42.020
of any artificial things."

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.150
You can have the elders with that, it doesn't matter.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.240
But for the young children,

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.080
you can't give them atomic bombs to wear.

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:50.190
This is too much and these modern times

00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.210
I think are the cruellest for children,

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.070
that's why very few children want to be born

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:56.210
in these advanced countries.

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:59.210
We have to bear the load In India.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:02.140
If you are not kind to children

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.150
imagine, two children are killed by their parents,

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:06.150
what sort of a society we have?

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:08.140
Every week in London city itself

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.000
- I use to think in England,

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:12.030
but they told Me it's in London city

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.210
- two children are killed by the parents,

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:18.030
and I have not heard a single case like that in India.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:21.180
With this cruelty towards children,

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:24.000
I don't know what women are up to.

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:26.060
Where are they going to take their figures

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:30.090
and their beauties and everything in front of God?

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:36.190
Such cruelty exists, such self-centreedness,

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:39.060
then with all this the children develop

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.030
this struggle and they have palpitations, and

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.060
they have very weak hearts.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.090
They are in your trust,

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.140
God has given you

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:54.080
such beautiful children that you should thank Him for that.

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:58.060
They are not some surplus quantities have come to you;

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:01.090
it's a blessing to you that God has given you children.

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.000
If one woman in India doesn't get a child,

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.170
she will go and weep and ask every god

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:11.080
and every prophet and everyone that she should get a child.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.170
While in Germany it is going

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:16.090
toward minus five percent growth now.

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:19.050
They pay to a woman who has five children

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.220
as much as the Prime Minister or even more than that,

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.080
but she won't have, she' says, "I'll lose my figure."

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:26.050
Where are you going to take these figures

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:28.030
I don't understand.

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:29.220
What are these figures for

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.080
and who's interested in your figures?

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:37.140
Why, why, why should we make ourselves so cheap?

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.190
We are mothers and we should be proud of our motherhood.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:43.200
Motherhood is the highest thing a woman can achieve.

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:45.200
I mean, I have achieved it,

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:48.140
because I am a Mother for thousands.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.170
And I think that is the greatest thing

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.140
that can happen to a woman is to be a mother.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:56.130
And Mother and a Guru, you can imagine My plight?

00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:00.020
It's much worse that you have to tell your children

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:03.020
something to be done, and you love them so much

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:04.190
that you don't want to say that,

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:07.030
then you have to play some little sweet tricks

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:09.060
with them to bring them round.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.110
It is such an interesting and a beautiful life

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:14.130
to be a mother, we should be proud mothers.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.020
But I would say the men too are to be blamed,

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.030
because they are not interested in mothers,

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:21.080
they are interested in younger and younger girls

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.110
- is a sign of perversion I tell you,

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:26.140
it is a sign of a complete perversion.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.220
At the time of Mohammed Sahib there were many,

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:33.170
many women and very few men because so many were killed,

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:36.140
so Mohammed Sahib didn't know what to do.

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.200
So He thought - they were pragmatic,

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:40.130
as I told you yesterday that with the society

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:42.080
one has be pragmatic - so He said, "All right,

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.140
we have to have marriages," because

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:49.080
without marriage any relationship of any kind is adharmic,

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.020
is against the valencies.

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:54.000
So He said, "We must have marriage.

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.110
All right, now we have many women

00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:58.240
so let us have distribution of women

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:00.140
according to the men we have.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:03.160
If you have more men then we'll have the other way around.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.020
But we have to marry,"

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:09.000
means we have to take a collective sanction,

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:13.020
a collective sanction has to be there, to be blessed.

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.130
So He said, "All right, marry five.”

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:18.100
But He, Himself, you see, was surprised,

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.010
at time people were so sensitive,

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:21.090
they would not marry young girls,

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:23.010
the old men would not marry young girls.

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:25.200
They said, "How can we marry these young girls?" you see.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.230
So He said, "No, all right, I'll marry one,

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:29.150
because where will these young girls go,

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:31.070
there are no young men left, so what to do?"

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:34.150
But these days, if you ask an old man of eighty years,

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:38.150
he would be very willing to marry a girl of eighteen years.

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.230
Stupid old fool I call him, because he doesn't understand.

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:45.240
He doesn't understand that this girl

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:48.070
is not going to respect him as a husband

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.150
and he cannot enjoy the life of a husband.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:53.210
He's a grandfather, or call it a great grandfather,

00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:56.040
he should behave like a great grandfather;

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:57.230
that's an ideal relationship

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.150
he should have with a young girl.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.040
All these ideals are confused today,

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:05.230
our relationships with others.

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:09.100
Every woman has to be attractive, why?

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.160
Every man has to be attractive, why?

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:14.120
For what? What are you going to achieve out of it?

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:17.230
What is the utility?

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:20.150
Attractiveness is all right

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:24.100
as long as you are not repulsive,

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:29.090
as long as you keep the ideal relationship with others,

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:32.150
if the relationship becomes nothing but like a dog

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.020
and bitch's one,

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:37.100
it's better not to have this kind of an idea,

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:41.070
it's absolutely wrong to run after something

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:42.180
which is not our way.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.050
Human beings have to live with dignity

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:48.140
and with complete sense of idealism

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.200
as far as their relationship

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:55.040
with each other is concerned.

00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:58.070
If you just say, "What's wrong?"

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:01.180
then it's an argument, everything is wrong,

00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:02.230
and everything is wrong,

00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:06.090
it is not one wrong but all, everything is wrong.

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:10.150
But if you want to have a flowering society,

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:13.230
then you must keep to your ideals of your family life,

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.120
that's a very important thing,

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:18.030
but it happens to you as soon as you get Realization.

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:21.210
I don't have to give a lecture on that. You just do it.

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.240
You just become very nice husband

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:28.010
and a very nice wife.

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.000
Beautiful families can come out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.170
there are so many, you'll see them.

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:38.230
There are so many beautiful families now in Sahaja Yoga

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:41.170
and now the great children,

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.200
the great sages who wanted to be born

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:46.150
are being born to them.

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:49.090
Many great children want to be born in this England.

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:51.100
And there are many who are born,

00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:53.060
but I don't know how they are treated,

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.150
if people understand them or not.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:57.040
They have no vibrations to see if they are sages or not.

00:56:57.150 --> 00:57:01.090
But born realized children are so many in England,

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:07.120
that I'm regretting sometimes the way they are treated.

00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:11.180
Nobody knows they are born realized - the way they talk,

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.140
they talk nothing but wisdom.

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:18.100
All these children are being insulted and humiliated

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.180
by us who are so ignorant about them.

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:24.010
I must say that they are very brave,

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:26.080
they're very courageous to take birth

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:28.150
in the countries where they are not appreciated

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.060
and looked after.

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.140
Another extreme is in our country,

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:36.060
I should say, where people will sell their whole country

00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:38.030
for the sake of their children.

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:40.190
I mean, that's going too far,

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.110
that's another nonsense we do.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.200
But something in between is that you love your children,

00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:50.090
respect them; they are your trust, they are realized souls,

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:52.060
they are sages.

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:55.010
They are the foundations of the new world

00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:56.170
that is going to come,

00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:59.200
and this is what it is a mother has to learn.

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.230
The dignity of a mother must be respected.

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:06.030
I'm sure you all must have respected your mothers very much.

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:10.150
But now as mothers I don't know if you will be respected.

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.030
Once this is established,

00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:19.140
that a mother itself is the highest position a woman

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.200
can reach and she is to be respected,

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.180
all the priorities will change among women also.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.120
Because what can they do?

00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.060
They have no place as mothers,

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:30.180
so they just get fed up of their children, they think,

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:33.160
"What's the use of this motherhood? It's a thankless job."

00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:39.070
All this can only change when man changes within himself,

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:41.060
when the transformation takes place.

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:43.210
Just now it is just a, one of the sermons

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:46.240
that you could hear somewhere in a very,

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:50.040
I should say, an orthodox place.

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:54.100
But the whole of this orthodoxy becomes part and parcel

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:57.050
of you and you become so much tuned with it,

00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:59.140
absolutely tuned with it. You like it.

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:03.050
You like to love your wife and nobody else in that way.

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:08.180
And the husband likes to love her in a special way,

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.190
while the wife wants to love the husband in a special way.

00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:15.060
It happens. There's no insecurity.

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.230
Otherwise, you come back home and you find your wife

00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:18.090
has eloped with somebody -

00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:20.120
imagine what a situation it is.

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:24.020
I mean, since I came and first year I got such a shock.

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:26.170
We had a neighbor she was forty-eight years of age

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
and her son was about twenty-two

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.200
and he had a friend about twenty years.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.110
This lady eloped with that twenty-year-old boy,

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:36.210
and she had three other children whom she left.

00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:39.210
The house was sold, the whole household,

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.160
because under law she gets half,

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:44.100
half of the property or something like that,

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.000
and the three daughters are now on the streets,

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.080
the younger three children were daughters are on the street,

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.110
who is going to look after them?

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:52.080
The lady, forty-eight-year-old lady,

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:54.050
is still a bride, do you know?

00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:57.020
Going to the church and getting married.

00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.190
There's no dignity in this, no love, no affection.

01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:06.160
Christ you follow, Christ has said,

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:11.030
"You say 'Thou shall not commit adultery,' I say,

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:14.220
'Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.'"

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.140
He's gone up to that subtle stage.

01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:23.100
We follow Christ, we wear cross, we go to the church.

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:24.240
Where are we?

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:29.050
So I come to another centre now, is the Vishuddhi.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:32.050
This is a very important centre in human beings,

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:35.160
because when this centre is awakened

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.030
you become the witness.

01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:41.050
You become the collective.

01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:44.020
This is the centre of the collective being.

01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:47.120
You become, again I say, you become the collective being,

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.170
when this centre is awakened.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.160
Is a very important centre,

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.210
and now as I'm with you I must tell about

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.160
what we suffer from and what Indians suffer from,

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:01.020
what the Eastern people suffer from is another thing.

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:04.070
For example, Eastern people suffer from too much talking

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:06.050
- right side Vishuddhi we call it -

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:08.210
and the western suffer from not talking at all;

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.040
specially English, they never talk.

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:15.190
Actually you have to pinch them!

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.200
And they never laugh, that's the problem is, they

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:22.170
just smile and is regarded good manners,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.120
but this bit sometimes very boring.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.030
Now the Left Vishuddhi is a thing

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.010
which is very much, much more subtler than what we think of,

01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:36.190
is a very funny sort of a situation

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:38.140
where you get a Left Vishuddhi

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.150
and that you get very commonly among the western people,

01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:47.010
because they have developed a new sense of guilt.

01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:50.090
I mean everybody is guilty.

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:53.030
Without going to the courts, without committing any guilt,

01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:56.000
everybody is guilty all the time.

01:01:56.110 --> 01:01:59.090
Like a lady, "Oh, I'm so guilty."

01:01:59.170 --> 01:02:00.150
"What happened?"

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.050
"I didn't say 'thank you' to her."

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.060
So it doesn't matter. What is there to be guilty after all?

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.050
"Oh I'm so guilty."

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.080
"What happened?"

01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:11.110
"I spilt some coffee." So all right, doesn't matter,

01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:13.190
it can be cleared out, what is there to be guilty?

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.040
But it is an unknown guilt people have,

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.200
they don't know why they are guilty,

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.070
why they are getting all the time this feeling.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.240
"Oh God, I should not have done it,

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.040
I should not have done that." What guilt?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.020
What guilt we can have?

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:33.000
And this guilt is a horrifying thing.

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:37.190
I have seen - start from America,

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.160
England, Portugal, Spain,

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.200
Italy, all that, Switzerland,

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:48.060
all these places nothing - but Left Vishuddhi

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.030
is the first problem and the last which I have to conquer.

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.220
One lady got up and she said,

01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:56.080
"Mother I am guilty because of Vietnam."

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.020
I said, "Vietnam? It is finished long time back now,

01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:00.160
what are you going to do about it?"

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:03.070
No, but I'm guilty about it." "But why?

01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:06.060
What are you going to do about it, how are you concerned with it,

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:09.240
what is your relationship with it, why are you guilty?"

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:11.130
"I just feel guilty."

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:13.230
I said, "It's nonsense."

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:16.240
Like that everybody has developed this thing.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.180
Now from where does it come?

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:23.210
Let's see the source. The first source comes from Bible,

01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:26.240
which is very wrongly interpreted, saying that,

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:28.180
"You are a sinner, a born sinner."

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.060
I mean its absurd. What it means is that,

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:36.120
that you are the one who is only aware of the sins,

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.070
not the animals.

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:41.180
You are the one who is aware of your ignorance,

01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:43.060
not the animals.

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:46.000
You are the one who is aware of your blindness,

01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:47.240
others are not, animals are not.

01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:50.060
Why?

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:55.070
Because within you is developed that I-ness,

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.120
that I-ness as I told you yesterday

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.060
is developed because of the ego and the super ego meeting here.

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.000
Because you raised your head,

01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:06.010
because this chakra was to be enlightened.

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:11.170
You raised your head and this ego and super ego

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:14.030
went and met here, it calcified,

01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:17.010
you got your I-ness and that's why you think,

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:19.000
"I've done wrong or I've done right."

01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:21.180
Animals don't think like that, they are not bothered.

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.090
They have to do what they do, they want to do that.

01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:26.170
they never sit down and say, "I am guilty."

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.230
Have you ever met any animal who says that? -

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.140
except for the human beings, all the time.

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:36.000
Now this has come to, it's a myth,

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.140
it is a very big myth with which you are living.

01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:41.220
It’s absolutely myth, believe Me;

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.030
there is nothing like guilt.

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.140
And this guilt is eating you off all the time,

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:50.050
it's making you an inertia,

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:53.220
it is making you feel so much lost,

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:57.150
and this centre is very important

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.020
to be opened out.

01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:03.100
So first of all before I start any program, I tell them

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.190
one mantra you should say, "Mother I am not guilty,

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.210
Mother I am not guilty," sixteen times,

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.010
that's the punishment for being guilty.

01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:12.230
If you are guilty you must go into punishment, all right?

01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:14.120
So this is the punishment for you,

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:17.020
is to say, "Mother I am not guilty, Mother I am not guilty."

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:20.020
Say it sixteen times, and that's how you get rid of it.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.240
It's so practical, it works out.

01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:26.050
With that you get spondylitis, you get pain in the heart,

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:28.230
you get this hand what you call frigid hand,

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:31.090
all problems you get with that,

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.110
and that is all because of this mythical guilt

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:35.190
you are working out.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.170
Now the another myth comes,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.240
the source of it I think is the psychologist,

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.220
the so-called psychologist.

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:44.210
They have no sense of psyche,

01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:47.060
because they have no way of entering into psyche,

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.080
what they are doing is recording, finding out,

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.210
and trying to cure people.

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:54.100
How many mad people have they cured?

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.060
Sahaja Yoga must have cured hundreds.

01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.130
How many mad people have they cured?

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.240
They have not cured anyone.

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.050
On the contrary, if you go to a psychologist,

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:07.030
you might become more mad, the way they are mad themselves;

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:12.030
because these psychologists, when they talk to people,

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:15.050
they don't know they are dealing with pathological cases,

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.020
abnormal cases.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:19.100
And when you deal with the pathological cases,

01:06:19.170 --> 01:06:23.050
you yourself get intoxicated by that,

01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:26.140
or you can say that there is contamination.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.160
And you don't know how to protect yourself.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.220
Jung is the only psychologist, I would say,

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.240
because he was quite a prophet/perfect person,

01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:36.020
after he got realization, who talked of it,

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.020
that a physician can get sick.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.100
Now, they start becoming pathological

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.120
like poor this Freud, half-baked.

01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:48.050
He is the one who started talking about sex

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:51.100
and things like that, but he himself was a perverted man.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.060
He died of cancer, what did he get in his own life?

01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:55.180
He was such a perverted man.

01:06:56.010 --> 01:07:00.020
I mean, imagine, he was a wretched soul who died of cancer.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.040
How can he guide anyone on, any point whatsoever?

01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:06.180
Now whatever he talked we took him as Bible,

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.070
more than Bible, people believe in Freud.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.040
More than Christ. they believe in him actually,

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.240
and if you reduce it

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:19.130
to a minimum sentence you can say he made

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:21.210
everyone a sex point.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.090
You are nothing beyond it, nothing more than that,

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.100
nothing else but that.

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:31.060
Imagine, to reduce your dignity to that level!

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:36.210
It’s as a Mother I just give him a grace mark by saying

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.100
poor fellow must have dealt with pathological cases,

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.190
and he was caught up and he gave these wrong ideas to people.

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:44.080
He dealt only with the psyche,

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:48.050
with the left side which is also starting from there,

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:50.130
but ends up there,

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:54.200
ends up into your super ego.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:59.100
So sex addiction takes you to super ego,

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:02.120
means it takes you to your subconscious mind

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.100
and to your collective subconscious.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.120
Now all your problems you are having by sex

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.210
are because of this.

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:12.230
Emotional behaviour and all perversions

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.020
take you to collective subconscious.

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:18.230
There was a girl in India, which is very abnormal,

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:22.100
she came to Me and she said that she wants to be

01:08:22.170 --> 01:08:27.210
with girls and she wants to marry a girl,

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:30.060
she wants to dress up like a man.

01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:32.040
I said to her, "Really?"

01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:37.010
So I gave her some Sahaja Yoga treatment

01:08:37.090 --> 01:08:41.020
and I found that there was a man in her.

01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:43.160
She was reduced to nothing,

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.020
this was a man who was possessing her,

01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:50.200
and she was given these ideas through that man,

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.060
and that's was how she was talking,

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:53.160
she was a possessed person.

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:56.240
All these abnormalities come because you get possessed.

01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:59.240
There was a girl in Cuba who came to see Me.

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:03.140
From Cuba, in America, a short girl, very petite,

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:06.170
small, good looking girl and she told Me,

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:09.140
her husband told Me, "Mother, it's surprising,

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:13.140
my wife can take whiskey bottle neat like that one,

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:15.050
she can drink it down." So I said,

01:09:15.130 --> 01:09:18.200
"All right sit down." I gave her a bhandan as we call it,

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.160
and I saw a big, huge

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:25.060
like a globe - trotter

01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:29.160
really a very huge negro coming out of her,

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.220
and I looked at her. I said, "Do you know any negro?"

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.170
She said, "Mother, do You see him? Do You see him?

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:39.030
He is the one who drinks, I do not drink,"

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.130
she said to Me.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.230
And when he was distracted from her,

01:09:44.050 --> 01:09:46.090
she became such a sweet wife to her husband.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:51.200
All these abnormal behaviors when you overdo it,

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:54.090
lead us to that collective subconscious,

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.210
where you catch all these horrible people.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:00.090
Also it can lead you to collective supraconscious

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.230
if you become very, very egoistical.

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:06.100
Then you can become Hitler.

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:10.130
"What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong with Hitler?"

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.070
Nothing wrong, he was perfectly correct

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:16.230
when he said that he has come to save all the Aryan race

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.130
and his nose was a specially made one.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.200
I mean God must have been surprised to hear all that,

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.090
I mean you have to create some variety, isn't it?

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:28.210
But this is what it is,

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.230
I mean these absurd things that we do in our life as saying,

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.180
"What's wrong?" We jump into those ditches

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.160
where you cannot return without some load on your head,

01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:42.040
and those loads work out all the things,

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:43.180
and you become such abnormal people.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.130
Then on the street you'll stand and shout like a madman,

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.240
and if you provoke them they are even worse,

01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:53.100
so better not talk with them and argue with them.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.000
Forget them. All those fanatics that we see are nothing

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.030
but possessed people.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.180
Most of them are possessed.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.170
I would say so many of presidents and these despotic people,

01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:11.010
most of them are possessed. I meet them,

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:13.110
I shake hands with them, they shake before Me

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.080
and I know that they are possessed people,

01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:18.010
how are they there?

01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:19.230
They should not be there, they are possessed,

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.230
they possess other people, they make them work out

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.040
and all this aggressiveness starts

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:27.090
through their possessive powers.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:34.130
So this centre is the one which brings you back to normal,

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:39.220
and then once the Kundalini rises and touches

01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:45.160
your fontanel bone area and opens it out,

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.170
then from your hand through this centre,

01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:56.060
that collective personality starts manifesting.

01:11:56.170 --> 01:11:59.200
You become the collective personality, you become.

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:02.000
Again I say it’s the actualization,

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:05.000
it is not that "We are brothers and sisters

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.130
let us form United Nations and make good money out of it."

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.170
It is actualization that

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.060
you feel another person within yourself

01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:22.060
and this is what is most important.

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:26.180
This centre, I mean I can talk about this

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.000
I don't know how many hours but,

01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:31.110
this centre has sixteen subplexes

01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:35.070
and it looks after your eyes, nose, ear, nose, throat

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:37.110
- everything, neck,

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.220
even your face and all that, is governed by this.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.170
A collective person,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
a collective being has a face

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:49.110
which has a coefficients that even the face

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:51.230
can emit vibrations,

01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:56.220
but this is to be seen only through vibrations,

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.220
you will know who is the collective being.

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:04.150
The most important is this part of the head

01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:08.140
where I told you that when you bow yourself to wrong things

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.180
this is the biggest obstruction,

01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:15.120
is the lower plate of the brain

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:18.120
which is called as Murdha in Sanskrit language.

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:20.220
It is very important, it gets swollen up

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.110
and a big barrier is built

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:26.200
and you become a person completely cut off

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.150
from the all-pervading Power.

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:31.140
Means all the protections, all the guidance,

01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:34.170
all the nurturing things, everything

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.090
starts disappearing from your life.

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:44.070
Now we go ahead with that centre to the centre here,

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:46.190
which is very important and which I must tell you, though,

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:50.020
it's time to finish this lecture,

01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:55.060
is the centre of Agnya

01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:58.140
which is placed in the

01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:03.030
centre of pituitary and pineal body

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.080
which controls our ego and superego,

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.230
between the optic chiasma, a very subtle centre exists.

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.110
Some people call it a third eye

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.050
but the third eye they see is not the one I am talking about.

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:21.060
The third eye means the eye we see it inside not outside.

01:14:22.230 --> 01:14:26.060
This centre is very important

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:30.140
and is adorned by the deity

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.160
of Mahavishnu according to Indian name

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:44.100
and English name is Lord Jesus Christ.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.220
This is a very important centre.

01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:49.100
"Now seek your Lord."

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:51.240
Where do you seek Him? Where does He exist?

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.210
He's to be awakened and He resides here

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.120
because most of you are coming from that background

01:14:58.190 --> 01:14:59.190
I want to talk about it,

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:02.100
though Mahavira and Mahabuddha

01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:05.010
both of them also reside within us:

01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:09.040
Mahavira resides here and Buddha resides here.

01:15:09.150 --> 01:15:14.230
But Christ resides here in the centre, inside the brain.

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:19.210
Now this is a very important thing

01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:22.090
which all the Christian institutions

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:25.020
have missed about Christ.

01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:28.150
That Christ is to be born within us.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.180
That He's to be awakened within us.

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:35.070
That is only done through Kundalini awakening

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:39.040
and once He's awakened, at that point,

01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:42.130
ego and superego both are sucked by Him,

01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:44.100
as a result of His awakening

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:46.190
and this is a very big thing.

01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:49.200
That's why He said, "I am the door."

01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:52.090
But very nice, they crucified Him.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.230
But that crucifixion was also a drama,

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:59.230
because ego and superego has pressed this point so hard,

01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:03.010
that to pass through that you needed somebody

01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:06.230
to be just divine, and He was Omkara Himself,

01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:08.100
the divine personality

01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:12.040
Who never died and passed through that.

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:16.040
Krishna has said, Who is at this point,

01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:17.120
has said that “Nayanam chidanti shastrani,

01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:20.150
nayanam dahati pavaka.” He said,

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.130
"This divine power, this Omkara,

01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:30.090
never can be killed by anyone,

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:33.080
it cannot be destroyed by anyone,"

01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:40.160
and this itself took the birth of Jesus Christ.

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:43.200
To create that passage for us.

01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:50.090
And that is the thing He proved, that it cannot be killed.

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:53.080
But They are all One and related to each other.

01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:55.220
This you'll discover in Sahaja Yoga itself

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.140
because when the rapport is established,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.110
you have to ask questions.

01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:04.190
What is the relationship between Jesus and Krishna?

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.140
And you can discover it on vibrations:

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:11.090
They are all related to each other, very closely.

01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:14.170
Christ has said, "Those who are not against Me are with Me."

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:17.110
Nobody has tried to find out who are those.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.060
It is said in the Bible that

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:21.080
"I'll appear before you like tongues of flames."

01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:24.110
Nobody tried to find out what is that, or Tree of Life -

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:27.030
is this the Tree of Life.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.220
So He is to be awakened within you,

01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:32.210
that's the main point that He said that

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:36.070
"Somebody will come and awaken it,

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.080
so that you will know My Father forever."

01:17:39.190 --> 01:17:41.130
Now which one of the institutions

01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:45.020
which are running in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.080
are doing that job?

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:48.210
What they are doing is having a fete, or a carnival,

01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:51.220
collecting money, building churches, this, that.

01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:54.140
You have to build every human being as a church

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:57.210
by awakening Christ in them.

01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:01.050
That was what was meant by baptism.

01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:03.220
But whom did baptism in the real sense

01:18:04.050 --> 01:18:06.210
is the Kundalini awakening when it comes

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:10.170
on the fontanel bone area which is called

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.190
as the brahmarandhra, and breaks through that.

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:18.020
Who has done that? None.

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:21.050
I went to a church called Unity Church,

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:23.140
they have united all the churches I believe

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:26.030
and also united all the ghosts of the world.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:29.090
All kinds of fake gurus are there, all kinds,

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:32.140
they have no discrimination of any kind.

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:37.230
I am so amazed, you know. Christ,

01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:41.000
He was not so diplomatic I should say

01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:44.090
because the way He lashed at these people and then He said,

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.200
"If they are hot, we can manage them" -

01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:48.160
means “if they are hot” means they're caught up,

01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:51.190
we'll manage them: if they are cold, we like them;

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:56.030
but if they are half-way, "I spit them out of My mouth."

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.170
These are His words.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.110
Because these half-baked people compromising with the devil,

01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:04.170
and talking of God.

01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:07.130
How are they going to deliver the goods?

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.160
Why not awaken your Christ within yourself

01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.090
and see for yourself?

01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:15.160
You'll be amazed when you raise the Kundalini

01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:17.120
and Kundalini comes up to this point

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.140
and it cannot go further,

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.140
among all the Christians this is a problem.

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:24.170
You have to ask them to say Lord's Prayer, and it works,

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.110
that's a mantra.

01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:32.020
At the time when your, this centre is catching,

01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:36.060
because Krishna is a Collective Being,

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.200
"Allah hu Akbar" means the same.

01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:41.060
You have to put your fingers into your ears and say,

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:44.070
"Allah hu Akbar" realized souls,

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.180
and you'll get the kundalini rising.

01:19:47.010 --> 01:19:48.180
You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:49.230
at the triangular bone,

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.110
you can see the rising of the Kundalini,

01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:55.200
you can feel the breaking of Kundalini at the Sahasrara

01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:58.180
at the point where it comes and breaks it.

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:02.060
So you enter through the gate of Christ

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:05.010
who sucks these two institutions

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.090
and makes the way here,

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:10.130
and once the Kundalini rises above the Agnya,

01:20:10.190 --> 01:20:11.220
you become thoughtless.

01:20:12.090 --> 01:20:17.040
The limbic area is the Kingdom of God

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:21.200
from where you are guided and the Kundalini passes through.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.030
That's the last job that is to be done,

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:26.220
and now it is done.

01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:29.190
That is done now en masse.

01:20:30.010 --> 01:20:32.140
It has to be done, it was to be done,

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:35.200
it was promised, the time has come.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:39.210
But where are the people, sometimes I wonder?

01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:42.160
I am in England now with you;

01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:47.160
you'll be amazed that in India, these people have seen,

01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:51.210
thousands and thousands are there to receive Realization

01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:53.060
in the villages.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:56.240
Here I find people don't want reality,

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.220
you should have a circus.

01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:02.040
At least English people come but Indians very few

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.210
and they never stick on.

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:06.240
It’s so amazing that I can't understand.

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:10.050
It's amazing how things work out.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:14.130
When are we going to take to it?

01:21:14.210 --> 01:21:18.010
I mean it's free, you don't have to pay anything,

01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:20.240
it's your own, it is spontaneous, it is there.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:25.050
But still, they get Realization, they get lost.

01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:27.040
It's something so surprising,

01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:30.120
I've been working here, you won't believe, ten years now,

01:21:30.190 --> 01:21:32.040
eight years, eight years.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.030
For four years, in the first four years I had six people,

01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:40.020
they would come up, go down, come up, go down.

01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:42.110
I said, "What sort of people?"

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.120
Four years, can you imagine?

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:49.170
In India, I go for three months and I get thousands.

01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:53.170
Is it that there are very few who are going to be saved,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.030
as told by John?

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:58.030
He said only a few thousand are going to be saved,

01:21:58.110 --> 01:22:01.110
is that what we are going to do in the West?

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.190
But England is the minimum,

01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:06.240
you'll be amazed even Italy is better,

01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:11.050
Switzerland, Geneva, so much better, what's happening?

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:16.090
Here they run after a man who is asking for a Rolls Royce,

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.050
a fellow who asks for a 59-th Rolls Royce,

01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:21.020
they starve themselves

01:22:21.090 --> 01:22:23.170
and made a Rolls Royce for him and when he came,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.140
they gave him the Rolls Royce, imagine?

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.220
They said he's a perfect master.

01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:30.080
There is no pure intelligence left in the mind

01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:32.240
to understand that how can you get Spirit

01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:35.170
for this nonsensical Rolls Royce?

01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:39.060
At least Derbyshire are not, people from Derbyshire

01:22:39.130 --> 01:22:41.190
should not be impressed by that very much,

01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:44.140
because they make it here.

01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:48.060
You cannot make God, can you?

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.000
You can make Rolls Royces, all right,

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:53.240
can you exchange Rolls Royce for God?

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.130
They are running after such horrible things,

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.140
like horrible another thing that somebody

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.100
is trying to teach you how to fly.

01:23:00.190 --> 01:23:02.130
The wife of the director is sitting here

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:04.200
who started is suffering with epilepsy -

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.030
her husband got epilepsy, her daughter got epilepsy,

01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:08.170
they all were epileptic,

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.240
and they were paying thousands of pounds,

01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:13.080
three thousand pounds to fly,

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:18.130
and they starting hopping themselves like a frog. Imagine!

01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:21.130
With pure intelligence you must ask

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:25.200
that guru to drop himself from the leaning Tower of Pisa,

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:27.190
I think it was made only for that,

01:23:28.050 --> 01:23:32.240
and see if he can fly even one inch higher.

01:23:33.210 --> 01:23:35.170
Why not use your intelligence?

01:23:35.230 --> 01:23:37.180
You are supposed to be most balanced

01:23:38.010 --> 01:23:40.010
and intelligent people.

01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:44.000
Yesterday I told you that you are placed,

01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:48.160
the most important place in the Universe is the Heart,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.070
England is the Heart of the Universe

01:23:51.170 --> 01:23:54.220
and the Heart is lethargic.

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:57.050
What can I do?

01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:59.130
You have to tell Me, what am I to do,

01:23:59.210 --> 01:24:02.180
to pump this Heart into reality.

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:05.020
There are seekers, I would not say there are seekers,

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:08.240
When it came to hippieism, thousands became hippies.

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.210
But all absurd things they accept very easily

01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:15.110
and why not the thing that you are seeking?

01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:18.160
It's beyond My mind. I cannot understand.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.020
Now I didn't come to this place as an immigrant, as I told

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:25.050
you. I was, just came, I came here because something happened

01:24:25.130 --> 01:24:27.140
and My husband got elected to this country,

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.190
which was important, which was,

01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:32.240
I think, was pre-ordained. It was to be.

01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:37.220
But I have to implore you now to take to this and understand

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.160
that this is what William Blake has told you

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:46.190
that "The prophets are going to be in this country,

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.200
that the God of men are going to become prophets

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.170
and they are going to have the power

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.000
to make others prophets." That is Sahaja Yoga.

01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:56.240
There's nothing else but this.

01:24:58.150 --> 01:25:00.000
He has promised so many things.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.050
He has even described the house where I live,

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:06.000
he has described the house that we are occupying now,

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.170
exact position.

01:25:07.230 --> 01:25:11.230
He has described the ashram where we'll lay our foundations,

01:25:12.230 --> 01:25:18.120
into such details that I'm amazed such a great sage

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.140
and a seer was born in this great country

01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:24.060
and nobody wants to see it through. Now what am I to do?

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:31.110
I hope very soon people would realize

01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:35.200
that they have to take a very big role,

01:25:36.090 --> 01:25:39.110
a very important and vital role

01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:42.060
in the transformation of the whole humanity

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.060
and saving of this disastrous time.

01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:48.230
They are the ones who have to lead people

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:51.090
into the Kingdom of God.

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:54.020
I can hope and bless that.

01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:57.170
May God bless you!

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:07.180
Luckily we have a very good standard

01:26:08.110 --> 01:26:10.150
of the Sahaja Yogis in Derbyshire,

01:26:11.010 --> 01:26:12.180
really it's surprising

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.240
and Blake has mentioned Derbyshire very much,

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.010
they wanted Me to come to Derbyshire.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.050
I said, "Birmingham has been sufficient for Me

01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:22.120
and I am not going to Derbyshire."

01:26:22.190 --> 01:26:24.010
And they said, "Mother, please." And then he said,

01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:26.080
"Blake has mentioned You come to Derbyshire."

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:27.200
And that's how I am here

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:32.090
and I hope that this centre will definitely create

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:34.120
very good Sahaja Yogis.

01:26:34.230 --> 01:26:38.230
Great prophets can be created out of this,

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:42.100
after all Blake has mentioned Derbyshire very strongly,

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.170
he recommended it.

01:26:43.230 --> 01:26:46.060
But what I find today when I went for a drive,

01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:48.100
there's a lot of black magic on.

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:52.210
People are indulging into horrible, horrible things.

01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:56.150
I was worried, quite worried.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.030
It's a very dangerous thing.

01:26:59.210 --> 01:27:01.230
It's dangerous for you, for your children,

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.120
for your families, for everyone,

01:27:04.210 --> 01:27:06.170
and I found those pockets,

01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:09.210
I was amazed how they are prospering here.

01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:15.140
May God give you strength and proper wisdom

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:20.000
to understand how you are placed in relation

01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:23.100
to the great work of God.

01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:32.040
Now if you have any questions,

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:33.120
we can have for about for five minutes,

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.060
yesterday many people asked many questions,

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:38.040
actually first day only I allow people to ask questions

01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:40.090
because second day it is quite a waste of time.

01:27:40.150 --> 01:27:42.230
Now don't ask personal questions for heaven's sake,

01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:44.210
don't ask any personal question.

01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:47.170
That we'll attend to them later on, personally,

01:27:48.010 --> 01:27:49.040
they can be attended to;

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.240
but anything general if you want to ask,

01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:53.210
please ask the question general.

01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:08.200
Audience question: Have You seen God Yourself?

01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.060
Why do you ask this question?

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.110
Are you authorized to ask that question?

01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:15.200
First you see your Spirit and then we'll talk about it.

01:28:16.050 --> 01:28:17.110
Why should you ask such a question?

01:28:17.170 --> 01:28:20.230
Are you an Indian? Then at least keep some manners.

01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.110
Please be seated.

01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.230
This kind of an arrogant question should not be asked,

01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:27.030
"Have You seen God?"

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:28.230
Why should you ask Me such a question?

01:28:29.050 --> 01:28:31.170
What authority have you got to ask that question to Me?

01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:34.110
I have to ask you question: have you felt your Spirit?

01:28:34.190 --> 01:28:36.050
All right, first feel your Spirit,

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.110
that's why Buddha never talked of God,

01:28:38.190 --> 01:28:39.220
I yesterday only told you;

01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:42.020
because suddenly you want to see God -

01:28:42.090 --> 01:28:43.120
have you got eyes to see God?

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.110
You can't see Me even, how can you see God?

01:28:50.190 --> 01:28:54.000
First of all become your Spirit, then we'll talk about it.

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:56.020
A little child won't go

01:28:56.090 --> 01:29:01.080
and talk to a king and slap him on the face, will he?

01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:03.220
Is he supposed to do that?

01:29:04.090 --> 01:29:06.200
We must know our boundaries, our maryadas.

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:10.200
Specially Indians must know, I'm surprised sometimes.

01:29:11.130 --> 01:29:12.200
To ask such a question like that:

01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:15.020
"Have you seen God?" Whether I've seen Him or not,

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:17.080
why should I tell you? But what does he say?...

01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:25.170
Doesn't behoove, doesn't behoove you. It is very arrogant.

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:28.070
I am surprised that you've learned such ways here,

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:32.230
it is never done by an Indian, it's very embarrassing.

01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:36.090
Just imagine, if I have seen it,

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:38.020
is he going to believe Me? -

01:29:38.150 --> 01:29:41.010
or not seen it (Hindi).

01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:52.180
...All this come and come somethimes I feel.

01:29:56.190 --> 01:30:00.100
I mean, what a question it is, “Have You seen or not?”

01:30:21.190 --> 01:30:25.070
But he's a Master of Philosophy from Benares University,

01:30:25.130 --> 01:30:27.170
and all that, but in India you won't find such people,

01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:30.030
I don't know from where these materialistic,

01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:32.090
absolutely gross people are,

01:30:32.170 --> 01:30:34.160
I mean what a question to ask Me?

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:42.030
It's never done.

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.190
I'm here to give you Self Realization, that's all.

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:55.080
And you should get it, that's your right.

01:30:56.050 --> 01:30:57.230
This is a bank I should say

01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:00.230
and I have to sign your checks, that's all.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:05.220
If you get your checks signed, that's all,

01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:07.190
finished, that's My relationship with you,

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.140
I'm not going to tell you about Myself

01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:11.110
to get crucified again.

01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:15.110
Christ tried to tell something about Himself,

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.190
and they crucified Him.

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.170
Now if I tell him, "Of course I know about God,"

01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:23.060
he is not going to accept.

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.190
If I say, "I don't know," then he is not going to accept.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.100
Stupid.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.210
Indians are not stupid at all, they are very wise people,

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:31.210
I must say.

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:35.130
I am surprised from where this stupidity has come.

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.070
Very wise.

01:31:39.130 --> 01:31:41.150
Indians are very wise because it’s a yoga bhoomi, you know,

01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:44.110
such a, it’s such an ancient country of ours.

01:31:44.190 --> 01:31:47.150
You don't know the praises of this country I can ...

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:51.150
Do not judge them by the people you see, no, no, no, no, no.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
It’s very great country, it’s very great, it’s spiritual,

01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:57.220
absolute spiritual country.

01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:00.140
See these are I don't know what's the matter with them,

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.030
very superficial people have come here,

01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:03.180
extremely superficial.

01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:06.030
There are some great souls also I say,

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:10.220
but don't judge, don't judge that great country.

01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:14.120
Once I was going to India with My husband and I told him,

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.090
"We've touched our country." And he said, "How do You know?"

01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:18.120
I said, "See, the vibrations!

01:32:18.210 --> 01:32:23.010
The whole country is vibrating, the atmosphere is vibrating."

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.170
He said, "Really?"

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.120
I said, "You go and ask the pilot."

01:32:26.210 --> 01:32:28.240
We were in the first class, he went down and he asked him.

01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:32.030
He said, "Sir, we just touched it about a minute back."

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.140
Such a great country like that,

01:32:36.010 --> 01:32:38.020
the whole, the Kundalini of the Universe

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:40.010
resides in that country, can you imagine -

01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:44.050
the Kundalini. And they have no desire to seek,

01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:46.120
that's the power of desire that resides there,

01:32:46.210 --> 01:32:48.040
and they have no power to seek.

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:50.190
Can you imagine? (Hindi)

01:32:51.210 --> 01:32:53.130
I am Myself surprised

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:55.200
and those who have come also like gurus,

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:58.150
horrible people making money,

01:32:59.150 --> 01:33:03.070
I'm ashamed if I am an Indian by any chance or if,

01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:07.010
as I'm ashamed I sometimes feel,

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.240
"What have they done to what we had?"

01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:13.240
They have such a tremendous heritage, you are just a shoot,

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.150
you are just the outside, you are the tree,

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:20.160
we are the roots, you can't live without us,

01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:25.180
we are your roots and these roots I see I can't understand.

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:39.020
Still it's all right, it's the concern of a Mother.

01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:42.060
Let's have it. Now, put your hands towards Me, please.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:45.030
All of you take out your shoes. You must have seeking.

01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:46.060
If you have no seeking,

01:33:46.170 --> 01:33:48.220
what's the use of coming to My program?
