01:05.334 --> 01:15.000
Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis,

01:15.034 --> 01:20.634
because today Shri Ganesha was born.

01:20.667 --> 01:26.534
Shri Ganesha is whom we worship

01:26.567 --> 01:35.801
and because of whom we got our awakening (jagruti).

01:35.834 --> 01:39.367
However much you may remember Him,

01:39.401 --> 01:48.434
until you do not know His
special qualities, you cannot attain Him.

01:48.467 --> 01:59.234
His special quality is that He is the embodiment
of purity (shuddha swaroop)

01:59.267 --> 02:18.301
and complete Master of the Universe.

02:18.301 --> 02:23.601
He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.

02:23.634 --> 02:36.734
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet),
rhythm (taal) and notes (sur).

02:36.767 --> 02:44.134
By His Grace only people become one with music
(talleen).

02:44.167 --> 02:53.000
A small boy who came into the world
and did such great work!

02:53.000 --> 03:01.601
He has given so many things to everyone
and even today He is active.

03:01.634 --> 03:06.167
Shri Ganesha’s Puja, no matter how much
you do it, it is not enough.

03:06.201 --> 03:24.334
A lot of people say we don’t see Shri Ganesha, even after
worshiping Him so much, we do not attain Him.

03:24.367 --> 03:32.367
He is omnipotent, omnipresent and in everything,

03:32.401 --> 03:44.534
but you cannot recognize Him until you are Realized.

03:44.567 --> 03:52.000
After your realization you can recognize what Shri Ganesha is.

03:52.034 --> 04:04.634
Shri Ganesha is Purity, the Pure Spirit.

04:04.667 --> 04:16.301
When He is awakened within us,
then we have no questions left.

04:16.334 --> 04:24.167
Then we are successful, in whichever task we undertake.

04:24.201 --> 04:30.467
We find joy in everything we do.

04:30.501 --> 04:37.067
He is the embodiment of joy
and gives joy to everyone.

04:37.101 --> 04:42.934
To serve Him is the ultimate dharma (paramdharma).

04:42.967 --> 04:52.000
To serve Him means to look after small children, to serve
them,

04:52.034 --> 04:58.667
to protect them, to make sure there is no cruelty towards them.

04:58.701 --> 05:04.201
This pleases Him very much.

05:04.234 --> 05:15.467
Such an embodiment of love,
such a simple-hearted Shri Ganesha, was born today.

05:15.501 --> 05:20.867
This is the importance of this day.

05:20.901 --> 05:32.567
Today, if you ask for any wish, then Shri Ganesha will fulfill it.

05:32.601 --> 05:46.067
It is His right to fulfill all your desires,
because you are all realized.

05:46.101 --> 05:57.701
Ask Him from all your heart, and He will help you in every way,
every moment, and every instant.

05:57.734 --> 06:01.501
Today is a very big day,

06:01.534 --> 06:08.367
because verily the pure Spirit itself has taken birth today.

06:08.401 --> 06:17.367
And He already had such a spiritual, eternal state

06:17.401 --> 06:21.201
that many people could not comprehend it or write about it.

06:21.234 --> 06:32.067
Many people didn’t tell anything;
they wrote only what they could understand.

06:32.101 --> 06:42.534
But you can understand that just
by Shri Ganesha’s name you get your realization.

06:42.567 --> 06:50.367
Just by taking His name,
any disease or any pain will disappear.

06:50.401 --> 07:01.501
He is eternal.

07:01.534 --> 07:07.901
He is always present within us.

07:07.934 --> 07:15.901
When you get your realization, you can feel His presence.

07:15.934 --> 07:20.534
And if you are not realized, you cannot understand.

07:20.567 --> 07:26.734
That is why people get misled and do wrong things.

07:26.767 --> 07:33.967
But with Shri Ganesha’s blessings, you can do so many things,

07:34.000 --> 07:41.567
and you won’t feel greedy nor have any problems,

07:41.601 --> 07:49.634
because He does all the work for you. He takes care of you.

07:49.667 --> 07:55.301
Though He is a little boy, He looks after you.

07:55.334 --> 07:58.601
It’s a tremendous power.

07:58.634 --> 08:07.901
By Shri Ganesha’s power, several works are manifested.

08:07.934 --> 08:18.301
For Me, He is the purest ever and My own.

08:18.334 --> 08:23.034
I trouble Him a lot.

08:23.067 --> 08:26.000
When somebody tries to trouble Me,

08:26.034 --> 08:32.201
I ask Him to handle this fellow and to make him alright.

08:32.234 --> 08:37.667
When this fellow is not manageable by Me,
when there is a difficult person

08:37.701 --> 08:40.267
and it is not possible for Me to handle him,
then He does the job.

08:40.301 --> 08:51.934
So today is very auspicious, as He was born this day.

08:51.967 --> 08:57.034
Secondly, today is Panchami (the fifth day).

08:57.067 --> 09:12.934
This Panchami is recognized
because on this day we wear special clothes.

09:12.967 --> 09:24.667
Whatever we wear is so that our body is properly covered.

09:24.667 --> 09:37.501
The sense of chastity that our body has is because of Him;

09:37.534 --> 09:41.601
Lajja Rupena Samsthita
[the one who resides in the form of bashful modesty].

09:41.634 --> 09:50.467
So if you have any sense of chastity, it is because of Him.

09:50.501 --> 09:57.501
That will benefit you immensely.

09:57.534 --> 10:06.234
You cannot feel joyous until you worship Shri Ganesha.

10:06.267 --> 10:11.501
By worshipping Shri Ganesha, your joy increases.

10:11.534 --> 10:19.334
You become joyous,
because He is the personification of joy [anand swaroop].

10:19.367 --> 10:34.367
Because of this, we have both things today:
His birthday and His help.

10:34.401 --> 10:42.534
We seek His help in any work we do. Such is our way.

10:42.567 --> 10:53.401
But we don’t see what we do to establish Him.
Our attention does not go in that direction.

10:53.401 --> 10:58.134
That we should also do something,
that we should also develop our state,

10:58.134 --> 11:05.101
that we should have a state in which
Shri Ganesha is awakened within us,

11:05.134 --> 11:09.734
through which we may never venture on the wrong path.

11:09.767 --> 11:15.367
Those who are rooted in Ganesha are special.

11:15.401 --> 11:25.101
They despise all the wrong things in this world,
and they do not do anything wrong,

11:25.134 --> 11:28.934
because Shri Ganesha stops them.

11:28.967 --> 11:33.067
They cannot enjoy wrong activities.

11:33.101 --> 11:44.267
This is Shri Ganesha’s great blessing,
that you have entered a new, joyous life.

11:44.267 --> 11:52.501
So today in His service, in order to make him joyous,

11:52.501 --> 11:59.767
sing His praise and glory, so that He may be pleased.

11:59.801 --> 12:05.534
My eternal blessings to all of you.
