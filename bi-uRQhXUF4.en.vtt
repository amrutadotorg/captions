00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:15.000
Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis,

00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:20.634
because today Shri Ganesha was born.

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:26.534
Shri Ganesha is whom we worship

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:35.801
and because of whom we got our awakening (jagruti).

00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:39.367
However much you may remember Him,

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:48.434
until you do not know His
special qualities, you cannot attain Him.

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:59.234
His special quality is that He is the embodiment
of purity (shuddha swaroop)

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:18.301
and complete Master of the Universe.

00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:23.601
He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.

00:02:23.634 --> 00:02:36.734
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet),
rhythm (taal) and notes (sur).

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:44.134
By His Grace only people become one with music
(talleen).

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:53.000
A small boy who came into the world
and did such great work!

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.601
He has given so many things to everyone
and even today He is active.

00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:06.167
Shri Ganesha’s Puja, no matter how much
you do it, it is not enough.

00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:24.334
A lot of people say we don’t see Shri Ganesha, even after
worshiping Him so much, we do not attain Him.

00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:32.367
He is omnipotent, omnipresent and in everything,

00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:44.534
but you cannot recognize Him until you are Realized.

00:03:44.567 --> 00:03:52.000
After your realization you can recognize what Shri Ganesha is.

00:03:52.034 --> 00:04:04.634
Shri Ganesha is Purity, the Pure Spirit.

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:16.301
When He is awakened within us,
then we have no questions left.

00:04:16.334 --> 00:04:24.167
Then we are successful, in whichever task we undertake.

00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:30.467
We find joy in everything we do.

00:04:30.501 --> 00:04:37.067
He is the embodiment of joy
and gives joy to everyone.

00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:42.934
To serve Him is the ultimate dharma (paramdharma).

00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:52.000
To serve Him means to look after small children, to serve
them,

00:04:52.034 --> 00:04:58.667
to protect them, to make sure there is no cruelty towards them.

00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:04.201
This pleases Him very much.

00:05:04.234 --> 00:05:15.467
Such an embodiment of love,
such a simple-hearted Shri Ganesha, was born today.

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:20.867
This is the importance of this day.

00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:32.567
Today, if you ask for any wish, then Shri Ganesha will fulfill it.

00:05:32.601 --> 00:05:46.067
It is His right to fulfill all your desires,
because you are all realized.

00:05:46.101 --> 00:05:57.701
Ask Him from all your heart, and He will help you in every way,
every moment, and every instant.

00:05:57.734 --> 00:06:01.501
Today is a very big day,

00:06:01.534 --> 00:06:08.367
because verily the pure Spirit itself has taken birth today.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:17.367
And He already had such a spiritual, eternal state

00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:21.201
that many people could not comprehend it or write about it.

00:06:21.234 --> 00:06:32.067
Many people didn’t tell anything;
they wrote only what they could understand.

00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:42.534
But you can understand that just
by Shri Ganesha’s name you get your realization.

00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:50.367
Just by taking His name,
any disease or any pain will disappear.

00:06:50.401 --> 00:07:01.501
He is eternal.

00:07:01.534 --> 00:07:07.901
He is always present within us.

00:07:07.934 --> 00:07:15.901
When you get your realization, you can feel His presence.

00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:20.534
And if you are not realized, you cannot understand.

00:07:20.567 --> 00:07:26.734
That is why people get misled and do wrong things.

00:07:26.767 --> 00:07:33.967
But with Shri Ganesha’s blessings, you can do so many things,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.567
and you won’t feel greedy nor have any problems,

00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:49.634
because He does all the work for you. He takes care of you.

00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:55.301
Though He is a little boy, He looks after you.

00:07:55.334 --> 00:07:58.601
It’s a tremendous power.

00:07:58.634 --> 00:08:07.901
By Shri Ganesha’s power, several works are manifested.

00:08:07.934 --> 00:08:18.301
For Me, He is the purest ever and My own.

00:08:18.334 --> 00:08:23.034
I trouble Him a lot.

00:08:23.067 --> 00:08:26.000
When somebody tries to trouble Me,

00:08:26.034 --> 00:08:32.201
I ask Him to handle this fellow and to make him alright.

00:08:32.234 --> 00:08:37.667
When this fellow is not manageable by Me,
when there is a difficult person

00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:40.267
and it is not possible for Me to handle him,
then He does the job.

00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:51.934
So today is very auspicious, as He was born this day.

00:08:51.967 --> 00:08:57.034
Secondly, today is Panchami (the fifth day).

00:08:57.067 --> 00:09:12.934
This Panchami is recognized
because on this day we wear special clothes.

00:09:12.967 --> 00:09:24.667
Whatever we wear is so that our body is properly covered.

00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:37.501
The sense of chastity that our body has is because of Him;

00:09:37.534 --> 00:09:41.601
Lajja Rupena Samsthita
[the one who resides in the form of bashful modesty].

00:09:41.634 --> 00:09:50.467
So if you have any sense of chastity, it is because of Him.

00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:57.501
That will benefit you immensely.

00:09:57.534 --> 00:10:06.234
You cannot feel joyous until you worship Shri Ganesha.

00:10:06.267 --> 00:10:11.501
By worshipping Shri Ganesha, your joy increases.

00:10:11.534 --> 00:10:19.334
You become joyous,
because He is the personification of joy [anand swaroop].

00:10:19.367 --> 00:10:34.367
Because of this, we have both things today:
His birthday and His help.

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:42.534
We seek His help in any work we do. Such is our way.

00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:53.401
But we don’t see what we do to establish Him.
Our attention does not go in that direction.

00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:58.134
That we should also do something,
that we should also develop our state,

00:10:58.134 --> 00:11:05.101
that we should have a state in which
Shri Ganesha is awakened within us,

00:11:05.134 --> 00:11:09.734
through which we may never venture on the wrong path.

00:11:09.767 --> 00:11:15.367
Those who are rooted in Ganesha are special.

00:11:15.401 --> 00:11:25.101
They despise all the wrong things in this world,
and they do not do anything wrong,

00:11:25.134 --> 00:11:28.934
because Shri Ganesha stops them.

00:11:28.967 --> 00:11:33.067
They cannot enjoy wrong activities.

00:11:33.101 --> 00:11:44.267
This is Shri Ganesha’s great blessing,
that you have entered a new, joyous life.

00:11:44.267 --> 00:11:52.501
So today in His service, in order to make him joyous,

00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:59.767
sing His praise and glory, so that He may be pleased.

00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:05.534
My eternal blessings to all of you.
