00:00:06.147 --> 00:00:13.267
Can you love a person who is distressful?

00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:20.387
One who is aggressive? One who is hot-tempered?

00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:23.867
One who cheats you?

00:00:24.187 --> 00:00:28.507
Can you love such a person? You cannot,

00:00:29.547 --> 00:00:35.827
Then how can you love yourself when you have these qualities,

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:40.427
when you do this to yourself?

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:55.947
So the first thing is the pure love for yourself.

00:00:57.427 --> 00:01:04.250
Pure love. It's such a great thing to have pure love.

00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:07.951
So now you have got Self Realisation.

00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:11.871
Means you know what you are,

00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:15.791
you know what beautiful thing you are.

00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:22.671
When that is so, you should try to love your self.

00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:26.871
And when you start loving yourself,

00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:31.111
you are not bothered about all non-sensical things.

00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:37.911
Now this pure love is one of the most beautiful things

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:42.071
you have which you can do to yourself.

00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:50.871
When you are selfish, you are not loving your self.

00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:57.791
When you are unkind, you are not loving your self.

00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:02.431
When you are agressive, you are not loving your self.

00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:09.991
Because you are loving all these bad things; but your Self is pure.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.951
It's absolutely pure and beautiful.

00:02:15.431 --> 00:02:20.151
And it loves all that is beautiful and good.

00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:26.271
So this is the beginning of your 'Self' Realisation:

00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:31.351
when you realise how important is your Self.

00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:35.151
You don't have wrong ideas about yourself,

00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:38.751
you don't justify all the wrong things you do,

00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:46.951
because you understand that  is a blemish on your Self.

00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:53.031
Face yourself in the most honest manner,

00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:58.471
and you will be amazed to see how nice it is.

00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:04.671
Just to see the pure Self shining within you.

00:03:05.431 --> 00:03:11.791
When that Self starts shining, you start seeing many other things

00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:19.111
which you have not seen, so far. And one of them you see

00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:27.471
is that love is not only for yourself, but for everyone.

00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:34.591
It's a pure love for everyone else.

00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:40.511
It's not only for yourself. It's very surprising:

00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:48.551
when you really love yourself then your love is for yourself,

00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:56.831
and you start spreading that love

00:03:57.271 --> 00:04:03.551
in such a manner that you beautifully love others.

00:04:05.271 --> 00:04:07.951
You don't love for money,

00:04:08.391 --> 00:04:14.871
you don't love for some advantage, for some power

00:04:16.264 --> 00:04:22.352
or for some gain, but you love for love.
