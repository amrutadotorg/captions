1
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:09,402
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna

2
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:18,372
as a very great personality.

3
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:24,582
And you know why He came on this earth –

4
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:34,462
to establish this is the new form of, not Virat, not Virata,

5
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:46,352
but a form by which this country became so prosperous.

6
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:59,372
And by His advent only He created a beautiful mentality

7
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:08,542
among the people how to develop this country with Dharma.

8
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,482
And you had very great leaders

9
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:18,432
who followed Him

10
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:26,352
and who worshipped Him in a way,

11
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:33,382
and created a new world of this America.

12
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:38,512
But unfortunately as the time passed on,

13
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:46,562
His form vanished from the minds of the people.

14
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:52,472
The reason was, Krishna was represented here

15
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:58,352
by very, very wrong type of people who had no idea

16
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:01,442
about Shri Krishna:

17
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:12,482
that He was a great master of wealth,

18
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:20,382
that He knew how to use the wealth and how to create

19
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:24,512
the wealth with dharma, not with adharma.

20
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:30,522
They all forgot about it completely

21
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:35,412
and gradually started using maneuvering powers,

22
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:45,442
all kinds of, all kinds of adharmic things – cheating, grabbing

23
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:54,342
money, spending their money in absolutely useless things.

24
00:04:56,582 --> 00:05:01,462
He is Kubera. He doesn’t need any money, of course,

25
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:05,552
He achieves money;

26
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:10,352
and not only that,

27
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:14,362
He is living, He lived in money.

28
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:21,502
They said that He created a golden house for Him,

29
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:27,422
absolutely made with gold in Dwarika,

30
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:30,462
but it submerged in the water,

31
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:37,442
in the sea, and nobody believed that it is true.

32
00:05:37,562 --> 00:05:42,442
But now they have found out His house under the water,

33
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,372
very deep waters,

34
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:52,372
so all their conjecture about Him was wrong, all false;

35
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:56,542
that He was definitely a man who made lots of money

36
00:05:57,412 --> 00:05:58,542
by dharma.

37
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:04,392
Also He was a son of a king, and He built this Dwarika

38
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:07,382
out of gold.

39
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:11,472
It is still there and people have found it,

40
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:15,502
but under the sea.

41
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:21,342
Thousands of years have passed, but still existed.

42
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:25,542
Only because perhaps we belong to Shri Krishna,

43
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:28,412
it is still existing.

44
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:33,432
That’s what it is, because He was the one

45
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:37,442
who was for satya first – truth.

46
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:44,492
He was for truth, and He worked out everything

47
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:48,552
on the principle of truth.

48
00:06:49,472 --> 00:06:53,382
Whatever was not truth, He tried to finish it off.

49
00:06:53,522 --> 00:07:00,422
Whatever was destructive, He tried to remove that;

50
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:07,542
and He established Himself through truth only, truth only.

51
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:12,532
He’s the one who represent the truth, absolute truth,

52
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:18,372
and how the truth can prevail in everything.

53
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:25,342
I’m just the opposite of Him because I don’t understand

54
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:27,412
money at all,

55
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:32,342
but He’s looking after that part in My life.

56
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:35,502
I’m so hopelessly bad –

57
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:40,582
I don’t understand banking, I don’t understand money,

58
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:46,412
I can’t even count money. Now what can you say to that?

59
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:49,582
But He’s there to look after,

60
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:54,572
and I've never a dearth of money, never a dearth of any

61
00:07:55,582 --> 00:08:00,362
wealth, it’s all full of it.

62
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:06,432
Also it comes through your sense of satisfaction.

63
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:10,522
If you have that sense of satisfaction,

64
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:15,572
you don’t look for money.

65
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:20,502
What happened in your country that some people got money.

66
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:25,372
If you got little money, then you get the taste of money.

67
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,382
They’re not satisfied people.

68
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:33,542
So like mad they went on spending on nonsensical things.

69
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,522
It is something very much human.

70
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:42,572
After your human evolution,

71
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:47,402
after you have reached a certain state of enlightenment,

72
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:54,582
then all these demeaning things like greed

73
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:59,432
all disappear from your character.

74
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:03,522
You don’t have that greed in you anymore

75
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:09,352
and you become extremely a satisfied person.

76
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,572
To you money is there, all right, but it’s not so important.

77
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:23,472
It is just that you think don’t need it, and you’ll get it –

78
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:27,582
all done by Shri Krishna all over, can you imagine?

79
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:31,462
He’s doing all this, looking after you

80
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:35,582
and helping you with money.

81
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:39,552
We started Sahaja Yoga without a single pai.

82
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:43,442
I don’t, never had any problem.

83
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:51,432
So one thing, as Kubera He’s the supplier of wealth.

84
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:55,362
He looks after people who don’t have money.

85
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:59,402
He gives money to people who stand by truth,

86
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:04,492
who enjoy the life of truth.

87
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:19,522
It is His work that people enjoy wealth, otherwise they don’t.

88
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:22,482
They have this much, they want to have more;

89
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:25,492
that means they don’t enjoy the wealth.

90
00:10:26,362 --> 00:10:29,382
They have a little, they want to get much more. Why?

91
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:34,432
Because they are not enjoying whatever they have.

92
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:38,492
But after Self-realization you will see that you enjoy

93
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:41,492
whatever you have.

94
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:45,442
You enjoy it fully, absolutely,

95
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:49,452
and you don’t hanker after something that is not there.

96
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:52,362
Doesn’t matter if you don’t have.

97
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:55,352
Many a times people have asked Me,

98
00:10:55,482 --> 00:11:00,492
“Mother, why not we have the puja of Krishna as Kubera?”

99
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,462
I said, “All right.

100
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:05,412
Just now everybody’s trying to become Kuber.

101
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,502
Let them learn a lesson,

102
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:11,512
and then we will have the puja of Kubera.”

103
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:17,402
And that’s why today I’ve agreed to have this puja.

104
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:23,462
Because now you have seen what happens if you have greed.

105
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:28,492
You go on committing all kinds of sins,

106
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:34,352
all kinds of wrong things which can destroy your country.

107
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:37,582
Such a rich country has now become a poor country.

108
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:40,502
Where is that money gone?

109
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:42,392
They’re very clever.

110
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:45,582
Somebody told Me today that this money with the insurance.

111
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:48,462
“My God,” I said, “the law is such that

112
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,572
you can’t get out that money.”

113
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:55,422
Secondly they said that it is in offshore and all that.

114
00:11:55,572 --> 00:12:01,402
I said, “But see now, they were never afraid

115
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:05,572
that they'll be caught up,

116
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:10,382
and they continued for so many years.

117
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:14,422
But I’m sure one day

118
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:18,512
they'll all be exposed by Kubera Himself.”

119
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:24,432
So today by worshipping Kubera what we are doing,

120
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:30,422
we are going to establish, establish the truth of money,

121
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:35,352
what lies behind the money,

122
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:45,342
what is the point of having money.

123
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:47,382
This country had money.

124
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:52,502
As a result so many good people came here to work,

125
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:56,412
and you had so many complementary things.

126
00:12:57,342 --> 00:13:00,522
You had lots of people who have complemented,

127
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:05,342
because I think in certain things Americans were little less;

128
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:09,422
not in intelligence, but in brilliance I think

129
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,562
they were little bit lacking.

130
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:15,392
So they got very brilliant people from abroad,

131
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:20,522
and also they were very focused people,

132
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:23,452
so they worked it out very well.

133
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:28,382
Also they respected people who came with brains.

134
00:13:28,502 --> 00:13:31,562
So this is what happens when you forget

135
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:36,352
that truth is the main point.

136
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:41,362
If you don’t have the truth, no use having money.

137
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:46,342
Because what you did was to go around with this thing,

138
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:52,492
that thing, I mean all kinds of things, to just get money.

139
00:13:54,342 --> 00:13:57,512
The other day I was traveling through Las Vegas – last year.

140
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:01,462
And when we stopped at that airport

141
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:05,382
so many people walked into the aeroplane,

142
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:07,532
and they all were looking as if somebody’s dead

143
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:09,522
in their family or what has happened.

144
00:14:10,442 --> 00:14:12,402
First I couldn’t understand.

145
00:14:12,522 --> 00:14:16,462
Then said, “Mother, they have lost all their money.”

146
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:24,452
So when they have money, they are jumping, next moment

147
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:26,582
they are crying because they have lost the money.

148
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:29,462
What’s the use of such a money

149
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:34,352
which is so temporary, which is so useless?

150
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:39,582
But that is human nature, to run after maya.

151
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:47,352
And this is the quality of money, that it gives you maya.

152
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:52,432
Maya like this, that they get a little money somehow;

153
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:56,552
with that little money, they buy something.

154
00:14:57,422 --> 00:15:00,402
Then they think money is very important.

155
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,442
You see, you can buy lots of things,

156
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,452
you can buy cars, you can buy airplanes, this, that.

157
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:12,462
So there is where maya plays on you, and you start running

158
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:17,352
after that mad money which makes you mad.

159
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:21,562
It’s nice that at this juncture they have discovered

160
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:25,542
the falsehood of this maya money.

161
00:15:26,432 --> 00:15:30,362
And I am so happy that they were all handcuffed,

162
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:36,352
and all their power of money was finished.

163
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:41,462
So, this Kubera is working out all these tricks.

164
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:48,422
Krishna is a very tricky, extremely tricky personality.

165
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:54,582
He puts the tricks, every action after every action.

166
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:58,422
Now money matters:

167
00:15:58,562 --> 00:16:04,352
He first befools you that you run after it,

168
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:09,522
and then you just discover that it was stupidity.

169
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:15,342
We have a story in our land, country, called “Sheikh Chili.”

170
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,422
He got little money,

171
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:23,402
and he got into the grab of this maya.

172
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:26,562
So he thought, “I can do very well.”

173
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:30,362
So he started dreaming as to what he should do.

174
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:34,382
So he went and bought lots of eggs and he said,

175
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:39,382
“Now these eggs will have little, little chicks which will grow,

176
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:42,432
which will I’ll sell and I’ll so much money,”

177
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:44,442
and it was like that he was talking.

178
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:50,572
And while thinking about it in his mind went off to sleep,

179
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:54,532
and then in his sleep he fell on the eggs

180
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:58,422
and all the eggs broke.

181
00:16:58,532 --> 00:17:01,472
So the maya was over.

182
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:05,442
This should happen early, but if it doesn’t happen

183
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:10,442
then you end up in the jail or something like that.

184
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:17,362
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which gives you a complete vision,

185
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:20,412
complete vision of the destruction

186
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:25,352
that can follow this maya business.

187
00:17:25,572 --> 00:17:30,412
It is something, such a insight

188
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,442
that you don’t have to do anything with it.

189
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:38,352
I'm different, I told you I don’t understand it at all.

190
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:42,352
But even if you understand the value of money,

191
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:46,362
even if you understand that money can bring

192
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:51,432
lots of things to you, despite that you don’t look at it,

193
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:57,502
just turn your face – that is the sign of a real Sahaja yogi.

194
00:17:57,572 --> 00:18:01,422
To him it doesn’t matter, temperamentally.

195
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:06,362
It’s not that he does something for that or tells his mind, nothing;

196
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:11,402
temperamentally he doesn’t care for money,

197
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:15,482
just because he’s above it.

198
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:19,512
The one who is above money is a real Sahaja yogi.

199
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:23,542
The one who is engulfed in the nonsense

200
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:28,362
and the maya of money is not a Sahaja yogi.

201
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:30,472
Of course I have seen most of the Sahaja yogis

202
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:33,342
are extremely honest, specially in the West.

203
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:37,462
But in India there’s a disease: as you have some here viruses,

204
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:41,442
we have certain viruses in India also.

205
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:44,352
So they still go on running after money,

206
00:18:44,472 --> 00:18:46,472
to them money is important.

207
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:50,562
But in the evolutionary process if you reach a certain state

208
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:54,482
where you rise above your Nabhi Chakra,

209
00:18:55,362 --> 00:19:00,342
rise your Nabhi Chakra, then money’s not so important.

210
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:02,512
It’s not so important.

211
00:19:07,382 --> 00:19:16,372
To Me, I find I cannot buy things unnecessarily.

212
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,572
Of course I mean there are so many unnecessary things

213
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:24,482
gathered, because you people give Me here presents, this that.

214
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:30,342
But Myself, you’ll be amazed, I’m so nervous or I should say

215
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:36,462
hesitant, or you may call it absolutely absent from the spot

216
00:19:36,572 --> 00:19:41,442
where they are doing any business, any purchasing.

217
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:45,582
Come here and fix it please.

218
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:54,512
It falls down, so I'm holding on!

219
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:03,432
Correct, now all right.

220
00:20:05,532 --> 00:20:13,532
In the same way, Sahaja yogis have to fix their mind

221
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:23,552
to their spirit,

222
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:30,432
and enjoy the powers of your spirit, your own.

223
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:37,402
That enjoyment once you get it, you don’t fall to your greed.

224
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:40,372
This is something

225
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:45,342
very, very simple,

226
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:48,422
but sometimes you don’t do it.

227
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:54,352
You get enamored by something, maybe a car,

228
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:57,462
maybe aeroplane, I don’t know what – whatever it is.

229
00:20:58,352 --> 00:21:02,362
It’s a headache to have too many cars, isn’t it?

230
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:05,482
But people have;

231
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:08,402
they think by that people are impressed,

232
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:11,492
and they think no end of themselves or not – nothing.

233
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:15,562
If they are impressed, what is the use to us?

234
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:18,542
What do you get out of it?

235
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:24,462
Sahaja yogi has his own spirit to enjoy,

236
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:26,442
more than anything else.

237
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:28,562
He doesn’t want to possess anything.

238
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:32,362
It’s a headache to possess things also.

239
00:21:32,502 --> 00:21:36,452
The other side of it is a Mahalakshmi.

240
00:21:37,442 --> 00:21:40,522
If that principle is within you, Mahalakshmi Principle,

241
00:21:41,412 --> 00:21:43,542
you’ll have never a problem of money.

242
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:47,422
On the contrary, you’ll know how to stop it.

243
00:21:47,552 --> 00:21:51,562
So far as I am concerned,

244
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:56,482
I get fed up of My Mahalakshmi Principle

245
00:21:57,362 --> 00:21:59,452
because I don’t know from where it works out,

246
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:05,482
how it works out, without any effort.

247
00:22:07,482 --> 00:22:12,582
But the temperamentally, I have no interest at all,

248
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,542
temperamentally.

249
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:23,462
But it is the, I don’t know what is the cause of this effect.

250
00:22:25,392 --> 00:22:29,352
Now supposing I buy some small thing, just like that,

251
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:33,562
it will sell at least ten times more.

252
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:38,502
It will be of value at least ten times more, I don’t know how.

253
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:45,472
It’s very surprising – automatically.

254
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:53,342
I’ll buy something very small, then I find it’s very expensive.

255
00:22:53,532 --> 00:22:58,562
How it works, just must be miracles of Mahalakshmi, I think.

256
00:22:59,482 --> 00:23:03,502
So what I have to tell you is this,

257
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:09,532
that you should not worry about your financial situations

258
00:23:10,382 --> 00:23:12,372
at all.

259
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,432
Do not go on calculating,

260
00:23:14,552 --> 00:23:19,342
do not see how much money you have in the bank,

261
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:21,342
what you have to do with your money,

262
00:23:21,452 --> 00:23:22,482
where you should invest.

263
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:27,342
I have seen people going mad planning the whole thing.

264
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:31,432
There’s no need to do that once you are a Sahaja yogi.

265
00:23:31,562 --> 00:23:35,342
It all works automatically.

266
00:23:35,452 --> 00:23:39,432
The greed is within you, just like any other disease.

267
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:43,392
As you have diseases, greed is also there.

268
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:47,482
As your diseases can get cured with Sahaja Yoga,

269
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:56,572
your diseases, as much as your greed is, it vanishes.

270
00:23:58,402 --> 00:24:01,492
You don’t know what is greed is.

271
00:24:02,582 --> 00:24:07,462
The only way to counter-balance is to become extremely

272
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:10,432
generous.

273
00:24:10,572 --> 00:24:15,362
If you are extremely generous, greed will run away.

274
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:18,462
That may be another way of doing it.

275
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:25,392
Supposing you get something in your house

276
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,412
and you think it is too much.

277
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:33,372
Not to get rid of it but just to think it’s too much,

278
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,392
you should give it to someone; you just start thinking,

279
00:24:35,492 --> 00:24:37,392
whom can you give?

280
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:39,582
And immediately you’ll remember,

281
00:24:40,442 --> 00:24:44,442
“Oh, that person doesn’t have this. Let me give him this.”

282
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:48,502
And if you give him he’ll be so thankful, so thankful,

283
00:24:49,382 --> 00:24:52,452
and he’ll say all kinds of nice things to you

284
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:57,342
which normally nobody would say to you, nobody.

285
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:06,432
And it’s surprising how joy-giving it is,

286
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:11,382
how people like your generosity.

287
00:25:11,502 --> 00:25:14,502
So you have to be generous, just generous;

288
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:17,472
not with yourself, but with others.

289
00:25:18,362 --> 00:25:23,392
As much as possible, be generous.

290
00:25:24,452 --> 00:25:32,432
Generosity is very love-giving, one of the expressions

291
00:25:32,552 --> 00:25:35,432
of your love.

292
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:39,532
Many a times it has happened with Me

293
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:44,532
that I saw somebody needed something,

294
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:48,422
and kept it in My mind.

295
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:52,432
Then I bought that thing and gave it to that person.

296
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:58,482
And the amount of love that person gave Me

297
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:01,382
was thousand time more

298
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:09,342
than what I would have got joy out of buying it, by that thing.

299
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:13,442
It was so insipid for Me, but for him it was.... He told so

300
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:18,382
many people, “Mother gave me this. Mother gave me.”

301
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:20,562
I mean, I was surprised.

302
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:23,522
Then they asked Me, “Mother, how did You give him?”

303
00:26:24,392 --> 00:26:26,512
I said, “Just out of love.”

304
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:30,422
Many people took to Sahaja Yoga thinking,

305
00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:33,372
“What a generosity is!”

306
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:37,562
So to be generous is the best way to live in this world.

307
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:43,342
After all it’s a headache to have too many things.

308
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:47,552
Better to get rid of them, but out of love.

309
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:50,522
If you do that,

310
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:56,422
you’ll be know how much they’ll be appreciative of you.

311
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:04,542
Another thing is, to get greed of, to get rid of greed

312
00:27:06,342 --> 00:27:11,462
you should try to do some sort of a collective social work.

313
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:17,492
Supposing you go to some place where lots of poor people

314
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:22,452
are there, I tell you your greed will just drop out.

315
00:27:23,572 --> 00:27:25,582
You’ll be amazed how these people are living,

316
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:28,372
in what conditions.

317
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:32,452
“Why do I care for all the wealth and everything?”

318
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:36,402
That will be just shocking.

319
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:39,462
Sometimes, you see, you see people

320
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:44,492
in India also in a very bad condition.

321
00:27:45,352 --> 00:27:47,512
Once I went to Calcutta

322
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:54,542
and I was so – somehow or other you see by chance,

323
00:27:55,402 --> 00:28:00,382
I happened to be in places where people were very, in a very,

324
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:05,492
very great poverty, even the children.

325
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:09,552
And you’ll be amazed, for days together I wouldn’t eat My food.

326
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:14,382
I was crying and not eating My food, I just didn’t know

327
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:16,442
what to do.

328
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:19,562
Because I felt, “What is this?

329
00:28:20,462 --> 00:28:23,462
Why these people are so poor?”

330
00:28:23,562 --> 00:28:27,462
And I was helpless so I was crying,

331
00:28:27,552 --> 00:28:33,442
that one day I should try to do something for them.

332
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:38,352
It is really remarkable, at a very young age of Mine

333
00:28:38,572 --> 00:28:47,402
I started a leper home, I started a infirmary, a refugee home,

334
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:50,462
all kinds of things.

335
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:57,552
And I never even thought that whatever money I have,

336
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:06,412
if I give to these people I may have to give up some things.

337
00:29:07,422 --> 00:29:09,482
I also sold some of My things,

338
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:14,472
because so pleasure-giving I tell you, so pleasure-giving,

339
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:18,502
so joy-giving to be generous.

340
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:26,402
It is so pain in every way that you should be generous.

341
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:29,512
That is the quality of Kubera.

342
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:34,412
He’s an extremely generous personality,

343
00:29:35,422 --> 00:29:39,482
and that’s what’s personality you should be.

344
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,492
So, I’ve seen that Sahaja yogis are very generous.

345
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:50,352
So far nobody has told Me that somebody is a miserly fellow –

346
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:53,442
so far, so far.

347
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:59,582
But I’m sure one day will come when we’ll have people

348
00:30:00,442 --> 00:30:04,352
of very high quality.

349
00:30:04,462 --> 00:30:08,422
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t say like other cults say that

350
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:14,472
you give up your clothes, you give up your family, you stay,

351
00:30:15,352 --> 00:30:20,582
stay in a forest or in a hut or anything – nothing of the kind.

352
00:30:21,442 --> 00:30:24,462
Don’t give up anything.

353
00:30:24,562 --> 00:30:28,562
You have to give up from your heart.

354
00:30:29,442 --> 00:30:31,562
Just it should happen in your personality;

355
00:30:32,412 --> 00:30:34,552
don’t have to give up.

356
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:44,352
And if you have that well-built in spirituality,

357
00:30:45,362 --> 00:30:52,402
you’ll not even think of grabbing someone.

358
00:30:53,492 --> 00:30:56,442
On the contrary,

359
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:59,532
you would like to give up everything.

360
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:03,402
My father was even worse than Me, I should say.

361
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:07,472
He always used to leave the house open, all doors open.

362
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:12,482
He said, “No thief will come in if you keep the doors closed.”

363
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:15,452
So one day a thief came

364
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:19,502
and he took away his gramophone – in the old times,

365
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:23,532
these big horn ones – he took away.

366
00:31:24,442 --> 00:31:27,502
The next day My father was sitting, very sad.

367
00:31:28,382 --> 00:31:29,442
So My mother asked him,

368
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:31,472
“Why are you sad, because of the gramophone?”

369
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,462
“No, I’m only sad because it seems he is a connoisseur of

370
00:31:35,582 --> 00:31:42,452
music, he has taken the gramophone but no records.”

371
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:46,582
So My mother said, “All right, what should we do?

372
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:50,402
Should we advertise in the newspaper that you take away

373
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:53,552
your records?”

374
00:31:55,492 --> 00:32:01,412
I mean, it's such a beauty, that even after so many years

375
00:32:01,522 --> 00:32:04,562
I am telling you and you are enjoying.

376
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:09,562
What a beautiful character it was of generosity.

377
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:15,372
But if you force it through religion,

378
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:20,342
through any such ideas that “you give up that, you give” –

379
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:23,352
don’t have to give up.

380
00:32:23,482 --> 00:32:27,482
You give up from within.

381
00:32:28,432 --> 00:32:32,462
If you are not attached to it, you have given up.

382
00:32:32,582 --> 00:32:36,402
That much should be there and if you all enjoy your

383
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:41,542
generosity and charity, nothing like it!

384
00:32:42,442 --> 00:32:46,542
I have known people who are very rich and all that,

385
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:51,382
but they lack generosity.

386
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,502
That is another quality of Kubera.

387
00:32:55,372 --> 00:32:58,532
He perhaps understand banking, perhaps.

388
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:03,392
That time there were no banks but I think must be,

389
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:06,372
because the way He manages banks, you know,

390
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:10,422
it seems to Me that He’s sitting on top of them,

391
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:15,352
and that’s why still in the banks there is no problem.

392
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:16,552
I don’t know.

393
00:33:17,422 --> 00:33:23,432
But He’s a very clever person,

394
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:27,562
very intelligent,

395
00:33:28,432 --> 00:33:30,452
very alert,

396
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:36,492
which is important if you have to deal with money –

397
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:42,392
though He was absolutely detached from money.

398
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:46,362
And just see His life, what He did.

399
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:51,382
He lived in childhood with His guru,

400
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:53,502
and He used to take

401
00:33:54,382 --> 00:34:03,462
what you call the cows and herds outside in the jungles.

402
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:11,472
That is how He lived in His childhood, and later on

403
00:34:14,362 --> 00:34:18,572
He was playing with the boys

404
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:23,572
who were looking after the cows in a very,

405
00:34:24,472 --> 00:34:27,412
I mean, ordinary family.

406
00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:34,462
He never hankered after money.

407
00:34:35,432 --> 00:34:36,572
He used to steal,

408
00:34:38,562 --> 00:34:44,362
used to steal the butter,

409
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:50,462
because these ladies used to sell these to Kamsa’s

410
00:34:54,462 --> 00:34:57,392
military people.

411
00:34:58,342 --> 00:35:00,442
So He used to eat that,

412
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:04,372
so that this lady should not give it to them.

413
00:35:04,512 --> 00:35:08,432
Just imagine, such a little boy like Him.

414
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:15,452
So actually, how He was teaching them a lesson.

415
00:35:16,342 --> 00:35:19,552
Those ladies were greedy, and wanted to give that

416
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:22,562
to these horrible soldiers,

417
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:28,412
and He would eat all that butter Himself.

418
00:35:28,522 --> 00:35:31,462
In everything that He did,

419
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:37,492
what you see is extreme generosity, extreme generosity.

420
00:35:39,342 --> 00:35:44,362
With all His intelligence He, He was so good.

421
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:52,542
And He killed

422
00:35:56,572 --> 00:36:00,552
His own uncle, I should say;

423
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:05,432
but for Him it is, was not important,

424
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:09,502
so-called relations were not important.

425
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:13,502
But what you see in our India specially,

426
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:16,522
that relations are very important.

427
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:21,472
The father is a thief, his son is thief, his grandson is a thief,

428
00:36:21,562 --> 00:36:26,432
all of them are thieves – can you imagine?

429
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:32,432
I haven’t seen in a family if there’s one person who is a thief,

430
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:37,352
any one his progeny are honest.

431
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:42,512
It’s a very funny thing, but such greed crawls into their minds

432
00:36:43,512 --> 00:36:47,492
that they don’t think is important.

433
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:53,492
They just think that stealing is the only way one can live.

434
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:58,532
Though in India there are people who are extremely honest.

435
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,422
I have seen our servants,

436
00:37:00,562 --> 00:37:03,522
they never steal anything, nothing, never.

437
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:06,552
I don’t know, they have no reasoning for it,

438
00:37:07,412 --> 00:37:09,392
it’s a matter of habit.

439
00:37:09,482 --> 00:37:14,562
They never steal anything – very surprising.

440
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:20,512
Why, why don’t they steal?

441
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:26,472
They’re happy with their lives, they don’t want to change it.

442
00:37:26,562 --> 00:37:32,352
They don’t want to have these horrible things

443
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:34,532
that can put them in jail.

444
00:37:35,382 --> 00:37:37,432
But they don’t know,

445
00:37:37,512 --> 00:37:42,342
they don’t even think about it; just they just don’t do it.

446
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:48,462
Why, because they have a sense of shame.

447
00:37:49,362 --> 00:37:52,572
In the poorer peoples, sense of shame is very,

448
00:37:53,412 --> 00:37:55,352
very developed.

449
00:37:55,442 --> 00:38:03,392
In that society they have a great respect for people who are

450
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:06,382
honest, and they are all honest.

451
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:10,582
One of them may be not,

452
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:14,582
but they have no respect for such a person,

453
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:20,552
because they think self-respect is the biggest thing.

454
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,432
Can you imagine these poor people?

455
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:28,462
They have food once a day,

456
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:32,452
but to them their self-respect is above everything.

457
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:38,532
So the third solution for this kind of a nonsensical greed is

458
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:42,572
your self-respect.

459
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,482
Why should you steal,

460
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:48,412
why should you have anything that is stolen,

461
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,532
or why should you have anything that belongs

462
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:53,482
to another person?

463
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:56,512
If you have that self-respect within you,

464
00:38:57,372 --> 00:39:02,422
you won’t touch anything that is not yours.

465
00:39:03,502 --> 00:39:06,552
When the servants can do that, why not people

466
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:11,402
who are not that badly off?

467
00:39:11,512 --> 00:39:17,372
It is a temperament of a higher level, I think,

468
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:20,392
which they develop, where their self-respect

469
00:39:20,512 --> 00:39:25,362
is much more important than all kinds of

470
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:29,462
other things that may satisfy their greed.

471
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:35,352
But one thing about greed is, it is never satisfied.

472
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:38,342
It is never satisfied.

473
00:39:38,452 --> 00:39:41,342
I’ve seen people who were very rich once upon a time,

474
00:39:41,442 --> 00:39:43,532
became very, very poor.

475
00:39:44,422 --> 00:39:47,412
So to them life has become hell.

476
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:53,392
They can’t live with, without their great,

477
00:39:54,502 --> 00:39:59,482
I should say, pomp and show,

478
00:40:00,352 --> 00:40:03,362
but they don’t understand that it was false.

479
00:40:03,512 --> 00:40:08,442
They just go on feeling extremely

480
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:13,492
downtrodden when they lose their money.

481
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:18,492
Then there are people who want to have money;

482
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:25,342
they’ll do anything but get money.

483
00:40:25,462 --> 00:40:31,492
It’s a very funny thing, but also power is the same as that.

484
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:34,492
If you have your own powers,

485
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:37,502
you don’t hanker after these powers.

486
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,572
But they want to have power because

487
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:44,492
they want to have money, and they get power with money –

488
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:46,462
can you imagine?

489
00:40:46,562 --> 00:40:49,562
Where are human beings, at what level?

490
00:40:50,422 --> 00:40:53,382
At what level of evolution they are?

491
00:40:53,472 --> 00:40:58,582
They are going round and round the circle of this money.

492
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:02,532
This is Nabhi Chakra

493
00:41:03,392 --> 00:41:05,432
which has to improve,

494
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,532
which gives you satisfaction.

495
00:41:09,402 --> 00:41:12,362
If your Nabhi Chakra is satisfied,

496
00:41:12,462 --> 00:41:16,442
you have achieved the state of Kubera.

497
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:20,342
That’s very important, to see

498
00:41:20,442 --> 00:41:24,572
that your Nabhi should be satisfied.

499
00:41:26,372 --> 00:41:29,412
There are so many other kinds of things we have,

500
00:41:29,532 --> 00:41:33,452
but I think now the worst is this greed.

501
00:41:33,562 --> 00:41:38,472
And this, if it is managed somehow or other,

502
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:41,472
brought to its own level,

503
00:41:41,572 --> 00:41:45,422
then I think world will improve very much.

504
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:47,352
May God bless you.
