00:00:00.686 --> 00:00:07.160
Yes, are such that so many seekers are born,&nbsp;
so many of them, they are really seekers.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.280
That’s a category, a category of human&nbsp;
beings who are seeking something beyond.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.680
It’s a fact, I mean there was&nbsp;
never such a time before that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.600
so many seekers were born on this earth.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.120
This word was used sometimes for one single&nbsp;
person or maybe about ten at the most but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.760
two thousand years back you could not&nbsp;
find so many seekers on this earth.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.960
I mean they are seekers.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.240
Why there is so much seeking&nbsp;
and why people are seeking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.320
why they have this temperament of seeking?

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.240
What is the reason?

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.280
There must be some reason for it and&nbsp;
as we all know in Sahaja Yoga that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.880
last judgment has started and the last&nbsp;
judgment is going to work out through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:59.280
the Kundalini awakening and everybody is&nbsp;
now trying to seek it some way or another.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:09.240
The whole pattern has worked out&nbsp;
in such a way that the seekers are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.320
born at this time and they have a background too.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.640
They are not just seekers today.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.400
I mean you were, as you know that you were&nbsp;
evolved, evolved from a unicellular animal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.760
and then now today you are a human being and there&nbsp;
are people who are human beings otherwise also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.480
same way as you are but you are&nbsp;
a category, no doubt about it.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.120
There is a category of people who&nbsp;
are seeking, not out of fashion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.840
out of just because in the atmosphere there&nbsp;
are many people selling their tickets but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.600
you are doing it because there is something&nbsp;
within you which forces you and impels you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.880
compels you completely, which propels you,&nbsp;
which makes you mad and you do not know why,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.960
what’s the matter within us and at this time&nbsp;
as you know there are lots of things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:20.360
have come up as in the market one has to supply&nbsp;
something plastic if there is too much demand.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.840
But as there is plastic there has to be&nbsp;
something absolute, there has to be truth.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.440
But what I find is this that lots&nbsp;
of words have some or other emerged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:43.440
out of all this plastic supply and&nbsp;
these words are extremely confusing.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.920
From where do these words come in?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.000
For example cosmic consciousness is one of the&nbsp;
very common words used, cosmic consciousness.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.600
From where does this word come in?

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.840
From where do you get the idea of all these&nbsp;
things and that also make people quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.200
vulnerable because they think these&nbsp;
are the words they never heard about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.560
you see something great, cosmic&nbsp;
consciousness, oh great thing.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.400
All these words have come from the scriptures.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.080
It was unfortunate or fortunate I&nbsp;
don’t know, it can work out both ways.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.400
That it was said that after&nbsp;
realization you will get this.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.440
Though little secret, secretive, it’s not&nbsp;
so open, so straightforward but still from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.720
all the scriptures, you see especially the&nbsp;
scriptures of the eastern world we can say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.960
India where the seers went very deep into&nbsp;
themselves, kept it as a secret throughout&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:59.720
till the time of I would say Shankaracharya the&nbsp;
sixth century, it’s quite modern for us in India.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.320
Never a word was uttered about Kundalini,&nbsp;
not this word was used except also by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.600
Markandeya who was there long time&nbsp;
back, much before Shankaracharya.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.160
But to people Kundalini was something unknown,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.640
something very much away from&nbsp;
the understanding of people.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.640
In the Vedas you see the primordial&nbsp;
Mother was called as E, E and that’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:40.600
why Kabira has used it as E Padar, means&nbsp;
the state of E, the primordial Mother.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.760
All this has been said in the Vedas, agreed&nbsp;
and is said again and again and then in other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.240
scriptures like Bible, Koran, everywhere it&nbsp;
is mentioned that you are to be born again.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.640
But one had to say that.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.760
Now one says that.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:12.360
Nothing was sort of a primitive idea or sort of&nbsp;
a crude idea or some sort of a imaginary idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.120
it was absolute, the truth, absolutely that.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.200
But when you just say even this&nbsp;
much that you are to be born again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.760
you see a very simple thing is&nbsp;
that you are to be born again.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.320
These people pick up this word that&nbsp;
you are to be born again, finished.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.120
They brand themselves as born&nbsp;
again, twice born people.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.080
Just [unclear].

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.240
There are cults and cults and cults who talk about&nbsp;
that you will be getting your self-realization.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.520
That is this is self-realization,&nbsp;
you must have this self-realization.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:55.440
And then with that other things also&nbsp;
come in like cosmic consciousness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.240
you achieve your cosmic consciousness.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.240
Now what is cosmic consciousness?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.480
It’s not written anywhere in the scriptures&nbsp;
that clearly what is cosmic consciousness.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:18.960
And it is very difficult for a seater&nbsp;
who is madly seeking not to get confused.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.360
Anybody would.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.920
Like they describe, you see when&nbsp;
you become cosmically conscious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.080
you become the tree, you become the mountain.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.640
Are you going to become now the dead things?

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.000
Use your brains when they tell you&nbsp;
these things, that you start becoming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:50.880
a cloud and then you becoming a tree and then&nbsp;
becoming a mountain and then becoming a stone.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.080
This is the idea of cosmic.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.960
You start everything, breathes and then talks.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.400
Yes it does, no doubt.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.400
But for that you have to be subtle.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.360
The gross understanding of a thing that you become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.280
identified with something else&nbsp;
that is much lower than you.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.200
You see this is the most important point,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:20.840
point we should know, that you get identified&nbsp;
with something which is much lower than you.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.800
All such ideas should be challenged by all people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.120
who have brains that how can&nbsp;
you become lower than you.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.120
For example somebody says, all&nbsp;
right you start jumping like a frog,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.800
a simple thing, very common it is in India.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.960
You see so many people they come and sit with&nbsp;
their feet towards Me and people tell them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.200
now you are not supposed to do that towards&nbsp;
Mother, you can’t put your feet towards Her.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.160
They said, what can we do?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.320
We’ll start jumping, if you don’t put feet like&nbsp;
this, we’ll suddenly start jumping like frogs.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.520
And then you tell them, how did you get this?

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.920
They said, one guru has awakened our&nbsp;
Kundalini and it is written in the book,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.440
there is a book written, you’ll be surprised.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.040
Where is they have said that you will start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.680
jumping like a frog when&nbsp;
the Kundalini is awakened.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.280
Actually there is a book written,&nbsp;
he is the guru of this fellow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.720
he is the guru, he is Saraswati Anand is his name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.440
the one who has written this one and I think&nbsp;
he is the guru, he is one of these persons.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:29.440
And he is regarded as a very&nbsp;
authentic book by people.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.960
And this kind of a thing is selling today that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.400
are going to become frogs and&nbsp;
you pay to become frogs now.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:50.160
We have to see with our understanding, with&nbsp;
our intelligence, how can you become frogs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.920
I mean is that the way God is going to&nbsp;
now take down to frog level, very simple.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.720
Or any one of such levels&nbsp;
has to make you a mountain.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.320
Why do you want to become a mountain now?

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.240
You have come out of that mountain,&nbsp;
you were a rat, then you were a monkey,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.840
you climbed over trees and today&nbsp;
you are on top of everything.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.200
Now you don’t become the same dead thing.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:26.520
And then you start believing&nbsp;
these stories and acting on it.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.960
It’s a very subtle thing one has to understand.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:37.840
It’s so cunning and so foxy.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.160
You do feel that way, you’ll&nbsp;
be surprised, you do feel it.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.680
You feel you are getting out of&nbsp;
this body, you are moving about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:52.000
you are going on top of all the places,&nbsp;
you are seeing things down below.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.640
You just start feeling that&nbsp;
you have become the mountain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.000
it’s breathing, this is breathing, that&nbsp;
is breathing and everything is pulsating,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.720
you start seeing all these&nbsp;
things, you start becoming that.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.080
How does a mountain breathe?

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.440
How does a molecule breathe?

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:21.800
Now we have here some scientists, they know&nbsp;
that there are electromagnetic waves within us.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:32.400
In the same way there are electromagnetic waves&nbsp;
in the, all the elements in the elements they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.400
have got, atoms and all the atoms have got these&nbsp;
electromagnetic waves and these electromagnetic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:43.200
waves make it pulsate, they are isometric,&nbsp;
symmetric and all sorts of pulsations are there.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:51.720
These pulsations are coming only from&nbsp;
electromagnetic action, only electromagnetic.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.880
Now see this, this is very&nbsp;
important to understand.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:03.960
Out of five elements electromagnetism,&nbsp;
so one of the elements is the light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:10.120
and another element is the magnet,&nbsp;
magnet comes from the Mother Earth.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:22.360
So out of these two elements only these atoms&nbsp;
start pulsating, that’s only a part of it, that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:32.040
you had before even, when you even had no life&nbsp;
you had electromagnetic vibrations within you.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:42.080
So you are not going to get those electromagnetic&nbsp;
vibrations, you are not going to feel them.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:49.920
But the Brahma Shakti, the power of Brahma,&nbsp;
the all pervading divine power of love is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.920 --> 00:12:01.840
not electromagnetic, it has got five elements, it&nbsp;
has got your emotional power, is the love of God,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:10.160
it has got your evolutionary power and all&nbsp;
the powers that has created you within itself.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:17.960
You are not only in electromagnetic,&nbsp;
are you only electromagnetic?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:26.320
All these synthesized in one is the Brahma&nbsp;
Shakti and that’s what you should get.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.000
Of course, I mean after realization&nbsp;
you will find that you find vibrations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:40.000
coming out of certain things, like&nbsp;
certain kind of coefficients is there.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.440
If I’ve touched something you&nbsp;
might get vibration from that also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.280
they catch My vibrations, they can transmit.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:55.920
But these vibrations are very different&nbsp;
from electromagnetic vibrations.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.400
You can record electromagnetic vibrations with&nbsp;
your limited machineries you have created,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:08.360
human machinery, but this you cannot record&nbsp;
is the synthesis, there is no analysis.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.480
You analyze all these electromagnetic things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.120
bring it to that level where you&nbsp;
can catch it when they are dead.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:24.040
You cannot analyze anything&nbsp;
that is living, how can you?

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.120
Even at the level of your intelligence you&nbsp;
are analyzing only the dead, not the living.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.720
You cannot analyze it, you have to&nbsp;
synthesize and when you synthesize,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:43.520
for example sitting in this room, see the&nbsp;
color, see the patterns and see the carpet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:49.440
and everything, the whole thing gives an aura&nbsp;
of some sort of a soothing feeling for yourself.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.800
How will you analyze it?

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.680
Is there any basis of analyzing&nbsp;
even this, the aesthetics,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.960
just the aesthetics you can [unclear] it.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:04.480
You don’t see through electromagnetic&nbsp;
fields, do you see that?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.520
Say in a drama or a play you go there.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.800
So there is an actor, there are stage and there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:18.360
are people sitting down to watch it&nbsp;
and the whole thing creates a mood.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.400
And this mood, can you analyze it?

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:29.680
Can you analyze Shakespearean mood&nbsp;
with your, I mean it exists no doubt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.360
it creates a mood no doubt,&nbsp;
it does within us, isn’t it?

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:45.720
But can you analyze with some machines, you&nbsp;
see this will create Shakespearean mood.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.760
I must say through meditative process&nbsp;
Indians have gone to a great extent to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.920
create moods out of certain things like what&nbsp;
words to be used to create a particular mood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.840
what time to be used, what tune&nbsp;
to be used, how to render it.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.480
You see even in Natya Shastras is&nbsp;
the drama, science of the drama.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.040
But still whatever it may say&nbsp;
that you should avoid these words,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:19.120
these are soft words, this will not&nbsp;
create the feeling of say a warrior,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.000
for that you have to use these words&nbsp;
with these accents and all that.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:33.240
With all that whatever you may do, the whole&nbsp;
creation of the whole thing depends on the artist.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.880
Now how will you analyze an artist?

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:41.320
For example a day before only I had&nbsp;
a very good time and I should say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:47.640
very good rendering of a very nice&nbsp;
raga called Puriya by some artist.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.160
Now this raga I have heard of so many&nbsp;
people play before this raga, so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.320
people are playing and some people just don’t&nbsp;
like it at all because rendering is difficult.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.920
But if it’s a master hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.440
I’ve never seen such a rendering before&nbsp;
the way it was rendered out by an artist.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:11.600
Now how do you analyze that artist&nbsp;
through your science or anything, can you?

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:17.080
Now this is even beyond that, that’s just a part,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:27.320
just again the part, the mood,&nbsp;
the thing that gives you a mood.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.920
What is the thing that gives you the mood?

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.880
There must be something within you which gives you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:44.560
the mood and that is what we&nbsp;
call as the Mahakali power.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.840
This power on the left hand side is&nbsp;
the one that gives you the moods.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:56.000
It could be any way, it could be your&nbsp;
own, could be from something that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.120
not your own, maybe some sort of a another&nbsp;
personality putting that impression in you.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.840
But deep down it is this side within you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:17.360
the left side is the Ida Nadi that gives&nbsp;
you the mood, that creates the mood.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:23.240
And the one that creates&nbsp;
the mood is the right side.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.200
The one that feels the mood is the left side.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.000
For example this artist is the one who uses the&nbsp;
right side power of action to create the mood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:46.040
for the left hand side to give you joy and to give&nbsp;
you peace and that total feeling of that creation.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.200
But now we have to go to the&nbsp;
mood of the God Almighty.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.860
He is in the mood of creation, think for&nbsp;
example, I mean let’s go to that point.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.440
So what does He do?

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.920
He has his own rhythms, He plays His&nbsp;
own rhythms, He plays his own tunes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:10.240
His waves and all that, He creates the things the&nbsp;
way He wants, it’s created in waves after waves.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.600
In His own joy and in His own mood&nbsp;
we should say, in His own fantasy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:23.200
in His own imagination, in His&nbsp;
own fondness, He is God Almighty.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.640
Who are we to ask Him questions, why&nbsp;
did you do this and why did you do that?

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:34.520
I mean we think we are all BBC interviewers.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.640
We go on asking questions to God&nbsp;
even, we cannot ask Him questions.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.440
He is beyond questions.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.960
So that’s how He creates the beauty for us.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:52.680
And then we try to analyse it, break all the&nbsp;
beauty and try to find out how can you do it?

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.360
You have to join in with His mood,&nbsp;
you have to become one with Him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:07.400
to feel Him within you and then you can feel in&nbsp;
that mood with which He has created those waves.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:16.520
Those waves which have all these powers within&nbsp;
itself which are tremendous, which are fantastic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:24.640
which are beyond your understanding but&nbsp;
you can emit them through your being,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:32.080
you can reflect them through your&nbsp;
spirit, you can reflect those waves.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:38.480
That’s what you have to achieve to become&nbsp;
into real cosmic consciousness you have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:51.240
become that by which you emit those waves of&nbsp;
God’s love which has created this universe.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.800
It’s a thing much beyond these&nbsp;
mountains and trees and things.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:05.720
Then what you feel is the vibrations of a&nbsp;
particular tree which has more vibrations.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:15.960
There’s a tree I’ve seen in Delhi which may&nbsp;
have been planted by a realised soul I’m sure.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:21.440
It’s a very queer type of a tree&nbsp;
which has got from four sides,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:28.640
see the trunk coming up like that, like&nbsp;
four sides and it has tremendous vibrations.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.280
Some trees have those vibrations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:47.920
some stones have those vibrations but&nbsp;
they are not aware of it while you are.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:57.960
These vibrations work it out, they act.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.840
They act through your attention.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.000
Wherever your attention&nbsp;
goes they go and act there.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.920
It is that tremendous.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:13.040
As the attention of God, wherever it goes it acts.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:18.200
In the same way when you&nbsp;
pay your attention it acts.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.440
That’s all what you have to become.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.400
You don’t have to become something that is there.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.880
Once you understand this principle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:38.320
this principle of your attainment you&nbsp;
will discard all that is nonsensical.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.600
Of course only the seekers are going&nbsp;
to come to Sahaja Yoga to begin with.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.800
Don’t worry about the non&nbsp;
seekers, just give them up.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.600
Have nothing to do with non seekers.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.480
Don’t break your necks with non seekers.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.680
Those who are seekers are only&nbsp;
going to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.400
Others may come just for curing,&nbsp;
getting cured or some sort of a thing.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:17.200
It’s like coming in the Kingdom of God which&nbsp;
is the wealthiest Kingdom, the highest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:27.240
the most dynamic, the most precious, the most&nbsp;
blissful to ask for something very cheap.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.480
But you get that also, that’s the minimum.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:38.640
But why not ask for the real, for the best.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:45.040
So it’s the seekers who have to realize&nbsp;
that this is what you have to seek.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.600
And not all these monkey tricks&nbsp;
into which people are putting you.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:55.480
Of course you cannot pay for it.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.560
It’s too great for you.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.840
It’s too much higher for you than you can get.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.960
You cannot purchase it.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:10.000
It is not under your control&nbsp;
that you can purchase it.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.280
Humble down yourself before thinking&nbsp;
of paying for anything like that.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:26.480
It’s the blessing of God, it’s the grace that&nbsp;
is going to come to us which we have to receive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:35.600
with thanksgiving because He has chosen us&nbsp;
to be in His Kingdom, to be in His love,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.280
to be protected, to be bestowed with all&nbsp;
that is His beauty and grandchildren.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.120
How can we pay for that?

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.280
People don’t understand such people.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.600
They can’t understand God, they can’t&nbsp;
understand such human beings also.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:55.520
Like a late gentleman came&nbsp;
to see Me and I was talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.360
to him and he liked a particular painting you see.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.980
And I said, all right you can have it.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.160
He said, for free?

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.760
Yes of course I did, if you like it it’s all&nbsp;
right because I had done it so I can do many more.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.680
I said, all right you can have it if you like it.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.000
Then he got frightened of Me, he said,&nbsp;
how can that be this something absurd,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.600
how can that maybe give&nbsp;
something for nothing at all?

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:21.360
There’s something wrong&nbsp;
fishy about it, he ran away.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:28.360
They can’t believe in a person who can give&nbsp;
something for nothing because nothing can get it.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:38.680
This is a very, very simple fact about the&nbsp;
truth that you cannot pay for the truth.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.920
Truth exists whether you pay&nbsp;
for it or not, it will exist.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:48.040
That’s why it is the truth.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:54.400
You have to accept that with&nbsp;
thanksgiving, with grace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.760
with joy, with such a feeling&nbsp;
of glorification about yourself.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.280
You must see your own glory&nbsp;
about your own dignity being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:08.760
glorified that it has been bestowed upon you.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.600
But when you get it also you&nbsp;
are not sure of yourself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.440
you start seeing it, is it true, let’s analyze.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.720
Sit down now, why should I get it?

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.200
Oh I got it, no doubt.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.920
But there must be something wrong about it.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:35.040
It’s something silly I think, to waste&nbsp;
your energy except for analyzing.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:48.640
You are all seekers I know and I will&nbsp;
never say that you came here just to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.600
just to be here and not to take anything.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.440
But the ego part you haven’t&nbsp;
left out with your shoes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.720
that catches you as soon as you put&nbsp;
on your shoes, it suddenly comes out.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.080
Then you start analyzing.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.840
It’s like if I give you a cake, I mean this is&nbsp;
not a cake but it is a cake, I don’t know of what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:15.680
should I say, a cake that tastes very well, is&nbsp;
valuable more than gold or anything in this world.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.560
Such a cake I cannot describe and then you go out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:28.400
cut it out and see that if it is anything&nbsp;
near what you expected, start analyzing.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.640
And that’s how many Sahaja Yogis who&nbsp;
come to our program also get lost.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:39.200
Moreover Sahaja Yoga itself&nbsp;
is called today as Mahayoga.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.000
It has a great attraction power but in the&nbsp;
same way there is another force working,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.560
the centrifugal and the centripetal forces.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.120
Both are equal and opposite, which&nbsp;
throws away people very fast.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.720
The way it catches the wind, can throw away.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:05.880
So the first seven days I think are the most&nbsp;
important things for people to study themselves.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:16.400
It gives you a good chance to understand&nbsp;
that God has to give you this because you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:27.080
are the culmination of His creation,&nbsp;
that He has to save His creation.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:42.520
He’s doing it out of His boundless love and&nbsp;
you do not try to limit it by your analysis.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.880
Gradually the whole thing&nbsp;
will come to you very clearly.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.480
Don’t lose it by your analysis.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.960
Whatever you analyzed so far, where did you go?

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.480
You don’t get your vibrations by analysis.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.600
If you start analyzing&nbsp;
you’ll never get vibrations.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:06.920
That’s why first I put you out of this&nbsp;
point so you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.160
Just now you are thoughtless, there’s no thought.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.480
That’s the best way.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.800
You put them out of thought.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.040
You see if you bring them here&nbsp;
you become thoughtlessly aware and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.720
then break the Sahastrara so&nbsp;
then you can feel it better.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:27.680
Because if you are thinking if the Sahastrara&nbsp;
was lower than Agnya I could not have managed it.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.480
One had to put this Agnya chakra at a lower level.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:37.440
That’s why Christ had to come before&nbsp;
I could come on this earth to create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:52.520
this Agnya chakra that it could&nbsp;
suck your thinking and your ego.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:58.040
Now we have before us a big&nbsp;
task, a tremendous task.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.440
As you know that thousands are getting drowned,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.920
they are seekers and only&nbsp;
the seekers are attacked.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.560
Those who are not seekers are very&nbsp;
nicely sitting down having a nice time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:18.720
say might be in a pub or&nbsp;
maybe in a casino, so called.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:24.840
Of course these are as I know is advertising&nbsp;
departments for the hell, no doubt.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.400
But they’ll finish off there.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:42.520
But those who are seekers for whom the whole&nbsp;
creation is waiting to welcome are lost.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:52.400
And I have to tell you that this is very&nbsp;
important to understand that everyone of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:58.040
you who has got Realization has to establish&nbsp;
the Realization and has to save those people.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:13.680
And I’m sure very soon we’ll find Sahaja Yoga&nbsp;
prospering in England, which is very important.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:19.160
The lethargy must be given up, the&nbsp;
lethargy of the people is very important.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:27.960
Don’t get involved into smaller things of life,&nbsp;
like Sahaja Yogis also can tend to be like that.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.280
For example, I know one gentleman&nbsp;
who came here from Australia.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.240
When he was in England he never&nbsp;
wrote a letter to his mother for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:44.160
I don’t know twelve years or so,&nbsp;
he never cared for her, not at all.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.720
And when he got into Sahaja Yoga&nbsp;
suddenly he started remembering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:53.360
her and thinking bad about it and all&nbsp;
that, he started writing letters to her.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.360
Then he went to Australia, we lost him completely&nbsp;
and he’s lost with his mother, finished.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.640
The whole balance is gone.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:08.880
It happens to people.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.760
In Australia there was a lady who never had a&nbsp;
child and she came to Me, they say she is now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:19.880
pregnant, and now I have the report that she’s so&nbsp;
enamoured by that, that she doesn’t do anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:26.120
but to think of the child and make the clothes and&nbsp;
things for the child and she’s running about that.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:32.040
She has nothing else left&nbsp;
now to do for Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.120
One can get lost into things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.200
even in Sahaja Yoga, so be careful these&nbsp;
are temptations at the subtle level.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:45.880
Your heart opens out sometimes so much&nbsp;
that you start getting again misidentified.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.440
Indians have another problems,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.040
they are too much attached to their&nbsp;
children, to their mother, father.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.920
When they come I have to give realization to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.680
the whole family to three generation&nbsp;
upward and three generation downward.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.840
Otherwise they’ll be always bringing out, my&nbsp;
father is like this, my mother is like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.480
my brother is like this, all of&nbsp;
them I have to give realization.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.160
Otherwise any third, fourth&nbsp;
generation dies somewhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.520
they’ll say, Mother see I came to&nbsp;
Sahaja Yoga and he’s dead there.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.560
I say, did he come to Me?

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.840
So this is another style.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:21.440
When they come to Sahaja Yoga, you see, they start&nbsp;
becoming unaware of this kind of an attachment to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.920
the people because they see they are not realized&nbsp;
souls, nor that they are seekers they are placed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:32.680
among all strangers there, they don’t understand&nbsp;
their language and they become quite aware of it.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:38.440
So they start becoming, you see, detached.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.600
They can go to another extreme also.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.040
You see they can become&nbsp;
very clear if they want to.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:54.560
Sahaja Yoga has the way to push you&nbsp;
towards your subtle life, your subtle self,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:54.560 --> 00:33:03.040
the Spirit but you have not to stick on to all&nbsp;
these misidentifications, like sympathy, you see.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.760
In England is a very common disease of sympathy.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.880
Sympathy is to share pathos.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:17.920
If you want to share pathos,&nbsp;
better be sympathetic.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.580
Whom are you sympathizing?

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.640
You see compassion is different from sympathy.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.960
In compassion you can even kill the person.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.000
Yes, you can.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.920
You can hit the person nicely.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.560
As Christ did Himself, was there&nbsp;
anybody greater than Him in compassion?

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.000
He couldn’t bear the way&nbsp;
the churches were running,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.920
He took a hunter in His hand,&nbsp;
started whipping all the people.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:43.360
It hurts.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.800
So the compassion is to be understood and not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:57.720
the sympathy for things which are to&nbsp;
be shared, is the blessings of God.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:06.240
And once you start understanding this,&nbsp;
then you will stand in the center,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:13.152
where you are compassioned, the&nbsp;
compassion flows through you, flows.

00:34:13.152 --> 00:34:18.240
You are attached to your&nbsp;
compassion, it just flows.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.680
You don’t expect anything out of it.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.840
It radiates.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:36.640
It gives that bliss, that joy, that&nbsp;
happiness, which the Divine is supposed to do.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.560
It doesn’t judge you the way we&nbsp;
understand judging through rationality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:48.280
but it judges you by its own balancing.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:54.200
That’s how you have to become, you&nbsp;
have to become those radiators.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.640
It’s a very great thing for&nbsp;
some people to become that.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:03.640
I think it’s not difficult at&nbsp;
all if you understand how you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:11.160
got your realization without any difficulties.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:17.240
And in the same way if you realize&nbsp;
how you have to go further.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:26.680
So be careful about the temptations that come&nbsp;
even after Sahaja Yoga, the misidentification,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.200
the oscillations from one point to another.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:35.680
Going from one extreme to another extreme.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.960
If we all understand this, that we are not to pay&nbsp;
attention only to our own chakras catching this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.840
analyzing, sitting down, oh I’m catching on this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:48.200
I’m catching on that, morning till evening&nbsp;
doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.640
Forget it.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.160
You are useless if you are&nbsp;
still analyzing yourself.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.240
You are not to analyze yourself.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.640
You have become a whole personality.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:08.440
If you are recording something just know&nbsp;
that you have to record, that’s all.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:13.240
All these things I’ve been&nbsp;
telling you in My own way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:25.600
perhaps I’ve not been able to really make that&nbsp;
progress in England as I thought it to be.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:39.080
As I was thinking about because of lethargy to&nbsp;
record, register what I’m saying and to act.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.520
One listens from this ear and takes&nbsp;
out from the same, doesn’t even allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:49.240
to go through the head to come out of the&nbsp;
other, then it’s not going to help you see.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.840
Of course the vibrations work out lots of&nbsp;
things, the Kundalini comes and she works out.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:59.440
But this brain is first enlightened you know&nbsp;
in Sahaja Yoga, it’s the first the brain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:08.080
first the Brahma randra&nbsp;
breaks here, then the heart.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:16.800
So in the brain one has to realize that the&nbsp;
whole thing should be registered first of all.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:22.240
The whole deliberations must come&nbsp;
from your brain to begin with.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.520
The whole thing is absolutely logical&nbsp;
after realization if you see it.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.720
Once you accept it logically you will stick on to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:38.000
it very well and then put it to&nbsp;
your heart but do not analyze it.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.520
Logical way of looking at things is this way,&nbsp;
yes it has worked, it is going to work out.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.920
It has solved this problem, it’s&nbsp;
going to solve all the other problems.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.160
Now you can sit down and analyze,&nbsp;
oh it has solved my problem this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:57.040
way all right now but could be that&nbsp;
and could be this, then you are gone.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:03.200
This kind of attitude towards Sahaja&nbsp;
Yoga is very injurious to your progress.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:09.160
Just see how far you have gone and&nbsp;
how far you have to go than to just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:14.000
go on criticizing yourself and blaming&nbsp;
yourself and bringing yourself down.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
After all you got it because&nbsp;
you are a special category,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.640
because you are seekers so I&nbsp;
have to do it for you, I mean it.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.440
It has to be done, one has to do it.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.760
You deserve it.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.400
So why go on criticizing yourself&nbsp;
all the time with this brain which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.520
is used to analysis, how can you analyze yourself?

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.040
How do you analyze your&nbsp;
realization I don’t understand.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.200
Why did you get your&nbsp;
realization, can you analyze it?

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.400
Can you?

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.320
Anyone of you?

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.240
In the same way one should not&nbsp;
analyze whatever you are getting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.680
go on accepting it, taking more and more.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.280
You have to have it.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.120
You receive back, you turn&nbsp;
your back to the Divine.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.840
If you go on criticizing yourself all the&nbsp;
time, oh why did I do it, why should I do it.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.600
The only disease you people have is&nbsp;
the left vishuddhi which is you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.680
feeling guilty about something&nbsp;
that doesn’t exist now anymore.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:15.920
Enter into the present,&nbsp;
forget the past, forget it.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:25.600
That will take you to another dimension&nbsp;
which is to be avoided completely.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.360
Not to feel guilty.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.240
Be cheerful.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:33.440
You have to have a very cheerful&nbsp;
disposition after Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.680
Do not analyze yourself.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:42.720
As I have told you by analysis you’ll go&nbsp;
up to the point of electromagnetic level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:50.240
where you’ll be just pulsating&nbsp;
like that, paramecium you see.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:56.800
You are a human being specially created, so&nbsp;
beautiful, so try to understand yourself.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.200
Try to understand yourself.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:04.560
There’s no word which can tell you.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.120
If I say feel that means it can be any nonsense.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.040
If I say think it can be another nonsense.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:21.480
But to be, to be that is the point, to be that.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.560
Just to be that is the&nbsp;
enjoyment and the happiness.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.440
Thank you very much.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.040
May God bless you.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.000
I see some faces smiling for the change.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.980
Would not smile, even I certified&nbsp;
that worth smiling it is.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:48.120
You see it is very certified, still they&nbsp;
wouldn’t smile at any cost, you see.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.880
Like Shakespeare describes.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.240
All right, let’s have the [unclear].

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.240
Close your eyes.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:49.200
Close your eyes.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.880
Just keep your eyes shut.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.960
That’s important because as you&nbsp;
know that Kundalini doesn’t rise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.520
above Agnya or Hamsa Chakra&nbsp;
if the eyes are not shut.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:14.880
So keep your eyes shut.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.880
Whatever your category is according&nbsp;
to human understanding, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:23.400
whatever race, whatever intelligence,&nbsp;
whatever type of profession you have,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.680
whatever it is, it’s not important to Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:43:27.120
The category is only one that you are serious.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:51.920
You don’t have to think what things you&nbsp;
have done wrong or anything, please.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.600
Don’t count all these things.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.040
Just forget it, just forget it.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:26.960
The time has come for you to have&nbsp;
it and you are going to have it.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.760
Let your attention be loose, absolutely.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.640
Don’t put it anywhere.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.760
Do not concentrate at any point.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.720
Just let it be loose, it will work out.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:26.920
The Kundalini has to rise.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.840
Now you have to say that God is&nbsp;
the doer, He does everything.

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.480
Till you are Self-realized you&nbsp;
will not know that He is the doer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:10.000
see, because you have not seen His doing.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:22.160
If you just say that He is the doer, not&nbsp;
me, I am not the doer, but I am the Spirit.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.760
He works it out through your Spirit.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:43.360
He is the one who gives you&nbsp;
the capacity to love also.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:48.600
He gives you the capacity to evolve.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:57.200
And He is the one who acts for it.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:11.800
So if you are the Spirit you&nbsp;
become the witness of His play.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:22.920
Hmm.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.200
Because you are a seeker you have to respect&nbsp;
yourself and love yourself and be kind to yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:32.600
and there has to be no awe because I love&nbsp;
you much more than you love yourselves.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.760
I can prove it to you.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:56.640
So there should be no awe about Me.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.254
Hmm.

00:49:58.254 --> 00:50:10.480
That’s better now.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:17.960
Those who have come for the first time, are&nbsp;
you feeling cool vibrations, any one of you?

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.480
Are you feeling cool in the hand?

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:19.840
Good.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.280
Are you?

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.240
Yes, no.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.680
The one who is not feeling please&nbsp;
raise your hands first of all.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.160
Raise it higher, higher.

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.800
Yes, yes.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.440
Just can you have a look at&nbsp;
them and those who are feeling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:37.080
first of all those who are&nbsp;
not feeling just see them.

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.880
One, two, three, four.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:41.880
Yes.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:51.600
Can you come and do please&nbsp;
keep your hands up there.

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.000
Please let them see that if&nbsp;
you are feeling it [unclear].

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.240
It’s important that you should feel it.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.600
Actually all those who have come&nbsp;
for the first time raise your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.440
hands is the best way so they can also judge it.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.120
All of you who have come for the first time.

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.800
Is she feeling the cool breeze?

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.000
Are you?

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.560
You are feeling your aura.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.400
What about her?

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:18.360
No?

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.720
All right.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.920
Feeling good, good.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.280
Keep it like that.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:22.640
Good.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.800
You are feeling it too.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.080
Now also those who are feeling&nbsp;
it just see them, the centers.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.160
You have to have them.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.760
Those who have come for the first&nbsp;
time ask them to sit here in front.

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:44.320
Please, be seated.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.480
Good.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:52.320
Now is it all right?

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.560
Close your eyes.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.920
Working now.

00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:01.840
Left to the right, left to the right.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:07.880
All right.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.360
What do you say?

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:15.114
No, right to the left.

00:52:15.114 --> 00:52:16.320
Is it all right?

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:27.520
But still.

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.920
Please watch here.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.760
Don’t watch others.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.120
All right.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:48.840
Just watch Me.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.520
What about these people that&nbsp;
have come for the first time?

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.200
Have you?

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:52.520
All right.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.600
Please be seated.

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.320
They will look after you.

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:55.920
Sit down.

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.200
Just put your hands towards Me.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.840
Watch them.

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.960
First of all you must see&nbsp;
which side is higher and lower.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.800
You see?

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.520
Just see for which side is higher and lower.

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.360
Give them a balance.

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:11.200
First of all you must judge.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.920
You watch Me here.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.080
It’s all right.

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.560
Left to the right.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.760
I will not.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.080
Right to the left.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:26.440
I’m sorry.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.280
You’ve been to some guru or someone before.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:30.680
Have you?

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.920
Never been.

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.480
Or to some sort of a spiritualist or something.

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:48.640
Never been.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.640
Are you a Catholic?

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.800
Have you been to a Catholic?

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.200
I mean have you been a Catholic?

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.440
It’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.440
all right.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:06.040
Now are you a Protestant or what?

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:06.840
Then what are you?

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:11.680
Never believed in God or never&nbsp;
believed in any such things.

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:15.760
Never.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.760
But there is God, isn’t it?

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.280
I mean you don’t believe in God at all.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:26.360
Didn’t think of Him.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.200
You felt that there is something beyond or not.

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.320
That’s the point.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:30.840
You did.

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.000
You did feel, isn’t it?

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.360
After all you are a seeker, you are a born seeker.

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.200
And if you have discarded all&nbsp;
these things it’s sensible also.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.600
So it’s quite foolish there sometimes.

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.240
Ha.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.760
Is it?

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.560
Is he all right?

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.400
Are you all right?

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:46.600
Now don’t doubt.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.320
He’s there.

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:47.960
All right?

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.400
Don’t doubt.

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.400
What about him?

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:53.800
Right.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.640
Right to the left.

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.320
Right to the left.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.200
Forgive.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:04.600
Forgive.

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.480
You must forgive.

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:06.160
Forgive people.

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:06.520
All right?

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.000
Just say.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.680
Oh you are very good.

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.080
For?

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.200
Oh they are very good people.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.080
They have come from Paris.

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.040
What?

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:27.320
You happen to meet all&nbsp;
seekers of the world somehow?

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:29.400
Now how is this gentleman?

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:34.080
Are you all right?

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.560
Have you been to some guru whatsoever?

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:42.060
Have you been to some guru?

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:46.840
T.M.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:48.000
Put your right hand like this.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.360
All right?

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:48.960
Left hand also.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.760
Right hand also.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.240
Ah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.040
feeling anything?

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.240
Put your hands still.

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.280
Feeling?

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:29.960
Some movement.

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.560
Very subtle.

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:33.840
All right?

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.720
What about him?

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.960
Very good.

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:48.000
Yes.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:56.040
Right to the left.

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.400
That you have to be careful now.

00:56:58.168 --> 00:57:01.440
Lots of things have to be done to clear it out.

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:07.696
Can you put him right to the left?

00:57:07.696 --> 00:57:07.720
Right to the left.
Yes.

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.120
Yes?

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:12.651
Right to the left.

00:57:12.651 --> 00:57:15.140
And Narakasura is [unclear].
What about him?

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.840
Clear?

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.760
Left side.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:24.600
Left to the right and this also.

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.160
How are you?

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:26.960
All right?

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.200
Better now.

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:31.360
When you came you were not all right.

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.420
You must do meditation.

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.600
You must clear out yourself.

00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.240
How is she?

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.840
Will you please remove her agnya?

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:44.640
Clearly I would love to see.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.760
Just a little more.

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.840
Can you.

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:52.680
On that side also.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.240
She has Ekadasha Rudra All right.
Say the mantra and it will work.

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.440
Just put the thing little bit.

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:58.240
Have you got any?

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.600
Can you give her a clip or something?

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:10.160
Have you any got a clip or&nbsp;
something just to see her ekadasha?

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:12.400
You been to some guru?

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.280
That side, this side, this side.

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:20.840
Have you been to any guru or anyone?

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.440
What she say?

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:26.120
You?

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.840
She saw Me.

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:50.800
Where?

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:06.200
She never went to anybody else before that.

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:09.560
She has ekadasha rudra somehow.

00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:14.560
But have you been reading about things like that?

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:16.880
Hmm, that’s it.

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.920
That’s how it’s all accommodated here.

00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:20.120
A little.

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:20.440
That’s all.

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.680
It will work out, no problem.

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.560
Just see the mantra.

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:26.040
It will work out.

00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.600
Let him put his.

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.080
Is he feeling anything in the hand?

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.000
Huh?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.160
Warm.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:23.640
Put your left hand on the stomach, this&nbsp;
side, little this side, on the liver.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.960
Ah, now better.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.760
Cooler now?

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.480
In the hand.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.680
The coolness.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.720
Is it cooler now?

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720
Try to see.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.320
Try to see.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.320
It’s very subtle.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:35.880
See.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.440
So, left to the right you just put it.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.040
What work do you do?

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.360
Huh?

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:48.040
You are studying what?

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.880
I know.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:55.920
Biology.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.280
Better.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:12.480
Biology.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.920
Now don’t start thinking.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.840
Just don’t start thinking otherwise it’ll stop.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:17.400
All right?

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.680
What about this gentleman?

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.600
Ask him to watch Me here.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.360
Are you feeling anything in the hand?

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:25.820
Bad Vishuddhi.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.240
Just put your bandhan on&nbsp;
your Vishuddhi He is good.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.520
But don’t feel guilty about it.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:31.880
That’s all.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.280
All right?

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.400
That one thing is not allowed&nbsp;
in Sahaja Yoga to feel guilty.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.560
Don’t start and think you&nbsp;
have done anything wrong.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:48.840
That’s it.
