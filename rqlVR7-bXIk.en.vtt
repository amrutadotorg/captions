00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:09.089
You are singing so beautifully.

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:22.089
It seems your heart has opened after this Puja very much

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.463
and you’re singing like small children now.

00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:43.755
So sort of, all the conditionings we have had, all the ego also there,

00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:51.838
it seems now you have become very pure all these problems have gone away

00:01:01.797 --> 00:01:04.463
and you are enjoying yourselves.

00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:12.963
This is the best way, when we love ourselves,

00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:16.171
we know ourselves we become love.

00:01:27.047 --> 00:01:34.630
Because of so many pressures on us and so many norms we’ve got,

00:01:42.713 --> 00:01:45.089
which are artificial,

00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:52.880
and we think only if outside we are alright, it’s alright;

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:06.963
but truth flowing from within is so joyous.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.296
You feel your capacity to love itself is so joyous,

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:29.755
and capacity to give is also so joyous.

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:43.630
So the Shiva Puja meant that you become love and feel the joy of love.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.546
You see when you love someone, if you love your child,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.963
you’re not bothered as to how it looks or how it appears,

00:03:07.047 --> 00:03:08.671
you just love.

00:03:18.963 --> 00:03:25.213
And if you try to be attentive to somebody because his appearance is good

00:03:25.296 --> 00:03:29.089
or he’s superficially good, or his manners are good,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.089
after some time you’ll be deceiving yourself.

00:03:45.588 --> 00:03:50.797
But if your inner being is beautiful

00:03:51.922 --> 00:03:57.047
then you will be happy with yourself first of all;

00:04:05.505 --> 00:04:09.254
because the source of joy is from within yourself.

00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.546
You do not get it from others.

00:04:19.588 --> 00:04:27.380
So to cleanse yourself and to be open is the best way to enjoy life.

00:04:38.338 --> 00:04:42.005
Some people may laugh at you, some may make fun of you,

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:44.170
some may try to trouble you;

00:04:51.463 --> 00:04:55.254
but most of them will love you, because you are so pure,

00:04:59.922 --> 00:05:04.171
and you will be yourself at peace with yourself.

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:15.505
So the best thing is to have introspection to see yourself,

00:05:15.588 --> 00:05:17.755
whether you are love or not.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.130
Like some people are conditioned

00:05:32.254 --> 00:05:35.671
and they want that this should be like this that should be like this,

00:05:35.755 --> 00:05:39.797
it should have been there, we should do this we should do that,

00:05:49.338 --> 00:05:53.630
we should organise like this, we should cook like this;

00:05:53.713 --> 00:05:58.838
I mean conditionings are there that according to them that’s something good.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.047
And if that doesn’t happen then they are unhappy.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.170
And some are right sided egoistical, they want to dominate others,

00:06:25.213 --> 00:06:28.963
if they cannot dominate then they are unhappy, they are angry.

00:06:41.296 --> 00:06:43.546
So they are miserable,

00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:48.630
so they make others miserable also.

00:06:51.213 --> 00:06:56.296
So the first type which is left sided makes himself miserable,

00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:59.797
while the second type makes others miserable.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.797
But both are wrong.

00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:19.546
You have no business to make yourself miserable,

00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:28.171
because God has created you to be joyous and happy.

00:07:34.296 --> 00:07:41.463
So one should only know that you have to be the Spirit.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.005
So all these conditionings will drop out, ego will drop out.

00:07:58.254 --> 00:08:03.963
But when we talk of Spirit we always think of something very dry.

00:08:12.922 --> 00:08:19.880
No it’s not at all, it is absolutely Love, Spirit is Love.

00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:28.380
You can say the light of Spirit is Love.

00:08:32.338 --> 00:08:38.089
So it is important to understand that it’s the love only

00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:42.963
that is emitting from your heart that will give joy to you.

00:08:51.047 --> 00:08:58.005
Look at other people as you have to give them love.

00:09:08.797 --> 00:09:13.254
You’ll feel very powerful and the ‘bhoots’ and all the ‘badhas’ will run away.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.296
Once you decide that I have to just love others,

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:34.713
all the conditioning will drop out.
