00:09.093 --> 00:12.908
So we are with the nature here.

00:13.228 --> 00:14.646
So beautiful.

00:27.491 --> 00:30.989
The way it is planned you can see how the person who’s planned it

00:31.069 --> 00:34.842
had the feel of the land, feel of the nature.

00:34.922 --> 00:41.358
How he is made up, by not destroying it.

00:41.438 --> 00:44.870
Whatever is there he used it,

00:45.657 --> 00:49.973
otherwise they would have put one bulldozer and finished it off.

00:51.939 --> 00:56.946
But the way it is planned shows he had feeling for the land

00:57.066 --> 00:58.533
and he could understand.

01:00.093 --> 01:04.466
The way we look at nature also, is our own.

01:04.579 --> 01:08.067
The way we are inside, that’s how we look at nature.

01:08.234 --> 01:13.176
Nature is our friend absolutely; it’s working for us all the time.

01:13.257 --> 01:15.900
And we don’t do much for it.

01:17.800 --> 01:26.566
Look at these trees. They give shade, they give fruits.

01:26.733 --> 01:30.826
Whatever is possible for them, they do it.

01:31.352 --> 01:36.466
And when they are old, use them for wood.

01:37.736 --> 01:40.976
All supportive to our life.

01:42.054 --> 01:44.841
But we must have feeling; otherwise,

01:44.921 --> 01:48.986
what’s happening today is this ecological problem.

01:57.999 --> 02:04.576
And this is because we do not have any feeling for the Mother Earth.

02:05.230 --> 02:08.158
No feeling for the nature.

02:08.964 --> 02:15.900
We are really plundering them and then the whole thing reacts.

02:21.087 --> 02:25.468
It’s a kind of an aggression that

02:30.482 --> 02:34.336
you want to have so many things at the same time.

02:35.923 --> 02:39.104
Like that, you see, moving from one to another,

02:39.189 --> 02:42.829
having too many things of no value.

02:43.476 --> 02:49.059
So the Sahaja yogis should understand that we are friends of the nature.

02:49.199 --> 02:53.056
And whatever nature gives us, we have to respect it.

02:53.631 --> 02:58.416
Better wear natural clothes as far as possible.

02:59.455 --> 03:06.269
One natural shirt is better than three unnatural ones,

03:06.349 --> 03:11.619
because you can breathe better, your skin
breathes better, you can wash it better.

03:11.699 --> 03:14.366
So best is to take to more natural things.

03:14.473 --> 03:17.572
I think this trend is coming up,

03:17.659 --> 03:22.972
and that’s a very good trend, that we should take to natural things.

03:23.052 --> 03:28.348
And when we take to natural things, there’s one thing we cannot have too many of it.

03:29.448 --> 03:36.514
But if you start using something plastic, then there can be any number

03:36.594 --> 03:40.987
and that’s how you really torture the Mother Earth.

03:41.068 --> 03:46.198
First of all, you dig her out. Then you wear all these things.

03:47.089 --> 03:49.653
And they cannot be destroyed.

03:50.111 --> 03:52.869
There are mountains and mountains.

03:52.950 --> 03:56.708
Mountains and mountains of this plastic if you go in America.

03:56.789 --> 04:01.397
Even in England I’ve seen mountains, such a filthy sight.

04:01.478 --> 04:07.406
They can’t burn it. If you put it in the sea, it floats.

04:07.633 --> 04:15.573
And wherever you go near all these so-called very big cities,

04:16.247 --> 04:23.776
if you see the sea from the airplane you find all littered up completely.

04:24.999 --> 04:34.543
So we are spoiling our beaches, we are spoiling our homes and wasting our money.

04:36.199 --> 04:40.592
So these entrepreneurs have no feelings for the nature.

04:41.732 --> 04:44.470
They never think what nature is like.
