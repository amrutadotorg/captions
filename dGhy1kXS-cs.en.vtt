00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:12.908
So we are with the nature here.

00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:14.646
So beautiful.

00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:30.989
The way it is planned you can see how the person who’s planned it

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.842
had the feel of the land, feel of the nature.

00:00:34.922 --> 00:00:41.358
How he is made up, by not destroying it.

00:00:41.438 --> 00:00:44.870
Whatever is there he used it,

00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:49.973
otherwise they would have put one bulldozer and finished it off.

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:56.946
But the way it is planned shows he had feeling for the land

00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.533
and he could understand.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:04.466
The way we look at nature also, is our own.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.067
The way we are inside, that’s how we look at nature.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:13.176
Nature is our friend absolutely; it’s working for us all the time.

00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:15.900
And we don’t do much for it.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:26.566
Look at these trees. They give shade, they give fruits.

00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:30.826
Whatever is possible for them, they do it.

00:01:31.352 --> 00:01:36.466
And when they are old, use them for wood.

00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:40.976
All supportive to our life.

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:44.841
But we must have feeling; otherwise,

00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:48.986
what’s happening today is this ecological problem.

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:04.576
And this is because we do not have any feeling for the Mother Earth.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.158
No feeling for the nature.

00:02:08.964 --> 00:02:15.900
We are really plundering them and then the whole thing reacts.

00:02:21.087 --> 00:02:25.468
It’s a kind of an aggression that

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:34.336
you want to have so many things at the same time.

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:39.104
Like that, you see, moving from one to another,

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.829
having too many things of no value.

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:49.059
So the Sahaja yogis should understand that we are friends of the nature.

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:53.056
And whatever nature gives us, we have to respect it.

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:58.416
Better wear natural clothes as far as possible.

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:06.269
One natural shirt is better than three unnatural ones,

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.619
because you can breathe better, your skin
breathes better, you can wash it better.

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.366
So best is to take to more natural things.

00:03:14.473 --> 00:03:17.572
I think this trend is coming up,

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.972
and that’s a very good trend, that we should take to natural things.

00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:28.348
And when we take to natural things, there’s one thing we cannot have too many of it.

00:03:29.448 --> 00:03:36.514
But if you start using something plastic, then there can be any number

00:03:36.594 --> 00:03:40.987
and that’s how you really torture the Mother Earth.

00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:46.198
First of all, you dig her out. Then you wear all these things.

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:49.653
And they cannot be destroyed.

00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:52.869
There are mountains and mountains.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.708
Mountains and mountains of this plastic if you go in America.

00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:01.397
Even in England I’ve seen mountains, such a filthy sight.

00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:07.406
They can’t burn it. If you put it in the sea, it floats.

00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:15.573
And wherever you go near all these so-called very big cities,

00:04:16.247 --> 00:04:23.776
if you see the sea from the airplane you find all littered up completely.

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:34.543
So we are spoiling our beaches, we are spoiling our homes and wasting our money.

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.592
So these entrepreneurs have no feelings for the nature.

00:04:41.732 --> 00:04:44.470
They never think what nature is like.
