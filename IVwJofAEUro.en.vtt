00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:24.594
Today we are celebrating in Switzerland

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:29.469
the coronation of Shri Rama on Dassera Day.

00:04:31.553 --> 00:04:34.511
Many things happened on Dassera Day.

00:04:34.678 --> 00:04:36.511
The most important was

00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:42.636
that Shri Rama was “coronated”

00:04:44.302 --> 00:04:47.636
as a king on this day.

00:04:51.136 --> 00:04:58.136
He also killed Ravana on this day.

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:02.886
Many may say that “how can it be He killed Ravana

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:06.594
and He was “coronated” on the same date?”

00:05:06.803 --> 00:05:13.553
In those days in India, we had supersonic aeroplanes

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.803
and - is a fact, and the aeroplane’s name was Pushpak,

00:05:20.177 --> 00:05:22.219
meaning “the flower”.

00:05:22.428 --> 00:05:26.594
It was called as Pushpak and it has a tremendous speed.

00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:33.011
So after killing Ravana He came to Ayodhya with His wife

00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:37.928
and that was the day He was crowned.

00:05:39.428 --> 00:05:45.970
On the ninth day, He worshiped the Goddess to get strength,

00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:49.511
Shakti, for his weapons,

00:05:49.845 --> 00:05:54.010
and the tenth day He killed Ravana.

00:05:54.886 --> 00:05:58.344
So, you can imagine how much advanced people were there

00:05:58.553 --> 00:06:02.344
at the time of Shri Rama and His kingdom.

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:07.302
The reason was the king was an incarnation;

00:06:07.553 --> 00:06:14.011
also He was a benevolent king as described by Socrates.

00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:20.386
Shri Rama’s story is very interesting throughout

00:06:20.636 --> 00:06:25.428
and we have now a beautiful series about Him

00:06:25.678 --> 00:06:32.678
done by our television in India, which is sold for a very good price,

00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:39.261
maybe we might be able to present you all with one, when you come there.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.803
But the story of Rama they say was written before He was born.

00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:55.219
Even before there was any inkling of it;

00:06:55.803 --> 00:07:02.052
The seer, Valmiki, wrote the whole story of Shri Rama.

00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:06.302
Shri Rama’s birth and all that

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:13.469
are brought forth by the Agni, the fire,

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:21.678
and He was born in the Dynasty of the Surya, is the sun.

00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:25.553
So with all that,

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.261
born out of the blessings of the Agni, that is fire,

00:07:31.428 --> 00:07:38.469
and also was born in the dynasty of Surya,

00:07:39.177 --> 00:07:46.177
He was one of the mildest avataras you have ever had.

00:07:47.094 --> 00:07:51.928
He’s known to be a very

00:07:56.845 --> 00:07:58.177
I mean English language

00:07:58.428 --> 00:08:01.678
formal person, in the sense

00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:08.761
sankoch - that He would go to any extent

00:08:09.803 --> 00:08:16.886
to bear upon Himself the problems than to tell others to do something.

00:08:18.011 --> 00:08:21.428
We still had many people in India like that.

00:08:21.761 --> 00:08:25.678
Like we had one prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri,

00:08:26.052 --> 00:08:27.970
and

00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:32.261
if he was sitting in the room and there are people sitting

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:37.136
and there’s electricity was on somehow,

00:08:37.386 --> 00:08:40.970
say by light or something, and he wants to put it off,

00:08:41.136 --> 00:08:43.928
he would not ask anyone to put it off.

00:08:44.094 --> 00:08:47.344
Slowly he’ll get up from his seat,

00:08:47.594 --> 00:08:51.094
walk up to the switch and just put it off

00:08:51.344 --> 00:08:54.011
so that he shouldn’t ask for anything.

00:08:54.219 --> 00:08:58.011
This is one of the greatest quality of Shri Rama

00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:03.302
that He would not make anyone do anything for Him

00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:09.010
or order anything or would use someone for that purpose.

00:09:09.302 --> 00:09:14.886
See, He was the blessing of fire

00:09:15.302 --> 00:09:17.678
and born in the Surya.

00:09:17.928 --> 00:09:22.511
But what we find, those people who are born,

00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:26.636
maybe in very lowly families,

00:09:26.845 --> 00:09:30.553
in the negative families, the left-sided as you can call it,

00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:33.010
with all kinds of problems,

00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:39.845
have a terrible Agnya and a terrible Suryada in them.

00:09:40.928 --> 00:09:46.553
The person who is born in the Surya has to be extremely humble.

00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:52.428
He is the one who shows that nothing can affect him,

00:09:52.678 --> 00:09:58.511
nothing can make him feel that he is something great.

00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:03.302
Now, when we see His life further,

00:10:04.094 --> 00:10:06.177
He was a very humble man.

00:10:06.386 --> 00:10:13.011
We've seen now people who try to despise others,

00:10:13.386 --> 00:10:16.344
“I don’t like you”, “I don’t like”,

00:10:16.553 --> 00:10:19.886
“It’s not good”, “It’s very difficult”,

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:26.845
is a sign that such a person is extremely low in character,

00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:31.511
has no character at all but is low in character.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.511
Anybody who has any character is shown

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.219
by the tolerance he has of other people.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:48.219
Intolerance is a sign of a person who is extremely egoistical

00:10:48.469 --> 00:10:53.553
and has,  is vain, there’s vanity.

00:10:54.052 --> 00:11:01.511
Shri Rama was so much loved by the people where He ruled in that state

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.970
and He had the most beautiful wife

00:11:06.136 --> 00:11:11.761
of the most venerated father, Janaka,

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.720
and who was the beloved son of His father.

00:11:16.928 --> 00:11:21.177
But He was such an humble man, such an humble man,

00:11:21.386 --> 00:11:25.344
that in all His character you see the beauty.

00:11:25.553 --> 00:11:30.636
Like, He was going by a little boat

00:11:30.845 --> 00:11:35.261
when He went for His exile.

00:11:35.469 --> 00:11:41.010
And the one who was taking Him was an ordinary boatman.

00:11:41.261 --> 00:11:46.219
And the boatman was feeling very much upset

00:11:46.428 --> 00:11:49.428
that he’s sitting before the king of Ayodhya

00:11:49.636 --> 00:11:52.052
and he doesn’t have proper clothes.

00:11:52.302 --> 00:11:58.136
So Shri Rama, who was Himself was wearing nothing but

00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:04.344
valkalas - are the clothes which are worn by the village people

00:12:04.553 --> 00:12:09.511
or worn by the people who live in the primitive areas,

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:15.011
only kind of leaves that they have.

00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:18.720
He had to wear that because His mother, the stepmother,

00:12:18.928 --> 00:12:22.803
asked for that kind of boon from the father.

00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:27.344
And then Shri Rama just told him,

00:12:27.594 --> 00:12:31.845
“Why are you worried? I am wearing this. I am no more a king.

00:12:32.011 --> 00:12:35.928
I am sitting before you like this. You should be quite comforted.

00:12:36.094 --> 00:12:40.177
And I really don’t know how to steer the boat

00:12:40.428 --> 00:12:44.344
while you know how to steer the boat so why should you be worried?”

00:12:44.553 --> 00:12:49.052
Like that He kept even the people

00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:53.886
who we would call as low in society

00:12:54.052 --> 00:13:00.886
at a very high pedestal, which shows that He respected human beings.

00:13:01.094 --> 00:13:04.720
He Himself is called as maryada purushottama,

00:13:04.928 --> 00:13:08.094
means He was the one who had to knew

00:13:08.344 --> 00:13:11.970
how far to go with someone, maryada

00:13:12.136 --> 00:13:16.720
How to talk to someone, how to approach someone,

00:13:16.928 --> 00:13:21.094
while we find people who misbehave,

00:13:21.302 --> 00:13:24.094
even with their husbands, with their wives, with their children,

00:13:24.302 --> 00:13:30.803
with everyone and also outside they are about to jump on others.

00:13:31.219 --> 00:13:35.052
That’s absolutely against Rama.  It’s like Ravana.

00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:38.469
Even Ravana was not like this.

00:13:39.428 --> 00:13:42.010
He was also of not that nature

00:13:42.219 --> 00:13:45.803
because he had certain dharmas within him. He was a realized soul,

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:51.636
but he had become a rakshasa because he became arrogant,

00:13:51.845 --> 00:13:54.678
but even his arrogance cannot be matched

00:13:54.886 --> 00:14:00.344
with many modern people and modern girls and men that I hear and see,

00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:04.386
that it is surprising they have really surpassed Ravana.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:08.177
Ravana only had ten heads but sometimes I feel

00:14:08.386 --> 00:14:12.177
that the modern men might have, or the women specially,

00:14:12.386 --> 00:14:17.052
might have hundred and eight heads!

00:14:18.594 --> 00:14:25.094
The arrogance, the amount of expression of hatred,

00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:30.720
is so ridiculous and makes a person look so useless,

00:14:30.928 --> 00:14:33.678
but I see such people very common

00:14:33.886 --> 00:14:38.720
and in Sahaja Yoga also they crawl somehow.

00:14:41.803 --> 00:14:48.094
Actually such people are absolutely despised by God Almighty.

00:14:49.177 --> 00:14:53.010
You go further with His life, see He went

00:14:53.177 --> 00:14:58.636
and into the village where a very old woman

00:14:58.845 --> 00:15:02.344
who was belonging to the primitive class of Bhils, (िभल –tribe living in the jungles of central India)

00:15:02.803 --> 00:15:09.010
had very few teeth, and she brought some

00:15:10.386 --> 00:15:13.886
some fruits, little fruits we call as ber,

00:15:14.052 --> 00:15:16.428
and she brought and gave it to Him,

00:15:16.636 --> 00:15:21.094
that “Shri Ram, you see, I have got these for you.

00:15:21.344 --> 00:15:25.261
I don’t have anything else. And these, I’ve tested all of them.”

00:15:25.469 --> 00:15:28.594
Actually in India, if you put in the mouth, it is uttishtha,

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.886
nobody will touch it.

00:15:31.052 --> 00:15:35.803
But she says, “I have tasted all of them by piercing my teeth into it

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.678
and I have seen that none of them are sour.”

00:15:38.928 --> 00:15:42.344
Shri Rama didn’t like sour fruits, she knew,

00:15:42.803 --> 00:15:46.052
so, “None of them are sour and you can have them.”

00:15:46.261 --> 00:15:50.177
I mean, in a way, if it is done to somebody in the west

00:15:50.386 --> 00:15:53.094
they will hit you hard.

00:15:54.302 --> 00:15:57.052
Immediately Shri Rama rushed forward

00:15:57.302 --> 00:16:02.845
and took the bers from her hand,

00:16:03.052 --> 00:16:06.553
kissed her hand, said, "All right, all right, I’m going to have them.”

00:16:06.761 --> 00:16:09.761
With such enthusiasm He ate them.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:16.010
So Lakshmana was little angry at that lady, “What’s this going on?”

00:16:16.177 --> 00:16:20.011
So Sitaji said, “Oh do you like them very much?”

00:16:20.219 --> 00:16:22.261
He said, “Yes, but I’m not going to give you anything.”

00:16:22.469 --> 00:16:26.928
She said, “No, I am your half body. You have to give me.”

00:16:27.094 --> 00:16:30.302
So He gave some to Sitaji. So Sitaji ate,

00:16:30.511 --> 00:16:35.177
“Yaah, what a thing! It’s like nectar of heaven I am eating.”

00:16:35.386 --> 00:16:38.511
So Lakshmana felt very jealous.

00:16:40.511 --> 00:16:44.177
He said, “Sister-in-law, can I not have a little of it?”

00:16:44.386 --> 00:16:47.970
She said, “No. I can’t give you. You ask your brother.

00:16:48.136 --> 00:16:50.177
I’m not going to give you. I have a very little share.

00:16:50.386 --> 00:16:52.511
Why don’t you ask your brother?”

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.261
So he goes to his brother, he says, “Can I have some more?”

00:16:56.469 --> 00:17:03.886
So Shri Rama smiled and gave him that ber which was eaten,

00:17:04.052 --> 00:17:09.136
or touched, or was pierced, by the teeth of a primitive woman,

00:17:09.386 --> 00:17:15.970
who is actually an outcast according to the Brahminic laws of India.

00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:21.970
The sweetness of Shri Rama,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:28.010
the way He used to make people feel comfortable,

00:17:29.177 --> 00:17:34.678
like I would say, an example of a oyster

00:17:34.886 --> 00:17:41.886
who gets a little stone into the body of the shell,

00:17:43.219 --> 00:17:48.511
takes out a kind of a shiny liquid

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.970
and covers it with that shiny liquid

00:17:52.136 --> 00:17:56.970
and makes it into a pearl to be comfortable.

00:17:59.302 --> 00:18:02.052
Now, He didn’t want His own comfort.

00:18:02.302 --> 00:18:05.386
Rama is a little bit different

00:18:05.594 --> 00:18:12.803
that He wanted to make everyone into a diamond, or a pearl,

00:18:13.011 --> 00:18:19.010
so that the other person would shine and would look nice,

00:18:19.219 --> 00:18:22.261
and that’s how He felt comforted.

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:28.845
His qualities, if you have to imbibe, first of all

00:18:29.052 --> 00:18:34.886
we have to understand the innate situation of Shri Rama.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:42.386
Shri Rama is placed on the right-hand side of your heart,

00:18:44.219 --> 00:18:49.010
right hand side, right heart, He’s placed there.

00:18:49.553 --> 00:18:53.177
Now in a human being there is no right heart.

00:18:54.177 --> 00:18:55.970
If you tell somebody there's right heart, they’ll say, “What,

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.886
there are two hearts, or three hearts?”

00:18:59.177 --> 00:19:04.428
In our Sahaja Yoga we have three hearts:

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.720
one is the left, another is the right, and one is the center.

00:19:09.928 --> 00:19:14.678
Now the right heart is a very important thing.

00:19:15.344 --> 00:19:22.052
The right heart looks after the whole

00:19:22.636 --> 00:19:25.636
lungs, both the lungs,

00:19:26.219 --> 00:19:29.553
all the throat,

00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:35.761
the trachea, the nose, the inner part.

00:19:36.177 --> 00:19:39.136
The outer side is looked after, we can say,

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:41.886
the features are given by Shri Krishna

00:19:42.052 --> 00:19:45.845
but the inner part of it is all done by Shri Rama.

00:19:46.052 --> 00:19:50.803
They are the same, but one acts as an inner part,

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.553
another as the outer part.

00:19:54.761 --> 00:19:59.344
It gives you the ears, from the inner part, Shri Rama does.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:04.636
He gives you the eyes, in the inner part of the eyes.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:09.761
Now, it’s so important to have the inner side all right

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:14.386
than the outer side. Is an example of Shri Rama,

00:20:14.594 --> 00:20:21.094
He never cared for the outer side or the outward looks of a person.

00:20:22.553 --> 00:20:25.720
Because He came before Shri Krishna,

00:20:25.928 --> 00:20:30.010
He tried to build up the inner side of a human being.

00:20:30.219 --> 00:20:33.094
So, we can say, though He is on the right heart,

00:20:33.302 --> 00:20:36.094
He acts through your Hamsa chakra

00:20:36.302 --> 00:20:41.094
and partly through your Vishuddhi Chakra in the inner side of it.

00:20:41.302 --> 00:20:45.594
Because Shri Krishna, in the inner side of it is Shri Rama,

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.094
is Shri Vishnu.

00:20:49.678 --> 00:20:53.177
So, when somebody is,

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:57.845
say, not good looking according to the western standard,

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.636
according to Me the western standards are rather funny,

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:07.302
because western standards don’t look like

00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:11.094
neither like Krishna or Shri Rama.

00:21:12.678 --> 00:21:19.678
The person like Shri Rama was a very healthy, tall person

00:21:19.886 --> 00:21:23.928
with his hands up to the knees,

00:21:24.094 --> 00:21:28.886
ajanubahu, means the one who has ajanubahu,

00:21:29.636 --> 00:21:34.177
and He was plump, both of them were plump.

00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:37.094
They had to be plump people, because they were

00:21:37.302 --> 00:21:41.594
though they were born of the Agni, He was born of the Agni,

00:21:41.803 --> 00:21:48.344
but the water is the main element of Shri Vishnu.

00:21:48.886 --> 00:21:50.886
So they were all plump people.

00:21:51.052 --> 00:21:54.845
They were not thin like sticks as today’s modern ideas are,

00:21:55.011 --> 00:21:59.010
to be thin like sticks and like TB-patients.

00:21:59.177 --> 00:22:04.052
But it doesn’t mean all plump people are good.

00:22:04.428 --> 00:22:07.469
We always logically think that plump people are,

00:22:07.678 --> 00:22:10.386
if  Mother says so, then plump people are good. Is not the point.

00:22:10.594 --> 00:22:13.177
The inner side of it I am saying.

00:22:13.386 --> 00:22:17.428
The inner side of it is just the opposite.

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:22.261
Inner side of it is absolutely beautiful

00:22:22.469 --> 00:22:29.177
and absolutely full of love, affection and warmth.

00:22:29.636 --> 00:22:32.970
A person who doesn’t have these things

00:22:33.136 --> 00:22:38.136
is a sign of a person who is not a Sahaja Yogi, first of all.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.386
A person who is very loud,

00:22:41.928 --> 00:22:46.761
talks loudly, speaks loudly, laughs at wrong places

00:22:47.094 --> 00:22:51.010
must be half mad but cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:22:52.428 --> 00:22:56.886
See this softness of Shri Rama goes to the extremes

00:22:57.052 --> 00:23:00.136
where I call the sankocha, the formality, 'the formal'

00:23:00.344 --> 00:23:04.970
but it is English language, “formal” is not the word, sankoch.

00:23:05.136 --> 00:23:07.678
He was once

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:14.803
when He was fighting Ravana,

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:21.845
He was taking out with His arrow his ten heads one after another.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.928
And if He took out one then took out the second,

00:23:26.094 --> 00:23:30.553
the first one would come back so because he had a kind of a blessing

00:23:30.761 --> 00:23:35.594
that nobody can kill him by hitting him on his head.

00:23:35.928 --> 00:23:38.386
So Lakshmana says, “You know for definite

00:23:38.678 --> 00:23:43.511
that this Ravana cannot be killed by hitting on his head,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.845
so why don’t You hit him in his heart?”

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.678
So He said, “The reason is this,

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:56.761
that just now in his heart is Mahalakshmi, the Sita.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:01.845
Sita is sitting in his heart. And how can I hit him on his heart?

00:24:02.011 --> 00:24:05.344
Because She’s there,  She might be hurt.”

00:24:05.928 --> 00:24:08.511
“So what’s the use of hitting on the head?” he said.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.803
He said, “Because, once I start hitting him on the head fast,

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.344
his attention will go there.

00:24:13.553 --> 00:24:16.136
As soon as his attention will go into his head

00:24:16.344 --> 00:24:19.177
then I can hit him on his heart.”

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.970
See the sankoch?

00:24:25.344 --> 00:24:29.344
See the sankoch, the way He talked.

00:24:31.261 --> 00:24:34.386
Now we have - Tina, what is wrong with you?

00:24:34.636 --> 00:24:39.177
Why are you all the time smiling like this. Can't you keep quiet?

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.386
What is there to smile, about certain things,

00:24:42.594 --> 00:24:46.428
where you don't have to smile?  Keep quiet!

00:24:46.761 --> 00:24:51.720
Now, then what happened, that He was

00:24:55.678 --> 00:25:00.428
so kind once when a very ugly woman, Shurpanakha,

00:25:00.678 --> 00:25:05.761
came to entice Him. And she said, she came to entice,

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.469
she said that, “Rama why don’t You marry me?”

00:25:09.678 --> 00:25:13.177
I mean, to a person like Rama who is maryada Purushottama

00:25:13.386 --> 00:25:16.302
to ask such a horrible questions.

00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:21.636
Somebody would have really beaten her up if not anything else.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.428
So, Shri Ram smiled. He said,

00:25:25.678 --> 00:25:27.344
“Madam, I’m sorry.

00:25:27.553 --> 00:25:34.136
I have a wife and I believe in one wife, 'ekapatnivrat'.

00:25:34.428 --> 00:25:36.428
So I’m sorry I can’t marry you.”

00:25:36.636 --> 00:25:39.928
But mischievously He says, “All right, My brother is there.

00:25:40.094 --> 00:25:44.636
His wife is left in Ayodhya. You can ask.”

00:25:46.636 --> 00:25:50.636
So he went to her and he asked,

00:25:53.469 --> 00:25:57.761
She went to him and asked, “Lakshmana why don’t you marry me? ”

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.302
She had become very beautiful.

00:25:59.511 --> 00:26:02.344
She has transformed herself to a beautiful woman.

00:26:02.553 --> 00:26:05.302
She must have gone to some beauty or something,

00:26:05.511 --> 00:26:08.886
but she made herself like that, and she was there.

00:26:09.052 --> 00:26:13.928
And he looked at her so angry, he said, “You, the ugly,

00:26:14.094 --> 00:26:17.678
why do you want to ask such a question?”  He cut her nose.

00:26:17.928 --> 00:26:20.011
When he cut her nose, that was in Nasik

00:26:20.219 --> 00:26:22.511
and that’s why Nasika means the nose,

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.511
and that’s why you have been to Nasik,

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.010
that’s the place where he cut her nose.

00:26:27.177 --> 00:26:29.928
He was very angry.  But Shri Rama did not.

00:26:30.094 --> 00:26:32.261
He said in a way that’s very convincing that,

00:26:32.469 --> 00:26:38.219
“See I have a wife and I am a person who believes in My one wife.”

00:26:38.428 --> 00:26:42.636
Now the another character about Him was that He was consistent.

00:26:43.261 --> 00:26:47.011
He was never inconsistent like Shri Krishna.

00:26:47.594 --> 00:26:54.761
Shri Krishna was a diplomat and diplomacy is in being inconsistent.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.010
Shri Krishna’s style was different. But ….

00:27:02.177 --> 00:27:05.386
Why?  What is the matter with you?  Why, what is it?

00:27:05.678 --> 00:27:07.594
You come ad sit here. This side come along Tina.

00:27:07.803 --> 00:27:11.553
Come and sit on the other side. Why do you talk to her?

00:27:12.219 --> 00:27:15.219
Go and sit at the back. Go.

00:27:17.177 --> 00:27:22.177
She has already given me a very bad time in Puna, and now here she is.

00:27:24.261 --> 00:27:26.886
While I am talking, please don't talk to each other.

00:27:27.052 --> 00:27:28.720
This is the least you can do to me.

00:27:28.928 --> 00:27:32.344
Have you seen any Indians behave like this?

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.928
It's very disturbing.

00:27:46.678 --> 00:27:50.886
I am concentrating on you why you are not concentrating on Me.

00:27:51.094 --> 00:27:53.886
It's alright, when there is a joke, something - you laugh.

00:27:54.052 --> 00:27:58.094
What's the need to talk to each other, I can`t understand.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.469
Alright. Sorry I had to say that.

00:28:05.678 --> 00:28:09.219
You see at the time, when I am discussing Shri Rama.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:13.136
Shri Rama would not have said that.

00:28:14.302 --> 00:28:18.511
But in Sahaja Yoga, you can’t carry on like Shri Rama.

00:28:18.761 --> 00:28:22.010
Sometimes you have to be like Parashurama also,

00:28:22.177 --> 00:28:25.344
otherwise things don’t work out.

00:28:26.594 --> 00:28:30.928
Now, when it went ahead with it

00:28:31.094 --> 00:28:34.052
in His character, which was so beautiful,

00:28:34.261 --> 00:28:37.594
that you find He was such a consistent person.

00:28:38.052 --> 00:28:44.261
Whatever He said, all the life He carried that. For example, He said,

00:28:44.469 --> 00:28:49.177
“I am the one who believes in one wife, aika patni vrat.”

00:28:50.344 --> 00:28:57.302
Now He had a very nice wife, no doubt, very beautiful wife,

00:28:57.511 --> 00:29:02.428
but She had gone to Ravana and He was left alone.

00:29:02.636 --> 00:29:05.845
When they wanted to start a kind of a yagya

00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:08.010
called as ‘Rajasurya yagya’

00:29:08.177 --> 00:29:15.094
which was meant to be  the conquering the whole world.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.094
Then they asked Him,

00:29:18.302 --> 00:29:21.052
“You have to marry, because you have to have your wife.”

00:29:21.302 --> 00:29:26.511
He said, “No, I can’t marry, because nobody could be like My wife

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.594
and I can’t marry. I can forego this kind of a yagya,

00:29:31.845 --> 00:29:34.469
but I can’t marry again.”

00:29:34.678 --> 00:29:38.636
So, then they said, “All right, there’s only one thing you can do

00:29:38.845 --> 00:29:42.970
is to make a statue of Sita in gold

00:29:43.136 --> 00:29:50.136
and you have to use Her, that statue, as a wife representing.”

00:29:50.636 --> 00:29:54.928
He said, “That I will agree.” He took away all His ornaments,

00:29:55.094 --> 00:30:01.428
everything, and made that statue and He did this yagya.

00:30:01.678 --> 00:30:04.970
So whatever He said He followed thoroughly.

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:08.386
In His dharma He was perfect.

00:30:08.594 --> 00:30:12.428
Another incident is that when

00:30:13.386 --> 00:30:17.261
Sita was lost.

00:30:17.678 --> 00:30:23.010
He never slept, He never slept on a bed,

00:30:23.302 --> 00:30:25.845
always on the Mother Earth.

00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:29.428
Never slept on a bed, always on the Mother Earth.

00:30:29.678 --> 00:30:31.720
The pain He had of His wife

00:30:31.928 --> 00:30:36.761
is very well described by all the poets of India.

00:30:37.094 --> 00:30:41.678
And when Sita left Him ultimately in a very mysterious way,

00:30:41.928 --> 00:30:44.720
She just disappeared in the Mother Earth

00:30:44.928 --> 00:30:46.845
because Mother Earth had given Her birth

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:49.010
so She disappeared into Mother Earth.

00:30:49.177 --> 00:30:54.469
Then Shri Rama became absolutely lost

00:30:54.678 --> 00:30:57.928
and He jumped in the river Sharayu

00:30:58.219 --> 00:31:03.469
and disappeared in the water element from where He had come.

00:31:04.553 --> 00:31:08.302
Now this man had to give up His wife.

00:31:08.511 --> 00:31:11.011
In this contrast you can see

00:31:11.219 --> 00:31:15.678
the wave rising and falling of a personality.

00:31:16.261 --> 00:31:20.344
The society in which He lived, the state which He ruled,

00:31:20.594 --> 00:31:25.845
had an objection for a wife, who had lived with Ravana.

00:31:26.219 --> 00:31:28.511
And the public started talking about it.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:33.469
So, as a good king, He just, as a good king,

00:31:33.678 --> 00:31:40.678
He just decided that His wife should be left forever.

00:31:43.594 --> 00:31:50.094
And then He sent Her on a beautiful chariot

00:31:50.594 --> 00:31:55.052
with His prime minister

00:31:55.261 --> 00:31:58.511
and His brother, Lakshmana,

00:31:58.761 --> 00:32:02.094
who took Her down and left Her, told Her,

00:32:02.302 --> 00:32:06.845
"This is what has happened and that Shri Rama has asked us

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:11.803
to take you down to the ashram of Valmiki."

00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:20.219
As a result of that She got very upset and She said,

00:32:20.553 --> 00:32:23.302
She was Adi Shakti, so She doesn’t have to bother.

00:32:23.511 --> 00:32:25.761
She said, “You just leave Me here.”

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.928
Very self-respecting person.

00:32:29.094 --> 00:32:31.970
She didn’t say, “No, no, no, no, I’ll come to Him”

00:32:32.136 --> 00:32:36.678
or “I’ll sue Him. I’ll go in the courts, get all His money.

00:32:36.886 --> 00:32:41.970
How dare He throw me out.”  Nothing of the kind.

00:32:44.845 --> 00:32:49.094
That’s the grace of a woman. Graciously She said, “All right,

00:32:49.302 --> 00:32:51.511
now you have listened to your brother.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.720
I’m your sister-in-law, elder too. Now you obey Me.

00:32:54.928 --> 00:32:59.261
And I tell you, as your sister-in-law, that you can now go.

00:32:59.469 --> 00:33:04.928
Leave Me here alone and I don’t want you to go any further with Me

00:33:05.094 --> 00:33:10.428
to deport Me with somebody. ” And She was pregnant.

00:33:12.219 --> 00:33:15.553
Here if it happens, of course horrible things can happen,

00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:19.136
but in India if such a thing happens, the wife will kill herself

00:33:19.344 --> 00:33:22.344
or she won’t be able to bear it.

00:33:22.553 --> 00:33:25.636
I think both things are just the same, an escape.

00:33:25.886 --> 00:33:29.594
If there’s no aggression then there is recession.

00:33:29.803 --> 00:33:33.261
But She said, “No. I have to give birth to these two children.

00:33:33.469 --> 00:33:36.428
I can look after Myself, all right. Graciously He’s done it,

00:33:36.636 --> 00:33:41.094
I am nothing and please tell Him not to worry about Me.”

00:33:41.761 --> 00:33:44.177
And She told Shri Rama, Shri Lakshmana that,

00:33:44.386 --> 00:33:47.219
“All right, you look after Him, that’s all I want.”

00:33:47.428 --> 00:33:51.136
And She told the chief minister, the mantri,

00:33:51.344 --> 00:33:55.803
that “You must look after the kingdom.”

00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:03.302
See the dignity, see the balance,

00:34:03.553 --> 00:34:06.928
see the character, the personality of Shri Rama.

00:34:07.261 --> 00:34:11.970
He was called as maryada purushottama. And look at His wife.

00:34:12.177 --> 00:34:15.720
She was equal to Him in every way.

00:34:16.636 --> 00:34:20.219
When She was kept by Ravana,

00:34:20.428 --> 00:34:27.094
Ravana was so frightened of Her Shakti that he would not touch Her.

00:34:27.678 --> 00:34:31.302
He used to frighten Her, say “I’ll do this to the women of India.

00:34:31.511 --> 00:34:33.136
I’ll do this to the women of the world.

00:34:33.344 --> 00:34:35.553
I’ll do that kind of a horrible thing.

00:34:35.761 --> 00:34:38.678
I’ll take another birth. I’ll misbehave.”

00:34:38.886 --> 00:34:42.553
She said, “Do what you like. You cannot touch Me.”

00:34:42.761 --> 00:34:48.136
He could not touch Her hand, he was so frightened.

00:34:48.845 --> 00:34:54.886
And when Hanumana brought the ring of Shri Rama

00:34:55.052 --> 00:35:02.302
and presented to Her and said that, “This is the ring of Shri Rama.”

00:35:02.761 --> 00:35:05.052
She said, “Yes, I know. How is He?” He said, “All right.”

00:35:05.261 --> 00:35:09.302
All enquiries She had about Herself. So He said,

00:35:09.511 --> 00:35:12.845
“Mother, I can take You on my back.

00:35:13.011 --> 00:35:16.553
I can easily take You. You come on My back and I’ll take You.”

00:35:16.761 --> 00:35:21.886
She said, “No. I won’t go with You. It's my ..

00:35:22.052 --> 00:35:28.094
It’s Shri Rama who is a brave king,

00:35:28.344 --> 00:35:35.344
He should come Himself, fight this Ravana, kill him because he’s evil,

00:35:36.177 --> 00:35:40.261
and then I will go with Him with all the glory.”

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:43.136
She was not frightened of anything.

00:35:43.386 --> 00:35:47.594
For Her, the important thing was that Ravana should be killed.

00:35:47.886 --> 00:35:53.428
He’s evil and he should be killed by Rama.

00:35:53.678 --> 00:35:56.886
Such a great courage for a woman.

00:35:57.052 --> 00:36:01.678
Both sides if you see you’ll be surprised that how

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:07.553
a woman’s character is such a powerful thing.

00:36:08.094 --> 00:36:09.511
It’s not a reactionary thing,

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.511
“My husband is like this, that’s why I’m like that.”

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.469
or “My husband doesn’t do this for me, that’s why I’m like that.

00:36:15.678 --> 00:36:17.678
My husband is gone away so I’m finished.

00:36:17.886 --> 00:36:20.136
What am I to do without my husband? ” Nothing of the kind.

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:23.010
She stands on Her feet.

00:36:23.177 --> 00:36:26.219
She said “No,” to Hanumana

00:36:26.428 --> 00:36:30.469
and She stands on Her feet

00:36:30.678 --> 00:36:34.928
and She says, “When Rama will come and kill this evil

00:36:35.469 --> 00:36:38.636
and remove this evil from this earth,

00:36:38.845 --> 00:36:43.011
then only He can take Me with Him. I won’t go with You.

00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:45.761
I won’t escape. I won’t run away.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:49.511
Nothing.  I am going to face it Myself here.”

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.386
For a woman it is too much to say,

00:36:52.594 --> 00:36:57.511
to be imprisoned in a horrible person’s jail

00:36:57.761 --> 00:37:02.678
or in a place which is so dangerous for Her,

00:37:02.886 --> 00:37:06.720
to say that “I won’t go. Whatever you may try,

00:37:06.928 --> 00:37:09.845
whatever tricks you may try, whatever you may say.

00:37:10.011 --> 00:37:12.469
I won’t go.”

00:37:12.761 --> 00:37:14.928
Just imagine.

00:37:15.344 --> 00:37:18.136
And Ravana was such a horrid fellow.

00:37:18.428 --> 00:37:22.678
He did all kinds of things to Her

00:37:22.886 --> 00:37:28.845
but She kept absolutely calm and quiet,

00:37:30.344 --> 00:37:33.636
waiting for Her husband to come back.

00:37:34.052 --> 00:37:38.302
Can we think of such women in modern times?

00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:47.094
So satisfied with themselves, so much in balance,

00:37:47.428 --> 00:37:54.219
so much full of confidence and strength.

00:37:57.344 --> 00:38:00.469
This is the message of Sita’s life.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.511
The benevolence of Shri Rama was shown

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.094
when He started ruling the people.

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:15.052
He was the one who cared for the needs of the people.

00:38:16.803 --> 00:38:21.970
For Him, it was important that the people whom He ruled

00:38:22.136 --> 00:38:25.261
should be happy and joyous.

00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:28.970
He looked after them with great love.

00:38:29.136 --> 00:38:32.302
He had two sons

00:38:32.553 --> 00:38:38.010
whom He looked after for a short time

00:38:38.177 --> 00:38:43.386
because they were lost with the mother, Sita,

00:38:43.886 --> 00:38:48.678
and they are the ones who found Him out in a way

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:54.136
that Valmiki taught them how to sing the Ramayana.

00:38:54.344 --> 00:38:59.136
And they went to Ayodhya and sang the Ramayana.

00:38:59.553 --> 00:39:02.678
Rama went with them.

00:39:02.886 --> 00:39:06.344
And one day in one of the yagyas,

00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:10.177
when they caught the horse of Shri Rama,

00:39:11.636 --> 00:39:16.052
Hanumana found it impossible to fight those two boys

00:39:16.302 --> 00:39:18.261
and He couldn’t understand.

00:39:18.469 --> 00:39:23.261
Here now, the character of great Hanumana One has to describe.

00:39:23.469 --> 00:39:27.428
He went and told Shri Rama, “I can’t understand, these two boys,

00:39:27.636 --> 00:39:32.302
I can’t face them. I don’t know who they are.”

00:39:32.845 --> 00:39:36.136
So, Shri Rama went there.

00:39:36.344 --> 00:39:39.302
And these boys were standing with their arrows.

00:39:39.553 --> 00:39:44.052
Then Shri Sita appeared before them and She said,

00:39:44.261 --> 00:39:47.886
“You cannot fight. He is your father.”

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.720
This made Hanumana realize it. And He said, “All right,

00:39:52.928 --> 00:39:57.803
I can fight Shri Rama now. Why did He leave you like this?”

00:39:58.386 --> 00:40:04.761
See the sweetness of Shri Hanumana who was such a great devotee,

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.720
such a great devotee of Shri Rama,

00:40:07.928 --> 00:40:12.011
could see that, “He has done injustice to My Mother”

00:40:12.302 --> 00:40:14.261
and He stood for that.

00:40:14.511 --> 00:40:18.636
Is very sweet of Shri Hanumana to do that.

00:40:19.386 --> 00:40:25.302
Hanumana is, as you know, is the angel Gabriel

00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:31.886
who is innocence, simplicity, and dynamism.

00:40:32.553 --> 00:40:36.720
His dynamism was such that as soon as He was born,

00:40:36.928 --> 00:40:39.011
He said, “Better eat this sun

00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:44.886
because the sun is scorching the people in India.”

00:40:45.261 --> 00:40:48.010
So He went and gulped down the sun.

00:40:48.177 --> 00:40:51.886
People had to say that, “You see, though too the sun is scorching

00:40:52.052 --> 00:40:56.886
but it’s of great help. Please release the sun. Why did you eat it off?”

00:40:57.094 --> 00:40:59.678
So then He released the sun.

00:40:59.886 --> 00:41:04.928
Hanumana’s whole life was spent in serving Shri Rama.

00:41:05.094 --> 00:41:12.010
And He was such a dedicated bhakta of Shri Ram.

00:41:12.177 --> 00:41:17.344
Now here the contrast is also that Hanumana had navadha,

00:41:17.594 --> 00:41:23.720
navadha siddhis, navadha siddhis, nine siddhis,

00:41:24.136 --> 00:41:27.136
anima, ganima, raguma, and all sorts of things,

00:41:27.344 --> 00:41:30.177
that He could become small, He could become big, he could ...

00:41:30.386 --> 00:41:32.344
so many things He had.

00:41:32.553 --> 00:41:37.803
Despite all these siddhis and the amount of power He had,

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:40.928
that Shri Rama once asked Him that,

00:41:41.094 --> 00:41:46.636
“My brother, Lakshmana, is being hit

00:41:46.886 --> 00:41:49.845
and he’s very sick. I mean, he’s just dying.

00:41:50.011 --> 00:41:54.094
So you go and get a particular kind of a sanjeevani,

00:41:54.302 --> 00:41:59.052
a kind of a herb, which I want to rub on his head.”

00:41:59.803 --> 00:42:02.761
So He went there and He found and he couldn’t find it

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:07.553
so He brought the whole of the mountain on His hand and gave it to Rama,

00:42:07.761 --> 00:42:11.010
"Now You select, I don’t know. I can’t find it.”

00:42:11.469 --> 00:42:13.845
That is the Hanumana Shakti.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:18.761
And with all that power, He was such a humble person

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:22.136
and such a dedicated person.

00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:27.219
This is the sign of a powerful Sahaja Yogi.

00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:35.010
Anybody who is powerful has to be humble and non-violent.

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:38.344
Mahatma Gandhi used to say that,

00:42:38.594 --> 00:42:42.011
“What is the non-violence of the weak?”

00:42:42.261 --> 00:42:45.761
A weak has to be non-violent, what’s so great?

00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:52.678
But that’s a policy or a kind of a protection that he has.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:56.803
So a weak person has to be non-violent

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:02.761
because he cannot face, he cannot protest.

00:43:03.094 --> 00:43:11.010
But non-violence of the powerful is the sign of real non-violence.

00:43:13.219 --> 00:43:17.219
Those who are powerful, if they are non-violent,

00:43:17.469 --> 00:43:22.219
that means they are quite confident of their powers.

00:43:22.428 --> 00:43:24.928
Those people who are confident of their powers,

00:43:25.094 --> 00:43:27.302
why should they aggress others?

00:43:27.511 --> 00:43:30.845
They just stand, “All right, come along, what do you want?”

00:43:31.011 --> 00:43:34.052
Even saying that, people run away.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:39.469
So those who are violent, angry, hot tempered,

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:44.261
jump at everyone, torture everyone, trouble everyone,

00:43:44.469 --> 00:43:48.469
are the people who are very weak charactered.

00:43:48.761 --> 00:43:51.344
Their character is weak.

00:43:51.594 --> 00:43:54.344
If their character was all right

00:43:54.553 --> 00:43:57.886
then they would not have done all these things.

00:43:58.886 --> 00:44:04.219
That’s the sign of a person who is either possessed

00:44:04.428 --> 00:44:08.136
and under the influence of the possession - he’s doing that;

00:44:08.344 --> 00:44:12.094
or he’s too weak and he’s possessed by his anger

00:44:12.302 --> 00:44:18.177
because he doesn’t have that much power to bear anything.

00:44:19.052 --> 00:44:21.386
The most powerful thing is the Mother Earth

00:44:21.594 --> 00:44:23.678
because she has a power to bear.

00:44:23.886 --> 00:44:28.219
The one who has the power to bear, is the powerful.

00:44:29.136 --> 00:44:31.761
The one who does not have any power to bear,

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.469
“I can’t bear. I don’t like. I this...”

00:44:34.678 --> 00:44:39.094
Such a person is a useless thing for this earth and sometimes I feel,

00:44:39.302 --> 00:44:42.386
“Why God created them?”

00:44:42.928 --> 00:44:45.803
It’s a headache to have a person round you,

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.594
“I can’t eat this. I don’t like this.”

00:44:48.803 --> 00:44:52.845
Then why are you here? Nobody likes you either.

00:44:54.469 --> 00:44:57.344
No one likes such a person and that’s why that person is always,

00:44:57.553 --> 00:45:01.594
“I don’t like this. I don’t like that. I …”

00:45:04.261 --> 00:45:10.011
So the power of a person lies in bearing things.

00:45:10.344 --> 00:45:16.803
How much you can bear, how much you can undergo without feeling it?

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:20.469
Like, you are say, in the jungle, you are happy.

00:45:20.678 --> 00:45:23.052
If you are in a palace you are happy.

00:45:23.261 --> 00:45:27.010
If you are with the this color or that color,

00:45:27.177 --> 00:45:29.803
if you are with this race or that race,

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:36.010
if you are with this kind of life or that kind of life,

00:45:36.344 --> 00:45:38.094
you can bear it.

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:43.845
And that bearing power gives you the caliber,

00:45:44.344 --> 00:45:49.511
the caliber to have Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:56.803
It’s not that this is shown, it’s not that is being suffered,

00:45:57.886 --> 00:46:04.553
don’t have to say, “I suffer being like this.” No, you don’t suffer.

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:07.803
It’s just by the way.

00:46:09.636 --> 00:46:13.344
For a person who wants all the comforts,

00:46:13.553 --> 00:46:18.636
a person who wants to live with all the luxuries,

00:46:19.636 --> 00:46:25.469
but not with any kind of defects or any deficiencies,

00:46:25.761 --> 00:46:30.761
is a person is a beggar, I would say, in every sense of the word.

00:46:31.761 --> 00:46:38.261
I mean, best things to get rid of problems is

00:46:38.803 --> 00:46:40.970
not to have them. In the sense,

00:46:41.136 --> 00:46:44.928
now I don’t drive so I have no problem of driving.

00:46:45.094 --> 00:46:50.511
I don’t have - I never telephone, so I don’t have problems of telephones.

00:46:52.219 --> 00:46:56.136
I don’t go to the banks, so I don’t have problems of the banks.

00:46:56.344 --> 00:47:01.720
The best is: I don’t have any income so I have no problem of income tax!

00:47:04.469 --> 00:47:07.219
Whatever bothers you, you just don’t have it.

00:47:07.469 --> 00:47:11.636
Why do you want to have it? Have it and then bother about it?

00:47:11.845 --> 00:47:15.678
It seems very funny that you can get rid of anything

00:47:15.886 --> 00:47:18.720
that bothers you very easily in this world.

00:47:18.928 --> 00:47:22.720
So you need not have that kind of a thing on your head.

00:47:22.928 --> 00:47:27.636
But when the word ‘problem’, specially in the European community

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:30.136
‘problem’ is a very common word,

00:47:30.344 --> 00:47:34.302
but in English language we never learnt this word ‘problem’.

00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:41.636
You see only the ‘problem’ was used when we were studying geometry,

00:47:42.261 --> 00:47:46.261
geometrical problem, but we never knew there’s a 'problem' in life.

00:47:46.469 --> 00:47:49.928
Later on when I came in contact with European community,

00:47:50.094 --> 00:47:54.428
they’ll say, “There’s no problem." "This is the problem.”

00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:00.302
At least in one day hundred times they say ‘problem’ word.

00:48:01.052 --> 00:48:04.678
So, for a problem the solution is

00:48:04.886 --> 00:48:08.720
not to have that thing which gives you 'problem'.

00:48:08.928 --> 00:48:11.136
You can give up anything.

00:48:11.344 --> 00:48:13.886
Anything that you want, you can give up if you know

00:48:14.052 --> 00:48:17.511
how to detach yourself from that.

00:48:17.845 --> 00:48:21.845
Many people come and tell Me, “Mother we have an ego.

00:48:22.094 --> 00:48:26.553
That’s the problem.”  I said, “Then give up.”

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:30.845
I mean, is simple, why do you have it?

00:48:31.261 --> 00:48:34.845
As if, you see, they want to say that, we

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:39.386
“We have trouble with this thing but still we are clinging on to it.

00:48:39.636 --> 00:48:43.720
Like we are afraid of a crocodile

00:48:43.928 --> 00:48:48.094
but we want to put our foot into the mouth of the crocodile.

00:48:48.302 --> 00:48:53.636
And we have a problem that our foot will be eaten up by the crocodile.”

00:48:53.845 --> 00:48:57.469
Now give up.  But they will search out a crocodile,

00:48:57.678 --> 00:49:02.302
open the mouth, and put the foot in it and then come to Me and say,

00:49:02.511 --> 00:49:07.594
“Mother we have a problem. My foot is in the mouth of the crocodile.”

00:49:09.136 --> 00:49:12.970
To get to problems you have to get to it.

00:49:14.678 --> 00:49:21.010
But without getting to it, how will you get a problem?

00:49:21.636 --> 00:49:28.261
Say, for example, people have very silly, stupid problems. Now.

00:49:28.636 --> 00:49:30.886
The first problem somebody may have,

00:49:31.052 --> 00:49:35.219
“Oh I have to get my clothes pressed.”

00:49:35.428 --> 00:49:40.720
What’s the need? No problem. Wear them as they are. Who looks at it?

00:49:40.928 --> 00:49:43.261
“You see there are all the people who have pressed clothes.”

00:49:43.469 --> 00:49:46.803
Doesn’t matter what is there. If it is not pressed, such a, such a ...

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:50.886
It’s a problem for them. It’s silly things like that,

00:49:51.052 --> 00:49:52.553
you’ll see very silly things.

00:49:52.761 --> 00:49:57.094
But the greatest problem I think you have is your watch.

00:49:57.386 --> 00:50:00.344
In Switzerland, I shouldn’t say so.

00:50:04.928 --> 00:50:11.803
You see the problem is like this, that now you have to go the airport.

00:50:12.261 --> 00:50:16.261
As soon as you tell somebody we have to go to the airport,

00:50:16.469 --> 00:50:22.886
now, I have to go, you don’t have to, everybody gets sort of a jumping

00:50:23.052 --> 00:50:26.386
as if standing on a jumping board. You see all of them jumping like that.

00:50:26.636 --> 00:50:29.261
“What’s the matter?” “Mother you have to go to the airport.”

00:50:29.469 --> 00:50:34.678
“So, it’s all right. I have to go. What’s, what's wrong with you?”

00:50:34.886 --> 00:50:37.177
“Is a problem. ” I say, “What’s the problem?

00:50:37.386 --> 00:50:41.094
I have to go. You just know that you don’t have to go at all

00:50:41.302 --> 00:50:43.469
and don’t have to come to the airport.

00:50:43.678 --> 00:50:46.970
And the aeroplane, if it comes and doesn’t take Me,

00:50:47.136 --> 00:50:49.219
I’m not going to come back on your heads

00:50:49.428 --> 00:50:52.428
so I’ll stay in a hotel. Don’t you worry.”

00:50:52.803 --> 00:50:55.511
But why are you so excited about it?

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.136
The way people are excited that I must catch the plane,

00:50:58.344 --> 00:51:02.386
sometimes I feel as if they want to get rid of Me.

00:51:04.386 --> 00:51:10.428
So, this is a problem for people who are very meticulous.

00:51:10.636 --> 00:51:15.052
Now, supposing I say, “I know that the plane won’t leave Me.”

00:51:15.302 --> 00:51:19.136
I know, because I know many things so I have no problems,

00:51:19.344 --> 00:51:24.302
but supposing even if you think the plane you may not get,

00:51:24.928 --> 00:51:28.553
so it may not get.  But if it gets you, all right.

00:51:28.761 --> 00:51:32.636
If it doesn’t get you, it’s all right. So where is the problem?

00:51:32.845 --> 00:51:38.010
Either it will take you or it will not take you. What is in between?

00:51:38.636 --> 00:51:41.761
Where is the problem, I still don’t understand.

00:51:42.261 --> 00:51:44.928
Either it will work out or it will not work out.

00:51:45.094 --> 00:51:48.720
Keep two possibilities. That’s the only two possibilities.

00:51:48.928 --> 00:51:53.428
What is the third possibility that gives you the problem? You tell Me.

00:51:53.678 --> 00:51:56.428
Say somebody owes Me money. All right,

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.511
so either he will give Me or he may not give Me.

00:52:00.761 --> 00:52:06.052
What is the problem?  The problem is that you call it a problem

00:52:06.261 --> 00:52:11.594
and want to avoid to face the truth.

00:52:12.302 --> 00:52:15.010
If you face the truth, you will know one thing

00:52:15.177 --> 00:52:18.344
that see now this man has to give me money. All right,

00:52:18.553 --> 00:52:20.010
I’ll go and face it.

00:52:20.177 --> 00:52:23.136
I’ll tell him, “Sir, you have to give me the money.

00:52:23.344 --> 00:52:28.594
You have to pay me. This is your duty

00:52:28.803 --> 00:52:31.511
and if you don’t pay me, you are doing wrong.”

00:52:31.761 --> 00:52:35.011
You get at him and face him and tell him.

00:52:35.219 --> 00:52:38.511
But you won’t do that. You’ll sit at home, “Oh God, it’s a problem.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.010
I have to, you see, that man is not giving money.

00:52:41.177 --> 00:52:43.052
Oh God. That’s a problem.”

00:52:43.261 --> 00:52:48.261
Sitting here, hitting your head all the time, how will you get it?

00:52:50.052 --> 00:52:55.261
If you face it directly then you’ll be amazed,

00:52:55.469 --> 00:52:58.886
there’s no problem for anything.

00:53:00.636 --> 00:53:03.636
Say your car fails. So it fails,

00:53:03.845 --> 00:53:07.928
get down, enjoy your self nicely till somebody comes along, takes you.

00:53:08.094 --> 00:53:11.928
Or, if supposing you don’t get some lift, all right,

00:53:12.094 --> 00:53:15.803
stay there overnight. What is it? No tiger is going to eat you.

00:53:16.011 --> 00:53:20.261
And if the tiger has to eat you, it will eat.

00:53:24.136 --> 00:53:28.011
Where is the problem?  Still I can’t see.

00:53:30.428 --> 00:53:33.845
I can’t see the problem.  If tiger has to eat,

00:53:34.011 --> 00:53:37.177
that’s already destined that the tiger has to eat.

00:53:37.386 --> 00:53:41.886
In any case, nobody dies. You’ll be born again.

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:47.636
If you look at it from that angle

00:53:47.845 --> 00:53:51.344
then you’ll be surprised, most of the problems do not exist.

00:53:51.553 --> 00:53:55.636
They are like bubbles created by our own thinking,

00:53:55.845 --> 00:54:00.761
the waves of our thinking, “This is the problem. That is the problem.”

00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:03.720
Like today, they said there is no hall on such and such date.

00:54:03.928 --> 00:54:06.261
All right. “Where are you having the hall? ” “There.”

00:54:06.469 --> 00:54:09.720
“If there’s no hall, let us have it in the open.”

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:19.136
So to make the best of it is, is the way Shri Rama shows you.

00:54:19.636 --> 00:54:23.761
Now, what is the way He has helped us, let us see.

00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:29.511
Shri Rama by His character, by His balance, His peace

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:34.177
and His mildness and His sweetness has shown us

00:54:34.386 --> 00:54:36.594
how a king should be a benevolent king

00:54:36.803 --> 00:54:40.010
and at the same time a very loving husband

00:54:40.177 --> 00:54:43.219
and a loving father and a person in dharma,

00:54:43.428 --> 00:54:49.010
but apart from that, He went down to Maharashtra.

00:54:49.636 --> 00:54:51.261
He arranged all these things

00:54:51.469 --> 00:54:56.469
so that He could walk down to Maharashtra bare feet to vibrate the land

00:54:56.678 --> 00:55:00.011
because Sahaja Yogis will be going one day to Maharashtra

00:55:00.219 --> 00:55:03.469
and the Maharashtra has to be a vibrated land.

00:55:03.761 --> 00:55:09.219
In Ayodhya, He never took out His shoes because He was the king there.

00:55:09.428 --> 00:55:12.469
But when He went, and Shri Sita, both of them,

00:55:12.678 --> 00:55:16.720
when they went to Maharashtra They took out their shoes to vibrate it.

00:55:16.928 --> 00:55:20.886
On His way, He saw a big stone

00:55:21.052 --> 00:55:25.970
which was nothing but a lady cursed to be a stone, Ahilya.

00:55:26.136 --> 00:55:30.761
And He made her, just by touch, she again came back to life.

00:55:31.136 --> 00:55:36.428
Like that, one after another He was just, by the way, as if was doing,

00:55:36.636 --> 00:55:40.594
but that was the purpose of His life to go there.

00:55:42.678 --> 00:55:48.720
And that has helped a very great achievement within ourselves,

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:51.136
is the Shri Ram.

00:55:51.344 --> 00:55:54.219
Shri Rama stands for the pranavayu,

00:55:54.428 --> 00:55:59.970
is for the vital air that we take in.

00:56:00.136 --> 00:56:05.136
For the vital air, and that vital air when it gets heated up,

00:56:05.344 --> 00:56:09.845
we have to know that we are not any more with Shri Ram.

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:14.094
It has to be the cool air to blow through your nose and your mouth.

00:56:14.302 --> 00:56:18.344
I don’t know about you people, it happens with Me all the time.

00:56:19.803 --> 00:56:23.094
When you are angry the nostrils go up, swell up,

00:56:23.302 --> 00:56:27.386
and the hot air, the hot words, and everything hot,

00:56:27.594 --> 00:56:31.052
the heated eyes, and everything goes up like that, curled up,

00:56:31.261 --> 00:56:34.344
and you become ferocious Ravana,

00:56:34.553 --> 00:56:40.886
because you have forgotten the beauty of the nature of Shri Rama.

00:56:42.553 --> 00:56:46.386
What has He done to our center heart is the greatest thing,

00:56:46.594 --> 00:56:51.553
that He has given you a fatherhood within us.

00:56:51.803 --> 00:56:55.219
Because Shri Rama represents the fatherhood.

00:56:55.469 --> 00:56:58.594
Now what sort of a father you are, you have to decide.

00:56:58.803 --> 00:57:01.594
Those people who are not good fathers

00:57:01.803 --> 00:57:03.886
develop problems of the right heart.

00:57:04.052 --> 00:57:08.886
Also those people who are not good husbands

00:57:09.052 --> 00:57:12.386
also develop the right heart.

00:57:13.594 --> 00:57:16.302
This right heart is so important,

00:57:16.553 --> 00:57:21.511
because  specially in the west where the climate is so funny,

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:25.010
you have to keep inside your rooms and closed all the time

00:57:25.177 --> 00:57:27.636
that you get all dried up inside

00:57:27.845 --> 00:57:32.720
at that time if you don’t have that sweetness, that warmth,

00:57:32.928 --> 00:57:37.094
that kindness of Shri Rama, you get the trouble of asthma.

00:57:37.302 --> 00:57:41.177
So many people die of asthma in the west.

00:57:41.428 --> 00:57:44.177
On top of that, you fight with your wives, ill-treat them,

00:57:44.428 --> 00:57:48.970
you take away their money, you cheat them in their money

00:57:49.136 --> 00:57:53.302
and every way you torture them then it becomes even worse.

00:57:54.261 --> 00:57:57.511
So it has something to do with money, in the sense,

00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:04.344
because Sitaji was Shri Lakshmi and Sitaji was the one

00:58:04.636 --> 00:58:08.428
who, who was the power of Shri Rama.

00:58:08.636 --> 00:58:12.386
So the Shri Lakshmi also gets annoyed with you

00:58:12.594 --> 00:58:15.720
when you are a bad father or a bad husband.

00:58:15.928 --> 00:58:18.803
That’s why the Gruha Lakshmi is very important.

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:22.928
But the woman has to be the Gruha Lakshmi. She should not be a shrew

00:58:23.094 --> 00:58:25.636
and then the husband is supposed to be kind to her.

00:58:25.845 --> 00:58:28.052
Then it's spoiling. That's very bad.

00:58:28.261 --> 00:58:30.219
The woman has to be a Gruha Lakshmi,

00:58:30.428 --> 00:58:33.636
a beautiful woman with a very sweet nature

00:58:33.845 --> 00:58:38.052
and talking to her husband in a very sankoch manner

00:58:38.261 --> 00:58:43.469
and also looking after the children, looking after the family

00:58:43.678 --> 00:58:47.052
and looking after the guests who come to their house.

00:58:47.261 --> 00:58:52.177
But if you encourage and run after such women who are no good,

00:58:52.386 --> 00:58:55.469
means collectively they should be good;

00:58:55.678 --> 00:58:58.011
if collectively they do not act well,

00:58:58.219 --> 00:59:00.052
collectively if they are aggressive,

00:59:00.261 --> 00:59:03.010
collectively if they are tormenting others,

00:59:03.177 --> 00:59:06.136
then such women should not be encouraged at all,

00:59:06.344 --> 00:59:11.010
but then, Tulsidas says, they should be beaten up.

00:59:11.761 --> 00:59:16.761
Is a thing looks very bad in modern times if somebody says like that,

00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:22.511
that women should be beaten up in case they have all such qualities

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:26.094
which disqualify them from being Gruha Lakshmis.

00:59:26.386 --> 00:59:31.261
Of course there’s no need to beat, but I mean to say that what is it

00:59:31.469 --> 00:59:35.261
that you have to drive out all these baddhas from your women,

00:59:35.469 --> 00:59:42.302
very important, otherwise if you fall in this activity

00:59:42.511 --> 00:59:45.720
of keeping your wives on right lines,

00:59:45.928 --> 00:59:50.428
you might also get a right heart and asthma ultimately.

00:59:51.052 --> 00:59:54.886
Because your wife and you are part of the society.

00:59:55.052 --> 00:59:59.261
And the society has certain laws which are very important.

00:59:59.511 --> 01:00:03.469
There’s something like stri-dharma, there’s something like pati-dharma,

01:00:03.678 --> 01:00:06.302
there’s something like mata-dharma,

01:00:06.511 --> 01:00:09.010
pita-dharma, everything has a dharma.

01:00:09.177 --> 01:00:12.511
Those men who torture their wives have very bad heart.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.845
In the same way, those who play into the hands of their wives

01:00:16.011 --> 01:00:19.011
also have a very bad right heart.

01:00:20.219 --> 01:00:24.845
You have to be in the balance. You are the husband, and she is your wife,

01:00:25.011 --> 01:00:30.720
and both are responsible for keeping a very good family relationship.

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:34.010
It’s not one-sided. It’s not the husband only or the wife

01:00:34.177 --> 01:00:38.010
but both of them to be in such a manner

01:00:38.177 --> 01:00:42.261
that they act according to their nature of woman and man,

01:00:42.469 --> 01:00:44.928
and respect each other, love each other,

01:00:45.094 --> 01:00:48.928
share everything with each other and exist in a way

01:00:49.094 --> 01:00:52.553
that people should see that there are two wheels of a chariot,

01:00:52.761 --> 01:00:55.928
one on the left, one on the right, there’s no imbalance.

01:00:56.094 --> 01:01:00.386
They are equal but not similar as I have told many a time.

01:01:00.678 --> 01:01:03.845
Now in the case of Shri Rama, He left His wife.

01:01:04.011 --> 01:01:07.845
When it came to Sita, She left Him too.

01:01:08.011 --> 01:01:11.011
But She left Him as a woman would leave

01:01:11.219 --> 01:01:14.594
and He left Her as a man would leave.

01:01:16.511 --> 01:01:19.094
She also left Him.

01:01:20.928 --> 01:01:25.594
But in a way that is suitable for a woman to do.

01:01:26.052 --> 01:01:30.928
And He did it in a way that is suitable to a king.

01:01:31.511 --> 01:01:36.052
In the same way, a woman when she acts, she has to act like a woman.

01:01:36.302 --> 01:01:39.094
The same thing she may do as the man does,

01:01:39.302 --> 01:01:44.177
but she has to be a woman or a man has to be a man.

01:01:44.594 --> 01:01:46.928
So that’s the maryada purushottama,

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:50.511
is the one who is the highest among all the men,

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.928
which is all the maryada, all the boundaries that he observes.

01:01:56.177 --> 01:02:00.219
The boundaries are such that you do not try to overpower others

01:02:00.428 --> 01:02:06.010
or you do not try to take their seats.

01:02:06.428 --> 01:02:09.845
For example, I’ve seen those who are aggressive

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:15.678
also show up in our programs, they will be the first before Me.

01:02:15.886 --> 01:02:18.428
They will be, as soon as I open the gates,

01:02:18.636 --> 01:02:21.511
they’ll be somewhere there standing.

01:02:21.761 --> 01:02:25.136
They, they will be the first in everything.

01:02:25.386 --> 01:02:29.052
That’s not being maryada. You should be at the back.

01:02:29.261 --> 01:02:32.886
Should be…, there are leaders you have got, they can sit in front.

01:02:33.052 --> 01:02:35.302
Try to be on the back. “I want to be first..."

01:02:35.511 --> 01:02:39.219
Then I’ve said once “the first of the first.”

01:02:39.886 --> 01:02:42.052
You know the story of first of the first.

01:02:42.302 --> 01:02:45.761
So you become first of the first and that’s what happens to you

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:48.594
when you try to show off.

01:02:48.803 --> 01:02:53.010
And I know all of them who are like that.

01:02:54.177 --> 01:02:58.010
To be in the background

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.803
is the most respectable thing to do.

01:03:03.511 --> 01:03:07.511
To go forward first, to jump forward first,

01:03:07.761 --> 01:03:10.386
to stand near the door if Mother is coming, you see.

01:03:10.594 --> 01:03:14.136
As soon as I see the person, I said, “Oh back again.”

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:18.011
There’s some who do Aartis just because to show off,

01:03:18.219 --> 01:03:21.302
some throw flowers to show off, they must be the first.

01:03:21.511 --> 01:03:24.594
And, somehow or another, they get also the position

01:03:24.803 --> 01:03:28.219
because of their assertions and askings.

01:03:28.469 --> 01:03:30.219
The leaders have to be careful

01:03:30.428 --> 01:03:34.094
and not to give such eyed duties to people

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:39.636
who really upset Me very much because of their arrogance,

01:03:39.928 --> 01:03:45.177
because of their showing offs.

01:03:45.761 --> 01:03:49.386
I have to say one thing today that, under the circumstances,

01:03:49.678 --> 01:03:54.094
we have to decide that if the leaders don’t have wives

01:03:54.302 --> 01:03:59.010
who are humble, who are kind, who are compassionate

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:03.928
and who are Gruha Lakshmis, who are very sweet with the Collective,

01:04:04.094 --> 01:04:10.594
we’ll have to cancel the husband as well as the wife from the leadership.

01:04:11.678 --> 01:04:15.594
We cannot have leaders who have wives who are horrid.

01:04:15.803 --> 01:04:22.720
We cannot, because the wife of a leader is like a mother.

01:04:23.678 --> 01:04:30.594
There are five types of mothers described, one of them is the one

01:04:30.803 --> 01:04:33.970
who is the wife of the guru or of the leader.

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:36.886
And if the leader has a wife of that kind

01:04:37.219 --> 01:04:40.928
it’s better in all sense he should withdraw.

01:04:41.219 --> 01:04:43.678
Improve his wife. Do whatever is possible.

01:04:43.886 --> 01:04:46.970
Till she’s all right, he should not be the leader.

01:04:47.136 --> 01:04:50.136
Is a very important thing because I have seen

01:04:50.344 --> 01:04:53.594
such women bring down the men, not only that,

01:04:53.803 --> 01:04:56.136
but bring down the Sahaja Yoga,

01:04:56.344 --> 01:05:00.761
Sahaja Yogis and the whole organization of God.

01:05:01.428 --> 01:05:05.803
So one has to be careful  and the women have to understand

01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:09.052
that if they are the wives of the leaders

01:05:09.261 --> 01:05:12.928
they have to be extremely good, kind,

01:05:14.636 --> 01:05:18.553
generous, sharing, looking after,

01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:24.094
absolutely motherly, and should not tolerate nonsense

01:05:24.302 --> 01:05:28.302
and should correct when people are doing wrong.

01:05:28.553 --> 01:05:31.594
They should not report anyone to their husbands,

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:35.886
should not take over themselves the responsibility of doing things

01:05:36.052 --> 01:05:38.678
which they are not supposed to do.

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:44.010
If they are not of that level, they are of no use to people

01:05:44.219 --> 01:05:51.261
and they have no business to be proud of being the wives of the leaders.

01:05:53.052 --> 01:05:59.136
From Shri Rama’s life we learn a lot and from Sitaji’s life also.

01:05:59.344 --> 01:06:06.052
Both of them have done so much for us, bring forth such a great life.

01:06:06.261 --> 01:06:09.928
All their lives they suffered and suffered and suffered.

01:06:10.094 --> 01:06:13.511
They lived in the villages. They lived in the forest.

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:16.678
While they were the king and the queen they had never known

01:06:16.886 --> 01:06:21.511
what is discomfort. They traveled all the way bare feet.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:24.970
They went through all kinds of tortures of life.

01:06:25.136 --> 01:06:29.970
Sita was taken away by Ravana, who was a horrid man.

01:06:30.136 --> 01:06:32.553
She had to live with a rakshasa, can you imagine?

01:06:32.761 --> 01:06:37.302
She lived with a rakshasa and there She showed her greatness.

01:06:37.511 --> 01:06:44.761
The characters of different nature, like Sita and Shri Rama,

01:06:45.136 --> 01:06:51.803
they were showing the complementary attributes

01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:55.136
that there are, very complementary, and if that is so

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:59.845
then the husband wife’s relations beautiful are in Sahaja Yoga.

01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:04.845
That’s the way it should be. I find some people are very nice.

01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:09.553
Some leaders are extremely nice, but wives can be very hard,

01:07:09.761 --> 01:07:15.010
can be very stiff,

01:07:15.428 --> 01:07:22.761
or could be very mischievous, could be troublesome, selfish.

01:07:24.469 --> 01:07:27.720
You cannot grow in Sahaja Yoga with these qualities.

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:32.386
It's such a luck and chance that your husband is the leader,

01:07:32.594 --> 01:07:37.720
is the highest man in your nation in Sahaja Yoga

01:07:37.928 --> 01:07:43.511
and where you have to be up to his ability,

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:49.136
capability and his name, otherwise you have no authority.

01:07:49.553 --> 01:07:53.386
That’s why I have to tell you that on this day of Dassera,

01:07:53.636 --> 01:08:00.386
let us decide that we are going to have Ramraj in Sahaja Yoga,

01:08:00.636 --> 01:08:05.302
where there is benevolence, there is love, compassion,

01:08:05.511 --> 01:08:10.970
security, peace, joy, discipline among ourselves.

01:08:11.136 --> 01:08:13.386
The whole disciplining is within ourselves.

01:08:13.594 --> 01:08:16.136
What I say about Shri Rama is that

01:08:16.344 --> 01:08:21.011
He Himself has put Himself into the discipline of maryada.

01:08:21.219 --> 01:08:24.511
In the same way, we ourselves should put ourselves

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.177
into the discipline of maryada.

01:08:29.428 --> 01:08:32.720
Is a very great thing that it should happen in Switzerland

01:08:32.928 --> 01:08:37.136
because Switzerland needs it the most,

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:41.010
the blessings of Shri Ram.

01:08:42.219 --> 01:08:46.010
The way it is going on in this country,

01:08:46.386 --> 01:08:53.511
this very selfish, non-benevolent activities going on,

01:08:53.803 --> 01:09:00.302
ruining all the poorer nations by this kind of a selfish attitude,

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:04.428
a very narrow attitude, very low level attitude

01:09:04.636 --> 01:09:10.678
towards the money of these poorer nations.

01:09:11.553 --> 01:09:15.886
Is important, very important for us today

01:09:16.052 --> 01:09:20.094
to pray for the emancipation of the hearts of those people

01:09:20.302 --> 01:09:22.970
who are just butchering.

01:09:23.136 --> 01:09:25.970
In these modern times, we don’t have wars

01:09:26.136 --> 01:09:29.136
but financially they are butchering people,

01:09:29.344 --> 01:09:34.302
they are killing them by depriving them of their own money

01:09:34.511 --> 01:09:37.553
and their own benevolence.

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:41.511
So, if Ramrajya has to come,

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:45.678
then Rama is to be born in the hearts of people

01:09:45.928 --> 01:09:48.970
who are at the helm of affairs. And that’s how

01:09:49.136 --> 01:09:53.678
we have to pray to Shri Ram  that, “Be kind and compassionate

01:09:53.886 --> 01:09:58.219
so that you could be born into the hearts of these people.”

01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:03.970
May God bless you all.

01:10:09.136 --> 01:10:12.094
May I have some water please.

01:10:14.594 --> 01:10:18.011
I do not know, how I spoke today, because the vibrations are so much,

01:10:18.219 --> 01:10:19.970
it's very difficult.

01:10:20.052 --> 01:10:22.511
Can I have some water please. Thank youday of Dassera,

01:07:53.636 --> 01:08:00.386
let us decide that we are going to have Ramraj in Sahaja Yoga,

01:08:00.636 --> 01:08:05.302
where there is benevolence, there is love, compassion,

01:08:05.511 --> 01:08:10.970
security, peace, joy, discipline among ourselves.

01:08:11.136 --> 01:08:13.386
The whole disciplining is within ourselves.

01:08:13.594 --> 01:08:16.136
What I say about Shri Rama is that

01:08:16.344 --> 01:08:21.011
He Himself has put Himself into the discipline of maryada.

01:08:21.219 --> 01:08:24.511
In the same way, we ourselves should put ourselves

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.177
into the discipline of maryada.

01:08:29.428 --> 01:08:32.720
Is a very great thing that it should happen in Switzerland

01:08:32.928 --> 01:08:37.136
because Switzerland needs it the most,

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:41.010
the blessings of Shri Ram.

01:08:42.219 --> 01:08:46.010
The way it is going on in this country,

01:08:46.386 --> 01:08:53.511
this very selfish, non-benevolent activities going on,

01:08:53.803 --> 01:09:00.302
ruining all the poorer nations by this kind of a selfish attitude,

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:04.428
a very narrow attitude, very low level attitude

01:09:04.636 --> 01:09:10.678
towards the money of these poorer nations.

01:09:11.553 --> 01:09:15.886
Is important, very important for us today

01:09:16.052 --> 01:09:20.094
to pray for the emancipation of the hearts of those people

01:09:20.302 --> 01:09:22.970
who are just butchering.

01:09:23.136 --> 01:09:25.970
In these modern times, we don’t have wars

01:09:26.136 --> 01:09:29.136
but financially they are butchering people,

01:09:29.344 --> 01:09:34.302
they are killing them by depriving them of their own money

01:09:34.511 --> 01:09:37.553
and their own benevolence.

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:41.511
So, if Ramrajya has to come,

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:45.678
then Rama is to be born in the hearts of people

01:09:45.928 --> 01:09:48.970
who are at the helm of affairs. And that’s how

01:09:49.136 --> 01:09:53.678
we have to pray to Shri Ram  that, “Be kind and compassionate

01:09:53.886 --> 01:09:58.219
so that you could be born into the hearts of these people.”

01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:03.970
May God bless you all.

01:10:09.136 --> 01:10:12.094
May I have some water please.

01:10:14.594 --> 01:10:18.011
I do not know, how I spoke today, because the vibrations are so much,

01:10:18.219 --> 01:10:19.970

01:10:20.052 --> 01:10:22.511
Can I have some water please. Thank you
