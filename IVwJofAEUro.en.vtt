04:19.000 --> 04:24.583
Today we are celebrating in Switzerland

04:25.125 --> 04:29.458
the coronation of Shri Rama on Dassera Day.

04:31.542 --> 04:34.500
Many things happened on Dassera Day.

04:34.667 --> 04:36.500
The most important was

04:36.667 --> 04:42.625
that Shri Rama was “coronated”

04:44.291 --> 04:47.625
as a king on this day.

04:51.125 --> 04:58.125
He also killed Ravana on this day.

04:59.625 --> 05:02.875
Many may say that “how can it be He killed Ravana

05:03.041 --> 05:06.583
and He was “coronated” on the same date?”

05:06.792 --> 05:13.542
In those days in India, we had supersonic aeroplanes

05:14.709 --> 05:19.792
and - is a fact, and the aeroplane’s name was Pushpak,

05:20.166 --> 05:22.208
meaning “the flower”.

05:22.417 --> 05:26.583
It was called as Pushpak and it has a tremendous speed.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
So after killing Ravana He came to Ayodhya with His wife

05:33.250 --> 05:37.917
and that was the day He was crowned.

05:39.417 --> 05:45.959
On the ninth day, He worshiped the Goddess to get strength,

05:46.417 --> 05:49.500
Shakti, for his weapons,

05:49.834 --> 05:53.999
and the tenth day He killed Ravana.

05:54.875 --> 05:58.333
So, you can imagine how much advanced people were there

05:58.542 --> 06:02.333
at the time of Shri Rama and His kingdom.

06:02.583 --> 06:07.291
The reason was the king was an incarnation;

06:07.542 --> 06:14.000
also He was a benevolent king as described by Socrates.

06:15.834 --> 06:20.375
Shri Rama’s story is very interesting throughout

06:20.625 --> 06:25.417
and we have now a beautiful series about Him

06:25.667 --> 06:32.667
done by our television in India, which is sold for a very good price,

06:32.875 --> 06:39.250
maybe we might be able to present you all with one, when you come there.

06:39.709 --> 06:46.792
But the story of Rama they say was written before He was born.

06:48.250 --> 06:55.208
Even before there was any inkling of it.

06:55.792 --> 07:02.041
The seer, Valmiki, wrote the whole story of Shri Rama.

07:02.834 --> 07:06.291
Shri Rama’s birth and all that

07:06.458 --> 07:13.458
are brought forth by the Agni, the fire,

07:14.625 --> 07:21.667
and He was born in the Dynasty of the Surya, is the sun.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.542
So with all that,

07:25.959 --> 07:31.250
born out of the blessings of the Agni, that is fire,

07:31.417 --> 07:38.458
and also was born in the dynasty of Surya,

07:39.166 --> 07:46.166
He was one of the mildest avataras you have ever had.

07:47.083 --> 07:51.917
He’s known to be a very

07:56.834 --> 07:58.166
I mean English language

07:58.417 --> 08:01.667
formal person, in the sense

08:01.834 --> 08:08.750
sankoch - that He would go to any extent

08:09.792 --> 08:16.875
to bear upon Himself the problems than to tell others to do something.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.417
We still had many people in India like that.

08:21.750 --> 08:25.667
Like we had one prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri,

08:26.041 --> 08:27.959
and

08:28.750 --> 08:32.250
if he was sitting in the room and there are people sitting

08:32.458 --> 08:37.125
and there’s electricity was on somehow,

08:37.375 --> 08:40.959
say by light or something, and he wants to put it off,

08:41.125 --> 08:43.917
he would not ask anyone to put it off.

08:44.083 --> 08:47.333
Slowly he’ll get up from his seat,

08:47.583 --> 08:51.083
walk up to the switch and just put it off

08:51.333 --> 08:54.000
so that he shouldn’t ask for anything.

08:54.208 --> 08:58.000
This is one of the greatest quality of Shri Rama

08:58.250 --> 09:03.291
that He would not make anyone do anything for Him

09:03.500 --> 09:08.999
or order anything or would use someone for that purpose.

09:09.291 --> 09:14.875
See, He was the blessing of fire

09:15.291 --> 09:17.667
and born in the Surya.

09:17.917 --> 09:22.500
But what we find, those people who are born,

09:22.750 --> 09:26.625
maybe in very lowly families,

09:26.834 --> 09:30.542
in the negative families, the left-sided as you can call it,

09:30.750 --> 09:32.999
with all kinds of problems,

09:33.166 --> 09:39.834
have a terrible Agnya and a terrible Suryada.

09:40.917 --> 09:46.542
The person who is born in the Surya has to be extremely humble.

09:46.750 --> 09:52.417
He is the one who shows that nothing can affect him,

09:52.667 --> 09:58.500
nothing can make him feel that he is something great.

09:59.125 --> 10:03.291
Now, when we see His life further,

10:04.083 --> 10:06.166
He was a very humble man.

10:06.375 --> 10:13.000
We've seen now people who try to despise others,

10:13.375 --> 10:16.333
“I don’t like you”, “I don’t like”,

10:16.542 --> 10:19.875
“It’s not good”, “It’s very difficult”,

10:20.041 --> 10:26.834
is a sign that such a person is extremely low in character,

10:27.750 --> 10:31.500
has no character at all but is low in character.

10:31.709 --> 10:35.500
Anybody who has any character is shown

10:35.709 --> 10:40.208
by the tolerance he has of other people.

10:40.999 --> 10:48.208
Intolerance is a sign of a person who is extremely egoistical

10:48.458 --> 10:53.542
and has,  is vain, there’s vanity.

10:54.041 --> 11:01.500
Shri Rama was so much loved by the people where He ruled in that state

11:01.999 --> 11:05.959
and He had the most beautiful wife

11:06.125 --> 11:11.750
of the most venerated father, Janaka,

11:11.959 --> 11:16.709
and who was the beloved son of His father.

11:16.917 --> 11:21.166
But He was such an humble man, such an humble man,

11:21.375 --> 11:25.333
that in all His character you see the beauty.

11:25.542 --> 11:30.625
Like, He was going by a little boat

11:30.834 --> 11:35.250
when He went for His exile.

11:35.458 --> 11:40.999
And the one who was taking Him was an ordinary boatman.

11:41.250 --> 11:46.208
And the boatman was feeling very much upset

11:46.417 --> 11:49.417
that he’s sitting before the king of Ayodhya

11:49.625 --> 11:52.041
and he doesn’t have proper clothes.

11:52.291 --> 11:58.125
So Shri Rama, who was Himself was wearing nothing but

11:59.125 --> 12:04.333
valkalas - are the clothes which are worn by the village people

12:04.542 --> 12:09.500
or worn by the people who live in the primitive areas,

12:09.709 --> 12:15.000
only kind of leaves that they have.

12:15.208 --> 12:18.709
He had to wear that because His mother, the stepmother,

12:18.917 --> 12:22.792
asked for that kind of boon from the father.

12:23.208 --> 12:27.333
And then Shri Rama just told him,

12:27.583 --> 12:31.834
“Why are you worried? I am wearing this. I am no more a king.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.917
I am sitting before you like this. You should be quite comforted.

12:36.083 --> 12:40.166
And I really don’t know how to steer the boat

12:40.417 --> 12:44.333
while you know how to steer the boat so why should you be worried?”

12:44.542 --> 12:49.041
Like that He kept even the people

12:49.250 --> 12:53.875
who we would call as low in society

12:54.041 --> 13:00.875
at a very high pedestal, which shows that He respected human beings.

13:01.083 --> 13:04.709
He Himself is called as Mariada Purushottama,

13:04.917 --> 13:08.083
means He was the one who had to knew

13:08.333 --> 13:11.959
how far to go with someone, Mariadas

13:12.125 --> 13:16.709
How to talk to someone, how to approach someone,

13:16.917 --> 13:21.083
while we find people who misbehave,

13:21.291 --> 13:24.083
even with their husbands, with their wives, with their children,

13:24.291 --> 13:30.792
with everyone and also outside they are about to jump on others.

13:31.208 --> 13:35.041
That’s absolutely against Rama.  It’s like Ravana.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.458
Even Ravana was not like this.

13:39.417 --> 13:41.999
He was also of not that nature

13:42.208 --> 13:45.792
because he had certain dharmas within him. He was a realized soul

13:45.999 --> 13:51.625
but he had become a rakshasa because he became arrogant,

13:51.834 --> 13:54.667
but even his arrogance cannot be matched

13:54.875 --> 14:00.333
with many modern people and modern girls and men that I hear and see,

14:00.583 --> 14:04.375
that it is surprising they have really surpassed Ravana.

14:04.583 --> 14:08.166
Ravana only had ten heads but sometimes I feel

14:08.375 --> 14:12.166
that the modern men might have, or the women specially,

14:12.375 --> 14:17.041
might have hundred and eight heads.

14:18.583 --> 14:25.083
The arrogance, the amount of expression of hatred,

14:25.375 --> 14:30.709
is so ridiculous and makes a person look so useless,

14:30.917 --> 14:33.667
but I see such people very common

14:33.875 --> 14:38.709
and in Sahaja Yoga also they crawl somehow.

14:41.792 --> 14:48.083
Actually, such people are absolutely despised by God Almighty.

14:49.166 --> 14:52.999
You go further with His life, see He went

14:53.166 --> 14:58.625
and into the village where a very old woman

14:58.834 --> 15:02.333
who was belonging to the primitive class of beings,

15:02.792 --> 15:08.999
had very few teeth, and she brought some

15:10.375 --> 15:13.875
some fruits, little fruits we call as ber,

15:14.041 --> 15:16.417
and she brought and gave it to Him,

15:16.625 --> 15:21.083
that “Shri Ram, you see, I have got these for you.

15:21.333 --> 15:25.250
I don’t have anything else. And these, I’ve tested all of them.”

15:25.458 --> 15:28.583
Actually in India, if you put in the mouth it is utishta,

15:28.792 --> 15:30.875
nobody will touch it.

15:31.041 --> 15:35.792
But she says, “I have tasted all of them by piercing my teeth into it

15:35.999 --> 15:38.667
and I have seen that none of them are sour.”

15:38.917 --> 15:42.333
Shri Rama didn’t like sour fruits, she knew,

15:42.792 --> 15:46.041
so, “None of them are sour and you can have them.”

15:46.250 --> 15:50.166
I mean, in a way, if it is done to somebody in the west

15:50.375 --> 15:53.083
they will hit you hard.

15:54.291 --> 15:57.041
Immediately Shri Rama rushed forward

15:57.291 --> 16:02.834
and took the bers from her hand,

16:03.041 --> 16:06.542
kissed her hand, said, "All right, all right, I’m going to have them.”

16:06.750 --> 16:09.750
With such enthusiasm He ate them.

16:09.959 --> 16:15.999
So Lakshmana was little angry at that lady, “What’s this going on?”

16:16.166 --> 16:20.000
So Sitaji said, “Oh do you like them very much?”

16:20.208 --> 16:22.250
He said, “Yes, but I’m not going to give you anything.”

16:22.458 --> 16:26.917
She said, “No, I am your half body. You have to give me.”

16:27.083 --> 16:30.291
So He gave some to Sitaji. So Sitaji ate,

16:30.500 --> 16:35.166
“Yaah, what a thing! It’s like nectar of heaven I am eating.”

16:35.375 --> 16:38.500
So Lakshmana felt very jealous.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.166
He said, “Sister-in-law, can I not have a little of it?”

16:44.375 --> 16:47.959
She said, “No. I can’t give you. You ask your brother.

16:48.125 --> 16:50.166
I’m not going to give you. I have a very little share.

16:50.375 --> 16:52.500
Why don’t you ask your brother?”

16:52.709 --> 16:56.250
So he goes to his brother, he says, “Can I have some more?”

16:56.458 --> 17:03.875
So Shri Rama smiled and gave him that ber which was eaten,

17:04.041 --> 17:09.125
or touched, or was pierced, by the teeth of a primitive woman,

17:09.375 --> 17:15.959
who is actually an outcast according to the Brahminic laws of India.

17:18.250 --> 17:21.959
The sweetness of Shri Rama,

17:22.709 --> 17:27.999
the way He used to make people feel comfortable,

17:29.166 --> 17:34.667
like I would say, an example of a oyster

17:34.875 --> 17:41.875
who gets a little stone into the body of the shell,

17:43.208 --> 17:48.500
takes out a kind of a shiny liquid

17:48.709 --> 17:51.959
and covers it with that shiny liquid

17:52.125 --> 17:56.959
and makes it into a pearl to be comfortable.

17:59.291 --> 18:02.041
Now, He didn’t want His own comfort.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.375
Rama is a little bit different

18:05.583 --> 18:12.792
that He wanted to make everyone into a diamond, or a pearl,

18:13.000 --> 18:18.999
so that the other person would shine and would look nice,

18:19.208 --> 18:22.250
and that’s how He felt comforted.

18:23.291 --> 18:28.834
His qualities, if you have to imbibe, first of all

18:29.041 --> 18:34.875
we have to understand the innate situation of Shri Rama.

18:35.959 --> 18:42.375
Shri Rama is placed on the right hand side of your heart,

18:44.208 --> 18:48.999
right hand side, right heart.  He’s placed there.

18:49.542 --> 18:53.166
Now in a human being there is no right heart.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.959
If you tell somebody there's right heart, they’ll say, “What,

18:56.125 --> 18:58.875
there are two hearts, or three hearts?”

18:59.166 --> 19:04.417
In our Sahaja Yoga we have three hearts:

19:05.709 --> 19:09.709
one is the left, another is the right, and one is the center.

19:09.917 --> 19:14.667
Now the right heart is a very important thing.

19:15.333 --> 19:22.041
The right heart looks after the whole

19:22.625 --> 19:25.625
lungs, both the lungs,

19:26.208 --> 19:29.542
all the throat,

19:29.750 --> 19:35.750
the trachea, the nose, the inner part.

19:36.166 --> 19:39.125
The outer side is looked after, we can say,

19:39.333 --> 19:41.875
the features are given by Shri Krishna

19:42.041 --> 19:45.834
but the inner part of it is all done by Shri Rama.

19:46.041 --> 19:50.792
They are the same, but one acts as an inner part,

19:50.999 --> 19:54.542
another as the outer part.

19:54.750 --> 19:59.333
It gives you the ears, from the inner part, Shri Rama does.

19:59.959 --> 20:04.625
He gives you the eyes, in the inner part of the eyes.

20:04.959 --> 20:09.750
Now, it’s so important to have the inner side all right

20:09.959 --> 20:14.375
than the outer side. Is an example of Shri Rama,

20:14.583 --> 20:21.083
He never cared for the outer side or the outward looks of a person.

20:22.542 --> 20:25.709
Because He came before Shri Krishna,

20:25.917 --> 20:29.999
He tried to build up the inner side of a human being.

20:30.208 --> 20:33.083
So we can say, though He is on the right heart,

20:33.291 --> 20:36.083
He acts through your Hamsa Chakra

20:36.291 --> 20:41.083
and partly through your Vishuddhi Chakra in the inner side of it.

20:41.291 --> 20:45.583
Because Shri Krishna, in the inner side of it is Shri Rama,

20:45.999 --> 20:49.083
is Shri Vishnu.

20:49.667 --> 20:53.166
So, when somebody is,

20:54.041 --> 20:57.834
say, not good looking according to the western standard,

20:57.999 --> 21:02.625
according to Me the western standards are rather funny,

21:03.999 --> 21:07.291
because western standards don’t look like

21:07.500 --> 21:11.083
neither like Krishna or Shri Rama.

21:12.667 --> 21:19.667
The person like Shri Rama was a very healthy, tall person

21:19.875 --> 21:23.917
with his hands up to the knees,

21:24.083 --> 21:28.875
ajanabav, means the one who has ajanabav,

21:29.625 --> 21:34.166
and He was plump, both of them were plump.

21:34.417 --> 21:37.083
They had to be plump people, because they were

21:37.291 --> 21:41.583
though they were born of the Agni, He was born of the Agni,

21:41.792 --> 21:48.333
but the water is the main element of Shri Vishnu.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.875
So they were all plump people.

21:51.041 --> 21:54.834
They were not thin like sticks as today’s modern ideas are,

21:55.000 --> 21:58.999
to be thin like sticks and like TB-patients.

21:59.166 --> 22:04.041
But it doesn’t mean all plump people are good.

22:04.417 --> 22:07.458
We always logically think that plump people are,

22:07.667 --> 22:10.375
if  Mother says so, then plump people are good. Is not the point.

22:10.583 --> 22:13.166
The inner side of it I am saying.

22:13.375 --> 22:17.417
The inner side of it is just the opposite.

22:17.625 --> 22:22.250
Inner side of it is absolutely beautiful

22:22.458 --> 22:29.166
and absolutely full of love, affection and warmth.

22:29.625 --> 22:32.959
A person who doesn’t have these things,

22:33.125 --> 22:38.125
is a sign of a person who is not a Sahaja Yogi, first of all.

22:38.709 --> 22:41.375
A person who is very loud,

22:41.917 --> 22:46.750
talks loudly, speaks loudly, laughs at wrong places

22:47.083 --> 22:50.999
must be half mad but cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

22:52.417 --> 22:56.875
See this softness of Shri Rama goes to the extremes

22:57.041 --> 23:00.125
where I call the sankocha, the formality, the formal

23:00.333 --> 23:04.959
but it is English language, “formal” is not the word, sankoch.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.667
He was once

23:10.959 --> 23:14.792
when He was fighting Ravana,

23:14.999 --> 23:21.834
He was taking out with His arrow his ten heads one after another.

23:21.999 --> 23:25.917
And if He took out one then took out the second,

23:26.083 --> 23:30.542
the first one would come back so because he had a kind of a blessing

23:30.750 --> 23:35.583
that nobody can kill him by hitting him on his head.

23:35.917 --> 23:38.375
So Lakshmana says, “You know for definite

23:38.667 --> 23:43.500
that this Ravana cannot be killed by hitting on his head,

23:43.709 --> 23:46.834
so why don’t You hit him in his heart?”

23:46.999 --> 23:49.667
So He said, “The reason is this,

23:49.917 --> 23:56.750
that just now in his heart is Mahalakshmi, the Sita.

23:56.959 --> 24:01.834
Sita is sitting in his heart. And how can I hit him on his heart ?

24:02.000 --> 24:05.333
Because She’s there,  She might be hurt.”

24:05.917 --> 24:08.500
“So what’s the use of hitting on the head?” he said.

24:08.709 --> 24:11.792
He said, “Because, once I start hitting him on the head fast,

24:11.999 --> 24:13.333
his attention will go there.

24:13.542 --> 24:16.125
As soon as his attention will go into his head

24:16.333 --> 24:19.166
then I can hit him on his heart.”

24:19.959 --> 24:22.959
See the sankoch?

24:25.333 --> 24:29.333
See the sankoch, the way He talked.

24:31.250 --> 24:34.375
Now we have - Tina, what is wrong with you?

24:34.625 --> 24:39.166
Why are you all the time smiling like this. Can't you keep quiet?

24:39.959 --> 24:42.375
What is there to smile, about certain things,

24:42.583 --> 24:46.417
where you don't have to smile?  Keep quiet!

24:46.750 --> 24:51.709
Now, then what happened, that He was

24:55.667 --> 25:00.417
so kind once when a very ugly woman, Shurpanaka,

25:00.667 --> 25:05.750
came to entice Him. And she said, she came to entice,

25:05.959 --> 25:09.458
she said that, “Rama why don’t You marry me?”

25:09.667 --> 25:13.166
I mean, to a person like Rama who is Mariada Purushottama

25:13.375 --> 25:16.291
to ask such a horrible questions.

25:16.750 --> 25:21.625
Somebody would have really beaten her up if not anything else.

25:21.999 --> 25:25.417
So, Shri Ram smiled. He said,

25:25.667 --> 25:27.333
“Madam, I’m sorry.

25:27.542 --> 25:34.125
I have a wife and I believe in one wife, aika patni vrat.

25:34.417 --> 25:36.417
So I’m sorry I can’t marry you.”

25:36.625 --> 25:39.917
But mischievously He says, “All right, My brother is there.

25:40.083 --> 25:44.625
His wife is left in Ayodhya. You can ask.”

25:46.625 --> 25:50.625
So he went to her and he asked,

25:53.458 --> 25:57.750
She went to him and asked, “Lakshmana why don’t you marry me? ”

25:57.959 --> 25:59.291
She had become very beautiful.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.333
She has transformed herself to a beautiful woman.

26:02.542 --> 26:05.291
She must have gone to some beauty parlor or something,

26:05.500 --> 26:08.875
but she made herself like that, and she was there.

26:09.041 --> 26:13.917
And he looked at her so angry, he said, “You, the ugly,

26:14.083 --> 26:17.667
why do you want to ask such a question?”  He cut her nose.

26:17.917 --> 26:20.000
When he cut her nose, that was in Nasik

26:20.208 --> 26:22.500
and that’s why Nasika means the nose,

26:22.709 --> 26:24.500
and that’s why you have been to Nasik,

26:24.709 --> 26:26.999
that’s the place where he cut her nose.

26:27.166 --> 26:29.917
He was very angry.  But Shri Rama did not.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.250
He said in a way that’s very convincing that,

26:32.458 --> 26:38.208
“See I have a wife and I am a person who believes in My one wife.”

26:38.417 --> 26:42.625
Now the another character about Him was that He was consistent.

26:43.250 --> 26:47.000
He was never inconsistent like Shri Krishna.

26:47.583 --> 26:54.750
Shri Krishna was a diplomat and diplomacy is in being inconsistent.

26:58.709 --> 27:01.999
Shri Krishna’s style was different. But ….

27:02.166 --> 27:05.375
Why?  What is the matter with you?  Why, what is it?

27:05.667 --> 27:07.583
You come ad sit here. This side come along Tina.

27:07.792 --> 27:11.542
Come and sit on the other side. Why do you talk to her?

27:12.208 --> 27:15.208
Go and sit at the back. Go.

27:17.166 --> 27:22.166
She has already given me a very bad time in Pune, and now here she is.

27:24.250 --> 27:26.875
While I am talking, please don't talk to each other.

27:27.041 --> 27:28.709
This is the least you can do to me.

27:28.917 --> 27:32.333
Have you seen any Indians behave like this?

27:42.959 --> 27:45.917
It's very disturbing.

27:46.667 --> 27:50.875
I am concentrating on you why you are not concentrating on me.

27:51.083 --> 27:53.875
It's alright, when there is a joke, something - you laugh.

27:54.041 --> 27:58.083
What's the need to talk to each other, I can`t understand.

28:02.959 --> 28:05.458
Alright. Sorry I had to say that.

28:05.667 --> 28:09.208
You see at the time, when I am discussing Shri Rama.

28:09.959 --> 28:13.125
Shri Rama would not have said that.

28:14.291 --> 28:18.500
But in Sahaja Yoga, you can’t carry on like Shri Rama.

28:18.750 --> 28:21.999
Sometimes you have to be like Parashurama also,

28:22.166 --> 28:25.333
otherwise things don’t work out.

28:26.583 --> 28:30.917
Now, when it went ahead with it

28:31.083 --> 28:34.041
in His character, which was so beautiful,

28:34.250 --> 28:37.583
that you find He was such a consistent person.

28:38.041 --> 28:44.250
Whatever He said, all the life He carried that. For example, He said,

28:44.458 --> 28:49.166
“I am the one who believes in one wife, aika patni vrat.”

28:50.333 --> 28:57.291
Now He had a very nice wife, no doubt, very beautiful wife,

28:57.500 --> 29:02.417
but She had gone to Ravana and He was left alone.

29:02.625 --> 29:05.834
When they wanted to start a kind of a yagya

29:06.000 --> 29:07.999
called as Rajasurya yagya

29:08.166 --> 29:15.083
which was meant to be  the conquering the whole world.

29:16.709 --> 29:18.083
Then they asked Him,

29:18.291 --> 29:21.041
“You have to marry, because you have to have your wife.”

29:21.291 --> 29:26.500
He said, “No, I can’t marry, because nobody could be like My wife

29:26.709 --> 29:31.583
and I can’t marry. I can forego this kind of a yagya,

29:31.834 --> 29:34.458
but I can’t marry again.”

29:34.667 --> 29:38.625
So, then they said, “All right, there’s only one thing you can do

29:38.834 --> 29:42.959
is to make a statue of Sita in gold

29:43.125 --> 29:50.125
and you have to use Her, that statue, as a wife representing.”

29:50.625 --> 29:54.917
He said, “That I will agree.” He took away all His ornaments,

29:55.083 --> 30:01.417
everything, and made that statue and He did this yagya.

30:01.667 --> 30:04.959
So whatever He said He followed thoroughly.

30:05.125 --> 30:08.375
In His dharma He was perfect.

30:08.583 --> 30:12.417
Another incident is that when

30:13.375 --> 30:17.250
Sita was lost.

30:17.667 --> 30:22.999
He never slept, He never slept on a bed,

30:23.291 --> 30:25.834
always on the Mother Earth.

30:26.250 --> 30:29.417
Never slept on a bed, always on the Mother Earth.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.709
The pain He had of His wife

30:31.917 --> 30:36.750
is very well described by all the poets of India.

30:37.083 --> 30:41.667
And when Sita left Him ultimately in a very mysterious way,

30:41.917 --> 30:44.709
She just disappeared in the Mother Earth

30:44.917 --> 30:46.834
because Mother Earth had given Her birth

30:47.000 --> 30:48.999
so She disappeared into Mother Earth.

30:49.166 --> 30:54.458
Then Shri Rama became absolutely lost

30:54.667 --> 30:57.917
and He jumped in the river Sarayu

30:58.208 --> 31:03.458
and disappeared in the water element from where He had come.

31:04.542 --> 31:08.291
Now this man had to give up His wife.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.000
In this contrast you can see

31:11.208 --> 31:15.667
the wave rising and falling of a personality.

31:16.250 --> 31:20.333
The society in which He lived, the state which He ruled,

31:20.583 --> 31:25.834
had an objection for a wife, who had lived with Ravana.

31:26.208 --> 31:28.500
And the public started talking about it.

31:28.709 --> 31:33.458
So, as a good king, He just, as a good king,

31:33.667 --> 31:40.667
He just decided that His wife should be left forever.

31:43.583 --> 31:50.083
And then He sent Her on a beautiful chariot

31:50.583 --> 31:55.041
with His prime minister

31:55.250 --> 31:58.500
and His brother, Lakshmana,

31:58.750 --> 32:02.083
who took Her down and left Her, told Her,

32:02.291 --> 32:06.834
this is what has happened and that Shri Rama has asked us

32:06.999 --> 32:11.792
to take you down to the ashram of Valmiki.

32:13.500 --> 32:20.208
As a result of that She got very upset and She said,

32:20.542 --> 32:23.291
She was Adi Shakti, so She doesn’t have to bother.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.750
She said, “You just leave Me here.”

32:25.959 --> 32:28.917
Very self-respecting person.

32:29.083 --> 32:31.959
She didn’t say, “No, no, no, no, I’ll come to Him”

32:32.125 --> 32:36.667
or “I’ll sue Him. I’ll go in the courts, get all His money.

32:36.875 --> 32:41.959
How dare He throw me out.”  Nothing of the kind.

32:44.834 --> 32:49.083
That’s the grace of a woman. Graciously She said, “All right,

32:49.291 --> 32:51.500
now you have listened to your brother.

32:51.709 --> 32:54.709
I’m your sister-in-law, elder too. Now you obey Me.

32:54.917 --> 32:59.250
And I tell you, as your sister-in-law, that you can now go.

32:59.458 --> 33:04.917
Leave Me here alone and I don’t want you to go any further with Me

33:05.083 --> 33:10.417
to deport Me with somebody. ” And She was pregnant.

33:12.208 --> 33:15.542
Here if it happens, of course horrible things can happen,

33:15.750 --> 33:19.125
but in India if such a thing happens, the wife will kill herself

33:19.333 --> 33:22.333
or she won’t be able to bear it.

33:22.542 --> 33:25.625
I think both things are just the same, an escape.

33:25.875 --> 33:29.583
If there’s no aggression then there is recession.

33:29.792 --> 33:33.250
But She said, “No. I have to give birth to these two children.

33:33.458 --> 33:36.417
I can look after Myself, all right. Graciously He’s done it,

33:36.625 --> 33:41.083
I am nothing and please tell Him not to worry about Me.”

33:41.750 --> 33:44.166
And She told Shri Rama, Shri Lakshmana that,

33:44.375 --> 33:47.208
“All right, you look after Him, that’s all I want.”

33:47.417 --> 33:51.125
And She told the chief minister, the mantri,

33:51.333 --> 33:55.792
that “You must look after the kingdom.”

33:59.500 --> 34:03.291
See the dignity, see the balance,

34:03.542 --> 34:06.917
see the character, the personality of Shri Rama.

34:07.250 --> 34:11.959
He was called as Mariada Purushottama. And look at His wife.

34:12.166 --> 34:15.709
She was equal to Him in every way.

34:16.625 --> 34:20.208
When She was kept by Ravana,

34:20.417 --> 34:27.083
Ravana was so frightened of Her Shakti that he would not touch Her.

34:27.667 --> 34:31.291
He used to frighten Her, say “I’ll do this to the women of India.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.125
I’ll do this to the women of the world.

34:33.333 --> 34:35.542
I’ll do that kind of a horrible thing.

34:35.750 --> 34:38.667
I’ll take another birth. I’ll misbehave.”

34:38.875 --> 34:42.542
She said, “Do what you like. You cannot touch Me.”

34:42.750 --> 34:48.125
He could not touch Her hand, he was so frightened.

34:48.834 --> 34:54.875
And when Hanumana brought the ring of Shri Rama

34:55.041 --> 35:02.291
and presented to Her and said that, “This is the ring of Shri Rama.”

35:02.750 --> 35:05.041
She said, “Yes, I know. How is He?” He said, “All right.”

35:05.250 --> 35:09.291
All enquiries She had about Herself. So He said,

35:09.500 --> 35:12.834
“Mother, I can take You on my back.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.542
I can easily take You. You come on My back and I’ll take You.”

35:16.750 --> 35:21.875
She said, “No. I won’t go with You. It's my ..

35:22.041 --> 35:28.083
It’s Shri Rama who is a brave king,

35:28.333 --> 35:35.333
He should come Himself, fight this Ravana, kill him because he’s evil,

35:36.166 --> 35:40.250
and then I will go with Him with all the glory.”

35:40.999 --> 35:43.125
She was not frightened of anything.

35:43.375 --> 35:47.583
For Her, the important thing was that Ravana should be killed.

35:47.875 --> 35:53.417
He’s evil and he should be killed by Rama.

35:53.667 --> 35:56.875
Such a great courage for a woman.

35:57.041 --> 36:01.667
Both sides if you see you’ll be surprised that how

36:01.999 --> 36:07.542
a woman’s character is such a powerful thing.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.500
It’s not a reactionary thing,

36:09.709 --> 36:12.500
“My husband is like this, that’s why I’m like that.”

36:12.709 --> 36:15.458
or “My husband doesn’t do this for me, that’s why I’m like that.

36:15.667 --> 36:17.667
My husband is gone away so I’m finished.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.125
What am I to do without my husband? ” Nothing of the kind.

36:20.333 --> 36:22.999
She stands on Her feet.

36:23.166 --> 36:26.208
She said “No,” to Hanumana

36:26.417 --> 36:30.458
and She stands on Her feet

36:30.667 --> 36:34.917
and She says, “When Rama will come and kill this evil

36:35.458 --> 36:38.625
and remove this evil from this earth,

36:38.834 --> 36:43.000
then only He can take Me with Him. I won’t go with You.

36:43.250 --> 36:45.750
I won’t escape. I won’t run away.

36:45.959 --> 36:49.500
Nothing.  I am going to face it Myself here.”

36:49.709 --> 36:52.375
For a woman it is too much to say,

36:52.583 --> 36:57.500
to be imprisoned in a horrible person’s jail

36:57.750 --> 37:02.667
or in a place which is so dangerous for Her,

37:02.875 --> 37:06.709
to say that “I won’t go. Whatever you may try,

37:06.917 --> 37:09.834
whatever tricks you may try, whatever you may say.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.458
I won’t go.”

37:12.750 --> 37:14.917
Just imagine.

37:15.333 --> 37:18.125
And Ravana was such a horrid fellow.

37:18.417 --> 37:22.667
He did all kinds of things to Her

37:22.875 --> 37:28.834
but She kept absolutely calm and quiet,

37:30.333 --> 37:33.625
waiting for Her husband to come back.

37:34.041 --> 37:38.291
Can we think of such women in modern times?

37:41.000 --> 37:47.083
So satisfied with themselves, so much in balance,

37:47.417 --> 37:54.208
so much full of confidence and strength.

37:57.333 --> 38:00.458
This is the message of Sita’s life.

38:00.709 --> 38:03.500
The benevolence of Shri Rama was shown

38:03.709 --> 38:08.083
when He started ruling the people.

38:09.542 --> 38:15.041
He was the one who cared for the needs of the people.

38:16.792 --> 38:21.959
For Him, it was important that the people whom He ruled

38:22.125 --> 38:25.250
should be happy and joyous.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.959
He looked after them with great love.

38:29.125 --> 38:32.291
He had two sons

38:32.542 --> 38:37.999
whom He looked after for a short time

38:38.166 --> 38:43.375
because they were lost with the mother, Sita,

38:43.875 --> 38:48.667
and they are the ones who found Him out in a way

38:48.999 --> 38:54.125
that Valmiki taught them how to sing the Ramayana.

38:54.333 --> 38:59.125
And they went to Ayodhya and sang the Ramayana.

38:59.542 --> 39:02.667
Rama went with them.

39:02.875 --> 39:06.333
And one day in one of the yagyas,

39:06.583 --> 39:10.166
when they caught the horse of Shri Rama,

39:11.625 --> 39:16.041
Hanumana found it impossible to fight those two boys

39:16.291 --> 39:18.250
and He couldn’t understand.

39:18.458 --> 39:23.250
Here now, the character of great Hanumana One has to describe.

39:23.458 --> 39:27.417
He went and told Shri Rama, “I can’t understand, these two boys,

39:27.625 --> 39:32.291
I can’t face them. I don’t know who they are.”

39:32.834 --> 39:36.125
So, Shri Rama went there.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.291
And these boys were standing with their arrows.

39:39.542 --> 39:44.041
Then Shri Sita appeared before them and She said,

39:44.250 --> 39:47.875
“You cannot fight. He is your father.”

39:48.959 --> 39:52.709
This made Hanumana realize it. And He said, “All right,

39:52.917 --> 39:57.792
I can fight Shri Rama now. Why did He leave you like this?”

39:58.375 --> 40:04.750
See the sweetness of Shri Hanumana who was such a great devotee,

40:04.959 --> 40:07.709
such a great devotee of Shri Rama,

40:07.917 --> 40:12.000
could see that, “He has done injustice to My Mother”

40:12.291 --> 40:14.250
and He stood for that.

40:14.500 --> 40:18.625
Is very sweet of Shri Hanumana to do that.

40:19.375 --> 40:25.291
Hanumana is, as you know, is the angel Gabriel

40:25.500 --> 40:31.875
who is innocence, simplicity, and dynamism.

40:32.542 --> 40:36.709
His dynamism was such that as soon as He was born,

40:36.917 --> 40:39.000
He said, “Better eat this sun

40:39.208 --> 40:44.875
because the sun is scorching the people in India.”

40:45.250 --> 40:47.999
So He went and gulped down the sun.

40:48.166 --> 40:51.875
People had to say that, “You see, though too the sun is scorching

40:52.041 --> 40:56.875
but it’s of great help. Please release the sun. Why did you eat it off?”

40:57.083 --> 40:59.667
So then He released the sun.

40:59.875 --> 41:04.917
Hanumana’s whole life was spent in serving Shri Rama.

41:05.083 --> 41:11.999
And He was such a dedicated bhakta of Shri Ram.

41:12.166 --> 41:17.333
Now here the contrast is also that Hanumana had navadha,

41:17.583 --> 41:23.709
navadha siddhis, navadha siddhis, nine siddhis,

41:24.125 --> 41:27.125
anima, ganima, raguma, and all sorts of things,

41:27.333 --> 41:30.166
that He could become small, He could become big, he could ...

41:30.375 --> 41:32.333
so many things He had.

41:32.542 --> 41:37.792
Despite all these siddhis and the amount of power He had,

41:37.999 --> 41:40.917
that Shri Rama once asked Him that,

41:41.083 --> 41:46.625
“My brother, Lakshmana, is being hit

41:46.875 --> 41:49.834
and he’s very sick. I mean, he’s just dying.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.083
So you go and get a particular kind of a sanjeevani,

41:54.291 --> 41:59.041
a kind of a herb, which I want to rub on his head.”

41:59.792 --> 42:02.750
So He went there and He found and he couldn’t find it

42:02.959 --> 42:07.542
so He brought the whole of the mountain on His hand and gave it to Rama,

42:07.750 --> 42:10.999
"Now You select, I don’t know. I can’t find it.”

42:11.458 --> 42:13.834
That is the Hanumana Shakti.

42:13.999 --> 42:18.750
And with all that power, He was such a humble person

42:18.959 --> 42:22.125
and such a dedicated person.

42:22.750 --> 42:27.208
This is the sign of a powerful Sahaja Yogi.

42:28.000 --> 42:34.999
Anybody who is powerful has to be humble and non-violent.

42:35.375 --> 42:38.333
Mahatma Gandhi used to say that,

42:38.583 --> 42:42.000
“What is the non-violence of the weak?”

42:42.250 --> 42:45.750
A weak has to be non-violent, what’s so great?

42:46.750 --> 42:52.667
But that’s a policy or a kind of a protection that he has.

42:52.959 --> 42:56.792
So a weak person has to be non-violent

42:56.999 --> 43:02.750
because he cannot face, he cannot protest.

43:03.083 --> 43:10.999
But non-violence of the powerful is the sign of real non-violence.

43:13.208 --> 43:17.208
Those who are powerful, if they are non-violent,

43:17.458 --> 43:22.208
that means they are quite confident of their powers.

43:22.417 --> 43:24.917
Those people who are confident of their powers,

43:25.083 --> 43:27.291
why should they aggress others?

43:27.500 --> 43:30.834
They just stand, “All right, come along, what do you want?”

43:31.000 --> 43:34.041
Even saying that, people run away.

43:35.709 --> 43:39.458
So those who are violent, angry, hot tempered,

43:39.709 --> 43:44.250
jump at everyone, torture everyone, trouble everyone,

43:44.458 --> 43:48.458
are the people who are very weak charactered.

43:48.750 --> 43:51.333
Their character is weak.

43:51.583 --> 43:54.333
If their character was all right

43:54.542 --> 43:57.875
then they would not have done all these things.

43:58.875 --> 44:04.208
That’s the sign of a person who is either possessed

44:04.417 --> 44:08.125
and under the influence of the possession - he’s doing that;

44:08.333 --> 44:12.083
or he’s too weak and he’s possessed by his anger

44:12.291 --> 44:18.166
because he doesn’t have that much power to bear anything.

44:19.041 --> 44:21.375
The most powerful thing is the Mother Earth

44:21.583 --> 44:23.667
because she has a power to bear.

44:23.875 --> 44:28.208
The one who has the power to bear, is the powerful.

44:29.125 --> 44:31.750
The one who does not have any power to bear,

44:31.959 --> 44:34.458
“I can’t bear. I don’t like. I this...”

44:34.667 --> 44:39.083
Such a person is a useless thing for this earth and sometimes I feel,

44:39.291 --> 44:42.375
“Why God created them?”

44:42.917 --> 44:45.792
It’s a headache to have a person round you,

44:45.999 --> 44:48.583
“I can’t eat this. I don’t like this.”

44:48.792 --> 44:52.834
Then why are you here? Nobody likes you either.

44:54.458 --> 44:57.333
No one likes such a person and that’s why that person is always,

44:57.542 --> 45:01.583
“I don’t like this. I don’t like that. I …”

45:04.250 --> 45:10.000
So the power of a person lies in bearing things.

45:10.333 --> 45:16.792
How much you can bear, how much you can undergo without feeling it?

45:16.999 --> 45:20.458
Like, you are say, in the jungle, you are happy.

45:20.667 --> 45:23.041
If you are in a palace you are happy.

45:23.250 --> 45:26.999
If you are with the this color or that color,

45:27.166 --> 45:29.792
if you are with this race or that race,

45:29.999 --> 45:35.999
if you are with this kind of life or that kind of life,

45:36.333 --> 45:38.083
you can bear it.

45:38.291 --> 45:43.834
And that bearing power gives you the caliber,

45:44.333 --> 45:49.500
the caliber to have Sahaja Yoga.

45:49.709 --> 45:56.792
It’s not that this is shown, it’s not that is being suffered,

45:57.875 --> 46:04.542
don’t have to say, “I suffer being like this.” No, you don’t suffer.

46:04.750 --> 46:07.792
It’s just by the way.

46:09.625 --> 46:13.333
For a person who wants all the comforts,

46:13.542 --> 46:18.625
a person who wants to live with all the luxuries,

46:19.625 --> 46:25.458
but not with any kind of defects or any deficiencies,

46:25.750 --> 46:30.750
is a person is a beggar, I would say, in every sense of the word.

46:31.750 --> 46:38.250
I mean, best things to get rid of problems is

46:38.792 --> 46:40.959
not to have them. In the sense:

46:41.125 --> 46:44.917
now I don’t drive so I have no problem of driving.

46:45.083 --> 46:50.500
I don’t have - I never telephone, so I don’t have problems of telephones.

46:52.208 --> 46:56.125
I don’t go to the banks, so I don’t have problems of the banks.

46:56.333 --> 47:01.709
The best is: I don’t have any income so I have no problem of income tax.

47:04.458 --> 47:07.208
Whatever bothers you, you just don’t have it.

47:07.458 --> 47:11.625
Why do you want to have it? Have it and then bother about it?

47:11.834 --> 47:15.667
It seems very funny that you can get rid of anything

47:15.875 --> 47:18.709
that bothers you very easily in this world.

47:18.917 --> 47:22.709
So you need not have that kind of a thing on your head.

47:22.917 --> 47:27.625
But when the word ‘problem’, specially in the European community

47:27.834 --> 47:30.125
‘problem’ is a very common word,

47:30.333 --> 47:34.291
but in English language we never learnt this word ‘problem’.

47:34.500 --> 47:41.625
You see only the ‘problem’ was used when we were studying geometry,

47:42.250 --> 47:46.250
geometrical problem, but we never knew there’s a problem in life.

47:46.458 --> 47:49.917
Later on when I came in contact with European community,

47:50.083 --> 47:54.417
they’ll say, “There’s no problem." "This is the problem.”

47:54.709 --> 48:00.291
At least in one day hundred times they say ‘problem’ word.

48:01.041 --> 48:04.667
So, for a problem the solution is

48:04.875 --> 48:08.709
not to have that thing which gives you problem.

48:08.917 --> 48:11.125
You can give up anything.

48:11.333 --> 48:13.875
Anything that you want, you can give up if you know

48:14.041 --> 48:17.500
how to detach yourself from that.

48:17.834 --> 48:21.834
Many people come and tell Me, “Mother we have an ego.

48:22.083 --> 48:26.542
That’s the problem.”  I said, “Then give up.”

48:26.959 --> 48:30.834
I mean, is simple, why do you have it?

48:31.250 --> 48:34.834
As if, you see, they want to say that, we

48:34.999 --> 48:39.375
“We have trouble with this thing but still we are clinging on to it.

48:39.625 --> 48:43.709
Like we are afraid of a crocodile

48:43.917 --> 48:48.083
but we want to put our foot into the mouth of the crocodile.

48:48.291 --> 48:53.625
And we have a problem that our foot will be eaten up by the crocodile.”

48:53.834 --> 48:57.458
Now give up.  But they will search out a crocodile,

48:57.667 --> 49:02.291
open the mouth, and put the foot in it and then come to Me and say,

49:02.500 --> 49:07.583
“Mother we have a problem. My foot is in the mouth of the crocodile.”

49:09.125 --> 49:12.959
To get to problems you have to get to it.

49:14.667 --> 49:20.999
But without getting to it, how will you get a problem?

49:21.625 --> 49:28.250
Say, for example, people have very silly, stupid problems. Now.

49:28.625 --> 49:30.875
The first problem somebody may have,

49:31.041 --> 49:35.208
“Oh I have to get my clothes pressed.”

49:35.417 --> 49:40.709
What’s the need? No problem. Wear them as they are. Who looks at it?

49:40.917 --> 49:43.250
“You see there are all the people who have pressed clothes.”

49:43.458 --> 49:46.792
Doesn’t matter what is there. If it is not pressed, such a, such a ...

49:46.999 --> 49:50.875
It’s a problem for them. It’s silly things like that,

49:51.041 --> 49:52.542
you’ll see very silly things.

49:52.750 --> 49:57.083
But the greatest problem I think you have is your watch.

49:57.375 --> 50:00.333
In Switzerland, I shouldn’t say so.

50:04.917 --> 50:11.792
You see the problem is like this, that now you have to go the airport.

50:12.250 --> 50:16.250
As soon as you tell somebody we have to go to the airport,

50:16.458 --> 50:22.875
now, I have to go, you don’t have to, everybody gets sort of a jumping

50:23.041 --> 50:26.375
as if standing on a jumping board. You see all of them jumping like that.

50:26.625 --> 50:29.250
“What’s the matter?” “Mother you have to go to the airport.”

50:29.458 --> 50:34.667
“So, it’s all right. I have to go. What’s, what's wrong with you?”

50:34.875 --> 50:37.166
“Is a problem. ” I say, “What’s the problem?

50:37.375 --> 50:41.083
I have to go. You just know that you don’t have to go at all

50:41.291 --> 50:43.458
and don’t have to come to the airport.

50:43.667 --> 50:46.959
And the aeroplane, if it comes and doesn’t take Me,

50:47.125 --> 50:49.208
I’m not going to come back on your heads

50:49.417 --> 50:52.417
so I’ll stay in a hotel. Don’t you worry.”

50:52.792 --> 50:55.500
But why are you so excited about it?

50:55.709 --> 50:58.125
The way people are excited that I must catch the plane,

50:58.333 --> 51:02.375
sometimes I feel as if they want to get rid of Me.

51:04.375 --> 51:10.417
So, this is a problem for people who are very meticulous.

51:10.625 --> 51:15.041
Now, supposing I say, “I know that the plane won’t leave Me.”

51:15.291 --> 51:19.125
I know, because I know many things so I have no problems,

51:19.333 --> 51:24.291
but supposing even if you think the plane you may not get,

51:24.917 --> 51:28.542
so it may not get.  But if it gets you, all right.

51:28.750 --> 51:32.625
If it doesn’t get you, it’s all right. So where is the problem?

51:32.834 --> 51:37.999
Either it will take you or it will not take you. What is in between?

51:38.625 --> 51:41.750
Where is the problem, I still don’t understand.

51:42.250 --> 51:44.917
Either it will work out or it will not work out.

51:45.083 --> 51:48.709
Keep two possibilities. That’s the only two possibilities.

51:48.917 --> 51:53.417
What is the third possibility that gives you the problem? You tell Me.

51:53.667 --> 51:56.417
Say somebody owes Me money, all right,

51:56.709 --> 52:00.500
so either he will give Me or he may not give Me.

52:00.750 --> 52:06.041
What is the problem?  The problem is that you call it a problem

52:06.250 --> 52:11.583
and want to avoid to face the truth.

52:12.291 --> 52:14.999
If you face the truth, you will know one thing

52:15.166 --> 52:18.333
that see now this man has to give me money. All right,

52:18.542 --> 52:19.999
I’ll go and face it.

52:20.166 --> 52:23.125
I’ll tell him, “Sir, you have to give me the money.

52:23.333 --> 52:28.583
You have to pay me. This is your duty

52:28.792 --> 52:31.500
and if you don’t pay me, you are doing wrong.”

52:31.750 --> 52:35.000
You get at him and face him and tell him.

52:35.208 --> 52:38.500
But you won’t do that. You’ll sit at home, “Oh God, it’s a problem.

52:38.709 --> 52:40.999
I have to, you see, that man is not giving money.

52:41.166 --> 52:43.041
Oh God. That’s a problem.”

52:43.250 --> 52:48.250
Sitting here, hitting your head all the time, how will you get it?

52:50.041 --> 52:55.250
If you face it directly then you’ll be amazed,

52:55.458 --> 52:58.875
there’s no problem for anything.

53:00.625 --> 53:03.625
Say your car fails. So it fails,

53:03.834 --> 53:07.917
get down, enjoy your self nicely till somebody comes along, takes you.

53:08.083 --> 53:11.917
Or, if supposing you don’t get some lift, all right,

53:12.083 --> 53:15.792
stay there overnight. What is it? No tiger is going to eat you.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.250
And if the tiger has to eat you, it will eat.

53:24.125 --> 53:28.000
Where is the problem?  Still I can’t see.

53:30.417 --> 53:33.834
I can’t see the problem.  If tiger has to eat,

53:34.000 --> 53:37.166
that’s already destined that the tiger has to eat.

53:37.375 --> 53:41.875
In any case, nobody dies. You’ll be born again.

53:43.999 --> 53:47.625
If you look at it from that angle

53:47.834 --> 53:51.333
then you’ll be surprised, most of the problems do not exist.

53:51.542 --> 53:55.625
They are like bubbles created by our own thinking,

53:55.834 --> 54:00.750
the waves of our thinking, “This is the problem. That is the problem.”

54:00.959 --> 54:03.709
Like today, they said there is no hall on such and such date.

54:03.917 --> 54:06.250
All right. “Where are you having the hall? ” “There.”

54:06.458 --> 54:09.709
“If there’s no hall, let us have it in the open.”

54:11.999 --> 54:19.125
So to make the best of it is, is the way Shri Rama shows you.

54:19.625 --> 54:23.750
Now, what is the way He has helped us, let us see.

54:24.500 --> 54:29.500
Shri Rama by His character, by His balance, His peace

54:29.709 --> 54:34.166
and His mildness and His sweetness has shown us

54:34.375 --> 54:36.583
how a king should be a benevolent king

54:36.792 --> 54:39.999
and at the same time a very loving husband

54:40.166 --> 54:43.208
and a loving father and a person in dharma,

54:43.417 --> 54:48.999
but apart from that, He went down to Maharashtra.

54:49.625 --> 54:51.250
He arranged all these things

54:51.458 --> 54:56.458
so that He could walk down to Maharashtra bare feet to vibrate the land

54:56.667 --> 55:00.000
because Sahaja Yogis will be going one day to Maharashtra

55:00.208 --> 55:03.458
and the Maharashtra has to be a vibrated land.

55:03.750 --> 55:09.208
In Ayodhya, He never took out His shoes because He was the king there.

55:09.417 --> 55:12.458
But when He went, and Shri Sita, both of them,

55:12.667 --> 55:16.709
when they went to Maharashtra They took out their shoes to vibrate it.

55:16.917 --> 55:20.875
On His way, He saw a big stone

55:21.041 --> 55:25.959
which was nothing but a lady cursed to be a stone, Ahilya.

55:26.125 --> 55:30.750
And He made her, just by touch, she again came back to life.

55:31.125 --> 55:36.417
Like that, one after another He was just, by the way, as if was doing,

55:36.625 --> 55:40.583
but that was the purpose of His life to go there.

55:42.667 --> 55:48.709
And that has helped a very great achievement within ourselves,

55:48.959 --> 55:51.125
is the Shri Ram.

55:51.333 --> 55:54.208
Shri Rama stands for the pranavai,

55:54.417 --> 55:59.959
is for the vital air that we take in.

56:00.125 --> 56:05.125
For the vital air, and that vital air when it gets heated up,

56:05.333 --> 56:09.834
we have to know that we are not any more with Shri Ram.

56:09.999 --> 56:14.083
It has to be the cool air to blow through your nose  and your mouth.

56:14.291 --> 56:18.333
I don’t know about you people, it happens with Me all the time.

56:19.792 --> 56:23.083
When you are angry the nostrils go up, swell up,

56:23.291 --> 56:27.375
and the hot air, the hot words, and everything hot,

56:27.583 --> 56:31.041
the heated eyes, and everything goes up like that, curled up,

56:31.250 --> 56:34.333
and you become ferocious Ravana.

56:34.542 --> 56:40.875
Because you have forgotten the beauty of the nature of Shri Rama.

56:42.542 --> 56:46.375
What has He done to our center heart is the greatest thing,

56:46.583 --> 56:51.542
that He has given you a fatherhood within us.

56:51.792 --> 56:55.208
Because Shri Rama represents the fatherhood.

56:55.458 --> 56:58.583
Now what sort of a father you are, you have to decide.

56:58.792 --> 57:01.583
Those people who are not good fathers

57:01.792 --> 57:03.875
develop problems of the right heart.

57:04.041 --> 57:08.875
Also those people who are not good husbands

57:09.041 --> 57:12.375
also develop the right heart.

57:13.583 --> 57:16.291
This right heart is so important,

57:16.542 --> 57:21.500
because  specially in the west where the climate is so funny,

57:21.709 --> 57:24.999
you have to keep inside your rooms and closed all the time

57:25.166 --> 57:27.625
that you get all dried up inside

57:27.834 --> 57:32.709
at that time if you don’t have that sweetness, that warmth,

57:32.917 --> 57:37.083
that kindness of Shri Rama, you get the trouble of asthma.

57:37.291 --> 57:41.166
So many people die of asthma in the west.

57:41.417 --> 57:44.166
On top of that, you fight with your wives, ill-treat them,

57:44.417 --> 57:48.959
you take away their money, you cheat them in their money

57:49.125 --> 57:53.291
and every way you torture them then it becomes even worse.

57:54.250 --> 57:57.500
So it has something to do with money, in the sense,

57:57.709 --> 58:04.333
because Sitaji was Shri Lakshmi and Sitaji was the one

58:04.625 --> 58:08.417
who, who was the power of Shri Rama.

58:08.625 --> 58:12.375
So the Shri Lakshmi also gets annoyed with you

58:12.583 --> 58:15.709
when you are a bad father or a bad husband.

58:15.917 --> 58:18.792
That’s why the Gruha Lakshmi is very important.

58:18.999 --> 58:22.917
But the woman has to be the Gruha Lakshmi. She should not be a shrew

58:23.083 --> 58:25.625
and then the husband is supposed to be kind to her.

58:25.834 --> 58:28.041
Then it's spoiling. That's very bad.

58:28.250 --> 58:30.208
The woman has to be a Gruha Lakshmi,

58:30.417 --> 58:33.625
a beautiful woman with a very sweet nature

58:33.834 --> 58:38.041
and talking to her husband in a very sankoch manner

58:38.250 --> 58:43.458
and also looking after the children, looking after the family

58:43.667 --> 58:47.041
and looking after the guests who come to their house.

58:47.250 --> 58:52.166
But if you encourage and run after such women who are no good,

58:52.375 --> 58:55.458
means collectively they should be good;

58:55.667 --> 58:58.000
if collectively they do not act well,

58:58.208 --> 59:00.041
collectively if they are aggressive,

59:00.250 --> 59:02.999
collectively if they are tormenting others,

59:03.166 --> 59:06.125
then such women should not be encouraged at all,

59:06.333 --> 59:10.999
but then, Tulsidas says, they should be beaten up.

59:11.750 --> 59:16.750
Is a thing looks very bad in modern times if somebody says like that,

59:16.959 --> 59:22.500
that women should be beaten up in case they have all such qualities

59:22.709 --> 59:26.083
which disqualify them from being Gruha Lakshmis.

59:26.375 --> 59:31.250
Of course there’s no need to beat, but I mean to say that what is it

59:31.458 --> 59:35.250
that you have to drive out all these baddhas from your women,

59:35.458 --> 59:42.291
very important, otherwise if you fall in this activity

59:42.500 --> 59:45.709
of keeping your wives on right lines,

59:45.917 --> 59:50.417
you might also get a right heart and asthma ultimately.

59:51.041 --> 59:54.875
Because your wife and you are part of the society.

59:55.041 --> 59:59.250
And the society has certain laws which are very important.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.458
There’s something like shri dharma, there’s something like pati dharma,

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:06.291
there’s something like mata dharma,

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.999
pita dharma, everything has a dharma.

01:00:09.166 --> 01:00:12.500
Those men who torture their wives have very bad heart.

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:15.834
In the same way, those who play into the hands of their wives

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
also have a very bad right heart.

01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:24.834
You have to be in the balance. You are the husband and she is your wife

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.709
and both are responsible for keeping a very good family relationship.

01:00:30.917 --> 01:00:33.999
It’s not one-sided. It’s not the husband only or the wife

01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:37.999
but both of them to be in such a manner

01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:42.250
that they act according to their nature of woman and man,

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:44.917
and respect each other, love each other,

01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:48.917
share everything with each other and exist in a way

01:00:49.083 --> 01:00:52.542
that people should see that there are two wheels of a chariot,

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:55.917
one on the left, one on the right, there’s no imbalance.

01:00:56.083 --> 01:01:00.375
They are equal but not similar as I have told many a time.

01:01:00.667 --> 01:01:03.834
Now in the case of Shri Rama, He left His wife.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.834
When it came to Sita, She left Him too.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
But She left Him as a woman would leave

01:01:11.208 --> 01:01:14.583
and He left Her as a man would leave.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.083
She also left Him.

01:01:20.917 --> 01:01:25.583
But in a way that is suitable for a woman to do.

01:01:26.041 --> 01:01:30.917
And He did it in a way that is suitable to a king.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:36.041
In the same way, a woman when she acts, she has to act like a woman.

01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:39.083
The same thing she may do as the man does,

01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:44.166
but she has to be a woman or a man has to be a man.

01:01:44.583 --> 01:01:46.917
So that’s the Mariada Purushottama,

01:01:47.125 --> 01:01:50.500
is the one who is the highest among all the men,

01:01:50.709 --> 01:01:55.917
which is all the Mariadas, all the boundaries that he observes.

01:01:56.166 --> 01:02:00.208
The boundaries are such that you do not try to overpower others

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:05.999
or you do not try to take their seats.

01:02:06.417 --> 01:02:09.834
For example, I’ve seen those who are aggressive

01:02:10.083 --> 01:02:15.667
also show up in our programs, they will be the first before Me.

01:02:15.875 --> 01:02:18.417
They will be, as soon as I open the gates,

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:21.500
they’ll be somewhere there standing.

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:25.125
They, they will be the first in everything.

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:29.041
That’s not being Mariada. You should be at the back.

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:32.875
Should be…, there are leaders you have got, they can sit in front.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:35.291
Try to be on the back. “I want to be first..."

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:39.208
Then I’ve said once “the first of the first.”

01:02:39.875 --> 01:02:42.041
You know the story of first of the first.

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:45.750
So you become first of the first and that’s what happens to you

01:02:45.959 --> 01:02:48.583
when you try to show off.

01:02:48.792 --> 01:02:52.999
And I know all of them who are like that.

01:02:54.166 --> 01:02:57.999
To be in the background

01:02:58.709 --> 01:03:02.792
is the most respectable thing to do.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:07.500
To go forward first, to jump forward first,

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:10.375
to stand near the door if Mother is coming, you see.

01:03:10.583 --> 01:03:14.125
As soon as I see the person, I said, “Oh back again.”

01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:18.000
There’s some who do Aartis just because to show off,

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:21.291
some throw flowers to show off, they must be the first.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.583
And, somehow or another, they get also the position

01:03:24.792 --> 01:03:28.208
because of their assertions and askings.

01:03:28.458 --> 01:03:30.208
The leaders have to be careful

01:03:30.417 --> 01:03:34.083
and not to give such eyed duties to people

01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:39.625
who really upset Me very much because of their arrogance,

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:45.166
because of their showing offs.

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:49.375
I have to say one thing today that, under the circumstances,

01:03:49.667 --> 01:03:54.083
we have to decide that if the leaders don’t have wives

01:03:54.291 --> 01:03:58.999
who are humble, who are kind, who are compassionate

01:03:59.291 --> 01:04:03.917
and who are Gruha Lakshmis, who are very sweet with the Collective,

01:04:04.083 --> 01:04:10.583
we’ll have to cancel the husband as well as the wife from the leadership.

01:04:11.667 --> 01:04:15.583
We cannot have leaders who have wives who are horrid.

01:04:15.792 --> 01:04:22.709
We cannot, because the wife of a leader is like a mother.

01:04:23.667 --> 01:04:30.583
There are five types of mothers described, one of them is the one

01:04:30.792 --> 01:04:33.959
who is the wife of the guru or of the leader.

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:36.875
And if the leader has a wife of that kind

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:40.917
it’s better in all sense he should withdraw.

01:04:41.208 --> 01:04:43.667
Improve his wife. Do whatever is possible.

01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:46.959
Till she’s all right, he should not be the leader.

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:50.125
Is a very important thing because I have seen

01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:53.583
such women bring down the men, not only that,

01:04:53.792 --> 01:04:56.125
but bring down the Sahaja Yoga,

01:04:56.333 --> 01:05:00.750
Sahaja Yogis and the whole organization of God.

01:05:01.417 --> 01:05:05.792
So one has to be careful  and the women have to understand

01:05:05.999 --> 01:05:09.041
that if they are the wives of the leaders

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:12.917
they have to be extremely good, kind,

01:05:14.625 --> 01:05:18.542
generous, sharing, looking after,

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:24.083
absolutely motherly, and should not tolerate nonsense

01:05:24.291 --> 01:05:28.291
and should correct when people are doing wrong.

01:05:28.542 --> 01:05:31.583
They should not report anyone to their husbands,

01:05:31.792 --> 01:05:35.875
should not take over themselves the responsibility of doing things

01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:38.667
which they are not supposed to do.

01:05:38.959 --> 01:05:43.999
If they are not of that level, they are of no use to people

01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:51.250
and they have no business to be proud of being the wives of the leaders.

01:05:53.041 --> 01:05:59.125
From Shri Rama’s life we learn a lot and from Sitaji’s life also.

01:05:59.333 --> 01:06:06.041
Both of them have done so much for us, bring forth such a great life.

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:09.917
All their lives they suffered and suffered and suffered.

01:06:10.083 --> 01:06:13.500
They lived in the villages. They lived in the forest.

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:16.667
While they were the king and the queen they had never known

01:06:16.875 --> 01:06:21.500
what is discomfort. They traveled all the way bare feet.

01:06:21.709 --> 01:06:24.959
They went through all kinds of tortures of life.

01:06:25.125 --> 01:06:29.959
Sita was taken away by Ravana, who was a horrid man.

01:06:30.125 --> 01:06:32.542
She had to live with a rakshasa, can you imagine?

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:37.291
She lived with a rakshasa and there She showed her greatness.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:44.750
The characters of different nature, like Sita and Shri Rama,

01:06:45.125 --> 01:06:51.792
they were showing the complementary attributes

01:06:51.999 --> 01:06:55.125
that there are, very complementary, and if that is so

01:06:55.333 --> 01:06:59.834
then the husband wife’s relations beautiful are in Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:59.999 --> 01:07:04.834
That’s the way it should be. I find some people are very nice.

01:07:04.999 --> 01:07:09.542
Some leaders are extremely nice, but wives can be very hard,

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:14.999
can be very stiff,

01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:22.750
or could be very mischievous, could be troublesome, selfish.

01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:27.709
You cannot grow in Sahaja Yoga with these qualities.

01:07:27.999 --> 01:07:32.375
It's such a luck and chance that your husband is the leader,

01:07:32.583 --> 01:07:37.709
is the highest man in your nation in Sahaja Yoga

01:07:37.917 --> 01:07:43.500
and where you have to be up to his ability,

01:07:43.709 --> 01:07:49.125
capability and his name, otherwise you have no authority.

01:07:49.542 --> 01:07:53.375
That’s why I have to tell you that on this day of Dassera,

01:07:53.625 --> 01:08:00.375
let us decide that we are going to have Ramraj in Sahaja Yoga,

01:08:00.625 --> 01:08:05.291
where there is benevolence, there is love, compassion,

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:10.959
security, peace, joy, discipline among ourselves.

01:08:11.125 --> 01:08:13.375
The whole disciplining is within ourselves.

01:08:13.583 --> 01:08:16.125
What I say about Shri Rama is that

01:08:16.333 --> 01:08:21.000
He Himself has put Himself into the discipline of Mariadas.

01:08:21.208 --> 01:08:24.500
In the same way, we ourselves should put ourselves

01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:28.166
into the discipline of Mariadas.

01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:32.709
Is a very great thing that it should happen in Switzerland

01:08:32.917 --> 01:08:37.125
because Switzerland needs it the most,

01:08:37.959 --> 01:08:40.999
the blessings of Shri Ram.

01:08:42.208 --> 01:08:45.999
The way it is going on in this country,

01:08:46.375 --> 01:08:53.500
this very selfish, non-benevolent activities going on,

01:08:53.792 --> 01:09:00.291
ruining all the poorer nations by this kind of a selfish attitude,

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:04.417
a very narrow attitude, very low level attitude

01:09:04.625 --> 01:09:10.667
towards the money of these poorer nations.

01:09:11.542 --> 01:09:15.875
Is important, very important for us today

01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:20.083
to pray for the emancipation of the hearts of those people

01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:22.959
who are just butchering.

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:25.959
In these modern times, we don’t have wars

01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:29.125
but financially they are butchering people,

01:09:29.333 --> 01:09:34.291
they are killing them by depriving them of their own money

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.542
and their own benevolence.

01:09:38.959 --> 01:09:41.500
So, if Ramraja has to come,

01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:45.667
then Rama is to be born in the hearts of people

01:09:45.917 --> 01:09:48.959
who are at the helm of affairs. And that’s how

01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:53.667
we have to pray to Shri Ram  that, “Be kind and compassionate

01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:58.208
so that you could be born into the hearts of these people.”

01:09:59.999 --> 01:10:03.959
May God bless you all.

01:10:09.125 --> 01:10:12.083
May I have some water please.

01:10:14.583 --> 01:10:18.000
I do not know, how I spoke today, because the vibrations are so much,

01:10:18.208 --> 01:10:19.959
it's very difficult.

01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:22.500
Can I have some water please. Thank you
