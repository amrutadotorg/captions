00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:17.825
Yogini: Mother, in the spiritual seeking, can you get too right sided,

00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:25.544
wanting to go faster and faster?

00:00:25.786 --> 00:00:31.672
Shri Mataji: In the spiritual seeking? In the spiritual seeking there is,

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:35.102
a speed is not felt at all you see.

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:40.766
In that you just feel the state. Your state you feel.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:47.141
You don’t feel the speed. You don’t feel that you must do [something].

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:50.044
Like, I have seen some people, even when I am giving lecture

00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:52.626
they are doing like this or they are doing like that.

00:00:52.826 --> 00:00:57.508
This madness is not necessary. Just be quiet.

00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:01.251
Quietitude (sic) is the best way to ascend.

00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:05.141
I have said that there should be thoughtless awareness.

00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:08.693
Just do it quietly. Your speed will reduce actually;

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:15.367
will come to a position when it is maximum for your quietitude.

00:01:15.568 --> 00:01:20.810
Quietness within, the peace within, that’s very important.

00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:24.282
If there is peace you will grow. There’s no other way out.

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:26.266
But you see, all this ritualism,

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:30.896
sometimes giving bandhan all the time or raising Kundalini all the time

00:01:31.097 --> 00:01:36.169
and people even would like to see the table if it has vibrations!

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:41.583
That’s going too far. There’s no need to do all that nonsense.

00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:46.328
Sahaja Yoga is sense, it’s not nonsense.
