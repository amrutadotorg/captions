WEBVTT

00:03.388 --> 00:09.418
Today we have gathered here to worship the Adi Kundalini

00:09.455 --> 00:12.163
and your own Kundalini, both of them,

00:13.093 --> 00:16.093
because your Kundalini is the reflection

00:16.133 --> 00:18.053
of the Adi Kundalini.

00:21.053 --> 00:22.993
We have understood a lot

00:24.183 --> 00:26.153
about Kundalini

00:27.193 --> 00:31.993
and also we know that

00:32.053 --> 00:34.183
through Her awakening only,

00:34.628 --> 00:36.163
through Her ascent only,

00:36.670 --> 00:43.053
we have ascended into a very higher realm of consciousness.

00:43.773 --> 00:49.153
It's not only that we have risen to a very higher realm

00:49.193 --> 00:52.213
of awareness

00:52.861 --> 00:59.013
but that it has granted us so many powers that,

00:59.983 --> 01:05.163
never before in the history of spirituality

01:07.073 --> 01:09.023
people had

01:09.123 --> 01:13.213
this power of awakening of Kundalini.

01:15.213 --> 01:18.938
As soon as they got their awakening perhaps,

01:18.963 --> 01:22.053
they went more on to the left or to the right,

01:22.877 --> 01:26.193
and tried to achieve powers

01:27.193 --> 01:34.083
which were not so much for the benevolence of others.

01:36.143 --> 01:39.033
Buddha has written clearly

01:39.143 --> 01:42.193
that, “When the incarnation of future Buddha,

01:42.223 --> 01:47.033
that is Maitreya, three Mothers put together, comes in,

01:47.163 --> 01:54.023
that time it will be used for the benevolence of people.”

01:54.053 --> 01:56.083
This is one of the signs,

01:57.093 --> 01:59.083
"of the people",

01:59.143 --> 02:04.083
not only of Sahaja Yogis but of the people.

02:05.033 --> 02:12.133
So how can it be unless and until those who are Buddhas,

02:12.173 --> 02:14.203
means those who are Realized souls

02:15.163 --> 02:20.203
know the science of Kundalini?

02:22.223 --> 02:27.063
Those people who had very little knowledge about Kundalini,

02:27.223 --> 02:30.113
who must have read in some scriptures

02:30.173 --> 02:34.003
or somewhere which is being described,

02:37.113 --> 02:39.983
started misusing it

02:40.023 --> 02:42.173
and so they became tantrikas.

02:43.837 --> 02:47.023
But tantra, as you know very well,

02:47.483 --> 02:53.093
is the mechanism of Kundalini,

02:53.818 --> 02:59.053
and the yantra is the Kundalini itself,

03:00.133 --> 03:03.083
is the machine.

03:07.133 --> 03:09.133
Today I think,

03:09.173 --> 03:12.023
as we know so much about Kundalini,

03:12.113 --> 03:14.993
how it passes through different centers,

03:15.063 --> 03:19.113
how it rises, all those things as we know,

03:19.163 --> 03:25.003
we should find out how we can nourish our Kundalini.

03:25.063 --> 03:27.173
That's very important to know.

03:32.083 --> 03:38.113
First of all there's a big difference between

03:38.143 --> 03:43.143
you people and other people who got their Realization.

03:44.223 --> 03:48.223
First big difference is this,

03:49.063 --> 03:56.083
that this power you have achieved Sahaj, easily.

03:57.063 --> 04:00.173
Others had to go to Himalayas,

04:01.033 --> 04:05.193
stand in the cold air for days together, so many died,

04:05.678 --> 04:08.033
live in the caves,

04:08.133 --> 04:11.033
eating fruits,

04:11.143 --> 04:13.163
sometimes nothing.

04:15.920 --> 04:21.043
Even Buddha's time they had to use only one piece of cloth

04:21.073 --> 04:23.073
to cover their body

04:23.183 --> 04:29.043
and they had to ask for alms

04:31.203 --> 04:39.013
in the villages and somehow cook some food and eat it

04:39.093 --> 04:43.203
- whether it was cold or hot, no comforts.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.983
On the contrary,

04:46.073 --> 04:52.183
He taught them that you should give up all our comforts

04:54.183 --> 04:57.153
because you can live without comforts.

04:58.213 --> 05:03.183
But none of them got Realization

05:04.133 --> 05:07.093
and none of them could do the work

05:07.123 --> 05:10.023
of awakening of Kundalini.

05:15.013 --> 05:21.043
So the difference is too much,

05:21.123 --> 05:24.053
the way you got your Realization,

05:24.123 --> 05:29.993
the way your Kundalini, in a very Sahaj manner, was awakened

05:30.213 --> 05:34.153
and the way you are manifesting those powers

05:34.183 --> 05:36.133
that you have got.

05:36.213 --> 05:39.183
For example you can give Realization to others,

05:40.043 --> 05:42.013
you can cure others,

05:42.093 --> 05:45.023
you can feel the vibrations of others,

05:45.123 --> 05:46.983
there are some Sahaja Yogis

05:47.033 --> 05:51.063
who can control rain, sun, moon, everything.

05:52.013 --> 05:54.103
Sahaja Yogis, some of them,

05:54.153 --> 05:56.983
have tremendous powers of prayers.

05:57.063 --> 06:01.003
Just by praying they have saved the lives of many people.

06:04.103 --> 06:13.043
And these powers were available to some of them,

06:13.123 --> 06:20.213
even to the rishis and great munis on those days,

06:21.983 --> 06:28.983
but their powers were not based on love and compassion.

06:29.033 --> 06:31.113
This is your special field

06:31.143 --> 06:39.013
because you have to work for the benevolence of the people.

06:40.043 --> 06:43.093
Their field was to protect themselves

06:43.983 --> 06:47.043
or to destroy.

06:48.003 --> 06:53.003
So they developed powers of curses,

06:53.103 --> 06:55.123
like sharp,

06:55.213 --> 06:58.013
they could curse people.

06:58.123 --> 07:00.983
You haven't got that power;

07:01.093 --> 07:03.203
you cannot curse anyone.

07:04.213 --> 07:09.003
Very nicely that power I have cancelled.

07:13.003 --> 07:18.033
Nor do I curse, I can, but I never curse anyone,

07:18.143 --> 07:27.213
because our basis is love and compassion and tenderliness.

07:29.123 --> 07:32.113
They were very hot-tempered people, most of them,

07:32.143 --> 07:34.043
extremely hot temper,

07:35.023 --> 07:39.983
and sometimes they used also terrible harsh languages

07:40.013 --> 07:43.213
whenever they spoke about the people

07:43.993 --> 07:46.103
who were not realized or who were troubling them.

07:46.123 --> 07:48.173
This was very funny

07:49.073 --> 07:52.103
the way they were angry with the society,

07:54.983 --> 07:57.213
the way they described them.

07:59.133 --> 08:04.063
Some of them did not look at the society,

08:04.093 --> 08:06.043
did not denounce the society,

08:06.073 --> 08:09.093
did not say bad things about the society

08:10.023 --> 08:14.173
but they were only satisfied with themselves

08:15.023 --> 08:20.093
or they wrote about the blessings that they are having.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.203
But you have a new dimension;

08:24.063 --> 08:28.183
you have to use your powers

08:30.073 --> 08:33.163
for the benevolence of the people.

08:34.983 --> 08:42.063
So also, your Kundalini was awakened so Sahaj;

08:45.073 --> 08:49.203
it is because of the love and compassion of your Mother.

08:51.983 --> 08:54.073
So this time, we should say,

08:54.123 --> 08:57.103
your Kundalini can only be nourished

08:57.213 --> 09:02.043
if you develop within yourself

09:04.043 --> 09:10.123
the sense of pure love and pure compassion.

09:12.103 --> 09:16.123
First I've used the word “pure”, that's My name also.

09:17.983 --> 09:22.073
That means you have to be innocent to begin with.

09:22.203 --> 09:30.073
If you are not innocent then you have certain problems,

09:30.103 --> 09:32.993
maybe with your lust.

09:34.223 --> 09:38.043
Maybe your love might be directed

09:38.073 --> 09:42.073
towards some person, only.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.133
Kundalini is not like that.

09:45.193 --> 09:49.133
She rises, She goes to all the chakras,

09:49.183 --> 09:51.103
She doesn't get involved into any,

09:51.133 --> 09:54.183
She tries to cure every chakra, nourish that chakra,

09:54.993 --> 09:58.123
and She is only worried about Her ascent.

09:59.163 --> 10:02.993
In the same way a Sahaja Yogi

10:03.153 --> 10:06.083
should not get involved

10:06.983 --> 10:10.993
into any relationship as such.

10:11.993 --> 10:14.043
Is possible.

10:14.083 --> 10:18.043
You don't have to become like Buddha's disciples.

10:18.163 --> 10:21.083
For example, as I have always told you,

10:21.123 --> 10:22.193
the sap in the tree rises

10:22.993 --> 10:25.193
and goes to various parts of the tree

10:25.223 --> 10:29.013
and then evaporates or comes back.

10:30.153 --> 10:34.053
So this passage should be kept open,

10:36.133 --> 10:39.133
and once this passage is kept open

10:40.023 --> 10:46.073
the Kundalini can rise very easily without any trouble.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.213
But this passage can be closed,

10:51.053 --> 10:55.023
in case you get too much involved into one thing,

10:55.123 --> 11:00.083
because there are some people

11:03.993 --> 11:07.983
who get involved, say in their parents to begin with.

11:08.013 --> 11:10.073
All right, in the beginning I know,

11:10.123 --> 11:12.103
those who come in the beginning to Sahaja Yoga,

11:12.133 --> 11:16.083
will start saying, “Mother, my father's, sister's,

11:17.013 --> 11:21.073
husband's, this things, that, is sick,

11:21.183 --> 11:24.993
so will you please cure that person.” Very common.

11:25.123 --> 11:27.023
They'll write long, long letters

11:27.073 --> 11:28.123
describing the relationship

11:28.153 --> 11:33.993
and I really lose the connection - who is this one?

11:34.043 --> 11:35.133
Without writing the names

11:35.163 --> 11:37.993
they will give all the connections that they have.

11:38.043 --> 11:40.183
These are all artificial connections.

11:42.053 --> 11:45.023
Tomorrow some calamity comes on you,

11:45.183 --> 11:49.053
these relationships are of no use;

11:49.083 --> 11:52.123
on the contrary you'll find they'll take advantage of it.

11:53.183 --> 11:56.153
You cannot depend on these relations of yours,

11:56.223 --> 11:58.153
in what family you were born,

11:58.183 --> 12:00.053
in what religion you were born,

12:00.083 --> 12:02.153
in what country you are born,

12:03.183 --> 12:06.153
because now you are a universal being.

12:07.153 --> 12:11.193
So you are no more related

12:12.163 --> 12:15.053
through these artificial relationships

12:15.133 --> 12:20.183
but you are related through your spiritual relationships.

12:22.073 --> 12:26.983
Unless and until we establish that within ourselves

12:27.163 --> 12:29.163
- that doesn't mean you give up your husband,

12:29.983 --> 12:31.183
give up your wife, give up your children,

12:31.203 --> 12:33.213
nothing of the kind;

12:34.153 --> 12:38.983
but that means that if we have to give up our conditionings

12:39.123 --> 12:42.153
we have to give up all these things.

12:45.163 --> 12:48.053
There are all kinds of conditionings we have.

12:49.213 --> 12:52.133
If there are some good conditionings,

12:54.043 --> 12:55.133
still we should give up

12:55.163 --> 12:58.133
in the sense they should not be conditionings

12:58.193 --> 13:00.213
but we should be master of them.

13:01.013 --> 13:04.043
For example Indians have one good conditioning, in a way,

13:04.093 --> 13:05.133
in their own country,

13:05.163 --> 13:08.103
that they must have their bath early in the morning.

13:09.123 --> 13:11.103
I used to do the same.

13:11.163 --> 13:14.103
Then England is horrible for that.

13:15.053 --> 13:18.103
It takes its respite, if you do that in England,

13:18.183 --> 13:20.153
it's a cursed country,

13:20.983 --> 13:22.183
you just can't do that.

13:22.983 --> 13:24.123
You have to take your bath in the night

13:24.153 --> 13:26.183
otherwise give up bathing;

13:28.013 --> 13:29.103
and one has to change.

13:29.113 --> 13:31.033
But if you have that conditioning,

13:31.093 --> 13:33.093
then you will feel very sad,

13:33.123 --> 13:35.143
“Oh, oh, I've missed my bath, I'm feeling,

13:35.193 --> 13:40.053
I can't sleep now, I can't feel all right, I am not normal.”

13:40.113 --> 13:44.093
It’s a good conditioning but still it is enslaving you.

13:45.113 --> 13:47.173
So whether it is good or bad,

13:47.223 --> 13:49.173
if it is a conditioning

13:50.093 --> 13:54.113
you should try to see it clearly, it's a conditioning.

13:57.093 --> 13:58.983
That doesn't mean that you should go

13:59.013 --> 14:00.053
in the opposite direction,

14:00.093 --> 14:01.993
that, "All right I'll never have my bath",

14:02.023 --> 14:03.983
that's not the way.

14:07.103 --> 14:08.993
It is that,

14:09.073 --> 14:11.993
"All right if it doesn't suit in the morning

14:12.043 --> 14:13.093
I'll have it in the evening,

14:13.133 --> 14:15.153
also doesn't matter once in a while I'll miss it.

14:15.183 --> 14:19.103
The bath cannot control me, I'll control the bath."

14:21.043 --> 14:22.517
Nothing should control you,

14:22.542 --> 14:25.093
then the Kundalini moves for us,

14:25.153 --> 14:28.103
because you must have complete liberty.

14:29.053 --> 14:31.133
If you do not have complete liberty

14:31.213 --> 14:33.993
then the Kundalini won't move.

14:38.956 --> 14:41.380
We have conditionings of our families,

14:41.501 --> 14:44.993
of our religion,

14:45.686 --> 14:47.716
of our country.

14:48.916 --> 14:52.836
These conditionings, as far as possible,

14:52.906 --> 14:57.806
is to be seen clearly that we have got it through our

15:00.686 --> 15:01.756
family.

15:01.806 --> 15:03.856
If you are born a Christian

15:04.746 --> 15:07.696
you'll always be more attached to Christ.

15:08.696 --> 15:09.806
Christ you have not seen,

15:09.836 --> 15:11.836
you don't know whether He existed or not,

15:11.896 --> 15:13.826
whether this Bible is true or not

15:13.866 --> 15:15.866
but you'll be more attached to Bible.

15:16.726 --> 15:18.449
Now if you are a Hindu,

15:18.568 --> 15:22.726
you'll be more attached to Gita or to Vedas or something.

15:22.906 --> 15:26.696
This creates imbalance,

15:27.796 --> 15:31.686
because we must have the same attitude

15:31.746 --> 15:34.866
towards all the religions, towards all the scriptures;

15:34.896 --> 15:37.826
that's the sign of a saint.

15:41.756 --> 15:44.756
So this conditioning has to go.

15:45.716 --> 15:49.826
In what country you are born is another conditioning

15:49.866 --> 15:51.836
which has to be fought out;

15:52.686 --> 15:54.716
very important it is.

15:55.886 --> 15:58.686
I don't want to discuss the conditionings

15:58.726 --> 16:01.726
of different countries but you know very well.

16:01.776 --> 16:04.716
After Realization when you rise higher

16:04.756 --> 16:06.886
than your society which is surrounding you,

16:07.726 --> 16:11.756
you start understanding and you start describing.

16:11.836 --> 16:14.600
I've come to know about the stupidity

16:14.806 --> 16:16.836
of all these countries through the people

16:16.866 --> 16:18.836
who belong to that country.

16:18.886 --> 16:20.836
For example a Frenchman will say,

16:20.866 --> 16:24.826
“Mother, this is typical French mind,

16:25.598 --> 16:27.726
he's a French otherwise born.”

16:27.836 --> 16:29.686
Or a Hindu will say,

16:29.746 --> 16:32.686
“Mother, this is typically a Hindu man,

16:32.716 --> 16:33.886
he will do like this.”

16:34.796 --> 16:37.856
So then you understand that you are not typifying

16:37.906 --> 16:39.756
that country,

16:39.826 --> 16:41.716
you are a universal being

16:41.776 --> 16:44.686
and you are living like a universal being.

16:47.776 --> 16:49.896
Once you become the universal being

16:50.726 --> 16:54.886
then also you realize that this skin-deep complexion

16:54.916 --> 16:57.686
makes no difference in the world.

16:58.886 --> 17:02.746
So then you don't start hating somebody

17:02.796 --> 17:06.776
who is darker than you or who is fairer than you;

17:06.806 --> 17:08.716
both ways it works.

17:08.796 --> 17:14.578
It's not only the people who are fair hate the darker ones,

17:14.603 --> 17:16.856
but “darkers” also hate equally.

17:17.826 --> 17:21.456
And mutually they believe that they are all

17:21.756 --> 17:23.796
absolutely wrong.

17:24.726 --> 17:27.806
If you ask a fanatic

17:29.746 --> 17:32.686
about another religion he'll say,

17:32.726 --> 17:34.866
that's the worst religion, his is the best.

17:35.696 --> 17:38.716
And you ask the another fanatic,

17:38.796 --> 17:43.746
he will say his is the best, the rest of it is the worst.

17:43.776 --> 17:45.856
That means all of them are the worst,

17:45.916 --> 17:47.796
in a general opinion.

17:47.806 --> 17:49.696
Everybody seems to be the worst,

17:49.726 --> 17:50.866
all the fanatics are the worst,

17:51.696 --> 17:53.886
if you take a general consensus, you see.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.691
Nobody will say that,

17:56.716 --> 17:57.836
"All right, my religion is all right

17:57.886 --> 18:00.906
and at least one another is all right", nobody.

18:03.746 --> 18:05.726
If you ask an Englishman he'll say,

18:05.746 --> 18:09.756
“Mother, this is typically English, you can't help it.”

18:10.796 --> 18:13.806
They get so angry, I've seen the English getting angry

18:13.836 --> 18:15.756
with the other English for misbehaving

18:15.796 --> 18:18.796
or doing something towards Me, but I don't,

18:18.826 --> 18:20.866
because they are blind.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.811
So here the compassion should come within you,

18:24.836 --> 18:26.490
as a universal being,

18:26.515 --> 18:29.866
that by God's grace you have risen higher

18:29.886 --> 18:31.796
in the real sense of the word.

18:31.826 --> 18:33.756
It is not just you are certified,

18:33.806 --> 18:35.716
you are realized souls, no.

18:35.806 --> 18:41.886
You are realized souls, no doubt, you are - sakshat.

18:42.691 --> 18:46.861
So then, as it is now, you are absolutely certified by God

18:46.886 --> 18:48.916
that you are realized souls.

18:49.906 --> 18:52.856
Naturally you must change everything.

18:55.756 --> 18:59.756
No use typifying yourself, identifying yourself

19:02.726 --> 19:07.856
with something that is now, you have given up.

19:07.906 --> 19:10.866
For example, from the egg now you have become the birds.

19:11.716 --> 19:15.776
Now birds don't identify themselves with the eggs

19:15.806 --> 19:18.796
and settle down in only one place, they fly.

19:18.856 --> 19:21.716
Now they have become birds, they are no more eggs.

19:21.866 --> 19:25.686
In the same way we should accept our position.

19:25.856 --> 19:30.756
We should accept ourselves as realized souls

19:30.796 --> 19:33.836
with self-esteem and understanding

19:33.886 --> 19:36.776
as to what is our purpose of life now;

19:36.806 --> 19:38.866
it is changed completely, entirely.

19:39.856 --> 19:42.756
Once you understand the purpose of your life,

19:42.806 --> 19:45.776
innately, not outside because I am saying,

19:45.826 --> 19:47.686
or is a mental process,

19:47.716 --> 19:50.716
but inside you feel responsible.

19:50.756 --> 19:54.826
You have got Realization to spread it all over the world

19:54.866 --> 19:57.806
and to emancipate the whole world.

19:58.756 --> 20:00.886
Once you realize this point

20:01.796 --> 20:04.746
then automatically you take up responsibilities

20:04.796 --> 20:06.806
and the Kundalini will rise.

20:08.686 --> 20:10.746
I know of many people who said,

20:10.776 --> 20:13.696
“Mother, we cannot speak, You know we have a stage fright.”

20:13.746 --> 20:15.856
All right, you just stand up, that's all.

20:17.746 --> 20:20.866
And they started giving lectures; I had to stop them.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.806
There are many who said that,

20:25.836 --> 20:28.746
“We cannot write any poems Mother, we are no good,

20:28.776 --> 20:29.916
we cannot sing.”

20:30.766 --> 20:33.716
I know of a girl who used to sing so horribly bad

20:33.856 --> 20:35.776
that people had to tell her that you…

20:35.846 --> 20:37.776
because she would always go out of tune

20:37.806 --> 20:39.766
and very loudly she would sing;

20:39.906 --> 20:41.661
then they had to tell her,

20:41.686 --> 20:42.746
“Now you better keep at the back

20:42.796 --> 20:44.746
and don't sing now any more.”

20:44.856 --> 20:48.906
Now she is the one who is sort of leading the group.

20:50.686 --> 20:53.716
So all these beautiful things start manifesting

20:53.766 --> 20:56.736
which you should accept that they have come to you,

20:57.766 --> 21:02.706
and give up all that you call as fear.

21:04.856 --> 21:07.776
All kinds of fear we have.

21:08.686 --> 21:12.716
These are all left-sided things as you have seen yesterday,

21:12.746 --> 21:14.736
left-sided man what he should do.

21:15.846 --> 21:20.686
But what a left-sided man has to know

21:20.746 --> 21:23.886
that he is now an enlightened soul

21:24.856 --> 21:29.826
and no one can touch him, leave alone destroy.

21:30.776 --> 21:33.826
No saint will be destroyed.

21:33.896 --> 21:36.926
Those who will try to destroy you

21:37.726 --> 21:41.746
will, in a very interesting manner, will be finished.

21:42.696 --> 21:44.926
Not destroyed but very interesting manner,

21:44.996 --> 21:48.746
very jocular manner.

21:48.816 --> 21:50.776
You'll laugh at

21:50.866 --> 21:53.926
that and you will enjoy the way things are working out.

21:54.776 --> 21:56.746
Like there's a saying in Sanskrit,

21:56.806 --> 21:58.806
“vinashkale viprit budhi,”

21:58.856 --> 22:01.786
means their destruction will start

22:01.836 --> 22:04.856
by their own stupid methods.

22:05.716 --> 22:07.696
They'll become stupid.

22:07.816 --> 22:10.856
And at every stage you'll see they are becoming stupid

22:11.806 --> 22:14.806
and by that stupidity they are destroying themselves.

22:14.836 --> 22:16.806
You don't have to worry about that part.

22:16.886 --> 22:19.706
So that's why you don't need any destructive powers.

22:19.856 --> 22:25.696
It will all be done by this all-pervading Divine Power.

22:25.916 --> 22:28.437
So that part you have to give up.

22:28.604 --> 22:31.746
You just forgive that person.

22:32.896 --> 22:34.926
As soon as you forgive,

22:36.896 --> 22:39.816
the responsibility from you shifts

22:41.696 --> 22:43.806
and then Kundalini rises.

22:44.786 --> 22:48.786
You don't have to carry any malice, anything against him,

22:48.836 --> 22:52.726
but just laugh because they are blind,

22:52.896 --> 22:54.926
because they are stupid,

22:55.726 --> 22:56.866
they are foolish.

22:58.716 --> 23:01.746
What do we do if you see an idiot?

23:02.696 --> 23:04.816
We may not laugh in his presence but we do,

23:04.856 --> 23:08.816
isn't it, at his back, because he's an idiot.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.856
So they become idiotic

23:13.786 --> 23:17.716
and you see them becoming idiotic and then you just start.

23:17.756 --> 23:19.517
You see that's the humor of Sahaja Yoga,

23:19.542 --> 23:21.806
you have to have some humor also, isn't it?

23:22.836 --> 23:25.746
And then you start seeing these jokers you see,

23:25.786 --> 23:27.706
behaving in that manner

23:27.806 --> 23:32.836
and the whole circus they do is nothing but jocular.

23:33.866 --> 23:37.836
So there's nothing to have any fear from any human being;

23:38.866 --> 23:41.746
same about organizations or anything.

23:41.786 --> 23:43.886
Naturally you have to know one thing:

23:44.746 --> 23:46.746
that as you are Realized souls,

23:46.926 --> 23:48.786
you have seen the truth,

23:48.836 --> 23:50.866
you are in the light so they are going to oppose you,

23:50.896 --> 23:52.836
they are going to oppose you.

23:54.846 --> 23:57.876
They did this, isn't it, to others;

23:58.776 --> 24:01.836
everybody suffered so much.

24:03.866 --> 24:06.786
But now no more sufferings to you,

24:06.896 --> 24:10.846
only thing you can enjoy the humor.

24:12.746 --> 24:14.836
Just understand this point,

24:14.906 --> 24:18.826
that nothing will destroy you, no one can touch you

24:18.906 --> 24:23.766
but they are there just to supply some humor for you.

24:24.686 --> 24:27.315
If you take such a light attitude towards them,

24:27.716 --> 24:30.726
all this fear and left side will go away.

24:31.916 --> 24:35.856
What are these baddhas, and what are these bhoots,

24:35.906 --> 24:38.806
and what are these tantrikas? Nothing.

24:38.866 --> 24:40.836
You are so powerful.

24:40.906 --> 24:42.826
Just with one glance

24:42.876 --> 24:45.686
you can see them dancing on their heads,

24:45.826 --> 24:47.766
the other way round.

24:48.906 --> 24:51.796
As long as you'll have fear

24:51.836 --> 24:56.716
Kundalini won't rise because She doesn't rise for people

24:56.776 --> 24:58.746
who are cowards.

24:59.696 --> 25:01.886
Cowardice She is not going to support.

25:02.696 --> 25:04.856
If you are a coward She said, “All right”.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.826
You are walking on the street,

25:08.916 --> 25:12.806
normally people are afraid if there's darkness,

25:12.866 --> 25:16.716
afraid that somebody might attack,

25:16.826 --> 25:18.776
but a Sahaja Yogi does not,

25:18.826 --> 25:19.836
if he's a real Sahaja Yogi,

25:19.886 --> 25:22.746
because he knows there are ganas

25:22.796 --> 25:24.716
and there are angels around him.

25:24.746 --> 25:26.696
No one can touch him,

25:26.836 --> 25:28.796
and the one who will try,

25:29.696 --> 25:32.691
these ganas will make such a fool out of that person

25:32.716 --> 25:34.806
that you'll have a nice chance to laugh at him.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.766
Now you watch and see.

25:39.916 --> 25:44.886
So this left side or this fear should go.

25:44.916 --> 25:48.686
Once this fear will go all your slyness,

25:48.746 --> 25:54.886
all your intrigues, all your jealousies will just disappear.

25:56.906 --> 26:01.696
That's how the Kundalini will rise very well.

26:06.726 --> 26:13.806
Then another problem is for the awakening of the Kundalini,

26:13.856 --> 26:15.826
is your ego.

26:15.876 --> 26:18.726
That's tremendous, I must admit,

26:19.686 --> 26:22.726
rather too much for people who follow Christ,

26:22.766 --> 26:26.686
is very surprising and those who follow Buddha,

26:27.856 --> 26:29.916
because they are anti-Christ,

26:30.746 --> 26:32.886
because they are anti-Buddha.

26:33.796 --> 26:36.806
The one who on the cross said that,

26:36.856 --> 26:37.806
“Oh Father,

26:37.856 --> 26:41.686
forgive them for they do not know what they are doing”;

26:41.776 --> 26:45.513
if you are following Him how can you have ego?

26:49.916 --> 26:58.726
Now the forgiveness should be absolutely spontaneous within.

27:03.746 --> 27:08.876
There should be no ripple even of anger

27:09.686 --> 27:11.836
because you are so powerful.

27:14.876 --> 27:18.776
What can anybody harm you?

27:18.886 --> 27:20.856
But if you catch on your Agnya,

27:20.886 --> 27:22.746
only you are harming yourself.

27:22.776 --> 27:25.776
If you want to harm yourself nobody can help it.

27:28.726 --> 27:31.876
So this anger, which comes from liver

27:31.916 --> 27:38.766
and settles down in your Agnya, has to be looked into.

27:39.776 --> 27:42.876
That's a very important thing where Kundalini stops,

27:42.906 --> 27:44.916
in the West specially.

27:47.926 --> 27:54.816
Because this whole culture here has created two problems.

27:55.906 --> 28:01.706
The first one is acquisition instinct,

28:03.686 --> 28:06.816
what you call as greed.

28:07.816 --> 28:11.816
The more greed you have the more these machines can run

28:11.856 --> 28:16.826
and you can have industrial development of plastics,

28:17.716 --> 28:21.746
and then have a conference against ecology.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.786
In Spain I saw,

28:27.706 --> 28:29.886
I don't know, there must be three, four car factories

28:29.926 --> 28:32.766
because every car had only one driver

28:32.816 --> 28:34.856
because it had to be there.

28:35.876 --> 28:38.796
And so many cars

28:39.766 --> 28:42.746
that you just don't know how to move.

28:42.786 --> 28:45.816
For your program also is impossible,

28:45.856 --> 28:47.816
you must start two hours earlier

28:47.856 --> 28:49.886
when you can just take fifteen minutes.

28:50.856 --> 28:54.706
In France is another thing, Paris.

28:54.906 --> 28:57.736
Paris, if you want to go somewhere

28:57.786 --> 29:00.816
you should start at four o'clock in the morning,

29:01.746 --> 29:04.746
otherwise you cannot reach that place.

29:06.736 --> 29:10.876
Same about Milan and same about Rome.

29:11.786 --> 29:13.826
The worst is Switzerland,

29:14.706 --> 29:17.761
I don't know what to say about Switzerland,

29:17.786 --> 29:21.726
the name itself is rather, very dangerous,

29:26.926 --> 29:30.876
because they are making all ugly money,

29:30.926 --> 29:32.756
they are doing all these things,

29:32.786 --> 29:34.846
I mean every kind of sin they have got

29:34.896 --> 29:37.836
in the name of acquisition.

29:37.916 --> 29:41.701
For them nothing like sin, taking somebody's money nicely,

29:41.726 --> 29:44.756
keeping that there, extracting money from poor countries,

29:44.816 --> 29:46.896
keeping, they don't feel there's anything wrong,

29:46.926 --> 29:49.696
I mean, they have become immune.

29:52.846 --> 29:55.836
So this acquisition instinct that we have

29:55.916 --> 29:57.886
and which has been very much fanned

29:57.926 --> 30:03.926
and has been made into a big sort of a quality in the West,

30:06.756 --> 30:10.836
we should try to see it clearly.

30:11.836 --> 30:15.776
In the olden days in the same European countries

30:16.776 --> 30:19.806
this was used for creating art,

30:20.916 --> 30:24.816
for producing artist, for supporting artist.

30:25.836 --> 30:27.726
Even in our country,

30:27.756 --> 30:29.886
artists were supported by the kings

30:29.926 --> 30:33.776
and all the big empires that we had.

30:35.866 --> 30:38.706
These days there's no question,

30:38.746 --> 30:41.756
no government is willing to support the artist.

30:42.776 --> 30:45.836
You know that Mozart was called by the queen herself

30:45.926 --> 30:47.926
to play before her.

30:49.786 --> 30:53.706
So the governments were not only looking after

30:53.736 --> 30:55.696
the collection of taxes

30:55.960 --> 30:58.671
but they were looking after the artists,

30:58.696 --> 31:04.816
musicians, painters and people who did creative art.

31:06.916 --> 31:08.926
Like in France you can see

31:09.896 --> 31:13.806
how their queen collected beautiful artistic things

31:13.846 --> 31:15.926
and encouraged artists

31:18.706 --> 31:20.776
to do artistic work,

31:20.816 --> 31:22.866
spent her money in that,

31:23.836 --> 31:27.886
and now, you know that she was killed by people.

31:28.786 --> 31:32.786
By killing her they have killed the art of France.

31:37.866 --> 31:41.776
And now the French themselves have become bourgeois,

31:41.816 --> 31:44.816
those whom they condemned, they have become that.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.806
So acquisition instinct

31:48.866 --> 31:57.706
has to be taken to the acquisition of art.

32:00.706 --> 32:05.696
That also should not be plastic

32:05.746 --> 32:08.846
otherwise tomorrow we might start buying plastic

32:08.886 --> 32:10.926
artistic things.

32:11.836 --> 32:15.866
Genuinely made, hand made things.

32:19.696 --> 32:23.666
Or the music also which is very deep,

32:23.726 --> 32:28.816
classical, singing the songs of the Divine;

32:28.866 --> 32:32.756
not the cheap type music which just makes you mad

32:32.786 --> 32:38.846
or makes you full of lust and greed.

32:40.696 --> 32:43.726
So this is one of the problems of your culture

32:43.786 --> 32:48.916
which gives you this kind of a ego.

32:51.746 --> 32:58.746
I mean, people if they have say, a Rolls Royce

32:59.746 --> 33:01.846
then of course nobody can talk to them,

33:01.886 --> 33:06.756
their brain has blown out of their hats, completely.

33:06.806 --> 33:09.896
But even the driver of the Rolls Royce

33:10.886 --> 33:13.746
who doesn't own the Rolls Royce, he drives it,

33:13.786 --> 33:15.856
his head is off.

33:16.816 --> 33:19.836
He has a different gait, he walks in a different way,

33:19.886 --> 33:22.726
he talks in a different way.

33:27.726 --> 33:32.836
So this acquisition instinct gives you so much of ego.

33:33.786 --> 33:35.866
I mean, you go to somebody's house,

33:36.756 --> 33:39.866
like some stupid Indians who are now in England

33:41.696 --> 33:43.696
I went to their house;

33:43.746 --> 33:48.701
they're sadarjis - means following the path of Guru Nanaka

33:48.726 --> 33:50.886
where drinking is not allowed.

33:51.756 --> 33:55.916
So as soon as you rise he shows us a pub in his house.

33:56.816 --> 34:02.412
“My God,” I said. I went back three, four steps, you see.

34:02.816 --> 34:06.746
He says, “See my pubu,” as he says,

34:06.916 --> 34:11.776
and from the pub he takes out a soda thing and shows us how

34:11.836 --> 34:14.786
it pumps out the soda, just imagine

34:17.756 --> 34:19.866
and he wouldn't talk, you know.

34:20.706 --> 34:22.806
And when we said, "We don't drink,"

34:22.866 --> 34:25.926
he thought we were sinners of the worst type,

34:27.726 --> 34:29.756
that we don't drink.

34:30.806 --> 34:34.726
So this acquisition instinct is now ending up

34:34.886 --> 34:41.706
into something which is very cheap, vulgar and immoral.

34:46.856 --> 34:49.856
The fondness for showing off

34:50.716 --> 34:54.906
is so much that you are sometimes shocked,

34:55.826 --> 34:58.806
the way people try to show off.

34:59.736 --> 35:02.776
Like a American lady came from America

35:03.686 --> 35:05.746
and she asked Me, “Mrs. Srivastava,

35:05.776 --> 35:08.716
how many pubs You have seen in London?”

35:09.706 --> 35:10.776
I said, “None.”

35:10.806 --> 35:17.876
“Oh, You are good for nothing, useless, absolutely.

35:18.716 --> 35:22.876
You haven't seen any pub. The best houses in any village,

35:22.916 --> 35:25.826
any city in England is a pub.”

35:26.786 --> 35:28.726
I said, “From outside I have seen.”

35:28.786 --> 35:30.706
All right, just to satisfy;

35:30.756 --> 35:32.756
I thought she’s artistic.

35:33.806 --> 35:38.876
“No, no, no, no. Do You know the best pub in London?”

35:39.706 --> 35:41.846
She gave Me the list, you know.

35:43.896 --> 35:45.886
I said, “Which one is the best?”

35:45.926 --> 35:48.806
“There was one called Hermit's Pub.”

35:49.786 --> 35:51.876
I said: "What is this supposed to be?"

35:52.756 --> 35:57.726
"You know, the man who was living in this house died

35:57.846 --> 36:00.756
and nobody knew that he's dead,

36:01.786 --> 36:06.756
so for months together nobody went in

36:06.816 --> 36:09.786
and the whole place was filled with that stink,

36:10.736 --> 36:13.726
and lots of cobwebs were there.

36:13.926 --> 36:16.886
Then they removed that

36:19.786 --> 36:21.816
dead body from there,

36:21.846 --> 36:25.698
and the stink is still there and the cobwebs,

36:25.726 --> 36:27.776
absolutely intact, you know.

36:28.756 --> 36:31.756
You have to be careful that you don't break them.

36:32.756 --> 36:37.726
And there, that is the best pub,

36:37.776 --> 36:40.776
for which you have to pay quite a lot.

36:40.926 --> 36:42.816
And I have seen that.”

36:42.846 --> 36:47.846
So proud. So where does it end then?

36:48.756 --> 36:52.886
This acquisition instinct ends in where?

36:54.696 --> 36:57.896
In rottening things, in putrefying,

36:59.726 --> 37:01.806
you may call it fermenting.

37:04.926 --> 37:07.736
It has to end up

37:07.806 --> 37:09.846
because the reaction of the ego comes

37:09.896 --> 37:14.816
and you start enjoying things which are rotten.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.926
Like cheese of France,

37:18.786 --> 37:23.776
never eat that, I tell you, you'll burn your finger,

37:23.866 --> 37:27.836
you will burn your throat and you'll burn your stomach.

37:28.866 --> 37:31.706
It is very rotten,

37:31.866 --> 37:34.836
and the more rotten it is the better.

37:36.706 --> 37:40.786
The wine, the wine is the rotten grape juice,

37:40.836 --> 37:42.726
absolutely rotten,

37:42.756 --> 37:43.866
you can't take it,

37:43.916 --> 37:48.886
it smells, I've seen smells like a rotten cork.

37:51.696 --> 37:53.816
I asked somebody, “How does it smell?”

37:53.866 --> 37:55.886
He said, “It's very fine.”

37:56.696 --> 38:00.736
I said, “Does it smell like rotten cork?”

38:00.776 --> 38:02.736
“I've never smelt a cork.”

38:02.846 --> 38:05.896
That's why I said - if he had smelt a rotten cork

38:06.696 --> 38:08.866
he would never have taken to wine;

38:09.756 --> 38:12.916
so all things that are rotten.

38:13.786 --> 38:15.886
You know the discovery of cheese, what had happened,

38:15.896 --> 38:17.876
how it started, do you know that?

38:18.836 --> 38:24.696
There was a big snowfall and milk was left in one cave.

38:24.846 --> 38:28.866
So because of the snowfall everybody forgot about the milk,

38:29.696 --> 38:34.896
it was left there, then summer time the milk became rotten,

38:34.921 --> 38:37.836
then it became more rotten, more rotten.

38:37.926 --> 38:42.706
After twelve years or so, somebody went and saw this there.

38:51.776 --> 38:54.846
Thank God I have not taken My food today.

38:59.696 --> 39:03.806
And so they took that milk,

39:03.836 --> 39:06.726
they called it cheese.

39:10.706 --> 39:14.806
In India cheez is used in Urdu language specially,

39:14.846 --> 39:16.886
for something which is,

39:17.726 --> 39:20.806
something special thing, something very special,

39:20.896 --> 39:23.806
and also as you know in music they use it

39:23.846 --> 39:28.926
for some special composition, cheez.

39:30.836 --> 39:37.756
But here the cheese is the most rotten milk

39:38.706 --> 39:41.926
which no human beings or animals should eat.

39:42.786 --> 39:46.756
Worms may, so they gave it to worms,

39:46.836 --> 39:54.706
and I know in Holland and also in Sweden I think, yah,

39:56.916 --> 39:59.916
they had cheese with worms

40:00.726 --> 40:02.816
and they were eating the worms;

40:02.886 --> 40:06.726
can you beat it, it is true;

40:07.736 --> 40:09.926
not only the cheese but also the worms.

40:11.926 --> 40:14.706
I mean see where we have ended up

40:14.756 --> 40:16.926
into our acquisition instinct.

40:19.706 --> 40:23.681
The wine has to be hundred year old, certified,

40:23.706 --> 40:24.846
that's the best.

40:27.816 --> 40:31.706
Such rotten things we are eating,

40:31.746 --> 40:34.706
they smell, I tell you, they smell of it.

40:34.776 --> 40:37.806
That's why, once I was surprised that,

40:37.926 --> 40:40.846
they go to the bathroom, don't even wash their hands.

40:40.926 --> 40:43.756
We get such horrible smells, they don't get

40:43.786 --> 40:45.736
because if you take that cheese

40:45.786 --> 40:47.896
you cannot smell anything rotten.

40:48.876 --> 40:50.806
Even if you put them in the gutters

40:50.846 --> 40:52.671
they won't feel anything rotten

40:52.696 --> 40:56.706
because it's all that dirty smell, they are used to.

40:57.806 --> 40:59.806
Is the filth, I mean even if they go to hell

40:59.836 --> 41:02.736
they won't feel bad because the smell will be the same.

41:08.756 --> 41:10.896
So where should we put them?

41:13.786 --> 41:16.726
They are so immune to that dirty smell

41:17.806 --> 41:20.916
which is absolutely sub-human.

41:22.756 --> 41:26.806
So this acquisition instinct in any elite society

41:26.886 --> 41:29.866
- once upon a time French society was regarded as elite

41:54.756 --> 41:58.551
- so the most elite society was the French society

41:58.576 --> 42:04.696
was most diplomatic in every way.

42:04.826 --> 42:08.886
Their food was made with wine, everything was wine,

42:09.916 --> 42:14.826
and this diplomatic society once upon… ruled the whole

42:14.866 --> 42:16.906
diplomatic areas.

42:19.686 --> 42:22.716
But they never realized

42:22.886 --> 42:29.686
that the whole culture was nothing but eating and drinking.

42:30.826 --> 42:34.766
Nothing else but eating and drinking.

42:36.906 --> 42:40.796
And later on maybe little politics started.

42:41.836 --> 42:44.906
But this eating and drinking

42:45.836 --> 42:48.696
went to such a limit

42:49.726 --> 42:53.387
that now they have gone out of diplomatic areas;

42:53.412 --> 42:57.856
no one wants them because they never think in the right way.

42:57.906 --> 43:00.776
Any diplomat, French diplomat is anywhere,

43:00.836 --> 43:03.716
people say, “Is he French?” “Yes.”

43:03.796 --> 43:05.766
“Then better not call him for this meeting,

43:05.806 --> 43:10.826
you know, he'll put his own ideas.” They went out.

43:11.716 --> 43:15.906
So now that eliteness is shifted in America.

43:16.806 --> 43:19.746
So the most elite are taking to drugs.

43:19.776 --> 43:21.696
What is it after all?

43:21.726 --> 43:25.806
Drugs is creation of this acquisition instinct only.

43:28.696 --> 43:31.866
Why should you blame Colombians or anybody else?

43:31.876 --> 43:33.686
They are making their money, all right

43:33.716 --> 43:34.886
as you are all making,

43:35.746 --> 43:37.856
but the one they are feeding is America,

43:37.906 --> 43:42.796
and America is the main thing now in acquisition instinct.

43:42.876 --> 43:44.886
And what are they acquiring?

43:45.746 --> 43:47.796
I have been in that society,

43:47.836 --> 43:50.686
they only talk of drugs.

43:50.696 --> 43:51.886
All right,

43:52.716 --> 43:54.806
drugs they talk not only that

43:54.826 --> 43:57.716
but it's like a shopping of drugs.

43:58.686 --> 44:00.746
They all know where you get drugs,

44:00.776 --> 44:03.766
all these so-called ambassadors and these people,

44:03.806 --> 44:05.766
and their wives.

44:05.836 --> 44:08.846
With all their dresses have become simpler now,

44:08.856 --> 44:11.806
they do not dress up the way formerly

44:11.836 --> 44:13.916
the ambassadors’ wives used to dress up.

44:14.736 --> 44:18.876
I will not be surprised if they come in holey pants.

44:22.686 --> 44:25.686
So this acquisition instinct you can see in the

44:25.736 --> 44:28.736
elite society has ended up into drugs,

44:28.886 --> 44:33.746
and if not, into gurus - false gurus.

44:33.806 --> 44:36.796
Those who got fed up with this went to false gurus

44:36.826 --> 44:38.796
because they have no discrimination

44:38.836 --> 44:41.776
to know what is right and what is wrong.

44:43.806 --> 44:48.766
See, step by step, how it has gone into the rotten state,

44:48.806 --> 44:51.826
this ego, in the West.

44:51.886 --> 44:54.696
So this is the first point,

44:54.876 --> 44:59.706
is the acquisition instinct you have.

44:59.796 --> 45:02.856
In that then somebody’s wife is good-looking,

45:02.906 --> 45:06.846
then every man has a right to look at her.

45:07.716 --> 45:10.846
Or some man is good-looking, maybe anybody’s husband

45:10.876 --> 45:13.244
– every woman has right to look at him.

45:13.269 --> 45:15.766
Not look at her own husband but another man,

45:15.796 --> 45:17.686
what’s the use?

45:17.716 --> 45:18.846
I’ve never been able to understand,

45:18.886 --> 45:20.846
“What’s the use of looking at another man

45:20.886 --> 45:23.696
who is not your husband?”

45:26.716 --> 45:30.317
This acquisition instinct has gone

45:30.696 --> 45:35.766
into complete immoral life, immoral society

45:35.846 --> 45:43.876
and they have lost sense of respect of their age.

45:45.716 --> 45:49.876
A ninety-year-old woman having a love affair

45:49.886 --> 45:52.846
with a grandson who is eighteen-year-old;

45:52.916 --> 45:58.686
just think of that, such stupidity, such nonsense.

45:58.856 --> 46:02.826
How is it possible unless and until

46:02.876 --> 46:08.736
we have some sort of a perverted acquisition instinct?

46:08.906 --> 46:11.826
Even art has gone into perversion,

46:11.916 --> 46:14.886
everything has gone into perversion

46:19.846 --> 46:23.856
- because the curse of the Western society is that

46:23.886 --> 46:26.856
there is no maryada.

46:27.876 --> 46:31.826
And Kundalini rises in its own maryada,

46:32.826 --> 46:35.766
it brings back your maryadas,

46:35.806 --> 46:37.876
it keeps you into your maryadas.

46:37.906 --> 46:39.826
You are a human being,

46:39.876 --> 46:42.826
don't live like animals, even worse than animals.

46:42.876 --> 46:47.686
You have no right to do that.

46:47.736 --> 46:51.380
God has not created you to be sub-human

46:51.428 --> 46:53.856
but to be super-human being.

46:53.916 --> 46:57.856
So, this is how it works out.

46:59.876 --> 47:02.776
You can now think about it, how far it goes

47:02.806 --> 47:04.856
this acquisition instinct,

47:06.766 --> 47:08.776
about things.

47:10.796 --> 47:13.876
But the second very bad curse

47:14.806 --> 47:19.686
of the Western acquisition instinct is

47:19.716 --> 47:24.716
that they want to acquire, aggress, others.

47:28.686 --> 47:31.806
Aggression, the aggressiveness.

47:33.736 --> 47:36.846
They think they have a right to aggress other countries,

47:36.886 --> 47:40.736
I mean they aggressed our country for three hundred years.

47:40.766 --> 47:43.886
Why? Why did they aggress? We are not bad people.

47:44.696 --> 47:48.776
Because we had gold, we had diamonds,

47:49.766 --> 47:52.716
we had pearls,

47:52.856 --> 47:54.796
we had lots of things

47:54.826 --> 47:58.766
which were just material things for which they aggressed us,

47:58.806 --> 48:01.876
and they didn't take any spirituality from India.

48:02.766 --> 48:04.796
So the French aggressed, these aggressed,

48:04.826 --> 48:05.876
all the time aggressing.

48:05.916 --> 48:08.886
Japanese are also following you.

48:11.776 --> 48:14.796
This aggression then moves the whole society

48:14.846 --> 48:18.696
into a very destructive force.

48:18.846 --> 48:22.686
You can see every day the wars are going on,

48:22.716 --> 48:24.696
this is fighting that, that is fighting that,

48:24.746 --> 48:26.796
they want this, they want that.

48:26.856 --> 48:29.806
And this aggression has also penetrated

48:29.846 --> 48:32.746
the developing countries, the third world also.

48:32.776 --> 48:36.846
So, nicely the disease is on.

48:40.826 --> 48:46.736
But Kundalini kills that acquisition.

48:47.736 --> 48:50.746
How? By giving you joy.

48:52.736 --> 48:54.846
You enjoy everything.

48:55.776 --> 48:58.716
You are sitting in a jungle, you are enjoying,

48:58.826 --> 49:01.826
here in uncomfortable conditions, you enjoy

49:01.876 --> 49:05.806
because you seek the comfort of your spirit,

49:05.846 --> 49:07.681
because that gives you joy

49:07.706 --> 49:10.796
- ultimately that's what you get out of everything.

49:10.906 --> 49:13.886
You think you get joy by acquisition; you do not.

49:16.686 --> 49:19.916
But through Kundalini awakening you get that joy,

49:20.736 --> 49:24.826
and in that joy you don't want anything,

49:26.736 --> 49:27.826
you don't ask for anything;

49:27.876 --> 49:29.776
you just enjoy yourself;

49:29.806 --> 49:32.796
you are the property of enjoyment.

49:33.876 --> 49:36.916
Sanskrit they say,  “Atmanyeva atmane ahrushta”

49:37.766 --> 49:41.826
- “The Spirit is satisfied by its own spirit.”

49:45.766 --> 49:49.796
So into small things you must see joy,

49:50.776 --> 49:55.776
and you must watch it, the whole universe, with that thing.

49:56.696 --> 49:58.706
I mean when I am traveling I'll ask,

49:58.736 --> 49:59.816
“What is this tree?”

49:59.846 --> 50:00.896
“Mother, we don't know.”

50:00.916 --> 50:02.876
“Well, you lived here for so many years, you don't know?”

50:02.896 --> 50:04.896
“No Mother, we don't know much about trees.”

50:04.926 --> 50:06.726
I say, “What are these flowers?”

50:06.756 --> 50:07.806
“We don't know.”

50:08.726 --> 50:10.756
I mean what are you doing, what have you been doing,

50:10.776 --> 50:11.756
you don't know what are the trees,

50:11.786 --> 50:12.896
every day you watch them;

50:12.926 --> 50:15.806
you don't know what is the tree is?

50:18.816 --> 50:21.746
But if you ask them, “Where do you get this wine?”

50:21.786 --> 50:22.896
they will know.

50:22.896 --> 50:24.716
“Mother, this is the place

50:24.756 --> 50:26.706
where they produced the best wines.”

50:26.716 --> 50:27.866
“All right, I'll see to it.”

50:27.906 --> 50:31.796
And next year they had no fermentation.

50:36.816 --> 50:41.681
So, this is the acquisition instinct which is very,

50:41.706 --> 50:45.650
sort of a, which becomes a political asset

50:45.675 --> 50:46.896
that you go and aggress other countries,

50:46.926 --> 50:51.786
aggress other people and use all kinds of things;

50:54.766 --> 50:57.826
and that really is killing.

50:59.686 --> 51:02.756
So the whole attitude of human beings changes,

51:02.796 --> 51:04.206
they think we are the Lord,

51:04.365 --> 51:05.796
we can hate anyone,

51:05.866 --> 51:07.706
we can aggress anyone,

51:07.736 --> 51:08.876
we could be arrogant with anyone,

51:08.926 --> 51:12.706
we can demand anything, we can take away anybody's wife,

51:12.756 --> 51:15.349
take away anybody's child, take away anything,

51:15.374 --> 51:17.686
we can kill our children.

51:18.836 --> 51:23.816
As a result the love is lost;

51:23.896 --> 51:26.896
no question of compassion.

51:27.736 --> 51:30.846
Love is lost, compassion is lost; no love.

51:33.896 --> 51:37.796
And with that you also developed “my” and “mine”,

51:37.816 --> 51:39.816
sense of “my and mine”

51:40.846 --> 51:43.726
- is that this is my child,

51:44.706 --> 51:46.726
this is my country,

51:47.686 --> 51:51.836
this is... As you know in Yugoslavia what they are doing.

51:51.866 --> 51:55.926
I don't know who gave the name of Yugo, Yugo means Yoga.

51:56.736 --> 52:00.796
This is the Yoga people, fighting among themselves.

52:00.896 --> 52:05.846
This has come from the same root that,

52:05.876 --> 52:07.836
“This is mine, this is my country”.

52:07.866 --> 52:10.706
Why? How is it your country?

52:10.766 --> 52:13.786
You can't create one leaf, so who are you?

52:13.816 --> 52:17.926
You can't create little mud, can you?

52:19.926 --> 52:23.776
How do you say, “This is my country?” How dare?

52:23.786 --> 52:25.896
This all belongs to God.

52:26.716 --> 52:29.836
He has created, or you can say Adi Shakti has created.

52:30.746 --> 52:32.886
You have not created even so much;

52:32.926 --> 52:36.756
how do you say, “This is mine and I should have it?”

52:36.826 --> 52:41.916
So the “my” and “mine” thing also develops, very strong.

52:42.746 --> 52:45.716
And the same thing happens with, sometimes, Sahaja Yogis,

52:45.756 --> 52:50.756
very much. “My children”, this is the first curse.

52:52.756 --> 52:58.716
“These are my children, my wife, my family”,

52:59.826 --> 53:02.726
it starts growing like that.

53:04.746 --> 53:07.886
Then the heart shrinks.

53:08.866 --> 53:13.158
For a large-hearted man the whole world is the universe,

53:13.428 --> 53:16.836
the whole thing is within,

53:16.866 --> 53:19.686
the whole thing is yours.

53:21.876 --> 53:26.846
When such a heart you experience within yourself

53:26.896 --> 53:29.190
then Kundalini just shoots off because,

53:29.269 --> 53:31.916
as you know, the Sahasrara is the Heart Chakra.

53:32.896 --> 53:35.876
No question of Sahasrara catching

53:36.756 --> 53:38.806
if you have a large heart.

53:39.736 --> 53:41.916
And to keep the Sahasrara open

53:42.726 --> 53:47.706
- is just develop that sense, that wisdom,

53:47.756 --> 53:50.786
that: "Nobody's mine, everybody belongs to God.

53:50.816 --> 53:52.816
Who is mine?

53:54.736 --> 53:56.846
Whatever God wants, let Him do."

53:56.916 --> 54:00.836
So get out of this small feeling.

54:00.866 --> 54:04.706
Sahaja Yogis do, I must say, I have seen it.

54:04.766 --> 54:07.846
They get confined to their families.

54:09.756 --> 54:11.706
“My son hasn't got Realization,

54:11.756 --> 54:13.836
my brother hasn't got Realization, my this thing.”

54:14.866 --> 54:18.726
After that it moves, when they get Realization,

54:18.756 --> 54:21.726
“This is my son, my brother, my sister, this thing.”

54:21.766 --> 54:25.706
This “my” has to drop, which is very, very subtle thing,

54:25.736 --> 54:27.846
and that's why the Sahasrara catches.

54:28.816 --> 54:31.726
Everyone is yours

54:33.856 --> 54:41.916
because the Kundalini of Sahaja Yogis is made of love,

54:43.776 --> 54:45.776
pure love.

54:45.916 --> 54:50.696
The pure love has only pure desire, is to love,

54:50.836 --> 54:53.866
love everyone equally.

54:55.746 --> 54:56.866
When you say it is difficult

54:56.896 --> 54:59.696
that means you are not trying Sahaja Yoga.

54:59.896 --> 55:01.866
Enlarge your heart;

55:01.916 --> 55:03.896
you'll never feel lost.

55:04.716 --> 55:08.886
To Me, when I was leaving England I was really, little bit,

55:08.926 --> 55:13.726
I mean happens like that, like a moon sucks in the sea,

55:13.776 --> 55:17.756
you see, I felt My heart was just pulled out,

55:17.896 --> 55:23.726
but I reach here, again I see My children waiting for Me,

55:24.746 --> 55:26.866
so it's over, finished.

55:27.696 --> 55:30.866
It's there I felt, now here I feel

55:31.816 --> 55:37.746
that pull of My heart was released.

55:39.746 --> 55:43.726
You are also My children here and they are also My children.

55:43.776 --> 55:45.866
For a Mother like this, how can I say,

55:45.916 --> 55:48.836
“Oh, say this is Mine, this is Mine?”

55:50.776 --> 55:55.866
So like this, try to break away from this conditioning.

55:55.896 --> 55:58.866
First, in the West people don't care for family;

55:58.896 --> 56:01.836
they'll divorce ten times and advertise it,

56:01.866 --> 56:04.756
“I am tenth time divorced lady."

56:05.696 --> 56:08.866
Now they don't divorce but so get attached

56:09.916 --> 56:12.856
with their family, with their husbands;

56:12.896 --> 56:15.776
like glue I tell you, like glue.

56:16.756 --> 56:17.866
Sometimes I start wondering,

56:17.916 --> 56:21.726
“What have I done to make them like this?”

56:22.896 --> 56:26.776
So now it is important to see these points,

56:26.826 --> 56:31.896
and ultimately the heart is the Sahasrara,

56:32.696 --> 56:33.916
or you can call the Brahmarandra,

56:34.716 --> 56:37.786
then we have to come to heart.

56:37.836 --> 56:41.786
Do not reason out, do not argue it out,

56:42.696 --> 56:46.746
don't work it out mentally from books or anywhere,

56:46.786 --> 56:48.696
but through your heart,

56:48.746 --> 56:49.786
if you work it out,

56:49.826 --> 56:53.826
you'll understand that nothing is more important

56:54.776 --> 56:57.716
than to love someone.

56:58.696 --> 57:03.856
And the highest thing is to love everyone equally.

57:04.696 --> 57:07.776
Of course in love you might have to say something

57:07.826 --> 57:09.756
to a person.

57:10.696 --> 57:13.529
The other day I had to say something to some Sahaja Yogini,

57:13.756 --> 57:14.706
so My husband said,

57:14.756 --> 57:16.465
“Don't say, she'll become Your enemy.”

57:16.696 --> 57:18.671
I said, “Let her become My enemy, it doesn't matter.

57:18.696 --> 57:21.726
It's My duty to tell her that this is wrong,

57:21.876 --> 57:26.741
otherwise I become her enemy because I don't… told her

57:26.766 --> 57:28.816
the truth and she will suffer.”

57:31.796 --> 57:34.816
So this is what it gives you discretion;

57:34.906 --> 57:38.756
and love is truth.

57:39.836 --> 57:42.706
So to this Kundalini,

57:42.796 --> 57:48.766
which is nothing but, is the river,

57:48.846 --> 57:51.766
as yesterday they described nirvaj,

57:52.796 --> 57:56.876
which doesn't accept any compensation.

57:57.706 --> 58:00.896
The river of that pure love

58:01.726 --> 58:03.786
which has awakened us with such love,

58:03.836 --> 58:05.816
kindness and tenderness,

58:05.866 --> 58:11.736
we should try to use that power within ourselves

58:11.796 --> 58:14.846
to be like that because our job is,

58:14.906 --> 58:17.756
She has given us Realization

58:17.816 --> 58:20.896
for the emancipation of the whole world,

58:20.926 --> 58:22.786
not only our own.

58:22.836 --> 58:26.786
So everyone has to give Realization to others

58:26.836 --> 58:29.816
otherwise their Kundalini will settle back.

58:30.766 --> 58:34.826
Talk about Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is not part time,

58:35.736 --> 58:38.816
it is not a side issue, it should be always with you.

58:38.806 --> 58:40.796
Wherever you get a chance you have to talk

58:40.826 --> 58:42.806
about Sahaja Yoga, you have to work it out,

58:42.856 --> 58:46.856
you have to give Realization, otherwise no use.

58:47.916 --> 58:50.776
May God bless you all.
