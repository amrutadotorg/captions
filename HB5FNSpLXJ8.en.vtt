00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:09.418
Today we have gathered here to worship the Adi Kundalini

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:12.163
and your own Kundalini, both of them,

00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:16.093
because your Kundalini is the reflection

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.053
of the Adi Kundalini.

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:22.993
We have understood a lot

00:00:24.183 --> 00:00:26.153
about Kundalini

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:31.993
and also we know that

00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:34.183
through Her awakening only,

00:00:34.628 --> 00:00:36.163
through Her ascent only,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.053
we have ascended into a very higher realm of consciousness.

00:00:43.773 --> 00:00:49.153
It's not only that we have risen to a very higher realm

00:00:49.193 --> 00:00:52.213
of awareness

00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:59.013
but that it has granted us so many powers that,

00:00:59.983 --> 00:01:05.163
never before in the history of spirituality

00:01:07.073 --> 00:01:09.023
people had

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:13.213
this power of awakening of Kundalini.

00:01:15.213 --> 00:01:18.938
As soon as they got their awakening perhaps,

00:01:18.963 --> 00:01:22.053
they went more on to the left or to the right,

00:01:22.877 --> 00:01:26.193
and tried to achieve powers

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:34.083
which were not so much for the benevolence of others.

00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:39.033
Buddha has written clearly

00:01:39.143 --> 00:01:42.193
that, “When the incarnation of future Buddha,

00:01:42.223 --> 00:01:47.033
that is Maitreya, three Mothers put together, comes in,

00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:54.023
that time it will be used for the benevolence of people.”

00:01:54.053 --> 00:01:56.083
This is one of the signs,

00:01:57.093 --> 00:01:59.083
"of the people",

00:01:59.143 --> 00:02:04.083
not only of Sahaja Yogis but of the people.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:12.133
So how can it be unless and until those who are Buddhas,

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:14.203
means those who are Realized souls

00:02:15.163 --> 00:02:20.203
know the science of Kundalini?

00:02:22.223 --> 00:02:27.063
Those people who had very little knowledge about Kundalini,

00:02:27.223 --> 00:02:30.113
who must have read in some scriptures

00:02:30.173 --> 00:02:34.003
or somewhere which is being described,

00:02:37.113 --> 00:02:39.983
started misusing it

00:02:40.023 --> 00:02:42.173
and so they became tantrikas.

00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:47.023
But tantra, as you know very well,

00:02:47.483 --> 00:02:53.093
is the mechanism of Kundalini,

00:02:53.818 --> 00:02:59.053
and the yantra is the Kundalini itself,

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:03.083
is the machine.

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:09.133
Today I think,

00:03:09.173 --> 00:03:12.023
as we know so much about Kundalini,

00:03:12.113 --> 00:03:14.993
how it passes through different centers,

00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:19.113
how it rises, all those things as we know,

00:03:19.163 --> 00:03:25.003
we should find out how we can nourish our Kundalini.

00:03:25.063 --> 00:03:27.173
That's very important to know.

00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:38.113
First of all there's a big difference between

00:03:38.143 --> 00:03:43.143
you people and other people who got their Realization.

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:48.223
First big difference is this,

00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:56.083
that this power you have achieved Sahaj, easily.

00:03:57.063 --> 00:04:00.173
Others had to go to Himalayas,

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:05.193
stand in the cold air for days together, so many died,

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:08.033
live in the caves,

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:11.033
eating fruits,

00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:13.163
sometimes nothing.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.043
Even Buddha's time they had to use only one piece of cloth

00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:23.073
to cover their body

00:04:23.183 --> 00:04:29.043
and they had to ask for alms

00:04:31.203 --> 00:04:39.013
in the villages and somehow cook some food and eat it

00:04:39.093 --> 00:04:43.203
- whether it was cold or hot, no comforts.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:45.983
On the contrary,

00:04:46.073 --> 00:04:52.183
He taught them that you should give up all our comforts

00:04:54.183 --> 00:04:57.153
because you can live without comforts.

00:04:58.213 --> 00:05:03.183
But none of them got Realization

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:07.093
and none of them could do the work

00:05:07.123 --> 00:05:10.023
of awakening of Kundalini.

00:05:15.013 --> 00:05:21.043
So the difference is too much,

00:05:21.123 --> 00:05:24.053
the way you got your Realization,

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:29.993
the way your Kundalini, in a very Sahaj manner, was awakened

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:34.153
and the way you are manifesting those powers

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:36.133
that you have got.

00:05:36.213 --> 00:05:39.183
For example you can give Realization to others,

00:05:40.043 --> 00:05:42.013
you can cure others,

00:05:42.093 --> 00:05:45.023
you can feel the vibrations of others,

00:05:45.123 --> 00:05:46.983
there are some Sahaja Yogis

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:51.063
who can control rain, sun, moon, everything.

00:05:52.013 --> 00:05:54.103
Sahaja Yogis, some of them,

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:56.983
have tremendous powers of prayers.

00:05:57.063 --> 00:06:01.003
Just by praying they have saved the lives of many people.

00:06:04.103 --> 00:06:13.043
And these powers were available to some of them,

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:20.213
even to the rishis and great munis on those days,

00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:28.983
but their powers were not based on love and compassion.

00:06:29.033 --> 00:06:31.113
This is your special field

00:06:31.143 --> 00:06:39.013
because you have to work for the benevolence of the people.

00:06:40.043 --> 00:06:43.093
Their field was to protect themselves

00:06:43.983 --> 00:06:47.043
or to destroy.

00:06:48.003 --> 00:06:53.003
So they developed powers of curses,

00:06:53.103 --> 00:06:55.123
like sharp,

00:06:55.213 --> 00:06:58.013
they could curse people.

00:06:58.123 --> 00:07:00.983
You haven't got that power;

00:07:01.093 --> 00:07:03.203
you cannot curse anyone.

00:07:04.213 --> 00:07:09.003
Very nicely that power I have cancelled.

00:07:13.003 --> 00:07:18.033
Nor do I curse, I can, but I never curse anyone,

00:07:18.143 --> 00:07:27.213
because our basis is love and compassion and tenderliness.

00:07:29.123 --> 00:07:32.113
They were very hot-tempered people, most of them,

00:07:32.143 --> 00:07:34.043
extremely hot temper,

00:07:35.023 --> 00:07:39.983
and sometimes they used also terrible harsh languages

00:07:40.013 --> 00:07:43.213
whenever they spoke about the people

00:07:43.993 --> 00:07:46.103
who were not realized or who were troubling them.

00:07:46.123 --> 00:07:48.173
This was very funny

00:07:49.073 --> 00:07:52.103
the way they were angry with the society,

00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:57.213
the way they described them.

00:07:59.133 --> 00:08:04.063
Some of them did not look at the society,

00:08:04.093 --> 00:08:06.043
did not denounce the society,

00:08:06.073 --> 00:08:09.093
did not say bad things about the society

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:14.173
but they were only satisfied with themselves

00:08:15.023 --> 00:08:20.093
or they wrote about the blessings that they are having.

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:23.203
But you have a new dimension;

00:08:24.063 --> 00:08:28.183
you have to use your powers

00:08:30.073 --> 00:08:33.163
for the benevolence of the people.

00:08:34.983 --> 00:08:42.063
So also, your Kundalini was awakened so Sahaj;

00:08:45.073 --> 00:08:49.203
it is because of the love and compassion of your Mother.

00:08:51.983 --> 00:08:54.073
So this time, we should say,

00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:57.103
your Kundalini can only be nourished

00:08:57.213 --> 00:09:02.043
if you develop within yourself

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:10.123
the sense of pure love and pure compassion.

00:09:12.103 --> 00:09:16.123
First I've used the word “pure”, that's My name also.

00:09:17.983 --> 00:09:22.073
That means you have to be innocent to begin with.

00:09:22.203 --> 00:09:30.073
If you are not innocent then you have certain problems,

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:32.993
maybe with your lust.

00:09:34.223 --> 00:09:38.043
Maybe your love might be directed

00:09:38.073 --> 00:09:42.073
towards some person, only.

00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:45.133
Kundalini is not like that.

00:09:45.193 --> 00:09:49.133
She rises, She goes to all the chakras,

00:09:49.183 --> 00:09:51.103
She doesn't get involved into any,

00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:54.183
She tries to cure every chakra, nourish that chakra,

00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:58.123
and She is only worried about Her ascent.

00:09:59.163 --> 00:10:02.993
In the same way a Sahaja Yogi

00:10:03.153 --> 00:10:06.083
should not get involved

00:10:06.983 --> 00:10:10.993
into any relationship as such.

00:10:11.993 --> 00:10:14.043
Is possible.

00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:18.043
You don't have to become like Buddha's disciples.

00:10:18.163 --> 00:10:21.083
For example, as I have always told you,

00:10:21.123 --> 00:10:22.193
the sap in the tree rises

00:10:22.993 --> 00:10:25.193
and goes to various parts of the tree

00:10:25.223 --> 00:10:29.013
and then evaporates or comes back.

00:10:30.153 --> 00:10:34.053
So this passage should be kept open,

00:10:36.133 --> 00:10:39.133
and once this passage is kept open

00:10:40.023 --> 00:10:46.073
the Kundalini can rise very easily without any trouble.

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:50.213
But this passage can be closed,

00:10:51.053 --> 00:10:55.023
in case you get too much involved into one thing,

00:10:55.123 --> 00:11:00.083
because there are some people

00:11:03.993 --> 00:11:07.983
who get involved, say in their parents to begin with.

00:11:08.013 --> 00:11:10.073
All right, in the beginning I know,

00:11:10.123 --> 00:11:12.103
those who come in the beginning to Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:12.133 --> 00:11:16.083
will start saying, “Mother, my father's, sister's,

00:11:17.013 --> 00:11:21.073
husband's, this things, that, is sick,

00:11:21.183 --> 00:11:24.993
so will you please cure that person.” Very common.

00:11:25.123 --> 00:11:27.023
They'll write long, long letters

00:11:27.073 --> 00:11:28.123
describing the relationship

00:11:28.153 --> 00:11:33.993
and I really lose the connection - who is this one?

00:11:34.043 --> 00:11:35.133
Without writing the names

00:11:35.163 --> 00:11:37.993
they will give all the connections that they have.

00:11:38.043 --> 00:11:40.183
These are all artificial connections.

00:11:42.053 --> 00:11:45.023
Tomorrow some calamity comes on you,

00:11:45.183 --> 00:11:49.053
these relationships are of no use;

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:52.123
on the contrary you'll find they'll take advantage of it.

00:11:53.183 --> 00:11:56.153
You cannot depend on these relations of yours,

00:11:56.223 --> 00:11:58.153
in what family you were born,

00:11:58.183 --> 00:12:00.053
in what religion you were born,

00:12:00.083 --> 00:12:02.153
in what country you are born,

00:12:03.183 --> 00:12:06.153
because now you are a universal being.

00:12:07.153 --> 00:12:11.193
So you are no more related

00:12:12.163 --> 00:12:15.053
through these artificial relationships

00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:20.183
but you are related through your spiritual relationships.

00:12:22.073 --> 00:12:26.983
Unless and until we establish that within ourselves

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:29.163
- that doesn't mean you give up your husband,

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:31.183
give up your wife, give up your children,

00:12:31.203 --> 00:12:33.213
nothing of the kind;

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:38.983
but that means that if we have to give up our conditionings

00:12:39.123 --> 00:12:42.153
we have to give up all these things.

00:12:45.163 --> 00:12:48.053
There are all kinds of conditionings we have.

00:12:49.213 --> 00:12:52.133
If there are some good conditionings,

00:12:54.043 --> 00:12:55.133
still we should give up

00:12:55.163 --> 00:12:58.133
in the sense they should not be conditionings

00:12:58.193 --> 00:13:00.213
but we should be master of them.

00:13:01.013 --> 00:13:04.043
For example Indians have one good conditioning, in a way,

00:13:04.093 --> 00:13:05.133
in their own country,

00:13:05.163 --> 00:13:08.103
that they must have their bath early in the morning.

00:13:09.123 --> 00:13:11.103
I used to do the same.

00:13:11.163 --> 00:13:14.103
Then England is horrible for that.

00:13:15.053 --> 00:13:18.103
It takes its respite, if you do that in England,

00:13:18.183 --> 00:13:20.153
it's a cursed country,

00:13:20.983 --> 00:13:22.183
you just can't do that.

00:13:22.983 --> 00:13:24.123
You have to take your bath in the night

00:13:24.153 --> 00:13:26.183
otherwise give up bathing;

00:13:28.013 --> 00:13:29.103
and one has to change.

00:13:29.113 --> 00:13:31.033
But if you have that conditioning,

00:13:31.093 --> 00:13:33.093
then you will feel very sad,

00:13:33.123 --> 00:13:35.143
“Oh, oh, I've missed my bath, I'm feeling,

00:13:35.193 --> 00:13:40.053
I can't sleep now, I can't feel all right, I am not normal.”

00:13:40.113 --> 00:13:44.093
It’s a good conditioning but still it is enslaving you.

00:13:45.113 --> 00:13:47.173
So whether it is good or bad,

00:13:47.223 --> 00:13:49.173
if it is a conditioning

00:13:50.093 --> 00:13:54.113
you should try to see it clearly, it's a conditioning.

00:13:57.093 --> 00:13:58.983
That doesn't mean that you should go

00:13:59.013 --> 00:14:00.053
in the opposite direction,

00:14:00.093 --> 00:14:01.993
that, "All right I'll never have my bath",

00:14:02.023 --> 00:14:03.983
that's not the way.

00:14:07.103 --> 00:14:08.993
It is that,

00:14:09.073 --> 00:14:11.993
"All right if it doesn't suit in the morning

00:14:12.043 --> 00:14:13.093
I'll have it in the evening,

00:14:13.133 --> 00:14:15.153
also doesn't matter once in a while I'll miss it.

00:14:15.183 --> 00:14:19.103
The bath cannot control me, I'll control the bath."

00:14:21.043 --> 00:14:22.517
Nothing should control you,

00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:25.093
then the Kundalini moves for us,

00:14:25.153 --> 00:14:28.103
because you must have complete liberty.

00:14:29.053 --> 00:14:31.133
If you do not have complete liberty

00:14:31.213 --> 00:14:33.993
then the Kundalini won't move.

00:14:38.956 --> 00:14:41.380
We have conditionings of our families,

00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:44.993
of our religion,

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:47.716
of our country.

00:14:48.916 --> 00:14:52.836
These conditionings, as far as possible,

00:14:52.906 --> 00:14:57.806
is to be seen clearly that we have got it through our

00:15:00.686 --> 00:15:01.756
family.

00:15:01.806 --> 00:15:03.856
If you are born a Christian

00:15:04.746 --> 00:15:07.696
you'll always be more attached to Christ.

00:15:08.696 --> 00:15:09.806
Christ you have not seen,

00:15:09.836 --> 00:15:11.836
you don't know whether He existed or not,

00:15:11.896 --> 00:15:13.826
whether this Bible is true or not

00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:15.866
but you'll be more attached to Bible.

00:15:16.726 --> 00:15:18.449
Now if you are a Hindu,

00:15:18.568 --> 00:15:22.726
you'll be more attached to Gita or to Vedas or something.

00:15:22.906 --> 00:15:26.696
This creates imbalance,

00:15:27.796 --> 00:15:31.686
because we must have the same attitude

00:15:31.746 --> 00:15:34.866
towards all the religions, towards all the scriptures;

00:15:34.896 --> 00:15:37.826
that's the sign of a saint.

00:15:41.756 --> 00:15:44.756
So this conditioning has to go.

00:15:45.716 --> 00:15:49.826
In what country you are born is another conditioning

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:51.836
which has to be fought out;

00:15:52.686 --> 00:15:54.716
very important it is.

00:15:55.886 --> 00:15:58.686
I don't want to discuss the conditionings

00:15:58.726 --> 00:16:01.726
of different countries but you know very well.

00:16:01.776 --> 00:16:04.716
After Realization when you rise higher

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:06.886
than your society which is surrounding you,

00:16:07.726 --> 00:16:11.756
you start understanding and you start describing.

00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:14.600
I've come to know about the stupidity

00:16:14.806 --> 00:16:16.836
of all these countries through the people

00:16:16.866 --> 00:16:18.836
who belong to that country.

00:16:18.886 --> 00:16:20.836
For example a Frenchman will say,

00:16:20.866 --> 00:16:24.826
“Mother, this is typical French mind,

00:16:25.598 --> 00:16:27.726
he's a French otherwise born.”

00:16:27.836 --> 00:16:29.686
Or a Hindu will say,

00:16:29.746 --> 00:16:32.686
“Mother, this is typically a Hindu man,

00:16:32.716 --> 00:16:33.886
he will do like this.”

00:16:34.796 --> 00:16:37.856
So then you understand that you are not typifying

00:16:37.906 --> 00:16:39.756
that country,

00:16:39.826 --> 00:16:41.716
you are a universal being

00:16:41.776 --> 00:16:44.686
and you are living like a universal being.

00:16:47.776 --> 00:16:49.896
Once you become the universal being

00:16:50.726 --> 00:16:54.886
then also you realize that this skin-deep complexion

00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:57.686
makes no difference in the world.

00:16:58.886 --> 00:17:02.746
So then you don't start hating somebody

00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:06.776
who is darker than you or who is fairer than you;

00:17:06.806 --> 00:17:08.716
both ways it works.

00:17:08.796 --> 00:17:14.578
It's not only the people who are fair hate the darker ones,

00:17:14.603 --> 00:17:16.856
but “darkers” also hate equally.

00:17:17.826 --> 00:17:21.456
And mutually they believe that they are all

00:17:21.756 --> 00:17:23.796
absolutely wrong.

00:17:24.726 --> 00:17:27.806
If you ask a fanatic

00:17:29.746 --> 00:17:32.686
about another religion he'll say,

00:17:32.726 --> 00:17:34.866
that's the worst religion, his is the best.

00:17:35.696 --> 00:17:38.716
And you ask the another fanatic,

00:17:38.796 --> 00:17:43.746
he will say his is the best, the rest of it is the worst.

00:17:43.776 --> 00:17:45.856
That means all of them are the worst,

00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:47.796
in a general opinion.

00:17:47.806 --> 00:17:49.696
Everybody seems to be the worst,

00:17:49.726 --> 00:17:50.866
all the fanatics are the worst,

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.886
if you take a general consensus, you see.

00:17:54.856 --> 00:17:56.691
Nobody will say that,

00:17:56.716 --> 00:17:57.836
"All right, my religion is all right

00:17:57.886 --> 00:18:00.906
and at least one another is all right", nobody.

00:18:03.746 --> 00:18:05.726
If you ask an Englishman he'll say,

00:18:05.746 --> 00:18:09.756
“Mother, this is typically English, you can't help it.”

00:18:10.796 --> 00:18:13.806
They get so angry, I've seen the English getting angry

00:18:13.836 --> 00:18:15.756
with the other English for misbehaving

00:18:15.796 --> 00:18:18.796
or doing something towards Me, but I don't,

00:18:18.826 --> 00:18:20.866
because they are blind.

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:24.811
So here the compassion should come within you,

00:18:24.836 --> 00:18:26.490
as a universal being,

00:18:26.515 --> 00:18:29.866
that by God's grace you have risen higher

00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:31.796
in the real sense of the word.

00:18:31.826 --> 00:18:33.756
It is not just you are certified,

00:18:33.806 --> 00:18:35.716
you are realized souls, no.

00:18:35.806 --> 00:18:41.886
You are realized souls, no doubt, you are - sakshat.

00:18:42.691 --> 00:18:46.861
So then, as it is now, you are absolutely certified by God

00:18:46.886 --> 00:18:48.916
that you are realized souls.

00:18:49.906 --> 00:18:52.856
Naturally you must change everything.

00:18:55.756 --> 00:18:59.756
No use typifying yourself, identifying yourself

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:07.856
with something that is now, you have given up.

00:19:07.906 --> 00:19:10.866
For example, from the egg now you have become the birds.

00:19:11.716 --> 00:19:15.776
Now birds don't identify themselves with the eggs

00:19:15.806 --> 00:19:18.796
and settle down in only one place, they fly.

00:19:18.856 --> 00:19:21.716
Now they have become birds, they are no more eggs.

00:19:21.866 --> 00:19:25.686
In the same way we should accept our position.

00:19:25.856 --> 00:19:30.756
We should accept ourselves as realized souls

00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:33.836
with self-esteem and understanding

00:19:33.886 --> 00:19:36.776
as to what is our purpose of life now;

00:19:36.806 --> 00:19:38.866
it is changed completely, entirely.

00:19:39.856 --> 00:19:42.756
Once you understand the purpose of your life,

00:19:42.806 --> 00:19:45.776
innately, not outside because I am saying,

00:19:45.826 --> 00:19:47.686
or is a mental process,

00:19:47.716 --> 00:19:50.716
but inside you feel responsible.

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:54.826
You have got Realization to spread it all over the world

00:19:54.866 --> 00:19:57.806
and to emancipate the whole world.

00:19:58.756 --> 00:20:00.886
Once you realize this point

00:20:01.796 --> 00:20:04.746
then automatically you take up responsibilities

00:20:04.796 --> 00:20:06.806
and the Kundalini will rise.

00:20:08.686 --> 00:20:10.746
I know of many people who said,

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:13.696
“Mother, we cannot speak, You know we have a stage fright.”

00:20:13.746 --> 00:20:15.856
All right, you just stand up, that's all.

00:20:17.746 --> 00:20:20.866
And they started giving lectures; I had to stop them.

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:25.806
There are many who said that,

00:20:25.836 --> 00:20:28.746
“We cannot write any poems Mother, we are no good,

00:20:28.776 --> 00:20:29.916
we cannot sing.”

00:20:30.766 --> 00:20:33.716
I know of a girl who used to sing so horribly bad

00:20:33.856 --> 00:20:35.776
that people had to tell her that you…

00:20:35.846 --> 00:20:37.776
because she would always go out of tune

00:20:37.806 --> 00:20:39.766
and very loudly she would sing;

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:41.661
then they had to tell her,

00:20:41.686 --> 00:20:42.746
“Now you better keep at the back

00:20:42.796 --> 00:20:44.746
and don't sing now any more.”

00:20:44.856 --> 00:20:48.906
Now she is the one who is sort of leading the group.

00:20:50.686 --> 00:20:53.716
So all these beautiful things start manifesting

00:20:53.766 --> 00:20:56.736
which you should accept that they have come to you,

00:20:57.766 --> 00:21:02.706
and give up all that you call as fear.

00:21:04.856 --> 00:21:07.776
All kinds of fear we have.

00:21:08.686 --> 00:21:12.716
These are all left-sided things as you have seen yesterday,

00:21:12.746 --> 00:21:14.736
left-sided man what he should do.

00:21:15.846 --> 00:21:20.686
But what a left-sided man has to know

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:23.886
that he is now an enlightened soul

00:21:24.856 --> 00:21:29.826
and no one can touch him, leave alone destroy.

00:21:30.776 --> 00:21:33.826
No saint will be destroyed.

00:21:33.896 --> 00:21:36.926
Those who will try to destroy you

00:21:37.726 --> 00:21:41.746
will, in a very interesting manner, will be finished.

00:21:42.696 --> 00:21:44.926
Not destroyed but very interesting manner,

00:21:44.996 --> 00:21:48.746
very jocular manner.

00:21:48.816 --> 00:21:50.776
You'll laugh at

00:21:50.866 --> 00:21:53.926
that and you will enjoy the way things are working out.

00:21:54.776 --> 00:21:56.746
Like there's a saying in Sanskrit,

00:21:56.806 --> 00:21:58.806
“vinashkale viprit budhi,”

00:21:58.856 --> 00:22:01.786
means their destruction will start

00:22:01.836 --> 00:22:04.856
by their own stupid methods.

00:22:05.716 --> 00:22:07.696
They'll become stupid.

00:22:07.816 --> 00:22:10.856
And at every stage you'll see they are becoming stupid

00:22:11.806 --> 00:22:14.806
and by that stupidity they are destroying themselves.

00:22:14.836 --> 00:22:16.806
You don't have to worry about that part.

00:22:16.886 --> 00:22:19.706
So that's why you don't need any destructive powers.

00:22:19.856 --> 00:22:25.696
It will all be done by this all-pervading Divine Power.

00:22:25.916 --> 00:22:28.437
So that part you have to give up.

00:22:28.604 --> 00:22:31.746
You just forgive that person.

00:22:32.896 --> 00:22:34.926
As soon as you forgive,

00:22:36.896 --> 00:22:39.816
the responsibility from you shifts

00:22:41.696 --> 00:22:43.806
and then Kundalini rises.

00:22:44.786 --> 00:22:48.786
You don't have to carry any malice, anything against him,

00:22:48.836 --> 00:22:52.726
but just laugh because they are blind,

00:22:52.896 --> 00:22:54.926
because they are stupid,

00:22:55.726 --> 00:22:56.866
they are foolish.

00:22:58.716 --> 00:23:01.746
What do we do if you see an idiot?

00:23:02.696 --> 00:23:04.816
We may not laugh in his presence but we do,

00:23:04.856 --> 00:23:08.816
isn't it, at his back, because he's an idiot.

00:23:09.856 --> 00:23:12.856
So they become idiotic

00:23:13.786 --> 00:23:17.716
and you see them becoming idiotic and then you just start.

00:23:17.756 --> 00:23:19.517
You see that's the humor of Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:19.542 --> 00:23:21.806
you have to have some humor also, isn't it?

00:23:22.836 --> 00:23:25.746
And then you start seeing these jokers you see,

00:23:25.786 --> 00:23:27.706
behaving in that manner

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:32.836
and the whole circus they do is nothing but jocular.

00:23:33.866 --> 00:23:37.836
So there's nothing to have any fear from any human being;

00:23:38.866 --> 00:23:41.746
same about organizations or anything.

00:23:41.786 --> 00:23:43.886
Naturally you have to know one thing:

00:23:44.746 --> 00:23:46.746
that as you are Realized souls,

00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:48.786
you have seen the truth,

00:23:48.836 --> 00:23:50.866
you are in the light so they are going to oppose you,

00:23:50.896 --> 00:23:52.836
they are going to oppose you.

00:23:54.846 --> 00:23:57.876
They did this, isn't it, to others;

00:23:58.776 --> 00:24:01.836
everybody suffered so much.

00:24:03.866 --> 00:24:06.786
But now no more sufferings to you,

00:24:06.896 --> 00:24:10.846
only thing you can enjoy the humor.

00:24:12.746 --> 00:24:14.836
Just understand this point,

00:24:14.906 --> 00:24:18.826
that nothing will destroy you, no one can touch you

00:24:18.906 --> 00:24:23.766
but they are there just to supply some humor for you.

00:24:24.686 --> 00:24:27.315
If you take such a light attitude towards them,

00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:30.726
all this fear and left side will go away.

00:24:31.916 --> 00:24:35.856
What are these baddhas, and what are these bhoots,

00:24:35.906 --> 00:24:38.806
and what are these tantrikas? Nothing.

00:24:38.866 --> 00:24:40.836
You are so powerful.

00:24:40.906 --> 00:24:42.826
Just with one glance

00:24:42.876 --> 00:24:45.686
you can see them dancing on their heads,

00:24:45.826 --> 00:24:47.766
the other way round.

00:24:48.906 --> 00:24:51.796
As long as you'll have fear

00:24:51.836 --> 00:24:56.716
Kundalini won't rise because She doesn't rise for people

00:24:56.776 --> 00:24:58.746
who are cowards.

00:24:59.696 --> 00:25:01.886
Cowardice She is not going to support.

00:25:02.696 --> 00:25:04.856
If you are a coward She said, “All right”.

00:25:06.796 --> 00:25:08.826
You are walking on the street,

00:25:08.916 --> 00:25:12.806
normally people are afraid if there's darkness,

00:25:12.866 --> 00:25:16.716
afraid that somebody might attack,

00:25:16.826 --> 00:25:18.776
but a Sahaja Yogi does not,

00:25:18.826 --> 00:25:19.836
if he's a real Sahaja Yogi,

00:25:19.886 --> 00:25:22.746
because he knows there are ganas

00:25:22.796 --> 00:25:24.716
and there are angels around him.

00:25:24.746 --> 00:25:26.696
No one can touch him,

00:25:26.836 --> 00:25:28.796
and the one who will try,

00:25:29.696 --> 00:25:32.691
these ganas will make such a fool out of that person

00:25:32.716 --> 00:25:34.806
that you'll have a nice chance to laugh at him.

00:25:36.796 --> 00:25:38.766
Now you watch and see.

00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:44.886
So this left side or this fear should go.

00:25:44.916 --> 00:25:48.686
Once this fear will go all your slyness,

00:25:48.746 --> 00:25:54.886
all your intrigues, all your jealousies will just disappear.

00:25:56.906 --> 00:26:01.696
That's how the Kundalini will rise very well.

00:26:06.726 --> 00:26:13.806
Then another problem is for the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:26:13.856 --> 00:26:15.826
is your ego.

00:26:15.876 --> 00:26:18.726
That's tremendous, I must admit,

00:26:19.686 --> 00:26:22.726
rather too much for people who follow Christ,

00:26:22.766 --> 00:26:26.686
is very surprising and those who follow Buddha,

00:26:27.856 --> 00:26:29.916
because they are anti-Christ,

00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:32.886
because they are anti-Buddha.

00:26:33.796 --> 00:26:36.806
The one who on the cross said that,

00:26:36.856 --> 00:26:37.806
“Oh Father,

00:26:37.856 --> 00:26:41.686
forgive them for they do not know what they are doing”;

00:26:41.776 --> 00:26:45.513
if you are following Him how can you have ego?

00:26:49.916 --> 00:26:58.726
Now the forgiveness should be absolutely spontaneous within.

00:27:03.746 --> 00:27:08.876
There should be no ripple even of anger

00:27:09.686 --> 00:27:11.836
because you are so powerful.

00:27:14.876 --> 00:27:18.776
What can anybody harm you?

00:27:18.886 --> 00:27:20.856
But if you catch on your Agnya,

00:27:20.886 --> 00:27:22.746
only you are harming yourself.

00:27:22.776 --> 00:27:25.776
If you want to harm yourself nobody can help it.

00:27:28.726 --> 00:27:31.876
So this anger, which comes from liver

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:38.766
and settles down in your Agnya, has to be looked into.

00:27:39.776 --> 00:27:42.876
That's a very important thing where Kundalini stops,

00:27:42.906 --> 00:27:44.916
in the West specially.

00:27:47.926 --> 00:27:54.816
Because this whole culture here has created two problems.

00:27:55.906 --> 00:28:01.706
The first one is acquisition instinct,

00:28:03.686 --> 00:28:06.816
what you call as greed.

00:28:07.816 --> 00:28:11.816
The more greed you have the more these machines can run

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:16.826
and you can have industrial development of plastics,

00:28:17.716 --> 00:28:21.746
and then have a conference against ecology.

00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:26.786
In Spain I saw,

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:29.886
I don't know, there must be three, four car factories

00:28:29.926 --> 00:28:32.766
because every car had only one driver

00:28:32.816 --> 00:28:34.856
because it had to be there.

00:28:35.876 --> 00:28:38.796
And so many cars

00:28:39.766 --> 00:28:42.746
that you just don't know how to move.

00:28:42.786 --> 00:28:45.816
For your program also is impossible,

00:28:45.856 --> 00:28:47.816
you must start two hours earlier

00:28:47.856 --> 00:28:49.886
when you can just take fifteen minutes.

00:28:50.856 --> 00:28:54.706
In France is another thing, Paris.

00:28:54.906 --> 00:28:57.736
Paris, if you want to go somewhere

00:28:57.786 --> 00:29:00.816
you should start at four o'clock in the morning,

00:29:01.746 --> 00:29:04.746
otherwise you cannot reach that place.

00:29:06.736 --> 00:29:10.876
Same about Milan and same about Rome.

00:29:11.786 --> 00:29:13.826
The worst is Switzerland,

00:29:14.706 --> 00:29:17.761
I don't know what to say about Switzerland,

00:29:17.786 --> 00:29:21.726
the name itself is rather, very dangerous,

00:29:26.926 --> 00:29:30.876
because they are making all ugly money,

00:29:30.926 --> 00:29:32.756
they are doing all these things,

00:29:32.786 --> 00:29:34.846
I mean every kind of sin they have got

00:29:34.896 --> 00:29:37.836
in the name of acquisition.

00:29:37.916 --> 00:29:41.701
For them nothing like sin, taking somebody's money nicely,

00:29:41.726 --> 00:29:44.756
keeping that there, extracting money from poor countries,

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:46.896
keeping, they don't feel there's anything wrong,

00:29:46.926 --> 00:29:49.696
I mean, they have become immune.

00:29:52.846 --> 00:29:55.836
So this acquisition instinct that we have

00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:57.886
and which has been very much fanned

00:29:57.926 --> 00:30:03.926
and has been made into a big sort of a quality in the West,

00:30:06.756 --> 00:30:10.836
we should try to see it clearly.

00:30:11.836 --> 00:30:15.776
In the olden days in the same European countries

00:30:16.776 --> 00:30:19.806
this was used for creating art,

00:30:20.916 --> 00:30:24.816
for producing artist, for supporting artist.

00:30:25.836 --> 00:30:27.726
Even in our country,

00:30:27.756 --> 00:30:29.886
artists were supported by the kings

00:30:29.926 --> 00:30:33.776
and all the big empires that we had.

00:30:35.866 --> 00:30:38.706
These days there's no question,

00:30:38.746 --> 00:30:41.756
no government is willing to support the artist.

00:30:42.776 --> 00:30:45.836
You know that Mozart was called by the queen herself

00:30:45.926 --> 00:30:47.926
to play before her.

00:30:49.786 --> 00:30:53.706
So the governments were not only looking after

00:30:53.736 --> 00:30:55.696
the collection of taxes

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.671
but they were looking after the artists,

00:30:58.696 --> 00:31:04.816
musicians, painters and people who did creative art.

00:31:06.916 --> 00:31:08.926
Like in France you can see

00:31:09.896 --> 00:31:13.806
how their queen collected beautiful artistic things

00:31:13.846 --> 00:31:15.926
and encouraged artists

00:31:18.706 --> 00:31:20.776
to do artistic work,

00:31:20.816 --> 00:31:22.866
spent her money in that,

00:31:23.836 --> 00:31:27.886
and now, you know that she was killed by people.

00:31:28.786 --> 00:31:32.786
By killing her they have killed the art of France.

00:31:37.866 --> 00:31:41.776
And now the French themselves have become bourgeois,

00:31:41.816 --> 00:31:44.816
those whom they condemned, they have become that.

00:31:46.696 --> 00:31:48.806
So acquisition instinct

00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:57.706
has to be taken to the acquisition of art.

00:32:00.706 --> 00:32:05.696
That also should not be plastic

00:32:05.746 --> 00:32:08.846
otherwise tomorrow we might start buying plastic

00:32:08.886 --> 00:32:10.926
artistic things.

00:32:11.836 --> 00:32:15.866
Genuinely made, hand made things.

00:32:19.696 --> 00:32:23.666
Or the music also which is very deep,

00:32:23.726 --> 00:32:28.816
classical, singing the songs of the Divine;

00:32:28.866 --> 00:32:32.756
not the cheap type music which just makes you mad

00:32:32.786 --> 00:32:38.846
or makes you full of lust and greed.

00:32:40.696 --> 00:32:43.726
So this is one of the problems of your culture

00:32:43.786 --> 00:32:48.916
which gives you this kind of a ego.

00:32:51.746 --> 00:32:58.746
I mean, people if they have say, a Rolls Royce

00:32:59.746 --> 00:33:01.846
then of course nobody can talk to them,

00:33:01.886 --> 00:33:06.756
their brain has blown out of their hats, completely.

00:33:06.806 --> 00:33:09.896
But even the driver of the Rolls Royce

00:33:10.886 --> 00:33:13.746
who doesn't own the Rolls Royce, he drives it,

00:33:13.786 --> 00:33:15.856
his head is off.

00:33:16.816 --> 00:33:19.836
He has a different gait, he walks in a different way,

00:33:19.886 --> 00:33:22.726
he talks in a different way.

00:33:27.726 --> 00:33:32.836
So this acquisition instinct gives you so much of ego.

00:33:33.786 --> 00:33:35.866
I mean, you go to somebody's house,

00:33:36.756 --> 00:33:39.866
like some stupid Indians who are now in England

00:33:41.696 --> 00:33:43.696
I went to their house;

00:33:43.746 --> 00:33:48.701
they're sadarjis - means following the path of Guru Nanaka

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:50.886
where drinking is not allowed.

00:33:51.756 --> 00:33:55.916
So as soon as you rise he shows us a pub in his house.

00:33:56.816 --> 00:34:02.412
“My God,” I said. I went back three, four steps, you see.

00:34:02.816 --> 00:34:06.746
He says, “See my pubu,” as he says,

00:34:06.916 --> 00:34:11.776
and from the pub he takes out a soda thing and shows us how

00:34:11.836 --> 00:34:14.786
it pumps out the soda, just imagine

00:34:17.756 --> 00:34:19.866
and he wouldn't talk, you know.

00:34:20.706 --> 00:34:22.806
And when we said, "We don't drink,"

00:34:22.866 --> 00:34:25.926
he thought we were sinners of the worst type,

00:34:27.726 --> 00:34:29.756
that we don't drink.

00:34:30.806 --> 00:34:34.726
So this acquisition instinct is now ending up

00:34:34.886 --> 00:34:41.706
into something which is very cheap, vulgar and immoral.

00:34:46.856 --> 00:34:49.856
The fondness for showing off

00:34:50.716 --> 00:34:54.906
is so much that you are sometimes shocked,

00:34:55.826 --> 00:34:58.806
the way people try to show off.

00:34:59.736 --> 00:35:02.776
Like a American lady came from America

00:35:03.686 --> 00:35:05.746
and she asked Me, “Mrs. Srivastava,

00:35:05.776 --> 00:35:08.716
how many pubs You have seen in London?”

00:35:09.706 --> 00:35:10.776
I said, “None.”

00:35:10.806 --> 00:35:17.876
“Oh, You are good for nothing, useless, absolutely.

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:22.876
You haven't seen any pub. The best houses in any village,

00:35:22.916 --> 00:35:25.826
any city in England is a pub.”

00:35:26.786 --> 00:35:28.726
I said, “From outside I have seen.”

00:35:28.786 --> 00:35:30.706
All right, just to satisfy;

00:35:30.756 --> 00:35:32.756
I thought she’s artistic.

00:35:33.806 --> 00:35:38.876
“No, no, no, no. Do You know the best pub in London?”

00:35:39.706 --> 00:35:41.846
She gave Me the list, you know.

00:35:43.896 --> 00:35:45.886
I said, “Which one is the best?”

00:35:45.926 --> 00:35:48.806
“There was one called Hermit's Pub.”

00:35:49.786 --> 00:35:51.876
I said: "What is this supposed to be?"

00:35:52.756 --> 00:35:57.726
"You know, the man who was living in this house died

00:35:57.846 --> 00:36:00.756
and nobody knew that he's dead,

00:36:01.786 --> 00:36:06.756
so for months together nobody went in

00:36:06.816 --> 00:36:09.786
and the whole place was filled with that stink,

00:36:10.736 --> 00:36:13.726
and lots of cobwebs were there.

00:36:13.926 --> 00:36:16.886
Then they removed that

00:36:19.786 --> 00:36:21.816
dead body from there,

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:25.698
and the stink is still there and the cobwebs,

00:36:25.726 --> 00:36:27.776
absolutely intact, you know.

00:36:28.756 --> 00:36:31.756
You have to be careful that you don't break them.

00:36:32.756 --> 00:36:37.726
And there, that is the best pub,

00:36:37.776 --> 00:36:40.776
for which you have to pay quite a lot.

00:36:40.926 --> 00:36:42.816
And I have seen that.”

00:36:42.846 --> 00:36:47.846
So proud. So where does it end then?

00:36:48.756 --> 00:36:52.886
This acquisition instinct ends in where?

00:36:54.696 --> 00:36:57.896
In rottening things, in putrefying,

00:36:59.726 --> 00:37:01.806
you may call it fermenting.

00:37:04.926 --> 00:37:07.736
It has to end up

00:37:07.806 --> 00:37:09.846
because the reaction of the ego comes

00:37:09.896 --> 00:37:14.816
and you start enjoying things which are rotten.

00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:16.926
Like cheese of France,

00:37:18.786 --> 00:37:23.776
never eat that, I tell you, you'll burn your finger,

00:37:23.866 --> 00:37:27.836
you will burn your throat and you'll burn your stomach.

00:37:28.866 --> 00:37:31.706
It is very rotten,

00:37:31.866 --> 00:37:34.836
and the more rotten it is the better.

00:37:36.706 --> 00:37:40.786
The wine, the wine is the rotten grape juice,

00:37:40.836 --> 00:37:42.726
absolutely rotten,

00:37:42.756 --> 00:37:43.866
you can't take it,

00:37:43.916 --> 00:37:48.886
it smells, I've seen smells like a rotten cork.

00:37:51.696 --> 00:37:53.816
I asked somebody, “How does it smell?”

00:37:53.866 --> 00:37:55.886
He said, “It's very fine.”

00:37:56.696 --> 00:38:00.736
I said, “Does it smell like rotten cork?”

00:38:00.776 --> 00:38:02.736
“I've never smelt a cork.”

00:38:02.846 --> 00:38:05.896
That's why I said - if he had smelt a rotten cork

00:38:06.696 --> 00:38:08.866
he would never have taken to wine;

00:38:09.756 --> 00:38:12.916
so all things that are rotten.

00:38:13.786 --> 00:38:15.886
You know the discovery of cheese, what had happened,

00:38:15.896 --> 00:38:17.876
how it started, do you know that?

00:38:18.836 --> 00:38:24.696
There was a big snowfall and milk was left in one cave.

00:38:24.846 --> 00:38:28.866
So because of the snowfall everybody forgot about the milk,

00:38:29.696 --> 00:38:34.896
it was left there, then summer time the milk became rotten,

00:38:34.921 --> 00:38:37.836
then it became more rotten, more rotten.

00:38:37.926 --> 00:38:42.706
After twelve years or so, somebody went and saw this there.

00:38:51.776 --> 00:38:54.846
Thank God I have not taken My food today.

00:38:59.696 --> 00:39:03.806
And so they took that milk,

00:39:03.836 --> 00:39:06.726
they called it cheese.

00:39:10.706 --> 00:39:14.806
In India cheez is used in Urdu language specially,

00:39:14.846 --> 00:39:16.886
for something which is,

00:39:17.726 --> 00:39:20.806
something special thing, something very special,

00:39:20.896 --> 00:39:23.806
and also as you know in music they use it

00:39:23.846 --> 00:39:28.926
for some special composition, cheez.

00:39:30.836 --> 00:39:37.756
But here the cheese is the most rotten milk

00:39:38.706 --> 00:39:41.926
which no human beings or animals should eat.

00:39:42.786 --> 00:39:46.756
Worms may, so they gave it to worms,

00:39:46.836 --> 00:39:54.706
and I know in Holland and also in Sweden I think, yah,

00:39:56.916 --> 00:39:59.916
they had cheese with worms

00:40:00.726 --> 00:40:02.816
and they were eating the worms;

00:40:02.886 --> 00:40:06.726
can you beat it, it is true;

00:40:07.736 --> 00:40:09.926
not only the cheese but also the worms.

00:40:11.926 --> 00:40:14.706
I mean see where we have ended up

00:40:14.756 --> 00:40:16.926
into our acquisition instinct.

00:40:19.706 --> 00:40:23.681
The wine has to be hundred year old, certified,

00:40:23.706 --> 00:40:24.846
that's the best.

00:40:27.816 --> 00:40:31.706
Such rotten things we are eating,

00:40:31.746 --> 00:40:34.706
they smell, I tell you, they smell of it.

00:40:34.776 --> 00:40:37.806
That's why, once I was surprised that,

00:40:37.926 --> 00:40:40.846
they go to the bathroom, don't even wash their hands.

00:40:40.926 --> 00:40:43.756
We get such horrible smells, they don't get

00:40:43.786 --> 00:40:45.736
because if you take that cheese

00:40:45.786 --> 00:40:47.896
you cannot smell anything rotten.

00:40:48.876 --> 00:40:50.806
Even if you put them in the gutters

00:40:50.846 --> 00:40:52.671
they won't feel anything rotten

00:40:52.696 --> 00:40:56.706
because it's all that dirty smell, they are used to.

00:40:57.806 --> 00:40:59.806
Is the filth, I mean even if they go to hell

00:40:59.836 --> 00:41:02.736
they won't feel bad because the smell will be the same.

00:41:08.756 --> 00:41:10.896
So where should we put them?

00:41:13.786 --> 00:41:16.726
They are so immune to that dirty smell

00:41:17.806 --> 00:41:20.916
which is absolutely sub-human.

00:41:22.756 --> 00:41:26.806
So this acquisition instinct in any elite society

00:41:26.886 --> 00:41:29.866
- once upon a time French society was regarded as elite

00:41:54.756 --> 00:41:58.551
- so the most elite society was the French society

00:41:58.576 --> 00:42:04.696
was most diplomatic in every way.

00:42:04.826 --> 00:42:08.886
Their food was made with wine, everything was wine,

00:42:09.916 --> 00:42:14.826
and this diplomatic society once upon… ruled the whole

00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:16.906
diplomatic areas.

00:42:19.686 --> 00:42:22.716
But they never realized

00:42:22.886 --> 00:42:29.686
that the whole culture was nothing but eating and drinking.

00:42:30.826 --> 00:42:34.766
Nothing else but eating and drinking.

00:42:36.906 --> 00:42:40.796
And later on maybe little politics started.

00:42:41.836 --> 00:42:44.906
But this eating and drinking

00:42:45.836 --> 00:42:48.696
went to such a limit

00:42:49.726 --> 00:42:53.387
that now they have gone out of diplomatic areas;

00:42:53.412 --> 00:42:57.856
no one wants them because they never think in the right way.

00:42:57.906 --> 00:43:00.776
Any diplomat, French diplomat is anywhere,

00:43:00.836 --> 00:43:03.716
people say, “Is he French?” “Yes.”

00:43:03.796 --> 00:43:05.766
“Then better not call him for this meeting,

00:43:05.806 --> 00:43:10.826
you know, he'll put his own ideas.” They went out.

00:43:11.716 --> 00:43:15.906
So now that eliteness is shifted in America.

00:43:16.806 --> 00:43:19.746
So the most elite are taking to drugs.

00:43:19.776 --> 00:43:21.696
What is it after all?

00:43:21.726 --> 00:43:25.806
Drugs is creation of this acquisition instinct only.

00:43:28.696 --> 00:43:31.866
Why should you blame Colombians or anybody else?

00:43:31.876 --> 00:43:33.686
They are making their money, all right

00:43:33.716 --> 00:43:34.886
as you are all making,

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:37.856
but the one they are feeding is America,

00:43:37.906 --> 00:43:42.796
and America is the main thing now in acquisition instinct.

00:43:42.876 --> 00:43:44.886
And what are they acquiring?

00:43:45.746 --> 00:43:47.796
I have been in that society,

00:43:47.836 --> 00:43:50.686
they only talk of drugs.

00:43:50.696 --> 00:43:51.886
All right,

00:43:52.716 --> 00:43:54.806
drugs they talk not only that

00:43:54.826 --> 00:43:57.716
but it's like a shopping of drugs.

00:43:58.686 --> 00:44:00.746
They all know where you get drugs,

00:44:00.776 --> 00:44:03.766
all these so-called ambassadors and these people,

00:44:03.806 --> 00:44:05.766
and their wives.

00:44:05.836 --> 00:44:08.846
With all their dresses have become simpler now,

00:44:08.856 --> 00:44:11.806
they do not dress up the way formerly

00:44:11.836 --> 00:44:13.916
the ambassadors’ wives used to dress up.

00:44:14.736 --> 00:44:18.876
I will not be surprised if they come in holey pants.

00:44:22.686 --> 00:44:25.686
So this acquisition instinct you can see in the

00:44:25.736 --> 00:44:28.736
elite society has ended up into drugs,

00:44:28.886 --> 00:44:33.746
and if not, into gurus - false gurus.

00:44:33.806 --> 00:44:36.796
Those who got fed up with this went to false gurus

00:44:36.826 --> 00:44:38.796
because they have no discrimination

00:44:38.836 --> 00:44:41.776
to know what is right and what is wrong.

00:44:43.806 --> 00:44:48.766
See, step by step, how it has gone into the rotten state,

00:44:48.806 --> 00:44:51.826
this ego, in the West.

00:44:51.886 --> 00:44:54.696
So this is the first point,

00:44:54.876 --> 00:44:59.706
is the acquisition instinct you have.

00:44:59.796 --> 00:45:02.856
In that then somebody’s wife is good-looking,

00:45:02.906 --> 00:45:06.846
then every man has a right to look at her.

00:45:07.716 --> 00:45:10.846
Or some man is good-looking, maybe anybody’s husband

00:45:10.876 --> 00:45:13.244
– every woman has right to look at him.

00:45:13.269 --> 00:45:15.766
Not look at her own husband but another man,

00:45:15.796 --> 00:45:17.686
what’s the use?

00:45:17.716 --> 00:45:18.846
I’ve never been able to understand,

00:45:18.886 --> 00:45:20.846
“What’s the use of looking at another man

00:45:20.886 --> 00:45:23.696
who is not your husband?”

00:45:26.716 --> 00:45:30.317
This acquisition instinct has gone

00:45:30.696 --> 00:45:35.766
into complete immoral life, immoral society

00:45:35.846 --> 00:45:43.876
and they have lost sense of respect of their age.

00:45:45.716 --> 00:45:49.876
A ninety-year-old woman having a love affair

00:45:49.886 --> 00:45:52.846
with a grandson who is eighteen-year-old;

00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:58.686
just think of that, such stupidity, such nonsense.

00:45:58.856 --> 00:46:02.826
How is it possible unless and until

00:46:02.876 --> 00:46:08.736
we have some sort of a perverted acquisition instinct?

00:46:08.906 --> 00:46:11.826
Even art has gone into perversion,

00:46:11.916 --> 00:46:14.886
everything has gone into perversion

00:46:19.846 --> 00:46:23.856
- because the curse of the Western society is that

00:46:23.886 --> 00:46:26.856
there is no maryada.

00:46:27.876 --> 00:46:31.826
And Kundalini rises in its own maryada,

00:46:32.826 --> 00:46:35.766
it brings back your maryadas,

00:46:35.806 --> 00:46:37.876
it keeps you into your maryadas.

00:46:37.906 --> 00:46:39.826
You are a human being,

00:46:39.876 --> 00:46:42.826
don't live like animals, even worse than animals.

00:46:42.876 --> 00:46:47.686
You have no right to do that.

00:46:47.736 --> 00:46:51.380
God has not created you to be sub-human

00:46:51.428 --> 00:46:53.856
but to be super-human being.

00:46:53.916 --> 00:46:57.856
So, this is how it works out.

00:46:59.876 --> 00:47:02.776
You can now think about it, how far it goes

00:47:02.806 --> 00:47:04.856
this acquisition instinct,

00:47:06.766 --> 00:47:08.776
about things.

00:47:10.796 --> 00:47:13.876
But the second very bad curse

00:47:14.806 --> 00:47:19.686
of the Western acquisition instinct is

00:47:19.716 --> 00:47:24.716
that they want to acquire, aggress, others.

00:47:28.686 --> 00:47:31.806
Aggression, the aggressiveness.

00:47:33.736 --> 00:47:36.846
They think they have a right to aggress other countries,

00:47:36.886 --> 00:47:40.736
I mean they aggressed our country for three hundred years.

00:47:40.766 --> 00:47:43.886
Why? Why did they aggress? We are not bad people.

00:47:44.696 --> 00:47:48.776
Because we had gold, we had diamonds,

00:47:49.766 --> 00:47:52.716
we had pearls,

00:47:52.856 --> 00:47:54.796
we had lots of things

00:47:54.826 --> 00:47:58.766
which were just material things for which they aggressed us,

00:47:58.806 --> 00:48:01.876
and they didn't take any spirituality from India.

00:48:02.766 --> 00:48:04.796
So the French aggressed, these aggressed,

00:48:04.826 --> 00:48:05.876
all the time aggressing.

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:08.886
Japanese are also following you.

00:48:11.776 --> 00:48:14.796
This aggression then moves the whole society

00:48:14.846 --> 00:48:18.696
into a very destructive force.

00:48:18.846 --> 00:48:22.686
You can see every day the wars are going on,

00:48:22.716 --> 00:48:24.696
this is fighting that, that is fighting that,

00:48:24.746 --> 00:48:26.796
they want this, they want that.

00:48:26.856 --> 00:48:29.806
And this aggression has also penetrated

00:48:29.846 --> 00:48:32.746
the developing countries, the third world also.

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:36.846
So, nicely the disease is on.

00:48:40.826 --> 00:48:46.736
But Kundalini kills that acquisition.

00:48:47.736 --> 00:48:50.746
How? By giving you joy.

00:48:52.736 --> 00:48:54.846
You enjoy everything.

00:48:55.776 --> 00:48:58.716
You are sitting in a jungle, you are enjoying,

00:48:58.826 --> 00:49:01.826
here in uncomfortable conditions, you enjoy

00:49:01.876 --> 00:49:05.806
because you seek the comfort of your spirit,

00:49:05.846 --> 00:49:07.681
because that gives you joy

00:49:07.706 --> 00:49:10.796
- ultimately that's what you get out of everything.

00:49:10.906 --> 00:49:13.886
You think you get joy by acquisition; you do not.

00:49:16.686 --> 00:49:19.916
But through Kundalini awakening you get that joy,

00:49:20.736 --> 00:49:24.826
and in that joy you don't want anything,

00:49:26.736 --> 00:49:27.826
you don't ask for anything;

00:49:27.876 --> 00:49:29.776
you just enjoy yourself;

00:49:29.806 --> 00:49:32.796
you are the property of enjoyment.

00:49:33.876 --> 00:49:36.916
Sanskrit they say,  “Atmanyeva atmane ahrushta”

00:49:37.766 --> 00:49:41.826
- “The Spirit is satisfied by its own spirit.”

00:49:45.766 --> 00:49:49.796
So into small things you must see joy,

00:49:50.776 --> 00:49:55.776
and you must watch it, the whole universe, with that thing.

00:49:56.696 --> 00:49:58.706
I mean when I am traveling I'll ask,

00:49:58.736 --> 00:49:59.816
“What is this tree?”

00:49:59.846 --> 00:50:00.896
“Mother, we don't know.”

00:50:00.916 --> 00:50:02.876
“Well, you lived here for so many years, you don't know?”

00:50:02.896 --> 00:50:04.896
“No Mother, we don't know much about trees.”

00:50:04.926 --> 00:50:06.726
I say, “What are these flowers?”

00:50:06.756 --> 00:50:07.806
“We don't know.”

00:50:08.726 --> 00:50:10.756
I mean what are you doing, what have you been doing,

00:50:10.776 --> 00:50:11.756
you don't know what are the trees,

00:50:11.786 --> 00:50:12.896
every day you watch them;

00:50:12.926 --> 00:50:15.806
you don't know what is the tree is?

00:50:18.816 --> 00:50:21.746
But if you ask them, “Where do you get this wine?”

00:50:21.786 --> 00:50:22.896
they will know.

00:50:22.896 --> 00:50:24.716
“Mother, this is the place

00:50:24.756 --> 00:50:26.706
where they produced the best wines.”

00:50:26.716 --> 00:50:27.866
“All right, I'll see to it.”

00:50:27.906 --> 00:50:31.796
And next year they had no fermentation.

00:50:36.816 --> 00:50:41.681
So, this is the acquisition instinct which is very,

00:50:41.706 --> 00:50:45.650
sort of a, which becomes a political asset

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:46.896
that you go and aggress other countries,

00:50:46.926 --> 00:50:51.786
aggress other people and use all kinds of things;

00:50:54.766 --> 00:50:57.826
and that really is killing.

00:50:59.686 --> 00:51:02.756
So the whole attitude of human beings changes,

00:51:02.796 --> 00:51:04.206
they think we are the Lord,

00:51:04.365 --> 00:51:05.796
we can hate anyone,

00:51:05.866 --> 00:51:07.706
we can aggress anyone,

00:51:07.736 --> 00:51:08.876
we could be arrogant with anyone,

00:51:08.926 --> 00:51:12.706
we can demand anything, we can take away anybody's wife,

00:51:12.756 --> 00:51:15.349
take away anybody's child, take away anything,

00:51:15.374 --> 00:51:17.686
we can kill our children.

00:51:18.836 --> 00:51:23.816
As a result the love is lost;

00:51:23.896 --> 00:51:26.896
no question of compassion.

00:51:27.736 --> 00:51:30.846
Love is lost, compassion is lost; no love.

00:51:33.896 --> 00:51:37.796
And with that you also developed “my” and “mine”,

00:51:37.816 --> 00:51:39.816
sense of “my and mine”

00:51:40.846 --> 00:51:43.726
- is that this is my child,

00:51:44.706 --> 00:51:46.726
this is my country,

00:51:47.686 --> 00:51:51.836
this is... As you know in Yugoslavia what they are doing.

00:51:51.866 --> 00:51:55.926
I don't know who gave the name of Yugo, Yugo means Yoga.

00:51:56.736 --> 00:52:00.796
This is the Yoga people, fighting among themselves.

00:52:00.896 --> 00:52:05.846
This has come from the same root that,

00:52:05.876 --> 00:52:07.836
“This is mine, this is my country”.

00:52:07.866 --> 00:52:10.706
Why? How is it your country?

00:52:10.766 --> 00:52:13.786
You can't create one leaf, so who are you?

00:52:13.816 --> 00:52:17.926
You can't create little mud, can you?

00:52:19.926 --> 00:52:23.776
How do you say, “This is my country?” How dare?

00:52:23.786 --> 00:52:25.896
This all belongs to God.

00:52:26.716 --> 00:52:29.836
He has created, or you can say Adi Shakti has created.

00:52:30.746 --> 00:52:32.886
You have not created even so much;

00:52:32.926 --> 00:52:36.756
how do you say, “This is mine and I should have it?”

00:52:36.826 --> 00:52:41.916
So the “my” and “mine” thing also develops, very strong.

00:52:42.746 --> 00:52:45.716
And the same thing happens with, sometimes, Sahaja Yogis,

00:52:45.756 --> 00:52:50.756
very much. “My children”, this is the first curse.

00:52:52.756 --> 00:52:58.716
“These are my children, my wife, my family”,

00:52:59.826 --> 00:53:02.726
it starts growing like that.

00:53:04.746 --> 00:53:07.886
Then the heart shrinks.

00:53:08.866 --> 00:53:13.158
For a large-hearted man the whole world is the universe,

00:53:13.428 --> 00:53:16.836
the whole thing is within,

00:53:16.866 --> 00:53:19.686
the whole thing is yours.

00:53:21.876 --> 00:53:26.846
When such a heart you experience within yourself

00:53:26.896 --> 00:53:29.190
then Kundalini just shoots off because,

00:53:29.269 --> 00:53:31.916
as you know, the Sahasrara is the Heart Chakra.

00:53:32.896 --> 00:53:35.876
No question of Sahasrara catching

00:53:36.756 --> 00:53:38.806
if you have a large heart.

00:53:39.736 --> 00:53:41.916
And to keep the Sahasrara open

00:53:42.726 --> 00:53:47.706
- is just develop that sense, that wisdom,

00:53:47.756 --> 00:53:50.786
that: "Nobody's mine, everybody belongs to God.

00:53:50.816 --> 00:53:52.816
Who is mine?

00:53:54.736 --> 00:53:56.846
Whatever God wants, let Him do."

00:53:56.916 --> 00:54:00.836
So get out of this small feeling.

00:54:00.866 --> 00:54:04.706
Sahaja Yogis do, I must say, I have seen it.

00:54:04.766 --> 00:54:07.846
They get confined to their families.

00:54:09.756 --> 00:54:11.706
“My son hasn't got Realization,

00:54:11.756 --> 00:54:13.836
my brother hasn't got Realization, my this thing.”

00:54:14.866 --> 00:54:18.726
After that it moves, when they get Realization,

00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:21.726
“This is my son, my brother, my sister, this thing.”

00:54:21.766 --> 00:54:25.706
This “my” has to drop, which is very, very subtle thing,

00:54:25.736 --> 00:54:27.846
and that's why the Sahasrara catches.

00:54:28.816 --> 00:54:31.726
Everyone is yours

00:54:33.856 --> 00:54:41.916
because the Kundalini of Sahaja Yogis is made of love,

00:54:43.776 --> 00:54:45.776
pure love.

00:54:45.916 --> 00:54:50.696
The pure love has only pure desire, is to love,

00:54:50.836 --> 00:54:53.866
love everyone equally.

00:54:55.746 --> 00:54:56.866
When you say it is difficult

00:54:56.896 --> 00:54:59.696
that means you are not trying Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:01.866
Enlarge your heart;

00:55:01.916 --> 00:55:03.896
you'll never feel lost.

00:55:04.716 --> 00:55:08.886
To Me, when I was leaving England I was really, little bit,

00:55:08.926 --> 00:55:13.726
I mean happens like that, like a moon sucks in the sea,

00:55:13.776 --> 00:55:17.756
you see, I felt My heart was just pulled out,

00:55:17.896 --> 00:55:23.726
but I reach here, again I see My children waiting for Me,

00:55:24.746 --> 00:55:26.866
so it's over, finished.

00:55:27.696 --> 00:55:30.866
It's there I felt, now here I feel

00:55:31.816 --> 00:55:37.746
that pull of My heart was released.

00:55:39.746 --> 00:55:43.726
You are also My children here and they are also My children.

00:55:43.776 --> 00:55:45.866
For a Mother like this, how can I say,

00:55:45.916 --> 00:55:48.836
“Oh, say this is Mine, this is Mine?”

00:55:50.776 --> 00:55:55.866
So like this, try to break away from this conditioning.

00:55:55.896 --> 00:55:58.866
First, in the West people don't care for family;

00:55:58.896 --> 00:56:01.836
they'll divorce ten times and advertise it,

00:56:01.866 --> 00:56:04.756
“I am tenth time divorced lady."

00:56:05.696 --> 00:56:08.866
Now they don't divorce but so get attached

00:56:09.916 --> 00:56:12.856
with their family, with their husbands;

00:56:12.896 --> 00:56:15.776
like glue I tell you, like glue.

00:56:16.756 --> 00:56:17.866
Sometimes I start wondering,

00:56:17.916 --> 00:56:21.726
“What have I done to make them like this?”

00:56:22.896 --> 00:56:26.776
So now it is important to see these points,

00:56:26.826 --> 00:56:31.896
and ultimately the heart is the Sahasrara,

00:56:32.696 --> 00:56:33.916
or you can call the Brahmarandra,

00:56:34.716 --> 00:56:37.786
then we have to come to heart.

00:56:37.836 --> 00:56:41.786
Do not reason out, do not argue it out,

00:56:42.696 --> 00:56:46.746
don't work it out mentally from books or anywhere,

00:56:46.786 --> 00:56:48.696
but through your heart,

00:56:48.746 --> 00:56:49.786
if you work it out,

00:56:49.826 --> 00:56:53.826
you'll understand that nothing is more important

00:56:54.776 --> 00:56:57.716
than to love someone.

00:56:58.696 --> 00:57:03.856
And the highest thing is to love everyone equally.

00:57:04.696 --> 00:57:07.776
Of course in love you might have to say something

00:57:07.826 --> 00:57:09.756
to a person.

00:57:10.696 --> 00:57:13.529
The other day I had to say something to some Sahaja Yogini,

00:57:13.756 --> 00:57:14.706
so My husband said,

00:57:14.756 --> 00:57:16.465
“Don't say, she'll become Your enemy.”

00:57:16.696 --> 00:57:18.671
I said, “Let her become My enemy, it doesn't matter.

00:57:18.696 --> 00:57:21.726
It's My duty to tell her that this is wrong,

00:57:21.876 --> 00:57:26.741
otherwise I become her enemy because I don't… told her

00:57:26.766 --> 00:57:28.816
the truth and she will suffer.”

00:57:31.796 --> 00:57:34.816
So this is what it gives you discretion;

00:57:34.906 --> 00:57:38.756
and love is truth.

00:57:39.836 --> 00:57:42.706
So to this Kundalini,

00:57:42.796 --> 00:57:48.766
which is nothing but, is the river,

00:57:48.846 --> 00:57:51.766
as yesterday they described nirvaj,

00:57:52.796 --> 00:57:56.876
which doesn't accept any compensation.

00:57:57.706 --> 00:58:00.896
The river of that pure love

00:58:01.726 --> 00:58:03.786
which has awakened us with such love,

00:58:03.836 --> 00:58:05.816
kindness and tenderness,

00:58:05.866 --> 00:58:11.736
we should try to use that power within ourselves

00:58:11.796 --> 00:58:14.846
to be like that because our job is,

00:58:14.906 --> 00:58:17.756
She has given us Realization

00:58:17.816 --> 00:58:20.896
for the emancipation of the whole world,

00:58:20.926 --> 00:58:22.786
not only our own.

00:58:22.836 --> 00:58:26.786
So everyone has to give Realization to others

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:29.816
otherwise their Kundalini will settle back.

00:58:30.766 --> 00:58:34.826
Talk about Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is not part time,

00:58:35.736 --> 00:58:38.816
it is not a side issue, it should be always with you.

00:58:38.806 --> 00:58:40.796
Wherever you get a chance you have to talk

00:58:40.826 --> 00:58:42.806
about Sahaja Yoga, you have to work it out,

00:58:42.856 --> 00:58:46.856
you have to give Realization, otherwise no use.

00:58:47.916 --> 00:58:50.776
May God bless you all.
