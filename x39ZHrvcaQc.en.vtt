00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.919
Advice, “Introspection and Meditation”. Shudy Camps (UK), 18 June 1988.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.260
This year we won’t be having I think,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.820
public programs in UK,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.580
because also there are certain circumstances.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.060
But whenever there is a circumstance

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.420
which, somehow or other, changes our programs,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.060
we must immediately know

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.700
that there is a purpose behind all that change,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.260
and we must immediately accept it

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.500
with an open heart – that Divine wants us to change.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.740
Supposing I am going on a road

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.980
and people say, “You are lost your way Mother.”

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.140
That’s all right. I am never lost, because I am with Myself!

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.180
But I had to go by that particular road, is the point.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.820
I had to do it, and that’s why I have…supposed to be,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.820
not on that road and I have lost My way.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:58.900
If you have that kind of a understanding,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.620
and if you have that satisfaction in your heart,

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.020
then you’ll find life is worth much more than what you think it to be.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:17.140
Now, as it is, what was the reason, I thought,

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:24.540
that we have decided to have public programs

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.820
this year definitely, and we could not have public programs?

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.060
So the reason is that we have to consolidate.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:44.020
In the growth of a tree, which is a living tree,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:55.660
it happens that it moves in a particular direction up to a point,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.940
till it has to change,

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.500
because there is no sun coming that side,

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:09.660
maybe there is no water levels arriving,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.620
so they start changing.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.140
In the same way, one has to understand that,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.740
we are in the hands of the Divine,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.980
and if some plans are changed,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:27.220
it is reflecting back on us, and we have to see why.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.500
And the why of it is that we have to consolidate.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.020
Consolidation of sahaja yogis is very important.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:45.060
The first thing to consolidate yourself, you must do introspection.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:51.420
You must do introspection, is to reflect the light within

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.020
and see for yourself:

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.300
what have you done so far in Sahaja Yoga?

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.780
Where were you, How far you have gone,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.420
and how far have you to go.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.420
What is the thing that is lacking in you?

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.460
You’ll be surprised when you start seeing yourself,

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.260
in a very unbiased manner, not justifying yourself

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.300
not blaming any bhoots,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:28.940
or need not blame any badhas within you, or somebody else.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.700
If you start yourself [seeing] what has gone wrong with you

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.220
that you could not consolidate yourself properly,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.820
you’ll be amazed that there has been problems

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.860
still lingering on which must be corrected.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.900
Now these problems you can see very clearly.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.340
In the light of the Spirit you can see them very clearly

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.740
that, “This has gone wrong with me.”

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.020
One of the most interesting things I’ve noticed is that

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:08.140
Sahaja Yoga is all the time covered with some sort of a maya.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.620
And this maya is ignorance, complete ignorance sometimes,

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.140
sometimes partially.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.380
Now when you get into Sahaja Yoga you get blessed.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.780
You get blessed maybe,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.900
your family gets blessed, your children get blessed.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.660
You get some sort of a blessing for your physical being.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:42.780
Also for financial [side], you get jobs, you get money,

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:48.940
you get something exceptional, which is really miraculous.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:55.020
Now people get very much lost in those achievements

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.980
and start drifting, thinking that,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.620
“Oh, this is the blessing we have got now.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.660
We don’t have to do anything anymore,”

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.900
that you are being rewarded sufficiently

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.620
for whatever you have done so far. That’s not so!

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:16.900
Is just a sort of a support to you comes

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:22.500
so that your faith should be fully established in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:27.140
And specially, you should know Me, what I am.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:34.580
But, if you go on still drifting,

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:40.420
then maybe some of these blessings may turn out to be curses,

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:45.140
and you might feel that what a curse it has fallen upon us

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.340
and how it has gone in the wrong way.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.340
For some people it takes time to feel,

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.060
to get to the feel of the blessings.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.780
For example, mostly, according to the modern ideas,

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.540
we think that to get more money is the biggest blessing.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.620
So, so many get that also.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.820
But actually, it is not.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.700
To get your peace within,

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.100
to get to your witness state,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.980
and to feel your vibrations all right,

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.020
and to be in the center, all the time ascending,

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.980
is the real blessing.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.980
Because with that, you get everything else.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.420
The completion is only possible

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:39.820
when you have the complete joy bubbling within yourself.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:47.540
After all, everything is just a means to achieve joy,

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.860
to feel the joy.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.500
It is not the end.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.060
If it was, those people who have money,

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.140
those people who have good health,

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.700
those people who have all the success, so-called, with them,

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.380
they should have had been happy and peaceful,

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.780
but they are not, they are suffering,

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:18.580
they are suffering too much, and they are, in a way,

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.900
destroying themselves, day by day,

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.260
because they hate their lives, they can’t bear it.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.940
They cannot understand why they are on this Earth.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.860
So all these blessings that come to you,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.740
all these changes that come to you,

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.860
all these new venues that open to you,

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:49.500
one has to know that it is for your benevolence,

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.580
everything for your benevolence,

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.740
and your benevolence is your ascent,

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.780
nothing else but your ascent.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:04.740
The rest of it is all useless and fruitless.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.660
Once you understand that this is

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.980
what you have to achieve in life,

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.500
that is what you have to enjoy, then it works out.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.540
But in Sahaja Yoga as you see, it’s compassion and love.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.620
It is not so much restrictions.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.700
You are left to yourself to develop yourself.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.500
Is your Spirit which has to guide you.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:35.140
There’s no coaxing or correction going on all the time.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:41.220
But it is left to you to understand yourself,

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.900
to see for yourself, and work it out.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.860
But one of the criteria should be

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:52.780
that “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:57.060
Now what have I done for Mother?”

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.700
These two things are very important to understand.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.060
Whatever small thing I could do for Sahaja Yoga

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.500
is important because

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.340
if you are intelligent, you can see

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.740
that this is the greatest thing you have to do

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.140
is to work for God.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.060
This is the most important thing so far

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.740
human beings have indulged into,

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.500
is the highest type of enterprise

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:39.380
that human beings have ever had a chance to indulge into

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.460
and what a chance it is too!

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.660
You may say that, “Mother we are mediocres,

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.340
we are no good, we are useless,”

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.820
but you are chosen.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.820
You are the one chosen so there must be something about you.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.140
You might not have seen that part within yourself

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:04.500
which is going to work out this great work of God.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.580
So you have to locate and find out:

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.500
“Why am I selected for Sahaja Yoga?

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.500
What can I do in Sahaja Yoga?

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.500
What can I work it out in Sahaja Yoga?”

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:22.260
This should be a constant reminder to you that,

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.740
“I have been chosen for Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.780
I want to take full advantage of Sahaja Yoga.”

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.980
Supposing somebody doesn’t have money,

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.980
he expects that Sahaja Yoga should give money,

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.980
must give jobs, must give this, must give that,

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.340
must have children, must give good health,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.500
all that. Expectations are all right.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:45.380
But “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.980
This is another point of introspection.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:55.500
Very important to see that

00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.100
we have to do something for Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.740
It’s not money, it’s not work,

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:08.900
it’s not thinking, it’s not any kind of a support.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.180
But one of them, the most important thing is,

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.500
how many people you have given realization to?

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.540
You have to count.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.100
How many people you have been able to give realization to,

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.420
how many people you have talked about Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.340
You may think that you give realization to some people,

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.060
they come, they disappear – doesn’t matter.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.260
They will ultimately come to you.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.820
Today you try on some, they’ll be lost.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:51.060
Again tomorrow. You have to relentlessly work for it.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.900
As you know I’ve worked very hard in UK.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:58.420
My coming to UK itself was all predetermined.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.980
There was a need for Me to come here,

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.140
to make the heart work better.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.860
But heart is lethargic, you know that,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:15.100
and lethargic heart gets all kinds of problems.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.620
But all these years I have been working,

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.060
every year, whatever time I could give for sahaja yogis,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.780
for their problems, for Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.900
for their minutest problem,

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.100
for any kind of help they needed,

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.660
every sort, I have tried to work it out.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:39.260
Directly, indirectly, you are all blessed.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.980
Still, what about you people who are now yogis?

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.700
You are saints.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.460
You must see a photograph that I have,

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:53.100
very interesting photograph, where you are all certified saints!

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.260
Have you seen that photograph?

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.420
Not yet? You better see it, let’s have it!

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.140
The photograph is in My box, I think, yes.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.260
You are all certified saints!

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:12.260
By the Divine, not by any cardinal or by any pope.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.420
So what are all these saints doing?

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.980
One saint which is certified by pope,

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.620
who is artificially certified,

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.100
is such a big thing, you know.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.980
What about you, who have been certified by God Almighty?

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.820
You are still busy with your work,

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.140
you are still busy with your little, little things,

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:44.820
you are still busy with your small lives and small families.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.820
For a saint, it’s said in Sanskrit,

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.060
“Udara charitanam vasudhaiva kutumbakam,”

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.140
for a person who is of a generous nature,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.860
means a person who is a saint,

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.860
the whole world is his own family.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.860
Are you still only worried about your own family?

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.660
Then you are not yet aware of your saintliness.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.820
And a saint doesn’t only worry about his own wife,

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.500
about his own child, about his own house,

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.300
he worries about the whole world.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.900
Now, as sahaja yogi, you are a powerful entity.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.300
You are very powerful people.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.980
We have got problems in the whole world. You know that very well.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.620
It’s not necessary you have to be great intellectuals,

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.220
or you have to be people who are

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.980
some sort of politicians, or something.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.340
But you must be on the lookout for the problems

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:57.140
which are troubling this world. You have to be.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.660
You cannot live in your own world, that you are a saint,

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.220
“Now I am in Niranand!” that’s not possible.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.660
You can’t just be in Niranand.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.580
You have to know that you have to live in this world,

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.660
and you have to know all the problems of this world.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.340
And you have to think about them,

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.060
not only your problems that, “Mother

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.580
how will I be able to do this and how will I be able to do that?”

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.300
But you have to worry about the whole world.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.340
You have to think, what’s happening in the world,

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.660
what are the problems of the world.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.660
You are responsible for that.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.900
Not only that, but you have to pray.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.500
In your prayers you have to say, “Mother solve this problem.”

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.660
Collectively, individually, you have to take your attention

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.740
from yourself, from your smaller life,

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.460
to a much wider thing – then you are a saint.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:59.420
And you have to think that it is your duty to ask for Divine help,

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.420
that all these problems should be solved.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.020
This is your job for which you are selected.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.420
Your asking is going to work out

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.700
because as you know, I am desire-less.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.980
You have to desire for it. Whatever you desire will work out.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:23.780
The protection, the affection, the compassion

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.900
of Mother is with you.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.740
But you have to look after this world

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.500
and show the concern that you have,

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.740
not to live with a very limited areas,

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.260
and with a very limited ways.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.340
Like now the British think, British are here, all right.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.380
“UK problems are our problems.” No

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.540
Your problems extend to

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.740
all the places wherever there is Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.820
And you have to worry about all of them.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.660
Now we are having, say, problems in Australia.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.500
And there’s somebody who is very troublesome.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:03.620
So, you have to see to it that

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:08.140
you beat that person with shoes and put that right.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.980
Your leader has to tell whom to beat with the shoes.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.940
And work it out, whether it is in Australia,

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.180
whether it is in America, whether it is in India,

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.420
anywhere you see that there’s a problem on Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.980
there’s an assault on Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.060
all of you should put your attention to it and work it out.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.660
Then there are general problems as you see.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.140
You see, we see that America is now becoming idiotic,

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.140
or whatever you may say,

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.820
so you have to put your attention to America.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.740
You have to stretch your attention outside,

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.260
not inside

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.180
just worried about yourself, about your family,

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.780
about your house, about your children.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.860
As soon as you spread your attention outside,

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.740
your problems are solved in the house,

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.140
in the smaller circle they are solved.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.260
You have to pay attention outside!

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.340
Now these days there are televisions,

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.180
where, first, we had said, “Don’t see any televisions!“,

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.780
because there was no use seeing television by sahaja yogis.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.420
When they saw the television they only got caught up.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.900
But now there are important things that are happening

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.940
which you can see for yourself. You can scan it out,

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.940
what are the world problems, and you can see for yourself

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.220
where you have to put your attention.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.860
You should become aware of your personality,

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.500
it’s not a personality that can be

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:45.660
completely involved into a very small area.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.500
Your personality, is such [that it] should get involved

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.340
into all the problems of the universe,

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.580
all the problems there are.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.260
And you’ll be amazed that everything can work out

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.740
in a very collective way.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.660
And at this stage, when you are, you can see for yourself now,

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.740
all the sahaja yogis have got vibrations on top of their heads.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.260
Would you like to have a look, all of you?

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:15.820
Just see! All of you, sitting in Ganapatipule.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.060
So stretch out your vibrations. Stretch out your attentions.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.500
And you’ll be amazed that

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.860
all other stupid problems that you have will be finished.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.140
Now have a look. Let the children see first of all.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:37.500
Just see. You all have vibrations on top of your head.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:02.740
Let them grow, I tell you, I’m just waiting for them to grow!

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:13.740
So the attitude toward ourselves should be

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.900
to be aware of our own glory, of our own position,

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.180
to know that we are saints,

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.740
that we have reached a stage where we are at the highest,

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.500
and that, now, we have become the light

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.820
and we have to give light to others.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.860
If you see, in the Bible, Christ has said something,

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.500
which is very important, that you
don’t put the light under the table.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:50.900
That’s what it is. You have to put the light on a pedestal.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.900
And that’s what it is that

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:57.900
you have to put your light on the citadel,

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.500
at a very highest point to give light to others.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.060
And this is working both ways

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.940
if you start understanding what you are,

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.340
what you have to be aware of, what is your situation,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:18.300
what is your powers, what you have achieved in Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:26.340
what is the debt you have towards Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.660
and what you have to give for Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.860
How Sahaja Yoga has made you so capable,

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.460
so good, so nice.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.900
Are you righteous enough? Are you behaving properly?

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.820
Are you doing all the rightful things,

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.620
which are necessary?

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:49.740
Because it is only you who can do it.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:55.580
You are the people with a very very special energies

00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:01.420
and special contacts with the spiritual life,

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.900
and if you start behaving like all other mundane, nonsensical people,

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.140
limiting yourself to your family, your children,

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:14.540
your nonsensical previous lives,

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.020
you’ll be lost.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.300
Lost to yourself and lost to everyone.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.460
The problems are much more than what you know about.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:31.420
That is the understanding you have to reach,

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.140
that Mother has made us yogis.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.980
We are saints.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.740
And we have to show to the world the right path.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.500
She has told us that we are the light

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.500
and we have to show to people which way to go,

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.060
how to go further.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.060
Instead of that everybody seems to be a problem,

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.980
seems to be in a very small little whirlpool,

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.260
going round and round and round.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.580
How can that be?

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.260
I’ve told you many a times, look at these false gurus.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.660
They have no vibrations, they don’t know anything

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.180
about Kundalini, nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.420
But how much they are doing!

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.860
While what are we doing?

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.900
We’re struggling still with ourselves and with our problems,

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.500
with our own ideas, with our very small-mindedness

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.500
and chicken-heartedness.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.620
Now it is for you to understand.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.220
It is for you to decide about yourself.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:40.900
It is your own desire, it is your own bigness,

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.300
your own magnanimity, which has to come forward.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.060
To see for yourself what you are capable of,

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.740
what you can do.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.700
It’s very easy for people to say that,

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.900
“Oh Mother, it’s too much. I can’t do anything about it.”

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.540
Or somebody to say that, “Mother, I’m busy with my family.”

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.780
Or somebody to say, “I’m busy with my children.”

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.860
You have come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:09.140
I have given you realization for that?

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.580
All these blessings have come to you for that?

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.420
So the consolidation that you have to do is very important.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.340
You can see it clearly that’s why

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.420
we could not have any public programs,

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:27.300
because we really need consolidation in UK.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.460
Though I have lived in UK for so many years,

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.460
people take me for granted here.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.940
Because I am here, because I am staying here,

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.660
they think if we go to the airport, finished!

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.580
We have done all the haj, everything.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.660
“We’ve been to the airport; we’ve seen Mother, finished!”

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.660
What’s the use of seeing Me?

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.140
What have I given you?

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.260
Is your light spreading?

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.980
How many people have got realization from you?

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.580
Just find out, how many people

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.580
have learned Sahaja Yoga from you,

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.300
or from your lives, or from your wisdom,

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.820
or from your behavior?

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.940
That is the way, that is the criteria.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.140
It’s not that

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.660
“All right, I have sent Mother Her money for Her travel.”

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.060
That’s not sufficient.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:21.100
At My age, from India, if you see any lady at My age,

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.700
she walks with a stick, she can’t climb even one step

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.900
Indian women can’t, because of the heat that they have suffered.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.580
But I’m traveling, you know how I’m traveling,

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:37.780
how much I am doing. What about My family?

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:42.420
I deprive them of My company, I deprive My husband of My company,

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.500
everybody is just without Me.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.140
I am traveling traveling every day,

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.980
you know that very well, and I’m working so very hard.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.540
Sometimes I sleep at two o’clock, sometimes at three o’clock.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.340
This time Harsh was with Me,

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.740
and I saw him, he was fagged out!

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.900
So I was saying you people do only relay race.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.780
I am in Australia, all right, Australians are working.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.180
Then I’m in Austria, then Austrians are working,

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.260
then they are having a nice time there!

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.860
I’m in UK, all right, little bit in UK, little work done.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.380
Then they all sit down nicely, enjoy.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:28.700
What about Me? I am having a marathon!

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.740
In the same way you have to feel,

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.740
after all, what is My gain in it?

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.140
What do I gain out of it?

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.260
I gain something:

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:48.140
I have brought My children back to normal conditions,

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:53.420
I have taken them to the Kingdom of God.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.060
You have to do the same.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.580
You have to take them to the Kingdom of God.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.340
But if you, yourself, are involved into your own mayas,

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.660
you’ll be everyday going down and down and down and down.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:10.060
I may shout, I may say anything, it will not go into your heads,

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.260
it will never click with you.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.740
You’ll be all stranded wherever you are,

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.260
because you don’t want to see.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.580
For that I would say, you have one advantage,

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.740
especially in UK. You are all very intelligent people.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.180
You have intelligence, no doubt,

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.140
you are not idiots like Americans.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.060
You are intelligent.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.260
This intelligence became cunningness once upon a time,

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.660
and now you are tired of your cunning.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.900
Indians have learned the cunning from you,

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.860
they have become really very cunning.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.900
But you are tired of your cunningness,

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:53.900
so now you are tired, fed up, fagged out, and lethargic.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.900
But with your intelligence you can understand

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.260
that this is such an important work our Mother is doing.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.580
You’ll go down in the history!

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.820
Every word you say, everything you say,

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.340
every way you behave,

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.260
everything is going to go down in the history!

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.420
Not how many children you produced,

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.100
or what sort of a wife you have,

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.540
but what you did for Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:18.980
Remember that.

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.580
History is going to record everything,

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:22.980
whatever you have done

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:27.780
and whatever you have achieved in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.980
It’s not showing off.

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:37.580
It’s not just a demonstration.

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.340
It’s not talking big.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.980
It’s nothing of the kind.

00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:48.580
It’s actually, really, totally what you have achieved,

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.340
is the point, will be recorded.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:59.180
At least God knows hypocrisy, and God knows bombastic temperaments.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.100
It’s God who knows where you are,

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.980
and what you are up to.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:09.180
You cannot befool God, one thing you must realize.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:13.580
But when you are befooling God, you are befooling your Self,

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:18.500
your Spirit, your realization, your own ascent!

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.540
So we have to be careful.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:30.060
As a Mother I would say try to be

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.180
introspecting yourself very carefully

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.620
what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:43.180
What have we done for other people who are drifting?

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.700
What has been our behavior towards other sahaja yogis?

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:52.260
How much peace and love and compassion we have given to others?

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.980
How much understanding and tolerance we have shown to others?

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.820
If somebody gets here a little more money,

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:02.340
he becomes so bombastic, he becomes so aggressive,

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.580
he becomes so rude.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.660
I can’t believe it!

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:12.380
How can money lure you into these vices?

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:17.060
You are not ordinary people, you are the saints

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:22.100
whose feet were washed by the River Ganges.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.580
Try to understand your glory. Try to understand your own powers,

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:32.500
your own position as saintly people, sahaja yogis,

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.260
which are above all the saints

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.420
because you know how to give realization,

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.380
you know everything about Kundalini,

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.620
you know everything about realization.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.500
How many people knew about it?

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.420
Otherwise, I’ll start thinking

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.580
I have given all this knowledge to some bunch of fools

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:57.060
who do not know what is the value.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:01.180
As Christ has said, “Don’t throw pearls before the swines.”

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.660
But I don’t think I have done that mistake.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.660
I cannot believe I have done that mistake,

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.900
that I have thrown pearls before swines.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.180
I have not done it.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:18.420
But, it is for you to decide where you stand, in what category.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.580
It is so obvious that

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.780
it’s a very precarious time we are passing through.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.660
It’s very important [that] we have to fight it out.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.820
It’s much more than any wars you have fought.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.260
It’s much more than any struggle human beings ever had.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:42.900
It’s such a horrible world that is being created,

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.260
and we have to transform it.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.420
It’s a tremendous task.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.420
For that you have to work out

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:55.420
in a very sincere and a innate manner.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:59.260
And I’m sure one day will come

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:04.500
that in the history of this world

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:09.060
sahaja yogis will have their names written with golden letters.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.820
I am sure this will work out.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.180
I am sure this has to work out,

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:17.820
and that you all have to achieve it,

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:22.180
collectively, with one mind, with one heart.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.820
What should I sacrifice?

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.340
What should I do?

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.580
How should I help?

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.980
What is my contribution?

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:37.180
I wish I could see those days in My lifetime.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.940
So today is the day when we have to introspect.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.420
So should we go into meditation, all of us?

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:48.340
Please close your eyes.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.540
All of you close your eyes.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:39:01.420
Now we all will do the meditation the way we have been doing in the halls

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.900
wherever we had public programs.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.940
So the first you have to put your hand on your heart.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:11.060
We'll work on the left hand side, and the left hand towards me.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:17.340
Now, first of all, you put your hand on your heart.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:22.140
In the heart resides Shiva, is the Spirit.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:34.820
So, you have to thank your Spirit that it has brought light to your attention,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:39.660
because you're a saint and the light that has come in your heart

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.460
has to enlighten the whole world.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:47.420
So, please, now in your heart, you pray that,

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:57.380
"Let this light of my love of the Divine spread to the whole world."

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.140
With all sincerity and understanding

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:07.980
that you are connected with the Divine and whatever you desire will happen

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.620
with full confidence in yourself.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:21.340
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen,

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:26.260
on the left hand side, on the upper part of your stomach on the left hand side.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:34.340
And now here is the center of your dharma.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.140
Here you have to pray that,

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:41.420
"Let Vishwa Nirmal Dharma spread in the whole world.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:49.420
Let people see the light through our dharmic life; through our righteousness.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:55.140
Let people see them and accept the Vishwa Nirmal Dharm

00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:03.220
by which they get enlightenment and a benevolent higher life

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.140
and a desire to ascend."

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:20.660
Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen of the stomach

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.140
on the left hand side. Press it.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:30.740
Now this is the center of pure knowledge.

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.540
Here you have to say as Sahaja Yogis

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:47.820
that "our Mother has given us the full idea how the Divine works.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:52.580
She has given us all the mantras and all the pure knowledge

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:57.380
that we could bear and understand.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:07.180
Let me fully be knowledgeable about that, all of us."

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.420
I have seen if the man is a leader,

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.620
the wife doesn't know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:15.260
If the woman knows about Sahaja Yoga, the husband doesn't know anything about it.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:24.580
"Let me be proficient and an expert in this knowledge

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:39.900
so that I can give realization to people,

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:46.820
make them understand what is Divine Law,

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:52.940
what is Kundalini, and what are the chakras.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:43:00.820
Let my attention be more on Sahaja Yoga than all these mundane things."

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.780
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:12.500
Close your eyes. Now here on the left hand side, press it.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:20.980
Now here, "Mother has given me the Spirit, and I have my own guru

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:27.580
which is the Spirit. I am master of my own.

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:35.660
Let there be no abandonment. Let there be dignity in my character.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:39.100
Let there be generosity in my behavior.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:46.900
Let there be compassion and love for other Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:56.580
Let me not show off, but have a deep, deep knowledge about God's love

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:01.900
and His doings so that when people come to me,

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:06.700
I should be able to tell them about Sahaja Yoga

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:15.140
and give them this great knowledge with humility and love."

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.940
Now raise your right hand on your heart.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:31.340
Here you have to "Thank God that you have felt the ocean of joy

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:37.260
and you have felt the ocean of forgiveness

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:42.340
and the capacity to forgive as our Mother has

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.900
which we have seen is so tremendous.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:55.420
Let my heart expand and encompass the whole universe.

00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:02.900
And my love should resound the name of God."

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:13.940
The heart, every moment, should express the beauty of God's love.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:23.140
Take your now right hand in the Vishuddhi that is on the left Vishuddhi,

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:30.380
between the neck and the shoulder in the corner.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:40.260
"I will not indulge into the falsehood of guilt, because I know it is falsehood.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:49.260
I will not escape my faults, but face them and eradicate them.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:53.820
I will not try to find faults with others,

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:59.980
but in my own knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, let me remove their faults."

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:06.380
We have so many ways; secretly we can remove the faults of others.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.460
"Let my collectivity

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:22.500
become so great that the whole Sahaja Yoga race is my own family,

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:29.220
my own children, my home, my everything.

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:33.940
Let me get that feeling completely,

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:38.780
innately built within myself that I am a part and a parcel of the whole,

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.220
because we all have one Mother.

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:45.740
And let my concern go to the whole world,

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:50.540
to know what are their problems and how can,

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:55.820
through my true desire power, solve that.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.940
Let me feel the problems of the world in my heart,

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:16.940
and innately to remove all of them from the basis of which they are,

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:21.740
from the basis from which they are generated.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.580
Let me go to the principles of all these problems

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:30.860
and try to remove them through my Sahaja Yoga powers,

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.020
through my saintly powers."

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:39.180
Now put your right hand on your forehead, across.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:43.100
Now here you have to say, first of all

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:48.740
"I have to forgive all those who have not come in Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:52.580
those who are on the periphery, who come and go,

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.100
who jump in and jump out.

00:47:55.260 --> 00:48:02.020
But, first of all and foremost, I have to forgive all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.300
because they are all better than me.

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.540
I'm the one, who tries to find faults with them,

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:13.580
but I am at the lowest ebb and I have to forgive them

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:18.340
because I must know that I still have to go very further.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.860
I'm still much less. I have to improve myself."

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:26.660
This humility has to come within us, so you have to say here

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:32.180
"Let the humility in my heart, in a true sense,

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:41.780
not hypocritical, work out this feeling of forgiveness,

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:51.620
so that I bow to reality, to God, and to Sahaja Yoga."

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:55.780
Now you have to put back your hand on the backside of your head

00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:00.420
and push back your head here. And you have to say here,

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:04.980
"O Mother, whatever wrong we have done to You so far,

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.580
whatever wrong goes in our minds,

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.500
and whatever smallness we have shown to You,

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:14.500
whatever way we have troubled You and challenged You, please forgive us.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:16.300
" You have to ask for forgiveness.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.700
In your intelligence you should know what I am.

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:23.540
I don't have to tell you again and again.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:28.500
Now at Sahasrara you have to thank Me. At Sahasrara, put your hand,

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:31.700
move it seven times, and thank Me seven times,

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:35.140
"Mother thank You very much for the realization.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:40.340
And Mother, thank You very much for making us understand how great we are.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.260
And thank You very much for bringing all the blessings of the Divine.

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.980
And thank You very much for raising us higher, much higher,

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.820
than from where we were.

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:54.260
And also thank You very much for sustaining us

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.820
and for helping us to improve ourselves and correct ourselves.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:01.900
And thank You very much ultimately that Mother,

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.580
You have come on this earth, taken Your birth,

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:09.780
and working so hard for us, for all of us."

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:16.300
Press it hard and move it hard.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.540
Now take down your hands.

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.020
Heads are all very hot.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:56.020
So now let us give ourselves a nice bandhan.

00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:00.940
In the Bandhan of Mother let us move our left to the right.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:05.700
One, nicely, understanding what you are, what are your auras.

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:09.780
Now again, second one.

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:15.140
Now the third one.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.900
Now the fourth one.

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:28.660
Now the fifth.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:32.540
Now the sixth one.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.820
And now the seventh.

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:42.780
Now raise your Kundalini. Raise your Kundalini, slowly, very slowly.

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:45.620
Raise it, first time you have to do it very slowly.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.540
Now push back your heads, and give it a knot,

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.020
one knot.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:54.300
Second one, let's do it, very slowly

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.780
and knowing what you are, you're a saint.

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:01.180
Do it, properly, properly, do it properly, not in a haste.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:05.940
Take it to your head, push back your head and give it two knots there,

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.740
one and two.

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.180
Now let's do the other one.

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:13.940
Again the third one we have to give three knots.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:20.340
Very slowly do it, very slowly. Now do it properly.

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:31.420
Now push back your head, now give it the third one, three times.

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:35.340
Now see your vibrations.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:43.180
See your vibrations. Like this.

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:48.300
All the children, see your vibrations. Like this. Put your hands.

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:21.300
Beautiful. I am getting vibrations from you.

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:30.540
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
