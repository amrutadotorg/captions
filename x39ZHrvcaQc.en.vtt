04:27.320 --> 04:32.919
Advice, “Introspection and Meditation”. Shudy Camps (UK), 18 June 1988.

04:37.300 --> 04:43.260
This year we won’t be having I think,

04:44.820 --> 04:49.820
public programs in UK,

04:51.140 --> 04:54.580
because also there are certain circumstances.

04:54.740 --> 04:58.060
But whenever there is a circumstance

04:58.220 --> 05:04.420
which, somehow or other, changes our programs,

05:04.740 --> 05:07.060
we must immediately know

05:07.220 --> 05:13.700
that there is a purpose behind all that change,

05:13.860 --> 05:17.260
and we must immediately accept it

05:17.620 --> 05:22.500
with an open heart – that Divine wants us to change.

05:22.700 --> 05:25.740
Supposing I am going on a road

05:25.900 --> 05:27.980
and people say, “You are lost your way Mother.”

05:28.140 --> 05:32.140
That’s all right. I am never lost, because I am with Myself!

05:32.940 --> 05:38.180
But I had to go by that particular road, is the point.

05:38.420 --> 05:44.820
I had to do it, and that’s why I have…supposed to be,

05:45.260 --> 05:49.820
not on that road and I have lost My way.

05:50.220 --> 05:58.900
If you have that kind of a understanding,

05:59.420 --> 06:04.620
and if you have that satisfaction in your heart,

06:05.140 --> 06:10.020
then you’ll find life is worth much more than what you think it to be.

06:10.140 --> 06:17.140
Now, as it is, what was the reason, I thought,

06:17.420 --> 06:24.540
that we have decided to have public programs

06:25.820 --> 06:30.820
this year definitely, and we could not have public programs?

06:30.980 --> 06:36.060
So the reason is that we have to consolidate.

06:37.540 --> 06:44.020
In the growth of a tree, which is a living tree,

06:47.100 --> 06:55.660
it happens that it moves in a particular direction up to a point,

06:55.820 --> 06:58.940
till it has to change,

06:59.100 --> 07:03.500
because there is no sun coming that side,

07:03.660 --> 07:09.660
maybe there is no water levels arriving,

07:09.820 --> 07:12.620
so they start changing.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.140
In the same way, one has to understand that,

07:15.300 --> 07:17.740
we are in the hands of the Divine,

07:17.900 --> 07:20.980
and if some plans are changed,

07:21.140 --> 07:27.220
it is reflecting back on us, and we have to see why.

07:27.380 --> 07:31.500
And the why of it is that we have to consolidate.

07:31.700 --> 07:37.020
Consolidation of sahaja yogis is very important.

07:38.060 --> 07:45.060
The first thing to consolidate yourself, you must do introspection.

07:45.260 --> 07:51.420
You must do introspection, is to reflect the light within

07:51.580 --> 07:55.020
and see for yourself:

07:55.260 --> 07:59.300
what have you done so far in Sahaja Yoga?

07:59.460 --> 08:02.780
Where were you, How far you have gone,

08:02.940 --> 08:06.420
and how far have you to go.

08:06.980 --> 08:11.420
What is the thing that is lacking in you?

08:13.020 --> 08:16.460
You’ll be surprised when you start seeing yourself,

08:16.620 --> 08:20.260
in a very unbiased manner, not justifying yourself

08:20.420 --> 08:22.300
not blaming any bhoots,

08:22.460 --> 08:28.940
or need not blame any badhas within you, or somebody else.

08:29.100 --> 08:32.700
If you start yourself [seeing] what has gone wrong with you

08:32.860 --> 08:37.220
that you could not consolidate yourself properly,

08:37.380 --> 08:40.820
you’ll be amazed that there has been problems

08:40.980 --> 08:44.860
still lingering on which must be corrected.

08:45.020 --> 08:48.900
Now these problems you can see very clearly.

08:49.060 --> 08:52.340
In the light of the Spirit you can see them very clearly

08:52.500 --> 08:57.740
that, “This has gone wrong with me.”

08:58.140 --> 09:02.020
One of the most interesting things I’ve noticed is that

09:02.140 --> 09:08.140
Sahaja Yoga is all the time covered with some sort of a maya.

09:08.340 --> 09:13.620
And this maya is ignorance, complete ignorance sometimes,

09:13.780 --> 09:16.140
sometimes partially.

09:16.340 --> 09:21.380
Now when you get into Sahaja Yoga you get blessed.

09:21.540 --> 09:25.780
You get blessed maybe,

09:26.260 --> 09:31.900
your family gets blessed, your children get blessed.

09:32.060 --> 09:36.660
You get some sort of a blessing for your physical being.

09:36.820 --> 09:42.780
Also for financial [side], you get jobs, you get money,

09:42.940 --> 09:48.940
you get something exceptional, which is really miraculous.

09:49.100 --> 09:55.020
Now people get very much lost in those achievements

09:55.140 --> 09:58.980
and start drifting, thinking that,

09:59.140 --> 10:01.620
“Oh, this is the blessing we have got now.

10:01.780 --> 10:03.660
We don’t have to do anything anymore,”

10:03.820 --> 10:05.900
that you are being rewarded sufficiently

10:06.060 --> 10:10.620
for whatever you have done so far. That’s not so!

10:10.780 --> 10:16.900
Is just a sort of a support to you comes

10:17.060 --> 10:22.500
so that your faith should be fully established in Sahaja Yoga.

10:22.820 --> 10:27.140
And specially, you should know Me, what I am.

10:27.900 --> 10:34.580
But, if you go on still drifting,

10:34.740 --> 10:40.420
then maybe some of these blessings may turn out to be curses,

10:40.580 --> 10:45.140
and you might feel that what a curse it has fallen upon us

10:45.300 --> 10:50.340
and how it has gone in the wrong way.

10:50.580 --> 10:54.340
For some people it takes time to feel,

10:54.500 --> 10:59.060
to get to the feel of the blessings.

10:59.220 --> 11:03.780
For example, mostly, according to the modern ideas,

11:03.940 --> 11:08.540
we think that to get more money is the biggest blessing.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.620
So, so many get that also.

11:10.780 --> 11:12.820
But actually, it is not.

11:12.980 --> 11:15.700
To get your peace within,

11:15.860 --> 11:18.100
to get to your witness state,

11:18.260 --> 11:20.980
and to feel your vibrations all right,

11:21.140 --> 11:24.020
and to be in the center, all the time ascending,

11:24.140 --> 11:25.980
is the real blessing.

11:26.140 --> 11:30.980
Because with that, you get everything else.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.420
The completion is only possible

11:33.580 --> 11:39.820
when you have the complete joy bubbling within yourself.

11:39.980 --> 11:47.540
After all, everything is just a means to achieve joy,

11:47.700 --> 11:50.860
to feel the joy.

11:51.020 --> 11:53.500
It is not the end.

11:53.660 --> 11:57.060
If it was, those people who have money,

11:57.220 --> 11:59.140
those people who have good health,

11:59.340 --> 12:03.700
those people who have all the success, so-called, with them,

12:03.860 --> 12:06.380
they should have had been happy and peaceful,

12:06.540 --> 12:09.780
but they are not, they are suffering,

12:09.940 --> 12:18.580
they are suffering too much, and they are, in a way,

12:18.740 --> 12:21.900
destroying themselves, day by day,

12:22.060 --> 12:25.260
because they hate their lives, they can’t bear it.

12:25.420 --> 12:28.940
They cannot understand why they are on this Earth.

12:29.100 --> 12:34.860
So all these blessings that come to you,

12:35.020 --> 12:37.740
all these changes that come to you,

12:37.900 --> 12:42.860
all these new venues that open to you,

12:43.020 --> 12:49.500
one has to know that it is for your benevolence,

12:49.660 --> 12:51.580
everything for your benevolence,

12:51.740 --> 12:54.740
and your benevolence is your ascent,

12:54.900 --> 12:57.780
nothing else but your ascent.

12:57.940 --> 13:04.740
The rest of it is all useless and fruitless.

13:06.260 --> 13:08.660
Once you understand that this is

13:08.820 --> 13:10.980
what you have to achieve in life,

13:11.140 --> 13:15.500
that is what you have to enjoy, then it works out.

13:15.660 --> 13:20.540
But in Sahaja Yoga as you see, it’s compassion and love.

13:20.700 --> 13:23.620
It is not so much restrictions.

13:23.780 --> 13:26.700
You are left to yourself to develop yourself.

13:26.860 --> 13:29.500
Is your Spirit which has to guide you.

13:29.660 --> 13:35.140
There’s no coaxing or correction going on all the time.

13:35.340 --> 13:41.220
But it is left to you to understand yourself,

13:41.380 --> 13:44.900
to see for yourself, and work it out.

13:45.060 --> 13:47.860
But one of the criteria should be

13:48.020 --> 13:52.780
that “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

13:52.940 --> 13:57.060
Now what have I done for Mother?”

13:57.260 --> 14:00.700
These two things are very important to understand.

14:00.860 --> 14:05.060
Whatever small thing I could do for Sahaja Yoga

14:05.220 --> 14:07.500
is important because

14:07.660 --> 14:10.340
if you are intelligent, you can see

14:10.500 --> 14:13.740
that this is the greatest thing you have to do

14:13.900 --> 14:17.140
is to work for God.

14:17.500 --> 14:22.060
This is the most important thing so far

14:22.180 --> 14:26.740
human beings have indulged into,

14:26.900 --> 14:31.500
is the highest type of enterprise

14:31.660 --> 14:39.380
that human beings have ever had a chance to indulge into

14:39.540 --> 14:42.460
and what a chance it is too!

14:42.620 --> 14:44.660
You may say that, “Mother we are mediocres,

14:44.820 --> 14:47.340
we are no good, we are useless,”

14:47.500 --> 14:50.820
but you are chosen.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.820
You are the one chosen so there must be something about you.

14:54.980 --> 14:58.140
You might not have seen that part within yourself

14:58.260 --> 15:04.500
which is going to work out this great work of God.

15:04.660 --> 15:06.580
So you have to locate and find out:

15:06.740 --> 15:09.500
“Why am I selected for Sahaja Yoga?

15:09.660 --> 15:12.500
What can I do in Sahaja Yoga?

15:12.660 --> 15:15.500
What can I work it out in Sahaja Yoga?”

15:15.660 --> 15:22.260
This should be a constant reminder to you that,

15:22.420 --> 15:24.740
“I have been chosen for Sahaja Yoga.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.780
I want to take full advantage of Sahaja Yoga.”

15:27.940 --> 15:29.980
Supposing somebody doesn’t have money,

15:30.140 --> 15:31.980
he expects that Sahaja Yoga should give money,

15:32.140 --> 15:34.980
must give jobs, must give this, must give that,

15:35.140 --> 15:38.340
must have children, must give good health,

15:38.500 --> 15:40.500
all that. Expectations are all right.

15:40.660 --> 15:45.380
But “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”

15:47.380 --> 15:50.980
This is another point of introspection.

15:51.140 --> 15:55.500
Very important to see that

15:55.660 --> 16:00.100
we have to do something for Sahaja Yoga.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.740
It’s not money, it’s not work,

16:02.900 --> 16:08.900
it’s not thinking, it’s not any kind of a support.

16:09.060 --> 16:12.180
But one of them, the most important thing is,

16:12.340 --> 16:16.500
how many people you have given realization to?

16:18.980 --> 16:21.540
You have to count.

16:21.700 --> 16:26.100
How many people you have been able to give realization to,

16:27.340 --> 16:31.420
how many people you have talked about Sahaja Yoga.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.340
You may think that you give realization to some people,

16:36.500 --> 16:40.060
they come, they disappear – doesn’t matter.

16:40.220 --> 16:42.260
They will ultimately come to you.

16:42.420 --> 16:45.820
Today you try on some, they’ll be lost.

16:45.980 --> 16:51.060
Again tomorrow. You have to relentlessly work for it.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.900
As you know I’ve worked very hard in UK.

16:54.060 --> 16:58.420
My coming to UK itself was all predetermined.

16:58.660 --> 17:01.980
There was a need for Me to come here,

17:02.140 --> 17:06.140
to make the heart work better.

17:06.300 --> 17:09.860
But heart is lethargic, you know that,

17:10.020 --> 17:15.100
and lethargic heart gets all kinds of problems.

17:15.260 --> 17:18.620
But all these years I have been working,

17:18.780 --> 17:23.060
every year, whatever time I could give for sahaja yogis,

17:23.260 --> 17:25.780
for their problems, for Sahaja Yoga,

17:25.940 --> 17:28.900
for their minutest problem,

17:29.060 --> 17:31.100
for any kind of help they needed,

17:31.260 --> 17:34.660
every sort, I have tried to work it out.

17:34.980 --> 17:39.260
Directly, indirectly, you are all blessed.

17:39.420 --> 17:43.980
Still, what about you people who are now yogis?

17:44.140 --> 17:45.700
You are saints.

17:45.860 --> 17:47.460
You must see a photograph that I have,

17:47.620 --> 17:53.100
very interesting photograph, where you are all certified saints!

17:53.460 --> 17:55.260
Have you seen that photograph?

17:55.420 --> 17:59.420
Not yet? You better see it, let’s have it!

17:59.580 --> 18:03.140
The photograph is in My box, I think, yes.

18:03.340 --> 18:06.260
You are all certified saints!

18:06.420 --> 18:12.260
By the Divine, not by any cardinal or by any pope.

18:13.820 --> 18:16.420
So what are all these saints doing?

18:16.580 --> 18:20.980
One saint which is certified by pope,

18:21.140 --> 18:23.620
who is artificially certified,

18:23.780 --> 18:26.100
is such a big thing, you know.

18:26.260 --> 18:29.980
What about you, who have been certified by God Almighty?

18:30.140 --> 18:32.820
You are still busy with your work,

18:32.980 --> 18:36.140
you are still busy with your little, little things,

18:36.260 --> 18:44.820
you are still busy with your small lives and small families.

18:45.060 --> 18:47.820
For a saint, it’s said in Sanskrit,

18:47.980 --> 18:51.060
“Udara charitanam vasudhaiva kutumbakam,”

18:51.260 --> 18:56.140
for a person who is of a generous nature,

18:56.260 --> 18:58.860
means a person who is a saint,

18:59.020 --> 19:02.860
the whole world is his own family.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.860
Are you still only worried about your own family?

19:06.020 --> 19:10.660
Then you are not yet aware of your saintliness.

19:10.820 --> 19:13.820
And a saint doesn’t only worry about his own wife,

19:13.980 --> 19:18.500
about his own child, about his own house,

19:18.660 --> 19:23.300
he worries about the whole world.

19:23.460 --> 19:27.900
Now, as sahaja yogi, you are a powerful entity.

19:28.060 --> 19:31.300
You are very powerful people.

19:31.460 --> 19:35.980
We have got problems in the whole world. You know that very well.

19:36.140 --> 19:39.620
It’s not necessary you have to be great intellectuals,

19:39.780 --> 19:44.220
or you have to be people who are

19:44.380 --> 19:46.980
some sort of politicians, or something.

19:47.140 --> 19:51.340
But you must be on the lookout for the problems

19:51.500 --> 19:57.140
which are troubling this world. You have to be.

19:57.580 --> 20:00.660
You cannot live in your own world, that you are a saint,

20:00.820 --> 20:04.220
“Now I am in Niranand!” that’s not possible.

20:04.380 --> 20:06.660
You can’t just be in Niranand.

20:06.820 --> 20:11.580
You have to know that you have to live in this world,

20:11.740 --> 20:14.660
and you have to know all the problems of this world.

20:14.820 --> 20:16.340
And you have to think about them,

20:16.500 --> 20:19.060
not only your problems that, “Mother

20:19.260 --> 20:23.580
how will I be able to do this and how will I be able to do that?”

20:23.740 --> 20:26.300
But you have to worry about the whole world.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.340
You have to think, what’s happening in the world,

20:28.500 --> 20:30.660
what are the problems of the world.

20:30.820 --> 20:32.660
You are responsible for that.

20:32.820 --> 20:35.900
Not only that, but you have to pray.

20:36.060 --> 20:39.500
In your prayers you have to say, “Mother solve this problem.”

20:39.660 --> 20:43.660
Collectively, individually, you have to take your attention

20:43.820 --> 20:46.740
from yourself, from your smaller life,

20:46.900 --> 20:51.460
to a much wider thing – then you are a saint.

20:51.620 --> 20:59.420
And you have to think that it is your duty to ask for Divine help,

20:59.580 --> 21:03.420
that all these problems should be solved.

21:03.580 --> 21:08.020
This is your job for which you are selected.

21:08.180 --> 21:10.420
Your asking is going to work out

21:10.580 --> 21:12.700
because as you know, I am desire-less.

21:12.860 --> 21:17.980
You have to desire for it. Whatever you desire will work out.

21:18.140 --> 21:23.780
The protection, the affection, the compassion

21:23.940 --> 21:25.900
of Mother is with you.

21:26.060 --> 21:28.740
But you have to look after this world

21:28.900 --> 21:31.500
and show the concern that you have,

21:31.660 --> 21:34.740
not to live with a very limited areas,

21:34.900 --> 21:37.260
and with a very limited ways.

21:37.420 --> 21:41.340
Like now the British think, British are here, all right.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.380
“UK problems are our problems.” No

21:44.540 --> 21:46.540
Your problems extend to

21:46.700 --> 21:49.740
all the places wherever there is Sahaja Yoga.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.820
And you have to worry about all of them.

21:51.980 --> 21:55.660
Now we are having, say, problems in Australia.

21:55.820 --> 21:58.500
And there’s somebody who is very troublesome.

21:58.660 --> 22:03.620
So, you have to see to it that

22:03.780 --> 22:08.140
you beat that person with shoes and put that right.

22:08.340 --> 22:11.980
Your leader has to tell whom to beat with the shoes.

22:12.140 --> 22:14.940
And work it out, whether it is in Australia,

22:15.100 --> 22:19.180
whether it is in America, whether it is in India,

22:19.340 --> 22:23.420
anywhere you see that there’s a problem on Sahaja Yoga,

22:23.580 --> 22:24.980
there’s an assault on Sahaja Yoga,

22:25.140 --> 22:29.060
all of you should put your attention to it and work it out.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.660
Then there are general problems as you see.

22:32.820 --> 22:37.140
You see, we see that America is now becoming idiotic,

22:37.340 --> 22:39.140
or whatever you may say,

22:39.260 --> 22:43.820
so you have to put your attention to America.

22:44.260 --> 22:47.740
You have to stretch your attention outside,

22:47.900 --> 22:49.260
not inside

22:49.420 --> 22:52.180
just worried about yourself, about your family,

22:52.340 --> 22:55.780
about your house, about your children.

22:55.940 --> 22:59.860
As soon as you spread your attention outside,

23:00.020 --> 23:03.740
your problems are solved in the house,

23:03.900 --> 23:07.140
in the smaller circle they are solved.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.260
You have to pay attention outside!

23:09.420 --> 23:11.340
Now these days there are televisions,

23:11.500 --> 23:14.180
where, first, we had said, “Don’t see any televisions!“,

23:14.340 --> 23:17.780
because there was no use seeing television by sahaja yogis.

23:17.940 --> 23:20.420
When they saw the television they only got caught up.

23:20.580 --> 23:23.900
But now there are important things that are happening

23:24.060 --> 23:26.940
which you can see for yourself. You can scan it out,

23:27.100 --> 23:29.940
what are the world problems, and you can see for yourself

23:30.100 --> 23:32.220
where you have to put your attention.

23:32.380 --> 23:35.860
You should become aware of your personality,

23:36.020 --> 23:40.500
it’s not a personality that can be

23:40.660 --> 23:45.660
completely involved into a very small area.

23:45.820 --> 23:48.500
Your personality, is such [that it] should get involved

23:48.660 --> 23:53.340
into all the problems of the universe,

23:53.500 --> 23:55.580
all the problems there are.

23:55.740 --> 23:59.260
And you’ll be amazed that everything can work out

23:59.420 --> 24:00.740
in a very collective way.

24:00.900 --> 24:04.660
And at this stage, when you are, you can see for yourself now,

24:04.820 --> 24:08.740
all the sahaja yogis have got vibrations on top of their heads.

24:08.900 --> 24:11.260
Would you like to have a look, all of you?

24:11.420 --> 24:15.820
Just see! All of you, sitting in Ganapatipule.

24:17.140 --> 24:21.060
So stretch out your vibrations. Stretch out your attentions.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.500
And you’ll be amazed that

24:23.660 --> 24:28.860
all other stupid problems that you have will be finished.

24:29.020 --> 24:32.140
Now have a look. Let the children see first of all.

24:32.260 --> 24:37.500
Just see. You all have vibrations on top of your head.

25:56.660 --> 26:02.740
Let them grow, I tell you, I’m just waiting for them to grow!

26:07.180 --> 26:13.740
So the attitude toward ourselves should be

26:13.900 --> 26:18.900
to be aware of our own glory, of our own position,

26:19.060 --> 26:21.180
to know that we are saints,

26:21.340 --> 26:26.740
that we have reached a stage where we are at the highest,

26:26.900 --> 26:29.500
and that, now, we have become the light

26:29.660 --> 26:32.820
and we have to give light to others.

26:32.980 --> 26:36.860
If you see, in the Bible, Christ has said something,

26:37.020 --> 26:42.500
which is very important, that you
don’t put the light under the table.

26:44.780 --> 26:50.900
That’s what it is. You have to put the light on a pedestal.

26:51.060 --> 26:52.900
And that’s what it is that

26:53.060 --> 26:57.900
you have to put your light on the citadel,

26:58.060 --> 27:01.500
at a very highest point to give light to others.

27:01.660 --> 27:05.060
And this is working both ways

27:05.180 --> 27:07.940
if you start understanding what you are,

27:08.100 --> 27:12.340
what you have to be aware of, what is your situation,

27:12.500 --> 27:18.300
what is your powers, what you have achieved in Sahaja Yoga,

27:18.460 --> 27:26.340
what is the debt you have towards Sahaja Yoga,

27:26.500 --> 27:30.660
and what you have to give for Sahaja Yoga.

27:30.820 --> 27:33.860
How Sahaja Yoga has made you so capable,

27:34.020 --> 27:36.460
so good, so nice.

27:36.620 --> 27:39.900
Are you righteous enough? Are you behaving properly?

27:40.060 --> 27:42.820
Are you doing all the rightful things,

27:42.980 --> 27:45.620
which are necessary?

27:45.780 --> 27:49.740
Because it is only you who can do it.

27:49.900 --> 27:55.580
You are the people with a very very special energies

27:55.740 --> 28:01.420
and special contacts with the spiritual life,

28:01.580 --> 28:05.900
and if you start behaving like all other mundane, nonsensical people,

28:06.060 --> 28:08.140
limiting yourself to your family, your children,

28:08.340 --> 28:14.540
your nonsensical previous lives,

28:14.700 --> 28:17.020
you’ll be lost.

28:17.140 --> 28:20.300
Lost to yourself and lost to everyone.

28:20.460 --> 28:25.460
The problems are much more than what you know about.

28:25.620 --> 28:31.420
That is the understanding you have to reach,

28:31.580 --> 28:34.140
that Mother has made us yogis.

28:34.260 --> 28:35.980
We are saints.

28:36.140 --> 28:39.740
And we have to show to the world the right path.

28:39.900 --> 28:43.500
She has told us that we are the light

28:43.660 --> 28:47.500
and we have to show to people which way to go,

28:47.660 --> 28:49.060
how to go further.

28:49.180 --> 28:52.060
Instead of that everybody seems to be a problem,

28:52.180 --> 28:56.980
seems to be in a very small little whirlpool,

28:57.140 --> 28:59.260
going round and round and round.

28:59.420 --> 29:02.580
How can that be?

29:02.740 --> 29:05.260
I’ve told you many a times, look at these false gurus.

29:05.420 --> 29:07.660
They have no vibrations, they don’t know anything

29:07.820 --> 29:10.180
about Kundalini, nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

29:10.340 --> 29:14.420
But how much they are doing!

29:14.580 --> 29:16.860
While what are we doing?

29:17.020 --> 29:19.900
We’re struggling still with ourselves and with our problems,

29:20.060 --> 29:23.500
with our own ideas, with our very small-mindedness

29:23.660 --> 29:26.500
and chicken-heartedness.

29:27.060 --> 29:30.620
Now it is for you to understand.

29:30.780 --> 29:34.220
It is for you to decide about yourself.

29:34.380 --> 29:40.900
It is your own desire, it is your own bigness,

29:41.060 --> 29:44.300
your own magnanimity, which has to come forward.

29:44.460 --> 29:47.060
To see for yourself what you are capable of,

29:47.260 --> 29:48.740
what you can do.

29:48.900 --> 29:51.700
It’s very easy for people to say that,

29:51.860 --> 29:54.900
“Oh Mother, it’s too much. I can’t do anything about it.”

29:55.060 --> 29:58.540
Or somebody to say that, “Mother, I’m busy with my family.”

29:58.700 --> 30:01.780
Or somebody to say, “I’m busy with my children.”

30:01.940 --> 30:05.860
You have come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

30:06.020 --> 30:09.140
I have given you realization for that?

30:09.340 --> 30:13.580
All these blessings have come to you for that?

30:13.980 --> 30:18.420
So the consolidation that you have to do is very important.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.340
You can see it clearly that’s why

30:20.500 --> 30:22.420
we could not have any public programs,

30:22.580 --> 30:27.300
because we really need consolidation in UK.

30:27.460 --> 30:29.460
Though I have lived in UK for so many years,

30:29.620 --> 30:33.460
people take me for granted here.

30:33.740 --> 30:35.940
Because I am here, because I am staying here,

30:36.100 --> 30:38.660
they think if we go to the airport, finished!

30:38.820 --> 30:41.580
We have done all the haj, everything.

30:41.740 --> 30:44.660
“We’ve been to the airport; we’ve seen Mother, finished!”

30:44.820 --> 30:46.660
What’s the use of seeing Me?

30:46.820 --> 30:49.140
What have I given you?

30:50.140 --> 30:52.260
Is your light spreading?

30:52.420 --> 30:54.980
How many people have got realization from you?

30:55.140 --> 30:57.580
Just find out, how many people

30:57.740 --> 30:59.580
have learned Sahaja Yoga from you,

30:59.740 --> 31:02.300
or from your lives, or from your wisdom,

31:02.460 --> 31:05.820
or from your behavior?

31:05.980 --> 31:08.940
That is the way, that is the criteria.

31:09.100 --> 31:10.140
It’s not that

31:10.260 --> 31:14.660
“All right, I have sent Mother Her money for Her travel.”

31:14.820 --> 31:16.060
That’s not sufficient.

31:16.180 --> 31:21.100
At My age, from India, if you see any lady at My age,

31:21.260 --> 31:25.700
she walks with a stick, she can’t climb even one step

31:25.860 --> 31:29.900
Indian women can’t, because of the heat that they have suffered.

31:30.060 --> 31:32.580
But I’m traveling, you know how I’m traveling,

31:32.740 --> 31:37.780
how much I am doing. What about My family?

31:37.940 --> 31:42.420
I deprive them of My company, I deprive My husband of My company,

31:42.580 --> 31:46.500
everybody is just without Me.

31:46.660 --> 31:49.140
I am traveling traveling every day,

31:49.340 --> 31:52.980
you know that very well, and I’m working so very hard.

31:53.140 --> 31:57.540
Sometimes I sleep at two o’clock, sometimes at three o’clock.

31:57.700 --> 32:00.340
This time Harsh was with Me,

32:00.500 --> 32:03.740
and I saw him, he was fagged out!

32:03.900 --> 32:07.900
So I was saying you people do only relay race.

32:08.060 --> 32:11.780
I am in Australia, all right, Australians are working.

32:11.940 --> 32:14.180
Then I’m in Austria, then Austrians are working,

32:14.340 --> 32:18.260
then they are having a nice time there!

32:18.420 --> 32:21.860
I’m in UK, all right, little bit in UK, little work done.

32:22.020 --> 32:24.380
Then they all sit down nicely, enjoy.

32:24.540 --> 32:28.700
What about Me? I am having a marathon!

32:29.700 --> 32:31.740
In the same way you have to feel,

32:31.900 --> 32:35.740
after all, what is My gain in it?

32:35.900 --> 32:39.140
What do I gain out of it?

32:40.900 --> 32:43.260
I gain something:

32:43.420 --> 32:48.140
I have brought My children back to normal conditions,

32:48.340 --> 32:53.420
I have taken them to the Kingdom of God.

32:53.740 --> 32:56.060
You have to do the same.

32:56.180 --> 32:58.580
You have to take them to the Kingdom of God.

32:58.740 --> 33:02.340
But if you, yourself, are involved into your own mayas,

33:02.500 --> 33:05.660
you’ll be everyday going down and down and down and down.

33:05.820 --> 33:10.060
I may shout, I may say anything, it will not go into your heads,

33:10.180 --> 33:13.260
it will never click with you.

33:13.420 --> 33:15.740
You’ll be all stranded wherever you are,

33:15.900 --> 33:18.260
because you don’t want to see.

33:18.420 --> 33:21.580
For that I would say, you have one advantage,

33:21.740 --> 33:25.740
especially in UK. You are all very intelligent people.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.180
You have intelligence, no doubt,

33:28.340 --> 33:31.140
you are not idiots like Americans.

33:31.340 --> 33:33.060
You are intelligent.

33:33.220 --> 33:36.260
This intelligence became cunningness once upon a time,

33:36.420 --> 33:38.660
and now you are tired of your cunning.

33:38.820 --> 33:40.900
Indians have learned the cunning from you,

33:41.060 --> 33:43.860
they have become really very cunning.

33:44.020 --> 33:46.900
But you are tired of your cunningness,

33:47.060 --> 33:53.900
so now you are tired, fed up, fagged out, and lethargic.

33:54.620 --> 33:56.900
But with your intelligence you can understand

33:57.060 --> 34:00.260
that this is such an important work our Mother is doing.

34:00.420 --> 34:02.580
You’ll go down in the history!

34:02.740 --> 34:05.820
Every word you say, everything you say,

34:05.980 --> 34:07.340
every way you behave,

34:07.500 --> 34:10.260
everything is going to go down in the history!

34:10.420 --> 34:12.420
Not how many children you produced,

34:12.580 --> 34:15.100
or what sort of a wife you have,

34:15.260 --> 34:17.540
but what you did for Sahaja Yoga.

34:17.700 --> 34:18.980
Remember that.

34:19.140 --> 34:21.580
History is going to record everything,

34:21.740 --> 34:22.980
whatever you have done

34:23.140 --> 34:27.780
and whatever you have achieved in Sahaja Yoga.

34:30.020 --> 34:31.980
It’s not showing off.

34:32.140 --> 34:37.580
It’s not just a demonstration.

34:37.740 --> 34:39.340
It’s not talking big.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.980
It’s nothing of the kind.

34:42.140 --> 34:48.580
It’s actually, really, totally what you have achieved,

34:48.740 --> 34:52.340
is the point, will be recorded.

34:55.060 --> 34:59.180
At least God knows hypocrisy, and God knows bombastic temperaments.

34:59.340 --> 35:03.100
It’s God who knows where you are,

35:03.260 --> 35:04.980
and what you are up to.

35:05.140 --> 35:09.180
You cannot befool God, one thing you must realize.

35:09.340 --> 35:13.580
But when you are befooling God, you are befooling your Self,

35:13.740 --> 35:18.500
your Spirit, your realization, your own ascent!

35:21.740 --> 35:24.540
So we have to be careful.

35:24.700 --> 35:30.060
As a Mother I would say try to be

35:30.260 --> 35:34.180
introspecting yourself very carefully

35:34.340 --> 35:37.620
what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

35:37.780 --> 35:43.180
What have we done for other people who are drifting?

35:43.340 --> 35:47.700
What has been our behavior towards other sahaja yogis?

35:47.860 --> 35:52.260
How much peace and love and compassion we have given to others?

35:52.420 --> 35:55.980
How much understanding and tolerance we have shown to others?

35:56.140 --> 35:58.820
If somebody gets here a little more money,

35:58.980 --> 36:02.340
he becomes so bombastic, he becomes so aggressive,

36:02.500 --> 36:04.580
he becomes so rude.

36:04.740 --> 36:06.660
I can’t believe it!

36:06.820 --> 36:12.380
How can money lure you into these vices?

36:13.180 --> 36:17.060
You are not ordinary people, you are the saints

36:17.260 --> 36:22.100
whose feet were washed by the River Ganges.

36:23.060 --> 36:27.580
Try to understand your glory. Try to understand your own powers,

36:27.740 --> 36:32.500
your own position as saintly people, sahaja yogis,

36:32.660 --> 36:34.260
which are above all the saints

36:34.420 --> 36:36.420
because you know how to give realization,

36:36.580 --> 36:38.380
you know everything about Kundalini,

36:38.540 --> 36:41.620
you know everything about realization.

36:41.780 --> 36:44.500
How many people knew about it?

36:46.980 --> 36:49.420
Otherwise, I’ll start thinking

36:49.580 --> 36:53.580
I have given all this knowledge to some bunch of fools

36:53.740 --> 36:57.060
who do not know what is the value.

36:57.220 --> 37:01.180
As Christ has said, “Don’t throw pearls before the swines.”

37:01.340 --> 37:03.660
But I don’t think I have done that mistake.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.660
I cannot believe I have done that mistake,

37:05.820 --> 37:07.900
that I have thrown pearls before swines.

37:08.060 --> 37:11.180
I have not done it.

37:11.500 --> 37:18.420
But, it is for you to decide where you stand, in what category.

37:19.060 --> 37:22.580
It is so obvious that

37:22.740 --> 37:27.780
it’s a very precarious time we are passing through.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.660
It’s very important [that] we have to fight it out.

37:30.820 --> 37:33.820
It’s much more than any wars you have fought.

37:33.980 --> 37:37.260
It’s much more than any struggle human beings ever had.

37:37.420 --> 37:42.900
It’s such a horrible world that is being created,

37:43.060 --> 37:45.260
and we have to transform it.

37:45.420 --> 37:47.420
It’s a tremendous task.

37:47.580 --> 37:50.420
For that you have to work out

37:50.580 --> 37:55.420
in a very sincere and a innate manner.

37:55.660 --> 37:59.260
And I’m sure one day will come

37:59.420 --> 38:04.500
that in the history of this world

38:04.740 --> 38:09.060
sahaja yogis will have their names written with golden letters.

38:09.260 --> 38:10.820
I am sure this will work out.

38:10.980 --> 38:13.180
I am sure this has to work out,

38:13.340 --> 38:17.820
and that you all have to achieve it,

38:17.980 --> 38:22.180
collectively, with one mind, with one heart.

38:22.340 --> 38:23.820
What should I sacrifice?

38:23.980 --> 38:25.340
What should I do?

38:25.500 --> 38:27.580
How should I help?

38:27.740 --> 38:30.980
What is my contribution?

38:31.140 --> 38:37.180
I wish I could see those days in My lifetime.

38:37.940 --> 38:41.940
So today is the day when we have to introspect.

38:42.100 --> 38:44.420
So should we go into meditation, all of us?

38:44.580 --> 38:48.340
Please close your eyes.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.540
All of you close your eyes.

38:53.740 --> 39:01.420
Now we all will do the meditation the way we have been doing in the halls

39:01.580 --> 39:03.900
wherever we had public programs.

39:04.060 --> 39:06.940
So the first you have to put your hand on your heart.

39:07.100 --> 39:11.060
We'll work on the left hand side, and the left hand towards me.

39:11.260 --> 39:17.340
Now, first of all, you put your hand on your heart.

39:17.500 --> 39:22.140
In the heart resides Shiva, is the Spirit.

39:22.340 --> 39:34.820
So, you have to thank your Spirit that it has brought light to your attention,

39:34.980 --> 39:39.660
because you're a saint and the light that has come in your heart

39:39.860 --> 39:42.460
has to enlighten the whole world.

39:42.620 --> 39:47.420
So, please, now in your heart, you pray that,

39:47.580 --> 39:57.380
"Let this light of my love of the Divine spread to the whole world."

40:00.660 --> 40:03.140
With all sincerity and understanding

40:03.340 --> 40:07.980
that you are connected with the Divine and whatever you desire will happen

40:08.140 --> 40:11.620
with full confidence in yourself.

40:17.820 --> 40:21.340
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen,

40:21.500 --> 40:26.260
on the left hand side, on the upper part of your stomach on the left hand side.

40:26.420 --> 40:34.340
And now here is the center of your dharma.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.140
Here you have to pray that,

40:36.260 --> 40:41.420
"Let Vishwa Nirmal Dharma spread in the whole world.

40:41.580 --> 40:49.420
Let people see the light through our dharmic life; through our righteousness.

40:49.580 --> 40:55.140
Let people see them and accept the Vishwa Nirmal Dharm

40:55.260 --> 41:03.220
by which they get enlightenment and a benevolent higher life

41:03.380 --> 41:07.140
and a desire to ascend."

41:13.340 --> 41:20.660
Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen of the stomach

41:20.820 --> 41:23.140
on the left hand side. Press it.

41:23.300 --> 41:30.740
Now this is the center of pure knowledge.

41:31.580 --> 41:36.540
Here you have to say as Sahaja Yogis

41:36.700 --> 41:47.820
that "our Mother has given us the full idea how the Divine works.

41:47.980 --> 41:52.580
She has given us all the mantras and all the pure knowledge

41:52.740 --> 41:57.380
that we could bear and understand.

42:00.700 --> 42:07.180
Let me fully be knowledgeable about that, all of us."

42:07.340 --> 42:09.420
I have seen if the man is a leader,

42:09.580 --> 42:11.620
the wife doesn't know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

42:11.780 --> 42:15.260
If the woman knows about Sahaja Yoga, the husband doesn't know anything about it.

42:15.420 --> 42:24.580
"Let me be proficient and an expert in this knowledge

42:33.660 --> 42:39.900
so that I can give realization to people,

42:40.060 --> 42:46.820
make them understand what is Divine Law,

42:46.980 --> 42:52.940
what is Kundalini, and what are the chakras.

42:54.060 --> 43:00.820
Let my attention be more on Sahaja Yoga than all these mundane things."

43:00.980 --> 43:04.780
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen.

43:04.940 --> 43:12.500
Close your eyes. Now here on the left hand side, press it.

43:12.900 --> 43:20.980
Now here, "Mother has given me the Spirit, and I have my own guru

43:21.140 --> 43:27.580
which is the Spirit. I am master of my own.

43:27.740 --> 43:35.660
Let there be no abandonment. Let there be dignity in my character.

43:35.820 --> 43:39.100
Let there be generosity in my behavior.

43:39.260 --> 43:46.900
Let there be compassion and love for other Sahaja Yogis.

43:47.060 --> 43:56.580
Let me not show off, but have a deep, deep knowledge about God's love

43:56.740 --> 44:01.900
and His doings so that when people come to me,

44:02.060 --> 44:06.700
I should be able to tell them about Sahaja Yoga

44:06.860 --> 44:15.140
and give them this great knowledge with humility and love."

44:17.420 --> 44:21.940
Now raise your right hand on your heart.

44:23.620 --> 44:31.340
Here you have to "Thank God that you have felt the ocean of joy

44:31.500 --> 44:37.260
and you have felt the ocean of forgiveness

44:37.740 --> 44:42.340
and the capacity to forgive as our Mother has

44:42.500 --> 44:45.900
which we have seen is so tremendous.

44:46.060 --> 44:55.420
Let my heart expand and encompass the whole universe.

44:55.580 --> 45:02.900
And my love should resound the name of God."

45:03.860 --> 45:13.940
The heart, every moment, should express the beauty of God's love.

45:16.260 --> 45:23.140
Take your now right hand in the Vishuddhi that is on the left Vishuddhi,

45:23.300 --> 45:30.380
between the neck and the shoulder in the corner.

45:31.700 --> 45:40.260
"I will not indulge into the falsehood of guilt, because I know it is falsehood.

45:40.420 --> 45:49.260
I will not escape my faults, but face them and eradicate them.

45:49.420 --> 45:53.820
I will not try to find faults with others,

45:53.980 --> 45:59.980
but in my own knowledge of Sahaja Yoga, let me remove their faults."

46:00.140 --> 46:06.380
We have so many ways; secretly we can remove the faults of others.

46:08.500 --> 46:12.460
"Let my collectivity

46:13.580 --> 46:22.500
become so great that the whole Sahaja Yoga race is my own family,

46:22.660 --> 46:29.220
my own children, my home, my everything.

46:29.380 --> 46:33.940
Let me get that feeling completely,

46:34.100 --> 46:38.780
innately built within myself that I am a part and a parcel of the whole,

46:38.940 --> 46:42.220
because we all have one Mother.

46:42.380 --> 46:45.740
And let my concern go to the whole world,

46:45.900 --> 46:50.540
to know what are their problems and how can,

46:50.700 --> 46:55.820
through my true desire power, solve that.

46:55.980 --> 47:00.940
Let me feel the problems of the world in my heart,

47:01.100 --> 47:16.940
and innately to remove all of them from the basis of which they are,

47:17.100 --> 47:21.740
from the basis from which they are generated.

47:21.900 --> 47:26.580
Let me go to the principles of all these problems

47:26.740 --> 47:30.860
and try to remove them through my Sahaja Yoga powers,

47:31.020 --> 47:34.020
through my saintly powers."

47:34.180 --> 47:39.180
Now put your right hand on your forehead, across.

47:39.340 --> 47:43.100
Now here you have to say, first of all

47:43.260 --> 47:48.740
"I have to forgive all those who have not come in Sahaja Yoga,

47:48.900 --> 47:52.580
those who are on the periphery, who come and go,

47:52.740 --> 47:55.100
who jump in and jump out.

47:55.260 --> 48:02.020
But, first of all and foremost, I have to forgive all the Sahaja Yogis,

48:02.140 --> 48:05.300
because they are all better than me.

48:05.460 --> 48:08.540
I'm the one, who tries to find faults with them,

48:08.700 --> 48:13.580
but I am at the lowest ebb and I have to forgive them

48:13.740 --> 48:18.340
because I must know that I still have to go very further.

48:18.500 --> 48:21.860
I'm still much less. I have to improve myself."

48:22.020 --> 48:26.660
This humility has to come within us, so you have to say here

48:26.820 --> 48:32.180
"Let the humility in my heart, in a true sense,

48:32.340 --> 48:41.780
not hypocritical, work out this feeling of forgiveness,

48:41.940 --> 48:51.620
so that I bow to reality, to God, and to Sahaja Yoga."

48:51.780 --> 48:55.780
Now you have to put back your hand on the backside of your head

48:55.940 --> 49:00.420
and push back your head here. And you have to say here,

49:00.580 --> 49:04.980
"O Mother, whatever wrong we have done to You so far,

49:05.140 --> 49:07.580
whatever wrong goes in our minds,

49:07.740 --> 49:10.500
and whatever smallness we have shown to You,

49:10.660 --> 49:14.500
whatever way we have troubled You and challenged You, please forgive us.

49:14.660 --> 49:16.300
" You have to ask for forgiveness.

49:16.460 --> 49:18.700
In your intelligence you should know what I am.

49:18.860 --> 49:23.540
I don't have to tell you again and again.

49:23.700 --> 49:28.500
Now at Sahasrara you have to thank Me. At Sahasrara, put your hand,

49:28.660 --> 49:31.700
move it seven times, and thank Me seven times,

49:31.860 --> 49:35.140
"Mother thank You very much for the realization.

49:35.340 --> 49:40.340
And Mother, thank You very much for making us understand how great we are.

49:40.500 --> 49:44.260
And thank You very much for bringing all the blessings of the Divine.

49:44.420 --> 49:48.980
And thank You very much for raising us higher, much higher,

49:49.140 --> 49:50.820
than from where we were.

49:50.980 --> 49:54.260
And also thank You very much for sustaining us

49:54.420 --> 49:58.820
and for helping us to improve ourselves and correct ourselves.

49:58.980 --> 50:01.900
And thank You very much ultimately that Mother,

50:02.060 --> 50:04.580
You have come on this earth, taken Your birth,

50:04.740 --> 50:09.780
and working so hard for us, for all of us."

50:11.140 --> 50:16.300
Press it hard and move it hard.

50:45.540 --> 50:48.540
Now take down your hands.

50:48.700 --> 50:52.020
Heads are all very hot.

50:52.180 --> 50:56.020
So now let us give ourselves a nice bandhan.

50:56.180 --> 51:00.940
In the Bandhan of Mother let us move our left to the right.

51:01.100 --> 51:05.700
One, nicely, understanding what you are, what are your auras.

51:05.860 --> 51:09.780
Now again, second one.

51:11.420 --> 51:15.140
Now the third one.

51:18.380 --> 51:21.900
Now the fourth one.

51:24.540 --> 51:28.660
Now the fifth.

51:29.580 --> 51:32.540
Now the sixth one.

51:33.980 --> 51:36.820
And now the seventh.

51:37.300 --> 51:42.780
Now raise your Kundalini. Raise your Kundalini, slowly, very slowly.

51:42.940 --> 51:45.620
Raise it, first time you have to do it very slowly.

51:45.780 --> 51:49.540
Now push back your heads, and give it a knot,

51:49.700 --> 51:51.020
one knot.

51:51.140 --> 51:54.300
Second one, let's do it, very slowly

51:54.460 --> 51:57.780
and knowing what you are, you're a saint.

51:57.940 --> 52:01.180
Do it, properly, properly, do it properly, not in a haste.

52:01.340 --> 52:05.940
Take it to your head, push back your head and give it two knots there,

52:06.100 --> 52:08.740
one and two.

52:08.900 --> 52:10.180
Now let's do the other one.

52:10.340 --> 52:13.940
Again the third one we have to give three knots.

52:14.100 --> 52:20.340
Very slowly do it, very slowly. Now do it properly.

52:20.500 --> 52:31.420
Now push back your head, now give it the third one, three times.

52:31.580 --> 52:35.340
Now see your vibrations.

52:38.420 --> 52:43.180
See your vibrations. Like this.

52:43.380 --> 52:48.300
All the children, see your vibrations. Like this. Put your hands.

53:14.060 --> 53:21.300
Beautiful. I am getting vibrations from you.

53:24.180 --> 53:30.540
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
