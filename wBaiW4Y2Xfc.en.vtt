00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:45.500
I am overjoyed really today

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.542
to see you all here

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:53.999
to celebrate the Diwali Puja.

00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:59.792
We were to be in Portugal

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:03.959
but it was not so - so we are here.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.417
Diwali Puja is a very small puja

00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:15.000
but extremely significant.

00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:19.709
Firstly in Diwali,

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:25.083
the first day they buy something

00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:27.625
for the family.

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:35.792
You can - maybe some cooking utensil could be,

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:38.667
an ornament for the wife

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.625
or something like that.

00:07:41.375 --> 00:07:47.917
Because that is the day of housewife.

00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:51.999
And that day is to be celebrated

00:07:52.166 --> 00:07:59.917
as the housewife’s, I should say, homage to her.

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:06.875
As a result you know in India even now

00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:10.792
housewives are very much respected.

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:12.959
Actually they are respected all over.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:19.291
You will be amazed that even

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.542
in the protocol of the government

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.792
receptions anywhere

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:31.999
the wife is very important.

00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:34.166
And where she is sitting,

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:37.750
what is her position is very important.

00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:39.125
Even today

00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:44.542
in the most modern and advanced countries also

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.625
they have a special respect for the housewife.

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:50.999
The housewife may not be educated,

00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:55.375
she may be a very simple woman,

00:08:55.583 --> 00:08:58.291
she may not be very modern.

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:05.000
There was an experience for Me:

00:09:05.959 --> 00:09:09.542
in London we had a program

00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:13.417
where we all were invited,

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:20.500
and the head of the delegation,

00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:23.041
his wife was missing.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.208
So they asked Me, “Where is she?"

00:09:26.417 --> 00:09:30.417
Because there is a seat for her, she has to sit there.

00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:32.250
I said, “I don’t know, I didn’t see her.

00:09:32.458 --> 00:09:34.583
She must be somewhere here.”

00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:38.542
So just before starting

00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:45.792
I went to the washing room

00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:47.792
and I was surprised

00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:50.792
she was sitting in the waiting room there.

00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:52.917
I said, “What are you doing here?

00:09:53.083 --> 00:09:55.875
They are all waiting for you outside.”

00:09:56.041 --> 00:10:00.083
So she said, “They asked me to sit here.”

00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:02.000
So I went out and I told them

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:03.875
“Now she is sitting there. Why…

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:07.250
why don’t you call her to sit in her seat?”

00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:08.542
“Is she the wife?”

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.709
I said, “Yes, of course, she is the wife.”

00:10:12.917 --> 00:10:15.625
“We thought she was some secretary.”

00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:17.542
I said, “What made you think?”

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.750
This lady had, you see, very modern ideas -

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:25.917
wearing a very modern slick dress and all that and

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:27.417
and everybody thought

00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:30.417
this lady must be the secretary at the most.

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:33.667
So they made her sit in the waiting room.

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:38.542
You see - So it is expected of a housewife

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.750
to be decently dressed, honorably dressed

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:46.208
and not to dress up like a secretary

00:10:46.417 --> 00:10:51.875
or somebody who is just in the office.

00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:55.041
Because she is regarded as the highest -

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.625
whether you like it or not.

00:10:57.834 --> 00:11:00.667
But she had permed her hair

00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:03.500
and she has been to a very expensive place

00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:07.000
for all decorations and everything.

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:09.291
And poor thing, when she arrived

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:15.083
they put her in the waiting room near the bathroom.

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:18.542
That’s what it is.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.500
So for a housewife,

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:24.375
she is the dignity of the household.

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:27.625
Not only that, but she is responsible

00:11:27.834 --> 00:11:33.500
for the complete culture of that country,

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:37.917
complete culture of that country.

00:11:38.083 --> 00:11:40.875
They represent the culture.

00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:44.999
Like in India nowadays they have started

00:11:45.166 --> 00:11:48.417
in the films showing all kinds of funny, funny dresses.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.709
But I haven’t seen any housewife wearing that.

00:11:51.917 --> 00:11:53.625
I haven’t seen anybody.

00:11:53.834 --> 00:11:56.583
It’s not in reality, it’s only in the film,

00:11:56.792 --> 00:12:00.208
because the society is so strong

00:12:00.417 --> 00:12:05.208
and the housewife is supposed to be a decent person.

00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:06.667
She has to be decent,

00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:10.999
she has to be very dignified

00:12:11.166 --> 00:12:14.959
and she has to behave in a dignified manner.

00:12:16.417 --> 00:12:17.999
On the contrary I would say,

00:12:18.166 --> 00:12:21.875
we had a prime minister called Lal Bahadur Shastri.

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:25.000
His wife was absolutely uneducated

00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:27.417
because Shastriji went to jail

00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:29.792
and she couldn’t take her education -

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:33.458
very simple, ordinary woman.

00:12:33.667 --> 00:12:36.166
And she went to France.

00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:39.709
That time there was this Mr. de Gaulle,

00:12:39.917 --> 00:12:41.917
he was the president.

00:12:42.083 --> 00:12:45.500
And his wife was another very simple woman.

00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:47.417
So Shastriji told her

00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:50.959
that “You are not to cry when you are leaving Mrs. de Gaulle,

00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:52.625
now you’ve become great friends.”

00:12:52.834 --> 00:12:54.542
God knows she didn’t know French

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.375
and she didn’t know Hindi,

00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:59.709
but somehow both of them became great friends,

00:12:59.917 --> 00:13:02.709
on the level of housewives.

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:08.458
And when he warned her not to cry,

00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:12.625
what happened that they started crying

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:14.375
when they had to leave.

00:13:14.583 --> 00:13:16.999
So Shastriji said, “I told you not to cry."

00:13:17.166 --> 00:13:20.291
She said, “It is she, this French lady started crying.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.917
What can I do? I had to cry with her.”

00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:28.208
So you see, it’s a kind of a great

00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:31.250
collectivity of housewives

00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:33.500
that has to work out.

00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:36.291
They have common problems,

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.458
they have to face their children,

00:13:39.667 --> 00:13:42.208
they have to look after the household,

00:13:42.417 --> 00:13:46.000
everything – I mean there are so many common problems

00:13:46.208 --> 00:13:48.208
with the housewives.

00:13:48.417 --> 00:13:50.917
And the housewife also

00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:53.583
knows all little, little things.

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:57.250
You see, men at least in India don’t know much

00:13:57.458 --> 00:14:01.208
because they live in the air, I think.

00:14:01.417 --> 00:14:04.250
So the women have more sense

00:14:04.458 --> 00:14:07.250
in this respect, for small, small things

00:14:07.458 --> 00:14:09.500
they are quite aware.

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:14.083
It’s very interesting sometimes,

00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:17.625
the men commit mistakes

00:14:17.834 --> 00:14:21.542
of such a great humor.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.250
Because they do not deal with day-to-day life,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:31.959
with all the problems of daily life.

00:14:32.125 --> 00:14:34.000
On one side the woman,

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:37.917
housewife, has to deal with the daily life.

00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:42.333
On the other side she has to look after her family,

00:14:42.542 --> 00:14:44.166
her children.

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:47.959
Also, poor thing, she is responsible

00:14:48.125 --> 00:14:50.125
for the society.

00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:53.166
She has to maintain the society.

00:14:53.375 --> 00:14:56.834
In a country where women are sensible

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.375
and are matured,

00:14:59.583 --> 00:15:01.834
you will be amazed that they become

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.250
extremely good families,

00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:07.792
good societies and good children.

00:15:07.999 --> 00:15:09.625
That’s why I must say,

00:15:09.834 --> 00:15:14.834
India is a very good country of very good society.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.750
This is come out of the housewives,

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.458
the Gruha Lakshmis of the house,

00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:26.000
who have done all the work that is important

00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:28.959
as far as the culture is concerned.

00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:33.999
This kind of thing is very much in India

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:37.834
and with that, what you find

00:15:38.041 --> 00:15:42.166
that the people respect,

00:15:42.917 --> 00:15:45.375
respect the housewives.

00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:47.583
So respecting the housewife

00:15:47.792 --> 00:15:53.041
is the most important thing in our Sahaj culture.

00:15:53.625 --> 00:15:56.417
But that doesn’t mean that

00:15:56.625 --> 00:16:01.375
the women should try to dominate and trouble

00:16:01.583 --> 00:16:04.375
and fight with the husbands.

00:16:04.583 --> 00:16:10.375
But it means a very important position

00:16:10.792 --> 00:16:14.083
in the society, of a housewife.

00:16:14.291 --> 00:16:20.875
She is treated as a something a, like a devi only.

00:16:21.041 --> 00:16:23.917
But she too has to be a devi.

00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:27.208
If you treat her like a doormat,

00:16:27.417 --> 00:16:30.208
then children will never respect her.

00:16:30.417 --> 00:16:33.999
If you don’t pay proper respect to her,

00:16:34.166 --> 00:16:37.458
the children won’t respect the mother

00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:39.750
and there will be no impact

00:16:39.959 --> 00:16:42.458
of the mother on the children.

00:16:42.667 --> 00:16:45.999
As a result the children get wayward,

00:16:46.166 --> 00:16:49.750
and in the societies or in the countries

00:16:49.959 --> 00:16:52.999
where the mother is not respected,

00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:58.291
you will find the children become extremely dominating,

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:03.542
hot-tempered and horribly uncollective.

00:17:04.875 --> 00:17:07.250
So it’s very important that on this day

00:17:07.458 --> 00:17:10.333
we call it Dhanteras - the thirteenth day -

00:17:10.542 --> 00:17:14.125
you have to buy something for your wife,

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:17.583
and you have to give her something as a present.

00:17:17.792 --> 00:17:22.291
At least you should buy a little pot

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.667
or something that can be used in the kitchen

00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:29.417
to show your respect to her.

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:32.875
In the families where mother is not respected

00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:36.458
children become extremely troublesome

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:39.959
and the whole, their family also suffers -

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:43.417
wherever they are married, whatever happens to them.

00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:46.583
Men have to realize, it is their mistake

00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:51.625
that they have never respected their wife as they should have.

00:17:51.834 --> 00:17:54.583
In the presence of the children if they shout,

00:17:54.792 --> 00:17:59.250
in the presence of the children if they don’t show any respect,

00:17:59.458 --> 00:18:03.291
the children can never respect the mother.

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:07.792
It is something, a criminal thing to do

00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:10.834
to women who are in the household

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.959
doing all the work for you,

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.875
looking after you, your family,

00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:18.208
not demanding anything.

00:18:19.834 --> 00:18:21.500
Only if you want to understand

00:18:21.709 --> 00:18:23.375
how they can be troublesome,

00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:25.792
is see them in the politics.

00:18:25.999 --> 00:18:30.333
When they go in the politics they put all men upside-down.

00:18:30.999 --> 00:18:35.792
And one woman can put all of them in their proper senses.

00:18:36.041 --> 00:18:40.875
Because their field is their house, their family.

00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:43.417
If they are not respected in the family,

00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:45.583
they get out of the family

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:49.625
and behave in such manner that you can’t imagine.

00:18:49.834 --> 00:18:52.083
Though she has to bear a lot,

00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:53.792
she has to suffer a lot,

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:58.500
but in the family she must be respected.

00:18:58.709 --> 00:19:04.667
That’s a very, very important message of Gruha Lakshmi.

00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:10.667
Then the second day is the one where

00:19:10.999 --> 00:19:16.542
this horrible rakshasa called as Narakasura was killed.

00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:23.250
Always all killing is done with the power of the Shakti.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:29.542
This Narakasura was the fellow who had tortured so many people

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.583
and had done lots of cunning stuff.

00:19:33.792 --> 00:19:36.375
He was a very treacherous, cunning man

00:19:36.583 --> 00:19:40.458
and it was impossible to kill him.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.417
But then somehow or other,

00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:47.375
with the advent of a special power

00:19:47.583 --> 00:19:50.417
that this Narakasura was killed.

00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:55.083
That was the another day, fourth day,

00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:57.917
where Narakasura was killed.

00:19:58.709 --> 00:20:01.583
They say that when he was killed,

00:20:01.792 --> 00:20:05.458
the door of hell was closed.

00:20:05.667 --> 00:20:09.417
So people should take their baths early in the morning.

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:11.875
But I am of the opinion

00:20:12.041 --> 00:20:15.542
that day if the door is open, better not take bath.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.750
Be in your beds

00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:23.333
till this fellow is put fully into narak.

00:20:23.542 --> 00:20:26.291
You should not bother about him.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.291
“Naraka” means hell.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.875
And from the hell

00:20:31.041 --> 00:20:35.291
they extracted him and killed him.

00:20:35.959 --> 00:20:37.834
The last one is the best,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
where they have the meeting of Shri Rama

00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:45.083
and His brother Bharat.

00:20:45.291 --> 00:20:49.792
Shri Rama went to jail, obeying His father.

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:51.667
And for fourteen years

00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:55.542
He was – not a jail but in a, we could say,

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.792
He went in the forest

00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:01.542
as a - it was a kind of a jail only, because

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.417
He was living in the palaces and He was sent in the

00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:09.166
forest by His father

00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:11.999
and his daughter-in-law;

00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:14.792
also I mean it’s His own wife.

00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:19.959
And also the brother, they went together

00:21:20.125 --> 00:21:22.291
into great sufferings.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.542
And you know the whole story of Ramayana.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.542
The child

00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:34.291
that lived in the palaces

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.500
had to go in the forest

00:21:36.709 --> 00:21:40.291
and live in terrible conditions,

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.333
when He was to be the king.

00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:45.458
Was too much.

00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:49.458
But Sita went with Him

00:21:49.667 --> 00:21:52.250
and She supported Him

00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:57.041
and ultimately it so happened that

00:21:59.999 --> 00:22:05.999
Ravana came and took away Sita.

00:22:06.166 --> 00:22:08.375
But Shri Rama fought Ravana,

00:22:08.583 --> 00:22:12.000
killed him and brought back His wife.

00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:14.083
But when they came back

00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:18.750
to their own capital in Ayodhya,

00:22:18.959 --> 00:22:20.875
there was a big jubilation

00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:23.333
and Bharat, His brother -

00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:26.750
he was very much attached to his brother

00:22:26.959 --> 00:22:29.999
and he ruled that country

00:22:30.166 --> 00:22:32.417
with the paduka -

00:22:32.625 --> 00:22:38.792
they say is the kind of sandalwood chappals

00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:41.583
they use – of his brother.

00:22:41.792 --> 00:22:45.291
He put it on the throne and ruled.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.125
So that is how the Bharat milan-

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:50.792
the meeting of Bharat with Shri Rama-

00:22:50.999 --> 00:22:52.083
is celebrated,

00:22:52.291 --> 00:22:55.083
and that was the time He was crowned also

00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:56.625
as the king.

00:22:56.834 --> 00:22:58.250
So it is long time back,

00:22:58.458 --> 00:22:59.834
thousands of years back

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.417
this thing has happened.

00:23:01.625 --> 00:23:05.542
That jubilation is very significant

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:09.750
that the right king gets His own throne,

00:23:09.959 --> 00:23:11.917
and He rules.

00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:13.458
And all the injustice

00:23:13.667 --> 00:23:18.083
and all kind of atrocities He has gone through

00:23:18.291 --> 00:23:22.500
has to be completely finished from His life.

00:23:22.709 --> 00:23:26.417
And that’s why Diwali is important.

00:23:28.208 --> 00:23:32.208
So the last day they worship the Goddess Lakshmi.

00:23:32.417 --> 00:23:34.458
Because it is Her blessings

00:23:34.667 --> 00:23:38.709
that brought forth all these beautiful meetings.

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:43.166
And that’s why they worship Her, Lakshmi, as such.

00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:47.999
But there are nine types of Lakshmis within us,

00:23:48.166 --> 00:23:51.458
which I think I have told you sometimes back.

00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:56.083
Now in that Lakshmi Puja is this, that

00:23:56.291 --> 00:23:58.583
you worship the Lakshmi Herself.

00:23:58.792 --> 00:24:00.625
It doesn’t mean money,

00:24:00.834 --> 00:24:01.917
not at all.

00:24:02.083 --> 00:24:04.125
To worship money is wrong.

00:24:04.333 --> 00:24:06.291
But what it means that

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.792
Lakshmi is the money which is with us -

00:24:10.999 --> 00:24:13.333
or the whatever prosperity with that -

00:24:13.542 --> 00:24:15.917
should be very carefully spent,

00:24:16.083 --> 00:24:19.959
because She is very mobile

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.041
and the money can slip out.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:27.208
On the contrary you should not be at all miserly.

00:24:27.417 --> 00:24:30.542
Miserly people – Lakshmi is not happy.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.417
But if you want to spend,

00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:34.792
you must spend it in the right way,

00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:39.208
otherwise the money is spent in the wrong way.

00:24:40.917 --> 00:24:48.792
Now when the Lakshmi was created -

00:24:48.999 --> 00:24:49.792
you must be knowing

00:24:49.999 --> 00:24:53.083
out of the churning of the sea She came out.

00:24:54.208 --> 00:24:56.999
She had four hands,

00:24:57.166 --> 00:25:00.458
one hand was to give.

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:03.500
She is generous, She gives.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.000
Like this She gives,

00:25:07.208 --> 00:25:10.083
and with one hand She blesses.

00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:11.999
These are Her two hands.

00:25:12.166 --> 00:25:15.667
One is to give, and to bless the person.

00:25:17.041 --> 00:25:19.667
Very important it is,

00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:24.208
that when you give to somebody something,

00:25:24.417 --> 00:25:26.291
you forget about it,

00:25:26.667 --> 00:25:28.917
and you bless that person.

00:25:29.083 --> 00:25:30.625
Not only you give money,

00:25:30.834 --> 00:25:33.999
but also you bless that person.

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:37.291
The other two hands

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.500
have got two lotuses of pink color.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.625
Pink is the color of love.

00:25:46.834 --> 00:25:49.999
And a person who has money

00:25:50.166 --> 00:25:52.999
should have a house

00:25:53.166 --> 00:25:56.333
which is full of love.

00:25:56.542 --> 00:25:58.875
Any guest who comes in the house

00:25:59.041 --> 00:26:01.166
should be respected.

00:26:01.917 --> 00:26:06.166
He should be treated just like God.

00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:08.834
In India you have noticed how

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.166
they think foreigners -

00:26:10.375 --> 00:26:12.291
“foreigners” means God to them.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.291
Here “foreigner” is a bad word,

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.709
but in India is very respectable.

00:26:16.917 --> 00:26:18.125
If you are a foreigner

00:26:18.333 --> 00:26:20.458
means that you are God.

00:26:20.667 --> 00:26:24.000
How they have looked after you, you know that, in India.

00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:25.583
This is the reason,

00:26:25.792 --> 00:26:28.999
this is the basic culture of India

00:26:29.166 --> 00:26:31.542
that anybody who is a guest -

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.834
he may be anything -

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.125
if he is a guest

00:26:34.333 --> 00:26:37.417
then he is to be treated like God.

00:26:37.709 --> 00:26:41.458
In the other countries it’s just the other way round, you know.

00:26:41.667 --> 00:26:43.875
If you are a foreigner

00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:48.417
then people think it’s not even proper to talk to that person.

00:26:48.959 --> 00:26:52.750
I don’t know how the mentality is like that.

00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:09.792
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:09.999 --> 00:27:11.999
Sahaja yogis are not like that.

00:27:12.166 --> 00:27:18.417
They treat the guests very well, I’ve heard.

00:27:18.625 --> 00:27:20.375
They look after each other

00:27:20.625 --> 00:27:23.834
and they are beautifully collective.

00:27:24.291 --> 00:27:29.917
So this is what is the meaning of the lotus,

00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:32.709
is a house full of love.

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:37.208
Like a beetle which has got even thorns,

00:27:37.417 --> 00:27:41.542
when it comes to the lotus, the lotus open out

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.375
and the beetle goes inside

00:27:43.583 --> 00:27:47.583
and sleeps very nicely and comfortably.

00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:51.208
Even the beetle - undisturbed.

00:27:51.417 --> 00:27:55.208
That is how one should treat, if you have money.

00:27:55.417 --> 00:27:57.792
But here what I find

00:27:57.999 --> 00:28:00.208
in the world now, if you have money

00:28:00.417 --> 00:28:03.208
you become yourself like a beetle.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.999
They’re so full of thorns and horrible ideas,

00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:10.999
so insulting, and think no end of yourself.

00:28:11.709 --> 00:28:13.250
It’s just surprising is

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:15.792
that money which should give them

00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:19.750
the form of Lakshmi

00:28:19.959 --> 00:28:21.291
- Lakshmi Swarupa -

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.500
they become like devils.

00:28:23.709 --> 00:28:28.500
And the way they treat other people is even worse than that.

00:28:29.583 --> 00:28:33.999
So these are the significance of the form of the Goddess.

00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:37.542
But the best is, She’s just standing on the lotus.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.583
That means no pressure on anyone.

00:28:40.792 --> 00:28:43.542
She exists on Her own - no pressure.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:47.875
She doesn’t put any pressure on anyone,

00:28:48.041 --> 00:28:50.333
just on Her own She stands

00:28:50.542 --> 00:28:56.999
and all Her weight and all balanced on Her own dignity.

00:28:57.959 --> 00:29:00.792
This is the way a Lakshmi should be.

00:29:00.999 --> 00:29:04.000
And that’s how, if it is, when happens

00:29:04.208 --> 00:29:07.792
in the countries where people are having now financial crisis

00:29:07.999 --> 00:29:12.125
and all kinds of crisis, things will improve.

00:29:12.333 --> 00:29:16.500
People will enjoy. They don’t enjoy their money, nothing.

00:29:16.792 --> 00:29:20.583
They don’t enjoy. This is just aggressiveness

00:29:20.834 --> 00:29:23.000
and also funny ideas

00:29:23.208 --> 00:29:28.458
of having a, something, very expensive things

00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:33.583
and what you call the designers.

00:29:33.792 --> 00:29:37.750
Now I think these are designers are anti-Lakshmi,

00:29:37.959 --> 00:29:39.458
that they have come.

00:29:39.667 --> 00:29:43.291
Because they are extracting all your money nicely

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.417
and all your money goes to waste.

00:29:46.625 --> 00:29:52.375
If not that, then people take to womanizing or to drinking -

00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:54.333
such wasteful habits.

00:29:54.542 --> 00:29:57.709
They don’t do anything which we can call as

00:29:57.917 --> 00:30:00.625
really the blessing of the Lakshmi.

00:30:01.125 --> 00:30:03.834
So one has to remember

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.583
that when you want to give something to someone

00:30:07.792 --> 00:30:10.583
do it with the full heart.

00:30:10.792 --> 00:30:12.792
Such full heart that

00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:16.500
it forms that Lakshmi Prasada.

00:30:16.834 --> 00:30:18.999
You see, that should happen, otherwise

00:30:19.166 --> 00:30:22.792
what’s the use of giving presents to anyone?

00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:25.750
You see, they are very funny people, you know

00:30:25.959 --> 00:30:31.375
who give presents out of a very narrow outlook.

00:30:32.792 --> 00:30:36.458
But they try to give presents.

00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:38.500
Like in Japan, if you go,

00:30:38.709 --> 00:30:40.792
they’ll give you such a big present.

00:30:40.999 --> 00:30:44.999
You go on opening and opening and opening and opening it,

00:30:45.166 --> 00:30:49.583
till you come to a point when you’ll get a matchbox.

00:30:49.792 --> 00:30:52.291
In the matchbox - inside the matchbox,

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.417
you will take two,

00:30:58.125 --> 00:31:01.875
you can say, it’s two doll-like things made out of

00:31:02.041 --> 00:31:04.625
small little those matchsticks.

00:31:04.834 --> 00:31:05.999
Start looking at them

00:31:06.166 --> 00:31:10.959
“What this is, why such a big design?”

00:31:11.125 --> 00:31:13.959
and very surprising.

00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:17.709
But they are very simple people otherwise, very simple.

00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:21.083
When we went there, they told us

00:31:21.792 --> 00:31:26.458
they – wherever we went, you know even in a shop when it was raining

00:31:26.709 --> 00:31:28.125
they would give us a present.

00:31:28.333 --> 00:31:29.667
Now I said, “What is this?

00:31:29.875 --> 00:31:32.583
Why are they giving us a present like this?”

00:31:32.792 --> 00:31:35.667
So the lady who was translating, she said

00:31:35.875 --> 00:31:38.208
“They think You are from a royal family.”

00:31:38.417 --> 00:31:41.917
I said, “What makes them feel we are from a royal family?”

00:31:42.083 --> 00:31:44.999
“Because You don’t go to hairdresser.”

00:31:45.166 --> 00:31:46.250
I said, “Really?”

00:31:46.458 --> 00:31:52.083
“Yes. In Japan, royal family people never go to a hairdresser.”

00:31:52.291 --> 00:31:56.417
I said, “I didn’t know this, that they don’t go to the hairdresser.”

00:31:56.667 --> 00:32:00.000
“That’s why they think, You are from the royal family.”

00:32:00.208 --> 00:32:05.125
Just imagine what ideas people have about

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:10.917
hairdressing and all that.

00:32:11.083 --> 00:32:14.208
But in India or these places

00:32:14.417 --> 00:32:18.750
a woman must be properly combed - her hair.

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:21.792
She shouldn’t look like a hippie going round, you know.

00:32:21.999 --> 00:32:25.750
Because we have many people who

00:32:25.959 --> 00:32:28.417
still believe in a kind of a hippieism

00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:32.291
and they wear their hairdress like that.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.999
Now, woman plays a very big part in the society as I told you.

00:32:37.166 --> 00:32:41.000
Whatever way she wears, whatever where she goes about,

00:32:41.208 --> 00:32:43.500
also the children pick up much more

00:32:43.709 --> 00:32:46.458
then from the mother than from the father.

00:32:46.667 --> 00:32:49.500
Sometimes could be much more from the father also.

00:32:49.709 --> 00:32:53.125
But actually the, all the refined things

00:32:53.333 --> 00:32:55.625
are picked up from the mother.

00:32:55.834 --> 00:32:59.041
So it is more for the ladies

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:03.166
to understand how they dress up, how they live.

00:33:03.375 --> 00:33:05.875
Nowadays – I went to London

00:33:06.041 --> 00:33:08.250
and I’ve asked one Indian Sahaja yogini

00:33:08.458 --> 00:33:10.208
“What is the fashion now?”

00:33:10.417 --> 00:33:12.875
So she said “jipreya” in Marathi.

00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:16.041
“Jipreya” means if you put your hair like this is.

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.500
See in India, if we have hair like this

00:33:18.709 --> 00:33:21.625
the mother will say “Now remove your jipreyas.”

00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:26.750
Because if you put like that hair your eyes can become squinty.

00:33:27.208 --> 00:33:30.125
But that’s the fashion to put the hair like this, you see -

00:33:30.333 --> 00:33:32.999
very much, sometimes on the eyes also.

00:33:33.166 --> 00:33:35.083
So that’s a jipreya fashion.

00:33:35.291 --> 00:33:38.709
And this now is quite common I find everybody

00:33:38.917 --> 00:33:41.000
dignified ladies also,

00:33:41.208 --> 00:33:42.959
except for Mrs. Thatcher,

00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:45.667
everybody puts on this kind of a thing.

00:33:45.875 --> 00:33:49.333
I don’t know how Mrs. Thatcher has escaped it.

00:33:49.583 --> 00:33:52.375
But anybody who does anything

00:33:52.583 --> 00:33:54.709
that should not be followed by women.

00:33:54.917 --> 00:33:56.208
It’s very slavish.

00:33:56.417 --> 00:33:58.917
Because this is the fashion, that’s why they do it.

00:33:59.083 --> 00:34:01.166
That’s the fashion, so they do it.

00:34:01.375 --> 00:34:03.959
It’s absolutely stupid to do that way

00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:07.417
and to play into the hands of these people who make fashions.

00:34:07.667 --> 00:34:09.750
Because you are independent.

00:34:09.959 --> 00:34:11.959
You must stand on your own character.

00:34:12.125 --> 00:34:14.959
you must stand on your own understanding of things.

00:34:15.125 --> 00:34:17.834
Instead of ruining your faces

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.583
you should try to improve them

00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:24.208
by your dignity, by your

00:34:25.709 --> 00:34:27.750
understanding.

00:34:27.959 --> 00:34:31.792
Now it’s more on the women - I am sorry to say -

00:34:31.999 --> 00:34:34.750
Lakshmi Puja is more on the women

00:34:34.959 --> 00:34:36.709
that what they have to understand,

00:34:36.917 --> 00:34:40.375
what they have to be, how they should be.

00:34:41.208 --> 00:34:44.792
I have always told you

00:34:44.999 --> 00:34:49.417
that it’s necessary for a woman to be dignified,

00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:51.999
very much more than the man.

00:34:52.166 --> 00:34:54.917
Man can be stupid – doesn’t matter, you see,

00:34:55.083 --> 00:34:56.417
doesn’t matter so much.

00:34:56.625 --> 00:34:59.875
But women have to be dignified and sensible.

00:35:00.041 --> 00:35:01.999
And men, as it is, don’t know much

00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:03.667
as you know that very well.

00:35:03.875 --> 00:35:04.959
Poor things, you know,

00:35:05.125 --> 00:35:07.000
they are

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:14.291
They are educated only in the universities.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.125
But as far as the practical side is concerned,

00:35:17.333 --> 00:35:19.125
they don’t know anything.

00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:25.792
So one should not feel bad about it.

00:35:25.999 --> 00:35:27.542
I mean, it’s very enjoyable

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.125
to see the way men make mistake and

00:35:30.333 --> 00:35:32.834
then they go on saying “No, no, I know this, I know that,”

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.041
and they don’t know anything!

00:35:39.041 --> 00:35:44.000
So - But man will never say, “I don’t know.”

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:45.458
You see, that’s his character.

00:35:45.667 --> 00:35:47.166
It’s all right.

00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:49.875
You must know that he doesn’t mean it,

00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:52.834
because he really doesn’t know anything!

00:36:03.291 --> 00:36:06.000
Also in art.

00:36:06.417 --> 00:36:10.041
I don’t think men know much about art,

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:17.583
and also their one side is missing is aesthetics.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.291
Poor things, they make one type of clothes

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.583
wear all throughout.

00:36:23.959 --> 00:36:27.792
Just one type of dresses they will make

00:36:27.999 --> 00:36:31.083
and that they will make and wear throughout.

00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:33.000
They don’t have any demand.

00:36:33.208 --> 00:36:35.999
But women are artistic.

00:36:36.166 --> 00:36:40.709
And if our Indian women give up wearing saris

00:36:40.917 --> 00:36:44.291
and take to jeans, where will the villagers go?

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.083
Because they live with their saris that they make

00:36:47.291 --> 00:36:49.959
during holidays and things like that.

00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:53.458
So in India is not possible to introduce

00:36:53.667 --> 00:36:55.750
all these dresses.

00:36:55.959 --> 00:36:57.500
In the school maybe,

00:36:57.709 --> 00:37:01.458
but later on they all give up, because they like saris.

00:37:01.667 --> 00:37:04.000
So the saris are still on

00:37:04.208 --> 00:37:07.667
and will be on because it’s so artistic,

00:37:07.875 --> 00:37:09.125
it’s so beautiful.

00:37:09.333 --> 00:37:12.291
One sari doesn’t look like another sari.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.875
So the idea of beauty and the idea of art

00:37:16.041 --> 00:37:19.208
much more with the women, not with the men.

00:37:19.417 --> 00:37:22.291
And so one should see that

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.375
if men don’t know, doesn’t matter.

00:37:24.583 --> 00:37:30.999
But you make your houses absolutely artistic.

00:37:31.166 --> 00:37:36.000
Make it comfortable like the lotus, as I said,

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:37.583
that should be such.

00:37:37.792 --> 00:37:39.792
But some of the ladies

00:37:39.999 --> 00:37:44.083
can be very much like a Hitler, you know,

00:37:44.291 --> 00:37:46.542
in the household, very dictating.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.375
“This should be like this, that should be like that,”

00:37:49.583 --> 00:37:53.667
making the life of men absolutely miserable.

00:37:53.875 --> 00:37:55.291
I have known a person

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.333
who used to carry a newspaper in his house.

00:37:59.542 --> 00:38:01.583
So I said, “Why do you carry it all the time?”

00:38:01.792 --> 00:38:02.917
He said, “Whenever I sit,

00:38:03.083 --> 00:38:06.208
I put the newspaper first and then I sit.”

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:06.999
“Why?”

00:38:07.166 --> 00:38:10.709
“Because if it is spoilt a little bit

00:38:10.917 --> 00:38:13.083
my wife will shout at me.”

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:14.500
I said, “Why?”

00:38:14.709 --> 00:38:18.667
“Because she doesn’t like anything to be spoilt.

00:38:18.875 --> 00:38:20.333
So she’s so particular.

00:38:20.542 --> 00:38:23.166
I carry a newspaper always with me -

00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:25.917
wherever I have to sit I put the newspaper."

00:38:26.083 --> 00:38:27.750
I said, “It’s too much.”

00:38:27.959 --> 00:38:32.500
He said, “You will also have to do that, I tell You.”

00:38:37.083 --> 00:38:43.792
So very particular about the whole house

00:38:43.999 --> 00:38:47.625
that it’s impossible to live in that house.

00:38:47.834 --> 00:38:50.625
It’s even worse than a hospital.

00:38:50.834 --> 00:38:54.458
So some women can be very particular about that

00:38:54.667 --> 00:38:58.125
and very methodical, could be.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:03.417
But normally women should be very loving

00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:06.667
and extremely accommodating,

00:39:06.875 --> 00:39:11.667
and also being friendly with all the family members,

00:39:11.875 --> 00:39:13.709
with everyone.

00:39:13.959 --> 00:39:18.792
It’s very important that I’ve a family so big.

00:39:18.999 --> 00:39:21.417
We have a very large family,

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:24.166
so many brothers and sisters

00:39:24.375 --> 00:39:28.417
and everybody one better than the other.

00:39:28.625 --> 00:39:31.999
It is so remarkable that

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:37.291
everybody has a different type of a perfume, I think,

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.875
or a kind of a fragrance

00:39:40.041 --> 00:39:43.583
that shows an individual personality in them.

00:39:43.792 --> 00:39:47.667
Despite that they are all so nice and so good,

00:39:47.875 --> 00:39:51.208
so accommodating and so much enjoying,

00:39:51.417 --> 00:39:55.458
that it’s remarkable how people live together.

00:39:55.667 --> 00:40:00.125
Specially in Russia I found the women are very adaptable

00:40:00.375 --> 00:40:01.875
and very humorous.

00:40:02.041 --> 00:40:05.500
And they were making fun of everything

00:40:05.709 --> 00:40:08.083
and enjoying life.

00:40:08.792 --> 00:40:12.542
Very surprising, we had taken presents for them.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.458
But we had taken for about two thousand people,

00:40:15.667 --> 00:40:18.500
but there were sixteen thousand people.

00:40:18.709 --> 00:40:22.166
So how could we give these presents?

00:40:22.375 --> 00:40:24.750
So the women took out their chains

00:40:24.959 --> 00:40:27.417
and they said, “All right, we’ll give it to men, all right.

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:31.208
We’ll give them our ear-tops, all right,”

00:40:31.417 --> 00:40:33.375
and they were making fun of men,

00:40:33.583 --> 00:40:36.542
who were feeling bad that they couldn’t get anything.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:40.583
Such fun, you know, such understanding.

00:40:40.792 --> 00:40:43.875
Because they are not so money-oriented I think

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:48.709
and they are very spiritual-minded.

00:40:48.917 --> 00:40:52.875
So a spiritual woman wouldn’t bother about other things like this

00:40:53.041 --> 00:40:55.625
and will keep a dignity of her own

00:40:55.834 --> 00:40:59.667
and will show by her every gesture

00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:01.709
that she is spiritual.

00:41:01.917 --> 00:41:05.625
This is something so sweet, you know.

00:41:05.834 --> 00:41:08.291
As I was telling you, on one side

00:41:08.542 --> 00:41:10.417
sometimes you feel

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:16.625
a little different, say, I said it about Japan.

00:41:16.834 --> 00:41:19.999
But in the same Japan when I went there,

00:41:20.166 --> 00:41:22.917
I liked their tiles very much.

00:41:23.709 --> 00:41:26.583
So they were building up something,

00:41:26.792 --> 00:41:28.999
I liked the design of their tiles.

00:41:29.166 --> 00:41:31.792
So I said, “Can I take one from here?”

00:41:31.999 --> 00:41:37.041
“No, no, doesn’t matter. We’ll send it to Your ship.”

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.542
And on the ship a big load

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.959
of those tiles arrived.

00:41:43.125 --> 00:41:45.417
And the captain asked Me, “Now what are we to do?”

00:41:45.625 --> 00:41:46.999
I said, “How did you get it?”

00:41:47.166 --> 00:41:48.750
He said, “They brought it to You.”

00:41:48.959 --> 00:41:53.208
All kinds of varieties of those tiles,

00:41:53.417 --> 00:41:55.041
can you imagine?

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.333
So on one side it is

00:41:57.542 --> 00:42:00.625
a way of expression,

00:42:00.834 --> 00:42:03.917
on the other side is different.

00:42:04.083 --> 00:42:06.625
So one should understand also.

00:42:06.834 --> 00:42:09.542
When somebody gives you something

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.500
you should understand

00:42:11.709 --> 00:42:16.250
what is the significance of that,

00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:18.625
and not to feel bad about it.

00:42:18.834 --> 00:42:22.875
The significance of that could be very much great,

00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:24.625
you may not understand.

00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:28.834
So better to ask, why they have given you these things.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.208
That is what is, what we call auspiciousness,

00:42:32.417 --> 00:42:35.750
one of the great qualities of the Lakshmi is,

00:42:35.959 --> 00:42:39.083
that it should be auspicious.

00:42:39.625 --> 00:42:43.542
Whatever you give should be auspicious.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:45.458
Like sometimes

00:42:45.667 --> 00:42:48.041
I have seen little children out of mischief

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:51.250
will bring a lizard and try to give you.

00:42:51.458 --> 00:42:53.834
I mean, it’s very inauspicious to do that.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.750
But they are not told that it’s inauspicious,

00:42:56.959 --> 00:42:58.458
so they are doing like that.

00:42:58.667 --> 00:43:00.583
They have to be told it’s not auspicious,

00:43:00.792 --> 00:43:02.750
it will not please the Goddess.

00:43:02.959 --> 00:43:05.375
So that has to be understood very well

00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:09.208
that you should not try to insult

00:43:09.417 --> 00:43:13.375
the Lakshmi by giving something which is wrong.

00:43:13.583 --> 00:43:15.834
If you don’t know, you should find out

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.041
and do it properly.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.875
In this way this is the Diwali thing.

00:43:22.041 --> 00:43:25.291
But the greatest message of this is

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:31.375
that the kingdom was given to Shri Rama.

00:43:31.583 --> 00:43:37.208
Shri Rama was the embodiment of justice

00:43:37.417 --> 00:43:39.500
and fair play.

00:43:39.709 --> 00:43:42.125
And this was given to Him.

00:43:42.333 --> 00:43:45.417
In the same way we have to feel

00:43:45.625 --> 00:43:52.000
that our expression of gratitude,

00:43:52.208 --> 00:43:59.166
our expression of love should be such that it should be

00:43:59.375 --> 00:44:03.709
given to a person who is a symbol

00:44:03.917 --> 00:44:06.959
of such greatness like Shri Ram.

00:44:07.999 --> 00:44:12.500
It’s a very, very subtle thing one should try to understand.

00:44:12.709 --> 00:44:14.625
If you don’t want to give, you should not give.

00:44:14.834 --> 00:44:18.083
But if you want to give, then you must give something

00:44:18.291 --> 00:44:22.125
which is worth the person to whom you are giving.

00:44:22.709 --> 00:44:25.500
That is one of the lessons you should have

00:44:25.709 --> 00:44:32.166
about Shri Rama’s temperament.

00:44:32.709 --> 00:44:35.000
When He went into the village

00:44:35.208 --> 00:44:37.999
and He found there was an old woman

00:44:38.166 --> 00:44:43.917
and this old woman had all her teeth out practically.

00:44:44.083 --> 00:44:47.999
And she was from the aboriginal

00:44:48.166 --> 00:44:51.750
and she gave Him some

00:44:53.458 --> 00:44:57.625
we call them “ber” - is something like

00:45:00.417 --> 00:45:03.625
is a kind of a fruit, small fruits.

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:08.166
And she said, “See, I have tasted all of them

00:45:08.375 --> 00:45:11.250
and all of them are very sweet.

00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:15.625
Because You should not have something which is not sweet.

00:45:15.834 --> 00:45:17.583
So I have tasted them with my tooth,

00:45:17.792 --> 00:45:21.375
I have put my tooth on to them and I have tasted it.

00:45:21.583 --> 00:45:23.500
So please have them.”

00:45:23.709 --> 00:45:25.291
Immediately He took it.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.999
But His brother Lakshmana got very angry

00:45:28.166 --> 00:45:30.667
that it’s very inauspicious in India,

00:45:30.875 --> 00:45:32.959
if you have put something in the mouth

00:45:33.125 --> 00:45:34.999
and then you want to give to somebody

00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:38.458
is something [utishta ? ] – is not to be done.

00:45:40.999 --> 00:45:42.041
But Shri Rama said

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:45.166
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:48.417
They are the most beautiful fruits I have eaten.”

00:45:48.625 --> 00:45:49.750
So His wife says

00:45:49.959 --> 00:45:53.959
“Also give Me some. After all, I am Your half

00:45:54.125 --> 00:45:56.542
this thing, You must give Me.”

00:45:57.542 --> 00:46:00.041
So Shri Rama gave Her some.

00:46:00.709 --> 00:46:04.166
She said, “Wow, what a thing it is, tremendous.”

00:46:04.375 --> 00:46:08.458
She ate it and then the Lakshmana says

00:46:08.667 --> 00:46:10.709
“Give me also, sister-in-law.”

00:46:10.917 --> 00:46:12.792
She said, “Just now you were saying

00:46:12.999 --> 00:46:14.917
all kinds of things against this lady.

00:46:15.083 --> 00:46:16.500
Why do you want to have it?”

00:46:16.709 --> 00:46:19.625
He said, “Now please forgive me and give me.”

00:46:19.834 --> 00:46:22.834
So, see, it shows

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
that Shri Rama could see her love,

00:46:26.208 --> 00:46:30.208
her vibrations in those fruits

00:46:30.417 --> 00:46:32.291
that she had offered.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.667
And He could appreciate

00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:38.166
to that extent that He gave it to His wife

00:46:38.375 --> 00:46:41.625
and the wife also joined hands with Him.

00:46:41.834 --> 00:46:43.166
This is what it is.

00:46:43.375 --> 00:46:46.750
That whatever you do, you do it with love.

00:46:46.959 --> 00:46:48.750
If you do it with love,

00:46:48.959 --> 00:46:52.792
you will be able to make it auspicious.

00:46:52.999 --> 00:46:58.208
But if there’s no love, you are just doing for some purpose,

00:46:58.417 --> 00:47:00.333
then it is useless.

00:47:00.542 --> 00:47:06.333
So this is what is there for giving; giving to the

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.667
person like Shri Ram,

00:47:12.417 --> 00:47:16.834
and to such a great incarnation.

00:47:18.041 --> 00:47:20.709
She just thought of her love

00:47:20.917 --> 00:47:22.959
and she gave it to Him.

00:47:23.125 --> 00:47:26.750
In the same way you have to be very simple,

00:47:26.959 --> 00:47:32.166
simple-hearted, and then you will know what is the best to be done.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:37.166
So today is, actually the Diwali is over

00:47:37.375 --> 00:47:40.750
and I want to wish you again and again a happy Diwali

00:47:40.959 --> 00:47:43.375
and a very prosperous new year.

00:47:43.583 --> 00:47:47.792
May God bless you all.

00:48:30.834 --> 00:48:33.999
The same Lakshmi becomes Mahalakshmi.

00:48:34.166 --> 00:48:37.917
That is, when you understand

00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:42.375
the value of money

00:48:44.834 --> 00:48:47.583
and when you are saturated

00:48:48.417 --> 00:48:51.166
and you are fed up.

00:48:51.375 --> 00:48:54.500
From inside you get detached,

00:48:54.709 --> 00:49:00.375
then a new form of Lakshmi comes forward,

00:49:00.583 --> 00:49:03.166
that is Mahalakshmi.

00:49:03.375 --> 00:49:07.333
That’s the power which takes you higher and higher,

00:49:07.542 --> 00:49:10.375
which is the spiritual awakening.

00:49:10.583 --> 00:49:15.083
You have seen in all the countries which are very rich,

00:49:15.291 --> 00:49:18.083
this desire started

00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:22.917
that they should seek the truth, they should find out the truth

00:49:23.083 --> 00:49:25.625
and that’s how you are all here.

00:49:25.834 --> 00:49:30.250
That means Mahalakshmi Power started working in you,

00:49:30.458 --> 00:49:32.959
that you were seeking the truth.

00:49:33.125 --> 00:49:36.917
And while seeking the truth you came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:37.083 --> 00:49:38.917
So this Mahalakshmi

00:49:39.083 --> 00:49:41.875
is very important for you also.

00:49:42.041 --> 00:49:46.500
And you know Kolhapur, there’s a temple of this Mahalakshmi

00:49:46.709 --> 00:49:49.583
which came out of the Mother Earth.

00:49:49.792 --> 00:49:52.999
But they themselves didn’t know that

00:49:53.166 --> 00:49:59.625
in that temple why they sang “Jogawa,” which said that

00:49:59.834 --> 00:50:02.625
“O Ambe, awaken.”

00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:04.583
Ambe is the Kundalini.

00:50:04.792 --> 00:50:08.834
So why in Mahalakshmi’s temple they sang?

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.500
You can understand that, why

00:50:11.709 --> 00:50:15.250
in that temple they started singing

00:50:15.333 --> 00:50:19.417
the song of “Jogawa” by which to raise the Kundalini.
