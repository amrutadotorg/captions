WEBVTT

06:42.999 --> 06:45.500
I am overjoyed really today

06:46.500 --> 06:48.542
to see you all here

06:49.792 --> 06:53.999
to celebrate the Diwali Puja.

06:55.667 --> 06:59.792
We were to be in Portugal

06:59.999 --> 07:03.959
but it was not so - so we are here.

07:08.250 --> 07:11.417
Diwali Puja is a very small puja

07:11.625 --> 07:15.000
but extremely significant.

07:16.458 --> 07:19.709
Firstly in Diwali,

07:19.917 --> 07:25.083
the first day they buy something

07:25.291 --> 07:27.625
for the family.

07:28.999 --> 07:35.792
You can - maybe some cooking utensil could be,

07:35.999 --> 07:38.667
an ornament for the wife

07:38.875 --> 07:40.625
or something like that.

07:41.375 --> 07:47.917
Because that is the day of housewife.

07:48.625 --> 07:51.999
And that day is to be celebrated

07:52.166 --> 07:59.917
as the housewife’s, I should say, homage to her.

08:02.208 --> 08:06.875
As a result you know in India even now

08:07.041 --> 08:10.792
housewives are very much respected.

08:10.999 --> 08:12.959
Actually they are respected all over.

08:13.125 --> 08:19.291
You will be amazed that even

08:19.500 --> 08:24.542
in the protocol of the government

08:24.750 --> 08:27.792
receptions anywhere

08:27.999 --> 08:31.999
the wife is very important.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.166
And where she is sitting,

08:34.375 --> 08:37.750
what is her position is very important.

08:37.959 --> 08:39.125
Even today

08:39.333 --> 08:44.542
in the most modern and advanced countries also

08:44.750 --> 08:47.625
they have a special respect for the housewife.

08:47.834 --> 08:50.999
The housewife may not be educated,

08:51.166 --> 08:55.375
she may be a very simple woman,

08:55.583 --> 08:58.291
she may not be very modern.

09:00.625 --> 09:05.000
There was an experience for Me:

09:05.959 --> 09:09.542
in London we had a program

09:10.291 --> 09:13.417
where we all were invited,

09:13.625 --> 09:20.500
and the head of the delegation,

09:20.709 --> 09:23.041
his wife was missing.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.208
So they asked Me, “Where is she?"

09:26.417 --> 09:30.417
Because there is a seat for her, she has to sit there.

09:30.625 --> 09:32.250
I said, “I don’t know, I didn’t see her.

09:32.458 --> 09:34.583
She must be somewhere here.”

09:35.625 --> 09:38.542
So just before starting

09:39.125 --> 09:45.792
I went to the washing room

09:46.667 --> 09:47.792
and I was surprised

09:47.999 --> 09:50.792
she was sitting in the waiting room there.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.917
I said, “What are you doing here?

09:53.083 --> 09:55.875
They are all waiting for you outside.”

09:56.041 --> 10:00.083
So she said, “They asked me to sit here.”

10:00.291 --> 10:02.000
So I went out and I told them

10:02.208 --> 10:03.875
“Now she is sitting there. Why…

10:04.041 --> 10:07.250
why don’t you call her to sit in her seat?”

10:07.458 --> 10:08.542
“Is she the wife?”

10:08.750 --> 10:12.709
I said, “Yes, of course, she is the wife.”

10:12.917 --> 10:15.625
“We thought she was some secretary.”

10:15.834 --> 10:17.542
I said, “What made you think?”

10:17.750 --> 10:20.750
This lady had, you see, very modern ideas -

10:20.959 --> 10:25.917
wearing a very modern slick dress and all that and

10:26.083 --> 10:27.417
and everybody thought

10:27.625 --> 10:30.417
this lady must be the secretary at the most.

10:30.625 --> 10:33.667
So they made her sit in the waiting room.

10:33.875 --> 10:38.542
You see - So it is expected of a housewife

10:38.750 --> 10:42.750
to be decently dressed, honorably dressed

10:42.959 --> 10:46.208
and not to dress up like a secretary

10:46.417 --> 10:51.875
or somebody who is just in the office.

10:52.041 --> 10:55.041
Because she is regarded as the highest -

10:55.250 --> 10:57.625
whether you like it or not.

10:57.834 --> 11:00.667
But she had permed her hair

11:00.875 --> 11:03.500
and she has been to a very expensive place

11:03.709 --> 11:07.000
for all decorations and everything.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.291
And poor thing, when she arrived

11:09.500 --> 11:15.083
they put her in the waiting room near the bathroom.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.542
That’s what it is.

11:18.750 --> 11:21.500
So for a housewife,

11:21.709 --> 11:24.375
she is the dignity of the household.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.625
Not only that, but she is responsible

11:27.834 --> 11:33.500
for the complete culture of that country,

11:34.999 --> 11:37.917
complete culture of that country.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.875
They represent the culture.

11:41.417 --> 11:44.999
Like in India nowadays they have started

11:45.166 --> 11:48.417
in the films showing all kinds of funny, funny dresses.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.709
But I haven’t seen any housewife wearing that.

11:51.917 --> 11:53.625
I haven’t seen anybody.

11:53.834 --> 11:56.583
It’s not in reality, it’s only in the film,

11:56.792 --> 12:00.208
because the society is so strong

12:00.417 --> 12:05.208
and the housewife is supposed to be a decent person.

12:05.417 --> 12:06.667
She has to be decent,

12:06.875 --> 12:10.999
she has to be very dignified

12:11.166 --> 12:14.959
and she has to behave in a dignified manner.

12:16.417 --> 12:17.999
On the contrary I would say,

12:18.166 --> 12:21.875
we had a prime minister called Lal Bahadur Shastri.

12:22.041 --> 12:25.000
His wife was absolutely uneducated

12:25.208 --> 12:27.417
because Shastriji went to jail

12:27.625 --> 12:29.792
and she couldn’t take her education -

12:29.999 --> 12:33.458
very simple, ordinary woman.

12:33.667 --> 12:36.166
And she went to France.

12:36.875 --> 12:39.709
That time there was this Mr. de Gaulle,

12:39.917 --> 12:41.917
he was the president.

12:42.083 --> 12:45.500
And his wife was another very simple woman.

12:45.917 --> 12:47.417
So Shastriji told her

12:47.625 --> 12:50.959
that “You are not to cry when you are leaving Mrs. de Gaulle,

12:51.125 --> 12:52.625
now you’ve become great friends.”

12:52.834 --> 12:54.542
God knows she didn’t know French

12:54.750 --> 12:56.375
and she didn’t know Hindi,

12:56.583 --> 12:59.709
but somehow both of them became great friends,

12:59.917 --> 13:02.709
on the level of housewives.

13:02.917 --> 13:08.458
And when he warned her not to cry,

13:09.625 --> 13:12.625
what happened that they started crying

13:12.834 --> 13:14.375
when they had to leave.

13:14.583 --> 13:16.999
So Shastriji said, “I told you not to cry."

13:17.166 --> 13:20.291
She said, “It is she, this French lady started crying.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.917
What can I do? I had to cry with her.”

13:24.083 --> 13:28.208
So you see, it’s a kind of a great

13:28.417 --> 13:31.250
collectivity of housewives

13:31.959 --> 13:33.500
that has to work out.

13:33.709 --> 13:36.291
They have common problems,

13:36.500 --> 13:39.458
they have to face their children,

13:39.667 --> 13:42.208
they have to look after the household,

13:42.417 --> 13:46.000
everything – I mean there are so many common problems

13:46.208 --> 13:48.208
with the housewives.

13:48.417 --> 13:50.917
And the housewife also

13:51.083 --> 13:53.583
knows all little, little things.

13:53.792 --> 13:57.250
You see, men at least in India don’t know much

13:57.458 --> 14:01.208
because they live in the air, I think.

14:01.417 --> 14:04.250
So the women have more sense

14:04.458 --> 14:07.250
in this respect, for small, small things

14:07.458 --> 14:09.500
they are quite aware.

14:11.333 --> 14:14.083
It’s very interesting sometimes,

14:14.291 --> 14:17.625
the men commit mistakes

14:17.834 --> 14:21.542
of such a great humor.

14:21.750 --> 14:25.250
Because they do not deal with day-to-day life,

14:25.500 --> 14:31.959
with all the problems of daily life.

14:32.125 --> 14:34.000
On one side the woman,

14:34.208 --> 14:37.917
housewife, has to deal with the daily life.

14:38.166 --> 14:42.333
On the other side she has to look after her family,

14:42.542 --> 14:44.166
her children.

14:44.375 --> 14:47.959
Also, poor thing, she is responsible

14:48.125 --> 14:50.125
for the society.

14:50.333 --> 14:53.166
She has to maintain the society.

14:53.375 --> 14:56.834
In a country where women are sensible

14:57.000 --> 14:59.375
and are matured,

14:59.583 --> 15:01.834
you will be amazed that they become

15:02.000 --> 15:05.250
extremely good families,

15:05.458 --> 15:07.792
good societies and good children.

15:07.999 --> 15:09.625
That’s why I must say,

15:09.834 --> 15:14.834
India is a very good country of very good society.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.750
This is come out of the housewives,

15:18.959 --> 15:21.458
the Gruha Lakshmis of the house,

15:21.667 --> 15:26.000
who have done all the work that is important

15:26.208 --> 15:28.959
as far as the culture is concerned.

15:29.125 --> 15:33.999
This kind of thing is very much in India

15:34.166 --> 15:37.834
and with that, what you find

15:38.041 --> 15:42.166
that the people respect,

15:42.917 --> 15:45.375
respect the housewives.

15:45.583 --> 15:47.583
So respecting the housewife

15:47.792 --> 15:53.041
is the most important thing in our Sahaj culture.

15:53.625 --> 15:56.417
But that doesn’t mean that

15:56.625 --> 16:01.375
the women should try to dominate and trouble

16:01.583 --> 16:04.375
and fight with the husbands.

16:04.583 --> 16:10.375
But it means a very important position

16:10.792 --> 16:14.083
in the society, of a housewife.

16:14.291 --> 16:20.875
She is treated as a something a, like a devi only.

16:21.041 --> 16:23.917
But she too has to be a devi.

16:24.083 --> 16:27.208
If you treat her like a doormat,

16:27.417 --> 16:30.208
then children will never respect her.

16:30.417 --> 16:33.999
If you don’t pay proper respect to her,

16:34.166 --> 16:37.458
the children won’t respect the mother

16:37.667 --> 16:39.750
and there will be no impact

16:39.959 --> 16:42.458
of the mother on the children.

16:42.667 --> 16:45.999
As a result the children get wayward,

16:46.166 --> 16:49.750
and in the societies or in the countries

16:49.959 --> 16:52.999
where the mother is not respected,

16:53.166 --> 16:58.291
you will find the children become extremely dominating,

16:58.500 --> 17:03.542
hot-tempered and horribly uncollective.

17:04.875 --> 17:07.250
So it’s very important that on this day

17:07.458 --> 17:10.333
we call it Dhanteras - the thirteenth day -

17:10.542 --> 17:14.125
you have to buy something for your wife,

17:14.333 --> 17:17.583
and you have to give her something as a present.

17:17.792 --> 17:22.291
At least you should buy a little pot

17:22.500 --> 17:26.667
or something that can be used in the kitchen

17:26.875 --> 17:29.417
to show your respect to her.

17:29.625 --> 17:32.875
In the families where mother is not respected

17:33.041 --> 17:36.458
children become extremely troublesome

17:36.667 --> 17:39.959
and the whole, their family also suffers -

17:40.125 --> 17:43.417
wherever they are married, whatever happens to them.

17:43.625 --> 17:46.583
Men have to realize, it is their mistake

17:46.875 --> 17:51.625
that they have never respected their wife as they should have.

17:51.834 --> 17:54.583
In the presence of the children if they shout,

17:54.792 --> 17:59.250
in the presence of the children if they don’t show any respect,

17:59.458 --> 18:03.291
the children can never respect the mother.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.792
It is something, a criminal thing to do

18:07.999 --> 18:10.834
to women who are in the household

18:11.000 --> 18:12.959
doing all the work for you,

18:13.125 --> 18:15.875
looking after you, your family,

18:16.041 --> 18:18.208
not demanding anything.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.500
Only if you want to understand

18:21.709 --> 18:23.375
how they can be troublesome,

18:23.583 --> 18:25.792
is see them in the politics.

18:25.999 --> 18:30.333
When they go in the politics they put all men upside-down.

18:30.999 --> 18:35.792
And one woman can put all of them in their proper senses.

18:36.041 --> 18:40.875
Because their field is their house, their family.

18:41.041 --> 18:43.417
If they are not respected in the family,

18:43.625 --> 18:45.583
they get out of the family

18:45.792 --> 18:49.625
and behave in such manner that you can’t imagine.

18:49.834 --> 18:52.083
Though she has to bear a lot,

18:52.291 --> 18:53.792
she has to suffer a lot,

18:53.999 --> 18:58.500
but in the family she must be respected.

18:58.709 --> 19:04.667
That’s a very, very important message of Gruha Lakshmi.

19:07.125 --> 19:10.667
Then the second day is the one where

19:10.999 --> 19:16.542
this horrible rakshasa called as Narakasura was killed.

19:17.041 --> 19:23.250
Always all killing is done with the power of the Shakti.

19:23.500 --> 19:29.542
This Narakasura was the fellow who had tortured so many people

19:29.750 --> 19:33.583
and had done lots of cunning stuff.

19:33.792 --> 19:36.375
He was a very treacherous, cunning man

19:36.583 --> 19:40.458
and it was impossible to kill him.

19:40.750 --> 19:43.417
But then somehow or other,

19:43.625 --> 19:47.375
with the advent of a special power

19:47.583 --> 19:50.417
that this Narakasura was killed.

19:50.625 --> 19:55.083
That was the another day, fourth day,

19:55.291 --> 19:57.917
where Narakasura was killed.

19:58.709 --> 20:01.583
They say that when he was killed,

20:01.792 --> 20:05.458
the door of hell was closed.

20:05.667 --> 20:09.417
So people should take their baths early in the morning.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.875
But I am of the opinion

20:12.041 --> 20:15.542
that day if the door is open, better not take bath.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.750
Be in your beds

20:18.959 --> 20:23.333
till this fellow is put fully into narak.

20:23.542 --> 20:26.291
You should not bother about him.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.291
“Naraka” means hell.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.875
And from the hell

20:31.041 --> 20:35.291
they extracted him and killed him.

20:35.959 --> 20:37.834
The last one is the best,

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
where they have the meeting of Shri Rama

20:42.208 --> 20:45.083
and His brother Bharat.

20:45.291 --> 20:49.792
Shri Rama went to jail, obeying His father.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.667
And for fourteen years

20:51.875 --> 20:55.542
He was – not a jail but in a, we could say,

20:55.750 --> 20:57.792
He went in the forest

20:57.999 --> 21:01.542
as a - it was a kind of a jail only, because

21:01.750 --> 21:05.417
He was living in the palaces and He was sent in the

21:07.375 --> 21:09.166
forest by His father

21:09.375 --> 21:11.999
and his daughter-in-law;

21:12.166 --> 21:14.792
also I mean it’s His own wife.

21:14.999 --> 21:19.959
And also the brother, they went together

21:20.125 --> 21:22.291
into great sufferings.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.542
And you know the whole story of Ramayana.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.542
The child

21:31.667 --> 21:34.291
that lived in the palaces

21:34.500 --> 21:36.500
had to go in the forest

21:36.709 --> 21:40.291
and live in terrible conditions,

21:40.500 --> 21:43.333
when He was to be the king.

21:43.583 --> 21:45.458
Was too much.

21:46.041 --> 21:49.458
But Sita went with Him

21:49.667 --> 21:52.250
and She supported Him

21:52.458 --> 21:57.041
and ultimately it so happened that

21:59.999 --> 22:05.999
Ravana came and took away Sita.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.375
But Shri Rama fought Ravana,

22:08.583 --> 22:12.000
killed him and brought back His wife.

22:12.208 --> 22:14.083
But when they came back

22:14.291 --> 22:18.750
to their own capital in Ayodhya,

22:18.959 --> 22:20.875
there was a big jubilation

22:21.041 --> 22:23.333
and Bharat, His brother -

22:23.542 --> 22:26.750
he was very much attached to his brother

22:26.959 --> 22:29.999
and he ruled that country

22:30.166 --> 22:32.417
with the paduka -

22:32.625 --> 22:38.792
they say is the kind of sandalwood chappals

22:38.999 --> 22:41.583
they use – of his brother.

22:41.792 --> 22:45.291
He put it on the throne and ruled.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.125
So that is how the Bharat milan-

22:48.333 --> 22:50.792
the meeting of Bharat with Shri Rama-

22:50.999 --> 22:52.083
is celebrated,

22:52.291 --> 22:55.083
and that was the time He was crowned also

22:55.291 --> 22:56.625
as the king.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.250
So it is long time back,

22:58.458 --> 22:59.834
thousands of years back

23:00.000 --> 23:01.417
this thing has happened.

23:01.625 --> 23:05.542
That jubilation is very significant

23:05.750 --> 23:09.750
that the right king gets His own throne,

23:09.959 --> 23:11.917
and He rules.

23:12.083 --> 23:13.458
And all the injustice

23:13.667 --> 23:18.083
and all kind of atrocities He has gone through

23:18.291 --> 23:22.500
has to be completely finished from His life.

23:22.709 --> 23:26.417
And that’s why Diwali is important.

23:28.208 --> 23:32.208
So the last day they worship the Goddess Lakshmi.

23:32.417 --> 23:34.458
Because it is Her blessings

23:34.667 --> 23:38.709
that brought forth all these beautiful meetings.

23:38.917 --> 23:43.166
And that’s why they worship Her, Lakshmi, as such.

23:43.375 --> 23:47.999
But there are nine types of Lakshmis within us,

23:48.166 --> 23:51.458
which I think I have told you sometimes back.

23:52.333 --> 23:56.083
Now in that Lakshmi Puja is this, that

23:56.291 --> 23:58.583
you worship the Lakshmi Herself.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.625
It doesn’t mean money,

24:00.834 --> 24:01.917
not at all.

24:02.083 --> 24:04.125
To worship money is wrong.

24:04.333 --> 24:06.291
But what it means that

24:06.500 --> 24:10.792
Lakshmi is the money which is with us -

24:10.999 --> 24:13.333
or the whatever prosperity with that -

24:13.542 --> 24:15.917
should be very carefully spent,

24:16.083 --> 24:19.959
because She is very mobile

24:20.125 --> 24:22.041
and the money can slip out.

24:22.250 --> 24:27.208
On the contrary you should not be at all miserly.

24:27.417 --> 24:30.542
Miserly people – Lakshmi is not happy.

24:30.750 --> 24:32.417
But if you want to spend,

24:32.625 --> 24:34.792
you must spend it in the right way,

24:34.999 --> 24:39.208
otherwise the money is spent in the wrong way.

24:40.917 --> 24:48.792
Now when the Lakshmi was created -

24:48.999 --> 24:49.792
you must be knowing

24:49.999 --> 24:53.083
out of the churning of the sea She came out.

24:54.208 --> 24:56.999
She had four hands,

24:57.166 --> 25:00.458
one hand was to give.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.500
She is generous, She gives.

25:04.250 --> 25:07.000
Like this She gives,

25:07.208 --> 25:10.083
and with one hand She blesses.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.999
These are Her two hands.

25:12.166 --> 25:15.667
One is to give, and to bless the person.

25:17.041 --> 25:19.667
Very important it is,

25:19.875 --> 25:24.208
that when you give to somebody something,

25:24.417 --> 25:26.291
you forget about it,

25:26.667 --> 25:28.917
and you bless that person.

25:29.083 --> 25:30.625
Not only you give money,

25:30.834 --> 25:33.999
but also you bless that person.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.291
The other two hands

25:37.500 --> 25:42.500
have got two lotuses of pink color.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.625
Pink is the color of love.

25:46.834 --> 25:49.999
And a person who has money

25:50.166 --> 25:52.999
should have a house

25:53.166 --> 25:56.333
which is full of love.

25:56.542 --> 25:58.875
Any guest who comes in the house

25:59.041 --> 26:01.166
should be respected.

26:01.917 --> 26:06.166
He should be treated just like God.

26:06.375 --> 26:08.834
In India you have noticed how

26:09.000 --> 26:10.166
they think foreigners -

26:10.375 --> 26:12.291
“foreigners” means God to them.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.291
Here “foreigner” is a bad word,

26:14.500 --> 26:16.709
but in India is very respectable.

26:16.917 --> 26:18.125
If you are a foreigner

26:18.333 --> 26:20.458
means that you are God.

26:20.667 --> 26:24.000
How they have looked after you, you know that, in India.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.583
This is the reason,

26:25.792 --> 26:28.999
this is the basic culture of India

26:29.166 --> 26:31.542
that anybody who is a guest -

26:31.750 --> 26:32.834
he may be anything -

26:33.000 --> 26:34.125
if he is a guest

26:34.333 --> 26:37.417
then he is to be treated like God.

26:37.709 --> 26:41.458
In the other countries it’s just the other way round, you know.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.875
If you are a foreigner

26:44.041 --> 26:48.417
then people think it’s not even proper to talk to that person.

26:48.959 --> 26:52.750
I don’t know how the mentality is like that.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.792
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

27:09.999 --> 27:11.999
Sahaja yogis are not like that.

27:12.166 --> 27:18.417
They treat the guests very well, I’ve heard.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.375
They look after each other

27:20.625 --> 27:23.834
and they are beautifully collective.

27:24.291 --> 27:29.917
So this is what is the meaning of the lotus,

27:30.083 --> 27:32.709
is a house full of love.

27:32.917 --> 27:37.208
Like a beetle which has got even thorns,

27:37.417 --> 27:41.542
when it comes to the lotus, the lotus open out

27:41.750 --> 27:43.375
and the beetle goes inside

27:43.583 --> 27:47.583
and sleeps very nicely and comfortably.

27:48.125 --> 27:51.208
Even the beetle - undisturbed.

27:51.417 --> 27:55.208
That is how one should treat, if you have money.

27:55.417 --> 27:57.792
But here what I find

27:57.999 --> 28:00.208
in the world now, if you have money

28:00.417 --> 28:03.208
you become yourself like a beetle.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.999
They’re so full of thorns and horrible ideas,

28:07.166 --> 28:10.999
so insulting, and think no end of yourself.

28:11.709 --> 28:13.250
It’s just surprising is

28:13.458 --> 28:15.792
that money which should give them

28:15.999 --> 28:19.750
the form of Lakshmi

28:19.959 --> 28:21.291
- Lakshmi Swarupa -

28:21.500 --> 28:23.500
they become like devils.

28:23.709 --> 28:28.500
And the way they treat other people is even worse than that.

28:29.583 --> 28:33.999
So these are the significance of the form of the Goddess.

28:34.166 --> 28:37.542
But the best is, She’s just standing on the lotus.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.583
That means no pressure on anyone.

28:40.792 --> 28:43.542
She exists on Her own - no pressure.

28:43.750 --> 28:47.875
She doesn’t put any pressure on anyone,

28:48.041 --> 28:50.333
just on Her own She stands

28:50.542 --> 28:56.999
and all Her weight and all balanced on Her own dignity.

28:57.959 --> 29:00.792
This is the way a Lakshmi should be.

29:00.999 --> 29:04.000
And that’s how, if it is, when happens

29:04.208 --> 29:07.792
in the countries where people are having now financial crisis

29:07.999 --> 29:12.125
and all kinds of crisis, things will improve.

29:12.333 --> 29:16.500
People will enjoy. They don’t enjoy their money, nothing.

29:16.792 --> 29:20.583
They don’t enjoy. This is just aggressiveness

29:20.834 --> 29:23.000
and also funny ideas

29:23.208 --> 29:28.458
of having a, something, very expensive things

29:28.667 --> 29:33.583
and what you call the designers.

29:33.792 --> 29:37.750
Now I think these are designers are anti-Lakshmi,

29:37.959 --> 29:39.458
that they have come.

29:39.667 --> 29:43.291
Because they are extracting all your money nicely

29:43.500 --> 29:46.417
and all your money goes to waste.

29:46.625 --> 29:52.375
If not that, then people take to womanizing or to drinking -

29:52.583 --> 29:54.333
such wasteful habits.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.709
They don’t do anything which we can call as

29:57.917 --> 30:00.625
really the blessing of the Lakshmi.

30:01.125 --> 30:03.834
So one has to remember

30:04.000 --> 30:07.583
that when you want to give something to someone

30:07.792 --> 30:10.583
do it with the full heart.

30:10.792 --> 30:12.792
Such full heart that

30:12.999 --> 30:16.500
it forms that Lakshmi Prasada.

30:16.834 --> 30:18.999
You see, that should happen, otherwise

30:19.166 --> 30:22.792
what’s the use of giving presents to anyone?

30:22.999 --> 30:25.750
You see, they are very funny people, you know

30:25.959 --> 30:31.375
who give presents out of a very narrow outlook.

30:32.792 --> 30:36.458
But they try to give presents.

30:36.667 --> 30:38.500
Like in Japan, if you go,

30:38.709 --> 30:40.792
they’ll give you such a big present.

30:40.999 --> 30:44.999
You go on opening and opening and opening and opening it,

30:45.166 --> 30:49.583
till you come to a point when you’ll get a matchbox.

30:49.792 --> 30:52.291
In the matchbox - inside the matchbox,

30:52.500 --> 30:56.417
you will take two,

30:58.125 --> 31:01.875
you can say, it’s two doll-like things made out of

31:02.041 --> 31:04.625
small little those matchsticks.

31:04.834 --> 31:05.999
Start looking at them

31:06.166 --> 31:10.959
“What this is, why such a big design?”

31:11.125 --> 31:13.959
and very surprising.

31:14.208 --> 31:17.709
But they are very simple people otherwise, very simple.

31:17.917 --> 31:21.083
When we went there, they told us

31:21.792 --> 31:26.458
they – wherever we went, you know even in a shop when it was raining

31:26.709 --> 31:28.125
they would give us a present.

31:28.333 --> 31:29.667
Now I said, “What is this?

31:29.875 --> 31:32.583
Why are they giving us a present like this?”

31:32.792 --> 31:35.667
So the lady who was translating, she said

31:35.875 --> 31:38.208
“They think You are from a royal family.”

31:38.417 --> 31:41.917
I said, “What makes them feel we are from a royal family?”

31:42.083 --> 31:44.999
“Because You don’t go to hairdresser.”

31:45.166 --> 31:46.250
I said, “Really?”

31:46.458 --> 31:52.083
“Yes. In Japan, royal family people never go to a hairdresser.”

31:52.291 --> 31:56.417
I said, “I didn’t know this, that they don’t go to the hairdresser.”

31:56.667 --> 32:00.000
“That’s why they think, You are from the royal family.”

32:00.208 --> 32:05.125
Just imagine what ideas people have about

32:08.250 --> 32:10.917
hairdressing and all that.

32:11.083 --> 32:14.208
But in India or these places

32:14.417 --> 32:18.750
a woman must be properly combed - her hair.

32:18.959 --> 32:21.792
She shouldn’t look like a hippie going round, you know.

32:21.999 --> 32:25.750
Because we have many people who

32:25.959 --> 32:28.417
still believe in a kind of a hippieism

32:28.625 --> 32:32.291
and they wear their hairdress like that.

32:32.500 --> 32:36.999
Now, woman plays a very big part in the society as I told you.

32:37.166 --> 32:41.000
Whatever way she wears, whatever where she goes about,

32:41.208 --> 32:43.500
also the children pick up much more

32:43.709 --> 32:46.458
then from the mother than from the father.

32:46.667 --> 32:49.500
Sometimes could be much more from the father also.

32:49.709 --> 32:53.125
But actually the, all the refined things

32:53.333 --> 32:55.625
are picked up from the mother.

32:55.834 --> 32:59.041
So it is more for the ladies

32:59.250 --> 33:03.166
to understand how they dress up, how they live.

33:03.375 --> 33:05.875
Nowadays – I went to London

33:06.041 --> 33:08.250
and I’ve asked one Indian Sahaja yogini

33:08.458 --> 33:10.208
“What is the fashion now?”

33:10.417 --> 33:12.875
So she said “jipreya” in Marathi.

33:13.041 --> 33:16.041
“Jipreya” means if you put your hair like this is.

33:16.250 --> 33:18.500
See in India, if we have hair like this

33:18.709 --> 33:21.625
the mother will say “Now remove your jipreyas.”

33:21.834 --> 33:26.750
Because if you put like that hair your eyes can become squinty.

33:27.208 --> 33:30.125
But that’s the fashion to put the hair like this, you see -

33:30.333 --> 33:32.999
very much, sometimes on the eyes also.

33:33.166 --> 33:35.083
So that’s a jipreya fashion.

33:35.291 --> 33:38.709
And this now is quite common I find everybody

33:38.917 --> 33:41.000
dignified ladies also,

33:41.208 --> 33:42.959
except for Mrs. Thatcher,

33:43.125 --> 33:45.667
everybody puts on this kind of a thing.

33:45.875 --> 33:49.333
I don’t know how Mrs. Thatcher has escaped it.

33:49.583 --> 33:52.375
But anybody who does anything

33:52.583 --> 33:54.709
that should not be followed by women.

33:54.917 --> 33:56.208
It’s very slavish.

33:56.417 --> 33:58.917
Because this is the fashion, that’s why they do it.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.166
That’s the fashion, so they do it.

34:01.375 --> 34:03.959
It’s absolutely stupid to do that way

34:04.125 --> 34:07.417
and to play into the hands of these people who make fashions.

34:07.667 --> 34:09.750
Because you are independent.

34:09.959 --> 34:11.959
You must stand on your own character.

34:12.125 --> 34:14.959
you must stand on your own understanding of things.

34:15.125 --> 34:17.834
Instead of ruining your faces

34:18.000 --> 34:20.583
you should try to improve them

34:20.792 --> 34:24.208
by your dignity, by your

34:25.709 --> 34:27.750
understanding.

34:27.959 --> 34:31.792
Now it’s more on the women - I am sorry to say -

34:31.999 --> 34:34.750
Lakshmi Puja is more on the women

34:34.959 --> 34:36.709
that what they have to understand,

34:36.917 --> 34:40.375
what they have to be, how they should be.

34:41.208 --> 34:44.792
I have always told you

34:44.999 --> 34:49.417
that it’s necessary for a woman to be dignified,

34:49.625 --> 34:51.999
very much more than the man.

34:52.166 --> 34:54.917
Man can be stupid – doesn’t matter, you see,

34:55.083 --> 34:56.417
doesn’t matter so much.

34:56.625 --> 34:59.875
But women have to be dignified and sensible.

35:00.041 --> 35:01.999
And men, as it is, don’t know much

35:02.166 --> 35:03.667
as you know that very well.

35:03.875 --> 35:04.959
Poor things, you know,

35:05.125 --> 35:07.000
they are

35:10.500 --> 35:14.291
They are educated only in the universities.

35:14.500 --> 35:17.125
But as far as the practical side is concerned,

35:17.333 --> 35:19.125
they don’t know anything.

35:19.333 --> 35:25.792
So one should not feel bad about it.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.542
I mean, it’s very enjoyable

35:27.750 --> 35:30.125
to see the way men make mistake and

35:30.333 --> 35:32.834
then they go on saying “No, no, I know this, I know that,”

35:33.000 --> 35:35.041
and they don’t know anything!

35:39.041 --> 35:44.000
So - But man will never say, “I don’t know.”

35:44.208 --> 35:45.458
You see, that’s his character.

35:45.667 --> 35:47.166
It’s all right.

35:47.375 --> 35:49.875
You must know that he doesn’t mean it,

35:50.041 --> 35:52.834
because he really doesn’t know anything!

36:03.291 --> 36:06.000
Also in art.

36:06.417 --> 36:10.041
I don’t think men know much about art,

36:10.250 --> 36:17.583
and also their one side is missing is aesthetics.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.291
Poor things, they make one type of clothes

36:21.500 --> 36:23.583
wear all throughout.

36:23.959 --> 36:27.792
Just one type of dresses they will make

36:27.999 --> 36:31.083
and that they will make and wear throughout.

36:31.291 --> 36:33.000
They don’t have any demand.

36:33.208 --> 36:35.999
But women are artistic.

36:36.166 --> 36:40.709
And if our Indian women give up wearing saris

36:40.917 --> 36:44.291
and take to jeans, where will the villagers go?

36:44.500 --> 36:47.083
Because they live with their saris that they make

36:47.291 --> 36:49.959
during holidays and things like that.

36:50.125 --> 36:53.458
So in India is not possible to introduce

36:53.667 --> 36:55.750
all these dresses.

36:55.959 --> 36:57.500
In the school maybe,

36:57.709 --> 37:01.458
but later on they all give up, because they like saris.

37:01.667 --> 37:04.000
So the saris are still on

37:04.208 --> 37:07.667
and will be on because it’s so artistic,

37:07.875 --> 37:09.125
it’s so beautiful.

37:09.333 --> 37:12.291
One sari doesn’t look like another sari.

37:12.500 --> 37:15.875
So the idea of beauty and the idea of art

37:16.041 --> 37:19.208
much more with the women, not with the men.

37:19.417 --> 37:22.291
And so one should see that

37:22.500 --> 37:24.375
if men don’t know, doesn’t matter.

37:24.583 --> 37:30.999
But you make your houses absolutely artistic.

37:31.166 --> 37:36.000
Make it comfortable like the lotus, as I said,

37:36.250 --> 37:37.583
that should be such.

37:37.792 --> 37:39.792
But some of the ladies

37:39.999 --> 37:44.083
can be very much like a Hitler, you know,

37:44.291 --> 37:46.542
in the household, very dictating.

37:46.750 --> 37:49.375
“This should be like this, that should be like that,”

37:49.583 --> 37:53.667
making the life of men absolutely miserable.

37:53.875 --> 37:55.291
I have known a person

37:55.500 --> 37:59.333
who used to carry a newspaper in his house.

37:59.542 --> 38:01.583
So I said, “Why do you carry it all the time?”

38:01.792 --> 38:02.917
He said, “Whenever I sit,

38:03.083 --> 38:06.208
I put the newspaper first and then I sit.”

38:06.417 --> 38:06.999
“Why?”

38:07.166 --> 38:10.709
“Because if it is spoilt a little bit

38:10.917 --> 38:13.083
my wife will shout at me.”

38:13.291 --> 38:14.500
I said, “Why?”

38:14.709 --> 38:18.667
“Because she doesn’t like anything to be spoilt.

38:18.875 --> 38:20.333
So she’s so particular.

38:20.542 --> 38:23.166
I carry a newspaper always with me -

38:23.375 --> 38:25.917
wherever I have to sit I put the newspaper."

38:26.083 --> 38:27.750
I said, “It’s too much.”

38:27.959 --> 38:32.500
He said, “You will also have to do that, I tell You.”

38:37.083 --> 38:43.792
So very particular about the whole house

38:43.999 --> 38:47.625
that it’s impossible to live in that house.

38:47.834 --> 38:50.625
It’s even worse than a hospital.

38:50.834 --> 38:54.458
So some women can be very particular about that

38:54.667 --> 38:58.125
and very methodical, could be.

38:58.750 --> 39:03.417
But normally women should be very loving

39:03.625 --> 39:06.667
and extremely accommodating,

39:06.875 --> 39:11.667
and also being friendly with all the family members,

39:11.875 --> 39:13.709
with everyone.

39:13.959 --> 39:18.792
It’s very important that I’ve a family so big.

39:18.999 --> 39:21.417
We have a very large family,

39:21.625 --> 39:24.166
so many brothers and sisters

39:24.375 --> 39:28.417
and everybody one better than the other.

39:28.625 --> 39:31.999
It is so remarkable that

39:32.250 --> 39:37.291
everybody has a different type of a perfume, I think,

39:37.500 --> 39:39.875
or a kind of a fragrance

39:40.041 --> 39:43.583
that shows an individual personality in them.

39:43.792 --> 39:47.667
Despite that they are all so nice and so good,

39:47.875 --> 39:51.208
so accommodating and so much enjoying,

39:51.417 --> 39:55.458
that it’s remarkable how people live together.

39:55.667 --> 40:00.125
Specially in Russia I found the women are very adaptable

40:00.375 --> 40:01.875
and very humorous.

40:02.041 --> 40:05.500
And they were making fun of everything

40:05.709 --> 40:08.083
and enjoying life.

40:08.792 --> 40:12.542
Very surprising, we had taken presents for them.

40:12.750 --> 40:15.458
But we had taken for about two thousand people,

40:15.667 --> 40:18.500
but there were sixteen thousand people.

40:18.709 --> 40:22.166
So how could we give these presents?

40:22.375 --> 40:24.750
So the women took out their chains

40:24.959 --> 40:27.417
and they said, “All right, we’ll give it to men, all right.

40:27.625 --> 40:31.208
We’ll give them our ear-tops, all right,”

40:31.417 --> 40:33.375
and they were making fun of men,

40:33.583 --> 40:36.542
who were feeling bad that they couldn’t get anything.

40:36.750 --> 40:40.583
Such fun, you know, such understanding.

40:40.792 --> 40:43.875
Because they are not so money-oriented I think

40:44.041 --> 40:48.709
and they are very spiritual-minded.

40:48.917 --> 40:52.875
So a spiritual woman wouldn’t bother about other things like this

40:53.041 --> 40:55.625
and will keep a dignity of her own

40:55.834 --> 40:59.667
and will show by her every gesture

40:59.875 --> 41:01.709
that she is spiritual.

41:01.917 --> 41:05.625
This is something so sweet, you know.

41:05.834 --> 41:08.291
As I was telling you, on one side

41:08.542 --> 41:10.417
sometimes you feel

41:12.750 --> 41:16.625
a little different, say, I said it about Japan.

41:16.834 --> 41:19.999
But in the same Japan when I went there,

41:20.166 --> 41:22.917
I liked their tiles very much.

41:23.709 --> 41:26.583
So they were building up something,

41:26.792 --> 41:28.999
I liked the design of their tiles.

41:29.166 --> 41:31.792
So I said, “Can I take one from here?”

41:31.999 --> 41:37.041
“No, no, doesn’t matter. We’ll send it to Your ship.”

41:37.250 --> 41:40.542
And on the ship a big load

41:40.750 --> 41:42.959
of those tiles arrived.

41:43.125 --> 41:45.417
And the captain asked Me, “Now what are we to do?”

41:45.625 --> 41:46.999
I said, “How did you get it?”

41:47.166 --> 41:48.750
He said, “They brought it to You.”

41:48.959 --> 41:53.208
All kinds of varieties of those tiles,

41:53.417 --> 41:55.041
can you imagine?

41:55.250 --> 41:57.333
So on one side it is

41:57.542 --> 42:00.625
a way of expression,

42:00.834 --> 42:03.917
on the other side is different.

42:04.083 --> 42:06.625
So one should understand also.

42:06.834 --> 42:09.542
When somebody gives you something

42:09.750 --> 42:11.500
you should understand

42:11.709 --> 42:16.250
what is the significance of that,

42:16.458 --> 42:18.625
and not to feel bad about it.

42:18.834 --> 42:22.875
The significance of that could be very much great,

42:23.041 --> 42:24.625
you may not understand.

42:24.834 --> 42:28.834
So better to ask, why they have given you these things.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.208
That is what is, what we call auspiciousness,

42:32.417 --> 42:35.750
one of the great qualities of the Lakshmi is,

42:35.959 --> 42:39.083
that it should be auspicious.

42:39.625 --> 42:43.542
Whatever you give should be auspicious.

42:43.750 --> 42:45.458
Like sometimes

42:45.667 --> 42:48.041
I have seen little children out of mischief

42:48.250 --> 42:51.250
will bring a lizard and try to give you.

42:51.458 --> 42:53.834
I mean, it’s very inauspicious to do that.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.750
But they are not told that it’s inauspicious,

42:56.959 --> 42:58.458
so they are doing like that.

42:58.667 --> 43:00.583
They have to be told it’s not auspicious,

43:00.792 --> 43:02.750
it will not please the Goddess.

43:02.959 --> 43:05.375
So that has to be understood very well

43:05.583 --> 43:09.208
that you should not try to insult

43:09.417 --> 43:13.375
the Lakshmi by giving something which is wrong.

43:13.583 --> 43:15.834
If you don’t know, you should find out

43:16.000 --> 43:18.041
and do it properly.

43:18.250 --> 43:21.875
In this way this is the Diwali thing.

43:22.041 --> 43:25.291
But the greatest message of this is

43:25.500 --> 43:31.375
that the kingdom was given to Shri Rama.

43:31.583 --> 43:37.208
Shri Rama was the embodiment of justice

43:37.417 --> 43:39.500
and fair play.

43:39.709 --> 43:42.125
And this was given to Him.

43:42.333 --> 43:45.417
In the same way we have to feel

43:45.625 --> 43:52.000
that our expression of gratitude,

43:52.208 --> 43:59.166
our expression of love should be such that it should be

43:59.375 --> 44:03.709
given to a person who is a symbol

44:03.917 --> 44:06.959
of such greatness like Shri Ram.

44:07.999 --> 44:12.500
It’s a very, very subtle thing one should try to understand.

44:12.709 --> 44:14.625
If you don’t want to give, you should not give.

44:14.834 --> 44:18.083
But if you want to give, then you must give something

44:18.291 --> 44:22.125
which is worth the person to whom you are giving.

44:22.709 --> 44:25.500
That is one of the lessons you should have

44:25.709 --> 44:32.166
about Shri Rama’s temperament.

44:32.709 --> 44:35.000
When He went into the village

44:35.208 --> 44:37.999
and He found there was an old woman

44:38.166 --> 44:43.917
and this old woman had all her teeth out practically.

44:44.083 --> 44:47.999
And she was from the aboriginal

44:48.166 --> 44:51.750
and she gave Him some

44:53.458 --> 44:57.625
we call them “ber” - is something like

45:00.417 --> 45:03.625
is a kind of a fruit, small fruits.

45:03.834 --> 45:08.166
And she said, “See, I have tasted all of them

45:08.375 --> 45:11.250
and all of them are very sweet.

45:11.458 --> 45:15.625
Because You should not have something which is not sweet.

45:15.834 --> 45:17.583
So I have tasted them with my tooth,

45:17.792 --> 45:21.375
I have put my tooth on to them and I have tasted it.

45:21.583 --> 45:23.500
So please have them.”

45:23.709 --> 45:25.291
Immediately He took it.

45:25.500 --> 45:27.999
But His brother Lakshmana got very angry

45:28.166 --> 45:30.667
that it’s very inauspicious in India,

45:30.875 --> 45:32.959
if you have put something in the mouth

45:33.125 --> 45:34.999
and then you want to give to somebody

45:35.166 --> 45:38.458
is something [utishta ? ] – is not to be done.

45:40.999 --> 45:42.041
But Shri Rama said

45:42.250 --> 45:45.166
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.

45:45.375 --> 45:48.417
They are the most beautiful fruits I have eaten.”

45:48.625 --> 45:49.750
So His wife says

45:49.959 --> 45:53.959
“Also give Me some. After all, I am Your half

45:54.125 --> 45:56.542
this thing, You must give Me.”

45:57.542 --> 46:00.041
So Shri Rama gave Her some.

46:00.709 --> 46:04.166
She said, “Wow, what a thing it is, tremendous.”

46:04.375 --> 46:08.458
She ate it and then the Lakshmana says

46:08.667 --> 46:10.709
“Give me also, sister-in-law.”

46:10.917 --> 46:12.792
She said, “Just now you were saying

46:12.999 --> 46:14.917
all kinds of things against this lady.

46:15.083 --> 46:16.500
Why do you want to have it?”

46:16.709 --> 46:19.625
He said, “Now please forgive me and give me.”

46:19.834 --> 46:22.834
So, see, it shows

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
that Shri Rama could see her love,

46:26.208 --> 46:30.208
her vibrations in those fruits

46:30.417 --> 46:32.291
that she had offered.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.667
And He could appreciate

46:34.875 --> 46:38.166
to that extent that He gave it to His wife

46:38.375 --> 46:41.625
and the wife also joined hands with Him.

46:41.834 --> 46:43.166
This is what it is.

46:43.375 --> 46:46.750
That whatever you do, you do it with love.

46:46.959 --> 46:48.750
If you do it with love,

46:48.959 --> 46:52.792
you will be able to make it auspicious.

46:52.999 --> 46:58.208
But if there’s no love, you are just doing for some purpose,

46:58.417 --> 47:00.333
then it is useless.

47:00.542 --> 47:06.333
So this is what is there for giving; giving to the

47:09.000 --> 47:11.667
person like Shri Ram,

47:12.417 --> 47:16.834
and to such a great incarnation.

47:18.041 --> 47:20.709
She just thought of her love

47:20.917 --> 47:22.959
and she gave it to Him.

47:23.125 --> 47:26.750
In the same way you have to be very simple,

47:26.959 --> 47:32.166
simple-hearted, and then you will know what is the best to be done.

47:33.250 --> 47:37.166
So today is, actually the Diwali is over

47:37.375 --> 47:40.750
and I want to wish you again and again a happy Diwali

47:40.959 --> 47:43.375
and a very prosperous new year.

47:43.583 --> 47:47.792
May God bless you all.

48:30.834 --> 48:33.999
The same Lakshmi becomes Mahalakshmi.

48:34.166 --> 48:37.917
That is, when you understand

48:39.875 --> 48:42.375
the value of money

48:44.834 --> 48:47.583
and when you are saturated

48:48.417 --> 48:51.166
and you are fed up.

48:51.375 --> 48:54.500
From inside you get detached,

48:54.709 --> 49:00.375
then a new form of Lakshmi comes forward,

49:00.583 --> 49:03.166
that is Mahalakshmi.

49:03.375 --> 49:07.333
That’s the power which takes you higher and higher,

49:07.542 --> 49:10.375
which is the spiritual awakening.

49:10.583 --> 49:15.083
You have seen in all the countries which are very rich,

49:15.291 --> 49:18.083
this desire started

49:18.291 --> 49:22.917
that they should seek the truth, they should find out the truth

49:23.083 --> 49:25.625
and that’s how you are all here.

49:25.834 --> 49:30.250
That means Mahalakshmi Power started working in you,

49:30.458 --> 49:32.959
that you were seeking the truth.

49:33.125 --> 49:36.917
And while seeking the truth you came to Sahaja Yoga.

49:37.083 --> 49:38.917
So this Mahalakshmi

49:39.083 --> 49:41.875
is very important for you also.

49:42.041 --> 49:46.500
And you know Kolhapur, there’s a temple of this Mahalakshmi

49:46.709 --> 49:49.583
which came out of the Mother Earth.

49:49.792 --> 49:52.999
But they themselves didn’t know that

49:53.166 --> 49:59.625
in that temple why they sang “Jogawa,” which said that

49:59.834 --> 50:02.625
“O Ambe, awaken.”

50:02.834 --> 50:04.583
