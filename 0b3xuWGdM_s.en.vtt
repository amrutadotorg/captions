Eye Treatment
Interview with a journalist
October 14,
1986 Kolkata, India

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.800
In Sahaja yogis, problems that are collective

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.900
arise because of weak eyes.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I observe a lot of people here have faint eyes.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.300
What should we do about it?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.000
To improve it, you have to help each other.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.000
After reaching a certain age,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.400
your eyes weaken anyway, so keep your eyes strong

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.400
so they don't get too bad.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.000
Hold the light [candle] in front of the photo

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.000
and hold the candle in your hand in any candle stand

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.400
and on the back of your head here [back Ajna] like you are doing Aarti,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.100
here do Aarti [bandhan].

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
The one who is sitting in the front

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.300
he will hold his right hand towards the
picture and his left hand towards the aether.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.300
And in the back you have to do Aarti [bandhan]

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.400
on his back Ajna.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.000
And after Aarti, sit on the ground for a while,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.400
keep your left hand in front of the candle and your right hand on the ground.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.000
You have been given vibrated water,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.500
add little vibrated sugar and mix it with spoon

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.600
then put two drops in your eyes.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.500
You can also add rose water to both [vibrated water and sugar] and put it in your eyes.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.400
And keep your eyes closed for a while.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.500
When the water comes out, everything will be fine.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.800
You can also add honey instead of sugar.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.700
Vibrate honey instead of sugar.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.300
Put it on your eyes and leave it for a while.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.900
After a while, the water will come out of your eyes.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.900
Then wash it with vibrated water added to Rose water.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The radiance of your eyes will improve.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.700
If you are above 50 years of age,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.400
your eyes will remain as they are, they won’t deteriorate nor improve

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.500
They will remain as they are.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.700
And this weakness comes from eating too much fish.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.700
Fish has phosphorus.  Phosphorus burns in our back Ajnia,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.400
hence the problem.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.100
So eat a little less fish.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.900
It will be difficult for the Bengalis.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.600
Mother, should we do this before going to bed?

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.000
Yes, do it anytime.  Do it in the morning or at bedtime.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.850
At first, it is better to do it 2 times a day.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.600
Even those who have good eyes can do this.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.600
Their eyes will not deteriorate so quickly.
