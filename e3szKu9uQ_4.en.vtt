00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.520
You see, in Sahaja Yoga, you are not
given any mantra or anything.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:25.004
There’s no, nothing like giving you
into a big course,

00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:29.293
like teaching you one after another any
mantra, or anything, it’s not like that.

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:33.262
What you have to know: where
the Kundalini is, how it is moving,

00:00:33.462 --> 00:00:37.503
where it is, what is the chakra catching
and what is the mantra for that.

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:40.291
It doesn’t take anything, hardly
it takes about a week

00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:42.308
for you to understand the whole thing.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.136
But gradually, as you start using it,
you become proficient

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:48.236
and you know how to do it for yourself
and for others.

00:00:48.437 --> 00:00:54.493
There is not much of a thing - like
a child, when he comes up a little age,

00:00:54.694 --> 00:01:00.916
he starts picking up language, because he
has a built-in capacity to create sounds.

00:01:01.117 --> 00:01:04.354
And he does it. In the same way,
once you get it,

00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:09.572
when you get the cool breeze in your hand,
you learn it by using it,

00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:14.440
you understand it yourself, you become
yourself quite proficient.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.392
And you will be amazed how fast
you’ll learn this thing.

00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:21.479
You don’t have to learn it just like
a science book or anything.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.049
You just start learning, you can:
this is the chakra which is catching

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.861
because now, say, for example,
this chakra is catching, right side.

00:01:28.062 --> 00:01:30.900
Now, there’s a mantra for this is
of Shri Krishna.

00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:37.199
Say, this chakra is catching, here,
then there’s a mantra of Jesus Christ.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.558
Like that, you must know the mantras
and the chakras.

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:44.996
But the chakras you just know as a,
absolutely, a knowledge

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:49.620
which is built in your nerves:
you just feel it.

00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:52.218
This is - now this gentleman is saying:
“It’s hot here”.

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:54.835
Alright, what is that? Hot here
means what?

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:59.920
That the Sahastrara, at the left side. First
it was the Sahastrara on the right side.

00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:03.717
Now, on the left side is there. So that
means there is a mantra for that,

00:02:03.918 --> 00:02:08.100
and that one must be used. If you use
that mantra, this will be cleared out.

00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:11.827
Alright? That is how you have
to know.

00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:16.093
And that’s why I said it takes time
for people sometimes to establish,

00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:19.810
because first you have to know it
and then use it.

00:02:21.682 --> 00:02:25.026
Seeker: I have a question about mantras.

00:02:25.227 --> 00:02:28.914
Shri Mataji: Mantras, yes. Now, we have
got different centers

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:32.102
and all these centers have got
different deities.

00:02:32.303 --> 00:02:36.008
As I told you Lord Jesus Christ is here,
Moses is here,

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.099
Krishna is here, we have a chart of that.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.755
Now, on different chakras we have
different deities -

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:45.912
come forward. You come forward
and he’ll see, alright?

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:49.543
Seeker: Now I can see, thank you again.
Shri Mataji: Alright,

00:02:49.744 --> 00:02:53.504
just let him see. Let… you, you can
pass it on. You can… somebody…

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:55.840
Warren: Maybe there’s another chart, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Another chart, alright.

00:03:11.016 --> 00:03:13.229
We have books. You see, why not give
them books?

00:03:13.446 --> 00:03:15.636
Warren: Their books are with them, Mother,
they could have the other book.

00:03:15.837 --> 00:03:20.412
Shri Mataji: Open the books. You have got
the chart in the books. Can you see?

00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:25.056
These are small books just meant
for the beginners, you see?

00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:29.229
Now here, this is all given in short.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.116
Now this is the chart you have to follow.
(To a yogi:) You can pass it on to people.

00:03:34.317 --> 00:03:36.583
Warren: If you didn’t get one, just take
another one now.

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:40.507
You can follow it through. Pass some
outside through the window, please.

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:44.093
Shri Mataji: Give this to that gentleman,
also, he wanted – ah, you have got.

00:03:44.294 --> 00:03:48.753
Seeker: I got it here, yes.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. You also take.

00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:54.157
Now, so the mantras are according
to the chakra that is in problem.

00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:57.258
Supposing your Nabhi chakra is not
alright, alright?

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.579
And if you start saying the mantra
of this one is no use.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.454
So you must know what center is catching
from your fingers.

00:04:04.655 --> 00:04:08.047
Now you can make out here in this chart,
if you see,

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:13.899
on this side we have got written
the numbers according to the centers,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.266
on this side, if you see it clearly?

00:04:17.467 --> 00:04:20.188
Now these are the numbers of the centers.
Alright?

00:04:20.388 --> 00:04:27.032
So then, and also here it is written in this
chart what are the different deities.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:31.344
Now, all these deities should be first
understood where are they,

00:04:31.545 --> 00:04:34.271
and when you have to say the mantras,
what you have to do

00:04:34.472 --> 00:04:40.570
is to coin it into a proper Sahaja Yoga
mantra – have you given that?

00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:43.469
Warren: It’s not in these books, Mother, no. 
Shri Mataji: Hm. But they will tell you.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.961
The pattern has to be like this which says,

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:51.842
whatever is the thing is, is woven
into the complete –

00:04:52.043 --> 00:04:55.256
I mean, you are to be recommended,
isn’t it, somebody has to say.

00:04:55.457 --> 00:05:02.366
So you have to say that I am the One
who has given you this knowledge.

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:05.116
So just you have to use that particular
thing

00:05:05.317 --> 00:05:07.820
which they will give you the pattern,
which is very simple.

00:05:08.271 --> 00:05:18.904
OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT

00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:26.843
SHRI GANESHA SAKSHAT

00:05:27.044 --> 00:05:34.473
SHRI ADI SHAKTI MATAJI

00:05:34.674 --> 00:05:40.121
SHRI NIRMALA DEVYAI

00:05:40.364 --> 00:05:45.436
NAMO NAMAHA

00:05:46.238 --> 00:05:52.410
And you have to use these, these names
of these deities,

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:57.044
different deities accordingly. And gradually
you’ll be amazed that it will work out.

00:05:57.261 --> 00:06:01.904
But when you come here, they will tell you,
it’s very simple, it’s very simple.

00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:06.568
But you must know where the chakras are.
First of all, you must become sensitive.

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:10.498
So I would suggest that you must start
using olive oil

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.951
for your fingers and for your toes,
you see.

00:06:14.152 --> 00:06:17.248
Rub it nicely, make your fingers sensitive.

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.412
Because of various things our hands
have become gross, you see.

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:26.191
To feel it better, use some nice olive oil,
massage it nicely,

00:06:26.392 --> 00:06:29.816
and sometimes if you wear the gloves
in the night they can soften it also.

00:06:30.017 --> 00:06:32.629
You must soften. Soft hands are better.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.504
And the nails should not be very long,
nor very badly cut sort of thing, you see,

00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:40.832
and they are to be properly done. So that
when you use on others

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:43.504
they should not feel hurt with your nails.

00:06:43.705 --> 00:06:47.246
But for yourself also you should not have
very – right hand specially -

00:06:47.447 --> 00:06:50.973
because you’ll have to use it like this
here, where you have a Vishuddhi chakra.

00:06:51.174 --> 00:06:53.629
Then you’ll have to use your Nabhi chakra
like that.

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:59.027
So what actually is the matter with you
is to be first realized.

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:04.144
So first you have to understand yourself.
What is your problem,

00:07:04.345 --> 00:07:08.285
what you are suffering from, and then
how to correct it.

00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:13.223
If you could find out how to correct it
and what is your problem,

00:07:13.424 --> 00:07:20.857
then it is the easiest thing is to coin
a mantra to improve yourself. Alright?

00:07:21.058 --> 00:07:24.283
It’s very simple. Now you have met
Me only

00:07:24.484 --> 00:07:27.806
a day back, I should say, but you’ll be
amazed the knowledge

00:07:28.007 --> 00:07:31.058
that you will have now about yourself
will be tremendous.

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:34.402
So first is Self-realization. Means you
know yourself.

00:07:34.603 --> 00:07:37.309
Once you know yourself you start knowing
others.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.918
Because we are all collectively conscious.

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:43.667
Those who are realized souls become
aware of others.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:49.442
For this, when you meditate, you find out,
first of all, what is the matter with you.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.886
But not mentally you resolve it, through
your vibrations and mantras.

00:07:54.087 --> 00:07:57.840
Mantras are very important for Sahaja
Yogis.

00:07:58.517 --> 00:08:06.098
If these mantras could be said, loudly
is better in the beginning.

00:08:07.798 --> 00:08:11.326
That is why, in privacy, you can do
all these things,

00:08:11.527 --> 00:08:14.905
in your room you can work it out.

00:08:15.746 --> 00:08:19.780
You just take a proper place to sit down,
keep the photograph before you

00:08:19.981 --> 00:08:23.811
and just feel your vibrations, where are
you catching.

00:08:24.726 --> 00:08:27.400
Alright. Then you know how to remove
your catches.

00:08:27.601 --> 00:08:31.493
Without thinking, try to do that. Then say
the mantras

00:08:31.694 --> 00:08:33.957
on different chakras, wherever you are
catching, first of all.

00:08:34.158 --> 00:08:37.066
First of all ascertain them, need not say
all the mantras.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:40.473
Only say the mantras in that part,
with your heart.

00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:45.520
Those who think that by saying mantras
morning till evening

00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:50.684
they are going to achieve much, they are
sadly mistaken; it's all mechanical then.

00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:56.387
So many people have a habit of all the time
shouting mantras. It's not a habit.

00:08:56.588 --> 00:09:00.377
Mantras should open your chakras, otherwise
it has no meaning.

00:09:00.578 --> 00:09:04.908
They should be used properly at key points,

00:09:05.109 --> 00:09:08.673
with great respect, with a great
understanding,

00:09:08.874 --> 00:09:13.754
and then allow them to open your chakras,
by which

00:09:13.955 --> 00:09:19.440
you take the water in of that great thing
known as Kundalini.

00:09:19.641 --> 00:09:21.256
May God bless you.
