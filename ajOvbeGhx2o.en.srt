1
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:14,117
This felicitation function is little embarrassing for Me

2
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:26,033
because I was born as a very simple person

3
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:35,075
and I have been an extremely simple person. I don't understand money.

4
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:45,492
I don't understand hatred. I don't understand greed. I'm so simple about it.

5
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:51,575
Despite that, you people came and got your Realization.

6
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:59,825
It's your own achievement. It's your own desires that you have achieved.

7
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:08,534
I find so many children nowadays born as realized souls.

8
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:12,534
So I think the time is also there,

9
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:21,700
that at My life, in My life itself, this was to happen.

10
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:24,825
It is everybody's lot.

11
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:33,825
I think, like Shri Rama, then came Shri Krishna, then came Jesus, then other people.

12
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:41,700
It was their time. And My time it is to give you all Realization.

13
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:49,200
But, I must say, you all have taken it very heartily,

14
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:55,367
sweetly, and are using your powers

15
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,991
to give love to others and to transform others.

16
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:08,534
The other day, I was talking about love. Now the love, as it is understood,

17
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:13,950
is in your heart as this, but do you know the ocean of love

18
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:19,409
is your Sahasrara.  When your Sahasrara is filled with love,

19
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:28,200
then the life is changed. You don't become a very intelligent man,

20
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:37,409
very dynamic personality,but you are nothing but love

21
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,450
and this love is so self-satisfying.

22
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:49,659
You are not bothered if others don't love you or they love you. You don't see to that part.

23
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:55,200
What you see is the enjoyment from that love.

24
00:02:55,242 --> 00:03:00,991
It's a tremendous ocean of love. You all have got it.

25
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:09,908
And once you have entered into Sahaja Yoga, you know that you have entered into Sahasrara

26
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:19,617
and Sahasrara is the, I tell you, the source of all the truth.

27
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:25,409
Truth is there, the complete truth.

28
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:34,200
Truth is the knowledge and also the truth is love.

29
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,033
If you love somebody, you know the truths about that person.

30
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:48,699
You find out whether the person is good or bad or anything. It's very difficult.

31
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:56,783
But if you love that person, then immediately know what's wrong with that person,

32
00:03:56,825 --> 00:04:01,534
what's right from that person. But because of your love,

33
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:08,991
you encompass the whole atmosphere between you and him

34
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:11,534
or between you and others.

35
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:17,741
You don't see the bad points easily, very difficult.

36
00:04:17,783 --> 00:04:22,534
I've been many a times, people say, cheated by others. Agreed,

37
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:32,866
but I have no sense of what cheating means, how people cheat you.

38
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:35,908
Many a times, people say that they are talking ill about Me.

39
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,866
Yes, they are. I can see they are talking, doesn't matter.

40
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:46,242
Makes no difference to Me. If they're taking ill of Me, it's all right.

41
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:50,699
But this felicitation embarrasses Me definitely

42
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:56,741
because I've not done anything so extraordinary, as they think.

43
00:04:56,783 --> 00:05:02,741
Extraordinary is that whatever capacity you have,

44
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:08,075
if it acts, then it is there, like love.

45
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:14,617
I have tremendous love, I don't know what to say. And it acts. It works.

46
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:18,699
And every human being cares for love.

47
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:22,117
You may be very great, you might be very intelligent,

48
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:28,158
you may be earning lots of money, whatever it is. It's not so important.

49
00:05:28,158 --> 00:05:35,575
What is the most important thing is that you are loved.

50
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:41,825
This is, I have not made a theory out of it or I am not going to say that you all should learn it,

51
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:48,242
but it's so basic and that's the only thing that helps.

52
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:56,699
So residing in the Sahasrara, if you see the waves of love flowing,

53
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,200
maybe some people might take advantage of it, it doesn't matter,

54
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:08,367
makes no difference. Some people can also mislead you.

55
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,492
It's all right. All kinds of things they do;

56
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:20,242
but when there is love, you see, you are satisfied, you are not bothered,

57
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:22,950
because you love everyone.

58
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:30,908
So you are satisfied. You are not bothered as to what others, they are doing to you,

59
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,200
what advantage they're taking of you, what they are troubling you

60
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:39,492
or all these also felicitations, how they have done,

61
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:44,950
also all the facilities that you have from your own being,

62
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,117
are automatic.

63
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:52,534
This felicitations and all that, of course, reflects you, no doubt,

64
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:55,367
but to Me, it is nothing great.

65
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:59,367
I don't think it is a very great achievement for Me

66
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:04,575
because I have no vision, as such, I must tell you. I've heard this word,

67
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:07,283
that Mother has a vision. No, no, no, no,

68
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:09,283
I have no vision, I must tell you.

69
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:14,283
My simple thing is that everybody must love,

70
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:19,283
and a pure love will change your lives,

71
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:23,409
it will change the whole world, no doubt about it.

72
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,033
It should come to you natural

73
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:31,367
because now you have pierced through your Sahasrara.

74
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:39,950
So for every Sahaja Yogi, love should be very, very natural thing, absolutely.

75
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:46,033
For example, I know sometimes people are very rude.

76
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:49,699
They have certain rules and regulations

77
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:57,033
and then they get very angry with the other people or whatever it is.

78
00:07:57,075 --> 00:08:01,325
Some people have positions and they use their position to get angry with others

79
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:06,699
and even to get after that person and torture another person,

80
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:13,950
they do, go on doing like this. But they have missed the point. They have missed the point.

81
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:23,075
If you just have love, that pure love, then you see the point.

82
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:29,866
You see it, that 'Yes, yes, that's what he is doing, that's why he's — .'

83
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:34,950
You know that. But you are not bothered, 'Why he is doing like me,'

84
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:39,158
why is he troubling you and gradually, everything nullifies.

85
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,741
Everything finishes off by itself.

86
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:48,825
I've seen many people who are talking ill about Me,

87
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:53,200
doing all kinds of things against Me. So what? Let them do.

88
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,617
That's their job. Let them do; but to Me, it doesn't disturb, you know.

89
00:08:58,617 --> 00:09:03,075
I think they are indulging into something of their own style,

90
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:09,783
but what do you get? Joy comes only out of pure love.

91
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:14,117
If you have no pure love, you cannot have joy.

92
00:09:14,158 --> 00:09:18,075
Talking that we are very joyous and all that,

93
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:22,283
I know who are joyous really and who are not.

94
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:27,158
You cannot artificially say that 'I am joyous.'

95
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,575
It should be some sort of an innate, spontaneous feeling within.

96
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:42,409
So you are the ocean of feelings, ocean of beautiful feelings.

97
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:51,033
And when you are enriched by that ocean, you are least bothered about anything.

98
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:54,699
You know very well that I am very bad at money.

99
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:58,908
I don't understand. I cannot count money. So what?

100
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,575
I mean, that's My handicap, I should say,

101
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:06,991
but it doesn't matter. What is so needed is

102
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:17,783
'Can you feel the love of others? Can you feel the sweetness of others?'

103
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,741
As you see a little child, how nice you feel.

104
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:25,741
In the same way, 'Do you feel that for others?'

105
00:10:25,783 --> 00:10:33,617
or 'Are they like children? Are they innocent like children?'

106
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:40,825
And the now, I would suggest that innocence is the sign of love.

107
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:48,659
Anybody who has innocence would know the technique of love.

108
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:54,242
If you are very clever, intelligent, you can answer back,

109
00:10:54,283 --> 00:11:02,783
you can correct people, do that. No. That's not the way. If you have love,

110
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:07,700
you can correct people without saying anything to them,

111
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:12,825
because love is a supreme intelligence.

112
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:20,492
It gives you all the correct method. It works out that.

113
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:25,409
The whole thing works out that and then people say,

114
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:27,492
'Mother, it's a miracle how it has happened.'

115
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:31,866
No, no, it's no miracle.It's simple thing that love

116
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:35,866
has acted in its own way. Love is not a dead thing.

117
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:41,825
It's not a dead sea. It not only thinks, but it acts

118
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:45,741
and acts so beautifully.

119
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:49,492
Sometimes I'm amazed at its working.

120
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:53,699
We call it a miracle, this, that. Nothing — it's love.

121
00:11:53,699 --> 00:12:00,575
Now, because the Divine loves you, it gives you miracles, so called.

122
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:03,075
It can do anything

123
00:12:03,117 --> 00:12:08,242
because the Divine wants that you should get to Sahaja Yoga

124
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:11,200
and you should become a real yogi.

125
00:12:11,242 --> 00:12:17,659
So whatever this love does, you think it's miracle.

126
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:22,534
It is not. Why people say, 'Mother, that's your style.'

127
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,450
It's not question. It's a question of love.

128
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:31,575
Say, I love everyone very much, I trust everyone very much.

129
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:38,950
I never doubt, to begin with, and they are sinking, sinking,

130
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:43,409
but still I have faith that they'll come round, that they'll be all right.

131
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,699
Give them a chance. But supposing they try some tricks,

132
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:52,075
you'll be amazed how they get exposed.

133
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:56,825
How they get exposed, it's very surprising.

134
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:02,617
We have a Sahaja Yogi in Dubai. He told Me,

135
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:05,908
'Mother, no use giving Realization to these big people.'

136
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,575
I say, 'Why?' So he gave Me the name of very highly

137
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:14,575
spiritual people accepted by society.

138
00:13:14,617 --> 00:13:17,825
'I gave him Realization and he got exposed.

139
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:21,866
I don't know, I never said anything — got exposed.'

140
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:28,283
Another person whom he gave Realization, also had a very big thing,

141
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:35,117
having lots of awards and this and that, he got exposed.

142
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:42,866
And he gave Realization to one fellow who had peace award.

143
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:53,283
He also got exposed. And then it was in the newspaper all about him.

144
00:13:53,325 --> 00:14:00,866
Now what is happening is that this man, out of love for the other one, gives them Realization,

145
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:07,158
but that same love acts in such a manner that he gets exposed.

146
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,075
You don't want to expose people.

147
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:14,659
You want that somehow they'll come to Sahaja Yoga all right, it's all right working out.

148
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:19,866
So he said, 'Mother, I don't think I'll give Realization to anyone.'

149
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:24,492
I said, 'See, you go on giving.

150
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:29,575
If the Divine wants that the person should be exposed, he will be exposed.'

151
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:35,033
If there is anything wrong with that person, he'll be exposed.

152
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:39,200
Somebody who gets Realization, supposing,

153
00:14:39,242 --> 00:14:44,991
and he meets with an accident, of course he'll be saved,

154
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:49,699
but he might meet with an accident.

155
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:53,783
So what is the reason why? Why did he meet with the accident?

156
00:14:53,825 --> 00:15:02,450
Because he doesn't do anything for Sahaja Yoga. He's very ambitious.

157
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:11,492
Somebody who's very sick, he's all right with Sahaja Yoga

158
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:17,659
and somebody who's not that sick, gets much worse. It's a fact.

159
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:23,367
Though he's protected — that's one thing about Sahaj Yoga,

160
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:28,033
you may be the worst Sahaja Yoga, you are protected, no doubt, but if you go on like that,

161
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:37,617
if you all the time trying to go against Sahaja

162
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:43,409
and become asahaj, then you suffer very badly.

163
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:50,242
It's very simple that if you are standing in a place, you are established in a place,

164
00:15:50,283 --> 00:16:02,950
which is very peaceful, very joy-giving, but you want to get out of it,

165
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:08,699
so you face whatever is outside, it's automatic.

166
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:19,242
If you stand in the place which is so peaceful, which is joyous, which is full of love,

167
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:24,117
you are all right, you'll grow in spirituality.

168
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:28,783
But if you want to get out of it, then you have it.

169
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:39,659
You can't help it. It's like a fortress or we can call a very secluded place,

170
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:50,409
which very comfort and very much full of attention and all that

171
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:56,283
and then you want to go out of the attention. So, you're gone.

172
00:16:56,325 --> 00:17:00,908
That's how some Sahaja Yogis don't understand

173
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,492
why they are not yet getting into Sahaj Yoga.

174
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:13,409
So no use using your intelligence because this intelligence, human intelligence,

175
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,866
is not a very high quality function.

176
00:17:16,908 --> 00:17:23,242
What is best is to fall in love with your Self

177
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:36,950
love which is divine, love which is nourishing, love that looks after you.

178
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:40,783
But we don't know how to look after ourselves.

179
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:46,325
We don't know how to love ourselves. We love this person, love that person,

180
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:53,242
but what about yourself? Then they think it is selfishness — no, not at all.

181
00:17:53,242 --> 00:18:02,158
To know the Self is love. If you know the Self, you'll know love,

182
00:18:02,158 --> 00:18:05,117
you'll fall into the ocean of that love.

183
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:08,783
But that is what is My experience, I'm telling,

184
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:11,783
and you all should experience the same love.

185
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,950
Just watch yourself.

186
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:24,283
It's very simple to introspect, 'Do I have love within me, fully?'

187
00:18:24,325 --> 00:18:28,575
Partly it is love, partly no.

188
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:32,450
Now love can be very much bounded

189
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:36,866
also like 'we love our country', say India.

190
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,699
If we love our country, so we may think

191
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,575
all Indian things are good.

192
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:45,117
We'll never talk ill about our country.

193
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:50,699
Anybody says anything about India, against, we'll hate that person.

194
00:18:50,700 --> 00:19:01,866
It's with everyone. You love your country. Also you love, say,

195
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:07,617
your parents, love anybody. But is a limited love.

196
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:13,242
It's a bounded love. Love should be just opened.

197
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:19,534
Then you will see where do you stand as far as your country's concerned,

198
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:25,659
as far as your relationships are concerned. You will know everything.

199
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:30,783
You need not harm, you need not say anything, you need not quarrel, fight,

200
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:35,075
but you will know -- because love gives you knowledge,

201
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:39,409
complete knowledge about the person.

202
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:44,700
You know the person, what he's up to, what he's doing,

203
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:50,741
but you don't mind because you love that person.

204
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:53,825
So you don't mind. 'All right, so ahead.'

205
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:57,617
It's like a little child. It's going on the wrong way. Let it go.

206
00:19:57,617 --> 00:20:02,242
Now with all these things, whatever you wear,

207
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:07,409
you are very lucky people who have reached Sahasrara

208
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,908
and that you all know everything about Sahaj Yoga.

209
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:19,617
But without practising Sahaja Yoga, you cannot work it out

210
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:24,450
because then, by practising it, you know about your Self.

211
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:31,950
When you meditate, you know your Self and then you get just filled with love.

212
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:37,033
But now, while sitting, you just start thinking,

213
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:42,950
'He's a very bad man. I hate him' — this thing. All such stupid ideas come into your head,

214
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:48,699
or 'I must buy this ornament' or 'I must buy this particular car'

215
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,699
and all that, then you are not loving.

216
00:20:53,741 --> 00:21:02,283
But if you love, then what happens is that whatever you need, you get.

217
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:05,283
Whatever you want, you get.

218
00:21:05,283 --> 00:21:09,283
You have to first love yourself,

219
00:21:09,283 --> 00:21:18,200
but that love should be pure love. As a result of that, you'll cleanse yourself.

220
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:23,908
Sometimes you are so much identified with your temperaments,

221
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,699
with your nature, with you personality, whatever it is,

222
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:30,950
but then you realize, in that love,

223
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,242
that 'This is not love. This is blind.'

224
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:39,659
Love gives you a complete idea about yourself.

225
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:46,991
'What am I? What problems I have?

226
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:53,492
Why do I create problems?  Why do I get into problems?'

227
00:21:53,534 --> 00:22:00,700
You'll be amazed that love has such a powerful light in it,

228
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:07,033
that it is the truth and it is the knowledge.

229
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:12,450
Though I don't know if I am to blame anyone in this world

230
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:20,075
who are not a realized soul, I will not -- and a fully realized soul, I will not --

231
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:27,325
because there is no light in their life.They can't see themselves

232
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:31,492
and they can't see others. So what's the use of blaming them,

233
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:37,783
blaming this community, that community or this country or that country? What is the use?

234
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:50,950
And this love is universal. It has nothing to do with any particular type

235
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:55,033
or particular style. It's universal.

236
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:58,700
That is why Sahaja Yoga is universal.

237
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:05,242
It is spreading everywhere. I want you to enjoy that love.

238
00:23:05,242 --> 00:23:10,950
Only example I'll give you, a grandmother and a grandchild.

239
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:18,534
They have a relationship — at least in India, I know. of tremendous love.

240
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:26,075
For them, the grandchild is everything and the grandmother is everything.

241
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:31,825
They just love each other. Whatever the grandchild may do,

242
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:34,699
whatever the grandmother may do, it's all right.

243
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:40,075
It's a kind of a tremendous experience of elivage (elevation).

244
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:46,492
You feel elevated and you enjoy that love.

245
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:51,950
If there is no purity in love, you can never, never enjoy love.

246
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:59,659
So I would request you to find out that ocean in your head

247
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:05,950
in the Sahasrara, which is being filled by your heart.

248
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:14,991
Do you know Heart and Sahasrara are very much in relationship with each other?

249
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:25,450
Their style is such that if somebody's head is not all right, the heart won't be all right.

250
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:29,492
If the heart is not all right, his head won't be all right.

251
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:33,617
But is more reflection from the head to the heart.

252
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:40,700
They say that thereґs genes are bad or this, nothing of the kind.

253
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:45,242
After Sahaja Yoga, your genes are changed

254
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:55,450
you are changed; everything is changed now. So your brain is filled with nothing but light.

255
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:02,534
Your heart is filled with light and you are just

256
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:06,866
bouncing with love, all the time with humour,

257
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:11,699
with loving care. Every day, I mean, it's so different.

258
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:21,158
But that you have achieved now. Now you have got it. So just enjoy that.

259
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:29,659
Then the caste system and the fundamentalism, that, the greed and jealousies

260
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:35,534
and competition an all, they all drop, useless things.

261
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:43,409
But if you have the jungle of nonsense in your mind,

262
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,492
then all kinds of animals can creep in.

263
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:55,908
To purify yourself with love, cleanse yourself with love.

264
00:25:55,908 --> 00:26:05,409
Look at every position, everything, with love and you will be amazed how you will find it easier

265
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,617
not to dominate, not control, not to despise,

266
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:18,908
not to say things which are not(?) wrong. It's such a correcting thing, love is,

267
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:28,575
extremely correcting and extremely joy-giving that you will be amazed at yourself,

268
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:30,783
how you are managing things.

269
00:26:30,783 --> 00:26:35,825
I knew of many like that.

270
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:42,783
There was a Sahaja Yogi who never used to talk to his own uncle, never.

271
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:51,033
And he said, 'Somehow, I hate him.' 'But why?' 'I don't know why, I hate him.'

272
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:59,783
And then he went to a race course and there he saw his uncle coming.

273
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:02,617
He rushed and he just hugged him.

274
00:27:02,617 --> 00:27:09,699
Uncle started looking, 'Now what does he want? Why is he doing? What is it?' in his mind.

275
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:15,575
'Why is he wanting to love me like this?' He couldn't understand.

276
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:26,659
When it happened, you know, that he couldn't explain that he'd become a Sahaja Yogi or anything.

277
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:31,699
So the uncle asked, 'What do you want now?' He said,

278
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:34,325
'Nothing. I love you, that's all.'

279
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:45,033
It's such a nice thing to do it. It's such a nice thing to say.

280
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:54,158
There should be no greed in it, no -- any plan behind it,

281
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:01,534
just it's a feeling of an ocean which touches every shore

282
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:08,367
and there it makes a sound, beautiful sound of love.

283
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:19,492
And then the waves return back. Continuously it is flowing and continuously it is working out, never tired.

284
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:25,866
I know in the Kali Yuga, to be born and to do this work

285
00:28:25,908 --> 00:28:30,991
is a very difficult task, but, to Me, it was not.

286
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:33,200
Whatever happened,

287
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:36,450
whatever people troubled Me, howsoever,

288
00:28:36,492 --> 00:28:47,283
I was working it out, out of this flow of love. Went round every place,

289
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,741
wherever is possible, whenever it is possible,

290
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:54,158
whatever may be My health or anything,

291
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,741
I was least bothered and I have enjoyed all of you very much. I have enjoyed.

292
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:03,617
There have been one or two horrible people -- doesn't matter.

293
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:10,075
So when you have — saying all these things about Me, only tears come into My eyes.

294
00:29:10,075 --> 00:29:16,741
I don't know what else to say. I mean, it is something I would like you to do,

295
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:21,908
you to get it, this kind of life where you just flow with your love.

296
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,534
May God bless you very much.
