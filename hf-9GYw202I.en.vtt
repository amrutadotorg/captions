00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
Gregoire: Dnyaneshwar was the foundation.

00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:07.366
Of course, what was meant at that
time was to establish dharma above all,

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:10.300
was not to give realisation, but establish dharma

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.345
by expressing human values

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.980
in the perspective of the spiritual absolute,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.500
so that should every human behaviour
should be kept in check by the spiritual finality.

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:28.300
Now, Saint Dnyaneshwar is an
absolutely extraordinary person.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.940
He died at the age of about 21 years old,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.140
and after having left behind him a
book which is called Jnāneshvari,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.106
who is basically a commentary
of the Bhagavad Gita in Sanskrit.

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:48.180
He - I want to go quickly
through the family story,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.811
but again, they were really
treated as outcasts because

00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:56.860
his father had left his wife to take to Sanyaza,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.259
and his guru sent him back to married life.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.555
So after that, the Brahmins didn't want at all

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:08.260
to have anything to do with a Brahmin
who had gone back to family life.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.419
So they were treated like
dirt by all the Brahmins,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.381
but they were, I don't know,
three brothers and two sisters,

00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:22.340
and they were all very highly realised souls, and actually
his brother got his initiation and gave it to him.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.595
Now, there are many miracles
in the life of Dnyaneshwar,

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:30.187
which are famous. For instance,

00:01:30.387 --> 00:01:37.434
while he was arguing with a couple of learned
pendants saying that God is everywhere and in everything,

00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:43.480
then they made a fool out of him, and they said, well, if God is everything and if the Vedas are everything, can you make this cow say the Vedas?

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.299
And he went to the cow, and buffalo, I
don't know, started reciting the Vedas.

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:52.827
And so, you know, I mean, he was rather good, huh.

00:01:53.858 --> 00:01:58.460
We can't do that yet.
Try on any buffalo, it won't work.

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:03.500
So another example, which is very sweet,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.780
there was one of these big ascetic, which came down to
their place because they started being famous, of course.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.220
And he came on the back
of a tiger trying to show off.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.860
And Dnyaneshwar was sitting on a rock, like
on a little wall with his brothers and sisters,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.980
and he said, oh, here's the great saint. I
don't know what he who is coming to visit us.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.757
Let's just pay our homage to the saint.

00:02:25.957 --> 00:02:31.380
And then the rock flew and they
all flew on the rock to meet the saint.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.332
And then when the saint on his poor tiger looked at
this, he was completely, you know, ruled over, I mean.

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:42.380
He realised it was rather smarter to
move on a on a wall than on a tiger.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.777
Then he prostrated himself before Dnyaneshwar.

00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:47.172
And Shri Mataji, when she commented on this,

00:02:47.373 --> 00:02:51.460
she said, this is Shri Hanumana who
is playing this trick. He carried the wall

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.780
because Shri Hanumana
is the master of the siddhis.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.898
That is, he's the master of
all the magic magical powers,

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.380
as you know, as he brought back the
whole mountain to cure Lakshmana.

00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:09.220
Now, just after this few
biographic notes, he died here.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.453
This is the place of the office, what we call
Maha-samadhi, when he departed his body,

00:03:13.653 --> 00:03:17.020
or Chaitanya Samadhi, because he left in meditation.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.839
He was deep into Nirikalpa Samadhi.
And in that consciousness, he left his body.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.180
So it's not when we, like when we die, we are kind
of thrown out of our body by Yama, the God of death,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.110
but these people, they just leave
the human kosha, the envelope.

00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:38.875
Now, just one thing you need
to know about his message.

00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:43.460
It's, I mean, of course, his
treatise of the, of the Gita

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.340
has helped extremely to understand what Lord Krishna
wanted, the message Lord Krishna wanted to pass.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.100
There is something very
beautiful, which I mentioned at the...

00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:00.380
Sahasrara Puja in Vienna.

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:03.247
And this is the following thing.

00:04:03.448 --> 00:04:11.100
As you know, Bhagavad Gita explained,
how Shri Krishna showed the Virata to Arjuna.

00:04:11.534 --> 00:04:18.450
And then when Arjuna sees whatever was
contained in Krishna, he panicked completely.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.420
He said, I mean, sorry, I really know. I mean,
please forgive me for calling you my friend.

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:29.180
Forgive me for joking with you, for eating
with you, for, I didn't know. Please forgive me.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.660
He got seized by this all.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.458
And yet, in his commentary of the Bhagavad Gita,

00:04:38.658 --> 00:04:44.590
Saint Dnyaneshwar says that in a
way, the daily form of Shri Krishna

00:04:45.205 --> 00:04:49.340
was greater than his Virata form,
which contains the whole universe,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.737
because only thanks to this daily form of his

00:04:53.937 --> 00:05:00.460
could he have this relationship
of friendship with his devotees.

00:05:00.912 --> 00:05:06.250
And the beauty of all this is
fully realised when you know

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.980
that Shri Jnaneshvara was nobody else,
but an ancient incarnation of Shri Vishnu.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.780
An ancient incarnation is,

00:05:19.045 --> 00:05:24.144
you know, if this is an incarnation,
okay, this is an incarnation,

00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:27.300
then an ancient incarnation is this.

00:05:27.923 --> 00:05:32.540
I mean, it's the same stuff,
but not the whole thing.

00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:37.740
But Shri Jnaneshvara was an incarnation,
an ancient incarnation of Shri Vishnu himself.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.260
So it was the same as Lord Krishna.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.780
So not only Lord Krishna gave the Gita, but he came
back as a Jnaneshvara to give the commentary of it,

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.173
which is really sweet.

00:05:50.413 --> 00:05:52.780
He didn't trust us.

00:05:53.295 --> 00:05:59.100
Rightly so, I suppose. But this is just a comment in
the Jnaneshvara, which I feel personally is beautiful,

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.864
because it's absolutely actual for us
Sahaja yogis, that Shri Mataji is here.

00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:11.140
She is Viratangana. She contains the whole deities,
the whole lokas, the whole universe, the whole Rudras.

00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:15.420
And yet she comes as this
extremely motherly form

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.793
with which some of us feel that
they can jest and joke sometimes.

00:06:20.993 --> 00:06:25.253
And you saw it at the puja in Nasik.

00:06:25.454 --> 00:06:29.300
I mean, she wasn't just chatting with
Warren, putting the plan for our moving.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.180
And this is that human form
which allowed us to be so close,

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.540
which was praised by Jnaneshvara.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.340
So I don't know whether I can render the
whole sweetness of the story of this long.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.340
It's a long love stories
between God and His devotees.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.900
And the Jnaneshvara explained it.

00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:50.900
So now Jnaneshvara means Jnana is knowledge.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.679
Ishvara is the Lord.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.940
So His very name means
He is the Lord of knowledge.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.900
He's the absolute Lord of knowledge.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.620
And you know Jnana, yoga is on the centre,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.060
Kriya yoga is on the right
and Bhakti yoga is on the left.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.180
So this is really the yoga of the
Sushumna, the yoga of knowledge.

00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:14.060
And He's the master of it. So while meditating
or while praying for His blessings here,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:22.900
we can address Him as the master of knowledge. And that
He should give us the true knowledge of the unconscious.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.259
That is not an accumulated knowledge
which is just a spontaneous intuition

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.140
brought in us by Shri Hanumana
himself of what is the right thing to do,

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.340
what is the right thing to know at the right time.

00:07:36.508 --> 00:07:40.820
And I'm very happy that you all
have the opportunity to visit this place

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:46.740
because like the ashram of Tukarama, it is one
of the milestones of spirituality in Maharashtra.

00:07:47.582 --> 00:07:50.782
For the reasons I just explained to you.

00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:40.860
So now what I suggest that we do what we did
the last time and this is [UNCLEAR aproduction].

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:43.672
[UNCLEAR Aproduction] means that

00:08:46.797 --> 00:08:50.379
I don't know exactly where the main entry of the temple, I think it's on the other side.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:56.130
But we start from here and the production means that we walk one after the other in silence

00:08:56.331 --> 00:09:01.740
three times around the temple
and then we'll gather in the temple

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:04.231
and we'll visit the place
where it took Maha-Samadhi.

00:09:04.431 --> 00:09:09.460
So you know to walk around is just a kind of

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.771
you can say it's another
form of expressing an artist.

00:09:13.972 --> 00:09:18.044
It's a form of expressing
respect. All right? All clear?

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:21.368
So we just walk one behind the
other, we just walk around the temple

00:09:21.568 --> 00:09:25.660
and everybody counted from this tree, walked three
times around it. All right?

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.020
Jay Shri Mataji And we do this in silence.

00:23:45.297 --> 00:23:50.811
Gavin: Where the imagine of Shri
Ganesha has appeared out of the earth.

00:23:51.011 --> 00:23:54.380
As a Swayambhu for by itself.

00:23:56.667 --> 00:23:59.580
And this village is called [UNCLEAR Taywa]

00:24:01.928 --> 00:24:06.860
And these swayambu rocks

00:24:08.933 --> 00:24:12.104
have the pure coefficient

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.180
of the deity of Sri Ganesha.

00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:18.340
And they have great protective powers,

00:24:19.492 --> 00:24:25.901
because as you know, he is the
one who overcomes all the obstacles.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:34.979
So these eight swayambus give the protection to the spiritual quality of Maharashtra.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.180
And make it a place of pilgrimage.

00:24:42.742 --> 00:24:47.281
So we are going to go into the temple in silence.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.740
And we take a few of the names of Shri Ganesha

00:24:53.382 --> 00:25:00.180
and ask for that innocence

00:25:00.733 --> 00:25:07.803
in its pure form to come as
a swayambu within each of us.

00:25:11.665 --> 00:25:16.180
As you know, one of the
commandments given to Moses

00:25:16.423 --> 00:25:20.940
was not to make any graven image of God,

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.591
nor to worship anything that
had been made by human hands.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:34.516
This image has been made by
the creator herself, the Mother Earth.

00:25:35.695 --> 00:25:41.940
And because of that,
it gives the real vibrations of pure innocence.

00:25:42.706 --> 00:25:46.140
And that is what we have
come to worship here today

00:25:46.495 --> 00:25:52.951
as another manifestation of Adi
Shakti's great love for her children.

00:25:53.287 --> 00:25:56.180
Jai Shri Mataji.
Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji.
