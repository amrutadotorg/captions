00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:08.270
I’m very happy to be here with you, after
such a long time and I missed you all very

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:30.819
much. I know you are very far away from the
rest of them but you are always in My heart

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:38.179
and you shouldn’t worry about the distance.
We have to realize that we have entered into

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:47.829
a new, a…. This kind of hands you should
[HAVE, HAND], not to hang, if you have to

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.829
sit properly. You have to understand that
we have now entered into the Kingdom of God

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.200
and our culture has to change, our style has
to change, our understanding has to change.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.619
Unless until we change, nobody’s going to
take us seriously.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.770
Moreover it’s very difficult to trigger
things if there’s no perfect instrument.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.710
As you know that I went to Russia second time
for the Yoga seminar, where we had people

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.710
from all over the Eastern Block. That was
My idea, to get them there. And they were

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.300
from every country, about two or three people,
only. And very strong, very deep, very understanding.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.170
I spoke hardly for 30 minutes and such a miracle,
in fifteen minutes I gave them Realization,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.180
about ten minutes and five minutes I was just
there, and all of them got practically Realization,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.540
all of them. Very surprising.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.710
And so deeply, when I walked out of the room,
they all came after Me. That you don’t see

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.670
in western countries, that kind of a thing.
All of them walked after Me, ran after Me,

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.790
they wanted to give their addresses and they
wanted Me to go to their country and this

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.230
and that. I said: “All right, I’ll come!”
We took their addresses, even from Romania,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.230
everywhere. And they went back. And within
8 days one could trigger out the thing. It

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.720
worked, because they were so deep, because
they were so much equipped to trigger the

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.990
happening. That’s how they triggered their
country and how they worked it out.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:56.990
So, if we live on a superficial level of Sahaja
Yoga, then we cannot do much for ourselves

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.510
nor for the country and it’s just a wasteful
life, neither here nor there. Is like a seed,

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.270
which is sprouted and has not grown into the
tree. So first of all we have to learn that

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.880
we have to become very deep people, very deep,
you must teach our depth. I’ve heard that

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.249
people come to Pujas and things and their
main interest is in food. As soon as the Puja

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:29.180
is over you just rush for food. How can you?
After Puja you get into a mood, after meditation

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.539
you get into a mood of meditating nature and
you just sit down and you can’t get up,

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.860
because you were fallen into the well and
sort of thing happens. How can you just get

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.069
up and walk for cakes or things. We though
can’t think about.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:51.050
So then judge yourself, how you are, how far
you are. You have to work out your vibrations

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.050
because you are going to create that beautiful
vision in this country, for your children,

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:08.249
for yourself and for the whole country, ultimately
for the whole world. But if you do not take

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.919
it up seriously, just by the way, Sahaja Yoga
is just by the way, it doesn’t work out.

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:19.610
It has to be way of life. And in everything
that you do it has to be a Sahaj culture.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.289
And in Sahaj culture so many things are to
be understood that this is natural, this is

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.909
real and we have to accept the way it is.

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:34.319
So many things are happening the West, which
I think are just destructive, absolutely destructive

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:41.319
to the society. The society is not at all
looked after, here. Maybe I would blame this

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:48.639
to the women of Australia and New Zealand,
that women are not understanding their responsibility

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.550
and do not understand what is their [GLORY],
also they have not self esteem. The other

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:05.020
day I was traveling by plane and most of the
ladies were smoking and men were not smoking.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.080
Men were looking after the children, the women
were busy smoking like men, you see, looking

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.659
like half men half women. It’s surprising,
this is very destructive.

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:20.499
Because as I have said that that men and women
are like two wheels of a chariot, one on the

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:25.159
left, one on the right. The left cannot go
to the right and right cannot go to the left.

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:31.699
So we have to understand that our role is
much more important than of the other. Like

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:37.039
the men have an important role, as well as
the women have even more important role. To

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:42.259
be a mother itself is a very big thing. Why
God has given you the motherhood? Because

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:48.400
God thinks you are like the Mother Earth,
that you look after, nourish the child, nourish

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:55.400
the family, do all these things. Don’t try
to follow the methods of men, like smoking,

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:58.599
drinking, behaving like them.

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.469
You just see the trend, how far it is going,
the self-esteem is so low. Now, for women,

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:10.469
the other day I was, I was telling you about
the way they are talking about sexy, sexy

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:18.180
women. I mean it’s…one should be ashamed
of saying such a thing for women. Because

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:22.009
one should take an objection: “We are not
prostitutes that every man should look at

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:29.009
us and enjoy us. Why? Are we sold out for
them or are we something for show?” The

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:35.460
women have no self-esteem, they fight on wrong
things, they don’t fight on the right things.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.990
The right is that you should be respected
and you should not be treated like something

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:45.740
on the show, that any man can look at you
and any, that the men should look at you,

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.199
then you have some value.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:54.199
It’s nonsense. This is not the way to make
great nations and great children and great

00:07:54.490 --> 00:08:01.490
families. So the society of any country depends
on the women, which is a very solid work,

00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:07.149
which is underground, they don’t want to
show off. Any country, which has got good

00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:13.860
women make good society. And I must say the
credit goes to Indian women, in India. They

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.539
have not bothered about these things, you
see, they are not bothered about their looks

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:22.430
and the sexy nonsense. If somebody says them:
“too sexy” I mean they will slap you,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.509
feel very hurt: “What is this, what do you
think us to be?” And to be proud of what

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:31.550
work you are doing, of course you have to
work outside and do something else, but who

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.470
will look after the children, who will manage
the households, who will keep the peace of

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.140
the house is to be seen.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:42.030
So in Sahaj culture one must understand that
women have to be women and men have to be

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:47.430
men. But men must learn to respect the women
as housewives. [THE AUSTRALIAN DOES] respect

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:52.890
them very much. If they do not respect their
women then also they will retaliate, they

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:58.260
will get rebellier and there is all this women’s
[REBELLION] that has started. Is the mistake

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.860
of men not the women so much, because they
have challenge their personality so much that

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.920
now they have started behaving like this.
So in Sahaja Yoga we respect the women, we

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.920
allow them their own freedom, we trust them
and we treat them equal. They have to be equal.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.080
They may not be similar but they are equal.
The both the wheels have to be equal otherwise

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.130
wheel, one is smaller, one is bigger, then
the chariot will never move forward, it will

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:28.850
go round and round and round. So that is to
be understood, that’s very much important

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:35.370
nowadays in the West because I find slowly
the derailment is towards hell. All these

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:41.430
thoughts are going to take people to nowhere
because nobody takes the responsibility of

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:48.430
molding a moral, creating moral values for
children. You have to give proper breeding.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:54.390
These days I find children are very undisciplined
here. Because we are afraid to face them.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.650
You have to face them and you have to tell
them that: “This is not so, you are Sahaja

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:03.750
Yogis and you have to behave like Sahaja Yogis.”
They have to be modest, they have to be humble.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:09.100
There should be a kind of an awe for parents.
If they don’t have that awe for their parents

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.330
how can they have awe for Me or for God? They
cannot. Whatever you may tell them they will

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:20.130
not have. If they have no awe at all for the
parents who are Sahaja Yogis that means these

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:25.070
children will become very ward like other
children and that is a very big risk you are

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.780
running because I am depending on the children
who are born Realized and I don’t want them

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:35.520
to go haywire because the parents have not
looked after them and faced them.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.390
So on the whole we must understand the role
of men and women and the respect that you

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:45.340
have to pay to each other. Now, if husband
is not respectful to woman then the children

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:51.990
will not be respectful to her and the whole
thing will be finished and that’s why there

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:57.310
is no domination of anyone as such, there
should not be any domination but everybody

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.810
has one’s own role and where the wife is
concerned she should take a decision, where

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.100
the man is concerned, he should take a decision
and one must respect it because these are

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.420
two different areas in which the man has to
live and the woman has to live.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.500
Wherever this balance goes out, it has gone
out in our country also we should say, in

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.480
India, I must say, there are now funny things
are happening thanks to the Muslims, who lived

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:25.130
there and had such an impact that we are having
dowry system and all kinds of other things

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.990
there we have. But also there are societies,
which are trying to work it out, they are

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.840
not Sahaja Yogis but work it out, they are
getting improved and they are trying to change

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.560
their ways and methods and this is coming
before the people to see that things should

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.410
be all right. But supposing the women would
have taken some sort of a weapon in their

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:47.980
hands and started beating all the men what
would have happened? You see, you are complementary

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.180
to each other.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:54.360
So must understand first of all, our role
in Sahaja Yoga that we have to establish our

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.420
self-esteem and we have to respect ourselves
and we have to respect others. Because you

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:06.420
are all saints and saints have to respect
people… I’ve been talking all the time.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:19.540
So you have to respect the saints that you
are a saint and another one is a saint. I

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:26.540
always give the example of Namadeva. Namadeva
was a tailor, the great poet and a great saint.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:35.540
And he went to see another one who’s name
was Gora Khumbar who was a potter. And when

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:42.090
he went to see him, Gora Khumbar was busy
knitting the clay to make the pots, see, just

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:48.570
with his feet he was knitting the clay. He
looked at him. When he looked at him, he just

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:55.570
stood thoughtless. And then the words he says
so beautiful, he said: “I have come to see

00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:03.550
the Nirakara, the Nirguna, the thought...the
formless, means the vibrations. I came to

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:09.390
see the vibrations but here it is in the form,
standing”.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:16.390
What an appreciation, what an adoration, from
one saint to another who have never seen the

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:24.470
other person. “But I see the whole of this
Nirakara, the Nirguna is in the form of you.”

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:33.200
Just think of it. And that is what we have
to be. But if we cannot trust other Sahaja

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.860
Yogis, we cannot love each other, we cannot
understand each other that means we are something

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:44.260
low, lower than others. Some people have a
habit of criticizing all the time: “This

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.240
is not all right”. They don’t see that
there’s something wrong with them within

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.900
themselves that they are criticizing others.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.940
So there’s no chance for criticizing in
Sahaja Yoga, first thing is that you should

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:59.190
see yourself what you are and where you stand
and how you are going to help yourself first

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:06.190
of all. Then you can help others. But there
is no need at all to put a critical eye on

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.990
others. Because then you become good for nothing,
you’ve done all the bad things, you see

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:17.100
all the bad things in other people and what
do you develop is a non-collective personality,

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:24.100
which is such a headache to us and ultimately
you have to go out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:31.580
As I said there are two forces that are working
in Sahaja Yoga. The first one is the one by

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:38.740
which you are attracted, is called as, is
called as the centripetal force, centripetal

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:58.800
force by which you are attracted and the another
force is, is called as the centrifugal force.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:06.340
Supposing you have a stone attached to a string,
and you move it with a speed, you see, so

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:12.870
you can keep it moving like that but as soon
as you release it a little bit it can go as

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:19.250
a tangent. In the same way there are two forces
by which one we are attracted towards Sahaja

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:26.250
Yoga, we keep one with it, we become part
and parcel of the whole, another one is by

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:33.770
which we go out. Now I find that going out
has become a very strong force. And I get

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:40.710
quite worried about it, not only that you
go out but you go out with very great problems.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:47.710
And this is what I’ve seen in
Australia very much working out.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:57.380
First of all if anybody says against Me or
Sahaja Yoga just close your eyes. Just say:

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.790
“We don’t want to hear anything against
it because we have been benefited by, we got

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:08.270
all the profits out of it and now you don’t
tell us anything. We don’t want to hear

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:14.170
it.” Just close your eyes and cover your
ears and say: “We don’t want to hear it”.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:19.430
But we had three cases now where people are
suffering from cancer or this or that, who

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:24.970
listened to this. The man who says may not
get it, he may not, but the one…because

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:29.760
he’s already out, but the one who’s a
Sahaja Yogi if he listens to this thing is

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:36.100
very dangerous and should not listen to anyone
like that, who talks ill about Me or about

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.090
Sahaja Yoga. This is one point we should understand.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:46.110
And then those who find faults with other
Sahaja Yogis are also in trouble. You shouldn’t

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:51.029
find faults with other Sahaja Yogis. If you
think there’s something wrong with any Sahaja

00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:56.700
Yogi you can go and tell the leader. If you
find anything wrong with the leader you are

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.779
welcome to write to Me, immediately. You must
write to Me. Is an important thing, because

00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:07.839
My relationship with you is tide. Leaders
are just a myth in a way because I just telephone

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:12.959
to them and tell them because I can’t telephone
to all of you. That’s all. But it’s a

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:19.959
myth. So anything that you want to do, you
must try to inform Me directly, if they are

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:27.790
very much hard on you, if they are arrogant,
if they are abusive, if they are taking out

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:34.000
money, anything you find that is not correct
you please let Me know. And immediately from

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000
your letter I will know what is the situation
is like and I will let you know what is wrong,

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:46.320
whether you are wrong or the leader is wrong.
But if you just don’t inform Me then I’ll

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.380
have to found out Myself. And by the time
I find out I find lots of harm is done.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.740
So best thing is that you should let me know.
Because now, today I’m here. Now I cannot

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:03.660
keep attention on Columbia where I’ve been,
I cannot keep attention on America, but when

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:09.150
I go there My attention is there. But if somebody
has any problem they should write to Me. Like

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:16.150
this I’ve seen we have got lots of problems
and many Sahaja Yogis have left Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:22.210
Because they never informed Me. I can’t
understand even now why did they not write

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:26.370
to Me, why did they not telephone to Me. But
for small things they will write, somebody’s

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:32.530
wife is sick, or somebody’s father in law
is in the hospital, or all nonsensical things,

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:37.140
like that they will write. But they will never
tell Me that there’s something is wrong

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:43.170
with the leader, till I discover it, till
the whole Sahaja Yoga is destroyed in that

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.040
particular city.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.590
So it’s my humble request that all of you
should know that I’m your Mother, directly.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:56.090
I’ve nothing to do with the leaders, as
far as you people are concerned. Any leader

00:18:56.090 --> 00:19:00.760
who is harsh on you, who’s troublesome to
you, who disciplines you too much, or tries

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:06.610
to put his ideas all the time on your heads,
or anything like that which you think is curving

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:11.900
your freedom of growth, you must write to
Me and you must know. This is no excuse to

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.920
say that the leader was like this, so [UNCLEAR]
or “We went away.” Why did you go away?

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.800
What was the need?

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:26.800
And this I find very common, specially in
Australians and New Zealanders. Either they

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:36.090
become just like complete slaves or they become
absolutely rebellious. There’s nothing in

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:44.830
between. So you have to know that if there
is anything that you find which is trying

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:49.790
to dominate you, you must let us know, and
I am always going to correct and tell them

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:55.220
on their faces, all the leaders, what I think
of them. Because they also know that I’m

00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:00.910
sitting down there to look after this. Of
course about leaders I’ve given them so

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:05.480
many times, so many lectures and things and
every time they come to Ganapatipule we try

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.350
to meet and talk about it and if there is
any problem you have to find it pointed out.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:15.440
But here I don’t know but in Australia,
specially, the thing what happened, whatever

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:21.270
the leaders were doing, the same thing penetrated
into many Sahaja Yogis and they became sort

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:28.270
of half leaders and they used to sort of dominate
people and say things which are not at all

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:37.580
Sahaj. Like last year was all right, before
that they started saying Australia is great,

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:43.860
we are the greatest thing, this, that, then
half of the Sahaja Yogis have left them. Talking

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:49.400
so big and bombastically, even the Indians
were surprised, they started looking at them

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.280
thinking what’s gone wrong with them. And
they reported to Me that: “They would not

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.390
listen to anyone, we told them that: ’Please,
better start, we have to go now’ they would

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:03.200
not listen. They said: ‘Our leader has to
tell us.’. They said: “Mother has said”.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.120
“Mother, no, our leader.”

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.500
So even the leaders had replaced Me completely
because of these few people who joined hands

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:17.500
with the others like. We can say, like the
bureaucracy of Russia. There is no bureaucracy,

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:23.179
there is no priesthood in Sahaja Yoga, everybody
is equally the same. They’re all saints,

00:21:23.179 --> 00:21:28.850
are to be respected and all the leaders must
respect you and understand you. Of course

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:35.230
if you have any problems on chakras that must
be told, that is their job and for that you

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.850
should be thankful. Instead of feeling bad
about it you should be thankful to them that:

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:45.020
“Yes, that is so and we‘ll try to correct
ourselves.”

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:50.170
Now the better part of it that now suddenly
I find there’s a big explosion of Sahaja

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:55.730
Yoga going on in various places where are
least expected like [UNCLEAR] and we have

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:02.559
other places like Turkey and Russia. It’s
something so remarkable is happening. So Sahaja

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:08.460
Yoga is taking its fruits well and maybe these
people might grow much faster so you have

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:13.210
to be careful, you should not be left behind.
Because there is one thing I’ve given an

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:19.820
indication, I don’t know if you have told
them, last, this Ganapatipule that there is

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.540
going to be another jump, another triggering.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:30.540
I always give the analogy of a air space,
you see, space craft, like we can say the

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:42.940
Sputnik or something, the principle of that,
same is applied to our evolution. Like first

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:50.220
is one container, which has three, four containers
in it. So the first container goes half way

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:57.800
and then an explosion takes place and then
the rest of it is thrown out. So the first

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:03.950
speed, that is the velocity that it has, gets
absolutely accelerated and goes with a much

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:09.260
greater speed. Then the second one explodes
and then the same thing happens, that’s

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:16.050
how the speed they ultimately they achieve
is very high up. In the same way I feel that

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:22.300
in Sahaja Yoga is now happening and is the
time for you to know there is going to be

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:27.590
another triggering. And that triggering you
have to catch up with. For that you should

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:34.590
be prepared, otherwise you will be left in
the container which is just not to be used

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.380
to it.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:41.110
So a new triggering, a new jumping out has
to be done and for that you have to hurry

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:46.570
up and there’s no time to be lost. So the
most important thing is that we should develop

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:53.570
ourselves into that capacity that we can jump
on to the new triggering that is going to

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.929
take place in Sahaja Yoga. So I have to warn
you though you are few you have to have a

00:23:58.929 --> 00:24:03.860
quality, quantity does not matter, because
so much of quantity might drop out. So the

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:09.380
thing is those who really want to ascent must
understand that we must meditate morning,

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:16.380
evening and we must be absolutely collective.
If we are not collective then there’s something

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:22.110
serious with us, something wrong with us and
we have to correct it. So these are the things

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:28.940
I wanted to tell you and I must say that the
collective here will now grow very much because

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.760
of what we did, today’s miracle that has
taken place.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:39.340
Yesterday we had lots of people, every time
I come there are at least three hundred people

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:45.130
and I knew there will be this time also. But
what is the difference, when I come they are

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:52.130
there and then they don’t come or even if
they come they disappear. They must have confidence

00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:02.260
in you. First you must have confidence in
yourself. You must approach them in a way

00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:07.850
that they feel confident. They shouldn’t
feel that: “Some silly stupid people are

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:13.679
sitting here just telling us about these things”.
But you must have that dignity, you must have

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:20.679
that approach, you must have that understanding,
then only it will work out, otherwise you

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:30.350
cannot work it out. My own idea is that wherever
there are very good deep Sahaja Yogis people

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:41.740
stick on. Like Austria, I would say. In Austria
we have quite a lot of [NEW] people now, [MILAN]

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:49.880
we have quite a lot of people. The reason
is both the places, I’ve noticed, the Sahaja

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:55.200
Yogis are of a very great quality. They are
all working it out.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:02.200
Like there’s one boy who has fished out
lots of things from Quran, in German, from

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:09.860
Quran, what it has to say for Sahaj. And they
said there is a Sura called Shasta Yoga, Shasta

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:15.420
Yoga and that Sura is dealing with Me. Because
we will be…it is said that: “We are going

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:22.420
to send and the sent, the One who is sent
will not be acceptable to you. You will deny,

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.720
you will defy”. Everything is described,
even that your hands will speak at the time

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.880
of Resurrection, all that in that Sura is
given. It’s very interesting that Sura is.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.679
So, what I’m saying they are trying to locate
it. So many things in different things they

00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:44.679
are moving now, also they are trying to make
very beautiful paintings and drawings and

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:51.980
things, to be able to explain. Also they had
TV programs. So on the TV they told whatever

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:57.790
their experience is, this and that. But if
you yourself are not capable, you are not

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:02.080
going to influence anyone even if you go to
the TV or anywhere. Nobody’s going to take

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:09.080
you seriously. So you have to be more serious
about it and to be more earnest to do your

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.200
meditation.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:18.210
Now, there’s another aspect of Sahaja Yoga
that we want people to be married. Married

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:23.880
but married is not the last thing, is not
the last thing, is just an assistance, we

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:30.880
can say, a complement from the another side
so that you develop yourself better. But any

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:36.500
kind of hindrance in the marriage can be a
great hindrance for your ascent. So don’t

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:42.760
pay any attention to such hindrances, just
get out of it and try to remain your Self

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:48.970
because only it is your Self which is going
to give you joy and ascent, not anybody else.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:55.740
It will all work out when if you just keep
to your Self and understand that you are important,

00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:01.960
you have to look after your ascent, also that
the collective of Sahaja Yoga is important.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:07.750
It is very important for all of you because
you are so very few and it has to be worked

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:13.870
out in this country in a big way. And everybody
was asking why is it that in New Zealand the

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:19.240
people are the same, there’s not much changing,
why not progressing. But I’m sure now more

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:24.770
will happen and things the way have triggered
out today it might work out.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:30.780
So now this is my own submission about it
and if you think that there’s something

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.799
more I should say about it or something you
want to know you can write to Me, I will definitely

00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:40.340
answer such letters. But I don’t know what
to answer to such letters that: “My husband

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.510
has run away with another woman this thing,
that thing”. It’s not important, you have

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:49.860
been married so many times in life before.
So what does it matter if he runs away, let

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:56.860
him run away, what to do. You are a Sahaja
Yogi, how many women or how many men have

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:04.030
become Sahaja Yogis in this world? So you
are so exceptional. And such exceptional people

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:14.400
should not bother about mundane things and
useless things. They should know their responsibility.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.890
It is you who will be responsible for the
emancipation of all the New Zealanders. And

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:25.760
this you must understand. You should not try
to put your esteem down. Try to come up and

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.970
work it out.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:33.460
For every nation is important. Some people
are extremely alert and some people are not.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:40.460
But now I’m sure it will work out faster.
We have lots of people and now try to give

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:45.620
them, give them some tea, something to begin
with because their attention is on food but

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:52.490
you just don’t start eating [UNCLEAR] otherwise
they’ll think useless people, they are just

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:58.559
trying to…You should show all dignity or
a hospitality. Hospitality helps a lot. That’s

00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:05.169
a very important thing one should understand.
Like in India if you come, they’ll see ten

00:30:05.169 --> 00:30:09.470
times that you have taken your food, they’ll
call you, somebody’s not there, where are

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:13.940
you, must come and take. But what I hear is
that here nobody calls anyone, anybody [UNCLEAR]

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:19.549
you have your own food. Till the guests come
outside so nobody says: “All right. Will

00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:22.020
you like…? Did you have your food or not?
Did you have your breakfast?” That’s not

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:28.410
the way, we have to be concerned and we should
have those mannerisms, which are very beautiful

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:32.340
of being hospitable to people, see that they
are…

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:37.960
I mean the guests are to be treated in a different
way and the inmates are of a different way

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.910
and that’s what whatever you do your children
are going to learn and behave in the same

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:48.910
manner. So we have to get this culture into
us by which we understand the value of other

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:58.929
person, of guests who have come, those who
are not yet Sahaja Yogis, who have yet to

00:30:58.929 --> 00:31:05.929
become Sahaja Yogis, who have just got Realization.
They are to be treated with very great care,

00:31:07.179 --> 00:31:13.840
like we can say a seed, which is just sprouted.
It’s so delicate. The plant is in such a

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:20.840
delicate way. Now you have to replant it properly
into Sahaj field. So what do you do is to

00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:28.120
take out all the sprouted ones, slowly one
by one, keeping proper distance between them

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:32.419
and try to plant them nicely into the field
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:32.419 --> 00:31:37.980
But if you have certain value system, if you
have achieved something, then you shouldn’t

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.730
look down upon them or you should not all
the time make fun of them, because some people

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:46.780
are sarcastic, some are all the time smiling,
so they think that: “What is wrong with

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:52.010
us, why are they smiling, all the time?”.
So there is no need to have artificial smiles,

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:58.789
nor do there’s any need to sort of criticize
in a way or sometimes [IF] the smile could

00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:05.539
be a ridicule, you know people think, they
misunderstand. Or to say that: “Your this

00:32:05.539 --> 00:32:09.429
bhoot is catching, that bhoot is catching
“ sometimes people say: “This chakra is

00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:13.370
catching”. Not necessary. “Gradually,
you should say, everything is going to work

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.330
out. If you are not feeling the cool breeze,
all right, let’s see what is the problem

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:18.130
is like.”

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:22.690
But you need not tell them all these things,
this language, this should not be exposed

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:28.020
to the first comers that they get frightened,
that our this center is catching, that center

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:33.809
is catching, create a big fright. So we have
to built up their confidence, that’s very

00:32:33.809 --> 00:32:38.470
important. Once you have built up their confidence
and once they start feeling the vibrations

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:44.730
and everything, they have to trust you, they
have to believe in you. So this is the very

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:51.730
small outline of the way I would like New
Zealand to come up and to act in a sensible

00:32:53.830 --> 00:33:00.830
way so that people should say that New Zealanders
are the wisest

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.629
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:43.359
May God bless you all.

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:50.359
Imagine Greece Sahaja Yoga is only two years
old. Only two years old. Greece. But that’s

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:12.050
a traditional country, see, it’s an ancient
country, and

00:58:11.339 --> 00:58:18.339
the

00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:39.990
way

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:52.390
the Greeks have really fallen into

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:09.990
Sahaja Yoga is beyond…
