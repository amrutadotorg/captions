1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:11,444
Today we are here to celebrate Mahashivaratri.

2
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:15,605
It’s a very great privilege for all of us

3
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:19,040
to understand about

4
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:28,363
Shri Mahadeva.

5
00:00:33,403 --> 00:00:39,686
Unless and until you have got your Self Realisation

6
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:44,202
you cannot understand what

7
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:55,363
is the great personality,

8
00:00:55,847 --> 00:01:09,645
the character and the powers of Shri Mahadeva.

9
00:01:14,403 --> 00:01:19,686
It is not easy to conceive,

10
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:24,242
also to reach the depths

11
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:29,645
of his greatness,

12
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:34,565
unless and until we are humble.

13
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:41,847
We have to be very humble to reach

14
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,040
at the Lotus Feet of Shri Mahadeva.

15
00:01:55,202 --> 00:02:05,444
As you have seen, one has to cross even the Sahasrara

16
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:13,686
to be at the Lotus Feet of this great personality.

17
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:25,847
He is beyond – beyond all our conceptions.

18
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:31,686
But he resides in our hearts as the Spirit,

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,242
and is reflected very well when you get your Realisation.¶

20
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:49,524
But still, one has to understand the powers of Shri Mahadeva

21
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:57,928
which is not very easy to describe about

22
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:06,928
this great God in liuttle words.

23
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:12,968
But the first power he himself has,

24
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:17,524
that he is a very forgiving God.

25
00:03:18,524 --> 00:03:21,121
He forgives!

26
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:28,282
He forgives us so many of our sins,

27
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:34,202
so many of our destructive activities,

28
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:37,968
our horrible minds

29
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:42,968
which tries to create problems for everyone.

30
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:46,323
Up to a point!

31
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:54,282
But he has the greatest power to destroy.

32
00:03:54,847 --> 00:04:00,202
His destruction comes so suddenly

33
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:05,565
because he rules all the elements.

34
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:11,242
All the elements he rules. He rules the Mother Earth,

35
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:16,403
and he rules all other elements.

36
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:20,121
Through their causal he rules,

37
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:25,081
and he can destroy everything that he wants to

38
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:29,807
if he finds there is problem.¶

39
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:37,726
I have to tell you

40
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:42,161
that earthquakes are managed by him, not by me.

41
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:46,202
I am not there for destruction.

42
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:52,323
He is the one who sees what’s happening on this earth,

43
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:56,242
what’s happening to the human beings.

44
00:04:56,686 --> 00:05:01,161
I’ll give you an example of Gujurat:

45
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:07,807
apart from anything, Gujurat people are very money-oriented,

46
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:10,363
they are worried with the stock-exchange, this, that,

47
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:14,444
all the time money, money, money, money, money.

48
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:20,766
Even if they are abroad, they are extremely money-oriented.

49
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,242
Sometimes I am surprised,

50
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:30,726
impossible to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

51
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:37,444
and they like artificial type of things like some gurus or somebody.¶

52
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:42,887
I don’t know from where they get like this.

53
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:51,363
Whatever it is, you have a state called Bhavnagar in Gujurat.

54
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:54,040
Bhavnagar people came,

55
00:05:54,161 --> 00:06:00,484
they brought for me those silver slippers, padukas,

56
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:06,807
to be vibrated; I was surprised, I was happy at least,

57
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:09,928
that these people are thinking about it.

58
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,928
So they did a Puja, they did a Havan in Bhavnagar

59
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,161
and also in Baroda.

60
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,645
These are the two places that were not touched,

61
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:28,726
even touched even by bookambh by the earthquake.

62
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,726
Can you imagine.

63
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:39,686
And Surat which is very much distant, was absolutely shattered.

64
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:44,686
There are Sahaja Yogis, very few,

65
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:51,524
all of them were saved, and their houses also did not move.

66
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,444
This is between the protection of your Mother

67
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:03,605
and the wrath of God Almighty.¶

68
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:08,807
One has to understand this very well,

69
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:14,766
that he has powers over all the elements.

70
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:18,040
I went to France,

71
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:22,524
and there some people in France tried to trouble Me.

72
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:26,040
And all the media got after Me.

73
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:28,968
And on the television, everywhere,

74
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:32,403
they were saying all kinds of things against me.

75
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:36,000
I knew something would go somewhere

76
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:40,807
and suddenly from the sea a big –

77
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:46,161
I don’t know what to call it – a big storm started,

78
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:49,161
suddenly, no-one knows why.

79
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:54,323
And two ships were completely sunk,

80
00:07:55,121 --> 00:08:01,040
and those people who went to rescue them got cancer.

81
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:07,323
Then it came, this storm started moving fast

82
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:15,645
and all the churches lost their top – heads I should say.

83
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:23,323
All the churches lost it. So many priest’s houses were ruined

84
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:28,968
and it travelled and came up to the place where I had purchased

85
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:32,202
a very big castle.

86
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:37,928
It just stopped – and just stopped at the brink of it.

87
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:42,242
Now, it is not my doing, I must tell you.

88
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:45,968
But this is what he does.

89
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:51,686
Though he is very forgiving, he is extremely kind,

90
00:08:51,807 --> 00:09:00,766
he’s blissful, but you should be aware of his powers.¶

91
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:10,363
All those powers are used to protect my work, I should say.

92
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:17,645
It goes too far and it is to show to people that

93
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:23,242
they shouldn’t obstruct the work of spirituality.

94
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:29,766
It should be real spirituality. It should not be somebody

95
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:36,484
like a false guru coming up and showing some magic,

96
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:43,000
or talking something about some far-fetched thing.

97
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:47,363
But the real spirituality, if you have,

98
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:50,686
the protection will be always there,

99
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:54,242
and Shiva will be very blissful.

100
00:09:54,363 --> 00:09:57,605
It’s extremely blissful.

101
00:09:57,726 --> 00:10:03,645
And what does he give you is even more beautiful

102
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:05,928
than you could think of.

103
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:11,565
He is extremely forgiving.

104
00:10:11,686 --> 00:10:15,403
I should say he is the source of such forgiveness.

105
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:22,202
If you have forgiveness in your heart, he resides in your heart.¶

106
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:32,524
Otherwise, gradually, you start developing

107
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:38,807
very difficult types of diseases.

108
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,363
Say, if you are forgiving, your heart runs very fast.

109
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:54,161
No-one can touch your heart. You cannot get heart-attacks.

110
00:10:54,726 --> 00:11:02,242
But if you are tolerating, suffering

111
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:12,242
and taking many things as a power of your own,

112
00:11:12,363 --> 00:11:18,847
doing wrong things and forgetting about God,

113
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:26,121
then you also start developing a very weak heart.

114
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:30,363
So one side is that you develop a heart

115
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:36,363
which is extremely aggressive,

116
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:41,968
and can become like Hitler’s heart.

117
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:50,121
Under any kind of pretensions, if you start torturing someone,

118
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,847
your heart becomes solid

119
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:58,363
and then you can get a tremendous massive heart-attack,

120
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,524
and all the troubles from that.

121
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,524
This is inevitable.

122
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:12,444
But supposing you are extremely tolerant

123
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:17,444
and you tolerate all nonsense, you are very docile,

124
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:20,807
you are a frightened person.

125
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:25,565
If you are frightened, then because of fright you do that,

126
00:12:25,686 --> 00:12:30,847
you can develop another kind of a heart we call as angina

127
00:12:30,968 --> 00:12:33,403
where the blood supply is there,

128
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:39,403
and ultimately you develop a kind of guilt and

129
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:44,484
you lead a very mediocre life.¶

130
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:51,605
So this second thing also is very visible

131
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:57,000
among people who think they are very, very tolerant.

132
00:12:57,121 --> 00:13:01,766
I am saying that tolerance is alright,

133
00:13:01,887 --> 00:13:04,484
because of Spirituality,

134
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:08,040
but not because you are frightened,

135
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:12,686
and you are afraid of something.

136
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:16,161
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have no business to be

137
00:13:16,282 --> 00:13:18,726
afraid of anything.

138
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:23,766
In India people are afraid of everything!

139
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:28,040
If they can see a squirrel, they will be frightened.

140
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,363
If they see a lizard – finished!

141
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,242
I mean they are afraid of anything,

142
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:44,363
and the ladies in India are so afraid of even cockroaches!

143
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:49,565
This kind of temperament is absolutely stupid!

144
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:58,605
Because that makes you a kind of a person who is prone to angina.

145
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:01,605
What is there to be afraid of?

146
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:04,928
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and Sahaja Yogini,

147
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,605
you are not to be afraid of anything.

148
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:11,807
They are afraid of rats,

149
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,847
all kinds of nonsense and they boast of it,

150
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:18,081
and they talk about it.

151
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:23,605
Here the heart is becoming weak and weak and weak.¶

152
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:29,121
Also, I must say, the Indian men are responsible for that.

153
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:32,081
Because they treat their women as

154
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:36,726
if they are appendages or some sort of a liability,

155
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:39,242
I don’t know what they think they are.

156
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:44,968
Their behaviour is so bad, unbelievable!

157
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:50,807
Especially in north India, I have seen, women have no position.

158
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:56,161
The woman is brought in the house, kept in the house,

159
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:59,726
just like a maidservant,

160
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:02,887
she has to cover he face all the time,

161
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:09,040
she doesn’t have to go out anywhere without permission.

162
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:11,121
It’s terrible!

163
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:15,524
Some people say it is a Muslim influence or whatever it is.

164
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:25,565
But when you believe in eternal life, in spiritual life,

165
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:34,968
you should not be governed by any such nonsensical atrocities.¶

166
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:39,605
And that’s why I feel

167
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:44,161
that you really need the emancipation of women in India.

168
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:50,403
They are very good, they are very tolerant, they are very sweet,

169
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:58,968
but they develop all the bad diseases, all the mental diseases,

170
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:03,524
because they don’t know their own value,

171
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:06,928
they don’t know their own self-respect.

172
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,363
And on this I have already spoken at length.

173
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:14,766
Whey should men behave like that?

174
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:22,766
I think in our country, we have at least seventy percent are women;

175
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:29,847
and seventy percent people’s energy is wasted in the north India.

176
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:34,081
I don’t know what they think of themselves.

177
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:37,161
And then they are punished.

178
00:16:37,282 --> 00:16:41,403
All such countries can never prosper,

179
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:45,444
because women are the Laxmis.

180
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:49,000
But they have to be Laxmis also,

181
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:52,081
they have to behave like Laxmis.

182
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:57,161
But some of them come up like this that you are shocked.

183
00:16:57,403 --> 00:17:01,766
How can they be women, they look like devils?

184
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:06,645
So such an imbalance in the society

185
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:11,484
which is punished, again, by Shri Mahadeva.¶

186
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:16,565
He is very kind,

187
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:20,565
and he looks after the people who have to suffer it.

188
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:25,363
And he tries to punish people who make them suffer.

189
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:31,282
It is his quality to help

190
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:37,202
by destroying people who are aggressive.

191
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,202
He doesn’t talk of any Kundalini,

192
00:17:41,323 --> 00:17:44,161
he doesn’t talk of Self Realisation,

193
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:47,605
he just punishes them, nicely!

194
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:52,363
In such a bad way that it’s shocking!

195
00:17:52,484 --> 00:17:55,887
And he relieves sometimes people like

196
00:17:55,968 --> 00:18:02,242
– I have seen many women who live like this, suffer so much.

197
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:07,726
They die much earlier than their ages.

198
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:16,040
All this one has to see in the right perspective.

199
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:21,484
He’s there to protect, of course,

200
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:24,766
but more to destroy.

201
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:31,000
He protects all kinds of animals, all birds,

202
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:34,766
all the nature, he protects.

203
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:43,161
He is the one who brings all the joy,

204
00:18:43,282 --> 00:18:46,968
all the joy of spirituality.

205
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:54,403
But if you try to become aggressive,

206
00:18:55,847 --> 00:19:00,242
then he is the one who will destroy.

207
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:06,726
Sometimes he gives more long rope to hang,

208
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,968
and so people think we are alright,

209
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,887
they are satisfied with themselves.¶

210
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,524
On the contrary, in the west I find,

211
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:18,202
the women are ruling the men more than the men.

212
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,403
Very surprising.

213
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:23,887
I don’t know how they have handled the situation,

214
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,565
but they are ruling, all the time,

215
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:29,565
and the men have to be under their thumb

216
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:32,282
– I don’t know how they have managed it –

217
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:36,807
but they do it! They are not humble.

218
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:39,565
They don’t love,

219
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:43,887
and they go on divorcing their husbands all the time.

220
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,202
They do not love!

221
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:49,807
They don’t know what is love is.

222
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:56,524
But also, I have seen men don’t understand what love is in India.

223
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,968
They don’t know how to love

224
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:04,000
their wives, which is a life-partner.

225
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:08,645
How to respect, they don’t understand.

226
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:13,766
There, then comes a great wrath,

227
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:18,403
and this wrath works in so many ways,

228
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:22,242
in creating horrible diseases

229
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:29,807
and in creating problems and problems for such men.¶

230
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:40,282
And the society also is responsible

231
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:47,686
for doing all kinds of things against humble people.

232
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:56,242
Both ways, one has to understand, that if you are aggressive,

233
00:20:56,363 --> 00:21:03,202
you are under the Third Eye of Shri Mahadeva.

234
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:09,524
In any way if you are aggressive, say with your servants,

235
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,484
if you are aggressive with your subordinates,

236
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:19,202
if you are aggressive with your children,

237
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:25,686
there is this wrathful God watching,

238
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:33,161
and one can get under the spell of his destruction.¶

239
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:41,444
But he gives us the great heights of Himalaya.

240
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:51,766
He makes human beings extremely beautiful, very noble,

241
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:58,161
and he wants that people should love each other.

242
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:02,928
There should be pure love among human beings.

243
00:22:03,766 --> 00:22:15,403
And also he makes you, very delicately,

244
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,202
behaving towards other people;

245
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:26,242
very sweetly behaving towards others.

246
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:34,928
If you don’t have that, then you are going in the wrong direction.

247
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,726
But his greatest privilege,

248
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:42,645
that he gives you the height and the depth.

249
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:51,524
If you are worshipping him, then you develop such heights

250
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:56,807
that you see the whole world as a witness.¶

251
00:22:57,202 --> 00:23:05,282
He sees the whole world as a sakshi-swarupa, as a witness.

252
00:23:05,403 --> 00:23:11,686
And so he is the knowledge, he is the pure knowledge.

253
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,524
You may get your Realisation, alright;

254
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:19,726
you might feel the cool breeze in your hands, alright;

255
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:24,847
but do you have the knowledge?

256
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:29,524
I have to tell you what finger means what,

257
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:34,565
what hand means what, what is vibrations, I have to tell you.

258
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:40,363
He is that knowledge, He is the pure knowledge,

259
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:46,282
complete knowledge, of the highest level.¶

260
00:23:46,484 --> 00:23:51,040
So he is the source of knowledge.

261
00:23:51,282 --> 00:23:58,968
Those people who are not humble cannot get that knowledge.

262
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:04,202
Those people who are arrogant

263
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:11,242
and who do not handle others delicately, sweetly, beautifully,

264
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:15,847
are not blessed by him.

265
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:23,282
They cannot achieve anything in life.

266
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:25,645
What do we have to achieve?

267
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:32,807
Not your position, not your wealth, not all these outward things,

268
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:37,403
but you have to achieve a loving heart!

269
00:24:37,524 --> 00:24:41,000
Heart with which you can love.¶

270
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:45,323
If there is Shiva in your heart, you will love

271
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:51,040
everyone in a very beautiful manner.

272
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:56,121
There won’t be any nonsensical ideas about love.

273
00:24:56,242 --> 00:25:07,968
Just pure love, pure love for all the people.

274
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:17,000
With the blessing, then all your harshness goes away.

275
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:22,282
For example, if you have a little power, little power,

276
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:29,000
so you start to misuse it.

277
00:25:29,686 --> 00:25:37,605
Look at Shiva, he has so many powers; if he starts misusing,

278
00:25:37,726 --> 00:25:42,282
there won’t be even a blade of grass left on this earth.

279
00:25:42,403 --> 00:25:49,242
How much you are sinful, selfish, you know that.

280
00:25:50,605 --> 00:25:52,968
But still he gives you a chance

281
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:55,847
‘So let’s see, they might improve’.

282
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:01,000
And he is extremely generous, extremely generous,

283
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:07,282
he is very forgiving and also extremely generous.¶

284
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:17,081
Now supposing there are people who are living in a desert

285
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:21,766
and they are very good people,

286
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:26,726
and they are suffering because they are living in a desert,

287
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:32,202
he will create oasis for them, he controls the Mother Earth.

288
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:36,282
He can do everything to make them happy,

289
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:42,282
if they are spiritual, if they worship.

290
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:46,565
But human beings are so stupid

291
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:52,040
that they go on fighting also in the name of God.

292
00:26:52,161 --> 00:26:59,403
Like in the south we have two types of people,

293
00:26:59,524 --> 00:27:03,081
one who worships Shiva, another who worships Vishnu.

294
00:27:03,202 --> 00:27:04,766
Can you imagine!

295
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:08,766
Vishnu used to worship Shiva!

296
00:27:08,887 --> 00:27:13,605
Nobody’s higher, nobody’s lower. It’s so important.

297
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:16,282
Everything is so important.

298
00:27:16,403 --> 00:27:21,645
But they used to fight on this point, if they are worshipping Shiva,

299
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:24,726
or they are worshipping Vishnu,

300
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:28,040
and nowhere near the reality they were.

301
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:31,282
They didn’t know what was the reality, nothing,

302
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:34,766
just fighting, fighting, fighting.¶

303
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:40,968
In the name of God, those who fight, Shiva comes on them

304
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:44,444
and with his trident hits them.

305
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:47,242
You are not to fight in the name of God,

306
00:27:47,363 --> 00:27:50,484
but you have to love and understand.

307
00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:54,444
So this fighting in the name of God is a nonsense.

308
00:27:54,565 --> 00:27:57,887
Not only that but it’s very, very dangerous.

309
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,726
All such people who do that will be destroyed.

310
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:08,968
It is self-destructive. Such people will be destroyed completely. ¶

311
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:16,202
So, you should understand that in the name of God you have to love.

312
00:28:16,323 --> 00:28:18,484
You have to understand.

313
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:21,726
You need not tolerate nonsenses, it’s different;

314
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:27,968
but you have to love people, spread you love.

315
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:33,444
Gradually this love can go all over, all over the world,

316
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:39,645
and then the vision of mine I can see working out.

317
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:43,565
But if there is fighting, there’s hatred,

318
00:28:43,686 --> 00:28:46,202
there’s all kinds of aggressiveness,

319
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:50,928
these are all against Shiva, and such people will be destroyed.

320
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,444
What will I do with them?

321
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,807
What can I do if they are destroyed?

322
00:28:56,928 --> 00:29:02,645
If they are very money oriented, materialistic people,

323
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:06,726
they are not loving them, they are loving only for money.

324
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:10,847
All such people will be destroyed, no doubt.¶

325
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:17,887
One should be not only humble, but should be extremely loving.

326
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,887
To get the blessings of Shiva you have to be extremely loving.

327
00:29:26,202 --> 00:29:32,645
Such people may not be very cunning, clever,

328
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:36,968
maybe very innocent – they must be.

329
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:42,242
Because when you love somebody, you want to help that person.

330
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,323
I have suffered myself,

331
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:48,887
I have tried to help people and they have deceived me.

332
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:51,847
So what? That’s their nature,

333
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:54,524
and they are destroyed, what can I do?

334
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:59,645
I didn’t ask them that you deceive me, but they deceived me

335
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:01,887
– I don’t know why.

336
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:06,242
And I have been very kind and nice, and still they deceived me.

337
00:30:06,363 --> 00:30:12,887
So when the destruction follows, what can I do about it?¶

338
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,081
I don’t want anybody to be destroyed,

339
00:30:16,202 --> 00:30:18,887
I love this creation of mine,

340
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,766
and I don’t have

341
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:27,242
any way of protecting them if they are destructive.

342
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:34,565
Because there is another great power who can destroy them.

343
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:41,605
See then, I am absolutely in a helpless condition, sometimes I feel

344
00:30:41,726 --> 00:30:44,282
and I don’t know how to express,

345
00:30:44,403 --> 00:30:47,766
but one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis

346
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:54,524
that with Shiva’s love and his blessings

347
00:30:54,645 --> 00:31:03,686
you can become extremely loving, extremely generous,

348
00:31:03,807 --> 00:31:12,040
very, very sweet and innocent like children.¶

349
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:16,000
You have to be innocent.

350
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:19,887
There is no need to be very clever and cunning

351
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,686
and you will be amazed how your innocence will be protected.

352
00:31:28,807 --> 00:31:33,524
If you are innocent, you don’t have to worry,

353
00:31:33,968 --> 00:31:43,403
there’s a power, the Third Eye of Shiva looking after you.

354
00:31:43,524 --> 00:31:46,847
Wherever you are going, he is with you.

355
00:31:46,968 --> 00:31:50,403
That doesn’t mean that you become stupid.

356
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:56,565
It doesn’t mean that you are not practical.

357
00:31:56,686 --> 00:32:01,484
All that is taken over, all the practical side,

358
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:04,242
by the power of Shiva.

359
00:32:04,363 --> 00:32:11,081
His guidance, his love, his kindness,

360
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:15,363
you can see at every, every step of life.¶

361
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:18,282
But first of all, watch your steps!

362
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:22,968
Are you aggressive? Are you troublesome?

363
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:28,323
Do you say harsh things to others?

364
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:33,484
Or are you humble? Are you gentle?

365
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:39,081
And if you are kind, he is very much pleased.¶

366
00:32:39,202 --> 00:32:45,565
In the nature, it is His rule that works.

367
00:32:46,202 --> 00:32:49,081
And they (animals) are so systematic,

368
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:57,121
they live with understanding of each other.

369
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:13,565
For example, if you go in the jungle and it is absolutely quiet,

370
00:33:14,323 --> 00:33:17,524
and you don’t even hear the birds twittering:

371
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:21,766
then you should know there is a tiger sitting some way.

372
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:26,444
Because he is the king. They know they have to obey,

373
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:30,605
and when the king is there, his protocol is there.

374
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:33,766
They know automatically what is the protocol of the king.

375
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:38,484
Nobody would be even moving if he is there.

376
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:41,363
He sits in his majesty.

377
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:46,847
Then in one week, or maybe fifteen days he will kill one animal.

378
00:33:46,968 --> 00:33:48,766
He has to eat.

379
00:33:48,887 --> 00:33:57,726
He kills one animal then he and his family, they eat first.

380
00:33:57,807 --> 00:34:02,403
He waits for some time, of course, for the blood to ooze out,

381
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:06,081
then the whole family comes and eats.

382
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:09,484
Then he leaves the body there.

383
00:34:09,605 --> 00:34:16,242
Then by gradation, one by one, all kinds of animals come

384
00:34:16,363 --> 00:34:19,444
and eat it as a prasad.

385
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:28,484
And the last thing are the crows who come and eat that animal.

386
00:34:28,605 --> 00:34:33,887
Such discipline, such understanding of the protocol;

387
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I am amazed how animals are managed by Shiva.¶

388
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:47,766
You never hear that animals are having a ‘strike’,

389
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:55,040
or animals are having a big ‘underworld’ animals!

390
00:34:55,161 --> 00:35:02,323
You don’t hear that these animals are stealing things.

391
00:35:02,444 --> 00:35:08,161
And just imagine, we are coming from that animal life,

392
00:35:08,282 --> 00:35:11,121
but we are worse than them.

393
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:16,444
How are we going to rise if we have all such funny ideas

394
00:35:16,565 --> 00:35:22,040
of behaving in such a manner of fighting.

395
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:25,968
On any small little excuse they will fight,

396
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:28,363
they will start fighting.

397
00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:31,726
Animals also fight a little bit among themselves,

398
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:34,524
but not in a collective way.

399
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:38,524
They don’t do it in a collective way as we do it here.

400
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:45,726
It is really at the slightest provocation

401
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:49,807
we get into groups and start fighting.

402
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:53,928
They get into groups but they don’t fight.

403
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,081
What is the thing among them?

404
00:35:56,202 --> 00:36:02,686
Everything is so much, so much understood by animals,

405
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:09,807
why not for us also to understand the law of nature?¶

406
00:36:09,928 --> 00:36:11,968
It is Mahadeva

407
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:19,565
who manages that all the nature’s law are to be obeyed.

408
00:36:19,686 --> 00:36:24,121
Even the Mother Earth, the sky, everything,

409
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:27,847
is looked after by him.

410
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:31,524
He does nice, nice, beautiful things for us.

411
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:34,444
With the changing of the seasons,

412
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:39,202
he creates these beautiful flowers;

413
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:44,484
he creates all that is soothing and joy-giving and beautiful,

414
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:46,363
he looks after.

415
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:51,686
He gives us to see what nature has given us,

416
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:58,766
and tries to please us, keep us happy, entertain,

417
00:36:58,887 --> 00:37:01,565
like an innocent child.

418
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:05,323
But while we are, in our arrogance,

419
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:09,524
we have our reactions – to everything!

420
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:13,645
You see a carpet, you will say “I don’t like it!”

421
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:16,524
Especially in the west, it is a common

422
00:37:16,645 --> 00:37:18,444
thing to say “I don’t like it”.

423
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:23,403
Who are you not to like something, or to dislike something?

424
00:37:23,524 --> 00:37:25,968
What do you think of yourself?

425
00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:29,484
It’s very common, and shamelessly they will say

426
00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:35,686
“I don’t like this, I like it …” It’s impossible!

427
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:39,202
Such human beings, I don’t know where they will go,

428
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,202
what will happen to them.

429
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:47,323
Instead of appreciating, instead of enjoying everything,

430
00:37:47,444 --> 00:37:52,484
why to start criticizing and reacting.¶

431
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:55,323
Reaction is much more in the west, I must say,

432
00:37:55,444 --> 00:37:57,282
not so much in India.

433
00:37:57,403 --> 00:38:03,605
But there are certain cultural differences, I think,

434
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:05,928
that’s why people say like that.

435
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:08,040
Here if somebody says like that,

436
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,524
people will think that person is mad or that

437
00:38:10,645 --> 00:38:13,524
something is wrong with him, the way he talks.¶

438
00:38:13,645 --> 00:38:19,040
It is important how you express your love,

439
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:23,000
how you talk about your love.

440
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:26,484
Start it with your wife, to begin with,

441
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:31,323
and then you can move towards your children and other people.

442
00:38:31,403 --> 00:38:33,565
And we are so stupid sometimes,

443
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:37,726
that we love the whole world but we can’t love our wives!

444
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:41,766
It’s a specialty! In India that’s very true,

445
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:45,565
but also in the west I have seen people love their wives

446
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:50,645
because of fear – fear of divorce maybe, I don’t know –.

447
00:38:51,524 --> 00:39:00,726
Love should have no fear. It should be just ‘free’ love.

448
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:10,121
Without any fear, without any aggression, enjoy that pure love.

449
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:16,726
And that is what is missing in the human beings today as it is.¶

450
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:21,686
When the day will come when human beings will

451
00:39:21,766 --> 00:39:27,363
be understanding the beauty of love,

452
00:39:27,484 --> 00:39:36,403
then from the heavens there will be flowers falling on us,

453
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:42,928
it would be such a tremendous day when

454
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:52,928
Mahadeva will be able to close his Third Eye

455
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,282
and would be peaceful in his heart.

456
00:39:56,403 --> 00:39:59,605
It is my vision.

457
00:39:59,726 --> 00:40:03,726
It’s the future for you;

458
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:10,444
to see how peacefully you can talk to people,

459
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:16,645
how sweetly you can love others,

460
00:40:17,323 --> 00:40:20,928
how much you can give to others.¶

461
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:27,161
For example, they have to give something,

462
00:40:27,403 --> 00:40:31,282
they’ll go in the market and buy the cheapest,

463
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:35,605
the rottenest thing for giving.

464
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,040
That’s not the way.

465
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:45,565
You must buy small or big, whatever it is, out of love!

466
00:40:45,686 --> 00:40:48,565
That (thing) should talk about your love,

467
00:40:48,686 --> 00:40:51,000
tell about your love,

468
00:40:51,121 --> 00:40:55,081
and not about your money and what you have spent.

469
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:59,242
It’s very common nowadays, even in India,

470
00:40:59,363 --> 00:41:05,686
that people try to show how much they are worth,

471
00:41:05,807 --> 00:41:09,726
what they wear, how they dress up.

472
00:41:09,847 --> 00:41:18,968
For what? For what? I’ve known such people, very many,

473
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:22,444
and when they die there are not even four people available

474
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:25,565
to carry their dead bodies!

475
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:29,323
When they lived they think no end of themselves.

476
00:41:29,484 --> 00:41:36,040
That time, you should see how many people there are

477
00:41:36,726 --> 00:41:41,645
to love that person, to care for that person.

478
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:46,928
Maybe it is the upbringing,

479
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:49,807
maybe, that he had never known love,

480
00:41:49,928 --> 00:41:51,928
anything you may blame.¶

481
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,363
But for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to learn

482
00:41:56,484 --> 00:42:04,524
that love is your life, love is spirituality, and love

483
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:09,686
– without expectations – to do something.

484
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:13,565
Some people are, I know, very good at helping

485
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:16,161
poor people, this, that.

486
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:22,242
But behind that is the power that …

487
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:27,726
They think “Oh, we are great, we are doing this work, that work”

488
00:42:27,847 --> 00:42:32,282
just to satisfy their power, not their love.

489
00:42:32,403 --> 00:42:35,686
So when you are working,

490
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:41,081
you have to know that it’s just to satisfy your Spirit,

491
00:42:41,202 --> 00:42:45,161
just to satisfy your love that you are doing it,

492
00:42:45,282 --> 00:42:52,807
not for any name or for any kind of a position.

493
00:42:52,928 --> 00:43:01,363
If you have that kind of a detached love,

494
00:43:01,484 --> 00:43:08,000
virakta as they call it, then nobody has to certify you.

495
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:14,161
You have it, and you are enjoying it!¶

496
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:22,282
It is unfortunate I have to speak in English language,

497
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:26,605
and maybe there are some who do not understand English,

498
00:43:26,726 --> 00:43:31,726
but nowadays English has become dominating, what to do?

499
00:43:31,847 --> 00:43:35,363
You have to suppose people will read  English language.

500
00:43:35,484 --> 00:43:39,242
I can’t use any other language.

501
00:43:39,645 --> 00:43:45,928
But one has to speak the language of love.

502
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,726
You see animals, you see if you have a horse

503
00:43:51,847 --> 00:43:53,645
and if you have a dog,

504
00:43:53,766 --> 00:44:00,484
all these animals, they understand your love;

505
00:44:00,968 --> 00:44:07,323
how they stick to you, how they express their love,

506
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,968
they are very sweet.

507
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:16,081
And this we have to learn from them now, I think.

508
00:44:16,202 --> 00:44:20,807
Otherwise I don’t know how to make them understand

509
00:44:20,887 --> 00:44:23,645
the value of love.

510
00:44:24,766 --> 00:44:32,968
It is not that the way people are criticising:

511
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:38,524
that we are not practical, that we have not

512
00:44:38,645 --> 00:44:47,282
achieved much money or power or something, that’s not important.

513
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:53,081
Because there are many like that selling in the market.¶

514
00:44:53,524 --> 00:45:01,766
But we are different. We are the jewels of humanity,

515
00:45:01,887 --> 00:45:05,040
and we have to be like that, shining,

516
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:10,242
cutting out all the wrong things within us

517
00:45:10,363 --> 00:45:17,605
as a diamond is cut to look something very, very great.¶

518
00:45:18,444 --> 00:45:26,161
My only, if I have any desire, is that:

519
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:34,121
‘Try to follow the qualities of Shri Mahadeva’.

520
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:44,928
How great he is, how detached he is, detached, absolutely detached.

521
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:52,242
He lives with bones and things like that.

522
00:45:52,887 --> 00:45:56,726
He is not bothered about where he is, what he lives with,

523
00:45:56,847 --> 00:46:00,000
what he has, nothing.

524
00:46:00,484 --> 00:46:05,323
So detached, and we should be detached like that.¶

525
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:10,524
At the same time, we should be very loving like him,

526
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:14,000
extremely loving.

527
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:18,686
How his heart is full of love for others,

528
00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:21,686
how he looks after others.

529
00:46:21,807 --> 00:46:28,363
I am warning you, because I know you all love me very much,

530
00:46:28,484 --> 00:46:31,766
but you should also love each other,

531
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:34,887
you should have a loving heart,

532
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,363
and have satisfaction in loving others.

533
00:46:40,484 --> 00:46:45,444
If you could develop that, your height will grow,

534
00:46:45,565 --> 00:46:50,524
your depth in Sahaja Yoga will grow.

535
00:46:50,645 --> 00:46:55,968
It’s alright, the Goddess gives you the shraddha, alright,

536
00:46:56,121 --> 00:47:00,282
but the depth in shraddha,

537
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:06,121
in Sanskrit, or in Hindi and Marathi I don’t know,

538
00:47:06,242 --> 00:47:10,444
but in Marathi they call it dyas.

539
00:47:10,565 --> 00:47:17,081
Just deep in to that love, drenched in to that love,

540
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:20,323
enjoying that love – then you don’t want anything.

541
00:47:20,444 --> 00:47:25,040
What do you want? You’ve got everything.

542
00:47:25,161 --> 00:47:27,645
So what do you want now?

543
00:47:27,766 --> 00:47:36,282
Just like the greatness of Shri Mahadeva.

544
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:42,121
He’s so great that he’s detached.

545
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:46,040
What does he want? I mean nothing is greater than him,

546
00:47:46,161 --> 00:47:50,444
nothing is more important than him. Then what does he want?

547
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:56,282
He doesn’t want anything. That’s why he’s detached.

548
00:47:56,403 --> 00:48:01,887
This detachment you have to develop.¶

549
00:48:01,968 --> 00:48:08,121
But at the same time he is the Lord of all the arts,

550
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:12,524
of the music, of the rhythm.

551
00:48:12,645 --> 00:48:17,040
The other day you saw these boys were playing the rhythm.

552
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:20,766
The whole rhythm of everything he gives.

553
00:48:20,887 --> 00:48:29,363
The rhythmic life that we have, we are not yet aware of it.

554
00:48:29,484 --> 00:48:39,121
See a child is born exactly after nine months and so-many days.

555
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:42,282
Who keeps this rhythm?

556
00:48:43,202 --> 00:48:48,202
Then we get, say, certain flowers at such-and-such time,

557
00:48:48,323 --> 00:48:54,686
then we get in the nature all kinds of seasons.

558
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:57,081
Who keeps the rhythm?

559
00:48:57,202 --> 00:49:02,161
He is the one who is nothing but rhythm!

560
00:49:02,282 --> 00:49:06,928
And that rhythm is kept up, in the nature,

561
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,282
in everything there is a rhythm.

562
00:49:10,403 --> 00:49:17,363
And a rhythmic person is the one who has a very large heart!

563
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:21,121
It’s like an ocean.¶

564
00:49:21,242 --> 00:49:26,444
You get just that rhythm disturbed immediately if you

565
00:49:26,565 --> 00:49:31,928
find somebody who is being very cruel, very bad and all that.

566
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:40,565
But in a smooth, beautiful, peaceful lake,

567
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:45,323
there is no ripple at all, it is just love.

568
00:49:45,403 --> 00:49:48,605
And then at that time, if the rhythm,

569
00:49:48,726 --> 00:49:53,847
the silent rhythm of that heart is broken,

570
00:49:53,968 --> 00:49:57,081
then Shiva takes charge.

571
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:04,565
So one has to have a complete sense of the rhythm of time,

572
00:50:04,686 --> 00:50:09,928
rhythm of nature, rhythm of everything.

573
00:50:10,081 --> 00:50:13,403
People don’t know even the names of the flowers.

574
00:50:13,524 --> 00:50:16,605
They don’t know what these flowers are,

575
00:50:16,726 --> 00:50:19,565
what time they come up;

576
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:26,484
they have no idea what is the rhythm of their ‘living’

577
00:50:26,605 --> 00:50:28,565
– nobody’s bothered.¶

578
00:50:28,686 --> 00:50:33,807
All over, if you see, there is seasons and things.

579
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:40,323
So all the rhythm, like his play, with tabla or pakwaj

580
00:50:40,444 --> 00:50:48,323
on which he played all the beautiful tunes of all the seasons.

581
00:50:48,444 --> 00:50:52,242
And that’s how the nature flourishes

582
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:57,121
and comes up and then subsides.¶

583
00:50:57,242 --> 00:51:00,202
We do not see that point.

584
00:51:00,282 --> 00:51:04,282
We are just bothered about ourselves.

585
00:51:04,403 --> 00:51:06,726
Like I’ll ask “How are you?”

586
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:10,403
“Mother, I’ve got a headache, I’ve got a stomach trouble,

587
00:51:10,524 --> 00:51:15,040
I have another trouble” … or everything is there.

588
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:20,524
But another one would say “Ah, I’m alright!”

589
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:22,282
“So, what’s the matter?”

590
00:51:22,403 --> 00:51:24,605
“Put the world right Mamma!

591
00:51:24,726 --> 00:51:27,121
Mother, why don’t you put the world right?”

592
00:51:27,242 --> 00:51:33,000
He’s worried about others, not about himself.

593
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:39,121
And in that understanding of what one should do

594
00:51:39,242 --> 00:51:42,847
to make this world happy, beautiful,

595
00:51:42,968 --> 00:51:47,726
for that one has to really work hard, so called,

596
00:51:47,847 --> 00:51:51,887
and in that working one thinks,

597
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:58,081
“Isn’t it our duty to make this world beautiful?

598
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:01,565
Isn’t it our job to make

599
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:06,807
this world rhythmic, rhyming with the Spirit?”

600
00:52:06,928 --> 00:52:09,968
It’s our duty. We have to do it!

601
00:52:10,081 --> 00:52:16,565
Not only taking Sahaja Yoga for yourself, but for others.

602
00:52:16,686 --> 00:52:20,161
It’s not you are all the time worried about yourself,

603
00:52:20,282 --> 00:52:23,887
but you are worried about others,

604
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,887
what’s happening in the world.

605
00:52:27,968 --> 00:52:33,928
That is love! That love is spontaneous,

606
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,444
and when it works, it works wonders.¶

607
00:52:43,524 --> 00:52:48,444
So this is a beautiful evening,

608
00:52:49,242 --> 00:53:00,807
where we are worshipping such a great source of our ascent.

609
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:06,323
And I hope you people will understand

610
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:11,000
how far you are with that force,

611
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:16,202
how much are you drenched in that force,

612
00:53:16,323 --> 00:53:22,847
in that rhythm of Shiva,

613
00:53:22,968 --> 00:53:28,323
who, in his rhythmic way, gives you vibrations.

614
00:53:28,444 --> 00:53:33,121
Vibrations flow in the way we live,

615
00:53:33,242 --> 00:53:39,000
and that way should engulf you completely;

616
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:43,766
and you should be asked in that your ‘I-ness’

617
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:47,766
should be dissolved in that which is I bless you.

618
00:53:47,887 --> 00:53:49,403
Thank you.¶

619
00:53:56,202 --> 00:54:04,040
Today we have a Ganesha Puja, a small Ganesha Puja,

620
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:07,766
then Shiva Puja and then the Devi’s Puja.¶

621
00:54:07,887 --> 00:54:09,242
May God Bless You
