00:01.530 --> 00:08.446
Christmas Puja, Ganapatipule, India
December 25, 2001

00:08.641 --> 00:18.447
Nice to see so many Sahaja yogis coming here

00:18.742 --> 00:22.376
during the Christmas Puja.

00:25.902 --> 00:30.247
Christianity has spread all over the world,

00:30.580 --> 00:36.110
and there are so many so-called Christians

00:36.424 --> 00:40.933
who say they follow Christ –

00:41.155 --> 00:45.999
I don’t know from which angle.

00:51.714 --> 00:56.369
Christ was the embodiment of Paramchaitanya.

00:56.649 --> 01:02.245
He was Omkara. He was Shri Ganesha.

01:03.966 --> 01:12.375
And those
who follow Him have to be very different people.

01:13.057 --> 01:19.393
But always happens in every religion

01:19.679 --> 01:29.362
that they go at random into the opposite direction,

01:29.729 --> 01:32.962
completely opposite.

01:33.140 --> 01:42.930
The essence of Christ’s life was detachment and sacrifice.

01:43.895 --> 01:51.606
For a person who is detached, there’s nothing like sacrifice.

01:51.814 --> 01:57.178
He sees his life as just a drama.

01:57.420 --> 02:01.900
Such a great personality came on this earth

02:02.141 --> 02:07.313
and created this so-called Christian religion,

02:07.718 --> 02:15.183
which has gone into wars, all kinds of hypocritical thing,

02:15.604 --> 02:20.643
and now the people are discovering about it.

02:22.282 --> 02:31.202
He stood for truth, and Christians don’t know what is the truth is.

02:32.247 --> 02:37.998
The truth is that you are the spirit,

02:38.197 --> 02:42.132
and you have to become the spirit.

02:42.386 --> 02:50.957
He’s the one who has talked about second birth, of realization.

02:52.764 --> 02:59.017
But they have forgotten about what He said,
what they have to achieve.

02:59.561 --> 03:06.561
It’s such a funny thing that all these great people came on this Earth

03:06.726 --> 03:14.040
and created a proper religion for our ascent,

03:14.239 --> 03:21.232
and I don’t know how people have become so stupid

03:21.703 --> 03:32.248
with the teachings of the so-called, their masters.

03:33.810 --> 03:43.729
It’s all money-oriented.
Apart from that, it’s not standing on the truth.

03:45.182 --> 03:53.139
I think this is the second crucifixion of this religion.

03:53.997 --> 04:07.444
There’s no religion which is following really
their principles as been described.

04:08.349 --> 04:15.349
I don’t know how they manage to twist the truth in this manner,

04:15.598 --> 04:21.500
just to make some money or some fuss.

04:21.876 --> 04:28.876
Such a ritualistic stuff is going on in the name of Christ.

04:32.058 --> 04:40.368
Though they have faltered so many times and they had experience

04:40.579 --> 04:50.136
of such a bad influence on the world, to reaction

04:50.458 --> 05:00.653
we don’t know why such a roundabout things come up,

05:01.399 --> 05:07.485
and people accept it, they just accept.

05:07.731 --> 05:10.363
You take any religion.

05:10.992 --> 05:17.992
These days, Islam is talking, I don’t know of what.

05:19.126 --> 05:24.760
There are two important things in the life of Mohammed Sahib.

05:25.339 --> 05:30.440
The first one is called as miraj

05:30.628 --> 05:36.398
which is nothing but the awakening of the kundalini, absolutely clearly.

05:36.773 --> 05:42.395
And the second one He has talked about is jihad.

05:42.879 --> 05:53.029
“Jihad” means killing your bad things, killing your bad nature,

05:53.552 --> 05:56.750
killing all the shadripus within you.

05:57.290 --> 06:01.694
It doesn’t mean that you become a Muslim and kill yourself.

06:01.876 --> 06:05.051
It’s the stupidest thing to do.

06:05.210 --> 06:13.915
Did you become Mussulman just to kill yourself and commit suicide?

06:16.199 --> 06:22.764
Calling it as a ritual, they are saying

06:23.087 --> 06:28.358
that by this you will go to Cennet, into the Heavens.

06:28.885 --> 06:36.144
How can you go? As Muslims they are not religious – not at all.

06:36.370 --> 06:45.823
And then by killing, these sinful people, how will you go

06:46.347 --> 06:52.012
to the Heavens where you’d have enjoyment of Cennet?

06:52.267 --> 07:01.669
There’s no reasoning.
But all these maullanas first of all have finished their education –

07:10.264 --> 07:17.282
have finished their education.
They do not educate themselves at all.

07:17.695 --> 07:25.036
So they have no idea in this world where are they standing,
what is their position.

07:25.879 --> 07:32.245
Some few are educated, but they are also lost

07:32.389 --> 07:37.071
with the idea of having power on these people.

07:37.901 --> 07:46.439
It’s such a shameful thing to do in the name of God
and in the name of spirituality.

07:55.341 --> 08:00.465
Now, our duty is to tell them what is the truth.

08:01.117 --> 08:07.995
Our duty is, bring them to the proper path of spirituality,

08:08.376 --> 08:14.249
because they are all lost.
Christians are lost, Muslim are lost,

08:14.379 --> 08:19.429
Hindus are lost; all of them are lost people.

08:19.652 --> 08:25.333
They have no idea as to what their religion professed

08:25.452 --> 08:29.059
and what they are supposed to do.

08:30.583 --> 08:34.667
Ultimately Christ was crucified,

08:35.109 --> 08:40.459
so you can see how when there was truth,

08:40.603 --> 08:45.844
untruth tried to finish it off; they couldn’t bear it.

08:46.330 --> 08:49.883
We have example of Socrates.

08:50.081 --> 08:54.681
What was the need to kill him? But they killed him.

08:55.016 --> 09:02.547
In this way, so far, we know in the past all

09:02.722 --> 09:09.893
the people who are pivotal for the truth are being finished,

09:10.782 --> 09:14.005
because they don’t want the truth.

09:14.301 --> 09:21.301
They are following some religion
because they can have power over other people:

09:21.513 --> 09:24.999
religion that they have made.

09:25.766 --> 09:37.515
Miraj is a kundalini awakening, and they say that miraj will never take place.

09:38.233 --> 09:42.335
Very good! So many of you have got realization.

09:43.754 --> 09:50.144
You have got your vibrations and cool breeze,

09:50.210 --> 09:54.353
which is described in Koran,

09:54.981 --> 10:01.533
that you should feel the cool breeze.
But who can tell the Muslims?

10:01.858 --> 10:06.340
You talk something – they’ll come and cut your throat, that’s all.

10:06.579 --> 10:13.392
You will go to jihad.
So it’s such a stupid thing they are doing,

10:14.027 --> 10:18.127
and in these modern times as we see,

10:18.462 --> 10:31.574
people have crossed all the maryadas, all the things of a religion.

10:31.905 --> 10:42.122
Before I went to America, and I was surprised
how they have forgotten of our morality.

10:42.400 --> 10:50.782
They have no sense of morality.
And they are selling it in the market, making money out of it.

10:51.356 --> 10:59.744
On the contrary, these Muslims – specially there is a class called Vahhabis –

11:00.009 --> 11:05.715
these people are saying that women are the one

11:05.901 --> 11:14.983
who spoil your morality, and so hide them,
they should be covered.

11:15.362 --> 11:20.968
Any woman who was wearing white chappels in Afghanistan,

11:21.063 --> 11:26.171
they were beating her. “Kill them.”

11:28.020 --> 11:35.011
And so many people in India,
specially in north, have taken to Islamic culture,

11:35.234 --> 11:39.566
and they really ill-treat women in the north.

11:39.717 --> 11:47.723
I was married in the north,
and I know how they have been unkind to women.

11:48.757 --> 11:52.573
So north of India is already contaminated by this,

11:52.748 --> 11:59.719
and the south is contaminated by the fanatic Hindus.

12:00.441 --> 12:12.632
All kinds of rituals, worst type,
bestowed upon only on women, are followed in the south.

12:12.796 --> 12:21.026
They will shave the head of a woman, make her go round a temple,

12:21.271 --> 12:30.054
pour water on her and she is just tumbling around, she is not walking,

12:30.305 --> 12:35.853
and they go on putting water on her – I’ve seen it Myself.

12:36.171 --> 12:44.241
We have sati, is of the killing of the women after the death of their husband.

12:44.610 --> 12:48.687
This is something no one can understand.

12:48.782 --> 12:55.547
Why put all the dharma on women, and why not on the men?

12:55.776 --> 13:03.636
But one thing good, that Hindu religion has now become so much out-of-date

13:04.033 --> 13:10.294
that you can correct all these things.
So many things have been corrected in My own lifetime.

13:10.415 --> 13:19.628
I was surprised, how could they do it?
But in Muslims and Islamism you cannot correct them.

13:20.455 --> 13:29.956
Such horrible things they do to their women,
and whenever you try to help them, it’s impossible.

13:30.165 --> 13:37.165
For example, I started a place for the women who are

13:37.349 --> 13:43.026
left out in world alone, who are like orphans, who have children.

13:43.231 --> 13:50.231
I was surprised, most of them are Muslims,
and they have eight to ten children each.

13:50.573 --> 13:58.964
So now we have to make an orphanage also.
This is what they are producing out of their religion.

13:59.611 --> 14:02.716
You can see this around you.

14:02.922 --> 14:08.933
Even Hindus have a funny system of widowhood.

14:09.130 --> 14:12.814
If they make a woman widow, it’s terrible,

14:13.070 --> 14:20.070
and they are poor things, some of them; and quite a lot of them are living in Vrindavan.

14:20.705 --> 14:27.705
I was told that they get one rupee per day.

14:28.314 --> 14:31.295
And what do they do? They sing bhajans.

14:31.390 --> 14:36.132
In one rupee, how can you live in this country?

14:37.149 --> 14:43.872
They are good at creating so many beggars and beggar-women.

14:45.150 --> 14:51.980
If that is the religion, better not have it.
We have had enough of this.

14:52.793 --> 14:58.476
All kinds of ritualism through this Brahmanism.

14:58.714 --> 15:03.415
These  brahmins are absolutely good-for-nothing people.

15:03.682 --> 15:10.682
Those who try to teach religion have to be something of a great level.

15:11.486 --> 15:15.270
So in Sahaja Yoga you give up everything,

15:15.676 --> 15:26.746
because this is all nothing but mud,
and in the mud you will be finished.

15:28.190 --> 15:33.882
You have to tell people about it.
What are they going to do?

15:36.627 --> 15:42.736
They have misused the religion for all kinds of bad thing.

15:43.236 --> 15:52.360
Like in England if somebody dies, they must have champagne.

15:53.461 --> 15:58.524
When they go for the burial they must have champagne.

15:59.093 --> 16:05.209
I was surprised: how is it they are going to have champagne for this?

16:05.591 --> 16:13.056
And how is it, out of religion you say, all their priests also drink? – no question.

16:15.771 --> 16:19.586
One priest came to Sahaja Yoga, I was very happy.

16:19.897 --> 16:24.733
But he said, “I’ll come to Sahaj, but I will not give up drinking.”

16:24.830 --> 16:26.313
I said, “Why?”

16:26.414 --> 16:30.625
“Because it’s written in the Bible that you must drink.”
Accha! I didn’t know.

16:30.824 --> 16:37.824
How could it be? How could Christ say that you should drink?

16:38.188 --> 16:45.000
He was not only a realized Self, but He was Realization Himself.”

16:45.198 --> 16:50.860
He said, “He has said it. Whatever You may say, He has said it.”

16:51.309 --> 16:52.716
“Where?”

16:52.819 --> 16:56.593
He said, “He went to one wedding. All right.

16:56.721 --> 17:03.429
In that wedding, He made wine for the people.”
But He did not.

17:03.635 --> 17:11.668
He went there, and in such a short time
He just put His hand in the water

17:11.833 --> 17:18.833
and it started tasting like grape juice.

17:18.987 --> 17:23.191
And grape juice has the same word “wine” in Hebrew language.

17:23.366 --> 17:29.260
I said, “I can do that. That doesn’t mean I like people to drink.”

17:29.308 --> 17:34.893
I mean, who can say such a nonsense?

17:37.446 --> 17:44.446
It is awareness which is important, chetana is important.

17:44.819 --> 17:52.178
And if you spoil your awareness, how can you be Sahaja yogis?

17:53.780 --> 17:59.602
It was impossible to tell them that you cannot drink.

17:59.936 --> 18:04.552
But drinking even in India has become very common.

18:04.783 --> 18:14.261
It is all against Christianity, it’s against Hinduism, against Islam.

18:14.856 --> 18:22.753
And though it is written down in Koran
“Don’t drink,” they drink, they all drink.

18:22.966 --> 18:29.306
And instead of following the religion,
they have become the greatest sinner.

18:29.468 --> 18:34.804
Is that what Christ wanted them to do?

18:37.540 --> 18:44.538
You have to be pure people. Nirmala tattwam you must have.

18:44.818 --> 18:51.934
That’s what it is. Also I told you a story about Shalivahana,

18:52.069 --> 18:57.272
who met Christ in Kashmir.

18:57.783 --> 19:02.839
And he asked Christ about His name
and His country. He says,

19:02.951 --> 19:07.135
“I come from a country where people are malecch.”

19:07.349 --> 19:16.045
“Malecch” means those who have a desire for mala, for filth.

19:17.163 --> 19:24.410
So he told Him, “Why don’t You go
and teach them Nirmala tattwam?” Shalivahana said.

19:24.608 --> 19:28.491
That is what Nirmal tattwam you have got,

19:28.627 --> 19:41.526
which purifies you, which cleanses you,
which gives you joy, happiness and the truth.

19:41.799 --> 19:46.015
This is what you should ask for.

19:47.433 --> 19:52.094
Otherwise it’s all darkness, you don’t see the light.

19:52.237 --> 19:58.162
Whether you are Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anyone,

19:58.550 --> 20:05.550
you cannot see light of truth; and you have to take the light of truth.

20:07.175 --> 20:12.218
But after that, what you have to do?

20:12.424 --> 20:17.532
You have to give it to others, you have to transform others.

20:17.752 --> 20:23.905
You have worked very hard for it. And sometimes I am surprised

20:23.997 --> 20:33.174
how people who are doing such a good work are so humble and so good.

20:34.368 --> 20:39.204
How have they achieved it, I can’t understand.

20:39.897 --> 20:47.915
Of course there are some who are money-oriented,
who are power-oriented,

20:48.113 --> 20:51.479
but these things do not give joy.

20:51.574 --> 21:02.771
What gives joy is your inner light of truth

21:03.175 --> 21:06.887
which you have, all of you have, as you know.

21:07.062 --> 21:15.403
You all have experienced.
But I would say this experience has to be given to others –

21:15.665 --> 21:22.292
it’s not only for you – given to as many people possible.

21:22.450 --> 21:28.201
But how many do that? How many people do that?

21:28.639 --> 21:35.216
We have also Sikh community. They came to Sahaj,

21:35.435 --> 21:40.534
but they said, “We cannot worship Goddess.”
I said, “Why?”

21:40.712 --> 21:52.338
Surprised at it,
because Shri Guru Nanak has talked about the Goddess, the Devi.

21:52.615 --> 22:03.231
The first sentence of His book is “Adya.”
“Adya” is the Adi Shakti.

22:05.209 --> 22:13.759
And for this if the Sikhs stupidly say,
then why do they have a Chandigarh?

22:14.026 --> 22:22.093
They’re so stupid also, nothing to really compare.

22:22.466 --> 22:29.155
Now, you have to understand, have you given up all that nonsense or not in your lives,

22:29.666 --> 22:36.155
or are you all sticking onto the same? That is very important.

22:36.391 --> 22:43.600
As long as you are sticking onto the same, there will be a problem.

22:43.838 --> 22:48.423
Sahaja Yoga does so much. I was surprised,

22:48.610 --> 22:54.324
in America there are three hundred Sahaja yogis,
nothing happened to them.

22:54.588 --> 23:05.766
Some were on the tower, some were on the street,
all of them were there and nothing has happened to them.

23:06.058 --> 23:09.843
Some of them said that “Somebody told us inside,

23:11.430 --> 23:18.635
told us inside that ‘run away’ and we started running in the other direction.

23:18.964 --> 23:24.190
” Some were delayed; I don’t know how, all these three hundreds.

23:25.854 --> 23:39.552
But such a devil of these people who are thinking of destroying
the whole world are coming round.

23:39.775 --> 23:46.239
This is the reason I went to America, and I told them that this war will be over

23:46.416 --> 23:53.524
before Diwali, and it ended; before Diwali this war will be over, and it ended.

23:53.778 --> 24:00.778
What a stupid thing to think they can destroy the creation of God like this.

24:00.952 --> 24:08.536
Who are they? How have they got the right to destroy the world?

24:10.257 --> 24:15.266
But that is what is a human nonsense.

24:15.969 --> 24:21.362
Christ came on this Earth, He worked for a long time

24:21.529 --> 24:26.209
and He was to be crucified, so He got crucified.

24:26.535 --> 24:32.667
But crucifixion is not our glory. Our glory is His resurrection.

24:33.723 --> 24:39.048
That  was resurrected, no doubt.

24:39.255 --> 24:45.252
To say that it’s not possible and all that – who are you to say that?

24:45.482 --> 24:51.759
What do you know about spirituality?
What do you know what can happen to a person

24:51.894 --> 24:58.855
who is spiritual, spiritually equipped, what can work out in Him?

24:58.993 --> 25:06.074
Whatever we know about human beings,
we try to draw conclusions which are all wrong.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.743
See in your life.

25:10.394 --> 25:15.291
There are so many miracles in the lives of Sahaja yogis,

25:15.428 --> 25:19.949
and they – I told somebody that “You’d better compile them.”

25:20.206 --> 25:27.465
So he said, “Within one month all those letters have come up to my head.”
In one month!

25:27.581 --> 25:30.700
I said, “Forget it, don’t write.”

25:30.779 --> 25:36.527
It’s not one or two; from all over the world people are writing.

25:37.327 --> 25:44.327
But those who are intellectuals are very difficult.

25:45.267 --> 25:51.405
It’s impossible to put this into their heads.

25:51.822 --> 25:56.544
So whatever is possible, we have to do our maximum,

25:56.775 --> 26:00.140
put our attention to people who want it.

26:00.263 --> 26:09.163
Now in India it has gone to into jails,
it has gone into schools and everywhere.

26:09.322 --> 26:13.888
And somebody told Me the other day that even in a Catholic church

26:14.026 --> 26:17.202
they have started taking to Sahaja Yoga;

26:17.385 --> 26:22.434
I don’t know what’s wrong in their heads and how they have managed.

26:22.547 --> 26:29.547
But that’s how Sahaja Yoga is spreading. But it has to spread much more.

26:29.768 --> 26:35.606
You have to, all of you individually should go round and work it out,

26:35.950 --> 26:40.627
and talk about it. But Sahaja yogis are little shy.

26:41.902 --> 26:48.798
Once I was going by plane, and one lady was very, very hot.

26:49.114 --> 26:54.739
So I asked her what guru she follows, she told Me the name.

26:55.010 --> 27:01.075
I was surprised that she didn’t know anything about spirituality.

27:01.868 --> 27:08.868
And these people have huge houses and big temples, everything,

27:09.044 --> 27:15.498
and she was telling Me the praise of her guru.
I thought, “She is very shameless.

27:15.583 --> 27:21.878
She hasn’t got anything in her, she’s so very hot,
and she’s talking about it.”

27:22.117 --> 27:27.552
But Sahaja yogis won’t. I was surprised,
why Sahaja yogis don’t talk about it?

27:28.114 --> 27:33.008
But the other day I had gone with somebody in the market

27:33.488 --> 27:36.847
and I had a Sahaja yogi with him, and I was surprised,

27:36.949 --> 27:43.424
he started telling them about Me, and he started giving them realization.

27:43.590 --> 27:49.901
And they were very happy about it. Everywhere you go you have neighbors,

27:50.044 --> 27:57.044
you go to markets, everywhere you should go and talk about it.

27:58.395 --> 28:03.865
Like they sing these carols – we should also have bhajans and things

28:04.004 --> 28:07.895
to tell other people, we have to tell them.

28:08.046 --> 28:14.354
Why are you so shy? This shyness is not going to help Sahaja Yoga.

28:15.483 --> 28:20.567
So please see that you try to give realizations to others.

28:20.693 --> 28:26.112
You have powers; have faith in yourself.
I think they lack in faith

28:26.398 --> 28:31.879
or whatever it is, there are very few people who come out and do it.

28:32.188 --> 28:38.349
Italy I have seen, and also Austria, Australia;

28:38.468 --> 28:44.362
Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot because of their conviction

28:44.685 --> 28:50.631
that we have to give others what we have. We have to share it.

28:50.885 --> 28:57.360
From the life of Christ one has to understand His sacrifice.

28:58.348 --> 29:06.295
It’s such a lot of sacrifice – to be crucified like that, with the thieves.

29:06.644 --> 29:12.369
But He did it. In the same way when you all people

29:12.528 --> 29:19.583
want to do Sahaja Yoga work, you shouldn’t think, “What will happen to my grandfather,

29:19.651 --> 29:27.139
what will happen to my grandmother?” I mean, whatever letters I get are all about this.

29:27.360 --> 29:32.079
It’s very funny. They are only worried about some relations,

29:32.189 --> 29:36.148
they are not worried about the relations all over the world even.

29:36.283 --> 29:41.841
Worried about the wife or children: I get only letters like this.

29:42.061 --> 29:46.391
Nobody writes to Me that you have given realizations to so many.

29:46.557 --> 29:57.121
They never write how they have been able to achieve
spreading of Sahaja Yoga. o one writes – very surprising.

29:57.411 --> 30:00.210
You have to tell Me.

30:00.322 --> 30:08.399
I hope you all people understand the importance of spreading Sahaja Yoga.

30:08.736 --> 30:13.737
If you don’t do that, you are absolutely useless.

30:13.944 --> 30:18.963
The greatest thing for Me, as you have so many lights here,

30:19.066 --> 30:23.746
we should have many more Sahaja yogis all over the world.

30:23.886 --> 30:29.831
If you want to change this world and if you want to avoid all the

30:29.967 --> 30:37.568
trials and tribulations of the useless life they are leading,
you have to save them.

30:37.743 --> 30:42.312
You have to salvage them. That’s your job,

30:42.424 --> 30:49.424
that’s what you have to pay for Sahaja Yoga –
not for yourself, not for yourself.

30:49.734 --> 30:58.366
Don’t get worried about yourself. If you read the letters I get, you’ll get disgusted.

31:11.231 --> 31:21.292
Now, some other kind of letters I get, that they want to marry – all right.

31:21.757 --> 31:28.420
There are many girls who claim that
“We have been applying for four years, we couldn’t get married.”

31:28.696 --> 31:34.377
Firstly you must know, out of proportion women are there.
They are very good.

31:34.567 --> 31:36.813
Say, if there are forty boys,

31:36.940 --> 31:42.746
there would be at least a hundred-and-twenty,
or maybe even a hundred -and-fifty girls.

31:42.953 --> 31:48.079
So now, whom should we marry those girls? Just think of it.

31:48.317 --> 31:53.675
But they write letters of complaint that
“We have applied four times.”

31:53.928 --> 31:59.790
We can’t, we can’t help it.
So you go outside, marry anywhere you feel like.

31:59.912 --> 32:05.560
Or else you wait and see, and dedicate your life to Sahaja Yoga.

32:05.704 --> 32:10.018
It’s a very difficult thing when they go on complaining

32:10.180 --> 32:15.466
that “I should be married, and I haven’t got married as yet.”

32:15.730 --> 32:19.058
Marriage was never our idea.

32:19.185 --> 32:22.897
But then we had to allow marriages.

32:23.076 --> 32:27.338
And now it has become the main issue with everyone.

32:27.569 --> 32:34.503
Either they are not married;
if they are married, they are not happy;

32:34.844 --> 32:38.721
if they are divorced, they must be married again.

32:38.944 --> 32:44.508
All sorts of things and complications, for which I am not prepared.

32:44.683 --> 32:47.401
Sahaja Yoga is not for that.

32:47.766 --> 32:53.285
If your marriage is not successful, it’s not My job.

32:53.436 --> 32:58.743
And if goes on, we’ll have to stop marriages.

33:00.885 --> 33:04.060
I don’t want you to write all these things to Me.

33:04.188 --> 33:10.354
It shows how poor you are in Sahaja Yoga.

33:11.217 --> 33:16.938
Why not write to Me how many people you have given realization?

33:17.323 --> 33:21.214
That will make Me happy;

33:21.635 --> 33:28.222
instead of complaining about your wife and – that’s not My concern.

33:29.182 --> 33:34.989
And as it came, we have married you; if you cannot carry on, it’s your duty.

33:37.073 --> 33:44.113
And this is what is the snag of Sahaja Yoga.

33:44.566 --> 33:52.055
In every religious movement there have been so many wrong things,

33:52.452 --> 33:59.563
while in Sahaja Yoga I think marriages is a very big hurdle.

33:59.865 --> 34:05.833
Moreover, boys don’t come;
because in India, very easy to marry boys,

34:05.999 --> 34:13.784
you can also get money, this, that.
But girls, there are five times more than the boys.

34:14.078 --> 34:20.003
Boys don’t want to marry. They’ll have their own marriages,
though they are Sahaja yogis.

34:21.182 --> 34:28.469
So I can’t understand why, in Sahaja Yoga also after coming to realization,

34:29.071 --> 34:33.857
to them marriage is a very important issue.

34:34.056 --> 34:41.056
What is most important is that how many people you give realization.

34:42.672 --> 34:45.722
That is your life.

34:47.183 --> 34:53.327
If a lotus is there it will open, but it must give fragrance.

34:53.592 --> 34:58.460
Even the lotus has a responsibility.

34:58.846 --> 35:05.149
Then what about you people? I’m not saying you get crucified like Christ – no.

35:05.385 --> 35:13.467
I said you enjoy your life, you have peace and stability, balance.

35:13.634 --> 35:20.848
But at the same time you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

35:21.205 --> 35:27.315
This is what is your job now. Your job is not important;

35:27.783 --> 35:33.489
only this is important, how many people you give realization.

35:33.735 --> 35:39.480
It’s very, very difficult, because they have made

35:39.694 --> 35:47.479
a mess of all the great incarnations, all those great Sufis and saints.

35:47.598 --> 35:51.716
But at least you people don’t do that.

35:51.824 --> 35:59.517
So please try to think whom can you give realization,
to whom you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

36:00.014 --> 36:02.005
You have to spread out.

36:02.180 --> 36:08.012
And next time I hope, I hear from you how
many people you have given realization.

36:08.210 --> 36:16.286
That is the greatest justification for the crucifixion of Christ,

36:16.788 --> 36:21.152
for His birth, for His coming on this earth, His Agnya.

36:21.422 --> 36:25.305
And if you have given realization, they have crossed the Agnya,

36:25.657 --> 36:31.435
they have gone beyond, and they are in Sahasrara.

36:32.098 --> 36:37.948
So in Sahaja Yoga you understand everything. It’s very easy to understand.

36:38.131 --> 36:44.078
Sahaja Yoga is the simplest thing to understand – but after realization.

36:44.245 --> 36:51.895
So you have to go round and see
how many people you can give realization.

36:53.307 --> 37:01.438
Everything is all right, all your worshipping is all right,
your puja is all right;

37:01.859 --> 37:09.374
but what is most important is
how many people you have given realization.

37:09.794 --> 37:14.618
I would like to know how many people have given.

37:15.693 --> 37:22.134
And specially with ladies. Ladies are rather weak in giving realization.

37:22.269 --> 37:26.498
They can do a lot, I know, they can.

37:26.673 --> 37:34.404
After all, I am also a woman. But somehow I find the ladies in Sahaja Yoga

37:34.962 --> 37:41.870
are not of a level. They can do a lot, a lot,

37:42.038 --> 37:47.227
but somehow they don’t understand the importance of their life.

37:47.457 --> 37:50.655
You are very important.

37:51.267 --> 37:55.585
How many people there are who have got realizations?

37:56.133 --> 38:04.567
There were so many Sufis who got realization, they write poetry – finished.

38:05.305 --> 38:11.241
There were so many saints who did so much, wrote so many things.

38:12.873 --> 38:19.783
In India we had so many saints; they wrote all these things, people will read them,

38:20.142 --> 38:27.951
but nothing happens. You have, you have the art of giving realization.

38:28.135 --> 38:32.004
You know about kundalini, you know all about it.

38:32.123 --> 38:36.016
Go ahead and talk to people.

38:36.140 --> 38:44.911
I was alone when I started Sahaja Yoga, and I am a woman.

38:45.092 --> 38:50.112
So what about you? There’s a now challenge for all of you.

38:50.326 --> 38:53.178
How many people have you made Sahaja yogis?

38:53.340 --> 38:59.588
Even in your family people are not Sahaja yogis,
your daughter is not, your son is not.

38:59.886 --> 39:05.420
So what’s the use of singing glory to Christ?

39:05.949 --> 39:13.517
If you are singing glory to Him,
you must make people cross their Agnya.

39:14.525 --> 39:20.110
He’s so highly placed within us, but you have never respected Him,

39:20.470 --> 39:27.671
that such a highly placed personality you have crossed over,
so why not others?

39:29.676 --> 39:35.572
Let us see from today’s Puja

39:35.826 --> 39:40.096
how much determination you have.

39:40.696 --> 39:48.521
You should know that a Goddess doesn’t come with your own demands,

39:48.708 --> 39:54.041
She comes on Her own. She has Her own timing.

39:54.257 --> 39:59.740
But if you are people in majority

39:59.923 --> 40:06.896
who have really become saints and making others saintly, then I am for you.

40:07.062 --> 40:09.433
Otherwise I am available to you:

40:09.584 --> 40:13.658
you can have My vibrations, you can have My pujas,

40:13.867 --> 40:16.972
all these things are permitted, no doubt.

40:17.092 --> 40:24.755
But for that you are only capable,

40:24.937 --> 40:30.461
you are only entitled for that if you are doing Sahaja Yoga,

40:30.581 --> 40:35.728
if you are spreading Sahaja Yoga,
if you are giving to others;

40:36.211 --> 40:42.203
then only you will be considered really

40:42.480 --> 40:48.792
capable of receiving the vibrations of the Goddess.

40:50.638 --> 40:54.957
In some countries if it is so much powerful,

40:55.085 --> 40:59.542
why not with your country, with your neighborhood,

40:59.762 --> 41:04.902
with your friends, with your relations is possible?

41:06.920 --> 41:10.221
So tonight you have to decide

41:10.359 --> 41:16.741
that you are going to dedicate yourself in giving it to others –

41:16.900 --> 41:22.095
it’s very joy-giving – and talking about Sahaja Yoga.

41:22.600 --> 41:24.801
May God bless you.
