00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:08.446
Christmas Puja, Ganapatipule, India
December 25, 2001

00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:18.447
Nice to see so many Sahaja yogis coming here

00:00:18.742 --> 00:00:22.376
during the Christmas Puja.

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:30.247
Christianity has spread all over the world,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.110
and there are so many so-called Christians

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:40.933
who say they follow Christ –

00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:45.999
I don’t know from which angle.

00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:56.369
Christ was the embodiment of Paramchaitanya.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.245
He was Omkara. He was Shri Ganesha.

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:12.375
And those
who follow Him have to be very different people.

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:19.393
But always happens in every religion

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:29.362
that they go at random into the opposite direction,

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.962
completely opposite.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:42.930
The essence of Christ’s life was detachment and sacrifice.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:51.606
For a person who is detached, there’s nothing like sacrifice.

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:57.178
He sees his life as just a drama.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.900
Such a great personality came on this earth

00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:07.313
and created this so-called Christian religion,

00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:15.183
which has gone into wars, all kinds of hypocritical thing,

00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:20.643
and now the people are discovering about it.

00:02:22.282 --> 00:02:31.202
He stood for truth, and Christians don’t know what is the truth is.

00:02:32.247 --> 00:02:37.998
The truth is that you are the spirit,

00:02:38.197 --> 00:02:42.132
and you have to become the spirit.

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:50.957
He’s the one who has talked about second birth, of realization.

00:02:52.764 --> 00:02:59.017
But they have forgotten about what He said,
what they have to achieve.

00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:06.561
It’s such a funny thing that all these great people came on this Earth

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:14.040
and created a proper religion for our ascent,

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:21.232
and I don’t know how people have become so stupid

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:32.248
with the teachings of the so-called, their masters.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:43.729
It’s all money-oriented.
Apart from that, it’s not standing on the truth.

00:03:45.182 --> 00:03:53.139
I think this is the second crucifixion of this religion.

00:03:53.997 --> 00:04:07.444
There’s no religion which is following really
their principles as been described.

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:15.349
I don’t know how they manage to twist the truth in this manner,

00:04:15.598 --> 00:04:21.500
just to make some money or some fuss.

00:04:21.876 --> 00:04:28.876
Such a ritualistic stuff is going on in the name of Christ.

00:04:32.058 --> 00:04:40.368
Though they have faltered so many times and they had experience

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:50.136
of such a bad influence on the world, to reaction

00:04:50.458 --> 00:05:00.653
we don’t know why such a roundabout things come up,

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:07.485
and people accept it, they just accept.

00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:10.363
You take any religion.

00:05:10.992 --> 00:05:17.992
These days, Islam is talking, I don’t know of what.

00:05:19.126 --> 00:05:24.760
There are two important things in the life of Mohammed Sahib.

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:30.440
The first one is called as miraj

00:05:30.628 --> 00:05:36.398
which is nothing but the awakening of the kundalini, absolutely clearly.

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:42.395
And the second one He has talked about is jihad.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:53.029
“Jihad” means killing your bad things, killing your bad nature,

00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:56.750
killing all the shadripus within you.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.694
It doesn’t mean that you become a Muslim and kill yourself.

00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:05.051
It’s the stupidest thing to do.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:13.915
Did you become Mussulman just to kill yourself and commit suicide?

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:22.764
Calling it as a ritual, they are saying

00:06:23.087 --> 00:06:28.358
that by this you will go to Cennet, into the Heavens.

00:06:28.885 --> 00:06:36.144
How can you go? As Muslims they are not religious – not at all.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:45.823
And then by killing, these sinful people, how will you go

00:06:46.347 --> 00:06:52.012
to the Heavens where you’d have enjoyment of Cennet?

00:06:52.267 --> 00:07:01.669
There’s no reasoning.
But all these maullanas first of all have finished their education –

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:17.282
have finished their education.
They do not educate themselves at all.

00:07:17.695 --> 00:07:25.036
So they have no idea in this world where are they standing,
what is their position.

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:32.245
Some few are educated, but they are also lost

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:37.071
with the idea of having power on these people.

00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:46.439
It’s such a shameful thing to do in the name of God
and in the name of spirituality.

00:07:55.341 --> 00:08:00.465
Now, our duty is to tell them what is the truth.

00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:07.995
Our duty is, bring them to the proper path of spirituality,

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:14.249
because they are all lost.
Christians are lost, Muslim are lost,

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:19.429
Hindus are lost; all of them are lost people.

00:08:19.652 --> 00:08:25.333
They have no idea as to what their religion professed

00:08:25.452 --> 00:08:29.059
and what they are supposed to do.

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:34.667
Ultimately Christ was crucified,

00:08:35.109 --> 00:08:40.459
so you can see how when there was truth,

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:45.844
untruth tried to finish it off; they couldn’t bear it.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.883
We have example of Socrates.

00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:54.681
What was the need to kill him? But they killed him.

00:08:55.016 --> 00:09:02.547
In this way, so far, we know in the past all

00:09:02.722 --> 00:09:09.893
the people who are pivotal for the truth are being finished,

00:09:10.782 --> 00:09:14.005
because they don’t want the truth.

00:09:14.301 --> 00:09:21.301
They are following some religion
because they can have power over other people:

00:09:21.513 --> 00:09:24.999
religion that they have made.

00:09:25.766 --> 00:09:37.515
Miraj is a kundalini awakening, and they say that miraj will never take place.

00:09:38.233 --> 00:09:42.335
Very good! So many of you have got realization.

00:09:43.754 --> 00:09:50.144
You have got your vibrations and cool breeze,

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.353
which is described in Koran,

00:09:54.981 --> 00:10:01.533
that you should feel the cool breeze.
But who can tell the Muslims?

00:10:01.858 --> 00:10:06.340
You talk something – they’ll come and cut your throat, that’s all.

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:13.392
You will go to jihad.
So it’s such a stupid thing they are doing,

00:10:14.027 --> 00:10:18.127
and in these modern times as we see,

00:10:18.462 --> 00:10:31.574
people have crossed all the maryadas, all the things of a religion.

00:10:31.905 --> 00:10:42.122
Before I went to America, and I was surprised
how they have forgotten of our morality.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:50.782
They have no sense of morality.
And they are selling it in the market, making money out of it.

00:10:51.356 --> 00:10:59.744
On the contrary, these Muslims – specially there is a class called Vahhabis –

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:05.715
these people are saying that women are the one

00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:14.983
who spoil your morality, and so hide them,
they should be covered.

00:11:15.362 --> 00:11:20.968
Any woman who was wearing white chappels in Afghanistan,

00:11:21.063 --> 00:11:26.171
they were beating her. “Kill them.”

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:35.011
And so many people in India,
specially in north, have taken to Islamic culture,

00:11:35.234 --> 00:11:39.566
and they really ill-treat women in the north.

00:11:39.717 --> 00:11:47.723
I was married in the north,
and I know how they have been unkind to women.

00:11:48.757 --> 00:11:52.573
So north of India is already contaminated by this,

00:11:52.748 --> 00:11:59.719
and the south is contaminated by the fanatic Hindus.

00:12:00.441 --> 00:12:12.632
All kinds of rituals, worst type,
bestowed upon only on women, are followed in the south.

00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:21.026
They will shave the head of a woman, make her go round a temple,

00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:30.054
pour water on her and she is just tumbling around, she is not walking,

00:12:30.305 --> 00:12:35.853
and they go on putting water on her – I’ve seen it Myself.

00:12:36.171 --> 00:12:44.241
We have sati, is of the killing of the women after the death of their husband.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:48.687
This is something no one can understand.

00:12:48.782 --> 00:12:55.547
Why put all the dharma on women, and why not on the men?

00:12:55.776 --> 00:13:03.636
But one thing good, that Hindu religion has now become so much out-of-date

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:10.294
that you can correct all these things.
So many things have been corrected in My own lifetime.

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:19.628
I was surprised, how could they do it?
But in Muslims and Islamism you cannot correct them.

00:13:20.455 --> 00:13:29.956
Such horrible things they do to their women,
and whenever you try to help them, it’s impossible.

00:13:30.165 --> 00:13:37.165
For example, I started a place for the women who are

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:43.026
left out in world alone, who are like orphans, who have children.

00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:50.231
I was surprised, most of them are Muslims,
and they have eight to ten children each.

00:13:50.573 --> 00:13:58.964
So now we have to make an orphanage also.
This is what they are producing out of their religion.

00:13:59.611 --> 00:14:02.716
You can see this around you.

00:14:02.922 --> 00:14:08.933
Even Hindus have a funny system of widowhood.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.814
If they make a woman widow, it’s terrible,

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:20.070
and they are poor things, some of them; and quite a lot of them are living in Vrindavan.

00:14:20.705 --> 00:14:27.705
I was told that they get one rupee per day.

00:14:28.314 --> 00:14:31.295
And what do they do? They sing bhajans.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:36.132
In one rupee, how can you live in this country?

00:14:37.149 --> 00:14:43.872
They are good at creating so many beggars and beggar-women.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:51.980
If that is the religion, better not have it.
We have had enough of this.

00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:58.476
All kinds of ritualism through this Brahmanism.

00:14:58.714 --> 00:15:03.415
These  brahmins are absolutely good-for-nothing people.

00:15:03.682 --> 00:15:10.682
Those who try to teach religion have to be something of a great level.

00:15:11.486 --> 00:15:15.270
So in Sahaja Yoga you give up everything,

00:15:15.676 --> 00:15:26.746
because this is all nothing but mud,
and in the mud you will be finished.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:33.882
You have to tell people about it.
What are they going to do?

00:15:36.627 --> 00:15:42.736
They have misused the religion for all kinds of bad thing.

00:15:43.236 --> 00:15:52.360
Like in England if somebody dies, they must have champagne.

00:15:53.461 --> 00:15:58.524
When they go for the burial they must have champagne.

00:15:59.093 --> 00:16:05.209
I was surprised: how is it they are going to have champagne for this?

00:16:05.591 --> 00:16:13.056
And how is it, out of religion you say, all their priests also drink? – no question.

00:16:15.771 --> 00:16:19.586
One priest came to Sahaja Yoga, I was very happy.

00:16:19.897 --> 00:16:24.733
But he said, “I’ll come to Sahaj, but I will not give up drinking.”

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.313
I said, “Why?”

00:16:26.414 --> 00:16:30.625
“Because it’s written in the Bible that you must drink.”
Accha! I didn’t know.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:37.824
How could it be? How could Christ say that you should drink?

00:16:38.188 --> 00:16:45.000
He was not only a realized Self, but He was Realization Himself.”

00:16:45.198 --> 00:16:50.860
He said, “He has said it. Whatever You may say, He has said it.”

00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:52.716
“Where?”

00:16:52.819 --> 00:16:56.593
He said, “He went to one wedding. All right.

00:16:56.721 --> 00:17:03.429
In that wedding, He made wine for the people.”
But He did not.

00:17:03.635 --> 00:17:11.668
He went there, and in such a short time
He just put His hand in the water

00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:18.833
and it started tasting like grape juice.

00:17:18.987 --> 00:17:23.191
And grape juice has the same word “wine” in Hebrew language.

00:17:23.366 --> 00:17:29.260
I said, “I can do that. That doesn’t mean I like people to drink.”

00:17:29.308 --> 00:17:34.893
I mean, who can say such a nonsense?

00:17:37.446 --> 00:17:44.446
It is awareness which is important, chetana is important.

00:17:44.819 --> 00:17:52.178
And if you spoil your awareness, how can you be Sahaja yogis?

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:59.602
It was impossible to tell them that you cannot drink.

00:17:59.936 --> 00:18:04.552
But drinking even in India has become very common.

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:14.261
It is all against Christianity, it’s against Hinduism, against Islam.

00:18:14.856 --> 00:18:22.753
And though it is written down in Koran
“Don’t drink,” they drink, they all drink.

00:18:22.966 --> 00:18:29.306
And instead of following the religion,
they have become the greatest sinner.

00:18:29.468 --> 00:18:34.804
Is that what Christ wanted them to do?

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:44.538
You have to be pure people. Nirmala tattwam you must have.

00:18:44.818 --> 00:18:51.934
That’s what it is. Also I told you a story about Shalivahana,

00:18:52.069 --> 00:18:57.272
who met Christ in Kashmir.

00:18:57.783 --> 00:19:02.839
And he asked Christ about His name
and His country. He says,

00:19:02.951 --> 00:19:07.135
“I come from a country where people are malecch.”

00:19:07.349 --> 00:19:16.045
“Malecch” means those who have a desire for mala, for filth.

00:19:17.163 --> 00:19:24.410
So he told Him, “Why don’t You go
and teach them Nirmala tattwam?” Shalivahana said.

00:19:24.608 --> 00:19:28.491
That is what Nirmal tattwam you have got,

00:19:28.627 --> 00:19:41.526
which purifies you, which cleanses you,
which gives you joy, happiness and the truth.

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:46.015
This is what you should ask for.

00:19:47.433 --> 00:19:52.094
Otherwise it’s all darkness, you don’t see the light.

00:19:52.237 --> 00:19:58.162
Whether you are Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anyone,

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:05.550
you cannot see light of truth; and you have to take the light of truth.

00:20:07.175 --> 00:20:12.218
But after that, what you have to do?

00:20:12.424 --> 00:20:17.532
You have to give it to others, you have to transform others.

00:20:17.752 --> 00:20:23.905
You have worked very hard for it. And sometimes I am surprised

00:20:23.997 --> 00:20:33.174
how people who are doing such a good work are so humble and so good.

00:20:34.368 --> 00:20:39.204
How have they achieved it, I can’t understand.

00:20:39.897 --> 00:20:47.915
Of course there are some who are money-oriented,
who are power-oriented,

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:51.479
but these things do not give joy.

00:20:51.574 --> 00:21:02.771
What gives joy is your inner light of truth

00:21:03.175 --> 00:21:06.887
which you have, all of you have, as you know.

00:21:07.062 --> 00:21:15.403
You all have experienced.
But I would say this experience has to be given to others –

00:21:15.665 --> 00:21:22.292
it’s not only for you – given to as many people possible.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:28.201
But how many do that? How many people do that?

00:21:28.639 --> 00:21:35.216
We have also Sikh community. They came to Sahaj,

00:21:35.435 --> 00:21:40.534
but they said, “We cannot worship Goddess.”
I said, “Why?”

00:21:40.712 --> 00:21:52.338
Surprised at it,
because Shri Guru Nanak has talked about the Goddess, the Devi.

00:21:52.615 --> 00:22:03.231
The first sentence of His book is “Adya.”
“Adya” is the Adi Shakti.

00:22:05.209 --> 00:22:13.759
And for this if the Sikhs stupidly say,
then why do they have a Chandigarh?

00:22:14.026 --> 00:22:22.093
They’re so stupid also, nothing to really compare.

00:22:22.466 --> 00:22:29.155
Now, you have to understand, have you given up all that nonsense or not in your lives,

00:22:29.666 --> 00:22:36.155
or are you all sticking onto the same? That is very important.

00:22:36.391 --> 00:22:43.600
As long as you are sticking onto the same, there will be a problem.

00:22:43.838 --> 00:22:48.423
Sahaja Yoga does so much. I was surprised,

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:54.324
in America there are three hundred Sahaja yogis,
nothing happened to them.

00:22:54.588 --> 00:23:05.766
Some were on the tower, some were on the street,
all of them were there and nothing has happened to them.

00:23:06.058 --> 00:23:09.843
Some of them said that “Somebody told us inside,

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:18.635
told us inside that ‘run away’ and we started running in the other direction.

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:24.190
” Some were delayed; I don’t know how, all these three hundreds.

00:23:25.854 --> 00:23:39.552
But such a devil of these people who are thinking of destroying
the whole world are coming round.

00:23:39.775 --> 00:23:46.239
This is the reason I went to America, and I told them that this war will be over

00:23:46.416 --> 00:23:53.524
before Diwali, and it ended; before Diwali this war will be over, and it ended.

00:23:53.778 --> 00:24:00.778
What a stupid thing to think they can destroy the creation of God like this.

00:24:00.952 --> 00:24:08.536
Who are they? How have they got the right to destroy the world?

00:24:10.257 --> 00:24:15.266
But that is what is a human nonsense.

00:24:15.969 --> 00:24:21.362
Christ came on this Earth, He worked for a long time

00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:26.209
and He was to be crucified, so He got crucified.

00:24:26.535 --> 00:24:32.667
But crucifixion is not our glory. Our glory is His resurrection.

00:24:33.723 --> 00:24:39.048
That  was resurrected, no doubt.

00:24:39.255 --> 00:24:45.252
To say that it’s not possible and all that – who are you to say that?

00:24:45.482 --> 00:24:51.759
What do you know about spirituality?
What do you know what can happen to a person

00:24:51.894 --> 00:24:58.855
who is spiritual, spiritually equipped, what can work out in Him?

00:24:58.993 --> 00:25:06.074
Whatever we know about human beings,
we try to draw conclusions which are all wrong.

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:09.743
See in your life.

00:25:10.394 --> 00:25:15.291
There are so many miracles in the lives of Sahaja yogis,

00:25:15.428 --> 00:25:19.949
and they – I told somebody that “You’d better compile them.”

00:25:20.206 --> 00:25:27.465
So he said, “Within one month all those letters have come up to my head.”
In one month!

00:25:27.581 --> 00:25:30.700
I said, “Forget it, don’t write.”

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:36.527
It’s not one or two; from all over the world people are writing.

00:25:37.327 --> 00:25:44.327
But those who are intellectuals are very difficult.

00:25:45.267 --> 00:25:51.405
It’s impossible to put this into their heads.

00:25:51.822 --> 00:25:56.544
So whatever is possible, we have to do our maximum,

00:25:56.775 --> 00:26:00.140
put our attention to people who want it.

00:26:00.263 --> 00:26:09.163
Now in India it has gone to into jails,
it has gone into schools and everywhere.

00:26:09.322 --> 00:26:13.888
And somebody told Me the other day that even in a Catholic church

00:26:14.026 --> 00:26:17.202
they have started taking to Sahaja Yoga;

00:26:17.385 --> 00:26:22.434
I don’t know what’s wrong in their heads and how they have managed.

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:29.547
But that’s how Sahaja Yoga is spreading. But it has to spread much more.

00:26:29.768 --> 00:26:35.606
You have to, all of you individually should go round and work it out,

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:40.627
and talk about it. But Sahaja yogis are little shy.

00:26:41.902 --> 00:26:48.798
Once I was going by plane, and one lady was very, very hot.

00:26:49.114 --> 00:26:54.739
So I asked her what guru she follows, she told Me the name.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:27:01.075
I was surprised that she didn’t know anything about spirituality.

00:27:01.868 --> 00:27:08.868
And these people have huge houses and big temples, everything,

00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:15.498
and she was telling Me the praise of her guru.
I thought, “She is very shameless.

00:27:15.583 --> 00:27:21.878
She hasn’t got anything in her, she’s so very hot,
and she’s talking about it.”

00:27:22.117 --> 00:27:27.552
But Sahaja yogis won’t. I was surprised,
why Sahaja yogis don’t talk about it?

00:27:28.114 --> 00:27:33.008
But the other day I had gone with somebody in the market

00:27:33.488 --> 00:27:36.847
and I had a Sahaja yogi with him, and I was surprised,

00:27:36.949 --> 00:27:43.424
he started telling them about Me, and he started giving them realization.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:49.901
And they were very happy about it. Everywhere you go you have neighbors,

00:27:50.044 --> 00:27:57.044
you go to markets, everywhere you should go and talk about it.

00:27:58.395 --> 00:28:03.865
Like they sing these carols – we should also have bhajans and things

00:28:04.004 --> 00:28:07.895
to tell other people, we have to tell them.

00:28:08.046 --> 00:28:14.354
Why are you so shy? This shyness is not going to help Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:15.483 --> 00:28:20.567
So please see that you try to give realizations to others.

00:28:20.693 --> 00:28:26.112
You have powers; have faith in yourself.
I think they lack in faith

00:28:26.398 --> 00:28:31.879
or whatever it is, there are very few people who come out and do it.

00:28:32.188 --> 00:28:38.349
Italy I have seen, and also Austria, Australia;

00:28:38.468 --> 00:28:44.362
Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot because of their conviction

00:28:44.685 --> 00:28:50.631
that we have to give others what we have. We have to share it.

00:28:50.885 --> 00:28:57.360
From the life of Christ one has to understand His sacrifice.

00:28:58.348 --> 00:29:06.295
It’s such a lot of sacrifice – to be crucified like that, with the thieves.

00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:12.369
But He did it. In the same way when you all people

00:29:12.528 --> 00:29:19.583
want to do Sahaja Yoga work, you shouldn’t think, “What will happen to my grandfather,

00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:27.139
what will happen to my grandmother?” I mean, whatever letters I get are all about this.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:32.079
It’s very funny. They are only worried about some relations,

00:29:32.189 --> 00:29:36.148
they are not worried about the relations all over the world even.

00:29:36.283 --> 00:29:41.841
Worried about the wife or children: I get only letters like this.

00:29:42.061 --> 00:29:46.391
Nobody writes to Me that you have given realizations to so many.

00:29:46.557 --> 00:29:57.121
They never write how they have been able to achieve
spreading of Sahaja Yoga. o one writes – very surprising.

00:29:57.411 --> 00:30:00.210
You have to tell Me.

00:30:00.322 --> 00:30:08.399
I hope you all people understand the importance of spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:08.736 --> 00:30:13.737
If you don’t do that, you are absolutely useless.

00:30:13.944 --> 00:30:18.963
The greatest thing for Me, as you have so many lights here,

00:30:19.066 --> 00:30:23.746
we should have many more Sahaja yogis all over the world.

00:30:23.886 --> 00:30:29.831
If you want to change this world and if you want to avoid all the

00:30:29.967 --> 00:30:37.568
trials and tribulations of the useless life they are leading,
you have to save them.

00:30:37.743 --> 00:30:42.312
You have to salvage them. That’s your job,

00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:49.424
that’s what you have to pay for Sahaja Yoga –
not for yourself, not for yourself.

00:30:49.734 --> 00:30:58.366
Don’t get worried about yourself. If you read the letters I get, you’ll get disgusted.

00:31:11.231 --> 00:31:21.292
Now, some other kind of letters I get, that they want to marry – all right.

00:31:21.757 --> 00:31:28.420
There are many girls who claim that
“We have been applying for four years, we couldn’t get married.”

00:31:28.696 --> 00:31:34.377
Firstly you must know, out of proportion women are there.
They are very good.

00:31:34.567 --> 00:31:36.813
Say, if there are forty boys,

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:42.746
there would be at least a hundred-and-twenty,
or maybe even a hundred -and-fifty girls.

00:31:42.953 --> 00:31:48.079
So now, whom should we marry those girls? Just think of it.

00:31:48.317 --> 00:31:53.675
But they write letters of complaint that
“We have applied four times.”

00:31:53.928 --> 00:31:59.790
We can’t, we can’t help it.
So you go outside, marry anywhere you feel like.

00:31:59.912 --> 00:32:05.560
Or else you wait and see, and dedicate your life to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:05.704 --> 00:32:10.018
It’s a very difficult thing when they go on complaining

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:15.466
that “I should be married, and I haven’t got married as yet.”

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.058
Marriage was never our idea.

00:32:19.185 --> 00:32:22.897
But then we had to allow marriages.

00:32:23.076 --> 00:32:27.338
And now it has become the main issue with everyone.

00:32:27.569 --> 00:32:34.503
Either they are not married;
if they are married, they are not happy;

00:32:34.844 --> 00:32:38.721
if they are divorced, they must be married again.

00:32:38.944 --> 00:32:44.508
All sorts of things and complications, for which I am not prepared.

00:32:44.683 --> 00:32:47.401
Sahaja Yoga is not for that.

00:32:47.766 --> 00:32:53.285
If your marriage is not successful, it’s not My job.

00:32:53.436 --> 00:32:58.743
And if goes on, we’ll have to stop marriages.

00:33:00.885 --> 00:33:04.060
I don’t want you to write all these things to Me.

00:33:04.188 --> 00:33:10.354
It shows how poor you are in Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:11.217 --> 00:33:16.938
Why not write to Me how many people you have given realization?

00:33:17.323 --> 00:33:21.214
That will make Me happy;

00:33:21.635 --> 00:33:28.222
instead of complaining about your wife and – that’s not My concern.

00:33:29.182 --> 00:33:34.989
And as it came, we have married you; if you cannot carry on, it’s your duty.

00:33:37.073 --> 00:33:44.113
And this is what is the snag of Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:44.566 --> 00:33:52.055
In every religious movement there have been so many wrong things,

00:33:52.452 --> 00:33:59.563
while in Sahaja Yoga I think marriages is a very big hurdle.

00:33:59.865 --> 00:34:05.833
Moreover, boys don’t come;
because in India, very easy to marry boys,

00:34:05.999 --> 00:34:13.784
you can also get money, this, that.
But girls, there are five times more than the boys.

00:34:14.078 --> 00:34:20.003
Boys don’t want to marry. They’ll have their own marriages,
though they are Sahaja yogis.

00:34:21.182 --> 00:34:28.469
So I can’t understand why, in Sahaja Yoga also after coming to realization,

00:34:29.071 --> 00:34:33.857
to them marriage is a very important issue.

00:34:34.056 --> 00:34:41.056
What is most important is that how many people you give realization.

00:34:42.672 --> 00:34:45.722
That is your life.

00:34:47.183 --> 00:34:53.327
If a lotus is there it will open, but it must give fragrance.

00:34:53.592 --> 00:34:58.460
Even the lotus has a responsibility.

00:34:58.846 --> 00:35:05.149
Then what about you people? I’m not saying you get crucified like Christ – no.

00:35:05.385 --> 00:35:13.467
I said you enjoy your life, you have peace and stability, balance.

00:35:13.634 --> 00:35:20.848
But at the same time you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:21.205 --> 00:35:27.315
This is what is your job now. Your job is not important;

00:35:27.783 --> 00:35:33.489
only this is important, how many people you give realization.

00:35:33.735 --> 00:35:39.480
It’s very, very difficult, because they have made

00:35:39.694 --> 00:35:47.479
a mess of all the great incarnations, all those great Sufis and saints.

00:35:47.598 --> 00:35:51.716
But at least you people don’t do that.

00:35:51.824 --> 00:35:59.517
So please try to think whom can you give realization,
to whom you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:00.014 --> 00:36:02.005
You have to spread out.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:08.012
And next time I hope, I hear from you how
many people you have given realization.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:16.286
That is the greatest justification for the crucifixion of Christ,

00:36:16.788 --> 00:36:21.152
for His birth, for His coming on this earth, His Agnya.

00:36:21.422 --> 00:36:25.305
And if you have given realization, they have crossed the Agnya,

00:36:25.657 --> 00:36:31.435
they have gone beyond, and they are in Sahasrara.

00:36:32.098 --> 00:36:37.948
So in Sahaja Yoga you understand everything. It’s very easy to understand.

00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:44.078
Sahaja Yoga is the simplest thing to understand – but after realization.

00:36:44.245 --> 00:36:51.895
So you have to go round and see
how many people you can give realization.

00:36:53.307 --> 00:37:01.438
Everything is all right, all your worshipping is all right,
your puja is all right;

00:37:01.859 --> 00:37:09.374
but what is most important is
how many people you have given realization.

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:14.618
I would like to know how many people have given.

00:37:15.693 --> 00:37:22.134
And specially with ladies. Ladies are rather weak in giving realization.

00:37:22.269 --> 00:37:26.498
They can do a lot, I know, they can.

00:37:26.673 --> 00:37:34.404
After all, I am also a woman. But somehow I find the ladies in Sahaja Yoga

00:37:34.962 --> 00:37:41.870
are not of a level. They can do a lot, a lot,

00:37:42.038 --> 00:37:47.227
but somehow they don’t understand the importance of their life.

00:37:47.457 --> 00:37:50.655
You are very important.

00:37:51.267 --> 00:37:55.585
How many people there are who have got realizations?

00:37:56.133 --> 00:38:04.567
There were so many Sufis who got realization, they write poetry – finished.

00:38:05.305 --> 00:38:11.241
There were so many saints who did so much, wrote so many things.

00:38:12.873 --> 00:38:19.783
In India we had so many saints; they wrote all these things, people will read them,

00:38:20.142 --> 00:38:27.951
but nothing happens. You have, you have the art of giving realization.

00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:32.004
You know about kundalini, you know all about it.

00:38:32.123 --> 00:38:36.016
Go ahead and talk to people.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:44.911
I was alone when I started Sahaja Yoga, and I am a woman.

00:38:45.092 --> 00:38:50.112
So what about you? There’s a now challenge for all of you.

00:38:50.326 --> 00:38:53.178
How many people have you made Sahaja yogis?

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:59.588
Even in your family people are not Sahaja yogis,
your daughter is not, your son is not.

00:38:59.886 --> 00:39:05.420
So what’s the use of singing glory to Christ?

00:39:05.949 --> 00:39:13.517
If you are singing glory to Him,
you must make people cross their Agnya.

00:39:14.525 --> 00:39:20.110
He’s so highly placed within us, but you have never respected Him,

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:27.671
that such a highly placed personality you have crossed over,
so why not others?

00:39:29.676 --> 00:39:35.572
Let us see from today’s Puja

00:39:35.826 --> 00:39:40.096
how much determination you have.

00:39:40.696 --> 00:39:48.521
You should know that a Goddess doesn’t come with your own demands,

00:39:48.708 --> 00:39:54.041
She comes on Her own. She has Her own timing.

00:39:54.257 --> 00:39:59.740
But if you are people in majority

00:39:59.923 --> 00:40:06.896
who have really become saints and making others saintly, then I am for you.

00:40:07.062 --> 00:40:09.433
Otherwise I am available to you:

00:40:09.584 --> 00:40:13.658
you can have My vibrations, you can have My pujas,

00:40:13.867 --> 00:40:16.972
all these things are permitted, no doubt.

00:40:17.092 --> 00:40:24.755
But for that you are only capable,

00:40:24.937 --> 00:40:30.461
you are only entitled for that if you are doing Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:30.581 --> 00:40:35.728
if you are spreading Sahaja Yoga,
if you are giving to others;

00:40:36.211 --> 00:40:42.203
then only you will be considered really

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:48.792
capable of receiving the vibrations of the Goddess.

00:40:50.638 --> 00:40:54.957
In some countries if it is so much powerful,

00:40:55.085 --> 00:40:59.542
why not with your country, with your neighborhood,

00:40:59.762 --> 00:41:04.902
with your friends, with your relations is possible?

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.221
So tonight you have to decide

00:41:10.359 --> 00:41:16.741
that you are going to dedicate yourself in giving it to others –

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:22.095
it’s very joy-giving – and talking about Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.801
May God bless you.
