00:03:06.523 --> 00:03:18.595
Today we all Sahaja Yogis are standing
on the brink of the ocean,

00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:24.157
ocean of humanity,

00:03:26.154 --> 00:03:34.636
where we have to face the problems
of human beings.

00:03:34.837 --> 00:03:40.976
Otherwise, in the nature there are no
problems, they are all already solved.

00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:46.731
So one has to understand that

00:03:46.932 --> 00:03:57.649
it’s not just a movement of few people,
chosen people,

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.202
just to achieve Self-realisation,

00:04:03.402 --> 00:04:08.772
but it’s a big revolution

00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:16.261
which has to bring forth the beauties
of human beings,

00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:25.453
the glories of human beings, the proof
of divinity,

00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:32.010
of divine power and of God Almighty.

00:04:32.864 --> 00:04:37.595
We have to now face that multitude
of people

00:04:37.796 --> 00:04:41.981
who are absolutely ignorant compared
to you,

00:04:42.182 --> 00:04:45.849
who have not known the knowledge of God,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:55.601
who are either lost into the darkness
of ignorance

00:04:55.802 --> 00:05:02.618
or are burning in the fire of ego.

00:05:06.381 --> 00:05:11.379
We have to transform this world into
a new world,

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:19.554
a beautiful world which you all are
enjoying,

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:27.530
to establish it, to be established on this
earth,

00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:31.665
for which we have to prepare ourselves.

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:35.490
So far Sahaj Yoga means blessings;

00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:40.986
if somebody is less blessed they ask Me
questions, “How is it, Mother,

00:05:41.187 --> 00:05:44.334
we haven’t got this when we are praying
to You?

00:05:44.535 --> 00:05:46.715
Why did it not work out?

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:50.641
It should have happened, after all we
are worshipping You,

00:05:50.842 --> 00:05:56.843
so how is it that my son did not get
the job?”

00:06:00.134 --> 00:06:04.333
So, I mean, as if it’s sort of a, some
debts have to be paid

00:06:04.534 --> 00:06:08.108
to all the Sahaja Yogis by Sahaj Yoga.

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:15.053
That sort of an attitude has been, so far,
towards Sahaj Yog.

00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:20.440
Of, not all of you, I must say,

00:06:21.078 --> 00:06:28.995
but in the minds there’s lurking always,
a desire to know

00:06:29.196 --> 00:06:34.982
why, when we are Sahaj Yogis, why should
it happen to us.

00:06:35.183 --> 00:06:39.155
You’ve seen that God has blessed you.

00:06:39.343 --> 00:06:45.342
Some people had very miserable married
life,

00:06:45.508 --> 00:06:50.693
they couldn’t understand why they had
to have a miserable married life.

00:06:50.893 --> 00:06:55.578
Some had some misfortunes

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:02.344
and some had some diseases also after
coming to Sahaj Yoga.

00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:07.749
So there has to be understanding that
Sahaj Yoga is

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:15.304
for correcting your life, for putting you
on solid basis,

00:07:15.481 --> 00:07:20.889
on proper foundations to make you
great people.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:26.081
As if it gets you immuned to all these
mishappenings,

00:07:26.274 --> 00:07:31.554
with blessings of course, so you don’t feel
the effects

00:07:31.778 --> 00:07:37.484
of those misfortunes so much as you would
normally feel.

00:07:37.685 --> 00:07:43.748
This creates beautiful human beings out
of you.

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:47.872
Some people have hankering after money;

00:07:48.073 --> 00:07:52.036
some people think they can make money
by coming to Sahaj Yoga;

00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:58.063
some people think they will become leaders
or some think they will have fame,

00:07:58.264 --> 00:08:05.586
some think that they will achieve a kind
of a very dominant position;

00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:10.292
and some think that they can befool Me
also.

00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:19.962
It’s high time we realise that Sahaj Yoga
is not for this.

00:08:20.163 --> 00:08:23.945
Sahaj Yoga is for making you the wisest
person,

00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:31.442
the sanest person, the most generous and
the most confident person in the world,

00:08:31.642 --> 00:08:34.453
because you have to fight,

00:08:34.654 --> 00:08:38.971
you have to fight the dark ignorance
of Kali Yuga,

00:08:39.156 --> 00:08:46.605
of ages which is precipitated and today
we see all the bad effects of it.

00:08:47.445 --> 00:08:50.924
Whatever you may call it, you may call it
the fanaticism,

00:08:51.134 --> 00:08:56.542
you may call it the atheism, any isms
of any kinds,

00:08:56.743 --> 00:09:04.301
and all these human projections which
have created

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:08.540
all those artificial webs have to be
broken.

00:09:08.775 --> 00:09:17.096
But human beings, on the whole, believe
that these artificial webs are real.

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:19.926
So to break that,

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:24.981
you have to be also be careful that you
don’t break the human beings.

00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:28.343
While you are breaking their false faiths,

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:34.461
you have to remember that those people
who are carrying those false faiths

00:09:34.662 --> 00:09:40.120
are the ones who have to achieve
Self-realisation.

00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:46.339
It’s a very delicate work, it’s a very hard
work, it’s a very harsh work

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.825
but it is the most detached work.

00:09:51.026 --> 00:09:55.274
And when we realise that we are
so important,

00:09:55.475 --> 00:10:00.797
that God has blessed us with this peace,

00:10:00.998 --> 00:10:05.750
with this understanding, with these
powers -

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.910
it’s not only for our own gain,

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:16.700
because God is not only for you, He is
for the whole world.

00:10:16.901 --> 00:10:20.082
So we have to utilise them, we have
to spread them,

00:10:20.283 --> 00:10:25.582
work it out at every level; we have
to become dynamic about it.

00:10:25.783 --> 00:10:28.135
But the most important thing is
the responsibility

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:32.217
of Sahaj Yoga we have to take.

00:10:32.685 --> 00:10:38.094
We are Sahaj Yogis and we are responsible
for Sahaj Yoga.

00:10:38.295 --> 00:10:41.163
What have we done for Sahaj Yoga?

00:10:41.363 --> 00:10:44.466
We looked after our family, our children,
our jobs,

00:10:44.667 --> 00:10:51.554
our this, our that, motorcars, our horses,
our dogs, our cats.

00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:56.663
But who is responsible for Sahaj Yoga?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.652
When it comes to that point, we are
responsible

00:11:01.843 --> 00:11:06.944
of Sahaj Yoga, then it works out.

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:50.433
But there is a deliberate action also
of the negative forces.

00:11:50.634 --> 00:11:56.176
And this negativity is acting through
ignorant people who believe,

00:11:56.376 --> 00:11:58.953
who believe that they are right.

00:11:59.153 --> 00:12:03.407
They don’t know what is waiting for their
destruction there.

00:12:03.607 --> 00:12:10.074
Specially among our young people
you’ll find

00:12:10.274 --> 00:12:16.624
they just join any party, join any club,

00:12:16.825 --> 00:12:20.842
join any methods, any trend, anything,

00:12:21.043 --> 00:12:30.823
just because they have no understanding
as to what they have to be.

00:12:31.916 --> 00:12:35.527
They have to be the Spirit.

00:12:35.727 --> 00:12:40.635
I asked the other day a president of
a young organisation,

00:12:40.835 --> 00:12:44.776
“What is your policy?” He said,
“We have no policy.”

00:12:44.977 --> 00:12:48.453
They started looking here and there, [and]
said, “We have no policy.”

00:12:48.654 --> 00:12:53.170
I was amazed that they have no policy.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.638
“No, whatever our leaders say, we do it.”

00:12:57.838 --> 00:13:02.587
So to get people out of this kind
of slavery

00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:07.990
that they have no brains of their own,
they can’t use their own understanding,

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.329
they have to become the Spirit.

00:13:12.668 --> 00:13:18.318
Shivaji who was a great Atma Sakshatkari,
a realised soul,

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:20.936
for the future he has given the message.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:30.416
He said, “Svadharma jagwawa,” means
enlighten your dharma of Spirit.

00:13:30.617 --> 00:13:37.521
“Svadharma,” the Spirit has to be
enlightened.

00:13:38.553 --> 00:13:42.448
Everybody has said that. I’m specially
quoting him

00:13:42.648 --> 00:13:48.301
because he comes from Maharashtra; apart
from that he was a political head.

00:13:48.502 --> 00:13:52.986
Though he was a political head but because
he was a realised soul,

00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:58.186
he said that your Spirit should be
awakened.

00:13:58.386 --> 00:14:02.252
He didn’t talk of all other nonsensical
things.

00:14:02.453 --> 00:14:06.367
And he knew that unless and until
the Spirit is awakened,

00:14:06.568 --> 00:14:11.372
people will be doing all kinds of wrong
things.

00:14:11.573 --> 00:14:14.847
And that is why today we find all over
the world

00:14:15.047 --> 00:14:17.685
the mess in which all political parties,

00:14:17.885 --> 00:14:24.707
all economic endeavours, all military
endeavours have fallen into.

00:14:25.286 --> 00:14:33.894
So, it is for us to take over and to show
them what is an integrated life,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:41.135
and what is the strength of a human being.

00:14:41.336 --> 00:14:45.060
Because this Shakti is within everyone.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:49.894
Just praying to Shakti, just talking about
Shakti, it doesn’t act.

00:14:50.095 --> 00:14:59.172
But this divine Shakti has to act, and
act through you people.

00:15:00.045 --> 00:15:02.789
Just try to realise

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:10.105
that within these few years how much
knowledge you have got,

00:15:11.798 --> 00:15:16.499
how much you know, how deeply you know.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.528
You are not just passing slogans
or talking, you know -

00:15:19.729 --> 00:15:24.243
but you know it, you know
what it is.

00:15:24.408 --> 00:15:27.931
I don’t think I have attended to each
one of you individually,

00:15:28.132 --> 00:15:31.086
but through your Spirit only you have
come to know

00:15:31.287 --> 00:15:34.811
all the knowledge about yourself and
knowledge about others.

00:15:35.012 --> 00:15:40.038
You didn’t have to go to any library, you
didn’t have to go to any university.

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:42.323
All the saints never went,

00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:46.546
none of the saints went to any university
or read any books,

00:15:46.747 --> 00:15:51.127
but how knowledgeable they were, because
they were the Spirit.

00:15:51.328 --> 00:15:55.479
So the first and foremost responsibility
of a Sahaj Yogi

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.928
on this day is to be the Spirit, on the day
when we are celebrating

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:06.236
the birthday of Christ, who was the Spirit.

00:16:07.698 --> 00:16:11.398
So, this is our greatest responsibility
first to see that,

00:16:11.599 --> 00:16:19.280
“Are we the Spirit, or we are this body,
this mind, this ego? What are we?”

00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:24.690
If you have achieved that state,

00:16:25.452 --> 00:16:29.558
if you have achieved that state,

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:33.274
then you are, as they call in Marathi,
samarthya,

00:16:33.475 --> 00:16:43.520
means, you are equal to your name;
that you are the Spirit.

00:16:44.594 --> 00:16:47.901
If you cannot achieve that,

00:16:48.102 --> 00:16:51.808
then you are a half-baked Sahaj Yogi,
not yet done.

00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:56.874
As you know, we have no organisations,
no memberships, nothing.

00:16:57.075 --> 00:17:05.680
But we have one thing, that we know
we are realised souls,

00:17:06.172 --> 00:17:13.303
that we know more than all others know,
and that we are not proud of it.

00:17:13.504 --> 00:17:17.036
We are very humble people.

00:17:17.201 --> 00:17:24.072
But this humility should not become
a stagnation or a lethargy within us that,

00:17:24.273 --> 00:17:31.706
“Now we are realised souls, let us sit
on a tree and have our blessings.”

00:17:35.574 --> 00:17:39.368
You have to get to the roots

00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:43.544
and you all have to work it out
on your level.

00:17:43.745 --> 00:17:47.249
But first get rid of your own personal
problems,

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.505
all petty things that you have.

00:17:52.687 --> 00:17:55.455
When we talk of sacrifice, as you know,

00:17:55.656 --> 00:18:01.294
in Sahaj Yoga I have not known what
sacrifice people have done.

00:18:01.495 --> 00:18:05.689
You have to sacrifice your ego,

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:10.324
which is a headache to you and to Me.

00:18:10.524 --> 00:18:13.031
And you have to sacrifice your
conditioning,

00:18:13.232 --> 00:18:18.288
only two things, left and right.

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:23.220
And that can be achieved and many
have achieved [it],

00:18:23.421 --> 00:18:30.696
but now put that detached personality
to a test.

00:18:30.897 --> 00:18:36.387
And then, once you are sure that you
are detached,

00:18:36.652 --> 00:18:41.515
then employ your energy in doing

00:18:41.716 --> 00:18:51.579
constructive improvement of this whole
world.

00:18:51.928 --> 00:18:57.035
It will work out for poverty, it will
work out for politics,

00:18:57.236 --> 00:19:06.203
it will work out for economics, it will
work out for every field of life.

00:19:07.054 --> 00:19:13.010
Sahaj Yoga is the only solution because
in this human beings are transformed.

00:19:13.211 --> 00:19:20.380
It’s not like this, that one person changes
the address

00:19:20.602 --> 00:19:26.607
or the badge that he is wearing, and he
becomes something else.

00:19:26.808 --> 00:19:32.302
Or from church to temple and temple
to church.

00:19:32.532 --> 00:19:38.373
It’s something within that transforms you,
makes you knowledgeable.

00:19:38.588 --> 00:19:44.378
So you are already Sat Chit Ananda; because
you know the truth,

00:19:44.579 --> 00:19:52.579
you are in joy and your attention
is enlightened.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:20:01.198
With all this that you have, what are we
to do now?

00:20:03.098 --> 00:20:07.140
If you enlighten the light, it
automatically knows

00:20:07.341 --> 00:20:11.411
that it has to give the light.

00:20:13.603 --> 00:20:18.901
In the same way, all the Sahaj Yogis
have to take the responsibility

00:20:19.102 --> 00:20:24.526
for this great war we have started.

00:20:24.727 --> 00:20:35.783
It’s not the war with swords or with
atomic energies,

00:20:36.108 --> 00:20:40.443
because they are all destructive.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.252
This is the war against all the destructive
powers

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:49.534
through the power of love which is
constructive,

00:20:49.735 --> 00:20:54.085
which constructs human beings, which
constructs societies,

00:20:54.286 --> 00:21:00.465
which constructs countries and the whole
world.

00:21:03.933 --> 00:21:08.649
That is your own

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:15.385
and also this decision has to be your own.

00:21:15.586 --> 00:21:19.828
Even if I give big lectures and say things,

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:24.136
it may not have any effect whatsoever
on you.

00:21:24.337 --> 00:21:26.970
It might be just wasted,

00:21:27.171 --> 00:21:33.693
if you haven’t got the capacity to imbibe
what I am saying,

00:21:33.894 --> 00:21:41.212
so important, so imminent.

00:21:41.427 --> 00:21:43.758
Now give up all the worries you have about

00:21:43.959 --> 00:21:47.107
your small, small, little, little things
of your family,

00:21:47.308 --> 00:21:50.481
of your work, your factories,

00:21:50.682 --> 00:21:56.883
of your business, of your official
positions

00:21:57.084 --> 00:22:04.497
and just know that everything has to go
through Sahaj Yoga.

00:22:05.713 --> 00:22:12.415
Even the cooking I do, I do it through
Sahaj.

00:22:12.616 --> 00:22:17.888
If the fire is not working, just put your
hands to the fire, it becomes all right.

00:22:18.089 --> 00:22:23.997
If the rice is not cooking, put your hands
to the rice, it cooks.

00:22:24.198 --> 00:22:28.852
Anything going wrong anywhere, you can
use your vibrations.

00:22:29.053 --> 00:22:36.792
But I don’t know what to use to make you
feel responsible for Sahaj Yoga,

00:22:36.993 --> 00:22:41.080
that now we’ve got such a great thing
with us

00:22:41.281 --> 00:22:45.156
and what are we going to do about it.
