1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:08,750
Because many people have written about it
(inaudible) and a lot of people have been thinking that

2
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:17,662
something should be done in this matter
of finding the truth. (Unclear)

3
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:36,680
Now when human (inaudible) his condition would be such
that he only believes this thing (inaudible)
and he has no other means.

4
00:00:37,206 --> 00:00:44,936
Whatever have been the achievements of Science, we have
seen only through the medium of intellect.

5
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:56,462
But the intelligence that is, tells us only about what
is visible in the world. It tells us nothing about what
is invisible or can’t be seen.

6
00:00:56,525 --> 00:01:00,155
And can’t even tell what is the difference
between the Truth and invisible.

7
00:01:01,657 --> 00:01:10,797
Then it should be thought first that when a person
talks of the search for Truth then first of all
he has to consider

8
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:17,408
that whatever we have known through the intellect, have
known nothing, even then we remained in illusion.

9
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:24,171
What we have known through our intelligence,
whatever we have known till now, that much has happened,

10
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:30,917
we have known from what is visible (UNCLEAR) but
have not known what is in the invisible or hidden.

11
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:37,226
And could not even know that what we have to know from
what is visible whether it is the Absolute Truth or not.

12
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:47,133
Now when the achievement of Science is ours, then Science
is on our heads, we have known a lot through Science.

13
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:58,989
We have reached up to the atom and molecule.
The activities that we have understood are also
of all that is gross or non-living.

14
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:06,228
..... How it happens with everyone in the world,
no one has any attention towards it.

15
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:17,232
The first thing to be thought about in the search
for Truth, that whatever man can do,
is there any creation beyond that or not?

16
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:27,235
For example, as we watch any living thing - a human-being
walking, strolling, growing, becoming anxious, see everything,

17
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:37,790
but we don't look this way, we don’t visualize/pay
attention to the fact, why is this man made - first thing,

18
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:48,894
because we don't have an answer to it. The speciality
of man is that he turns his face away from the fact
to which he does not have an answer.

19
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:58,269
And says that, he would like to stay at the point
to which he has an answer. He thinks that it
would be wrong to go beyond that point.

20
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:07,946
But man came into the world, Science told us
that man has been created/made from an amoeba.

21
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:18,994
Then it should immediately come to our minds
that such special events that have happened,

22
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:26,256
and because of which they are all inferior to us,
these are inert/inanimate things, we can make them.

23
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:33,197
Man's vision reaches there, that okay
we're making it, so we made it and we
have become a very great person

24
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:41,525
or we have done a very great work. But even a stone
cannot be made by man, not even an atom or
molecule of it.

25
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:47,262
Only if man could think with a little humility that,
"Can I make this stone myself?

26
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:56,656
Of all the elements, can I make even a single element myself?

27
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:04,633
It’s valances etc. are made so beautifully
can I create something like this?"

28
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:14,620
It's okay, that you’ve assembled a dead thing.
But in it’s creation can you have any

29
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:22,858
intervention – you cannot have.
You can't change anything about/in it.

30
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:30,231
As it is, so shall it remain. You can make it’s
compounds, can make mixtures from it.

31
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:39,428
But if sulphur is burnt and if we make crystals from it,
they will be made in the same way as they are made of sulphur.

32
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:45,229
Now if you want to create your own style of
crystals, you cannot create even that.

33
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:52,886
You can not interfere in it’s properties.
Yes, you can use those properties

34
00:04:52,886 --> 00:05:01,676
but you cannot change their basic fundamental properties.

35
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:13,726
So who has made this and in whose power is it that He
can change it? Here also one should have a point of view.

36
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:19,883
Living in the dark, if you say that there is
no light, then this would be wrong.

37
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:27,058
But if someone says that there is light, then,
be it any scientist, any intellectual man,

38
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:32,978
he should say that if there is light we should
see it. There must be curiosity or inquisitiveness.

39
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:41,169
There should be curiosity in the mind of man that, after all
if he is saying that there is some light beyond it,
so why not have a look?

40
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:48,491
But the way we are influenced by ourselves,
there's so much autohypnosis,

41
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:55,451
that we think that whatever we can work out
only that is true and what we cannot work out,
there’s no need to look there.

42
00:05:57,271 --> 00:06:06,181
Thus you can understand how far away we are from Truth,
that we haven’t even touched it’s basic facts.

43
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:14,951
The first question is that the One who created the universe
that is created, and Who has made such a beautiful arrangement
in all the molecules, particles and atoms of this universe,

44
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:22,460
Who has made it so systematically,
Who is this administrator?

45
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:32,269
One thing can be said that people are honest,
that say, ‘We can't go any further than this,
so we’ll stay here.’

46
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:39,018
But if we say, you can grow,
you can go further than this,

47
00:06:39,018 --> 00:06:48,801
and beyond this there is another area, another
dimension, so why not open your eyes to all this?

48
00:06:51,792 --> 00:07:02,972
We have only an ego that, "We have done this,
we have found this out, we have this, that,
but whatever it is, it is inferior to you.

49
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:10,645
If you want to rise above, anywhere, you
have to hold on to something above.

50
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:22,725
Wherever one has to climb - you must have seen that when people
climb a big hill, then they hammer a nail up there first
and then hold it.

51
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:28,476
This is what you call hypothesis etc. in
Science where an assumption has to be made.

52
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:35,316
Nailed the nail of that concept, then holding
up that nail rose higher, and then went
forward to see what happens.

53
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:44,765
Whether the nail is actually nailed or not, whether
we have reached there or not, a person can only
see after reaching there in reality.

54
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:50,465
But by turning away completely, this work
is not going to happen.

55
00:07:52,456 --> 00:08:01,726
Now if we say that those who great saints and sages that
have been, the great Incarnations who have incarnated here
In India, in this land of yoga,

56
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:07,056
who have done great deeds, whom till this day
the world is worshipping and believing in,

57
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:13,196
these people didn't lie, so you would say,
"Yes, they used to lie, what is the proof of this?"

58
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:17,743
If you say so, then we can’t stop you.

59
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:24,283
Whether there is God or not, this too if it is
now a matter of debate, we can't stop you.

60
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:31,747
But if we say that we prove it to you,
then why not move in that direction.

61
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:40,397
If you are a worshipper of Truth and you
want to know the Truth, if someone says
that you can progress in it,

62
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:48,401
not only this but you can know that Truth completely,
then why don't we most humbly accept that,

63
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:52,965
"Okay, let's go and see, which is the path Mother is telling?
Let's see whether it is correct or not.”

64
00:08:53,215 --> 00:09:01,645
Accepted that this thing was not universal till now,
was not collective and very few people knew about it

65
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:08,564
That's why there were misunderstandings, but just
like there are things of Science electricity etc.,
as many as/whatever are discovered,

66
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:14,786
the way they are collective and global today
and are used for the common good,

67
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:21,536
when we want to get to something higher than this,
then the things we have used till date

68
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:26,308
to attain the things lower than us and
acquire them, not only this,

69
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:30,418
in order to have authority over them, we
have to give up the use of those things.

70
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:34,929
For example, if you want to move around in Delhi,
then car is fine but if you want to go/fly up,
you need an aeroplane.

71
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:42,740
It’s speed is also different, it’s modus operandi
or style is different, all it’s projects are different.

72
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:49,972
The motor-car is a different thing, it moves on the
ground and this is an air-plane flying in the sky.

73
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:55,710
Similarly, when I am saying to you,
that you have to know the Spirit,

74
00:09:55,788 --> 00:10:03,448
the Spirit has to be used, with the help of the
Spirit only you can know the Divine,

75
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:09,098
so it means that with the help of intelligence only
you understand the whole world, you have come to know,

76
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:12,915
then you will have to find something
beyond that - that is the Spirit.

77
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:18,969
If there is no mention of the Spirit in Science,
then only this can be said that

78
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:23,665
yet Science has not been able to move in that
direction, it'll never even come to know

79
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:32,398
because the limited area from which you want to know
it, it is beyond that, you won't be able to see it.

80
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:42,629
It’s range is not such that that you get to know
it. Thus the range of this machinery, has to be increased.

81
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,003
And while increasing that range if I say that,
until the light of the Spirit comes into it

82
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:55,250
till then the work won’t be done, you must
accept it so that we attain it.

83
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:01,750
As we see a person has a very good microscope

84
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:10,823
that lets him see how each muscle is and how
is the flow of blood in it, we see all this

85
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:18,183
but when we see that another person has a
good machine, even better than this one,
so we want somehow to get it.

86
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:24,712
Similarly, if a person sees that
the other person has got something special,

87
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:29,743
so he should have a desire to achieve that
special thing, but it does not happen.

88
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:38,836
This is not the case with the Spirit because man
only wants to know that, "What I am today,

89
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:44,436
I should get everything in it only. If I want to
rise further, means it’s a disrespect to myself only.”

90
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:54,415
In the case of Science, he doesn’t think so.
In the matter of Science, if America did
some research, he will rush there.

91
00:11:54,415 --> 00:12:01,178
Then does not think that, “We are Indians, why should we
run after them.” If Russia did something,
then he will run after them.

92
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:11,853
But if there’s some exploration in some other
area, then man is not interested in it.

93
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:20,713
Man knows all about the outside of the tree
but nothing is known about it’s roots.

94
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:30,584
And to know about it’s roots, you have to become subtle
and to achieve that subtlety, you need humility.

95
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:36,745
If you want that on the basis of your intellect
you achieve it, you can't.

96
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:43,797
One simple thing people don't understand
is whenever I give a speech etc., whatever/anything

97
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:48,904
then I see the first question is,
that it is written in such-and-such a book -

98
00:12:48,904 --> 00:12:55,914
(It's) done, then what to talk about? Okay, whatever is written
(that) is not going to be judged by your intelligence.

99
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:59,395
You won't be able to understand it. I’m saying
that you will not be able to understand.

100
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:05,653
Please understand, if we can't see without glasses
then it’s important for us to wear glasses - this point
we understand.

101
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:12,183
And, if except the Spirit we can’t know/understand God,
then you should get to the Spirit – this simple
fact why shouldn't you understand!

102
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:16,603
Will you be able to find the Truth by doubting it?

103
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:21,364
If in reality you are a worshipper of Truth and
you really want to know the Truth,

104
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:27,210
so first of all there should be humility that
till now we haven't found the Truth.

105
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:35,296
This is a great virtue – humility.

106
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:43,402
Man learns anything but can't learn humility.

107
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:55,381
What do you do in humility? Some people
get the idea that being humble means
you have bowed down/succumbed before someone.

108
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:05,821
This is a big misconception. Humility means
that you have opened yourself up to accept -

109
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:15,989
accept a new ideology, to accept something new,
seeing, testing, understanding, getting deep into it.

110
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:23,029
Humility never means that you bow down before someone.

111
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:29,310
No matter how high the branches of the tree
may rise, till its roots

112
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,498
reach the source after digging the ground,
no power of any kind can enter that tree.

113
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:43,514
In the same way no matter how much your civilization/
decency/politeness increases and no matter how much
this mess of Science increases,

114
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:54,605
but until you have found your Spirit, the whole of it,
will be destroyed, will be finished, just like a bubble.

115
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:03,691
None of this is going to survive and that’s
what has been happening all over the world.

116
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:08,971
I just met a lady who said that they had gone
for the disarmament of the armament,

117
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:15,263
‘We worked so hard, told the people that there
must be disarmament and everything would be fine
with disarmament and there were many disputes

118
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:21,053
and there we worked hard for four months and
no one listened and we were great failures.’

119
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:29,543
Tell me. This means that human-beings are
not left with any intellect.

120
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:39,699
There should be disarmament – even a simple person
can understand that what is the need of one human
going around killing other humans.

121
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:49,992
Except man no animal kills other animals taking arms.
It doesn't have the power even to hold it.

122
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:58,152
God has given us hands, so now we kill others by
taking guns. Is this a matter of great wisdom?

123
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:04,061
Science cannot treat this, can it?

124
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,399
If scientists can fill wisdom in people,
then I will think them to be great.

125
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:22,375
Intelligence or wisdom cannot come inside anyone, through
Science. If he wants to, he can make an atom bomb.

126
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:28,442
And if he wants he can make one or the other
good hospital but it is at his will.

127
00:16:30,712 --> 00:16:37,679
It is not a fixed thing, it is movable/transient. Today
he will build a big hospital, a huge one.

128
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:46,189
He will cure thousands of people there and later one day,
can all of a sudden destroy it by dropping a bomb on it.

129
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:51,169
You can't guarantee that.
Does Science guarantee it

130
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:55,949
that the man who is doing good work today because
of Science, will tomorrow not destroy it?

131
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:01,041
Can you give any guarantee of man
with Science?

132
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:17,548
When Science is so incomplete then we
should see why is it’s light so dim?

133
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:28,558
Why is it so, that in it’s light a person is
sometimes seen standing on the path and
sometimes falls into the ditch?

134
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:38,219
And as long as man is not capable or competent
enough, till the motivation or inspiration for Truth
is not strong enough in man,

135
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:46,406
till then, whether you do any social work of the world,
any political work or any work with your intellect,
there’s no stability for him.

136
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:59,796
Today you will be high up in the sky, tomorrow you
will drown in the river because Science doesn’t
make any human being capable enough and cannot make.

137
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:06,126
No man can ever be competent or capable
enough with ego. ‘sam’ ‘arth’

138
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:18,896
So must reach this result, what is called
the logical conclusion and think

139
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:25,406
that with the intellect alone we cannot find the Truth.

140
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:36,166
By intellect we can tell that a white sheet is spread
here, that it is a khadi sheet - just this,
what else? How far can we go?

141
00:18:41,226 --> 00:18:49,416
But can you tell from this khadi sheet,
whether it was worn by a saint or a demon?

142
00:18:56,378 --> 00:19:01,288
With Science you can't even tell whether
this person is a demon or he is a human being?

143
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:07,045
And can’t even say and don’t know whether the one
who looks like a human today, may tomorrow
become a ghost and sit on your head.

144
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,846
There is no surety of anything - everything
is mobile/unsustainable, unstable.

145
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:21,265
That's why nowadays in Kalyuga it is said that
man is completely in delusion, in confusion.

146
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:28,665
And in this tumult/uproar when man thinks that,
"Hey, now Kalyuga has come,

147
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:34,344
now what is Mataji talking about in this? Now
this is what happens in Kalyuga, this is Kalyuga."

148
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:38,584
It means that everything has become a guarantee. Now it
is Kalyuga, now in this, if you don’t do these things,

149
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:41,625
so how will it happen? This has to be done,
this Kali Yuga has come.

150
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:48,655
In this, if you do not move on this path, then no
work is going to be done. This is the way. It is Kaliyuga.

151
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:57,996
No matter how you keep turning your path in Kalyug,
whichever way you go, somehow you keep on moving
right-left, somehow you keep living.

152
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:07,128
Such a person lives on compromises because
the values which were stable, they finish off.

153
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:12,678
When man becomes delusional, his constant/stable
values definitely end.

154
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:20,227
When the war challenged and when the war broke out
in the European countries, when there was
great plight of the people,

155
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,920
so the values that were there, were greatly reduced,
were over, almost finished.

156
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:32,733
Because when everything started to waver/stagger,
then people could not understand that what
should they hold on to now.

157
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:36,465
If they hold on to this thing, it is wobbly
if they held on to that thing, it wobbled.

158
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:45,404
But then these thoughts should come to the mind of man,
that we may be we have not caught the thing
which is stable and immovable.

159
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:50,804
Such a thought must arise in the mind of every
intellectualist - this thought must arise in the mind.

160
00:20:50,804 --> 00:20:58,123
Son, sit here, it is very cold there, come here.
There is a lot of space here. It's cold outside,
don't sit outside. Come sit here, don't sit outside.

161
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:04,446
Come ahead and sit here. You people come forward.
I can't talk comfortably if everyone will sit outside.

162
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:09,986
Sit here, what’s the problem? Spread something on it -
this is a good thing. Don't sit outside.

163
00:21:30,605 --> 00:21:43,505
And seeing all this, the heart of man gets
filled with bitterness. His heart becomes very bitter
- he wonders where is the sweetness,

164
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:52,237
where is the love! If one has to live somehow
then what is home?

165
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:58,892
Some strangle themselves, some strangle others.

166
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,329
And in response thousands of people
will tell you thousands of things.

167
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:11,167
Some will say that the reason for this is social disorder,
some would say political disorder.

168
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:17,090
Some will say Communism is good, some will say
Capitalism is good, someone will say something good,
someone will say something else good.

169
00:22:19,146 --> 00:22:24,076
And people will also stick to it. Some will become
a Communist, someone will become a Capitalist,

170
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,825
some will become Democratic, some Socialist,
then someone will become poor,

171
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:32,475
somebody will become rich - means by forming some or
the other group will think that they can live as a group.

172
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:42,995
and struggle, complete struggle and this struggle
also, they don't know what they want.

173
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:53,586
There is a Dalit party, someone is a terrorist party
a number of parties have been changed.

174
00:22:55,133 --> 00:23:00,983
But among ourselves we are all human beings -
how did these parties come into being?

175
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:21,588
There is a huge mystery behind this.
And the secret is that we cannot see the
love of that Supreme Father.

176
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:29,601
We do not understand with how much love
He has created this Universe.

177
00:23:30,665 --> 00:23:41,245
You people can't make a tree out of a seed,
cannot make a fruit from a flower.

178
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:55,496
There is nothing you can do. Just think,
how much beauty God has given us

179
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,170
and how much He has done for us.

180
00:24:04,673 --> 00:24:13,703
This, man has forgotten, that the One who made us,
nurtured us - made a human-being from an amoeba,

181
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:23,199
there is no gratitude towards Him, there is no attention
there is no thought towards Him,

182
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:34,896
that's why incompleteness has come. And whatever was said
by those people, whatever was told to the other people, either
those who followed them, followed them wrongly.

183
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:42,706
They made groups out of them and some people said
that, “These are all useless things, there is no
meaning in them - everything is false.”

184
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:55,193
In such a situation when a person is completely disappointed
and desperate, and full of bitterness,

185
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:59,353
and in his sight there is no glimpse of the love of God.

186
00:24:59,353 --> 00:25:07,653
Look in front of Me now, little-little leaves are visible
through the fog - how beautiful everything is made.

187
00:25:07,653 --> 00:25:17,320
It’s joy is pouring within. And all this beauty
of creation has also disappeared from our eyes

188
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:27,133
and we are burdened with a heavy life,
then we do not understand, why is it so?

189
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:35,778
If God made us with His love, cherished us with
so much joy, He created this universe,

190
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:39,624
then after all, why did we get trapped
in such a big trouble?

191
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:50,892
The reason for this is that we ourselves
have got our necks cut/landed up in trouble.

192
00:25:53,944 --> 00:26:02,624
Having necks cut - in Sahaja Yoga, what we call as
Vishuddhi Chakra, which is the place of Virata -

193
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:08,652
having neck cut means that we have broken off
our relationship with the Virata.

194
00:26:08,715 --> 00:26:19,255
From that Primordial Being of which we are part and parcel,
which is known as God Almighty,
we have broken off our relationship with Him

195
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:27,086
and have gone astray in our own direction, and in our
own notions and ideas and in our own thoughts,

196
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:32,796
thinking that this is the only thing right, and
the rest everything that is there is wrong.

197
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:43,767
At this juncture only, today Sahaja Yoga
has come before you as a Maha Yoga.

198
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:55,080
You cannot know it by thinking about it, because
I already said that by thinking, you will find
only the thing that is lower than you.

199
00:26:55,284 --> 00:27:04,294
What is higher than you, is the stuff of your imagination.
In your imagination you can think that we are roaming
in the sky, anything, but that is not the reality.

200
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:15,922
That’s not real, it is not reality, it is not real.
It should be accepted that whatever we think,
that we are such and such,

201
00:27:15,922 --> 00:27:24,541
and this will happen, that will happen, is not real. Then this
must be understood that what we actually found,

202
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:30,310
found only that which is lower than ourselves, and if
we have to find something that is higher than
ourselves, something has to be there in reality.

203
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:39,948
And also what should there be in reality,
the Creator has thought about it.

204
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:50,430
Only He is the doer. He also has the idea/concept. The One
who gave you these eyes, nose, mouth, everything, this body,

205
00:27:50,494 --> 00:28:01,674
mind, intellect, ego, etc all things are given in you,
He will also give you that peg, upon reaching which
you can come to a higher state than this.

206
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:07,439
With this thought only He has made you a human-being.

207
00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:13,773
But first of all, the intellectual has to think
how far does this intellect reach?

208
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:20,930
What a limited thing it is, and when it comes to the
unlimited, it is not right to rub the intellect between.

209
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:33,997
After knowing this infinite, after recognizing it,
as Nanak Saheb has said 'after recognizing it'

210
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:46,260
then you can understand what are you,
why have you come into this world,

211
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:54,311
and what work does this living Power of the
All-pervading Lord do, and how does It do it?

212
00:28:54,311 --> 00:29:04,101
Not only this, when the realization of the Spirit within you
happens, then this Power flows from within you
and is manifested.

213
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:16,161
You must pay attention to this word. This Power doesn’t
speak, doesn’t think, it acts, is manifested.

214
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,060
To speak and to think, is the work of the intellect -
useless – no work is done by it.

215
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,958
Just as you sit in the car and start thinking about it
- will your car move?

216
00:29:29,722 --> 00:29:39,242
Something has to be done. But this Power is such that when
it starts flowing from within you, then it is manifested,

217
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:45,157
it works. As there is light, it is implemented.
When light is coming from it, then light is visible,

218
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:51,544
is working, is automatic. Despite doing nothing,
being light it is giving light.

219
00:29:53,594 --> 00:30:02,424
Similarly, such a person, while doing nothing,
can give light and is implemented.

220
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:12,395
This thing, I think, is said in/for the university because
because the meaning of university is Universal.

221
00:30:13,623 --> 00:30:19,833
But intelligence cannot be universal.
If it had been, it would have happened by now.

222
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:25,228
Everyone's intellect moves to the same place.
one does not match the other.

223
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:36,398
So in order to achieve this thing, first
of all, we must humbly admit

224
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:47,169
that whatever we have known so far is limited,
and in order to know the unlimited, some
happening must take place within us,

225
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:58,466
some sprouting must take place within us, because today
that we seem so limited, we may become vast like the sky
and cover everything.

226
00:31:00,531 --> 00:31:05,871
In many ways have the elders tried to explain
that the drop should be the ocean.

227
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:15,009
Now all similies that are there, also the analogies, are
also with the lower things. It’s a very big question

228
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:23,582
from where to get that also because they can’t
even talk of higher things and those who give
analogies will do with lower things.

229
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:28,059
And whatever lower things they will give,
will pull you further down.

230
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:33,982
As soon as is said that, 'You become an ocean from a drop,’
they will say, 'Sir, how can we become an ocean from a drop?'

231
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:45,110
No matter in whatever roundabout way it is explained,
it cannot be understood, because the one who wants
to understand, is a type of the intellect itself.

232
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:54,613
When understanding is possible only through the Spirit, then
you tell Me, what can be explained through the intellect.

233
00:31:56,949 --> 00:32:06,039
Like many foreign Sahaja Yogis have come here,
they don’t even know the basic notes of your music -

234
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:15,161
they know everything about their music. They don't know
anything about your musicology, don’t know
the names of your ragas

235
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:23,394
but if any pure Indian classical music is played,
no matter how difficult the melody, they get
engrossed in that.

236
00:32:25,202 --> 00:32:33,942
They don't search it’s melody, they don't talk about
it’s aalaapa, but its effect, its work,
develops within them.

237
00:32:36,193 --> 00:32:41,213
Otherwise, if our Indians sit to listen to it, then
first they will ask, "Who’s the one singing, sir?"

238
00:32:44,523 --> 00:32:53,966
Then, 'Which melody is this,' thought comes in between.
To which family does it belong, what is it’s lineage,
(which theka is being used),

239
00:32:54,084 --> 00:33:00,174
but the one who is not particular about this thing,
is just experiencing it with his Spirit,

240
00:33:00,174 --> 00:33:09,187
enjoying it, and the reason for which that melody was created,
that joy, is being absorbed by that person.

241
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:16,245
The joy with which it was made, that entire bliss,
is being absorbed in him and is manifesting.

242
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:31,530
All this joy can be experienced by you all
- it's our own. If you say, I will also accept this fact.

243
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:38,235
If you say, “Why only I’m doing this work?” then I’ll say,
you do it, it’s very good, you must certainly do it.

244
00:33:38,235 --> 00:33:42,278
Then I’m very happy that you people do it,
it’s very good - anyone may do it.

245
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:47,294
What can be better than this, that someone else should
do the work instead of Me, that's a very good thing.

246
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:52,413
But it is such, that perhaps I will have to do
this work, for a few days at least.

247
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,819
If you can do it, then you do.

248
00:33:57,388 --> 00:34:07,018
The work is complicated, it is the work of love.
And love is Truth and Truth is love.

249
00:34:09,905 --> 00:34:16,925
This is such a deep love, that in it man immediately
recognizes, what is the problem with others.

250
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:25,834
There is not the other, it is such an intense love
– everyone is part and parcel of our being.

251
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:30,568
When there is not the other, whom
are you going to oblige?

252
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:43,889
And when this love shines on anyone,
then the whole Truth of that person,
the complete is visible (in front).

253
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:55,033
The whole thing, the complete picture comes
to the fore. In that light you come to know,

254
00:34:55,033 --> 00:35:01,091
what is the trouble in the one who is your
part and parcel – it manifests.(implemented)

255
00:35:01,313 --> 00:35:07,423
You must see in the light of the Spirit, clearly
it should be visible, there should be no mistake in it.

256
00:35:07,423 --> 00:35:15,446
Not just one, everyone who will see, will say the
same thing, that Mother is wearing a white saree.

257
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:27,752
There can’t be many thoughts in it, there can be no
question of any quarrel in it - there can only be one Truth.

258
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:35,774
And the only one Truth that is, in spite of
being many, looks the same though.

259
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:46,862
But no one has known this love till date.
Very few have known, and those who have known,
no one wanted to know.

260
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:54,649
They harassed them, tormented them and after
their death erected temples, churches,

261
00:35:54,649 --> 00:36:03,690
and set up various gurudwaras, and all other things,
but did not know(feel) that love, which was the
basis of all these things.

262
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,300
In order to know that love, we will
have to depend on the Spirit.

263
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:26,219
Just as we rely on intelligence to know worldly things,
in the same way we have to rely on the Spirit
to know Supernatural(Divine) things.

264
00:36:27,231 --> 00:36:39,721
Now someone will say whether there is the Spirit or not.
Why have you already started quarrelling?
Why is there such a fuss about it already?

265
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:46,302
At least see whether it is or not. Now I
have come to prove it.

266
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:52,230
You could say about the people of the past whether they were true,
or fake - you can say many things about them.

267
00:36:54,144 --> 00:37:00,540
But now I have come to prove it to you,
that within you is the seat of the Spirit

268
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:07,985
and the Divine, omnipresent Lord
invites you to His kingdom.

269
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:17,886
This All-Pervading Power is the wave of
love of our Almighty Supreme Father.

270
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:32,896
Our Almighty Lord has created human-beings only to enjoy it.
Ego may delight a man but he can’t have joy, bliss.

271
00:37:32,896 --> 00:37:42,520
Happiness can be followed by sadness, but in joy
both the feelings of happiness and sorrow are broken and
there is only joy,

272
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,647
which cannot be described in words,
can only be experienced.

273
00:37:47,188 --> 00:37:51,478
But even it’s experience is not from this heart
which you call as heart.

274
00:37:55,387 --> 00:38:01,937
It should not be called the heart because if this is
the heart, then it sometimes makes us cry, sometimes laugh.

275
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:23,855
‘Hrid’- The one who knows - it is the Spirit. From the word ‘Ri’,
the meaning of ‘Ri’ is energy. Ra, ra, ra, means energy,
power. The One which gives this power of love, is the heart.

276
00:38:26,231 --> 00:38:35,361
Therefore the Spirit, which is giver of the power
of love, or is the knower, should be attained.

277
00:38:38,134 --> 00:38:44,124
So far, if all of you intellectuals reach/come down,
then I can talk of something further.

278
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:54,101
First come down to this much - it is a very important thing -
because otherwise your intelligence will stand up in between

279
00:38:54,101 --> 00:39:04,991
that, "But Mother, how is it like this." On the
level of the intellect whatever reply I give,
you will not be satisfied.

280
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:13,569
because it won’t be a complete answer. Although
logically I have brought you to that point
where you will say that,

281
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:20,397
"Well then, tell me Mother, how to get this Spirit?"
I hope that in all of you

282
00:39:20,397 --> 00:39:26,579
there may have been such a feeling, that whatever
Mother says, there is some truth in it.

283
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:35,671
Now you’ve asked to speak in English, so if someone
asks questions, I’ll reply in English.

284
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:06,170
Ask questions, ask anything, you people
are very learned.

285
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:22,540
Sahaja Yogi: What is the Spirit? What is the Spirit?

286
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,825
Shri Mataji: What are you saying?
Sahaja Yogi: What is the Spirit?

287
00:40:27,544 --> 00:40:39,534
Shri Mataji: Spirit is the shadow of that Supreme Lord.
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty,
which may be visible in this human being.

288
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:54,117
Is the reflection. It is a reflection of God Almighty
in our heart. If the heart is a good ...

289
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:59,727
[ASIDE - Yes this is better. If it’s a little
lukewarm, then will drink it. No tea.]

290
00:41:00,452 --> 00:41:05,902
If the heart is clean, like a clean mirror,
the reflection is the best.

291
00:41:07,152 --> 00:41:12,142
It's just simple thing, is the reflection of
God Almighty within ourselves.

292
00:41:15,116 --> 00:41:21,476
Seeker: Mother, please tell me whether Kundalini
and the Spirit, are both different things?
Shri Mataji: Okay child, sit down.

293
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:26,736
Shri Mataji: She has asked Me a question -
Should I tell in English, child?

294
00:41:27,204 --> 00:41:29,871
Seeker: Please tell in Hindi.
Shri Mataji: In Hindi, okay.

295
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:46,209
She has asked, what is the relationship between
Kundalini and the Spirit. Now I told you earlier,
that Spirit is the reflection of God.

296
00:41:46,411 --> 00:41:57,751
This is one thing. And the power of God,
is known as Adishakti, is called Holy Ghost,
or if you like/want, you can call it ‘Ruh’.

297
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:06,178
The reflection of this power in a person
is the Kundalini.

298
00:42:07,634 --> 00:42:15,494
As long as these two things do not meet, yoga
doesn’t take place. Yoga means union (unison).

299
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:27,045
And as soon as this thing happens,
then as if, you understand,

300
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:32,476
I’ll give an analogy again in a very gross way -
which is a very low/inferior thing -

301
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:46,609
that as soon as this is connected to the mains,
then just by plugging it into the plug,
it’s connection is established -

302
00:42:47,082 --> 00:42:53,582
so in this we can say, that Kundalini is this,
and the plug is the Spirit.

303
00:42:56,597 --> 00:43:05,557
Now it is a very gross thing, but what to do? Whatever
analogy is given, no matter how poetic it is made,
even then it will be inferior.

304
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:11,277
There is such a close relationship between
the two/with each other.

305
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:22,488
She asked me the question, what is the connection
between the Spirit and the Kundalini?

306
00:43:22,571 --> 00:43:34,801
I said, I was telling them in Hindi language a point,
that whatever we have to achieve or we achieve,

307
00:43:34,974 --> 00:43:49,644
or we describe, or talk about, is lower than us,
is not higher than us, because it is done through
our intelligence or through our emotions,

308
00:43:49,644 --> 00:43:54,759
so it's not higher than us, the whole thing
is lower than us, which we can handle.

309
00:43:56,593 --> 00:44:03,702
In imagination you may think of some greater things,
higher things, but this imagination that’s not reality.

310
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:09,192
So in reality when have to deal with something, in reality

311
00:44:09,972 --> 00:44:13,642
then you deal with things that are lower than you.

312
00:44:17,742 --> 00:44:21,572
That's why many people say that,
"Mother, you are not practical."

313
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:28,163
Many people say that, "Mother, you are
not practical," because to them it looks as if

314
00:44:28,479 --> 00:44:35,969
I have a very impractical attitude towards things,
because I must deal with the lower things.

315
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:42,142
Like I said in Bombay that, "I will not pay any black money
or anything. If I don't get the land, doesn't matter."

316
00:44:42,442 --> 00:44:47,432
So they thought I was not practical.
I must say that you should pay them.

317
00:44:47,432 --> 00:44:53,993
By God’s grace, some man donated us one acre
of land, without even paying a single pie.

318
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:03,448
Sahaja Yogi: There’s another question Mother.
Why is man afraid of the dark?

319
00:45:04,232 --> 00:45:06,742
Shri Mataji: Not all human beings feel.

320
00:45:08,564 --> 00:45:16,164
There’s a question - ‘Why a man is afraid of darkness?’
Not all.... Darkness is sometimes afraid of some men.

321
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:34,201
This thing is not right. The question is incomplete son.
But one is afraid because - the same thing has come,
hasn't it? That a person is afraid of the invisible.

322
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:40,522
And in the darkness, the mess that humans have done
on each other, that's why they’re afraid of it.

323
00:45:40,522 --> 00:45:48,373
There are many other things, but the main thing is this
that, when there is darkness inside a man, then
he’s very scared.

324
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:54,610
When he comes into the light, he’s never
afraid of the dark and darkness.

325
00:45:55,762 --> 00:46:02,412
It's dark inside, dark outside, so there’s too much
darkness. Man gets nervous

326
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:07,379
that, 'Oh my God, as it is can’t find the way
and on top of it so much darkness.’

327
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:16,250
But when there is light inside, the outside
darkness is no longer visible.

328
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:21,298
You think it's dark now, and I'm seeing
very beautiful things in it also.

329
00:46:23,428 --> 00:46:32,218
Seeker: There are such big-big universities
inside our country and even outside, and the
Government also spends so much money

330
00:46:32,218 --> 00:46:38,267
and all the other people together and so many students
are engaged in it, day and night work laboriously

331
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:42,614
and achieve something. According to You it
is inferior, of a lower level?

332
00:46:42,614 --> 00:46:45,746
Shri Mataji: Absolutely.
Seeker: So this system that You have made,

333
00:46:45,746 --> 00:46:49,477
for it’s arrangement, if there’s any provision
or system, can it not be given?

334
00:46:49,477 --> 00:46:55,585
Suppose someone is curious, has a desire to know,
and even if he’s not, then curiosity/inquisitiveness
could be created in him.

335
00:46:55,585 --> 00:47:02,424
And to turn people that way too, some ashram system
or something of this type that was told before,
such arrangement is there.

336
00:47:02,424 --> 00:47:07,580
Shri Mataji: I am telling about that condition only.
that they went to buy land for the ashram, then the
authorities started saying, "Give black money."

337
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:13,253
Then they started saying, ‘You give bribe,’ -
while doing all this, 12 years have passed.
Now a gentleman has given the land.

338
00:47:13,253 --> 00:47:21,814
Your President gave us land because I cured him. Thus
they gave us land in the vegetable market where bulls sit.

339
00:47:23,195 --> 00:47:28,640
That's correct. You go and ask. Very peculiar,
insane people roam around the world, tell me.

340
00:47:28,738 --> 00:47:37,185
Now they’ve given in the vegetable market. To this also
four years have passed. From the vegetable market
they took us here and there - this is what is going on.

341
00:47:37,185 --> 00:47:42,475
As long as man's intellect is not proper, till then
I don't think even an ashram will be built.

342
00:47:43,218 --> 00:47:51,068
Ashrams can be built only when people think that they
are needed. Otherwise only deserted universities
will be made here and no one will come in it at all.

343
00:47:51,595 --> 00:47:56,595
That's why, first it should strike a little in
man's brain - it should definitely ring in,

344
00:47:56,595 --> 00:48:02,364
and that's why it will strike man in Kaliyuga only,
otherwise, this thing will not come to his mind.

345
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:07,514
By explaining like this, no one will understand. You tell Me,
today so many of you people are sitting here,

346
00:48:07,514 --> 00:48:14,699
how many learned people of this university are sitting here,
I mean, not professors but college boys are sitting

347
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:27,579
Look, is there anyone - one, two, three, four, five, that's it.
Six - six children are sitting - you tell

348
00:48:28,246 --> 00:48:37,156
what should I do now? This university, in this Delhi University
for how many years I have been coming here, let me
tell you - for about 11-12 years.

349
00:48:37,156 --> 00:48:47,615
Got six children in twelve years, now tell?
What should I do, son - from My side I’m working very hard.

350
00:48:47,615 --> 00:49:01,816
Working tirelessly day and night but nobody comes here.
Then if it’s Delhi University, the condition is even worse.

351
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:09,310
And that which is your Jawaharlal Nehru University,
in that only one person came to listen to my lecture.

352
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:18,001
I just spoke to the walls.
There is absolutely a great need.

353
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:24,741
Unless these people are going to get into a lot of
trouble, till then, wisdom will not come into them.

354
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:32,575
Like, we have a lot of work being done abroad. At Cambridge
University, New York University, in Canada

355
00:49:32,575 --> 00:49:40,810
people are writing our thesis on Sahaja yoga, at three places.
Thesis is being written about Sahaja Yoga.

356
00:49:43,075 --> 00:49:51,165
Would anyone in Delhi University do such a thing?
Would anyone here agree, that on Sahaja Yoga a
thesis should be written.

357
00:49:51,165 --> 00:49:58,596
And even if they write, then such, so superficial,
that the work of Sahaja Yoga stops permanently.

358
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:07,030
They will say that Mother was sitting down wearing
a white saree, or her so-and-so is this or that,

359
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:12,370
anything, they will say things whatever superficially they
understand with their minds, as newspaper things go.

360
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,560
Thus there’s a little need that it should hit/strike the
minds of the people here.

361
00:50:17,685 --> 00:50:22,565
Without that, they cannot become sane, I think so.

362
00:50:22,571 --> 00:50:27,741
Son, I’ve been coming here since twelve years, then this
is the condition; From this you can understand.

363
00:50:28,388 --> 00:50:33,478
Now from this you can understand that I have not
shirked from hard work.

364
00:50:34,721 --> 00:50:41,719
And there are many such people here who are realized.
130 people from abroad are also sitting here.

365
00:50:42,085 --> 00:50:46,965
The same number from here are also sitting.
If people from abroad didn’t come, then even
this space would not have been occupied/full.

366
00:50:49,509 --> 00:51:02,153
It is true. What should I do? People are not interested,
there’s no thought in this direction. They think
that they have become great people. What to say!

367
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:14,963
Sahaja Yogi: There’s a gentleman who writes Mother,
"I failed to join your lectures on awakening of
Kundalini on Muladhara and Sahasrara Chakras.

368
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:24,725
Sahaja Yogi: My keen desire to learn the same by
tape recorder and I’m leaving to my native place
by 2nd or 3rd of this month.

369
00:51:24,725 --> 00:51:27,245
Shri Mataji: Who’s it?
Sahaja Yogi: Some gentleman.

370
00:51:27,245 --> 00:51:42,029
Shri Mataji: Who’s this gentleman? Alright. There is a
arrangement, that you can take my lectures, which is
taped and you can take from there. Alright?

371
00:51:42,071 --> 00:51:47,621
But you see, My lectures are of no use, if you
do not get your realization.

372
00:51:48,595 --> 00:51:54,505
It’s a good thing, you see, because Mother speaks
well, you see, She’s good at speaking,

373
00:51:54,505 --> 00:52:00,417
so nice to listen to Her but you must
get your realization first, alright?

374
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,662
Seeker: (Unclear – I’ve taken?)
Shri Mataji: You got it? Then you take it

375
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:07,339
Then it’s alright, then you are my son.
Alright? You take whatever you like.

376
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:16,007
Sahaja Yogi: This same gentleman writes, " During my 30 years
of experience in religion and yoga, I have

377
00:52:16,037 --> 00:52:23,487
not seen such a eminent person who, who’s got a
vast knowledge of Kundalini. Before I left Delhi

378
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:30,407
I wish to learn more about Sahaja Yoga and
treatment. I came to Delhi last December.

379
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:35,967
Shri Mataji: To whom did he go?
Sahaja Yogi: To whom did you go first?

380
00:52:36,881 --> 00:52:41,661
Shri Mataji: Which eminent person did you visit?
Seeker: Mataji only

381
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:44,183
Shri Mataji: Yes?
Seeker: You only, Mother.

382
00:52:44,183 --> 00:52:47,213
Shri Mataji: What? Which Mother?
Seeker: Went to You.

383
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:50,246
Seeker: I’m telling about You Mother, I have learned from You only.
Shri Mataji: You learnt it from Me?

384
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,262
Seeker: Yes.
Shri Mataji: You learnt it from Me?
Seeker: Yes.

385
00:52:53,262 --> 00:52:58,541
Shri Mataji: Then it’s alright.
Sahaja Yogi: He’s talking 30 years of
experience in religion and yoga.

386
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:08,182
Shri Mataji: How did you get the experience of 30 years?
Hmm? I started my work only 12 years back.

387
00:53:09,294 --> 00:53:16,084
Sahaja Yogi: He worked overtime.
Shri Mataji: It’s alright, doesn’t matter but you better
take the taperecorder

388
00:53:16,084 --> 00:53:21,055
if you got your realization even today,
you can take it, alright? That's all.

389
00:53:21,055 --> 00:53:25,380
You see, because without Self-realization
it's just a tool in your hands,

390
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,799
but once you get realized, it is a light in your
hands. Alright, that’s why. Give it to him.

391
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:36,352
You can take. We have got arrangements. Those who
want to take My tapes, can take it.

392
00:53:36,352 --> 00:53:43,696
but you have to be a realized soul,
otherwise we don't give because what's the
use of this cheap popularity.

393
00:53:44,276 --> 00:53:50,176
There's no need to have cheap popularity about
Sahaja Yoga - you have to become.

394
00:53:50,176 --> 00:53:54,974
Here you cannot be just a member, we have no
membership, nothing – this is a living organism.

395
00:53:56,078 --> 00:54:01,988
So, if you become, you have every right
but if you don't become, you have no right.

396
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:09,831
Just like, you have to be an Indian citizen to
have some rights in this country
– I wonder if we have any!

397
00:54:12,953 --> 00:54:22,763
But here in God’s, in the realm of God, if you
just enter into it, you have all the rights

398
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:30,020
and He looks after you with every support, with
every help, so much so that you think you have

399
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:39,385
now lost the meaning of miracles
- every step you will be amazed.

400
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:46,735
Sahaja Yogi: The same person he has asked,
something about, how to cure insomnia?

401
00:54:46,735 --> 00:54:49,344
Shri Mataji: Kill what?
Sahaja Yogi: Insomnia
Shri Mataji: Insomnia, alright.

402
00:54:49,396 --> 00:54:53,856
Sahaja Yogi: and he says that, ‘I did not understand
last time because of 50% knowledge of Hindi.’

403
00:54:53,856 --> 00:55:00,363
Shri Mataji: Insomnia is absolutely curable. If you
have attended My lectures before this,

404
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:04,077
I have told you how to give balance to yourself,
but in any case

405
00:55:04,077 --> 00:55:09,512
you come to the centre and they will tell you
how to cure insomnia. It’s absolutely simple.

406
00:55:12,904 --> 00:55:19,694
Sahaja Yogi: A boy has written that, ‘For the
realization of the Spirit whatever formula
or whatever we can do,

407
00:55:19,694 --> 00:55:25,566
please tell, so that that energy can synchronize
or resonate with my body.

408
00:55:25,566 --> 00:55:29,386
I am attending this discourse for the first time.
Shri Mataji: Huh?

409
00:55:29,386 --> 00:55:31,410
Sahaja Yogi: For the first time I have attended this discourse.
Shri Mataji: Okay

410
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:37,343
Shri Mataji: Whose question is this?
Is it your son? It’s a matter of great happiness.

411
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:42,507
He asked the correct thing that, ‘I want to
have Self-realization.’ It will be done.

412
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:47,962
That's enough - it will happen. But when
this energy starts flowing through you

413
00:55:47,962 --> 00:55:57,041
then you have to learn about it, you have to know,
because the yoga has taken place but another meaning
of ‘yog’ is deftness/trick/tactics – skill.

414
00:55:57,041 --> 00:56:03,666
After knowing Yoga, you should understand,
it’s tactics, how is it to be worked out.
