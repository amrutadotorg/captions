Guru Puja, July 12th, 1998

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:21.447
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:06:23.507 --> 00:06:33.272
Today, we have assembled here to do the Guru Puja.

00:06:34.582 --> 00:06:42.373
The word "guru" comes from

00:06:42.574 --> 00:06:48.475
"the one which is magnetic,

00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:52.170
the person who is magnetic";

00:06:52.371 --> 00:07:00.630
the one which attracts the attention of the seekers

00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:06.123
is the guru. Also it means

00:07:06.324 --> 00:07:11.475
the heaviness, or you can say,

00:07:11.676 --> 00:07:17.858
a person who is very steady,

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:26.305
who is very deep, who has the knowledge,

00:07:26.506 --> 00:07:33.453
and who can act like the Mother Earth.

00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:41.319
For the power of magnetism in the Mother Earth

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.999
also is called as magnetic,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.444
but in Sanskrit is "Gurutwa karshan,"

00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:54.764
means "the attraction

00:07:54.965 --> 00:07:59.983
of the heaviness of the Mother Earth."

00:08:00.184 --> 00:08:05.475
But actually it is

00:08:05.676 --> 00:08:12.194
a power of the Mother Earth that makes us stand

00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:18.796
properly on our legs when it is rotating

00:08:18.997 --> 00:08:21.319
with such a tremendous speed,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.749
otherwise we would be all thrown away.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.194
With that velocity that She is moving,

00:08:30.395 --> 00:08:41.455
we are still attached or we are one in our balance,

00:08:41.656 --> 00:08:47.119
is only because She has gravity.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.978
This gravity has to be in a guru.

00:08:54.179 --> 00:09:00.197
Gravity means

00:09:00.398 --> 00:09:10.042
a kind of a serious understanding of oneself

00:09:10.243 --> 00:09:15.706
and one's own responsibilities.

00:09:15.907 --> 00:09:20.987
So a guru has to be very steady.

00:09:21.188 --> 00:09:30.015
In these modern times, people are very mobile,

00:09:30.216 --> 00:09:34.621
all the time agitated,

00:09:34.822 --> 00:09:38.434
all the time getting disturbed.

00:09:38.635 --> 00:09:43.012
With small things happening here and there, they get disturbed.

00:09:43.213 --> 00:09:48.457
They meet people who are not of any quality,

00:09:48.658 --> 00:09:51.090
then they get disturbed.

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:55.145
These disturbing qualities

00:09:55.346 --> 00:10:01.622
come from our deficiency in our gravity.

00:10:01.823 --> 00:10:06.106
A person who has gravity doesn't get depressed,

00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:09.254
neither get excited,

00:10:09.455 --> 00:10:12.754
nor get overly enthusiastic,

00:10:12.955 --> 00:10:17.676
nor is he very sad or unhappy.

00:10:17.877 --> 00:10:20.996
So he's in the center,

00:10:21.197 --> 00:10:25.371
he's in the center of his being.

00:10:25.572 --> 00:10:30.129
But how do we become the guru?

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.606
That is very important for Sahaja Yogis to understand.

00:10:34.807 --> 00:10:37.911
Many have felt that they are gurus,

00:10:38.112 --> 00:10:41.731
they have tried to behave in a funny manner,

00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:45.903
and have lost their guru position.

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:49.611
First and foremost thing for Sahaja Yogis,

00:10:49.812 --> 00:10:55.408
it is important that they must have introspection,

00:10:55.609 --> 00:10:58.674
they must watch themselves.

00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:04.182
If a person runs about

00:11:04.383 --> 00:11:08.119
changing because a fashion has come,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.260
because people have suppressed them, or have asked them;

00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:19.619
just to please people of cheap values,

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:27.390
if a person changes, then he cannot be a guru.

00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:31.507
He has to station himself

00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:37.046
properly on the values of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:37.247 --> 00:11:41.265
Without introspection you will not know,

00:11:41.466 --> 00:11:45.632
you will never remember what you have done wrong,

00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:52.179
nor will you think of what you have to do right.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:12:00.036
But that is only possible if you go on improving yourself.

00:12:00.397 --> 00:12:02.844
First and foremost thing is,

00:12:03.045 --> 00:12:07.305
all the great saints have praised their guru.

00:12:07.506 --> 00:12:13.032
For example, we have a very great saint,

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:16.282
Gyaneshwara, in India.

00:12:16.483 --> 00:12:20.016
He's written a complete chapter about the guru.

00:12:20.217 --> 00:12:24.086
In English they have translated it as "preceptor" -

00:12:24.287 --> 00:12:26.680
guru is the preceptor -

00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:30.336
and what he has done is a great thing.

00:12:30.537 --> 00:12:34.414
He says you are not to challenge the guru,

00:12:34.615 --> 00:12:37.883
otherwise you can never become a guru;

00:12:38.084 --> 00:12:41.508
for name's sake you might be, but you are not.

00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:45.664
Secondly, you can never misbehave.

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:49.477
You can never be rude, arrogant,

00:12:49.678 --> 00:12:54.375
and you cannot show your temper to a guru.

00:12:54.576 --> 00:12:58.224
If that is so, that means you are not a guru,

00:12:58.425 --> 00:13:06.760
you are still on a very low level personality.

00:13:07.011 --> 00:13:09.740
It is very clearly said

00:13:09.941 --> 00:13:16.578
that if you try to say against other gurus

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:20.719
who are real gurus, who are very high caliber,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:26.414
that also, then you are not a guru.

00:13:26.622 --> 00:13:31.711
But I would say that you all have got now vibrations,

00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:35.516
you all have got vibratory awareness.

00:13:35.717 --> 00:13:38.321
When you have vibratory awareness,

00:13:38.522 --> 00:13:43.219
you are capable of finding out about everyone.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.852
Now you need not talk about

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:49.649
your own understanding of a person,

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.704
but try to face that person directly,

00:13:53.905 --> 00:13:58.157
and tell that person, "This is the problem,"

00:13:58.358 --> 00:14:01.048
and ask him to change.

00:14:01.249 --> 00:14:06.071
But in Sahaja Yoga we have something more than other gurus had.

00:14:06.272 --> 00:14:09.134
Other gurus were very, very strict.

00:14:09.335 --> 00:14:13.243
They used to carry a stick in their hand, a big stick

00:14:13.444 --> 00:14:19.134
which they would use for walking or for hitting their disciples.

00:14:19.335 --> 00:14:24.930
They used to hit their disciples in such a bad manner

00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:33.231
that the disciple was literally frightened of the guru.

00:14:33.432 --> 00:14:39.478
I'll give you an example of a guru I came across.

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:45.525
One fellow was there in India

00:14:45.726 --> 00:14:51.259
who came to one of the ladies who was a Sahaja Yogini,

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:58.361
and he said that "My guru has sent me word

00:14:58.562 --> 00:15:04.009
that Adi Shakti's going to come and stay with you. Is it true?"

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.728
She said, "Yes, She's going to stay with me. So what?"

00:15:07.929 --> 00:15:11.416
He said, "My guru has told me

00:15:11.617 --> 00:15:14.369
that 'You go and request Her,

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.338
and if She could come to our ashram.'"

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:21.611
She said, "I'll ask Mataji, I don't know."

00:15:21.812 --> 00:15:31.997
This fellow came to a program and he saw Me, a housewife.

00:15:32.198 --> 00:15:35.442
He said, "This cannot be that Guru."

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:42.255
But when I came in, he saw, and when I did Self Realization,

00:15:42.456 --> 00:15:46.294
that everybody's Kundalini was awakened, he was so surprised

00:15:46.495 --> 00:15:51.192
and he prostrated himself before Me.

00:15:51.393 --> 00:15:54.535
Now, his guru was living in Amarnath,

00:15:54.736 --> 00:16:04.870
is a very famous religious place in the Himalayas.

00:16:05.071 --> 00:16:09.417
And this fellow lived in a place called Ambarnath.

00:16:09.618 --> 00:16:16.155
So he asked Me, "Mother, will You come to my ashram?"

00:16:16.356 --> 00:16:20.913
I said, "Why not?" Because these gurus in the ancient time

00:16:21.114 --> 00:16:24.601
never used to leave their seat, they call takia -

00:16:24.802 --> 00:16:29.140
means "the pillow" - they never left their takia.

00:16:29.341 --> 00:16:31.663
I said, "All right, I don't mind. I'll come to you,

00:16:31.864 --> 00:16:33.828
to your ashram."

00:16:34.029 --> 00:16:37.055
So he's just keeping quiet all the while.

00:16:37.256 --> 00:16:41.124
So I went there, this guru fell at My Feet,

00:16:41.325 --> 00:16:44.577
and he was very, very respectful;

00:16:44.778 --> 00:16:51.108
and then we came back home.

00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:54.538
So this fellow started telling Me, "If You don't tell my guru,

00:16:54.739 --> 00:16:59.733
I would like to tell You that I have got a very bad Agnya.

00:16:59.934 --> 00:17:03.194
Can You cure, Mother?" I said, "Why not? I will."

00:17:03.395 --> 00:17:06.311
So I went back to this guru again, and I said,

00:17:06.512 --> 00:17:10.061
"Why didn't you cure his Agnya?"

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:13.952
He said, "Why? Why should I cure? Who cured my Agnya?

00:17:14.153 --> 00:17:18.538
I worked out myself. I had to introspect, find out,

00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:22.632
and I cured my own Agnya, and why should I cure his Agnya?

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:28.351
Let him plod, let him work, let him get to this.

00:17:28.552 --> 00:17:34.937
Otherwise he will be a spoilt man."

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:38.382
I was quite surprised. And he said,

00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:42.726
"You do it because You are a Mother. You are nothing but love,

00:17:42.927 --> 00:17:47.749
and that's why You are doing it, all this, for others.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:56.107
But not me! No guru will open the Agnya of his disciples."

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:58.545
I said, "Then why are you a guru?"

00:17:58.746 --> 00:18:04.316
He said, "Because we have to guide them.

00:18:20.607 --> 00:18:26.344
And if they have their Agnya badly cut out,

00:18:26.545 --> 00:18:32.633
if their attention is not all right, I'm not bothered about it.

00:18:32.834 --> 00:18:36.711
It is their duty to introspect and find,

00:18:36.912 --> 00:18:40.109
and climb the ladder which I've put before them.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:44.945
So I'm a guru, I can only give them the ladder to climb up.

00:18:45.146 --> 00:18:47.914
It is they who should work very hard,

00:18:48.115 --> 00:18:50.820
it is they who should introspect,

00:18:51.021 --> 00:18:53.609
it is they who should correct themselves.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.492
Why should I help them to such an extent

00:18:57.693 --> 00:19:00.820
that you open their Agnya?"

00:19:01.021 --> 00:19:03.622
I said, "All right, you allow Me to open his Agnya,

00:19:03.823 --> 00:19:04.823
if you don't mind."

00:19:05.024 --> 00:19:07.153
He said, "You are a Mother, do what You like;

00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:10.895
I have nothing to say. If You want to do that,

00:19:11.096 --> 00:19:15.176
You'll spoil him, You'll spoil him.

00:19:15.377 --> 00:19:17.809
Let him do it on his own,

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.575
otherwise You'll be spoiling him."

00:19:20.776 --> 00:19:22.716
I said, "As you are also spoiling,

00:19:22.917 --> 00:19:26.044
that you don't open anybody's Agnyas, yes?"

00:19:26.245 --> 00:19:31.286
"But whatever position I've achieved is a permanent one."

00:19:31.487 --> 00:19:34.474
So I opened his Agnya.

00:19:34.675 --> 00:19:39.208
Then this fellow, on his way he told Me that

00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:44.685
his guru came back "and he put me hanging on a well.

00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:47.724
And he used to every time lower the rope

00:19:47.925 --> 00:19:53.474
so I would go into the water. Ten times he did it."

00:19:53.675 --> 00:19:56.544
But I said, "Why did he do such a cruel thing?"

00:19:56.745 --> 00:19:59.646
He said, "Because he found me smoking a cigarette."

00:19:59.847 --> 00:20:02.474
My goodness!

00:20:02.691 --> 00:20:04.260
So I asked his guru, I said,

00:20:04.461 --> 00:20:07.783
"Why do you do such horrible things to your disciples?"

00:20:07.984 --> 00:20:11.806
He said, "Otherwise, if you don't do like that

00:20:12.007 --> 00:20:15.142
they will never rise, they'll never come up.

00:20:15.343 --> 00:20:18.533
You go on forgiving them and the more you forgive,

00:20:18.734 --> 00:20:23.072
the worse they become, and they will show no ascent at all.

00:20:23.273 --> 00:20:25.845
So you have to be very strict with them.

00:20:26.046 --> 00:20:29.861
Please don't spoil them all the time."

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:33.299
I was really surprised. How could he say so?

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.705
"You see," he said, "Mother, if you give everything free,

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:41.752
you give them everything so easily,

00:20:41.953 --> 00:20:44.971
they will never value their self-respect,

00:20:45.172 --> 00:20:48.830
they will never value their Self Realization."

00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:53.221
I said, "It's not so. You have to give them a chance.

00:20:53.422 --> 00:20:57.088
You have to allow them to rise,

00:20:57.289 --> 00:21:02.455
and to allow them to become something.

00:21:02.656 --> 00:21:05.812
Like Mother Earth, what She does,

00:21:06.013 --> 00:21:10.799
She sprouts the seeds, then the trees come up.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.364
Then after that She gives them the fruits,

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:19.473
and She sees that the fruits are ripened; all does She do."

00:21:19.674 --> 00:21:26.496
But he said, "But they are not trees, You see, they're human beings,

00:21:26.697 --> 00:21:31.105
and they have freedom to become devils also."

00:21:31.306 --> 00:21:35.425
I said, "All right, if there are devils, I can manage them.

00:21:35.626 --> 00:21:39.222
You just see how I can manage them. And if they are devils

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:43.370
they will remain devils, you cannot change them."

00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:45.761
So he argued with Me,

00:21:45.962 --> 00:21:48.230
and when he met Sahaja Yogis he asked them,

00:21:48.431 --> 00:21:52.769
"How many of you are willing to give life for Shri Mataji?

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:57.714
Do you know what She has given you?" They said, "Yes, we do."

00:21:57.915 --> 00:22:00.737
So they came to Me and told, "Mother,

00:22:00.938 --> 00:22:04.651
he wanted us to give life for You." I said,

00:22:04.852 --> 00:22:08.745
"There's no necessity, it's not necessary;

00:22:08.946 --> 00:22:12.370
because he used to ask his disciples, perhaps."

00:22:12.571 --> 00:22:18.018
And then I met many like him who were very strict gurus,

00:22:18.219 --> 00:22:22.065
complete obedience was needed; complete humility,

00:22:22.266 --> 00:22:24.182
complete surrender was needed.

00:22:24.383 --> 00:22:27.159
A word against the guru was not tolerated,

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.526
but even you could not answer,

00:22:29.727 --> 00:22:34.034
you could not show any temper to a guru.

00:22:34.235 --> 00:22:38.128
Now I have met people who are like that sometimes,

00:22:38.329 --> 00:22:41.441
then I stopped talking to them, that's it.

00:22:41.642 --> 00:22:43.214
If they want to improve, they can improve;

00:22:43.415 --> 00:22:47.277
they don't want to improve, you cannot force them to improve.

00:22:47.478 --> 00:22:49.722
But according to these gurus,

00:22:49.923 --> 00:22:50.923
there should be a great fear in their mind,

00:22:52.954 --> 00:22:55.409
that they should be so frightened

00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:00.914
that they should behave themselves.

00:23:01.571 --> 00:23:04.956
Now we expect so much from the guru,

00:23:05.157 --> 00:23:09.300
that he's your father, mother,

00:23:09.501 --> 00:23:13.363
he's a friend, everything to you.

00:23:13.564 --> 00:23:18.746
He is a pure person who just wants your ascent.

00:23:18.947 --> 00:23:22.262
He wants to look after you,

00:23:22.463 --> 00:23:26.856
he wants to guide you, wants to protect you,

00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:31.739
and takes you to the life of spirituality;

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.614
and this is the way a guru has to work out.

00:23:35.815 --> 00:23:41.012
But what is expected of the disciples is even much worse.

00:23:41.213 --> 00:23:48.867
The disciple has to be absolutely a pure person,

00:23:49.068 --> 00:23:55.961
he should have a pure desire to become a spiritual person.

00:23:56.162 --> 00:23:58.734
If he doesn't have this pure desire,

00:23:58.935 --> 00:24:04.070
he has some other desires, then absolutely useless.

00:24:04.271 --> 00:24:07.562
Like some people come to Sahaja Yoga, I've seen it,

00:24:07.763 --> 00:24:10.437
they want to make a name out of themselves,

00:24:10.638 --> 00:24:13.718
they become great masters of everything,

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:16.281
they want to dominate everything.

00:24:16.482 --> 00:24:20.898
That is not, that is not important.

00:24:21.099 --> 00:24:23.961
There are some people who try to make money in Sahaja Yoga:

00:24:24.162 --> 00:24:26.742
a way of making money.

00:24:26.943 --> 00:24:30.172
That also absolutely wrong; and not only that,

00:24:30.373 --> 00:24:32.281
but it's very low level,

00:24:32.482 --> 00:24:35.758
that you want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:35.959 --> 00:24:40.055
Then there are people who just come here for some politics.

00:24:40.256 --> 00:24:43.688
They go on saying things here and saying things there.

00:24:43.889 --> 00:24:48.696
All these things are not going to give you any ascent whatsoever.

00:24:48.897 --> 00:24:53.962
You have come here only to achieve a

00:24:54.163 --> 00:24:59.798
great life of spirituality, of becoming a guru.

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:03.243
Now also this politics business is quite a lot,

00:25:03.444 --> 00:25:09.509
people try to enjoy the position of a leader,

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:15.431
so they try to keep that position in a very special way.

00:25:15.632 --> 00:25:17.150
There's no need.

00:25:17.351 --> 00:25:23.548
If you are a leader because you are a great master,

00:25:23.749 --> 00:25:27.103
you will remain. Nobody can challenge you,

00:25:27.304 --> 00:25:30.602
nobody can dethrone you, and one should not get disturbed

00:25:30.803 --> 00:25:33.047
with any such fear.

00:25:33.248 --> 00:25:39.328
Sahaja Yoga is a yoga in which fear doesn't play any part;

00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:41.555
there's no fear, for you.

00:25:41.756 --> 00:25:47.469
Only thing for your ascent, it is necessary that you introspect.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:51.172
Try to find out, what have you been doing?

00:25:51.373 --> 00:25:57.772
Are you an, absolutely a humble person?

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.383
Do you do whatever is told to you?

00:26:01.584 --> 00:26:09.899
Supposing I tell somebody just go to, say, some place,

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.399
he may not go. He'll come and tell Me,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.532
"Mother, You know, this happened, that happened" -

00:26:14.733 --> 00:26:17.993
some excuse, he may not go.

00:26:18.194 --> 00:26:20.696
But that's not being good.

00:26:20.897 --> 00:26:23.201
If you have been told to go to that place,

00:26:23.402 --> 00:26:26.779
there must be some meaning and you have to go.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.123
You have to obey. If you are not obedient

00:26:30.324 --> 00:26:35.545
then you cannot become a guru, because if you cannot obey,

00:26:35.746 --> 00:26:39.014
how can others obey you?

00:26:39.215 --> 00:26:42.639
This obedience is not for any personal gain of the guru,

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.530
not at all, but for your gain only,

00:26:45.731 --> 00:26:49.272
for your education, for your ascent.

00:26:49.473 --> 00:26:54.405
So if such a view is taken then what happens,

00:26:54.606 --> 00:27:00.569
that you start getting all the qualities of a guru.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.046
Firstly, a guru cannot be fussy man,

00:27:04.247 --> 00:27:05.694
first and foremost thing.

00:27:05.895 --> 00:27:08.467
"I want this house, I want that thing;

00:27:08.668 --> 00:27:12.678
I can't like this, I can't like that."

00:27:12.879 --> 00:27:16.326
If a person who does not know

00:27:16.527 --> 00:27:20.037
how to get detached from all these habits,

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:24.014
he cannot be a guru. How can he ascend?

00:27:24.215 --> 00:27:28.248
Of course, I mean, you have to try

00:27:28.449 --> 00:27:30.896
that you get rid of all these habits.

00:27:31.097 --> 00:27:34.584
They are funny habits which make you miserable;

00:27:34.785 --> 00:27:39.006
doesn't make miserable others, as it makes you miserable.

00:27:39.207 --> 00:27:43.803
No habit should cling to a guru.

00:27:44.004 --> 00:27:50.975
First and foremost is that he has to be beyond time.

00:27:51.176 --> 00:27:55.459
He should not worry about time.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.311
Many-a-times I have seen people,

00:27:58.512 --> 00:28:02.780
if they have to go to a airport, for example,

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:04.639
something enters into their body,

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.428
they become speedy suddenly, everybody.

00:28:07.629 --> 00:28:11.334
Even if I have to go, I'm going,

00:28:11.535 --> 00:28:13.865
then all of them will become speedy,

00:28:14.066 --> 00:28:16.951
everybody starts running helter-skelter. Why?

00:28:17.152 --> 00:28:22.029
I am going, you are not going; but it happens.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.685
Like that, if you tell somebody you have to go to a function

00:28:25.886 --> 00:28:30.427
or for some felicitation, people start jumping about,

00:28:30.628 --> 00:28:34.779
and that's a very modern disease, it was not before.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:40.849
So they start seeing that we are getting late, getting upset.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:45.638
But if you go on worrying like that, you don't go beyond time.

00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:49.747
And when you go beyond time, you control time,

00:28:49.948 --> 00:28:55.263
time is with you all the time. Whenever you go, it happens.

00:28:55.464 --> 00:28:57.927
I'll give an example of that.

00:28:58.128 --> 00:29:02.810
We had a little girl in Cabella who fell down

00:29:03.011 --> 00:29:05.810
and she broke her hand, very badly.

00:29:06.011 --> 00:29:08.452
I was about to leave for America, I was,

00:29:08.653 --> 00:29:10.921
actually I'd come out of My room.

00:29:11.122 --> 00:29:12.682
When I saw the child I said,

00:29:12.883 --> 00:29:17.752
"All right, doesn't matter. I'll cure this child first."

00:29:17.953 --> 00:29:19.627
They said, "No, Mother, but Your plane!"

00:29:19.828 --> 00:29:22.565
I said, "It's all right, forget it."

00:29:22.766 --> 00:29:29.612
So I got the child, treated the child, and she was all right.

00:29:29.813 --> 00:29:36.940
And after, I think, half-an-hour, I left, I left for the airport.

00:29:37.141 --> 00:29:39.518
And you'll be amazed to hear

00:29:39.719 --> 00:29:43.901
that that aeroplane was out of order,

00:29:44.102 --> 00:29:45.706
which was going to New York.

00:29:45.907 --> 00:29:49.495
So there's this plane is out of order. Then they said,

00:29:49.696 --> 00:29:53.722
"All right, You can go by another plane which goes to Washington,

00:29:53.923 --> 00:29:57.761
with the same ticket." I said, "Very good idea, give Me that,"

00:29:57.962 --> 00:30:00.691
and I went by that. So that I reached Washington,

00:30:00.892 --> 00:30:05.168
which is a very, very nice airport to arrive,

00:30:05.369 --> 00:30:09.402
because there's no problem of customs,

00:30:09.603 --> 00:30:11.675
there's no crowd, nothing.

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:14.753
All people go to New York, I don't know why.

00:30:14.954 --> 00:30:18.269
They should all go to Washington, it's very surprising.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:23.449
I discovered for Myself, that I wished I had not gone

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:28.113
by that horrible plane to go to New York.

00:30:28.314 --> 00:30:31.426
Like that everything works out.

00:30:31.627 --> 00:30:37.324
And the time comes what is good for you.

00:30:37.525 --> 00:30:42.012
It is such a lot of experience of Mine which I can tell you,

00:30:42.213 --> 00:30:47.098
that to worry about time itself is a headache.

00:30:47.299 --> 00:30:52.176
If you leave it to this divine power and believe in it,

00:30:52.377 --> 00:30:56.176
then everything works out for your good.

00:30:56.377 --> 00:31:05.085
And if it does not, you must know that it is your destiny,

00:31:05.286 --> 00:31:09.327
you must accept, you must learn to accept.

00:31:09.528 --> 00:31:11.780
Because whatever you have fixed up yourself

00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:15.905
as something very great, is not.

00:31:16.106 --> 00:31:19.389
So what is the greatest thing you have to achieve? -

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.787
your detachment.

00:31:21.988 --> 00:31:24.459
Then you become gunateet:

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.615
means, as you know, we have three gunas within us.

00:31:28.816 --> 00:31:36.298
One is, they call is as sattwa guna, is the best.

00:31:36.611 --> 00:31:40.715
But there are two other gunas which are, as you know,

00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:43.965
the left side and right side.

00:31:44.166 --> 00:31:48.473
Either you are a right-sided person or a left-sided person.

00:31:48.674 --> 00:31:55.770
These two gunas within us are of no importance.

00:31:55.971 --> 00:31:58.747
Supposing you are a right-sided person,

00:31:58.948 --> 00:32:04.145
then what happens to you? You become over-active.

00:32:04.346 --> 00:32:06.848
Over- activity gives you fatigue,

00:32:07.049 --> 00:32:10.356
gives you all kinds of diseases which you have seen,

00:32:10.557 --> 00:32:12.919
and you have to cure right side.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.724
Such a person is extremely speedy,

00:32:15.925 --> 00:32:18.615
he cannot sit in one place for two minutes,

00:32:18.816 --> 00:32:21.248
all the time jumping,

00:32:21.449 --> 00:32:25.912
and he creates problems for himself and his family.

00:32:26.113 --> 00:32:30.904
Then the left-sided person,

00:32:31.105 --> 00:32:34.584
which we call as the tamo guna -

00:32:34.785 --> 00:32:37.187
the right-sided is rajo guna, and the left-sided

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:43.085
is the one which is tamo guna -

00:32:43.286 --> 00:32:48.835
"tamo" means darkness, such a man is afraid of darkness,

00:32:49.036 --> 00:32:52.202
darkness, everything he is afraid of.

00:32:52.403 --> 00:33:00.349
But he becomes a very intriguingly, very crooked person.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:05.404
He always tries to trouble people in a very crooked manner,

00:33:05.605 --> 00:33:10.412
not openly, while the right-sided man is openly a Hitler.

00:33:10.613 --> 00:33:15.279
But this one, the second one, the one who is called as tamo guni,

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.170
is the one tries to trouble others very much.

00:33:20.371 --> 00:33:25.428
Rajo guni has a opinion of his own about everything.

00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:28.944
When he is so much having his own opinion,

00:33:29.145 --> 00:33:32.655
he goes on forcing it on to other persons.

00:33:32.856 --> 00:33:37.147
But if you see his own life, he is in complete misery.

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:41.514
He cannot carry on with people, he cannot talk to people,

00:33:41.715 --> 00:33:46.131
and there's a very big gap between himself,

00:33:46.332 --> 00:33:49.514
his Spirit and his being.

00:33:49.715 --> 00:33:52.686
The second type, the tamo gunis, are the ones

00:33:52.887 --> 00:33:56.038
who end up with all kinds of diseases.

00:33:56.239 --> 00:33:59.780
Even the right-sided people get lots of diseases.

00:33:59.981 --> 00:34:03.624
But the left ones get it psychosomatic.

00:34:03.825 --> 00:34:07.007
Psychosomatic diseases are very dangerous

00:34:07.208 --> 00:34:10.663
and not curable by human doctors.

00:34:10.864 --> 00:34:12.913
So you have to take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:13.114 --> 00:34:15.561
But again you go to the right or to the left,

00:34:15.762 --> 00:34:21.577
again right, to the left. This is not a very good attitude,

00:34:21.778 --> 00:34:27.249
I think, towards life that you get bound by one of these gunas,

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:30.393
or you are all the time like a pendulum

00:34:30.594 --> 00:34:33.393
moving from left to right, right to left.

00:34:33.594 --> 00:34:36.315
So you have to be a steady person.

00:34:36.516 --> 00:34:40.260
For that, you all have to meditate.

00:34:40.461 --> 00:34:42.823
I know immediately a person who meditates,

00:34:43.024 --> 00:34:46.112
and I know who does not meditate.

00:34:46.313 --> 00:34:49.307
You will yourself know a person who meditates.

00:34:49.508 --> 00:34:52.455
It's a question of ten, fifteen minutes,

00:34:52.656 --> 00:34:55.760
but that you must do every night and morning,

00:34:55.961 --> 00:35:01.119
about five minutes' meditation; then you develop your balance,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:07.461
you develop your tenacity, you develop your own body

00:35:07.662 --> 00:35:11.672
in such a manner that it can stand lots of nonsense,

00:35:11.873 --> 00:35:16.930
it can bear lots of things. You don't have then desires left -

00:35:17.131 --> 00:35:21.243
what food you should eat, when you should eat,

00:35:21.444 --> 00:35:25.188
whom you should please - nothing of the kind.

00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:28.344
You yourself become such a sweet person

00:35:28.545 --> 00:35:32.703
that everybody is pleased, and understand that

00:35:32.904 --> 00:35:38.523
one has to be like you.

00:35:38.724 --> 00:35:42.007
The people see you and you become like a model.

00:35:42.208 --> 00:35:46.585
People start following you, that means you become a guru.

00:35:46.786 --> 00:35:51.054
In this way you get rid of these two habits that you have,

00:35:51.255 --> 00:35:55.070
of left and right side. Now sattwa gunis are the people

00:35:55.271 --> 00:36:00.914
who believe in the righteousness, but when they are righteous,

00:36:01.115 --> 00:36:05.141
they have contempt for others who are not righteous.

00:36:05.342 --> 00:36:07.868
They go on saying things to such people,

00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:11.196
so they can develop a kind of a temperament

00:36:11.397 --> 00:36:15.282
so they become aloof. They can go to Himalayas,

00:36:15.483 --> 00:36:19.813
sit there and not to meet anybody; get out of the society,

00:36:20.014 --> 00:36:22.485
get out of all your relations, everyone,

00:36:22.686 --> 00:36:29.274
and just establish yourself as a big guru somewhere.

00:36:29.475 --> 00:36:32.665
This kind of also another generation is there,

00:36:32.866 --> 00:36:38.720
which is of no use. I met some of them when I was in Hardwar.

00:36:38.921 --> 00:36:41.993
And I told them, "What are you doing here in the Himalayas?"

00:36:42.194 --> 00:36:44.313
They said, "We don't want to face human beings.

00:36:44.514 --> 00:36:47.290
They're useless people, they're good for nothing.

00:36:47.491 --> 00:36:50.549
You do anything for them, they go on troubling you.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:54.197
We don't want to be there." So I said, "Why have you become guru?

00:36:54.398 --> 00:36:59.103
If you cannot manage them, if you cannot

00:36:59.304 --> 00:37:01.845
get out of the troubles they are giving you

00:37:02.046 --> 00:37:05.931
and out of all those things, and remain in your peace,

00:37:06.132 --> 00:37:08.337
then what's the use of becoming this?"

00:37:08.538 --> 00:37:10.399
He said, "We have had enough of it."

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.149
Some of them were over hundred years of age and all that,

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:17.340
but I said, "What's the use? Your life is of no use,

00:37:17.541 --> 00:37:20.692
you are staying here alone somewhere in the jungles."

00:37:20.893 --> 00:37:25.208
He said, "The tigers, the snakes, all of them know us,

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:28.083
that we are great; they don't trouble us.

00:37:28.284 --> 00:37:30.505
But these human beings are troubling.

00:37:30.706 --> 00:37:34.552
If we go down, they'll trouble us and torture us.

00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:38.161
We don't want to go there because they're very ambitious,

00:37:38.362 --> 00:37:41.684
or they are very negative.

00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:43.989
Something is wrong with the human beings,

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:47.637
none of them have reached a perfect state."

00:37:47.838 --> 00:37:49.988
So that all that, I was surprised

00:37:50.189 --> 00:37:54.910
how they are not at all willing to come down and be with us,

00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:58.316
and be a part and parcel of us.

00:37:58.517 --> 00:38:02.058
So they said, "All right, Mother, You have come. You are a Mother,

00:38:02.259 --> 00:38:06.152
You can tolerate all this and You can work it out, but not me.

00:38:06.353 --> 00:38:08.996
We are out of it, we don't want to go back."

00:38:09.197 --> 00:38:12.637
They have lots of powers. They can control the nature,

00:38:12.838 --> 00:38:14.930
they can do so many things. But they said,

00:38:15.131 --> 00:38:20.145
"Easy to control even a snake than to control a human being.

00:38:20.346 --> 00:38:22.958
Today they might behave in a particular manner,

00:38:23.159 --> 00:38:24.935
suddenly they will become horrible.

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:28.154
You don't know these human beings how uncertain they are,

00:38:28.355 --> 00:38:30.498
what uncertain quantity they are."

00:38:30.699 --> 00:38:34.709
I said, "There is a way of putting them right.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:39.029
You first give them Realization. In the light of their Spirit

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:42.513
they can see how they are doing wrong things.

00:38:42.714 --> 00:38:47.310
Ninety-nine percent people will know what's going wrong with them,

00:38:47.511 --> 00:38:50.318
where are they missing the point.

00:38:50.519 --> 00:38:52.959
They will start seeing themselves.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.154
Spirit is like a mirror where you see yourself clearly,

00:38:57.355 --> 00:38:59.381
and you start changing yourself.

00:38:59.582 --> 00:39:02.889
There's no introspection actually needed then,

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:07.366
when you have your Spirit awakened. You can watch yourself,

00:39:07.567 --> 00:39:10.741
you can see for yourself clearly,

00:39:10.942 --> 00:39:13.780
as soon as

00:39:13.981 --> 00:39:21.093
you become a developed or evolved Sahaja Yogi."

00:39:21.294 --> 00:39:24.984
And that is one point one should see,

00:39:25.185 --> 00:39:27.961
if it has happened to you.

00:39:28.162 --> 00:39:31.609
If you can see something wrong with you,

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:40.126
if you can find out what sort of defects you have,

00:39:40.327 --> 00:39:45.360
if you can detach yourself from those defects,

00:39:45.561 --> 00:39:48.329
and if you can understand

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:52.220
that all these attachments and defects and habits

00:39:52.421 --> 00:39:57.822
are pulling you down, then only you can leave them.

00:39:58.023 --> 00:40:00.330
But that only happens when you have

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:04.885
this mirror of your Self shining through.

00:40:05.086 --> 00:40:08.854
When this light comes to you, you see for yourself

00:40:09.055 --> 00:40:12.542
what is wrong with you,

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:15.089
what is the wrong path you are taking.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:19.589
Overnight you have seen people have given up so many things.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:23.797
Many gross things they give up, but still there are many,

00:40:23.998 --> 00:40:27.688
I should say, subtle things, which stick on to them.

00:40:27.889 --> 00:40:32.079
First thing that happens to you is that you start finding

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:40.069
what's wrong with your own people of your own nation.

00:40:40.358 --> 00:40:44.118
I'm amazed, you see, when the English got Realization,

00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:46.618
they started telling Me about the English.

00:40:46.819 --> 00:40:48.970
When Italians got Realization,

00:40:49.171 --> 00:40:52.439
they started telling Me about the Italians.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.720
If you tell the Italians that "You see, this Italian fellow did this like that,"

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:59.751
he said, "Italians after all, Mother, what will they do?

00:40:59.952 --> 00:41:03.204
They're just like this, You know." He himself is an Italian,

00:41:03.405 --> 00:41:06.713
but immediately he'll say. Same with the Russians, I have seen,

00:41:06.914 --> 00:41:10.791
it's very surprising that they start telling you

00:41:10.992 --> 00:41:14.721
about what's wrong with the Russians or with the Ukrainians,

00:41:14.922 --> 00:41:18.348
all of them are quite alike. Even Indians, they'll say,

00:41:18.549 --> 00:41:21.996
"After all this is Indian. You know Indian people how they are,

00:41:22.197 --> 00:41:26.141
Mother; they are doing like this." I was surprised that

00:41:26.345 --> 00:41:27.597
they themselves being Indians,

00:41:27.798 --> 00:41:31.441
how are they immediately telling Me about the Indians?

00:41:31.642 --> 00:41:35.207
And many things I have come to know about these countries

00:41:35.408 --> 00:41:38.637
through the, actually through the Sahaja Yogis only.

00:41:38.838 --> 00:41:41.890
When the Sahaja Yogis tell Me, I'm amazed

00:41:42.091 --> 00:41:44.687
that they are not identified with their country,

00:41:44.888 --> 00:41:46.968
they are not identified with anyone,

00:41:47.169 --> 00:41:49.812
even their own family they are not identified with.

00:41:50.013 --> 00:41:52.281
If they find something wrong, they'll tell Me,

00:41:52.482 --> 00:41:56.484
"Mother, my father is like that, my mother is like that."

00:41:56.685 --> 00:41:58.773
That is how you get detached,

00:41:58.974 --> 00:42:01.773
when you start seeing and not identified.

00:42:01.974 --> 00:42:05.687
If you are not identified with all these things,

00:42:05.888 --> 00:42:10.648
then you become a free person, you have the freedom.

00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:14.695
You become a person who is not attached to anyone

00:42:14.896 --> 00:42:19.226
because he's your father or she's your mother,

00:42:19.427 --> 00:42:21.632
or a sister or anyone.

00:42:21.833 --> 00:42:26.257
This attachment is a very dangerous one also.

00:42:26.458 --> 00:42:30.991
With the family attachment, we have lost many Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:31.192 --> 00:42:34.171
Because their family was funny, they got lost;

00:42:34.372 --> 00:42:36.116
they couldn't get out of it.

00:42:36.317 --> 00:42:40.679
We don't say that you detach yourself from family or get out of it,

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.515
but in a subtle way you should understand what are they up to,

00:42:44.716 --> 00:42:49.003
and what they are doing. All these subtle understanding

00:42:49.204 --> 00:42:54.433
about everyone doesn't give you any right also to criticize them.

00:42:54.634 --> 00:42:58.246
You should see for yourself what's wrong with you.

00:42:58.447 --> 00:43:00.768
You know all these subtleties you criticize,

00:43:00.969 --> 00:43:03.588
that such a person is such, such a person is such,

00:43:03.789 --> 00:43:07.791
but you also have the same problems with you.

00:43:07.992 --> 00:43:12.713
That's why you get detachment only possibly,

00:43:12.914 --> 00:43:17.776
through this introspection through the mirror of your Spirit.

00:43:17.977 --> 00:43:22.846
So the spiritual life is very important to a person

00:43:23.047 --> 00:43:26.362
than anything else on this earth,

00:43:26.563 --> 00:43:29.253
because such a person has been seeking,

00:43:29.454 --> 00:43:33.472
he has been seeking the truth, he has been seeking the reality.

00:43:33.673 --> 00:43:37.395
And once you know the reality, you don't want to cling onto

00:43:37.596 --> 00:43:39.676
something which is not reality.

00:43:39.877 --> 00:43:45.434
You want to be a person who is above all these things,

00:43:45.635 --> 00:43:47.411
that you can see all these things.

00:43:47.612 --> 00:43:49.692
And that is how you can save others

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:56.762
who are getting drowned into the ocean of darkness,

00:43:56.963 --> 00:44:01.075
into the ocean of misidentification,

00:44:01.276 --> 00:44:04.005
only when you are above these things.

00:44:04.206 --> 00:44:09.192
But mostly what happens is this, that you are identified,

00:44:09.393 --> 00:44:13.574
you are identified, "How can I do it? How can I say?"

00:44:13.775 --> 00:44:16.879
The countries where Sahaja Yoga has spread,

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.231
where there have been people who are not identified with those countries,

00:44:21.432 --> 00:44:24.051
and think that they have to help

00:44:24.252 --> 00:44:28.723
all these countrymen to come up, to join them.

00:44:28.924 --> 00:44:34.075
For that, tremendous patience and love is necessary.

00:44:34.276 --> 00:44:37.859
As you know this cosmic power, as they call it,

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:42.742
which they say I'm the source: actually, it is the power of love,

00:44:42.943 --> 00:44:46.422
of divine love, of pure love.

00:44:46.623 --> 00:44:51.172
And such a love doesn't demand anything, doesn't want anything,

00:44:51.373 --> 00:44:53.891
but it acts, it works.

00:44:54.092 --> 00:44:57.227
For example, if you love somebody, you would not like to do

00:44:57.428 --> 00:45:01.165
something to displease that person.

00:45:01.366 --> 00:45:03.353
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis

00:45:03.554 --> 00:45:07.361
who do things which I really don't like,

00:45:07.562 --> 00:45:11.486
but I never show, I just keep quiet.

00:45:11.687 --> 00:45:15.392
But normally if a person has love for someone,

00:45:15.593 --> 00:45:18.962
he wouldn't do anything to displease

00:45:19.163 --> 00:45:23.579
or to trouble that person, or in any way hurt.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.431
Without that development within you,

00:45:26.632 --> 00:45:29.954
you cannot become collective.

00:45:30.155 --> 00:45:35.360
In collectivity what happens that you feel for others,

00:45:35.561 --> 00:45:38.423
you understand others. You may not show off,

00:45:38.624 --> 00:45:41.275
but you do, inside yourself you know.

00:45:41.476 --> 00:45:44.564
Supposing somebody has done lots of funny things with you,

00:45:44.765 --> 00:45:49.611
doesn't matter. But gradually you will see he will change,

00:45:49.812 --> 00:45:54.127
gradually he will become better, because he'll realize that

00:45:54.328 --> 00:45:59.088
whatever he has been doing has not been a correct thing to do.

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:03.104
He will not only feel guilty, that's not the way, but he will say,

00:46:03.305 --> 00:46:07.354
"I should correct. Why did I do like this? I should not have done."

00:46:07.555 --> 00:46:11.190
Gradually he will improve, but for that you should have

00:46:11.391 --> 00:46:14.799
a great sense of forgiveness,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.651
great sense of understanding.

00:46:17.852 --> 00:46:21.159
Under circumstances, people also misbehave.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.136
Because they've had no training how to be all right,

00:46:25.337 --> 00:46:27.784
how to be humble, they misbehave.

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:32.667
Because in their culture perhaps, there is nothing but just anger,

00:46:32.868 --> 00:46:35.347
and arrogance is regarded as something great,

00:46:35.548 --> 00:46:39.277
also they misbehave. Sometimes they come from such families

00:46:39.478 --> 00:46:43.824
where only arrogance is taught, so you can't help it.

00:46:44.025 --> 00:46:48.043
Such people are to be forgiven again and again,

00:46:48.244 --> 00:46:50.215
and see that they change.

00:46:50.416 --> 00:46:55.363
Because I have a faith that all human beings

00:46:55.564 --> 00:46:59.566
can be made into beautiful flowers of fragrance -

00:46:59.767 --> 00:47:05.074
all the human beings. But I know there are some difficult ones.

00:47:05.275 --> 00:47:08.795
Why? Because they don't want. If they don't want,

00:47:08.996 --> 00:47:12.584
if they don't have the pure desire, you cannot force it on them.

00:47:12.785 --> 00:47:17.272
So forget it, they are difficult people, forget about them.

00:47:17.473 --> 00:47:24.639
But those who want, those who have a great desire

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.772
which is absolutely pure desire -

00:47:27.973 --> 00:47:32.756
not for money, not for position, not for anything else,

00:47:32.957 --> 00:47:39.053
but for achieving a great state of spirituality -

00:47:39.254 --> 00:47:42.850
such people are to be helped at any cost.

00:47:43.051 --> 00:47:47.202
I know some of them have gone to very wrong gurus and they have suffered;

00:47:47.403 --> 00:47:50.522
they have a bad Agnya, they have all kinds of things.

00:47:50.723 --> 00:47:53.631
Doesn't matter, you should try to help them.

00:47:53.832 --> 00:47:56.300
If they can listen to you, if they can understand

00:47:56.501 --> 00:47:59.894
what you are telling them, I'm sure it will work out.

00:48:00.095 --> 00:48:03.113
It is worked out so much, as you can see now

00:48:03.314 --> 00:48:07.840
that in the foreign countries where I was just an Indian,

00:48:08.041 --> 00:48:12.176
how people have taken to it; how they have understood Me,

00:48:12.377 --> 00:48:15.067
and how they have become Sahaja Yogis

00:48:15.268 --> 00:48:17.801
of such a great value and level.

00:48:18.002 --> 00:48:22.121
We never had so many saints in the olden days, never.

00:48:22.322 --> 00:48:26.949
Only one saint would be born and he would be tortured.

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.551
There were not so many to help each other

00:48:29.752 --> 00:48:31.809
and to protect each other.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:35.809
So collectivity is to be learned very well:

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:40.067
how to be collective, how to be nice to each other;

00:48:40.268 --> 00:48:43.231
because later on when you become the guru,

00:48:43.432 --> 00:48:47.770
when you have to guide the people,

00:48:47.971 --> 00:48:51.145
you will know what are the problems of the collectivity are.

00:48:51.346 --> 00:48:55.692
Also you will know how to overcome that,

00:48:55.893 --> 00:48:59.161
how to make collectivity perfect.

00:48:59.362 --> 00:49:03.145
And once you learn that thing, you'll be amazed

00:49:03.346 --> 00:49:08.887
that you have mastered the art of being a guru.

00:49:09.088 --> 00:49:14.184
I would like to see so many of you becoming a real guru,

00:49:14.385 --> 00:49:19.684
real masters; not only in your jobs, in your talents,

00:49:19.885 --> 00:49:24.223
but in your own life.

00:49:24.424 --> 00:49:28.848
People should say that such and such person is a real guru.

00:49:29.049 --> 00:49:33.098
For that, as I said, you must learn obedience,

00:49:33.299 --> 00:49:37.731
complete obedience. You should not question the guru.

00:49:37.932 --> 00:49:39.497
Whatever is told to you, you must do;

00:49:39.698 --> 00:49:41.880
though in Sahaja Yoga I do not say that.

00:49:42.081 --> 00:49:44.130
Today is the first time I am saying it,

00:49:44.331 --> 00:49:47.333
because I find so many of you

00:49:47.534 --> 00:49:50.903
fall a little short of becoming perfect.

00:49:51.104 --> 00:49:53.942
You don't have to sacrifice anything, I have told you,

00:49:54.143 --> 00:49:56.426
you don't have to give up anything.

00:49:56.627 --> 00:50:00.114
You don't have to give up your families or anything,

00:50:00.315 --> 00:50:04.208
and do odd things just to show that you are perfect.

00:50:04.409 --> 00:50:06.622
But it's something, a state within yourself

00:50:06.823 --> 00:50:10.825
which you have to establish, where you become extremely humble,

00:50:11.026 --> 00:50:15.567
obedient, and you'll be glowing with this light, I am sure.

00:50:15.768 --> 00:50:20.606
Once you understand the importance, then

00:50:20.807 --> 00:50:24.119
you will dedicate yourself to become

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.932
a personality of a real quality.

00:50:28.133 --> 00:50:30.760
It's very difficult, as people something say,

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:33.127
but I think the easiest thing to be,

00:50:33.328 --> 00:50:38.205
because that's the most comfortable way of living in life -

00:50:38.406 --> 00:50:42.596
no use fighting, no use quarreling, nobody trying to show off,

00:50:42.797 --> 00:50:47.487
and all that. The care of everyone,

00:50:47.688 --> 00:50:50.237
the suggestion of care,

00:50:50.438 --> 00:50:55.385
is very much satisfying for others.

00:50:55.586 --> 00:50:58.580
A little care here and there, people like it.

00:50:58.781 --> 00:51:02.072
And that only comes from a very noble soul

00:51:02.273 --> 00:51:04.955
who bothers about small, small things,

00:51:05.156 --> 00:51:09.697
about whatever others need. It's not for your own advancement,

00:51:09.898 --> 00:51:14.752
it's not for your own sort of leadership, whatever you may call,

00:51:14.953 --> 00:51:20.119
or for your own positions - then you are falling short -

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:23.377
but it's for your own ascent,

00:51:23.578 --> 00:51:30.057
for your higher life that you give up

00:51:30.258 --> 00:51:35.807
all these ideas of leadership and this and that.

00:51:36.008 --> 00:51:41.916
Is absurd the way sometimes I find some Sahaja Yogis

00:51:42.117 --> 00:51:50.159
are so anxious to assert themselves as leaders; it's not correct.

00:51:50.612 --> 00:51:53.567
So many times I have explained to you

00:51:53.768 --> 00:51:58.413
that your own development, your own correction,

00:51:58.614 --> 00:52:05.749
your own position in Sahaja Yoga will say what you are.

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:07.921
Whatever others may say doesn't matter.

00:52:08.122 --> 00:52:13.132
What you say about yourself truly, truthfully, is the reality,

00:52:13.333 --> 00:52:15.780
and you must face yourself all the time.

00:52:15.981 --> 00:52:18.132
I would say, specially for the ladies,

00:52:18.333 --> 00:52:23.960
that I'm a woman and I have worked very hard all these years,

00:52:24.161 --> 00:52:31.155
and as a woman I must tell you that all the ladies should try;

00:52:31.356 --> 00:52:34.991
because they always say "We are shaktis,"

00:52:35.192 --> 00:52:38.952
but in their life I don't see there's any work done as shaktis,

00:52:39.153 --> 00:52:43.546
only their sort of dependence all the time on Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:43.747 --> 00:52:46.804
They have to stand up in their own freedom,

00:52:47.005 --> 00:52:48.452
they have to be independent,

00:52:48.653 --> 00:52:53.077
and they should have right ideas about everything.

00:52:53.278 --> 00:52:56.382
I'm sure if the ladies come up that way,

00:52:56.583 --> 00:52:59.609
Sahaja Yoga will spread very much.

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:03.453
Men are working much more for Sahaja Yoga than women are.

00:53:03.654 --> 00:53:05.758
I can understand because they have families,

00:53:05.959 --> 00:53:08.071
they have children, this thing.

00:53:08.272 --> 00:53:10.235
But the most important thing is that

00:53:10.436 --> 00:53:13.626
once you take to active Sahaja Yoga,

00:53:13.827 --> 00:53:15.915
then your children also come up well,

00:53:16.116 --> 00:53:18.056
the family is also looked after.

00:53:18.257 --> 00:53:23.994
After all, there is this divine power which looks after all of you.

00:53:24.195 --> 00:53:28.478
You must believe that this pure divine power thinks,

00:53:28.679 --> 00:53:34.712
understands, it organizes; above all, it loves you.

00:53:34.913 --> 00:53:38.868
This divine power has to be understood that

00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:42.891
it is now your own

00:53:43.092 --> 00:53:46.211
and that you are in the realm of this divine power,

00:53:46.412 --> 00:53:49.531
where you won't have any problems whatsoever.

00:53:49.732 --> 00:53:54.742
If you leave things to the divine power, it will all work out.

00:53:54.943 --> 00:53:58.492
As you know about this scientist who found out about Me.

00:53:58.693 --> 00:54:03.242
I have to just say that he asked Me that

00:54:03.443 --> 00:54:08.133
"How is it this so many hearts are made here?"

00:54:08.334 --> 00:54:11.071
I said, "It's people who are singing the song,

00:54:11.272 --> 00:54:13.462
'Sitting in the Heart of the Universe.'

00:54:13.663 --> 00:54:16.243
So this many hearts have come up."

00:54:16.444 --> 00:54:20.470
But he said, "Still, does this power hear?"

00:54:20.671 --> 00:54:25.345
I said, "No, it's Me only, I can hear.

00:54:25.546 --> 00:54:31.728
I was hearing the song, and then the power organizes everything."

00:54:31.929 --> 00:54:34.345
It's something to be understood very well

00:54:34.546 --> 00:54:40.470
that the power within you, what you have, understands,

00:54:40.671 --> 00:54:43.634
and understand you also.

00:54:43.835 --> 00:54:49.103
It is a way of power which is your own power,

00:54:49.304 --> 00:54:53.195
but you cannot control it.

00:54:53.406 --> 00:54:57.079
It knows about you. Whenever you are falling,

00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.392
when you are doing wrong, the same power which protects you

00:55:00.593 --> 00:55:02.533
and loves you like a mother,

00:55:02.734 --> 00:55:07.009
will correct you and bring you to the right path.

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:10.970
I think now a new century is starting

00:55:11.171 --> 00:55:13.228
and so many things have to happen,

00:55:13.429 --> 00:55:17.837
and all of you must decide that you'll do this or that.

00:55:18.038 --> 00:55:24.056
Whatever is your understanding is about spreading Sahaja Yoga,

00:55:24.257 --> 00:55:28.142
you should try to; all of you should put your mind to it.

00:55:28.343 --> 00:55:32.228
If women can't go out they can write down something,

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:36.400
they can write about their spiritual ascent

00:55:36.601 --> 00:55:41.416
or about whatever their experiences are.

00:55:41.617 --> 00:55:44.509
So in any case all those who have got also

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:48.587
very miraculous photographs, they should send it over here.

00:55:48.788 --> 00:55:52.509
Very important is, because this gentleman is coming here in September,

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:55.001
and he's going to analyze all of them.

00:55:55.202 --> 00:55:57.790
So it would be very nice of you if you can send it.

00:55:57.991 --> 00:56:03.757
Also you write down about your different experiences

00:56:03.958 --> 00:56:07.530
you have had in Sahaja Yoga: that would be also a good idea.

00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:11.358
He told Me that he would like to publish a book like that;

00:56:11.559 --> 00:56:14.803
and now the time has come for us to publish

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:18.084
our miracles that have taken place.

00:56:18.285 --> 00:56:21.240
All of you have had some experience of the miracle.

00:56:21.441 --> 00:56:25.185
So I have to request you to send you, as soon as possible,

00:56:25.386 --> 00:56:30.216
written well in English language or in Hindi language or Marathi,

00:56:30.417 --> 00:56:32.997
because I don't understand other languages.

00:56:33.198 --> 00:56:35.185
And please don't send Me in other languages,

00:56:35.386 --> 00:56:38.833
we'll have to appoint somebody to translate them in fourteen languages,

00:56:39.034 --> 00:56:43.396
it's a difficult thing. So I would request you to send that.

00:56:43.597 --> 00:56:46.888
I am sure today's lecture, you will again go through it

00:56:47.089 --> 00:56:49.872
and understand it, and work it out.

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:54.776
May God bless you.
