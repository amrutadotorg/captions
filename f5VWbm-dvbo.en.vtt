WEBVTT

00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:23.207
I am so very filled with joy

00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:32.943
and My heart is so full of gratitude for

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.657
all the Sahaja Yogis who have been able

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.836
to create this beautiful place.

00:00:44.513 --> 00:00:52.190
I cannot imagine how much they must have worked hard

00:00:52.574 --> 00:01:01.364
in such a place to create such  a beautiful

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:09.350
area, such a blissful place.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:25.018
How in Sahaja Yoga people work together

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.208
with tremendous respect and love for each other,

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.397
and produce something that is unbelievable.

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:42.955
This was just a wilderness,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.308
and you have brought so much of

00:01:48.768 --> 00:01:52.815
life and light in this place.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.323
You wanted to celebrate My birthday.

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:12.751
I don't know what is such a significant about it.

00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:21.220
But the way you have really shown

00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:26.101
your understanding and respect, I am just enamored.

00:02:26.302 --> 00:02:32.130
I can't understand what have I done for you,

00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:36.450
that you should do so much for Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:39.814 --> 00:02:45.068
As it is, today is also a very auspicious day

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.146
which we call as the Holi.

00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:52.152
They play Holi on this day

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.887
and show their love and oneness among themselves.

00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:06.099
This is the time when we have to really understand

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.355
the value of love,

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:15.014
of respect of others,

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:19.008
because so far we have based

00:03:19.227 --> 00:03:24.459
all our theories and all our ideas

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.495
on the principle that human beings cannot love each other.

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:35.587
They are always trying to overpower others

00:03:35.788 --> 00:03:37.579
or to hate others,

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:40.857
or to grab things from others.

00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:44.877
Such a wrong idea we had all these days,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.152
and that's why all the organizations that were created

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:50.912
to obstruct it

00:03:51.113 --> 00:03:54.744
also got contaminated with it.

00:03:57.813 --> 00:04:05.412
The only way one can really understand what we are

00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:08.508
is by knowing yourself.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:12.111
When you know yourself you are surprised

00:04:12.312 --> 00:04:15.919
that what is the greatest thing for you

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.300
is to love and to be loved.

00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:23.526
You enjoy that collective love so much

00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:29.970
when you are absolutely overcome

00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:33.952
your baser self.

00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:37.006
In Sahaja Yoga it is so simple.

00:04:37.207 --> 00:04:39.603
It works in a very simple manner.

00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:41.790
It's very Sahaja!

00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:48.283
But to grow into it is very important,

00:04:48.484 --> 00:04:52.105
and I am so very happy to see so many of you

00:04:52.322 --> 00:04:54.212
from all over the world,

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:58.527
from Delhi and also from all over India,

00:04:58.728 --> 00:05:01.676
enjoying that love among yourselves

00:05:01.877 --> 00:05:05.894
and understanding among yourselves.

00:05:07.594 --> 00:05:11.082
I never expected that in My lifetime

00:05:11.283 --> 00:05:16.379
I'll be able to see all this beautiful world of love,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.874
trust and peace.

00:05:19.075 --> 00:05:21.909
But today really I must say,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.634
it shows what we are capable of doing.

00:05:28.374 --> 00:05:34.837
We human beings, so-called, are very selfish,

00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:36.759
self-centered

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.645
and only worried about ourselves.

00:05:40.846 --> 00:05:42.692
That is what is said!

00:05:42.893 --> 00:05:48.166
but it's surprising that with Self-Realization,

00:05:48.367 --> 00:05:52.415
with self-knowledge, with knowing yourself,

00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:55.801
you understand how rich you are within,

00:05:56.002 --> 00:05:57.876
how great you are within

00:05:58.077 --> 00:06:00.894
and how capable you are.

00:06:01.202 --> 00:06:03.748
This understanding comes to you,

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:09.397
and then that is expressed in such a beautiful manner.

00:06:10.327 --> 00:06:16.046
Sahaja Yoga took time to grow, slowly and slowly,

00:06:16.247 --> 00:06:23.413
and that you all have slowly and slowly grown also.

00:06:23.614 --> 00:06:29.417
But today I must say that it has reached such a height

00:06:29.618 --> 00:06:35.540
that it's difficult for people to get out of it.

00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:38.134
When you know yourself,

00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:40.748
when you know what is reality

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.354
and what is absolute truth,

00:06:43.555 --> 00:06:47.999
you just get dissolved into that knowledge.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.973
Of course you are not knowledgeable in the way people are;

00:06:56.174 --> 00:07:00.289
you are knowledgeable in the real sense of the word,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:07.555
because you realize what is within you is a big power of love.

00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:10.487
There's a big power of understanding.

00:07:10.683 --> 00:07:12.906
(Can you bring Me some water?) - Hindi

00:07:13.107 --> 00:07:14.438
All right.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.868
There's a big power of understanding,

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:22.417
a big power of oneness, of collective.

00:07:22.618 --> 00:07:25.909
This collectivity works wonders

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.250
and gives such joy that we are all one,

00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:35.675
we have no enemies, we have no problems.

00:07:35.876 --> 00:07:39.748
We are all one together.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.293
It goes on faling this.

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:51.190
It's better.

00:07:51.391 --> 00:07:55.234
Yes, that's the way it should... It's too high.

00:07:55.904 --> 00:07:58.068
It's all right.

00:08:08.885 --> 00:08:15.027
This joy that was expressed by you

00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:23.814
is like the waves that go to the shores,

00:08:24.015 --> 00:08:28.829
touch the shores and come back, creating beautiful patterns.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.729
And I see that happening now,

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:37.490
that these beautiful patterns are showing in your own life,

00:08:37.713 --> 00:08:40.873
in your lifestyle, in your behavior.

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:47.499
There is a very special type of human race is sitting before Me.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:57.705
I am so much thankful to you, absolutely,

00:08:57.906 --> 00:09:06.810
that you should take to this simple knowledge of yourself

00:09:07.224 --> 00:09:10.056
and enjoy it with others.

00:09:10.257 --> 00:09:16.606
It's something remarkable that you know about yourself,

00:09:16.807 --> 00:09:19.696
that's only human beings can do.

00:09:19.897 --> 00:09:23.103
There can be a diamond, very expensive,

00:09:23.304 --> 00:09:25.608
but it doesn't know its value.

00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:30.260
There could be some dog or some animal

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:33.622
which must be something par excellence,

00:09:33.813 --> 00:09:36.631
but he doesn't know what he is.

00:09:36.832 --> 00:09:40.705
Same thing happens with the human beings

00:09:40.906 --> 00:09:43.484
till they get their Self-Realization.

00:09:43.685 --> 00:09:45.703
And after Realization,

00:09:45.922 --> 00:09:50.968
they suddenly become aware of what they are.

00:09:51.777 --> 00:09:55.646
And then suddenly they become very humble,

00:09:55.847 --> 00:09:57.812
they become very loving.

00:09:58.013 --> 00:10:01.520
Now supposing if somebody knows that he is a king,

00:10:01.719 --> 00:10:07.239
or he discovers that he is a some great musician

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.274
or a prime minister or something.

00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:13.859
He feels very aloof

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.100
and he thinks no end of himself.

00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:21.380
But by this knowledge that you have,

00:10:21.555 --> 00:10:26.740
you become one with the rest of Sahaja Yogis and enjoy it.

00:10:26.973 --> 00:10:30.838
It's very remarkable how it works out

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:34.470
that you enjoy each other so much.

00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:39.357
And to do something for this collective work,

00:10:39.548 --> 00:10:43.495
you can dedicate yourself to it.

00:10:44.682 --> 00:10:50.501
Now My experience of seventy-seven years, as you can say,

00:10:50.702 --> 00:10:54.941
has been really checkered with all kinds of incidents,

00:10:55.142 --> 00:11:00.193
all kinds of people, all kinds of incidents.

00:11:00.394 --> 00:11:07.108
And it's a good vision to see before your eyes

00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:13.071
that despite all that, so many beautiful lotuses have come out,

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:18.487
and they are so fragrant, so beautiful,

00:11:18.688 --> 00:11:22.212
so colorful, so attractive.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:30.810
All this is because we have an innate value system,

00:11:32.154 --> 00:11:36.038
because we have inborn within us

00:11:36.239 --> 00:11:43.877
a great sense of love and compassion.

00:11:44.302 --> 00:11:52.832
This compassion has to be really understood and enjoyed,

00:11:53.033 --> 00:11:57.159
and jump in the ocean of compassion.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.094
So beautiful, and you'll be amazed to see

00:12:01.295 --> 00:12:04.334
that automatically you'll swim,

00:12:04.535 --> 00:12:09.597
automatically you'll meet other people also in the same ocean,

00:12:09.798 --> 00:12:13.610
and without any problems, without any troubles,

00:12:13.785 --> 00:12:17.486
all enjoying the bliss of this love,

00:12:17.687 --> 00:12:21.109
this compassion, this Divine love.

00:12:23.669 --> 00:12:27.730
I must really congratulate

00:12:27.976 --> 00:12:33.697
the Delhi people for coming up so well

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:37.729
with this beautiful arrangement

00:12:37.941 --> 00:12:40.420
and this beautiful pendal,

00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:44.444
and all the beautiful arrangements they have made outside

00:12:44.645 --> 00:12:46.175
for your stay.

00:12:46.376 --> 00:12:49.433
I mean really it's something,

00:12:49.634 --> 00:12:54.556
I have done nothing for it, nothing, I should say.

00:12:54.757 --> 00:12:58.035
How these people have worked together:

00:12:58.269 --> 00:13:01.390
there have been no quarrels, fighting,

00:13:01.591 --> 00:13:03.965
backbiting, nothing of the kind.

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:05.787
It's very surprising

00:13:05.988 --> 00:13:09.726
that such a beautiful thing has been created by them;

00:13:09.927 --> 00:13:14.492
shows their maturity in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:17.675
I must congratulate them again and again

00:13:17.876 --> 00:13:20.717
for doing this great work

00:13:20.918 --> 00:13:24.125
in such a short time.

00:13:24.326 --> 00:13:26.482
First I talked in English

00:13:26.683 --> 00:13:29.707
because many people have come here from foreign countries.

00:13:29.908 --> 00:13:31.985
And you don't have any objection

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:34.955
that we talk in English for a little while.

00:13:35.156 --> 00:13:39.696
This is an amazing feat by people of Delhi,

00:13:39.887 --> 00:13:46.140
to whom people of Uttar Pradesh joined,

00:13:46.397 --> 00:13:49.450
people from Rajasthan also joined,

00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:53.048
and people from Haryana also helped -

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:56.277
and together they made with love

00:13:56.478 --> 00:14:00.759
this very beautiful pandal like a temple.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.338
I, Myself, was surprised seeing it

00:14:07.032 --> 00:14:10.472
that there are such talented artists here.

00:14:10.673 --> 00:14:12.506
I didn't know.

00:14:12.707 --> 00:14:15.246
Where did this art come from?

00:14:15.447 --> 00:14:21.232
I can't understand how they made and decorated all this.

00:14:21.433 --> 00:14:27.758
I didn't know that there are such talented artists in our country

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:30.378
and that too, talent of love.

00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:35.178
The power of love, the art of love

00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:38.529
and the art of loving everybody,

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.972
whosoever gets it, only he can do such an artistic composition.

00:14:44.173 --> 00:14:46.484
One should learn this art

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:54.511
that how with the help of our speech, heart and mind

00:14:54.712 --> 00:14:59.272
we can become artists, artists of love

00:14:59.473 --> 00:15:04.620
and how we can make others happy by our words,

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.568
and spread joy among them.

00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:11.476
What kind of loving things can we say?

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:13.907
This is the aspect of speech.

00:15:14.108 --> 00:15:18.390
Then with our mind we can think,

00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:23.316
how we can shower our love among people,

00:15:23.517 --> 00:15:30.137
how we can open our heart in front of others

00:15:30.338 --> 00:15:34.610
and establish them in our heart.

00:15:35.546 --> 00:15:38.839
And for heart aspect,

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.388
if a person doesn't have love in his heart

00:15:41.589 --> 00:15:45.328
he does not deserve anything in the world;

00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:48.028
because whatever he gets,

00:15:48.229 --> 00:15:52.376
he cannot be satisfied in any way,

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.668
he cannot be content.

00:15:54.869 --> 00:16:00.716
But when there is an ocean of contentment within you

00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:05.851
then is there anything that cannot satisfy you?

00:16:06.068 --> 00:16:09.642
When it happens within you

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.916
and the peace of contentment establishes within you,

00:16:13.117 --> 00:16:19.251
then, nobody can understand the boundaries of that contentment,

00:16:19.452 --> 00:16:24.049
then nobody can understand this business of contenment.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:29.609
All that happens in so sweet and beautiful

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.233
that it is a real spectacle.

00:16:32.434 --> 00:16:37.620
One can't understand what he is doing and what others are doing,

00:16:37.821 --> 00:16:40.648
what they are saying and what he is saying,

00:16:40.849 --> 00:16:46.259
and how are they covering him with their love,

00:16:46.284 --> 00:16:54.037
and how shall he shower his love on them.

00:16:54.238 --> 00:16:56.746
Day and night all he worries about is

00:16:56.913 --> 00:17:00.132
that: "Today, whom I have to meet

00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:03.543
and what loving things should I tell them,

00:17:03.744 --> 00:17:07.208
what can I tell them for their benevolence".

00:17:07.409 --> 00:17:11.954
Because the practice of talking about useless things

00:17:12.155 --> 00:17:14.002
leads only to loss.

00:17:14.203 --> 00:17:15.908
It has never been beneficial

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:21.643
and afterwards the anger that comes in a human being

00:17:21.844 --> 00:17:24.700
leads to even more harm.

00:17:24.901 --> 00:17:29.830
Then there is no need to teach one not to be violent,

00:17:30.031 --> 00:17:34.298
not to treat anyone badly,

00:17:34.499 --> 00:17:36.464
not to destroy anyone,

00:17:36.665 --> 00:17:38.425
and not to cheat anybody for money.

00:17:38.626 --> 00:17:40.539
There is no need to teach all this.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.486
You became so beautiful on your own.

00:17:44.687 --> 00:17:48.255
I said that you have become lotuses yourselves,

00:17:48.456 --> 00:17:52.010
that you only know to spread your fragrance

00:17:52.211 --> 00:17:53.822
and nothing else.

00:17:54.023 --> 00:17:57.664
And the joy of giving to others -

00:17:57.865 --> 00:18:03.162
to feel that joy is an unique experience.

00:18:03.378 --> 00:18:08.070
Only people with a novel personality can do it.

00:18:08.271 --> 00:18:12.168
Now you are the masters of it

00:18:12.369 --> 00:18:18.169
and the heritage that you had,

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.226
you have utilized it fully.

00:18:21.427 --> 00:18:23.528
Now that thing is open to everyone,

00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:25.195
it spread everywhere,

00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:28.181
and now it is about enjoying it.

00:18:28.382 --> 00:18:32.800
There are many different type of people in the world,

00:18:33.003 --> 00:18:35.679
but they cannot touch you,

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.268
cannot bother you.

00:18:38.469 --> 00:18:41.074
If at all something happens,

00:18:41.278 --> 00:18:43.677
then it will be that they become one among you

00:18:43.878 --> 00:18:45.449
and they would turn in your favour.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.458
After seeing your life,

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:54.086
they will at least be inclined to change themselves,

00:18:54.287 --> 00:18:56.148
they will think: "Let us also change".

00:18:56.349 --> 00:18:57.976
I don't say that

00:18:58.177 --> 00:19:01.964
I have taken the responsibility of changing this whole world

00:19:02.165 --> 00:19:05.556
but you can take this responsibility.

00:19:05.757 --> 00:19:08.159
If you change this world,

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:14.506
if you create virtuous and saintly people,

00:19:14.707 --> 00:19:20.384
then after that there is no need to do anything else.

00:19:20.553 --> 00:19:24.273
Then you just witness and enjoy it.

00:19:24.474 --> 00:19:26.394
The only important thing is

00:19:26.595 --> 00:19:31.562
that you get fully involved into it, start working it out

00:19:31.763 --> 00:19:35.103
and see how many people you can transform.

00:19:35.304 --> 00:19:39.651
It is agreed that an ordinary human being has got a number of flaws.

00:19:39.852 --> 00:19:44.841
Such human being who is full of flaws

00:19:45.042 --> 00:19:53.267
can be beautifully introduced to his great unknown Self.

00:19:53.468 --> 00:19:57.189
The Self that is within you, the Atma that is within you -

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:02.209
when you get introduced to it,

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:06.116
then you realize that others must do the same.

00:20:06.317 --> 00:20:07.786
They should also know themselves.

00:20:07.987 --> 00:20:09.349
They are lost.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:14.155
They don't know what a treasure they have inside.

00:20:14.356 --> 00:20:16.633
So, this (Realization) must be given,

00:20:16.834 --> 00:20:19.606
and they must get it.

00:20:19.807 --> 00:20:23.116
When such discussions begin,

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:26.302
you will take this responsibility on yourself

00:20:26.503 --> 00:20:31.106
that, "We should give others this treasure, too".

00:20:31.307 --> 00:20:33.758
You have the key to their treasure,

00:20:33.945 --> 00:20:41.034
and if somehow you give this great gift to them,

00:20:41.235 --> 00:20:46.141
then you will see how they are going to recognize you

00:20:46.342 --> 00:20:49.837
and how they will be grateful to you.

00:20:50.038 --> 00:20:52.714
The greatest work for you now

00:20:52.915 --> 00:20:57.846
is to bring as many people as you can to that Sahaja state,

00:20:58.047 --> 00:20:59.733
and give them this treasure.

00:20:59.934 --> 00:21:02.343
And when this will happen,

00:21:02.544 --> 00:21:06.965
you will yourself get fully immersed in it and happy

00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:11.245
and you will get a kind of joy,

00:21:11.472 --> 00:21:15.884
which cannot be described.

00:21:16.085 --> 00:21:17.834
This has to be done.

00:21:18.035 --> 00:21:21.272
Today you have celebrated My birthday,

00:21:21.473 --> 00:21:26.792
I am very thankful for that.

00:21:26.993 --> 00:21:29.795
And you have done all this so happily.

00:21:30.003 --> 00:21:31.847
For Me the important thing is

00:21:32.058 --> 00:21:36.850
that every year Sahaja Yoga spread widely

00:21:37.051 --> 00:21:41.999
and even I cannot fathom its boundaries now.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.292
But, today, you must also take a vow,

00:21:46.477 --> 00:21:49.275
on your Mother's birthday,

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:54.394
that, "We will all try to transform others".

00:21:54.595 --> 00:21:56.566
We have already got transformed,

00:21:56.738 --> 00:21:58.943
but we should transform others as well.

00:21:59.144 --> 00:22:04.769
Only this will give you the completeness of this joy.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.408
Till now, the joy you have had is limited,

00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:09.815
but when you will spread it among others,

00:22:10.016 --> 00:22:12.477
and when it will resonate in others -

00:22:12.678 --> 00:22:20.589
having this experience and understanding it,

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:28.597
then a great new joy will awaken within you.

00:22:28.798 --> 00:22:34.269
I was watching how young boys and children

00:22:34.481 --> 00:22:38.357
were dancing so joyfully.

00:22:38.558 --> 00:22:41.560
Shri Krishna started this Holi celebration

00:22:41.761 --> 00:22:44.007
so that everybody would get a state of joy.

00:22:44.208 --> 00:22:49.689
Shri Rama's style made human beings very serious type.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.197
Their life became serious.

00:22:52.398 --> 00:22:54.703
He (Shri Krishna) devised a method

00:22:54.904 --> 00:22:58.528
so that human beings break out of their shell and play mirthfully.

00:22:58.747 --> 00:23:05.600
And only Sahaja Yogis can celebrate it (Holi) in a proper way

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.702
with love amongst themselves.

00:23:07.903 --> 00:23:11.035
They do not celebrate to trouble others

00:23:11.243 --> 00:23:14.198
but to express their own joy

00:23:14.403 --> 00:23:18.337
and to make others feel joyous as well.

00:23:18.553 --> 00:23:22.343
Eternal blessings to everyone.
