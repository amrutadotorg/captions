WEBVTT

00:00.079 --> 00:05.260
Nations land, where Hazrat Nizamuddin was buried,

00:07.358 --> 00:12.551
He was a great nabi and a sufi

00:12.959 --> 00:20.623
and in his whole poetry he has used very symbolic things

00:21.303 --> 00:23.719
and for people of that level

00:24.025 --> 00:27.562
they do not think of any religion being exclusive.

00:28.289 --> 00:33.172
Even Mohammad saheb never talked only of Islam.

00:33.785 --> 00:41.648
He talked of all the people who came before.

00:42.418 --> 00:47.755
Like Abraham, then he talked of Moses, then he talked of Christ

00:47.903 --> 00:51.231
and his mother specially in Quran he has talked it.

00:51.351 --> 00:54.868
He never talked that I am something separate, never exclusive.

00:54.971 --> 00:56.837
They can never be exclusive

00:57.391 --> 01:02.050
because they know that all these great people came on this earth

01:02.198 --> 01:06.177
to do the emancipation of human beings,

01:06.596 --> 01:13.063
so their expertise and same as Hazarat Nizamuddin.

01:13.404 --> 01:17.191
Long time back before my marriage when I came here

01:17.634 --> 01:20.048
I was the first I think to put

01:20.196 --> 01:24.084
a chadar of flowers on him

01:25.309 --> 01:28.926
and my father also was a great soul.

01:29.437 --> 01:35.389
He told me this is Hazarat Nizamuddin and his disciple was Kusro

01:35.741 --> 01:38.141
was a great poet in Hindi language,

01:38.360 --> 01:40.760
he is regarded as a very great poet

01:40.911 --> 01:45.185
and he is the one who has written this beautiful song,

01:45.372 --> 01:49.718
now the symbolic is this chap means is the Muslims.

01:49.922 --> 01:51.602
Tilaks are the Hindus.

01:51.804 --> 01:55.852
I have given up everything once I met the reality.

01:56.272 --> 02:00.545
But it’s very deep and beautifully explained

02:00.773 --> 02:04.615
and though they were born in the Muslim community,

02:04.740 --> 02:07.891
they saw the reality in every religion

02:08.221 --> 02:10.889
and these sufis are everywhere and I am surprised

02:11.037 --> 02:12.557
they are in Turkey

02:12.933 --> 02:17.159
and also they are now when I went to Tunisair they are there.

02:17.318 --> 02:20.855
All over the world the sufis are there. These are also the sufis

02:20.946 --> 02:24.573
but now they have become real Sahaja Yogi sufis

02:29.540 --> 02:33.547
and this is something is exactly the Sahaja yoga.

02:33.775 --> 02:38.649
Spontaneously, as soon as I saw you I lost all this nonsense.

02:39.115 --> 02:42.721
Very spontaneous. Sahaj and this is what

02:42.937 --> 02:45.537
so beautifully expressed in this song.

02:45.929 --> 02:49.449
I read, I read this song when I was a very young girl.

02:49.612 --> 02:54.804
Wanted to see sometimes the tomb of Hazarat Nizamuddin Saheb.

02:55.656 --> 03:01.362
He was so great and whose brought so much luck to this Delhi

03:01.576 --> 03:04.353
aprat from that we have Dam Dam Sahab.

03:04.469 --> 03:07.391
We have all these great people very dear,

03:07.505 --> 03:09.372
it’s a very precious place.

03:09.546 --> 03:13.196
So when I, we wanted to have a program here

03:13.355 --> 03:16.298
the police people came and told us that

03:16.423 --> 03:19.949
don’t have it there because
there are lots of Muslims they will kill you.

03:20.085 --> 03:22.298
I said what sort of muslims there?

03:22.436 --> 03:25.189
They said, they are all disciples of Nizamuddin.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.965
I said, they are my people. Don’t worry.

03:28.102 --> 03:30.969
They won’t do anything to me. I know that.

03:33.930 --> 03:37.645
So this oneness of spirit can only be felt

03:37.838 --> 03:40.956
by people who have enlightenment.

03:41.081 --> 03:43.547
Those who do not have enlightenment,

03:43.690 --> 03:48.440
see everything separated different and fight

03:49.294 --> 03:52.309
but those who are enlightened see.

03:52.766 --> 03:56.099
I always give an example of a Marathi poet.

03:56.515 --> 03:59.182
He went to, he was was himself a Tailor

03:59.439 --> 04:05.237
and he went to see one another great saint

04:05.516 --> 04:08.055
who was just a potter.

04:08.234 --> 04:12.976
So this potter was kneading the mud.

04:14.623 --> 04:17.380
When this saint the Tailor,

04:17.619 --> 04:25.461
Namadeva went and saw him kneading the mud.

04:26.295 --> 04:29.310
He just stopped and looked at him,

04:30.005 --> 04:33.217
and what he says that, In Marathi says

04:33.475 --> 04:36.431
”Nirgunachabheti alou sagunachi”

04:36.689 --> 04:38.812
meaning, I came to see the

04:39.804 --> 04:42.879
Nirakar, I came to see here formless

04:43.396 --> 04:48.018
but here it is formless is in form. That is you.

04:48.594 --> 04:52.231
Only a saint can appreciate a saint.

04:52.489 --> 04:55.223
Only can a saint can understand a saint.

04:56.279 --> 05:01.576
So, was Nizamuddin Sahab, we have seen in Chishti

05:01.755 --> 05:06.735
we have got Middin Sahab, we have many sufis in India

05:07.351 --> 05:12.124
and they are worshipped and respected by all the communities.

05:13.395 --> 05:15.928
Shirdi Sainath was another one Nath,

05:16.514 --> 05:19.529
regarded very great nath panthis.

05:19.709 --> 05:21.465
They were all enlightened people.

05:21.624 --> 05:24.218
They didn’t have this kind of a nonsense

05:24.243 --> 05:27.043
this dharam, that dharam, that dharam, no,

05:27.259 --> 05:31.187
for them only oneness with God

05:31.365 --> 05:33.296
and these two persons,

05:33.496 --> 05:36.888
Ameer  Khusrau's going side of him
when I was very young

05:37.286 --> 05:40.422
and I was surprised people never understood him.

05:40.698 --> 05:44.507
I wish you all could read his poetry and understand

05:44.678 --> 05:46.358
with a symbolic meaning.

05:46.908 --> 05:49.249
May God bless you.
