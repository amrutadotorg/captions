06:25.820 --> 06:38.680
Today we are here to celebrate Sahastrar Day.

06:50.620 --> 06:56.940
It was not very difficult for Me to open the

06:57.220 --> 07:04.820
Sahastrar because there were so many seekers
in this world: because, of course, I had studied

07:08.810 --> 07:15.810
also, the permutations and combinations from
which you all are, in a way, suffering. Also,

07:23.389 --> 07:30.389
the time had come. I felt [that] horrible
gurus, who are really devils, are trying to

07:35.220 --> 07:42.220
capture all the seekers. I thought it's high
time that Sahastrara should be opened out.

07:54.180 --> 08:01.180
It was not like Christ’s crucifixion by
any chance. In those days one had to do lot

08:07.099 --> 08:14.099
of tapasya and that’s what He went through.
But in these modern times, what you know
is much more important than what you do.

08:31.300 --> 08:38.300
It is such a universal awareness now because
of maybe, medias, because of communications,

08:44.730 --> 08:51.730
because of travelling, that a human mind knows
a lot. It knows so much sometimes that its

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
brain cannot even bear it. It is so overloaded
with ideas and also the human mind is all

09:08.019 --> 09:15.019
the time anxious to grasp, absorb and retain
whatever he thinks is knowledge. But he lacks

09:19.810 --> 09:26.810
discretion, so all kind of things are accumulated
in his brain in the modern times. Specially

09:27.730 --> 09:34.730
with the advent of all this media like television,
computers. Not a media, but it’s quite a

09:44.310 --> 09:51.310
complicated brain again...the man had to know
the technique of all these things very much.

09:58.029 --> 10:03.220
And this technique, if he understood, he could
do many things, many more things than your

10:03.220 --> 10:10.220
forefathers could do. Thus, materialism started
taking its own development in the minds of

10:18.220 --> 10:25.220
people. So the curse of human beings, at that
time, was materialism: when I felt that Sahastrara

10:29.890 --> 10:34.070
must be opened out.

10:34.070 --> 10:41.070
Before that, people were just simple, innocent:
they all believed in God, they never doubted,

10:44.060 --> 10:51.060
and they didn't even seek the Truth. This
materialism created such a competition among

10:55.279 --> 11:02.279
human beings, such hypocrisy, that people
started finding out that: this is not honest,

11:09.850 --> 11:16.850
materialism is not joy-giving, you can't get
peace out of materialism. Just it started

11:21.310 --> 11:27.540
developing into their awareness that this
is not the end of our achievement, this is

11:27.540 --> 11:34.540
not what we have to know, this is not what
is going to give us joy and peace.

11:37.410 --> 11:44.410
Specially after war, this awareness started
growing very much among young people. This

11:48.040 --> 11:55.040
is also because, now, the human awareness
had reached the state of the brain. That's

11:58.920 --> 12:05.920
how they started knowing better, absorbing
better and retaining better. You take a little

12:09.680 --> 12:15.350
child of today, he knows much better than
you would have known when you were even 25

12:15.350 --> 12:22.350
years of age; because he’s supposed to know
about everything. And thus, there was no movement

12:29.779 --> 12:36.779
towards knowing what is the Truth.But, as
this awareness grew more and more, lots of

12:47.100 --> 12:54.100
seekers were created on this earth. So many
people, who never knew they were seekers,

12:55.029 --> 13:02.029
suddenly became seekers. It's a atmospheric
effect, I should say. And thus, a new category

13:06.610 --> 13:13.610
of people were born, became aware, that they
have to find out the Truth.

13:14.810 --> 13:21.810
So, it was all simultaneously, according to
the time, that Sahastrara was to be opened

13:31.320 --> 13:38.320
out. And thus, this happened. For us sahaja
yogis, of course, Sahastrara is the biggest

13:42.680 --> 13:49.680
event. Or we should say - whatever work all
the incarnations have done, all the seers

13:52.389 --> 13:59.389
and saints and prophets have done, this is
the culminating point. They did it for individuals,

14:03.279 --> 14:10.279
but to do for masses, that it should go to
every nook and corner of this world, is the

14:17.949 --> 14:24.949
ultimate end of all spiritual growth all over,
in every religion, through every great incarnations

14:29.290 --> 14:31.300
and prophets.

14:31.300 --> 14:38.300
What They indicated about future, what They
talked about, what you are to know yourself,

14:46.639 --> 14:53.639
that you have to find yourself, that you have
to become a realised-soul, that you should

14:54.269 --> 15:01.269
have atmasakshatkar, that you should be a
wali. All these indications....Even the Buddhists

15:09.790 --> 15:16.790
know that Matreya has to come. Ma-treya. “Ma”
is Mother. Three times. Trigunatmika. Even

15:17.970 --> 15:24.970
the Greeks had Athena with 3 powers in Her.
So, all of them have been predicting about

15:27.970 --> 15:34.970
this time. And that time came and that’s
how I call it the blossom time and the fruits

15:40.740 --> 15:42.269
that are you people.

15:42.269 --> 15:49.269
So it is all so much, we can say, in the cosmic
cycle of different seasons - [that] this beautiful

15:55.759 --> 16:02.759
time has come and, like the wheel of time,
has to turn and go further - [that] Sahaja

16:06.410 --> 16:13.410
Yoga started. Of course, in a very small way,
but has now grown so big all over the world.

16:14.389 --> 16:21.389
Here now, there’s another thing that has
happened, which is rather remarkable, that

16:29.920 --> 16:36.920
so far, people used to meditate alone and
maybe one of them might get realisation, but

16:39.730 --> 16:46.730
there was no phenomena of en masse realisation,
nor of en masse meditation in those days.

16:47.730 --> 16:52.769
They all used to disappear into some nook
and corner of a quiet place where they would

16:52.769 --> 16:59.769
sit down and meditate. But this en masse realisation,
en masse meditation, en masse understanding

17:05.829 --> 17:12.829
and learning about your being was not even
imagined by Me: that it would go to such a

17:17.309 --> 17:24.309
limit, to such an extent, with leaps and bounds.
This year specially, it has taken a very new

17:27.039 --> 17:34.039
dimension, I think, everywhere and all that
is negative is being exposed in most of the

17:38.650 --> 17:40.320
countries.

17:40.320 --> 17:47.320
So this is how, when the Sahastrara opened,
the Kundalini started moving towards this

17:50.280 --> 17:57.280
Divine Power, getting connected with It and
was all the time flowing within you, when

18:04.490 --> 18:11.490
the nirvikalpa state came. Now when it is
coming through the Sahastrara, one has to

18:14.590 --> 18:21.590
know that the Sahastrara has to be clean,
so that the flow of Divine Power is going,

18:29.610 --> 18:36.610
penetrating, without any obstacle, without
getting impure, without getting into any kind

18:44.919 --> 18:51.919
of problems. So, to get to
that level, to that state, all the sahaja
yogi, I am happy to know, are trying to work

19:04.020 --> 19:11.020
it out, their own individual meditations also,
so that this growth should take place.

19:16.240 --> 19:23.240
Thus, you get enlightenment in a full way.
But then one must ask why, for what? What’s

19:28.030 --> 19:35.030
the purpose? What’s the aim? The aim is:
your aim is lost. You don’t seek for aims

19:40.820 --> 19:47.820
at all anymore. This pendal was built with
such great ability for which we didn't pay

19:56.730 --> 20:03.520
anything. Everybody was working here day and
night, in the rainy season, and I was quite

20:03.520 --> 20:10.400
worried about them. I said, “What's the
matter?” they said, “We are enjoying,

20:10.400 --> 20:14.080
Mother. We are enjoying!” “What enjoying?”
“We’re enjoying the rain.” All right.

20:14.080 --> 20:19.679
“We are enjoying the cold.” All right.
“Enjoying everything, lifting all these

20:19.679 --> 20:26.090
heavy things, everything we are enjoying.”
I was quite surprised at them. Nobody had

20:26.090 --> 20:33.090
any complaints, but everybody was just on
the warpath, building this tent for you.

20:37.210 --> 20:44.210
So what happens? Once your Sahastrara is clean,
this flow of joy doesn't allow you even to

20:47.500 --> 20:53.320
think that you are exerting or you are working.
Normally, if you tell somebody that this is

20:53.320 --> 21:00.320
to be erected [they say] “Aaaaaah!” Some
would faint and some would say, “Ah, this

21:03.130 --> 21:09.140
will take at least one year.” Then they'll
start giving excuses. “This pole is no good.

21:09.140 --> 21:14.350
That is no good. It won't stand that. There’s
nothing, there's nothing…” Ultimately,

21:14.350 --> 21:20.549
you'll find nothing is done. It will lie like
this for years together. “You better get

21:20.549 --> 21:27.530
another person. You better buy another one.”
Everything is postponed all the time and nothing

21:27.530 --> 21:29.020
is done.

21:29.020 --> 21:36.020
But here, you don't feel you are doing anything.
When you don't feel you are doing anything,

21:36.260 --> 21:41.640
how can you say then, “Why?” Because I'm
not doing anything, in any way, so I don't

21:41.640 --> 21:48.640
ask question “Why?” Do I? And in any case,
I'm not doing anything. That is the state

21:51.720 --> 21:58.720
where you are working in the Divine Plan.
You are doing lot of work, but nobody feels

22:07.750 --> 22:14.750
they are doing anything. They all think, we
are absolutely just enjoying ourselves, doing

22:15.260 --> 22:22.260
nothing. This kind of a state is the blessing
of Sahastrara because only in your brain you

22:25.130 --> 22:32.130
think all these things; labour-saving devices.
I mean, you tell anybody, “You go and telephone

22:32.309 --> 22:38.200
to this person.” Immediately, if it is a
modern man, he'll say, “He may not be there.

22:38.200 --> 22:44.539
God knows. What’s the use? Telephone may
not be all right.” “Baba, you see! Why

22:44.539 --> 22:49.480
don't you see if the telephone is all right
or not?” Before that only he will give this

22:49.480 --> 22:56.480
hundred and one explanations that it may not
be all right, it maybe something may be wrong

22:56.539 --> 23:03.539
and just labour-saving, first. That is one
of the tricks of the brain.

23:04.080 --> 23:10.220
Then this intelligence cheats you all the
time. It gives you rationality for everything.

23:10.220 --> 23:17.220
Like a person kills his father and you ask
him, “Why did you kill?” “Why not? He

23:17.299 --> 23:24.299
was so old. He was suffering and I wanted
to have all the property, so I thought better

23:24.600 --> 23:31.320
kill him” Like Queen Victoria became very
old, so her son was to think that “I'll

23:31.320 --> 23:36.419
never become a king if this lady goes on like
this!”

23:36.419 --> 23:43.419
So, the brain starts giving lots of explanation
and cheating – because rationality. It gives

23:48.450 --> 23:55.450
rationality and rationality is nothing but
ego or your conditioning. Your ego tells you,

23:57.460 --> 24:04.039
“No, this is no good,” so you stick on
to that point, “This is not good.” Then

24:04.039 --> 24:11.039
another can ask you why it is not good. “I
think it is not good, so I think.” Or, like

24:11.789 --> 24:18.789
some say, “I believe,” but why? But in
Sahaja Yoga answer is simple, “Why do you

24:20.309 --> 24:27.279
do it?” - “I enjoy it.” What's the next
answer? “Why are you worried? I am enjoying

24:27.279 --> 24:32.370
it.”

24:32.370 --> 24:39.370
Now the people who also say like that, because
of their conditionings, “Oh, I am enjoying

24:39.580 --> 24:44.880
it.” Somebody will say, “I enjoy my drink.”
Somebody can say, “I enjoy my going to the

24:44.880 --> 24:50.970
church.” Sometimes I say going – something
else, you see, like that. They are enjoying

24:50.970 --> 24:56.860
something, which, according to Sahaja Yoga,
we too can never enjoy. But that enjoyment

24:56.860 --> 25:03.860
is not collective. That is not supported by
anyone. For example, somebody says, “I enjoy

25:06.210 --> 25:13.210
drinking.” Nobody has erected any temple
or any statue of a man who drinks. Have you

25:14.510 --> 25:21.510
seen anywhere in the whole world? So, though
he may say that, “I enjoy,” it has no

25:25.169 --> 25:32.169
sanction from the society. People can say,
“I enjoy stealing,” people can say, “I

25:36.559 --> 25:43.559
enjoy killing,” but it is very arbitrary,
it is very individual and never supported

25:45.020 --> 25:52.020
by the society, even by the modern society
and there's always reaction to it.

25:53.370 --> 26:00.370
But Sahaja Yoga is not like them, when you
say, “I enjoy,” you say it because you

26:01.260 --> 26:08.260
have no ego and you have no conditionings.
It's a different situation because now the

26:09.330 --> 26:16.330
Sahastrara is opened out. So, on one side,
your ego has gone down, another side, your

26:18.110 --> 26:25.110
conditioning is finished. You are no more
conditioned. Like you talk to a Catholic...so

26:27.350 --> 26:33.080
I started talking about Christ. Immediately
he said, “Mother, now please.” I said,

26:33.080 --> 26:39.690
“I am talking about Christ, not about Catholicism.
Talking of Christ, why are you frightened

26:39.690 --> 26:44.620
about?” “Mother, we shouldn't become Catholic
again, you know. That's why we are worried

26:44.620 --> 26:44.929
about.”

26:44.929 --> 26:51.929
Babaa! Christ never started Catholicism. So
much so, they have developed a kind of a de-conditioning

26:52.940 --> 26:59.940
of their minds, that they start seeing that
whatever these people have done so far was

27:02.190 --> 27:09.190
wrong and that "Whatever I have done so far
was absolutely wrong and I'm not going do

27:10.120 --> 27:16.440
it." It's a very common thing. I have seen
the people who have worshipped Christ prefer

27:16.440 --> 27:21.529
to worship Ganesha and those who have worshipped
Ganesha prefer to worship Christ. [They are]

27:21.529 --> 27:27.720
just the same, the name is different, but
just the same, but they like it: because [to

27:27.720 --> 27:34.720
them] Christ means the priest, the confessions,
rosaries and also cemeteries. So they don't

27:38.929 --> 27:45.929
want to have. These conditionings, itself,
start showing their own forms, like devils,

27:51.350 --> 27:58.350
and sahaja yogis want to avoid it, or have
nothing to do with them.

27:59.669 --> 28:06.140
I remember in the beginning, we had about
six, seven hippies from England and they had

28:06.140 --> 28:12.320
come to Rahuri. We were having a program and
there were five, six real hippies. These were

28:12.320 --> 28:17.960
hippies [who] became sahaja yogis, real hippies
came to the program. I was just sitting like

28:17.960 --> 28:24.960
this and suddenly they said, “Ooooh nooooo!”
I said, “What has happened?” I started

28:25.480 --> 28:32.480
saying; as if some snake has entered or what
has happened? They were hippies, but with

28:33.289 --> 28:40.289
this de-conditioning of the conditions, they
just couldn't bear those same hippies - that

28:40.679 --> 28:47.679
they [once] were - coming inside. Because
you start seeing clearly, very clearly, that

28:54.669 --> 29:01.669
all these conditionings had blinded us completely
and misled us into a wilderness.

29:06.840 --> 29:13.010
Of course, about ego, in the West people are
extremely conscious. There was a leader’s

29:13.010 --> 29:19.549
wife. I said, “Why don't you help your husband?”
She said, “Mother, I’m worried about my

29:19.549 --> 29:24.490
ego.” I said, “Why?” “If I start doing
some work, this ego might develop again, so

29:24.490 --> 29:31.490
I'm rather worried.” They are so conscious
of it, that this ego should not come back.

29:33.770 --> 29:40.770
One fellow who came to Me and I was talking
to him, then he just ran away. I said, “What

29:41.039 --> 29:46.940
happened?” So he said, “No, those people
who go close to Mother always develop very

29:46.940 --> 29:53.940
bad ego. So I don't want to be there close
with Her.” So, is a such … (laughing)...

29:55.520 --> 30:02.520
such a mind that sees madness, that sees insanity,
that sees immaturity, it sees vulgarity, it

30:05.919 --> 30:12.919
sees deceit, hypocrisy, everything so clearly:
and in that state, he gets confused and quite

30:14.820 --> 30:21.179
upset, wants to run away from everyone.

30:21.179 --> 30:28.179
Then we have some sahaja yogis who have such
problems, who come to Sahaja Yoga with problems.

30:30.460 --> 30:35.870
Then, these people see them with these problems
they are still continuing. Now the Sahastrara

30:35.870 --> 30:42.600
doesn't want to accept it. “It's terrible.
I was like him. No, no, no more. Me, I don't

30:42.600 --> 30:49.600
want to be like that.” So, they abhor the
person who was just like them; they just can't

30:54.149 --> 31:01.149
bear him, they just can't tolerate. Then I
would say still you have to grow. You have

31:05.490 --> 31:12.490
to grow, your Sahastrara has to be cleansed
out at such a speed, at such a level and stage

31:16.600 --> 31:23.600
that, like soap cleanses everything, it should
cleanse everything else, should not be afraid

31:24.860 --> 31:31.860
of anything, should not have any worry about
the conditionings of others or ego of others:

31:34.130 --> 31:37.090
that is the state now we have to reach.

31:37.090 --> 31:44.090
Today is the Sahastrara Day, is the 23rd Sahastrara
Day and I shouldn't expect much, I don't want

31:50.450 --> 31:57.450
to say anything much about it: but I wish
and I hope that all the thousand petals of

31:59.710 --> 32:06.460
your Sahastraras will be so cleansed that
you will never catch from anybody; you will

32:06.460 --> 32:13.460
never be frightened of anybody. You will be
masters of all kinds of curatives and also

32:19.500 --> 32:26.500
you will be the one who can give solace, peace
to others; you will be the one who’ll be

32:30.830 --> 32:37.830
organising programs outside, you will the
one who will be responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

32:42.669 --> 32:49.669
And when that happens, then we can see that
these thousand petals of the Sahastrara have

32:55.350 --> 33:01.700
opened out.

33:01.700 --> 33:08.700
These thousand petals are not yet awakened.
They signify the different thousand powers

33:18.279 --> 33:25.279
of the Goddess, minimum of minimum. These
thousand ones you can open out yourself by

33:33.380 --> 33:40.380
introspection, by looking at yourself, making
fun of yourself.

33:41.450 --> 33:48.450
“Know Thyself” means know yourself with
all the defects you have and also the potential

33:50.149 --> 33:57.059
you have and all the good points you have.
So as far as you are concerned, when you are

33:57.059 --> 34:03.580
looking at yourself you should just see to
the defects that you have. “Why do I behave

34:03.580 --> 34:10.580
like this? Why do I assert so much? What's
the problem? Why can't I see myself clearly?”

34:17.020 --> 34:24.020
With that transparency of your Sahastrara,
you can see your heart, you can see your mind,

34:26.679 --> 34:33.679
you can see yourself fully, clearly, what's
wrong with you. This transparency can come

34:38.020 --> 34:45.020
only if you have really the pure desire, shuddha
iccha, to be
of that level. Now, there is no competition

35:01.430 --> 35:08.430
between A and B. We don't say that, “You
got the first prize for coming out of the

35:11.000 --> 35:18.000
Sahastrara” (laughing) or we don't say,
“You have the second prize.” There's nothing

35:19.109 --> 35:26.109
like first, second in Sahaja Yoga, because
we are not running the race. There’s no

35:30.130 --> 35:37.130
competition between us. Whatever we are doing
is for our own satisfaction. Now think of

35:38.230 --> 35:44.480
something. There are five people who are running.
Now they have to think, out of these five

35:44.480 --> 35:51.480
people, who goes first. Here it is the other
way round: The five people are meditating;

35:55.140 --> 36:02.140
now everyone individually has to see for himself
if he satisfies himself or not, nobody else

36:04.770 --> 36:10.619
is going to give you a certificate. It is
you who has to give certificate to yourself,

36:10.619 --> 36:15.550
honestly. It's a very different position.

36:15.550 --> 36:22.550
It is you, your Sahastrara and your attention
and you have to see, within yourself, “How

36:24.900 --> 36:31.900
far have I realised my own powers, my own
compassion, my own personality?” You’ll

36:40.849 --> 36:47.849
have to test it yourself. It is you are the
one who decides. When you are the one who

36:52.240 --> 36:59.240
is running, it is you are the one who decides
without running, then what is the question

37:02.060 --> 37:09.060
of competition? The whole thing disappears
into nothing.

37:14.810 --> 37:21.810
As I told you the other day, an analogy that,
if you are looking at the mirror, then you

37:26.089 --> 37:33.089
are the one who is observing, your reflection
is the one that is observed and there is the

37:34.290 --> 37:41.290
action of seeing, so you are in 3 dimensions.
But supposing you become the mirror yourself,

37:47.320 --> 37:54.320
the whole process is reversed: You see yourself.
You don't have to see because you are seeing

37:58.640 --> 38:05.640
it all the time, it's just spontaneous. In
the same manner, when it comes to Sahastrara,

38:08.140 --> 38:15.140
it is your Sahastrara itself gives you the
full idea as to how you are. The diagnosis

38:15.410 --> 38:22.410
comes from your own Sahastrara. Your own Sahastrara
tells you what centres are catching because

38:23.290 --> 38:30.290
all the peethas of these seven centres are
in the Sahastrara. As if the Sahastrara is

38:33.060 --> 38:40.060
now watching yourself and reporting to you,
“See, this is wrong with you. This is wrong

38:41.339 --> 38:47.570
with you, this is wrong with you.” So, Sahastrara
being the best well-wisher that you have,

38:47.570 --> 38:54.240
gives you the right information about yourself,
so the best is that you correct yourself.

38:54.240 --> 39:01.240
So then, achieve that perfect state: that
is what you have to do. But once you have

39:03.060 --> 39:10.060
achieved the perfect state, you have achieved
your aim, you have no aim left. Like the lights

39:10.869 --> 39:17.700
now, till you have to make the lights, you
had to work hard, make the lights, put them

39:17.700 --> 39:24.700
right, do everything that is necessary. But
once it is made and the light comes into it,

39:25.960 --> 39:32.960
then the job of the light is to give the light.
So the first function is over.

39:39.790 --> 39:46.790
Now the second function is to give it back.

39:49.920 --> 39:56.470
You reach your aim, your destination. For
example, I had to come here. Alright? So I

39:56.470 --> 40:03.470
come all the way from My house, come in the
car, walking and come and sit down here. Now

40:04.950 --> 40:11.950
it’s finished that part, over. Now I don'
t have to walk, otherwise I’ll be all the

40:12.819 --> 40:19.819
time running. So, all this mad race of this
brain stops. For what should it be used now?

40:27.430 --> 40:34.430
For enjoying the peace, for enjoying the joy,
for enjoying the collectivity. So, the labour

40:39.990 --> 40:46.990
or the hard work or you can also say the planning
of the future finishes off. Only thing now

40:48.650 --> 40:52.730
you have got it, so better enjoy it.

40:52.730 --> 40:59.730
It’s like you are coming from outside, you
are running, you are very hungry, you want

41:04.960 --> 41:11.960
to reach home. Once you reach home, then the
food is served to you. Now what's your aim?

41:14.390 --> 41:20.510
Nothing, but to enjoy the food for which you
were running. But after that also, if you

41:20.510 --> 41:27.510
start running, then one should say it is absolute
stupidity! But the capacity of enjoyment only

41:31.420 --> 41:38.420
comes when your Sahastrara is absolutely open.
Otherwise the capacity to enjoy is much less

41:43.890 --> 41:50.790
and you become like a person who is running
all the time after something which you never

41:50.790 --> 41:57.790
achieve. There are many like that. All their
lives they’re like mad, you know. They are

41:59.220 --> 42:06.220
working morning till evening, everyday, achieving
nothing! Next day again get up, again running!

42:07.859 --> 42:14.859
All their lives running like this till their
foot is in the grave, they are still running.

42:17.099 --> 42:24.099
But after getting to Sahaja Yoga, you stop
all these activities and leave it to your

42:26.329 --> 42:33.329
Sahaja Yoga to work, to your Sahastrara to
work it out. And it works out. You don't have

42:36.579 --> 42:42.099
to rush. You don't have to be so competent.
You don't have to write down everything. You

42:42.099 --> 42:49.099
don't have to think of planning everything.
Just everything works out and it works out

42:49.890 --> 42:55.950
beautifully. The only thing that one has to
do is to accept whatever is happening for

42:55.950 --> 43:02.950
our good. Even in small, small things. For
today's delay in the puja, is the desire of

43:08.369 --> 43:15.369
some people who wanted to give you some sort
of a … I shouldn't say that, but some secret

43:17.770 --> 43:23.690
show was going to be there and they didn't
want any light. So they were thinking, “What

43:23.690 --> 43:27.650
will happen – the puja will be over by about
five, then by six o'clock they’ll eat their

43:27.650 --> 43:33.880
food, but the sun would be there till nine
o'clock, then how can we show this?” All

43:33.880 --> 43:38.890
right, so have it in the night.

43:38.890 --> 43:45.890
In every small thing you will see. Some people
were coming from India and they had to bring

43:46.190 --> 43:53.190
My two boxes from there and they wouldn't
allow these boxes, they said it is overweight,

43:53.369 --> 43:57.640
overweight. So they didn't know what to do.
They thought that they should send them back

43:57.640 --> 44:04.640
and later on it can go till Guru puja or somewhere.
But they thought that there must be some plan,

44:06.270 --> 44:13.270
must be some drama. The plane was late [by]
19 hours, so they thought there must be some

44:13.630 --> 44:20.630
drama; and then they were put into some sort
of a tourist hotel for that night. Next morning

44:25.119 --> 44:32.119
they met two other Indians from, sahaja yogis,
from Poona, two boys. That settled it! My

44:40.440 --> 44:47.440
luggage, they could put it in their name and
that’s how the luggage came in. But they

44:48.329 --> 44:55.329
never felt bored: 19 hours. “We had nice
time, Mother, together. We were enjoying and

44:55.599 --> 45:01.470
talking,” finished! Nobody feels the time
is passing out. Otherwise, anybody else would

45:01.470 --> 45:08.470
have eaten up all the airport personnel and
would have broken all the telephones. Waiting

45:09.780 --> 45:16.780
for 19hours, “My God, what is this!!”
Would have given it in the newspapers. Everybody

45:16.999 --> 45:23.630
… this is the greatest crime! While these
were enjoying life nicely.

45:23.630 --> 45:30.630
So, we have lost now the sense of aim. We
don't have any aims. We just want to enjoy.

45:33.119 --> 45:40.119
It’s a very, very big thing that has happened
because, as you know, the joy in the Sahastrara

45:45.130 --> 45:52.130
is nira-ananda, nira-ananda. Of course, Nira
is My name also, but it means pure absolute

45:58.220 --> 46:05.220
joy. Nira-ananda. And that nirananda, that
joy has no other hues. It’s just pure, pure

46:12.010 --> 46:19.010
joy. Without thinking, it just pours into
it. After all, every activity is for what,

46:21.230 --> 46:28.230
for getting some sort of a pleasure, sensation
and also, some people believe, for joy. It’s

46:29.710 --> 46:30.230
not.

46:30.230 --> 46:35.060
Only after the opening of Sahastrara and the
cleansing of it, then you will know what is

46:35.060 --> 46:35.589
joy.

46:35.589 --> 46:42.410
You can't explain it, how you can spend hours
together like this. People don't understand.

46:42.410 --> 46:47.970
Like even our mayor was telling Me that, “We
can't sit in the church for more than fifteen

46:47.970 --> 46:54.970
minutes. And how people are sitting here for
so many hours. Fifteen minutes we cannot sit,

46:56.170 --> 47:02.960
but how these people are sitting for such
a long time. What are they doing there? What

47:02.960 --> 47:08.810
is their entertainment? How can they sit for
hours together, without saying anything, without

47:08.810 --> 47:15.810
dropping even a pin, they are just all the
time there. So what have you given them? What

47:15.890 --> 47:22.890
is happening to them?” This is very surprising
and remarkable that these people, who are

47:24.750 --> 47:31.170
not even sahaja yogis, can see clearly that
you people are least bothered, you are absolutely

47:31.170 --> 47:38.170
enjoying life. Whatever you may be doing is
not important, what is important is that,

47:38.849 --> 47:45.849
whether you are working in the office or outside,
you are full of joy, enjoying everything.

47:47.260 --> 47:54.260
This is the most important thing in life,
which you can have only through Sahaja Yoga,

47:54.849 --> 48:00.720
because your Sahastraras are open, because
they are opened out.

48:00.720 --> 48:07.720
There is now one more thing I have to tell
you, that is very important for all of you

48:08.460 --> 48:15.460
to remember: that, while living in this Ocean
of Joy, we have to remember that there are

48:20.420 --> 48:27.420
many who have not yet jumped into it, so we
have to bring them in; and it’s such a pleasure,

48:28.240 --> 48:35.240
such a joy to give realisation to someone,
extremely joyful.

48:35.319 --> 48:42.319
So we need people who would come and say that
“We’ll definitely come for this [work].”

48:45.400 --> 48:52.400
I mean, they should really come forward and,
once they come forward, you'll be amazed how

48:56.030 --> 49:03.030
things will work out. There are many, I know,
who are going all over, everywhere and spreading

49:05.130 --> 49:12.130
Sahaja Yoga. So is very important for all
of you to know that you have got the light

49:12.890 --> 49:19.630
to be given to others. Come forward. Don't
have fear of your ego, conditionings, nothing.

49:19.630 --> 49:26.059
Come forward. You have all the strength, you
have everything within yourself and you will

49:26.059 --> 49:32.640
do everything with such happiness and joy.
Everywhere, in every country people are doing

49:32.640 --> 49:37.680
that, but some of them are doing, some of
them are not doing. All of you are quite capable

49:37.680 --> 49:44.680
of doing it, so please come forward and see
for yourself what you are capable of.

49:47.510 --> 49:54.200
First of all you should have faith in yourself.
If you have no faith in yourself, you cannot

49:54.200 --> 50:01.200
do anything. Have faith. You should have no
fears of any kind. And also to introspect,

50:04.940 --> 50:11.940
to see within yourself what's going on. To
be very frank, I find My brain absolutely

50:15.880 --> 50:22.780
empty. What I talk from this emptiness, I
don't know. You will also find your brain

50:22.780 --> 50:29.780
absolutely empty, and still with that empty
brain, you will be achieving a lot.

50:32.660 --> 50:37.800
It’s very remarkable, as you have seen,
that from the candle you get cool breeze.

50:37.800 --> 50:44.800
How you can get it from the candle, cool breeze?
You do get.

50:45.109 --> 50:52.109
So, is important to recognise yourself as
a Sahaja yogi and to recognise - what have

50:57.859 --> 51:04.859
you done for Sahaja Yoga? Without doing for
Sahaja Yoga, you cannot enjoy life. That was

51:07.690 --> 51:14.450
your aim and that aim you have reached. Now,
if you don't...supposing I have to come and

51:14.450 --> 51:18.650
sit on this thing and I don't sit on this
thing, then what's the use of coming here?

51:18.650 --> 51:25.650
I came here to tell you something about Sahastrara
and if I don't tell you, then what's the use

51:26.490 --> 51:33.359
of My coming here and celebrating Sahastrara
Day? In the same way, when you have reached

51:33.359 --> 51:38.710
that state now, what you have to do is not
to use for your own purpose. You have used

51:38.710 --> 51:44.730
it, quite a lot, for your health, wealth,
everything. Now what are we doing about Sahaja

51:44.730 --> 51:51.730
Yoga? What have we done for Sahaja Yoga? After
some time, you will do a lot and you will

51:52.800 --> 51:58.839
never know you have done anything for Sahaja
Yoga. Very surprising, it happens to so many

51:58.839 --> 52:05.839
of you and should happen to all of you. I
hope all of you will realise that your Sahastraras

52:08.390 --> 52:13.890
are cleaned, completely. You are perfectly
alright. You don't have to worry about it

52:13.890 --> 52:20.890
and you can really go ahead with spreading

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:05.650
of

01:09:11.219 --> 01:09:18.219
Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:13.340
May God bless you all.
