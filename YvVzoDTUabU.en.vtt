33:03.355 --> 33:05.010
It’s so nice to come back after such a long
time.

33:05.210 --> 33:07.607
And whenever I came, you always had gathered
in a very big hall.

33:07.807 --> 33:14.687
We met, and that’s how the Sahaja Yoga started
growing.

33:14.887 --> 33:23.058
It’s very important for you people from
specially from Germany, Austria.

33:23.258 --> 33:30.448
These are the people who were in the war.

33:30.648 --> 33:35.518
And now you are in the war with Me.

33:35.718 --> 33:37.998
We have to fight, fight the evil.

33:38.198 --> 33:40.158
You know how the world is.

33:40.358 --> 33:44.877
We have to fight them and we have to take
them out of ignorance.

33:45.077 --> 33:59.328
You are such a support for this because we
have to change human beings.

33:59.528 --> 34:06.107
They have to become good people very fast.

34:06.307 --> 34:09.728
Once they get their Self-realization, the
change will start.

34:09.928 --> 34:18.478
Now in England and also in Italy, what they
are doing is to give realization to people

34:18.678 --> 34:19.747
on the street.

34:19.947 --> 34:25.488
Giving on the street, thousands of people
now have become realized souls.

34:25.688 --> 34:31.688
It’s a very big thing because once you get
your realization, you become the Spirit and

34:31.888 --> 34:34.918
all the goodness should come to you.

34:35.118 --> 34:39.917
If there is anything evil, bad in you that
will go away.

34:40.117 --> 34:47.247
It’s spreading so fast everywhere and should
also spread in those countries who are there.

34:47.447 --> 34:56.478
There’s no need, no need for you to fight
or quarrel because you have got the divine

34:56.678 --> 34:57.478
help.

34:57.678 --> 35:05.418
You have got all the help all the time from
the Divine, and

35:05.618 --> 35:13.057
this is what is to be understood: that we
are helped by the Divine to transform human

35:13.257 --> 35:15.388
beings into something greater.

35:15.588 --> 35:24.007
That’s what we are and we are here because
I wanted to tell people that you must have

35:24.207 --> 35:32.537
a place, an ashram for Sahaja Yoga, and I
don’t want anybody else, but only sahaja

35:32.737 --> 35:37.807
yogis there because you don’t know how dirty
people are in this world.

35:38.007 --> 35:47.548
What things they do, you can’t imagine to
what limit they can go and can really try

35:47.748 --> 35:53.488
to harm you because they are not only negative,
but they are sometimes satanic and they’ll

35:53.688 --> 35:55.317
try to ruin your children, ruin your families,
do all kinds of things.

35:55.517 --> 35:59.048
So you have nothing to do with them.

35:59.248 --> 36:00.348
Keep away.

36:00.548 --> 36:03.532
Keep aloof because now you all have been cleansed.

36:03.732 --> 36:10.367
Those who are cleansed people don’t mix
up with people who are muddy, do they?

36:10.567 --> 36:17.939
And so must have this much of wisdom in your
head to understand that at any cost you will

36:18.139 --> 36:22.048
not mix up Sahaja Yoga with other things.

36:22.248 --> 36:25.587
It’s very important to know.

36:25.787 --> 36:30.918
I have been trying to tell this since long
that keep yourself aloof.

36:31.118 --> 36:36.688
But sometimes people don’t do it and then
they suffer a lot.

36:36.888 --> 36:44.248
We have all kinds of devils around, all kinds
of satanic forces acting as some sort of a

36:44.448 --> 36:49.367
cult, or I don’t know what they are doing,
but they’ve done no good to people, no good

36:49.567 --> 36:50.878
at all.

36:51.078 --> 36:56.748
Just see what is going on in those days: is
all kinds of fighting, quarrelling, killing.

36:56.948 --> 37:05.567
All this is going on, so you must know we
are in the very, very bad type of Kali Yuga

37:05.767 --> 37:07.698
and we have to fight it out by collectivity.

37:07.898 --> 37:10.628
Look at the children, how collective they
are.

37:10.828 --> 37:17.348
You all have to be collective and you must
love all the people, all the sahaja yogis

37:17.548 --> 37:19.778
who are around.

37:19.978 --> 37:23.558
Don’t try to find faults with them.

37:23.758 --> 37:30.678
Don’t try to fight with them because it’s
a very important work I am doing.

37:30.878 --> 37:38.238
What I’m trying to do is to transform people,
to make them good people, nice people.

37:38.438 --> 37:48.138
It’s not to get anything out of them, but
to give them something that they should become

37:48.338 --> 37:49.758
very good people.

37:49.958 --> 37:57.898
We have to have extremely good and nice people,
people who don’t hate, people who don’t

37:58.098 --> 37:58.898
have greed.

37:59.098 --> 38:02.008
Like madness, people have greed.

38:02.208 --> 38:10.658
In countries where they could make money,
they have cheated everyone and have made money,

38:10.858 --> 38:13.968
and that is how their children will suffer.

38:14.168 --> 38:15.368
They will suffer.

38:15.568 --> 38:29.238
So My attention is for all of you because
can help Me in this great war, war with the

38:29.438 --> 38:30.238
evil.

38:30.438 --> 38:34.518
These are evil people by temperament and they
want to ruin it.

38:34.718 --> 38:35.848
You must understand this.

38:36.048 --> 38:41.988
Don’t play into their hands and you become
solid because you have not come on this Earth

38:42.188 --> 38:50.118
to collect things and all that, but you have
come here to become sahaja yogis of a very

38:50.318 --> 38:51.988
great order.

38:52.188 --> 39:00.858
Another thing is, if you don’t feel your
joy within yourself, if there is no joy with

39:01.058 --> 39:03.078
you, you will trouble others.

39:03.278 --> 39:18.208
So best thing is for you is to meditate, not
to criticize, not to use your brain, but meditate.

39:18.408 --> 39:27.488
By meditation, you will know how to enjoy
Sahaja Yoga, how to enjoy everything.

39:27.688 --> 39:36.498
This has to be there and this mental activity
should go away.

39:36.698 --> 39:41.338
Don’t try to organize others.

39:41.538 --> 39:59.928
Don’t try to give lectures to others, but
what you do is to yourself introspect.

40:00.128 --> 40:10.458
See for yourself what’s wrong with you and
what wrong things you are doing.

40:10.658 --> 40:16.588
So not only being peaceful is everything,
no.

40:16.788 --> 40:24.078
Not only being good is equal, all right, but
you have to make others, you have to make

40:24.278 --> 40:25.078
others good people.

40:25.278 --> 40:29.658
You have to make them beautiful people.

40:29.858 --> 40:36.308
We have to make this world beautiful through
your own help and through your attention.

40:36.508 --> 40:43.288
Now the problem is that people take to wrong
things very easily even after Sahaj Yoga.

40:43.488 --> 40:45.628
Don’t support anyone like that.

40:45.828 --> 40:52.418
On the contrary, explain to that person that
Sahaja Yoga is a collective activity.

40:52.618 --> 40:55.138
We cannot have our own anything.

40:55.338 --> 40:57.388
We have to be active.

40:57.588 --> 41:00.868
We have to be together all the time.

41:01.068 --> 41:08.228
Togetherness is very important and then to
seek joy of that togetherness.

41:08.428 --> 41:19.788
If you can feel that joy of togetherness,
you have achieved that aim of life because

41:19.988 --> 41:27.457
then you’ll gather other people also and
give them this joy of being the Spirit.

41:27.657 --> 41:31.207
Once they become the Spirit, it starts changing.

41:31.407 --> 41:37.838
But if you are collective and if you are together
and you do all the things, then also you grow

41:38.038 --> 41:38.838
very much.

41:39.038 --> 41:46.197
Now, those who talk of separating, having
some sort of a mad idea – please don’t

41:46.397 --> 41:47.627
listen to them.

41:47.827 --> 41:49.067
You better check.

41:49.267 --> 41:51.848
Tell them, “We have to be together."

41:52.048 --> 41:54.267
We cannot, we cannot separate.

41:54.467 --> 41:57.668
And anything like this will be destroyed.

41:57.868 --> 42:03.058
Because in this world, you see, how the world
is, how the things are and how it is working

42:03.258 --> 42:04.058
out.

42:04.258 --> 42:15.418
So for you to understand the beauty of modern
times, is that you are born in a time when

42:15.618 --> 42:17.728
you can be transformed.

42:17.928 --> 42:24.127
You are born in a time when you can become
the Self, the Spirit.

42:24.327 --> 42:28.208
Everybody has tried this; nothing has worked
out.

42:28.408 --> 42:34.327
Now, with the help of your Kundalini, we are
working it out.

42:34.527 --> 42:36.408
You also know what is to be done.

42:36.608 --> 42:41.697
You know how to give realization, how to see
the vibrations, everything.

42:41.897 --> 42:45.077
And once you start seeing that, then you will
realize that what you are doing is a great

42:45.277 --> 42:46.077
harm to humanity.

42:46.277 --> 42:49.767
Now I leave upon you, all of you – you are
such sensible, good people who have come to

42:49.967 --> 43:00.298
Sahaja Yoga, and every time I came here, you
were all here.

43:00.498 --> 43:06.398
I’m happy so many countries are here only
just knowing that I am coming.

43:06.598 --> 43:09.609
How much you all love Me, I tell you.

43:09.809 --> 43:10.609
Really, it’s remarkable.

43:10.809 --> 43:13.737
All you people have shown your love.

43:13.937 --> 43:21.838
All of you have come here all the way, when
I am here for such a short time.

43:22.038 --> 43:22.838
So may God bless you all and have sense.

43:23.038 --> 43:32.757
Have sense in your head that you are now responsible
for transforming this world into a new world

43:32.957 --> 43:36.067
of very good people, spiritual people.

43:36.267 --> 43:47.447
So your responsibility is that, and as a result,
what you have to do, you will know.

43:47.647 --> 43:49.838
You all have to be very responsible.

43:50.038 --> 43:53.298
Whatever country you may come, whatever place
you may come, but you have to be very, very

43:53.498 --> 43:55.918
responsible, responsible people, and try to
understand what you are doing for Sahaja Yoga.

43:56.118 --> 44:03.548
I can see so many new faces now.

44:03.748 --> 44:05.918
I’m happy to see them.

44:06.118 --> 44:14.088
Of course most of the Austrians I have met
and Germans I’ve met before, but I see also

44:14.288 --> 44:19.898
other people from other countries – very
sweet of them to have come.

44:20.098 --> 44:27.127
So what is important is to surrender, which
is a problem with people.

44:27.327 --> 44:31.377
They cannot surrender themselves to Sahaja
Yoga.

44:31.577 --> 44:34.997
That’s what is your life.

44:35.197 --> 44:39.668
That is the beautiful river of goodness.

44:39.868 --> 44:44.958
So you should try to surrender and if you
cannot surrender, then there’s something

44:45.158 --> 44:46.488
wrong with you.

44:46.688 --> 44:54.987
Please try to surrender and you’ll be surprised
that with this surrendering only you can get

44:55.187 --> 44:58.728
complete joy, happiness and peace.

44:58.928 --> 45:09.317
That is very important and that’s what I
have come to tell you that please try to surrender.

45:09.517 --> 45:14.168
And surrendering is – I cannot say how you
force yourself, but you just go into thoughtless

45:14.368 --> 45:15.278
awareness.

45:15.478 --> 45:23.418
You meditate and into thoughtless awareness
and then I’m sure, with all My love and

45:23.618 --> 45:30.408
with all My blessings, I’m sure you will
surrender – not only surrender, but you

45:30.608 --> 45:36.807
will develop tremendous powers to convert
others also, to transform others into this

45:37.007 --> 45:37.807
good work.

45:38.007 --> 45:43.567
You all have that and if you just develop
and try to find out how many people you have

45:43.767 --> 45:46.528
helped really in life to change.

45:46.728 --> 45:48.867
Thank you very much.
