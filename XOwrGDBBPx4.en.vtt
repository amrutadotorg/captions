WEBVTT

00:16.148 --> 00:21.997
and we have to establish Him in any place
where we want to start

00:22.199 --> 00:28.734
a work or do anything about it, because He
is innocence and innocence was created

00:28.935 --> 00:31.603
before everything else was created.

00:31.804 --> 00:40.761
Is the most powerful power, I should say,
innocence.

00:41.086 --> 00:45.470
And then we’ll do the Guru Puja which is
actually

00:45.671 --> 00:50.730
the Adi Guru, the Primordial Master, who
incarnated on this Earth many a times.

00:50.931 --> 00:58.840
And, as you know, as Dattatreya He was born,

00:59.056 --> 01:05.745
as Janaka, Nanaka and many others.

01:06.008 --> 01:09.270
That principle is within us and that is
very important

01:09.471 --> 01:16.766
that we should develop the principle
of Guru Nanak or Janak

01:16.967 --> 01:22.956
or anyone of these primordial masters.
Because if the Spirit is the master,

01:23.157 --> 01:31.701
we have to become the master of ourselves.
And the power of the masters are

01:31.902 --> 01:44.170
that they are essences of the innocence –
of the creator,

01:45.640 --> 01:51.552
of the sustainer and the destroyer.

01:53.321 --> 01:58.279
They are the innocence of all these. Out
of them – this great personality –

01:58.480 --> 02:05.452
innocence of these three personalities
was created this great incarnation.

02:05.653 --> 02:11.070
And their innocence is shown by their
detachment to things – they live everywhere

02:11.271 --> 02:16.066
just like other human beings – married,
living in the families,

02:16.267 --> 02:23.047
but absolutely detached. Unless and until
this principle is awakened in you,

02:23.248 --> 02:26.447
you cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

02:27.256 --> 02:34.831
First of all, this principle of Guru must
be awakened in you which gives you balance

02:35.329 --> 02:41.463
and then the ascent has to be brought in
through the Spirit, the Atma.

02:41.664 --> 02:45.451
That is done by the Shakti, by
the Kundalini Herself.

02:45.652 --> 02:50.573
She’s the Shakti, She’s the womb. She’s
the one Who nourishes, first of all.

02:50.774 --> 02:57.148
She nourishes that power within us,
nourishes us, nourishes all our chakras.

02:57.349 --> 03:05.676
By which She cures our mental, emotional,
physical, spiritual being.

03:05.877 --> 03:08.767
Because sometimes we bow to wrong type
of people,

03:08.968 --> 03:12.093
our spiritual being is also very much hurt.

03:12.294 --> 03:15.857
And after that, after She has achieved
that,

03:16.058 --> 03:25.449
then She ascends through your fontanel bone
and gives you the Self Realization.

03:25.650 --> 03:30.985
So it is She who is the giver of your
moksha.

03:31.497 --> 03:36.217
She is the one who is the giver of
the peace, of the joy,

03:36.418 --> 03:41.790
and this Mother of yours resides in you
and She gives you the Realization.

03:41.991 --> 03:46.520
So we worship Her as the power within you,
so that you are empowered,

03:46.721 --> 03:55.126
you become powerful. But this power makes
you the master.

03:55.327 --> 03:59.527
When She comes in the Void area, She makes
you the Master

03:59.728 --> 04:07.301
because She enlightens that Guru principle
within you and you become the Master,

04:07.502 --> 04:12.796
you become the master of yourself and by
that you become the Master of others also.

04:12.997 --> 04:17.613
The one who is not the Master of oneself
cannot be the Master of others.

04:17.814 --> 04:22.627
So it works out, first of all, on you and
then it radiates.

04:22.828 --> 04:28.133
And that radiation makes others also accept
you as the guru.

04:28.334 --> 04:38.065
The dynamism and that compassionate
attitude

04:38.266 --> 04:44.507
all develops through this Guru principle.

04:44.708 --> 04:50.149
But this is the blessing of the Kundalini,
the Womb, the Mother,

04:50.350 --> 04:53.430
the one who we call as Aquarius.

04:53.631 --> 05:00.109
This is residing within us and we have to
just accept

05:00.310 --> 05:06.319
Her manifestation and welcome Her with
open heart.

05:06.520 --> 05:13.086
And know that today is the day when we are
expecting human beings

05:13.287 --> 05:19.086
to rise to that level where they become
compassion, love, affection.

05:20.291 --> 05:25.986
This is the new awareness with which we are
going to be

05:26.187 --> 05:29.771
completely fulfilled and unless and until
that happens

05:29.972 --> 05:35.777
there’s no chance for the emancipation,
no doubt about it.

05:37.677 --> 05:42.898
We have worked out so many things in so
many places

05:43.099 --> 05:47.764
and every place, I find, has a different
problem.

05:48.272 --> 05:53.510
The most difficult, I find, is America,
it’s like Mathura

05:53.711 --> 05:56.803
where Shri Krishna had to go and establish
Himself,

05:57.004 --> 06:02.730
that was the Kingdom of Shri Krishna and
where Kamsa was ruling.

06:02.931 --> 06:08.474
So the people in Mathura were the most
difficult people because they were governed

06:08.675 --> 06:13.806
by devils and the devils have a capacity
to dominate good people.

06:14.013 --> 06:17.742
They’re all so dominated that even where
Shri Krishna lived,

06:17.943 --> 06:26.043
they tried to go and harm Him and kill Him
and all that.

06:26.244 --> 06:31.549
And all the dynamism of these people from
Mathura was killed by Kamsa

06:31.750 --> 06:37.277
who was to be killed by Shri Krishna.

06:37.478 --> 06:40.838
Surprisingly, the first day I came to New
York for the puja,

06:41.039 --> 06:47.223
the first day it was written “Parivartani
Ekadashi”.

06:47.424 --> 06:54.088
Now “Ekadesha” is the power with which
the people are going to be destroyed.

06:54.289 --> 06:59.240
Now that is “Parivartani” means the one
by which you are going to be transformed.

06:59.441 --> 07:03.820
So, how is it the power that is going
to destroy is going to transform you.

07:04.021 --> 07:10.422
Firstly, it will destroy all that is
oppressive, all that kills your dynamism,

07:10.623 --> 07:14.958
all that makes you slave, that is going
to be destroyed.

07:15.159 --> 07:18.353
Secondly, people will be frightened,
the halfbaked ones

07:18.554 --> 07:24.635
who are neither here nor there, that we’ll
be destroyed and that awe will change them.

07:24.836 --> 07:29.243
Thirdly, when you see that your kith and
kin are going to be destroyed,

07:29.444 --> 07:33.817
then you’ll have much more compassion,
much more tolerance for them

07:34.018 --> 07:38.328
and you’ll try to save them all. So that is
what it is,

07:38.529 --> 07:44.769
where Shri Krishna had to raise a complete
mountain on His fingertip,

07:44.970 --> 07:49.898
you see like this, to the right side,
“Govardhandhari” He was called.

07:50.099 --> 07:53.484
That is what is my job here, is to raise
the mountain again

07:53.685 --> 07:59.773
and raise it on my finger tip like that.
But this finger has to be strong

07:59.974 --> 08:07.582
and this finger is nothing but the Sahaja
Yogis of America and they have to help

08:07.783 --> 08:15.681
by their dynamic behaviour and by their
proper understanding, responsibility

08:15.882 --> 08:22.589
as the people belonging to this great
nation of Fatherhood.

08:22.790 --> 08:28.329
This is the finger of the Father and that
Fatherhood has to be dynamic,

08:28.530 --> 08:36.987
has to be overpowering and has to be very
responsible.

08:37.188 --> 08:40.693
And in that responsibility you learn so
many things –

08:40.894 --> 08:44.346
so that’s my job is, that’s my goal is.
She (tv host) asked me in the TV,

08:44.547 --> 08:47.787
“What is your goal, Mother?” I didn’t tell
her that I have to raise

08:47.988 --> 08:51.139
the mountain on my finger, you see, she
would never have understood that.

08:51.340 --> 08:54.009
But that is what one has to do here.

08:54.210 --> 08:59.977
To raise the mountain and I find it’s like
that – Mountainous.

09:00.178 --> 09:06.043
And base of the mountain seems to be Houston
which is the most difficult part of it,

09:06.244 --> 09:12.636
they just don’t move, they just don’t move,
its jada it's very, very ‘tamasic’,

09:12.837 --> 09:18.070
it’s so full of ignorance and so full
of heaviness.

09:18.271 --> 09:22.338
That is the most difficult part and that’s
why – for Houston specially –

09:22.539 --> 09:27.892
we should do a nice puja to the Kundalini
that She rises in Houston.

09:28.093 --> 09:30.782
May God bless you all.

09:35.414 --> 09:39.009
Can you give me the handkerchief.

09:55.810 --> 09:58.990
Yogi: Today it’s said it’s Anant
Chaturdashi. Shri Mataji: Uh?

09:59.191 --> 10:02.899
Yogi: Anant Chaturdashi.
Shri Mataji: Today? Ah-ah!

10:03.100 --> 10:06.986
That’s great! Yes, must be. I was wondering
Anant Chaturdashi.

10:07.187 --> 10:12.840
Anant Chaturdashi is the day when we

10:14.829 --> 10:21.205
‘visarjan’– dissolve Shri Ganesha
in the water.

10:21.480 --> 10:25.074
(Hindi : it’s that day we put the Ganesha
in to the water)

10:25.275 --> 10:31.071
Because He’s established for ten days and
after ten days, He’s born on the fourth,

10:31.272 --> 10:37.024
after ten days He’s dissolved in the water
so that everywhere His Power is spread

10:37.225 --> 10:41.405
through the water. That’s why no wonder
there was a puja.

10:41.606 --> 10:45.154
Ganesha settled down into the water.

10:45.355 --> 10:49.473
That is Ananta Chaturdashi. Ananta is the,
is Shri Ganesha.

10:49.674 --> 10:54.324
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed.
Innocence cannot be destroyed.

10:54.525 --> 10:59.246
And that is why is the Ganesh Chaturdashi
means the day

10:59.447 --> 11:04.555
when Ganesha is dissolved in the water,

11:05.127 --> 11:13.610
in the ocean or He is created, worshipped
for ten days and again given back.

11:15.786 --> 11:21.569
So it’s a very great day today, I should
say, like the resurrection of Christ

11:21.770 --> 11:27.932
that you are,

11:30.204 --> 11:34.343
you had Christ here, He lived with you,

11:34.544 --> 11:39.112
and then went back to His Father. Father is
the ocean

11:39.313 --> 11:44.489
and that’s what in India they do, establish
Him on the fourth day

11:44.690 --> 11:48.124
and on the tenth day they put Him back
to the ocean.

11:48.325 --> 11:51.853
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in
our school. Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

11:52.054 --> 11:54.162
Yogi: I said we used to do the same
thing in our school. Shri Mataji: Eh?

11:54.363 --> 11:56.399
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in our
school.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.555
Other yogi: He says that he did the same in
his school, they used to make the Ganesha.

12:00.756 --> 12:05.937
Shri Mataji: Really? What school?
Yogi: (School name).

12:06.143 --> 12:11.775
Yogi: So we used to have a statue and four
of the guys used to carry them on.

12:11.976 --> 12:14.705
Shri Mataji: But no one understands. They
just do it without understanding

12:14.906 --> 12:18.739
what they are doing about it. So it’s
a thing, even in India

12:18.940 --> 12:21.265
how many people know about Ganesha,
no one knows.

12:21.466 --> 12:24.531
Yogini: In Maharastra. Shri Mataji: In
Maharastra, they worship Him a lot

12:24.732 --> 12:28.405
but they don’t know much about it. They
don’t know how much He’s important,

12:28.606 --> 12:32.521
about what He represents, how did He came
on this earth, nothing they know.

12:32.722 --> 12:37.056
We have become very superficial that way.

12:40.901 --> 12:44.960
But at least it keeps your attention by
doing all these things, “there”.

12:45.161 --> 12:49.350
You see, this is the advantage of in India,
the children have to be little bit

12:49.551 --> 12:54.882
pinned down to a thing they, by festivals
and all that they try to then find out

12:55.083 --> 12:58.734
what is this, what is that. Their attention
is more there, not outside so much,

12:58.935 --> 13:01.251
you see, that’s the thing is.
