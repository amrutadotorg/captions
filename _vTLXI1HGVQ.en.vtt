Public Program, Santa Cruz
18th October, 1981

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.379
Indian words in green at:
First file: 15min 40s and 55s, 43min 32s and

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.440
37s,
Second file: 18min 37s, 19min 29s and 32s,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.030
26min 27s, 33min 8s, 39min 11s, 39min 45s,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.950
Last night I was really very happy to meet
you all and I was thinking how I could reach

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.950
you so spontaneously. It was a great thing
to cherish the moments of meeting you. I went

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.699
into your beings, to your problems yesterday.
That Gregoire has said that you all have got

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.999
mostly the left-sided problem not so much
the right side, means ego is not so much there

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:07.999
as your left-sided problem. And the left-sided
problem is the problem that comes to you because

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.490
of certain mistakes you have committed in
your seeking. So doesn’t matter, it can

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.460
be worked out. The basic of the left-sided
problem comes because I think you didn’t

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.840
get the love of your parents also in your
childhood. One of the biggest problems is

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.750
that of the mother’s problem that you didn’t
feel that security when you were a child,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.750
to begin with. It’s a mother’s side. Left
side is a mother’s side.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.140
The another thing could be that when you went
into the society they tried to create diffidence

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.650
in you by their own norms and ideas about
life, you see, their idea of success is very

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.650
different from the idea of a seeker. Because
for a seeker the only success he can have

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.090
is when he has found out the truth, you see.
That’s what he is seeking. And if one child

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.780
is born who is a seeker in a family who doesn’t
know what a seeking is, they are just seeking

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.090
money or something else like that which is
very superficial and nonsensical for a seeker,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.010
the diffidence grows in him gradually in the
subconscious, and he starts thinking that,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.709
“Are we mad or is something wrong with us
or are we something strange people? What’s

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.709
happening to us? So how is it that we are
so much different from the rest of the people

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.590
who are madly doing other things so much involved,
and we don’t find the fun in that.”   

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.590
So the left side starts getting accumulating
that diffidence within yourself. Then you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.040
find some friends who are with you; you find
people who talk the same language, sort of

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.040
thing, that they are seekers, they have to
seek and they have to seek something. But

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.380
the another diffidence that starts afterwards
when you become a group or sort of this whole

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.110
thing becomes known to people who are, say,
in the market, we can say, who are in the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.110
market. Who are just trying to mobilize their
money into new channels, where they can make

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.870
some money, you see. So these people when
they come to know about such a group which

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.870
is still uncertain, does not know where to
go, what to do. You see it’s a very vulnerable

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.590
society. Very vulnerable society because there’s
nothing established. They don’t know what

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.430
to do? [If?] they realize that these people
are wasting their time, the other people who

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.930
are doing other seeking like money and all
those things, they understand that, but they

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.190
cannot also understand what they should do.
So it’s a very vulnerable, a very risky

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.190
type of a life they lead. And in that risk
the first hit comes when they give up their

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.410
parents, you see. Because of the parent’s
attitude towards them, they have to give up.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.800
And the parents in America, I was surprised,
are really not at all kind to their children.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.990
They have only rights, they have no duties,
I feel. I mean it’s just the other way round

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.440
you need. They have no duties for their children.
They are rich people, they don’t look after

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.530
your, I mean, needs, nothing. I mean it’s
something surprising. The other day somebody

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.830
told Me a story that if the son is having
a party or something and he’s enjoying himself

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.740
with his friends, then if he puts the music
little loud, the mother in the other house

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.220
would ring up the police and ask the police
to arrest this fellow. I mean this is ... one

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.570
can’t imagine in India On the contrary if
the mother, if she knows that the boys are

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.550
going to have the party, she’ll go all out
to prepare something nice for them, and how

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.970
to make them happy. And she would disappear
from there so that their age group should

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.120
enjoy themselves. I mean, this is a very common
practice in India.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.120
So many such things, you know, have crawled
up because of, I think, war. I would place

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.590
it to one of the things is war. Because of
war your parents got disturbed and they got

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.060
upset. Let’s also give them some praise
about it, all right. So they were all very

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.960
much frantic and disturbed and their nerves
were broken. Let’s take it like that. Now

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.790
whatever it happened ... then also the material
advancement, so-called, through your industrial

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.910
development, came through, all right. That
also puts such a pressure on them. I mean,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.280
if somebody has a TV, you must have TV. If
you don’t have a TV, then you are a gone

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.290
case. If he has some plastics, you must have
some plastics. They have some nylons, you

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:02.280
must have some nylons. You see, this competition
was in accumulating these things all the time,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.370
and the machines they were trying to create
more and more of this nonsense because they

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.580
are hungry things, you know. So they were
consuming all the Mother’s Earth and converting

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.340
it into all these nonsensical things, which
now is a big mountain and is a big problem

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:22.040
for you to how to dispose them out.    And
the people in the households were trying to

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.889
compete with others in this kind of a nonsensical
pursuit. You see, the whole thing was a chaos

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:34.889
for you, because you are born with a different,
different awareness within you because you

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:42.430
are awakened to a fact that material things
are not going to give you joy. And this is

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:49.360
what was difficult for you to convince your
elders. And the elders also got into the funny

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.699
ideas of Freud, I should say, and all the
people started writing books about nonsensical

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:00.169
things, how to treat your children, how to
behave towards them. It’s something absurd,

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:04.690
I can’t believe. It’s shocking when I
hear. I mean there was a girl in Switzerland,

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.560
she told Me that, “My child who was only
one and half month,” or something like that,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.570
“died in his bedroom.” I said, “In his
bedroom? I can’t understand. wWhat is that?”

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.580
She said, “We don’t [let?make?] our children
sleep with us.” I mean, I can’t understand.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:25.539
You just can’t understand how can you leave
... I mean, you can’t sleep if your children

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:30.710
are not with you. You just can’t sleep,
you are so worried. And this is something

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.900
you see from the very childhood if you are
left in another room, you feel... I mean you

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:41.180
must be frightened. And I don’t know what
must be happening to you. I mean, when I give

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.449
you realization, I’m even worried about
you, “Now what’ going to happen to these

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:47.610
children who have got realization. I have
to leave somebody here to look after you,

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:52.039
to consolidate it, to manage it, to make you
grow, otherwise you might be frightened.”

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:59.039
It’s really, it is so. With this one feels
very much disturbed and whom to blame? You

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.789
see, you cannot blame anyone. The whole thing,
you can say, it was to be like this. So accept

00:08:07.789 --> 00:08:13.500
it as it is. But it has harmed you on the
left hand side. So to begin with, in your

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:19.740
psyche, I would say, the problem started from
the right from the time you were born. Now

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.810
you took your birth with your choice. You
decided to be born to these parents. You thought

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:31.810
them to be sane people - maybe your mistake.
And then you took your birth in this great

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.130
country which had also some greatnessabout
it, no doubt, which I will tell you now, what

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:41.310
is the greatness of this country is, why you
were born in this country.    And then

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:46.480
thirdly that you had to live with your own
nature, you could not take to the nature of

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.250
other people, and the difference between the
two, the gap was so great that you just couldn’t

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:56.310
manage it, you see, and you have to get out
of it. And once you are out of your home,

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:03.310
you are absolutely vulnerable to these people
who are attacking you because you are not

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:11.080
yet matured enough to face them, you are quite
young. And you are suddenly attacked. Your

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.990
innocence is attacked.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.089
Then now you should not do this to your children.
That is very important. But now the children

00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:22.490
are going to be very powerful people. Now
look at the matured ones sitting here, just

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:27.250
like great grand old mothers, you see. They
are watching the things ... like when I went

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.660
back, these two boys, one without a shirt,
one with a shirt standing there, I said, “What

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.790
you are doing here?” They said, “We are
looking after all the crooks who are trying

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.800
to go inside and we are protecting You from
them.” These two little things. One was

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.920
so big [INAUDIBLE] they have put all their
toys there to fight, you see, all the crooks

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.120
that are going in, so they are all standing
there both of them. So it’s like that.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:55.110
You see, these great children are to be born,
no doubt, but in between is your generation

00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:01.330
which is a very important generation for Me
because you are the foundation of that great

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.230
kingdom, the Kingdom of God. So you are also
very important.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:09.790
So the first thing you have to do as I said
to say that, “Mother I’m not guilty.”

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:14.660
Do not take anything upon yourselves. Say
that, “Mother, I’m not guilty.” You

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:21.380
don’t blame yourself for anything. All right,
first thing.    Secondly is that the

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.940
left side gives you a kind of a diffidence.
It’s such a vicious circle. You get a diffidence,

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:32.990
all right. Because of diffidence you do not
get your realization, maybe. Even if you get

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.660
you realization, you go little bit coming,
little bit going, you see, all the time and

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:43.230
you get more diffident. Then the vicious circle
starts. The diffidence again stops your feeling

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.760
the vibrations, again you get into diffidence,
you start blaming yourself and hating yourself,

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.360
again it goes in a very bad vicious circle.
So first and foremost thing for all of you

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:59.300
is to have complete confidence into your faith
that you have to seek something beyond. [Firstly?]

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:04.390
this is the first faith you should have that
you have to seek something beyond and whatever

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:10.330
you were doing, maybe mistaken, doesn’t
matter, but your aims were correct. Your aims

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:15.640
were perfect and your aims were correct. All
right!    Now the second thing you have

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:22.640
to know in yourself that you are not all these
things like the worldly things that you see

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.670
but you are the Spirit. You are the Spirit.
Now believe that you are. Do not have diffidence

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.740
because you have failed so far, doesn’t
matter whatever has happened. Ultimately if

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.330
you find it, you find it. So second thing
you have to know, second thing you have to

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:44.330
know that you are the Spirit. This is the
second point, and I was, gradually, yesterday

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:51.860
strengthening your left side of which you
are not aware. Perhaps you think that you

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.589
are very egoistical. Some people think like
that and that this is the ego. But mostly

00:11:56.589 --> 00:12:02.110
whatever ego you had is also finished because
the way they were bumping at it, you see,

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:08.160
so it is [hurt ego?] and it may become a guilt
within you, [with?] “Oh, I should not have

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.670
done this, I should not have done this, I
should not have…” No use worrying about

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:17.910
these things. No use going back onto it. So
because of this, you see, the left side, which

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:24.829
is a very important side in Sahaja Yoga, is
affected and it starts right from the Swadhisthana,

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:30.730
in the Swadhisthana Chakra. As I told you
that I’m going to tell you about your chakras

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:37.730
but more related to the left side. Left side
as ... Gregoire has written a book “Advent”

00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:44.839
in which he describes it as the sin against
the Mother. And the right side he says the

00:12:44.839 --> 00:12:51.360
sin against the Father. Not the mother who
has given you the birth, but the Shakti, the

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:58.360
primordial Mother, the Power of God’s Love.
Sin against Her is the left side and the sin

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:04.070
against the Father is the right side. So countries
which are developing now like India, you see,

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.220
they are trying to develop into your style,
they are going to have plastics and nylons

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.899
and everything. Then they’ll take to drugs,
then they’ll become hippies and then this

00:13:12.899 --> 00:13:17.399
will happen and then I’ll have to give them
realization. Before going all these circles

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:21.610
they are not going to listen to Me. They don’t
want to short circuit it, you see, so let

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:26.269
them go ahead with it. They are now developing.
All these countries who are developing they

00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:31.800
should come and see you and meet you and know
what development has given you. This kind

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.769
of material ... you are understanding it so
well, but they will not. If you tell them

00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:40.920
[that?], they can’t believe it.    You
will be surprised when I go to India I have

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:46.240
to take nylon saris for them. Though we get
very beautiful silks in India, they don’t

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.529
think there’s much about it, you see. They
think why don’t You bring some nylons for

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:55.420
them. So this is what it is, you see, they
don’t understand. And this is the thing

00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.230
I told you that the Kundalini is in India
but they are not awakened. You people have

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:05.300
realized the value of matter. You people have
realized that matter doesn’t give you the

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:12.300
joy. You have to go beyond it, specially nylons
and plastics. At least this much you understand.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:20.700
But you go to any sophisticated Indian family,
they’ll give food in stainless steel. Though

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.360
they may have brass they think, “Oh, stainless
steel is great,” you see. All the rich people

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.120
will take out their stainless steel. Even
if they will have silver, they think stainless

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:34.550
steel is great. Can you imagine? So, this
is the state in which they are, while you

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:39.950
have reached that state where you do realize
the aesthetics, the aesthetics of the matter.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:46.950
Aesthetics of the matter you understand. So
you have in one side, on the right side, you

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:53.820
have achieved quiet a lot, I should say, and
you should be confident on that style at least

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:59.430
that you understand the worthlessness of all
these man-made things. [That?] something so

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:04.740
great to achieve that you want to have something
that is God-made. Once you come to that point

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:11.079
you should also know that if you have to have
realization it cannot be man-made it has to

00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:18.079
be God-made.    Now the left side is
important here so I’ll talk about left side.

00:15:18.329 --> 00:15:21.779
But you should not feel hurt about it because
I have to point it out to you to understand

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:26.450
the mistakes and the things which should not
be repeated. But the right side mistakes are

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.420
committed, as I told you, in the people who
are developing. So I [will?] mention you to

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.480
do that part what happens to the right side
when we commit mistakes on the right side.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:42.480
What we do is we don’t believe that there
is God, who is your Father. You forget that

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.920
there is Father above you. And He’s the
one who’s going to look after you. So you

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:54.269
don’t have to worry so much about earning
money by any crooked method or by any means

00:15:54.269 --> 00:16:01.269
without any values to earn money. To be worried
about money, to be worried about your wellbeing

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:09.260
is absurd. Krishna has said, “Yogakshema
vahamyaham.” He said, “You get your yoga.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.810
If you get your yoga, then you get your kshema”-
means your wellbeing. The other day somebody

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:19.980
asked Me, “What is the way to Lakshmi?”
Is first to get [to?] your yoga. Why didn’t

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.779
He say kshema yoga …. ? He said, “Yoga
kshema vahamyaham,” first yoga. First you

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:29.899
get united with your divine force and then
your wellbeing is looked after. It is looked

00:16:29.899 --> 00:16:34.470
after. Even if I tell you the stories of that,
you won’t believe to what extent it looks

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:40.699
after your kshema also. You don’t become
Mr. Ford because that’s madness. You become

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:47.699
a person who is provided for, who is looked
after and who never feels the dearth that

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:57.060
there is no money with you. That’s what
is, kshema is. In which your health improves,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.820
material things improve, everything improves
once you have got yoga which is promised by

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.159
Shri Krishna six thousand years back. I’m
not saying something new; it was said about

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:13.159
six thousand years back. So you become a realized
soul. By becoming realized soul you realize

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:19.289
that your Father God Almighty is the richest
man in the whole world. He has everything.

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:26.289
From where does it come? It comes from Him.
Riches that we think are riches are not really

00:17:26.419 --> 00:17:31.919
riches. The one He gives you, the one He provides
you are miraculous.    These are miraculous

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:37.379
things, and when it happens… I’ll give
you one example for this. Like in London,

00:17:37.379 --> 00:17:40.820
you see, we didn’t have any place for the
boys to live in and girls to live in, they

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:47.820
wanted to form an ashram. There was a lady
who bought a place because she had sold her

00:17:48.389 --> 00:17:53.239
place, she bought a place, adilapidated, ruined
place in Lambeth Vale. Of course you’ll

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:57.029
be surprised that William Blake has said,
because I laid the foundations there, and

00:17:57.029 --> 00:18:03.080
he said it that, “The foundations will be
laid in Lambeth Vale.” He said that, “England

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.749
is going to become Jerusalem.” And he said,
“In Lambeth Vale the foundations will be

00:18:08.749 --> 00:18:13.220
laid.” Imagine this William Blake and his
prophecies. I stayed first in Surrey Hills.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.379
He has written that, “The first beacons
will be lit in Surrey Hills.” Can you believe

00:18:17.379 --> 00:18:24.379
this man, how good he was in prophesying.
Whatever it is, this ashram could only provide

00:18:27.859 --> 00:18:32.590
rooms for very few boys and girls, and big
problem for them. So they said, “Mother,

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.799
we have to have some more places to live in,
and what are we to do?” I said, “All right,

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:43.799
now you pray for it. Just ask.” And a boy
came with an idea we should form a co-op.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.109
So they were not willing to form a co-op.
They said, “Mother, it takes ten years to

00:18:47.109 --> 00:18:51.859
get a nice place in co-op. It’s useless.”
I said, “If you say so, just go ahead.”

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:55.850
So they formed a co-op. Can you believe within
one month’s time they got a huge building

00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:02.729
with fifteen large bedrooms and big halls
and all that for them to stay, paying only

00:19:02.729 --> 00:19:09.729
seventy pounds for the whole building in one
week, can you imagine? Then after a month

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:18.609
they got a huge big, very,very big hotel with
all things there, beds and linen and cutlery

00:19:23.369 --> 00:19:30.369
and crockery and everything that you could
think of, paying only seventy pounds per week

00:19:30.639 --> 00:19:36.590
for all. Such a huge big thing where about
twenty-five people can easily live, and they

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:43.590
have got halls and basements and this and
that. We had sixteen marriages on the Krishna

00:19:44.109 --> 00:19:49.059
Ashtami day. And all these newly married couples
stayed in that hotel very nicely paying nothing,

00:19:49.059 --> 00:19:52.859
because you don’t need have to pay there.
But these boys [INAUDIBLE] I don’t know

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:59.629
what they did among themselves. But this is
what it is. This is the kshema. And, such

00:19:59.629 --> 00:20:06.629
beautiful atmosphere in that place. Everybody
enjoying the pure knowledge and the pure love.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:14.210
   Now, we are on the left hand side
and when I will discuss about the chakras,

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:21.210
I’ll be dealing, pertaining more to the
left side and not to the right side, which

00:20:22.279 --> 00:20:29.279
is the side, which we say is of material wellbeing
or say how do you get your physical wellbeing.

00:20:30.179 --> 00:20:37.179
You also get your physical wellbeing through
this.    Now as you see here, the first

00:20:54.099 --> 00:21:01.099
chakra is very important. Because you see
the connection is established with the left

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:09.950
hand side, is a very, very important center,
is the center of your innocence. The first

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:18.220
thing God created on this Earth was innocence.
And this innocence is embodied in a deity

00:21:22.989 --> 00:21:29.989
whom we call as Shri Ganesha. This deity was
created long, long time back, much before

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:41.200
anything started on this Earth. The omega
and the alpha as you can call it. And He incarnated

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:48.210
on this Earth as Lord Jesus Christ. I was
told that I have to be careful because there

00:21:48.729 --> 00:21:53.149
are many people who just don’t believe in
Jesus Christ. This is a very big conditioning

00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:59.129
of people because they are born in families
who don’t want to believe in Christ. Whether

00:21:59.129 --> 00:22:04.409
you like it or not, He exists. Not only He
exists but He’s the only one who can really

00:22:04.409 --> 00:22:11.409
give us the path from here.    So the
first one is the center of our innocence.

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:19.279
And this center of innocence was kept there
at a position where it manifests in the gross

00:22:22.979 --> 00:22:29.979
our pelvic plexus, which looks after the excretion
of the body. As there are four, we can say

00:22:30.889 --> 00:22:37.889
the petals of this subtle center, in the same
way there are four sub-plexuses for the pelvic

00:22:38.649 --> 00:22:45.529
plexus. I don’t know how many have done
medicine here. But the pelvic plexus has got

00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:52.529
four excretory sub-plexuses. One of them is
responsible for sex. Now the idea of sex that

00:22:55.379 --> 00:23:02.379
has come to us is from people like Mr., say,
Freud. Now look at his life. What sort of

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.679
a life he led. He had bad relations with his
own mother. He’s a perverted fellow. Secondly,

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:14.679
see, look at his [sense?]. In his own life
[you?] should see the light of a person. Then

00:23:14.849 --> 00:23:21.849
secondly that he had cancer for years together
and he died with cancer. So physically he

00:23:23.559 --> 00:23:30.559
was nonsensical, mentally he was a pervert.
Yes, I mean you must see the person whom you

00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:40.269
try to follow, all right. So, it’s so logical.
Now, you see his life as it is. He taught

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:49.440
you, “Oh, that if you try to condition yourself
about sex, and if you marry someone, and youare

00:23:49.499 --> 00:23:56.389
married to one person and then you are attached,
it’s conditioning of the society.” But

00:23:56.389 --> 00:24:03.389
he was half-baked. Because you are not only?
your left side, you see. If you say that,

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:10.029
“What’s wrong if I do this? What’s wrong
if I do that? What’s wrong if I do that?”

00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:16.889
If you go on like this, then you forget the
other side, which is the ego, which is the

00:24:16.889 --> 00:24:23.590
ego side. And then the ego side develops,
and then you can become a mad person. Then

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:30.590
your sex can be a problem. Today the sex of
modern people is such a problem. We should

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:38.139
face it. Perhaps you do not know that what
a percentage of American young people are

00:24:38.139 --> 00:24:44.349
impotent today. They are impotent. The more
you become impotent a viscous circle is created,

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:50.009
and to you sex becomes so important that you
think you have to become just a sex point.

00:24:50.009 --> 00:24:54.049
No more a human being but a sex point. All
the time you talk of sex, sex, sex, sex. What

00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:58.969
is the need? It is such a simple thing. Every
animal knows, everyone knows. Nobody is given

00:24:58.969 --> 00:25:04.849
education about it. In India we never talk
about it, we are producing much more children

00:25:04.849 --> 00:25:11.849
than you are producing here.   There’s
also another reason why we produce more children

00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:16.179
is: the load has to be on us, because children
don’t want to be born here. The conditions

00:25:16.179 --> 00:25:23.139
are so bad. In England two children are killed
... two children - can you believe it? ... it’s

00:25:23.139 --> 00:25:30.139
announced - two children are killed every
week by parents. I mean I can’t think of

00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:37.039
one parent in India who will do that- one!
And we have poverty, we have everything. But

00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:42.289
no mother can kill her own child, I mean,
even if she had twelwe children, she wouldn’t

00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:48.169
mind. Mind is not the thing, she loves them.
She can’t afford to lose even one child

00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:54.239
out of them. I mean it is another extreme
we have, like we can even sell our country

00:25:54.239 --> 00:25:58.309
for our children sake. We are to that limit.
You see, some of the people who are so attached

00:25:58.309 --> 00:26:01.309
to their children that they don’t mind.
For their children’s sake they can sell

00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:03.769
their country and that’s going to another
extreme.

00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:10.619
But, I must say that children would like to
be born in India, not here. So we are carrying

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:17.619
the load upon ourselves. But, the main thing
is our sex ideas are really being conditioned

00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:26.099
by this so-called deconditioner. When they
say, “Do not condition yourself,” actually

00:26:27.109 --> 00:26:34.109
they decondition you, they think, but they
are conditioning you much more by saying,

00:26:34.649 --> 00:26:41.649
“Do this, do that.” You see, sex, you
don’t have to run away from that. You don’t

00:26:42.759 --> 00:26:48.059
have to get out from that. Not at all. But
sane ideas must be developed about sex and

00:26:48.059 --> 00:26:54.729
you have to lead a very good married life.
Married life is the blessing, blessing of

00:26:54.729 --> 00:26:59.950
the Goddess on you. Is Gruha Lakshmi. The
way you treat your women, the women treat

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:04.700
you. I mean it’s a reaction, you see. The
men treated them so shabbily, now the women

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.190
are becoming mad here. I must say they are
getting mad. You can’t live without men.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:13.340
How can you live without them? It’s impossible.
If you think you can live without men, you

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:18.649
are sadly mistaken. It’s a wrong idea, you
cannot. And men can’t live without women.

00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:23.159
Now you might say there are people ... I was
amazed also, another amazing thing I heard

00:27:23.159 --> 00:27:30.159
was that sixty-five per cent people in California
are homosexuals. Is something shocking. Another

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:42.210
thing it is. Because it’s perversion. Now
why it happens?    I had a boy in New

00:27:43.349 --> 00:27:48.259
York who came to Me, who was like a boy, he
had mustaches, everything, was talking like

00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:53.519
a woman, you know. I said, “What’s wrong
with this fellow?” First I didn’t understand,

00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:57.099
you know, then they told Me, “Mother, he’s
something like that, it is that and that,

00:27:57.099 --> 00:28:02.979
that.” I said, “All right.” But actually
he was possessed by a woman. He was possessed

00:28:02.979 --> 00:28:08.019
by a woman. I removed that possession and
he said, “Now I feel like man,” and he

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:11.940
started walking in a different way all together.
He changed his gait and everything and he

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:18.190
was walking in a different way. Just imagine,
it was just a possession of a woman on him.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:25.190
So he was behaving like a woman and he was
seeking a company of a man instead of a woman

00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:33.029
which he should seek. That’s the normal
thing to do, and he became abnormal. Now when

00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:38.499
they became abnormal, nobody is there to protect
it, nobody is going to tell them that this

00:28:38.499 --> 00:28:44.950
is abnormal. This is nothing that you should
say, “This is sin, this is illegal.” Nobody

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:46.320
is going to listen to that. If you tell human
beings “This is wrong,” they will sit

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.899
on your head, they will never do it. Never
tell them “This is wrong.” Tell them “This

00:28:51.899 --> 00:28:56.190
is right, go ahead with it” and they’ll
suffer, they’ll come back. This is the way

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:02.769
our modern society is working towards you.
“All right, you want homosexuality? Permitted.

00:29:02.769 --> 00:29:09.659
You want killing? Permitted. Whatever you
want, you do it.” They have a feeling behind

00:29:09.659 --> 00:29:13.999
them that once you allow them to do what they
like, either they’ll be finished completely

00:29:13.999 --> 00:29:18.679
once for all, headache is gone, or once they
realize, they’ll come back to normalcy.

00:29:18.679 --> 00:29:25.159
I think this must be the basics for everybody
not going into it and finding out that sixty-five

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:31.779
per cent people are suffering from such an
absurd thing which is not at all joy giving,

00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:37.950
it’s never joy giving. It’s just ego pampering.
Because some women told Me, “Mother, these

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:43.089
men are so dominating and they are so horrid,
and that’s why we should not have anything

00:29:43.089 --> 00:29:48.609
to do with them. All right. And they try to
push us here and there and they try to harass

00:29:48.609 --> 00:29:52.659
us so we have nothing to do with them. We’ll
have ladies together.” I said, “That’s

00:29:52.659 --> 00:29:59.659
not the way. You should know how to handle
them.” They are very sweet. Oh, they are

00:30:00.309 --> 00:30:04.419
extremely sweet, you see, you should know
how to handle them. They are like children.

00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:08.499
Absolutely like children. But you have to
be a real mother to understand them. They

00:30:08.499 --> 00:30:14.169
are so sweet you can’t imagine. They are
extremely sweet and good people. Same about

00:30:14.169 --> 00:30:18.589
men, I would say, that the way they see the
women are sort of dominating them and all

00:30:18.589 --> 00:30:25.589
that. There are ways of handling the women
of that kind also. You can manage that. You

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.219
see, you have forgotten the sweet methods
of romance. You see, now the romance depends

00:30:30.219 --> 00:30:35.309
on the wig you wear. If a woman is wearing
a particular type of a wig, the man falls

00:30:35.309 --> 00:30:42.129
in love; she changes the wig, the love is
finished. These kind of artificial ideas if

00:30:42.129 --> 00:30:47.089
you have about your relationship with each
other - if it is the hair you like, if it

00:30:47.089 --> 00:30:53.969
is the eyes you like and all that - it will
not last. But the feeling that we belong to

00:30:53.969 --> 00:30:59.139
each other, just we belong to each other and
we have to love each other, then you don’t

00:30:59.139 --> 00:31:04.109
see these defects in each other, you don’t
find these problems, not at all. I mean, you

00:31:04.109 --> 00:31:09.529
need not be with your husband all the time
but you enjoy the separation and then you

00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:14.979
enjoy also the meeting. It’s not that if
you are away from him, then you are [posted?],it’s

00:31:14.979 --> 00:31:18.690
not at all. It’s a really sweet thing that
happens to you, and can happen to all of you

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:24.940
when you are realized. Once you are realized,
you come to such a normal position that the

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:30.059
whole thing normalizes, you see. bBecause
that’s an absolute point. That’s the thing

00:31:30.059 --> 00:31:35.749
that takes away all your imbalances, all your
problems and you really know what is love,

00:31:35.749 --> 00:31:40.009
what is enjoyment.    This Gregoire
is the one who came here, did all kinds of

00:31:40.009 --> 00:31:45.099
nonsensical things here, you know. Today he
was telling to Me, the other day that, “Mother,

00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:52.099
you are the master of fitting all the pieces
together in a very nice integrated manner.“

00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:58.919
And it’s true that it is the Spirit in you
that does that, it just brings back everything

00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:05.919
that [was?] looking so ugly and so disintegrated
into one beautiful [full?]. And all the romances

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.959
that you have heard of ... now he’s such
a romance for his wife, you know, he is so

00:32:09.959 --> 00:32:15.019
romantic that nobody can believe that he’s
a modern man. A modern man is not supposed

00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:22.019
to be romantic about his wife; he can be romantic
about anybody else’s wife, but not his own.

00:32:23.089 --> 00:32:30.089
   So this is the absurdity of our ideas
about love. This is [NOT CLEAR] your own.

00:32:33.719 --> 00:32:40.299
Why not enjoy your own things instead of enjoying
somebody else’s thing. Like in India, you

00:32:40.299 --> 00:32:42.969
see, supposing you get an Indian, he may be
a thug, he may come to your house and run

00:32:42.969 --> 00:32:47.580
away with your things, you know. May run away
with all your things, that you have [collected?].

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.769
But if you get another one, a western man
in the house, he’ll run away with your wife

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:56.709
only. You don’t know what he will do. He’ll
talk very sweetly and run away with a wife.

00:32:56.709 --> 00:33:00.359
And he will think, “Oh, I’ve done such
a great thing. She loves me.” And he is

00:33:00.359 --> 00:33:05.070
not bothered as to the whole system of the
family is finished, the whole thing is finished.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:09.389
Like we had one boy, a journalist, he was
twenty-six-year-old and his friend was twenty-four-year-old,

00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:16.389
and he invited the friend to his house. The
mother was forty-eight-year-old and she ran

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:20.929
away with the friend. And four children were
left behind, and the father didn’t know

00:33:20.929 --> 00:33:24.759
what to do. She had a divorce and she got
the house divided. The children are thrown

00:33:24.759 --> 00:33:29.700
to places. I mean this is absurd. How can
you do it? And she came to Me, “Oh, I’m

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:34.919
in love with him, Mother.” I said, “This
little boy who is younger to your son. How

00:33:34.919 --> 00:33:41.159
can you be in love? Are you mad?” She must
be mad to believe in such a thing. And the

00:33:41.159 --> 00:33:44.979
fellow was interested in her money, perhaps,
maybe. I don’t know what he was interested.

00:33:44.979 --> 00:33:48.559
But they were in love, supposed to be in love.
I don’t know what sort of a love is this

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:53.409
one. See, how can you be in love with your
great-grand-children. It’s absurd. You know

00:33:53.409 --> 00:33:58.649
this is so absurd, you see, these eighty-year-old
people trying to copy with you. Going in a

00:33:58.649 --> 00:34:02.859
pub and dancing like you with the shaking
hands and everything shaking and collapsing

00:34:02.859 --> 00:34:09.010
next moment. What is there to compete with
these young children? You are grown-up, you

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:15.950
are matured, you are sensible, you are sane
- enjoy that. It’s a funny thing, you see,

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:21.500
in these ... modernity ... we have gone very
much away from reality. That’s why we are

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:28.500
away from joy and enjoyment.    All
right, so this is it that sex is to be used

00:34:29.049 --> 00:34:36.049
for its right purpose and to be used at its
right point, means at the Mooladhara. Christ

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:43.240
said one thing. He said, it is written, ”Thou
shall not to commit adultery.” I say, “Thou

00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:49.329
shall not have adulterous eyes.” Because
He knew this would happen and He is placed

00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:56.329
at that point where He controls the eyes.
Nowadays we have started doing sex with our

00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:00.369
eyes, this flirting business. What do you
get out of it? Looking at this girl, looking

00:35:00.369 --> 00:35:04.730
at that girl, looking at this girl, that girl,
what are you getting? Your eyes are ruined,

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:10.920
Yyour attention is ruined. You are finished
and [fagged?] up. And by the time you have

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:17.029
seen twenty girls, you sit down and say, “Haah.”
This is the best way to age. And then you

00:35:17.029 --> 00:35:22.549
go to beauty clinics and try to look younger.
See, what is the need to look at these girls

00:35:22.549 --> 00:35:28.740
like this? They are all your sisters. Have
purity in your heart. There is no need to

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:33.539
waste your attention [so much?]. There is
no need to waste your attention. For an Indian

00:35:33.539 --> 00:35:40.000
would be looking at the things, and you will
be looking at the women or the men. You finish

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.269
your choice at a point. You finish it and
enjoy it. Even in guru shopping you do the

00:35:45.269 --> 00:35:52.269
same thing. You have come to Me now, I have
told you the truth. But tomorrow another guru

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:59.039
comes in, “Let’s go and have a look.”
If you have that kind of a frivolous idea

00:35:59.039 --> 00:36:04.690
about yourself, Sahaja Yoga is not going to
work out in you. You have to settle down with

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:10.579
it. You have to work it out. Your Spirit is
to be completely uncovered and is to be brought

00:36:10.579 --> 00:36:15.829
into complete consciousness of yours. You
should really become the master. Unless and

00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:19.799
until you are master, you should not give
in. And don’t go to these people just to

00:36:19.799 --> 00:36:24.829
look at them because you spoil your attention.

00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:31.829
So doing sex with your thinking leads you
to impotency. If you have to eat food with

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:39.029
your mouth, you start eating with your nose,
the mouth will be finished because it’s

00:36:39.029 --> 00:36:44.430
frozen and the nose will be finished too,
and you won’t be eating either. Whatever

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:50.240
things have to do, whatever ways, you should
allow that organ to work out that thing. So

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.510
that’s why the spontaneity in sex is lost.
You think about it, plan about it. How can

00:36:55.510 --> 00:37:01.160
you plan, I just can’t understand. You plan
about everything that is so spontaneous and

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:07.160
that’s why there is such a problem. And
people talk here as if sex is something out

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:13.809
of the blue. It is just there, it exists and
you don’t have to learn about it. It is

00:37:13.809 --> 00:37:19.390
all there. And to talk about it also it is
not necessary. It is your own private. It’s

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:24.339
absolutely private and sacred thing between
you and your wife. That’s all. Nothing beyond,

00:37:24.339 --> 00:37:29.470
nothing before. It’s a very sacred thing.
The more sacred it is the more you enjoy it.

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:35.299
I’ve known people in India who are ninety
years of age and still very potent. One gentleman

00:37:35.299 --> 00:37:40.390
came to tell Me that, “Mother, my wife has
died and I’m still … I don’t know.”

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:45.099
I said, “It’s all right.” I told him,
“How do you manage?” He said, “I’m

00:37:45.099 --> 00:37:50.269
living ... in her separation I’m living.”
That’s how they live. And they manage themselves.

00:37:50.269 --> 00:37:55.260
While here the people at a very young age
just become exhausted and finished.   So

00:37:55.260 --> 00:38:00.890
we have to understand that in Sahaja Yoga,
you try, it will work out. It works out. Also

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:06.180
gradually your attention will be stationed.
You will be very much in the center and you

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:11.190
will develop your innocence in such a beautiful
manner. You get back your innocence [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:18.029
Can you believe it? [Completely?] you become
so innocent and so simple that you are amazed

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:19.250
at yourself.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:24.150
Your innocence is there as far as money is
concerned, no doubt still you are intact on

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:28.630
that point. On that point Indians are not.
You are innocent as far as material things

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:32.490
are concerned. For example, you don’t mind
giving all the money to these horrible gurus

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:39.430
as long as you get your realization. But there
I think innocence is not stupidity. How can

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:44.589
you give money for your realization? I mean
it’s a simple thing. You must understand

00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:49.890
you cannot pay money for your realization,
one thing you must understand. Anybody who

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:53.789
says, “Now I’ve got vibrations.” Some
people go to someone and feel heated up. Then

00:38:53.789 --> 00:38:59.160
they want feeling heated up more and more
and more. This heat is coming from that man

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:04.660
and is going to increase your heat all the
time, and it is going to increase and increase

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.170
and increase and your chakras are going to
be ruined completely by this [fellow?]. It

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:15.000
has to be reduced. It has to come to the cooling
point, and you must feel the cooling point.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.000
If you cannot feel the cooling point, then
you must know that this man is absolutely

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.619
wrong.

00:39:23.619 --> 00:39:29.079
When you are feeling heat here, now for example,
it is because the cleansing is taking place.

00:39:29.079 --> 00:39:35.339
Once the cleansing is over the cool breeze
must flow in, and you must feel the cool breeze.

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:41.079
Now some people might feel absolutely cold,
just like frozen. That’s also not a good

00:39:41.079 --> 00:39:45.119
sign; that means you are left-sided .Some
of you may feel that kind of a thing. It’s

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:50.019
not the feeling the cold is the point, is
the feeling the cool breeze, is a breeze like

00:39:50.019 --> 00:39:55.910
feeling that you get. From My photograph also
you will get. That’s the way you have to

00:39:55.910 --> 00:40:01.680
judge yourself. You judge yourself, establish
yourself, keep your chakras clean and you’ll

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:07.349
be amazed how you become a master of the whole
art. You will be able to give realization,

00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:13.710
each one of you to thousands of people.    So
now in the second chakra when we come, I would

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:19.410
say is the chakra of your seeking. And we
call that as the second chakra, because the

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:26.410
third chakra comes out of it. Is the chakra
in which you seek. It starts from very, very

00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:36.589
beginning when you were a human being you
did not realize that you came to this stage

00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:44.609
in thousands and thousands and thousands of
years. First of all as any animal what you

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:52.680
do is to seek God in food. You just seek food.
You are seeking food and you want to eat,

00:40:55.329 --> 00:41:02.329
and the whole thing is at Nabhi level, is
at this point where you are just seeking the

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:07.420
food, how to nourish yourselves, how to look
after yourselves. The second seeking later

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:13.940
on starts. Some of the animals start becoming
more alert by understanding that you have

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:20.519
to be more intellect, so they start seeking
in power. They want to empower other animals

00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:26.009
and try to overcome them so that they can
eat them, so they seek in power. Then the

00:41:26.009 --> 00:41:32.650
seeking goes even subtler and subtler, that
they start seeking in money, as human being

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.710
starts seeking in money, in possessions and
things. Animals don’t have possessions,

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:39.880
thank God. Because possessions means headache.
You have to have insurance, you have to have

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:45.470
this, you have to have that. So the human
beings start getting the possessions and all

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:52.079
these things and they start going into this
seeking. But the last and the foremost seeking

00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:57.970
is of the very evolved, is the seeking of
the Spirit, the seeking of God. This is the

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:04.670
real thing that should happen to us. When
you are at that point, at that point of maturity,

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:11.670
then this happening takes place.    Now
the other center that is coming out of that

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:19.250
one is - actually it’s not shown here but
it comes out of that - is the center called

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:26.250
as Swadhisthana, is the center by which you
think, you organize for the future. You think,

00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:35.609
you organize for the future, you work out
your action through it. Like we think, think,

00:42:36.569 --> 00:42:41.920
think, think all the time what we do is nothing
but think. I mean planning is such a curse

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.809
that we don’t do anything about it, we just
plan and keep it in the book.”Oh, we have

00:42:45.809 --> 00:42:49.660
planned it.” They think, “We have planned
it,” it’s done already. It’s not so.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:56.660
Now this thinking gives us a realm of future
into which we enter in. When we start thinking,

00:42:57.109 --> 00:43:04.109
we do not know how we imbalance ourselves.   In
this area resides the principle of the Primordial

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:15.099
Masters as Gregoire has told you. Now, when
you start thinking, this center - the one

00:43:15.099 --> 00:43:22.099
you see, the yellow colored center - transforms
the fat from your stomach for the use of your

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:28.849
brain. Now people are so much against fat
these days that it would be really dangerous

00:43:28.849 --> 00:43:35.849
to talk for it. Now from where are you to
get the replacement of your brain cells, tell

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:44.059
Me, if you are not going to consume any fat?
As it is your livers are out so whatever fat

00:43:44.059 --> 00:43:50.640
you take, you take any amount of fat, you
will not have any weight, try, because that

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:57.599
fat is the reserve for your brain which thinks
all the time. Do you know that this brain

00:43:57.599 --> 00:44:03.799
is made of fat cells? Do you know this or
not? Is nothing but fat cells. In Sanskrit

00:44:03.799 --> 00:44:10.009
it’s called as the medh. And the whole thing
is called medhi, even the brain. Even your

00:44:10.009 --> 00:44:17.009
nerves are made of the fat cells. Now when
you don’t take it, any form of fat, any

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:23.970
form of fat whatsoever ... I mean I’m told
that lots of butter is lying here wasted.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:29.490
I don’t say you eat the mountain of it,
no, no. What I’m saying if you don’t take

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:35.349
it at all any fat, then what you do is to
make your body starve for the fat that is

00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:41.619
needed for one of the purposes is the brain
and for your nerves. If you don’t take fat

00:44:41.619 --> 00:44:46.789
in the body you will be a nervous person.
What is the supplement for your nerves? What

00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:51.349
are you going to supply? That’s why you
find, you see, mostly to make it out a westerner

00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:57.690
and an Indian is very easy. You make them
stand before any calamity. All right. Indian

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:03.440
will be silently watching. The another would
be going into complete this “Haa, haa, huu,

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.390
huu, hee.” Everything will be coming out,
or the eyes will be twisting, the nose will

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.839
be going up and down and ears will be going
out like that. They’llbe all nervous. The

00:45:11.839 --> 00:45:18.390
reason is your nerves do not have any sustenance
in it. That’s lost because you just don’t

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:23.759
take any fat. Take little bit, I’m not saying
the mountains, you see, if I say something,

00:45:23.759 --> 00:45:29.529
you may jump into the mountain of fat. That’s
not the point. But just to avoid completely

00:45:29.529 --> 00:45:36.529
the fat is a wrong idea - creates an imbalance.
Now this poor center has to do double job.

00:45:37.059 --> 00:45:44.059
Firstly it has to supply the fat to the brain,
secondly it has to look after your liver on

00:45:44.799 --> 00:45:51.799
the right hand side, when it moves to the
left hand side your pancreas, your spleen,

00:45:52.269 --> 00:45:59.269
your kidneys and uterus.   All these
things this poor thing has to do. Now if you

00:46:00.099 --> 00:46:04.970
are thinking, thinking, thinking all the time,
then it is trying to find out all the fat

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:11.420
[globules?] it can get from everywhere to
supply [them?] in the brain. All right. And

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:18.420
if it does not get that, then it is a dangerous
thing. But even if it gets it, then it is

00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:23.710
creating a problem for the other organs which
it has to look after. That’s how people

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:28.769
get diabetes. You don’t get diabetes because
you eat sugar. Is a wrong idea altogether.

00:46:28.769 --> 00:46:34.940
I don’t know for why the doctors have started
this kind of a thing. For example, in India

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:41.940
people take sugars at least half a kilo of
sugar per day in the villages, at least minimum.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:50.299
They eat more sugar than they eat rice, take
it from Me. But nobody has diabetes. Why?

00:46:50.299 --> 00:46:57.299
Because they don’t think. Whatever sugar
they take is used for their liver. Now if

00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:12.069
you do not give your liver any sugar ... now
ask anyone ... How the liver acts? Liver is

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:19.690
the one that takes out all your poison. Now
this poison is to be taken out of the liver

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:27.150
by water. Now if you take the water and drink
on top of that, what happens that the hydrogen

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:35.119
becomes heavier, I mean there’s H3 added
to it and the whole system of H2O which has

00:47:35.119 --> 00:47:41.240
to be neutral becomes like this, and you can’t
receive any heat into it. So the whole heat,

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.390
which is the poison, accumulates in the liver,
you get all kinds of liver problems, all kinds

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:50.710
of liver problems. Practically most of the
western people have liver problems but they

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:56.900
don’t know it till they discover it. Till
they are absolutely on the verge of something

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:03.900
very fatal, they do not discover about liver.
Now this hydrogen which pulls it down, you

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:11.130
see, becomes like an arrow, doesn’t receive
anything from the liver, the heat, and such

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:17.700
a person never gets any temperature. Even
cancer acts the same way. In cancer also,

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:22.210
the H goes down very much though it’s a
left-sided problem, which I’ll tell you.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:28.369
But same thing happens that the heat of the
body cannot be taken out by water. So the

00:48:28.369 --> 00:48:35.339
water becomes a heavy water, you can say.
But after realization, the hydrogen goes up

00:48:35.339 --> 00:48:40.420
like that. And you receive all the heat, and
people who have bad liver feel terrible heat

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:47.420
on the right hand side.    Now you have
to take carbohydrates to neutralize that heat.

00:48:49.119 --> 00:48:54.079
You have to take carbohydrates. Now, if you
don’t like sugar, eat rice. I mean if there’s

00:48:54.079 --> 00:48:59.029
some sort of a thing on your head. This also
is an enterprise, I must tell you, these food

00:48:59.029 --> 00:49:04.819
stores are also another enterprise which is
very, very subtle. Very subtle enterprise.

00:49:04.819 --> 00:49:11.079
You see, as you had other enterprises of the
gurus. Then you had of holidays, you see.

00:49:11.079 --> 00:49:14.670
Some idea must have come. Then this hip … what
you [call it?] singers, musicians, [who were?]

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:20.920
four of them, Beatles. You know the one who
created them, Beatles, his uncle has told

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:27.740
Me the story how he did it. It was all maneuvering
to begin with, and that maneuvering made people

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:33.619
mad. And that madness is still on. You see,
people go on into that. It’s all auto-suggestion

00:49:33.619 --> 00:49:37.289
and all those things they work it out, they
are psychologists, you see. And they know

00:49:37.289 --> 00:49:41.180
how to maneuver people and how to dominate
them. They know. And they [maneuver?] it.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:46.859
They work it out on your weaknesses like you
do not [know about?] food. Now some of the

00:49:46.859 --> 00:49:53.549
health food I ate, it was not for human beings,
it was for buffalos, I felt. Really. Some

00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:58.380
of the foods were so hard and so harsh, I
got such a pain in My stomach. I said, “Now

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:03.190
this is not for human beings, this is for
buffalos.” You are not buffalos. You are

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:07.829
human beings, you have to eat food which is
digestible to your stomach. Of course, that

00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:11.769
doesn’t mean you should use this white bread
- of course, that is not the thing - which

00:50:11.769 --> 00:50:17.349
makes your liver completely sort of ... or
you can say the intestines sluggish. But you

00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:23.960
should not eat all the harder, of such a hard
things like everything you cut because you

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:29.119
want to preserve the vitamins. You will cut
everything and eat everything like that. Japanese

00:50:29.119 --> 00:50:33.999
are the worst [on this?]. Japanese are the
worst. I mean there is nothing that they don’t

00:50:33.999 --> 00:50:39.230
eat. They eat everything that you could think
of. I mean you can’t eat the food the way

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:43.839
they eat. First thing they served Me on a
very special banquet, where the princess was

00:50:43.839 --> 00:50:49.569
there and all that, was a shell with all these
moss around it. You see, for us Indians as

00:50:49.569 --> 00:50:54.599
it is a little fussy about these things and,
My daughter said, “What is in there?”

00:50:54.599 --> 00:50:58.369
[INAUDIBLEAnd they said, “live thing”.?]
I said, “live.” We were all frightened,

00:50:58.369 --> 00:51:02.779
“What is live?” They said oyster or something
is live inside. And they poked it and it started

00:51:02.779 --> 00:51:06.910
doing like that and, you see. Oh God, how
do you eat it? And the Japanese just twisted

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:12.990
it out and ate it off, you see. And they eat
everything wrong. There was a boy who was

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:17.190
eating peanuts. We asked him, “What are
you eating?” He said, “I’m eating these

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:23.499
frogs. He was just peeling them up and eating
them nicely. Can you imagine? This is the

00:51:23.499 --> 00:51:28.319
way they eat their food which is not meant
for the human body. You have to cook, but

00:51:28.319 --> 00:51:34.999
your women are so busy with liberation, they
don’t cook. They don’t cook. You should

00:51:34.999 --> 00:51:40.400
learn to cook to handle your husbands. You
see, if you know how to cook, it’s very

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:47.400
simple.    In our Sahaja Yoga center
we teach them how to cook, because if you

00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:54.130
know cooking [you are the master?]. You see,
people are, men are really so simple [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:58.569
I cook very well, I’m an excellent cook
I should say. But a gentleman came to see

00:51:58.569 --> 00:52:05.119
Me, he was a German and he told Me that there
was one chairman of a [car company?], that

00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:09.519
he told me, “If you want to eat the best
chicken, ask Mrs. Srivastava to cook” - that’s

00:52:09.519 --> 00:52:14.529
My another name - “and She’s an excellent
cook.” I was surprised to have this reputation

00:52:14.529 --> 00:52:20.109
all over that I cook so well chicken. And
he came all the way, you see, and he brought

00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:26.029
the chicken with him. And he came all the
way to cook with Me and to eat it and he was

00:52:26.029 --> 00:52:30.759
a very big man also himself. I was amazed,
you see, that just to learn how to cook the

00:52:30.759 --> 00:52:34.920
chicken. He said, “My wife doesn’t know
how to cook.” Just imagine how helpless

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:41.410
he was. All men are helpless as far as food
is concerned. If you give them good food,

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:45.369
you see ... they may say, “Oh, we can eat
whatever we like,” but it’s not so. If

00:52:45.369 --> 00:52:50.079
you know their taste and things and if you
know how to handle them, it’s very easy

00:52:50.079 --> 00:52:54.619
to handle them. Like, somebody told Me, “Indian
men are very great cowards.” I said, “Why?”

00:52:54.619 --> 00:52:58.480
“Because they don’t know how to cook that’s
why they don’t divorce.” Imagine to say

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:03.329
such a thing. It’s not that. They are very
wise. What’s the use of changing every day

00:53:03.329 --> 00:53:06.890
a wife, you see. One wife is ... she knows
all about your habits, she knows everything,

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:12.380
she knows how to cook for you. It’s a good
idea, we carry on very well as companions.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:17.049
Every time if you change, God knows, she may
come as a shrew, she may come as anything.

00:53:17.049 --> 00:53:20.420
You may lose your head with somebody, another
may break your hand and another may break

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:25.759
your leg. It’s better to know one and handle
her for this lifetime so next time at least

00:53:25.759 --> 00:53:32.490
you don’t face that type. It’s very simple
and wise way of living together, to understand

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:38.480
that in one lifetime only if you live with
one person, you develop that love, that attention,

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:43.220
that understanding because human being basically
are very good. If you live with somebody for

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:48.319
two days, you will just see the superficial
things of that person. That may not be good.

00:53:48.319 --> 00:53:53.470
So to get to the depth of a person is necessary
you live with that person with a loving care,

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:57.660
you see that person and you will discover
how beautiful that person is.    He’s

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:04.410
so beautiful sometimes that you are surprised
at [INAUDIBLE]. The other day I had to go

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:08.359
for something to a hospital. I mean, I never
go to a hospital, but something happened and

00:54:08.359 --> 00:54:12.700
doctors were after my life, “You must do
this, You must do that.” And My husband

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:16.380
couldn’t see that, you see, he was so upset.
He had never seen Me like that. So he went

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:20.789
back to his office, he put his head like this
and he was sitting there, didn’t do any

00:54:20.789 --> 00:54:23.789
work or anything. When he came back, I was
angry with him. I said, “What do you mean

00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:28.220
by not being here. I was here and there were
other people and ...” But actually I knew

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:32.200
what he was doing. So I went and told him,
“I know you ran away, you coward, you couldn’t

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:36.529
stand here.” He said, “It’s true, you
know, I couldn’t see it.” And then his

00:54:36.529 --> 00:54:40.329
secretary told Me, “Oh, he was horrid. He
wouldn’t talk to me, he wouldn’t allow

00:54:40.329 --> 00:54:45.430
me to do anything.” That’s what happened.
So, to understand a man ... is such a great

00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:51.450
thing to love. I don’t know if you realize
that. Is such a great thing to love, to give.

00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:56.220
It’s much greater than to have. Giving,
I don’t know if you have tried or not. All

00:54:56.220 --> 00:55:00.890
My life, I’ve done nothing but giving. And
I think I feel so happy about it. The real

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:06.349
source of happiness lies in giving only not
in taking [anything?]. It’s such a great

00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:11.039
thing to give, give, give, give. And you’ll
be amazed you’ll have no dearth of it. That

00:55:11.039 --> 00:55:15.950
is what one has to understand. But to think
about what things I should preserve, what

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:21.150
things I should give. What is there to think?
If somebody likes it, have it. Doesn’t matter.

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:28.150
It works out.    Now, the second center
is also of the Lakshmi center, because you

00:55:29.369 --> 00:55:35.529
asked Me how to get the Lakshmi. Now this
is the center of Lakshmi, because Lakshmi

00:55:35.529 --> 00:55:42.529
is the deity of this center. And the deity
actually, who is the male side of it, the

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:49.980
one who is the kinetic side. The power is
the potential side and the kinetic side is

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:56.720
the male side. So, Laskhmi is the power of
Narayana. Narayana is the deity, whom you

00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:02.710
call as Vishnu. That’s why Vishnu only incarnates.
Because He comes for our seeking, He incarnates.

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:09.640
He incarnates to give us our higher awareness.
Always the Vishnu incarnates for the aspects

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:16.640
of the human [kind?]. And that’s how we
have been evolving one after another. For

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:23.539
example, when Noah’s ark was built, it was
Vishnu who came in the form of a dolphin fish

00:56:23.539 --> 00:56:29.440
and saved that Noah’s ark. And that’s
how we were saved. Then a tortoise form it

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:36.440
came in, to make the fishes come to the shore
and start crawling on the Mother Earth. Like

00:56:36.509 --> 00:56:41.519
that a leader is always born, and that leader
is the aspect of God, is the incarnation.

00:56:41.519 --> 00:56:46.269
Now, many may say, “We don’t believe in
it.” So many are like that, “We don’t

00:56:46.269 --> 00:56:48.630
believe in it, don’t believe in that, don’t
believe in that. We believe in this and we

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:55.630
believe in this.” Now how can you say that?
First of all know that you say this because

00:56:56.900 --> 00:57:00.289
you are conditioned for something. You have
a fixation. When you say “I believe in it”

00:57:00.289 --> 00:57:05.529
or you say “I don’t believe in it”,
you have not reached your absolute awareness,

00:57:05.529 --> 00:57:11.269
have you? How can we judge? You cannot judge.
So, you have to become that. Once you become

00:57:11.269 --> 00:57:15.200
that, you just put your hands and ask the
question, “Was Vishnu an incarnation? Was

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.489
[He?] the aspect of incarnation that gives
us our realization?” You’ll start getting

00:57:19.489 --> 00:57:26.489
more breeze and more breeze. And then you
will know that it is so. But this fact about

00:57:26.539 --> 00:57:32.650
Vishnu, that He exists, you will only know
after your realization. When you raise the

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:38.930
Kundalini, and if the Kundalini stops at this
point of Nabhi, then you have to take His

00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:44.499
name. If you don’t take His name, it won’t
rise. That’s why the mantra is a very big

00:57:44.499 --> 00:57:50.119
science. To know first of all how the Kundalini
is moving. You can say the mantra is like

00:57:50.119 --> 00:57:56.269
- give it very gross example - is like a toll
that you pay at every point. So, when you

00:57:56.269 --> 00:58:02.259
go up to a gate, now you have to pass through
that, then you pay a toll. But somebody gives

00:58:02.259 --> 00:58:06.940
you a mantra before realization, it has no
meaning. Because you have not started moving

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:13.069
as yet. If your car has not started moving
as yet, how can you pay the toll? Whom are

00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:18.670
you paying the toll? You are just paying the
toll to the guru who is nonsensical. You have

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:24.339
to go to that point where your Kundalini has
stopped. Which you can see yourself and feel

00:58:24.339 --> 00:58:29.539
it. And then at that point, you have to raise
the Kundalini higher by saying that particular

00:58:29.539 --> 00:58:34.109
mantra. Then at higher level and at higher
level. How the mantra is to be said there

00:58:34.109 --> 00:58:40.739
is a science. This all can become yours in
no time at all. In within one month’s time

00:58:40.739 --> 00:58:46.420
you all will be experts of Sahaja Yoga. Take
it from Me. When I went to Australia, I was

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:53.420
hardly there for a month I think, and within
fifteen days, you see, these people from television

00:58:53.499 --> 00:58:57.259
and all that they came to see Me.
And they said, ”re Your disciples all scholars?”

00:58:57.259 --> 00:59:00.319
I said, “Not at all. Who told you they are
scholars?”

00:59:00.319 --> 00:59:04.930
“Oh, they know so much!”
I said, ”Because they have become knowledge

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:09.210
now.” You start learning from others when
you start giving Kundalini awakening and all

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:13.210
that. You start learning what’s happening,
where is it going, how it is working out,

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:17.319
how to maneuver. Unless and until you start
driving the car, how will you become the master

00:59:17.319 --> 00:59:24.319
of the car? In the same way, you have to know
everything, working it out, not thinking about

00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:29.599
it. Then people start analyzing: how can this
be, how can that be? It’s not analysis,

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:35.049
is actual working. Actually you work it out.
The thing flows from your hand, and you are

00:59:35.049 --> 00:59:39.150
amazed, “Oh God, the Kundalini is rising!”
Yes, you can see it’s come up. You can give

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:41.299
realization. Those who got realization yesterday,
today you can give realization. What do you

00:59:41.299 --> 00:59:48.299
say to that? You are that fantastic. You are
that fantastic. That know, that you should

00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:56.410
not be shifty people. They say that Americans
are very, very shifty people. And be careful

00:59:56.690 --> 01:00:02.160
of this character. [So?See?] everybody has
a sign. Like that, you have a sign that you

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:09.160
are shifty. While English are hard nuts. So,
be careful. Do not be shifty. Settle down

01:00:10.049 --> 01:00:17.049
on your own Spirit. Work it out. Learn about
it and fix it up.    I’m happy to

01:00:18.779 --> 01:00:23.200
see Michael has come all the way from Los
Angeles. I was sorry I couldn’t ring you.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.519
The other day I was feeling very sorry. [And
to?] see you here I was so [heart-contended?]

01:00:26.519 --> 01:00:32.039
and so happy that you have come here to work
it out. You see, that’s how it should be.

01:00:32.039 --> 01:00:37.569
All right. So, then we go, I mean there’s
so much to be said about every center. And

01:00:37.569 --> 01:00:43.119
you know that I have given at least five hundred
lectures in London alone. And there are tapes

01:00:43.119 --> 01:00:47.749
of My lectures. These are available. I mean
we don’t make any profits as usual, but

01:00:47.749 --> 01:00:51.349
you must [also not?] exploit us by taking
the free tapes. You should pay for the tape

01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:55.779
itself, all right, the price of the tapes,
and you can get the tapes from these people.

01:00:55.779 --> 01:01:00.109
We’ll send you. You can copy it and give
it to others the way you want to spread it.

01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:05.109
You can do it. There’s no restriction on
anything, but one thing is definite that you

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:10.119
should not sell it at the profit. As I do
not sell it for profit, you also don’t sell

01:01:10.119 --> 01:01:14.960
it for profit. There is no exploitation of
the disciple and no exploitation of the poor

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:21.549
Guru Who is standing before you.    Now,
before we go to the another center which is

01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:25.440
very important within us. Is the center ... I
don’t think I’ll be able to finish it

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:31.289
today, the whole thing, but at this point
I’ll stop, and tomorrow I’ll talk about

01:01:31.289 --> 01:01:37.559
these two other centers and the Spirit. All
right? Tonight, I’m sorry, tonight. So,

01:01:37.559 --> 01:01:44.559
this center is the center of heart. Here the
Jagadamba, the Mother of the Universe resides.

01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:54.579
The one who is alone. She’s alone. She doesn’t
have any male deity with Her. She’s alone.

01:01:54.849 --> 01:01:59.710
She’s the Mother. And She looks after the
people who are struggling in this ocean of

01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:05.009
illusion. She’s the one who is the protector.
She incarnates. It’s said that She has incarnated

01:02:05.009 --> 01:02:11.829
thousand times but She has incarnated [million?]
times. Now this Jagadamba is the one who resides

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:18.119
there at that point. And when you are a child,
say about twelwe years of age, She creates

01:02:18.119 --> 01:02:24.229
the antibodies in the sternum bone. And these
antibodies spread into the whole body and

01:02:24.229 --> 01:02:30.930
protect you from the outer problems. Now,
those people who have the problem of this,

01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:37.930
especially in ladies, comes from insecurities
in life. If you are insecure, then you get

01:02:38.299 --> 01:02:45.299
the palpitation and such women at the extreme
can develop breast cancer. If you can re-establish

01:02:46.289 --> 01:02:52.269
this, breast cancer can be cured in no time.
   Now the other centers which are important,

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:57.960
this is of the Father and the Mother on both
the sides. Now the Father, is on the right

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:04.960
hand side, is the one by Shri Rama. Shri Rama
and Sita who came on this earth. They are

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.759
not standing in the center, so you can see
it very clearly that They are not worried

01:03:10.759 --> 01:03:15.630
about the evolution part of it. But They came
on this earth to establish the right conduct

01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:22.049
of a person especially in the political and
economic field of life. How to be an ideal

01:03:22.049 --> 01:03:28.739
a philosopher or you can say a benevolent
king? He tried to establish the symbol of

01:03:28.739 --> 01:03:34.299
that, Shri Rama. And those people who suffer
from father’s problem – supposing the

01:03:34.299 --> 01:03:38.979
father has died very early - they have this
problem. And the symptom of that is you get

01:03:38.979 --> 01:03:44.099
asthma. You develop asthma. If you have any
problem of the father, if your father has

01:03:44.099 --> 01:03:49.180
died early or your father is torturing you
or you have no respect for your father, if

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:53.519
you are a bad father, I mean, the fatherhood
itself, when it is challenged, you get these

01:03:53.519 --> 01:04:00.089
problems and asthma develops. Asthma, what
you call that, a breathing problems. It could

01:04:00.089 --> 01:04:06.220
be with the combination of that right side
heart and also Vishuddhi, but mostly it is

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:10.630
the right side heart. It could combine with
the Vishuddhi.

01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:17.509
Now, the left hand side is the Mother’s
thing, is the Parvati, is the wife of Sadashiva,

01:04:17.509 --> 01:04:24.509
which resides there in Her form as the Mother
Annapoorna or She is the one who is the giver

01:04:25.229 --> 01:04:32.210
of food. She gives you food. When She is in
you, you find that if you cook for two people,

01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:39.210
it will last for as many as who want to eat
that. It’s like that. This is the deity

01:04:39.229 --> 01:04:46.229
that comes when it is awakened it works out.
Now when this Swadhisthana Chakra is governed

01:04:47.339 --> 01:04:52.309
by Brahmadeva and Saraswati. Those who are
students, for them it is essential to get

01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:59.309
this, because they are the Gods and Goddesses
of your arts like music, dancing and all those

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:06.979
things. Also, they give you the power of truth
in the sense that if you have a good Swadhisthana,

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:17.200
then if you say something, it comes out true.
Your vani, means your tongue, your vani, your

01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:25.549
voice, your tongues that you speak becomes
the truth. Is the power of this one. With

01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:31.729
the Lakshmi Tattwa, as I told you, you get
your affluence. Wherever you go, you bring

01:05:31.729 --> 01:05:36.950
affluence. You go to any house, people get
affluence. You touch anything, people become

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:43.329
better off, all the problems go out. And if
you have problems on this, whatever you may

01:05:43.329 --> 01:05:48.690
try, you will never get rich. It will be always
a problem and you’ll have sort of losses

01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:54.319
and things like that.    Now the left
side Nabhi is the Nabhi which you catch very

01:05:54.319 --> 01:06:00.150
often here because of drugs. Now I must warn
you that left side Nabhi gives you also problem

01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:05.710
with money. Always with money. Because if
you have got left side problem, the Lakshmi

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:10.729
just disappears. She just disappears. If you
go more on to the left hand side it is even

01:06:10.729 --> 01:06:15.869
worse. So alcoholism and all these things
take you to a state where you start losing

01:06:15.869 --> 01:06:22.869
money and you can become very much poor with
that. So the poverty comes in with that kind

01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:29.309
of thing. The right side Nabhi is the one
that gives you liver problems and gives you

01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:35.859
a very dominating nature, maybe, or a temperament
by which you get very much angry. Left side

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:41.589
Nabhi has another very serious problem, which
is a very serious one, where if your spleen

01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:46.930
gets affected, for example people who are
very jerky type, they are having their food

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:51.450
then they are running to the work. This can
happen to the people who are right-sided also,

01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:55.729
because they are very speedy people. They
are working and then they want to eat the

01:06:55.729 --> 01:07:00.979
food at the same time, think about something.
They attend to many things at the same time.

01:07:00.979 --> 01:07:07.979
And this spleen has to look after all the
emergencies and has to supply the blood cells.

01:07:10.339 --> 01:07:14.930
Because of this kind of a frantic temperament
of a person, what happens is the spleen becomes

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:21.559
frantic, and then the serious disease like
blood cancer comes in. Moreover this is nothing,

01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:27.910
because there is an anti-Christ, who has come
in this country, settled down here. He’s

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:34.069
a regular 666 who gives you also blood cancer.
So it’s a very serious thing and all these

01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:41.069
things only takes place when you are not aware
of it. You do not know. It can be cured completely

01:07:41.609 --> 01:07:45.119
with Sahaja Yoga, no doubt. It can be cured
by your Kundalini awakening. That’s the

01:07:45.119 --> 01:07:48.999
only way you can cure, Sahaja Yoga. There
is no other way out. But you have to first

01:07:48.999 --> 01:07:53.809
of all know how to manage your Kundalini,
how to raise it. But the first thing you have

01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:58.839
to do is to give up some of your fixations
you have because it’s a new venue you are

01:07:58.839 --> 01:08:04.430
entering into. And like any scientist you
should keep yourself open, absolutely open,

01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:11.430
and see for yourself and know for yourself
that you have to understand everything, everything

01:08:12.819 --> 01:08:18.690
in such a way that it should be logical. It
should be logical and through your vibratory

01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:24.009
awareness, not by your thinking. First you
understand it and logically you will see it

01:08:24.009 --> 01:08:29.509
is true.    So it is you who judge yourself,
it is you who understand everything, it is

01:08:29.509 --> 01:08:36.380
you who grow and it is you the one who grows,
sees also things. So I leave it to you, all

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:41.949
these things to happen to you. Within your
own wisdom and in your own freedom all these

01:08:41.949 --> 01:08:46.989
things should be done. But just now I won’t
say, “Don’t do this and don’t do that.”

01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:51.469
You’ll just give up, just like that. Because
once you find your Spirit, you are never bored,

01:08:51.469 --> 01:08:55.710
you have no time. You are enjoying yourself
so much; you have no time for anything, even

01:08:55.710 --> 01:09:01.690
for smoking you forget. That’s how I’m
a very tricky person. I said no use telling

01:09:01.690 --> 01:09:05.929
them,”Don’t do.” Otherwise they’ll
never come to My programs. Let them come,

01:09:05.929 --> 01:09:11.170
and then I’ll manage. Then you’ll start
really saving money on these nonsensical things,

01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:15.460
nonsensical habits that you have got. You
want to get rid of them, it just works out.

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:18.839
So for the time being I think today is all
right but in the evening time, I’ll tell

01:09:18.839 --> 01:09:24.109
you all the rest of it. And we have got luckily
here two persons who have agreed to stay - she

01:09:24.109 --> 01:09:30.359
was in London and Michael was with Me - who
are deciding to stay in Santa Cruz. It is

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:35.130
she who brought Me here. It is she who gave
all these ideas. I mean it is [now?] her responsibility

01:09:35.130 --> 01:09:40.569
to see that you all are put onto the right
path, and that without challenging your ego

01:09:40.569 --> 01:09:45.279
she should do it because it can be dangerous
also. Because she is one of you so you may

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:49.790
not like it, her telling you something. So
don’t mind, you’ll become like her also.

01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:54.760
Don’t feel that there is something aggressive
about her. That is very important because

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:58.540
with Me it’s all right because first of
all I’m a Mother and also I’m something

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:04.070
different, but for her you will think she’s
just like you. So, doesn’t matter, you will

01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:07.070
become like her and you can also give realization
to many.    Thank you very much. May

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:14.070
God bless you. So, any questions? I’ll answer
them.    Seeker: “When You were talking

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:25.780
about the second chakra [is that the one?]
that is green here.”   Shri Mataji:

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:32.909
No. The one that is yellow color, you see,
which gives us the [INAUDIBLE] the second

01:10:32.909 --> 01:10:39.909
chakra. [But?] it goes round, [you know?],
it’s like a lotus. Have you seen a lotus

01:10:39.929 --> 01:10:46.150
[stem?] which has got a stalk? The stalk is
in the third chakra. It comes out of there.

01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:51.199
And it goes round all over, it supplies everywhere,
it can bend down. So this is the chakra which

01:10:51.199 --> 01:10:58.199
is flexible one, Swadhisthan. Which is actually
the Star, Star of David. The Star of David.

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:02.260
It’s the one which Moses and all these ... things
they have built it up. All that ... this crossing

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.670
of this represents the crossing of Moses [INAUDIBLE]
the river that He crossed, of the sea you

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:09.650
can say. All that is represented here ecause
it’s the Sea of Illusion you cross. It’s

01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:16.520
the work of Moses Himself. It’s Star of
David”   Seeker: Will You explain

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:23.520
the difference between self-consciousness
and Self-realization?    Sahaja yogi:

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:44.239
The difference between self-consciousness
and Self-realization.   Shri Mataji:

01:11:44.239 --> 01:11:51.239
I don’t know what is self-consciousness.
But Self-realization and self-knowledge is

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:58.400
the same. But self-consciousness what I learnt,
My own Indian English, I would say is that

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:02.750
you are very conscious of yourself. That you
are very particular about your body and you

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:09.679
are .... There is another word for that in
English language. Is that vanity? Something.

01:12:09.679 --> 01:12:16.679
That’s different. Self-knowledge, atma boddha,
knowledge of the Self.    One by one,

01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:26.290
all right. One here, one there, all right.
   Seeker: Last night I went home I

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:37.340
would feel like [vomiting.?] [NOT CLEAR].And
I went home and I went to bed to go to sleep.

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:42.639
It was terrifying.”    Shri Mataji:
Why? What happened?   Seeker: Well,

01:12:42.639 --> 01:12:45.750
I was having nightmares.   Shri Mataji:
[INAUDIBLE]The first day you may have. Because,

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:48.849
you see, there are spirits around and they
will try to dissuade you.    Seeker:

01:12:48.849 --> 01:12:55.849
What came was an image of my mother and she
was killing herself.    Shri Mataji:

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:08.130
Your mother?   Seeker: Yeah.    Shri
Mataji: It can be anything. You see, what

01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:12.090
happens sometimes when you sleep, I mean,
you must have had first of all very deep sleep,

01:13:12.090 --> 01:13:16.030
that’s [when it?one thing?] happens, but
when you come out of that sleep sometimes

01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:21.929
you pass [through?]your subconscious area
in the beginning. And the impressions that

01:13:21.929 --> 01:13:25.960
you [have at?] in your sushupti, means in
the deeper sleep, are not there. But you just

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:31.230
remember what you have seen in your present
subconscious mind, you see, and you touch

01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:36.449
that. But afterwards you get rid of it. No
problem. It happens.    Seeker: Also

01:13:36.449 --> 01:13:41.989
I wanna ask You a question about ... You said
last night about drinking ... And when people

01:13:41.989 --> 01:13:48.989
become alcoholics, are they possessed by negative
forces?    Shri Mataji: They could be

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:52.030
very much.   Seeker: Ok.   Shri
Mataji: Because they go to the left side.

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:56.869
You see, if you drink, you go to the left
side. You are in a vulnerable state. Then

01:13:56.869 --> 01:14:01.650
because you enter into an area which is unknown
to you, is the collective subconscious, and

01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:05.429
people can attack you, you see. It is possible.
Like Michael himself could tell you. After

01:14:05.429 --> 01:14:09.150
realization he started seeing them, the way
they were there. He could see them. And then

01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:13.630
he could fight them better because if you
become something else, you can fight them

01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:20.580
better, you see. Otherwise they are in you,
till you become mad, you don’t know they

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:25.790
are there.    Seeker: Also, is that
passed down from mummy to child?   Shri

01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:32.790
Mataji: Very much. Very much. Very much, no
doubt. You see, you share them even from your

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:37.460
friends sometimes. That’s what people don’t
know when they deal with other psyches and

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:42.790
things like that. They don’t know that there
is a way of protecting yourself from this.

01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:48.889
You have to protect. It’s very subtle. They
are just like diseases. They spread and they

01:14:48.889 --> 01:14:55.889
can attack you. They can get into you. It’s
very simple. It happens. Like I tell you,

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:59.349
he and his wife, now, they just announced
their marriage. And she had been to some clairvoyances

01:14:59.349 --> 01:15:02.239
and all that. They were all in her. She didn’t
know. She got her realization all right. The

01:15:02.239 --> 01:15:04.719
day the marriage was announced, they couldn’t
bear it, that happiness of his wife, you see.

01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:08.320
So they all came back on her and she got so
possessed, she started looking like a mad,

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.130
talking like a mad. It was a big problem.
They had to come to London to get it all right.   Yes

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:18.290
they are there. You can fight it out. No,
not difficult. We know the[NOT CLEAR] [technique

01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:25.290
of doing it?], all right. So just don’t
worry. It will [all?][be all right.?]   [There?],

01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:33.659
one by one. Now this gentleman, what have
you to say?   Seeker: Yesterday You

01:15:33.659 --> 01:15:40.659
talked about Your body is a temple of gods,
and I noticed that You were drinking coca

01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:43.639
cola. [INAUDIBLE]What is that You like about
it?   Shri Mataji: It’s perfectly

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:48.420
all right with Me, , I can even take poison.
No problem. You don’t compare yourself with

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:55.420
Me, all right. I have to take poison also;
I have to do all these things. So don’t

01:15:56.570 --> 01:16:01.869
compare yourself with Me. But this coca cola
is not so bad as people talk, I can tell you.

01:16:01.869 --> 01:16:07.949
It used to be very bad. Before that they were
making, about say two years back, I couldn’t

01:16:07.949 --> 01:16:12.130
take that. But there is nothing wrong with
it. I think it’s sort of a … also I feel,

01:16:12.130 --> 01:16:19.110
I don’t know, but maybe some sort of a enmity.
It’s sort of an enmity that it is very popular,

01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:22.300
maybe people are trying to say something.
But nothing goes wrong with Me when I take

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:26.230
it. If it was poison, I would know it’s
poison. But there’s nothing so wrong with

01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:30.840
it. Because, you see, I don’t know whatever
they give Me, I drink, I don’t mind. But

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.719
of course not the alcohol. Even if I take
alcohol, nothing will happen to Me. But I

01:16:33.719 --> 01:16:39.199
would not take it because I don’t need it
at all. I’m already in the Spirits.    I

01:16:39.199 --> 01:16:46.199
don’t need it. But now, [I would take it?].
I don’t think there is wrong with this coca

01:16:46.199 --> 01:16:53.199
cola. It used to be bad once upon a time.
I would say about year back or so. I never

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:58.099
liked it. But now I don’t mind because something
they added in it [INAUDIBLE] removed. There’s

01:16:58.099 --> 01:17:01.790
some sort of a funny…   Seeker: Too
expensive to put cocaine in it now.   Shri

01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:04.139
Mataji: Now, I don’t think they put any
cocaine. Oh they must be putting cocaine…   Seeker:

01:17:04.139 --> 01:17:07.849
They used to.   Shri Mataji: Ha, now
this is it. All right. There’s nothing wrong

01:17:07.849 --> 01:17:14.619
with it. That’s it. Now, how many questions?
   Sahaja yogi: [INAUDIBLE] that fellow

01:17:14.619 --> 01:17:21.400
there yet.   Shri Mataji: No, this one
is first of all which [INAUDIBLE]. Because

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:28.400
the seventh chakra is the chakra which has
got one thousand petals as shown here. When

01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:37.070
you cut the brain in a transverse section
you can see it’s like petals, petals of

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:44.070
lotus. It is said in the Bible that, “I
will appear before you like tongues of flames,”

01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:52.170
and these are the tongues of flames. Of course
all the chakras look like tongues of flames:

01:17:57.810 --> 01:18:04.810
very silent, very beautiful, very soothing.
But “seeing” is not the point; “being”

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:12.380
is the point. If you see them, is no good.
You have to become. And becoming is that you

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:23.780
feel the whole thing coming out of your head.
And these have the light but you need not

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:38.500
see them; there’s no need to see the auras.
Only when you are disintegrated, you see the

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:48.900
auras. When you are integrated, you never
see any auras. It’s being experimented.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:08.480
People who take drinks and all that, their
auras go like that [shaking?]. But a realized

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:26.080
soul, if you take the photograph of a realized
soul, there will be no aura around it. But

01:19:34.810 --> 01:19:41.810
if you are disintegrated, for example if you
are taking LSD, you might see aura around

01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:50.590
Me, around everyone. That’s not good. That
means you are not there. You are in the supraconscious

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:59.840
area, where you are seeing the elements that
are surrounding. But once you are integrated

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:07.310
by your realization, all these seven chakras
get integrated. In Sanskrit there’s a very

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:14.760
good word for integration, it is samagra means,
agra is the hole in the needle. So all the

01:20:19.570 --> 01:20:26.570
needles have the hole, and the thread goes
through that. So all the chakras get integrated

01:20:55.270 --> 01:21:02.270
when you get your realization. But actually
this area has got all the chakras. Now I show

01:21:06.739 --> 01:21:13.739
you where they are. This is the Agnya as I
told you. This is the Agnya, Agnya Chakra.

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:20.480
This is the window of the Agnya Chakra but
inside the brain it is, Agnya Chakra.    Then

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:27.480
you got the Vishuddhi Chakra here, which becomes
as the Primordial Being here as the Virat.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:36.440
Then is the Heart Chakra here. Then is the
Nabhi Chakra here. You can feel it. If you

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:47.239
have bad Nabhi you can feel the pressure.
It’s here, here, it’s here. At the back

01:21:47.239 --> 01:21:54.239
here the whole is the Swadhisthana. And here
at this point, at this point in the center

01:22:01.719 --> 01:22:08.719
is the Mooladhara Chakra. Now, you will be
amazed when you get diabetes, why should you

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:15.920
have your eyes weakened. What is the reason?
The reason is: when you get diabetes your

01:22:30.710 --> 01:22:37.710
Swadhisthana Chakra becomes weak. As I showed
you there that you get diabetes there, down

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:45.840
below, by the Swadhisthana’s [exertion?].
It presses on, it presses on, in the center

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:58.199
of the Mooladhara. Mooladhara is here in the
center, which controls your eyes. I mean eyes

01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:06.750
in the sense that the power to the eyes, the
light to the eyes. And once it starts oppressing

01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:14.670
it, you start losing your eyes though the
eyes are open. Even if you are possessed.

01:23:14.949 --> 01:23:21.949
If you are possessed, also same thing will
happen to you. You will have your eyes, but

01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:32.030
there will be no light, you can’t see. All
these things can be cured through Sahaja Yoga.

01:23:41.159 --> 01:23:48.159
Is very simple. The methods are very simple,
which you can learn yourself. You can cure

01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:56.550
others. You can become the masters.    Now
about the Spirit. As I told you the Spirit

01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:23.420
resides in your heart. It is the reflection
of the aspect of God which we call as God

01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:28.889
Almighty or Sadashiva. Because God is one.
But one person now ... I’m one but I’m

01:24:28.889 --> 01:24:35.889
a wife, I’m a grandmother, I’m your Mother;
I’m doing so many things. There are aspects

01:24:36.090 --> 01:24:43.090
of God and God has got firstly the aspect
of love by which He creates the power of His

01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:58.610
love, which is called as the Primordial Mother
or the Adi Shakti. It is the same aspect is

01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:35.869
represented in you as the Kundalini. You’ll
be amazed that even, even the Greeks knew

01:25:35.869 --> 01:25:41.079
about it because they called this bone as
sacrum, means the “sacred bone.” That

01:25:41.079 --> 01:25:48.079
means they knew that it was a sacred power
there. Even Athena ... Atha in Sanskrit means

01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:53.360
“primordial.” And if you see the photograph
of Athena or her statue ... I’ve been to

01:25:53.360 --> 01:26:00.360
... I was so surprised in Greece that they
all speak [NOT CLEAR]. And She had this snake

01:26:02.389 --> 01:26:09.260
in Her hand representing the energy. When
we [say of?] the snake, it is the energy,

01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:16.260
not the devil or anything but it’s an energy.
It moves like this and so She has the snake

01:26:21.670 --> 01:26:28.670
and also all the chakras in her hand and She’s
standing with a dress like that. That is Athena.

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:35.070
It’s very interesting. That place, the Delphi,
and all that was so much revealing. And, that

01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:41.829
Delphi, they said, is the Nabhi, is the navel
of the whole universe, which is true also.

01:26:41.829 --> 01:26:48.829
And lots of things I saw there which I have
talked in a tape which you can see for yourself.

01:27:04.429 --> 01:27:11.429
Now this Spirit is the aspect of God which
is a witness, the God that witnesses the play

01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:18.079
of His love. The first of all is the state
where we call it is Parabrahma where everything

01:27:18.079 --> 01:27:24.869
is just silent and sleeping. When we are sleeping,
nothing exists for us. In the same way the

01:27:24.869 --> 01:27:31.869
whole thing like Parambrahma, the abstract,
sleeps. Then it comes to Its awaken state.

01:27:33.670 --> 01:27:40.670
Then It wants to ... It gets the desire to
create out of love. So, this power of His

01:27:42.130 --> 01:27:49.130
love spreads around Him, accumulates and forms
another entity called as the Holy Ghost or

01:27:49.639 --> 01:27:55.409
you can say the Parashakti or you can call
it also as the Primordial Mother. She’s

01:27:55.409 --> 01:28:02.230
the Holy Ghost. Now, when the break takes
place, there’s a sound and this sound is

01:28:02.230 --> 01:28:06.949
the logos, as you call it, the Spirit. That
sound is the divine integrated sound, not

01:28:06.949 --> 01:28:13.949
one sound. And that one is called as Omkara,
which is the child, which is the child of

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:25.210
this couple, and that’s how you get the
Son of God.    Now the Spirit in us,

01:28:44.829 --> 01:28:51.270
which is represented, is that Son of God within
us, which is the part of that, we can say,

01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:53.719
God Almighty’s reflection within us, which
is the child in our heart, is the Spirit;

01:28:53.719 --> 01:28:58.730
is the abstract, abstract form of that Power,
which is all pervading, is the Spirit. Now,

01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:05.730
this is a combining thing. It has both the
things. You can see that because it is from

01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:14.070
the combination of these a child is born.
So on one side it is the reflection of the

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:29.540
God Almighty. On the other side it is the
connection with the all-pervading Power, which

01:29:32.489 --> 01:29:39.489
is the power of His love. So it is connected
on both the sides. So this Spirit is in your

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:48.710
heart, which [resides?decides?], is alert
all the time and knows all about you. In Gita

01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:57.310
is called as kshetragya, “the Lord of the
field.” He knows all about you and He knows

01:29:59.969 --> 01:30:06.969
what youare doing. It just is a witness. It
doesn’t involve into the play of what you

01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:13.699
are doing. It‘s just watching the whole
drama as long as It wants to, otherwise, when

01:30:13.699 --> 01:30:19.170
It is now fed up or does not want to enjoy
anymore, It just disappears. When It disappears,

01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:26.170
you do not exist anymore. This Spirit has
got the nature of, as [he has?] told you in

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:33.840
the morning, Satchitananda. Sat means that
“when you become the Spirit, you become

01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:46.770
the truth.” Now, what is the truth? Truth
is this all-pervading power. You start feeling

01:30:48.949 --> 01:30:53.510
it. You start feeling the truth. Now, this
truth is absolute. You get connected with

01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:59.920
it. Your attention gets enlightened. And whatever
you know through your attention by paying

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:06.780
attention to it, means through your vibratory
awareness, is the truth.    You put

01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:13.780
ten children together and ask them to feel
one person who is facing [Me?]. They will

01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:27.810
put up the same finger. That means something
wrong with his throat. Because you become

01:31:28.599 --> 01:31:33.000
the subject. It’s not subjective but you
become the subject. You start feeling, everybody

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:40.000
feels the same. Now you have seen these people
who have come to help Me from Australia, Switzerland

01:31:55.969 --> 01:32:01.079
and England and all these places. When you
come to Me, they say the same thing about

01:32:01.079 --> 01:32:05.639
a person, “He’s catching on this, he’s
catching on that.” Everybody catches on

01:32:05.639 --> 01:32:12.639
the same. So this all-pervading power is a
complete organization of delivering truth

01:32:12.739 --> 01:32:19.739
to you. You ask any questions [INAUDIBLE]
whether it is true or not, you will know on

01:32:21.829 --> 01:32:28.829
your vibratory awareness. Of course in the
beginning you have to develop the sensitivity.

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:40.280
Once you are sensitive to it, you can find
out the truth. So, the sat, that part, means

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:46.449
the brain gets enlightened. Your central nervous
system gets enlightened. That means Spirit

01:32:46.449 --> 01:32:50.920
gives light into central nervous system, and
you start feeling It flowing. First time it

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:57.030
comes to your consciousness. Whatever people
may tell you that, “This is the way we give

01:32:57.030 --> 01:33:03.340
Self-realization and all that,” just don’t
believe it. You must know that you should

01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:10.340
have, you should have the sensitivity of feeling
that Spirit and that truth which is common

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:23.920
to all of you -
that it cannot be denied. Truth is only one,
it cannot be hundreds. Once you are realized,

01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:12.980
all of them talk the same. There is no difference.
But the problem is human beings know how to

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:19.219
make a pickle out of everyone. That’s the
specialty of human beings. Anybody who came

01:34:19.219 --> 01:34:26.219
on this earth, who are the realized souls,
said the same thing. There is no difference

01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:33.770
whatsoever. But everybody started fighting
about it. Like the real flowers appear on

01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:43.530
the tree, when they are living, they are beautiful,
fragrant and they know each other. There is

01:34:59.409 --> 01:35:06.409
no difference between them. But somebody will
take out one, another will take out another

01:35:06.579 --> 01:35:13.579
and say, “This is mine, this is mine,”
then they are dead. Then they say, “This

01:35:20.829 --> 01:35:27.670
is it.” When Christ lived, nobody recognized
Him. They crucified Him. Even disciples, till

01:35:27.670 --> 01:35:34.670
He got His resurrection. Then what’s the
use? Nobody recognized Him. All
the great people when they came here, nobody

01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:57.790
recognized them.    Christ has said,
“Whatever you have done to Me will be forgiven,

01:35:57.790 --> 01:36:02.090
but not to the Holy Ghost.” Because the
Holy Ghost has to give you [your?] realization.

01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:07.990
And when you get your realization, you have
to recognize It. If you don’t recognize

01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:14.990
, that will not be forgiven. After realization
you have to recognize. If you do not recognize,

01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:27.020
He says it won’t be forgiven.    A
very, very great understanding is needed to

01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:38.710
understand what is today, such a precarious
time. The Last Judgment has started. So many

01:36:53.260 --> 01:37:00.260
great people are taking birth. So many crooks
are taking birth to harm you. It’s happening.

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:18.480
How will you judge yourself? How will you
judge? Are you going to be put on a balance?

01:37:59.230 --> 01:38:06.230
Your Kundalini is going to be awakened. You
yourself will judge. Not necessary for anybody

01:38:35.170 --> 01:38:42.170
to judge. You yourself will know whether I’m
catching on this [or?] whether I’m catching

01:38:58.949 --> 01:39:05.949
on that. Today only one of the Sahaja yoginis
says, “Mother I’m catching on the
right heart”. All right, we’ll work it

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:27.800
out. Another will say, “I’m catching on
my Agnya.” Yesterday somebody was telling

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:39.480
Me, “Mother, take out this bhoot from my
Agnya.” Now Agnya means ego. They can feel

01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:58.570
it, they can see it and they judge it because
they are out of it. The Spirit gives you the

01:41:04.670 --> 01:41:11.670
truth, and you like it because the vibrations
flow. You feel so peaceful and so happy and

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:10.500
joyous. And you can feel others. When the
vibrations are
not there, you feel, “What’s wrong with

01:42:26.619 --> 01:42:33.619
it? We should put it right.”And when you

01:42:55.260 --> 01:43:02.260
know the method how
to do it, you want to do it and you want to
be that, the joy of the Spirit. Though really

01:43:59.829 --> 01:44:06.829
felt in a big way comes later on, but it starts
trickling in. People give up all kinds of

01:44:38.110 --> 01:44:45.110
habits automatically. I don’t tell them.
They just give up. The will power is so great

01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:56.340
that whatever you want, you can give up. There
is no problem with it. So many people who

01:45:09.079 --> 01:45:16.079
used to take drugs - and were druggists and
chemists, I used to call them - when they

01:48:11.349 --> 01:48:18.349
came to Me, some of them came in coma. They
just [gave up?] without any difficulty. Because

01:49:34.639 --> 01:49:41.639
if you discover your Spirit, you just do it.
A transformation has to take place within

01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:35.510
you. If that doesn’t happen, it is no religion,
it is no God, it has nothing to do with your

01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:28.900
Kundalini. And when it takes, you become so
empowered that nothing can dominate you. No

01:52:40.429 --> 01:52:47.429
habit can dominate you. No guru can dominate
you. No ideas and fixations and all these

01:53:10.590 --> 01:53:17.590
smaller things will dominate but
you become so powerful that

01:54:09.219 --> 01:54:16.219
you start emitting light to others. And
people can see that light in you, that confidence
in you. Now
the chitta, chitta means “attention.”

01:56:28.619 --> 01:56:35.619
Your attention becomes enlightened.
