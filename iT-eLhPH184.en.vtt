00:15:09.994 --> 00:15:15.974
It's a very great day for Me to
see so many Sahaja Yogis here

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:23.224
who are from this
country, Greece.

00:15:24.974 --> 00:15:28.544
When first I came
to Greece,

00:15:28.864 --> 00:15:33.504
I told My husband that this
country is full of vibrations

00:15:33.784 --> 00:15:39.394
and there have been many
evolved souls in this country

00:15:39.904 --> 00:15:43.414
but perhaps the people
have lost their heritage,

00:15:43.804 --> 00:15:46.834
but the vibrations are
in the atmosphere

00:15:47.284 --> 00:15:52.124
and one day Sahaja Yoga
should prosper here very much.

00:15:52.914 --> 00:16:00.624
And somehow, we met some
bureaucrats who were Greeks and

00:16:01.024 --> 00:16:05.494
the experience was not good with
them and My husband said

00:16:05.774 --> 00:16:09.594
that, "If you said that Greeks
are really religious people,

00:16:09.854 --> 00:16:12.814
then look at these people
- what are they doing to me?"

00:16:13.124 --> 00:16:16.654
I said, "They may be bureaucrats
and all over, bureaucrats,

00:16:16.924 --> 00:16:19.044
you can't say what sort
of people they could be."

00:16:19.294 --> 00:16:25.614
But, on the whole, the vibrations
were very, very good, no doubt,

00:16:25.934 --> 00:16:31.814
and I went to all the places
in here, like I went to Delphi,

00:16:32.114 --> 00:16:35.974
I went up there to see Athena's
temple and everything.

00:16:36.314 --> 00:16:41.904
To all the places of interest,
they took Me round, especially Me,

00:16:44.564 --> 00:16:47.714
because he was busy
with his conference,

00:16:47.984 --> 00:16:51.884
and so they took Me round.
And everywhere I felt

00:16:52.184 --> 00:16:56.704
even the sea I felt was
so beautiful. This was about,

00:16:56.994 --> 00:17:01.924
I think I came here at least
about fifteen years back,

00:17:02.194 --> 00:17:07.494
maybe fourteen years
back - and I find now

00:17:08.544 --> 00:17:12.004
the vibrations are coming
back now through you people

00:17:12.424 --> 00:17:15.704
and the whole place
is again vibrating.

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:17.814
Now, you have to understand
that you people

00:17:18.154 --> 00:17:21.414
have a very big responsibility
because you're

00:17:21.664 --> 00:17:25.904
strategically placed
in Greece, you see.

00:17:26.214 --> 00:17:32.054
Creece and Italy, I mean Turkey,
both are very important.

00:17:32.764 --> 00:17:36.844
First of all, you are the bridge
between the eastern side

00:17:37.104 --> 00:17:42.014
and the western side and
everybody is interested in,

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:45.664
somehow or another,
managing these two areas

00:17:45.954 --> 00:17:51.274
so that hey could control
eastern and western side.

00:17:53.484 --> 00:17:56.694
I mean the western
countries especially.

00:17:56.964 --> 00:17:59.584
Now the greatest danger
that you have now

00:17:59.864 --> 00:18:04.044
is that this western culture
may try to grab you

00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:07.504
and which is very
dangerous.

00:18:09.104 --> 00:18:11.964
To understand it,
you have to know

00:18:12.274 --> 00:18:16.064
that you are people coming
from a very great tradition,

00:18:16.414 --> 00:18:20.754
ancient people of ages
just like Indians,

00:18:21.484 --> 00:18:28.054
and there is so much you can do
to improve the culture of Europe

00:18:28.394 --> 00:18:31.334
by your own behavior.

00:18:31.614 --> 00:18:35.894
Like these people we have
coming here, tourists are coming,

00:18:36.394 --> 00:18:42.494
and they see the
behavior of the Greeks

00:18:43.044 --> 00:18:48.344
and they see that they
can influence very well,

00:18:49.884 --> 00:18:56.174
the Europeans, think that Greeks
can be very easily influenced

00:18:56.424 --> 00:19:00.394
by their culture,
by their cheap life.

00:19:01.124 --> 00:19:05.974
So, as you being the
such traditional people,

00:19:06.274 --> 00:19:11.544
down to earth and
so many, so many

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:16.694
good things you
have known in life,

00:19:17.044 --> 00:19:21.204
it's very important to
understand the historical

00:19:21.514 --> 00:19:24.094
background of your country,
first of all.

00:19:24.374 --> 00:19:29.454
For Sahaja Yogis it is very
important to be educated that way

00:19:29.744 --> 00:19:32.604
because tomorrow you'll have
to talk to other people

00:19:32.944 --> 00:19:38.074
and you'll have to tell them
about Athena, about your traditions,

00:19:38.364 --> 00:19:43.014
about your background and how
it is connected to Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:43.304 --> 00:19:47.484
connected to Mother Mary, connected
to Christ and all those things.

00:19:47.774 --> 00:19:52.894
For this, it is very necessary that
we all should try to understand

00:19:53.194 --> 00:19:55.924
the historical background
of this country

00:19:56.484 --> 00:20:02.414
and educate yourself in a way that
you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:03.174 --> 00:20:06.494
As it is, you know, Athena has
the Kundalini in Her hand

00:20:06.824 --> 00:20:11.494
and you can see that clearly
that She was the Adi Shakti.

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:15.494
Actually, in Sanskrit language
atha means primordial.

00:20:15.764 --> 00:20:18.294
So She was
the Primordial Mother.

00:20:18.844 --> 00:20:20.244
Because there was
no connection

00:20:20.514 --> 00:20:23.174
left between the Greeks
and the Indians,

00:20:23.454 --> 00:20:26.824
this, I mean, translation

00:20:27.114 --> 00:20:31.814
was not there and they didn't
know what it meant by Athena.

00:20:32.894 --> 00:20:36.144
But Indians know that it
is this is the place

00:20:36.454 --> 00:20:42.044
for the manifestation
of the Adi Shakti

00:20:42.444 --> 00:20:47.014
because in the Devi Mahatmyam,
if you read, or you will find out

00:20:47.334 --> 00:20:50.974
they have described Greece
as the Manipurndwip.

00:20:51.304 --> 00:20:57.854
Means the island in the Manipur.
Manipur is this Nabhi Chakra.

00:20:58.204 --> 00:21:04.824
So in the Nabhi there's an
island where it is your Greece,

00:21:05.164 --> 00:21:09.454
where the Goddess resides.
Manipur chakra is where She resides.

00:21:10.744 --> 00:21:14.884
And so, this Athena has
been described,

00:21:15.114 --> 00:21:19.234
and when I went to Her
temple I found that there was

00:21:19.524 --> 00:21:25.604
a little temple for the child God.
That was Shri Ganesha.

00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:29.344
And then, when I went to Delphi,
also, when I went there

00:21:29.624 --> 00:21:32.654
I was surprised to see, they showed
Me a mound and said,

00:21:32.934 --> 00:21:36.584
"This is the Nabhi, navel
of the whole universe."

00:21:36.844 --> 00:21:39.834
I said, "That's correct." But when
I turned round there

00:21:40.104 --> 00:21:44.514
were lots of vibrations and what
I find is a Ganesha statue there.

00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:47.364
Then Gregoire came here
he took photographs

00:21:47.664 --> 00:21:49.764
and everything
and he saw that.

00:21:50.074 --> 00:21:53.554
So now you are the Nabhi.
You are sitting here in the Nabhi

00:21:53.824 --> 00:21:56.884
of the whole universe.
So how important is Nabhi?

00:21:57.204 --> 00:22:01.944
You know that very well,
that Nabhi Chakra gets spoilt,

00:22:02.214 --> 00:22:06.134
the whole life becomes
miserable for a human being.

00:22:06.414 --> 00:22:09.934
So, on the right side of
the Nabhi, as you see,

00:22:10.754 --> 00:22:17.234
is the liver and because, of course,
we had lots of philosophers,

00:22:17.544 --> 00:22:22.154
they used to think a lot and
they created lots of tragedies,

00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:26.324
you see Greek tragedy's well
known, where a marriage system was

00:22:26.614 --> 00:22:31.694
little bit challenged, that
there was, say, two men,

00:22:31.984 --> 00:22:35.384
one woman or maybe
two women, one man

00:22:35.644 --> 00:22:38.864
and never they felt happy
with the marriage.

00:22:39.174 --> 00:22:43.084
So the left Nabhi was
under attack, throughout.

00:22:43.374 --> 00:22:48.374
To have such a tragedy, they
wrote so many, I would say,

00:22:48.704 --> 00:22:54.214
so many dramas and they played them
here and so many plays were there

00:22:54.514 --> 00:22:57.524
showing that there are two
men and one woman

00:22:57.834 --> 00:23:01.834
or two women and one
man and no relationship

00:23:02.144 --> 00:23:05.394
between the husband
and wife which was pure.

00:23:05.674 --> 00:23:07.034
And that was the tragedy.

00:23:07.294 --> 00:23:10.264
It's known all over
as the Greek tragedy.

00:23:10.534 --> 00:23:12.964
It's all imaginary
and people, you see,

00:23:13.234 --> 00:23:16.464
became very left-sided to
begin with. They started thinking,

00:23:16.724 --> 00:23:19.944
Oh, this life is a misery.
It's a tragedy.

00:23:20.184 --> 00:23:23.724
What should we do?
Why should we?

00:23:24.154 --> 00:23:28.954
Why should we try to
show that we are happy?

00:23:29.224 --> 00:23:30.964
We are very
unhappy people.

00:23:31.234 --> 00:23:34.404
And all these things
started here to begin with.

00:23:34.704 --> 00:23:37.844
Then came these
your Orthodox Church.

00:23:38.144 --> 00:23:41.374
Now this Orthodox Church is
another one, which, of course,

00:23:41.604 --> 00:23:45.664
is really doesn't treat women
very well and treats them

00:23:45.934 --> 00:23:51.334
as if they are all the
time unholy. Certain times

00:23:51.604 --> 00:23:55.064
they cannot go to church
and they cannot touch people,

00:23:55.334 --> 00:23:58.184
all kinds of nonsensical
ideas they had.

00:23:58.534 --> 00:24:01.614
That also made women
very left-sided.

00:24:01.944 --> 00:24:04.634
Then, on top of that,
all this was happening

00:24:04.914 --> 00:24:06.894
with these tragedies
and all that.

00:24:07.304 --> 00:24:13.874
Suddenly the economic problem
came up and people felt very,

00:24:14.154 --> 00:24:17.274
sort of, disgusted
about that.

00:24:17.594 --> 00:24:19.724
So the left side
became very,

00:24:20.044 --> 00:24:23.524
very prominent here
and that is how I think

00:24:23.784 --> 00:24:26.124
many of these left-sided,

00:24:26.394 --> 00:24:30.304
bhootish organizations
started here

00:24:30.894 --> 00:24:34.834
and many gurus came who
made you feel miserable.

00:24:35.154 --> 00:24:37.704
But the worst that was
done by the Greek Church

00:24:38.054 --> 00:24:40.574
which made you feel so guilty.

00:24:40.874 --> 00:24:43.924
So you became
very left-sided.

00:24:44.864 --> 00:24:48.304
Now this left-sidedness was
later on counter-balanced

00:24:48.574 --> 00:24:51.054
by people who started
becoming overactive;

00:24:51.324 --> 00:24:55.284
thinking too much, working too
hard and all those things.

00:24:55.624 --> 00:24:58.964
But still, I think that they don't
work very hard as they should work.

00:24:59.224 --> 00:25:01.654
They're on the lazy side,
the Greeks are.

00:25:01.954 --> 00:25:04.714
They're on the lazy side. Of course,
the Sahaja Yogis are not.

00:25:04.974 --> 00:25:06.434
The Sahaja Yogis have
worked very hard,

00:25:06.744 --> 00:25:09.754
I can see all that very
clearly, but otherwise.

00:25:10.074 --> 00:25:16.164
So, now to bring
out Sahaja Yoga

00:25:16.524 --> 00:25:19.784
in Greece, is important,
first of all, to know

00:25:20.044 --> 00:25:23.574
what is our historical
background.

00:25:23.834 --> 00:25:26.284
The second, they should
be very well equipped

00:25:26.514 --> 00:25:29.714
with the knowledge
of chakras and centers

00:25:29.994 --> 00:25:36.104
and how to improve these centers.
If you do not have that knowledge,

00:25:36.354 --> 00:25:39.244
you cannot face people. It's not
that only men should know,

00:25:39.504 --> 00:25:42.154
women also should
know everything about it.

00:25:42.414 --> 00:25:46.044
What is the chakras are,
how they work out

00:25:47.634 --> 00:25:52.734
and what are their results
are, how do we suffer

00:25:52.994 --> 00:25:55.214
because our chakras
are in danger.

00:25:55.514 --> 00:25:58.144
All this knowledge
is free to you.

00:25:58.614 --> 00:26:01.384
You don't have to pay for
this knowledge. Only thing,

00:26:01.654 --> 00:26:05.254
every day-to-day life, when you
start working out Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:05.554 --> 00:26:10.964
then you'll find that what I'm
saying is absolutely tangible.

00:26:11.254 --> 00:26:16.294
You can verify it. It is so.
It's not something in the air.

00:26:16.534 --> 00:26:20.114
It is absolutely there.
We can prove everything

00:26:20.354 --> 00:26:24.004
that we believe in and we
can show others also

00:26:24.274 --> 00:26:27.914
that this is the truth.
Is an absolute truth.

00:26:28.214 --> 00:26:30.404
We are not here to
spread some sort

00:26:30.694 --> 00:26:34.274
of a fanaticism or racialism
or anything like that,

00:26:34.554 --> 00:26:37.544
but we are here to combine
the whole world together

00:26:37.844 --> 00:26:42.144
under one understanding; that
we belong to one universe

00:26:42.424 --> 00:26:46.204
and we have one
universal religion.

00:26:46.654 --> 00:26:48.084
Now, people will ask
you then,

00:26:48.364 --> 00:26:50.784
"Have we to give up
your religion?"

00:26:51.044 --> 00:26:52.474
You don't have to tell them that
you have to give up your religion,

00:26:52.724 --> 00:26:55.504
don't have to say that. You don't
have to be hard with them at all.

00:26:55.764 --> 00:26:57.914
On the contrary, no, no, no,
nothing has to be done.

00:26:58.234 --> 00:27:02.774
You just come and take to Sahaja
Yoga and take to your spirit.

00:27:03.064 --> 00:27:06.664
Gradually it will start
opening out.

00:27:07.094 --> 00:27:08.864
It has happened with
all of you

00:27:09.114 --> 00:27:10.864
that first when you
came to Sahaja Yoga

00:27:11.164 --> 00:27:13.904
you were in a different
shape. Now gradually,

00:27:14.214 --> 00:27:15.804
you started opening
out, you matured

00:27:16.094 --> 00:27:18.794
and you understood
Sahaja Yoga very well.

00:27:19.074 --> 00:27:23.864
In the same way, you must
teach others in the same manner,

00:27:24.204 --> 00:27:28.974
with the same understanding,
compassion and love.

00:27:29.224 --> 00:27:32.384
Otherwise, normally people
think that somebody

00:27:32.684 --> 00:27:34.994
is to be condemned
all the time.

00:27:35.254 --> 00:27:39.394
Of course, some are people
who are under bad influence

00:27:39.674 --> 00:27:43.454
and you cannot get along
with them, but most of you

00:27:43.744 --> 00:27:47.934
should know that we have to get
more people into Sahaja Yoga

00:27:48.214 --> 00:27:54.464
through our compassion, love
and also lot of understanding

00:27:54.734 --> 00:28:00.994
about others' feelings. I've
found that even countries

00:28:01.324 --> 00:28:04.134
where have been Sahaja
Yoga for so many time,

00:28:04.444 --> 00:28:09.604
suddenly someone comes up
and starts giving trouble

00:28:09.904 --> 00:28:14.894
and becoming bhootish sort of
thing, you see, and misbehaving.

00:28:15.224 --> 00:28:19.264
Suddenly, it happens. Such a person,
you know, if it is informed,

00:28:19.514 --> 00:28:22.324
we can take him out of Sahaja
Yoga. We can cleanse him.

00:28:22.624 --> 00:28:25.304
But all of you must know
one thing for definite

00:28:25.594 --> 00:28:29.014
that you all have these
powers to cure yourself,

00:28:29.294 --> 00:28:31.514
improve yourself,
to help others.

00:28:31.794 --> 00:28:34.034
You can do everything
yourself.

00:28:34.334 --> 00:28:37.044
You all have these powers,
but the only thing

00:28:37.304 --> 00:28:39.354
is you have to be
sincere and honest.

00:28:39.694 --> 00:28:43.474
If you are not sincere and
honest, it will never work out.

00:28:43.794 --> 00:28:46.804
On the contrary, it will
boomerang on you.

00:28:47.104 --> 00:28:52.214
So, in Sahaja Yoga, it's very impor-
tant is the sincerity of purpose.

00:28:52.584 --> 00:28:55.284
You must have complete
sincerity of purpose

00:28:55.544 --> 00:29:00.804
that you are here to achieve your
own self-emancipation, first.

00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:08.264
And secondly, you are
here to help others.

00:29:09.484 --> 00:29:14.214
The people all along in the
whole world now require help.

00:29:14.524 --> 00:29:18.284
There's so many problems,
so many catastrophes,

00:29:18.624 --> 00:29:25.124
so many horrible things
we everyday know going on.

00:29:25.374 --> 00:29:27.994
So now we need people who
are solid, who are balanced,

00:29:28.254 --> 00:29:32.254
who are peaceful, who understand
what is right and what is wrong.

00:29:32.954 --> 00:29:34.574
But apart from that,
you should know

00:29:34.804 --> 00:29:38.464
that you have now entered
into the Kingdom of God.

00:29:38.694 --> 00:29:41.254
Many people will say, all right,
we were so religious,

00:29:41.484 --> 00:29:43.484
we were praying to Christ,
we were praying to this one,

00:29:43.714 --> 00:29:46.394
praying to that one.
What did we get?

00:29:46.664 --> 00:29:49.264
You cannot get it because
you are not connected.

00:29:49.524 --> 00:29:52.904
You have to be connected. Once
you are connected to that,

00:29:53.154 --> 00:29:56.904
then you will find that
things start sorting out.

00:29:57.184 --> 00:30:00.844
But sincerity is very important
and faith in yourself.

00:30:01.254 --> 00:30:05.074
You must have faith in yourself
that you're quite capable,

00:30:05.304 --> 00:30:09.594
quite capable person and
you can achieve

00:30:10.154 --> 00:30:14.404
a very high degree of awareness by
which you can work out many things.

00:30:14.634 --> 00:30:17.834
It doesn't matter from what sort
of background you come in.

00:30:18.114 --> 00:30:20.424
It doesn't matter from what sort
of country you come in,

00:30:20.684 --> 00:30:21.904
race anything.

00:30:22.174 --> 00:30:23.614
You all can do very well

00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:28.854
and we have seen this happening in
so many countries where we had

00:30:29.084 --> 00:30:35.934
no hope at all. For example,
a country like Russia,

00:30:36.724 --> 00:30:40.334
imagine, they've never
worshipped any God.

00:30:40.564 --> 00:30:43.594
They didn't know about God.
They were not allowed to know

00:30:43.844 --> 00:30:46.094
about any religion,
anything,

00:30:46.384 --> 00:30:50.214
but suddenly I went there, I don't
know, they recognized Me, suddenly.

00:30:50.594 --> 00:30:53.634
They just recognized Me and
just with My photograph

00:30:53.974 --> 00:30:56.184
I find them there. I was
amazed that the first time

00:30:56.484 --> 00:31:05.164
I went to Leningrad there were
two thousand seats in the hall,

00:31:05.534 --> 00:31:07.684
but outside they were
all standing. I said,

00:31:07.984 --> 00:31:09.614
"Why are they standing
outside?" They said,

00:31:09.884 --> 00:31:12.254
"All the seats are full, Mother,
and these are extra people.

00:31:12.594 --> 00:31:15.884
There are more than two
thousand outside." So I said,

00:31:16.204 --> 00:31:19.524
"This is too much." And so they
said, "Mother, what about us?"

00:31:19.834 --> 00:31:21.654
I said, "All right, let me
finish the program."

00:31:21.944 --> 00:31:24.584
I went inside, did the program,
everything happened

00:31:24.964 --> 00:31:26.014
and you'll be amazed

00:31:26.234 --> 00:31:29.734
when we had the program,
the people who were outside

00:31:30.034 --> 00:31:32.994
were still waiting. I gave
realization to people

00:31:33.254 --> 00:31:35.094
and they were waiting,
waiting, waiting.

00:31:35.364 --> 00:31:37.944
When I came out
I gave them.

00:31:38.644 --> 00:31:40.064
I said, "Now, what to do?

00:31:40.344 --> 00:31:42.474
I can't give you
realization just now."

00:31:42.754 --> 00:31:44.914
So they said, "All right,
what can we do?"

00:31:45.224 --> 00:31:47.094
I said, "Tomorrow morning
can you come?" They said,

00:31:47.394 --> 00:31:50.594
"All right." So all those who were
inside and those who were outside,

00:31:50.844 --> 00:31:53.804
all of them came and
came and sat down

00:31:54.084 --> 00:31:59.054
in that open ground and
I gave them realization.

00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:02.424
So this is the first beginning,
but now in Moscow

00:32:02.704 --> 00:32:08.454
or any place we have to
reserve a huge, big stadium.

00:32:08.814 --> 00:32:11.674
Fourteen to sixteen
thousand people are there

00:32:11.934 --> 00:32:15.594
and realization is
being given.

00:32:16.024 --> 00:32:18.614
But they are so quick
to accept Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:18.884 --> 00:32:23.304
so quick to accept Me, so quick
to understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:23.604 --> 00:32:28.824
I just can't imagine how these
Russians have got this capacity.

00:32:30.604 --> 00:32:32.354
No question of their
going back,

00:32:32.654 --> 00:32:35.004
no question of their
sincerity being challenged.

00:32:35.294 --> 00:32:41.124
There is no question of their
doubting themselves, nothing.

00:32:41.504 --> 00:32:45.974
Just there and so much so,
so much that I sometimes feel

00:32:46.294 --> 00:32:48.754
this democracy has
just harmed us.

00:32:49.224 --> 00:32:52.194
Because of democracy,of course,
we could do Sahaja Yoga all right,

00:32:52.474 --> 00:32:57.464
but where the people are,
absolutely sometimes very idiotic.

00:32:57.794 --> 00:33:01.274
Like in America, I find there's
very idiotic people live there

00:33:01.534 --> 00:33:06.094
and they were only busy
choosing their bathrooms

00:33:06.414 --> 00:33:10.674
and their curtains and their soaps
and all the time they will choose,

00:33:10.964 --> 00:33:13.414
only busy with all these
nonsensical things.

00:33:13.694 --> 00:33:20.334
They are so idiotic, while the
people in Russia are so sensible,

00:33:20.624 --> 00:33:27.404
so deep, so introspective and
even the artists and the scientists.

00:33:28.704 --> 00:33:33.174
I had a conference with the scientists.
There were about three hundred of them

00:33:33.584 --> 00:33:35.604
and I started talking to
them about science.

00:33:35.864 --> 00:33:37.114
I thought, better start
with science.

00:33:37.394 --> 00:33:39.024
They said, "Mother, no more
science, no more science.

00:33:39.324 --> 00:33:43.094
Tell us the science
of God."

00:33:44.724 --> 00:33:46.224
Such open-minded people.

00:33:46.464 --> 00:33:49.344
We have two hundred
doctors in Russia

00:33:49.644 --> 00:33:54.624
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga
and it has spread up to Siberia.

00:33:58.074 --> 00:34:00.104
Now, what's the use
of this democracy

00:34:00.364 --> 00:34:03.544
which doesn't take us to God.
It doesn't give us sense

00:34:03.814 --> 00:34:07.604
that we should seek God and
we should be humble towards God.

00:34:07.904 --> 00:34:11.834
So what's the use of having
this kind of a democracy and

00:34:12.144 --> 00:34:16.804
this kind of freedom which has
made us mad and idiotic?

00:34:17.214 --> 00:34:20.144
And that's very true about
every democratic country

00:34:20.424 --> 00:34:24.024
because you must know
democracy is money-oriented.

00:34:24.874 --> 00:34:28.194
And you know Greeks are very money
-oriented people also, as well.

00:34:28.474 --> 00:34:30.904
Of course, they're not
as bad as Americans,

00:34:31.194 --> 00:34:32.924
but they are quite
money-oriented.

00:34:33.214 --> 00:34:35.444
Also, Italians are very
money-oriented,

00:34:35.724 --> 00:34:38.134
but the worst is
the corruption.

00:34:38.654 --> 00:34:40.654
Now Italy is getting
exposed.

00:34:40.934 --> 00:34:43.074
I'm sure your country will
also get exposed.

00:34:43.354 --> 00:34:45.044
All these countries
are to be exposed.

00:34:45.314 --> 00:34:49.214
But, first of all, the Sahaja
Yogis have to be firm people.

00:34:49.774 --> 00:34:53.364
They have to be very, very
firm and they should know that

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:55.934
Sahaja Yoga is only
spirit-oriented,

00:34:56.274 --> 00:34:58.074
nothing but
spirit-oriented,

00:34:58.344 --> 00:35:01.274
that you have to have
your spirit enlightened,

00:35:01.594 --> 00:35:04.784
that your spirit has
to work everything,

00:35:05.024 --> 00:35:08.634
that you are not this body,
this money, this position,

00:35:08.944 --> 00:35:12.484
these powers, nothing.
But you are the spirit.

00:35:12.824 --> 00:35:15.544
This is what one
has to know.

00:35:15.894 --> 00:35:19.264
I was told it is very
difficult for you

00:35:19.564 --> 00:35:23.094
to come for pujas
to Cabella

00:35:23.384 --> 00:35:27.014
you all cannot join,
but one week,

00:35:27.314 --> 00:35:30.954
supposing you take
during Guru Puja, I think.

00:35:31.234 --> 00:35:33.414
You can come by boat
or something like that,

00:35:33.704 --> 00:35:37.034
would be easier for you to
come to Genoa by boat

00:35:37.334 --> 00:35:40.204
and then we can organize
your coming down.

00:35:40.504 --> 00:35:43.944
For Guru Puja, you all should
come. You see, Sahasrara Puja

00:35:44.214 --> 00:35:47.644
and Guru Puja are
very important

00:35:47.944 --> 00:35:52.544
and if you could come for Guru
Puja, it would be a very nice idea.

00:35:53.044 --> 00:35:55.124
I think it can be
arranged and organized

00:35:55.424 --> 00:35:59.224
that you can come
to Guru Puja.

00:35:59.804 --> 00:36:02.794
I know it's wherever I am,

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:07.464
supposing if I have it here, then
for all the rest of the people

00:36:07.774 --> 00:36:11.054
it will be far away. So
I just thought of Milan

00:36:11.344 --> 00:36:14.674
being quite in the center that
it would be nearer to England,

00:36:14.954 --> 00:36:17.384
nearer to other European
countries.

00:36:18.354 --> 00:36:21.024
You see, the Americans and
the South Americans

00:36:21.284 --> 00:36:24.104
find it very difficult,
so this time

00:36:24.424 --> 00:36:26.634
we had to provide all
tickets, everything

00:36:26.924 --> 00:36:30.424
to South Americans to come.
But they're very deep people.

00:36:30.704 --> 00:36:34.114
I was surprised in Colombia, they
are such good Sahaja Yogis,

00:36:34.394 --> 00:36:36.154
very beautiful
Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:36.474 --> 00:36:40.734
Very simple-hearted, very
good, well educated.

00:36:41.024 --> 00:36:45.474
Three, four of them got married
in India and they're very happy.

00:36:48.504 --> 00:36:55.484
So, now for that, two
things have to be done.

00:36:55.874 --> 00:37:03.324
Firstly, is that you
should come to collective.

00:37:03.624 --> 00:37:06.604
It's very important. You all
should come to collective

00:37:06.884 --> 00:37:11.044
and put your - please put attention
to Me, not to them, alright.

00:37:11.424 --> 00:37:13.374
Please put your attention
towards Me,

00:37:13.644 --> 00:37:15.294
don't turn your attention
very much.

00:37:15.574 --> 00:37:20.194
You have to keep your attention
all right. It's very important.

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:27.654
So you have to one thing is
to do, is to come to the collective

00:37:27.914 --> 00:37:31.594
and watch out for your attention.
Where is your attention?

00:37:31.904 --> 00:37:34.444
Where are you looking? Are you
turning your head too much

00:37:34.734 --> 00:37:37.144
or are you putting your
attention straight?

00:37:37.404 --> 00:37:40.774
It's very important that you
must keep your attention

00:37:41.034 --> 00:37:44.404
absolutely wrapped and
towards the meetings

00:37:44.634 --> 00:37:50.144
that you have here for
your collective.

00:37:50.764 --> 00:37:54.244
In that way, when your
attention is fixed you'll find

00:37:54.484 --> 00:37:57.664
you'll definitely rise into
thoughtless awareness,

00:37:57.914 --> 00:38:00.184
a state where you
grow spiritually.

00:38:00.454 --> 00:38:04.364
You have to rise up to that
state of thoughtless awareness

00:38:04.614 --> 00:38:07.484
where you grow
spiritually.

00:38:07.794 --> 00:38:09.484
If you're not in thoughtless
awareness,

00:38:09.734 --> 00:38:12.454
you cannot grow in
your spirituality.

00:38:12.704 --> 00:38:16.814
So it's very important to
see where is your attention.

00:38:17.054 --> 00:38:19.074
Where are you putting
your attention?

00:38:19.334 --> 00:38:21.414
If the attention could
be controlled

00:38:21.704 --> 00:38:23.744
then things will
be all right.

00:38:24.014 --> 00:38:26.894
He is crying,
the child is crying,

00:38:27.214 --> 00:38:30.634
may be you can take
him outside a litle bit,

00:38:39.244 --> 00:38:44.634
he is feeling hot I think
is all right now with the mother

00:38:59.694 --> 00:39:01.824
So the first thing is to
be in the collective.

00:39:02.114 --> 00:39:09.034
Now it's a very sinister,
also idea of some people

00:39:09.304 --> 00:39:12.234
is to always break the
collective, to create problems,

00:39:12.524 --> 00:39:18.944
to disregard the leaders. As a
result, leaders also get so fed up,

00:39:19.234 --> 00:39:21.814
they give up, you see. They don't
want to have anything to do.

00:39:22.144 --> 00:39:26.584
So they put up their own ideas,
they try to trouble the leaders,

00:39:26.834 --> 00:39:31.124
they create problems for them, they
just try to show off everywhere,

00:39:31.394 --> 00:39:37.044
as if they know everything. All
such people also create groups.

00:39:37.344 --> 00:39:43.394
So beware about them. You should
stick on always to the collective

00:39:43.684 --> 00:39:49.374
and not to anyone who tries to
create a kind of a group at all

00:39:49.704 --> 00:39:55.264
or who troubles or who
makes things difficult.

00:39:55.834 --> 00:39:59.974
You must understand those who
are collective only will grow,

00:40:00.254 --> 00:40:05.344
those who aren't, will not grow.
Because like a nail, if it breaks,

00:40:05.624 --> 00:40:09.694
then it doesn't grow.
In the same manner,

00:40:10.004 --> 00:40:13.684
if you keep out of this
thing, by any chance,

00:40:14.014 --> 00:40:15.964
if you have any problems
with the leaders,

00:40:16.274 --> 00:40:17.904
you can always
write to Me,

00:40:18.224 --> 00:40:20.094
you can tell Me,
I can work it out.

00:40:20.404 --> 00:40:24.974
But all the time, to go on
like this and grouping

00:40:25.254 --> 00:40:28.174
like this will break and there
will be someone who'll do that.

00:40:28.434 --> 00:40:31.284
There will be some negative
person who'll try to do that.

00:40:31.534 --> 00:40:36.254
So, you have to be very careful
not to get out of the collective.

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:38.934
You must always
support the collective,

00:40:39.184 --> 00:40:44.534
must help this collective
and must nourish it.

00:40:46.114 --> 00:40:48.564
As you know, I was
telling him also

00:40:48.854 --> 00:40:51.484
that he, if he has
problem with money,

00:40:51.784 --> 00:40:54.464
we can give money
from Cabella

00:40:54.764 --> 00:40:56.944
because before that I used
to travel on My own.

00:40:57.214 --> 00:41:01.134
Even to Greece, I came on
My own, and paid for everything.

00:41:01.394 --> 00:41:04.704
So, see also, then Stomatis
had to pay something,

00:41:05.014 --> 00:41:07.604
which I didn't like very much.
He was paying so much,

00:41:07.874 --> 00:41:09.684
because we had such
a small group.

00:41:09.954 --> 00:41:13.494
But now as you have a big
group, you feel responsible,

00:41:13.794 --> 00:41:16.114
you want to pay for it.
All right, doesn't matter.

00:41:16.414 --> 00:41:22.184
But not to pay for your Sahaja
Yoga, not for your realization,

00:41:22.454 --> 00:41:26.804
not for knowledge of Sahaja
Yoga. This is there.

00:41:27.084 --> 00:41:30.444
And so people will start putting
ideas into your heads that,

00:41:30.704 --> 00:41:32.764
Why this? Why that?",
and all that.

00:41:33.024 --> 00:41:35.874
Such people you should keep
out because you are here

00:41:36.154 --> 00:41:38.604
to develop your spirituality
and not to listen

00:41:38.874 --> 00:41:41.394
to these stupid people who
have been troublesome.

00:41:41.654 --> 00:41:44.904
So best is to keep
to your own,

00:41:45.594 --> 00:41:50.484
own development and own
nourishment. It's very important.

00:41:51.184 --> 00:41:54.874
So it is in a way collective,
but also individual,

00:41:55.154 --> 00:41:58.054
because what you're
gaining out of the collective

00:41:58.354 --> 00:42:00.584
you should be on the watch
out, you should see for yourself

00:42:00.884 --> 00:42:03.024
what you are gaining
out of the collective.

00:42:03.324 --> 00:42:05.844
Then secondly, at home, you
must every day, every day,

00:42:06.144 --> 00:42:09.964
every day, again I say,
not to miss it out,

00:42:10.284 --> 00:42:14.924
in the evening before sleeping
you must have meditation.

00:42:15.214 --> 00:42:17.714
You can wash
yourself up, like,

00:42:18.024 --> 00:42:19.984
what you call, the water
treatment or anything

00:42:20.254 --> 00:42:22.204
then sit down for meditation
for ten minutes.

00:42:22.514 --> 00:42:25.804
You must give fifteen minutes to
yourself and then sleep off.

00:42:26.094 --> 00:42:28.674
Supposing you can't do
one night, doesn't matter,

00:42:28.954 --> 00:42:32.304
but try to do it every
night. If not possible,

00:42:32.564 --> 00:42:34.754
if you don't do it one night,
you can do it in the morning.

00:42:35.054 --> 00:42:38.554
But it's very important. I can
easily make out a person

00:42:38.844 --> 00:42:42.084
who does meditation and
who does not do meditation.

00:42:42.464 --> 00:42:47.184
It's a difference, such a difference.
I immediately know a person

00:42:47.504 --> 00:42:52.404
who is meditating
everyday, in his health,

00:42:52.694 --> 00:42:57.224
in his face, in his behavior,
in everything, he's very different.

00:42:57.554 --> 00:43:00.724
And those who do not do
any meditation you'll find,

00:43:01.004 --> 00:43:04.924
not only that they are funny,
but their children are funny,

00:43:05.224 --> 00:43:09.104
their relationships are
funny, everything is funny.

00:43:09.454 --> 00:43:13.474
So the meditation is
a very important part for you.

00:43:13.894 --> 00:43:16.214
Because also the women
who are pregnant, when they,

00:43:16.514 --> 00:43:18.964
if they do not meditate
their children turn out

00:43:19.254 --> 00:43:24.024
to be very troublesome and very
funny. It's a thing like that.

00:43:24.374 --> 00:43:28.794
It effects everything. But your
character of meditativeness,

00:43:29.064 --> 00:43:34.844
your character of Sahaja Yoga
helps everyone, your children,

00:43:35.184 --> 00:43:37.514
your family, your society,
everybody,

00:43:37.774 --> 00:43:41.414
and everybody can make it out
what sort of a family you are,

00:43:41.724 --> 00:43:45.054
what sort of a people you are,
what sort of a personality you are.

00:43:45.314 --> 00:43:47.274
And from you they
take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:47.544 --> 00:43:53.214
So is important in individual life
also just to meditate, nothing else.

00:43:53.824 --> 00:43:58.524
You have to come to a state
of thoughtless awareness.

00:43:58.824 --> 00:44:01.374
So the mantra is, as
you know, Nirvichara.

00:44:01.624 --> 00:44:03.684
You should use the
mantra of Nirvichara

00:44:03.964 --> 00:44:06.144
for coming to the
state of thoughtlessness

00:44:06.404 --> 00:44:08.554
and try to increase
this area,

00:44:08.874 --> 00:44:10.754
this space of thoughtless
awareness

00:44:11.044 --> 00:44:15.134
and that is how you will find
you will be growing very much.

00:44:15.634 --> 00:44:19.654
Now as you get lots of powers,
as you get lots of people

00:44:19.984 --> 00:44:22.674
being realized by you,
curing by you,

00:44:22.924 --> 00:44:25.454
sometimes maybe it
might affect your ego.

00:44:25.704 --> 00:44:29.974
You might get into ego things.
For such people, I have to say

00:44:30.254 --> 00:44:33.254
that you have to be introspective
and see for yourself.

00:44:33.554 --> 00:44:36.074
You face the mirror and ask
now how much ego you have.

00:44:36.374 --> 00:44:39.534
Laugh at yourself. Once you
start laughing at yourself,

00:44:39.804 --> 00:44:42.264
your ego will drop out
and you'll understand

00:44:42.514 --> 00:44:46.514
that it was false to have this
kind of ego within you.

00:44:46.804 --> 00:44:50.044
There are so many ways and methods
of finding out about yourself.

00:44:50.334 --> 00:44:53.604
Put yourself into bandhan and put
your hands towards the photograph,

00:44:53.884 --> 00:44:56.314
immediately you can feel what
chakras are catching

00:44:56.624 --> 00:45:00.614
and you know how to clear it out.
Also sometimes you feel it inside.

00:45:00.884 --> 00:45:03.304
If your chakras are catching,
you can feel it inside

00:45:03.604 --> 00:45:08.694
and you can feel it,
the different centers

00:45:08.964 --> 00:45:11.314
on your fingertips
about yourself.

00:45:11.594 --> 00:45:15.984
So it is about yourself you will
know. About others, you know,

00:45:16.254 --> 00:45:18.354
you should just talk on
chakras. You should not say,

00:45:18.634 --> 00:45:21.534
he's bhootish, or he has ego
- nothing. But you should say,

00:45:21.794 --> 00:45:25.034
his Agnya is catching,
means he has got ego.

00:45:25.354 --> 00:45:28.314
You can say, his Nabhi's bad,
his, this thing is bad.

00:45:28.574 --> 00:45:30.244
So the language is
to change now.

00:45:30.514 --> 00:45:35.564
We have to talk in the
language of Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:36.264 --> 00:45:40.124
It is to be understood that
now we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:40.414 --> 00:45:43.644
We've got the powers
we have vibratory powers.

00:45:43.924 --> 00:45:48.544
But if you don't use these vibratory
powers, what is going to happen?

00:45:49.344 --> 00:45:51.354
We have to use them,
that's the point.

00:45:51.594 --> 00:45:53.784
We always forget. I've
seen, the other day

00:45:54.064 --> 00:45:55.914
they couldn't open something.
I said, "Give a bandhan."

00:45:56.194 --> 00:45:58.594
Gave a bandhan and immediately
it worked out, you see.

00:45:58.854 --> 00:46:00.824
Small, small things also
you'll be surprised

00:46:01.094 --> 00:46:02.924
that if it doesn't work out, you have
to just give a bandhan

00:46:03.164 --> 00:46:04.634
and it works out.

00:46:04.974 --> 00:46:07.334
It is important to know
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:46:07.624 --> 00:46:10.254
you are saints and that
you can do lots of things

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:12.804
and you shouldn't forget it.
You shouldn't forget it

00:46:13.054 --> 00:46:16.074
that you are Sahaja Yogis. Now
you are no more ordinary people.

00:46:16.344 --> 00:46:18.864
You are saints now and
you can do a lot.

00:46:19.144 --> 00:46:23.114
All this, when it works out,
you'll be amazed at yourself how,

00:46:23.404 --> 00:46:26.284
how you have achieved
all these things.

00:46:26.614 --> 00:46:29.744
And, I tell you, people tell Me
that they look like roses,

00:46:30.024 --> 00:46:32.814
all of their faces shining,
they look so beautiful and

00:46:33.124 --> 00:46:35.174
they can make it out that
you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:35.484 --> 00:46:37.894
I've seen at the airport
also many people say that,

00:46:38.194 --> 00:46:39.584
"Who were those people

00:46:39.884 --> 00:46:44.754
looking so sweet and beautiful,
shining. Who were those?"

00:46:45.114 --> 00:46:47.824
So if I tell them that they
are saints, they won't believe

00:46:48.114 --> 00:46:50.574
that there could be so
many saints, but there are

00:46:50.844 --> 00:46:53.174
and we have achieved
that all over the world.

00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:55.744
All over the world now there
are so many Sahaja Yogis

00:46:56.024 --> 00:47:00.094
that I can't even say how many they
are, in thousands and thousands.

00:47:00.414 --> 00:47:02.574
So, I again tell
you that Greece

00:47:02.834 --> 00:47:04.904
is a place where
you can do a lot.

00:47:05.184 --> 00:47:08.204
First of all, you must establish
yourself in Sahaja Yoga

00:47:08.454 --> 00:47:11.624
and you have to
know what you are,

00:47:11.904 --> 00:47:14.344
all the time to remember what
you are. You are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:14.634 --> 00:47:16.844
Even to children, you have
to say, "You are a Sahaja Yogi,"

00:47:17.114 --> 00:47:19.884
so they also develop that
personality by which

00:47:20.194 --> 00:47:23.064
they behave properly and
they behave in a manner

00:47:23.374 --> 00:47:26.134
that a Sahaja Yogi
should behave.

00:47:27.244 --> 00:47:32.294
So all these things are just
the preliminaries of Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:32.574 --> 00:47:36.394
but I am sure you must be
getting my tapes from Cabella

00:47:36.634 --> 00:47:39.504
and you must be knowing
about all the deeper things

00:47:39.784 --> 00:47:42.254
about yourself and
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:42.534 --> 00:47:46.354
It's a new age
that has started.

00:47:46.664 --> 00:47:49.964
The other day I said that the
Satya Yuga has started now.

00:47:50.304 --> 00:47:52.694
So it will start exposing
all that is a-satya,

00:47:53.004 --> 00:47:55.634
which is whatever is false.
All those who are false people

00:47:55.934 --> 00:48:00.074
will be exposed and you'll
be amazed at the way

00:48:00.384 --> 00:48:04.784
things will work out. And it's
such a great time you are born

00:48:05.114 --> 00:48:08.234
and it's such a great thing that
you have come to Sahaja Yoga

00:48:08.514 --> 00:48:10.384
and that you have
got your realization

00:48:10.634 --> 00:48:12.654
and that you are
one of those

00:48:12.964 --> 00:48:17.924
who have to lift the whole of this
universe into a higher awareness.

00:48:18.214 --> 00:48:20.234
Of course, we can't say
how many will be saved.

00:48:20.514 --> 00:48:24.414
It's another point because
what I know about is that

00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:29.324
in the evolutionary portion,
supposing we came from chimpanzees,

00:48:29.594 --> 00:48:32.554
many were lost
in between, you know,

00:48:32.854 --> 00:48:36.604
and there are so many
chimpanzees now left

00:48:36.914 --> 00:48:39.544
and there's the middle,
the people were lost.

00:48:39.834 --> 00:48:41.774
In the same way, many
human beings may be lost

00:48:42.064 --> 00:48:46.134
because of their stupidity, because
of their self-destructive habits

00:48:46.414 --> 00:48:48.644
that they have formed.

00:48:49.004 --> 00:48:50.884
But your responsibility
is very great.

00:48:51.104 --> 00:48:53.994
Don't think, I am just mediocre.
I'm good for nothing.

00:48:54.244 --> 00:48:55.614
Never. Never think
like that.

00:48:55.894 --> 00:48:59.654
You are all saints and you
are capable of great things.

00:48:59.974 --> 00:49:02.494
May God bless you.
