15:09.994 --> 15:15.974
It's a very great day for Me to
see so many Sahaja Yogis here

15:16.374 --> 15:23.224
who are from this
country, Greece.

15:24.974 --> 15:28.544
When first I came
to Greece,

15:28.864 --> 15:33.504
I told My husband that this
country is full of vibrations

15:33.784 --> 15:39.394
and there have been many
evolved souls in this country

15:39.904 --> 15:43.414
but perhaps the people
have lost their heritage,

15:43.804 --> 15:46.834
but the vibrations are
in the atmosphere

15:47.284 --> 15:52.124
and one day Sahaja Yoga
should prosper here very much.

15:52.914 --> 16:00.624
And somehow, we met some
bureaucrats who were Greeks and

16:01.024 --> 16:05.494
the experience was not good with
them and My husband said

16:05.774 --> 16:09.594
that, "If you said that Greeks
are really religious people,

16:09.854 --> 16:12.814
then look at these people
- what are they doing to me?"

16:13.124 --> 16:16.654
I said, "They may be bureaucrats
and all over, bureaucrats,

16:16.924 --> 16:19.044
you can't say what sort
of people they could be."

16:19.294 --> 16:25.614
But, on the whole, the vibrations
were very, very good, no doubt,

16:25.934 --> 16:31.814
and I went to all the places
in here, like I went to Delphi,

16:32.114 --> 16:35.974
I went up there to see Athena's
temple and everything.

16:36.314 --> 16:41.904
To all the places of interest,
they took Me round, especially Me,

16:44.564 --> 16:47.714
because he was busy
with his conference,

16:47.984 --> 16:51.884
and so they took Me round.
And everywhere I felt

16:52.184 --> 16:56.704
even the sea I felt was
so beautiful. This was about,

16:56.994 --> 17:01.924
I think I came here at least
about fifteen years back,

17:02.194 --> 17:07.494
maybe fourteen years
back - and I find now

17:08.544 --> 17:12.004
the vibrations are coming
back now through you people

17:12.424 --> 17:15.704
and the whole place
is again vibrating.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.814
Now, you have to understand
that you people

17:18.154 --> 17:21.414
have a very big responsibility
because you're

17:21.664 --> 17:25.904
strategically placed
in Greece, you see.

17:26.214 --> 17:32.054
Creece and Italy, I mean Turkey,
both are very important.

17:32.764 --> 17:36.844
First of all, you are the bridge
between the eastern side

17:37.104 --> 17:42.014
and the western side and
everybody is interested in,

17:42.394 --> 17:45.664
somehow or another,
managing these two areas

17:45.954 --> 17:51.274
so that hey could control
eastern and western side.

17:53.484 --> 17:56.694
I mean the western
countries especially.

17:56.964 --> 17:59.584
Now the greatest danger
that you have now

17:59.864 --> 18:04.044
is that this western culture
may try to grab you

18:04.374 --> 18:07.504
and which is very
dangerous.

18:09.104 --> 18:11.964
To understand it,
you have to know

18:12.274 --> 18:16.064
that you are people coming
from a very great tradition,

18:16.414 --> 18:20.754
ancient people of ages
just like Indians,

18:21.484 --> 18:28.054
and there is so much you can do
to improve the culture of Europe

18:28.394 --> 18:31.334
by your own behavior.

18:31.614 --> 18:35.894
Like these people we have
coming here, tourists are coming,

18:36.394 --> 18:42.494
and they see the
behavior of the Greeks

18:43.044 --> 18:48.344
and they see that they
can influence very well,

18:49.884 --> 18:56.174
the Europeans, think that Greeks
can be very easily influenced

18:56.424 --> 19:00.394
by their culture,
by their cheap life.

19:01.124 --> 19:05.974
So, as you being the
such traditional people,

19:06.274 --> 19:11.544
down to earth and
so many, so many

19:12.084 --> 19:16.694
good things you
have known in life,

19:17.044 --> 19:21.204
it's very important to
understand the historical

19:21.514 --> 19:24.094
background of your country,
first of all.

19:24.374 --> 19:29.454
For Sahaja Yogis it is very
important to be educated that way

19:29.744 --> 19:32.604
because tomorrow you'll have
to talk to other people

19:32.944 --> 19:38.074
and you'll have to tell them
about Athena, about your traditions,

19:38.364 --> 19:43.014
about your background and how
it is connected to Sahaja Yoga,

19:43.304 --> 19:47.484
connected to Mother Mary, connected
to Christ and all those things.

19:47.774 --> 19:52.894
For this, it is very necessary that
we all should try to understand

19:53.194 --> 19:55.924
the historical background
of this country

19:56.484 --> 20:02.414
and educate yourself in a way that
you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

20:03.174 --> 20:06.494
As it is, you know, Athena has
the Kundalini in Her hand

20:06.824 --> 20:11.494
and you can see that clearly
that She was the Adi Shakti.

20:11.794 --> 20:15.494
Actually, in Sanskrit language
atha means primordial.

20:15.764 --> 20:18.294
So She was
the Primordial Mother.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.244
Because there was
no connection

20:20.514 --> 20:23.174
left between the Greeks
and the Indians,

20:23.454 --> 20:26.824
this, I mean, translation

20:27.114 --> 20:31.814
was not there and they didn't
know what it meant by Athena.

20:32.894 --> 20:36.144
But Indians know that it
is this is the place

20:36.454 --> 20:42.044
for the manifestation
of the Adi Shakti

20:42.444 --> 20:47.014
because in the Devi Mahatmyam,
if you read, or you will find out

20:47.334 --> 20:50.974
they have described Greece
as the Manipurndwip.

20:51.304 --> 20:57.854
Means the island in the Manipur.
Manipur is this Nabhi Chakra.

20:58.204 --> 21:04.824
So in the Nabhi there's an
island where it is your Greece,

21:05.164 --> 21:09.454
where the Goddess resides.
Manipur chakra is where She resides.

21:10.744 --> 21:14.884
And so, this Athena has
been described,

21:15.114 --> 21:19.234
and when I went to Her
temple I found that there was

21:19.524 --> 21:25.604
a little temple for the child God.
That was Shri Ganesha.

21:25.884 --> 21:29.344
And then, when I went to Delphi,
also, when I went there

21:29.624 --> 21:32.654
I was surprised to see, they showed
Me a mound and said,

21:32.934 --> 21:36.584
"This is the Nabhi, navel
of the whole universe."

21:36.844 --> 21:39.834
I said, "That's correct." But when
I turned round there

21:40.104 --> 21:44.514
were lots of vibrations and what
I find is a Ganesha statue there.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.364
Then Gregoire came here
he took photographs

21:47.664 --> 21:49.764
and everything
and he saw that.

21:50.074 --> 21:53.554
So now you are the Nabhi.
You are sitting here in the Nabhi

21:53.824 --> 21:56.884
of the whole universe.
So how important is Nabhi?

21:57.204 --> 22:01.944
You know that very well,
that Nabhi Chakra gets spoilt,

22:02.214 --> 22:06.134
the whole life becomes
miserable for a human being.

22:06.414 --> 22:09.934
So, on the right side of
the Nabhi, as you see,

22:10.754 --> 22:17.234
is the liver and because, of course,
we had lots of philosophers,

22:17.544 --> 22:22.154
they used to think a lot and
they created lots of tragedies,

22:22.424 --> 22:26.324
you see Greek tragedy's well
known, where a marriage system was

22:26.614 --> 22:31.694
little bit challenged, that
there was, say, two men,

22:31.984 --> 22:35.384
one woman or maybe
two women, one man

22:35.644 --> 22:38.864
and never they felt happy
with the marriage.

22:39.174 --> 22:43.084
So the left Nabhi was
under attack, throughout.

22:43.374 --> 22:48.374
To have such a tragedy, they
wrote so many, I would say,

22:48.704 --> 22:54.214
so many dramas and they played them
here and so many plays were there

22:54.514 --> 22:57.524
showing that there are two
men and one woman

22:57.834 --> 23:01.834
or two women and one
man and no relationship

23:02.144 --> 23:05.394
between the husband
and wife which was pure.

23:05.674 --> 23:07.034
And that was the tragedy.

23:07.294 --> 23:10.264
It's known all over
as the Greek tragedy.

23:10.534 --> 23:12.964
It's all imaginary
and people, you see,

23:13.234 --> 23:16.464
became very left-sided to
begin with. They started thinking,

23:16.724 --> 23:19.944
Oh, this life is a misery.
It's a tragedy.

23:20.184 --> 23:23.724
What should we do?
Why should we?

23:24.154 --> 23:28.954
Why should we try to
show that we are happy?

23:29.224 --> 23:30.964
We are very
unhappy people.

23:31.234 --> 23:34.404
And all these things
started here to begin with.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.844
Then came these
your Orthodox Church.

23:38.144 --> 23:41.374
Now this Orthodox Church is
another one, which, of course,

23:41.604 --> 23:45.664
is really doesn't treat women
very well and treats them

23:45.934 --> 23:51.334
as if they are all the
time unholy. Certain times

23:51.604 --> 23:55.064
they cannot go to church
and they cannot touch people,

23:55.334 --> 23:58.184
all kinds of nonsensical
ideas they had.

23:58.534 --> 24:01.614
That also made women
very left-sided.

24:01.944 --> 24:04.634
Then, on top of that,
all this was happening

24:04.914 --> 24:06.894
with these tragedies
and all that.

24:07.304 --> 24:13.874
Suddenly the economic problem
came up and people felt very,

24:14.154 --> 24:17.274
sort of, disgusted
about that.

24:17.594 --> 24:19.724
So the left side
became very,

24:20.044 --> 24:23.524
very prominent here
and that is how I think

24:23.784 --> 24:26.124
many of these left-sided,

24:26.394 --> 24:30.304
bhootish organizations
started here

24:30.894 --> 24:34.834
and many gurus came who
made you feel miserable.

24:35.154 --> 24:37.704
But the worst that was
done by the Greek Church

24:38.054 --> 24:40.574
which made you feel so guilty.

24:40.874 --> 24:43.924
So you became
very left-sided.

24:44.864 --> 24:48.304
Now this left-sidedness was
later on counter-balanced

24:48.574 --> 24:51.054
by people who started
becoming overactive;

24:51.324 --> 24:55.284
thinking too much, working too
hard and all those things.

24:55.624 --> 24:58.964
But still, I think that they don't
work very hard as they should work.

24:59.224 --> 25:01.654
They're on the lazy side,
the Greeks are.

25:01.954 --> 25:04.714
They're on the lazy side. Of course,
the Sahaja Yogis are not.

25:04.974 --> 25:06.434
The Sahaja Yogis have
worked very hard,

25:06.744 --> 25:09.754
I can see all that very
clearly, but otherwise.

25:10.074 --> 25:16.164
So, now to bring
out Sahaja Yoga

25:16.524 --> 25:19.784
in Greece, is important,
first of all, to know

25:20.044 --> 25:23.574
what is our historical
background.

25:23.834 --> 25:26.284
The second, they should
be very well equipped

25:26.514 --> 25:29.714
with the knowledge
of chakras and centers

25:29.994 --> 25:36.104
and how to improve these centers.
If you do not have that knowledge,

25:36.354 --> 25:39.244
you cannot face people. It's not
that only men should know,

25:39.504 --> 25:42.154
women also should
know everything about it.

25:42.414 --> 25:46.044
What is the chakras are,
how they work out

25:47.634 --> 25:52.734
and what are their results
are, how do we suffer

25:52.994 --> 25:55.214
because our chakras
are in danger.

25:55.514 --> 25:58.144
All this knowledge
is free to you.

25:58.614 --> 26:01.384
You don't have to pay for
this knowledge. Only thing,

26:01.654 --> 26:05.254
every day-to-day life, when you
start working out Sahaja Yoga,

26:05.554 --> 26:10.964
then you'll find that what I'm
saying is absolutely tangible.

26:11.254 --> 26:16.294
You can verify it. It is so.
It's not something in the air.

26:16.534 --> 26:20.114
It is absolutely there.
We can prove everything

26:20.354 --> 26:24.004
that we believe in and we
can show others also

26:24.274 --> 26:27.914
that this is the truth.
Is an absolute truth.

26:28.214 --> 26:30.404
We are not here to
spread some sort

26:30.694 --> 26:34.274
of a fanaticism or racialism
or anything like that,

26:34.554 --> 26:37.544
but we are here to combine
the whole world together

26:37.844 --> 26:42.144
under one understanding; that
we belong to one universe

26:42.424 --> 26:46.204
and we have one
universal religion.

26:46.654 --> 26:48.084
Now, people will ask
you then,

26:48.364 --> 26:50.784
"Have we to give up
your religion?"

26:51.044 --> 26:52.474
You don't have to tell them that
you have to give up your religion,

26:52.724 --> 26:55.504
don't have to say that. You don't
have to be hard with them at all.

26:55.764 --> 26:57.914
On the contrary, no, no, no,
nothing has to be done.

26:58.234 --> 27:02.774
You just come and take to Sahaja
Yoga and take to your spirit.

27:03.064 --> 27:06.664
Gradually it will start
opening out.

27:07.094 --> 27:08.864
It has happened with
all of you

27:09.114 --> 27:10.864
that first when you
came to Sahaja Yoga

27:11.164 --> 27:13.904
you were in a different
shape. Now gradually,

27:14.214 --> 27:15.804
you started opening
out, you matured

27:16.094 --> 27:18.794
and you understood
Sahaja Yoga very well.

27:19.074 --> 27:23.864
In the same way, you must
teach others in the same manner,

27:24.204 --> 27:28.974
with the same understanding,
compassion and love.

27:29.224 --> 27:32.384
Otherwise, normally people
think that somebody

27:32.684 --> 27:34.994
is to be condemned
all the time.

27:35.254 --> 27:39.394
Of course, some are people
who are under bad influence

27:39.674 --> 27:43.454
and you cannot get along
with them, but most of you

27:43.744 --> 27:47.934
should know that we have to get
more people into Sahaja Yoga

27:48.214 --> 27:54.464
through our compassion, love
and also lot of understanding

27:54.734 --> 28:00.994
about others' feelings. I've
found that even countries

28:01.324 --> 28:04.134
where have been Sahaja
Yoga for so many time,

28:04.444 --> 28:09.604
suddenly someone comes up
and starts giving trouble

28:09.904 --> 28:14.894
and becoming bhootish sort of
thing, you see, and misbehaving.

28:15.224 --> 28:19.264
Suddenly, it happens. Such a person,
you know, if it is informed,

28:19.514 --> 28:22.324
we can take him out of Sahaja
Yoga. We can cleanse him.

28:22.624 --> 28:25.304
But all of you must know
one thing for definite

28:25.594 --> 28:29.014
that you all have these
powers to cure yourself,

28:29.294 --> 28:31.514
improve yourself,
to help others.

28:31.794 --> 28:34.034
You can do everything
yourself.

28:34.334 --> 28:37.044
You all have these powers,
but the only thing

28:37.304 --> 28:39.354
is you have to be
sincere and honest.

28:39.694 --> 28:43.474
If you are not sincere and
honest, it will never work out.

28:43.794 --> 28:46.804
On the contrary, it will
boomerang on you.

28:47.104 --> 28:52.214
So, in Sahaja Yoga, it's very impor-
tant is the sincerity of purpose.

28:52.584 --> 28:55.284
You must have complete
sincerity of purpose

28:55.544 --> 29:00.804
that you are here to achieve your
own self-emancipation, first.

29:01.114 --> 29:08.264
And secondly, you are
here to help others.

29:09.484 --> 29:14.214
The people all along in the
whole world now require help.

29:14.524 --> 29:18.284
There's so many problems,
so many catastrophes,

29:18.624 --> 29:25.124
so many horrible things
we everyday know going on.

29:25.374 --> 29:27.994
So now we need people who
are solid, who are balanced,

29:28.254 --> 29:32.254
who are peaceful, who understand
what is right and what is wrong.

29:32.954 --> 29:34.574
But apart from that,
you should know

29:34.804 --> 29:38.464
that you have now entered
into the Kingdom of God.

29:38.694 --> 29:41.254
Many people will say, all right,
we were so religious,

29:41.484 --> 29:43.484
we were praying to Christ,
we were praying to this one,

29:43.714 --> 29:46.394
praying to that one.
What did we get?

29:46.664 --> 29:49.264
You cannot get it because
you are not connected.

29:49.524 --> 29:52.904
You have to be connected. Once
you are connected to that,

29:53.154 --> 29:56.904
then you will find that
things start sorting out.

29:57.184 --> 30:00.844
But sincerity is very important
and faith in yourself.

30:01.254 --> 30:05.074
You must have faith in yourself
that you're quite capable,

30:05.304 --> 30:09.594
quite capable person and
you can achieve

30:10.154 --> 30:14.404
a very high degree of awareness by
which you can work out many things.

30:14.634 --> 30:17.834
It doesn't matter from what sort
of background you come in.

30:18.114 --> 30:20.424
It doesn't matter from what sort
of country you come in,

30:20.684 --> 30:21.904
race anything.

30:22.174 --> 30:23.614
You all can do very well

30:23.864 --> 30:28.854
and we have seen this happening in
so many countries where we had

30:29.084 --> 30:35.934
no hope at all. For example,
a country like Russia,

30:36.724 --> 30:40.334
imagine, they've never
worshipped any God.

30:40.564 --> 30:43.594
They didn't know about God.
They were not allowed to know

30:43.844 --> 30:46.094
about any religion,
anything,

30:46.384 --> 30:50.214
but suddenly I went there, I don't
know, they recognized Me, suddenly.

30:50.594 --> 30:53.634
They just recognized Me and
just with My photograph

30:53.974 --> 30:56.184
I find them there. I was
amazed that the first time

30:56.484 --> 31:05.164
I went to Leningrad there were
two thousand seats in the hall,

31:05.534 --> 31:07.684
but outside they were
all standing. I said,

31:07.984 --> 31:09.614
"Why are they standing
outside?" They said,

31:09.884 --> 31:12.254
"All the seats are full, Mother,
and these are extra people.

31:12.594 --> 31:15.884
There are more than two
thousand outside." So I said,

31:16.204 --> 31:19.524
"This is too much." And so they
said, "Mother, what about us?"

31:19.834 --> 31:21.654
I said, "All right, let me
finish the program."

31:21.944 --> 31:24.584
I went inside, did the program,
everything happened

31:24.964 --> 31:26.014
and you'll be amazed

31:26.234 --> 31:29.734
when we had the program,
the people who were outside

31:30.034 --> 31:32.994
were still waiting. I gave
realization to people

31:33.254 --> 31:35.094
and they were waiting,
waiting, waiting.

31:35.364 --> 31:37.944
When I came out
I gave them.

31:38.644 --> 31:40.064
I said, "Now, what to do?

31:40.344 --> 31:42.474
I can't give you
realization just now."

31:42.754 --> 31:44.914
So they said, "All right,
what can we do?"

31:45.224 --> 31:47.094
I said, "Tomorrow morning
can you come?" They said,

31:47.394 --> 31:50.594
"All right." So all those who were
inside and those who were outside,

31:50.844 --> 31:53.804
all of them came and
came and sat down

31:54.084 --> 31:59.054
in that open ground and
I gave them realization.

31:59.334 --> 32:02.424
So this is the first beginning,
but now in Moscow

32:02.704 --> 32:08.454
or any place we have to
reserve a huge, big stadium.

32:08.814 --> 32:11.674
Fourteen to sixteen
thousand people are there

32:11.934 --> 32:15.594
and realization is
being given.

32:16.024 --> 32:18.614
But they are so quick
to accept Sahaja Yoga,

32:18.884 --> 32:23.304
so quick to accept Me, so quick
to understand Sahaja Yoga.

32:23.604 --> 32:28.824
I just can't imagine how these
Russians have got this capacity.

32:30.604 --> 32:32.354
No question of their
going back,

32:32.654 --> 32:35.004
no question of their
sincerity being challenged.

32:35.294 --> 32:41.124
There is no question of their
doubting themselves, nothing.

32:41.504 --> 32:45.974
Just there and so much so,
so much that I sometimes feel

32:46.294 --> 32:48.754
this democracy has
just harmed us.

32:49.224 --> 32:52.194
Because of democracy,of course,
we could do Sahaja Yoga all right,

32:52.474 --> 32:57.464
but where the people are,
absolutely sometimes very idiotic.

32:57.794 --> 33:01.274
Like in America, I find there's
very idiotic people live there

33:01.534 --> 33:06.094
and they were only busy
choosing their bathrooms

33:06.414 --> 33:10.674
and their curtains and their soaps
and all the time they will choose,

33:10.964 --> 33:13.414
only busy with all these
nonsensical things.

33:13.694 --> 33:20.334
They are so idiotic, while the
people in Russia are so sensible,

33:20.624 --> 33:27.404
so deep, so introspective and
even the artists and the scientists.

33:28.704 --> 33:33.174
I had a conference with the scientists.
There were about three hundred of them

33:33.584 --> 33:35.604
and I started talking to
them about science.

33:35.864 --> 33:37.114
I thought, better start
with science.

33:37.394 --> 33:39.024
They said, "Mother, no more
science, no more science.

33:39.324 --> 33:43.094
Tell us the science
of God."

33:44.724 --> 33:46.224
Such open-minded people.

33:46.464 --> 33:49.344
We have two hundred
doctors in Russia

33:49.644 --> 33:54.624
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga
and it has spread up to Siberia.

33:58.074 --> 34:00.104
Now, what's the use
of this democracy

34:00.364 --> 34:03.544
which doesn't take us to God.
It doesn't give us sense

34:03.814 --> 34:07.604
that we should seek God and
we should be humble towards God.

34:07.904 --> 34:11.834
So what's the use of having
this kind of a democracy and

34:12.144 --> 34:16.804
this kind of freedom which has
made us mad and idiotic?

34:17.214 --> 34:20.144
And that's very true about
every democratic country

34:20.424 --> 34:24.024
because you must know
democracy is money-oriented.

34:24.874 --> 34:28.194
And you know Greeks are very money
-oriented people also, as well.

34:28.474 --> 34:30.904
Of course, they're not
as bad as Americans,

34:31.194 --> 34:32.924
but they are quite
money-oriented.

34:33.214 --> 34:35.444
Also, Italians are very
money-oriented,

34:35.724 --> 34:38.134
but the worst is
the corruption.

34:38.654 --> 34:40.654
Now Italy is getting
exposed.

34:40.934 --> 34:43.074
I'm sure your country will
also get exposed.

34:43.354 --> 34:45.044
All these countries
are to be exposed.

34:45.314 --> 34:49.214
But, first of all, the Sahaja
Yogis have to be firm people.

34:49.774 --> 34:53.364
They have to be very, very
firm and they should know that

34:53.624 --> 34:55.934
Sahaja Yoga is only
spirit-oriented,

34:56.274 --> 34:58.074
nothing but
spirit-oriented,

34:58.344 --> 35:01.274
that you have to have
your spirit enlightened,

35:01.594 --> 35:04.784
that your spirit has
to work everything,

35:05.024 --> 35:08.634
that you are not this body,
this money, this position,

35:08.944 --> 35:12.484
these powers, nothing.
But you are the spirit.

35:12.824 --> 35:15.544
This is what one
has to know.

35:15.894 --> 35:19.264
I was told it is very
difficult for you

35:19.564 --> 35:23.094
to come for pujas
to Cabella

35:23.384 --> 35:27.014
you all cannot join,
but one week,

35:27.314 --> 35:30.954
supposing you take
during Guru Puja, I think.

35:31.234 --> 35:33.414
You can come by boat
or something like that,

35:33.704 --> 35:37.034
would be easier for you to
come to Genoa by boat

35:37.334 --> 35:40.204
and then we can organize
your coming down.

35:40.504 --> 35:43.944
For Guru Puja, you all should
come. You see, Sahasrara Puja

35:44.214 --> 35:47.644
and Guru Puja are
very important

35:47.944 --> 35:52.544
and if you could come for Guru
Puja, it would be a very nice idea.

35:53.044 --> 35:55.124
I think it can be
arranged and organized

35:55.424 --> 35:59.224
that you can come
to Guru Puja.

35:59.804 --> 36:02.794
I know it's wherever I am,

36:03.094 --> 36:07.464
supposing if I have it here, then
for all the rest of the people

36:07.774 --> 36:11.054
it will be far away. So
I just thought of Milan

36:11.344 --> 36:14.674
being quite in the center that
it would be nearer to England,

36:14.954 --> 36:17.384
nearer to other European
countries.

36:18.354 --> 36:21.024
You see, the Americans and
the South Americans

36:21.284 --> 36:24.104
find it very difficult,
so this time

36:24.424 --> 36:26.634
we had to provide all
tickets, everything

36:26.924 --> 36:30.424
to South Americans to come.
But they're very deep people.

36:30.704 --> 36:34.114
I was surprised in Colombia, they
are such good Sahaja Yogis,

36:34.394 --> 36:36.154
very beautiful
Sahaja Yogis.

36:36.474 --> 36:40.734
Very simple-hearted, very
good, well educated.

36:41.024 --> 36:45.474
Three, four of them got married
in India and they're very happy.

36:48.504 --> 36:55.484
So, now for that, two
things have to be done.

36:55.874 --> 37:03.324
Firstly, is that you
should come to collective.

37:03.624 --> 37:06.604
It's very important. You all
should come to collective

37:06.884 --> 37:11.044
and put your - please put attention
to Me, not to them, alright.

37:11.424 --> 37:13.374
Please put your attention
towards Me,

37:13.644 --> 37:15.294
don't turn your attention
very much.

37:15.574 --> 37:20.194
You have to keep your attention
all right. It's very important.

37:23.374 --> 37:27.654
So you have to one thing is
to do, is to come to the collective

37:27.914 --> 37:31.594
and watch out for your attention.
Where is your attention?

37:31.904 --> 37:34.444
Where are you looking? Are you
turning your head too much

37:34.734 --> 37:37.144
or are you putting your
attention straight?

37:37.404 --> 37:40.774
It's very important that you
must keep your attention

37:41.034 --> 37:44.404
absolutely wrapped and
towards the meetings

37:44.634 --> 37:50.144
that you have here for
your collective.

37:50.764 --> 37:54.244
In that way, when your
attention is fixed you'll find

37:54.484 --> 37:57.664
you'll definitely rise into
thoughtless awareness,

37:57.914 --> 38:00.184
a state where you
grow spiritually.

38:00.454 --> 38:04.364
You have to rise up to that
state of thoughtless awareness

38:04.614 --> 38:07.484
where you grow
spiritually.

38:07.794 --> 38:09.484
If you're not in thoughtless
awareness,

38:09.734 --> 38:12.454
you cannot grow in
your spirituality.

38:12.704 --> 38:16.814
So it's very important to
see where is your attention.

38:17.054 --> 38:19.074
Where are you putting
your attention?

38:19.334 --> 38:21.414
If the attention could
be controlled

38:21.704 --> 38:23.744
then things will
be all right.

38:24.014 --> 38:26.894
He is crying,
the child is crying,

38:27.214 --> 38:30.634
may be you can take
him outside a litle bit,

38:39.244 --> 38:44.634
he is feeling hot I think
is all right now with the mother

38:59.694 --> 39:01.824
So the first thing is to
be in the collective.

39:02.114 --> 39:09.034
Now it's a very sinister,
also idea of some people

39:09.304 --> 39:12.234
is to always break the
collective, to create problems,

39:12.524 --> 39:18.944
to disregard the leaders. As a
result, leaders also get so fed up,

39:19.234 --> 39:21.814
they give up, you see. They don't
want to have anything to do.

39:22.144 --> 39:26.584
So they put up their own ideas,
they try to trouble the leaders,

39:26.834 --> 39:31.124
they create problems for them, they
just try to show off everywhere,

39:31.394 --> 39:37.044
as if they know everything. All
such people also create groups.

39:37.344 --> 39:43.394
So beware about them. You should
stick on always to the collective

39:43.684 --> 39:49.374
and not to anyone who tries to
create a kind of a group at all

39:49.704 --> 39:55.264
or who troubles or who
makes things difficult.

39:55.834 --> 39:59.974
You must understand those who
are collective only will grow,

40:00.254 --> 40:05.344
those who aren't, will not grow.
Because like a nail, if it breaks,

40:05.624 --> 40:09.694
then it doesn't grow.
In the same manner,

40:10.004 --> 40:13.684
if you keep out of this
thing, by any chance,

40:14.014 --> 40:15.964
if you have any problems
with the leaders,

40:16.274 --> 40:17.904
you can always
write to Me,

40:18.224 --> 40:20.094
you can tell Me,
I can work it out.

40:20.404 --> 40:24.974
But all the time, to go on
like this and grouping

40:25.254 --> 40:28.174
like this will break and there
will be someone who'll do that.

40:28.434 --> 40:31.284
There will be some negative
person who'll try to do that.

40:31.534 --> 40:36.254
So, you have to be very careful
not to get out of the collective.

40:36.534 --> 40:38.934
You must always
support the collective,

40:39.184 --> 40:44.534
must help this collective
and must nourish it.

40:46.114 --> 40:48.564
As you know, I was
telling him also

40:48.854 --> 40:51.484
that he, if he has
problem with money,

40:51.784 --> 40:54.464
we can give money
from Cabella

40:54.764 --> 40:56.944
because before that I used
to travel on My own.

40:57.214 --> 41:01.134
Even to Greece, I came on
My own, and paid for everything.

41:01.394 --> 41:04.704
So, see also, then Stomatis
had to pay something,

41:05.014 --> 41:07.604
which I didn't like very much.
He was paying so much,

41:07.874 --> 41:09.684
because we had such
a small group.

41:09.954 --> 41:13.494
But now as you have a big
group, you feel responsible,

41:13.794 --> 41:16.114
you want to pay for it.
All right, doesn't matter.

41:16.414 --> 41:22.184
But not to pay for your Sahaja
Yoga, not for your realization,

41:22.454 --> 41:26.804
not for knowledge of Sahaja
Yoga. This is there.

41:27.084 --> 41:30.444
And so people will start putting
ideas into your heads that,

41:30.704 --> 41:32.764
Why this? Why that?",
and all that.

41:33.024 --> 41:35.874
Such people you should keep
out because you are here

41:36.154 --> 41:38.604
to develop your spirituality
and not to listen

41:38.874 --> 41:41.394
to these stupid people who
have been troublesome.

41:41.654 --> 41:44.904
So best is to keep
to your own,

41:45.594 --> 41:50.484
own development and own
nourishment. It's very important.

41:51.184 --> 41:54.874
So it is in a way collective,
but also individual,

41:55.154 --> 41:58.054
because what you're
gaining out of the collective

41:58.354 --> 42:00.584
you should be on the watch
out, you should see for yourself

42:00.884 --> 42:03.024
what you are gaining
out of the collective.

42:03.324 --> 42:05.844
Then secondly, at home, you
must every day, every day,

42:06.144 --> 42:09.964
every day, again I say,
not to miss it out,

42:10.284 --> 42:14.924
in the evening before sleeping
you must have meditation.

42:15.214 --> 42:17.714
You can wash
yourself up, like,

42:18.024 --> 42:19.984
what you call, the water
treatment or anything

42:20.254 --> 42:22.204
then sit down for meditation
for ten minutes.

42:22.514 --> 42:25.804
You must give fifteen minutes to
yourself and then sleep off.

42:26.094 --> 42:28.674
Supposing you can't do
one night, doesn't matter,

42:28.954 --> 42:32.304
but try to do it every
night. If not possible,

42:32.564 --> 42:34.754
if you don't do it one night,
you can do it in the morning.

42:35.054 --> 42:38.554
But it's very important. I can
easily make out a person

42:38.844 --> 42:42.084
who does meditation and
who does not do meditation.

42:42.464 --> 42:47.184
It's a difference, such a difference.
I immediately know a person

42:47.504 --> 42:52.404
who is meditating
everyday, in his health,

42:52.694 --> 42:57.224
in his face, in his behavior,
in everything, he's very different.

42:57.554 --> 43:00.724
And those who do not do
any meditation you'll find,

43:01.004 --> 43:04.924
not only that they are funny,
but their children are funny,

43:05.224 --> 43:09.104
their relationships are
funny, everything is funny.

43:09.454 --> 43:13.474
So the meditation is
a very important part for you.

43:13.894 --> 43:16.214
Because also the women
who are pregnant, when they,

43:16.514 --> 43:18.964
if they do not meditate
their children turn out

43:19.254 --> 43:24.024
to be very troublesome and very
funny. It's a thing like that.

43:24.374 --> 43:28.794
It effects everything. But your
character of meditativeness,

43:29.064 --> 43:34.844
your character of Sahaja Yoga
helps everyone, your children,

43:35.184 --> 43:37.514
your family, your society,
everybody,

43:37.774 --> 43:41.414
and everybody can make it out
what sort of a family you are,

43:41.724 --> 43:45.054
what sort of a people you are,
what sort of a personality you are.

43:45.314 --> 43:47.274
And from you they
take to Sahaja Yoga.

43:47.544 --> 43:53.214
So is important in individual life
also just to meditate, nothing else.

43:53.824 --> 43:58.524
You have to come to a state
of thoughtless awareness.

43:58.824 --> 44:01.374
So the mantra is, as
you know, Nirvichara.

44:01.624 --> 44:03.684
You should use the
mantra of Nirvichara

44:03.964 --> 44:06.144
for coming to the
state of thoughtlessness

44:06.404 --> 44:08.554
and try to increase
this area,

44:08.874 --> 44:10.754
this space of thoughtless
awareness

44:11.044 --> 44:15.134
and that is how you will find
you will be growing very much.

44:15.634 --> 44:19.654
Now as you get lots of powers,
as you get lots of people

44:19.984 --> 44:22.674
being realized by you,
curing by you,

44:22.924 --> 44:25.454
sometimes maybe it
might affect your ego.

44:25.704 --> 44:29.974
You might get into ego things.
For such people, I have to say

44:30.254 --> 44:33.254
that you have to be introspective
and see for yourself.

44:33.554 --> 44:36.074
You face the mirror and ask
now how much ego you have.

44:36.374 --> 44:39.534
Laugh at yourself. Once you
start laughing at yourself,

44:39.804 --> 44:42.264
your ego will drop out
and you'll understand

44:42.514 --> 44:46.514
that it was false to have this
kind of ego within you.

44:46.804 --> 44:50.044
There are so many ways and methods
of finding out about yourself.

44:50.334 --> 44:53.604
Put yourself into bandhan and put
your hands towards the photograph,

44:53.884 --> 44:56.314
immediately you can feel what
chakras are catching

44:56.624 --> 45:00.614
and you know how to clear it out.
Also sometimes you feel it inside.

45:00.884 --> 45:03.304
If your chakras are catching,
you can feel it inside

45:03.604 --> 45:08.694
and you can feel it,
the different centers

45:08.964 --> 45:11.314
on your fingertips
about yourself.

45:11.594 --> 45:15.984
So it is about yourself you will
know. About others, you know,

45:16.254 --> 45:18.354
you should just talk on
chakras. You should not say,

45:18.634 --> 45:21.534
he's bhootish, or he has ego
- nothing. But you should say,

45:21.794 --> 45:25.034
his Agnya is catching,
means he has got ego.

45:25.354 --> 45:28.314
You can say, his Nabhi's bad,
his, this thing is bad.

45:28.574 --> 45:30.244
So the language is
to change now.

45:30.514 --> 45:35.564
We have to talk in the
language of Sahaja Yoga.

45:36.264 --> 45:40.124
It is to be understood that
now we are Sahaja Yogis.

45:40.414 --> 45:43.644
We've got the powers
we have vibratory powers.

45:43.924 --> 45:48.544
But if you don't use these vibratory
powers, what is going to happen?

45:49.344 --> 45:51.354
We have to use them,
that's the point.

45:51.594 --> 45:53.784
We always forget. I've
seen, the other day

45:54.064 --> 45:55.914
they couldn't open something.
I said, "Give a bandhan."

45:56.194 --> 45:58.594
Gave a bandhan and immediately
it worked out, you see.

45:58.854 --> 46:00.824
Small, small things also
you'll be surprised

46:01.094 --> 46:02.924
that if it doesn't work out, you have
to just give a bandhan

46:03.164 --> 46:04.634
and it works out.

46:04.974 --> 46:07.334
It is important to know
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

46:07.624 --> 46:10.254
you are saints and that
you can do lots of things

46:10.534 --> 46:12.804
and you shouldn't forget it.
You shouldn't forget it

46:13.054 --> 46:16.074
that you are Sahaja Yogis. Now
you are no more ordinary people.

46:16.344 --> 46:18.864
You are saints now and
you can do a lot.

46:19.144 --> 46:23.114
All this, when it works out,
you'll be amazed at yourself how,

46:23.404 --> 46:26.284
how you have achieved
all these things.

46:26.614 --> 46:29.744
And, I tell you, people tell Me
that they look like roses,

46:30.024 --> 46:32.814
all of their faces shining,
they look so beautiful and

46:33.124 --> 46:35.174
they can make it out that
you are Sahaja Yogis.

46:35.484 --> 46:37.894
I've seen at the airport
also many people say that,

46:38.194 --> 46:39.584
"Who were those people

46:39.884 --> 46:44.754
looking so sweet and beautiful,
shining. Who were those?"

46:45.114 --> 46:47.824
So if I tell them that they
are saints, they won't believe

46:48.114 --> 46:50.574
that there could be so
many saints, but there are

46:50.844 --> 46:53.174
and we have achieved
that all over the world.

46:53.444 --> 46:55.744
All over the world now there
are so many Sahaja Yogis

46:56.024 --> 47:00.094
that I can't even say how many they
are, in thousands and thousands.

47:00.414 --> 47:02.574
So, I again tell
you that Greece

47:02.834 --> 47:04.904
is a place where
you can do a lot.

47:05.184 --> 47:08.204
First of all, you must establish
yourself in Sahaja Yoga

47:08.454 --> 47:11.624
and you have to
know what you are,

47:11.904 --> 47:14.344
all the time to remember what
you are. You are a Sahaja Yogi.

47:14.634 --> 47:16.844
Even to children, you have
to say, "You are a Sahaja Yogi,"

47:17.114 --> 47:19.884
so they also develop that
personality by which

47:20.194 --> 47:23.064
they behave properly and
they behave in a manner

47:23.374 --> 47:26.134
that a Sahaja Yogi
should behave.

47:27.244 --> 47:32.294
So all these things are just
the preliminaries of Sahaja Yoga,

47:32.574 --> 47:36.394
but I am sure you must be
getting my tapes from Cabella

47:36.634 --> 47:39.504
and you must be knowing
about all the deeper things

47:39.784 --> 47:42.254
about yourself and
about Sahaja Yoga.

47:42.534 --> 47:46.354
It's a new age
that has started.

47:46.664 --> 47:49.964
The other day I said that the
Satya Yuga has started now.

47:50.304 --> 47:52.694
So it will start exposing
all that is a-satya,

47:53.004 --> 47:55.634
which is whatever is false.
All those who are false people

47:55.934 --> 48:00.074
will be exposed and you'll
be amazed at the way

48:00.384 --> 48:04.784
things will work out. And it's
such a great time you are born

48:05.114 --> 48:08.234
and it's such a great thing that
you have come to Sahaja Yoga

48:08.514 --> 48:10.384
and that you have
got your realization

48:10.634 --> 48:12.654
and that you are
one of those

48:12.964 --> 48:17.924
who have to lift the whole of this
universe into a higher awareness.

48:18.214 --> 48:20.234
Of course, we can't say
how many will be saved.

48:20.514 --> 48:24.414
It's another point because
what I know about is that

48:24.694 --> 48:29.324
in the evolutionary portion,
supposing we came from chimpanzees,

48:29.594 --> 48:32.554
many were lost
in between, you know,

48:32.854 --> 48:36.604
and there are so many
chimpanzees now left

48:36.914 --> 48:39.544
and there's the middle,
the people were lost.

48:39.834 --> 48:41.774
In the same way, many
human beings may be lost

48:42.064 --> 48:46.134
because of their stupidity, because
of their self-destructive habits

48:46.414 --> 48:48.644
that they have formed.

48:49.004 --> 48:50.884
But your responsibility
is very great.

48:51.104 --> 48:53.994
Don't think, I am just mediocre.
I'm good for nothing.

48:54.244 --> 48:55.614
Never. Never think
like that.

48:55.894 --> 48:59.654
You are all saints and you
are capable of great things.

48:59.974 --> 49:02.494
May God bless you.
