1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,640
Please sit very comfortably that’s very
important.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,219
There should be no strain on a particular
part of the body.

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:17,500
For example, when you are sitting sometimes
your feet might feel little bit numbed down,

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,540
you can change the posture.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:25,930
You need not carry on with any extreme effort
or any discomfort to yourself, that’s first

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,230
thing you must remember.

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:35,140
Moreover some of the people go into tense
postures also by stretching their hands too

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,990
straight or sometimes going very straight
or pushing their head behind.

9
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,210
Sometimes they bend their heads also bit too
much also.

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,329
Sit very comfortably with both the hands on
your lap in a very comfortable way.

11
00:00:53,329 --> 00:01:01,010
There should be nothing extreme to be done
from outside.

12
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:07,549
We have to understand the principle of this
living process.

13
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:15,979
Then you will know that why I say: “No use
doing any such extreme thing to achieve your

14
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:17,469
goal”.

15
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:29,579
The principle is like this: that this room
is all dirty supposing or it’s in a chaos,

16
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,570
or maybe it’s in darkness completely, you
can’t see anything.

17
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,109
So you enter inside the room.

18
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:42,310
Your goal is to achieve the enlightenment.

19
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:51,079
Some people will say that: “Let us clean
the room in darkness with blindness”.

20
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:58,920
You start cleaning your body you don’t know
what you are cleaning!

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,009
So there is no need to bother about cleaning
when you are blind.

22
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:11,510
Some people think: “If you clear your mind
before Realization you will be better off."

23
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:17,490
You have tried all those things, but in doing
so, you have gone to extremes.

24
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:24,799
It’s all blindness, all your work is done
in darkness, there is no enlightenment.

25
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:32,000
You have to get your enlightenment first,
this is what I have realized that unless and

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,910
until human beings are enlightened they cannot
cleanse themselves properly, they cannot understand

27
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:43,730
Sahaja Yoga, they cannot understand God, they
cannot understand feel their Spirit, nothing

28
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,239
is possible unless and until they are enlightened.

29
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:54,629
It is possible then, when you get the enlightenment,
you might find that the light is not coming

30
00:02:54,629 --> 00:03:01,359
through properly, there is some shaking in
the bulb or may be there is some shaking in

31
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:08,189
the shade or maybe that the room is dirty,
that you cannot see things clearly, that you

32
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,709
cannot see your image in the mirror, your
eyes are weak.

33
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,379
For all this you need a bright light.

34
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:23,900
But without getting the light itself, without
knowing something about what you have got

35
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,739
within yourself, how are you going to cleanse
yourself?

36
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:35,220
Of course the light may be dim but still you
can see what is the problem, what is to be

37
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,630
done, what is to be cleared out.

38
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,010
That’s why enlightenment is the first thing.

39
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,930
Now for this, even if you clean the whole
room, even if you do all that, you have not

40
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,799
done the perfect job.

41
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,769
On the contrary you might break some things,
you might spoil some things, you may slip

42
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:58,109
down, anything can happen in darkness that’s
what happens to people when they do any sadhana

43
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,109
blindly.

44
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:04,209
After your enlightenment you know your way
through, you know how to go about it and you

45
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,319
understand everything.

46
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:13,920
Then another myth we have is that if we cleanse
our mind, we can achieve our spirituality,

47
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
you can’t.

48
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,412
Even if this room may be clean unless and
until there is light there cannot be enlightenment.

49
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:22,370
So the main thing is you have to have an enlightenment.

50
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,530
I have known people who lead very clean and
a good life.

51
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:33,352
When they get enlightenment they get it very
fast and have it nicely established, very

52
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:34,640
easily and it is there.

53
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:42,010
But some of the people who lead a very clean
and a good life have overdone it to such an

54
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,860
extent that they have an ego about it, they
think: “I don’t want anything, I am perfect,

55
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,370
I do no wrong, I am committing no problem,
I am a very happy person”.

56
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,570
Such people also get stuck because they do
not want the higher things of life.

57
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:02,030
They do not want their Spirit to be enlightened
so that also sometimes become a very sticky

58
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,030
point.

59
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:10,250
Now in Sahaja Yoga, you have to know that
you have the power within yourself.

60
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,690
It is there, it exists there, and it is to
be just awakened.

61
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,860
In some people, it takes time to be awakened.

62
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,030
In thousands I have seen it takes no time.

63
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,590
The only thing that I would suggest is to
keep your mind open, not to become obstinate

64
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,590
about things.

65
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,810
If you are an obstinate person, the Kundalini
is even a greater obstinate thing.

66
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:42,100
Do not be obstinate, just keep yourself open,
do not argue it out by argument or by thinking

67
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,310
about it, the Kundalini is not going to be
awakened.

68
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,290
On the contrary when the Kundalini is awakened
your thoughts settle down to such an extent

69
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:54,160
that you feel there is no thought coming to
you from your subconscious or from your supraconscious.

70
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:03,210
So try to keep yourself absolutely open and
don’t worry even if your vibrations are

71
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,560
not felt.

72
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,690
The principle is that light is light and the
room is room.

73
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,530
The light has nothing to do with the room.

74
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:18,910
Only thing, when the light is enlightened,
it enlightens the room.

75
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,620
The room has something to do with the light,
but the light has nothing to do: whether the

76
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,850
room is there or not, light exists.

77
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:31,970
In the same way, we must understand that the
relationship with the atman and our body our

78
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,360
Spirit and our this body, mind, and our ego,
superego.

79
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:44,170
So many of 
you must have done lot of tapasyas and lot

80
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:50,340
of things which were not really wanted, thinking
that you have done such a lot, you have been

81
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,530
to so many places, you have done so much “tirtha
yatra” [acetic; journey] you have been to

82
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,750
so many pilgrimages and those pilgrimages
and all these places, you think according

83
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,100
to you, it should be blissful to you.

84
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:09,220
But actually, while going there, you did not
know how to get the bliss from those temple

85
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:15,320
and those places which are holy actually in
nature but are surrounded by people who are

86
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
extremely negative.

87
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,630
Because of that, that mixture was there and
sometimes instead of getting the bliss you

88
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,470
get the headaches.

89
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,120
7:23

90
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:43,780
Today we are going to discuss the Void what
we call Void in Sahaja Yoga is different from

91
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,490
the way people talk of void.

92
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:54,310
Void is the complete visceral cavity which
is called in Sahaja Yoga language as Bhavasagara.

93
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:06,500
Many a times, you must have heard people singing
songs poets singing songs saying “Bhavasagara

94
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,640
se para utaru”
What is this Bhavasagara?

95
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:23,500
This is the symbol or this is the reflection
of the whole entire universe that is created.

96
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,540
This all universe is created by Brahmadeva.

97
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:37,530
He is the one who is the creator, who is a
“raksna yeta” [unsure] of this world,

98
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,780
who created this beautiful universe, in that
especially he created the Mother earth.

99
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:51,820
He has placed the Moon and the Sun on both
the sides of this Mother earth and the representatives

100
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,030
of the Mother earth within us is the Kundalini,
the Mooladhara.

101
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:12,260
Now this universe exists within us, that 
is the Bhavasagara.

102
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,730
This Bhavasagara exists in many stages in
its evolutionary form and today it is Kali

103
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,570
Yuga in this Bhavasagara.

104
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:28,060
I would say it is the dawn of Satya Yuga and
the end of Kali Yuga.

105
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:37,170
And this Bhavasagara is placed in the centre-
is the center of Nabhi, Nabhi charka.

106
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,240
And around it, moves the center of Swadhisthana.

107
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:51,980
Nabhi chakra as you know is governed by Shri
Lakshmi as the power of Shri Vishnu and the

108
00:09:51,980 --> 00:10:03,240
Swadhisthana moves around it, which delimits
our own personality, and which creates all

109
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,370
these different stars within us or the planets
within us.

110
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:29,490
In these spaces, Void, are born the incarnations
of the Primordial Master who is called as

111
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,490
Dattatreya.

112
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:40,220
Dattatreya is the innocence of Shiva of – “Vibrations
itni hai ikura” [Vibrations are so cool]-

113
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,710
of Brahmadeva and of Shri Vishnu.

114
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:58,680
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, the essence of these,
the innocence of these is embodied in the

115
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,650
form of Dattatreya, who is the Primordial
Master.

116
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:18,450
So these masters who are born on this Earth
are innocence at its best, all integrated

117
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,450
together.

118
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,920
These masters have incarnated on this Earth
mainly ten times, but there have been many

119
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,960
others incarnations also, there have been
repetitions just to correct themselves.

120
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:36,310
As I told you yesterday that Mohammad Saab
and Nanaka are both the same personalities

121
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,370
of Dattatreya.

122
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:46,840
The instance is given, in the life of Guru
Nanaka, when he was sleeping people told him

123
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,960
that your feet are towards Mecca, Kaaba towards
Kaaba.

124
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,020
He said: “Alright I’ll remove my feet
and put wherever you say”.

125
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:01,750
Then they put his feet towards the other side
and again they found that his feet were facing

126
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,750
towards Kaaba.

127
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,050
Then he said: “Tell me the place where there
is no Kaaba I’ll put my feet!”

128
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:13,430
But they couldn’t arrange it at all, because
wherever he placed his feet, it was such a

129
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,130
Maya, that always they found that the feet
were towards Kaaba.

130
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:26,100
Now Kaaba is a place where you have a beautiful
Shiva linga, which is called as Mekkaeshwar

131
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,000
Shiva in our Puranas.

132
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,180
From ancient times it is mentioned that, there
is a pinda which is absolutely Vibrating and

133
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,690
which is there.

134
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,020
Now Mohammad Saab religiously avoided talking
about that.

135
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,089
He only said: “If this stone can be so godly,
why not human beings be?”

136
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:54,370
But he did not explained much as it is whatever
he tried to explain, the people were so insensitive

137
00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:00,770
and so cruel that they tried to kill him many
a times, they to gave him poison, ultimately

138
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,760
he died in a very, very bad state.

139
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,830
They tortured his life, they were lunatic
people, they used to live in tribes and very

140
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,089
tribal by nature.

141
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:17,779
And they- he tried his level best to propagate
that there is God and God is above all and

142
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:22,770
I am the messenger of God, but they would
not listen to him.

143
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:32,110
Then came, you know Nanaka who preached that
there should be no enmity between Hindus and

144
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,810
Muslims, he preached that, because he saw
the Muslims behaving in such a manner, they

145
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,130
were such fanatics and they had become so
funny that he could not understand how is

146
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,130
it?

147
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,410
These are the people whom I have made Muslims
and what are they doing here?

148
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:51,510
Actually Musalman means the person who is
realized and Peer is a person whose realization

149
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:57,050
is established so much so that he said that
those who have become Musalman should be buried

150
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,160
and not burnt, because he thought they are
all realized souls, but realization finished

151
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,820
off with his son in law and his daughter,
after that he had two sons who were great

152
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,310
souls who are really the reincarnations of
Lov and Kush.

153
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,560
Now perhaps we do not know what happened to
Luv and Kush when they were born.

154
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,960
Luv and Kush when their mother disappeared
in the Mother Earth and the father, they were

155
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:28,230
little annoyed with them, went in the North
one went to Caucasus and another went to China.

156
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:35,230
Luv went to Caucasus and from there he became
a very powerful king in Russia.

157
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,110
Russians always use Sanskrit language; we
do not know how much Sanskrit they use; for

158
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:46,990
example they will say kharoshou means Harushivaye
the Pravada itself the word Pravada vda is

159
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,470
to say pra means enlightened.

160
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,480
You see their language, it’s full of Sanskrit
words, practically it is absolutely based

161
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,750
on Sanskrit and you’d say slaws people…slaws,
so lov sla…

162
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:08,010
Luv ruled there for years together and about
four hundred years back, his very descendants

163
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:15,740
flew away from there, went to Iran, where
there is a Goddess, Goddess Hindolika’s

164
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,500
temple is there which is all described in
the Puranas, where they used to worship Goddess

165
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,730
Hindolika, from there they came down and spread
all over, it’s a big story.

166
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,360
Then Kush went to China, that’s how you
have Kushan in China and Chinese language

167
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,860
is very much near Sanskrit and quite close
to Marathi language, it’s more surprising

168
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,899
if you hear them talking, for example they
say; Ma tza tum , tza is only there in Marathi

169
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,000
language they use this word tza, we never
say in Hindi tza or in any other language

170
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,959
you wont find it tza but only in Chinese and
in Marathi language they have this word, tza.

171
00:15:52,959 --> 00:16:00,100
It’s very interesting to see, how the spirituality
has spread into these countries and then how

172
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,290
it died out.

173
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:10,520
All these things happened, but then they were
born again and again, they were born as Mahavira

174
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:19,370
and Buddha, they are the same, they are born
as Markendeya, they are born as Kabira, as

175
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,990
Adishankaracharya, it was Buddha who was born
as Adishankaracharya just to correct himself,

176
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,810
Buddha was shocked the way people were going,
there was Nirakara that he had be born as

177
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,760
Shankaracharaya to tell people, oh God, what
are you doing?

178
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,930
It was only Buddha who came to correct himself
as Shankaracharaya, it is so surprising, that

179
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:47,740
people are fighting, Buddhist and Hindus are
great enemies of each other, but they do not

180
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:54,640
know that the person who really re-established
Hinduism was the same who established Buddhism.

181
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:01,300
So imagine the same personality coming again
and again on this Earth tries to correct his

182
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:08,789
disciples again finds that there are two groups
he has created, it’s a big problem.

183
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:16,149
Now Mahavira also was one of them, who was
born again and again and he was Markendeya

184
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:22,699
and he was Kabira, the way Kabira lashes people
you can see that he is tremendous, he is like

185
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:27,999
Bhairava and the power of Bhairava, Kabira
has used in his language, but for Hindi poets

186
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:30,080
it is Sadhukadi and they have made fun of
it.

187
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,059
The best thing of a person who doesn’t want
to face reality, is to make fun of everyone,

188
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:39,220
that is the best way, they said what is this
talk Ida, Pingla, Sushumna?

189
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
Who is he?

190
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,330
What does he think of himself?

191
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,650
But he was appreciated very much, by the saints
and especially by Guru Nanaka, who included

192
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,669
all his poetry in his Grantha sahib; he’s
included so many of these poetry from all

193
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:54,330
the realized souls from Maharashtra, also.

194
00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:00,389
But I wonder how many Sikhs know that this
was for getting realization, he thought, if

195
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:03,980
you write an Upanishad, [not clear_] they
try to correct everything just to make people

196
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,749
understand that you have to get to it.

197
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:10,669
First, they thought that if you write Gita,
they go on remembering Gita by heart.

198
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:15,519
Then, they thought it is better, that you
write something from the realized souls only

199
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,460
together, so that it is a powerful Grantha
by which people when they read it they get

200
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,119
Vibrations and they’ll stick to it, but
it is not so, even there people are just reading

201
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,119
it.

202
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,119
I don’t know how?

203
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:29,210
Gradually as we were revolving, we were losing
our sensitivity.

204
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,210
At least in the time of Rama, people knew
he was an incarnation.

205
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,789
At the time of Krishna they knew he was an
incarnation.

206
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:40,940
Many people know, of course, Raksasha knew
also that they were incarnations; raksasha’s

207
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,309
even today know who the incarnation they are
very sure of it and they are just frightened

208
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:51,029
of, but in those days, even common people
knew who is an incarnation.

209
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:57,899
Now the sensitivity among human beings started
getting reduced and reduced as they got involved

210
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:04,030
into fanaticism, all kinds of tantrism that
developed in this country of ours, in other

211
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:09,200
countries also, tremendous movement was there
to create fanatics and these fanatics are

212
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,980
diseased people, they are diseased, they are
actually the people who are possessed absolutely

213
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,399
possessed, they are not normal people when
they talk, you are surprised, how can they

214
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:20,990
talk like that?

215
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,860
When they do not know anything about it, but
thank God today, fanaticism has reached such

216
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,789
a stage that the younger people are understanding
the nonsense of it.

217
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:34,999
It’s a very good chance for Sahaja Yoga
to come up.

218
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:42,019
In Sahaja Yoga, the beauty is this, that you
cannot now form a cult as soon as you try

219
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:48,259
to do such a thing, you loose your vibrations,
you try any such tricks, you try to be fanatic

220
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:56,980
you will be losing all your vibrations, any
tricks you try with Sahaja Yoga first thing

221
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,860
you will loose your vibrations, you wont like
it, you won’t be happy with it, you would

222
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:08,279
like to keep your vibrations going, smooth,
smoothly and nicely so that you feel absolutely

223
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:14,000
happy about it and joyous, but anybody who
tries any tricks with Sahaja Yoga, you get

224
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
into problem.

225
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,730
Now these Gurus came on this Earth to remove
fanaticism, the last of them came as Shirdi

226
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:28,900
Sai Nath, he was the one who had said very
clearly, in Marathi he had said it, that to

227
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:36,970
speak ill of any other religion is sin, is
sin, nothing can be more powerful than that.

228
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,600
There are many people who worship Sai Nath,
many people, but they drink, he was against

229
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,980
drinking, all of them were against drinking,
why were they against drinking because the

230
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,570
awareness is spread in your void.

231
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:57,720
The awareness, the Chitta, the attention is
in your void and is nourished by your liver.

232
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,200
The liver takes out all the poison from your
awareness, due to bad health, due to bad mind,

233
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,359
due to anything from bad effects or negativity
and then it clears out as I told you yesterday.

234
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:15,119
So this awareness within us gets, you know
that our awareness, human awareness goes down

235
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,809
through drinking, these people preach that
you should not drink.

236
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:22,549
I mean that the one thing that they all preached
together, that you should not drink.

237
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:27,019
At the time of Mohammad Saab there was no
smoking, so Guru Nanaka also [not clear] this

238
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:32,139
time you found people smoking with big big
hookah’s, he said that now for heaven sake

239
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:37,830
do not smoke, because they said that you just
said that don’t drink, so we will smoke

240
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,830
now.

241
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,109
Like in England, people say what’s wrong
in drugs?

242
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:49,539
Drugs were not approached by saints, so we
can take drugs, so it is in my lot, to tell

243
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:54,190
them, now drugs are the same; anything that
goes against awareness is not good.

244
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,909
I mean, it is not something that you have
said no because they were mad people, whatever

245
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:03,940
they said, they said because it was the truth.

246
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:09,929
If you take drinks of any kind, alcoholics
or any these kinds, anything that takes you

247
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:16,639
away from your awareness is wrong because
your awareness is to be enlightened as it

248
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:24,049
is your awareness is like that and on top
of that if this awareness is to be enlightened

249
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:27,000
and is full of alcoholism, how to raise it?

250
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,009
How to do it?

251
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:32,679
But these days to talk against alcoholism,
one person asked Me, “Mother are you going

252
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,859
to be minister of permission?”

253
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:41,580
I mean, it is impossible to talk to people
about anything sensible.

254
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,169
Even in a party you go, they say why don’t
you drink?

255
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:48,749
You should drink, you are missing such a great
thing, you have missed such a lot in your

256
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:53,299
life, I said I have drunk from my childhood,
don’t give Me anything I don’t need it,

257
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:56,230
no, they’ll go on forcing, you must drink.

258
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,390
You see, this is a special thing, that is
thing and all that.

259
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,760
They have no shame about it, no shame.

260
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,059
They think they are trying to be nice and
you tell them even once if you say.

261
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:08,830
Why do you drink?

262
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,650
Gone, you are the gone case, you have no manners.

263
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,669
You are the most unmannerly person.

264
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:14,480
How dare you say such a thing to anyone?

265
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,890
Look at these human beings, such [not clear_],
I don’t know how to deal with them?

266
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:26,710
They think that they should be told, “alright
go ahead drink, kill your self”.

267
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,730
How can you be saints allowed you to drink?

268
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,720
Tell Me, when they know that it goes against
your awareness, of course these thugs will

269
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,240
say “alright drink as much as you like,
do what you please, you have ten wives or

270
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,460
you do what you please, only give me your
purse to me”, because that is their interest

271
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,460
in you.

272
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,529
They are only interested in your purse, how
much money you have got in your purse?

273
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,190
What job you are doing?

274
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:57,929
Or at times they can be, officers, saying
that, give job to my son or give job to someone.

275
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:07,249
One has to understand that saint is not afraid
of anyone, he cannot be, it’s a fearless

276
00:24:07,249 --> 00:24:13,519
entity absolutely fearless, it’s not afraid
of anyone because it is standing on truth,

277
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:20,789
truth itself gives you that strength to say
the truth, but I have learnt certain lessons,

278
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:25,090
in my past lives that human beings don’t
like truth, don’t tell them, if you tell

279
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,090
them they will crucify you, immediately.

280
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,629
You have to go round and round and put them
into problem so that they come along.

281
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:36,700
If you tell them straight forward don’t
do something, they will put you, I mean, people

282
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,649
may crucify Me after sometime, if I tell them
don’t drink, it is that bad these days.

283
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:48,320
The drinking in England is so bad now that
English, who used to drink so little, is now

284
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,190
nothing but a bottle, since morning he starts
it.

285
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,090
In third generation you go down, what about
our Indians who have gone there?

286
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,720
Even the Sikhs, who are told not to drink,
drink more than Scotch people can drink.

287
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,700
It’s a shameful thing and they will fight
that we’ll not put a helmet on our head,

288
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,090
to save our head from going on a motorbike.

289
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:10,019
Is it written in any Grantha Sahib like this
to be foolish and stupid?

290
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:14,799
But they will fight for that, but not fight
for this, that no Sikh should drink.

291
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,419
If you are wearing that pagadi, you have no
business to drink.

292
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:24,239
They don’t think that the essence of religion
is more important, than all these nonsensical

293
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,559
things that you think you are doing.

294
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:33,779
Such a great religion, Islam, such a great
religion is Sikhism, such a great religion

295
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,720
is Hinduism, such a great religion is Christianity.

296
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,119
Everything gone to dogs because the dogs have
come into it.

297
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,690
They have no sense of proportion; they do
not know how to respect their Guru’s…

298
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:50,539
in the right way putting their guru’s in
their heart and in their behavior.

299
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:53,070
That’s all they should have done.

300
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,529
They should have just obeyed their Guru’s.

301
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:59,039
There was no need to stand on your heads and
take mantras from these thugs paying them.

302
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,789
There was no need at all to do all these things,
but no they thought that here we are doing

303
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:07,749
black market money, let us make some big temples
so there are great Hindus, big temples are

304
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:09,149
built, black market money going on.

305
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:16,629
Here they are killing so many people the Muslims,
so they must say that we are doing it in the

306
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:18,889
name of God, very nice.

307
00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:24,649
Where Mohammad Saab has talked of nothing
but Rehmat and Rahim, all the time Rehmat

308
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:29,889
and Rahim he has talked of, see they were
about to kill him every moment wherever he

309
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:36,549
went, it was such a dangerous situation, so
vicariously he was living and he had to defend

310
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:38,019
himself.

311
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:44,929
So now we have to defend ourselves from these
people, instead of these people defending

312
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:45,929
themselves.

313
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:51,369
It’s not in defense; it is in aggression,
these people are killing others and they think

314
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:56,080
they are doing a great very great service
to the people.

315
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,369
Then the Christians, they are one of the worst
fanatics worst fanatics are the Christians

316
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:05,820
There cannot be worst fanatics than Christianity.

317
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,680
Christianity is one religion which is very
clever and cunning, nobody can beat them all.

318
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
For example they will do all missionary work.

319
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,210
You’ll say ha a ha a ha what nice people.

320
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:23,369
The missionary work, they are looking after
our poor people here, very nice people very

321
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:27,799
great generous people and they will be converting
people.

322
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,779
What are you converting them for?

323
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:31,860
Have you got the power of realization?

324
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,440
Have you got the power to call yourself Christian?

325
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,220
Are you baptized in the real sense?

326
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,629
That is how the Christians have been behaving
throughout.

327
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:46,470
They have put up such a big show, this is
not God’s work, to get some people from

328
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,179
the street who are dying put them in the room
and look after them.

329
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:51,080
Is this the work of God?

330
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,980
This the work of human beings?

331
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,389
Work of God is just to raise the Kundalini
that is the work of God.

332
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:02,999
Not the work of God is to have Hospitals and
Schools and things.

333
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:11,570
This is not the work of God, this is your
job, this is you are doing it, but they are

334
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,029
taking the name of God to earn money.

335
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:17,570
In the name of God give me money.

336
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,590
Such beggars I tell you of the first waters.

337
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:26,419
Begging a man, who believes in God, will never
do.

338
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:27,859
Why to beg?

339
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:29,200
Why to ask for money?

340
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,549
On the streets they will stand, nowadays our
Hare Rama and Hare Krishna in Oxford Street

341
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:34,809
and beg money, in the name of God.

342
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:41,080
Can there be greater sinners than these who
beg in the name of God and get money from

343
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,820
others and live on other people’s money?

344
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,989
All the time like parasites.

345
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:50,099
This is they have done out of religion, or
ritualism go to the temples, there’s a priest

346
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:52,889
standing there he gives you ghanta, he makes
something, puts something on your head, God

347
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:54,849
knows he spoils the Agnya charka or what he
does?

348
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:59,619
and you think “oh I have been to this temple,
I have been to that temple, I have been to

349
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:07,099
this Teerath and that teerath and that teerath
and I have been a very religious man”.

350
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:14,419
I tell you these extreme ideas about God has
really blinded us completely from reality.

351
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:19,639
If you want the reality, you must know that
God is to be found within your heart and not

352
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:20,639
in those places.

353
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:24,619
Once you have found it in your heart then
you will know that where is the real God in

354
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:27,200
which temple and how to approach.

355
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:37,759
Now if I ask you, In Delhi how many temples
are really jaagrut, except for Sahaja yogis

356
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:44,769
nobody can say, you see a stone namaste another
stone might have been brought from some bathroom

357
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:45,769
namaste.

358
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:49,450
Is that a real jaagrut one?

359
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:59,159
It is said in the Bible that whatever is produced,
created by mother Earth and by the Sky should

360
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,899
not be reproduced, now what is that is created?

361
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:05,610
What is that is created by Mother Earth?

362
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:15,549
We Indians know these are the jaagrut deities
which are created by Mother Earth, these are

363
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:24,710
the jaagrut deities and that is to be worshipped
and not to get a Ganapati somewhere for 2

364
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,139
rupees, my forefathers have given me so I
am carrying on.

365
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:32,759
I must do their Puja, maybe the forefathers
are sitting on that.

366
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:35,710
You won’t believe, there is a gentleman
in Bombay, who came to Me, to meet Me, his

367
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,710
name is Mr.

368
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,480
Shah, he said “Mother Lot’s of things
are happening, I don’t know how?”

369
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,169
I said what happened?

370
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:48,379
“In my house I am getting some old deities
from somewhere, just coming into my house

371
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:51,029
from somewhere, I don’t know where from
where it comes?

372
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:56,419
Sometimes I keep my windows open in the night
and I find in the morning there is a deity

373
00:30:56,419 --> 00:31:00,679
of silver sometimes diamonds are there in
the nose of the Lakshmi and I am surprised

374
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:02,200
how am I getting it?”

375
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,539
And the man is not so rich to have all these
things; he showed me and said now what to

376
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:07,539
do?

377
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:09,080
I told him; throw them all of them in the
sea, that’s what they deserve.

378
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,620
He said from where have they come?

379
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,749
These are the people who have habit of very
seriously worshipping those deities, without

380
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:19,309
understanding that these deities have got
vibrations or not, whether they are jaagrut

381
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:20,600
or not, they are alright or not.

382
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,480
Even a plastic they’ll make, they’ll make
of aluminum.

383
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,239
I don’t know now what they are going to
use next to make a deity and they will be

384
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:33,929
carrying it on, have no value, have no understanding,
have no respect.

385
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:40,590
So the people who own those, they must be
bringing it, the old people and putting in

386
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,620
your house, so better put them in the sea,
otherwise they will not have their Mukti and

387
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,350
this fellow is having greediness.

388
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,690
He is always having a chakkar with these things.

389
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,500
He said “what is happening to me?”

390
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,710
His child is getting into problem; his wife
has run away from the house.

391
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,879
All kinds of problems coming up, lost all
his money, every sort of problem coming up

392
00:31:55,879 --> 00:32:03,090
and this deity is coming in he said, should
I sell them and get some money.

393
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,989
I said please don’t do it, to whomsoever
you will sell, you will sell asubah.

394
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:12,009
These are coming by some dead person using
this bhanawati; they are bringing this down

395
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:13,009
here.

396
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:18,210
But there where he told Me thousands of people
wanting just to touch the feet of these bhootas.

397
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:24,730
They thought such a bhoot cannot bring these
deities and that must be God who is coming

398
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,010
in the form.

399
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:31,899
If in the thing was written also, made in
near Mumbadevi and this and that.

400
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:38,509
You mean God is sitting there and making those
statues?

401
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:43,249
We don’t use our brains also, when it comes
to God.

402
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:48,539
I mean faith is necessary no doubt, but this
is after realization, before realization it’s

403
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:51,359
a blind faith, which can be any nonsense.

404
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,820
I have seen such mad people that they just
go on pulling out their hair and they say

405
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,109
that we are doing it in the name of God, really?

406
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,580
Why did God give you these hairs?

407
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,179
If he wanted you to pull it out like that
morning till evening sitting and pulling it

408
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:09,590
out and they develop such nervousness that
if they are not properly aware they will start

409
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,659
pulling out from your hair also.

410
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:19,090
It is such a dangerous situation in this blind
faith, that you form some habits.

411
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:25,979
You know people have an idea of using the
mala, that’s why Kabira has said “kar

412
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:31,469
kamana ka chade de manna ka manna ka pher”
So they will also say, they will have it “kar

413
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:33,909
kamana man ka chade de manna ka manna ka pher”
finished.

414
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:41,470
Even the children have understood the joke,
this is what we are doing, that when it is

415
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:48,159
told that you have to have God in your heart
and don’t do these rituals, you will find

416
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:54,159
these people using that rosary to such an
extent, that if they are talking they don’t

417
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,940
have that, they cannot sit tight, it’s like
a nervousness in them, it’s a nervousness

418
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:04,500
by which they must go on (aur main to hamesha
mala jappti houn 108 and falaana) and you

419
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:12,379
feel that the person is about to land up in
some lunatic asylum with the number 108.

420
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:19,179
The way people are mad in religion makes people
really atheist they see these mad people what

421
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:21,030
are they doing is the religion?

422
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,149
Is this the religion, where people sell it,
you go to any temple?

423
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:33,660
Once we had bought some Am rood, Guavas and
we went to the temple we were thinking that

424
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,889
we will get out of, then we were very young,
[not clear_], and we were lots of brothers

425
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:45,860
and sisters we went down to a temple and we
thought that after seeing the temple we will

426
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:50,550
go outside behind the temple and we will eat
the thing as soon as we reached there, the

427
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,609
Pujari took out the packets from our hands,
you know, all the children poor things were

428
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:57,490
carrying three, four packets we had and they
took out everything from [not clear_], we

429
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:04,200
were looking at them why did they took out
everything and gave us one each you see, wah

430
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,299
wah !! and we were about to cry, but my younger
sister couldn’t bare it, she said “why

431
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:12,410
did you take away my, all my Guavas?

432
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,150
please return it to me”, but this is sort
of a right they have got to live on your money,

433
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,150
these parasites.

434
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:23,980
In the name of God these parasites, you are
the people who are nurturing them, you just

435
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:29,400
giving them money, it is better to give to
a beggar, then to give to these horrible sophisticated

436
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,060
beggars sitting on the temples and churches.

437
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:39,890
You are the people who are responsible for
creating such a mess because half of the people

438
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:46,609
are indifferent; those who are not indifferent
bhagvaan ke naam pe, half of them are like

439
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:52,780
that who go to one Sidhhi Vinayak mandir and
Mangalwaar day (Tuesday), you will find that

440
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,665
queue of sometimes two miles in that Bombay,
where people have no time for anything.

441
00:35:55,665 --> 00:36:02,849
People are moving with the pace of an Ant,
one inch in one hour, there are some people

442
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:07,730
who start in the night and they move on, they
go with their naariyal and the naariyals,

443
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,080
come from the other side and sold again next
month.

444
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:17,180
They know this; still they say we have done
it with bhakti and Ganesha will give us what

445
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
we like.

446
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,279
Ganesha will only give you wisdom, I wish
he could, I wish he could give you wisdom

447
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:24,420
and understanding about religion.

448
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:31,630
This is a mess we have done out of our religion,
every religion, every religion is not only

449
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,400
Hinduism, Islam or Christianity or Sikhism.

450
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,920
We have really killed the religion by our
indifference, or by too much of indulgence,

451
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,779
blind fold, faith in all these horrible people,
who claim that they are religious people,

452
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:44,880
by what means are they?

453
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,970
Go and see their lifestyle.

454
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:51,680
Go and see what sort of a people they are.

455
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,410
They are raksasha’s some of them I can tell
you, when I went to Vrindavan I felt all the

456
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,500
anucharaas of Kansa are their fundas.

457
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:06,070
All of them not one I found as a human being,
they are such horrible people and the way

458
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,319
they torture you still you go about religion.

459
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:17,859
One has to understand that God stands in His
purity He is a pure being and He likes our

460
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:18,859
wisdom.

461
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:22,120
He doesn’t like people who are stupid and
foolish.

462
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:29,230
He likes wise people, wise people… like,
Prahllad, Prahllad was an eight year old boy,

463
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:38,690
when his father Hiranyakashyup challenged
him, Shri Vishnu appeared in a pillar, you

464
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:50,460
know in a Narsimha avatar and he killed his
father and then he asked this little boy of

465
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,890
eight years Prahllad, he said, “my child,
my devotee, what do you want?”

466
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:05,609
He could have asked for anything, Sakshaat
Vishnu was there, but what does he say, “Tav

467
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:10,089
charna arvinde pritii” Give me love at your
lotus feet, oh my lord that’s all what I

468
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:11,089
want.

469
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:12,329
To love you at your lotus feet.

470
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:18,510
If you have your pure love for God He will
give you wisdom.

471
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:25,289
If you do not have your purity you go there
to ask for this thing and that thing; Give

472
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:32,670
me a transfer, specially government servants,
they are never satisfied, they want to have

473
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:40,770
transfers all the time, Give me a promotion,
Give me a son, when you get a son, give me

474
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,370
a job for my son.

475
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,980
When he gets a job, get him a wife, poor Ganesha
must be tired.

476
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,930
This is what it is, this is not religion,
this is not God, this has nothing to do with

477
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:54,810
spirituality, you have to ask for one thing,
“Tav charna arvinde pritii."

478
00:38:54,810 --> 00:39:02,780
Oh lord let me be at your lotus feet so that
one day my Kundalini would be awakened and

479
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,109
that my atma would be enlightened within my
awareness.

480
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:13,049
Let me keep my life so beautiful, “Ye chaadar
rishi muni jann odhi, Odhi ke meli kini chadariya,Daas

481
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:16,910
Kabir jatan se odhi, Jaisi ki taisi rakh dini
chadariya."

482
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:28,779
This is what we should have done, instead
of that we go to this Tan trick, that bhajji,

483
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:36,391
that Pundit ji, that Pandey ji, or some other
Paadri ji or what you call them other sorts

484
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:41,339
of people those Mullah ji’s and all sorts
of Mau Lana ji’s and Pir’s and all sorts

485
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,569
of things and what do you get?

486
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:44,920
A bad Agnya.

487
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:51,150
They have no right to be there, they are there
because they want to make a business out of

488
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,150
God.

489
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:58,000
Today I spoke about it, because it is important
to understand, what is religion?

490
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:07,359
In India especially I have seen people go
out of the way to do penances in the name

491
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:16,320
of God, which is a great thing, but why do
you do penance, what is there to suffer?

492
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:21,630
Why do you make your body suffer so much?

493
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:30,190
Keep your body alright, don’t overdo things,
keep a moderate life, lead a normal life,

494
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:34,329
that’s what Buddha has told you, there is
no need to go to extremes for anything, but

495
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:41,940
even Buddhist, they have gone to another extreme
so he had to come on this Earth as Shankaracharaya

496
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,359
to tell people what are you doing?

497
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,380
When did I say this?

498
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,859
Then they were born as the son of Fatimabai
[editor’s note to verifier: John Noyce has

499
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:52,050
verified that this is the correct spelling]
who was herself nothing else but Janaki and

500
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:58,910
they were her sons Hassan and Hussein, who
had preached non-violence and they saw that

501
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:03,539
people were trying to save bugs and mosquitoes.

502
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:09,300
You know there are some funny cults where
we are so particular of bugs mosquitoes and

503
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:15,480
all the worms, we are not at all particular
about human beings, they, I don’t know what

504
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,500
am I going to do with bugs?

505
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Am I going to give them realization?

506
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,769
Even chicken’s… am I going to give them
realization?

507
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:21,900
I have to give realization to human beings.

508
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:28,539
What is the need to pay so much attention
to these nonsensical things?

509
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:34,670
To save the bugs and save the mosquitoes and
make them bite the Brahmin and pay them money,

510
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,359
because they think they have done a great
kalyana on the bugs.

511
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:45,380
Perhaps they might have been bugs, in last
lives, the way they are interested in all

512
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,720
these mosquitoes.

513
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:54,260
Now, these two were born as Hassan and Hussein
and to get rid of these ideas of non-violence

514
00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:03,490
they had this Karbala, in which they fought
and died like great shuras (great warriors).

515
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,630
This is a story of great incarnations on this
Earth.

516
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:14,470
There are so many of them who were born, I
have no time to tell you, but Socrates was

517
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,640
the same, his disciple was one of these two.

518
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:26,369
Abraham, Moses, who are propagating Jews their
religion, [not clear] people are another mad,

519
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:32,380
another mad people I can tell you, these Jews,
God save them from their madness, they will

520
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:38,480
make a sum that their books are, say called
as, todhat [not clear], they make it microscopic,

521
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:46,031
the more microscopic it is, the more spiritual
you are and they tie it up here you see, you

522
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:49,930
can’t even read it, you have to use a nice
magnifying glass to read that, they never

523
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,069
read, its tied up here.

524
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:56,390
According to them, if it is studded with diamonds,
then you are a greater spiritual person, they

525
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:04,480
are very rich people you see, so they tie
it up there and before a wailing wall they

526
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:11,710
go and like mad they are beating their heads
there and weeping for what they have done.

527
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:15,470
I mean there is no end to the madness of people.

528
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,660
You can understand that this is not religion.

529
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,750
Now the other day there was one Arya samaji
fellow who came to Me, he could not get his

530
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:30,200
realization; I must tell you these are another
fanatic types we have, Arya samaji, have they

531
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,240
been able to get to their spirit?

532
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,690
They are only bothered about re-converting
the people, marrying the people or building

533
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:42,730
the buildings and saying that, no we don’t
believe in God, we don’t believe in this

534
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:43,730
kind of a God.

535
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,730
We don’t believe in.

536
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:47,200
Who cares whether you believe or not, who
are you?

537
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,050
What right have you got to say anything?

538
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:52,470
It’s like any monkey standing up and saying,
“I don’t believe in this government, I

539
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,910
don’t believe in that government”.

540
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:57,440
Who is bothered about these people who talk
like this.

541
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,329
Who are they?

542
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:02,400
What authority have they got to say what is
good and what is bad.

543
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,610
Do they know what is good and what is bad?

544
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:11,240
To say like these things about, we don’t
believe in this and we don’t believe in

545
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,240
that.

546
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,829
For us it is essential to know that, first
let us know ourselves, let us get our light

547
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:27,089
enlightened and in that light let us see the
truth as it is you cannot ask the truth to

548
00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:29,049
be like this.

549
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:30,049
You cannot organize God.

550
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:33,950
He is what He is, He remain as He is, you
cannot transform Him.

551
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:38,059
Only thing you can do is become one with Him.

552
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:44,650
What you can do is to perceive Him, to feel
Him, to be, that is the thing you can be,

553
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:49,839
but you cannot make God as you like Him, He
is what He is as I have told you.

554
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,270
and the best thing will be that you be humble
like Prahllad, to say, “Tav charna arvinde

555
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:59,609
pritii” Who are we to criticize these incarnations
of Primordial master?

556
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:01,519
What have we done?

557
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:06,710
Like, once somebody started criticizing Me,
so one of my disciples, Bardarf [not clear]

558
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,760
called him, come here, come here, how many
people have you given realization to?

559
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,750
He said “none”, He said, How many people
have you cured?

560
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,819
What good have you done to people?

561
00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:18,200
He said none, what do you do?

562
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,690
He said I am a barber, he said you better
become a barber.

563
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,210
What are you talking here?

564
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,309
What right have you got?

565
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:26,309
What is your position to talk?

566
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:28,410
But in this kalyuga, even a person who does
not even know a word about religion, about

567
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,250
God, who is not awakened, who is not realized,
then talk about God.

568
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,430
This is ghour kalyuga, they are not afraid,
they are not afraid, to make money in the

569
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:45,559
name of God is the greatest sin, is the greatest
sin, I tell you, to make money like that in

570
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:53,410
the name of God and to spoil somebody’s
Kundalini, as these, all these fake Guru’s

571
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,410
are doing.

572
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:58,549
Using there bhoot vidya, they do not know
they will go to hell permanently; absolutely

573
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:03,779
permanently they will be there and there will
be no return from there.

574
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:09,279
They have been given many chances before,
but no more chances for them.

575
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:16,029
We are the people who have to correct them,
we have to stand together and tell them, nothing

576
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:22,369
doing, we had some people in Bombay who are
Brahmins, who are Brahmins, who are Brahmins

577
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:26,130
of the high order as we can call, [not clear]
they are called as and they got their realization.

578
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:31,720
Now they had to be taken up upon yourself
to put down all these horrible fake people

579
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,170
who are making money out of the public.

580
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,869
So one of them is a teacher and he told a
Brahmin in his family, because he was permanently

581
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:42,530
stuck, you see us Brahmins stuck to the families.

582
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:50,680
He said that, “my”, “I have to do the
Shard of my father, when can you come, within

583
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,680
the Pitrupaksh?

584
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,760
He said I can only come on Wednesday or something
like that.

585
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,690
He said are you sure that there is a Muhrata
for that?

586
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,849
Yes, he said, yes very I am sure of it.

587
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:04,500
So he went to another fellow, got the Panchanga,
Maharashtrians, that way know a lot about

588
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,380
these things like Panchanga and all that and
he opened the Panchanga he studied there and

589
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,650
he found out that there was no muhrata, in
any Panchanga whatsoever.

590
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,380
There are three Panchangas which we use, I
don’t know if we know here about it, he

591
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:20,130
saw all of them, then accordingly the muhrata
was on Tuesday, he celebrated it.

592
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:26,960
Then the fellow came, “rehne dijiye, rehne
dijiye, baad mein le lenge rehne do”.

593
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:33,230
Then the fellow came and he said that “I
have come now come along let us have the shard”,

594
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:36,119
He said that “I will not even give you a
cup of tea to you today” He said how?

595
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:40,840
You call me for the Shard I am suppose to
eat at your place, he says no, we have not

596
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,569
cooked anything and I am not going to give
you a cup of tea, if there is no muhrata today,

597
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:48,140
he said according to Tilak Panchanga it is,
he said I have studied also Tilak Panchanga,

598
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,390
I have studied all this, you get out of here.

599
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:54,069
The mother was poor thing you know, she said
“how you can this, he is our old thing”,

600
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:56,819
he said “this is the only chance I have
to get rid of this old fool” and he just

601
00:47:56,819 --> 00:48:03,510
told him, get out you will not stay in this
house and I am not going to give a cup of

602
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,510
tea.

603
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:13,460
Then in Panduranga’s temple, in…, Panduranga’s
temple is there you know about Vitthhalla’s

604
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:24,150
in Panderpur [not clear] we have people going
down there and when I saw these people I was

605
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,950
surprised, they were all crazy people for
a month poor things are singing songs eat

606
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:31,319
little take that nasha of tambacco and go
singing songs for months together they go

607
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:36,230
to see Panduranga there and these people who
live there are called as Badwe, their names

608
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:40,460
are absolutely suited you see, like in Kolapur
they are called as Bhootis, can you imagine?

609
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:44,349
The Brahmins are called as Bhootis and these
are called as Badwe’s.

610
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:49,930
and these people ask them, “How is it, you
have got cracks in your heads?” he said

611
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:54,670
that this Naral, this naariyal or you can
call the coconut was broken at the lotus feet

612
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,480
of Panduranga, I said, how?

613
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,500
I couldn’t understand, these Badwe’s were
doing this job and when I said that these

614
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:08,079
Badwe’s should know if they don’t behave,
they are going to have a very bad time, you

615
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,890
see everybody was shocked but you’ll be
amazed within eight days the government took

616
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,500
over that place and its working out, but now
their language has changed, but this is how

617
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,880
these people have been troubling us, but now
we have got four Brahmins, four Brahmins living

618
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,369
in Panderpur who are after their throat and
they go to the temple and tell people that

619
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:25,529
don’t listen to the [unclear] and they are
propagating and they said that if you want

620
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:32,089
anything you ask us, but don’t give a single
Pai to these Badwa’s, good for nothing,

621
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:37,089
useless, whatever you want to do, you do it
to the deity and don’t touch these people,

622
00:49:37,089 --> 00:49:40,880
treat them as untouchables and these are the
people who have started it.

623
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,859
It is we who can change the people.

624
00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:47,890
Once we get realization, the transformation
starts taking place within us.

625
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:52,640
When the transformation takes place a person
becomes fearless.

626
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:58,130
He is not tempted easily by things, for example
I have known people, who use to take a lot

627
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:03,779
of bribes, have given up taking up bribe,
because their financial condition also improves,

628
00:50:03,779 --> 00:50:08,470
their Lakshmi tatwa is awakened and they do
not take any bribes, their Dharma is jaagrut,

629
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:13,279
they do not drink, many people who were drunkards
have given up drinking, because the Dharma

630
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:14,279
is awakened within us, you just can’t bare
it.

631
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:16,369
Just like a human being cannot bear dirt but
an animal can.

632
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:21,160
In the same way, it happens to you, you just
don’t bear it, you don’t want to have

633
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,160
it anymore.

634
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,270
In the same way, your political situation
will improve, because what is the problem

635
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:28,550
today, what is the problem?

636
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:33,019
if you have went down to Maharashtra and there
the people said that we have a problem of

637
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:37,380
sugar, I said why, you produce a lot of sugar,
he said there is one fellow known as Sugar

638
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,180
king, he has hoarded all the Sugar.

639
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,740
I said really, then why don’t you inform
the police about it?

640
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,540
They said, when Janta government was there
he gave them money, now this government is

641
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,730
here, he gives them money, he gives money
to all police officers, he is driving all

642
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:53,140
of them and he also bribed us and made us
vote for certain people, who are under his

643
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,140
control.

644
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,080
I said, then you are responsible for this.

645
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:03,430
You get your realization and next time only
vote for or stand with a realized soul .Do

646
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:09,180
not vote for anyone who is not a realized
soul and you will see this country will change

647
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:14,280
just like this, the whole situation will change
.It is you who are misusing your votes, in

648
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,049
the villages even for one time need they give
votes.

649
00:51:17,049 --> 00:51:19,259
How are you going to improve your people?

650
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:23,460
How this deterioration is going to stop by
only, by your parivartan, by your transformation,

651
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,270
that’s only possible through Kundalini awakening.

652
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:29,200
When the Kundalini awakening takes place the
man knows his esteem, he stands up like a

653
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:38,270
human being and he doesn’t behave like a
dog, who runs after every position you get,

654
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:42,920
every money you get, “give me, give me”.

655
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,250
It’s not like that.

656
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:50,480
He stands in his dignity and in his [not clear
] and nobody can put him down.

657
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:58,750
This is what it is; the Sahaja Yoga is such
a blessing, for all of us, in all the world,

658
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,240
wherever there is a chaos, it is everywhere
now and so many angles it is going to it,

659
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:08,240
for Samaj Karya also, now in Samaj specially
in the north, you see the condition is very

660
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,930
bad, the woman are treated very shabbily,
they say it’s the influence of the Muslim

661
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:13,580
religion and whatever it is.

662
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:21,559
But if you go to Turkey, you will be surprised
that the people treat woman with such respect

663
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:22,559
and such understanding.

664
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,770
In our own scriptures it is written that:
“Yatra naryastu pujyante ramante tatra Devata”[Manu

665
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:32,640
smriti 3-56] Means, where the woman is respected,
there resides the Gods, but the woman has

666
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,510
to be respectable also, if she is not a respectable,
no use respecting her.

667
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:41,900
It is both ways, but the way we treat our
woman, in the villages, specially in the North,

668
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:48,210
like Bihar, U.P, Punjab, Punjab is now better,
woman have taken over quite a lot.

669
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:52,960
But that should not be the case, woman should
remain woman but men must respect them.

670
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,950
What I mean, that woman must be respected
as they are and men must be respected as they

671
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:58,950
are.

672
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:03,130
They don’t have to change their places but
in these places, all Bengal all of them you

673
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,130
now how [unclear].

674
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,970
Women commit suicides in that country because
they cannot get married and they are put down.

675
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:09,509
If you cannot get married what does it matter?

676
00:53:09,509 --> 00:53:12,509
You have to give dowry, if you don’t give
dowry you cannot get married.

677
00:53:12,509 --> 00:53:16,940
All kinds of problems a husband will come
drunkard, he will beat his wife because he

678
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,540
is fallen in love with another woman, he is
going to some other person .The wife has to

679
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,329
come as out and she becomes a woman who has
no husband, everybody ill treats the woman.

680
00:53:23,329 --> 00:53:26,119
All sorts of things are here, why?

681
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,200
Because we do not understand that woman is
the Shakti.

682
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,730
In her lies the Shakti we have to respect
the women.

683
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:37,990
When the women are not respected that country
goes to dogs and the women must know that

684
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:45,560
they are Shakti and they are to be respectable
and not to be frivolous and cheap the way

685
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,000
Indian women are now taking to western life
I am really shocked that means that our tradition

686
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,150
has no depth in it.

687
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:53,579
That the way we have accepted all these nonsensical
values of the West, where the West has gone

688
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:59,170
to dogs and we are going to dogs for this
I will hold the woman responsible who behave

689
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:05,319
so cheaply on the streets and in the offices
and in the houses.

690
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:09,839
It is the women who have to keep the Dharma
going.

691
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:10,839
Now with this.

692
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:13,619
It is very remarkable, what is happening,
if the mother of the house is not respected,

693
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:18,500
is treated like a servant, she has no place
in the family, husband comes from the office

694
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,940
and shouts at her, children cannot respect
her, they cannot be disciplined, if the mother

695
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,289
is not respected.

696
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:30,560
Your children can never be disciplined.

697
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,569
You see now, you talk of indiscipline, indiscipline
everywhere.

698
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:40,690
I remember, when I was young, we could not
do even a thing without asking our mother.

699
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:47,059
If we had our father we wanted to, he’d
say, “Did you ask your mother?

700
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:51,773
Go and ask your mother” In the family, in
the house she was the Grahalakshmi, she was

701
00:54:51,773 --> 00:54:56,390
given all the keys all the money, not a single
pie was spent without asking her.

702
00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:01,430
But these days, the woman have become so either
very miserly or so extra wagon that men do

703
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,890
not know what to do with them.

704
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:11,539
It was both ways, women have to be wise, they
are the axis the Dhuri of the society, that’s

705
00:55:11,539 --> 00:55:17,650
only possible when they are realized, suddenly
I find very rebellious woman become so, so

706
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:24,720
beautiful, so beautiful and so women like,
so sweet, their, their tongue, their whole

707
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:30,349
behavior everything changes so beautifully,
it’s surprising, even western women I have

708
00:55:30,349 --> 00:55:33,500
seen, who walk like horses normally.

709
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:39,570
If you see them they really walk like horses,
but they change their dresses and their whole

710
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:44,490
thing they become so feminine, so sweet, in
their talks and everything, then what will

711
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,200
happen to Indian women?

712
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:51,289
But men must know they have to respect women,
if they try to dominate their women, they

713
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:55,799
will become the same as the western woman
and you will not know what to do with yourself.

714
00:55:55,799 --> 00:56:01,500
If the woman decides to be bad, there’s
no end to miseries that should not be done.

715
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,289
So, please make it a short circuit and let
us understand that for Sahaja yogi it is important

716
00:56:06,289 --> 00:56:07,450
to respect the wife.

717
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:15,019
So, that there is discipline, still I must
give all my respect to the Indian women, despite

718
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:19,160
all these things, despite the, all the men
have changed their dresses, all the men have

719
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:24,579
become English, Indian women have still kept
their dresses and their discipline.

720
00:56:24,579 --> 00:56:29,240
Our men still think, they are great English
people, but our Indian women are not willing

721
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,240
to accept that situation.

722
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,910
I am not saying that there is something wrong
with English, but if we are Indians we should

723
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,930
be Indians, if they are English they should
be English and in the same way with our life,

724
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:43,260
when there is realization, a woman becomes
a complete woman and a man becomes a complete

725
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:51,579
man and a complete man we have before us is
Shri Rama, how he loved his wife, in separation

726
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:57,839
and in meeting, how he loved and how they
despite all their love, how they suffered.

727
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:02,820
We have before us Shri Rama where he respected
his wife.

728
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:06,730
It is a Seashell for men to understand that
you are Indians and you have to behave like

729
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:07,730
them.

730
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,420
You do not know the greatness of our Indian
women.

731
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:15,539
If you do not treat them well I can assure
you a day will come only very cheap and nasty

732
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:19,569
and what you call demonic women will be born
here and you will be able to enter even your

733
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:20,569
homes.

734
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:23,039
You will be standing outside on your streets.

735
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:29,510
So be careful about it and also you has brought
us before , the way you treat your wife the

736
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:34,490
same way your daughters will be treated even
worse, then you will know what you did, so

737
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:38,349
be kind to her because she has married to
you she is not your slave.

738
00:57:38,349 --> 00:57:39,820
Its is very important.

739
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:44,340
In northern India more because they think
that southern India, Maharashtra and southern

740
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:51,250
India women, men are henpecked unless and
until they beat their wives they are henpecked

741
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,990
according to them.

742
00:57:52,990 --> 00:58:01,499
These ideas must be given up but this is only
possible when you get your realization real

743
00:58:01,499 --> 00:58:08,869
joy of leading a very happy married life extremely
beautiful married life of mutual love and

744
00:58:08,869 --> 00:58:13,190
mutual understanding develops I have seen
this happening to so many people the relationship

745
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:19,210
improving the relationship between parents
and children improving the whole thing becoming

746
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:25,119
so joyous and so beautiful and the children
becoming so obedient and so sweet, it’s

747
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,380
a beautiful thing so when the atmosphere is
fragrant with your spirituality the whole

748
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:37,700
aroma , the whole atmosphere we can say completely
charmed ,absolutely charmed by your peaceful

749
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,700
life.

750
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,690
This is the bliss we have to see .

751
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:45,440
Today I talked about these things because
void is very important thing for us where

752
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:51,119
all our social, samajic, political, rajkiya
and also our spiritual problems can be solved.

753
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:57,609
Apart from that I had told you yesterday about
our physical problems tomorrow I will talk

754
00:58:57,609 --> 00:59:02,630
about other charkas to you I hope you have
understood today’s lecture.

755
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:09,499
I spoke in a very entertaining manner but
you have to know that all this entertainment

756
00:59:09,499 --> 00:59:15,849
has to go within yourself, you have to take
within your self, it’s not meant for others

757
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:19,980
as soon as you say it is for other, the women
will look at the husbands and the husbands

758
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,369
will look at the wives.

759
00:59:21,369 --> 00:59:23,910
They do not know it is meant for you and not
for others.

760
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:30,549
All of you should take it up, that am I doing
this, am I doing this, try to correct yourself,

761
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:36,220
you have to be decent husbands and decent
wives and I would like to see very happy married

762
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:40,529
couples amongst Sahaja Yogis, when this will
happen then the great souls will take birth

763
00:59:40,529 --> 00:59:41,530
on this earth, you will see great people will
be born.

764
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:45,839
Already so many Sahaja Yogis have given birth
to very, very great souls.

765
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:53,990
You will be amazed they know Kundalini from
their very childhood this will happen I am

766
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:59,140
sure one day it will come and that all the
souls who want to take birth will be born

767
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,770
on this earth, especially in India.

768
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:06,280
Already lots of great souls I have seen also
in England, let me go I see in Australia I

769
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,690
am sure it’s happening everywhere.

770
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:13,240
But if you are realized souls you really become
perfect parents and you really invite great

771
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,770
souls on this earth to work it out.
