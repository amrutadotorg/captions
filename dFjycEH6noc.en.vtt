00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.056
Today is the great day,

00:00:06.257 --> 00:00:11.587
when a great son of the Goddess was born,

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:15.589
at least it is celebrated today.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:20.482
And you are all assembled here

00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:28.517
to celebrate the birthday of Christ.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:38.263
You already know how He came on this earth,

00:00:38.464 --> 00:00:42.668
and what was His great work.

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:47.661
But we must see to the subtle side
of Christ.

00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:51.247
What was His power?

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:57.438
Christ’s power was, of course, Omkara.

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:02.369
His power was Pranava.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.769
But the essence of Christ

00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:17.849
was tapasya, tapasvita.

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:24.805
He is the incarnation of tapasya,

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:36.961
and in that incarnation is a sinless
personality.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.608
He's sinless.

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:53.225
Of course incarnations never commit sins.

00:01:54.067 --> 00:02:01.445
But apparently things that look like sins

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:05.440
are also not in His life story.

00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:11.382
Like one can say that Shri Rama gave up
His wife, so it is a sinful thing.

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:14.368
Of course those who understand
the subtleties of Shri Rama's life

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.992
will know that it's stupid to say such
a thing.

00:02:17.193 --> 00:02:21.647
Or Shri Krishna's life, they might say
He married so many women.

00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:28.429
But in Christ's life you do not find
anything

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.688
that could be pointed out as a mistake,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.360
even a slightest mistake.

00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:43.135
It's a very straightforward life,
absolutely pure life

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:53.632
and doing no commitments of ambiguous
nature.

00:02:56.566 --> 00:03:01.210
But it's very surprising that Christianity

00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:06.179
is just the opposite of what Christ
wanted it to be.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.151
They painted Him so differently,

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:15.289
brought Him out so differently
and made a mess of His life.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.263
Terrible mess I must say,

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:26.053
because He was the person who tried to keep

00:03:26.254 --> 00:03:31.875
to the maryadas of the dharma
to the maximum.

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:40.969
And while the Christians stretched their
imagination to such an extent

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:48.557
that their sinful life is shocking,

00:03:48.758 --> 00:03:54.799
the kind of sins they commit is extremely
shocking.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.320
For example, He said in a very subtle way,

00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:05.113
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:04:05.572 --> 00:04:09.931
Even in Sahaja Yoga I find people still
have this problem.

00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:13.689
What a sinful thing to do to Christ.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:22.291
For Christians to have such eyes which
are adulterous,

00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:29.080
and they are the people who have
the maximum number of this sin.

00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:34.296
Not only that, but they generate it, they
give it to others.

00:04:34.497 --> 00:04:39.644
Those who go to them, they develop it.

00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:46.610
Those who meet them, they take it up
as something very great and elite.

00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:50.875
It's such an infectious horrible stuff,

00:04:51.076 --> 00:04:58.718
and even after coming to Sahaja Yoga
if you do not understand,

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.257
I cannot say what one can achieve in life.

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:09.010
Because He's the gate. You may cross
over all your chakras,

00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:13.631
but if you are closed at that chakra
you cannot get out.

00:05:13.832 --> 00:05:19.390
The kind of sinful life people are leading
in the western country

00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:26.319
has to be absolutely condemned and has
to be thrown out of it,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.172
and nobody should explain it.

00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:34.811
Nobody should say that it is something,
is just a sin,

00:05:35.012 --> 00:05:41.341
and all right, Mother will forgive, all
this kind of a nonsense.

00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:48.110
Is the greatest wrong you are doing
to yourself and to Christ.

00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:55.159
The abandonment of your character,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:02.092
which was just the opposite of the golden
character of Christ.

00:06:02.293 --> 00:06:10.284
He burnt Himself like chandan, sandalwood.

00:06:10.485 --> 00:06:17.929
Like gold He came out of that fire of hell

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.718
to burn away all that is sinful.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.781
So the first attention of anybody who
wants to cross the Agnya

00:06:27.982 --> 00:06:34.059
has to be a sinless life,

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.104
and that is what one has to realize

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.424
that how, in the West, they have become
all anti-Christ.

00:06:45.387 --> 00:06:52.420
On this day of His birth, one has to say

00:06:52.621 --> 00:07:00.820
that a great life, a great personality,

00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:06.297
was not only wasted, but perverted,
misused.

00:07:06.854 --> 00:07:12.254
Just can't believe, how can you use
the life of Christ

00:07:12.455 --> 00:07:17.299
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things?

00:07:21.714 --> 00:07:28.971
We have one instance where Christ
converted water into wine.

00:07:29.172 --> 00:07:36.382
I can do it also - very easy. The wine
is not the alcohol.

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:43.723
Alcohol is the rotten wine. You have
to rot it for days together

00:07:43.924 --> 00:07:47.637
and the more rotten it is, the more
old it is,

00:07:47.838 --> 00:07:51.795
then it is regarded as something
very expensive.

00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:55.851
The whole idea is so ridiculous,
I tell you,

00:07:56.052 --> 00:08:02.738
so repulsive, absolutely below

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:06.705
the dignity of human level to bring down
Christ

00:08:06.906 --> 00:08:12.619
into all these social lives that you are
leading there.

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:19.002
For you it is important now, all the Sahaja
Yogis from the West,

00:08:19.203 --> 00:08:25.412
to stand up and make your life pure,

00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:30.947
make yourself pure, and hate all

00:08:31.148 --> 00:08:34.994
that is created in the name
of Christianity.

00:08:35.195 --> 00:08:37.892
Actually, thank God, they have found out
now

00:08:38.092 --> 00:08:43.396
the book written by Thomas who has
described

00:08:43.597 --> 00:08:46.514
the Gnostic way of life, where "gna"
means "to know".

00:08:46.715 --> 00:08:51.266
In Sanskrit language, "gn" means "to know",
"gnya".

00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:54.960
So he has described very nicely
the gnostic light.

00:08:55.161 --> 00:09:02.397
This Gnostic Bible, or whatever you may
call it,

00:09:02.598 --> 00:09:09.840
says about a personal experience
of achieving

00:09:10.818 --> 00:09:14.059
God realization, Self-realization.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.627
It talks about Sahaj Yog out and out.

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:23.657
Thomas on his way to India, went to Egypt

00:09:23.858 --> 00:09:31.719
and there he has put this in a big vessel
of some metal.

00:09:32.817 --> 00:09:36.145
Thank God it was done in Egypt,

00:09:36.346 --> 00:09:39.425
otherwise in any other place

00:09:39.626 --> 00:09:44.676
they would have used it for some other
purpose,

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.980
and already it would have been a perverted
thing.

00:09:49.181 --> 00:09:54.179
It's important, and very important for all
of us

00:09:55.749 --> 00:09:59.747
to understand that the first and foremost
thing for us

00:09:59.947 --> 00:10:02.861
is to purify our attention.

00:10:03.062 --> 00:10:05.519
And for that Tukarama has said,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:13.446
"Thank God, if I become blind is better."

00:10:21.918 --> 00:10:24.809
He was born in a very humble place

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.744
because He was a tapasvi.

00:10:28.945 --> 00:10:32.992
For a tapasvi it doesn't matter where
you are,

00:10:33.193 --> 00:10:40.332
whether you are in a humble place or
you are in an elaborate place.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:46.200
It doesn't matter where you are born
in a very humble way.

00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:57.120
And this humility of His is never, never
expressed in the western lives.

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:10.069
On the contrary, I find they despise people
who are humble,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.656
the humble abodes are despised.

00:11:13.857 --> 00:11:22.799
Now it is for you people to bring back
the glory of Christ,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.271
to bring back the dharma of Christ,

00:11:28.472 --> 00:11:33.167
to reflect the great image of Christ.

00:11:33.368 --> 00:11:38.005
When people say that you had no ideals,
I'm amazed.

00:11:38.206 --> 00:11:46.490
Who could be a better ideal than Jesus
Christ?

00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:49.650
Can't think of anybody better,

00:11:49.851 --> 00:11:57.437
but nobody tries to follow Him, only try
to use Him for wrong purposes.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.484
Christmas means they are all must be drunk
already everywhere,

00:12:02.685 --> 00:12:09.856
already drunk, and maybe they might have
had all kinds of programs

00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:15.687
to show that they are absolutely insulting
Christ.

00:12:15.888 --> 00:12:17.987
So today we have to pray for them,

00:12:18.188 --> 00:12:21.734
that may God give them some sense,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.091
not to do these things in the name
of Christ.

00:12:24.292 --> 00:12:26.663
They can do in the name of Satan
is all right,

00:12:26.864 --> 00:12:32.838
but in the name of Christ to do all these
things is extremely wrong.

00:12:35.957 --> 00:12:39.705
So coming to His Mother,

00:12:40.928 --> 00:12:44.838
She was the power behind it.

00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:49.229
And in India still all those people who
believe in Christ

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:54.093
do respect Her as something like a Goddess.

00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:58.255
But other Indians, who are not Christians,

00:12:58.456 --> 00:13:05.986
really think Her to be Goddess, and they
visit Her temples all over.

00:13:06.345 --> 00:13:10.870
She was Mahalakshmi. And She was
Mahalakshmi,

00:13:11.071 --> 00:13:16.511
which shows that people who follow
the Mahalakshmi principle

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:23.040
are beyond the material understanding
of life,

00:13:23.241 --> 00:13:25.405
beyond the Lakshmi principle.

00:13:25.606 --> 00:13:28.644
On the contrary, what we find,

00:13:28.845 --> 00:13:35.919
they are extremely conscious about
the material wealth.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.004
You should see how it shows so clearly.

00:13:39.205 --> 00:13:43.649
Anything that they will buy, they would
like to buy something that can sell.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.789
It must have a guarantee.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.352
Even if they want to have anything

00:13:51.553 --> 00:13:57.754
like a small little spoon, they would like
to see a brand behind it.

00:13:59.058 --> 00:14:02.338
All the time they are thinking what can
they sell

00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:07.088
and what can they buy to sell it.

00:14:07.327 --> 00:14:12.344
The attention doesn't go beyond that.
Moreover,

00:14:12.545 --> 00:14:22.090
they are very much impressed by people who
wear something rather expensive or unique.

00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:27.073
One day I was wearing a ring, I think,
it's an old ring of mine.

00:14:27.274 --> 00:14:29.192
For me it was nothing, I mean I just
thought

00:14:29.393 --> 00:14:32.944
it's an old ring and was matching with
the sari, so I wore it.

00:14:33.145 --> 00:14:35.428
Everybody started saying Me, "Madam,
Madam, Madam."

00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:37.332
I said, "What has happened?"

00:14:37.533 --> 00:14:41.114
Started looking, I'm wearing a simple sari,
what is it?

00:14:41.315 --> 00:14:45.057
Then one lady asked Me, "Is that
a real ring?"

00:14:45.258 --> 00:14:49.424
I said, "Yes, yes, yes, so?"
"Oh Madam, Madam, Madam!"

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:52.823
I was amazed. Otherwise, I had no value,

00:14:53.024 --> 00:14:56.267
except for that ring, for which I had
no value at all.

00:14:56.474 --> 00:15:00.193
I just wore it by chance. It's an old ring
from My family.

00:15:00.394 --> 00:15:03.735
All right, it might be real. So what?

00:15:03.937 --> 00:15:08.685
Immediately you become "madam" if you
wear a ring.

00:15:09.567 --> 00:15:13.889
It's very surprising. But in this country

00:15:14.099 --> 00:15:19.164
if you are going in a big car, people
don't like you much.

00:15:19.365 --> 00:15:22.375
If you are going in a big car, and you
want to buy some vegetables,

00:15:22.576 --> 00:15:27.060
they will say, "Oh, how much black-market
money have you got?"

00:15:28.381 --> 00:15:31.868
Not much respect for people who have money.

00:15:32.077 --> 00:15:34.606
Of course, you are expected to dress up

00:15:34.816 --> 00:15:38.518
according to your status in life. But
that's all.

00:15:38.719 --> 00:15:40.830
Those who wear do not have
the consciousness,

00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:45.349
and those who see them do not have
the consciousness.

00:15:46.973 --> 00:15:51.323
It is something very surprising, that where
you are supposed

00:15:51.524 --> 00:15:54.689
to be worshipping the Mahalakshmi
principle,

00:15:54.890 --> 00:16:00.564
people just get absolutely blown off

00:16:00.765 --> 00:16:04.989
if they see something extraordinary.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:11.980
I have seen people, I mean very, supposed
to be,

00:16:12.184 --> 00:16:16.258
you can say high class ambassadors
and all that.

00:16:16.459 --> 00:16:19.710
If they come to My house. they would
like to turn

00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:27.112
the plate to see from where it comes,

00:16:27.346 --> 00:16:31.908
or they would like to, even to see
the spoon from where it comes.

00:16:32.109 --> 00:16:34.101
It's very surprising.

00:16:34.302 --> 00:16:39.503
Actually, we do not know in this country
what comes from where, what is the mark.

00:16:39.704 --> 00:16:42.253
We don't have any marks, nothing
of the kind.

00:16:42.454 --> 00:16:47.281
And we are existing alright, nothing
wrong with us.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.739
This kind of mental attitude towards life

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:59.084
and the mental projections towards life

00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:03.273
makes you absolutely gross,

00:17:03.474 --> 00:17:07.755
while Christ was the subtle, complete
subtle.

00:17:07.956 --> 00:17:12.824
It was nothing but subtlety itself
personified.

00:17:13.025 --> 00:17:20.006
He was so subtle, He was such a sukshma
that He walked on the water.

00:17:20.968 --> 00:17:27.807
He was nothing but pranava, just
vibrations.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.759
He walked on the water.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.069
There was no jada tattwa in Him.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.539
There was no gross principle in Him,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:46.362
and while the people who follow Him are
following nothing but the jada tattwa.

00:17:46.614 --> 00:17:50.495
I have to now request you all today

00:17:50.696 --> 00:17:54.826
to understand that when we are celebrating
the birthday of Christ,

00:17:55.027 --> 00:18:01.065
we have to imbibe His qualities, His
subtleties, His greatness.

00:18:01.266 --> 00:18:05.833
Also, I would request Indians, because they
are also becoming westernized now,

00:18:06.034 --> 00:18:09.384
thinking that western people are
the wisest.

00:18:09.585 --> 00:18:12.071
They have to understand

00:18:12.272 --> 00:18:17.876
also that we should try to be subtler and
subtler, and not gross,

00:18:18.088 --> 00:18:22.948
and this is what is important in Sahaja
Yoga culture.

00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:28.707
In Sahaja Yoga culture, our attention is
on the subtle things.

00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:32.616
On the beautiful varieties of subtleties.

00:18:32.817 --> 00:18:38.931
To see all the sweetness and the goodness,

00:18:39.132 --> 00:18:52.346
all the artistic, aesthetic projections
of human mind.

00:18:52.547 --> 00:18:56.305
Not the gross, not the grotesque.

00:18:56.506 --> 00:19:00.023
It's going to be a new culture for us.

00:19:00.224 --> 00:19:02.243
We have started the dharma, all right.

00:19:02.444 --> 00:19:04.849
But every dharma has to have a culture

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:14.200
and we are the culture of sukshma,
of the subtler life.

00:19:14.401 --> 00:19:17.973
That doesn't mean we should be untidy

00:19:18.174 --> 00:19:21.971
or any way funny type, funny looking
people.

00:19:22.172 --> 00:19:28.898
Subtler people are the most beautiful,
are the most congenial,

00:19:29.099 --> 00:19:39.504
are the most idealistic, and are the most
honorable like Christ.

00:19:39.705 --> 00:19:43.063
So for us the ideal is Christ.

00:19:43.264 --> 00:19:47.043
Of course, I don't expect you to crucify
yourself.

00:19:47.244 --> 00:19:52.476
But always willing to sacrifice,

00:19:52.677 --> 00:19:59.632
coping with all the discomforts and
problems

00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:06.165
and not talking about yourself, not
worrying about yourself,

00:20:06.366 --> 00:20:11.592
not discussing other and judging others,

00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:16.945
but giving assurances to people,

00:20:17.146 --> 00:20:24.905
that now we are at this level, we'll be
at a higher level,

00:20:25.106 --> 00:20:29.248
and all the world has to come up
to that level.

00:20:29.449 --> 00:20:33.760
Very positive talking, very positive
thinking

00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:38.980
and very positive doing is the way you
can really follow Christ.

00:20:39.181 --> 00:20:48.806
Whatever He had to do, He did it with
such grace and beauty.

00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:54.869
That is what it is. So we have to be born
like Christ today.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:21:01.921
You are all born like Christ because you
are born without the Father,

00:21:02.122 --> 00:21:07.240
by the Holy Ghost, just like Christ was
born.

00:21:07.441 --> 00:21:11.567
But look at Him and look at yourself,

00:21:11.768 --> 00:21:15.791
born the same way as He was born.

00:21:15.992 --> 00:21:22.871
So you must respect yourself as He
respected Himself.

00:21:23.072 --> 00:21:29.139
And the way He worked out His resurrection.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.809
In the same way, you all have to work out
your resurrection,

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.368
and that is very important.

00:21:35.733 --> 00:21:38.845
Today you have to just ask just one thing
from Me, that

00:21:39.046 --> 00:21:42.089
"Oh, Mother, today we ask you to give us

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:49.628
that power of penance, of tapasya
of Christ."

00:21:49.829 --> 00:21:54.807
I wish this would be granted today and
you will become tapasvis.

00:21:55.008 --> 00:21:58.803
May God bless you all.

00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:32.796
Happy Christmas to you.
Yogis: Happy Christmas, Shri Mataji.

00:23:32.997 --> 00:23:35.344
Shri Mataji: Today you have sucked
My vibrations alright.

00:23:35.545 --> 00:23:37.491
May God bless you all.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.687
May God bless you all.
