WEBVTT

00:02.860 --> 00:06.056
Today is the great day,

00:06.257 --> 00:11.587
when a great son of the Goddess was born,

00:12.103 --> 00:15.589
at least it is celebrated today.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.482
And you are all assembled here

00:20.683 --> 00:28.517
to celebrate the birthday of Christ.

00:32.366 --> 00:38.263
You already know how He came on this earth,

00:38.464 --> 00:42.668
and what was His great work.

00:42.869 --> 00:47.661
But we must see to the subtle side
of Christ.

00:47.862 --> 00:51.247
What was His power?

00:52.566 --> 00:57.438
Christâ€™s power was, of course, Omkara.

00:57.639 --> 01:02.369
His power was Pranava.

01:03.850 --> 01:07.769
But the essence of Christ

01:09.061 --> 01:17.849
was tapasya, tapasvita.

01:20.365 --> 01:24.805
He is the incarnation of tapasya,

01:26.587 --> 01:36.961
and in that incarnation is a sinless
personality.

01:45.810 --> 01:48.608
He's sinless.

01:48.809 --> 01:53.225
Of course incarnations never commit sins.

01:54.067 --> 02:01.445
But apparently things that look like sins

02:01.654 --> 02:05.440
are also not in His life story.

02:05.641 --> 02:11.382
Like one can say that Shri Rama gave up
His wife, so it is a sinful thing.

02:11.583 --> 02:14.368
Of course those who understand
the subtleties of Shri Rama's life

02:14.569 --> 02:16.992
will know that it's stupid to say such
a thing.

02:17.193 --> 02:21.647
Or Shri Krishna's life, they might say
He married so many women.

02:21.848 --> 02:28.429
But in Christ's life you do not find
anything

02:28.630 --> 02:31.688
that could be pointed out as a mistake,

02:31.900 --> 02:36.360
even a slightest mistake.

02:36.561 --> 02:43.135
It's a very straightforward life,
absolutely pure life

02:43.339 --> 02:53.632
and doing no commitments of ambiguous
nature.

02:56.566 --> 03:01.210
But it's very surprising that Christianity

03:01.411 --> 03:06.179
is just the opposite of what Christ
wanted it to be.

03:06.380 --> 03:09.151
They painted Him so differently,

03:09.355 --> 03:15.289
brought Him out so differently
and made a mess of His life.

03:15.490 --> 03:18.263
Terrible mess I must say,

03:18.464 --> 03:26.053
because He was the person who tried to keep

03:26.254 --> 03:31.875
to the maryadas of the dharma
to the maximum.

03:32.076 --> 03:40.969
And while the Christians stretched their
imagination to such an extent

03:41.199 --> 03:48.557
that their sinful life is shocking,

03:48.758 --> 03:54.799
the kind of sins they commit is extremely
shocking.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.320
For example, He said in a very subtle way,

04:00.521 --> 04:05.113
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

04:05.572 --> 04:09.931
Even in Sahaja Yoga I find people still
have this problem.

04:10.141 --> 04:13.689
What a sinful thing to do to Christ.

04:13.890 --> 04:22.291
For Christians to have such eyes which
are adulterous,

04:22.492 --> 04:29.080
and they are the people who have
the maximum number of this sin.

04:29.281 --> 04:34.296
Not only that, but they generate it, they
give it to others.

04:34.497 --> 04:39.644
Those who go to them, they develop it.

04:39.845 --> 04:46.610
Those who meet them, they take it up
as something very great and elite.

04:46.811 --> 04:50.875
It's such an infectious horrible stuff,

04:51.076 --> 04:58.718
and even after coming to Sahaja Yoga
if you do not understand,

04:58.919 --> 05:04.257
I cannot say what one can achieve in life.

05:04.458 --> 05:09.010
Because He's the gate. You may cross
over all your chakras,

05:09.211 --> 05:13.631
but if you are closed at that chakra
you cannot get out.

05:13.832 --> 05:19.390
The kind of sinful life people are leading
in the western country

05:19.591 --> 05:26.319
has to be absolutely condemned and has
to be thrown out of it,

05:26.520 --> 05:30.172
and nobody should explain it.

05:30.373 --> 05:34.811
Nobody should say that it is something,
is just a sin,

05:35.012 --> 05:41.341
and all right, Mother will forgive, all
this kind of a nonsense.

05:42.136 --> 05:48.110
Is the greatest wrong you are doing
to yourself and to Christ.

05:48.311 --> 05:55.159
The abandonment of your character,

05:55.360 --> 06:02.092
which was just the opposite of the golden
character of Christ.

06:02.293 --> 06:10.284
He burnt Himself like chandan, sandalwood.

06:10.485 --> 06:17.929
Like gold He came out of that fire of hell

06:18.130 --> 06:22.718
to burn away all that is sinful.

06:23.040 --> 06:27.781
So the first attention of anybody who
wants to cross the Agnya

06:27.982 --> 06:34.059
has to be a sinless life,

06:34.260 --> 06:38.104
and that is what one has to realize

06:38.320 --> 06:44.424
that how, in the West, they have become
all anti-Christ.

06:45.387 --> 06:52.420
On this day of His birth, one has to say

06:52.621 --> 07:00.820
that a great life, a great personality,

07:01.021 --> 07:06.297
was not only wasted, but perverted,
misused.

07:06.854 --> 07:12.254
Just can't believe, how can you use
the life of Christ

07:12.455 --> 07:17.299
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things?

07:21.714 --> 07:28.971
We have one instance where Christ
converted water into wine.

07:29.172 --> 07:36.382
I can do it also - very easy. The wine
is not the alcohol.

07:36.583 --> 07:43.723
Alcohol is the rotten wine. You have
to rot it for days together

07:43.924 --> 07:47.637
and the more rotten it is, the more
old it is,

07:47.838 --> 07:51.795
then it is regarded as something
very expensive.

07:51.996 --> 07:55.851
The whole idea is so ridiculous,
I tell you,

07:56.052 --> 08:02.738
so repulsive, absolutely below

08:02.939 --> 08:06.705
the dignity of human level to bring down
Christ

08:06.906 --> 08:12.619
into all these social lives that you are
leading there.

08:14.729 --> 08:19.002
For you it is important now, all the Sahaja
Yogis from the West,

08:19.203 --> 08:25.412
to stand up and make your life pure,

08:26.461 --> 08:30.947
make yourself pure, and hate all

08:31.148 --> 08:34.994
that is created in the name
of Christianity.

08:35.195 --> 08:37.892
Actually, thank God, they have found out
now

08:38.092 --> 08:43.396
the book written by Thomas who has
described

08:43.597 --> 08:46.514
the Gnostic way of life, where "gna"
means "to know".

08:46.715 --> 08:51.266
In Sanskrit language, "gn" means "to know",
"gnya".

08:51.467 --> 08:54.960
So he has described very nicely
the gnostic light.

08:55.161 --> 09:02.397
This Gnostic Bible, or whatever you may
call it,

09:02.598 --> 09:09.840
says about a personal experience
of achieving

09:10.818 --> 09:14.059
God realization, Self-realization.

09:14.260 --> 09:17.627
It talks about Sahaj Yog out and out.

09:17.828 --> 09:23.657
Thomas on his way to India, went to Egypt

09:23.858 --> 09:31.719
and there he has put this in a big vessel
of some metal.

09:32.817 --> 09:36.145
Thank God it was done in Egypt,

09:36.346 --> 09:39.425
otherwise in any other place

09:39.626 --> 09:44.676
they would have used it for some other
purpose,

09:44.910 --> 09:48.980
and already it would have been a perverted
thing.

09:49.181 --> 09:54.179
It's important, and very important for all
of us

09:55.749 --> 09:59.747
to understand that the first and foremost
thing for us

09:59.947 --> 10:02.861
is to purify our attention.

10:03.062 --> 10:05.519
And for that Tukarama has said,

10:05.720 --> 10:13.446
"Thank God, if I become blind is better."

10:21.918 --> 10:24.809
He was born in a very humble place

10:25.010 --> 10:28.744
because He was a tapasvi.

10:28.945 --> 10:32.992
For a tapasvi it doesn't matter where
you are,

10:33.193 --> 10:40.332
whether you are in a humble place or
you are in an elaborate place.

10:41.900 --> 10:46.200
It doesn't matter where you are born
in a very humble way.

10:46.401 --> 10:57.120
And this humility of His is never, never
expressed in the western lives.

11:01.293 --> 11:10.069
On the contrary, I find they despise people
who are humble,

11:10.800 --> 11:13.656
the humble abodes are despised.

11:13.857 --> 11:22.799
Now it is for you people to bring back
the glory of Christ,

11:23.000 --> 11:28.271
to bring back the dharma of Christ,

11:28.472 --> 11:33.167
to reflect the great image of Christ.

11:33.368 --> 11:38.005
When people say that you had no ideals,
I'm amazed.

11:38.206 --> 11:46.490
Who could be a better ideal than Jesus
Christ?

11:46.691 --> 11:49.650
Can't think of anybody better,

11:49.851 --> 11:57.437
but nobody tries to follow Him, only try
to use Him for wrong purposes.

11:57.780 --> 12:02.484
Christmas means they are all must be drunk
already everywhere,

12:02.685 --> 12:09.856
already drunk, and maybe they might have
had all kinds of programs

12:11.431 --> 12:15.687
to show that they are absolutely insulting
Christ.

12:15.888 --> 12:17.987
So today we have to pray for them,

12:18.188 --> 12:21.734
that may God give them some sense,

12:21.940 --> 12:24.091
not to do these things in the name
of Christ.

12:24.292 --> 12:26.663
They can do in the name of Satan
is all right,

12:26.864 --> 12:32.838
but in the name of Christ to do all these
things is extremely wrong.

12:35.957 --> 12:39.705
So coming to His Mother,

12:40.928 --> 12:44.838
She was the power behind it.

12:45.039 --> 12:49.229
And in India still all those people who
believe in Christ

12:49.430 --> 12:54.093
do respect Her as something like a Goddess.

12:54.294 --> 12:58.255
But other Indians, who are not Christians,

12:58.456 --> 13:05.986
really think Her to be Goddess, and they
visit Her temples all over.

13:06.345 --> 13:10.870
She was Mahalakshmi. And She was
Mahalakshmi,

13:11.071 --> 13:16.511
which shows that people who follow
the Mahalakshmi principle

13:16.712 --> 13:23.040
are beyond the material understanding
of life,

13:23.241 --> 13:25.405
beyond the Lakshmi principle.

13:25.606 --> 13:28.644
On the contrary, what we find,

13:28.845 --> 13:35.919
they are extremely conscious about
the material wealth.

13:36.120 --> 13:39.004
You should see how it shows so clearly.

13:39.205 --> 13:43.649
Anything that they will buy, they would
like to buy something that can sell.

13:43.850 --> 13:46.789
It must have a guarantee.

13:46.990 --> 13:51.352
Even if they want to have anything

13:51.553 --> 13:57.754
like a small little spoon, they would like
to see a brand behind it.

13:59.058 --> 14:02.338
All the time they are thinking what can
they sell

14:02.539 --> 14:07.088
and what can they buy to sell it.

14:07.327 --> 14:12.344
The attention doesn't go beyond that.
Moreover,

14:12.545 --> 14:22.090
they are very much impressed by people who
wear something rather expensive or unique.

14:22.291 --> 14:27.073
One day I was wearing a ring, I think,
it's an old ring of mine.

14:27.274 --> 14:29.192
For me it was nothing, I mean I just
thought

14:29.393 --> 14:32.944
it's an old ring and was matching with
the sari, so I wore it.

14:33.145 --> 14:35.428
Everybody started saying Me, "Madam,
Madam, Madam."

14:35.629 --> 14:37.332
I said, "What has happened?"

14:37.533 --> 14:41.114
Started looking, I'm wearing a simple sari,
what is it?

14:41.315 --> 14:45.057
Then one lady asked Me, "Is that
a real ring?"

14:45.258 --> 14:49.424
I said, "Yes, yes, yes, so?"
"Oh Madam, Madam, Madam!"

14:49.625 --> 14:52.823
I was amazed. Otherwise, I had no value,

14:53.024 --> 14:56.267
except for that ring, for which I had
no value at all.

14:56.474 --> 15:00.193
I just wore it by chance. It's an old ring
from My family.

15:00.394 --> 15:03.735
All right, it might be real. So what?

15:03.937 --> 15:08.685
Immediately you become "madam" if you
wear a ring.

15:09.567 --> 15:13.889
It's very surprising. But in this country

15:14.099 --> 15:19.164
if you are going in a big car, people
don't like you much.

15:19.365 --> 15:22.375
If you are going in a big car, and you
want to buy some vegetables,

15:22.576 --> 15:27.060
they will say, "Oh, how much black-market
money have you got?"

15:28.381 --> 15:31.868
Not much respect for people who have money.

15:32.077 --> 15:34.606
Of course, you are expected to dress up

15:34.816 --> 15:38.518
according to your status in life. But
that's all.

15:38.719 --> 15:40.830
Those who wear do not have
the consciousness,

15:41.031 --> 15:45.349
and those who see them do not have
the consciousness.

15:46.973 --> 15:51.323
It is something very surprising, that where
you are supposed

15:51.524 --> 15:54.689
to be worshipping the Mahalakshmi
principle,

15:54.890 --> 16:00.564
people just get absolutely blown off

16:00.765 --> 16:04.989
if they see something extraordinary.

16:05.190 --> 16:11.980
I have seen people, I mean very, supposed
to be,

16:12.184 --> 16:16.258
you can say high class ambassadors
and all that.

16:16.459 --> 16:19.710
If they come to My house. they would
like to turn

16:19.911 --> 16:27.112
the plate to see from where it comes,

16:27.346 --> 16:31.908
or they would like to, even to see
the spoon from where it comes.

16:32.109 --> 16:34.101
It's very surprising.

16:34.302 --> 16:39.503
Actually, we do not know in this country
what comes from where, what is the mark.

16:39.704 --> 16:42.253
We don't have any marks, nothing
of the kind.

16:42.454 --> 16:47.281
And we are existing alright, nothing
wrong with us.

16:48.440 --> 16:53.739
This kind of mental attitude towards life

16:53.940 --> 16:59.084
and the mental projections towards life

16:59.285 --> 17:03.273
makes you absolutely gross,

17:03.474 --> 17:07.755
while Christ was the subtle, complete
subtle.

17:07.956 --> 17:12.824
It was nothing but subtlety itself
personified.

17:13.025 --> 17:20.006
He was so subtle, He was such a sukshma
that He walked on the water.

17:20.968 --> 17:27.807
He was nothing but pranava, just
vibrations.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.759
He walked on the water.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.069
There was no jada tattwa in Him.

17:33.270 --> 17:36.539
There was no gross principle in Him,

17:36.740 --> 17:46.362
and while the people who follow Him are
following nothing but the jada tattwa.

17:46.614 --> 17:50.495
I have to now request you all today

17:50.696 --> 17:54.826
to understand that when we are celebrating
the birthday of Christ,

17:55.027 --> 18:01.065
we have to imbibe His qualities, His
subtleties, His greatness.

18:01.266 --> 18:05.833
Also, I would request Indians, because they
are also becoming westernized now,

18:06.034 --> 18:09.384
thinking that western people are
the wisest.

18:09.585 --> 18:12.071
They have to understand

18:12.272 --> 18:17.876
also that we should try to be subtler and
subtler, and not gross,

18:18.088 --> 18:22.948
and this is what is important in Sahaja
Yoga culture.

18:23.149 --> 18:28.707
In Sahaja Yoga culture, our attention is
on the subtle things.

18:28.908 --> 18:32.616
On the beautiful varieties of subtleties.

18:32.817 --> 18:38.931
To see all the sweetness and the goodness,

18:39.132 --> 18:52.346
all the artistic, aesthetic projections
of human mind.

18:52.547 --> 18:56.305
Not the gross, not the grotesque.

18:56.506 --> 19:00.023
It's going to be a new culture for us.

19:00.224 --> 19:02.243
We have started the dharma, all right.

19:02.444 --> 19:04.849
But every dharma has to have a culture

19:05.061 --> 19:14.200
and we are the culture of sukshma,
of the subtler life.

19:14.401 --> 19:17.973
That doesn't mean we should be untidy

19:18.174 --> 19:21.971
or any way funny type, funny looking
people.

19:22.172 --> 19:28.898
Subtler people are the most beautiful,
are the most congenial,

19:29.099 --> 19:39.504
are the most idealistic, and are the most
honorable like Christ.

19:39.705 --> 19:43.063
So for us the ideal is Christ.

19:43.264 --> 19:47.043
Of course, I don't expect you to crucify
yourself.

19:47.244 --> 19:52.476
But always willing to sacrifice,

19:52.677 --> 19:59.632
coping with all the discomforts and
problems

19:59.833 --> 20:06.165
and not talking about yourself, not
worrying about yourself,

20:06.366 --> 20:11.592
not discussing other and judging others,

20:11.793 --> 20:16.945
but giving assurances to people,

20:17.146 --> 20:24.905
that now we are at this level, we'll be
at a higher level,

20:25.106 --> 20:29.248
and all the world has to come up
to that level.

20:29.449 --> 20:33.760
Very positive talking, very positive
thinking

20:33.961 --> 20:38.980
and very positive doing is the way you
can really follow Christ.

20:39.181 --> 20:48.806
Whatever He had to do, He did it with
such grace and beauty.

20:49.417 --> 20:54.869
That is what it is. So we have to be born
like Christ today.

20:55.070 --> 21:01.921
You are all born like Christ because you
are born without the Father,

21:02.122 --> 21:07.240
by the Holy Ghost, just like Christ was
born.

21:07.441 --> 21:11.567
But look at Him and look at yourself,

21:11.768 --> 21:15.791
born the same way as He was born.

21:15.992 --> 21:22.871
So you must respect yourself as He
respected Himself.

21:23.072 --> 21:29.139
And the way He worked out His resurrection.

21:29.340 --> 21:32.809
In the same way, you all have to work out
your resurrection,

21:33.010 --> 21:35.368
and that is very important.

21:35.733 --> 21:38.845
Today you have to just ask just one thing
from Me, that

21:39.046 --> 21:42.089
"Oh, Mother, today we ask you to give us

21:42.290 --> 21:49.628
that power of penance, of tapasya
of Christ."

21:49.829 --> 21:54.807
I wish this would be granted today and
you will become tapasvis.

21:55.008 --> 21:58.803
May God bless you all.

23:29.149 --> 23:32.796
Happy Christmas to you.
Yogis: Happy Christmas, Shri Mataji.

23:32.997 --> 23:35.344
Shri Mataji: Today you have sucked
My vibrations alright.

23:35.545 --> 23:37.491
May God bless you all.

24:24.290 --> 24:27.687
May God bless you all.
