1
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:10,220
Today in this beautiful place created by the queen of Austria,

2
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:16,230
we have gathered here

3
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:23,590
to perform the Puja to the Sahasrara.

4
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,690
When we enter into the realm of Sahasrara,

5
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,830
then only we have right to do the Sahasrara Puja.

6
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:43,110
Before this, nobody talked about Sahasrara

7
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,820
nobody did any Puja to Sahasrara.

8
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:54,650
This is your privilege that you are in the realm of Sahasrara

9
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,720
and that you can do this Puja performed.

10
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,870
It's your right.

11
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,890
You are chosen for this.

12
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,040
It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into

13
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,510
the Sahasrara of the Viraat,

14
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:22,060
to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrara.

15
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:33,920
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrara.

16
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,740
These are specially created cells

17
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,860
through the working of the Swadishthana.

18
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,260
Passing through all the chakras,

19
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,560
when they arrive at Sahasrara

20
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,990
they are equipped to handle the brain's activity

21
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:19,160
without getting involved into

22
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,900
other elements in the body.

23
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,330
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis

24
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:40,550
are not to be involved with the other cells -

25
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,760
human beings,

26
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,320
of the body of this universe.

27
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,220
The first thing that happens

28
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,430
to a Sahaja Yogi at the Sahasrara level that

29
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,490
he becomes beyond – ‘ateet’.

30
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,000
So, many things he transcends:

31
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,980
‘kalateet’- he goes beyond time.

32
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,420
Time is his slave.

33
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,540
If you have to go somewhere

34
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,850
then suddenly you discover

35
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:37,660
that everything is working about the same time

36
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,540
when you are able to do it.

37
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:50,380
Like you are, say, to catch a train

38
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,240
and you arrive late at the station,

39
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,190
you find the train is late for you.

40
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,170
Things work out in such a way that you feel

41
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:13,860
they are all active for your complete convenience.

42
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,570
So you go beyond time - ‘kalateet’.

43
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,740
Then you go beyond dharma - ‘dharmateet’.

44
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,770
Means, dharma becomes part and parcel of your being.

45
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,690
Nobody has to tell you, ‘you do this or you do that’;

46
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,560
you just don't do it.

47
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,770
Whatever you have to do it, you do it.

48
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,570
When you go beyond all these dharmas,

49
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,330
that are the human ‘dharmas’-

50
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:53,160
human dharma is that his attention gets attracted

51
00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:00,880
either with lust,
greed, at something,

52
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,680
and then he cannot pull out his attention.

53
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:17,310
But now the attention becomes ‘dharmateet’ -

54
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,230
means the attention loses its dharma.

55
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:31,440
The dharma of the attention are such that

56
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,110
we have to put

57
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,690
the ‘dharmas’ taught by the prophets to control them.

58
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,710
Because we are coming from the lowest level.

59
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:57,260
So these dharmas exist in our being and start showing,

60
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,350
and when they attack us,

61
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:07,950
then

62
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:13,770
we have to have some measures to control it.

63
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,940
So we build up our dharmas,

64
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,970
our rules and regulation,

65
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,420
and control them, the dharmas,

66
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,490
which have come to us from lower conditioning.

67
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,890
This is the greatness of human beings,

68
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:42,740
that they have made their own dharmas

69
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,910
established on top of the lower dharmas.

70
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,280
Like carbon has, say, four valences.

71
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,620
It has to be in four valences;

72
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,400
it acts according to the four valences,

73
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,650
it cannot make it six.

74
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,480
But human beings can make

75
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,950
those valences established which are supposed to be

76
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,920
representing the human dharma, the ‘manavdharma’.

77
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,270
But with the Sahasrara ascent the attention loses that quality,

78
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,390
means, you don't have need,

79
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,680
there’s no need,

80
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,320
to put dharmas - restrictions upon yourself.

81
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,650
You don't have to discipline,

82
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,180
but you get disciplined automatically.

83
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,830
That is the first sign of a person

84
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,420
who is belonging to Nirmal Religion. That is pure.

85
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,310
Attention doesn't get attached

86
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,930
or attacked by anything whatsoever, it is so pure.

87
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,730
Like the lotus leaf, the water doesn't stay on it.

88
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,640
So you become ‘kalateet’.

89
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,250
You become ‘dharmateet’.

90
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,530
You become ‘gunateet’.

91
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,460
Means, the three moods in which you are born,

92
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,980
left, right and center, you go beyond them.

93
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,290
The left one is the one by which you have emotional attachments

94
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,140
of your attention.

95
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:36,830
The second one is the physical and the mental attachments

96
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:42,010
and the third one, the attachment to the dharma.

97
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:51,090
Attachment to be righteous and making other righteous;

98
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,420
of disciplining others and disciplining yourself,

99
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,390
which is ‘satvika’.

100
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:04,610
Where a person tries to control

101
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:11,610
all his enemies of lust, anger,

102
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:18,800
pride, vanity, attachments

103
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,780
and greed.

104
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,640
All these restrictions

105
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,760
on the attention get lost

106
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:40,280
and you become a free person of complete wisdom.

107
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,810
Your attention itself becomes ‘dharmic’.

108
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:55,740
So, you lose all your ‘gunas’

109
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,400
and you become ‘satgunis’-

110
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,250
means virtuous,

111
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:11,070
but not by discipline,

112
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,760
but spontaneously.

113
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,330
You become righteous spontaneously.

114
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,920
Sometimes such people puzzle you;

115
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,400
like Christ took a hunter in His hand

116
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:34,080
and beat people who were selling things in the presence of God,

117
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,340
in the sense, in front of the temples.

118
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,480
According to laws, we should not have temper,

119
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:51,050
but this temper is a temper of a ‘gunateet’

120
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,470
and such a temper is a spontaneous happening,

121
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:02,030
which is not to be analyzed,

122
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,810
has to happen. The temper of the Devi on the rakshasas,

123
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,590
the killing of the rakshasas,

124
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,000
Krishna's samharas [MEANS killings],

125
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,170
Krishna telling Arjuna that you have to kill all these people,

126
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,160
they are all dead already.

127
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,250
They all get explained because you go beyond.

128
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,960
So is the 'ateet' beyond conditions arise.

129
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,990
Only the one who can control is beyond.

130
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,070
The one who is in it cannot control it.

131
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:48,620
If you have to pull out the ship you have to be on the shore.

132
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:55,480
The one who has gone beyond can only do that.

133
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,570
So you go beyond, that is ‘ateet’.

134
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:13,900
But, when it comes to the knowledge

135
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,960
about such a person, you cannot think,

136
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:26,560
because such a person is beyond thinking.

137
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,560
You cannot describe

138
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,440
because such a person cannot describe.

139
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,900
You cannot say, “Why Socrates agreed to

140
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,340
take the poison?

141
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,700
Why Christ agreed to get crucified?”

142
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:59,150
That's beyond human comprehension.

143
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,100
That's how you behave beyond human comprehension

144
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,170
and you are not to take certificates from human beings.

145
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,830
Your certificates come from God Almighty

146
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,390
and not from these human beings who are at a lower level.

147
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:23,410
It would be like a dog writing about human beings.

148
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,090
So you reach a state

149
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,200
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

150
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,510
means ‘without’,

151
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,880
without.

152
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:52,280
So such a person

153
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,870
is without thought; he doesn't think.

154
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,730
Such a person is without greed,

155
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:13,240
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

156
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:21,470
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

157
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:30,980
out of which nothing is left out.

158
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,210
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

159
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,150
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

160
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:43,950
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

161
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,880
because it reaches a point all the time

162
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,700
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

163
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,600
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

164
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,760
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

165
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:11,480
Vacuum of all the negative,

166
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:18,350
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

167
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:29,010
Such a person is eternal being.

168
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,810
Nobody can kill,

169
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:39,880
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

170
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,850
The anger

171
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,920
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

172
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,050
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

173
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:09,140
He is not elated by praises

174
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:15,190
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

175
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,470
the boons of the ego.

176
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:37,640
So the third state where he reaches,

177
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,540
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nihi’ –

178
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,630
Nihi.

179
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,750
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

180
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:59,680
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

181
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,570
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

182
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,180
But the word is 'Nihi'.

183
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,930
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

184
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,050
‘nih’ -

185
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:22,370
that means

186
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,230
‘sheer’.

187
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:36,940
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

188
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:46,640
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

189
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:54,080
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

190
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:07,280
Like when you say

191
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:15,320
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

192
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,930
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

193
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:23,420
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

194
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,250
But this word is used,

195
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,590
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

196
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:42,560
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

197
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,720
without or devoid of.

198
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:54,430
The another form is:

199
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,080
the only - absolute;

200
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,910
the absolute.

201
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:10,740
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

202
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,610
nothing but joy.

203
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,790
It's complete freedom.

204
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,120
So you have all kinds of joys,

205
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,550
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

206
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,570
the joy of the Spirit.

207
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:39,740
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

208
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,980
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

209
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:48,950
where you have the joy of the play.

210
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,180
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

211
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,050
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

212
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,280
means, sheer absolute joy.

213
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,700
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

214
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,180
it means absolute.

215
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,360
So when you put such an adjective before

216
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,250
anything else it becomes absolute.

217
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,350
Thus you become absolute.

218
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:43,270
And when you are at that state of absolute

219
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:49,680
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

220
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,350
But let us see what is absolute.

221
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,860
That means it is not relative;

222
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,410
it has no relative qualities.

223
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,760
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

224
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,680
it cannot be compared.

225
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,530
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

226
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,160
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

227
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,890
anything else through which we can comprehend;

228
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,770
it is absolute.

229
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:50,010
Whatever way you try to know it

230
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:54,420
you go away from absolute.

231
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:05,330
Wherever you try to analyze the absolute you are away from it.

232
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:21,060
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

233
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,620
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

234
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,960
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

235
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,610
means the anand of the body,

236
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:44,310
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

237
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,140
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

238
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,730
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

239
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,080
But the state has now

240
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,270
to be established within us is of Niranand.

241
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:11,000
Then what is the question of fear?

242
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,690
What is the question of talking about it?

243
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:21,770
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

244
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,460
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

245
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,190
There are no words for absolute to describe.

246
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,010
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

247
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,580
what remains is absolute.

248
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,360
So you reach the state of absolute.

249
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,900
And that is the state

250
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:56,050
a complete communication is established

251
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,990
and in that communication you have nobody else

252
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:04,460
but the absolute within you.

253
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,280
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

254
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:20,650
That is the level to which you should aspire.

255
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,430
That should be the ascent,

256
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,160
which should be established within ourselves.

257
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,710
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

258
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:39,330
we don't have to do anything drastic.

259
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:44,990
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

260
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,120
the only, ‘kevalam’.

261
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,210
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

262
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:08,370
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

263
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:14,560
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

264
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,900
Just by surrendering you become.

265
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,400
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

266
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,770
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

267
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,460
It is absolute love,

268
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,160
it is absolute compassion;

269
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,190
it is absolute power.

270
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,610
The words stop,

271
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:05,190
the description stops;

272
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,180
you just become the absolute

273
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:17,220
and feel your absoluteness through it

274
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,810
with that oneness.

275
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,720
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

276
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,490
There’s no company needed.

277
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:38,890
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

278
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:51,360
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

279
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:57,900
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

280
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,600
May God bless you.
