00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.150
It was really very enjoyable today, to see
all of you, in such a happy mood. What happiness

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.340
what joy Sahaja Yoga has brought to all of
you. It’s really, I could never have imagined,

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.369
that people could be that joyous and, that
relaxed, as you were this evening. Also it

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.450
shows, how much you have understood, the stupidity
of this hypocrisy going on in the Name of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.390
God. Not only that, that you have understood,
but, the way you have depicted it, showed

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:10.130
also your great, art of acting, art of bringing
out the salient points of all this hypocrisy.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.220
There are many people who can see this point,
not that only we see, many people must be

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.870
knowing about it also, but you have the power
now, to, accept it, understand it, and realize

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.060
it, as the truth, that they are really hypocrites.
We have human beings, who of course, do not

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.299
want to accept, do not want to see. They have
closed their eyes, blind faith in all those

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.299
hypocritical people, somehow or other, they
lack reasoning, understanding, logic. But

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.930
there are some who understand, who have this,
full image of these people in different countries,

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.290
in different, religions and all these guru
people. They understand it. But still, they

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:44.269
cannot, go against it, they dare not say anything
against it, and even if they say, it will

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.989
be in a very, hush-hush manner, not so openly
as we did it today. Though it was very hilarious,

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:10.139
and very enjoyable, but behind all this comedy
I felt the tragedy, because, there are so

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:22.889
many, who are suffering, who are being looted,
who are being cheated, who are being used,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.840
morally who have been crushed.
And I don’t know how many, cruel things

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:56.469
are going behind the scene in the Name of
God. Such a tragedy that, is still going on

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:07.589
in these modern times. But you are all very
lucky and fortunate people, that you have

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:14.819
dropped all this nonsense, all the shackles
of blind faith and now, you are all enjoying

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.570
the freedom of your Spirit. It’s something
I enjoyed the most. You have to understand,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.500
that we are now in the Kingdom of God, so
we can see the reality, very clearly, and

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.520
in the Kingdom of the God we are looked after,
all the time by the Divine Power. How it works

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:57.199
out, how it looks after us, is extremely remarkable.
As you saw one drama, the one after all these

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.120
actors coming on the stage, we actually, saw
ourselves a drama in India, without organizing,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.360
very spontaneous, just like it was today,
but without any organization, a beautiful

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:32.099
drama we saw which I must tell you, so that
you will understand how much this Divine Power

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:39.539
is working it out.
You remember we had a very bad time in Angapur

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:47.189
when these people threw stones and so many
were hurt, if you remember that night, and

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:54.569
we were in trouble. And we had filed a case,
but the case was not somehow or other started,

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:04.270
and it was the date, something, where I could
not be there, but still the case was there

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:12.439
and we didn’t know what was happening. There
was one man who had come when we were having

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:19.439
this program. His name was Anant Beransbe
and he told Me that he’s from the television

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.000
and he wants to have his Realization. So I
said: ‘I cannot just now I have to speak,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
so you can go on the back side and sit down
and we’ll see if we can manage your Realization.’

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.860
When these people, you heard the story, that
it was they who had arranged this man from

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:48.599
television to come, those who had been throwing
stones at us, these [SOUNDS LIKE: andar sadar

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.800
molan] people. And we didn’t know what to
do, so, a son-in-law of our Home Minister,

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:09.199
came to My house in Pradisthan and asked for
Realization. I was quite surprised this man

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:17.599
coming down for Realization. And then I told
him what is happening to us. He said: ‘No

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:23.259
no you can go and see this Home Minister.
‘ Now this Home Minister is a great disciple

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:30.099
of our asatya Baba, imagine. I said: ‘It’s
really; I don’t know how it will work out

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:37.099
this stupid fellow, this disciple of asatya
Sai Baba.

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:44.379
So just see the drama. He was quite hesitant,
and with Me Rajesh Shah, Yogi Mahajan and

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:56.020
one Nirvika who is from the same area as this
Minister who had arranged this meeting. So

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:05.340
we went there. So the private secretary had
a great respect for Me, so he called the car

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.110
inside, we couldn’t understand. Then he
came and touched My Feet. I was quite surprised.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:18.110
Then I went and sat with this Home Minister,
and his wife came in and she touched My Feet.

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:25.330
I was quite surprised, and she said: ‘You
don’t remember me?’ I said: ‘I think

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.979
I’ve seen you somewhere.’ She said: ‘You’ve
forgotten we had gone together to London.’

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:35.979
There was a, offer from Air India for people
who have been doing social work, as a sort

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:44.770
of a reward that we could go to England and
come back. So there were quite a lot of ladies

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:51.770
who went and the Chief Minister’s wife also
came and she was, actually he’s Chief Minister

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.370
at that time and she’s his wife. They were
very well known to My family. Actually their

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:05.370
marriage was arranged by My father also.
So they were, all sort of, they were new this

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:14.210
western culture, very old-fashioned ladies,
all old ladies you see, traveling with Me

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:19.430
to London. There you see they were so shocked
at the dance they saw and everything, they

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:23.810
said: ‘What are these dirty people doing
here? Why are they showing us these dirty

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:28.220
things, and we are not dirty women.’ And
like that you see they were. I had to tell

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.250
them all right: ‘They have this kind of
dances only. If you don’t want to see we

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:37.030
can go out.’ Went out and all of them started
vomiting there. So it was such a bad condition

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.410
with them. So they stuck on to Me in London,
all of them, and one of them was the wife

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:48.410
of this gentleman, and she said: ‘That if
You remember we all stuck on to You.’

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.070
They were all older than Me, because they
couldn’t understand what’s happening in

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:59.480
these countries because they had never seen
such dances, such women, such men. She said:

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:05.920
‘But why are these Air India people troubling
us like this? Why do they want to shock us?’

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.290
I said: ‘It’s all right. That is their
entertainment style doesn’t matter and all.’

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:15.070
But inside I was laughing: ‘I said from
where these old-fashioned women have come

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:20.980
here and they can’t stand all this nonsense.
But this lady said that: ‘See how You supported

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.580
us, how You helped us, otherwise we are all
collapsing you see there.’

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.950
So this lady was very sweet and then she started
telling her husband: ‘You know She was quite

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:35.220
young but She was very wise and She looked
after us, and She did this and She was the

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:40.320
youngest and all.’ Then suddenly one girl,
now one by one on the stage, first of all

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.660
the wife came in, then they announced: ‘There’s
a lady called Nirmala Deshbande who wants

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:52.290
to meet her. So they said: ‘No no just now
I’m talking to Shri Mataji. I’ll see her

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.470
later.’ ‘No,’ I said: ‘You call her,
she knows Me very well.’ So this Nirmala

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:01.940
Deshbande was with Me in 1942 Movement – imagine
the drama. She should come that day only,

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:08.940
in the morning time.
Actually the whole, I mean our, interview

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.480
was fixed for the previous evening but it
was postponed for next morning and next morning

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:22.040
one by one how these people are coming on
the stage. First his wife, and we are already

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:29.040
given a nice ulta bandhan, the other way round,
to this two photographs of Mr Narakasura,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:36.410
lest he starts pouring some pribhooties from
his photographs.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:42.790
Then this lady this Nirmala Deshbande she
came. As soon as she saw Me she just fell

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:48.530
at My Feet, she started hugging Me. She said:
‘How long we have… are meeting now this

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:53.130
that.’ She even forgot the Home Minister
was sitting there, nothing of the kind, and

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:58.140
they all started looking at her. ‘Oh you
don’t know her? She was our Leader, you

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.240
see She was like a real Shakti how She faced
the Britishers you have no idea. You people

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.730
have become Ministers but this is the Lady
who fought for the freedom.’ And all she

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:14.730
gave a big lecture to the Home Minister and
Home Minister – like this.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:29.260
But this is not the end. Then, she wouldn’t
talk to him. She was just talking to Me and

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.770
she said: ‘Oh You have been doing great
work. I have heard about You. I’ve been

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.220
longing to meet You, but just imagine, today
I’ve come and You are here after such a

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.880
long time. Oh you don’t know what a loving
Lady She is. She was so sweet to us. She was

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.380
much younger to me in age and we were so many
girls you see, boys, all of them She organized

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:56.890
and She was so young and still She was so
brave.’ And she was describing everything.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.690
I was quite embarrassed. So the Minister didn’t
know why she had come there, then.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:07.790
Then I said: ‘All right now I’m going.
I told him the whole story, gave him all the

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.280
papers and he couldn’t help it, he had to
sign all right: ‘Please do something about

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:18.880
it or something’. He wrote to the main man
in Maharashtra. I told him about all these

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.110
and how Rajneesh has planned this, and all
this was done by Rajneesh people, because

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:30.110
we have proof of that. Then we came out. We
came out and there was one lady who again

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:37.150
touched My Feet, in the verandah. I couldn’t
recognize her very well. She said: ‘Have

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:44.150
You forgotten? I’m the Maharani of Satara’,
where this incident had taken – you know

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:51.180
Angapur is close to Satara. ‘Ah I remember.’
‘You came in 1972. We had a nice meeting

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:58.200
in our palace and my mother-in-law the Rajmata
invited You, she washed Your Feet.’ I said:

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.240
‘Yes yes I remember.’ ‘But You forgot
us. You never met us after that. Now You have

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.620
to come to the wedding of my son. I’ve come
to invite the Home Minister. You have to come

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.150
to the wedding of my son.’ I said: ‘I’m
going away tomorrow to Rome.’ She said:

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:20.150
‘No no no I’ll take You. I’ll do this.
So all right, at least You must ask this Home

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:27.130
Minister to come. He’ll listen to You, I’m
sure he’ll listen to You.’ I just kept

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:31.550
quiet.
So, then you see there was a gentleman standing

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:38.550
with her. So she went inside. He said: ‘Shri
Mataji,’ he touched My Feet, ‘I’ve met

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:44.540
You before, and You have given me Realization.’
I said: ‘What’s your name?’ He said:

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:51.540
‘My name is Anant Beransbe.’ I said: ‘What?’
‘I met You in Angapur. I’m Anant Beransbe.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:58.530
I was there. You remember?’ I said: ‘Yes
of course. Why did you come to Angapur?’

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:03.300
He said: ‘Only a Sahaja Yoga brought me
there.’ ‘But you were not brought by the

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.200
[Sounds Like: andar sadar]?’ He said: ‘No
never, why would I come with these horrible

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.410
people?’ ‘So what happened?’
He said: ‘Only four days back I was in Satara

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:18.410
and the case started and they had taken me
there. So I told them that, I saw seven people

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:23.500
being hit by these [SOUNDS LIKE: andar sadar]
people. And they were all bleeding. And I

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:30.500
was so upset with it that I couldn’t bear
it. I ran away from there. But one thing I

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:37.040
must say: ‘Mataji was telling everybody:
‘Keep quiet, doesn’t matter, doesn’t

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.680
matter. Some stones are coming. Just keep
quiet. Don’t throw any stones. Don’t do

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.310
anything.’ He told there in the Court. Can
you imagine this fellow, in our absence? And

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:51.640
after one year I met him and then they started
saying: ‘Oh Mataji must have given him laques

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:56.910
of rupees that’s why he’s talking like
this.’ They thought he was their witness,

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:03.910
just imagine. I said: ‘Really?’ Immediately
I told that private secretary: ‘Bring our

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:12.530
petition.’ And we cut out all that was written
against this Anant Beransbe, otherwise he

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:18.120
would have been in trouble. Imagine. And then
said: ‘Really?’

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.500
Then this lady came out she said: ‘Why don’t
You come in and tell the Home Minister to

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.190
come to attend my son’s wedding? At least
he should do Mother.’ So I went with her

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:31.940
and this fellow also came Anant Beransbe and
I said: ‘This is that same fellow Anant

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.500
Beransbe, but he’s telling something else.
And then he started telling them, how they

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.590
hit and how they were this thing. He said
this Dr [SOUNDS LIKE: Tabuker?] he’s a devil.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:48.240
And all we had written against him in that,
imagine. Can you imagine such a story? This

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:55.240
fellow, this Anant Beransbe, who was mentioned
in that petition of ours, should be there

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.840
on that morning there standing, waiting for
Me. Then he asked him two-three questions,

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.150
the Home Minister: ‘What are they doing?’
‘Nothing. They were hitting one after another

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.939
seven people I saw and I got such a fright
I ran away with my camera, couldn’t bear

00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:16.430
it and Mataji was telling them: ‘Don’t
hit, don’t hit’. She was so quiet.’

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:22.130
So, the Home Minister was quite surprised
at this.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:27.890
So went we came out, despite that he was a
disciple of asatya Sai Baba and all that,

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:33.970
how things worked out that first his wife
should know Me, then Nirmala Deshbande comes

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:40.110
in, then this Maharani comes in, and then
after that, and the Maharani herself praising

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:47.110
Me a lot, that I cured her mother-in-law and
all. And then comes in Mr, this Anant Beransbe,

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:52.720
and he told them the whole story, and this
Home Minister didn’t know where to look.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:59.550
Asatya Sai Baba and whole thing was finished
into nowhere. So see how the drama worked,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:05.910
and we were so amazed at the whole thing.
When we came out Rajesh said: ‘Mother it

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:12.910
was Mahasahaja Yoga.’
So in Sahaja Yoga everything works out. You

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:31.870
must know that it all works out. But you must
also know that you must have faith in paramachaitanya.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:39.770
Also faith in yourself that you are in the
Kingdom of God. I was very happy today the

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:46.770
way you enjoyed all that and understood it
but, one thing is there, that you all should,

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:57.040
not that only enjoy this but feel it, as a
responsibility. We have to, point it out to

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:06.210
the whole world, how hypocritical they are,
how they are using the name of God, and how

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:13.710
they are ruining people, by their, tricks.
So today I don’t want to tell you lots of

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:27.630
things. Today is a day still the Christ has
not Risen as they say but I don’t know at

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:35.960
this time, He must have come out of His grave
already, as it is because, He came out and

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:46.550
He was standing outside when His Mother came
and asked Him: ‘Who are You?’ She couldn’t

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:55.060
even Recognize Him. She couldn’t even believe
that Christ has Risen. In the same way we

00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:01.220
also forget that we have Risen and that we
are completely transformed, and we are free,

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:08.220
absolutely free people. Nothing can dominate
us, none of our conditionings, none of our

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:19.390
ego, nothing can dominate us, none of our
habits. Everything has died out and we are

00:20:20.059 --> 00:20:27.059
free birds to fly and to enjoy our flights.
This is what we have to realize. May God bless

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:36.640
you.
I’ve been telling you that you shouldn’t

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:43.059
give Me any prizes, nothing. It’s too much.
It is too much of presentations. I mean I

00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:48.760
don’t know why you are giving Me all these
things all the time, but you think that, that’s

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:55.760
only your privilege that so you have to do
it. So I have to have certain privileges,

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:02.970
I can also give you presents. So I have bought
some very small ones for all of you, those

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:09.970
who are here in Rome. For Cabella people I
bought last time, but I’ll also do it when

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:16.270
they come there. And for other countries also
I’ll be giving them whenever I go there

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:23.270
but just now it is for the people of Rome
and the leaders. Leaders, I’m also afraid

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:29.010
of them, because sometimes you see, if they
get angry they can form a union against Me

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:36.010
you know. So One has to be careful with them.
So there’s little presents for all of them

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:42.470
and I hope they’ll accept it and so…
