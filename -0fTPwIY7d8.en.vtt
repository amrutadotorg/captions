WEBVTT

04:54.680 --> 05:00.000
So now we are coming to the end

05:00.200 --> 05:05.120
of our first half tour.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.240
Now we have to look back upon ourselves

05:11.440 --> 05:16.880
and try to find out what have we achieved out of this.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.720
We must understand that Sahaja Yoga

05:19.920 --> 05:24.240
is not done through brain activities.

05:25.040 --> 05:31.040
Like many people think that if you just

05:31.240 --> 05:35.920
tell yourself, "You have to be like this", it will work out.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.520
If you have to all the time inform yourself that,

05:38.720 --> 05:42.720
"Oh, you must get rid of a particular problem", you'll be all right.

05:42.920 --> 05:46.960
Or some people think that if they tell somebody,

05:47.160 --> 05:50.200
that "This is wrong with you and you should get well",

05:50.400 --> 05:54.160
it will be all right. It is not so.

05:54.360 --> 05:58.240
Because Sahaja Yoga does not work on mental level.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.920
It works on spiritual level which is a much higher level

06:02.120 --> 06:03.640
than the mental level.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.960
So what you have to do

06:06.160 --> 06:10.160
is to understand how to correct your chakras.

06:10.360 --> 06:15.880
And you must understand how to work out your machines.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.560
Perhaps people still live

06:18.760 --> 06:23.360
on mental level and try to solve problems on mental level.

06:23.560 --> 06:27.240
And that's why all the problems start coming out.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.520
Now, if you have a problem with any chakras

06:30.720 --> 06:32.160
or there is anything catching

06:32.360 --> 06:35.240
or you find that there's something wrong with you,

06:35.440 --> 06:41.440
no use working it out on any other level but spiritual level.

06:42.360 --> 06:48.360
Some people believe that if they have dressed up like something

06:50.360 --> 06:55.720
or if they outwardly behave like something, they become that.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.520
That is not true.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.640
Like we have hippies in the West

07:00.840 --> 07:03.040
and they think that they have become primitive.

07:03.240 --> 07:07.280
You do not become primitive by believing it.

07:07.480 --> 07:11.840
Because you are so overdeveloped, that you cannot become primitive.

07:12.080 --> 07:18.800
So by just doing something mentally we do not become.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.120
Now, this mental level

07:23.320 --> 07:27.200
can go even further in a subtler way into people.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.360
Some of you might feel that by

07:30.560 --> 07:36.560
knowing some of the aartis and things by heart

07:37.400 --> 07:40.040
you will achieve great depth, it is not true, also.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.320
Because that is also just words.

07:42.520 --> 07:46.160
But, if that is an awakened thing within you,

07:46.360 --> 07:48.360
then they become a mantra.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.600
And then you can work it out.

07:50.800 --> 07:56.440
But first of all you must achieve a certain standard

07:56.640 --> 08:00.600
to have that power to create the mantras.

08:00.800 --> 08:05.600
Also, when you say some aarti, it's not necessarily

08:05.800 --> 08:08.680
possible that it will work out.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.320
Let us face the things as they are

08:11.520 --> 08:15.200
and not to be conditioned by anything else.

08:15.400 --> 08:20.880
You have to achieve a certain depth within yourself

08:21.080 --> 08:27.040
to even enlighten the mantras.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.080
First of all you should have clear-cut vibrations,

08:31.280 --> 08:32.880
minimum of minimum.

08:33.080 --> 08:37.080
If you have certain chakras catching, then

08:37.280 --> 08:41.800
try to improve your chakras with the photograph.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.240
With all due respect to the photograph. It's only the photograph

08:45.440 --> 08:48.720
which is going to work it out. Nothing else.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.640
Or if I am there.

08:50.840 --> 08:55.400
But once you have achieved a certain state of enlightenment,

08:55.600 --> 09:02.000
then you can use mantras otherwise also, it will help you.

09:02.800 --> 09:07.160
But first of all your heart must be clear.

09:07.360 --> 09:12.920
I've found out, in general, there are two chakras

09:13.120 --> 09:16.120
overwhelmingly

09:17.320 --> 09:21.720
not working all right in most of the western people.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.440
First is the heart.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.360
That means heart is not clear,

09:27.560 --> 09:29.360
that heart is not clean,

09:29.560 --> 09:35.400
that in the heart you still are a small person,

09:35.600 --> 09:39.480
in the heart you have not placed your Mother.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.440
You have to purify your heart

09:43.640 --> 09:49.640
by looking at the photograph and putting all loving feelings

09:50.520 --> 09:54.600
about your Mother, understanding Her work

09:54.800 --> 09:58.440
and putting Her into your heart.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.920
If the heart is not clear,

10:01.120 --> 10:04.480
then everything has no meaning because it is a "dark heart"

10:04.680 --> 10:07.680
which is doing all these things.

10:08.080 --> 10:12.480
The heart has to be clean, absolutely surrendered

10:12.680 --> 10:18.200
and must try to put Me before everything else.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.320
I can tell you because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

10:20.520 --> 10:24.160
I cannot say this to people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

10:25.880 --> 10:30.120
Now, we always try to relate

10:30.880 --> 10:34.680
Sahaja Yoga from our own terms,

10:34.880 --> 10:39.000
not from the terms that belong to God.

10:39.200 --> 10:44.280
God is what He is, He cannot change Himself. You have to change.

10:44.480 --> 10:49.480
So whatever we think about God we want to put on that.

10:49.680 --> 10:55.720
For example, if someone

10:56.320 --> 11:00.920
thinks that he tries to be nice or good to Me,

11:01.120 --> 11:04.720
or if he is close to Me, so-called,

11:04.920 --> 11:08.560
and if he thinks he is organizing better

11:08.760 --> 11:11.640
or he's doing this work or that work

11:11.840 --> 11:14.560
or anything else like that, where he feels

11:14.760 --> 11:19.400
that he's important because he is doing this job or that job,

11:19.600 --> 11:22.920
then one must know

11:23.120 --> 11:26.680
that all this is mental.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.080
Actually, you are doing nothing.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.920
Whenever you try to do something,

11:32.120 --> 11:34.920
you really confuse yourself and confuse Me also.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.200
You have seen yesterday's example.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.520
I was sure that they had to go next day.

11:40.720 --> 11:44.280
But nobody would listen to Me, and they rushed away

11:44.480 --> 11:48.680
and they found that the tickets were for the next day.

11:49.480 --> 11:54.440
This knowledge comes to you if you are clear-hearted.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.880
As yesterday I said, "You better not come".

11:58.080 --> 11:59.720
I didn't know what was the situation there -

11:59.920 --> 12:01.640
I just said, "Don't come" â€” finished.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.760
Because I knew what was going to happen there.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.600
So this clear-cut idea comes to you when your heart is clean.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.920
But first of all, people do not understand that you have to work it

12:13.120 --> 12:15.560
through your heart and not through your brain.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.320
When we have to work out things through our brain,

12:18.520 --> 12:21.320
we try to develop our brain, isn't it?

12:21.520 --> 12:25.200
By memorizing, by practising something,

12:25.400 --> 12:29.320
teaching our brain how to think, how to go this way that way.

12:29.520 --> 12:31.320
We try to train our brain.

12:31.520 --> 12:35.440
Now, we have to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga.

12:35.640 --> 12:39.360
And to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga

12:39.560 --> 12:41.400
one has to know, first of all,

12:41.600 --> 12:47.600
that it is enveloped either by ego or by superego.

12:47.800 --> 12:52.320
The limbic area actually represents the heart.

12:52.960 --> 12:58.960
And if there is ego, heart will always be so-called,

12:59.160 --> 13:01.800
it will not be the real heart that will be working,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.760
but it's only mental, mental projection.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.480
And you will feel that I'm doing it from my heart.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.080
but it's not true.

13:10.280 --> 13:14.840
Now then, supposing, what should we do if we have ego?

13:15.040 --> 13:16.840
You might say you should try to

13:17.040 --> 13:20.520
sort of tell yourself that that's not good and

13:20.720 --> 13:24.440
this and that and all kinds of mental suggestions

13:24.640 --> 13:26.280
or autosuggestions or this -

13:26.480 --> 13:30.640
the way psychiatrists know that give you suggestions.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.440
That's again mental.

13:33.640 --> 13:37.160
So that's not the way it is going to work out.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.800
We must understand that for that what we have to do is to

13:41.000 --> 13:43.360
raise the left side and put it to the right side.

13:43.560 --> 13:44.960
There's no other way out.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.240
You have to just work it out with your hands,

13:47.440 --> 13:51.000
your hands are working it out and not your brain.

13:51.200 --> 13:55.560
So use your hands and the methods of Sahaja Yoga.

13:55.760 --> 14:01.000
Now, everyone must have

14:01.200 --> 14:05.840
a regular sitting in the water every day, that's important.

14:06.040 --> 14:09.440
Every morning you must do your meditation.

14:09.640 --> 14:15.120
Because on mental level we feel we have been with Mother, all right,

14:15.320 --> 14:17.440
this exposure is all right.

14:17.640 --> 14:21.400
You came you saw how Indians are and how they are light

14:21.600 --> 14:27.960
on their feet and how they are good for Sahaja Yoga.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.800
But after seeing all that

14:32.000 --> 14:35.880
you have to know that Sahaja Yoga is to be worked out,

14:36.080 --> 14:39.080
it 's not to be thought out.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.440
You just cannot think about it.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.280
Whatever you may try to do through your thought,

14:45.480 --> 14:47.480
you cannot achieve any results in Sahaja Yoga.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.400
You have to use your hands, you have to use your feet,

14:50.600 --> 14:54.720
you have to soak your feet in the water because water is the ocean.

14:54.920 --> 14:58.160
All these five chakras -

14:58.360 --> 15:00.440
or, say, six chakras

15:00.640 --> 15:07.280
which are â€” I say five because theâ€¦ one is the Mooladhara Chakra,

15:07.560 --> 15:13.400
which is the seventh, and the topmost is the brain.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.400
So in between five chakras which are there â€”

15:17.600 --> 15:19.880
are to be handled fully

15:20.080 --> 15:26.600
with the idea that they are basically made of matter.

15:28.640 --> 15:33.480
And these five elements constitute

15:33.840 --> 15:37.480
the body of these chakras.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.120
Now, these chakras,

15:40.320 --> 15:45.080
if they are to be corrected, we have to correct them by taking out

15:45.280 --> 15:49.400
all the problems of these chakras into the elements

15:49.600 --> 15:52.600
from which they're coming.

15:52.920 --> 15:58.920
For example, a person who is a very right-sided person.

15:59.120 --> 16:03.440
So he has to give a balance by the left-side.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.120
Of course, raising with the hand is all right,

16:06.320 --> 16:08.920
but what about the element?

16:09.120 --> 16:14.080
Right-sided person has all the elements which give heat:

16:14.280 --> 16:18.920
we can say, the light, we can say, the fire.

16:19.120 --> 16:22.480
So for people who are right-sided

16:22.680 --> 16:26.400
the light is not going to help much.

16:27.360 --> 16:30.320
Like if you put the light before the photograph,

16:30.520 --> 16:32.440
and those who are ego-oriented people â€”

16:32.640 --> 16:36.040
if you just use the light, it's not going to work out.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.800
So what is going to work out is the Mother Earth

16:40.000 --> 16:45.960
and the water element, which is cooling.

16:46.360 --> 16:52.360
Even ice is very helpful to people who are right-sided.

16:54.160 --> 17:00.320
So all cooling effects should be used for correcting

17:00.520 --> 17:05.240
your right-sidedness,

17:05.520 --> 17:07.400
so that you cool it down.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.760
Same about food.

17:09.960 --> 17:15.320
In food, those who are right-sided people should take to

17:15.520 --> 17:18.280
foods which are left-sided, that is carbohydrates â€”

17:18.480 --> 17:21.280
means they should become partly vegetarians,

17:21.480 --> 17:24.800
or quite a lot vegetarian â€”

17:25.000 --> 17:29.720
and should eat things at the most like chicken,

17:29.920 --> 17:35.120
but not fishes, not seafoods because they are all hot.

17:35.320 --> 17:41.080
That's how you treat your material side of your chakras.

17:41.280 --> 17:45.320
Now, the left-sided people should use, again,

17:45.520 --> 17:48.640
the deepam â€” is the light â€” or the fire

17:48.840 --> 17:53.440
to correct their left side.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.280
Also in food

17:55.480 --> 18:00.120
such people should take more to nitrogenous, means protein

18:00.320 --> 18:05.160
and foods like that. They should take more proteins.

18:06.080 --> 18:11.480
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

18:11.680 --> 18:14.720
the basic thing is Kundalini.

18:14.920 --> 18:21.080
And the Kundalini, as I have told you, is the pure desire.

18:21.280 --> 18:25.760
Again, listen to it carefully: pure desire.

18:25.960 --> 18:29.240
That means all other desires are impure.

18:29.440 --> 18:34.600
There's only one pure desire. And that is to be one with the Divine.

18:34.800 --> 18:40.680
One with the Brahma, one with God â€” that's the only pure desire.

18:40.880 --> 18:44.160
All other desires are impure.

18:44.600 --> 18:49.280
So train your mind gradually

18:49.480 --> 18:53.600
to achieve that desire as the main thing.

18:54.480 --> 18:58.120
If you train your mind in that fashion,

18:58.320 --> 19:01.280
then you can develop pure desire,

19:01.480 --> 19:06.960
so all other desires will negate, gradually.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.360
All right.

19:08.560 --> 19:14.560
Now, this desire to be one with the Divine

19:15.600 --> 19:19.000
is the purest and the highest.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.200
And to achieve that

19:22.680 --> 19:25.680
what have you to do?

19:27.040 --> 19:31.440
To achieve that you have to keep your Mother pleased.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.480
Very simple.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.800
Adi Shankaracharya has said that you don't bother about it,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.240
just keep your Mother pleased.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.440
You have to be a simple person,

19:42.640 --> 19:45.280
not try to be cunning with Me or clever with Me,

19:45.480 --> 19:47.720
I know everyone very well.

19:47.920 --> 19:52.080
Try to tell yourself that "I should say things,

19:52.280 --> 19:56.720
I should behave in a manner that will please my Mother."

19:56.920 --> 20:00.560
Supposing you are in Sahaja Yoga and you are doing wrong things.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.840
It is not going to please Me at all.

20:04.720 --> 20:09.200
So how to please Mother â€” that you should try to see for yourself,

20:09.400 --> 20:14.440
what kind of a thing pleases Me the best.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.600
I am also a very simple person.

20:16.800 --> 20:21.200
So I want a simple-hearted person who is simple about it.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.560
For example, a person who tries to show off too much,

20:24.760 --> 20:26.920
try to be always the first

20:27.120 --> 20:32.000
or try to be always theâ€¦ sort of a

20:32.360 --> 20:36.320
cinema star â€” I don't like such people.

20:36.520 --> 20:40.360
You have to be very quiet

20:40.560 --> 20:43.960
and extremely

20:45.760 --> 20:51.560
shy about showing off yourself.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.320
Do I show off that I am Adi Shakti?

20:55.520 --> 20:56.840
I do not.

20:57.040 --> 21:01.800
I live like you, absolutely like you, do I try to show off?

21:02.000 --> 21:05.160
Then why should you try to show off to Me?

21:05.360 --> 21:09.440
So that kind of a person is no good.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.960
Secondly, you should not be tense with Me,

21:13.160 --> 21:15.240
there is no need to be tense.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.160
If I find something wrong with you,

21:18.360 --> 21:19.920
if I scold you also â€” it's for your good.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.000
If I say a good word â€” it is for your good.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.600
My Sahaja Yoga works this way.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.440
I have no malice against

21:27.640 --> 21:30.520
anyone in the whole world, no malice at all,

21:30.720 --> 21:33.120
and no anger for anyone in this world.

21:33.320 --> 21:37.240
I have nothing but compassion, but in compassion sometimes

21:37.440 --> 21:41.400
I have to scold and in the same compassion I have to speak

21:41.600 --> 21:44.320
in a very compassionate manner.

21:44.520 --> 21:48.360
So both ways it helps you,

21:48.560 --> 21:50.400
it helps you both ways.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.120
So thank God

21:53.320 --> 21:57.160
that you have somebody who will correct you at the right time,

21:57.360 --> 22:00.560
for your good, because you are saints.

22:00.760 --> 22:05.840
And you have come on this Earth to establish God's Kingdom.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.520
That's what you have to do.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.680
And if you are the people

22:09.880 --> 22:13.640
who are not respected, who are not sensible,

22:13.840 --> 22:18.120
who haven't got the dignity, who behave in a cheapish way,

22:18.320 --> 22:21.320
how can people accept you.

22:22.720 --> 22:27.080
So this Heart Chakra is to be first looked after.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.920
That with your heart â€”

22:29.120 --> 22:32.520
desire that you'll keep your Mother pleased.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.480
Even if I'm angry with you, don't feel bad about it.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.440
That's one of the signs that Sahaja Yoga has not yet developed.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.800
If I scold you, it is because there's something in you

22:41.000 --> 22:43.440
which has to go away and which I must scold so it will go away.

22:43.720 --> 22:49.280
So accept it just as a correcting point that is good for you,

22:49.480 --> 22:51.920
some sort of a thorn is within you

22:52.120 --> 22:54.040
which has to be taken out by another thorn,

22:54.240 --> 22:57.160
and Mother has taken it out.

22:57.360 --> 23:00.360
Once you start understanding the compassion of your Mother,

23:00.560 --> 23:02.240
you will not mind.

23:02.440 --> 23:05.880
My saying anything to you, My correcting you

23:06.080 --> 23:10.040
or My telling you that this is wrong.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.120
Because I have to do that.

23:13.320 --> 23:17.520
Now, those people who do not have a good heart, clean heart,

23:17.720 --> 23:20.760
cannot understand this.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.560
They cannot understand this. Very difficult.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.800
So you keep your heart clean towards your Mother.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.200
Whatever I do for you is just a blessing, always a blessing for you.

23:32.400 --> 23:36.760
Whatever I do for you is a blessing, remember that.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.120
Now, another chakra which is

23:39.320 --> 23:42.920
horribly caught up with most of you is your Nabhi Chakra,

23:43.120 --> 23:47.800
suggesting that you are still very very materialistic.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.880
In small small things also we are materialistic,

23:52.080 --> 23:55.800
it becomes subtler and subtler and subtlerâ€¦

23:57.880 --> 24:02.240
So try to understand that matter is not so important.

24:02.440 --> 24:06.440
Matter is just there to please each other.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.360
Specially to please your Mother.

24:09.560 --> 24:12.720
It has no other value whatsoever.

24:12.920 --> 24:17.320
So you should not try to be materialistic, in the sense that,

24:17.520 --> 24:20.160
you see, for a little thing you have to do this,

24:20.360 --> 24:22.240
for a little thing you have to do that.

24:22.440 --> 24:25.520
Nothing is important. If it works out â€” well and good,

24:25.720 --> 24:28.200
and if it doesn't work out â€” well and good.

24:28.400 --> 24:32.120
So, you see, Nabhi Chakra is very individualistic,

24:32.320 --> 24:36.520
very individualistic. It is everybody's personal thing.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.920
If your desire is only up to Lakshmi power point

24:40.120 --> 24:42.480
that you want to have more money

24:42.680 --> 24:45.360
or you care for little things here and there,

24:45.560 --> 24:48.840
without any spiritual value to it,

24:49.040 --> 24:52.560
then your Lakshmi Tattwa at the most might be awakened.

24:52.760 --> 24:56.520
But this Lakshmi Tattwa has to become Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.280
That is for your ascent.

24:58.480 --> 25:02.360
And just to get it to that Mahalakshmi Tattwa

25:02.560 --> 25:06.920
what you have to do is to use all your material things

25:07.120 --> 25:10.880
and your material being in such a way that you please Me.

25:11.080 --> 25:13.120
That is very important.

25:13.320 --> 25:16.600
So you should not do something that will not please Me.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.520
That's very important, everybody must understand.

25:20.720 --> 25:25.680
I want you to understand that when you dress up, also,

25:25.880 --> 25:31.160
certain things I don't like, at all, like disheveled hairâ€¦ At all.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.120
That might be of fashion, whatever, but I don't like it.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.800
Always must be properly combed, properly done hair.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.960
These modern things you should give up, of disheveled hair,

25:41.160 --> 25:44.000
because this is a sign of pukka bhoots coming into you.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.440
If you have disheveled hair, the bhoots recognize the person

25:47.640 --> 25:49.960
and they get into such a person who has disheveled hair.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.840
So try to make your hair in a proper way,

25:53.040 --> 25:56.400
see now Indians how they make their hair.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.480
Look at them: they all make their hair properly.

25:59.680 --> 26:02.360
Because â€” I have nothing to do with your hair,

26:02.560 --> 26:07.560
I'm not a hairstyling person or anything,

26:07.760 --> 26:12.640
but â€” if you do not have your hair properly combed and done,

26:12.840 --> 26:17.040
then definitely you are in for trouble.

26:17.360 --> 26:21.800
So take heed to these things.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.840
Then, some people have a habit of being untidily dressed,

26:27.040 --> 26:30.120
that's also not a good thing. You have to be tidily dressed,

26:30.320 --> 26:32.200
clean and tidily dressed.

26:32.400 --> 26:35.520
Not because it is material,

26:35.720 --> 26:39.160
but is very important that if it is not so,

26:39.360 --> 26:41.920
that kind of a material will attract

26:42.120 --> 26:45.120
all the badhas into you.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.640
You must keep yourself clean and neat

26:50.840 --> 26:54.120
because these badhas should not enter.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.600
All these ideas that have come to the West

26:56.800 --> 26:59.560
have come from some satanic force.

26:59.760 --> 27:03.040
It doesn't look beautiful, in any way it doesn't look good

27:03.240 --> 27:06.360
for any spiritual person.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.440
We have to change our styles

27:09.640 --> 27:13.080
that will be appealing to the Divine and not to the bhoots.

27:13.280 --> 27:16.320
We don't want any bhoots to come on us.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.760
If you understand this simple fact,

27:18.960 --> 27:21.200
then you will start dressing up in a way

27:21.400 --> 27:26.120
that may not be modern, may not be ancient, whatever it is â€”

27:26.320 --> 27:30.600
is neat, clean, spick-and-span.

27:33.920 --> 27:39.040
Otherwise, also, if you see to the matter point more and more,

27:39.240 --> 27:42.120
no use accumulating thousand and one things

27:42.320 --> 27:47.000
which are plastic in temperament and nature.

27:47.200 --> 27:52.720
You should have few things which have a spiritual value.

27:53.960 --> 27:57.280
Not all extraordinary things that we try to have â€”

27:57.480 --> 28:00.040
because they have no spiritual value.

28:00.240 --> 28:05.200
So try not to accumulate all these nonsensical things to you.

28:05.400 --> 28:09.200
Gradually you will find you'll reduce, you go on reducing.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.680
You'll have simpler lives,

28:11.880 --> 28:15.840
better things and spiritual things.

28:16.040 --> 28:19.000
Whatever you buy, see the vibrations and then buy,

28:19.200 --> 28:20.440
otherwise just don't buy.

28:20.640 --> 28:24.560
Because all kinds of nonsensical bhoots will be in your house

28:24.760 --> 28:26.040
and you will be troubled.

28:26.240 --> 28:30.280
So whatever you want to buy you must see on vibratory awareness.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.440
If you cannot understand, ask somebody else, a Sahaja Yogi

28:33.640 --> 28:34.600
to help you out.

28:34.800 --> 28:39.000
But don't go on buying things just because you think they are cheap,

28:39.200 --> 28:42.240
or they are nice, or good.

28:42.440 --> 28:48.280
So try to buy things which, vibration-wise, are all right.

28:48.480 --> 28:52.320
And if it is not so â€” finished, it's nothing important.

28:52.520 --> 28:55.600
That "I must buy this, I have to go to Bombay to buy this" â€”

28:55.800 --> 28:58.800
that's a wrong idea.

28:59.880 --> 29:04.640
Now, attention has to be inward all the time.

29:04.840 --> 29:08.800
I've seen that our attention is outward.

29:09.000 --> 29:15.360
Because of that, what we see outside is not good for vibrations.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.280
But if your attention is inside,

29:18.480 --> 29:22.800
you will not buy anything that is not good for vibrations.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.720
Or you will not own some things, you'll just throw away.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.000
But the attention is outside

29:29.200 --> 29:33.520
and because of that you just don't know how to judge it.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.920
Nabhi Chakra has to be attended to.

29:36.120 --> 29:40.600
For that you don't have to think, you have to work it out,

29:40.800 --> 29:42.880
see which side of Nabhi is catching.

29:43.080 --> 29:46.920
If the right side is catching, for you sugar is the best.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.200
Sugar represents many things.

29:49.400 --> 29:53.000
Sugar means your, also, tongue should be sweet,

29:53.200 --> 29:55.080
you should talk sweetly.

29:55.280 --> 29:58.040
People think that if you talk sweetly to someone,

29:58.240 --> 30:01.320
then people will start thinking that you are good for nothing

30:01.520 --> 30:04.000
or you are absolutely a meek person.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.720
We have to be meek.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.880
We have to be meek and humble,

30:09.080 --> 30:12.800
we must learn how to talk sweetly to each other.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.440
And if you do not understand how to speak,

30:16.640 --> 30:19.680
then take more sugar, vibrated sugar.

30:19.880 --> 30:23.160
That will make your tongue sweeter and sweeter,

30:23.360 --> 30:26.000
and your ideas will be sweeter about another person

30:26.200 --> 30:28.640
than harsh and criticizing.

30:28.840 --> 30:31.960
So for the right-sided people sugar is suggested.

30:32.160 --> 30:35.120
For the left-sided people â€” salt.

30:35.320 --> 30:39.080
Left-sided people should take salt more,

30:39.280 --> 30:42.280
and with salt they can solve many problems

30:42.480 --> 30:47.400
because salt gives them a personality, a composer

30:47.600 --> 30:51.280
by which they can express themselves

30:51.480 --> 30:56.960
in a way which is dignified and so not very lethargic.

30:57.800 --> 31:01.840
So the speed of your talks

31:02.040 --> 31:05.440
or behavior or everything should be in the center.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.360
It should not be lethargic,

31:07.560 --> 31:11.480
nor should be too quick and fast and hectic.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.920
So you will understand

31:13.120 --> 31:15.800
Sahaja Yoga is the central point of everything.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.280
Everything in the center one should try to bring it.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.800
Not one extreme to another extreme.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
If you talk too much and jabber too much and if you are fast,

31:25.200 --> 31:27.920
try to reduce your speed

31:28.120 --> 31:32.040
by alertly

31:32.520 --> 31:34.960
looking at it. You have to be alert.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.320
See, "My speed is going up; there's no need for me to talk.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.720
Let me stop."

31:40.920 --> 31:43.960
But those who do not talk at all also not good.

31:44.160 --> 31:47.880
So those who talk or those who do not talk

31:48.080 --> 31:49.880
have to understand only one thing â€”

31:50.080 --> 31:54.720
that whatever we talk, we talk in the center.

31:57.160 --> 32:01.160
Once you understand that, your responses to things

32:01.360 --> 32:05.760
will be absolutely central, balanced and beautiful.

32:05.960 --> 32:09.760
Now, this is all for Me, I can say at this time because

32:09.960 --> 32:11.800
the time is short also for us â€”

32:12.000 --> 32:14.520
we have all enjoyed our stay all over,

32:14.720 --> 32:17.760
I think, so you all have been happy all over

32:17.960 --> 32:21.200
and we have worked it out very well.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.960
And it has been quite a lesson to all of us

32:25.160 --> 32:28.440
and also a very great experience of enjoyment.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.720
So â€” not to feel guilty about anything

32:30.920 --> 32:34.640
because feeling guilty you do not get over it.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.560
Feeling guilty is an escape, you must face it.

32:37.760 --> 32:42.440
You must face it and see, correct yourself â€” and be one with it.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.120
That is a much better way than to just

32:45.320 --> 32:48.000
to go on feeling guilty or aggressive.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.160
That's not the way â€” because I said it's not mental.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.960
So if you understand these few points

32:54.160 --> 32:57.360
on these two chakras â€” is Nabhi

32:57.560 --> 32:59.600
and your Heart â€”

32:59.800 --> 33:02.320
if you understand these two points clearly

33:02.520 --> 33:05.520
that you must keep it clear,

33:05.960 --> 33:09.240
and the expression of that will show

33:09.440 --> 33:11.320
in your behavior, in your dress,

33:11.520 --> 33:13.960
in your walk, gait, talking and everything outside

33:14.160 --> 33:16.200
but you cannot go from outside, inside.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.120
Supposing somebody says that all right,

33:18.320 --> 33:22.640
"Mother, I've combed my hair very well, so I'm all right."

33:22.840 --> 33:25.560
It's not so.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.040
Not necessarily.

33:27.240 --> 33:30.280
Even if you have combed your hair, you might be possessed by bhoot.

33:30.480 --> 33:34.200
But at least less chances.

33:34.400 --> 33:39.360
So one has to understand it, that it has to be worked out.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.400
I think, this must be really screwed into your head

33:42.600 --> 33:44.720
that Sahaja Yoga is to be worked out.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.920
You cannot just tell yourself, "Oh, I'm very happy",

33:48.120 --> 33:49.520
because it pampers your ego,

33:49.720 --> 33:54.280
or "very unhappy", because it is troubling through your superego.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.880
"I'm not very happy", "I'm not veryâ€¦"

33:58.080 --> 34:00.520
"I'm very happy" or "I'm very unhappy".

34:00.720 --> 34:04.160
That's not the way. You have to be in joy.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.440
And these things can work out.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.360
You should have patience with yourself, love for yourself

34:10.560 --> 34:12.800
and dignity,

34:13.000 --> 34:14.360
that you are Sahaja Yogis.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.600
Every individual has to work it out for himself,

34:17.800 --> 34:19.160
so the whole can be all right.

34:19.360 --> 34:23.320
There could be some people who are only worried about others.

34:23.520 --> 34:27.280
Worry about yourself â€” and see the good points of others,

34:27.480 --> 34:30.560
not the bad points but good points of others.

34:30.760 --> 34:35.400
And, also, if somebody has to tell you that you must organize,

34:35.600 --> 34:38.720
go fast and all that â€” not to feel bad, we have to be like that.

34:38.920 --> 34:42.040
We have to be very quick, we have to do so much work in this world,

34:42.240 --> 34:45.000
we have no time to waste. We have no time to waste.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.800
It has to be very quick

34:47.000 --> 34:51.960
and we have to be very prompt and healthy about it.

34:52.160 --> 34:54.560
As you know that â€” in this trip you have seen that â€”

34:54.760 --> 34:57.280
how much work I've been doing compared to you people.

34:57.480 --> 35:01.360
And I am so much older compared to you people.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.960
All right, you can say that "Mother, You are Adi Shakti",

35:04.160 --> 35:05.520
it's all right, but I'm your ideal.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.840
In any case, if somebody's your ideal,

35:08.040 --> 35:09.800
try to become like that person,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.360
try to imbibe those qualities in you.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.560
So,

35:13.760 --> 35:17.880
now I may have to bid farewell to most of you who are going away.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.600
I hope I'll be able to see you

35:19.800 --> 35:22.640
but, as you know, I have programs and programs and programs.

35:22.840 --> 35:26.520
I don't know where I'm going to stay and where I will be â€”

35:26.720 --> 35:29.240
in any case, I'll try to be there.

35:29.440 --> 35:31.160
So the program is today,

35:31.360 --> 35:35.040
I have a program which I have to go for, you don't have to go.

35:35.240 --> 35:37.760
Now you are going to Kalwa where you'll have your

35:37.960 --> 35:39.920
lunch, I will be there.

35:40.120 --> 35:45.400
In a village, in a village way they are cooking something for you.

35:45.720 --> 35:49.480
And then I will be

35:49.680 --> 35:53.480
busy with some other programs Myself, so I go direct to Bombay.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.960
Then tomorrow morning

35:57.440 --> 36:01.480
I have a program, you don't have a program.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.120
So â€” I don't know, some of you might have to come,

36:04.320 --> 36:06.680
I don't know what the situation is â€” in any case,

36:06.880 --> 36:08.280
if you have to go out shopping,

36:08.480 --> 36:10.600
you can go and do some shopping in Bombay

36:10.800 --> 36:13.720
and get things for yourself if you want to do it,

36:13.920 --> 36:15.480
those who are going back.

36:15.680 --> 36:19.560
And evening time there's a wedding ofâ€¦

36:22.880 --> 36:27.000
Kamakshi and Malcolm.

36:27.200 --> 36:32.040
And whatever you want to give collectively, a present to them,

36:32.240 --> 36:34.880
whatever you have to do, you can do it tomorrow morning.

36:35.080 --> 36:38.520
And then day after tomorrow morningâ€¦

36:43.600 --> 36:47.120
23rd morning youâ€¦ most of you have to go to Delhi.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.240
But there are some who are not going to Delhi.

36:49.440 --> 36:53.560
Now raise your hands who are not going to Delhi on the 23rd.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.760
Warren?

37:04.960 --> 37:07.640
Warren? Warren isn't going?

37:07.840 --> 37:11.760
Warren, what is it, you are not going?

37:17.920 --> 37:19.000
All right. Soâ€¦

37:19.200 --> 37:21.320
YOGI: The rest of the group, fifty three people are going.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.280
All right. So you all are going.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.960
Those who are not going,

37:26.160 --> 37:29.560
out of them whoâ€¦ those who are going to Delhi,

37:29.760 --> 37:33.640
not 23rd but later on, raise your hands.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.760
London and Europe people.

37:39.960 --> 37:43.400
So this is the second group.

37:43.600 --> 37:46.240
Now those who are going to Delhi afterwards

37:46.440 --> 37:48.720
please see that you book your seats.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.840
You shouldn't give Me headache about this, you see,

37:51.040 --> 37:53.080
so you book your seats properly.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.520
All of you may not get your reservations,

37:55.720 --> 37:57.280
some of you are going by train.

37:57.480 --> 38:02.480
And inform the people in Delhi, yourself, organize it. You see?

38:02.680 --> 38:04.120
You can have Perekar

38:04.320 --> 38:07.960
and also somebody else, Jayvant â€” to help you out.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.800
That those who are going â€”

38:10.000 --> 38:13.240
these two persons, Perekar and Jayvant will look after you,

38:13.440 --> 38:15.440
you book your seatsâ€¦

38:20.120 --> 38:22.360
So you book your seats.

38:22.600 --> 38:26.880
Then also somebody must talk to Delhi people and find out,

38:27.080 --> 38:32.160
because they want to have you there for about seven days, with them.

38:32.360 --> 38:34.960
Now, 26 January you all should be there,

38:35.160 --> 38:36.840
I hope you are all going to be there.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.960
26th morning they want to take you around to see the parade,

38:40.160 --> 38:43.320
I may not be there, 26th evening I may be there, I don't know.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.680
27th they are starting the program.

38:45.880 --> 38:50.240
So till the 26th whatever you have to do you can finish,

38:50.440 --> 38:52.600
and 27th I am starting my program,

38:52.800 --> 38:55.040
but still you will be staying with them, I think.

38:55.240 --> 39:00.120
They have got these flats from the 28th.

39:00.320 --> 39:03.440
So they have a wrong conception about you, they think you all want

39:03.640 --> 39:06.280
bathrooms and things attached, so they got the flats.

39:06.480 --> 39:08.840
And I told them that "Don't get the flats â€”

39:09.040 --> 39:12.200
is firstly they are rather expensive and

39:12.400 --> 39:18.200
also they don't want it, they want to go in a bungalow."

39:18.400 --> 39:21.280
But I don't know, they also have got conceptions,

39:21.480 --> 39:24.920
they think you are too attached to bathrooms, soâ€¦

39:25.240 --> 39:28.240
Which is true also.

39:29.800 --> 39:33.160
So they think they are obliging us by giving us

39:33.360 --> 39:35.520
bathroom attached rooms, you see.

39:35.720 --> 39:36.760
So that is why

39:36.960 --> 39:39.240
it has happened, now, whatever has happened has happened.

39:39.440 --> 39:42.040
Now, for the marriages.

39:42.240 --> 39:45.480
We have decided on marriages on these days.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.680
Now who has got the list?

39:56.200 --> 39:59.200
Who has got the list?

40:11.280 --> 40:14.680
YOGI: England mistakenly made [NAME] to [NAME]

40:14.880 --> 40:17.360
she should not be there, she's from Switzerland.

40:17.560 --> 40:19.160
Apart from that, that is the full list.

40:19.360 --> 40:21.560
Her marriage is already sorted.

40:21.760 --> 40:25.480
So, I don't know, but it's about eighty percent fixed.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.680
Soâ€¦

40:27.880 --> 40:30.880
Now, this you have given me, but now what I am trying to say,

40:31.080 --> 40:34.760
that who has chosen whom, that's not yet known.

40:34.960 --> 40:38.680
So pass on this list and by the time we are in Delhi you tell me.

40:38.880 --> 40:41.880
The marriages are going to be on the 6th.

40:42.080 --> 40:45.600
So there's still time for us to sort it out. On the 6th.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.480
YOGI: I think most of them are relying upon You

40:47.680 --> 40:48.600
to make certain suggestions.

40:48.800 --> 40:53.840
No no, I won't. I'm sorry, sir. Not me, sir.

40:54.520 --> 40:58.480
You know the joke? There was a fellow sitting on the fence

40:58.680 --> 41:02.360
and another gentleman went and going in a car he asked him,

41:02.560 --> 41:05.160
"How do you go to such a place?"

41:05.360 --> 41:08.080
So he just looked at him, he said, "Not me, sorry,

41:08.280 --> 41:09.920
I'm not going to tell you."

41:10.120 --> 41:11.040
He said, "Why?"

41:11.240 --> 41:15.360
He said, "The one I told before has punched my nose.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.680
Not me, sorry."

41:17.880 --> 41:22.760
Will you please decide for yourself because decision making

41:22.960 --> 41:26.120
is so much there in the ego.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.280
So you do it in a proper way.

41:28.480 --> 41:31.200
Make your own decisions, you'll stick onto it better.

41:31.400 --> 41:35.360
Still that exists. Exists, what can we do about it.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.640
It exists, still.

41:36.840 --> 41:40.000
So betterâ€¦ this is the list, you go through it,

41:40.200 --> 41:44.560
make your selections and choices and don't force on anyone.

41:44.760 --> 41:48.440
Because again the same question, "No, sorry".

41:49.880 --> 41:54.760
It's absurd the way we do things, absurd, absolutely absurd.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.760
Marriage is not so important that way.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.600
Not so important. But this ego comes back

42:00.800 --> 42:03.480
and, "I have decided and now I have not",

42:03.680 --> 42:07.760
and then this and â€” all nonsense it is.

42:10.680 --> 42:15.000
So with that idea that once you are married you are married forever.

42:15.320 --> 42:16.720
Take a decision properly.

42:16.920 --> 42:18.440
So I bless all of you -

42:18.640 --> 42:21.320
all the brides and the bridegrooms. But I think there are more

42:21.520 --> 42:23.760
bridegrooms than the brides.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.560
YOGI: Yes, that's true, Mother.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.240
So I'll have to find out some brides.

42:28.440 --> 42:30.760
YOGI: A couple of them - two of them particularly have asked

42:30.960 --> 42:32.400
if they can marry Indian ladies at some point

42:32.600 --> 42:34.520
Not necessarily this time, Mother.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.240
There's one from Australiaâ€¦ two from Australia.

42:37.440 --> 42:38.200
Good idea.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.720
YOGI: They'd like to marry Maharashtrian girls.

42:39.920 --> 42:41.880
The one that was .. you were

42:42.080 --> 42:44.760
telling about, he's about 39 or something.

42:44.960 --> 42:47.080
YOGI: Yes, he'sâ€¦ he's one of them. Andâ€¦

42:47.280 --> 42:52.160
For him I found a girl but she's not yet been divorced, you see.

42:56.200 --> 42:59.280
She's not yet been divorced.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.640
So, any other questions you have,

43:07.840 --> 43:10.280
please ask Me before we start the puja.

43:10.480 --> 43:12.880
Good idea.

43:13.080 --> 43:14.880
Any other question?

43:15.080 --> 43:16.960
If you have really some question, ask,

43:17.160 --> 43:22.120
otherwise we have to finish the puja fast and we have to go away.

43:27.760 --> 43:29.960
YOGINI: Perhaps some of us don't know who the men are

43:30.160 --> 43:32.840
who are taking care of our tickets for Delhi

43:33.040 --> 43:35.880
I'm not familiar with them, I don't know the people,

43:36.080 --> 43:39.040
is there someone I can ask to be introduced to, so we know

43:39.240 --> 43:44.280
to see about our tickets for Delhi, I don't know their names.

43:45.080 --> 43:49.440
I have to go to America to really understand what did you say.

43:49.640 --> 43:50.520
What did she say?

43:50.720 --> 43:53.720
YOGI: About the tickets Shri Mataji - tell her to see Warren.

43:53.920 --> 43:57.560
Warren, you should see Warren. All right.

43:57.880 --> 44:01.880
Brian. Brian and Warren. All right.

44:02.080 --> 44:05.920
Now I have forgotten again American English. I'm sorry.

44:06.120 --> 44:09.920
In America I understand and I forget it, you see.

44:12.920 --> 44:16.080
English has so many versions.

44:18.440 --> 44:22.200
Australian English is differentâ€¦ Every English is different,

44:22.400 --> 44:26.080
So sorry I've forgotten the American English.

44:26.280 --> 44:29.280
I'll get to it very soon.

44:29.880 --> 44:32.880
All right, done.

44:34.240 --> 44:37.240
Nowâ€¦

44:41.360 --> 44:44.320
Only people from Vaitarna. Come along those who have not done puja

44:46.560 --> 44:49.080
Only they will have the chance, all right?

44:49.280 --> 44:55.240
Only people from Vaitarna and from Bhatsa or from Chhapur.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
First of all Ganesha Stuti.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.880
Do you know the meaning of it? YOGI: Yes, I do.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.640
You just tell them the meaning.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.080
That is the the Nabhi Chakra.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.240
There's a knot between Nabhi Chakra and Swadisthan Chakra,

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.640
that's the first knot. That is to be broken,

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.920
otherwise the Kundalini doesn't rise out of it,

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:50.960
this is Raja Yoga

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.240
This is so called Raja Yoga which works out inside you.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.320
The Mother breaks all that and brings up the Kundalini.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.160
the Kundalini bringing the devotion

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.760
Devotion comes only from heart, clean heart.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.800
Devotion is not what you are showing off or anything,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
devotion is within your heart.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.040
Because she is the support of everything,

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.640
that's the absolute point.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:09.320
The absolute point does not mean the another absolute.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.080
Pataka means the sins.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.520
Becauseâ€¦ that's why people ask you

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.880
that we have to do cleansing, this thing, that thing,

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.200
but there's somebody who's a destroyer of sins.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.960
You don't have to worry anything like that,

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.160
that person can destroy all your sins.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Who cannot be compared.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.280
Who has ocean of compassion.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.400
The one who cannot be thought of, who cannot be understood.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:11.520
All the rakshas - Chanda, Munda, all of them.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.320
Mahatye  - Mahatye

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.160
Of great importance.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.600
Auspicious work.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.640
Shubhakari - whatever she works out,

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.280
She makes it auspicious. She creates auspiciousness.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.280
Paramanu. Paramanu means theâ€¦

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:34.280
what you call the atom or the smallest molecule- beyond the molecule

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.760
Paramanu. In Sanskrit language means

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.440
"parama" then "anu".

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:46.080
Parama means the last one or the smallest.
