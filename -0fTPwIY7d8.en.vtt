00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.000
So now we are coming to the end

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.120
of our first half tour.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.240
Now we have to look back upon ourselves

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.880
and try to find out what have we achieved out of this.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.720
We must understand that Sahaja Yoga

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.240
is not done through brain activities.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.040
Like many people think that if you just

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.920
tell yourself, "You have to be like this", it will work out.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.520
If you have to all the time inform yourself that,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.720
"Oh, you must get rid of a particular problem", you'll be all right.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.960
Or some people think that if they tell somebody,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.200
that "This is wrong with you and you should get well",

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.160
it will be all right. It is not so.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.240
Because Sahaja Yoga does not work on mental level.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.920
It works on spiritual level which is a much higher level

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.640
than the mental level.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.960
So what you have to do

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.160
is to understand how to correct your chakras.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.880
And you must understand how to work out your machines.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.560
Perhaps people still live

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.360
on mental level and try to solve problems on mental level.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.240
And that's why all the problems start coming out.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.520
Now, if you have a problem with any chakras

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.160
or there is anything catching

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.240
or you find that there's something wrong with you,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.440
no use working it out on any other level but spiritual level.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.360
Some people believe that if they have dressed up like something

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.720
or if they outwardly behave like something, they become that.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.520
That is not true.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.640
Like we have hippies in the West

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.040
and they think that they have become primitive.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.280
You do not become primitive by believing it.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.840
Because you are so overdeveloped, that you cannot become primitive.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.800
So by just doing something mentally we do not become.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.120
Now, this mental level

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.200
can go even further in a subtler way into people.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.360
Some of you might feel that by

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.560
knowing some of the aartis and things by heart

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.040
you will achieve great depth, it is not true, also.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.320
Because that is also just words.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.160
But, if that is an awakened thing within you,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.360
then they become a mantra.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.600
And then you can work it out.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.440
But first of all you must achieve a certain standard

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.600
to have that power to create the mantras.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.600
Also, when you say some aarti, it's not necessarily

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.680
possible that it will work out.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.320
Let us face the things as they are

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.200
and not to be conditioned by anything else.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.880
You have to achieve a certain depth within yourself

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:27.040
to even enlighten the mantras.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.080
First of all you should have clear-cut vibrations,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.880
minimum of minimum.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.080
If you have certain chakras catching, then

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.800
try to improve your chakras with the photograph.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.240
With all due respect to the photograph. It's only the photograph

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.720
which is going to work it out. Nothing else.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.640
Or if I am there.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.400
But once you have achieved a certain state of enlightenment,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:02.000
then you can use mantras otherwise also, it will help you.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.160
But first of all your heart must be clear.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.920
I've found out, in general, there are two chakras

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.120
overwhelmingly

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.720
not working all right in most of the western people.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.440
First is the heart.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.360
That means heart is not clear,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.360
that heart is not clean,

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.400
that in the heart you still are a small person,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.480
in the heart you have not placed your Mother.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.440
You have to purify your heart

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.640
by looking at the photograph and putting all loving feelings

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.600
about your Mother, understanding Her work

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.440
and putting Her into your heart.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.920
If the heart is not clear,

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.480
then everything has no meaning because it is a "dark heart"

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.680
which is doing all these things.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.480
The heart has to be clean, absolutely surrendered

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:18.200
and must try to put Me before everything else.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.320
I can tell you because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.160
I cannot say this to people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.120
Now, we always try to relate

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.680
Sahaja Yoga from our own terms,

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.000
not from the terms that belong to God.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.280
God is what He is, He cannot change Himself. You have to change.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.480
So whatever we think about God we want to put on that.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.720
For example, if someone

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.920
thinks that he tries to be nice or good to Me,

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.720
or if he is close to Me, so-called,

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.560
and if he thinks he is organizing better

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.640
or he's doing this work or that work

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.560
or anything else like that, where he feels

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.400
that he's important because he is doing this job or that job,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.920
then one must know

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.680
that all this is mental.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.080
Actually, you are doing nothing.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.920
Whenever you try to do something,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.920
you really confuse yourself and confuse Me also.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.200
You have seen yesterday's example.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.520
I was sure that they had to go next day.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.280
But nobody would listen to Me, and they rushed away

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.680
and they found that the tickets were for the next day.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.440
This knowledge comes to you if you are clear-hearted.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.880
As yesterday I said, "You better not come".

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.720
I didn't know what was the situation there -

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.640
I just said, "Don't come" — finished.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.760
Because I knew what was going to happen there.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.600
So this clear-cut idea comes to you when your heart is clean.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.920
But first of all, people do not understand that you have to work it

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.560
through your heart and not through your brain.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.320
When we have to work out things through our brain,

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.320
we try to develop our brain, isn't it?

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.200
By memorizing, by practising something,

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.320
teaching our brain how to think, how to go this way that way.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.320
We try to train our brain.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.440
Now, we have to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.360
And to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.400
one has to know, first of all,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.600
that it is enveloped either by ego or by superego.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.320
The limbic area actually represents the heart.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.960
And if there is ego, heart will always be so-called,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.800
it will not be the real heart that will be working,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.760
but it's only mental, mental projection.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.480
And you will feel that I'm doing it from my heart.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.080
but it's not true.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.840
Now then, supposing, what should we do if we have ego?

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.840
You might say you should try to

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.520
sort of tell yourself that that's not good and

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.440
this and that and all kinds of mental suggestions

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.280
or autosuggestions or this -

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.640
the way psychiatrists know that give you suggestions.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.440
That's again mental.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.160
So that's not the way it is going to work out.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.800
We must understand that for that what we have to do is to

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.360
raise the left side and put it to the right side.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.960
There's no other way out.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.240
You have to just work it out with your hands,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.000
your hands are working it out and not your brain.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.560
So use your hands and the methods of Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:01.000
Now, everyone must have

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.840
a regular sitting in the water every day, that's important.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.440
Every morning you must do your meditation.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:15.120
Because on mental level we feel we have been with Mother, all right,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.440
this exposure is all right.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.400
You came you saw how Indians are and how they are light

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:27.960
on their feet and how they are good for Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.800
But after seeing all that

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.880
you have to know that Sahaja Yoga is to be worked out,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.080
it 's not to be thought out.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.440
You just cannot think about it.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.280
Whatever you may try to do through your thought,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.480
you cannot achieve any results in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.400
You have to use your hands, you have to use your feet,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.720
you have to soak your feet in the water because water is the ocean.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.160
All these five chakras -

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.440
or, say, six chakras

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:07.280
which are — I say five because the… one is the Mooladhara Chakra,

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:13.400
which is the seventh, and the topmost is the brain.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.400
So in between five chakras which are there —

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.880
are to be handled fully

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:26.600
with the idea that they are basically made of matter.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.480
And these five elements constitute

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.480
the body of these chakras.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.120
Now, these chakras,

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.080
if they are to be corrected, we have to correct them by taking out

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.400
all the problems of these chakras into the elements

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.600
from which they're coming.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.920
For example, a person who is a very right-sided person.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.440
So he has to give a balance by the left-side.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.120
Of course, raising with the hand is all right,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.920
but what about the element?

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:14.080
Right-sided person has all the elements which give heat:

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.920
we can say, the light, we can say, the fire.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.480
So for people who are right-sided

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.400
the light is not going to help much.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.320
Like if you put the light before the photograph,

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.440
and those who are ego-oriented people —

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.040
if you just use the light, it's not going to work out.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.800
So what is going to work out is the Mother Earth

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.960
and the water element, which is cooling.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:52.360
Even ice is very helpful to people who are right-sided.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:00.320
So all cooling effects should be used for correcting

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.240
your right-sidedness,

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.400
so that you cool it down.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.760
Same about food.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.320
In food, those who are right-sided people should take to

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.280
foods which are left-sided, that is carbohydrates —

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.280
means they should become partly vegetarians,

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.800
or quite a lot vegetarian —

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.720
and should eat things at the most like chicken,

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:35.120
but not fishes, not seafoods because they are all hot.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:41.080
That's how you treat your material side of your chakras.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.320
Now, the left-sided people should use, again,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.640
the deepam — is the light — or the fire

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.440
to correct their left side.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.280
Also in food

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:00.120
such people should take more to nitrogenous, means protein

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.160
and foods like that. They should take more proteins.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.480
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.720
the basic thing is Kundalini.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:21.080
And the Kundalini, as I have told you, is the pure desire.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:25.760
Again, listen to it carefully: pure desire.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.240
That means all other desires are impure.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.600
There's only one pure desire. And that is to be one with the Divine.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.680
One with the Brahma, one with God — that's the only pure desire.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.160
All other desires are impure.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.280
So train your mind gradually

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.600
to achieve that desire as the main thing.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.120
If you train your mind in that fashion,

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.280
then you can develop pure desire,

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.960
so all other desires will negate, gradually.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.360
All right.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:14.560
Now, this desire to be one with the Divine

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.000
is the purest and the highest.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.200
And to achieve that

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.680
what have you to do?

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.440
To achieve that you have to keep your Mother pleased.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.480
Very simple.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.800
Adi Shankaracharya has said that you don't bother about it,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.240
just keep your Mother pleased.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.440
You have to be a simple person,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.280
not try to be cunning with Me or clever with Me,

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.720
I know everyone very well.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.080
Try to tell yourself that "I should say things,

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.720
I should behave in a manner that will please my Mother."

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.560
Supposing you are in Sahaja Yoga and you are doing wrong things.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.840
It is not going to please Me at all.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.200
So how to please Mother — that you should try to see for yourself,

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:14.440
what kind of a thing pleases Me the best.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.600
I am also a very simple person.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.200
So I want a simple-hearted person who is simple about it.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.560
For example, a person who tries to show off too much,

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.920
try to be always the first

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.000
or try to be always the… sort of a

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.320
cinema star — I don't like such people.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.360
You have to be very quiet

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.960
and extremely

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.560
shy about showing off yourself.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.320
Do I show off that I am Adi Shakti?

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.840
I do not.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.800
I live like you, absolutely like you, do I try to show off?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.160
Then why should you try to show off to Me?

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.440
So that kind of a person is no good.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.960
Secondly, you should not be tense with Me,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.240
there is no need to be tense.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.160
If I find something wrong with you,

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.920
if I scold you also — it's for your good.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.000
If I say a good word — it is for your good.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.600
My Sahaja Yoga works this way.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.440
I have no malice against

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.520
anyone in the whole world, no malice at all,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.120
and no anger for anyone in this world.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.240
I have nothing but compassion, but in compassion sometimes

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.400
I have to scold and in the same compassion I have to speak

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.320
in a very compassionate manner.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.360
So both ways it helps you,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.400
it helps you both ways.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.120
So thank God

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.160
that you have somebody who will correct you at the right time,

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.560
for your good, because you are saints.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.840
And you have come on this Earth to establish God's Kingdom.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.520
That's what you have to do.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.680
And if you are the people

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.640
who are not respected, who are not sensible,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.120
who haven't got the dignity, who behave in a cheapish way,

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.320
how can people accept you.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.080
So this Heart Chakra is to be first looked after.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.920
That with your heart —

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.520
desire that you'll keep your Mother pleased.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.480
Even if I'm angry with you, don't feel bad about it.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.440
That's one of the signs that Sahaja Yoga has not yet developed.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.800
If I scold you, it is because there's something in you

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.440
which has to go away and which I must scold so it will go away.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:49.280
So accept it just as a correcting point that is good for you,

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.920
some sort of a thorn is within you

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.040
which has to be taken out by another thorn,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.160
and Mother has taken it out.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.360
Once you start understanding the compassion of your Mother,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.240
you will not mind.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.880
My saying anything to you, My correcting you

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.040
or My telling you that this is wrong.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.120
Because I have to do that.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.520
Now, those people who do not have a good heart, clean heart,

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.760
cannot understand this.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.560
They cannot understand this. Very difficult.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.800
So you keep your heart clean towards your Mother.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.200
Whatever I do for you is just a blessing, always a blessing for you.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.760
Whatever I do for you is a blessing, remember that.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.120
Now, another chakra which is

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.920
horribly caught up with most of you is your Nabhi Chakra,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.800
suggesting that you are still very very materialistic.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.880
In small small things also we are materialistic,

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.800
it becomes subtler and subtler and subtler…

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.240
So try to understand that matter is not so important.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.440
Matter is just there to please each other.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.360
Specially to please your Mother.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.720
It has no other value whatsoever.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.320
So you should not try to be materialistic, in the sense that,

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.160
you see, for a little thing you have to do this,

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.240
for a little thing you have to do that.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.520
Nothing is important. If it works out — well and good,

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.200
and if it doesn't work out — well and good.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.120
So, you see, Nabhi Chakra is very individualistic,

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.520
very individualistic. It is everybody's personal thing.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.920
If your desire is only up to Lakshmi power point

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.480
that you want to have more money

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.360
or you care for little things here and there,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.840
without any spiritual value to it,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.560
then your Lakshmi Tattwa at the most might be awakened.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.520
But this Lakshmi Tattwa has to become Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.280
That is for your ascent.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.360
And just to get it to that Mahalakshmi Tattwa

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.920
what you have to do is to use all your material things

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.880
and your material being in such a way that you please Me.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.120
That is very important.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.600
So you should not do something that will not please Me.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.520
That's very important, everybody must understand.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.680
I want you to understand that when you dress up, also,

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:31.160
certain things I don't like, at all, like disheveled hair… At all.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.120
That might be of fashion, whatever, but I don't like it.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.800
Always must be properly combed, properly done hair.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.960
These modern things you should give up, of disheveled hair,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.000
because this is a sign of pukka bhoots coming into you.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.440
If you have disheveled hair, the bhoots recognize the person

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.960
and they get into such a person who has disheveled hair.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.840
So try to make your hair in a proper way,

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.400
see now Indians how they make their hair.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.480
Look at them: they all make their hair properly.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.360
Because — I have nothing to do with your hair,

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.560
I'm not a hairstyling person or anything,

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.640
but — if you do not have your hair properly combed and done,

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.040
then definitely you are in for trouble.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.800
So take heed to these things.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.840
Then, some people have a habit of being untidily dressed,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.120
that's also not a good thing. You have to be tidily dressed,

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.200
clean and tidily dressed.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.520
Not because it is material,

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.160
but is very important that if it is not so,

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.920
that kind of a material will attract

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.120
all the badhas into you.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.640
You must keep yourself clean and neat

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.120
because these badhas should not enter.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.600
All these ideas that have come to the West

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.560
have come from some satanic force.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.040
It doesn't look beautiful, in any way it doesn't look good

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.360
for any spiritual person.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.440
We have to change our styles

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.080
that will be appealing to the Divine and not to the bhoots.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.320
We don't want any bhoots to come on us.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.760
If you understand this simple fact,

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.200
then you will start dressing up in a way

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:26.120
that may not be modern, may not be ancient, whatever it is —

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.600
is neat, clean, spick-and-span.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:39.040
Otherwise, also, if you see to the matter point more and more,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.120
no use accumulating thousand and one things

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.000
which are plastic in temperament and nature.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.720
You should have few things which have a spiritual value.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.280
Not all extraordinary things that we try to have —

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.040
because they have no spiritual value.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.200
So try not to accumulate all these nonsensical things to you.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.200
Gradually you will find you'll reduce, you go on reducing.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.680
You'll have simpler lives,

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.840
better things and spiritual things.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.000
Whatever you buy, see the vibrations and then buy,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.440
otherwise just don't buy.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.560
Because all kinds of nonsensical bhoots will be in your house

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.040
and you will be troubled.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.280
So whatever you want to buy you must see on vibratory awareness.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.440
If you cannot understand, ask somebody else, a Sahaja Yogi

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.600
to help you out.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:39.000
But don't go on buying things just because you think they are cheap,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.240
or they are nice, or good.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:48.280
So try to buy things which, vibration-wise, are all right.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.320
And if it is not so — finished, it's nothing important.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.600
That "I must buy this, I have to go to Bombay to buy this" —

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.800
that's a wrong idea.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:04.640
Now, attention has to be inward all the time.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.800
I've seen that our attention is outward.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.360
Because of that, what we see outside is not good for vibrations.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.280
But if your attention is inside,

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.800
you will not buy anything that is not good for vibrations.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.720
Or you will not own some things, you'll just throw away.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.000
But the attention is outside

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.520
and because of that you just don't know how to judge it.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.920
Nabhi Chakra has to be attended to.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.600
For that you don't have to think, you have to work it out,

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.880
see which side of Nabhi is catching.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.920
If the right side is catching, for you sugar is the best.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.200
Sugar represents many things.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.000
Sugar means your, also, tongue should be sweet,

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.080
you should talk sweetly.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.040
People think that if you talk sweetly to someone,

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.320
then people will start thinking that you are good for nothing

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.000
or you are absolutely a meek person.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.720
We have to be meek.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.880
We have to be meek and humble,

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.800
we must learn how to talk sweetly to each other.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.440
And if you do not understand how to speak,

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.680
then take more sugar, vibrated sugar.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.160
That will make your tongue sweeter and sweeter,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.000
and your ideas will be sweeter about another person

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.640
than harsh and criticizing.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.960
So for the right-sided people sugar is suggested.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.120
For the left-sided people — salt.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.080
Left-sided people should take salt more,

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.280
and with salt they can solve many problems

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.400
because salt gives them a personality, a composer

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.280
by which they can express themselves

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.960
in a way which is dignified and so not very lethargic.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.840
So the speed of your talks

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.440
or behavior or everything should be in the center.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.360
It should not be lethargic,

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.480
nor should be too quick and fast and hectic.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.920
So you will understand

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.800
Sahaja Yoga is the central point of everything.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.280
Everything in the center one should try to bring it.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.800
Not one extreme to another extreme.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
If you talk too much and jabber too much and if you are fast,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.920
try to reduce your speed

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:32.040
by alertly

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.960
looking at it. You have to be alert.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.320
See, "My speed is going up; there's no need for me to talk.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.720
Let me stop."

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.960
But those who do not talk at all also not good.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.880
So those who talk or those who do not talk

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.880
have to understand only one thing —

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.720
that whatever we talk, we talk in the center.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.160
Once you understand that, your responses to things

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.760
will be absolutely central, balanced and beautiful.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.760
Now, this is all for Me, I can say at this time because

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.800
the time is short also for us —

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.520
we have all enjoyed our stay all over,

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.760
I think, so you all have been happy all over

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.200
and we have worked it out very well.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.960
And it has been quite a lesson to all of us

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.440
and also a very great experience of enjoyment.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.720
So — not to feel guilty about anything

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.640
because feeling guilty you do not get over it.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.560
Feeling guilty is an escape, you must face it.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.440
You must face it and see, correct yourself — and be one with it.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.120
That is a much better way than to just

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.000
to go on feeling guilty or aggressive.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.160
That's not the way — because I said it's not mental.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.960
So if you understand these few points

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.360
on these two chakras — is Nabhi

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.600
and your Heart —

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.320
if you understand these two points clearly

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.520
that you must keep it clear,

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.240
and the expression of that will show

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.320
in your behavior, in your dress,

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.960
in your walk, gait, talking and everything outside

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.200
but you cannot go from outside, inside.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.120
Supposing somebody says that all right,

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.640
"Mother, I've combed my hair very well, so I'm all right."

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.560
It's not so.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.040
Not necessarily.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.280
Even if you have combed your hair, you might be possessed by bhoot.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.200
But at least less chances.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:39.360
So one has to understand it, that it has to be worked out.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.400
I think, this must be really screwed into your head

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.720
that Sahaja Yoga is to be worked out.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.920
You cannot just tell yourself, "Oh, I'm very happy",

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.520
because it pampers your ego,

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:54.280
or "very unhappy", because it is troubling through your superego.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.880
"I'm not very happy", "I'm not very…"

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.520
"I'm very happy" or "I'm very unhappy".

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.160
That's not the way. You have to be in joy.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.440
And these things can work out.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.360
You should have patience with yourself, love for yourself

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.800
and dignity,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.360
that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.600
Every individual has to work it out for himself,

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.160
so the whole can be all right.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:23.320
There could be some people who are only worried about others.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.280
Worry about yourself — and see the good points of others,

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.560
not the bad points but good points of others.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:35.400
And, also, if somebody has to tell you that you must organize,

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.720
go fast and all that — not to feel bad, we have to be like that.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.040
We have to be very quick, we have to do so much work in this world,

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.000
we have no time to waste. We have no time to waste.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.800
It has to be very quick

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.960
and we have to be very prompt and healthy about it.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.560
As you know that — in this trip you have seen that —

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.280
how much work I've been doing compared to you people.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.360
And I am so much older compared to you people.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.960
All right, you can say that "Mother, You are Adi Shakti",

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.520
it's all right, but I'm your ideal.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.840
In any case, if somebody's your ideal,

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.800
try to become like that person,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.360
try to imbibe those qualities in you.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.560
So,

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.880
now I may have to bid farewell to most of you who are going away.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.600
I hope I'll be able to see you

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.640
but, as you know, I have programs and programs and programs.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.520
I don't know where I'm going to stay and where I will be —

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.240
in any case, I'll try to be there.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.160
So the program is today,

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.040
I have a program which I have to go for, you don't have to go.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.760
Now you are going to Kalwa where you'll have your

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.920
lunch, I will be there.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:45.400
In a village, in a village way they are cooking something for you.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.480
And then I will be

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.480
busy with some other programs Myself, so I go direct to Bombay.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.960
Then tomorrow morning

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.480
I have a program, you don't have a program.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.120
So — I don't know, some of you might have to come,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.680
I don't know what the situation is — in any case,

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.280
if you have to go out shopping,

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.600
you can go and do some shopping in Bombay

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.720
and get things for yourself if you want to do it,

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.480
those who are going back.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.560
And evening time there's a wedding of…

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.000
Kamakshi and Malcolm.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:32.040
And whatever you want to give collectively, a present to them,

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.880
whatever you have to do, you can do it tomorrow morning.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.520
And then day after tomorrow morning…

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.120
23rd morning you… most of you have to go to Delhi.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.240
But there are some who are not going to Delhi.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.560
Now raise your hands who are not going to Delhi on the 23rd.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.760
Warren?

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.640
Warren? Warren isn't going?

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.760
Warren, what is it, you are not going?

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.000
All right. So…

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.320
YOGI: The rest of the group, fifty three people are going.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.280
All right. So you all are going.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.960
Those who are not going,

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.560
out of them who… those who are going to Delhi,

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.640
not 23rd but later on, raise your hands.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.760
London and Europe people.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.400
So this is the second group.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.240
Now those who are going to Delhi afterwards

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.720
please see that you book your seats.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.840
You shouldn't give Me headache about this, you see,

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.080
so you book your seats properly.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.520
All of you may not get your reservations,

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.280
some of you are going by train.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:02.480
And inform the people in Delhi, yourself, organize it. You see?

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.120
You can have Perekar

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.960
and also somebody else, Jayvant — to help you out.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.800
That those who are going —

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.240
these two persons, Perekar and Jayvant will look after you,

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.440
you book your seats…

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.360
So you book your seats.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.880
Then also somebody must talk to Delhi people and find out,

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:32.160
because they want to have you there for about seven days, with them.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.960
Now, 26 January you all should be there,

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.840
I hope you are all going to be there.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.960
26th morning they want to take you around to see the parade,

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:43.320
I may not be there, 26th evening I may be there, I don't know.

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.680
27th they are starting the program.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:50.240
So till the 26th whatever you have to do you can finish,

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.600
and 27th I am starting my program,

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.040
but still you will be staying with them, I think.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:00.120
They have got these flats from the 28th.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.440
So they have a wrong conception about you, they think you all want

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.280
bathrooms and things attached, so they got the flats.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.840
And I told them that "Don't get the flats —

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.200
is firstly they are rather expensive and

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:18.200
also they don't want it, they want to go in a bungalow."

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.280
But I don't know, they also have got conceptions,

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.920
they think you are too attached to bathrooms, so…

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.240
Which is true also.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.160
So they think they are obliging us by giving us

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.520
bathroom attached rooms, you see.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:36.760
So that is why

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.240
it has happened, now, whatever has happened has happened.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.040
Now, for the marriages.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.480
We have decided on marriages on these days.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.680
Now who has got the list?

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.200
Who has got the list?

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.680
YOGI: England mistakenly made [NAME] to [NAME]

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.360
she should not be there, she's from Switzerland.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.160
Apart from that, that is the full list.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.560
Her marriage is already sorted.

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.480
So, I don't know, but it's about eighty percent fixed.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.680
So…

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.880
Now, this you have given me, but now what I am trying to say,

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.760
that who has chosen whom, that's not yet known.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.680
So pass on this list and by the time we are in Delhi you tell me.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.880
The marriages are going to be on the 6th.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.600
So there's still time for us to sort it out. On the 6th.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.480
YOGI: I think most of them are relying upon You

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.600
to make certain suggestions.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.840
No no, I won't. I'm sorry, sir. Not me, sir.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.480
You know the joke? There was a fellow sitting on the fence

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.360
and another gentleman went and going in a car he asked him,

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.160
"How do you go to such a place?"

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.080
So he just looked at him, he said, "Not me, sorry,

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.920
I'm not going to tell you."

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.040
He said, "Why?"

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.360
He said, "The one I told before has punched my nose.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.680
Not me, sorry."

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:22.760
Will you please decide for yourself because decision making

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.120
is so much there in the ego.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.280
So you do it in a proper way.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.200
Make your own decisions, you'll stick onto it better.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.360
Still that exists. Exists, what can we do about it.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.640
It exists, still.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.000
So better… this is the list, you go through it,

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.560
make your selections and choices and don't force on anyone.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.440
Because again the same question, "No, sorry".

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.760
It's absurd the way we do things, absurd, absolutely absurd.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.760
Marriage is not so important that way.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.600
Not so important. But this ego comes back

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.480
and, "I have decided and now I have not",

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.760
and then this and — all nonsense it is.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:15.000
So with that idea that once you are married you are married forever.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.720
Take a decision properly.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.440
So I bless all of you -

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.320
all the brides and the bridegrooms. But I think there are more

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.760
bridegrooms than the brides.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.560
YOGI: Yes, that's true, Mother.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.240
So I'll have to find out some brides.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.760
YOGI: A couple of them - two of them particularly have asked

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.400
if they can marry Indian ladies at some point

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.520
Not necessarily this time, Mother.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.240
There's one from Australia… two from Australia.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.200
Good idea.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.720
YOGI: They'd like to marry Maharashtrian girls.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.880
The one that was .. you were

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.760
telling about, he's about 39 or something.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.080
YOGI: Yes, he's… he's one of them. And…

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:52.160
For him I found a girl but she's not yet been divorced, you see.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.280
She's not yet been divorced.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.640
So, any other questions you have,

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.280
please ask Me before we start the puja.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.880
Good idea.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.880
Any other question?

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.960
If you have really some question, ask,

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:22.120
otherwise we have to finish the puja fast and we have to go away.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.960
YOGINI: Perhaps some of us don't know who the men are

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.840
who are taking care of our tickets for Delhi

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.880
I'm not familiar with them, I don't know the people,

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.040
is there someone I can ask to be introduced to, so we know

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:44.280
to see about our tickets for Delhi, I don't know their names.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.440
I have to go to America to really understand what did you say.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.520
What did she say?

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.720
YOGI: About the tickets Shri Mataji - tell her to see Warren.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.560
Warren, you should see Warren. All right.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.880
Brian. Brian and Warren. All right.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.920
Now I have forgotten again American English. I'm sorry.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.920
In America I understand and I forget it, you see.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.080
English has so many versions.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.200
Australian English is different… Every English is different,

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.080
So sorry I've forgotten the American English.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.280
I'll get to it very soon.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.880
All right, done.

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.240
Now…

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.320
Only people from Vaitarna. Come along those who have not done puja

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.080
Only they will have the chance, all right?

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:55.240
Only people from Vaitarna and from Bhatsa or from Chhapur.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
First of all Ganesha Stuti.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.880
Do you know the meaning of it? YOGI: Yes, I do.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.640
You just tell them the meaning.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.080
That is the the Nabhi Chakra.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.240
There's a knot between Nabhi Chakra and Swadisthan Chakra,

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.640
that's the first knot. That is to be broken,

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.920
otherwise the Kundalini doesn't rise out of it,

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:50.960
this is Raja Yoga

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.240
This is so called Raja Yoga which works out inside you.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.320
The Mother breaks all that and brings up the Kundalini.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.160
the Kundalini bringing the devotion

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.760
Devotion comes only from heart, clean heart.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.800
Devotion is not what you are showing off or anything,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
devotion is within your heart.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.040
Because she is the support of everything,

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.640
that's the absolute point.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:09.320
The absolute point does not mean the another absolute.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.080
Pataka means the sins.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.520
Because… that's why people ask you

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.880
that we have to do cleansing, this thing, that thing,

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.200
but there's somebody who's a destroyer of sins.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.960
You don't have to worry anything like that,

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.160
that person can destroy all your sins.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Who cannot be compared.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.280
Who has ocean of compassion.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.400
The one who cannot be thought of, who cannot be understood.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:11.520
All the rakshas - Chanda, Munda, all of them.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.320
Mahatye  - Mahatye

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.160
Of great importance.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.600
Auspicious work.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.640
Shubhakari - whatever she works out,

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.280
She makes it auspicious. She creates auspiciousness.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.280
Paramanu. Paramanu means the…

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:34.280
what you call the atom or the smallest molecule- beyond the molecule

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.760
Paramanu. In Sanskrit language means

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.440
"parama" then "anu".

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:46.080
Parama means the last one or the smallest.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.280
Atom, anu is atom.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.080
Kshipra?

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:01.880
Kshipra… kshipra means auspiciousness.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:06.160
The one who is the giver of auspiciousness.

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:11.520
It's actually the Brahman.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.880
Kshipra is the one who is Brahmani who gets yoga.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.160
It is the blessing of the yoga.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.240
Kshipra is the Brahmani

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.880
She is the giver of yoga.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.720
She is the one who bestows yoga and Moksha on her devotees

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.600
through Her grace.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.520
Through Her grace you achieve your Moksha

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:58.280
Kshipra is the grace that bestows the bliss of Moksha.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:01.240
The grace.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.480
YOGI: Om Shri Pushtiye namaha Salutations to Her

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:28.720
Who is well healthily nourished. Shri Mataji: By bhoots.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:50.920
Samachitta — balanced - balanced attention.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.000
Generous, is the one who is generous.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.400
Swa-dha — swa is yourself, dha is established.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.440
So, established in herself. Swa dha

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.680
Enjoyment. Vilasini.

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.760
We have one more — Mahayoga Dayini.

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:46.520
En masse yoga. See, en masse.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.880
Kuteti?

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:59.280
Kilaka.

01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:53.880
Now, those who want to take a photograph

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:57.280
please, come now.

02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:45.400
They enjoyed the puja.

02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:10.640
Now you better take it -  it is your property.

02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:15.280
Warren you can get into the car and then we can go.
