1
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:10,460
“First of all, put your attention
to your heart and to your Spirit”

2
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:22,458
(...) God does look after all of us.

3
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,445
He is compassion, He is love,
He has created us,

4
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:29,020
He has made a beautiful
human being out of us,

5
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:31,105
within us He has placed
all these centres,

6
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:34,450
He has placed the Kundalini within us,
and the Kundalini has to rise,

7
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:38,754
you have to get realization,
all that is so, no doubt.

8
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:43,653
All this has to work out. That’s also
the truth is.

9
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:50,184
But still, one must know that He is not
in your hand,

10
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:53,256
you are in His hand.

11
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:58,087
There are many people who pray to God:
“Give me promotion.

12
00:00:58,288 --> 00:01:01,683
O God, you have to give me promotion”.

13
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:06,720
And then if He doesn’t give, “This God
is not helpful to me!

14
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:12,383
Why has He not given me promotion?” 
You should not cheapen God like that.

15
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:17,656
God is the one Who is Almighty,
Who has created all this Universe.

16
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:22,464
He has created you, and He has created
you for a purpose.

17
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:28,661
And that purpose is something Supreme.
That’s not ordinary purpose,

18
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:33,167
the way you think Him to be, He is not
an ordinary person.

19
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:37,163
He is Supreme and He will give you
something that is Supreme.

20
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:44,910
Supposing you go to see some king,
he will not give you 1p, will he?

21
00:01:46,134 --> 00:01:49,025
He may give you a diamond.

22
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:56,507
But if you want to ask anything from God
then you must ask for the Supreme!

23
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:03,508
And what is the Supreme? The Supreme
is to know Him.

24
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:08,829
Unless and until you know your Self,
you are not going to know Him.

25
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:15,338
He has placed within you that instrument
by which you first know your Self.

26
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,757
Once you know your Self, through your Self
you know Him.

27
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:26,945
But the first important thing is that
your attention has to be on Him.

28
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:31,794
There’s a very different thing to have
attention on God

29
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:34,639
and to have a blind faith in God.

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,271
These two things are absolutely
far apart.

31
00:02:40,472 --> 00:02:44,073
To have faith in God means – I’ve already
told you

32
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:48,847
all the silly things we do in the name
of faith.

33
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:53,440
But to have your attention on God is

34
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:58,304
to ask: “When am I going to be my Self?

35
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:04,040
When are You going to accept me
as a citizen of Your Kingdom?

36
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:07,934
When are You going to use me 
as Your instrument, O Lord?”

37
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:11,624
This should be your attention. 
If your attention is like that,

38
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:16,277
and if you are really of pure nature
about it,

39
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:19,411
it will work out, it works out.

40
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:22,139
This is the only thing that is needed
in Sahaja Yoga,

41
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,059
is a clean heart to ask for it,
to desire for it.

42
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,284
(...) But today, we have to understand
one thing:

43
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:36,948
that the essences within us – for example
innocence – is absolutely pure.

44
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:43,172
Within us it is absolutely pure. In its own
form it is absolutely pure.

45
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:49,787
But, when it is reflected through
our medium, it gets soiled.

46
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:54,594
The way you are, the way you express it,
it gets spoiled.

47
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:59,829
If you are a cunning person, the innocence
cannot be manifested,

48
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,648
it cannot be manifested. Your innocence,
whatever God has placed within you

49
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:09,329
is completely darkened because you
cannot reflect it back.

50
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,993
There is no manifestation about it.
Why it happens?

51
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:21,092
If you are pure, if you are all right,
the innocence is all right,

52
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:24,376
then why it is not manifested through you?

53
00:04:24,577 --> 00:04:28,774
Why this cunningness can stop that
innocence or any other essences

54
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:33,578
that are within you, which you know
which exist on different chakras?

55
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:40,101
We must think about it, why it happens.
That even after realization,

56
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:44,245
we cannot properly manifest our innocence,

57
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:49,610
our primordial powers

58
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:52,990
which are within us in absolute
purest form.

59
00:04:53,191 --> 00:05:00,252
Why? What happens within us?
The trouble is with our attention.

60
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,210
When you became human beings,
you were given full freedom

61
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:08,413
to put your attention onto anything
you wanted.

62
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:15,351
Say, if you want, you can put your
attention onto any subject.

63
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:19,584
Say I receive a telephone call.
So I put my attention to it.

64
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:22,188
Now, I can go on identifying with it,
thinking about it;

65
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,333
all my attention will be enveloped
and I will not pay attention

66
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:29,261
to anything else that is happening.

67
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:33,946
The attention is so mobile, it has no base

68
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:38,371
as if the whole thing, like a jelly,
goes and gets attached to a thing.

69
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:42,356
(...) I mean if you waste your attention
on foolish nonsensical things,

70
00:05:42,557 --> 00:05:45,685
what’s going to happen?

71
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:49,094
So this is how we put our attention

72
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:56,575
onto absolutely useless things; sometimes
onto very depraved things also.

73
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:59,276
We may put our attention to anything

74
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:07,488
that we think “requires our attention”.
But do you have your self-esteem?

75
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:12,206
If you have, then where should be
your attention?

76
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:17,779
It should be on your Self. Where is
your Self now?

77
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:25,604
It is God Almighty. Is a part of that
Great Primordial Being.

78
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:30,838
Your attention should be on That.

79
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,343
After realization, your attention
should be in your heart,

80
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:42,467
on your Spirit, which is the part
of God Almighty.

81
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:49,808
If your attention is on your Spirit, you’ll 
be amazed, how your attention will act.

82
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,903
You see, like a jelly which is attached
to a point.

83
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:56,044
It may little bit get disturbed, again
it will settle down.

84
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:58,619
Again, it will get little bit disturbed,
it will settle down.

85
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,628
It will not hang on to any point,
and will not bother you.

86
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,239
So to put all your essences properly,
first of all,

87
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,142
put your attention to your heart
and to your Spirit,

88
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:16,905
because that’s your absolute point
which you have discovered.

89
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:19,321
But it doesn’t happen with many people.

90
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:24,809
The trouble is, when Kundalini rises,
She gives two kinds of experiences.

91
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,721
One is called as Shambhavi, another
called as Shakti.

92
00:07:28,922 --> 00:07:36,308
Shambhavi is the feeling of the Shambhu, is
the Shiva in the heart, means God Almighty.

93
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:39,038
But the other is Shakti.

94
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:44,102
Now with western people it is the other,
because you know your problems.

95
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:50,697
You have used your powers for all kinds 
of ramblings in your mental efforts.

96
00:07:50,898 --> 00:07:53,698
Everything [Everyone] will sit down.
“All right, let us discuss realization!”

97
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:57,038
What are you going to discuss?

98
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:01,651
What are you going to discuss
about realization?

99
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:05,708
Did you get your realization by discussion?

100
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:10,750
You have to meditate! You have to go
within yourselves.

101
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:14,005
See your growth, work out within!

102
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:16,578
You cannot talk about it, you cannot
discuss it,

103
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,915
you cannot argue about it – it is within!

104
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:24,600
Because of these ramblings, we go up
to the shakti point.

105
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:27,529
But Shambhu’s we do not reach.

106
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,845
But in the East where people are
not that much intelligent,

107
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:36,513
that well-educated and sophisticated,
I would say -

108
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:42,865
simple people, it goes just there.
And they just enjoy.

109
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:45,493
If you show them any book, written
about Sahaja Yoga –

110
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:47,559
for example Gregoire’s book - they’ll say,

111
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,856
“Mother, we don’t want it, to read,
we don’t understand this”.

112
00:08:52,057 --> 00:08:54,268
They are just there! They are now there. 
What is there now?

113
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:57,911
It’s flowing through our body, everything
we know it’s there.

114
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:02,136
Why should we bother about these things
and all the controversies and dogmas,

115
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:05,537
and what all the Churches have told you,
and why they have failed

116
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:10,267
and why this religion has failed?
Who is bothered?!

117
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,223
So these problems come up.

118
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:18,841
Because their attention has been
on the Spirit alone.

119
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:23,695
Simple people have that capacity.

120
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,300
So now forgetting everything else,
all your intelligence,

121
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:32,706
all your books and education and all
that you have had – forget it.

122
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:35,649
And just put your attention to your heart,

123
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,874
where lies the connection with
God Almighty.

124
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:43,473
If your attention is there,

125
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:49,720
you will be surprised that your attention
will be stabilised.

126
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:56,996
Not only that it will be stabilised,
but the source of joy is that

127
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,868
and you will start feeling that joy.

128
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:04,332
(...) But if you want to co-operate
and help yourself,

129
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:08,154
then you have to put your attention
in such a way

130
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:14,583
that – every problem comes in – you go
to your heart, not to your brain.

131
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:17,084
Any question comes in, go to your heart.

132
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:22,233
There resides the blessings of God. And you 
will be surprised how it will be solved.

133
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:25,027
That’s why I said “Go into thoughtless
awareness.”

134
00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:29,953
That is the quality of heart, because 
heart doesn’t think.

135
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:36,984
You go to your heart, means you put
your attention to your Spirit.

136
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:39,660
(...) You Sahaja Yogis have to be people

137
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:47,088
of higher outward manifestation. 
Inside you are,

138
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:51,231
but outward manifestation has to be higher.

139
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:57,945
You have to be humbler people, kinder
people, sweeter people,

140
00:10:58,146 --> 00:11:02,462
loving people, compassionate, understanding

141
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:11,125
that you were there, where they are today;
joyous people and cheerful people.

142
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:14,081
Otherwise nobody is going to believe
what is happening

143
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,810
in the Kundalini inside, because whatever
is happening

144
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:20,133
is happening, you cannot see that.

145
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:23,632
It is important that it should be evident
on your face,

146
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:28,871
in your behaviour, in everything. For that
you have to understand

147
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:35,638
that you have to stabilise your attention
at the lotus feet of God.

148
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,244
This is called as ‘Sharanagati’ –
surrendering.

149
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:45,901
By surrendering, by worshipping,
by bhakti, by singing songs,

150
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:52,566
by absolutely settling yourself
at the lotus feet of God Almighty.

151
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:55,264
That’s the only way you are going
to achieve it.

152
00:11:55,465 --> 00:12:00,735
After realization only, you have the entry
into the Kingdom of God.

153
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:03,671
Before that, whatever you try
has no meaning.

154
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:08,406
Muslims do all the Namaz, morning till
evening – do not get anything!

155
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:10,532
But we had some Muslims, you know that.

156
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,215
Once he started after realization, he said,

157
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,028
“Every time I bend I get vibrations.
Every time I say

158
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:20,028
Allah’s name I get vibration.” It has 
happened with all of them.

159
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:26,710
Because God exists, He is there,
it’s a fact.

160
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:31,926
And the time has come for all of us
to feel Him and know Him.

161
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:36,403
(...) Please put your attention 
to your heart.

162
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,424
(...) Yogini: Mother, when you said
‘Put your attention on your heart’

163
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:45,457
do you mean the heart chakra? ”
Shri Mataji: You cannot feel heart.

164
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:47,824
You cannot know heart chakra, nothing!

165
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:51,961
When I say that, just say that,
‘I’m putting My attention to My Spirit’,

166
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:55,424
that’s all. Your saying is a mantra itself.

167
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,282
You know now you are a realised soul.

168
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:02,343
You are an enlightened person,
your desire is enlightened.

169
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:08,137
And if you just say that ‘My attention
is on my Spirit in my heart,

170
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:11,738
in the organ of heart…’

171
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:22,205
You see now, whatever you say
has a meaning.

172
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:28,066
Do you understand? Whatever you say
is enlightened now, there’s a light in it.

173
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:31,539
Only thing is, if your attention is not
all right still,

174
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:39,134
then the light is still dim. If in the dim
light, you see half things, but you do see.

175
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:42,903
But if it is a bright light you can see it
very clearly.

176
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:49,779
So to brighten up the light, you just say 
that, “Let me be in my heart.”

177
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,929
It works out, settles down, you see?

178
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,631
As if you order your attention to be there.

179
00:13:56,832 --> 00:14:00,560
It just goes like a, like a sweet little
baby, you see.

180
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:03,459
Sits down there, “All right, Mother,
whatever you say.”

181
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,038
Just say like that. Just try to feel
your powers.

182
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:11,238
What you say, how it works out.

183
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:16,801
Even when you say mantras, these mantras are also enlightened.
