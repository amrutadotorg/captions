15:57.520 --> 16:01.040
سلام برهمه جستجو گران  حقیقت

16:06.680 --> 16:13.480
دیروز برای شما گفتم حقیقت هر چه است هست

16:14.200 --> 16:19.960
شما نمیتوانید انرا تصور یا تخیل نمائید

16:20.160 --> 16:25.520
و نمیتوانید انرا با حافظه و هشیاری انسانی بدانید

16:39.840 --> 16:43.200
ما بایستی یک انسان بخصوص بشویم

16:46.360 --> 16:48.720
ما باید روح بشویم

16:52.560 --> 17:00.200
فقط ما زمانیکه روح بشویم میتوانی تمامی حقیقت را درک کنیم. که

17:01.400 --> 17:13.360
تمامی مخلوقات خدائی  تحت محبت بخصوص
خداییی خلق و نگهداری میشوند

17:34.960 --> 17:46.280
برای این موجود بخصوص شدن در بدنمان مکانیکی است
که راجع بان دیروز صحبت کردم

17:58.440 --> 18:09.720
امروز من میخواهم برای شما در مورد نیروئی بگویم.
که ان در باره روح و دریافت روح بما کمگ میکند.

18:22.240 --> 18:28.320
این نیرو در لگن خاصره یعنی در استخوان سه گوشه
مقدس مستقر شده است.

18:28.880 --> 18:34.200
Diese Kraft ruht im Kreuzbein, in dem Knochen, der Sacrum genannt wird

18:34.840 --> 18:42.320
ان نیروی انعکاس روح القدس در ماست

18:42.920 --> 18:49.200
und ist die Reflexion des Heiligen Geistes,

18:56.320 --> 19:02.680
همجنین روح انعکاس خدای بزرگ در قلبمان است

19:04.000 --> 19:11.400
während der Spirit die Reflexion des Allmächtigen Gottes in unserem Herzen ist.

19:14.200 --> 19:26.520
روح  فقط  ان است مارا  نظارت میکند

19:38.600 --> 19:41.400
ن قسمت از نیروی خدائی که ارزو و خواست  اوست

19:45.280 --> 19:47.840
که ارزو و خواست  اوست

19:50.400 --> 19:52.560
ان روح القدس است

19:54.800 --> 19:56.840
که روح القدس مادر اولیه همه موجودات است

19:59.080 --> 20:08.680
در نوشته ها در باره پدر که خداست و پسر خدا
نوشته شده ولی در باره مادر چیزی گفته نشده است

20:17.680 --> 20:21.560
چگونه ممکن است که پدر و پسر داشته باشیم بدون مادر؟

20:26.640 --> 20:33.960
نمیدانم  انها بچه علتی منگر شده اند در باره مادر اولیه صحبت کنند

20:41.240 --> 20:52.160
در تمامی نوشته ها بخشی است  که  اتینا ( خدای یونانی) نامند

20:59.480 --> 21:02.360
تا درزبان  سانسکریت بمعنی مادر اولیه است

21:07.680 --> 21:12.280
ولی با وجود اینکه انها خیلی در موردمادر حضرت عیسی نگفته اند که او خداست.

21:12.480 --> 21:21.760
مردم بخودی خود احساس کرده اند که در پشت پرده خدائی است
که اورا مادونا نامیده اند

21:29.920 --> 21:34.120
با این که مادونا  در انجیل نام برده نشده است

21:40.320 --> 21:48.480
انعکاس این مادر اولیه  و ابراز  روح القدس در هر انسان را گندالینی نامن

21:54.520 --> 22:02.320
که این گندالینی مادر انفرادی ماست

22:08.600 --> 22:11.960
او هر چیز و همه چیز راجع بما را میداند

22:15.120 --> 22:20.560
خیلی ها گویند بیداری گندالینی ممکن است درناک باشد

22:32.640 --> 22:42.880
چطوری ممکن است که گندالینی درد اور باشد. زمانیکه ان مادرمان است

22:52.560 --> 23:00.200
وقتی که ما متولد شدیم مادرمان همه زحمات زایمان را بر خود هموار کرده

23:07.160 --> 23:09.240
او برایمان ناراحتی ببار نیاورده است

23:11.880 --> 23:24.200
بهمان منوال اگر گندالینی فعال شود بدون هر گونه ناراحتی بشما تولد دوباره میدهد

23:35.480 --> 23:49.880
بایستی بدانیم که که این مادر زمین هچیچ دردی را در دانه ببار نمیاورد در هنگامی که  دانه جوانه میزند

23:50.280 --> 23:55.520
بهمان طریق گندالینی در هنکام فعال شدن ناراحتی ببار نخواهد اورد

24:09.560 --> 24:17.560
گفتم که روح انعکاس خدای متعال در همگی ما میباشد

24:25.200 --> 24:31.200
گفته شده است  که ما فقط یک خدا داریم پس در همهمان  روح از یک منبع است

24:36.600 --> 24:43.360
از ان بابت است که ما بطور دسته جمعی  هوشیار و اگاه میشویم زمانیکه ما روح بشویم

24:51.440 --> 24:56.520
در هر کس روح در قلبش انعکاس یافته است

25:02.200 --> 25:09.480
زمانیکه این باد خنک روح القدس را احساس کردید همانطور یکه دیروزانرا احساس کردید

25:10.600 --> 25:17.720
انکه شما احساس میکنید ان همان قدرت نافذ خواست خدای متعال است

25:30.560 --> 25:34.920
با دریافت روح همزمان ما اگاهی دستجمعی را دریافت کرده که

25:40.840 --> 25:45.240
با ان دانش شما میتوانید شخص دیگر را در نوک انگشتانتان احساس نماید

25:51.320 --> 25:57.640
در قران حضرت محمد فرمود: زمان معاد دست شما صحبت خواهد کرد

26:05.520 --> 26:08.760
این همان روز رستاخیز و دادگاه  عدل الاهی است که بما پیام داده شده است

26:17.000 --> 26:19.520
And you have to judge yourself.

26:23.680 --> 26:27.960
The other day in Holland one person asked Me,

26:28.160 --> 26:30.640
“Mother, how is it that

26:30.840 --> 26:34.800
some people will be saved and some will not be?"

26:43.840 --> 26:46.680
I said, “It is destiny."

26:48.960 --> 26:56.160
Maybe those who are here have done such righteous things

26:56.360 --> 27:01.320
in previous lives and in this life that they are here.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.640
It depends, I don’t know how.

27:14.920 --> 27:23.000
In Russia for example, I have to always book a big stadium.

27:32.560 --> 27:35.520
For example there is a place called Togliatti

27:35.880 --> 27:40.520
and this gentleman Togliatti was actually Italian.

27:46.800 --> 27:53.000
And he revolted against the Christian church and went to Russia.

27:58.440 --> 28:04.920
And there he started a big factory for making motorcars.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.480
Now there are 40.000 Sahaja Yogis.

28:18.880 --> 28:22.600
I’ve not been there as yet.

28:27.880 --> 28:32.880
And on My birthday they had a holiday for the whole city.

28:37.800 --> 28:42.280
I can’t understand why in some places

28:42.480 --> 28:45.040
it works tremendously in a big way,

28:45.240 --> 28:48.440
many people come to Sahaja Yoga

28:48.640 --> 28:52.000
and in some places there are very few people.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.720
As I told you, when this Kundalini rises

29:09.920 --> 29:14.200
then you improve physically.

29:21.800 --> 29:25.880
Now, I must say many diseases have been cured

29:26.120 --> 29:30.080
as a by-product of Kundalini-awakening.

29:38.960 --> 29:45.760
We have three Indian doctors who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga

29:45.960 --> 29:50.120
for curing incurable diseases.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.880
And there are seven doctors in England

30:02.080 --> 30:04.800
who are recording all those who have been cured.

30:11.960 --> 30:17.040
But in Moscow there are 40 doctors who are practizing Sahaja Yoga.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.200
Because for this you don’t need a hospital, you don't need money,

30:26.400 --> 30:29.120
you don’t need anything.

30:35.440 --> 30:38.080
It is your own power that works.

30:41.560 --> 30:45.000
And once you are properly established,

30:45.240 --> 30:48.480
then you don’t have to worry about your health at all.

30:57.640 --> 31:02.480
It also helps for mentally retarded people, mentally sick people.

31:10.320 --> 31:17.360
Because this Kundalini, when She rises She is also a redeemer.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.600
She nourishes the centers.

31:28.520 --> 31:33.240
By that nourishment the centers get cured

31:38.680 --> 31:43.120
and ultimately She integrates all these centers.

31:49.960 --> 31:55.080
The Spirit, when it shines in your attention,

31:55.280 --> 31:59.120
then your attention becomes enlightened.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.840
Means if you can pay attention to anyone

32:12.160 --> 32:16.320
and try to feel what centers are in problem in that person,

32:16.520 --> 32:18.560
you can immediately feel it.

32:26.960 --> 32:32.840
There are many criminals from India who came to west countries

32:33.040 --> 32:41.280
wearing these orange dresses and became false masters.

32:49.760 --> 32:54.480
Some of them also knew how to mesmerize very well

32:59.800 --> 33:05.600
and they have lynched people because main interest was money.

33:09.400 --> 33:14.480
Of course there are also other so-called masters

33:14.680 --> 33:16.800
in other countries also,

33:25.720 --> 33:29.600
even a person like Freud.

33:32.400 --> 33:37.320
He was anti-Christ, you can see it clearly.

33:43.200 --> 33:48.400
Because Christ had said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,”

33:48.600 --> 33:55.360
such a subtle description of purity.

34:01.320 --> 34:05.160
Such a subtle description of puritiy.

34:09.520 --> 34:15.240
But on the other hand this Mister Freud

34:15.480 --> 34:20.280
has made everyone into nothing but a sex point.

34:27.320 --> 34:31.640
And the people have lost understanding

34:31.840 --> 34:35.800
that these are the human weaknesses.

34:44.840 --> 34:50.760
To such an extent they have been misled that they say

34:51.040 --> 34:57.320
that you can ascend in your spirituality through sex.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.040
This is absurd!

35:15.800 --> 35:20.080
On the contrary, in the Christian dogmas

35:20.280 --> 35:24.520
people believe that you should abhor sex.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.880
This is both are absolutely absurd.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.600
One has to have a sane attitude.

35:48.320 --> 35:53.680
If you see it clearly, the lowest center which we call as Mooladhara

35:53.880 --> 35:56.720
is placed below the Kundalini.

36:06.200 --> 36:14.880
Now this center looks after our excretion, including sex.

36:25.640 --> 36:30.440
So your ascent has nothing to do with sex.

36:36.640 --> 36:40.040
On the contrary, when your Kundalini starts awakening

36:40.240 --> 36:42.880
you become innocent like a child.

36:49.680 --> 36:52.880
And that is what Christ has said, that

36:53.080 --> 36:57.760
you have to become like children to enter into the Kingdom of God.

37:06.240 --> 37:10.560
So it is Sahaja Yoga which really explains Christ

37:10.760 --> 37:14.440
and practizes Christianity.

37:22.800 --> 37:26.200
Moreover, the breaking of the Sahasrara,

37:26.440 --> 37:30.440
which is what we call is the fontanel bone area,

37:30.640 --> 37:34.280
is actualization of the baptism.

37:43.560 --> 37:47.800
You may follow any religion, Hindu, Christian, Muslim, any religion,

37:48.000 --> 37:52.440
you can do any sin, you can commit any sin, there is no restriction.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.040
There is no restricition from within.

38:06.040 --> 38:10.280
But once you become a sahaja yogi, I don’t have to tell you anything.

38:17.320 --> 38:20.080
You just become righteous.

38:22.760 --> 38:26.080
I don’t have to tell you Ten Commandments,

38:26.560 --> 38:29.360
you just do it yourself.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.640
You become your own master

38:40.480 --> 38:42.600
and you guide yourself.

38:48.240 --> 38:53.200
And you know the absolute truth.

38:56.760 --> 39:01.880
You can get ten children who are realized souls and tie their eyes

39:02.080 --> 39:06.880
and put one person in front of those children

39:16.280 --> 39:19.320
and ask them, “What’s wrong with this gentleman?”

39:24.440 --> 39:27.760
and they will put up the same finger.

39:31.120 --> 39:35.240
And you ask him, “Is something wrong with his throat?”

39:39.000 --> 39:42.760
And he says, “Yes, but how do you know?”

39:49.760 --> 39:53.040
Because this finger indicates the throat.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.880
So, these false gurus who have come here,

40:01.120 --> 40:05.800
the falsehood that they have taught – you can feel it.

40:14.280 --> 40:18.680
You can feel if they are crooks, if they are false,

40:18.880 --> 40:21.360
if they are deceiving you.

40:27.040 --> 40:31.080
First of all you should know that you cannot pay for your ascent,

40:37.880 --> 40:41.160
because it is an evolutionary process,

40:46.840 --> 40:51.280
which is living process,

40:53.400 --> 40:55.400
for which you cannot pay.

40:57.800 --> 41:01.360
And then you enter into the Kingdom of God.

41:05.280 --> 41:08.680
And then you become joy.

41:12.680 --> 41:15.320
Not the wrong type of joy,

41:15.520 --> 41:19.320
but joy that elevates you,

41:19.520 --> 41:23.320
sublimates you.

41:27.760 --> 41:37.000
Joy does not have happiness and unhappiness like two sides of a coin.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.320
That means joy is absolute,

41:50.120 --> 41:52.880
but pleasures are not.

41:55.320 --> 42:00.080
When you indulge into any pleasure it has a reaction,

42:04.440 --> 42:06.840
it has a repercussion,

42:09.280 --> 42:12.640
but joy is absolute.

42:18.600 --> 42:26.400
So, yesterday all of you who were here, most of you felt the Spirit

42:34.840 --> 42:37.840
because you could feel the cool breeze.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.640
So the growth has started

42:46.280 --> 42:51.200
and hardly you’ll take a month to master it.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.880
But you have to work it out

43:03.640 --> 43:08.760
because the connection has to be all right.

43:12.800 --> 43:17.000
Maybe there are some problems within the being

43:17.200 --> 43:19.440
which need to be corrected

43:25.800 --> 43:27.880
So it would be very nice

43:28.160 --> 43:32.160
if you people attend their follow-on and meet them

43:41.240 --> 43:44.440
But the whole thing works in collectivity.

43:48.080 --> 43:53.560
See, at the time of Buddha they had to do all kind of penances,

43:53.760 --> 43:58.240
cleansing, absolute renunciations.

44:03.280 --> 44:06.560
Still they could not achieve their Self-Realization.

44:11.200 --> 44:14.080
Buddha also had to suffer a lot

44:15.800 --> 44:17.800
in His cleansing.

44:19.440 --> 44:22.600
But in Sahaja Yoga it is the collectivity

44:22.800 --> 44:25.200
which cleanses you automatically.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Corrects you, yes.

44:35.200 --> 44:40.400
Now supposing there’s something wrong with this left hand

44:45.040 --> 44:49.560
so the right hand immediately helps it,

44:53.080 --> 44:54.840
automatically,

44:57.200 --> 45:01.000
because they are part and parcel of one body.

45:05.520 --> 45:10.200
In Sahaja Yoga you have become part and parcel of the whole.

45:14.240 --> 45:18.080
The microcosm has become the macrocosm.

45:21.520 --> 45:26.760
So now you can only grow when you are with that body.

45:32.840 --> 45:38.040
Supposing My nail is cut from My body – it won’t grow.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.640
In the beginning you will find little difficult

45:48.840 --> 45:50.600
to adjust to collectivity

45:50.800 --> 45:55.440
you may find that it’s not very congenial for you, maybe.

46:01.960 --> 46:06.160
Not with everyone, but some people do fuss about it.

46:12.280 --> 46:14.520
And the door of Sahaja Yoga is open to everyone,

46:14.720 --> 46:17.880
sometimes we also get mad people in Sahaja Yoga.

46:23.400 --> 46:26.360
Then you start thinking, “How this mad man is here?”

46:26.560 --> 46:28.880
and all that, you start criticizing.

46:36.320 --> 46:41.600
But if you take to introspection, then it will be excellent for you

46:48.880 --> 46:51.480
and not to worry about others,

46:53.640 --> 46:55.640
you will grow much faster.

46:58.360 --> 47:01.600
For you are the seed, you are the Mother Earth

47:01.800 --> 47:04.880
and you are the gardener.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.800
And you are the love that is water.

47:18.520 --> 47:21.760
So as it is, I’ve told you, all you have Divinity,

47:21.960 --> 47:26.400
only thing you have to feel and grow into it.

47:34.880 --> 47:39.840
Yesterday nobody asked Me any questions, it was such a good sign

47:40.040 --> 47:43.280
that you all want your Realization, that’s all.

47:51.600 --> 47:56.040
Then I told you that asking questions is just a mental acrobats.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.240
Now, I can answer all your questions,

48:08.600 --> 48:13.280
but – that is no guarantee for Self-Realization.

48:18.000 --> 48:24.440
Only thing, you must have the pure desire,

48:28.120 --> 48:31.120
pure desire to be the Spirit.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.600
Then it works,

48:37.560 --> 48:42.120
because the Kundalini is the power of pure desire.

48:50.720 --> 48:57.400
As you know all other desires are in general not satiable.

49:05.160 --> 49:11.000
This is the only desire which gives you real satisfaction.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.880
Thank you very much!

49:26.440 --> 49:30.400
So, are you going to ask Me any question today?

50:04.840 --> 50:05.520
What's it?

50:05.720 --> 50:08.960
He wants to know about the appearance of Holy Mary,

50:09.160 --> 50:12.320
for example in Fatima or in other places.

50:12.520 --> 50:16.800
Might have, it’s quite possible, you see one of My photographs,

50:17.000 --> 50:21.240
where people are taking photographs – and She’s there,

50:21.440 --> 50:25.240
She’s appeared before Me also, it’s possible.

50:25.440 --> 50:28.280
You must see some of My photographs,

50:28.480 --> 50:31.160
it’s interesting how these apparitions come in.

50:31.360 --> 50:33.800
All right? It’s possible.

50:46.640 --> 50:50.880
But unfortunately She’s described as just a woman in the Bible,

50:51.080 --> 50:53.280
I mean there’s no respect for Her.

50:58.640 --> 51:03.160
Must be Paul who must have done it, because he was just an organizer

51:03.360 --> 51:08.720
and I think he wanted to use Christianity as a platform for himself.

51:19.800 --> 51:22.960
And he had nothing to do with Christ, you see on the contrary

51:23.160 --> 51:27.760
he killed one of the disciples of Christ, Steven, he killed him.

51:34.880 --> 51:38.240
He must have thought it’s a very good way of getting a platform

51:38.440 --> 51:40.840
so he must have jumped on the platform.

51:47.400 --> 51:50.080
Or might be to make some money.

51:52.160 --> 51:55.320
We, too,  get sometimes such people in Sahaja Yoga.

51:59.120 --> 52:02.040
What to do?

52:03.640 --> 52:06.600
But he was not a realized soul, nothing of that kind.

52:12.720 --> 52:15.800
Sahaja Yoga will explain everything,

52:20.400 --> 52:24.400
the relationship of Christ with others.

52:27.600 --> 52:33.280
Christ has said, “Those who are not against Me are with Me.”

52:39.000 --> 52:41.040
Who are those?

52:42.400 --> 52:45.960
Actually Christ was there till eight years of age,

52:46.160 --> 52:50.640
and then He went to India. For twenty years He was there.

52:59.840 --> 53:03.640
When He came back He lived only for three and a half years.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.560
And they crucified Him.

53:11.960 --> 53:16.440
I mean, whatever He has done is tremendous in three and a half years.

53:20.640 --> 53:26.720
He just used ordinary fishermen and did such a lot of preaching

53:30.680 --> 53:37.560
about truth, very forcingly He talked about truth, courageously.

53:42.960 --> 53:46.120
But three and a half years is nothing!

53:49.200 --> 53:53.360
In England I was struggling with seven hippies for four years,

53:53.560 --> 53:57.800
I had to give them Realization, struggling for four years!

54:04.960 --> 54:08.040
They had no background at all

54:12.280 --> 54:19.680
And they are now, I feel, they were following Freud, not Christ.

54:23.880 --> 54:26.640
It was such a shock to see.

54:46.200 --> 54:47.720
All right,

54:48.000 --> 54:53.080
so it will take us ten, fifteen minutes for us to get to that state.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.800
I have to just request you to take out your shoes,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.360
to take the help of the Mother Earth.

55:31.440 --> 55:42.480
One thing I have to tell you, that Self-Realization cannot be forced.

55:50.760 --> 55:56.080
You have to ask for it in your own glory of freedom,

56:01.280 --> 56:06.480
because ultimately you have to achieve the complete freedom,

56:06.680 --> 56:09.920
complete mastery of yourself,

56:17.840 --> 56:22.080
where no addiction,

56:22.280 --> 56:25.040
no habits,

56:25.240 --> 56:30.360
no false gurus, nobody can dominate you.

56:41.520 --> 56:47.320
So those who do not want to have their Self-Realization should please leave.

56:55.560 --> 56:58.520
Come and sit, there are chairs here, come and sit here.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.640
No use standing, please be seated.

57:08.240 --> 57:11.880
All of you should be seated will be good idea.

57:15.560 --> 57:20.080
You shouldn’t stand and watch others, it is not civil.

57:58.520 --> 58:06.480
Now, please try to understand what you have to do,

58:07.440 --> 58:10.560
and we’ll show you that,

58:10.760 --> 58:13.880
after that you have to close your eyes.

58:26.480 --> 58:31.800
There are two powers within us, left one the power of desire

58:32.000 --> 58:36.080
and the right one the power of action.

58:46.240 --> 58:50.720
So we put our left hand like this on our lap, very comfortably.

58:55.760 --> 58:59.520
You should not sit with a slouch or a stretch on your body,

58:59.720 --> 59:03.840
but just a straight comfortable pose.

59:12.240 --> 59:16.760
Those who are sitting on the ground are perfectly all right,

59:16.960 --> 59:19.720
they should just take out their shoes.

59:26.360 --> 59:28.720
Those who are sitting on the chair

59:28.960 --> 59:32.840
both the feet away from each other.

59:40.120 --> 59:43.200
So we use the left hand

59:43.400 --> 59:48.760
to express that we desire to have Self-Realization.

59:56.560 --> 01:00:04.440
And we use the right hand to nourish our centers.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:16.760
So first we put our right hand on our heart

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:26.560
because in the heart resides the Spirit.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.800
Please put it on your heart. You don't understand?

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:49.360
Now, here resides the Spirit.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:59.880
Now, you take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.640
where is the center of your mastery.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.040
When you are the Spirit, you are your master.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.280
So now, please take your right hand

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:31.160
in the lower portion of your abdomen -

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.960
everything on the left side -

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.800
because this is the center of pure knowledge.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.600
Then we raise our right hand again

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.440
on the upper portion of our abdomen.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:06.520
Then we take our right hand on the heart.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.240
Then we take our hand in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:22.280
and we turn our head to our right.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.960
This center is spoiled when we feel guilty

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:38.720
and as a result we get horrible diseases like angina.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.120
So please don’t feel guilty!

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.520
Then we take our right hand on our forehead across,

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.520
forehead across like this, and put down your head,

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.000
as far as possible.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.400
Why don’t you do it? Please.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:25.440
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:36.000
Now please take back your right hand on the back side of your head

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.080
and push back your head.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.040
This is the center where - without feeling guilty,

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.280
without counting your mistakes -

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.120
you have to ask for forgiveness from the all-pervading divine power.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.520
Now stretch your palm fully

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.400
and put the center of your palm on top of your head

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.520
and now press it hard.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.040
Push back your fingers and put down your head.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.720
Now move your scalp slowly seven times – scalp!

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.200
That’s all we have to do.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.280
But there are three conditions.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.080
The first one is

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:29.840
that you have to be absolutely self-confident about yourself

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.560
that you will get your Self-Realization.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:47.600
Whether you have come late or earlier, makes no difference.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:58.000
The second one is to forget your past at this point,

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.960
you have to be in the present

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:20.800
so that you do not feel guilty.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.600
After all you are a human being, you are not God.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.000
If you have done any mistakes – it’s all right.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.800
This Divine power is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:51.480
And whatever mistakes you commited,

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:55.680
it can be dissolved by the power.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.360
That means you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:11.320
and you should have respect for yourself
because you are a human being,

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:23.320
because you are the epitome of evolution.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.880
Only thing, the last breakthrough has to take place.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.400
So don’t feel guilty at all at this moment.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.400
The third condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.720
As I told you yesterday, wether

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.360
you forgive or don’t forgive - you don’t do anything.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.680
That is just mental.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:19.120
And if you do not forgive others,

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:23.320
you play into wrong hands unnecessarily.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.520
And you torture yourself

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.880
while the one who has troubled you is very happy.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.920
Just say, “I forgive everyone in general”

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.720
and you’ll feel immediately lighter in you head.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.160
These are the only three conditions.

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.320
Now please close your eyes

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.720
and please do not open them till I tell you.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.840
So put the right hand on your heart

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.480
and left hand towards Me like this

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.680
and both the feet apart from each other.

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:51.440
Now, here is the center of your Spirit.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.400
Please close your eyes and ask Me a fundamental question,

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.240
you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like,

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:38.480
Here you ask Me a fundamental question three times in your heart,

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.560
"“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:02.400
If you are the Spirit you are your guide.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.640
So now please take your hand

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.560
on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.400
and press it hard.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.640
Here you have to ask another question to Me,

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.280
“Mother, am I my own master?”

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.520
Three times.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.520
I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.320
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you,

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.760
which does all the Divine work.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.040
So please put your right hand

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.560
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:25.520
And here you have to ask six times,

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.640
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.480
Six times.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.160
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.320
the Kundalini starts moving upward,

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:21.360
so we have to nourish the upper centers

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.080
with our full self-confidence.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.080
So now please raise your right hand

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.240
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.400
and here, with full confidence, say ten times,

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:53.720
“Mother, I am my own master!”

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:47.280
I’ve already told you that you are the pure Spirit.

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.480
You are not this body, you are not this mind,

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.160
you are not this ego, this conditioning,

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.080
but you are the pure Spirit.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.360
So now please raise your right hand on your heart.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.600
Here you have to say

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.240
with full confidence in yourself twelve times,

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:44.600
“Mother, I am the Spirit!”

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:12.040
This all-pervading power is the ocean of love and compassion,

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:19.360
it is the ocean of absolute knowledge,

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.760
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.280
So whatever mistake you might have committed,

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:54.040
it can easily dissolve all of it.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:08.720
So now, here you raise your right hand

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.600
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.640
and turn your head to your right.

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:30.320
And here you have to say with full confidence sixteen times,

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:35.520
“Mother, I am not guilty at all!”

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.160
I’ve already told you whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.120
you don’t do anything.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.760
This center is so constricted

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:18.760
that, please, you have to forgive everyone in general.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:28.880
If you don’t forgive you may not get your Realization.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.680
So now please, raise your right hand on your forehead across

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.680
and put down your head fully.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.160
Here you have to say with full confidence

01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:00.840
you have to just say, don’t say it is difficult,

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:07.120
“Mother, I forgive everyone!”

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:34.040
You have to say it from your heart, not how many times.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.360
Now take back your right hand on the backside of your head

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:04.320
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.440
Here you have to say,

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.840
without feeling guilty,

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.840
without counting mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:34.520
“Mother, if I have done any mistakes, or all-pervading power,

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:38.720
if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.840
“All-pervading power,” you should say.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.400
Now please stretch your hand, stretch your palm,

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.720
and put the center of your palm

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.520
just on top of the fontanel bone area,

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:28.880
and put down your head and press it hard by pushing out your fingers.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:46.240
Here again I cannot cross over your freedom,

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:59.920
so you have to ask for your Self-Realization.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.040
Now please put down your head,

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.720
push back your fingers nicely,

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.520
and move your scalp seven times slowly, saying,

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:23.560
“Mother, please give me my Self-Realization.”

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:39.000
Please put down your head, please put down your head,

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.320
If you don’t bend, it won’t work out.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.560
Please move your scalp seven times,

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.440
saying, “Mother, please give me Self-Realization.” (Shri Mataji bläst ins Mikro).

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.880
Please take down your hands, please open your eyes.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:09.360
Now please put both your hands like this.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:19.880
Now bend your head and see for yourself,

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.000
if there is a Cool Breeze coming out of your head or hot breeze,

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:27.240
if you have not forgiven it will be hot breeze.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.400
But please don’t put your hand on top of your head,

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.800
little away and see for yourself.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.080
Now please put your left hand and see for yourself

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.320
with your right hand.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:20.760
If it is hot air that means you have to forgive.

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.400
Now put the right hand again please

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:44.120
and see with the left hand.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.320
Now put both your hands towards the sky

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:03.320
and ask anyone of these questions,

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:07.600
“Mother, is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.520
Mother, is this the All-pervading power of God’s Love?

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.360
Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya?”

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:18.200
Anyone of these you can ask three times – questions.

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:47.040
Now please take down your hands.

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:53.320
Put your hands like this towards Me.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.000
Watch Me without thinking.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:18.120
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:23.080
out of their head or on their hands or fingertips,

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.800
please raise both your hands.

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:51.240
I bow to all of you, you’re the saints.

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.440
I know some people did not feel it,

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.720
very few,

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.880
doesn’t matter.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.160
Those who want to meet Me are welcome,

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:52.920
but the Sahaja Yogis should not come.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:22.840
Those who have not felt should come on this side

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.480
and sahaja yogis will work on them.
