00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:09.609
It is said that today is Mahaveer Jayanti, a very auspicious day.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:17.688
Shri Mahavira resides on our Ida nadi and rules it.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.059
And all the good or bad conditionings that are within us,

00:00:23.247 --> 00:00:25.949
are corrected by Him.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.909
And he has described about Hell, what hell is.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.912
What happens when humans go to Hell,

00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:38.081
and how they suffer.

00:00:38.908 --> 00:00:44.596
and he has explained this in detail.

00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:51.349
Buddha and Mahavira, both lived at the same time,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:59.534
and both of them had a life of penance.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.929
Both of them were princes.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:11.452
And through their great penance and meditation,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.550
they understood that when humans make mistakes,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.700
and go to the left side, then how they suffer in Hell.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.941
Hell can be experienced in this world itself now.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.620
Even before death, man can experience it.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.325
If he is very sinful

00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:45.177
and keeps on committing sins,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.219
and does not even try to avoid it,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.298
and does not even realise that it is wrong.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.410
So in these modern times, such people,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.949
will be themselves destroyed from inside.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.689
No external force is required for this (destruction).

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.270
Because, they become so foolish,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.369
that they themselves arrange to destroy themselves.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.020
Some of them think they are quite perfect

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.650
and nobody can harm them.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.130
All of them will be destroyed in "Satyayuga".

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.989
Not only that,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.450
but those who will not rise above the human awareness,

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.600
I wonder, how many of them will be able to live in this world.

00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:44.819
Because so many demonic forces have now become active,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.179
and they attract humans in such a way,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.209
that they get caught in it,

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.899
and it becomes very difficult to escape from it.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.189
Sahaja Yoga is the only way through which you can escape this swamp,

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.449
and lead yourself to a higher level.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.009
You can also pull along many others with you,

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.129
and save their lives.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.463
Whatever Mahavir ji explained,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.730
I don’t know how many Jains understand it.

00:03:22.283 --> 00:03:24.836
And they have made a mockery out of him.

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:30.151
They added things He never said and made a mockery out of it.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:40.690
This has happened with all the great incarnations.

00:03:41.694 --> 00:03:46.239
So, if people have done the same with Shri Mahavira,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.939
then what can be said, who can be blamed?

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.910
In Sahaja Yoga, we respect Mahavir ji very much,

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.519
and we know that He is the incarnation of Shri Bhairavanath.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.530
Not only this, He took birth many times

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.763
and later came as Hussain,

00:04:14.964 --> 00:04:18.716
among Hassan and Hussain (sons of Shri Fatima).

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.405
In the Bible,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.299
Bhairavanath is addressed as Saint-George by some

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.923
and Saint-Michael by some others.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.620
It is very surprising that London, which we believe is the Heart,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.110
has Saint-George as its angel,

00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:49.079
which means that they also follow Bhairavanath - which is correct.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.440
Because, if Shri Shiva resides in the Heart,

00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:54.549
then presence of Bhairavanath is important there.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.580
There are so many things which if we read with understanding,

00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:03.352
then we find them all interrelated,

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:10.224
and their relationship somehow got established on its own.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.799
In the power of Sahaja, you all get overwhelmed,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.199
and you enjoy it -  this is a big thing for Me.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.103
In this world, everyone should live happily and joyfully.

00:05:23.304 --> 00:05:26.499
God has created this universe for you

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.358
so you should enjoy it. what else do you want?

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.919
Within you, there are so many powers,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.687
and you are using them

00:05:38.883 --> 00:05:42.659
and you also share this joy with others.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.219
In this way, our Sahaj family should grow very much.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.039
And we should save as many as possible.!

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.732
Especially, we should put attention on our children,

00:05:54.933 --> 00:06:00.239
because an immoral culture has started these days,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.770
and the children are getting affected.

00:06:02.971 --> 00:06:06.310
So, we should pay attention to them and take care of them.

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:10.957
If they are established in Sahaja, they will not get lost.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.887
In Delhi’s environment, Sahaja Yoga has established nicely.

00:06:19.088 --> 00:06:20.760
It is a very nice thing.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.579
I think, Sahaja Yoga is especially needed in Delhi the most,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.027
because here it is all the politics and governance.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.871
Slowly, through you, the Param Chaitanya will get activated.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.670
I am sure that by the time I come next year,

00:06:45.871 --> 00:06:50.090
many people would have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.779
There is one thing, I feel so many Sahaja Yogis are there,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.515
so many of Sahaja Yogis,

00:07:01.716 --> 00:07:05.149
that I don’t even know them by face.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.140
In a way, I can easily figure out by their face,

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.509
but I don't know by who is who?

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.559
So you all should make a photo album for Me.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.179
And through the album you can send Me one photo of each.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.530
I usually have the habit of seeing albums in the morning.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.759
People from many countries have come here, some from Maharashtra too.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.169
I have arranged an album for you here,

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.555
so, please give a photo with name

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:39.119
and when you took your Realization.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.801
It will be very good.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.523
Everybody can do that.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.471
All are insisting, that next year also Birthday should be celebrated here.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:56.439
But, it should not be celebrated in such a big way. It is too much.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:02.010
Celebration should be even bigger than this, Shri Mataji.

00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:12.848
Many miracles happened during the celebration!

00:08:13.049 --> 00:08:17.385
It was very nice and many other nice things happened.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.440
I have been thinking

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.189
that how our progress in Art should be.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.439
I have given copies of that to Yogi Mahajan Ji.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.649
What we have achieved in Maharashtra we can do it here also.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.739
So that we develop creativity,

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:40.840
and our artistic state becomes better,

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:45.339
like theatre and many other things, I have written it all.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.279
It is need that we should work in multiple fields.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.439
Sahaja Yoga is not just for you, it is meant for the whole world.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.679
It is not just for the sake of spirituality,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.970
but to establish spirituality into this world.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.020
Like Kabir Das has said “Mann mamata aye”.

00:09:01.221 --> 00:09:04.269
It means: "I will mix the left side into the five elements" -

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.699
meaning on the right side.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.518
The five elements are on the right side,

00:09:07.719 --> 00:09:09.450
and "mann mamata" (emotions) are on the left.

00:09:09.651 --> 00:09:10.981
So the meaning is mixing left with the right side.

00:09:11.182 --> 00:09:17.460
So, all our feelings and our art we will mix into the five elements.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:22.385
So all the art

00:09:23.338 --> 00:09:27.015
and the creative power of our mind,

00:09:27.436 --> 00:09:29.316
our creativity,

00:09:29.517 --> 00:09:34.967
we should try every possible way to express it, to manifest it.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.640
This will be a very special achievement.

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:41.469
When Sahaja Yogis do anything, there is special meaning to it.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.909
In other words all the big artists of the world were Realised souls

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.577
If they were not Realised souls,

00:09:47.778 --> 00:09:49.630
their art would have not prospered till date.

00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:52.475
Any art which was not created by a Realised soul

00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:54.841
has been destroyed, finished

00:09:55.042 --> 00:09:58.204
and nobody has any respect for it.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.484
So, there is no field

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.669
in which we cannot enter.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:14.690
In any direction, whatever you like to do,

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.442
in your respective field of interest

00:10:17.643 --> 00:10:21.740
you all should think: "How can I bring spirituality in it?".

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.789
And it is very important to bring spirituality into it,

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.850
because, spirituality is not limited just to you all.

00:10:30.051 --> 00:10:34.205
So, in this modern era,

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.119
spirituality is not confined to a single saint

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.046
nor to a single group,

00:10:39.258 --> 00:10:41.069
but to the whole world.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.519
So, we should see this form of spirituality everywhere.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.435
And I hope that after sometime,

00:10:48.636 --> 00:10:52.640
we'll find that the way we live, the way we talk,

00:10:52.841 --> 00:10:57.761
every aspect of life is influenced by Sahaja.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.599
When this influence gets established within us,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.359
then people recognize that it is a special thing.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.749
When Sahaj gets established within, many things change.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.999
You see how miracles happen and everything happens.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.814
We should not limit just to us but make it happen everywhere.

00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:24.130
You have to show it to others in every possible dimension.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.140
And this is very easily possible.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.040
You can see they are themselves making the music, composing it.

00:11:31.241 --> 00:11:33.610
And if you take this to the villages,

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.490
like say today bhajans are going to happen

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.377
people will come and you can sing in front of them.

00:11:39.578 --> 00:11:42.280
There is no other better way of spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.461
In Maharashtra, all the spiritual spreading is via music.

00:11:47.104 --> 00:11:52.669
So, like this, if you give some time every Sunday, morning or evening,

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.139
take a group of people to villages,

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.499
sing bhajans, perform plays

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:03.260
and this way people will understand who are we,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.136
and what we are doing.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.359
In this aspect, the foreign yogis have prepared very nice plays

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.920
and have also played very nice music.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.297
Especially they have started liking Indian music very much,

00:12:18.498 --> 00:12:20.328
and their interest in their music decreased.

00:12:20.529 --> 00:12:24.939
They make very high standard Indian Music.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.665
Very high class.

00:12:26.866 --> 00:12:31.559
So, we should also prepare such a high standard of music

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.759
that we can show it to the public.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.946
Gradually you will see that

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.540
your creativity will show it's full effect.

00:12:45.741 --> 00:12:52.118
And then, these people who are preparing plays are normal people.

00:12:52.319 --> 00:12:57.101
But we are Sahaja yogis, we have within us many powers,

00:12:57.302 --> 00:13:03.513
with which we can explain to people, show and introduce spirituality.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:10.985
So, today I am saying this, that this left side

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:17.299
reveals the feelings of music and art.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.279
Even though Saraswati has created all the Swaras [notes],

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.070
but the emotions it contains, the bhakti it contains,

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.238
is due to the blessings of Mahavir Ji.

00:13:31.439 --> 00:13:34.179
Mahavir has really worked hard for this

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.040
because he scared people

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.309
that if they go on the wrong path, they will go to hell,

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:47.396
and on taking this correct path, they will be overwhelmed.

00:13:47.597 --> 00:13:50.440
And you all are actually witnessing it!

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.749
Like this, we all should increase our bhakti

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.830
and increasing bhakti in us is the work of Shri Mahavira.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:03.140
I am happy that on this day of Mahavira Jayanti all this has happened,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.400
and you all are doing the job of Mahavira Ji.
