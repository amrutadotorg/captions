Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella (Italy), 30 August 1992.

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:33.796
Last time you had asked Me for Gurupada,

00:00:34.796 --> 00:00:42.853
and you should know that the essence of Guru

00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:46.636
is Shri Ganesha, the innocence.

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:53.916
You must be knowing the story of a very devoted wife,

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:58.236
faithful wife, of a sati.

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:02.676
Her name was Anasuya,

00:01:03.036 --> 00:01:09.076
and she was so religious

00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:12.836
and so dedicated

00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:17.396
that they say that the wives of all the gods,

00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:24.236
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, got very jealous of her.

00:01:25.163 --> 00:01:31.203
So they told their husbands that "You must go and test her,

00:01:31.476 --> 00:01:37.516
if she's really a woman with chastity or not."

00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:41.756
So all of them came down as sadhus,

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:45.716
dressed up like sanyasis.

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:51.556
And she said she wanted to serve them,

00:01:51.836 --> 00:01:54.556
give them something. They said, "No, we want to have food."

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:57.956
She said, "All right, come and sit down."

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:01.436
She cooked food for them.

00:02:02.436 --> 00:02:04.396
So they said, "No, we will not have the food

00:02:04.556 --> 00:02:07.956
unless and until you take out all your clothes.

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:12.356
We'll only have the food if you take out all your clothes."

00:02:12.996 --> 00:02:15.756
She said, "Is it so?" She said, "Yes."

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:20.396
So she made them into little, little children, three little children,

00:02:21.236 --> 00:02:23.676
and then she became nude,

00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:27.716
because innocent doesn't understand anything about it.

00:02:28.316 --> 00:02:31.116
And then she joined them together,

00:02:31.436 --> 00:02:35.556
their three innocences were joined together

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:44.636
and they got their Gurupada.

00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:49.636
That's how the Adi Guru was created.

00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:55.916
So the first thing is that if you want your Gurupad,

00:02:56.116 --> 00:02:58.756
you have to be innocent.

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:04.076
"Innocent" is a very vague term, very vague,

00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:11.956
and difficult to really understand what is innocent.

00:03:12.716 --> 00:03:15.636
But what is the nature of innocence?

00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:21.396
That we can understand from Shri Ganesha's innocence.

00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:22.436
First of all

00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:29.676
He's endowed with wisdom,

00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:36.516
and He puts wisdom into us.

00:03:37.556 --> 00:03:44.556
It's a nice thing now in modern times we have discovered genetics,

00:03:45.556 --> 00:03:52.036
and genetics determine our behavior and our races.

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:59.156
It is He who puts genetics in us.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:07.116
He selects and puts it within us, our genetics,

00:04:08.116 --> 00:04:11.236
and when He puts wisdom in us,

00:04:11.516 --> 00:04:16.076
then we are wise.

00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:22.636
There is definitely a genetic of wisdom

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:27.556
which is lacking, as we can see very clearly, in many races.

00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:29.356
They have no wisdom.

00:04:29.676 --> 00:04:33.036
They do things without wisdom.

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:38.556
They do things just for their destruction, destroying their society.

00:04:38.916 --> 00:04:42.196
They may call themselves the highest society, highest races,

00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:44.636
whatever it is - you may brand yourself with anything;

00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:47.116
but you can see from their behavior they're,

00:04:47.356 --> 00:04:51.036
that they have no wisdom at all.

00:04:53.156 --> 00:04:58.356
So He's the one who puts that wisdom in us.

00:04:59.196 --> 00:05:01.396
In some people who are not yet evolved,

00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:04.436
certain races are not yet evolved to that extent,

00:05:04.796 --> 00:05:08.036
this wisdom is lacking.

00:05:08.836 --> 00:05:11.196
Apart from that,

00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:17.796
this wisdom gives us the sense of freedom.

00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:26.196
So we keep aloof from all kinds of intoxicant,

00:05:27.156 --> 00:05:30.396
all kinds of bad habits.

00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:34.836
We don't like to look at nudity.

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:41.356
It can never become lifestyle of people who have wisdom - never.

00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:48.636
We don't indulge into extramarital nonsense.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:56.116
Whatever is absolutely in the center, which is dharmic, we accept.

00:05:56.836 --> 00:06:02.476
So we can see that the seed of wisdom put into us

00:06:02.836 --> 00:06:07.636
makes us dharmic people when we grow, automatically.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:11.396
We are automatically dharmic.

00:06:11.756 --> 00:06:13.556
We don't kill others,

00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:15.676
we don't aggress others,

00:06:15.996 --> 00:06:17.956
we don't torture others.

00:06:18.236 --> 00:06:23.436
We do not occupy anybody else's land or house

00:06:23.636 --> 00:06:27.276
or take away anything,

00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:31.716
another's property or another's things.

00:06:32.116 --> 00:06:37.116
This wisdom comes to you through Shri Ganesh.

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:44.396
In short, He makes you absolutely ready for Self-Realization.

00:06:45.236 --> 00:06:48.756
It is He only ultimately

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:50.836
who looks after us

00:06:51.076 --> 00:06:55.756
at the time of our nirvana, at the time of our realization,

00:06:56.396 --> 00:06:59.236
because

00:06:59.516 --> 00:07:04.436
He stops all other activities of excretion

00:07:04.916 --> 00:07:11.836
when you are ascending into new realm.

00:07:13.076 --> 00:07:17.036
You have seen, I'm sitting here for nine hours, ten hours.

00:07:17.316 --> 00:07:19.876
Once I sat down for eighteen hours together,

00:07:20.076 --> 00:07:23.556
didn't go at all, even to bathroom.

00:07:24.036 --> 00:07:29.196
Because it is He who stops all these activities -

00:07:29.476 --> 00:07:33.316
even when kundalini is rising, it stops.

00:07:34.276 --> 00:07:37.796
So this wisdom is innate,

00:07:38.236 --> 00:07:42.196
just happens that when the kundalini is rising

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:46.916
He becomes, manifesting in us -

00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:51.716
I mean, I should say, He makes us like a child.

00:07:52.396 --> 00:07:56.436
And that's what Christ has said, that you have to be like children

00:07:56.676 --> 00:08:00.716
if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:08:01.076 --> 00:08:03.636
You become the child,

00:08:03.876 --> 00:08:06.436
at that time you become a child.

00:08:06.756 --> 00:08:08.676
And with the kundalini rising,

00:08:08.876 --> 00:08:12.396
that wisdom then comes into your brain,

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:15.645
because He's sitting on the kundalini itself.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.876
He's the power in the kundalini.

00:08:19.356 --> 00:08:21.916
He gives wisdom in the brain.

00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:27.276
Once you get that wisdom, you drop out all bad habits,

00:08:27.796 --> 00:08:31.876
all your attachments which are wrong,

00:08:32.156 --> 00:08:37.876
all adharmic things that you do, everything drops out.

00:08:38.796 --> 00:08:41.396
He changes, your genetics are changed.

00:08:41.676 --> 00:08:45.316
The genetics of Sahaja Yogis are, all of them will be the same,

00:08:45.556 --> 00:08:47.876
about the same I would say,

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:54.316
and the genetics of other people would be different.

00:08:54.796 --> 00:08:57.516
Maybe Indians might have closer to it,

00:08:57.836 --> 00:09:00.836
because Indians normally are very wise people.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.588
They won't -- I mean, I would say, if you see

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.796
the superiority of races from wisdom point of view,

00:09:06.996 --> 00:09:08.476
Indians are very wise.

00:09:08.716 --> 00:09:12.196
They won't just do some nonsensical things at all, no question.

00:09:12.436 --> 00:09:15.676
Even the children I have seen, children from the West

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:18.316
when they go to India: they went for this school,

00:09:18.437 --> 00:09:21.314
they are doing all kinds of destructive things to themselves --

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:23.115
nobody could understand.

00:09:23.236 --> 00:09:25.916
Once they jumped into a dirty pond.

00:09:26.236 --> 00:09:27.556
They got malaria.

00:09:27.836 --> 00:09:31.836
Then they ran out of the house, of the school

00:09:32.156 --> 00:09:36.876
and came out and went to the roads, went to the shops.

00:09:37.316 --> 00:09:38.756
So they put a gate.

00:09:38.996 --> 00:09:41.916
When they put the gate the newspaper is criticizing us,

00:09:42.196 --> 00:09:45.116
there's no sense in it, every school has a gate.

00:09:45.556 --> 00:09:51.676
So these all unwise, stupid things they do because they lack wisdom.

00:09:52.116 --> 00:09:54.436
A child who has wisdom is extremely cautious,

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:56.716
he understands the importance of his life.

00:09:57.036 --> 00:09:59.836
He respects his parents, he respects everything

00:10:00.196 --> 00:10:03.556
- automatically, you don't have to tell them.

00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:09.436
Automatically they know what is dharma is, you don't have to tell them.

00:10:09.916 --> 00:10:16.196
That wisdom, this great deity of Ganesha,

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:19.996
He took His form as Jesus Christ.

00:10:20.396 --> 00:10:27.436
And you all accepted Him as the Lord, which is true also.

00:10:28.716 --> 00:10:33.636
But because your Ganesh Principle was not

00:10:33.956 --> 00:10:37.276
so much developed in these Western countries,

00:10:37.556 --> 00:10:40.956
people took to stupid things.

00:10:41.436 --> 00:10:46.476
This pornography and this kind of a interest in nude women shows

00:10:46.676 --> 00:10:50.996
that there is no wisdom in them, there is no Ganesha in them.

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:54.436
Though they follow Christ, it's just a lipservice going to the church.

00:10:54.636 --> 00:10:57.388
I don't know if the church also has any Ganesha in them,

00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:59.236
they have no Ganesha.

00:10:59.476 --> 00:11:01.676
The way they lead their life, nobody can say

00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:05.116
they have any sense of holiness and auspiciousness.

00:11:05.396 --> 00:11:09.556
As soon as you get wisdom, you understand holiness and auspiciousness.

00:11:09.796 --> 00:11:12.196
Before that you just call "holy father",

00:11:12.396 --> 00:11:14.516
and holy father is doing all kinds of things

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:18.996
which can create holes in the organization;

00:11:19.636 --> 00:11:24.876
who takes money, bribes, creates bombs, have women,

00:11:25.076 --> 00:11:29.676
I mean everything -- how can he be holy?

00:11:31.636 --> 00:11:34.236
So this wisdom part is so important,

00:11:34.436 --> 00:11:36.626
and that's what we should ask

00:11:36.747 --> 00:11:38.996
Ganesha, to make us like children.

00:11:39.196 --> 00:11:44.756
Children have basically wisdom, but not all the children.

00:11:44.956 --> 00:11:46.116
This is the thing is,

00:11:46.356 --> 00:11:50.236
that children in which Shri Ganesha has activated,

00:11:50.516 --> 00:11:55.276
has put this genetic of wisdom, it is there.

00:11:57.076 --> 00:12:00.796
This is one of the greatest things we have to think about:

00:12:00.996 --> 00:12:06.076
is it wise, it is sane? It's not to be logically -

00:12:06.276 --> 00:12:09.276
logically if you believe in something then you can go wrong,

00:12:09.476 --> 00:12:12.115
because there's no strength from within.

00:12:12.236 --> 00:12:15.755
But innately if it becomes that, you won't do it at any cost.

00:12:15.876 --> 00:12:17.675
Now you know yourself,

00:12:17.796 --> 00:12:20.195
all the Sahaja yogis are so different:

00:12:20.316 --> 00:12:22.476
they behave differently, they stand differently,

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:25.310
they talk differently, they think differently, they

00:12:25.431 --> 00:12:26.916
- everything is different.

00:12:27.116 --> 00:12:30.796
Suddenly he has become, they have become like that.

00:12:31.676 --> 00:12:35.836
And you can't understand, how is it we have become like this?

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.276
They were drinking, they were smoking, drug-taking,

00:12:39.476 --> 00:12:40.636
everything they did.

00:12:40.876 --> 00:12:43.516
But how is it suddenly you changed?

00:12:43.716 --> 00:12:48.636
Because Shri Ganesha has put this wisdom in you.

00:12:50.556 --> 00:12:54.276
Now if you see His character, it's very interesting to watch.

00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:59.316
He's a child, and He's entirely dedicated to His Mother.

00:12:59.556 --> 00:13:05.116
He doesn't know any other god, anything else -- complete dedication.

00:13:06.476 --> 00:13:08.076
But is it so with us?

00:13:08.276 --> 00:13:12.876
There also sometimes I find some of the Sahaja Yogis are lacking.

00:13:13.476 --> 00:13:17.916
They lack sincerity, loyalties.

00:13:18.156 --> 00:13:21.436
And I'm shocked sometimes at the periphery they are like that;

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:25.116
that means they have to ascend still.

00:13:25.996 --> 00:13:27.876
People who have worked with Me,

00:13:28.076 --> 00:13:30.516
I have always tried to pay them sufficiently.

00:13:30.716 --> 00:13:32.316
There's no need to pay,

00:13:32.516 --> 00:13:35.636
because after all I have done so much for your building,

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:37.636
your body, why should I pay you?

00:13:37.836 --> 00:13:39.556
But I always pay sumptuously,

00:13:39.796 --> 00:13:41.436
I look after them, give them ...

00:13:41.636 --> 00:13:45.556
My, My loyalties to you and love cannot be challenged.

00:13:45.836 --> 00:13:49.436
But I find them, them being very selfish sometimes,

00:13:49.676 --> 00:13:50.996
extremely selfish.

00:13:51.196 --> 00:13:55.116
They'll do half the work and run away, sometimes they are ....

00:13:55.356 --> 00:14:00.036
their problems, their own problems are much more important.

00:14:00.676 --> 00:14:05.916
Or they just try to find some excuse.

00:14:07.076 --> 00:14:09.396
So many Sahaja Yogis are also like that.

00:14:09.676 --> 00:14:11.236
They are not sincere.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.916
Sahaja Yoga has given them so much.

00:14:14.116 --> 00:14:17.556
We have to always find out, are we sincere to Sahaja Yoga?

00:14:17.956 --> 00:14:20.316
What are we doing for Sahaja Yoga?

00:14:20.556 --> 00:14:23.796
What have we achieved and what are we doing?

00:14:24.076 --> 00:14:27.556
On the contrary, they become liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:32.276
Ganesha is never a liability on His Mother.

00:14:38.276 --> 00:14:43.836
For example, someone becomes sick.

00:14:44.156 --> 00:14:47.556
All right, Sahaja Yoga can help you -

00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:51.396
may be, may not be; may be cured, may not be cured.

00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:54.556
If they are not cured then they will say that "See now,

00:14:54.756 --> 00:14:57.716
I was not cured. I'm going to leave Sahaja Yoga."

00:14:57.916 --> 00:15:01.436
Then one has to say, "Please leave."

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:05.716
With the slightest thing they go off, not understanding

00:15:05.956 --> 00:15:09.396
what is important.

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:13.836
Then they are liabilities, like somebody gets married,

00:15:14.076 --> 00:15:16.436
comes here, "I don't like this wife." Now do what you like,

00:15:16.636 --> 00:15:20.796
the wife sits on My head, and the husband also.

00:15:21.356 --> 00:15:23.316
All kinds of liabilities come in,

00:15:23.556 --> 00:15:27.076
"My husband doesn't do Sahaja Yoga, what should I do?"

00:15:27.316 --> 00:15:30.036
You solve the problem with your husband.

00:15:30.236 --> 00:15:32.316
You solve the problem with your children.

00:15:32.556 --> 00:15:36.236
You have the power to do it; have patience, work it out.

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:39.556
They'll put us into cases, this, that.

00:15:39.836 --> 00:15:42.236
It is only Sahaja Yogis who can harm Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:42.436 --> 00:15:43.556
can you believe that?

00:15:43.756 --> 00:15:45.716
Nobody else can touch it.

00:15:45.916 --> 00:15:48.196
Unless and until a Sahaja Yogi misbehaves,

00:15:48.396 --> 00:15:50.716
nobody can touch Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:50.996 --> 00:15:53.036
So we have many cases like that.

00:15:53.236 --> 00:15:54.796
I mean, they have seen My photographs,

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:56.756
they have seen miraculous photographs,

00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:00.196
they have had realization, everything happened to them,

00:16:00.396 --> 00:16:02.956
they have been so many times helped.

00:16:03.156 --> 00:16:06.516
But suddenly they say, "I want to leave Sahaja Yoga."

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.236
"Very good," I say,

00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:11.956
"those who have to leave should leave immediately."

00:16:12.156 --> 00:16:17.116
As it is there's very little space left in the Heaven,

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:21.916
and no place for such half-hearted people.

00:16:22.156 --> 00:16:24.316
If they have to leave, they should leave.

00:16:24.556 --> 00:16:28.556
You have to have Ganesha as your ideal.

00:16:28.836 --> 00:16:31.423
It should not be that "I worship Ganesha."

00:16:31.637 --> 00:16:33.594
That way you were worshipping Christ,

00:16:33.715 --> 00:16:35.715
you were worshipping this, worshipping that.

00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:39.196
But what has come inside you, is the point.

00:16:39.436 --> 00:16:43.116
Have you got Shri Ganesha within you?

00:16:43.636 --> 00:16:49.196
Are you following Shri Ganesha with the same devotion, dedication?

00:16:49.556 --> 00:16:54.556
If you ... But you are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

00:16:55.076 --> 00:16:59.876
Shri Ganesha was made with immaculate conception.

00:17:00.516 --> 00:17:03.756
You are also made the same way.

00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:07.996
Your kundalini was raised, was given you the realization

00:17:08.196 --> 00:17:11.516
and you got your second birth, and now you are Sahaja yogis.

00:17:11.716 --> 00:17:15.116
All these things have happened to you

00:17:15.316 --> 00:17:19.436
without having a father.

00:17:21.996 --> 00:17:24.196
If I had not told you that you have a Father,

00:17:24.396 --> 00:17:27.556
you would never have known.

00:17:29.796 --> 00:17:31.356
Like, other gurus, you see,

00:17:31.556 --> 00:17:35.636
they don't want to give credit to anyone.

00:17:36.916 --> 00:17:38.556
So this actually has happened with you,

00:17:38.756 --> 00:17:43.795
you are being made in the same manner as Shri Ganesh.

00:17:43.916 --> 00:17:46.515
Of course you must be having something, you know,

00:17:46.636 --> 00:17:49.196
otherwise I could not have made -- that's also true.

00:17:49.476 --> 00:17:54.756
Supposing the kundalini was missing, now what could I have done?

00:17:55.436 --> 00:17:59.756
If not missing, if it was absolutely crooked;

00:18:00.036 --> 00:18:00.916
if not crooked,

00:18:01.116 --> 00:18:05.156
supposing there were some chakras which were horribly damaged.

00:18:05.396 --> 00:18:11.836
So, you were also people just ready to have your realization,

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:14.116
that you were seeking it truly,

00:18:14.436 --> 00:18:20.356
that you had the pure desire to become Sahaja Yogis, no doubt.

00:18:20.796 --> 00:18:24.156
Still, when the growth is taking place,

00:18:24.476 --> 00:18:26.356
you must watch,

00:18:26.556 --> 00:18:31.156
you must see how much sincerity we are giving,

00:18:31.396 --> 00:18:37.356
with what dedication we are working out?

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:40.236
Now, we have people

00:18:40.556 --> 00:18:44.036
who must have gone for postering somewhere, some places

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:46.036
- not now, it's long time back -

00:18:46.276 --> 00:18:49.796
so they charged Me for their coffee also.

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:53.196
I said, "All right." Thank God they were not smoking,

00:18:53.396 --> 00:18:57.156
otherwise they would have charged Me!

00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:04.236
So from that level, now we are very much changed,

00:19:04.676 --> 00:19:07.236
and some of them have become perfect Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:07.516 --> 00:19:10.716
But still we have people on the periphery,

00:19:11.036 --> 00:19:13.276
and they get nervous at the smallest thing.

00:19:13.516 --> 00:19:17.036
Yesterday there was a storm - has to be a storm.

00:19:17.316 --> 00:19:17.956
You don't know,

00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:23.916
when Christ was carrying His disciples there was a very big storm,

00:19:24.556 --> 00:19:26.356
and then He stopped it.

00:19:26.676 --> 00:19:28.876
Yesterday when you started singing the songs,

00:19:29.076 --> 00:19:30.796
then only the storm stopped,

00:19:31.116 --> 00:19:34.716
just to prove that these songs have such power.

00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:36.635
If such things don't happen,

00:19:36.756 --> 00:19:39.684
how will you know that these songs have the power?

00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:42.881
You think you are just singing just because you are singing.

00:19:43.002 --> 00:19:45.333
No, it has a power, these are mantras, these are

00:19:45.454 --> 00:19:47.785
all awakened songs.

00:19:47.906 --> 00:19:51.436
And then it stopped.

00:19:52.863 --> 00:19:54.836
They were saying, "Should we say mantras?" I said,

00:19:55.036 --> 00:19:57.515
"No, nothing." I didn't say things, what you have to do.

00:19:57.636 --> 00:20:00.236
Suddenly they thought of singing,

00:20:00.436 --> 00:20:02.356
and then it worked out.

00:20:02.716 --> 00:20:05.276
Because every time if I have to suggest,

00:20:05.476 --> 00:20:08.916
then when will you use your power?

00:20:09.196 --> 00:20:10.756
All such incidents take place,

00:20:10.956 --> 00:20:13.276
now it was Shri Ganesha's special trick.

00:20:13.397 --> 00:20:14.898
He's the real judge for you.

00:20:15.019 --> 00:20:17.636
You must know because you have seen in Sistine Chapel,

00:20:17.796 --> 00:20:21.436
He is standing there and moving you left and right.

00:20:21.796 --> 00:20:24.516
So there is a testing point also.

00:20:24.716 --> 00:20:27.756
In Sahaja Yoga the door is open, this way.

00:20:28.036 --> 00:20:30.436
But there's a bigger door on the back side

00:20:30.676 --> 00:20:33.516
to throw out people.

00:20:38.316 --> 00:20:42.516
And the judgment is not done by Me so much as by this Ganesha.

00:20:42.756 --> 00:20:46.996
He judges you, and then you are thrown out.

00:20:47.436 --> 00:20:50.156
Then to come back is very difficult.

00:20:50.436 --> 00:20:54.156
Even if you come back you are suspicious of yourself,

00:20:54.396 --> 00:20:56.636
and others are also suspicious of you.

00:20:56.956 --> 00:21:00.236
So you see, what you have to understand

00:21:00.436 --> 00:21:02.996
is that this is a judgment point.

00:21:03.196 --> 00:21:05.916
Introspect yourself, find out,

00:21:06.156 --> 00:21:10.556
"Am I wise? If I'm doing this, am I doing wise things?

00:21:10.916 --> 00:21:13.316
Is it wise for me to do?

00:21:13.636 --> 00:21:17.276
Is it all right for me as a Sahaja Yogi to do it?

00:21:17.556 --> 00:21:18.956
Should I do it or not?"

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.116
At every point you should see.

00:21:21.316 --> 00:21:23.996
I mean, you know that I don't want any money,

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.674
and I don't want any presents -- I've said hundred times,

00:21:26.795 --> 00:21:27.915
but they won't listen.

00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:28.909
Now they are saying that

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.383
"Mother if you stop giving us present, we'll stop."

00:21:31.504 --> 00:21:34.315
I said, "You stop first, then I'll stop."

00:21:34.436 --> 00:21:36.556
But despite all this quarrel and fight,

00:21:36.677 --> 00:21:38.192
there's one thing definitely:

00:21:38.313 --> 00:21:42.073
there's love, and you want to express it.

00:21:42.276 --> 00:21:46.276
But love here is not attached;

00:21:46.516 --> 00:21:52.796
it's detached love, where it flows to its greatest extent,

00:21:53.156 --> 00:21:56.796
takes all the responsibility.

00:21:58.516 --> 00:22:00.636
There is people, there are people

00:22:00.836 --> 00:22:03.156
who go on criticizing other Sahaja Yogis

00:22:03.396 --> 00:22:05.076
-- I have seen it, it's very common.

00:22:05.276 --> 00:22:08.076
That's a sign of a very low type of a Sahaja Yogi,

00:22:08.396 --> 00:22:10.636
because he doesn't see what's wrong with him.

00:22:10.836 --> 00:22:12.796
He's trying to criticize others,

00:22:13.116 --> 00:22:16.556
does he see what is wrong with him?

00:22:16.876 --> 00:22:20.396
There are other kinds of Sahaja Yogis

00:22:20.876 --> 00:22:25.556
who do not realize that they are like ganas.

00:22:25.996 --> 00:22:30.036
They are like ganas, and imagine the ganas, how quick they are.

00:22:30.396 --> 00:22:35.116
The Ganesha is creating those ganas,

00:22:35.316 --> 00:22:38.196
and they are in the sternum bones first,

00:22:38.436 --> 00:22:40.676
and then they go all over the body.

00:22:40.916 --> 00:22:44.516
As soon as this Center Heart, the Mother's place,

00:22:44.716 --> 00:22:49.476
starts little bit vibrating, they get alerted.

00:22:49.796 --> 00:22:52.236
So we have to be alert.

00:22:52.676 --> 00:22:56.036
It's very important that we have to be alert.

00:22:56.276 --> 00:22:58.116
For about twelve years of your age

00:22:58.316 --> 00:23:02.236
these ganas stay there in the sternum bone,

00:23:02.436 --> 00:23:04.596
and then they go to the whole body,

00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:06.275
because they are matured enough.

00:23:06.396 --> 00:23:08.912
They are kept there till they are completely matured

00:23:09.033 --> 00:23:10.796
to fight the enemies.

00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:15.076
And they know what kind of enemies they have, they know everything:

00:23:15.276 --> 00:23:19.556
what kind of fighting is needed, what kind of opposition is there.

00:23:19.876 --> 00:23:25.316
They will just select and they will appoint themselves,

00:23:25.516 --> 00:23:29.196
who should fight whom, who should do this.

00:23:29.476 --> 00:23:34.556
But they just don't sit all the time in the Mother's house.

00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:39.196
So we have to go to the people.

00:23:39.796 --> 00:23:42.756
We have to go into the Virata's body.

00:23:42.956 --> 00:23:46.876
We have to move out, we have to go all out;

00:23:47.076 --> 00:23:50.556
without having any fear you have to fight them.

00:23:50.677 --> 00:23:52.804
Not to sit at home crying like a baby,

00:23:52.925 --> 00:23:55.276
now you are all grown-up people.

00:23:55.516 --> 00:24:02.396
So this is what is written in the Buddha's future life,

00:24:02.556 --> 00:24:07.556
that He becomes Matreya, means He has three Mothers in Him

00:24:07.756 --> 00:24:08.876
"Ma treya."

00:24:09.076 --> 00:24:12.396
But also that He goes all out in the society,

00:24:12.636 --> 00:24:17.556
He goes out everywhere and He changes people.

00:24:17.996 --> 00:24:22.916
When you asked for Gurupada you don't know, you were in trouble.

00:24:23.516 --> 00:24:26.996
Guru doesn't sit at home.

00:24:27.236 --> 00:24:30.196
He has to go all out, meet all kinds of people,

00:24:30.396 --> 00:24:34.796
tell them about Sahaja Yoga; not to be afraid.

00:24:34.917 --> 00:24:36.661
You have to live in the society,

00:24:36.782 --> 00:24:39.066
you don't have to have exclusive society

00:24:39.187 --> 00:24:42.996
where we enjoy bhajans and things - that's over now.

00:24:43.276 --> 00:24:47.556
I mean, of course we'll always have bhajans, it doesn't mean that.

00:24:47.956 --> 00:24:51.036
But you have to go beyond.

00:24:51.316 --> 00:24:55.196
Not only to be involved only in your own problems

00:24:55.396 --> 00:24:59.796
which are being now solved, so only in Sahaja Yoga,but Sahaja Yogis;

00:24:59.996 --> 00:25:02.116
but you have to go all out,

00:25:02.316 --> 00:25:03.796
meet other people,

00:25:03.996 --> 00:25:05.396
tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:05.556 --> 00:25:08.556
The best is to wear badges so people ask, "Who is this?"

00:25:08.756 --> 00:25:13.036
- then you can talk to them, your friends, your society.

00:25:13.236 --> 00:25:16.196
You don't have to give up anything,

00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:18.636
don't have to give up anything.

00:25:18.876 --> 00:25:24.198
You are detached, you just go and see for yourself, this is wrong.

00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:26.633
Like yesterday they showed all kinds of things,

00:25:26.754 --> 00:25:28.676
also disco dance they showed you.

00:25:28.876 --> 00:25:31.716
You should go to the disco and give them the pamphlets,

00:25:31.916 --> 00:25:35.836
show them, "What are you doing, are you mad?"¨

00:25:38.556 --> 00:25:40.876
Or do this kind of a disco more there

00:25:41.076 --> 00:25:43.036
so they'll say, "What's wrong with them?"

00:25:43.236 --> 00:25:47.036
Then you say, "We are copying you."

00:25:50.836 --> 00:25:52.421
That will put them down.

00:25:52.542 --> 00:25:55.236
You see a lady who is, say, smoking and this and that,

00:25:55.436 --> 00:25:58.114
standing with a pose - go and stand before her with a pose

00:25:58.235 --> 00:25:59.835
and smoking like this.

00:25:59.956 --> 00:26:02.796
She'll stop it.

00:26:03.436 --> 00:26:06.236
So by copying them, one way,

00:26:06.516 --> 00:26:09.556
showing them what they are - another, writing.

00:26:09.796 --> 00:26:11.156
You must have writing.

00:26:11.356 --> 00:26:14.716
It's very important to write and answer.

00:26:14.916 --> 00:26:17.476
I must tell that there's a very nice article

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:19.276
which has come now with Me,

00:26:19.397 --> 00:26:21.789
and the English Sahaja Yogis should take it from Me

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.710
and answer the gentleman.

00:26:23.831 --> 00:26:27.756
It's very important. It's in My room, I'll give them.

00:26:28.876 --> 00:26:31.276
You must know what's happening all around -

00:26:31.516 --> 00:26:34.956
what's happening in Bosnia,

00:26:35.156 --> 00:26:37.556
what's happening in Italy, what's happening here.

00:26:37.756 --> 00:26:39.756
You should read newspapers.

00:26:39.956 --> 00:26:42.556
You can see television also,

00:26:42.876 --> 00:26:45.476
when - and now, when you are matured.

00:26:45.676 --> 00:26:47.316
Otherwise if you see television,

00:26:47.556 --> 00:26:51.276
you'll go mad like other television people are.

00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:55.236
So what's the use of seeing the television?

00:26:56.236 --> 00:26:59.036
But if you see the television with a detached mind,

00:26:59.236 --> 00:27:03.116
you'll immediately get the point where you have to hit.

00:27:03.436 --> 00:27:07.316
Otherwise you are sitting in the house nicely covered up,

00:27:07.516 --> 00:27:12.716
"Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother." That's not so.

00:27:15.916 --> 00:27:19.916
Ganesha gives powers to these ganas and they fight.

00:27:20.236 --> 00:27:22.276
That's why He's called as Ganapati.

00:27:22.476 --> 00:27:24.476
If you want to call Me Ganapati,

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:27.476
then you have to be like ganas

00:27:27.796 --> 00:27:31.916
who go all out, and work it out.

00:27:32.236 --> 00:27:35.196
In so many ways, there's so many tricks

00:27:35.477 --> 00:27:37.074
which you can play on these people

00:27:37.195 --> 00:27:39.195
and try to bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:39.316 --> 00:27:42.196
And with you is this all-pervading Power.

00:27:42.476 --> 00:27:43.756
You should not shun them.

00:27:43.956 --> 00:27:47.156
For example, laws of your countries are so horrible,

00:27:47.476 --> 00:27:50.756
some of the laws are so horrible, the peculiar type.

00:27:50.996 --> 00:27:52.676
You should write.

00:27:52.916 --> 00:27:57.756
There's no equity, there's no sense in so many laws that you have,

00:27:57.956 --> 00:27:59.196
which are money-oriented

00:27:59.396 --> 00:28:03.676
- say, in France they have very, very funny laws.

00:28:04.116 --> 00:28:08.356
And they never maintain the law, they don't believe in it.

00:28:09.076 --> 00:28:14.716
There's no morals, there are no laws. You write to them.

00:28:17.036 --> 00:28:20.196
You must go and see newspaper people, tell them about it.

00:28:20.396 --> 00:28:23.076
Try to now assert yourself.

00:28:23.316 --> 00:28:24.716
Unless and until you do that,

00:28:24.916 --> 00:28:29.636
nobody is going to get to Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:30.076 --> 00:28:32.716
You might get very great people out of that.

00:28:32.956 --> 00:28:36.196
You can invite some people, you can call them.

00:28:36.516 --> 00:28:39.516
The modus operandi of these gurus I have seen.

00:28:39.796 --> 00:28:42.556
They write very nice letters to all these big, big johnnies,

00:28:42.756 --> 00:28:44.716
as soon as they go to some house.

00:28:44.916 --> 00:28:48.516
Then they seek interview, go and see that person, talk to him.

00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:51.956
They carry, you see, a sort of a -

00:28:52.396 --> 00:28:55.916
you can say a kind of a

00:28:59.876 --> 00:29:01.996
negotiations, you can call it,

00:29:02.236 --> 00:29:06.116
or a some sort of a panel will go and see them.

00:29:06.356 --> 00:29:08.636
It's all that level. And then they show them books.

00:29:08.796 --> 00:29:11.076
"See now this is happening, why don't you take to it?

00:29:11.276 --> 00:29:13.116
We don't want money,"  this thing, that thing.

00:29:13.356 --> 00:29:16.776
You might get lots of people. But you have to invite them,

00:29:16.897 --> 00:29:20.195
because unless and until you invite them, they'll not come to you.

00:29:20.316 --> 00:29:23.276
So you have to invite them, and you have to tell them

00:29:23.476 --> 00:29:25.516
that "We want to meet you. This is it."

00:29:25.716 --> 00:29:29.956
Out of at least hundred, if not, at least twenty will reply.

00:29:30.077 --> 00:29:32.085
They would like to meet you. You should say:

00:29:32.206 --> 00:29:33.995
"We found out this, we found out that."

00:29:34.116 --> 00:29:37.756
So now today as Ganesha's ganas

00:29:38.036 --> 00:29:40.156
you have to do this special work,

00:29:40.476 --> 00:29:43.076
is to understand now you are matured enough,

00:29:43.276 --> 00:29:45.476
you have to go in the society.

00:29:45.796 --> 00:29:46.956
Now if you get upset,

00:29:47.077 --> 00:29:49.928
"Mother, I went there and this happened and that happened."

00:29:50.049 --> 00:29:52.156
It doesn't matter.

00:29:52.396 --> 00:29:54.196
You are not going to be crucified,

00:29:54.516 --> 00:29:56.276
you are not going to be murdered.

00:29:56.556 --> 00:29:59.676
And do you know there's all the time My protection on you?

00:29:59.996 --> 00:30:02.316
If you want you can see a photograph we have,

00:30:02.516 --> 00:30:07.076
with, ah, him, you can see that, complete protection.

00:30:07.436 --> 00:30:11.236
It follows you, you have seen light on your heads.

00:30:11.566 --> 00:30:13.810
You are the marked people, who are going -

00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:16.796
you are already sitting in the Kingdom of God.

00:30:16.996 --> 00:30:18.916
Why should you be afraid?

00:30:19.156 --> 00:30:21.716
Why should you not meet people?

00:30:22.076 --> 00:30:24.556
Then also I said, make some music.

00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:26.995
Like yesterday's, I liked the way they were singing.

00:30:27.116 --> 00:30:29.571
At least, you see, whatever they were singing,

00:30:29.692 --> 00:30:36.236
may not be pop music sort or something, but it was clear.

00:30:37.356 --> 00:30:41.236
The message should be clear - you can use pop style, doesn't matter -

00:30:41.516 --> 00:30:43.916
but the message should be clear, it should not be

00:30:44.116 --> 00:30:46.876
- I can never understand what they are singing.

00:30:47.236 --> 00:30:49.796
So every word should be clear-cut.

00:30:50.076 --> 00:30:53.636
We can go all out to have real publicity,

00:30:53.876 --> 00:30:57.236
but for that we need people who are really matured enough.

00:30:57.436 --> 00:30:59.476
Otherwise with the slightest provocation

00:30:59.716 --> 00:31:03.636
they get upset, start fighting - finished.

00:31:04.636 --> 00:31:05.916
Also we should not say

00:31:06.116 --> 00:31:08.636
that "You are intellectual, you cannot understand."

00:31:08.836 --> 00:31:11.836
You say "You can, mentally also you can understand,

00:31:12.116 --> 00:31:14.476
we can explain to you." Prepare yourself.

00:31:14.716 --> 00:31:17.956
We can even have some sort of seminars or classes

00:31:18.196 --> 00:31:20.476
where we can discuss about these things.

00:31:20.676 --> 00:31:23.196
In the pujas you can have some sort of a

00:31:23.436 --> 00:31:25.516
- morning time is always free -

00:31:25.796 --> 00:31:29.316
some sort of a seminar or a discussion,

00:31:29.516 --> 00:31:32.356
or they call a brain trust or whatever it is.

00:31:32.477 --> 00:31:34.240
And there you can discuss things,

00:31:34.361 --> 00:31:36.681
how we can proceed, what we can do.

00:31:36.802 --> 00:31:39.316
Now the time has come. It's over now,

00:31:39.516 --> 00:31:42.956
all this preparation is over, you are prepared for it.

00:31:43.156 --> 00:31:46.236
Now you have to go all out, tell people.

00:31:46.556 --> 00:31:49.996
You know these people from this Brahmakumari what they tell,

00:31:50.236 --> 00:31:51.996
"Now the doomsday has come.

00:31:52.196 --> 00:31:54.996
You are all going to be doomed" - openly -

00:31:55.356 --> 00:31:59.876
"and so that you give us money, you'll be saved."

00:32:00.716 --> 00:32:04.076
So now you have to say that "This is the last judgment.

00:32:04.316 --> 00:32:07.716
You take your realization, otherwise you'll be doomed."

00:32:07.996 --> 00:32:10.516
Unless and until you take your realization,

00:32:10.756 --> 00:32:15.276
without your ascent you cannot get out of your genetic problems.

00:32:15.836 --> 00:32:18.716
All these genetic problems can be only solved

00:32:18.956 --> 00:32:21.556
if you get your realization.

00:32:21.916 --> 00:32:25.436
So you have to tell others, "Get out of your personal problems."

00:32:25.716 --> 00:32:30.156
"Mother, my wife has no children." It doesn't matter.

00:32:30.396 --> 00:32:32.116
There are so many children in this world,

00:32:32.316 --> 00:32:35.316
you are doing a good work by not having a child.

00:32:35.676 --> 00:32:38.396
And if you want to have a child, you can adopt a child.

00:32:38.636 --> 00:32:43.116
Then, "My child is like this, my child is like that, my child ..."

00:32:43.516 --> 00:32:45.956
So much attachment to children I've never seen.

00:32:46.196 --> 00:32:48.476
Before marriage

00:32:48.756 --> 00:32:52.796
if they have children, I've seen people treat them better.

00:32:52.996 --> 00:32:55.345
But if they are married, they kill their children.

00:32:55.466 --> 00:32:57.115
So many people kill their children,

00:32:57.236 --> 00:32:59.356
abuse their children, do all kinds of things.

00:32:59.556 --> 00:33:01.636
But once they are Sahaja Yogis they,

00:33:01.876 --> 00:33:07.556
from this end to that end, they just get glued to their children.

00:33:08.116 --> 00:33:14.356
So there should be a detached attitude towards everything,

00:33:15.676 --> 00:33:19.476
and no attachments. Then only you'll be free.

00:33:19.876 --> 00:33:23.516
But that doesn't mean that you are not doing your duty,

00:33:23.716 --> 00:33:28.076
your nourishment that is needed.

00:33:28.436 --> 00:33:30.236
You have to give love to everyone,

00:33:30.476 --> 00:33:32.076
you have to care for everyone,

00:33:32.276 --> 00:33:34.756
but you shouldn't get attached.

00:33:35.076 --> 00:33:38.836
I have seen people, they get attached even to Sahaja yogis.

00:33:39.116 --> 00:33:42.556
One Sahaja yogi misbehaved and went out of the Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:42.836 --> 00:33:46.636
ten Sahaja Yogis went away with him.

00:33:46.916 --> 00:33:49.716
They are not attached to Me but to that stupid Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:52.436
He went to Nepal, he learnt some avidya,

00:33:52.636 --> 00:33:56.316
he came back, and they went away with him.

00:33:57.636 --> 00:34:00.276
That shows you have not developed your personality.

00:34:00.476 --> 00:34:04.996
How dare anybody influence you and say that get out of Sahaja Yoga!

00:34:05.196 --> 00:34:08.916
If you have a matured personality and responsibility, you will say

00:34:09.116 --> 00:34:13.756
"I have to do Sahaja Yoga work. That's the main thing I have to do."

00:34:14.396 --> 00:34:17.756
You must know that though you look ordinary people,

00:34:18.076 --> 00:34:21.116
but God has chosen you.

00:34:21.396 --> 00:34:28.116
If any one of you do not do Sahaja Yoga work, who will be blamed?

00:34:29.076 --> 00:34:31.876
In every aspect of life one should understand.

00:34:31.997 --> 00:34:34.756
You see, I don't say that you give Me money or anything,

00:34:34.877 --> 00:34:36.271
I don't want anything from you;

00:34:36.392 --> 00:34:38.352
as it is you know how much I am spending.

00:34:38.473 --> 00:34:41.276
But definitely if money is needed somewhere,

00:34:41.516 --> 00:34:45.476
you must go all out to help with money also.

00:34:45.876 --> 00:34:49.396
People will, they spend money in, say, races

00:34:49.716 --> 00:34:53.476
or spend money on some sort of a pub.

00:34:53.796 --> 00:34:55.516
All that money is saved now,

00:34:55.836 --> 00:34:57.956
you don't have to go to a pub, nothing.

00:34:58.276 --> 00:35:02.396
So if money is needed, you have to spend.

00:35:02.796 --> 00:35:05.036
Then another thing is, people just start asking

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:08.396
why it's so expensive, why this, why that?

00:35:08.716 --> 00:35:13.156
In Sahaja Yoga everybody knows accounts, everybody has accounts,

00:35:13.516 --> 00:35:17.316
there's nothing secret - where money goes, what we are using for.

00:35:17.516 --> 00:35:19.676
How do you have this, say, tent?

00:35:19.876 --> 00:35:22.676
How do you have this land?

00:35:22.916 --> 00:35:26.036
How do you have Daglio?

00:35:29.027 --> 00:35:30.954
Just think, and nobody thinks like that,

00:35:31.075 --> 00:35:34.195
from where Mother gets money to do all this things?

00:35:34.316 --> 00:35:39.396
I don't need such a big castle, do I - for what?

00:35:39.956 --> 00:35:44.996
I've already bought another house in London from My own money. Why?

00:35:45.476 --> 00:35:49.396
It's already you have spent so much money for this Shudy Camp.

00:35:49.676 --> 00:35:52.316
It's giving no money at all.

00:35:52.636 --> 00:35:55.996
Well, I don't need Sahaja Yoga, it is you people who need it.

00:35:56.316 --> 00:36:00.476
And if you start saving money on that also,

00:36:00.796 --> 00:36:03.676
then I don't know what to say to you.

00:36:03.996 --> 00:36:05.156
It doesn't mean like

00:36:05.277 --> 00:36:08.239
in the church they say you must give money and all that,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.880
but your dedication.

00:36:12.876 --> 00:36:15.076
If you have the dedication

00:36:15.316 --> 00:36:19.276
then you will yourself think, that is my responsibility.

00:36:19.397 --> 00:36:22.118
On the contrary, you'll say, "Oh, you need money? All right."

00:36:22.239 --> 00:36:24.074
Now school has to be built.

00:36:24.195 --> 00:36:26.755
Who has built Vashi?

00:36:26.876 --> 00:36:28.956
Who has built this Ganapatipule?

00:36:29.276 --> 00:36:33.876
Who has built such a big ashram now you'll see in Delhi?

00:36:36.156 --> 00:36:40.916
Who has donated money for Sahaja Yoga so far?

00:36:42.836 --> 00:36:44.516
You all have prospered in life,

00:36:44.716 --> 00:36:47.076
you all have got sufficient money,

00:36:47.276 --> 00:36:51.756
but what are you doing?

00:36:55.636 --> 00:36:59.556
So in this aspect is,

00:36:59.796 --> 00:37:05.316
you have to see that you do your level best for Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:05.716 --> 00:37:08.396
Another side is your creativity.

00:37:08.716 --> 00:37:12.756
There have been very great artists who came out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:12.996 --> 00:37:14.996
If they have to give any present

00:37:15.316 --> 00:37:18.676
they'll give the smallest possible, the cheapest possible.

00:37:18.996 --> 00:37:23.196
The most expensive one they keep with themselves and sell it.

00:37:23.516 --> 00:37:25.396
If they could give even one piece like that

00:37:25.636 --> 00:37:29.396
we can sell it in the market, just for Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:29.836 --> 00:37:33.916
But they'll give something very cheapish which cannot be used;

00:37:34.196 --> 00:37:37.556
it's just adding up to My personal archives.

00:37:38.076 --> 00:37:41.836
But if they give something sensible it can be sold.

00:37:42.196 --> 00:37:45.476
The musicians who go abroad, they can give some,

00:37:46.196 --> 00:37:49.636
their programs and things can make some money.

00:37:49.996 --> 00:37:53.876
And also if it is needed, that money can be used.

00:37:54.316 --> 00:37:56.796
Do you know we, I just asked once

00:37:57.036 --> 00:38:00.316
that collect some money for Indian project,

00:38:00.676 --> 00:38:02.676
one year, in Sahasrara.

00:38:02.916 --> 00:38:03.916
You must know that,

00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:07.716
that there were only five thousand pounds collected,

00:38:08.076 --> 00:38:11.476
and I was so ashamed that they are still there as it is,

00:38:11.756 --> 00:38:13.756
in the bank.

00:38:13.996 --> 00:38:16.636
How can you send five thousand to India?

00:38:16.836 --> 00:38:19.876
What will they think of you?

00:38:23.116 --> 00:38:28.556
Even the school for you, it is for your children,

00:38:30.796 --> 00:38:32.276
not for Indian children.

00:38:32.516 --> 00:38:37.036
But still it will be built by Indians, I know that -- or by Me.

00:38:38.156 --> 00:38:40.196
Thus we should realize

00:38:40.476 --> 00:38:42.756
that if we are wasting some money somewhere,

00:38:43.036 --> 00:38:45.716
we can utilize some money for Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:45.956 --> 00:38:49.756
We should have some money for our organization.

00:38:50.116 --> 00:38:53.516
Otherwise this is how, whatever we save on food or anything,

00:38:53.716 --> 00:38:55.436
that's very little amount;

00:38:55.676 --> 00:38:58.956
but still we are managing.

00:39:00.556 --> 00:39:05.676
Every guru takes money outside first and then come to the puja

00:39:06.316 --> 00:39:11.476
- outside, and that too, real, sumptuous one.

00:39:11.901 --> 00:39:13.248
I don't need any money.

00:39:13.369 --> 00:39:17.316
Even your puja money, everything, you know it goes into silver,

00:39:17.636 --> 00:39:20.996
because you cannot have puja with plastics.

00:39:21.316 --> 00:39:27.276
So to understand this you have to have auspiciousness, holiness.

00:39:27.756 --> 00:39:30.396
Now, you call Me "Holy Mother,"

00:39:30.756 --> 00:39:33.556
but are you respectful like that?

00:39:33.916 --> 00:39:38.636
Do you know what I am? Ganesha knew.

00:39:38.956 --> 00:39:42.436
Once, His Father said that

00:39:42.636 --> 00:39:45.636
"Whosoever goes round the Mother Earth first,

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:49.156
I'll give that person a present."

00:39:49.636 --> 00:39:52.356
So another brother, Kartikeya,

00:39:52.676 --> 00:39:57.716
He had a nice vahana, a nice vehicle -

00:39:58.036 --> 00:40:00.356
was a peacock,

00:40:00.636 --> 00:40:06.836
while Ganesha had just a little rat, a mouse,

00:40:07.356 --> 00:40:09.796
and He could never have competed with Him.

00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:12.076
So He said, "Who is greater than My Mother?

00:40:12.316 --> 00:40:13.836
She is the greatest of all.

00:40:14.156 --> 00:40:16.916
What is this Mother Earth or anyone?

00:40:17.037 --> 00:40:19.304
She can create so many Mother Earths like that."

00:40:19.425 --> 00:40:22.116
So He just went round Her and He got the prize,

00:40:22.316 --> 00:40:26.476
and this Kartikeya was still flying.

00:40:28.916 --> 00:40:34.036
So that is what it is, to understand the auspiciousness.

00:40:35.396 --> 00:40:38.716
I mean, though I must say I'm a Mahamaya, no doubt, it's not easy.

00:40:38.916 --> 00:40:42.716
You will never know Me fully, never -- that should not be;

00:40:42.996 --> 00:40:46.916
because then you won't sit here, you'll all run away.

00:40:47.116 --> 00:40:49.276
But despite that, try to understand.

00:40:49.516 --> 00:40:53.356
As Ganesha has understood His Mother, you have to understand.

00:40:53.716 --> 00:40:58.076
That extent is rather difficult, but still try:

00:40:58.636 --> 00:41:01.556
that this is the Power sitting before you.

00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:05.356
How we behave, how we talk, how we take decisions,

00:41:05.636 --> 00:41:08.876
what we do, is all wrong.

00:41:09.636 --> 00:41:13.076
If this doesn't penetrate into your brains

00:41:13.436 --> 00:41:16.196
that means kundalini has not come there.

00:41:16.476 --> 00:41:21.036
People could not raise even one kundalini, one person's kundalini.

00:41:21.436 --> 00:41:24.476
Even this artist who came, she said, "How can it be possible?

00:41:24.836 --> 00:41:27.836
I'm not so - I've done nothing.

00:41:28.116 --> 00:41:32.196
I'm not a person who is a saint. How can I get realization?"

00:41:32.396 --> 00:41:36.356
She was telling Me like this, "How can it be, Mother?"

00:41:37.236 --> 00:41:39.636
But you all got it, no doubt you have,

00:41:39.916 --> 00:41:42.116
none of you have doubts about it.

00:41:42.316 --> 00:41:45.036
And not only that it's happening through Me,

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:46.756
but you also can do it now.

00:41:46.956 --> 00:41:51.476
Who can do this kind of a thing, in the history of spirituality?

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:58.356
But I keep a kind of a image of Myself,

00:41:58.556 --> 00:42:01.196
I joke, I make fun,

00:42:02.156 --> 00:42:06.916
I do everything just like a normal mother.

00:42:07.276 --> 00:42:10.756
But that should not give you liberties -- that should not.

00:42:10.956 --> 00:42:13.196
Some people have written very rude letters to Me.

00:42:13.396 --> 00:42:15.476
I must tell you: be careful,

00:42:15.756 --> 00:42:18.669
you can't write rude letters to Me.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.915
Better not. When you suffer then you'll say,

00:42:21.036 --> 00:42:23.035
"Mother, this has happened, that has happened."

00:42:23.156 --> 00:42:25.875
You have no business to write rude letters to Me.

00:42:25.996 --> 00:42:29.956
And though I read them and I forgive, no doubt,

00:42:30.156 --> 00:42:33.796
because you are ignorant. But you must have knowledge,

00:42:34.076 --> 00:42:35.396
you must understand this,

00:42:35.556 --> 00:42:38.996
that Whom are you writing and what you are writing.

00:42:40.196 --> 00:42:42.876
This side is, of course,

00:42:43.116 --> 00:42:48.916
we have to see that Shri Ganesha has also a parasha in his hand.

00:42:49.636 --> 00:42:56.676
He is one of the most strict deity, very strict.

00:42:58.156 --> 00:43:00.956
Others may little bit hesitate,

00:43:01.196 --> 00:43:04.236
but He cannot tolerate. That's why Christ has said that

00:43:04.436 --> 00:43:06.116
"I will tolerate anything against Me,

00:43:06.316 --> 00:43:10.956
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

00:43:12.116 --> 00:43:18.396
Clearly He has warned - clearly,

00:43:20.156 --> 00:43:23.636
because He has a parasha in His hand

00:43:24.196 --> 00:43:28.236
and people get punished, no doubt.

00:43:29.796 --> 00:43:33.396
So this is another thing one has to understand,

00:43:33.676 --> 00:43:36.996
that Shri Ganesha has this parasha.

00:43:37.276 --> 00:43:40.876
And you too all have this parasha in your hand,

00:43:41.116 --> 00:43:44.236
which you don't know.

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:50.036
Anybody who will try to trouble you will be in trouble.

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:55.956
But what is missing is the faith.

00:43:56.196 --> 00:43:59.516
not blind but enlightened faith.

00:43:59.836 --> 00:44:03.476
If you have enlightened faith, then it works.

00:44:03.916 --> 00:44:07.196
There's one gentleman working in London airport,

00:44:07.396 --> 00:44:09.476
he's an Indian

00:44:09.676 --> 00:44:13.756
but I think he was looked after by some Western foreigner people

00:44:14.036 --> 00:44:15.476
- very good man.

00:44:15.716 --> 00:44:20.076
So he cannot come to program, he is very busy and all that, he cannot.

00:44:20.996 --> 00:44:24.676
But if I am in the airport he knows I am there.

00:44:24.956 --> 00:44:28.116
Some people tried to trouble him.

00:44:29.196 --> 00:44:33.756
So he said that "Don't trouble me.

00:44:33.956 --> 00:44:36.996
My Mother is very strong, you know; don't trouble me."

00:44:37.236 --> 00:44:40.036
They wouldn't listen, three of them.

00:44:40.276 --> 00:44:43.876
And the three of them next day lost their jobs.

00:44:43.997 --> 00:44:46.234
He said, "Why?" They said, "We don't know.

00:44:46.355 --> 00:44:48.796
The boss told us, 'You get out of the jobs.'

00:44:48.996 --> 00:44:51.796
We don't know how we lost our jobs."

00:44:52.276 --> 00:44:56.076
And still today they haven't got jobs.

00:44:59.996 --> 00:45:01.676
He said, "I had told you."

00:45:01.797 --> 00:45:04.554
They said, "Who is your Mother? Let us meet Her also.

00:45:04.675 --> 00:45:07.835
You see, this is what has happened to us, sorry we did this to you..."

00:45:07.956 --> 00:45:11.276
But nothing works out now.

00:45:12.636 --> 00:45:16.716
So you must have full faith in Sahaja Yoga,

00:45:17.036 --> 00:45:20.356
in Me, and in yourself.

00:45:20.477 --> 00:45:22.649
Those who do not have faith in themselves,

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.556
how can they have faith in others?

00:45:27.356 --> 00:45:30.836
This is another one thing you must understand,

00:45:31.116 --> 00:45:34.676
that you have tremendous powers,

00:45:35.116 --> 00:45:38.196
tremendous powers if you have faith.

00:45:38.556 --> 00:45:40.676
You'll just pray,

00:45:40.797 --> 00:45:42.947
"Mother, I want this gentleman to be cured,

00:45:43.068 --> 00:45:44.466
or this lady to be cured."

00:45:44.587 --> 00:45:46.876
It will be cured, you don't have to even touch that person --

00:45:47.116 --> 00:45:49.276
but your faith.

00:45:49.476 --> 00:45:52.116
Like yesterday they brought one lady.

00:45:52.356 --> 00:45:54.476
I was very busy, I was talking, doing this,

00:45:54.676 --> 00:45:57.316
and these are only two,three days when I have to really

00:45:57.516 --> 00:46:02.516
work very hard  with all the problems, and I couldn't see her.

00:46:02.756 --> 00:46:05.476
I said, "Why don't you go and cure? You can cure."

00:46:05.676 --> 00:46:08.156
Why should any Sahaja Yogi suffer from anything

00:46:08.356 --> 00:46:11.676
when there are other Sahaja Yogis?

00:46:11.996 --> 00:46:13.516
Why should I cure anymore?

00:46:13.716 --> 00:46:17.436
You all just put your hands and see if you can cure or not.

00:46:17.876 --> 00:46:20.996
Even your prayers are so powerful, you have no idea.

00:46:21.276 --> 00:46:22.796
Just pray.

00:46:23.076 --> 00:46:26.436
You have got the parasha in your hand, and nobody can harm you.

00:46:26.796 --> 00:46:30.836
And you have got the hand that can bless others.

00:46:31.436 --> 00:46:33.396
You have got that.

00:46:33.676 --> 00:46:38.356
You start your generosity and see, the Lakshmi will flow.

00:46:38.756 --> 00:46:40.636
But if you are not generous,

00:46:40.836 --> 00:46:43.836
calculating each and every pai - finished.

00:46:44.156 --> 00:46:46.156
Why should you?

00:46:46.476 --> 00:46:49.276
The Lakshmi will serve you.

00:46:49.636 --> 00:46:52.796
Know your powers, as Shri Ganesha knew it very well.

00:46:53.036 --> 00:46:54.796
He never bothered.

00:46:54.996 --> 00:46:58.316
Even with an elephant head He managed so many things.

00:46:58.636 --> 00:47:02.196
With human heads you should manage much better -

00:47:02.876 --> 00:47:06.636
or do you need elephant heads?

00:47:10.076 --> 00:47:11.636
Then another thing He has,

00:47:11.876 --> 00:47:15.196
that He's a satisfied person, extremely satisfied.

00:47:15.516 --> 00:47:18.516
And what He eats is a modoka, they have given Me just now here,

00:47:18.756 --> 00:47:21.636
is the modoka He eats.

00:47:22.396 --> 00:47:28.836
So that means that He eats something which is substantial,

00:47:29.236 --> 00:47:31.356
which has got all these dry fruits

00:47:31.556 --> 00:47:34.116
and everything in it, that's what He eats.

00:47:34.476 --> 00:47:40.476
And that is one capacity He has,

00:47:40.956 --> 00:47:42.636
to eat;

00:47:42.916 --> 00:47:45.356
because you can please Him by giving Him things.

00:47:45.556 --> 00:47:47.556
But Mine is just the other way round:

00:47:47.796 --> 00:47:50.276
I can't eat much, and you want to give Me.

00:47:50.556 --> 00:47:54.316
I don't know, He has taken all My capacity to eat, I think.

00:47:54.636 --> 00:47:56.556
But He can eat well.

00:47:56.836 --> 00:47:59.036
And whatever you eat,

00:47:59.276 --> 00:48:04.156
if you think of Him, "Shri Ganesha, I offer you this food also,"

00:48:04.556 --> 00:48:09.036
you'll never find dearth of food at all, never.

00:48:11.316 --> 00:48:16.836
Anything you want - like the other day it was very hot.

00:48:17.236 --> 00:48:20.076
They said, "Mother, let's cool it down."

00:48:20.276 --> 00:48:21.636
I said, "All right."

00:48:21.836 --> 00:48:23.396
As soon as we cooled it down,

00:48:23.636 --> 00:48:26.476
left to the right, Shri Ganesha comes in.

00:48:26.796 --> 00:48:28.756
So He came with full force,

00:48:28.956 --> 00:48:30.116
He cooled it down

00:48:30.316 --> 00:48:33.116
and rained, and rained and rained, brought water also

00:48:33.316 --> 00:48:35.516
because there was no water in these streams.

00:48:35.756 --> 00:48:40.076
You had to do your footsoaking, so water came also.

00:48:41.196 --> 00:48:45.436
And what a testing it - in one thing, how much happened.

00:48:45.996 --> 00:48:48.836
He tested you, He saw you, nothing happened.

00:48:49.076 --> 00:48:51.916
Even a little tent was not blown off.

00:48:52.276 --> 00:48:55.636
It was all fun.

00:48:58.396 --> 00:49:00.516
This is what is,

00:49:00.876 --> 00:49:04.476
that you are also a testing ground for others.

00:49:04.916 --> 00:49:07.076
Immediately you will know what sort of a man is.

00:49:07.276 --> 00:49:10.556
You are so powerful.

00:49:11.316 --> 00:49:14.916
Use your powers, use your powers.

00:49:15.116 --> 00:49:18.676
But what happens if your attention is on other things,

00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:21.916
it's not pure. Attention is on other

00:49:22.116 --> 00:49:27.396
- keep attention on Shri Ganesh,

00:49:27.876 --> 00:49:30.556
keep attention on Me.

00:49:30.996 --> 00:49:33.436
Everything will work out. Why should you work when

00:49:33.636 --> 00:49:36.276
He is there to work out everything for you,

00:49:36.516 --> 00:49:40.116
His ganas are there to work out for you?

00:49:40.516 --> 00:49:44.476
So put your attention in such a way

00:49:44.716 --> 00:49:51.836
that you know you are alert, daksha, you are alert,

00:49:52.076 --> 00:49:55.636
you know where is your attention going.

00:49:56.236 --> 00:50:00.396
And then you see the attention how it works.

00:50:01.156 --> 00:50:06.636
I never expected that I'll mature you so fast, but you have matured.

00:50:08.476 --> 00:50:12.636
But unless and until you know yourself fully what you have got,

00:50:12.916 --> 00:50:16.076
how am I to give you certificate?

00:50:16.276 --> 00:50:19.189
Even if I give certificate you won't believe.

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:21.185
Like they say you have graduated.

00:50:21.306 --> 00:50:25.426
Now you are not only graduated, but you are masters.

00:50:25.636 --> 00:50:29.756
Otherwise I would never have told you to ask for Gurupada.

00:50:31.236 --> 00:50:33.156
You are praveenas now.

00:50:33.396 --> 00:50:35.396
"Praveen" means a master.

00:50:35.796 --> 00:50:37.556
Use your mastery.

00:50:37.876 --> 00:50:40.636
But still you are sitting at home, this, that,

00:50:40.836 --> 00:50:44.076
"My father is sick." Go and treat him

00:50:44.356 --> 00:50:47.556
- you are a master.

00:50:48.156 --> 00:50:52.116
Like Shri Ganesha, such a little thing like that

00:50:52.476 --> 00:50:56.076
is the master, you are also masters.

00:50:56.636 --> 00:51:00.316
The ladies also should know they are also masters.

00:51:00.836 --> 00:51:03.196
Instead of getting involved into smaller things

00:51:03.396 --> 00:51:07.476
and brickbats and all that, rise!

00:51:13.036 --> 00:51:16.876
The another great quality of Him is that

00:51:17.156 --> 00:51:22.556
He uses His teeth to write.

00:51:22.756 --> 00:51:27.236
Teeth come to you from Shri Krishna --

00:51:28.556 --> 00:51:32.396
wisdom of Shri Krishna which becomes the Virat, the brain.

00:51:32.796 --> 00:51:35.996
So He uses the teeth to write.

00:51:36.316 --> 00:51:39.716
He wrote Mahabharata with His teeth.

00:51:40.156 --> 00:51:44.396
So it is said that you must use

00:51:45.516 --> 00:51:49.316
your brain

00:51:50.556 --> 00:51:53.756
with the enlightenment of Shri Krishna

00:51:54.076 --> 00:51:57.276
and write, write, and write,

00:51:57.676 --> 00:52:02.516
and produce it into books.

00:52:02.836 --> 00:52:07.836
All these gurus have been successful because they created books.

00:52:08.556 --> 00:52:11.836
And these books were read by people

00:52:12.036 --> 00:52:14.116
and they were so much impressed,

00:52:14.316 --> 00:52:18.196
because anything black and white becomes something great.

00:52:18.516 --> 00:52:21.236
You can also make nice dramas as you have made.

00:52:21.476 --> 00:52:24.156
You can approach the televisions

00:52:24.356 --> 00:52:26.756
and things, that "We have a nice drama for children."

00:52:26.956 --> 00:52:30.556
Now think about going in to people,

00:52:30.956 --> 00:52:33.236
live in the society, live with them,

00:52:33.556 --> 00:52:37.036
deliver to them what you have got it. It's your duty.

00:52:37.436 --> 00:52:40.476
It's not only that but it is also,

00:52:40.756 --> 00:52:44.436
it's a special privilege to you.

00:52:44.716 --> 00:52:48.916
I mean, for today as it is we had to delay,

00:52:49.156 --> 00:52:53.356
and I've tried to give you

00:52:53.636 --> 00:52:55.876
some points about Shri Ganesh.

00:52:56.156 --> 00:52:59.276
I think even if you give Me hundred lectures I cannot finish it,

00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:02.676
it's so great, it's like an ocean to Me.

00:53:03.156 --> 00:53:06.636
So I hope you will understand the essential,

00:53:07.316 --> 00:53:10.436
the fundamental principles of Shri Ganesha,

00:53:10.676 --> 00:53:15.516
and what is innocence is. The first is wisdom.

00:53:19.456 --> 00:53:23.656
May God bless you all.
