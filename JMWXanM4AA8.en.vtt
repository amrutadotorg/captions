WEBVTT

00:11.740 --> 00:18.740
We talk to you directly about things and though
you know I’ve been looking after

00:29.080 --> 00:32.570
you very well…

00:32.570 --> 00:34.320
[Marathi ?]

00:34.320 --> 00:40.080
And I didn’t have so much time but you know
I have to work very hard and when you have

00:40.080 --> 00:47.010
only one program, I have three or four programs
and I’m working very hard for them. And

00:47.010 --> 00:54.010
you see, I’ve told you that Maharashtra
is going to be very fast movement and we have

00:56.030 --> 01:02.850
to move very fast. Now what you have to understand
is that you have come for this program of

01:02.850 --> 01:09.850
Maharashtra for what? Why have you come here?
That people must understand. What I find that

01:14.210 --> 01:20.850
there is no understanding of this simple fact…with
some people…Some people are murmuring souls

01:20.850 --> 01:27.450
among you and they don’t understand why
are they here. They are here to learn certain

01:27.450 --> 01:29.340
things for Sahaja Yoga.

01:29.340 --> 01:35.960
Now, especially if you do not have an ashram
also there’s always a problem to learn how

01:35.960 --> 01:42.960
to live with others and in a way that we should
move
in a Spartan way, in a Spartan way, how to

01:47.920 --> 01:52.630
live in a Spartan way and how to be smart.
Now see these people here, Maharashtrians

01:52.630 --> 01:57.210
are. Just look at them, you have to learn
from them. How quick - I don’t have to tell

01:57.210 --> 02:01.389
them anything. See they are so self disciplined
within themselves… I don’t have to tell

02:01.389 --> 02:05.450
them anything. You see, they organize, they’re
working so hard, you can’t imagine. You

02:05.450 --> 02:09.850
are doing no work, if you look at it, what
work are you doing? Just taking your luggage,

02:09.850 --> 02:13.540
putting on the busses, getting down, sleeping
again. What work are you doing compared to

02:13.540 --> 02:17.780
them? But there is no smartness about it.
What I find, they themselves are seeing you,

02:17.780 --> 02:22.330
they think you are all lethargic people and
some of you are druggist or what is it? And

02:22.330 --> 02:27.970
the complaints are so funny, that as if you
think there’s a package deal of a touring

02:27.970 --> 02:32.190
thing, bus going and the organization is not
good and some are dominating, and this and

02:32.190 --> 02:37.440
this. It’s absolutely absurd, I think. Some
people are taking Sahaja Yoga as a lethargic

02:37.440 --> 02:43.220
stuff, you see, like a drug business, that
you get into lethargy, nobody has to tell

02:43.220 --> 02:48.830
you: “Get into the bus.” But why don’t
you get yourself? Everybody must organize,

02:48.830 --> 02:54.010
must learn something, otherwise it’s a waste.
I think it’s a waste coming down. You have

02:54.010 --> 03:01.010
not come here for a tourism. One thing. Must
understand, this point must be understood

03:01.290 --> 03:08.290
by all of you: it’s not tourism department
working this for you! Little comfort you get

03:08.490 --> 03:13.330
immediately you get into that nonsense and
you must know that too much of materialism

03:13.330 --> 03:17.870
has brought you to this stage that you have
too much of Ego. It’s a big headache - for

03:17.870 --> 03:24.700
Sahaja Yoga and for you also. You know that!
Too much of materialism. And this matter always

03:24.700 --> 03:30.780
tries to overpower the Spirit and your Spirit
is always overpowered by the Spirit. And you

03:30.780 --> 03:36.330
get into a lethargic mood and then anybody
tries to tell you: “Get fast or get do”,

03:36.330 --> 03:41.670
you think, “You are dominating!” and “This
is a - This is a nonsense”, I can’t understand

03:41.670 --> 03:42.740
this!

03:42.740 --> 03:47.430
Now why aren’t they seeing they want to
do any more organizing? Who wants to do it?

03:47.430 --> 03:52.350
Now, those who were complaining raise your
hands. Take it over. Good idea! He says: “I

03:52.350 --> 03:57.470
don’t want to do any organizing”. All
right! Who wants to do it? Let’s see who

03:57.470 --> 04:02.490
were complaining that he was crossing the
maryadas. Now let them take over! It’s not

04:02.490 --> 04:06.980
the way to behave. You see, you must have
your own disciplining, you must learn disciplining.

04:06.980 --> 04:12.080
People have taken many things for granted.
You see and that’s what happened with Nick

04:12.080 --> 04:16.410
when he tried to do. They are very comfortably
settled down in Linda’s house. And there

04:16.410 --> 04:20.049
also I’ve seen people do the same thing.
Because when you – they live there, there’s

04:20.049 --> 04:25.759
no need to have any disciplining, there is
nobody to tell. That’s not lethargy! Sahaja

04:25.759 --> 04:29.729
Yoga is a Spartan thing, a smart stuff.

04:29.729 --> 04:33.860
See, look at these people, how smart they
are. Early in the morning, 5.30 they’re

04:33.860 --> 04:38.259
up and they are doing the jobs. You see the
way they are organizing, you can’t imagine

04:38.259 --> 04:41.069
how much they are organizing. In far fetched
places, here also to organize everything is

04:41.069 --> 04:48.069
an impossible situation. Now what are we doing?
Just trying to think that, you see, “We

04:51.150 --> 04:57.110
are in a very package deal, we are here and
that everything should come to us in a way

04:57.110 --> 05:02.509
that is a tourist, this thing.” Now Warren
has retired, now, who wants to do the job,

05:02.509 --> 05:08.729
let me see? Those who have complained should
I put?

05:08.729 --> 05:14.400
What’s this going on, I just don’t understand.
One person starts a joke and everybody starts

05:14.400 --> 05:18.800
with it - it’s absolutely wrong, there’s
no tourism going on. You better go back, I’ll

05:18.800 --> 05:24.279
return all your money that you paid Me and
you go back. Here you have come to learn about

05:24.279 --> 05:29.249
Sahaja Yoga, how to become smart, how to be
Spartan, how to be light.

05:29.249 --> 05:36.249
How much your Mother is working at this age?
I’m sixty years of age. How much I’m working

05:36.320 --> 05:39.849
- just look at that. You have to be - I’m
your ideal or queen Elizabeth? Who is your

05:39.849 --> 05:46.849
ideal? I mean I just don’t understand. Why
are you here? And one person starts a joke,

05:48.580 --> 05:55.580
another takes it over and they all start talking
like this. This it’s absolutely an impossible

05:56.529 --> 06:02.419
situation. I don’t have to tell them, even
once. Can’t imagine? In the night they cook

06:02.419 --> 06:06.680
the food for you, you know? In the night - After
the program, they came down, made all that

06:06.680 --> 06:13.680
food for you here and we took it. Those who
were with Me know that. They cooked the food,

06:15.559 --> 06:20.930
all of them, these young boys and again up
they are in the morning 5.30 organizing everything.

06:20.930 --> 06:27.930
Look at that! Learn from them! You see, you
people, in quality are no good, must understand.

06:29.229 --> 06:34.499
You have nothing but Ego and a self-consciousness
that you are very great. No, you are not!

06:34.499 --> 06:40.300
I’ve to tell you very frankly. You have
to come down with that Ego, completely. Material

06:40.300 --> 06:46.340
development has ruined you completely there.
You see thousands of people raising here their

06:46.340 --> 06:52.340
hands. See the people here! Are we going to
forget all the civilization that’s doomed

06:52.340 --> 06:57.620
one in the West? You are the people, who are
the foundation. What are you, you are not

06:57.620 --> 06:58.909
saints, are you not?

06:58.909 --> 07:04.559
How does a saint live? You have seen Ramdasa
Swami, I went to see. Now do you realize that

07:04.559 --> 07:11.559
you went to Mahalakshmi, that’s one of the
- one of the pithas of, one of the Kundalini’s

07:12.059 --> 07:18.389
pitha, you see, of the whole Universe. Did
you follow that? Looking after your comfort

07:18.389 --> 07:25.139
state or looking after your Spirit, what are
you doing here? Did you go - did you understand

07:25.139 --> 07:31.289
that the temple was for that? Did you follow
that point? And now I want you to see another

07:31.289 --> 07:37.719
temple and then another temple I’m going
to have. It’s not so easy, no tourist has

07:37.719 --> 07:43.020
gone to these temples. Actually no Indians
are - no foreigners are allowed in these temples.

07:43.020 --> 07:48.830
Because you are saints they have allowed you,
but behave like saints. What’s this nonsense

07:48.830 --> 07:53.580
going on? Talking about comfort, this nonsense.
What comfort do you have there? I feel most

07:53.580 --> 08:00.580
uncomfortably in the Western countries. There’s
no comfort of the Spirit. Most uncomfortable

08:01.240 --> 08:08.240
I feel. Everybody drinking, everybody nonsensically
- so materialistic, so materialistic. Horrible!

08:08.339 --> 08:15.339
Now don’t think too much of yourself for
Heaven’s sake. I don’t want you to talk

08:16.749 --> 08:22.520
that somebody’s dominating you, crossing
your maryadas, Sahaj means lethargy. Why don’t

08:22.520 --> 08:28.689
you have your own Spirits and your own arrangements?
Everything you have misleft, 2 rooms, 4 rooms

08:28.689 --> 08:32.979
there unlocked this thing. There’s one girl
looking after Me, how smart she is, just see

08:32.979 --> 08:39.159
how smart she is. Even ten English girls can’t
look after Me the way she looks after Me.

08:39.159 --> 08:44.560
Every little bit of that she knows. I’m
not saying only English but all of you have

08:44.560 --> 08:51.560
this problem. Please get rid of it! Otherwise
forget the West!

08:54.110 --> 08:58.529
You have to do tremendous jobs. I’m trying
to look after you the way I can. You have

08:58.529 --> 09:03.079
to look after yourself. The way you are moving
I just don’t understand. Is it a package

09:03.079 --> 09:06.970
deal you have come? Those who have come for
the first time are more troublesome also.

09:06.970 --> 09:11.940
Because they have never seen this before.
I mean those who want to go back, can go back

09:11.940 --> 09:17.570
tomorrow. I’ll give you money, you go back.
Rahuri is going to be much worse than this.

09:17.570 --> 09:23.449
This is the first time you got a hotel - Aaaaa!
I mean, I don’t understand the way you have

09:23.449 --> 09:30.449
to be feeling comfortable. You want a bathroom?
All right, get attached to a bathroom and

09:31.180 --> 09:35.079
move about with the bathroom all the tour.

09:35.079 --> 09:40.399
I mean you know how I live in England, what
sort of a house I have and what sort of bathrooms

09:40.399 --> 09:47.399
I have. I’ve have never complained, I’ve
never thought of it even. Never! For Me it’s

09:48.199 --> 09:53.540
the Spirit. And don’t think too much of
yourself. Please! Everything they are running,

09:53.540 --> 10:00.540
Puja they are running, things they are running.
Look at them! Never a problem for Me.

10:02.709 --> 10:08.100
Now you have to go tomorrow to Tuljapur place.
This Vitthala is a very big place here of

10:08.100 --> 10:15.100
Vishuddhi that you have to see and you have
to go to Tuljapur. They are not comfortable

10:15.199 --> 10:20.050
that’s why they never appear in the West.
They are not comfortable there. Who would

10:20.050 --> 10:26.100
have built temples on these stones? They would
have? Do you think they would have understood

10:26.100 --> 10:33.100
Hanumana? See the standards! Look at him how
he lived. Even a person like Shivaji, he lived

10:36.199 --> 10:41.800
here. He was a king! I mean I have never put
you to any test or anything, but the amount

10:41.800 --> 10:45.569
of, you see, not that I want you to sleep
in the cold or anything, I didn’t want you

10:45.569 --> 10:52.569
to sleep in the cold, that you misunderstood.
But what’s this going on? Why don’t you

10:53.800 --> 10:58.399
get up 5 o’clock everyday? I sleep - I work
much more than you too! Today you know what

10:58.399 --> 11:03.019
programs you have? Puja here. You don’t
have to run the - anybody’s chakras, do

11:03.019 --> 11:09.790
you? You don’t have to raise mountains of
Kundalinis, do you? Stones and stones after

11:09.790 --> 11:16.120
thousands of - do you have to do that? I need
not talk about Myself. Then after that this

11:16.120 --> 11:23.120
program I have to deal with intellectuals,
then there’s a press conference, then after

11:23.600 --> 11:30.600
the press conference there’s a huge meeting
at 6 o’clock.

11:33.779 --> 11:40.779
The so-called comforts are nothing but enslavement
of your Spirit. It has enslaved your Spirit,

11:46.920 --> 11:53.920
the Spirit is enslaved, believe Me. Get out
of it! It’s a nonsense! Your are saints,

11:54.410 --> 12:01.310
you are seekers of ages, now get out of it,
absolutely get out of it!

12:01.310 --> 12:08.310
They are so Spartan, so smart. Mooladhara
is first class, just see….Early in the morning,

12:11.009 --> 12:18.009
5 o’clock bath and finished, they are ready!
What are you thinking all the time, that you

12:19.050 --> 12:21.889
are lazy, every time people see - they told
me some are taking perhaps drugs. That’s

12:21.889 --> 12:27.170
what they felt the way some of you are lethargic.
What is there to tell you, you can’t get

12:27.170 --> 12:33.430
into the bus and they can’t understand.
In 5 minutes they’ll arrange things, 5 minutes.

12:33.430 --> 12:40.430
Can you imagine, after the program they came
here, cooked food and I was there.

12:43.050 --> 12:48.069
Now don’t think too much, thinking too much
makes you just lazy lumps….that’s all….it’s

12:48.069 --> 12:55.069
not good. Thinking is another style of materialism,
is a subtler materialism. What is there to

12:57.170 --> 13:02.649
think? [Get into bhoots ] Get rid of it! And
there is one bhoot who is of fussy one here,

13:02.649 --> 13:07.319
I know all of them, very well, they have been
always a headache and I don’t know why they

13:07.319 --> 13:14.319
have come and they introduce to another person
and that bhoot goes on, on, on, on, on.

13:15.589 --> 13:22.589
But all such misfits will get out of Sahaja
Yoga, take it from Me! They’ll get out!

13:24.250 --> 13:31.029
You want Sahaja Yoga or not, that’s the
point. Then, why worry about comfort? It’s

13:31.029 --> 13:36.250
most surprising! Some of you who have come
for the first time from such a long distances,

13:36.250 --> 13:43.230
like Frankfurt people are perfectly all right,
Toronto are all right. From New York they

13:43.230 --> 13:50.230
are all right, these are all right, Steven
and his wife they are all right. I mean they

13:51.750 --> 13:58.750
all have the same profile. Why other people?
Now, please, try to give Me some joy. I don’t

14:02.649 --> 14:09.649
want to hear, “Now he wants to resign.”
You see, everybody starts talking, “He’s

14:10.589 --> 14:17.589
very dominating.” But why? What are you?
You don’t deserve any bad thing better,

14:17.839 --> 14:24.839
do you? You have to be smart. Are you smart?
Your Mooladharas’ like stones hanging round,

14:26.490 --> 14:33.490
all the time thinking, thinking - what? Clear
your Mooladharas!

14:38.759 --> 14:45.759
You must have Me as your ideal in Sahaja Yoga.
Look at Me! I mean, can you imagine? I have

14:57.910 --> 14:58.970
so much [slunk ?]! I’m working very hard,
you know that! I’m not - I’m marathon,

14:58.970 --> 15:02.329
you’ll go away. You’ll go to England,
you’ll go away to Europe, you’ll go away!

15:02.329 --> 15:09.329
What about Me? I’m still working, working,
working, working…Only reason is that I have

15:14.230 --> 15:21.230
a very good Mooladhara and a very good Agnya
and an excellent Sahasrara! I don’t think!

15:23.100 --> 15:26.639
Talk too much, better not talk! I think you
better stop talking to each other! That’s

15:26.639 --> 15:33.639
the best way it will work out. All this nonsensical
things you talk, you have nothing great to

15:34.050 --> 15:39.540
talk, sublime things, about God, about the
Spirit. You must have peace in yourself! If

15:39.540 --> 15:44.430
you have peace, you’ll enjoy it! The whole
place is so peaceful! Why don’t you see

15:44.430 --> 15:51.430
the peace of this place which is lacking in
that horrible comfortable place? All of them!

15:51.980 --> 15:58.980
There’s no peace. Feel the peace, you are
saints! Feel the peace of this place; in their

15:59.310 --> 16:06.310
hearts see - feel their peace. The riches
have ruined you. That’s the curse! That’s

16:11.360 --> 16:18.360
the curse! So feel the peace of the place!
There’s no peace within. Feel the peace

16:19.389 --> 16:26.389
within. What side of all these sides you see,
anywhere you go? ”Oh very nice, this is

16:27.189 --> 16:33.720
very nice” What is nice about it? The peace
of it, the subtler side, you have to be subtler

16:33.720 --> 16:39.060
persons to feel the subtle side. Feel the
subtle side, the music behind, the fragrance

16:39.060 --> 16:39.999
behind.

16:39.999 --> 16:46.999
If I’m your ideal, I feel very comfortably,
to be very frank. I don’t know when will

16:52.029 --> 16:59.029
I be out of that, I call it vanwas, is that
staying in a forest, a jungle. I feel it’s

17:00.740 --> 17:07.740
a jungle of people who are anarchist, arbitrary,
such Ego oriented, horrible people those who

17:07.860 --> 17:14.860
don’t know how to talk to each other. Horrible!
I’m for vanwas, I hope it finishes after

17:15.050 --> 17:18.809
12 years. It’s real vanwas for me!

17:18.809 --> 17:25.809
But now, you people give me some hope! Now,
no more talking like this! Shut up yourself

17:26.630 --> 17:33.630
for this point! Absolutely! Nobody’s going
to talk like this, it’s anti-God. See, why

17:33.909 --> 17:40.169
are we here? Get individualistic in the sense
you sit down for meditation, don’t talk.

17:40.169 --> 17:41.279
Sit down for meditation!

17:41.279 --> 17:47.590
You see you are trying to find organization
mistakes. I just can’t understand, what

17:47.590 --> 17:54.590
is the matter? Pull your ears for this, please
pull all of you. No more of this nonsense.

18:00.770 --> 18:05.059
And next time such people should not come,
I request such people who have been complaining

18:05.059 --> 18:09.039
please don’t come. Look at Genuine, she’s
so old, she never says anything. Whenever

18:09.039 --> 18:15.020
I ask her she says: “Mother, I’m happy.”
You are not going to enjoy anything, you see,

18:15.020 --> 18:21.309
because you are not subtle. Even coming to
the subtlest places you don’t enjoy anything.

18:21.309 --> 18:28.190
Where is your attention going? Inward? Believe
Me, they’re the most peaceful places where

18:28.190 --> 18:35.190
you have been. But your brain will never allow,
this brain, this horrid Ego will never allow

18:35.830 --> 18:41.380
you to enjoy. So get rid of it! All right?
Please, I want you to enjoy. I brought you

18:41.380 --> 18:48.380
here to enjoy. Don’t criticize! And any
side of comfort, you just get rid of it. You’ve

18:52.049 --> 18:57.779
got a cot? Sleep on the ground. Best is. Tell
your body: “I’m here! I’m a seeker!”

18:57.779 --> 19:03.190
You must know your true nature that you are
seekers, you are not like other people but

19:03.190 --> 19:10.190
that is still sticking on into your heads,
you still think on those lines.

19:19.630 --> 19:25.029
You must know that you should never challenge
anybody who’s organizing. That hurts Me!

19:25.029 --> 19:32.029
Never! He’s doing some job, you’re doing
no job. Must do that! What job are you doing?

19:32.059 --> 19:38.730
Very nice to criticize another person! What
job are you doing? Are you responsible for

19:38.730 --> 19:42.000
anything? Even for your clothes? He’s the
one who is working hard, it’s very nice

19:42.000 --> 19:46.390
to criticize such a person! It’s like any
Dick, Tom and Harry comes and criticizes Me

19:46.390 --> 19:51.460
that: “Why don’t You do this and why don’t
You do that?” Is exactly the same situation.

19:51.460 --> 19:55.809
You are doing no job, very nicely criticizing
others. Why, for what?

19:55.809 --> 20:02.809
You think you’ve paid for yourself, you’ve
paid very little, not much, I know that. How

20:03.390 --> 20:10.390
much I had to take for your traveling and
the amount of luggage you have brought. It’s

20:11.450 --> 20:16.230
a big problem in these places. Even if you
pay you can’t get it. But I’ve not brought

20:16.230 --> 20:20.770
you here to give you comfort at all. You must
know I told you it’s a very Spartan one.

20:20.770 --> 20:26.470
I’ve told you some that don’t get more
than 80 people. It’s an impossible situation.

20:26.470 --> 20:30.700
You can’t get busses, these are from the
state trading busses, we got with great difficulty.

20:30.700 --> 20:34.880
They gave us 2 busses, you see. They have
their own passengers, they have to sacrifice

20:34.880 --> 20:41.880
a lot. These are not the places we - I didn’t
want to travel this time, you remember. I

20:43.120 --> 20:49.370
was telling I don’t want to travel this
time with all of you. I want to go alone.

20:49.370 --> 20:56.370
I’ve told you that we have to spend some
money, more sometimes, sometimes less, sometimes

20:57.850 --> 21:02.640
we have to spend quite a lot, much more than
we expect, sometimes it’s lucky that we

21:02.640 --> 21:07.460
have less money. Whatever money remains it
will go for Sahaja Yoga. I don’t want your

21:07.460 --> 21:12.770
money, you know I’ve already overspent My
money. My bank is exhausted! You know that

21:12.770 --> 21:18.559
all! So, why you talk like this? You don’t
think how much Mother spends. You never think

21:18.559 --> 21:22.350
on that. You know Portugal - what happened.
You know how much money I spent in England.

21:22.350 --> 21:28.700
Then you don’t think on these lines, do
you, ever? Are you going to return that money

21:28.700 --> 21:35.700
to Me, anyone of you? But why stupidly talk
like this, as if there’s some tourism department

21:37.330 --> 21:42.610
going on, you paid for the money, you paid
for it, so you find faults with the organizers.

21:42.610 --> 21:47.250
Give up all these bad habits, absolutely.
Even if somebody beats you, you are not to

21:47.250 --> 21:54.250
complain now, keep it on that point. Ego needs
beating, nice beating, I tell you. Sometimes

21:54.279 --> 21:59.059
good beating will sort out all the problems.
Otherwise, if nobody beats you, beat yourself.

21:59.059 --> 22:02.000
That’s the best way.

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
Now not that everyone is like that; most of
you are very good, I know you are enjoying,

22:09.899 --> 22:14.029
but these are few people who are bhootish
and they are creating this problem and these

22:14.029 --> 22:21.029
bhootish people will give others bhootish
nature, so be careful. Those who have got

22:21.110 --> 22:28.110
the bhoots better turn them out. Just don’t
do anymore of this, just stop it. All right?

22:28.880 --> 22:35.500
We have to have self discipline. These people,
look at these people, no problem, no problem,

22:35.500 --> 22:41.260
such love, such organizing capacity. How much
- from 3 o’clock they’re waiting here

22:41.260 --> 22:48.260
for Me, 3 o’clock. Every ended up, you see,
they came back by 3 o’clock. Twelve hours.

22:49.880 --> 22:56.880
Again today they are back for Puja. And they
are engineers, they are doctors, they are

22:58.149 --> 23:03.980
everything. At least everybody’s a graduate,
at least, minimum.

23:03.980 --> 23:10.980
It’s true that in England even a garbage
cleaner gets more money than these people

23:12.230 --> 23:19.120
can get. But what, so what? Are they going
to carry their money with them or their bathrooms

23:19.120 --> 23:26.120
and their comforts? All these mythical ideas
you must give up. This is another world, that’s

23:28.480 --> 23:33.390
another world. You have to adjust yourself
to this world. It’s very sickening to Me,

23:33.390 --> 23:37.909
I tell you. Even if there are one person like
that, will be so sickening. Now don’t pay

23:37.909 --> 23:43.309
any attention to anybody who talks like that.
Just shut him down! You are so many who are

23:43.309 --> 23:46.840
good, only there are few who are funny. You
just shut them down: “ Now you will shut

23:46.840 --> 23:52.029
up, this is a bhoot!” on this point. You
must get up early in the morning, do your

23:52.029 --> 23:58.110
meditation, get into busses. You are here
for a package deal for one month to spartan

23:58.110 --> 23:58.990
yourself.

23:58.990 --> 24:05.990
All right? So, it’s a promise. It’s a
promise [since forward ?].

24:08.659 --> 24:12.409
Now with Rahuri it’s even much more, you
see. The villagers, they are going to get

24:12.409 --> 24:17.169
a shock that I brought some drunkards with
Me and those who cannot get into the bus,

24:17.169 --> 24:20.779
can’t get out, everything and, “I can’t
do this and I can’t do…”. Everything

24:20.779 --> 24:27.779
you have to do! Just it’s a promise, it’s
a promise. We are going to do it. All of us!

24:30.559 --> 24:34.820
All right? Even I! (Shri Mataji laughing)
All right!

24:34.820 --> 24:37.100
May God bless you!

24:37.100 --> 24:41.769
So not to feel bad, most of you are all right,
most of you are enjoying, I’m not saying,

24:41.769 --> 24:46.480
but there are few who are stupid and you don’t
listen to them! Just don’t listen! If somebody

24:46.480 --> 24:51.730
says that you shut that out, you’ll be amazed
if you shut that person out, you’ll be amazed

24:51.730 --> 24:58.730
that person will improve, you’ll help that
person! Nobody should talk like this! Noone

24:59.130 --> 25:01.100
should talk like this! It’s nonsensical!

25:01.100 --> 25:03.409
All right! May God bless you all!

25:03.409 --> 25:10.409
Let’s sit down with the Puja - with that
smartness! We have to be smart not lethargic

25:10.990 --> 25:16.510
in Sahaja Yoga! Sahaja means what? Like lazy
lumps? How are we going to do the work of

25:16.510 --> 25:22.190
the whole world if we are lazy lumps? Imagine
the amount of mountains we have to lift in

25:22.190 --> 25:28.080
the West, to think of them. And here we are
already exhausted… Haaa - like that! What

25:28.080 --> 25:35.080
are we going to do that? Ha! It’s a tremendous
task! See, it’s like, I don’t know what

25:35.100 --> 25:42.100
to say, it’s like taming a hippopotamus
or I don’t know what to say! Horrible! And

25:42.529 --> 25:46.870
you better smarten up yourself, maybe next
year I may never bring anyone of you, I tell

25:46.870 --> 25:53.500
you, I’m so fed up. But this is the style,
is the last chance perhaps, now I was saying

25:53.500 --> 25:57.919
it’s just last time but everybody said:
“No, no Mother!” Is it, remember Gregoire…

25:57.919 --> 26:04.919
I was not wanting, really, anybody to come!
It’s a headache you know! You still carry

26:04.960 --> 26:11.559
the ideas. Now, so that’s Paul! And look
at down there! Look at him! He’s any [UNCLEAR],

26:11.559 --> 26:16.590
he has a house of his own, he has a wife,
he has children, all that he’s given up,

26:16.590 --> 26:22.279
he’s coming. Look at him! He’s a big engineer
with the Municipality, he’s so doing so

26:22.279 --> 26:29.279
much of big, big bridges and all that – he
is here? Do you see in it any Ego? Do you

26:34.350 --> 26:40.230
find any Ego in him? Learn, learn from them.
If not from Me, from them.

26:40.230 --> 26:44.140
The one who arranged our program is a multimillionaire,
do you know that? He’s a multimillionaire.

26:44.140 --> 26:51.140
The one who took us to his to his farm house,
he’s a multimillionaire. But do you find

26:51.230 --> 26:56.130
anything, any …While my grandchildren themselves
have just come from a multimillionaire family.

26:56.130 --> 27:03.130
Do you find that in them? Why? Not that they
don’t have money, they don’t have comforts.

27:06.679 --> 27:12.260
But he told Me that “I haven’t got a car”
- he’s a multimillionaire, “because I

27:12.260 --> 27:17.070
don’t need it, I need a jeep so I bought
five jeeps”. Finished!

27:17.070 --> 27:21.850
But if somebody gets some money there, he’ll
have a swanky car to show off. They can’t

27:21.850 --> 27:27.570
understand, “why to buy when I don’t need
it, I’m working on the farm”. Finished!

27:27.570 --> 27:34.570
And you’re telling Me he‘ll go by ordinary
bus, he’ll do everything. He’s a multimillionaire,

27:35.070 --> 27:42.070
can you believe? Have you seen his business?
How many [looms ?] he has got, which is working

27:43.289 --> 27:50.289
out? Not that he’s miserly, how generous
he was! How his wife lives, how everything,

27:52.299 --> 27:59.299
just see! They might be having hundreds of
diamonds in the house but they don’t show

27:59.529 --> 28:06.529
off. I mean we must learn from them, you see,
also there are poor people, all of them are

28:10.639 --> 28:11.429
smart, very smart. They may live in a small,
little tent but you see, early in the morning

28:11.429 --> 28:17.630
they go to the river, have their bath, they’re
ready for the job! Smartness is one of the

28:17.630 --> 28:24.630
things you have to get in Sahaja Yoga. Spartan!
Living should be Spartan and smartness. Those

28:28.260 --> 28:30.590
two things you must keep in you.

28:30.590 --> 28:37.590
All right! Otherwise they think half of you
are sick. All right! So no thinking, just

28:41.570 --> 28:48.570
now. Put yourself into Nirvichara. Watch Me,
all of you, watch Me. Raise your heads again.

28:57.120 --> 29:04.120
All right! You’ve got rid of your vices
and things, but now get rid of this nonsense,

29:07.860 --> 29:12.250
of a Ego. This is the biggest problem you
have. The Ego is the biggest problem. And

29:12.250 --> 29:19.250
when you think you are dominated better accept
it - hundred times. Don’t tell others!

29:19.360 --> 29:26.360
Who’s right sided, left sided, right sided,
left sided - everybody’s branding everyone!

29:31.370 --> 29:38.370
In Sahaja Yoga nobody remains left, right
sided.

29:40.080 --> 29:47.080
Better? Much better. Whatever is good for
the Spirit, the enjoyment for the Spirit,

29:50.820 --> 29:57.820
then you will be in

30:12.320 --> 30:19.320
the other world, you see. Forget this nonsensical
world that you have been. You

31:48.600 --> 31:55.600
are all seekers, you are great people, God
gave you birth in that country, just to see

33:31.309 --> 33:38.309
what materialism is, not to get involved into
it. Get out! But evolve! Get out! We
have all this poverty, we
have all this discomfort. See the peace. Feel

35:50.030 --> 35:57.030
the peace of the landscape, of human beings,
everybody has peace. Look the smart little

38:49.180 --> 38:56.180
children this age, so happy here. All right?

39:05.770 --> 39:09.280
May God bless you!

39:09.280 --> 39:16.280
And don’t look miserable, anyone of you.
They can’t understand why are you looking

39:52.839 --> 39:59.839
miserable. They are -

40:20.460 --> 40:27.460
they think that they are

41:00.920 --> 41:07.920
not doing their work properly or you don’t
like the food. They just don’t understand

41:59.450 --> 42:06.450
because you look so miserable, anxiety and
tired for nothing at all. All right, may God

42:25.059 --> 42:31.380
bless you!

42:31.380 --> 42:38.380
Let’s have it now! Get up fast and go down!
Let’s see

46:52.630 --> 46:59.630
how fast you can get up. All right! Let’s
see how you

52:24.500 --> 52:31.500
get down.
