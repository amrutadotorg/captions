00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.680
"There is a big inner revolution that is coming up."

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.119
"We must understand we are delicately made

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.740
beautiful flowers of God.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.860
We are human beings.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.980
And the time has come for us to become now the fruits.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.140
This is the blossom time."

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.860
"I think next century we'll have beautiful
people all around us, no trouble of wars,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.100
very peaceful we'll be all sitting in the
kingdom of God."

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.420
The Vision

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.340
Since the beginning of time, human beings have been searching for answers:

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.440
Who am I?

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.440
Why am I here?

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.860
What is the purpose of existence?

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.120
Many great incarnations and prophets have tried to shed light on the human dilemma

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.400
and urge us towards spiritual awakening.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.980
Like different flowers on one tree of life,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.260
they spoke the same truth but were bathed in different fragrances.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.880
Buddha saw enlightenment as the answer to our suffering:

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.100
a thousand petal lotus emanating from crown of the head.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.280
Mohammad also spoke of the "Ruh" a cool breath
flowing out of the top of the head and the hands

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.020
"At the time of Resurrection your hands will
speak" he explained.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.980
And Krishna, in his playful mirth, depicted
the need for Yoga or union with the Divine.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.860
He spoke of the collective nature of man and
the need for each of us

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.180
to dissolve into the ocean of bliss.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.060
Christ also explained that salvation will
come only through a second birth.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.860
Forgiveness and compassion will clear the
path towards this awakening,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.660
which will be felt as tongues of cool flames crowning the head in the divine halo.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.980
Heralding the New Age of enlightenment, he promised us a Comforter, the Holy Spirit,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.480
an incarnation who would lead us from darkness to the dawning of a new era.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.660
The age of the Mother has arrived.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.120
Out of recognition for her great work, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi has been hailed around the world as the Great Mother.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.360
Since 1970, her mastery over the primordial
energy, known as Kundalini,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.340
has drawn seekers to her public programs by the thousands.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.120
They come to experience the awakening of this energy, which is felt as a cool breeze

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.380
emanating from the top of the head.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.360
As our spiritual mother, this force brings
about or a profound state of inner peace

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.420
as we are spiritually reborn.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.180
Through this connection to the Divine, we
go beyond the mind and into the state of thoughtless awareness,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.260
which heals and soothes our inner psyche.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.560
Lao Tse described the Kundalini in a most beautiful
way:

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.600
"There is a thing inherent and natural, which existed before Heaven and Earth.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.680
Motionless and fathomless, it stands alone and never changes.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.919
It pervades everywhere and never becomes exhausted.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.000
It may be regarded as the Mother of the universe.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.400
I do not know its name, if I am forced to give it a name, I call it Tao.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.800
And I name it as supreme."

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.120
Shri Mataji was born to a Christian family
at Chindawara,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.540
a town at the very center of India.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.500
She arrived at midday on 21 of March 1923, on the Spring equinox

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.780
at a time when the planets were aligned in a most extraordinary way.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.520
Heralding this auspicious event was her mother's dream to see a tiger.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.180
In the jungle, the wild animal appeared before her in all its splendour.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.360
She was overcome with joy and knew at that moment that there was something very special about her child.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.540
Born with the knowledge that she had a divine gift,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.820
Shri Mataji felt the need to share her understanding of God with humanity from her childhood.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.160
Her parents knew why she was on the earth and her father, who was a very learned man,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.440
helped her to understand about human beings.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.680
As a child, she was called Nirmala which means "pure" and she spent a very happy childhood endearing herself to all around her.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.140
She befriended all the animals and birds, sometimes even frightening the maids

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.160
when she brought snakes into the house to caress.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.660
At other times, she could be found alone in a remote corner of the house,

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.960
her face beaming with inner joy, lost in meditation.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.320
Even at an early age, she was searching for a way to share this joy with those around her.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.780
She loved everything that was genuine and natural,

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.700
walking each day to school in her bare feet in order to feel the earth.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.940
Her father laughingly would tell the new driver:

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.640
"It is easy to recognize my daughter; she is the girl who carries her shoes in her hands."

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.440
During vacations and holidays, Nirmala accompanied her family to Gandhi's Ashram.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.700
He enjoyed her immensely, affectionately calling her Nepali because of her beautiful features.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.140
Shri Mataji later explained her relationship with the Mahatma:

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.500
"Now, Gandhiji was very strict:

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.420
The way he used to make everyone get up at four in the morning: 'Have your bath, come to puja'.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.340
But his quality was that what he said, he practised.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.300
There was no hypocrisy about it.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.280
Also, he used to get into a temper with people who had misbehaved, and I used to put some cool water on him.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.260
Because I was a little girl, he would
really understand that and he used to say:

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.020
'How is it that you keep so peaceful about such things?'

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.060
And I said: 'That's the solution, reaction is not
the way you can really work it out.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.420
Forgiving itself solves the problem.' "

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.540
Seeing the wisdom of this child, Gandhi treated Nirmala with great respect.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.260
He recognized her divine nature and
sought her advice about spiritual matters.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.620
When the fight for Indian independence from Britain began,

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.900
Nirmala and her family were at the heart of the struggle.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.520
Renouncing their wealth her parents, Prasad and Cornelia Rao,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.520
who were direct descendants of the royal Shalivahana dynasty,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.840
helped to organize protests in Nagpur.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:58.000
As a result, they were frequently put in prison from 1928 until freedom was won in 1947.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.680
They made it a family rule that no one was to shed tears upon their departure for jail,

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.320
teaching the children to share in joy and grief alike.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:14.860
After all, their incarceration was a step towards freedom for their Mother India and there was no need to be sad.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.600
Growing up in the independence movement,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.200
Shri Mataji took an active role as a youth leader,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.240
spearheading the students’ struggle in Lahore while attending medical school.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.060
To this day she is an outspoken advocate for political freedom

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.660
declaring that people cannot grow spiritually until they are free politically.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.680
"I had such a good childhood with my parents,

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.380
They taught us how to be sacrificing.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.880
My father was in jail for years, my mother went to jail five times.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.480
And from huge big houses, we were living in huts,

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.380
but we used to enjoy everything.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.800
The feeling that whatever our parents are doing is for our country’s freedom

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.780
was so elevating, so elevating,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:28.360
that we never even thought of little comforts that children ask for.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:36.780
We could sleep anywhere, eat anything, live everywhere and that has given me the lesson that

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:43.520
if you have complete purity about your dedication

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.960
and purity about what you have to do, you can achieve it.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.740
And as Gandhiji had said, we have to have first freedom.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:02.780
I saw the Union Jack coming down and I saw the tricolour going up.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:13.640
That was the moment - it's beyond me - even now I remember those days."

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.440
Following the success of the freedom movement, her father played a key role

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.340
in helping to write the new constitution and to set a new government into motion.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.480
Now that Mother India was beginning to stand on her own, Shri Mataji felt free to marry.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:37.680
In 1947, she married Mr C.P. Shrivastava, a prominent member of the Indian Civil Service.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.880
They were blessed with two daughters, Kalpana and Sadhana, and success in his political career.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:01.060
He was appointed Personal Secretary to one the most famous and beloved Prime Ministers in Indian history:

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.720
Lal Bahadur Shastri.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:09.360
Following Shastri’s tragic death, Mr Shrivastava began his United Nations career

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.160
culminating in sixteen years as Secretary-General of the United Nation International Maritime Organization

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.120
and a knighthood by the Queen of England.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:27.100
During this period shri Mataji waited patiently for the right time to begin spreading her divine message.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.100
After raising her children to adulthood and
seeing them happily married

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.880
Shri Mataji had fulfilled her responsibility as a mother and a householder

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.580
and was prepared to embark upon her true life's work: the emancipation of humanity.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.620
Having been invited to the ashram of a prominent local guru in 1970

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.340
she was shocked to see him looting people in the name of spirituality.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:11.440
Suddenly aware that the seekers everywhere were in danger from this future trend,

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.880
Shri Mataji searched deep within herself for a solution.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:23.000
She spent the entire night on the seashore contemplating

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.400
and in the early hours of the morning,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.800
disgust with the falsehood she had witnessed and compassion for her children everywhere

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.160
forced her to act.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.680
She meditated upon the Sahasrara - the energy centre on the crown of the head -

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.700
and prayed that all the seekers of truth would eventually receive their enlightenment

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.980
and bring about the dawning of Collective Consciousness in humanity.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.220
She describes this historic event:

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:11.940
"As soon as Sahastrara was opened, the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous Chaitanya.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:20.480
And there was tremendous light in the sky and the whole thing came on the earth

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:26.740
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.220
with such a tremendous force as if I was unaware

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.600
and got stupefied.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:40.760
The happening was so unexpected and so tremendous

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.620
that I was stunned and

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:50.480
I became completely silent at its grandeur.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:57.880
I saw the Primordial Kundalini rising like a big furnace

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:06.480
and the furnace was very silent but burning appearance it had,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.640
as if you heat up some metal and it has many colours,

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:19.160
in the same way, the Kundalini showed up like a huge furnace which is like a tunnel

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:28.200
where you see these plants you have for coal-burning to create electricity

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:35.400
And it stretched like a telescope one after another it came out – tchu, tchu, tchu - like that.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:42.720
And the Deities came and sat on their seats, on their golden seats,

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:53.640
and then they lifted the whole of the head like a big dome and opened it,

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.980
and then this torrential rain completely drenched me

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.560
and I started seeing all that and got lost into the joy,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.040
It was like an artist seeing its own creation fulfilled.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.420
I felt the joy of great fulfilment."

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.360
After emerging from this beautiful experience,

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.740
Shri Mataji looked around and saw the blindness of human beings

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.620
and she became absolutely silent.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.700
She desired that everyone

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.900
should attain their Self-realization

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.600
in order that their eyes could be opened.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.140
Her vision for humanity had come into focus

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.000
and was beginning to unfold.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.900
Following this, Shri Mataji began teaching a small group of seekers how to meditate.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.560
She stood behind each individual

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.900
and raised the Kundalini by placing her hand

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.480
on the various energy centres along the spine.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.980
This was a natural process which awakened their residual power of pure desire

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.100
She awakened this power called Kundalini

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.240
which lay dormant in the sacrum bone

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.280
at the base of the spine coiled in the three and half coils.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.380
When awakened, it rose up the spinal cord connecting and enlightening the energy centres,

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.540
as it pierced the fontanel bone area as it pierced the fontanel bone area

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.080
they were connected  with the Divine.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.460
Although she was working with only a handful of people

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.860
she was searching for a universal method which would allow her to give this experience

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.680
to large groups of people.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.160
She soon developed the technique for en-mass Self-realization.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.660
Taking into account all the different combinations and permutations of a human personality,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.500
the method was startlingly simple.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.800
The seeker would express his or her desire by holding the left hand towards Shri Mataji.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.420
Verbal affirmations helped the mothering energy to rise and the experience could be verified

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:17.320
by feeling the Kundalini in the hands and above the head.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.660
As more and more people expressed their desire to have this awakening

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.720
she began an en-mass Self-realization movement.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.780
Sahaja Yoga was born.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.320
"Yoga" or "union" had become effortless.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.420
No more standing on your head, no need for expensive mantras,

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.900
Now, it was easier to get your enlightenment in the heart of London than it was in the Himalayas.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.440
Visits to the psychiatrist’s couch were no longer necessary.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.120
Shri Mataji was not concerned with the quantity of people but with the quality of the seekers.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.460
She never took any money for giving or developing Self-realization

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.520
and started Sahaja Yoga with her own resources.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.880
To this day, she insists that you cannot pay for your spiritual ascent.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:30.680
"And the people were so money-oriented that they would not listen to me because I said you cannot pay for your evolution,

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.300
you cannot pay for your Realization.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.540
While those people who said:" You have to pay", they were very happy.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.600
And they wouldn’t believe me.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.800
I was so disappointed with the way they were looking at spirituality.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.740
How much did we pay to Christ?

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.960
How much did we pay to Mother Earth for these flowers?

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:10.320
That money orientation was so great that one of the reasons for our plight is that

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:15.100
we supported all kinds of wrong, false people."

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.260
She was very anxious to save the American seekers from false gurus,

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.220
who had descended upon that country and were leading people to their destruction.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:40.940
In 1972, she sold her gold bangles and with that money set sail for America.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:48.140
In hall after hall, she warned of the dangers of following the false teachers who made many claims,

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:54.320
but in reality, were damaging the Kundalinis and energy centres of their disciples.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.380
However, this message fell on deaf ears.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.380
The seekers of America were two naive and enthralled to listen.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.200
She was in great anguish at the plight of America

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.780
and on board the ship to India,

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.960
her heart was pining to save her children.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.760
She addressed them in this poem:

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.220
To my flower children

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.440
You are angry with life
Like small children

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.700
Whose mother is lost in darkness

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.240
You sulk expressing despair

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.140
At the fruitless end of your journey
You wear ugliness to discover beauty

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.040
You name everything false in the name of truth

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.900
You drain out emotions to fill the cup of love

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.420
My sweet children my darling

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:54.660
How can you get peace by waging war
with yourself with your being with joy itself

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.780
Enough for your efforts of renunciation
The artificial mask of consolation

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.840
Now rest in the petals of the lotus flower
In the lap of your gracious mother

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:15.820
I will adorn your life with beautiful blossoms
And fill your moments with joyful fragrance

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:23.500
I will anoint your head with divine love
For I cannot bear your torture anymore

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:30.440
Let me engulf you in the ocean of joy
So you lose your being in the greater one

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:36.660
Who is smiling in your calyx of Self
Secretly hidden to tease you all the while

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:45.060
Be aware and you will find him
Vibrating your every fiber with blissful joy

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.160
Covering the whole universe with light.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:09.000
Shri Mataji’s efforts to reach the western seekers intensified in 1974.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:15.320
Her husband was elected Secretary-General of the United Nations International Maritime Organization

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.320
and they moved to England.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.980
Europe became her home and Sahaja Yoga centres sprang up across the continent.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.400
Finding that this worked well for individuals,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.800
she began to emphasize the need for collective awareness.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.400
The experience became stronger when shared with others.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.200
She likened this to the analogy of one candle enlightening another and another

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:42.400
until there were so many candles standing together that the room was filled with light.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.340
The added dimension of feeling the connection

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.080
to others was intrinsic

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.460
to this new state of consciousness.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.800
And those practising Sahaja Yoga found that they were part of something greater than themselves:

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.480
the transformation of mankind.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.300
Shri Mataji explained the door of Sahaja Yoga is open to everyone

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.040
and every human being can achieve Collective Consciousness.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
The only problem is that the freedom of choice of the individual has to be respected

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.200
because he has ultimately to enter the area of total freedom.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.200
Thus, there may be many who may not sincerely seek their salvation

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:30.800
but if later on, they see the multitude of Realized souls enjoying the bliss of Collective Consciousness

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.180
they may also desire to get into their higher evolutionary process.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.280
This is how all evolutionary processes have worked in nature.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.360
The guiding and controlling force that acts is the Spirit.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.540
This is the Collective Being within us which manifests in our attention

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.720
and makes us collectively conscious.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.400
Shri Mataji was foremost a mother

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.300
and her obligation was to see her dream for global transformation realized.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.640
Travelling tirelessly year-round, day in and day out,

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.640
she has given second birth to all who desired it.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.380
Since 1970, she has given enlightenment en-mass

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.420
in over sixty-five countries around the world

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.540
from Russia to Australia.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:42.000
In 1995, at a program held in Bombay, Shri
Mataji raised the Kundalinis of over 100 000 people at the same time.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.840
People overflowed from the hall and sat in the streets -

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.180
unable to hear the lecture they simply held out their hands and felt the joy.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.200
Programs of similar magnitude have become common throughout Russia and Eastern Europe.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.920
Shri Mataji's name has become a household word for many Russian families

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.980
and programs must be held in football stadiums to accommodate

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.300
all those who ardently desire their spiritual fulfilment.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:14.820
They recognize that she is the Great Mother who has come to comfort them.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:25.380
"Because these are special times, as blossom times,

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.340
and so many of you who were seekers before,

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:37.340
seeking truth all over, going to Himalayas, standing on your heads, fasting,

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.560
doing all kinds of renunciations and everything,

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:47.220
now have taken birth and are normal people, householders.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.660
This was all promised that such thing will happen.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.360
Only with such people, Sahaja Yoga will work out.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.240
So the whole thing is, I would say a plan
which has worked out.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.340
You all took your birth at this special moment

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.980
Even if you see the position of stars and all that, you can see clearly

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.220
how everything has clicked together.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.340
It's all a divine plan."

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:28.940
"So a person who is - has a Sahaj culture - is not only spontaneous,

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.620
but is inspired,

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.280
is an inspired personality.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:41.960
A person who is of that kind, an inspired visionary,

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.260
then other people get impressed by such a person that:

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:53.520
"See this, there's a man who’s inspired, who talks in an inspired way,

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.300
in a way that is something very different from others.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:03.880
Something new he says, new that is nourishing."

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.400
"In the world of this nonsense that we are living,

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.720
we have to be something like the lotuses,

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.580
who cannot be tarnished

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.940
who cannot be affected

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.580
by all the ills that are going on.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.960
This is what is the test, is the "pariksha" [examination],

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.340
that at this time, at this difficult time,

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:36.700
we can blossom and create fragrance

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.600
and get so many others to this beautiful atmosphere."

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:54.480
"With your good wishes, with your prayers,
this world will be so beautiful, so enchanting,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.840
that in the history,

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.080
people will describe that the world itself

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.840
became a lotus full of fragrance of divinity.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.840
You are the petals,

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.700
you are the corona,

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.580
you are the colour,

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.640
you are the beauty,

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.660
you are the pollen

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.600
of that beautiful lotus.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.740
which is my vision of this world"

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.680
In the history of spirituality,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:12.540
there has never been a personage who has more clearly defined the purpose of human existence

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.180
than Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.620
Her vision of mankind as an interwoven tapestry of many colours,

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.400
cultures and continents,

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.880
all joined in what she describes as ‘Collective Consciousness’ is unique,

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.460
in that it establishes the thread

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.800
which runs through all of human awareness.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.800
Shri Mataji sees us not as individuals,

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.680
stalking the earth in isolation,

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:48.300
but as instruments of the Divine, which, when awakened through Self-realization,

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:55.640
begin to fulfil their purpose and emit love and compassion into the world.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.320
Peace must first be established in the individual, she says,

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.960
and then will manifest itself over the earth.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:14.400
When this occurs, human beings will know themselves to be part and parcel of each other

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.080
and carry the light of the Spirit in their eyes.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.260
This light will comfort and soothe others

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.880
and bring about the emergence of the culture of the Spirit on earth.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.880
We will come to look upon this world in which we live

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.080
as a living and breathing entity

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:41.960
which both sustains and enriches us and cease to exploit and destroy its bounty.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.400
All things will reach a balance

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:53.000
because we will have realized the innate balance within ourselves through our connection to the Spirit.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:03.600
The complete transformation of both the inner and outer expressions of humanity is just within our grasp.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.580
We need only look within our own being to find the roots of all eternity.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.940
As each of us does this,

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.460
we lay the foundations for the coming age

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.120
and the great awakening

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.720
which will forever alter our future course.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.260
This is the vision of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.600
a living saint for modern times.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:48.800
Dedicated to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.
