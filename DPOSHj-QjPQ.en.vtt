00:00:10.857 --> 00:00:13.378
All the heavy things,

00:00:13.632 --> 00:00:17.148
all go downward,

00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:24.741
but the Kundalini rises higher and higher
and higher, because it is like fire.

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:30.374
Fire never burns downward. It always
burns upward.

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:38.565
She looks also like fire, and she has
the capacity of fire within her.

00:00:39.353 --> 00:00:49.642
The fire has a capacity to purify, and to
burn off whatever can be burnt off.

00:00:50.057 --> 00:00:54.025
It purifies the things which it cannot
burn,

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:58.337
and burns off the things which are
inflammable, which can be burnt out.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.538
So, the quality of fire that exists
in the Kundalini

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:08.629
burns off whatever is useless.

00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:14.679
Like in our house we find all the useless
things, and we take them in the garden

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.077
and burn them off, finished – once for all
they are finished.

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:23.259
So when the Kundalini rises, she also burns
off all useless things that you have,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.161
all your useless desires, your useless
ideas of action,

00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:37.752
all sorts of useless accumulation
of feelings and egos,

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:41.185
and every sort of a nonsensical thing that
is in between.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.188
Everything is burnt off fast, because they
can be burnt,

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:51.519
they are not eternal by nature. They are
not eternal by nature.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.881
They are temporarily there. All that is
temporary, she burns off,

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:06.102
and that’s how she enlightens the Spirit,
because Spirit cannot be burnt by anything.

00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:14.579
But this burning is so beautiful that it
burns off all that is bad, stagnating,

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.795
all that is polluting, all that is
a disease,

00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:23.644
and cools down the system.

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:31.700
It is very interesting to see how this
power of fire becomes the cool breeze.

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:41.247
So, Kundalini within us expedites the
living process within us of our evolution.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.570
So the power of Kundalini is to purify,
she purifies us like fire.

00:02:50.028 --> 00:02:55.373
She doesn’t purify us like water, it’s
surprising,

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:01.323
she doesn’t purify us like water. Now,
water, what does the water do?

00:03:01.524 --> 00:03:08.802
Water never burns off anything, but
it dissolves certain things.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.682
It can take in something within itself,
you see?

00:03:12.763 --> 00:03:16.082
It can contain some of the dirt within
itself.

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:20.108
Supposing you put a color in the water –
it assumes the color.

00:03:20.108 --> 00:03:23.115
But Kundalini does not assume the color.

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:28.600
She burns off. Do you follow My point?

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:33.741
So, if you have anything wrong within you,
she’ll burn it off,

00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:37.516
but she’ll not absorb – she’s pure.

00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:42.865
She cannot absorb

00:03:43.215 --> 00:03:49.999
those things into her that will pollute her.
She cannot be polluted.

00:03:53.028 --> 00:03:58.063
This quality of fire -

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.360
say for example, if you put gold in fire,
silver in fire, you can purify these things.

00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:08.069
Their pure form comes in… That’s how
you know.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.507
But if you put gold and fire in water,
nothing will happen.

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:19.603
At the most you can wash them from outside.
But in and out you cannot do it.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.700
So outwardly you can do with other things,
but with Kundalini you do in and out.

00:04:29.515 --> 00:04:32.642
The face also looks beautiful,

00:04:32.723 --> 00:04:40.798
as if some glazing has taken place
on the face, a new, bright face.

00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:49.235
It’s not sallow, neither it is horribly
burning,

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.882
nor is it pale and ugly-looking,

00:04:54.882 --> 00:05:02.467
but it becomes radiant. Radiance, that’s
what Kundalini gives you.
