00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:04.587
Sahaja Yoga has emerged,

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:07.690
but

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:13.667
it is not so easy for a human to understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.167
If you get a great thing like Sahaja Yoga so easily,

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:22.500
its greatness,

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.167
its assessment,

00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:31.222
reverence for the shakti,

00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:33.523
devotion for the Shakti,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.333
the hard work required to fully integrate it inside with full mind,

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.182
all these things will be lacking.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:51.500
That is why you notice that many are very casual.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.452
But the other swamijis,

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.539
you know how they consider the people,

00:01:02.063 --> 00:01:04.373
and how they exploit them.

00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:08.667
They take money from you,

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:12.823
make you do hard work, make you stand on your head,

00:01:13.024 --> 00:01:16.833
make you do bodily work, some or other hard work

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.452
so that your ego gets satisfied a little bit

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.404
and you stick to it.

00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:29.595
You may also have seen such people,

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:33.611
who give away everything they have, like money, etc.

00:01:34.151 --> 00:01:37.333
to these swamijis and then they sweep at Swamijiís place.

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:42.492
One gets Sahaja Yoga

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.817
with such ease,

00:01:51.357 --> 00:01:53.571
they are casual towards it.

00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:56.944
Like they got their eyes so easily,

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.576
they are casual, they do not know the value of these eyes.

00:02:01.777 --> 00:02:06.500
But the day we have a problem with the eye, we will say ëOh, Godí.

00:02:08.198 --> 00:02:11.000
That is why one must have difficulties.

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:15.428
If there is no difficulty, the Sahaja Yogi will not care for it at all.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.862
How long difficulties will be there will depend on you,

00:02:28.063 --> 00:02:31.555
it will be there till you hold on to them, what can be done about it?

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:41.214
There are some people, you know, once they are realised, they are realised; it will not touch them.

00:02:41.683 --> 00:02:43.683
They will never have difficulties;

00:02:45.643 --> 00:02:48.841
it is due to the Punyas (good deeds) from their previous lives.

00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:53.833
They should also be alert.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.404
They should not be unduly happy, ëWe do not have any difficulty, so we are special, no problemí.

00:03:06.507 --> 00:03:10.833
Being casual towards

00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:15.484
Sahaja Yoga will prove costly.

00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:23.696
If you are casual towards yourself, there is no harm,

00:03:23.897 --> 00:03:26.989
because there is someone to look after your eyes,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.333
hands, legs, body-there is someone to look after, ready.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.204
You donít have to look after it.

00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:37.722
But your Sahaja Yoga, you have to look after yourselves.

00:03:38.302 --> 00:03:40.370
There is a big difference between the two.

00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:43.933
All your body will be managed, whatever other things which,

00:03:44.134 --> 00:03:48.140
I call your three dimensions, will all be managed.

00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:51.500
But your Sahaja Yoga, only you have to practice.

00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:58.333
You have to flow in that, but you are so casual,

00:03:58.817 --> 00:04:00.404
so casual,

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:03.188
even if someone is sitting next to you,

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.951
you donít tell him, meet him, talk about this and dedicate to Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.571
There are many people and different parts of the body - (alluding to the Sahaja Yogis)- are separated

00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:21.936
Yesterday a girl had a problem and her brother came, he got realisation in a split second.

00:04:22.611 --> 00:04:27.694
Lots of your limbs have fallen in this world and you have to gather them,

00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:30.150
even that is a big Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:34.500
In your own house, how can one be outside Sahaja Yoga?

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:37.743
If you are in my house, you have to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.870
get realisation and you should not have any problem.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:43.349
You should insist, you should not get angry with them.

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:49.095
You have to tell them about this, talk about this, but you should not be casual.

00:04:53.056 --> 00:04:58.420
Eat, rise, sit and as you take a breath and with every breath,

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:03.976
you have to propose Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:05.976 --> 00:05:09.436
Because, if you consider yourself a special form,

00:05:10.278 --> 00:05:14.499
and if you think that there is something special about your temple,

00:05:14.746 --> 00:05:17.920
there should be ringing of bells all the time,

00:05:19.762 --> 00:05:21.785
otherwise it will be a waste.

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:31.460
Sahaja Yoga also can go waste.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.857
You understand this.

00:05:36.444 --> 00:05:41.992
Another thing I want to tell you is that without Sahaja Yoga, you do not have a personality now.

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.253
Without that there is no glow.

00:05:49.627 --> 00:05:53.167
Without that there is no acceptance.

00:05:54.413 --> 00:05:59.833
If you come into the kingdom of God, you have to take citizenship!

00:06:06.246 --> 00:06:11.515
I heard from many people, my brother came yesterday, he saidí ëI went to Gajanand Maharají.

00:06:12.087 --> 00:06:14.682
I do not know who Gajanand Maharaj is.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.833
Phadke talked about Gajanand Maharaj.

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:22.037
Then, I saw that Agnya chakra, Vishuddhi chakra, and another chakra - three chakras were caught up.

00:06:22.238 --> 00:06:27.142
He told his experience that he gets a catch from his photograph itself.

00:06:28.151 --> 00:06:30.149
Three chakras were caught up.

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:35.167
I said, ëI am your sister sitting here and why did you go to Gajanand Maharaj?í

00:06:37.367 --> 00:06:41.180
He said ëAll told me, he is a saintí. I said check from Vibrations, whether he is a saint or not.

00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:44.261
He went casually. He should have checked.

00:06:44.627 --> 00:06:46.333
Is this Sahaja Yoga?

00:06:49.913 --> 00:06:53.230
After becoming a King, one who becomes a beggar,

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.529
he should be removed.

00:07:03.167 --> 00:07:06.222
But you are becoming a beggar knowingly.

00:07:06.936 --> 00:07:11.299
Went casually, went there also. What to do, my wife is like this,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.484
what to do, my father is like this what to do, my daughter said let us go and I went.

00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:22.114
Then what happened, After coming back, Mataji, my Agnya chakra is caught up,

00:07:22.315 --> 00:07:25.752
have a catch in the stomach, Nabhi chakra is caught up, three chakras are caught up.

00:07:26.262 --> 00:07:30.667
I am your own sister sitting here, who asked you to go to Gajanand Maharaj?

00:07:31.968 --> 00:07:36.667
Then we thought our condition was bad, so let us go to Saibaba.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.902
Then I said, first you come here, get the stomach fixed, then go to Saibaba.

00:07:44.103 --> 00:07:47.696
If you go there also what wisdom will you get? Thousands go there, what happens there?

00:07:47.897 --> 00:07:51.817
What do you want to ask? Want to ask for material things from Saibaba?

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.206
When will manís material desires be fulfilled?

00:07:58.747 --> 00:08:02.167
Everything is done, what do you want materially?

00:08:04.706 --> 00:08:07.976
You have become a king, what do you still want?

00:08:14.381 --> 00:08:16.325
What I have come to give,

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.182
what you have to get,

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:21.204
that is very important.

00:08:21.405 --> 00:08:23.246
For the human race,

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:27.904
God has made a human after a lot of contemplation.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
There is so much dirt in your brains collected from here and there, throw it away.

00:08:36.222 --> 00:08:39.666
You have collected a lot of useless things, junk.

00:08:40.452 --> 00:08:43.984
Throw away from this temple and make that temple prestigious.

00:08:44.206 --> 00:08:47.539
Have to light a lamp in each and every heart.

00:08:49.008 --> 00:08:51.333
Purify your house, purify your

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.642
family, purify your society.

00:09:00.397 --> 00:09:03.047
You care a lot for your relatives!

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:04.609
You have a lot of relatives.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:09.632
ëI have come for them, my mother-in-law has come, I have to give her, I have to do something for her.

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:11.688
What will your mother-in-law give you,

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:15.498
When you go, she will give you thrashing with footwear.

00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:23.979
These are your relatives, Know that.

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:28.444
You do not have any relatives, other than these.

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:33.735
Only a Sahaja Yogi is the relative of a Sahaja Yogi because they speak a distinct language.

00:09:33.936 --> 00:09:37.333
Their ways are different, their stride is different.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.380
You have to give your life.

00:09:52.857 --> 00:09:56.000
And love.
You have to share your love.

00:09:58.635 --> 00:10:03.585
Love will flow on the edge of the mind, Correct your mind, make your mind light.

00:10:03.786 --> 00:10:06.093
If you keep so much in your mind,

00:10:06.294 --> 00:10:10.801
how will Sahaja Yoga get in there? It is working on the mind, watch.

00:10:16.857 --> 00:10:19.667
God is sitting to pour on you.

00:10:20.936 --> 00:10:25.214
But where is your attention? It keeps wavering every two minutes.

00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:31.667
You have to put your attention at His feet, He does not want your money, etc.

00:10:31.905 --> 00:10:35.823
Keep it with you. What is the importance of all the collections made from deaths?

00:10:36.024 --> 00:10:37.854
Make your attention important.

00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:40.285
God will descend on that mind.

00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:46.000
He has made you younger by ten to twenty years.

00:10:47.516 --> 00:10:49.531
Your body has become alright.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.785
Thoughts of your mind have been purified.

00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:56.767
You have got collective consciousness.

00:10:56.968 --> 00:10:57.968
Now what?

00:10:59.484 --> 00:11:02.220
Still, you are running after this and that.

00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:05.119
Do you attach more importance to that?

00:11:05.714 --> 00:11:07.739
In your previous lives, you have earned a lot of dung.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.262
You have left it here and gone. Again gather it!

00:11:10.463 --> 00:11:12.005
You will again leave it here and go.

00:11:12.206 --> 00:11:16.555
It is very dangerous to be casual for a Sahaja Yogi.

00:11:21.294 --> 00:11:23.230
This is called negligence.

00:11:25.532 --> 00:11:27.658
A big war has arisen.

00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:34.600
You know that

00:11:36.944 --> 00:11:40.349
other ways of destruction have been kept ready.

00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:46.833
Sahaja Yoga is standing like a lotus in this mud;

00:11:52.738 --> 00:11:53.785
delicate,

00:11:54.444 --> 00:11:55.492
aromatic,

00:11:55.802 --> 00:11:56.802
fragrant,

00:11:57.143 --> 00:11:58.143
beautiful

00:12:01.929 --> 00:12:04.349
and you are petals of that.

00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:13.023
All the mud which is there will fall off once you know that you are the lotus,

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:16.777
you are not the mud.

00:12:17.032 --> 00:12:21.167
But by chance if a chakra catches, it is mud, remove it.

00:12:21.548 --> 00:12:23.833
You have been made a lotus.

00:12:25.341 --> 00:12:30.793
You are the lotus and if the mud falls on the lotus, the lotus should throw it away

00:12:31.286 --> 00:12:33.587
and also it is also not going to stick.

00:12:36.416 --> 00:12:39.686
Everyone has to be aware of Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:41.408 --> 00:12:44.477
If you have to cross with the ferry of Sahaja Yoga, donít get bogged down

00:12:44.678 --> 00:12:47.153
by small problems of family

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.186
and small problems in the house.

00:12:54.178 --> 00:12:58.008
How long are you going to hold onto this mud with your hand?

00:12:58.209 --> 00:13:00.836
There is no one to support you.

00:13:03.114 --> 00:13:05.961
The boy is to be married, the girl is to be married,

00:13:06.162 --> 00:13:08.686
it may happen, may not happen.

00:13:09.614 --> 00:13:11.725
You will spend money on that.

00:13:14.844 --> 00:13:16.852
You will earn a name in that.

00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:20.249
And for Sahaja Yoga?

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.265
For Sahaja Yoga, you have no time.

00:13:27.067 --> 00:13:29.058
The most important thing is

00:13:30.328 --> 00:13:33.186
that Indians donít have much money.

00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:39.344
If you look at it,

00:13:41.702 --> 00:13:44.511
their financial condition is not that good.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.899
But we should know that vibrations are there only in India, which controls everything.

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:56.519
If it were any other country it would have collapsed by now.

00:13:57.868 --> 00:14:01.145
You are living only with the help of those Vibrations.

00:14:02.916 --> 00:14:04.407
What a big country!

00:14:04.884 --> 00:14:07.233
You are born in such a great country.

00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:09.286
You know everything.

00:14:09.487 --> 00:14:13.001
I donít know how to tell the English about Devi mahatmyam, they have not read it.

00:14:13.202 --> 00:14:16.191
They donít know what Devi is and what Maa is.

00:14:16.392 --> 00:14:19.534
They are such dirty people they donít know what Maa is;

00:14:19.735 --> 00:14:22.899
how can I tell them what Maa is, I feel like crying.

00:14:26.709 --> 00:14:31.717
And you have become so casual and you sit in meditation as if for a shave.

00:14:33.416 --> 00:14:34.852
How will it happen?!

00:14:42.352 --> 00:14:45.381
My brothers asked me ëwhy are you struggling day in and day out?

00:14:45.582 --> 00:14:49.439
If your health gets affected, what will we tell your husband?

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:54.947
You sleep at night at 4 or 5 and the whole day you are working.

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:59.080
Why are you doing it? What are you going to get,

00:14:59.281 --> 00:15:02.955
we donít understandí. Now they will not understand nor will I!

00:15:03.432 --> 00:15:07.923
When we both have an understanding then only something will happen.

00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:14.875
I can fight it out alone,

00:15:15.243 --> 00:15:17.740
but how will you benefit from that?

00:15:23.796 --> 00:15:29.352
Being casual, walking casually are signs of showing apathy towards yourself.

00:15:29.781 --> 00:15:32.352
Itís disrespectful to yourself.

00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:41.186
The king who got the entire wealth is being so casual.

00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:42.884
Rule,

00:15:44.836 --> 00:15:45.963
Relax!

00:15:49.987 --> 00:15:56.384
Are you going to finish Sahaja Yoga on small issues?

00:15:58.717 --> 00:16:02.596
You clean your inner being, you clean your heart. Leave the over smartness.

00:16:02.797 --> 00:16:05.780
Cleanse your heart and check

00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:11.447
ëAre we sitting in innocence?í

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:20.186
You are not doing a favour to me.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.169
It is for you;

00:16:27.336 --> 00:16:31.058
you are getting what you have been asking,

00:16:31.273 --> 00:16:34.757
what you have been searching for ages, you are getting.

00:16:36.416 --> 00:16:40.217
When you have reached the pinnacle, why are you being mad?

00:16:42.796 --> 00:16:47.719
You may not have seen those who turn their face away when they reach the pinnacle, but I have seen.

00:16:48.085 --> 00:16:53.106
First, you have to make them stick. Have to keep on saying, ëstick-on, stick on!í

00:17:09.521 --> 00:17:12.852
Sometimes I think of you like this;

00:17:13.146 --> 00:17:16.566
ëwhat can we do? Things are so bad in our country.

00:17:16.821 --> 00:17:18.952
We are poor people, we have our problems,

00:17:19.153 --> 00:17:23.511
how can we uplift the country, Mataji? You have put us on a higher pedestalí.

00:17:29.954 --> 00:17:32.519
It is good that you donít have money.

00:17:33.765 --> 00:17:37.699
I have given realisation to so many rich people here. Where are they?

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.445
See only 2 or 4 here. They are even very miserly, we donít have a rich man among us.

00:17:41.646 --> 00:17:44.352
I have given realisation to millionaires.

00:17:45.384 --> 00:17:49.094
What are they doing? It is good you donít have money, it is a hassle.

00:17:49.295 --> 00:17:51.295
Very little is sticking to you.

00:17:54.082 --> 00:17:55.939
Less money is very good.

00:17:56.384 --> 00:17:58.143
I have seen rich people,

00:17:58.344 --> 00:18:04.019
people holding positions, Ministers. They donít have the happiness which you have.

00:18:09.146 --> 00:18:13.701
They get realisation and sit back in style, and sit with a lot of money.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.186
Ministers and Secretaries have got their realisation.

00:18:20.622 --> 00:18:22.056
What have they done?

00:18:22.257 --> 00:18:24.620
God save us from their arrogance.

00:18:24.821 --> 00:18:28.352
For God who is Secretary and who is king?

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:34.475
Marathi talk for about 1 minut.

00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:40.127
They are better than you because they do not have the dirt of money.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.769
They do not have any position,

00:19:45.841 --> 00:19:49.277
to make them stupid.

00:19:50.864 --> 00:19:53.222
They just want Mataji.

00:19:54.937 --> 00:19:59.652
Yesterday a few children came. Their mother said, ëlet us goí. They were saying ëlet us stay backí.

00:19:59.968 --> 00:20:05.045
They were not getting any chocolates, nothing. ëWe donít want any cinema, we only want Mataji.

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.936
Letís go to Matajií.

00:20:11.064 --> 00:20:13.460
They know more than you.

00:20:14.873 --> 00:20:16.849
You also become like them.

00:20:17.127 --> 00:20:21.920
Leave everything of the past and become like them. Now you become children.

00:20:26.357 --> 00:20:27.992
How beautiful you are.

00:20:29.389 --> 00:20:31.222
You are also like this, son!

00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:36.492
You were also like this. Now you have all become deformed, disgusting.

00:20:46.032 --> 00:20:48.032
Be worried about it.

00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:50.825
See the beauty of others.

00:20:56.167 --> 00:20:57.547
I will go.

00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:04.015
When the mother is away it becomes the responsibility of children to look after the house.

00:21:09.722 --> 00:21:14.555
When I come back I should see that My children have spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:15.714 --> 00:21:19.466
Otherwise, I will see that someone has a catch of Agnya chakra,

00:21:19.667 --> 00:21:22.704
someone has a problem with the Nabhi chakra, someone has Vishuddhi problem.

00:21:22.905 --> 00:21:26.886
Someone went there... Someone has fallen sick, someone is unwell,

00:21:27.087 --> 00:21:30.608
someoneís wife is in hospital and someone is in a Lunatic Asylum.

00:21:31.151 --> 00:21:32.730
What has happened?

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.056
Donít think that we are small people.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.674
You are a very great person.

00:21:45.072 --> 00:21:49.166
So-called great people are useless, they donít get their realisation.

00:21:52.143 --> 00:21:54.682
You realise your greatness and talk.

00:21:55.072 --> 00:21:57.095
You talk openly.

00:22:01.341 --> 00:22:04.365
If one speaks one letter of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:05.389 --> 00:22:07.998
Goddess Saraswati will come and sit there, I am telling you.

00:22:08.199 --> 00:22:10.952
You speak and see. You will experience it.

00:22:11.404 --> 00:22:15.910
Start talking about Sahaja Yoga, Saraswati will be in your voice,

00:22:16.111 --> 00:22:19.396
you start writing, Saraswati will be in your writing.

00:22:23.848 --> 00:22:26.918
Start any work Hanumana will stand there with folded hands,

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:29.928
Mother tell me, ëwith whom shall I stand?í

00:22:30.206 --> 00:22:32.307
Hanuman Ji is doing all your work.

00:22:32.508 --> 00:22:37.889
Whatever work you take up in the name of Mataji whatever work you take in this world,

00:22:38.286 --> 00:22:40.188
whatever it may be, he will do it.

00:22:40.389 --> 00:22:45.063
For Sahaja Yoga work all the five Chiranjeevis- long lived-are standing by.

00:22:46.889 --> 00:22:50.744
All of them are putting powers behind you and standing in the background.

00:22:50.945 --> 00:22:55.754
And Nat Ji who has come, he is in a bad shape, he is looking here and there.

00:22:58.389 --> 00:23:00.556
How will the play be composed?

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:05.436
We donít want a half-hearted approach.

00:23:06.127 --> 00:23:09.315
ëI donít get time to meditateí. What do you mean I donít get the time?

00:23:09.516 --> 00:23:12.111
For what do you have time?

00:23:12.968 --> 00:23:16.815
Who has given you time? If you donít get time for yourselves, God saves you. How do you not get the time?

00:23:17.016 --> 00:23:18.878
Get up at 4 in the morning.

00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:22.928
You have woken up your Mother. How many hours does She sleep?

00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:25.556
Get up at 4 in the morning.

00:23:26.389 --> 00:23:27.769
Tell your mind,

00:23:28.246 --> 00:23:31.762
I have to meditate from 4 to 5. Throw away the sleep.

00:23:38.675 --> 00:23:41.648
Stop staying awake in the nights, stop talking to useless people.

00:23:41.849 --> 00:23:45.586
Leave worthless associations, leave aside relatives, they are all useless people.

00:23:45.787 --> 00:23:46.886
They are all bhoots.

00:23:47.087 --> 00:23:50.056
Have we come to waste our time for them?

00:23:53.945 --> 00:23:59.571
I donít spend even one moment, you will be surprised, on anything other than Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:00.643 --> 00:24:02.934
Thousands of people come to my husbandís office,

00:24:03.135 --> 00:24:06.617
whenever there is a reception; they all ask for their realisation.

00:24:06.818 --> 00:24:12.714
Shake hands and they ask for realisation! Whichever country I go to, I give realisation.

00:24:14.482 --> 00:24:17.609
They keep talking to me, I give realisation while talking.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.888
I see that they have got realisation in a split second.

00:24:22.159 --> 00:24:24.892
He keeps on talking about so many things.

00:24:26.127 --> 00:24:29.698
Wherever I get an opportunity, I keep giving realisation.

00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:39.888
At Victoria station, there was a ticket collector. He was a Muslim.

00:24:42.945 --> 00:24:47.865
When I was buying the ticket, there was a long queue and I was giving realisation.

00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:50.847
Maybe he was from Pakistan-from wherever he maybe.

00:24:51.048 --> 00:24:53.031
I think he was from Pakistan.

00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:58.775
While standing I was giving realisation and even to others who were standing there, I was giving realisation.

00:24:58.976 --> 00:25:02.276
While he was issuing a ticket to me, he looked at me

00:25:03.072 --> 00:25:06.491
and he got his realisation. So he gave a ticket to all

00:25:06.794 --> 00:25:08.775
and came inside and sat inside my compartment.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.688
I was sitting alone in that compartment.

00:25:12.508 --> 00:25:14.301
He asked Me, ëWho are You?

00:25:14.754 --> 00:25:17.394
Why is there so much attraction in you?

00:25:17.595 --> 00:25:19.285
I asked him, ëwho are you?í

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.619
He said his name was Hussain. I said, ëSit down, Hussain mianí.

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:25.164
I said, ëPut your hand like thisí.

00:25:25.365 --> 00:25:27.458
He said, ëWhat is this cool breeze coming?

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:29.047
Who are you?

00:25:29.913 --> 00:25:31.889
I said, ëSee and recognise.í

00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:38.894
I went to Rome. It is an incident that happened long back.

00:25:39.095 --> 00:25:43.087
Many artists were sitting there. They were painting something.

00:25:43.516 --> 00:25:48.490
Gave realisation to one. He got up, told something to someone and fell at my feet,

00:25:48.691 --> 00:25:54.085
sat, caught hold of both My feet and started crying, saying loudly, ëMother, when did you come?í

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:58.672
I went there as the wife of an officer; three people were standing on this side and four people on that side.

00:25:58.873 --> 00:26:01.196
Those people were embarrassed- what is this man doing?

00:26:01.397 --> 00:26:04.767
He said, ëNo Mother, I found You. I saw You in my dream last night.

00:26:04.968 --> 00:26:09.420
You said you will come wearing a white sari. And you have come wearing thatí.

00:26:12.754 --> 00:26:16.865
Even for one moment, I canít think of anything other than Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:17.127 --> 00:26:22.013
I have forgotten all my past, there have been great lives, they have all become great.

00:26:22.214 --> 00:26:26.615
I have forgotten everything, all the details. I only remember Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:26.816 --> 00:26:28.690
I donít remember anything.

00:26:29.865 --> 00:26:31.561
In the same way,

00:26:31.762 --> 00:26:35.190
every moment you have to think of Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:36.325 --> 00:26:38.386
wherever you are sitting there itself.

00:26:38.587 --> 00:26:40.920
Throw away your watches first.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.498
Throw away slavery to watches.

00:26:44.699 --> 00:26:47.624
Become a slave of Sahaja Yoga,
Sahaja Yoga is your watch.

00:26:47.825 --> 00:26:51.482
It was 12:30, no harm, you were sitting there, it is 3 you were still sitting there.

00:26:51.683 --> 00:26:53.577
You were sitting in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:53.778 --> 00:26:57.341
Is Sahaja Yoga slave of the watch or time?

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.743
We are not slaves of any regulation or law.

00:27:03.077 --> 00:27:05.984
We are only standing in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:06.325 --> 00:27:08.283
Whatever time it may take, we will sit there.

00:27:08.484 --> 00:27:12.172
Wherever we are sitting, we will sit there. Are we slaves to the stomach that we have to eat on time?

00:27:12.373 --> 00:27:14.373
We are not slaves to anything.

00:27:19.181 --> 00:27:21.744
Everything keeps happening, it is going to happen.

00:27:21.945 --> 00:27:25.452
First of all, you leave your slavery of everything, whatever old slavery is there leave it.

00:27:25.653 --> 00:27:27.853
First of all, throw away watches.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.759
No system has been made for anything.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.609
No system can be made in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.617
Its own systems are being made, let them be made.

00:27:37.818 --> 00:27:41.198
If you make the system, that will be hailed.

00:27:42.087 --> 00:27:44.087
Donít enforce discipline.

00:27:47.556 --> 00:27:49.728
Let its discipline be working inside.

00:27:49.929 --> 00:27:53.863
Yes, those who have not got their realisation, discipline is required; you enforce it.

00:27:54.064 --> 00:27:58.833
But those who are realised, they have to enforce discipline inside them.

00:27:59.548 --> 00:28:01.889
The discipline will happen inside by itself.

00:28:10.318 --> 00:28:12.893
Sahaja Yogi has an inner discipline.

00:28:13.094 --> 00:28:16.268
But if there is indiscipline here, it canít be forgiven.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.823
But one who is not a Sahaja Yogi, forgive him because he does not know what discipline is.

00:28:21.024 --> 00:28:24.198
He knows worldly discipline enforced through ëthe caneí.

00:28:27.127 --> 00:28:31.093
Let the Sahaja Yogi get the discipline from within, let him be awakened from within.

00:28:31.294 --> 00:28:34.666
Look at its discipline with which you are moving.

00:28:35.159 --> 00:28:39.150
You are moving your limbs with its discipline, with its waves.

00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:42.658
Who has enforced discipline on the oceanís waves?

00:28:43.691 --> 00:28:49.107
Sitting here you can tell the time of high tide and low tide in London.

00:28:49.308 --> 00:28:53.904
Who has enforced its discipline?
You are trying to enforce someone elseís!?

00:28:55.349 --> 00:28:57.881
Learn to get into its discipline.

00:29:00.222 --> 00:29:03.650
Learn to grow with its signals and its mechanism.

00:29:05.095 --> 00:29:07.095
Its machine is working.

00:29:08.564 --> 00:29:10.564
Donít make any of your own.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:16.847
Just say, ëlet us get into Sahaja Yoga, Let us go, let us invest time in Sahaja Yogaí.

00:29:17.048 --> 00:29:19.307
If you wear a watch, it is for Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:19.508 --> 00:29:23.055
If you put an alarm, it should be for Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:26.294 --> 00:29:27.523
(marathi)

00:29:31.659 --> 00:29:32.825
See this,

00:29:33.452 --> 00:29:37.285
this age and this is Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:39.699 --> 00:29:40.888
(marathi)

00:30:13.819 --> 00:30:18.493
Not even a leaf in this world can move without its discipline.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.319
Become one with it; get into its harmony

00:30:25.905 --> 00:30:28.706
Get fully harmonised with it;

00:30:29.865 --> 00:30:33.577
when it rises you rise when it falls you fall.

00:30:33.778 --> 00:30:37.841
If we make something of our own, we will not be in touch with it.

00:30:38.048 --> 00:30:40.293
You mold yourself with that.

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:43.378
It can happen only with Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:43.579 --> 00:30:48.053
It can not happen with anything else, it canít happen with any earthly thing of the world.

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:55.444
There is only one way, I have told you thousands of times, I am telling you again and again;

00:30:56.182 --> 00:31:03.642
your fortress is ëNirvicharita (thoughtlessness).

00:31:06.664 --> 00:31:10.212
Find out in Nirvicharita. You will know everything.

00:31:10.413 --> 00:31:14.015
Whatever you have to do, go into Nirvicharita.

00:31:15.547 --> 00:31:18.744
Do all worldly things in Nirvicharita,

00:31:18.945 --> 00:31:22.317
you will see that it becomes dynamic.

00:31:24.762 --> 00:31:28.958
Who has seen the blooming of flowers, who has seen fruits growing,

00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:33.389
who has seen the execution of all the worldly work? It is happening;

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:37.222
you are moving in the same dynamism, in the same living thing.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.381
It is coming from Nirvicharita, is nít it?

00:31:43.143 --> 00:31:47.055
You sit in that place, from where the whole world blooms.

00:31:49.262 --> 00:31:53.555
Make a habit of Nirvicharita, try to be always in thoughtlessness.

00:31:53.905 --> 00:31:58.904
All the work of this world happens through that and yours also will happen.

00:31:59.262 --> 00:32:01.262
All useless things will happen,

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.222
but you have to operate the inner system yourself.

00:32:07.206 --> 00:32:10.857
There is no age problem;

00:32:11.349 --> 00:32:12.579
no one is old.

00:32:12.857 --> 00:32:16.389
You are just born, maybe two or four years.

00:32:18.365 --> 00:32:20.365
You are all small babies.

00:32:22.362 --> 00:32:24.362
There is no issue of age.

00:32:29.206 --> 00:32:32.064
You have to be in Nirvicharita.

00:32:33.175 --> 00:32:37.396
This is your place,

00:32:40.008 --> 00:32:42.008
this is your wealth,

00:32:42.683 --> 00:32:45.952
this is your strength, this is your power,

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.960
this is your form,

00:32:54.095 --> 00:32:56.095
this is your beauty,

00:32:56.984 --> 00:32:58.857
this is your life,

00:33:00.564 --> 00:33:02.056
Nirvichar.

00:33:05.699 --> 00:33:10.135
As soon as you become thoughtless, the machine outside

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:24.890
starts to fully spin in your hands.

00:33:28.137 --> 00:33:30.152
Be in thoughtlessness.

00:33:30.587 --> 00:33:32.291
There, there is no time,

00:33:32.492 --> 00:33:33.873
no direction,

00:33:34.587 --> 00:33:36.918
nor anyone can touch you.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.722
You will get to see the life process, how life blooms.

00:33:44.111 --> 00:33:47.744
You will see its beauty, its ability.

00:33:47.945 --> 00:33:51.722
Its opulence, its truth;

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:56.678
gaze from the place where the stream of life flows.

00:34:05.905 --> 00:34:07.793
But becoming ill-advised,

00:34:08.048 --> 00:34:10.048
becoming a fool,

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:15.944
how will it show to you?!

00:34:16.627 --> 00:34:18.627
Or heart becoming empty,

00:34:19.856 --> 00:34:21.317
loveless,

00:34:21.714 --> 00:34:23.056
selfish,

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.124
self-centered,

00:34:25.325 --> 00:34:27.095
thinking about oneself,

00:34:28.421 --> 00:34:30.421
thinking big of oneself,

00:34:30.754 --> 00:34:33.373
how can it show you the path?

00:34:34.722 --> 00:34:36.611
Being ugly,

00:34:37.714 --> 00:34:39.388
torturing.

00:34:40.802 --> 00:34:44.889
How much beauty should be there in the movement and speed of Sahaja Yoga?

00:34:45.666 --> 00:34:49.056
When you are doing it, there should be reverence.

00:34:49.564 --> 00:34:52.680
When you are raising the Kundalini, there should be spirituality in your hands;

00:34:52.881 --> 00:34:57.928
you are worshipping someoneís Kundalini, someoneís mother.

00:34:58.857 --> 00:35:01.904
How much respect you should have?

00:35:02.746 --> 00:35:04.624
How much thought you should give.

00:35:04.825 --> 00:35:07.259
In everything, in your behaviour,

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.174
in your language,

00:35:09.778 --> 00:35:11.381
in your speech,

00:35:11.667 --> 00:35:15.047
in your laughter, in your caress,

00:35:16.778 --> 00:35:23.142
in your crying, in everything you do, your heart should be seen,

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.743
vastness should be seen,

00:35:26.944 --> 00:35:28.944
the sky should be seen.

00:35:29.428 --> 00:35:33.285
A glimpse of the purity of water should be seen inside you.

00:35:35.939 --> 00:35:38.228
The glow of the sun should be seen on your face,

00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:41.857
the coolness of the moon should flow from you.

00:35:50.429 --> 00:35:53.222
Like the air, you should be outgoing.

00:35:55.643 --> 00:35:58.680
Your life is pulsating in the lives of all,

00:35:58.881 --> 00:36:02.370
realise this and donít play with your life.

00:36:08.413 --> 00:36:13.416
Be very reverent and devoted and accept it with humility,

00:36:14.897 --> 00:36:19.119
the new life which is being poured into us by Paramatma.

00:36:23.191 --> 00:36:26.262
Accept its love

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:29.452
and compassion.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:36.720
Just there is no need for taking a bath, no need for washing hands,

00:36:36.921 --> 00:36:40.924
nothing is required. Only the cleanliness of the heart is required. Clean your heart.

00:36:41.125 --> 00:36:45.394
Pray, ëGod clean my heartí. Give up your deceit and guile.

00:36:45.595 --> 00:36:49.785
Clean your heart. You are to get into the lotus of the heart.

00:36:50.873 --> 00:36:52.627
Clean your heart.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.230
Is my heart clean?

00:36:57.254 --> 00:37:00.444
Who are you cheating, who are you telling lies to?

00:37:05.008 --> 00:37:06.714
You are all one.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.736
I can never say to one person only.

00:37:09.937 --> 00:37:14.194
I am speaking to each one of you that you are all in one body;

00:37:15.476 --> 00:37:18.889
and that too in my body. You are my projection.

00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:21.199
I am telling myself.

00:37:21.722 --> 00:37:24.952
o whom else shall I say? Who is the other?

00:37:25.237 --> 00:37:29.889
When you are sick, I feel pain within just like I myself have got sick.

00:37:31.206 --> 00:37:35.569
And when you are happy then I feel tremendous joy just like I have myself become happy.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.166
When you are unhappy then I too donít enjoy any joy.

00:37:39.428 --> 00:37:42.222
I keep awake night and day for you.

00:37:52.889 --> 00:37:54.886
Whatever or whichever way you can do,

00:37:55.087 --> 00:37:57.409
one must give time,

00:37:58.889 --> 00:38:00.809
give full time.

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:07.063
Now we are going to make an ashram, so the ones who have money can give money.

00:38:07.286 --> 00:38:09.815
You will have to give. You spend money here and there.

00:38:10.016 --> 00:38:12.569
Of what use has it been your spending money here and there.

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.490
I donít need your money.

00:38:14.691 --> 00:38:15.759
I need nothing.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.569
I donít need to spend anywhere. This ashram is being made for you,

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:21.918
your brothers and sisters, who are going to live there.

00:38:22.119 --> 00:38:23.719
Now these realized children are being born,

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.722
they need a school and someone who can look after them.

00:38:28.064 --> 00:38:29.635
Give money for that.

00:38:31.294 --> 00:38:33.117
How will the money come?

00:38:33.318 --> 00:38:36.556
Any money that comes from you is very important.

00:38:39.952 --> 00:38:43.474
Such people come here who do not want to spend even one rupee.

00:38:43.675 --> 00:38:46.411
There are not such poor people here

00:38:47.729 --> 00:38:50.054
- if that is the case then it is alright.

00:38:50.404 --> 00:38:55.174
But those who cannot give even one rupee can such people be Sahaja Yogis?

00:38:56.087 --> 00:39:00.793
I get really amazed that they trouble for giving one rupee or five rupees!

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:08.468
When you have money, you donate, you have to give in thousands,

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:10.810
in tens of thousands.

00:39:11.736 --> 00:39:13.995
Who has given you this money?

00:39:18.778 --> 00:39:20.113
I donít want it.

00:39:21.024 --> 00:39:22.754
What need do I have?

00:39:23.413 --> 00:39:25.309
Please give it to yourself.

00:39:25.564 --> 00:39:27.244
Give for your well being.

00:39:27.445 --> 00:39:31.063
You will live in those ashrams with your kith and kin, I know.

00:39:34.619 --> 00:39:38.396
You do not have to live on freebies, live like a king.

00:39:40.222 --> 00:39:43.490
I donít eat for free, you should also not eat for free.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.781
Whatever you can contribute, contribute.

00:39:45.981 --> 00:39:49.444
If you have time, spare your time, if you can put in some hard work, do it.

00:39:50.587 --> 00:39:54.809
If you can awaken Kundalini, do it if you can give realisation, give it. If you can remove bhoots, remove bhoots.

00:39:55.016 --> 00:39:56.658
Contribute to Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:56.859 --> 00:40:01.418
If you donít do it, your ego is not going to die,

00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:03.775
your superego is not going to run away.

00:40:03.976 --> 00:40:06.680
Till you do something for Sahaja Yoga, it will again bother you.

00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:10.712
Mother my head is caught up, Mother my daughter ran away,

00:40:10.913 --> 00:40:13.505
Mataji, this happened to my fatherí. It will happen.

00:40:13.706 --> 00:40:15.389
I donít do anything.

00:40:17.738 --> 00:40:19.738
Ganas also donít do anything.

00:40:20.484 --> 00:40:24.101
The bhoots will catch your weakness. They donít trouble Me.

00:40:24.302 --> 00:40:26.556
Do you know why they donít catch Me?

00:40:30.706 --> 00:40:33.545
ëWhat has Mataji given me, Mataji has so much to himí.

00:40:33.746 --> 00:40:37.087
He had to get so much. He got it.

00:40:41.957 --> 00:40:46.556
What you got also is not less. You donít value what you got.

00:40:47.214 --> 00:40:49.556
You should be satisfied within.

00:40:50.603 --> 00:40:54.460
Catch hold of satisfaction from inside. Establish yourself on that satisfaction.

00:40:55.881 --> 00:40:57.833
How should I tell you this,

00:40:58.135 --> 00:41:00.545
there is a computer for this, it has points.

00:41:00.746 --> 00:41:03.664
If you press one finger, your satisfaction will be awakened,

00:41:03.865 --> 00:41:07.505
if you press one finger your innocence will be awakened,

00:41:07.706 --> 00:41:09.339
if you press one finger truth will be awakened.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:14.227
This is all inside you, by pressing the fingers like this, the entire program can be set.

00:41:14.428 --> 00:41:16.754
Shri Mataji keeps doing this.

00:41:21.389 --> 00:41:25.023
In the first place, there should be innocence there.

00:41:26.524 --> 00:41:28.521
There should be some satisfaction there,

00:41:28.722 --> 00:41:31.521
otherwise, you press the finger, what will come out from there-vacuum?!

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.412
There is nothing inside.

00:41:33.714 --> 00:41:37.889
One who has added satisfaction, he will reach satisfaction.

00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:41.000
We are sitting in satisfaction at this time.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:45.307
We have reached righteousness. We are sitting in righteousness at this time.

00:41:45.508 --> 00:41:47.966
All have accumulated wealth

00:41:48.167 --> 00:41:51.920
after burning the body for years and now it is present before you.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.182
Like this, you have to keep adding everything,

00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:09.539
add satisfaction, a lot of it.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.769
Satisfaction.

00:42:16.945 --> 00:42:18.571
Come into innocence,

00:42:19.365 --> 00:42:21.767
come into righteousness. Come into the truth,

00:42:21.968 --> 00:42:23.722
come into the beauty,

00:42:24.032 --> 00:42:25.373
Come into love,

00:42:26.103 --> 00:42:28.190
you have a button for everything.

00:42:32.072 --> 00:42:33.831
How will it happen, how to do it?

00:42:34.032 --> 00:42:36.045
Sahaja Yoga does nít have to do it. It all happens.

00:42:36.246 --> 00:42:39.331
There is no such word like ëHow?í in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:40.682 --> 00:42:43.244
You can earn whatever you want to be inside you.

00:42:43.445 --> 00:42:45.863
If you want satisfaction, you can earn satisfaction.

00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:48.188
You can earn everything and keep inside.

00:42:48.389 --> 00:42:51.775
Press a button and you will keep getting what you want.

00:42:51.976 --> 00:42:54.563
A machine will manifest inside you.

00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:12.027
I donít know how you will earn these.

00:43:14.882 --> 00:43:16.603
You add your earning!

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:18.892
You add your earning!

00:43:19.206 --> 00:43:20.206
Good.

00:43:20.889 --> 00:43:21.889
Yes.

00:43:22.119 --> 00:43:24.385
Let us now go into Meditation.
