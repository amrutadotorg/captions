00:02.160 --> 00:06.035
Yesterday one boy stood up and asked Me a question,

00:06.545 --> 00:08.921
that "When we are such a yoga bhoomi,

00:09.462 --> 00:11.462
we are such a holy country,

00:11.962 --> 00:14.587
why is it that all the discoveries in the science

00:14.850 --> 00:16.147
are made in the West?"

00:16.343 --> 00:18.009
"Very good question," I said.

00:18.462 --> 00:21.379
I said, "That is the knowledge of the tree,

00:21.587 --> 00:23.712
as I have told you; that's the knowledge of the tree.

00:24.003 --> 00:26.462
And what have they achieved is now the end of it,

00:26.712 --> 00:29.587
and now they want to know the knowledge of the roots.

00:30.545 --> 00:31.962
That's why they are here."

00:32.462 --> 00:34.128
So to know the knowledge of the roots,

00:34.462 --> 00:36.587
first of all we must have humility about it.

00:36.921 --> 00:39.003
We have not known this knowledge yet,

00:39.337 --> 00:42.837
never known what is in the Kingdom of God.

00:43.087 --> 00:46.587
As Krishna has said, this tree grows downward

00:47.253 --> 00:50.253
and the roots are in the brain - clearly.

00:50.837 --> 00:53.837
So it is an ascent to go to the roots,

00:54.128 --> 00:55.337
it's a different style.

00:55.671 --> 00:58.462
Kundalini has to rise upward to go to the roots,

00:58.796 --> 01:01.337
and to enter into the roots

01:04.212 --> 01:07.420
what we have to do is to know about it.

01:08.128 --> 01:10.337
Now all these things, like I said yesterday

01:10.671 --> 01:12.545
that you put on bindi.

01:12.921 --> 01:16.337
Now this is also - thank God,

01:16.545 --> 01:18.128
despite all changes in the Bible,

01:18.420 --> 01:19.462
it's written in the Bible

01:19.796 --> 01:21.796
that you'll be known by the mark you'll be carrying.

01:22.003 --> 01:24.128
Now let's see how many are courageous, even in India,

01:24.420 --> 01:25.671
to carry this mark.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.671
That's why you people catch so fast,

01:27.962 --> 01:29.337
one of the reasons why you people catch.

01:29.671 --> 01:31.671
First of all the eyes are not steady.

01:32.003 --> 01:34.212
You are not used to the steady eyes, you see,

01:34.462 --> 01:35.837
as the Indians have very steady eyes.

01:36.128 --> 01:38.003
They are, from childhood they are taught,

01:38.337 --> 01:39.921
"Where is your attention?"

01:40.253 --> 01:42.921
All the time they are asked, "Where is your attention?"

01:43.671 --> 01:46.212
There are some Western Sahaja yogis standing at the back.

01:46.587 --> 01:49.128
Please give them a chair to sit,

01:49.462 --> 01:52.921
since they are not able to sit on the ground.

01:54.253 --> 01:55.629
So where is your attention?

01:56.045 --> 01:59.170
Now the attention is so disturbed all the time

01:59.629 --> 02:01.420
and that's why you catch very fast,

02:01.754 --> 02:03.295
and when you catch from your eyes,

02:03.629 --> 02:05.379
it goes through your Agnya Chakra.

02:05.712 --> 02:07.961
Now this is the protection of Agnya Chakra;

02:08.170 --> 02:10.879
it's actually the blood of Christ that you wear.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.545
But people must have that courage.

02:12.754 --> 02:14.754
They'll wear a cross, but not this.

02:15.796 --> 02:17.295
In the Western countries it's very difficult

02:17.545 --> 02:20.087
for people to have that much courage to put on this.

02:20.337 --> 02:21.295
They will have excuses,

02:21.545 --> 02:23.629
"Mother, we'll lose our jobs," this, that.

02:23.921 --> 02:25.545
Every sort of an excuse is there.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.796
But if you are courageous people,

02:28.087 --> 02:30.504
then you have to start wearing it some time.

02:30.796 --> 02:34.212
Maybe in the night you start first, then in the daytime.

02:34.921 --> 02:36.879
Slowly, slowly you can creep into it.

02:37.170 --> 02:39.879
That's the only thing I think you people have to wear

02:40.170 --> 02:41.671
- that's important.

02:41.962 --> 02:44.212
That will be a good idea, because you will not catch.

02:44.462 --> 02:46.337
Because you go outside, your attention is outside,

02:46.671 --> 02:49.337
you see what's happening outside, the atmosphere is bad.

02:49.671 --> 02:52.796
Moreover, if you put this on it will not only protect you,

02:53.087 --> 02:55.462
but also protect others.

02:56.295 --> 02:57.879
They will have a new idea.

02:58.170 --> 03:00.045
After all, you will dress up like them,

03:00.337 --> 03:01.962
you are just like them - you have to be.

03:02.420 --> 03:03.671
But you have to protect,

03:03.879 --> 03:06.295
and for protection you have to wear something like that.

03:06.545 --> 03:08.879
I found that when I went first to England

03:09.170 --> 03:11.921
they used to laugh at Me, looking at My red mark.

03:12.212 --> 03:14.045
I mean, if they wear lipsticks it's all right,

03:14.295 --> 03:17.045
even if they are clowns, if they are hippies,

03:17.295 --> 03:20.629
they are punks, it's all right;

03:20.921 --> 03:23.420
but if you wear a proper thing which is scientific,

03:23.796 --> 03:24.796
it's most scientific.

03:25.003 --> 03:26.921
So to understand the science of the roots

03:27.337 --> 03:29.337
you must understand what it means,

03:29.587 --> 03:31.295
why this culture is like this:

03:31.545 --> 03:34.545
because it is more towards the roots,

03:35.128 --> 03:36.921
the movement is not towards the tree.

03:37.212 --> 03:38.962
And the tree, where it has ended up?

03:39.128 --> 03:41.462
Beyond the Mooladhara Chakra.

03:42.128 --> 03:43.921
So now they are returning back.

03:44.212 --> 03:46.587
To go from the leaf to the roots is very difficult,

03:46.921 --> 03:49.962
but to go from the roots to the leaves is easier.

03:51.879 --> 03:54.796
So for this ascent we have to be humble,

03:55.212 --> 03:58.754
to know about the knowledge - knowledge about the roots.

03:59.045 --> 04:03.170
Now why they put on, all of them, is this is the reason,

04:03.879 --> 04:07.087
that to protect your Agnya. First of all there's no entry.

04:07.337 --> 04:11.420
That's why, once an Indian gets realization, he ascends.

04:12.545 --> 04:14.420
He doesn't go on catching again;

04:14.754 --> 04:17.879
I mean, this doesn't happen here.

04:19.504 --> 04:21.629
This is one of the things one has to do.

04:21.921 --> 04:23.545
Now the second thing is the puja.

04:23.879 --> 04:27.962
The puja has its effect on everyone,

04:28.212 --> 04:29.545
but according to your depth;

04:29.879 --> 04:32.420
and that's for that you have to have shraddha, faith.

04:32.671 --> 04:34.504
If your mind is still thinking,

04:34.796 --> 04:36.921
you cannot achieve much in puja.

04:37.170 --> 04:40.212
While for Indians, to attend a puja is the highest.

04:40.504 --> 04:42.545
They don't mind My lecture, anything;

04:42.837 --> 04:44.045
if they miss the program, doesn't matter,

04:44.295 --> 04:45.712
any music program is all right,

04:46.045 --> 04:48.420
any kind of discomfort is all right

04:48.671 --> 04:50.253
- as long as they can attend to puja.

04:50.504 --> 04:51.879
Today people have come

04:52.170 --> 04:54.420
from two hundred to three hundred miles for this puja,

04:54.712 --> 04:56.629
all the way,

04:57.337 --> 05:00.879
because they know this is the knowledge of the roots.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.671
For that you have to do the puja.

05:02.962 --> 05:04.671
If you have to ascend, you have to do it.

05:04.921 --> 05:07.212
But you are still in the same level;

05:07.545 --> 05:11.504
if you are still thinking about the tree style,

05:11.754 --> 05:13.087
then you'll go downward.

05:13.420 --> 05:17.045
To move inward, you have to have all these instruments.

05:17.337 --> 05:19.629
One of them is of puja.

05:19.962 --> 05:23.879
Now for puja, are we prepared?

05:24.962 --> 05:26.504
Are we in that mind,

05:26.754 --> 05:29.504
whatever time it has to start, will start?

05:29.754 --> 05:32.212
First of all, we have tied our watches quite tight.

05:32.504 --> 05:35.045
Thank God, I lost My watch last night!

05:41.879 --> 05:47.212
So now the watches have tied us up so much

05:47.545 --> 05:50.629
that now eleven o'clock puja means eleven o'clock.

05:50.961 --> 05:54.045
It's not like that - it depends on.

05:55.087 --> 05:58.796
It is the natural growth of our being,

05:59.170 --> 06:01.671
it is the natural working of our growing.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.545
When I came here, you'll be amazed,

06:03.796 --> 06:06.671
all My right side was paralyzed, absolutely paralyzed.

06:07.087 --> 06:09.629
Right foot was paralyzed, I just couldn't move My legs,

06:09.879 --> 06:14.671
and all the feet had become like a fossilized stuff,

06:14.962 --> 06:17.045
and I didn't know what was happening.

06:17.504 --> 06:21.045
The reason is, everybody has been thinking too much.

06:21.337 --> 06:24.087
Now the attention should be how we are,

06:24.379 --> 06:27.420
what are we doing about ourselves, that's very important;

06:27.754 --> 06:29.045
how far we have achieved.

06:29.295 --> 06:33.087
But on the contrary, the attention is disturbed

06:33.295 --> 06:36.629
by many things. One of them may be the marriages,

06:36.962 --> 06:38.796
that marriages have to take place,

06:39.087 --> 06:40.671
what's going to happen and all that.

06:40.961 --> 06:43.879
But at puja time it has no meaning.

06:44.087 --> 06:47.961
Nothing has importance than but to develop yourself,

06:48.212 --> 06:49.295
and this is what it is:

06:49.545 --> 06:52.295
at this time you have to develop your roots.

06:52.671 --> 06:53.962
And to develop your roots,

06:54.295 --> 06:56.504
it's a different science altogether.

06:56.961 --> 07:00.961
The another thing is that you can achieve

07:02.879 --> 07:07.337
the movement of the tree by aggressiveness, by aggressing.

07:08.170 --> 07:11.045
But when you aggress in the human mind,

07:11.295 --> 07:14.545
then you are drawn towards the Mooladhara more,

07:14.796 --> 07:17.629
towards the gravity force,

07:17.962 --> 07:20.170
and you go down towards the dead;

07:20.420 --> 07:22.420
the materialism starts coming up.

07:22.671 --> 07:26.629
Because it's upside down, human growth is upside down.

07:26.879 --> 07:29.796
You know the brain is here, not at the feet.

07:30.545 --> 07:33.087
It starts from the brain, the growth starts from the brain;

07:33.337 --> 07:35.961
as you know as doctors that the whole thing is here

07:36.212 --> 07:39.962
and the nerves go down, they do not start from the feet.

07:40.295 --> 07:43.504
So when you start putting your attention to your

07:43.754 --> 07:46.962
outward growth, you go towards materialism automatically.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.295
Then you find matter has nothing to do,

07:49.629 --> 07:52.379
you have fossilized yourself. So then you come back.

07:52.629 --> 07:55.379
Now you have to change your attitude completely

07:55.671 --> 07:57.087
towards this new learning,

07:57.420 --> 08:00.629
and this new learning is that you have to

08:00.962 --> 08:03.879
develop a humble attitude, first of all.

08:04.170 --> 08:07.962
And secondly, what are we going to achieve

08:08.629 --> 08:13.754
in our ascent through learning the different tantra,

08:14.045 --> 08:18.671
the mechanism, the divine mechanism - how to work it out.

08:19.961 --> 08:23.754
The person who is extremely efficient in the other field

08:23.962 --> 08:26.420
might become completely inefficient in this field,

08:26.671 --> 08:32.379
absolutely useless: possessed, aggressive, good for nothing,

08:32.671 --> 08:38.420
hot-tempered, hot-tempered, and also devoid of any love,

08:38.671 --> 08:40.212
affection, compassion.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.170
Like they were shocked to hear

08:43.337 --> 08:45.629
that people kill their children in England,

08:45.879 --> 08:46.962
they couldn't believe it.

08:47.212 --> 08:48.962
They can't believe even one child killed like that.

08:49.170 --> 08:51.337
They think that English are perfect people,

08:51.671 --> 08:53.045
how can they kill their children?

08:53.337 --> 08:55.962
They are very perfect according to Indians.

08:56.212 --> 08:59.962
Indians have no idea as to what kind of life they lead there.

09:00.337 --> 09:01.545
So when I told them,

09:01.796 --> 09:03.962
"You are sadly mistaken, they are very unhappy people.

09:04.295 --> 09:07.003
Don't think that by developing radios and all these things,

09:07.295 --> 09:09.045
they are happy. They are all mad.

09:09.295 --> 09:10.754
They sit before the television,

09:10.962 --> 09:14.170
then they can't do without it, they become televisions.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.045
And the television is exploiting them,

09:16.295 --> 09:17.962
putting wrong ideas into their heads,

09:18.295 --> 09:21.045
and they're brainwashed, they are very conditioned"

09:21.379 --> 09:22.420
- they can't believe it.

09:22.671 --> 09:24.961
They can't believe that people could be that cruel

09:25.170 --> 09:28.961
in the West; because the growth is towards materialism,

09:29.170 --> 09:33.879
so they are becoming gross, insensitive, immoral,

09:34.170 --> 09:38.629
and also devoid of any compassion and love.

09:39.796 --> 09:42.545
So first of all, as I said yesterday you should say,

09:42.754 --> 09:44.961
"I'm not French" - you should say, "I am not a Westerner."

09:45.170 --> 09:47.754
Let's see, that may work out, work out better,

09:47.962 --> 09:51.295
"I'm not a Westerner." Maybe when you enter a university

09:51.504 --> 09:53.087
- supposing you are in Oxford University

09:53.379 --> 09:54.671
and then you go to the Cambridge University,

09:54.879 --> 09:58.212
you have to wear the badge of the Cambridge University.

09:58.504 --> 10:01.212
In the same way now you have changed your nationality,

10:01.504 --> 10:03.961
I think you should say, "I'm not a Westerner now anymore."

10:04.170 --> 10:07.420
Maybe the passport might say anything, doesn't matter.

10:08.170 --> 10:10.961
But you have a special privilege in India as Sahaja yogis,

10:11.170 --> 10:13.045
you know that. As Sahaja yogis the government

10:13.295 --> 10:15.295
has accepted you. If you want to stay here forever,

10:15.629 --> 10:18.170
they'll have no objection.

10:37.420 --> 10:44.212
So this, whatever is now we think works out

10:44.671 --> 10:47.212
on the tree level, has to be changed.

10:47.629 --> 10:51.212
Here everything becomes united, synthesized.

10:51.545 --> 10:55.045
The whole tree is synthesized in a seed.

10:55.295 --> 10:56.962
So if you have to become the root,

10:57.212 --> 10:59.087
you have to come down to the position where,

10:59.379 --> 11:03.045
how to synthesize. Now grouping is a wrong thing.

11:03.379 --> 11:05.879
If you group yourself as English, this, that,

11:06.087 --> 11:08.045
or Indians or anything, is wrong.

11:08.379 --> 11:10.671
In Sahaja Yoga we don't believe in all that.

11:10.961 --> 11:13.420
There is no differentiation

11:13.754 --> 11:16.087
between one Sahaja yogi and another Sahaja yogi,

11:16.295 --> 11:17.754
because it is Vishwa Dharma.

11:17.961 --> 11:19.420
But we say this is Vishwa Dharma,

11:19.754 --> 11:21.961
but we are not out of it as yet,

11:22.087 --> 11:27.837
we are not yet in the same pendal where we should be.

11:28.045 --> 11:30.629
We still separate, we are still different,

11:30.961 --> 11:34.629
we have to still mix up from one country to another country.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.420
We have to all become one with each other,

11:37.671 --> 11:39.962
understanding each other;

11:40.837 --> 11:43.170
then only the problems of the West will go away.

11:43.420 --> 11:46.545
As a result of this right-sided movement

11:46.837 --> 11:49.671
I feel that people are really becoming idiotic.

11:49.962 --> 11:54.087
I categorize them as idiotic or stupid, and all that.

11:54.379 --> 11:55.504
I mean I don't how,

11:55.754 --> 11:57.879
what categories they will fall into later on,

11:58.170 --> 12:01.087
where there have been not such categories before.

12:01.379 --> 12:05.045
I mean, they might form a new dimension of stupidity.

12:05.962 --> 12:07.420
This is what I feel,

12:07.754 --> 12:11.879
that unless and until you now learn about this new yantra,

12:12.170 --> 12:13.170
the new method:

12:13.420 --> 12:15.962
in that you don't see to the physical comfort,

12:16.253 --> 12:18.837
you don't see to the so-called emotional pampering.

12:19.170 --> 12:20.671
All these things you don't see,

12:20.961 --> 12:23.545
but where do you go - into innocence.

12:24.295 --> 12:28.629
The quality of the matter itself is innocence, the essence.

12:28.961 --> 12:31.170
So the quality, I should say,

12:31.420 --> 12:33.879
or the essence of everything you become.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.087
You become the essence.

12:35.420 --> 12:36.962
But for that you have to move inward,

12:37.253 --> 12:39.379
and the inward movement is only possible

12:39.629 --> 12:42.504
when you understand and respect,

12:42.837 --> 12:48.379
and think yourself privileged to be able to do all this.

12:48.961 --> 12:50.961
But you have to understand why I tell you.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.962
I have nothing to gain out of you.

12:53.295 --> 12:55.504
Now one should not think I'm trying to make you Indians,

12:55.754 --> 12:59.420
but supposing you wear here three-piece suit and a tie,

12:59.754 --> 13:00.671
what will happen to you?

13:00.961 --> 13:04.045
I mean, you'll all get boils in the body.

13:05.087 --> 13:07.170
According to the climate you have to change,

13:07.504 --> 13:09.045
and you enjoy this dress very much

13:09.295 --> 13:10.837
because it is very comfortable.

13:11.087 --> 13:13.504
You enjoy the river baths, it's very comfortable.

13:13.837 --> 13:15.837
In this country that suits you better.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.170
So in the same way this new life that we are entering in,

13:19.504 --> 13:23.253
we have to understand that the outside is not important

13:23.504 --> 13:25.045
- the inside is important.

13:25.295 --> 13:27.295
And for that whatever is to be done outside,

13:27.545 --> 13:29.754
we have to do it, we have to do it.

13:29.962 --> 13:31.504
We have to learn it, we have to understand it,

13:31.754 --> 13:33.712
what is this, what is that.

13:34.128 --> 13:37.504
Now because you are scientists, you are Westerners,

13:37.879 --> 13:40.837
you have an advantage over Indians I should say,

13:41.128 --> 13:42.629
or in science, all right.

13:42.961 --> 13:44.754
In this science they have an advantage over you.

13:44.962 --> 13:46.962
Doesn't matter, it's all right.

13:47.295 --> 13:49.379
They chose this place to come in,

13:49.629 --> 13:51.045
you chose that place to come in;

13:51.295 --> 13:53.295
because you're brave people I think, first of all,

13:53.712 --> 13:57.045
and secondly that you wanted to do some good there maybe.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.712
But for that you must learn.

13:59.962 --> 14:02.962
Like we say our scientists here are brave people

14:03.295 --> 14:04.961
that they are trying to learn science,

14:05.170 --> 14:06.879
they want to go abroad and learn about it

14:07.170 --> 14:08.879
and bring some science to us.

14:09.170 --> 14:12.837
In the same way now you are the ambassadors

14:13.128 --> 14:15.128
from all these countries, of divinity,

14:15.504 --> 14:18.128
ambassadors of divinity. You have to carry divinity,

14:18.420 --> 14:21.379
because it has been worked out in this country.

14:21.629 --> 14:24.045
As you can see clearly it is so, accept it;

14:24.295 --> 14:26.253
there's nothing to feel bad about it.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.545
Because you're attached to a certain nationality

14:28.754 --> 14:30.879
and all that you think, there's nothing to feel bad.

14:31.128 --> 14:32.420
In India people feel very proud

14:32.712 --> 14:35.504
if they have to go abroad to learn science.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.712
Even if they are vegetarians,

14:37.962 --> 14:39.837
they don't mind doing biology dissection

14:40.045 --> 14:42.754
or anything because it is science, it is knowledge.

14:42.961 --> 14:45.587
So for knowledge's sake you have to do all these things.

14:45.837 --> 14:47.754
And once you realize that for knowledge's sake

14:47.962 --> 14:52.420
you are working it out, it's going to help you a lot.

14:53.712 --> 14:57.379
This one, this today's puja, it has a special meaning

14:57.629 --> 15:00.045
because yesterday was Datta Jayanti,

15:00.379 --> 15:04.837
means the birth of Dattatreya.

15:06.420 --> 15:08.170
And you know the story of Dattatreya,

15:08.504 --> 15:10.045
most of you know the story of Dattatreya,

15:10.379 --> 15:14.295
that Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha tried to take a test

15:14.587 --> 15:19.170
of Adi Shakti, called Anasuya.

15:20.879 --> 15:25.420
They came to Her place and asked Her for alms.

15:25.712 --> 15:28.379
And it's supposed to be a great privilege in India

15:28.712 --> 15:30.754
to give alms to others,

15:31.128 --> 15:35.754
to - I mean, it's a great privilege to attend to guests,

15:36.128 --> 15:38.420
it's a great privilege to be generous,

15:38.754 --> 15:41.879
it's a great privilege to distribute things to others.

15:42.170 --> 15:43.045
It's a great privilege.

15:43.295 --> 15:46.295
Like yesterday, you see, My sari for this puja

15:46.629 --> 15:47.754
was left somewhere out.

15:48.003 --> 15:50.962
So I had bought a sari for some lady here, so she said,

15:51.253 --> 15:53.879
"I would like this sari to be presented at the puja."

15:54.170 --> 15:55.295
But I said, "I'll return it you."

15:55.504 --> 15:57.045
She said, "That's a greater privilege, too."

15:57.295 --> 15:58.962
They didn't mind the sari was left out,

15:59.253 --> 16:01.879
they said it's a greater privilege - the attitude.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.587
So the attitude is to be changed,

16:03.837 --> 16:05.170
that so far we are going downward,

16:05.420 --> 16:07.253
now the attitude should be upward.

16:07.587 --> 16:09.879
And for that, we have to understand

16:10.253 --> 16:12.879
the method by which we are going to climb up.

16:13.170 --> 16:14.587
Like you have to go to the mountains,

16:14.837 --> 16:16.754
you must know how to do the mountaineering.

16:17.045 --> 16:20.379
You cannot just state yourself, "Now I'm going to Himalayas"

16:20.712 --> 16:22.629
- nobody will allow you.

16:23.003 --> 16:25.420
So one has to qualify, and in qualifying

16:25.754 --> 16:28.420
you have to have that humility, otherwise it won't work out.

16:28.754 --> 16:31.587
So I have to make a very clear statement,

16:31.837 --> 16:34.420
that you change your nationality

16:34.754 --> 16:38.253
from the worldly nationality to the heavenly nationality.

16:38.504 --> 16:41.003
And there, whatever is needed we'll be doing it,

16:41.295 --> 16:43.879
we'll be accepting it, we'll be managing it.

16:44.128 --> 16:48.003
For that you don't have to change anything like that,

16:48.253 --> 16:53.295
but you have to transform yourself into a new personality;

16:53.879 --> 16:56.879
new personality, where you are safe.

16:57.128 --> 17:00.379
Now just see, putting on that, how much Agnya has come down

17:00.629 --> 17:01.629
- just see.

17:01.837 --> 17:05.504
My foot was paralyzed, absolutely paralyzed when I walked in.

17:05.879 --> 17:09.128
I couldn't walk. I didn't know how I was going to take bath.

17:09.379 --> 17:11.420
I had to massage it, and then it came down.

17:11.837 --> 17:16.128
So just see putting that, just see that, how powerful it is.

17:23.003 --> 17:26.295
See - vibrations started flowing.

17:34.379 --> 17:37.712
But people are somehow in the West very much frightened

17:38.003 --> 17:40.504
that they will lose their nationality.

17:40.837 --> 17:44.879
I mean, because - I feel, because the way they went all out

17:45.253 --> 17:47.003
to destroy all the world and to destroy them,

17:47.253 --> 17:49.712
and put their own nationality on others.

17:50.128 --> 17:53.504
If you go to America - like yesterday I said,

17:53.754 --> 17:56.003
"Thank God Columbus did not go to India,

17:56.295 --> 18:00.253
he went …" I said, "Thank God, Hanumana pushed him

18:00.462 --> 18:02.587
on the other side.

18:03.253 --> 18:06.003
Otherwise we all would have been finished here, this … "

18:06.253 --> 18:08.045
You see, poor man, he didn't want to do all that,

18:08.379 --> 18:10.295
but all those followed him just went and finished.

18:10.587 --> 18:12.587
You can't find one aboriginal,

18:12.837 --> 18:16.587
one person from those old Indians in Argentina.

18:16.879 --> 18:18.379
I went to Argentina and they said,

18:18.629 --> 18:21.128
"In the museum you can find them"- just imagine.

18:21.420 --> 18:24.420
Not only Argentina but also other places,

18:24.837 --> 18:28.712
like I went to Chile: not a single person.

18:29.003 --> 18:32.379
Only in Bolivia I found some of them, that's all.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.420
But it is such a mixture there too,

18:34.754 --> 18:36.504
because I think the people ran away to the hills

18:36.879 --> 18:38.128
and managed themselves.

18:38.462 --> 18:41.629
And whatever picture they have put about them,

18:41.961 --> 18:43.170
as if they are the cruel.

18:43.504 --> 18:45.587
Poor things, they have been all killed

18:45.879 --> 18:48.961
absolutely by white men, no doubt about it.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.128
It's horrible to go and kill others, go into their land,

18:52.420 --> 18:54.879
occupy it because you have got machinery, everything,

18:55.170 --> 18:57.003
you can kill all of them.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.003
All this has been done.

18:59.295 --> 19:03.045
Now we are entering into a new era where we have to love.

19:03.462 --> 19:06.712
We don't have to aggress, we have to embrace.

19:09.879 --> 19:11.879
This is another era altogether.

19:12.128 --> 19:15.253
That aggression of Napoleon is over now.

19:15.629 --> 19:17.961
It's a new thing we have started, into another world,

19:18.170 --> 19:20.837
when we have to get more people,

19:22.379 --> 19:24.295
we have to synthesize the whole thing.

19:24.712 --> 19:27.170
And when you aggress, you start analyzing

19:27.712 --> 19:29.253
- nothing to analyze.

19:29.587 --> 19:31.754
Are you feeling better now?

19:32.504 --> 19:33.961
Put on little bigger one.

19:34.253 --> 19:36.045
See, you have a big forehead, then put on big,

19:36.379 --> 19:38.504
the very big - why do you put the little, small one?

19:38.754 --> 19:40.295
… on her head.

19:40.629 --> 19:42.879
Fashion should not be done in these things.

19:43.128 --> 19:44.462
There should be no fashioning

19:44.754 --> 19:47.879
as far as your religious duties are concerned,

19:48.170 --> 19:51.295
you should not. There is nothing like fashion.

19:52.587 --> 19:57.587
Fashion is a human affair, it's not divine.

19:58.961 --> 20:01.629
Look at these trees, how do they fashion themselves?

20:01.921 --> 20:06.045
Towards the sun. Every leaf is exposed to the sun,

20:06.379 --> 20:09.961
every leaf; because it has to get chlorophyll,

20:10.253 --> 20:13.504
it has to get the power of the sun in itself,

20:13.837 --> 20:16.128
so the every leaf is towards the sun.

20:16.379 --> 20:18.462
They don't do any fashions, do they?

20:18.837 --> 20:20.879
So another point is the individualism

20:21.170 --> 20:23.961
that is started in the West is nonsense.

20:24.587 --> 20:27.003
To show off that "I'm something different,"

20:27.379 --> 20:29.504
you become stupid.

20:29.961 --> 20:32.295
But to be one with everyone

20:32.629 --> 20:35.170
is the real individualism, I think.

20:36.504 --> 20:39.504
To be like everyone is the best.

20:40.003 --> 20:42.837
It's very difficult, it's very difficult

20:43.128 --> 20:45.961
to become one with everyone, because ego is so much.

20:46.253 --> 20:48.504
Some people have ego which hurts others,

20:48.837 --> 20:52.379
and some have whose ego is hurt - both just the same.

20:52.837 --> 20:54.462
So to overcome all these things,

20:54.754 --> 20:58.629
forget about that kind of attitude of descending downward.

20:58.921 --> 21:01.128
But for the ascent whatever is required

21:01.462 --> 21:05.253
is you look upward to God, look upward to Him

21:05.629 --> 21:10.128
with complete faith - shraddha.

21:10.462 --> 21:14.379
Then I don't have to touch you, you need not see Me.

21:14.837 --> 21:19.712
It exists everywhere, you can get the blessings everywhere.

21:20.003 --> 21:22.754
You don't have to do anything special for it

21:23.045 --> 21:24.504
- just that shraddha.

21:24.754 --> 21:27.337
But for that, certain mechanisms are to be put right,

21:27.504 --> 21:30.921
specially the Agnya needs repairs, quite a lot.

21:32.253 --> 21:35.837
That wheel is out of gear, and that must be put right.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.879
Mr. Patankar was yesterday was rather angry

21:39.170 --> 21:40.961
with the so-called educated people.

21:41.253 --> 21:43.629
They are educated in English language, that's the problem,

21:44.045 --> 21:45.837
the language is like that.

21:46.253 --> 21:47.420
They think no end of themselves.

21:47.712 --> 21:48.879
He said, "They didn't touch Your feet."

21:49.128 --> 21:52.420
If they learn English language they will not touch My feet,

21:53.045 --> 21:55.420
because in English language touching the feet

21:55.712 --> 21:58.712
is regarded as something horrible, I think.

22:00.712 --> 22:02.629
That's why he felt very sad about it.

22:02.961 --> 22:05.170
But this is all architecture has come from England,

22:05.420 --> 22:08.295
everything has come from Germany or from France.

22:08.629 --> 22:10.712
Our telephones have come from France.

22:11.045 --> 22:13.587
No wonder they work like this!

22:14.712 --> 22:16.587
It's all the French who brought this,

22:16.837 --> 22:18.587
and again they have got a big - I don't know,

22:18.837 --> 22:20.712
if I meet Rajiv Gandhi I'll tell him

22:20.961 --> 22:23.379
that at least don't give telephones to French.

22:23.629 --> 22:29.045
They has given such a big, very big order to the French.

22:29.837 --> 22:32.170
And now the helicopters they are buying from England,

22:32.379 --> 22:33.379
thank God they've stopped it.

22:33.671 --> 22:35.253
God knows what will happen to the helicopters,

22:35.504 --> 22:37.504
coming down in India from England.

22:37.754 --> 22:40.379
Like that you see they now are depending on the Third World

22:40.545 --> 22:42.295
for their progress, because they don't know

22:42.545 --> 22:43.837
where to send their own things

22:44.045 --> 22:45.295
which are created by their machines.

22:45.629 --> 22:47.961
But the way they do it: I mean, just imagine

22:48.170 --> 22:50.879
the kind of phones we have here, all done by French,

22:51.087 --> 22:53.629
not Indians. Why blame the Indians for that?

22:53.837 --> 22:56.212
Is done by the French, horrid, they have been like this

22:56.462 --> 22:59.712
since long, and they are just the same.

22:59.921 --> 23:03.003
And again now we have given order to the French,

23:03.337 --> 23:05.003
because we thought only French can cure

23:05.337 --> 23:06.837
the French telephones.

23:07.128 --> 23:08.587
I don't know what they are going to do

23:08.837 --> 23:10.462
any justice to us or not.

23:10.712 --> 23:14.712
So, as that machine is to be worked out,

23:15.003 --> 23:17.504
our own machine is to be worked out;

23:17.961 --> 23:20.961
and that machine is gone downward.

23:21.253 --> 23:25.712
Let us raise it up, upward towards God in surrender,

23:26.003 --> 23:30.128
in understanding, because you are specially chosen people

23:30.587 --> 23:32.045
in that area.

23:32.379 --> 23:35.212
Like the lotuses you have to come out of the mud,

23:35.504 --> 23:38.712
and don't imbed yourself in the mud more and more.

23:39.003 --> 23:41.128
Try to push yourself out of that,

23:41.379 --> 23:44.712
so that the fragrance of divinity will spread in that mud,

23:44.961 --> 23:49.128
and make the whole of that Western world a beautiful place,

23:49.462 --> 23:50.587
beautiful place.

23:50.837 --> 23:52.712
Whatever has been done is done.

23:53.045 --> 23:55.212
I know one thing: without forgiveness,

23:55.504 --> 23:58.003
nothing is going to work out. Done is done.

23:58.253 --> 24:02.045
Erring is human, doesn't matter; whatever is done is done.

24:02.337 --> 24:04.212
Whatever they have done is done.

24:04.504 --> 24:05.921
It's all right, forgive them.

24:06.212 --> 24:09.087
Forgiveness is the only way they can come up.

24:09.504 --> 24:13.712
And when they are forgiven, they have to also realize now

24:14.128 --> 24:16.128
that we have to rise;

24:16.671 --> 24:18.379
because the world they have created

24:18.712 --> 24:22.504
has really ruined themselves.

24:22.921 --> 24:25.961
If they rise now the whole place can become fragrant,

24:26.253 --> 24:30.337
as I told you, like the lotus that comes out of the mud.

24:30.671 --> 24:33.212
It's a very wrong idea people have here about the West,

24:33.504 --> 24:36.045
that you are the happiest people living around.

24:36.504 --> 24:40.212
So it is better that we

24:42.961 --> 24:46.003
tell them that "No, we are not happy there."

24:46.337 --> 24:49.003
You, what you have got is something precious.

24:49.253 --> 24:50.671
They also try to follow you,

24:51.003 --> 24:53.003
and that following is going so far

24:53.253 --> 24:54.961
that maybe one day you will have to come

24:55.212 --> 24:57.045
and teach them Sahaja Yoga.

24:57.337 --> 24:59.337
Because they are on the other side of the circle;

24:59.587 --> 25:01.003
they are now trying to learn English,

25:01.253 --> 25:04.003
master English language, and becoming sahibs.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.671
They will come out with tailcoats,

25:05.961 --> 25:09.003
and you'll have to tell them that better wear your dresses!

25:10.961 --> 25:15.712
So we should be wise, we should be sensible,

25:16.253 --> 25:18.796
and the stupidity and the silly temperament

25:19.087 --> 25:20.921
that we have developed, we should give up.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.961
Suddenly people bubble out, I see that.

25:23.253 --> 25:25.212
You see, there's no balance.

25:25.504 --> 25:28.587
The maturity shows when you have a balance.

25:28.796 --> 25:30.003
You should be happy, I know;

25:30.337 --> 25:32.462
but all the time smiling, putting up a show,

25:32.796 --> 25:35.253
or sort of suddenly coming out with funny remarks

25:35.504 --> 25:38.003
and silly remarks shows you are not matured enough.

25:38.253 --> 25:39.212
You have to mature.

25:39.462 --> 25:42.921
In Sahaja Yoga you mature, and if you do not mature

25:43.128 --> 25:45.712
then Sahaja Yoga has done no good to you.

25:45.754 --> 25:48.337
So you have to be very, very careful about that part.

25:51.879 --> 25:54.087
I hope I've been able to tell you all about it.

25:54.337 --> 25:55.504
Now what should I tell you ?

25:56.295 --> 25:57.961
I was just praising you,

25:58.253 --> 26:00.295
just praising you in front of others.

26:00.921 --> 26:02.754
I tell them not to behave like stupid people,

26:02.961 --> 26:04.128
and for you I must tell you

26:04.379 --> 26:08.045
that you need not blindly imitate them.

26:09.170 --> 26:11.462
Whatever we have got is a very great heritage.

26:11.712 --> 26:13.170
It should be carefully maintained.

26:13.420 --> 26:16.629
By looking at these people, if we try to imitate them

26:16.879 --> 26:18.212
it will be a foolish behavior on our part.

26:18.420 --> 26:23.879
Their life is not balanced but has gone to extremes.

26:24.629 --> 26:26.879
I have stayed there for twelve years.

26:27.128 --> 26:29.087
Thus I have spent a TUP (twelve years)

26:29.379 --> 26:31.003
so I just wanted to tell you

26:31.253 --> 26:33.337
that you should not blindly follow them.

26:34.337 --> 26:38.337
Though old is gold, whatever is oldish  is not good.

26:38.587 --> 26:40.379
So oldish is not good.

26:40.629 --> 26:45.003
The concept of oldish has also come recently.

26:45.671 --> 26:48.295
For example, from the Muslims we have learnt to harass the women,

26:48.545 --> 26:50.921
from the English we have learnt to give dowry.

26:51.587 --> 26:55.796
Now we have entered a new rules (of life)

26:55.962 --> 27:00.128
and in these new rules we need not give dowry

27:00.420 --> 27:01.961
(to our daughters who are married).

27:02.128 --> 27:03.462
The daughters have been given half the property.

27:03.754 --> 27:04.796
This system is correct.

27:05.045 --> 27:06.754
But here the daughters will not take, and neither give.

27:11.837 --> 27:15.128
Thus we should not learn these things from them.

27:15.462 --> 27:18.961
We should keep to our behavior of remaining humble,

27:19.128 --> 27:21.087
to lead a balanced life as taught to us by our ancestors,

27:21.337 --> 27:23.462
and discard whatever is oldish.

27:23.671 --> 27:25.128
There are many oldish customs lingering in us.

27:25.420 --> 27:27.045
For example, the domination of Brahmins in the temples

27:27.337 --> 27:28.921
has to be given up.

27:29.170 --> 27:30.504
They all have nicely fooled us.

27:30.796 --> 27:32.754
Secondly, the custom of fasting  has to be given up.

27:33.045 --> 27:34.712
I've told you hundred of times not to fast,

27:34.961 --> 27:36.629
but eat whatever is needed for the body,

27:36.879 --> 27:38.629
but people tell Me that "we cannot give up fasting."

27:38.879 --> 27:40.420
But the worst oldish, very dirty habit we have acquired

27:40.712 --> 27:41.754
is consuming tobacco.

27:42.003 --> 27:43.671
We are not able to give up tobacco,

27:43.921 --> 27:45.212
because we do not have enough strength .

27:47.420 --> 27:49.462
Tobacco, mishri (chewing tobacco with lime),

27:49.712 --> 27:51.212
who has brought these things to our country?

27:51.504 --> 27:53.295
From where did the word "tobacco"  come?

27:53.587 --> 27:55.545
There was no word for tambakou in Sanskrit language.

27:56.879 --> 27:58.504
We did not cultivate tobacco earlier.

27:58.796 --> 27:59.961
It is the English who have brought it to our country.

28:03.671 --> 28:05.212
The English have brought it here.

28:06.170 --> 28:07.962
That's why we call it tambakou,

28:08.295 --> 28:09.961
which has come from the word tobacco.

28:10.212 --> 28:14.337
Where is the word tambakou in our Marathi language?

28:14.629 --> 28:16.587
It has been brought here from outside.

28:16.837 --> 28:22.587
Initially the Muslims cultivated it to some extent in our country,

28:22.796 --> 28:25.003
but these people (English) have brought cigarette

28:25.253 --> 28:27.253
and other things here on a large scale.

28:27.545 --> 28:29.754
They use it on a mass scale in their country.

28:30.003 --> 28:34.420
They have also exported tobacco and ganja (sort of a drug) to China.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.837
In our Marathi language I never heard of the word ganja

28:37.003 --> 28:38.629
and charras (another sort of drug).

28:39.837 --> 28:42.962
If you try to consume ganja  and charras

28:43.671 --> 28:45.462
you will become like the English.

28:45.754 --> 28:47.087
It's up to you to decide.

28:49.961 --> 28:52.045
Thus whatever is given to us.

28:52.337 --> 28:54.587
We never had tobacco in our country, you'll be surprised.

28:54.879 --> 28:57.337
There's no word for tobacco in Sanskrit language.

28:58.087 --> 29:01.379
This was brought partly, of course, partly I should say,

29:01.671 --> 29:03.587
by the Muslims and then by the

29:03.961 --> 29:08.671
- the smoking was taught to us only by English.

29:08.921 --> 29:11.253
We didn't know that, what was smoking,

29:11.587 --> 29:13.337
we never knew smoking business.

29:13.545 --> 29:15.253
Muslims did have a little bit of it,

29:15.587 --> 29:18.128
but that started quite late.

29:18.545 --> 29:20.587
But actually this cigarette and this,

29:20.837 --> 29:22.712
all this has started after the English came in,

29:22.961 --> 29:24.712
"making it handy," you see.

29:25.087 --> 29:26.379
They used to have hookahs.

29:26.712 --> 29:28.796
That was rather difficult to make,

29:29.087 --> 29:30.837
so they could do it only very little bit.

29:31.128 --> 29:34.128
It was a long time back in the Islamic culture.

29:34.462 --> 29:37.504
But the real, this cigarette business, this ego business

29:37.837 --> 29:39.921
has come from the English, no doubt about it.

29:40.170 --> 29:43.003
And the Portuguese, Portuguese and the French,

29:43.337 --> 29:44.712
they taught us all these things.

29:44.961 --> 29:46.253
So what I'm trying to tell them,

29:46.462 --> 29:49.337
that whatever is oldish should be given up.

29:49.629 --> 29:50.961
Whatever is old is gold,

29:51.253 --> 29:53.754
but whatever is oldish that we call as junnat,

29:53.962 --> 29:55.295
should be given up.

29:58.671 --> 30:03.921
We have the custom of wearing saris with thick borders.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.337
This is a very good custom.

30:06.128 --> 30:07.796
Thick borders symbolizes maryadas,

30:07.962 --> 30:09.420
and when we wear saris with thick borders

30:09.629 --> 30:10.629
we stay in our maryadas.

30:10.879 --> 30:13.212
Young girls can dress up whatever way they like,

30:13.462 --> 30:15.003
but young women, specially married women,

30:15.295 --> 30:16.712
should wear saris with thick borders.

30:16.962 --> 30:19.212
If you give up wearing saris with thick borders

30:19.462 --> 30:24.212
then you will lose all the art, all the art.

30:24.545 --> 30:27.587
Weavers will lose all the art of weaving.

30:29.003 --> 30:30.879
If we do not construct our houses as per the old style,

30:31.128 --> 30:34.962
then we will lose all the ancient art of building beautiful houses.

30:35.337 --> 30:39.921
These people like our houses built on the old style,

30:40.128 --> 30:42.754
not the new style.

30:43.587 --> 30:45.337
The reason is that the old style has got beauty in it,

30:45.629 --> 30:49.003
and which might be lost if we built houses anyhow.

30:49.212 --> 30:50.671
Even the earlier huts were much better.

30:52.295 --> 30:53.962
Instead of this

30:54.295 --> 30:55.879
occurring at a later stage,

30:56.128 --> 30:57.545
once we lose all the art in the future it'll be too late.

30:57.837 --> 31:00.253
Thus whatever is our ancient art has to be preserved,

31:00.504 --> 31:01.796
since it has beauty in it.

31:02.087 --> 31:05.796
For example we have … type of saris which are called bugdya,

31:06.003 --> 31:08.961
nowadays the women do not even know the names of these saris.

31:09.170 --> 31:12.671
That's why we should always use the saris

31:12.921 --> 31:15.837
which have been woven by us. They are good.

31:16.045 --> 31:19.545
I think saris with thick borders suit better for the married women.

31:19.796 --> 31:21.837
If the saris do not have thick borders, it does not suit them.

31:22.045 --> 31:24.170
Married women should always wear saris with thick borders.

31:25.003 --> 31:27.504
It is not an oldish custom, but is a very beautiful custom.

31:27.754 --> 31:30.712
It looks nice, it matches with the women, it looks graceful,

31:30.961 --> 31:34.128
it has got a look of a well-bred woman.

31:34.379 --> 31:37.045
It is our culture, which we should not abandon

31:37.295 --> 31:38.754
and become like them (English).

31:40.462 --> 31:41.921
We should not try to acquire their culture,

31:42.087 --> 31:43.629
because our culture is very great.

31:43.921 --> 31:45.379
If we pave our way by understanding

31:45.671 --> 31:47.671
what has gone wrong with their culture,

31:47.961 --> 31:49.837
then we can progress well.

31:50.087 --> 31:51.671
We can accept their progress in science,

31:51.962 --> 31:54.087
but in doing so if we lose our cultural heritage

31:54.379 --> 31:56.629
then we will become like them.

31:56.921 --> 31:58.671
They kill their children.

31:58.921 --> 32:01.253
Husband and wife cannot stay together even for two years.

32:01.587 --> 32:05.545
All of them stay in orphanages, waiting for death to come.

32:07.671 --> 32:11.003
In our society we have to preserve our goodness and kindness.

32:11.253 --> 32:13.754
Instead of that, we have acquired whatever is wrong with others.

32:13.961 --> 32:15.504
First we had learnt from the Muslims,

32:15.754 --> 32:17.170
and now we are learning from these people.

32:17.420 --> 32:19.337
If we absorb the dirt from them,

32:20.504 --> 32:22.712
how can our houses remain clean?

32:22.962 --> 32:25.087
We were supposed to be clean and well-mannerly people,

32:25.337 --> 32:26.295
and now we have acquired many wrong things from others.

32:26.587 --> 32:28.337
Thus we have to abandon these things and cleanse ourselves.

32:33.587 --> 32:35.253
Now, I've told them what is the importance of puja

32:35.504 --> 32:36.796
but you know these things,

32:37.045 --> 32:38.337
so I did not explain it to you.

32:38.629 --> 32:40.754
But in puja one should have shraddha,

32:41.003 --> 32:42.962
and we should not quarrel during the puja.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.337
It does not matter who does the puja

32:45.629 --> 32:48.253
since everyone is equally benefited from it,

32:48.253 --> 32:49.921
depending upon the shraddha you have,

32:50.961 --> 32:52.587
depending upon the shraddha you have.

32:54.933 --> 32:57.933
Your pitchers will be filled up as much you have the shraddha.
