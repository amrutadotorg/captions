00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.016
Now we have to realize

00:00:08.397 --> 00:00:12.865
that Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:18.998
and in all corners of the world people respect Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:23.124
but until and unless Sahaja Yoga

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.447
is completely manifested within us,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.158
the people who respect Sahaja Yoga will not continue to do so.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:41.580
That is why it is essential that we look inside of us.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:48.681
The nature of Shri Krishna is that we look inside of us

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:52.893
and see what are the things that put us in trouble.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:58.906
We should find that out.

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:05.283
We should look towards ourselves,

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.146
within ourselves

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.919
and that is not such a difficult thing.

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:18.237
When we want to see our face,

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:22.888
we look in the mirror.

00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:30.527
Similarly, when we need to see our spirit,

00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:38.506
we should find out how to see it within us.

00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:41.058
Many Sahaja Yogis have asked Me,

00:01:41.273 --> 00:01:45.783
“Mother, how do we see what is within us

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:49.939
and how we are doing?.”

00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:55.318
For that it is necessary that

00:01:56.612 --> 00:02:00.918
we ourselves should become very humble.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.318
If we lack humility,

00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:09.473
we will be clouded by our own thoughts.

00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:12.391
So in the life of Shri Krishna,

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.529
first it was shown that

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:19.127
he was just like a small child.

00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:23.083
Absolutely like an infant.

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:24.626
Not knowing anything.

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:27.684
He did not think anything of himself.

00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:31.187
He had his mother

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:37.541
and he wanted to grow with the support of his mother.

00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:42.007
We should also look inside of ourselves

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:45.891
and realize that we are like a small child as well.

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:52.351
Shri Krishna has said this repeatedly.

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:56.221
Also, Jesus Christ has said the same thing

00:02:56.357 --> 00:02:59.621
that we should become like small children.

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:10.084
We should see the comforting shade of
the sweet nature of a child.

00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:14.122
Do we talk like a child?

00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:23.079
What is the quality within us that we become like a child?

00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:29.072
Now child means purity, innocence.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.369
With this innocence we have to look towards ourselves

00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:38.496
and cover ourselves with it.

00:03:38.846 --> 00:03:43.819
This innocence is very lovable.

00:03:45.023 --> 00:03:48.886
If you look at children and the love you feel towards them

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:52.199
because they are innocent.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.133
They don’t know cleverness;

00:03:56.245 --> 00:04:00.644
don’t feel their importance, nothing at all.

00:04:01.427 --> 00:04:03.744
What do they know?

00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:09.949
They know that all these people are related to us.

00:04:10.164 --> 00:04:14.793
They are our brothers, sisters and everything.

00:04:17.285 --> 00:04:21.446
But how do they know this.

00:04:21.653 --> 00:04:26.908
That is the question. In the same way that these children know,

00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:30.567
we have forgotten that we are like an innocent child

00:04:30.718 --> 00:04:33.212
and that we have innocence within us.

00:04:33.263 --> 00:04:36.066
There are many Sahaja Yogis  who come

00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:42.988
and think that they will show their cleverness

00:04:43.962 --> 00:04:47.452
and prove themselves to Mother.

00:04:48.312 --> 00:04:53.968
What is the need to prove anything to Me?

00:04:54.783 --> 00:04:57.648
I already know everything.

00:04:58.142 --> 00:05:01.083
So what you should do is look

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.607
towards yourself and recognize your innocence.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.097
Where is it and how is it doing?

00:05:11.082 --> 00:05:13.896
And we should think

00:05:14.206 --> 00:05:18.225
how joyful it is.

00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:21.510
Now the thing about Shri Krishna is this only.

00:05:21.623 --> 00:05:25.381
He was absolutely simple as a child

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.644
and when He grew up He explained The Gita,

00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:33.662
which is very deep.

00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:39.747
How did it happen that the human beings grew in it?

00:05:40.227 --> 00:05:44.651
In the same way we can grow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.677
We have found it but still have not progressed in it.

00:05:49.813 --> 00:05:58.531
And to progress we need to leave the bad things behind.

00:05:59.415 --> 00:06:02.440
First of all we need to have a childlike temperament.

00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:07.015
Now if we say to somebody that you should become childlike,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.994
it is a very difficult thing to do.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.105
We cannot just leave whatever we are and become childlike.

00:06:15.265 --> 00:06:18.275
But living with children, having respect for them,

00:06:18.442 --> 00:06:22.460
listening to how they talk, can make a big difference

00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:26.378
and we change all the things within us.

00:06:26.648 --> 00:06:30.541
So first of all we have to know that within us,

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:36.856
as we grew up, a lot of bad things have gone in.

00:06:38.244 --> 00:06:43.432
How should we remove those bad things?

00:06:43.765 --> 00:06:50.835
What are the kinds of bad things that have gotten into us?

00:06:51.606 --> 00:06:58.446
If we think about it and put attention on it, then we can correct it.

00:06:59.191 --> 00:07:01.987
We have to put attention on things like,

00:07:02.114 --> 00:07:06.527
when we talk to somebody aggressively,

00:07:06.744 --> 00:07:11.715
or we want to scold someone

00:07:11.882 --> 00:07:17.017
or  we keep thinking about
how to correct somebody else.

00:07:17.348 --> 00:07:20.729
When our attention goes on other people

00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:23.597
then we get removed from our own self,

00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:26.584
because we have to ourselves be all right.

00:07:26.692 --> 00:07:30.890
That is why it is no use thinking about other people.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.672
So, first of all we should look at ourselves only,

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.977
we should see ourselves.

00:07:39.324 --> 00:07:42.990
But all of that is happening,

00:07:43.103 --> 00:07:45.827
I have told about it and it is happening in Sahaja Yogis,

00:07:45.895 --> 00:07:53.064
because inside the kundalini awakens and shows all the paths.

00:07:53.394 --> 00:07:59.976
Now the remaining thing is the dirt that is within, how to fix that.

00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:09.874
First and foremost the way we look at
the defects of others should be changed

00:08:10.164 --> 00:08:13.148
because the same defects exist within us also.

00:08:13.307 --> 00:08:15.651
So instead of looking at the defects of others,

00:08:15.738 --> 00:08:19.182
we should see what are the defects within us.

00:08:19.246 --> 00:08:26.729
If we can learn to see this, then a lot of things
would become all right automatically.

00:08:29.822 --> 00:08:39.621
The thing with saints and sages is
that they see their own defects

00:08:39.776 --> 00:08:47.345
and they think about how they became like that.

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:53.874
They think, “Why do I say such harsh things?

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:57.194
Why do I lie like this?”

00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:02.492
So this is a flow of watching oneself.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:07.030
Most of the time we do not flow with that.

00:09:07.117 --> 00:09:10.279
We think we are separate from that.

00:09:10.573 --> 00:09:16.889
But it is not like that. If we understand
that there is this flow within us

00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:18.815
that takes us to such paths

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.337
where we cannot even recognize ourselves,

00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:24.954
then a human being can turn inwards.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:29.735
Now just to say that you go within yourself, meditate,

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.805
take out these things from within, is very easy.

00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:36.154
But that will not do.

00:09:36.336 --> 00:09:40.819
That is why we have to meditate and constantly work towards it.

00:09:41.157 --> 00:09:45.244
And we have ways that we know.

00:09:46.012 --> 00:09:49.924
Like to meditate on Shri Krishna.

00:09:50.636 --> 00:09:56.088
By meditating on Shri Krishna we get cleansed from within.

00:09:56.374 --> 00:10:01.365
But when we meditate on Shri Krishna

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:06.482
we think about the defects of others.

00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:13.051
If we want to look at the defects of Shri Krishna

00:10:13.373 --> 00:10:16.126
we can see that also,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.689
but we cannot see our own defects.

00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:23.506
This is too much that we cannot see our own defects

00:10:23.796 --> 00:10:26.915
but are able to see the defects of Shri Krishna.

00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.436
I have seen a lot of people who have written books about

00:10:30.484 --> 00:10:32.913
what were the defects in Shri Krishna.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.010
What wrong things did he do?

00:10:35.102 --> 00:10:37.363
How he should have lived?

00:10:37.438 --> 00:10:40.033
And they don’t know about themselves.

00:10:40.597 --> 00:10:44.457
But even when they think about themselves,

00:10:45.317 --> 00:10:50.516
and look at themselves, it is never in a way

00:10:50.614 --> 00:10:57.725
that this defect exists within and it should go away.

00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:01.969
They can keep on discussing about the defects of others.

00:11:02.258 --> 00:11:06.067
The only thing we have to see is what are the defects

00:11:06.221 --> 00:11:08.221
that we have within ourselves.

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:14.250
I do not believe that there is
a greater yogi than Shri Krishna,

00:11:14.545 --> 00:11:20.060
because he showed us the way to look at the mistakes within ourselves,

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:23.069
the defects within ourselves.

00:11:23.198 --> 00:11:25.367
This is a very big thing.

00:11:25.468 --> 00:11:29.269
He said it, but people who actually do it are very less in number.

00:11:29.752 --> 00:11:32.609
Mostly we look at the defects of others,

00:11:32.697 --> 00:11:34.466
because everyone remembers them,

00:11:34.592 --> 00:11:36.316
everyone knows them.

00:11:36.423 --> 00:11:40.744
But very few people are able to understand their own defects.

00:11:41.358 --> 00:11:44.001
That is why those people will never be all right.

00:11:44.215 --> 00:11:49.603
We have to be familiar with our own defects

00:11:49.703 --> 00:11:52.224
and laugh at ourselves

00:11:52.367 --> 00:11:54.518
and think that “look at me,

00:11:54.608 --> 00:11:59.777
what kind of defects I am having within myself”.

00:11:59.924 --> 00:12:03.357
We should think about this.

00:12:04.842 --> 00:12:10.481
This attention is never on the self

00:12:10.672 --> 00:12:13.516
but on the defects of others.

00:12:13.757 --> 00:12:16.814
This causes us to be unsettled

00:12:16.925 --> 00:12:22.001
and we fail to understand that these are our own defects.

00:12:22.235 --> 00:12:25.425
Why are we looking at the defects of others?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.987
By doing this, is it going to fix our defects?

00:12:28.106 --> 00:12:32.495
They can never be fixed like this.

00:12:32.805 --> 00:12:36.103
Slowly, as this point is understood,

00:12:36.367 --> 00:12:41.607
man will stop focusing on the defects of others.

00:12:41.805 --> 00:12:45.651
Looking at his own defects will amaze him

00:12:45.846 --> 00:12:51.389
and realizing how many devils he has harbored within himself.

00:12:51.624 --> 00:12:55.663
Within our mind we keep thinking such dirty things.

00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:59.120
When this cleansing starts,

00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:03.950
man, in a way, assumes a special form.

00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:08.677
He gets special powers

00:13:08.967 --> 00:13:12.474
and with those powers he can do many things.

00:13:13.101 --> 00:13:17.130
This happens not to boost his ego,

00:13:17.289 --> 00:13:20.747
but so that he gets cleansed.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:24.354
When we start getting cleansed like this,

00:13:24.474 --> 00:13:27.719
we have achieved our goal.

00:13:27.953 --> 00:13:32.170
Therefore, by looking at our own defects,

00:13:32.516 --> 00:13:38.049
we start cleansing ourselves
and leave the defects behind.

00:13:38.137 --> 00:13:41.983
Now how to do this?

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:46.391
Because, seeing the defect is not a hard thing,

00:13:46.644 --> 00:13:50.297
but to let go of it, is the hard part.

00:13:50.432 --> 00:13:53.478
That is why the way to see the defect has to be subtle

00:13:53.577 --> 00:13:55.627
and minute, and our attention should be towards it.

00:13:55.652 --> 00:13:56.993
A lot can be cleansed like this.

00:13:57.362 --> 00:14:03.067
The message of today’s festival is that

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:06.468
we should look within ourselves and see.

00:14:06.861 --> 00:14:09.845
This is what Shri Krishna has said.

00:14:10.098 --> 00:14:13.895
But people find this hard to do.

00:14:14.046 --> 00:14:15.765
It doesn’t happen.

00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:22.492
What is the reason that we are not able to see ourselves?

00:14:23.483 --> 00:14:26.169
What is this veil in between?

00:14:26.518 --> 00:14:28.589
The veil is of bad things like ego etc.

00:14:28.963 --> 00:14:38.845
They stand up and we are unable to see the defects

00:14:39.099 --> 00:14:42.323
that we should see.

00:14:43.792 --> 00:14:50.301
To see these defects is very essential.

00:14:53.328 --> 00:14:57.120
I am very happy that you kept today’s puja.

00:14:57.334 --> 00:15:01.199
Shri Krishna’s puja will take place and

00:15:01.992 --> 00:15:05.274
a lot of people will get cleansed from within

00:15:05.873 --> 00:15:10.891
because this is a special blessing of Shri Krishna.

00:15:11.065 --> 00:15:12.877
He will do it Himself,

00:15:13.031 --> 00:15:15.830
but you have to show a little interest,

00:15:15.942 --> 00:15:23.013
an inclination that you want to be completely cleansed from within.

00:15:23.766 --> 00:15:32.324
You don’t know how profound this question is.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:34.253
To fix this we have to work very hard.

00:15:34.612 --> 00:15:42.822
Earlier, people would do many physical exercises;
listen to the orders of their guru.

00:15:42.973 --> 00:15:46.771
They would do a lot of things

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.096
but they would never achieve the depth.

00:15:49.468 --> 00:15:51.734
But you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:54.299
It should not be difficult for you.

00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:57.247
So now I will only say that

00:15:57.357 --> 00:15:59.932
you should learn to look into yourselves.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.460
It will be a lot of fun.

00:16:02.548 --> 00:16:04.629
Till now, it is alright,

00:16:04.774 --> 00:16:08.496
but I do not know what you have started doing.

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:11.025
You keep a watch on yourself.

00:16:11.273 --> 00:16:13.898
You will see how this whole thing works

00:16:14.165 --> 00:16:16.847
and you will be enjoying it

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:22.463
and start laughing at yourself and exclaim ‘what to say?’

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.072
When this happens, you will start manifesting innocence within you.

00:16:27.473 --> 00:16:30.679
This is the Bala Leela of Shri Krishna.
(Childlike playfulness)

00:16:31.243 --> 00:16:43.994
Once you get bathed in this innocence
your eyes will become very steady.

00:16:44.362 --> 00:16:46.882
On your own you will start understanding yourself.

00:16:47.361 --> 00:16:52.559
Actually, the defect lies within us only.

00:16:52.909 --> 00:16:55.667
Looking at the defects of others,

00:16:56.003 --> 00:16:57.587
how can we fix our own defects?

00:16:57.612 --> 00:17:00.500
A very simple straightforward question is

00:17:00.773 --> 00:17:07.498
“If something falls on our sari and we do not remove it,

00:17:08.235 --> 00:17:10.988
and if we abuse or blame someone else,

00:17:11.065 --> 00:17:14.872
it won’t just go away, will it?

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.406
This much intelligence we all have.

00:17:17.663 --> 00:17:20.496
But we don’t use that intelligence.

00:17:20.954 --> 00:17:24.287
And for this you should all use this intelligence.

00:17:29.018 --> 00:17:36.376
If anyone has not understood this
you can ask questions, in Marathi also.

00:17:57.513 --> 00:18:01.428
At least you should ask some questions.

00:18:19.729 --> 00:18:25.515
Now see, the attention is going inside and we are pushing it

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:30.134
further but it should happen spontaneously.

00:18:30.635 --> 00:18:35.265
The attention should have the habit of going inwards by itself.

00:18:47.036 --> 00:18:50.186
I know that you have many questions to ask.

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:53.140
We have a lot of confusion within us,

00:18:53.323 --> 00:18:55.955
there is no doubt about it.

00:18:56.504 --> 00:18:59.057
But the questions are very subtle.

00:18:59.487 --> 00:19:01.893
There is no end to it.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.627
Always, there is a question of rising above all this.

00:19:06.767 --> 00:19:09.431
Now, people say, ‘Mother, how can we rise above all this?’

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:11.306
Meditation.

00:19:11.579 --> 00:19:15.111
What to say about meditation?

00:19:15.338 --> 00:19:17.242
You have to meditate on your own selves.

00:19:17.345 --> 00:19:22.660
You have to see your own selves, that, where is your brain going?

00:19:24.398 --> 00:19:25.622
And where are you going?

00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:28.259
Slowly you will get cleansed.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.645
Today is of great importance.

00:19:31.858 --> 00:19:39.555
The incarnation of Shri Krishna has done a great deal of cleansing for us

00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:42.257
and He has helped us a lot.

00:19:42.475 --> 00:19:45.974
His coming on the earth made a lot of difference.

00:19:46.242 --> 00:19:53.052
The awakening of Kundalini has also gone smoothly

00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:55.081
on account of His blessings.

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:58.377
Please try to look at yourselves.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.436
You should not be annoyed with

00:20:01.629 --> 00:20:05.875
yourselves and you should not be annoyed with others either.

00:20:08.152 --> 00:20:09.794
It will be very joyous.

00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:13.625
This is the Krishna Puja.

00:20:16.933 --> 00:20:21.958
If you have any other questions,

00:20:47.138 --> 00:20:49.828
alright, you can ask Me….

00:20:53.239 --> 00:20:54.397
What to say….

00:21:16.694 --> 00:21:19.590
Any other questions?

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.257
Comment from Sahaja Yogi: Everyone is in nirvichar.

00:21:28.243 --> 00:21:31.545
What’s the question?……

00:21:35.613 --> 00:21:39.866
Sahaja Yogi: Everyone is sitting in nirvichar.

00:21:41.802 --> 00:21:42.968
Shri Mataji: Come closer.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:47.756
Sahaja Yogi: How do you attain
nirchvichar(thoughtlessness) in meditation?

00:21:59.954 --> 00:22:01.811
Shri Mataji: In meditation?

00:22:02.486 --> 00:22:07.333
There is no vichar (thoughts) during meditation.

00:22:07.969 --> 00:22:12.315
Why should thoughts come in meditation?

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:16.153
You are not to seek anything during meditation.

00:22:16.337 --> 00:22:19.592
It is only to be felt within.

00:22:19.817 --> 00:22:25.781
It is you who have to discriminate whether
you have realised this or not during meditation.

00:22:27.239 --> 00:22:30.016
In meditation, first you will come to know your own mistakes,

00:22:30.429 --> 00:22:33.444
where you were wrong,

00:22:33.596 --> 00:22:36.289
and where you were right.

00:22:36.472 --> 00:22:39.222
When you start realising your own mistakes,

00:22:39.445 --> 00:22:42.026
then you are on the right track.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:48.333
When you look at yourself in the mirror, you see yourself.

00:22:49.695 --> 00:22:52.625
What is the use of seeing others?

00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:23.959
Sahaja Yogi: How do we protect ourselves
from the clutches of the false gurus?

00:23:24.025 --> 00:23:25.064
What to say….

00:23:25.316 --> 00:23:32.564
How do we protect ourselves
from the clutches of the false gurus?

00:23:34.291 --> 00:23:36.969
Shri Mataji: Why did you have to go to a false guru?

00:23:38.612 --> 00:23:40.651
You tell me first,

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.963
why did you go to a false guru?

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.285
What attracted you to go to the false guru?

00:23:48.893 --> 00:23:50.837
How did you go there?

00:23:51.679 --> 00:23:53.840
You must ask yourself this first.

00:23:54.023 --> 00:23:57.614
Then you will realise that you ignored the evils of that false guru.

00:23:57.725 --> 00:24:01.391
The trouble with us is,

00:24:02.247 --> 00:24:05.041
we always like to see others in the mirror.

00:24:08.856 --> 00:24:15.409
Then how will you identify your own faults
if you start to see others in the mirror?

00:24:15.618 --> 00:24:18.549
That is what you didn’t protect yourself from.

00:24:18.618 --> 00:24:22.925
Now, in the past I have already given lectures on false gurus

00:24:23.047 --> 00:24:26.057
where I have clearly talked about their evildoings

00:24:26.203 --> 00:24:28.747
and how they take one for a ride.

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.949
It is their business to entrap you all.

00:24:32.085 --> 00:24:34.786
There are different types of business which they adopt.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:40.612
Out of that, gurus also have a business to entrap you

00:24:41.004 --> 00:24:42.860
and you are trapped.

00:24:43.567 --> 00:24:45.895
From this, one must realise

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.524
which trap we have fallen into.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:59.341
We have filled our brains with the badhas (negativities) of the false gurus.

00:25:02.335 --> 00:25:06.988
Now if you can tell me any of those badhas,

00:25:15.231 --> 00:25:17.300
then I can tell you…..

00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:34.587
Now if you know one or two of these badhas,
you let me know.

00:25:35.432 --> 00:25:36.613
The false gurus’ badhas.

00:25:36.638 --> 00:25:38.325
Now what do these badhas actually do?

00:25:38.765 --> 00:25:46.483
First they focus their attention on your pocket.
Isn’t it?

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.607
As they start doing this, then you must understand

00:25:51.821 --> 00:25:55.270
that their intentions are different.

00:25:55.536 --> 00:25:59.560
But it is all on the gross level.

00:26:00.837 --> 00:26:05.122
On the subtler level, in fact,

00:26:05.638 --> 00:26:08.230
there are many

00:26:09.928 --> 00:26:14.925
who wouldn’t want to entrap you,

00:26:15.557 --> 00:26:20.208
but they would try to project their own importance.

00:26:21.137 --> 00:26:23.584
And for this reason

00:26:25.563 --> 00:26:28.010
they become gurus.

00:26:28.542 --> 00:26:32.426
It is like this, that one projects his importance.

00:26:33.204 --> 00:26:41.243
So you must watch all this and be critical about it.

00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:44.938
Then it will forsake you.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.674
But most of the people absorb their badhas, their ego, their anger,

00:26:50.103 --> 00:26:52.962
their physical health

00:26:53.264 --> 00:26:56.443
and many more aspects that you absorb from the guru.

00:27:01.459 --> 00:27:04.022
Like these gurus,

00:27:04.181 --> 00:27:09.820
when they fall sick, their shadow starts reflecting within you.

00:27:10.683 --> 00:27:12.222
For this reason,

00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:15.008
you must analyse yourself

00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:19.648
and look at yourself, that, what have I received from this guru?

00:27:25.587 --> 00:27:28.460
This is very important.

00:27:28.878 --> 00:27:34.068
Then when there is a cleansing of yourself,

00:27:34.593 --> 00:27:36.483
you will see that it benefits you to a great extent.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.180
Why did you go to a guru

00:27:39.235 --> 00:27:46.176
when you were seeking for your own spiritual ascent?

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.127
You went to a guru to know him but you were in turn entrapped.

00:27:51.418 --> 00:27:56.854
This guru is such a guru,and you yourself
should know how to protect yourself from him.

00:27:57.024 --> 00:27:59.555
You should stay away from them.

00:28:00.331 --> 00:28:03.973
I had been to many such gurus just to see them and what they do,

00:28:04.111 --> 00:28:06.492
and how they tempt and attract people.

00:28:06.744 --> 00:28:11.989
And with what they entrap people.

00:28:12.551 --> 00:28:18.535
So the first thing I saw was
that these people find your own weaknesses,

00:28:18.985 --> 00:28:21.302
that what weakness you have

00:28:22.085 --> 00:28:24.275
If this doesn’t work then they put badhas into you

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.362
The badhas are of various types.

00:28:29.552 --> 00:28:35.291
Out of these badhas you must first learn
to detect what type of badhas

00:28:35.363 --> 00:28:37.706
he has put into you that you are unable to get rid of.

00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:41.648
The greatest badha that they put into you is FEAR.

00:28:42.591 --> 00:28:46.273
It keeps on frightening you,

00:28:46.985 --> 00:28:52.040
that ‘if you leave me, such and such thing will happen to you.'

00:28:52.196 --> 00:28:54.354
This type of fear creeps within you.

00:28:54.617 --> 00:28:57.402
It doesn’t have much strength in it.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.682
But it keeps on frightening you.

00:29:00.372 --> 00:29:06.824
When this fear comes,you must say to it, ‘yes, I know it’.

00:29:08.372 --> 00:29:13.523
With this fear the human beings
keep on going round and round the guru.

00:29:14.833 --> 00:29:17.206
For that Shri Krishna is there,

00:29:17.899 --> 00:29:21.430
Who drives out this fear from everyone.

00:29:39.296 --> 00:29:41.351
Do you have any other questions?

00:29:41.748 --> 00:29:47.170
Sahaja Yogi: Everyone is in nirvichar (thoughtlessness)

00:29:47.239 --> 00:29:48.692
What to say….

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:54.297
Sahaja Yogi: Everyone is in nirvichar (thoughtlessness)

00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:08.799
Saying that everyone is in vichar (thoughts)

00:30:08.864 --> 00:30:11.967
now we have to go beyond vichar (thoughts).

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.157
Sahaja Yogi reaffirms: No Mother it’s nirvichar (thoughtlessness)

00:30:16.292 --> 00:30:17.784
Nirvichar.

00:30:19.105 --> 00:30:21.152
How did that happen?

00:30:47.348 --> 00:30:53.500
You have organised such a nice Krishna Puja

00:30:54.086 --> 00:31:02.447
that I also keep wondering.

00:31:02.976 --> 00:31:06.529
How is the environment?

00:31:18.872 --> 00:31:20.824
Is it OK?…

00:31:21.048 --> 00:31:28.639
Yes, it is peaceful and calm…..

00:31:37.558 --> 00:31:39.168
peaceful…..

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.010
Now better.

00:31:43.963 --> 00:31:47.296
A person who can witness himself laughing,

00:31:47.498 --> 00:31:48.950
that is perfect.

00:31:49.928 --> 00:31:52.659
One who laughs at others,

00:31:52.697 --> 00:31:55.552
his attention is in another direction.

00:31:55.825 --> 00:32:04.488
Again, one who can witness and laugh at himself, and his own environment

00:32:15.596 --> 00:32:17.859
and aspect

00:32:23.488 --> 00:32:25.377
he is perfect.

00:32:33.639 --> 00:32:35.456
Endless blessings.
