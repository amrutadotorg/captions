00:00:21.550 --> 00:01:59.020
We had a very good session, I should say,
and a very successful trip in Portugal and

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.429
even better in Spain.

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:16.840
Portugal is a place where gurus have touched
very nicely because people are too simple,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.140
and because they are too simple they are affected
too hard.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:32.280
And I was really confronted with so many sick
people there who have been to gurus, who have

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:51.220
been only for two, three years with them are
badly affected and surprisingly how the whole

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:05.620
thing is exposed, that we may be able to do
much better in Portugal.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:18.160
Now, the Portuguese people get lot of wine.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.180
They drink a lot; they really drink.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.800
I mean, they have all kinds of wines in their
country.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.280
It's a very big problem of that place, is
it that has many wines and I think the drunkenness

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:39.860
make them extremely lethargic and that lethargy
brought down that empire.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.860
We can see it's a very huge place.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.450
I mean the buildings, if you see, are very
beautifully done, lots of buildings with lots

00:03:50.450 --> 00:04:01.190
of architecture, and all that is like a desolate
place.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:11.190
The reason is: the people who were at the
time quite affluent were doing well.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.280
Gradually unemployment started settling down,
lots of strikes - just the same thing as I

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:26.419
feel is happening in this country - and unemployment
and amounting to starvation.

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.990
First they used to get doles and all that,
as we get here; gradually it stopped.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.449
Now it's so bad that all of them have to depend
on their parents.

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:36.740
There's no way.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.529
They have no source of income, very few industries.

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:50.939
It's one of the poorest country in the whole
of Europe.

00:04:50.939 --> 00:05:04.620
That made Me think about England, that we
have to know that this country also may face

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.400
a phase, if we do not get up now.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.759
You see it's all right to divert your attention
to Falklands and all that, but it cannot feed

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:15.960
you.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.520
So, we have to understand, all the Sahaj Yogis
must understand, that they all must have some

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:31.060
sort of a degree or something on the paper;
that's a very important.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.139
And though you are all realized souls and
you are spiritually so endowed, everything

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.871
is there, but you have to think of the whole.

00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:48.310
If the country completely goes down in its
production and its capacity to activate itself,

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.589
you will go down, too.

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:57.409
So, your attention should be now, of course,
you should not be materialistic, but towards

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:03.960
putting more activity into you, even in Sahaja
Yoga, in meditating, in working it out in

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.960
yourself.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.169
So, lethargy is not going to pay.

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:16.090
And this is one thing, is such an inertia,
such an inertia that exists, that unless and

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:22.499
until you really put in complete willpower,
this inertia may not be combated, may be very

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:28.419
difficult, even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:34.479
You see, it is very easy to escape and explain,
you see, yourself, "Oh, I got up and, you

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:36.460
know, this happened, that happened."

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:46.600
But, I think the symptoms are of a very dangerous
type and as Sahaja Yogis you have to be very

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.490
patriotic about it and you have to think about
it.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:59.690
After all, you are symbols of the English
people.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.999
Whatever works out in you will start working
out in the rest.

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:15.229
So, how you behave towards yourself and towards
the general atmosphere is very, very important.

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:23.719
Now, towards Sahaja Yoga also the attitude
has to be understood very clearly.

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:33.680
You see, like a Maharaja in India who lives
in quite great comfort first of all, lives

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.539
like a lord and he orders about, you see,
and then everything is lost.

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:42.629
But, still he talks like a lord, behaves like
a lord.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:50.039
His whole thing is the same way, though, it's
not that the kingdom is there, that he's the

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:54.580
ruler, but he'll talk like that to everyone,
because the habits are formed.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.539
I think the mind also has formed a habit.

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:04.330
The whole atmosphere is charged with such
ego since long and that's why towards Sahaja

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:11.199
Yoga also, the attitude has to be humbler,
much humbler, because without humility you

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.349
cannot do.

00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:13.659
That's one thing you must understand.

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:18.460
It's no question of you rationally saying
something about it or explaining about it.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.529
But, you see, basically one has to be extremely
humble.

00:08:23.529 --> 00:08:27.129
First of all, it's a very big privilege to
get realization.

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:28.819
You know that.

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:35.070
It's a greater privilege to do it, and it's
the greatest to be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:40.880
Is a very great privilege that you have, which
very few people have and you are the ones

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.330
who are chosen specially.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:52.330
But, the humility part of it is still missing
about Sahaja Yoga, about Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:09:05.329
Like, we should ask, "Make me a better Sahaja
Yogi, a humbler Sahaja Yogi, a compassionate

00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:07.839
Sahaja Yogi, a sweeter Sahaja Yogi.

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:12.250
Dissolve my ego."

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.100
This is very important, we must understand,
because whatever works out in you, will work

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.850
out in this country.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:28.440
Arrogance is something that with ego you can
never understand you have been arrogant.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.830
The way you talk to others, the way you behave
towards others, you will never understand,

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.160
because there is ego.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.440
If you are standing in the darkness, the light
is there but it is covered with something.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.420
How will you understand where is the light?

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:54.769
So, humility must be there, because you people
have very developed brains, very developed,

00:09:54.769 --> 00:10:00.410
over-developed brains and that brain can,
you see, always tell you, "Oh, you are better

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.860
than others," you see, always.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:07.270
"The another one is no good and the third
one is useless.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.110
You see, you are the best."

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.180
That's typical of the brain teaches, you see.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.280
And when it starts working out, it's very
difficult, you see, to see that the one who

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:26.389
is saying this is nowhere, because from the
point where you see, you cannot see what you

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:30.149
are saying.

00:10:30.149 --> 00:10:38.540
What you see is the whole thing as if you
have to command it; you have to ask for it.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:44.819
Of course, the quality is very much changing
now, everybody is becoming very, very, very

00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:49.410
sweet and sober and nobody now demands anything
from Me like, "You must give me this, Mother.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.510
You have to do it.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.730
You have to look after me.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:57.279
After all, I have been to Your Caxton Hall
once, You see, and how dare You do not look

00:10:57.279 --> 00:11:00.740
after my mother when she met an accident?"

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.740
Something like that.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.209
That's over now.

00:11:04.209 --> 00:11:09.089
That's over.

00:11:09.089 --> 00:11:15.959
The quality is improving now and one has started
learning now how to laugh at your own ego

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:18.470
and this and that.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:25.639
But I personally think that one has to realize
that if you represent this country to your

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:28.990
Mother, then it has to improve still.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.370
"Still I have to improve.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.569
I have to go ahead.

00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:43.709
I have to go further with it and have I to
develop that beauty of humility."

00:11:43.709 --> 00:11:52.860
Like in Portugal they told Me Lord Byron,
whom I think to be a useless fellow, absolutely

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:59.080
good for nothing and I regretted every minute
why he was created on this earth, he went

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:05.069
and said that ... he went and said, "Cintra
is a very beautiful place.

00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:09.339
Cintra is too good to be wasted on Portuguese."

00:12:09.339 --> 00:12:15.420
It should have been from Mr. Lord Byron, whosoever
he may be.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.760
You see, typical!

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760
And it pinches everyone, you know.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.760
Everybody feels.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:29.819
But think if you are the person about whom
he said.

00:12:29.819 --> 00:12:40.269
So, one has to develop a kind of a humility
that "I have to still receive; I have to still

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:43.250
get it; it has to work out."

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:50.160
Now, when it comes to that kind of an attitude,
then you turn round.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.140
Turn round upon yourself.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.720
What have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:13.079
One question, simple question: what have you
done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:13:13.079 --> 00:13:19.310
How many people have you given realization?

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:25.500
How many people have you been able to cure?

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.360
How much peace have you got within yourself?

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.260
How much blissful are you?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.029
How much compassion have you got?

00:13:36.029 --> 00:13:40.129
How much forgiveness and patience you have
for others?

00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:45.459
How much of sharing you can do?

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:54.740
These are the signs of sahaja yogis, that
you break your shell.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.240
You become collective.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.920
How much do you understand others?

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.490
And how much do you understand giving [to]
others?

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:11.699
What have you given to others, even on material
level?

00:14:11.699 --> 00:14:17.970
Let's see.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.209
These questions should be put to yourself.

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:25.120
On a very material level these questions are
to be asked, on a very material level, because

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:30.699
the light comes down to material level.

00:14:30.699 --> 00:14:37.120
How many people you can forgive?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.200
You are realized souls.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.170
You are prophets, no doubt.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:50.690
You can make others prophets, but you have
to be the quality, also.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:56.240
The quality of a prophet is his nobility.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.740
He is so noble.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.870
Nobleness.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:14.810
In comparison with other people, who are not
realized souls, he is nobler; he is more dignified;

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.810
he is much more forgiving.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:24.600
So the whole way of dealing with others will
change.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:31.079
He is obedient.

00:15:31.079 --> 00:15:36.430
We have to obey in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.810
We have to obey our good will.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.509
Otherwise, you are difficult people.

00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:45.999
It's impossible.

00:15:45.999 --> 00:15:48.820
Nobody can do anything to you.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:55.449
If you are like a thorn, how can anybody help
you?

00:15:55.449 --> 00:16:01.250
So the quality of a sahaja yogi is measured
by another kind of a measure.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:05.709
Is not the way human beings measure the quality
of other human beings.

00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:12.089
Like, somebody has a good taste, for example,
so-called.

00:16:12.089 --> 00:16:14.149
Then people say, "Oh, he's great, with a good
taste."

00:16:14.149 --> 00:16:18.660
Or if he has a big car, "Oh, he's a big man."

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.620
Or he talks like that, or he walks like that,
or says this, that and all those things.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.559
Or a question like this, "Why did you say
like that?"

00:16:27.559 --> 00:16:28.749
All these words, you know.

00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:30.910
They sound very hard to Me.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.589
"Why do you do like that?"

00:16:32.589 --> 00:16:37.059
This kind of a language itself was not there
in this English language.

00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:45.019
Nowadays the language is so changed and very
rude, very arrogant and very harmful.

00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:57.399
So, first ask yourself, because Sahaja Yoga
will spread - of course, slowly and steadily,

00:16:57.399 --> 00:17:02.019
I hope - only through your images.

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:03.370
You are the reflectors.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:08.280
You put My thousands of posters.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.490
I am so unique, you know.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:16.660
They'll say, "All right, this unique personality
is taken out, no good.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.089
What about the disciples?"

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:32.850
So, actually whatever is in the lower level
animals is important, like in lower level

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.560
animals the king is the one.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.130
Say, the tiger has to kill an animal, big
animal.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.700
It is he who only can kill.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.740
Till human stage also perhaps it is so.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:52.120
The one who can really dominate others, survival
of the fittest, is the rule.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.980
Is the other way round, now.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.400
It's changed, completely.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:08.260
How much free you are in your ideas, while
you are still identified with old ideas.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:13.260
But free doesn't mean abandonment, by any
chance.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.600
Freedom means you respect the freedom of others.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.140
First and foremost thing of freedom is that
you must respect the freedom of others.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.700
Even God respects your freedom.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.640
He cannot give you realization if you don't
want it.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.630
He cannot force it.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.380
So, respect the freedom of others.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:38.540
But, that does not mean by respecting the
freedom of others there should be abandonment.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:45.300
If somebody is abandoned in Sahaja Yoga, he
goes out of the circulation of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:50.760
It's not coming in is so important, I've told
you hundred times.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.530
It's the throwing out part of it, you see.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:58.580
Sometimes I feel I should use some glues to
stick on.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:04.210
Maybe, the wheel can turn very fast and some
of half-baked may be thrown out back again

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.960
into the oven.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:14.760
So, I feel, in these countries where I went,
Spain, they call it.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:20.460
Spain, still half-developing; Portugal, developing.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.340
I don't know what you think about Italy, whatever
it is called.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:32.670
Very humble people, very humble from the very
first day.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.520
Anyone who comes from the very first day,
they are very humble and because they are

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:44.980
humble, they are sensitive to Me; because
you have to be really very humble to be sensitive

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:56.280
to Me, that's a fact, because I'm too simple,
naïve, as if I do not understand anything.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:05.740
I look like that, I mean, as if I have no
knowledge of anything - very simple woman,

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:10.980
talks in a very simple way, is very friendly,
all right.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:24.060
So to understand Me you have to be extremely
humble and if you cannot go to that level

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:32.270
of humility you cannot see Me and you cannot
understand Me.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.610
And the more you start understanding, the
more humble you become, naturally, because

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.250
you know what it is.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:46.870
So, I have told you many a times about humility
part of it, but My experience of these countries

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.670
was where I went there.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:58.090
I mean, they are very humble people, very
humble about Sahaja Yoga, extremely humble

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.900
they were.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.320
Even the new people were very humble.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.640
Spanish people same thing, extremely humble.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:12.470
You see, Dawn had told Me that they have a
ego of a bull fighter, but the one who came

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.160
this time were so humble I was amazed.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:20.840
Even if I could touch them, that was sufficient
for them.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:27.600
Nobody pulled My hand, nothing.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:40.840
So, this is what it is: one has to understand
that we have certain tags of our past which

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.640
has to go down.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.420
The language should be extremely humble language.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:56.080
Try to read ... I don't know whose language
is so humble.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:01.360
Maybe Mine, I don't know.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:08.440
But, try to read books where people speak
humble language, humble way of talking.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:14.330
You'll enjoy it, really enjoy it.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:20.420
Humility is the glory of sahaja yogis, is
the only way they will grow.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:34.060
It's like putting your roots down and down
and down.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:43.680
The people who went from here were themselves
amazed at the humility of the people who were

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:49.920
there, very much amazed, the way things are
working out there, the way they helped us

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.360
and did everything for us.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.800
And I am sure now in Spain we'll have a very
nice, very, very nice center.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.800
Of course, the Ambassador is a very, very
humble man - you know him, too humble - and

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.840
he might be coming here, and one day I want
to call him here to the ashram also.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.250
He and his wife will be here.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:20.260
So, the Ambassador was very sweet and he called
Me to his house, invited, and he had a nice

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.260
tea party.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.170
He called Indians and everything and Indians
said, you know they asked Me for one thing.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.180
You'll be shocked.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:30.670
They said, "What about something to depend
upon?" you see.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.310
"Can we have Your photographs, something?

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.730
It must be having some vibrations.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.630
Should we use Your photographs for our worship?"

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.510
Can you imagine?

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.670
And, at first I said that "It's all right.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.933
It will work out," because I didn't want to
say, "You have to take My photograph."

00:23:47.933 --> 00:23:49.520
So she was so disappointed, the lady.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.530
She said, "No, there must be a photograph
or something which we can use.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.220
After all, how can that be?"

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.300
Just imagine!

00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:01.820
And here, first thing comes up, like a big
snake, "Why Mother's photograph?

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:08.670
She should give us realization, She should
solve all our problems, all our sickness,

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.600
everything, but why Her photograph?

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.330
This is too much!"

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:24.880
In this you can see the ego of the people.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:48.430
Now, regarding ashram, I had asked Nick, I
had asked him to make certain rules and regulations.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:56.660
And I must say that, of course, Nick should
say things, as you, somebody told Me that

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.790
he should have been a little softer with it
and all that.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:08.850
But, supposing somebody is not soft at all,
so you must know that this is said by Mother

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:09.850
and you must do it.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:15.040
You see, actually, when you say no to him,
you are saying no to Me also, isn't it?

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.150
Because I sent him.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.040
I told him and I told him that "You must carry
out these things."

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.590
If you do not allow him to carry out, he has
to be perhaps strict.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:31.540
By softer means, supposing something fails,
then what to do?

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.590
I really don't know.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:39.130
After realization even if do not do things,
what should we do?

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:41.440
Can you suggest?

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.790
I mean, you should respect everyone.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:49.771
But say, even if you respect, people get up
at eight o'clock in the morning; then what

00:25:49.771 --> 00:25:55.350
should you do?

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.510
What should be done, you just tell us?

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.350
John, tell Me.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.900
I mean, it is really surprising.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.130
You are now prophets.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:10.780
Do you understand your quality, what are you,
what have I given you?

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:14.170
Then what should we do about it?

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:15.890
You see, these are so simple things, like
children also.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:20.230
If you are in a hostel, you are made to get
up in the morning, take your bath, get ready,

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.430
walk out.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:28.190
I mean, if you do not listen, anyone, I mean,
it's simple.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.050
Then, what should one do with prophets?

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:36.920
You just tell Me.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:43.030
This is not the problem in Australia even.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.840
But English one going to Australia, create
problems.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.440
I have seen.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.930
Sally, what a problem.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:49.930
Ba pre.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.650
You could see in contrast, her ego.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:57.860
Absolutely, in contrast I could see it clearly,
very egoistical.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:02.960
Though she said that she was in - what place
she was in?

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.360
Jersey, and there bhoots got her.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.560
But all the bhoots were egoistical.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.130
That's the point.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:17.440
Such a contrast, you know.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:24.700
If we have to grow as one body and you are
enlightened, part and parcel, part and particle

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.860
of the same body, supposing this finger says,
"No, no, I will not do it."

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:39.210
Now, somebody is, say, putting a big attack
or something and this hand says, "No, I will

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.240
not work out," then what to do?

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:51.560
Actually, it's a very big dilemma for Me because
a hand which is forced to do it will never

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.840
do it properly.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.480
If you don't force it, then what happens to
that hand?

00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:03.830
I mean, just see, the diligence is very important.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:12.770
We should not take things for granted.

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:16.420
You see, we take ourselves for granted, everything
for granted.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.630
Is not proper.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.640
We have to work hard.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.070
We have to work it out ourselves.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:28.540
You see, even if you have ten thousand sahaja
yogis, here, what is going to happen?

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.280
The quality is so poor, isn't it?

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.180
You have to get up in the morning, do it,
meditation.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.180
You have to grow.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.850
You have to grow still much more.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:45.490
And you know you are so very few, I have to
use you only.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.610
Of course, nobody can force you.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.310
And even if you force, a forced labor is not
going to help in Sahaja Yoga, that is.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.260
You take it from Me.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.260
It cannot.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.440
So, these people who go nowhere, where do
they stand?

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.420
Now, anyone you tell the job.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.070
Say, Warren also, in Australia.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:05.600
There were jealousies about that, terrible
jealousies.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.850
"Why should he tell me?"

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.440
Because there is nobody to tell you within
yourself.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.660
That's the problem is it.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.970
So, that which is sleeping, I put it into
one man.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:22.840
All right, this man is going to tell, but,
then that person tells you, then people feel

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.840
jealous.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.070
I mean, these are not the signs of a prophet.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:33.190
A prophet is never jealous, because he knows
he has achieved his powers now.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:37.600
He's in his own power and his power is of
surrendering.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.860
He's not of overpowering.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.490
See, you cannot see the other side of it.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:45.020
You think power means you sit on somebody's
head, then, "I am very powerful."

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.930
Like a woman, if she can make her husband
dance to her tune, then she thinks, "Oh, I

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.200
am the most powerful woman ever living."

00:29:51.200 --> 00:30:00.040
It's the other way round, that the woman is
so loving that husband can't do without her,

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.760
that sort of a power.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.520
She's so sweet that the husband cannot manage
without her.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:13.810
That sort of a power is, should be the power
of a prophet

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:18.640
and these things are very much deeply put
into us.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.150
So face it up and take it out.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.980
The whole value system is upside down.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.100
I tell you the whole value system is upside
down.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:34.410
See My life, own life.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:45.790
As a wife of such and such and such I am expected
to go into diamond shops, buy diamonds, wear,

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:53.180
become a big lady with heels like that and
walk with a neck like that and do all sorts.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.800
I mean, this is the normal thing.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.040
It's expected.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.100
And shout at the chauffeur, and shout at the
servants and shout at everyone and behave

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.100
in that manner.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.600
I mean, that's what it is, the power is.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.430
You see, that's how the woman express their
husbands' positions.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:15.250
But, the other way round, is the situation
of a prophet.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:23.670
The prophet asserts his powers through love.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.460
"How much can you hate me?

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.460
I love you double.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:32.061
Always, whatever you will hate me, I'll love
you double of that."

00:31:32.061 --> 00:31:35.510
Then what will happen?

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:44.090
But to love, one has to sacrifice, one has
to give, one has to bear.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:47.880
Love doesn't hang in the air.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.180
That's one thing people don't understand.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:56.210
Love is not only talking love or if you are
a little gentle to somebody is not the point.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:32:03.380
But even that bearing is a joy, because ultimately
you are doing it for love.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:08.260
If love is the joy-giving thing, then that
bearing is not much.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.670
You are doing it for love's sake.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:19.310
See, because love, unless and until it is
shared you cannot enjoy.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:27.010
So, first we have to be strict with ourselves,
I think would be a good idea, and loving to

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.320
others.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.210
That may be the way we might work it out.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:39.120
By God's grace we have a very nice place as
an ashram.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.820
We might get even better place.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.600
You are the God's own blessed people.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:51.410
No one can believe that we could have such
a nice place.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.590
But, what are we willing to do for it?

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.280
That's the point, we should say.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.530
Don't take things for granted.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.010
I must warn you.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:13.580
I know England is the heart, but in God's
realms one can create many hearts, not so

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.450
difficult.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.640
So more harmony should be brought in.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:24.090
Even, you'll be surprised, in France, it's
so harmonious and so beautiful.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:31.220
Find faults with yourself all the time.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:37.490
Now, under certain circumstances I have to
appoint somebody, like I would say very personally,

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.980
I would say, Nick.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:43.850
Because Nick is doing no job nowadays, he
is quite a systematic person, is all right,

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:44.990
this thing.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.990
He has some problems, I know.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.690
You, too, have problems, all right?

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:54.680
But he's the one available today and he's
the one who is going to do it.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.560
Take one case.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:08.120
Now you must understand why Mother has appointed
somebody, all right?

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.040
Accept it.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:18.679
Because...
(speaking about the children) It's a big dance,

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.599
all that...

00:34:20.599 --> 00:34:29.240
They're trying to entertain... see, look at
this dancing.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:37.990
They are feeling the tenseness of the situation
and trying to entertain...

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:49.050
That's it; that is love.

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:59.720
See, they want to relax you, they want to
relax you, they want you to feel nice, to

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.720
be joyous.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.660
Look at them, in the same way, we should be.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.500
I am sure.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:17.790
I am sure now, henceforth.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:21.990
I think best thing is to make some poems.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:25.030
That may be a solution, all right?

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.750
Let's see.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.810
And let everybody start writing poems.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:32.150
Would be a good idea.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.620
And then that should work out.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.590
And sing the song of praises.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:50.130
It's very little way, just a very little way,
just there in your heart, resides the source

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:51.380
of all the beauty.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.060
It's just, turn your face towards that.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.250
That will work out.

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:01.990
I'm sure it will work out.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:06.950
It's not very far away.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:21.180
(aside) Let her also stand there, she'll enjoy.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:37.500
Now, another point was that you are going
to go to that peace mission or something.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.750
What peace?

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:44.430
What is that supposed to be?

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.000
In Brighton, you are?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.230
Peace festival, all right.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:55.850
And I'm told Kay has written an article about
it, peace.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:59.010
You know that peace is nothing without.

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:06.110
It is within yourself and if you can feel
your peace, then only you can start feeling

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:07.580
peace for others.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.960
Sahaja Yoga is the only way; there's no other
way out.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.140
You see, at the level of, say, take the position
of Falkland.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.380
Now, let's see, Falkland Island is a very
immediate problem.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.810
Now at that level there's no solution.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.710
There's no solution.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:32.250
They are quite justified in attacking back
Falkland, because these people were illegally

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.420
there, because that's not a democratic country.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.610
They have destroyed so many people of their
own.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:39.580
So, English were justified.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:46.360
Of course My all support was for them, because
they were correct on the justice point.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.060
That's true.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:57.390
But, justice is a little half-baked, because
for whom to fight?

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:03.500
These unrealized souls, their right, for what?

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:12.100
Even if you have democracy, if it is demonocracy,
what is the use of having democracy?

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:19.000
I mean, if through democracy, you are creating
only demons, this demonic reign, then what's

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.200
the use of having democracy, also?

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.950
What about this so-called communism?

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:27.400
All stupid people.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:35.320
To My eye, everybody is stupid and they cannot
achieve anything at that level.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.560
You can say little bit, "Yes, that's correct.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.230
After all, you see, that was their people
were there under democracy."

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.720
These people should have gone because they
have killed so many people.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:49.400
Already Argentina, they have no business and,
of course, despotic law is against, absolutely

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.550
against Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:54.380
So democracy is the best suited, no doubt.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.620
We have to support democracy.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:02.730
But, even democracy for what?

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:07.011
Why to have democracy?

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:09.460
To have the higher freedom.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.880
If you cannot have higher freedom, and it
just means abandonment, you see, democracy

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:20.620
means that an old man can marry a young girl
and all sorts of nonsensical things.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:26.980
Then better not to have.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:33.290
So democracy is only suitable to people who
are dharmic, who have established their dharma.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:40.720
Otherwise, you really need a communistic country
which will settle down your dharma most, to

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.290
evolve out of it.

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:47.850
But people think that democracy is for ruining
your dharma, you have freedom to ruin your

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.380
dharma as you like.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:53.540
You see, "What's wrong?"

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:57.211
It's a very, you see, you cannot say.

00:39:57.211 --> 00:39:58.580
It's a dilemma again.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:39:59.580
I don't know which way to go.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:00.580
It's another dilemma.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:08.730
So, to end up the dilemma you have to talk
to people, that though it might be justified

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:16.080
at this time, say Falkland thing, aggression,
it's for peace, because next time they won't

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.250
do such a thing again.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:23.370
It's really for peace, because next time such
a thing they may not try, these despots, and

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.640
there are all these Germans have gone and
settled there.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.040
So, is a good thing.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:32.320
But, still it's not peace, it has killed a
lot of people.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.730
This thing has happened.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:34.730
Why?

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:35.730
Because people are not realized souls.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.040
Come in, come in!

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.230
Come inside, there's a lot of space here,
move on.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:48.570
All those people who come first should come
this side.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:56.900
Can you move on this side, don't standing
up.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:02.360
So, all these political institutions are a
big joke, without realization.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.280
They're not yet fully human beings.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.790
They're not fully developed, because they
have not found their spirit.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.700
You must find your spirit.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:14.030
Unless and until you found your spirit, no
problem is going to be solved.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:21.300
Once your problem is solved, that is, to find
your spirit, all other problems are solved.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.300
How now?

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.330
What will happen?

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.030
Let's see.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:36.150
What will happen if we establish a kingdom
of the realized souls?

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:43.849
Let's hear... the scholar.

00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:51.370
What should happen?

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:58.800
Of course, everybody will get up early in
the morning, no doubt about it.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.100
Apart from that - that's the most difficult
thing.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.640
Tell Me.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:18.580
Whatever you say it will happen, so that's
what I'm asking.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:27.450
Yogi: Nobody will attack such a state.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:36.320
Shri Mataji: There won't be any states.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.720
You see, God has not made any states.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.190
It's a madness.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:43.190
I tell you, when I was born, I was surprised.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.190
Oh God, what has happened?

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:45.190
You see, God has not made any one of these
states.

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.190
It's a very different thing than what, you
see, I expected.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:50.400
You see, God has made a beautiful land, all
right, like this one, one sari like that.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:57.021
Now, you have to have some design, pattern,
so He made some beautiful mountains and some

00:42:57.021 --> 00:43:00.930
nice, you can say, areas.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:02.530
And some are desert, some are rich.

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:07.211
You see, it's to create ... the whole system,
if you see, has worked out in such a way that

00:43:07.211 --> 00:43:11.210
you have equator, and you have the sun there,
so the winds start moving.

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:19.200
You see, it's all created so beautifully,
so you have different types of countries and

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.890
different types of places.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:29.840
Now, after creating that, the human beings,
stupid as they are, they divided themselves

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.840
up.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.840
I mean, it is stupid.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.840
I tell you really there is no need to divide
like that.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:33.840
So they created states.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.840
There was no need to create a state.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:40.380
But you see it happened like this: that in
the beginning they created state, because

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:50.450
they wanted to have a, you can say, a hut
to protect themselves, then a village, then

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:53.740
a city, now a state.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:59.010
Now, after state what is the next situation?

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:00.990
The whole world!

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.990
Collective?

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:06.910
This is the breaking through.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:07.910
Is one world.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:08.910
It is.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:09.910
I believe it is.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:16.710
To Me it's nonsense to see it in so many ...
I can't understand walking in the, you see,

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:23.300
this Customs and all that, carrying your passport,
that criminal number so and so, and apart

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.820
from that you carry your photograph and then
tell so many things.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.630
Oh, by the way, My passport is completely
filled now.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:29.630
Have to get another one.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:30.630
It's like that.

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:32.890
You see, everywhere you go, you look like
a criminal.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:36.100
They look at your face and then they stamp
you.

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.790
All right, you are stamped.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:38.790
Go ahead.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:39.790
It's terrible.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:41.500
It's indignified, absolutely there.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.960
That means the human beings have no dignity
left in them.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.090
I mean, this land doesn't belong to you at
all.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:49.480
This is a land of God.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:54.220
You are of God and the land is.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:57.230
Nothing belongs to you, actually, to be very
frank.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:05.710
I'm sorry to say, it's true.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:11.960
So, what is a state?

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.960
This is stateless.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.960
But stateless also means there is state in
it.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.380
I say this is one world.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:19.460
This is, has been, is and will be.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:24.330
I mean you may in your myth, you see, hallucination,
think it is different and fight.

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:28.080
I sometimes feel you are just fighting your
shadows.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:33.700
This is the, you have created shadows and
the shadows are fighting and just to make

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.310
the shadows fight, you fight.

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:38.920
Otherwise, shadows won't fight.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.230
It's all a shadow.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:42.850
There's no truth in it.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:43.850
To Me it looks like that.

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:44.850
It's all madness.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:45.850
What is there to fight?

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:47.140
This is one world.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:51.370
Everybody is blessed by God.

00:45:51.370 --> 00:46:00.670
They all should enjoy His blessings to enter
into the kingdom of God.

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.271
He is the King.

00:46:02.271 --> 00:46:04.320
He is the one who is the ruler.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:11.840
In His kingdom there is nothing like a state.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.640
So that's a very different world you are entering
into.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.780
There are no alternatives there.

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:27.619
There is only one absolute state of mind where
you become the spirit, that's all.

00:46:27.619 --> 00:46:32.200
There's not going to be any aggression.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.090
It's stupid to be aggressive.

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:36.369
There's not going to be any suppression.

00:46:36.369 --> 00:46:38.640
It's stupid to do that.

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.050
Nobody's going to be suppressed and nobody's
going to take any suppression.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:42.050
Everybody ... Why?

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:48.500
Do you find that in the nature?

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.550
Nobody does that.

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:55.910
It's a harmonious living in the nature, even
in the animal kingdom.

00:46:55.910 --> 00:47:01.230
You see, they know that a tiger has to live
on an animal.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.320
It's all right.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:07.410
That cattle has its own life, finished.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:11.130
Even they can understand the need, but, human
beings don't.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:16.890
Their need is of spirit, and spirit hates,
actually hates aggression.

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:17.940
It cannot.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.990
It cannot.

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:24.650
Even if it wants to, it cannot.

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:30.940
It's indignified to aggress anyone, for a
spirit, indignified.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.880
Absolutely, it is wretched.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:49.180
So, that is what it is, that we'll all enjoy
love, love of God, His blessings, and all

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.210
our limitations will drop off.

00:47:51.210 --> 00:48:04.380
So-called bhoots, as you call them, they'll
all run away.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:10.190
It's a very different atmosphere of reality.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:17.220
This is all unreal, is absolutely unreal,
is an illusion, I tell you, because you know

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:21.450
that Brahma, His divine vibrations are doing
everything.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:30.340
They are working out everything, even material
things.

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:40.420
Everything they can achieve.

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:45.920
Apart from that, they give you that source
of joy which takes you onto that atmosphere

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:51.470
where you exist and enjoy.

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:57.900
All the illusions created by human beings
will drop out.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.200
This is all illusion.

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:04.550
Believe Me, it's all illusion.

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:09.190
There is no truth in it at all.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:16.580
But through illusion, you can work out.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:26.790
It's a very interesting thing that only through
illusion you can work out, because when I'm

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:33.920
talking to you I have to keep an illusion
of being here.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.600
Otherwise, you won't pay any attention.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.369
You wouldn't see Me; you wouldn't know Me;
you wouldn't talk to Me.

00:49:38.369 --> 00:49:42.920
So, you have to have an illusion.

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.830
But, I know this is illusion.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:50.410
That's all.

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:58.250
Living in this world, in this illusion, if
you know it's an illusion, that's done.

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:10.990
You are going to be tomorrow's citizens, no
doubt, of a very high level quality.

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:12.920
The day will come when they will have to jolly
well consult us.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.741
Already you have seen how I am playing tricks
on the U.S.

00:50:15.741 --> 00:50:21.250
Did you hear the way the lady made mistakes,
you see, the stupid things?

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:22.250
Did you find that?

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:23.250
I saw her photograph and I said, "Oh, this
stupid woman."

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:24.250
She just raised her hand like that.

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:34.480
Now they are realizing, you know, they don't
know what happens and then suddenly how they

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:35.710
go amok.

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:42.080
They'll all go amok and then they will have
to find out how they should be controlled,

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.800
what has happened, how did it happen.

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:50.250
All these tricks one has to play, with all
of them.

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:57.260
Now, after the last war perhaps people may
not come out with very aggressive words, perhaps,

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.790
maybe, because it will be unpopular.

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:08.950
But they'll do such stupid things, you see,
to prove that they are good for nothing.

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:11.540
All this can be done.

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.790
But, you must know it is an illusion, all
of you, because you are different things.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:16.340
You are seeing through different eyes.

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.620
You know is what Brahma is.

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:24.160
So, you must know and raise your quality.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.600
Raise your quality.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:39.130
In normal life, supposing, you see, like I'll
say that somebody is a peon, then he dresses

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:41.660
up in a particular way.

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:43.480
Then he suddenly becomes an officer.

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:49.430
Then he becomes a different style, you see,
walks in a different way; his gait changes;

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:50.940
style changes.

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:57.160
So, now you have become prophets, whole thing
has to change.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:02.740
Either you don't accept this position, but
if you are accepted this position and you

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.120
are paid for it, then better be that.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:20.990
I mean, you can't dress up like a peon if
you are an officer, can you?

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:25.130
It's all illusion, complete illusion.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:29.540
The whole thing is an illusion.

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:33.040
All these kings of yours and queens are like
dolls there before you.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.400
Especially Mr. Pope, you see, who came here.

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:40.120
My grandson says, "Mr. Poke came here."

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.720
I said, "Poke?"

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.380
He said, "I'm sorry, Pork.

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:47.040
He was talking all rubbish."

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.040
I said, "How do you know?"

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:54.230
"Because all his chakras were catching."

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:57.620
And he is supposed to be the Pope in charge.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:01.670
Now, Bishop of Canterbury, see, is another
funny man.

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:02.950
I've seen him on the thing.

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:03.950
He was agnostic about everything.

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:06.369
I don't know about Christ also, maybe.

00:53:06.369 --> 00:53:07.980
He said, "I'm agnostic."

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:10.800
Any question you ask him, "I'm agnostic."

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.640
Is a very good escape he has got, you see.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:17.020
He's agnostic of about everything, because
he says, "It's a mystery to me."

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.570
So, what are you doing there?

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:20.070
I mean, if it's a mystery to you, you're agnostic.

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:26.580
I mean, I just don't understand how is he
there.

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:34.820
So, some people have taken up upon themselves
this crusade, I believe, and to talk to him.

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:42.750
I mean, how can you talk to your shadow?

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:44.730
Can you?

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:53.810
So, the people live in the shadow state and
you should not symbolize yourself as shadows.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:57.190
You should symbolize yourself as reality and
look at them as shadows, you see.

00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:58.190
In a way, in a very dignified way, "This is
a shadow, you know."

00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:09.880
Just pick it up, but, not in an aggressive
way, but have compassion about them.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:13.330
Say, "No, no, sir, this is not so.

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:15.460
You are sadly mistaken.

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.550
This is a shadow of life."

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:28.210
The whole Christianity is doomed because they
started running after shadow.

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:29.820
This Mr. Saint Paul, I don't know how he came
into Bible.

00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.820
Now, you are a theologist.

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:32.060
You tell Me, John.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.770
How did he enter?

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:39.190
I mean, anybody who says he saw Christ, is
he supposed to enter into the Bible?

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:41.130
How did he?

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:51.830
I mean, his saying and his words and his letters
are regarded as the letters from the Bible,

00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:56.670
after Christ.

00:54:56.670 --> 00:55:02.900
Before Christ is all right, but after Christ.

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:03.900
What is the validity?

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:04.900
I don't understand.

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:10.960
What is the credibility of this person entering
into that as an authority?

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:11.960
How?

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.720
When nobody challenged him.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:21.369
He was a man who was killing so many people
before.

00:55:21.369 --> 00:55:25.460
Then, suddenly he becomes something and he
starts saying, "I'm doing Christ's work,"

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.810
and this and that and writes letter to Corinthians
and all these people and all that.

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:28.270
And why these letters that he writes becomes
a Bible?

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:30.850
Can you imagine?

00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:37.750
What did he do in his own lifetime?

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:47.150
Half of it he spent in killing and half of
it is he was an imposter.

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:50.180
I am happy that it has come to your notice.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.580
But one can ask, "Why?

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:58.099
Why is he there?"

00:55:58.099 --> 00:56:01.630
Now, he started this charismatic thing; he
is doing all this.

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:03.160
I first saw it in India.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.430
There's a Saint Paul's Church.

00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:08.290
They're all possessed people, you know, and
one of My uncles was the priest of that.

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:11.800
He was a very possessed man, very hot-tempered,
horrible.

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:17.990
And when I saw that, I wanted to see the Saint
Paul's Bible what he has written about.

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:19.030
I was amazed.

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:26.070
But I said, "Let you people read and see for
yourself."

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:34.500
And this horrible charismatic movement is
anti-God activity, absolutely anti-God activity.

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:40.330
So, if you have to talk to the gentleman,
you have to tell him about it, that it is

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:41.330
possession.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:45.950
The Seventh Day Adventist and what other is
this Pentecost, is nothing but that.

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:50.849
Jamaicans are doing, all of them are great
spiritually-developed people - spiritually

00:56:50.849 --> 00:56:53.750
in the pub.

00:56:53.750 --> 00:57:06.050
I mean, there should be certain norms, isn't
it, about a person who is supposed to be a

00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:14.530
prophet or something, something to do with
God, you see.

00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:18.109
The world is coming to a position where they
are understanding; but you see, once they

00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:27.460
start disregarding, the danger is this: once
they start disregarding these things, because

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:36.140
they are myths and falsehood, they will disregard
also God and all the truth about God.

00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:38.280
They can become communists.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:42.090
That's the easiest way.

00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:48.980
Then there is no return.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:51.890
It's a dangerous situation.

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:56.880
When you talk to him you have to tell him,
warn him.

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.140
Already your churches are selling here.

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:02.510
Nobody goes to church.

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:07.020
Now, about the environment.

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:13.000
They are having a meeting on environment.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.850
That, too, is only solved through spirit.

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:21.730
All environment problems can be solved only
spiritual, if you have spiritual ascent.

00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:22.730
Otherwise, you cannot.

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:29.130
You try anything; it's like patching up the
sky.

00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:35.750
See now, it's a very deep-rooted thing that
we don't understand that spirit is the most

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:37.780
practical thing.

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:41.470
You see, we think spirit, we think it's like
a drunkard, you know.

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:47.030
Spiritual man, he's a cult, he's a drunkard,
he's most abnormal.

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:48.050
He's funny.

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:49.960
Either he hits people or runs away from them.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:54.340
This is the idea we have got about a spiritual
personality.

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:59.130
But just see you are spiritual.

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:10.950
You will find it impossible to use plastics
after some time, because you will know that

00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:15.359
the plastics give you horrid vibrations.

00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:23.180
After some time you will really find it repulsive.

00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:29.560
It's all right to sit in a train for a while
on a plastic coach, all right, but, to sit

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:37.619
in your house on a plastic all the time would
be horrible and to wear a plastic coat all

00:59:37.619 --> 00:59:43.430
the time, our body will refuse.

00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:50.619
So when people will be spiritually awakened,
they'll give up all these nonsensical things.

00:59:50.619 --> 00:59:54.421
So, they may say then, "What will happen to
the machines?"

00:59:54.421 --> 01:00:01.530
Now, machines are for us; we are not for the
machines.

01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:05.660
This is another concept is: whatever is created
is for us and we are not for that.

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:06.930
All right, doesn't matter.

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:09.160
Nothing will go wrong with the machines.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:14.010
Machines should be used for anything that
is a public work.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:21.480
Like for your motor cars, for your trains,
trams, all public work which is outside.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:25.080
For houses at the most you can use machines.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:31.119
But, for personal things, you must use handmade
things, handmade things.

01:00:31.119 --> 01:00:37.580
For spiritual people, you like to wear something
that is handmade or real.

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.090
I can't wear a nylon sari.

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:44.670
Not that I am very fussy about things, but
I just can't wear.

01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:49.780
After some time, if I do not take out My socks,
which are only nylon, what to do?

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:55.400
My vibrations get jammed, completely.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:02.640
So, you won't be able to wear next to your
skin, near your skin, near your body, eating

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.290
your food, everything in plastics, cooking
in plastics.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:06.849
I mean it's too much.

01:01:06.849 --> 01:01:11.270
Thank God, cooking I don't think is possible,
isn't it?

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:13.230
But aluminium is another thing.

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:15.349
It's very bad.

01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:17.920
Aluminium - you won't be able to use.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.730
You'll either try copper or brass, I think
so.

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:26.720
Now, handmade things we may have, because
they are made by hand, so they have vibrations.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.170
People would like to have handmade.

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:34.869
It is a part, so by that we remove the disparity
of the world.

01:01:34.869 --> 01:01:38.130
Developing countries can do handmade things.

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:41.869
You cannot beat them with computers.

01:01:41.869 --> 01:01:43.849
Can you?

01:01:43.849 --> 01:01:47.200
You go ahead, mad with your computers.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.410
You'll have to come back.

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:52.599
You must understand the whole.

01:01:52.599 --> 01:01:56.730
If you don't understand the whole, this is
what is happening: like mad, you know computers

01:01:56.730 --> 01:01:58.580
are going ahead, ahead.

01:01:58.580 --> 01:01:59.580
Where?

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:02.880
Into the ditch, into a big mountain.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:12.050
Now they have created a big mountains of plastic
and they don't know what to do with it.

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:17.780
So, and now with computer, what will they
do?

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:22.190
They'll create a greater mountains out of
plastics.

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:26.670
Maybe a Himalaya might be created, with the
computer.

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:32.630
So the developing countries should not try
to follow these mad people on one side.

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:36.730
They should develop their hand things and
all that, because they'll have to come back.

01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:42.060
Now, the handmade things in this country are
so important and so expensive.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:45.470
You don't care whether it is pressed or not.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:54.340
But in India you have to take nylons, because
they say nylons is a symbol of development,

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.400
not of over-development, perhaps, but of development.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:03.160
So they must take to nylons and plastics and
to stainless steel and aluminium, if possible.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.320
That's what we are doing.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:11.740
When you have less things consumed like that,
you use less things from your motherland,

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:16.610
because handmade you cannot go on mad like
a machine goes, like a rakshasa eating away

01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:17.610
everything and producing more.

01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:19.200
She has to live like that.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.590
It's not economical.

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:26.070
So when you have handmade things you have
more value for your things, you look after

01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:35.990
them better, you feel better, you are comfortable
and you need not be that smart, you see, machine-made.

01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:38.180
That idea of smartness is going down.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:41.730
So, the developing countries should also learn
a lesson.

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:42.820
They are going after you.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:43.820
They are running fast.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.840
They try to run faster; they cannot.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.050
Thank God, they cannot.

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:50.720
But they should stick on to that side.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.540
You see, one part of the country has to do
something; another part has to do something

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.540
else.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:02.780
But, you people have to look after the side
of machines, all right?

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:07.530
I mean, handmade things, what can you make?

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:15.619
Some ceramics, I think - apologies, some apologies
for that.

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:19.990
You better do what you know better and let
them do what they can do better and share

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.990
it.

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:32.800
If this balance is established, there's no
aggression.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.130
Unemployment can be solved.

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:36.770
All the problems can be solved, if you take
to handmade things.

01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:40.060
You should take to handmade things as far
as possible.

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.990
Sahaja yogis should use handmade things.

01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:48.670
I mean, not the cars, but for their personal
use.

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:54.040
Even I would say, soaps that you use are horrid.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:59.510
The soaps that you get in England are not
meant for your skins at all, for sahaja yogis'

01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:00.510
skin.

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:01.630
I can't bear them.

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:09.830
What you have to use is natural soaps that
you get from any country you feel like, but

01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:12.990
natural soaps, which come from natural oils.

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:20.620
Foods also, natural food you must eat, more
natural food, than artificial.

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:25.710
All that will give you a better living and
that is called as alternative, all right.

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:30.960
That's alternative is important, but that
doesn't mean you go on a bullock cart.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:37.080
You can export your trains to India, or your
cars to India and get khadi from there.

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:38.940
All right?

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:46.520
Mutual understanding, because we are part
and parcel of one whole and we just cannot

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:50.700
exist by our only growth because then we become
malignant, you see.

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:51.700
One cells eats another.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:52.700
You have to.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:58.400
If you have a machinery, you have to eat other,
because you produce so much.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.080
You must find markets for them, you must supply
them, you must send over and then you must

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:06.560
have other countries to exploit them.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:10.200
People have tremendous respect for Mahatma
Gandhi, but I don't know if people understand

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.370
what he said about machinery.

01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:17.410
That doesn't mean the people who are doing
machine work should give up, by any chance,

01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:20.910
but, some of them they can close down.

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:27.650
For example, plastic toys for children is
horrifying.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:32.280
You can't even get wood toys now - nothing,
just plastic.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.280
They are touching plastic.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.480
I mean, imagine, you cannot feel any plastic.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:44.990
So, this is what a sane sahaja yogi has to
understand.

01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:48.450
That's how you can solve the problem of environment,
also.

01:06:48.450 --> 01:07:01.730
Thank God, somehow with your affluence and
too much of machinery, all the western people

01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:08.280
- I am happy to know, even in Portugal - realize
the value of handmade things.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:15.339
But in India if you offer somebody in an handmade
thing they'll say, "Oh God, they have no money."

01:07:15.339 --> 01:07:23.070
But stainless steel, "Great."

01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:26.870
In a stainless steel, glass they'll give you
tea, you see - it's very big.

01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:33.260
If you give it in a ceramic, "Oh, what this,
village craft?"

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:36.520
They are to be told.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.900
But, if you create a demand, they'll be all
right; they'll look after their handmade.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.140
And here you can't do much.

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:47.980
I've seen, you see, that neatness, that deftness
is not there; that's lacking; now they've

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.980
lost it.

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.770
Very few people have that left in them.

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:55.370
Even if they have to cut one coat with their
hands, they cannot do it.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:08:02.890
They have to use a machine, which cuts twenty-five
coats at a time, you see.

01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:09.200
Then this problem of, you have to have a figure
exactly because these only can fit certain

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.200
figures.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.410
You can't have your own independent figure.

01:08:11.410 --> 01:08:13.690
This is all machine-like stuff, you see.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:16.150
You all must have that figure, otherwise doesn't
fit it.

01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:17.779
So, that is an ideal figure.

01:08:17.779 --> 01:08:19.540
So, everybody works out for that.

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:23.880
See, there's a new machinery comes up, you
see, for that kind of a thing, then new styles

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.799
come up.

01:08:26.799 --> 01:08:30.910
It's such an artificial thing, all man-made,
artificial.

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:41.959
From your democracy, your politics to your
economics, to all your so-called ideas of

01:08:41.959 --> 01:08:45.299
creativity, everything becomes so artificial.

01:08:45.299 --> 01:08:46.909
Now people can't paint.

01:08:46.909 --> 01:08:51.499
What they paint, if you see, you are just
aghast.

01:08:51.499 --> 01:08:54.909
You don't know what is this supposed to be.

01:08:54.909 --> 01:08:57.069
And it is supposed to be so that it looks,
"There's a hand, isn't it?

01:08:57.069 --> 01:08:58.949
Can't you see that?"

01:08:58.949 --> 01:09:01.509
"Yes, I can.

01:09:01.509 --> 01:09:05.769
It's a little bit showing."

01:09:05.769 --> 01:09:07.369
They can't do anything.

01:09:07.369 --> 01:09:19.660
We can't have Shakespeare, we can't have Gauguin,
we can't have anyone of that type.

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:25.460
We can't have, say, Abraham Lincoln.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:32.019
You can have only machines, you see, bolts
and nuts, fitted nicely.

01:09:32.019 --> 01:09:35.209
You're fixed, you're fixed, you're fixed,
you're fixed.

01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:36.209
Everybody fixed nicely.

01:09:36.209 --> 01:09:39.309
Where do, I mean, this brain go?

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:40.459
Where will this heart go?

01:09:40.459 --> 01:09:43.270
What will it do then?

01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:44.270
It cannot collapse.

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:48.639
I mean, as long as you are existing, the heart
has to beat.

01:09:48.639 --> 01:09:55.559
01:09:53 So all this artificiality has to
be overcome by sahaja yogis.

01:09:55.559 --> 01:09:58.119
The responsibility is so great.

01:09:58.119 --> 01:10:08.070
Such a big building you have to bear on your
shoulders, and the foundation stones have

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:16.369
to get up in the morning to be chiseled out
properly.

01:10:16.369 --> 01:10:20.260
So, I end up My lecture today.

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:22.480
May God bless you!

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.249
Now I am getting self-conscious.

01:10:25.249 --> 01:10:28.579
Will you please put it off?

01:10:28.579 --> 01:10:29.690
All right.

01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:34.689
Now, today I have come specially to discuss
about ...
