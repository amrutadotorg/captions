Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure, July16th 1995

00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:14.669
It is a very important Guru Puja today

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:24.150
because we have completed twenty-five
years of Guru Puja.

00:02:29.674 --> 00:02:33.405
(Hindi: "Please put the fan in the rotating
manner".)

00:02:57.722 --> 00:03:06.389
Also, it is extremely beautiful

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:19.017
to see so many Sahaja Yogis who are,
really have become, very great.

00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:29.811
It’s a question of understanding what
Sahaja Yoga is.

00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:34.834
It's a very unique discovery, I feel now,

00:03:35.035 --> 00:03:44.837
that people who were seeking the Truth
have found it

00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:55.587
and have now got it absolutely on their
central nervous system.

00:03:57.202 --> 00:04:00.812
Yes, in some places it’s difficult to
explain

00:04:01.013 --> 00:04:04.400
how it has happened, how it has worked out

00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:09.200
and how, in these twenty-five years, we
have been able

00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:15.855
to achieve this expansion of Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:19.122 --> 00:04:27.588
The main thing, I feel, is that you all
should know

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:34.354
that as the tree grows, the roots have
to grow much deeper

00:04:34.555 --> 00:04:39.660
and they should spread also. If it doesn't
happen,

00:04:39.861 --> 00:04:45.639
the tree cannot be sustained only by Mother
Earth.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:53.481
So the roots are in your own life, in your
own heart.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.900
When we say we have become our own Guru,

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:07.011
we should really try to find out with our
introspection:

00:05:07.212 --> 00:05:11.861
Are we our Guru or not?

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.180
Because, before this your mind was on one
side

00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:29.226
and your heart was on another side

00:05:29.427 --> 00:05:34.972
and your attention was in another
dimension.

00:05:35.173 --> 00:05:41.732
So these three things were creating
confusion within you.

00:05:50.107 --> 00:05:57.146
If you understand a human being, then you
will be surprised to see

00:05:57.347 --> 00:06:05.805
how these three things act separately in a
human being. And sometimes they fight also.

00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:10.154
First is your intellect and your mind.

00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:17.146
Second is your heart, your feelings, your
emotions.

00:06:25.141 --> 00:06:33.555
And the third one is your attention.

00:06:35.363 --> 00:06:41.232
In these modern times, this confusion is
the worst

00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:45.781
because all the time your attention is
outside.

00:06:45.982 --> 00:06:52.822
It could be towards beautiful things, or
beautiful women, or beautiful men or

00:06:53.023 --> 00:06:59.451
all kinds of nonsensical way of wasting
your energy.

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:05.713
Such attention then is absolutely like
a horse which is let loose.

00:07:05.914 --> 00:07:08.976
You cannot control such an attention.

00:07:09.177 --> 00:07:17.064
And this attention runs wild from one
to another.

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:21.131
It’s a fashion also. It’s sort of a very
popular thing

00:07:21.332 --> 00:07:25.593
to keep the attention moving all the time.

00:07:25.794 --> 00:07:31.636
But this attention that has to be towards
the Divine,

00:07:31.837 --> 00:07:40.146
towards the Almighty, is just being
frittered away.

00:07:40.347 --> 00:07:47.138
Thus, attention doesn’t grow its own roots.

00:07:48.812 --> 00:07:54.300
First is to find out about yourself: where
does your attention go?

00:07:54.501 --> 00:08:07.225
What makes you feel like looking after or
concerned for attention?

00:08:07.426 --> 00:08:12.229
You see, the attention comes from various
problems,

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:22.797
and could be your upbringing where you are
not controlled,

00:08:27.024 --> 00:08:37.016
could be your education, could be your
atmosphere in which you live

00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:42.989
or could be your own ego or your
conditioning.

00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:49.628
(Hindi: "The water is maybe a bit too cold,
that's why.

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:04.167
What is it, tea? Is it hot?

00:09:05.182 --> 00:09:09.186
Pour it here, I'll drink it.

00:09:19.196 --> 00:09:21.539
That's fine".)

00:09:25.405 --> 00:09:33.446
So, this attention is being attacked

00:09:33.977 --> 00:09:45.595
by all these outside energies or negative
forces

00:09:45.925 --> 00:09:53.174
and it gets entangled - like a river
flowing

00:09:53.375 --> 00:10:02.546
straight into the ocean can get lost
in a barren place.

00:10:02.747 --> 00:10:12.450
In the same way this attention, which has
to go towards the Divine,

00:10:12.651 --> 00:10:16.749
gets frittered away and is vanished...

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:23.273
This weak attention cannot take you towards
the Divine.

00:10:23.474 --> 00:10:30.213
Ultimately you find that all this attention
is being completely

00:10:30.907 --> 00:10:37.947
absorbed or frittered away by the nonsense
that’s going on.

00:10:38.148 --> 00:10:43.611
Unfortunately or fortunately, you are born
in these modern times,

00:10:43.812 --> 00:10:48.963
and in these modern times, as you know,
it's a very chaotic condition.

00:10:49.164 --> 00:10:54.164
In these chaotic conditions, you don’t know
what is right and what is wrong.

00:10:54.365 --> 00:10:59.742
And there are all kinds of attractions,

00:10:59.943 --> 00:11:08.858
which can take away your attention and
reduce the energy of your attention.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:17.532
It is possible more for the people who are
very right-sided.

00:11:17.733 --> 00:11:21.491
Also the left-sided people can be very much
affected.

00:11:21.692 --> 00:11:27.299
Right-sided people, as you know, go up to
a point and become extremely dry,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:34.900
self-opinionated and aggressive. All their
attention is in aggression,

00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:41.188
while the people who are on the left side
are indulging too much

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:48.787
into their own whims and their desires and
their own temptations.

00:11:48.988 --> 00:11:53.136
Both sides can fritter away your attention

00:11:53.337 --> 00:12:00.104
which is the most important thing. It is
the most valuable thing is your attention.

00:12:00.305 --> 00:12:04.933
But the attention cannot be controlled by
a person

00:12:05.134 --> 00:12:12.845
who doesn't have a weak mind or a weak
heart.

00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:17.821
Now supposing you take somebody who is
a very intelligent person.

00:12:18.022 --> 00:12:22.062
The intelligent person puts all his
attention

00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:26.369
in capturing the attention of others.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:31.247
I don't know why, but it’s a kind of
a paradox.

00:12:31.448 --> 00:12:41.396
The person who himself is having such a lot
of aggressiveness and all that,

00:12:41.597 --> 00:12:45.766
tries to be very sweet, tries to be very
nice with people

00:12:45.967 --> 00:12:54.501
just to keep good relations or, we can say,
the good behavior

00:12:54.702 --> 00:12:59.799
towards people so that they pay attention
to that person.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.949
This is a very subtle thing. They are not
even aware about it,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:12.087
that we do such a thing just to make others
pay attention to us.

00:13:12.288 --> 00:13:15.891
That is how we have seen that in these
modern times

00:13:16.092 --> 00:13:21.780
so many stupid things people do just
to attract the attention of others.

00:13:21.981 --> 00:13:30.761
Most of the fads that had come up in modern
times

00:13:30.962 --> 00:13:39.097
are just to make something stupid so that
people should pay attention to them.

00:13:41.148 --> 00:13:46.282
Of course, the Sahaja Yogis are not like
that. But I am just pointing it out

00:13:46.483 --> 00:13:49.562
how, in the modern times, you have to be
very careful

00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:56.274
that you should not try to attract
the attention of others.

00:13:56.475 --> 00:14:01.657
Instead of that, what you have to do is
to pay attention to others

00:14:01.858 --> 00:14:06.178
in a very subtle way, not with any
expectation

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:08.325
that if you are paying attention to
somebody,

00:14:08.526 --> 00:14:13.725
that person should pay attention to you.
It’s a very big struggle,

00:14:13.926 --> 00:14:22.044
I’ve seen, in Sahaja Yoga also, that people
try to, say, become very popular

00:14:22.245 --> 00:14:30.307
or become very outstanding, or something
of a very great qualities,

00:14:30.508 --> 00:14:35.035
to show off that they are something better
than others.

00:14:35.236 --> 00:14:40.712
A person who is really in connection with
the Divine, is least bothered

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:45.898
about how people pay attention to that
person,

00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:52.674
but automatically the attention of such
a person is on others,

00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:56.089
which is very, very subtle, very subtle.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:00.322
You cannot make out that the attention
of such a person

00:15:00.523 --> 00:15:06.521
is on you, but it works and it works
beautifully.

00:15:06.722 --> 00:15:12.123
We have to understand that we have now come
to the realm of the Divinity.

00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:17.220
We are in the Kingdom of God and we are
divine people.

00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:21.739
We are very powerful people, but if we
fritter away

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.699
our attention, we become very, very weak
people.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:31.696
It's easy to feel that, “we are Sahaja
Yogis”, “we have done

00:15:31.884 --> 00:15:37.973
so much of realisation of others” or
“we have helped so many people.”

00:15:38.174 --> 00:15:42.033
All this consciousness if it comes within
you, then know

00:15:42.234 --> 00:15:46.363
that you are still not fully developed
Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:46.564 --> 00:15:52.460
There should be no consciousness of what
you are doing or what you are committing.

00:15:52.661 --> 00:16:00.732
There is no need to boast about it. There
is no need to advertise it.

00:16:00.933 --> 00:16:05.250
Whatever you are, is already, can be seen
by everyone.

00:16:05.451 --> 00:16:09.198
But even that desire is not needed

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:15.413
because you are doing just for
the satisfaction of your Spirit.

00:16:16.504 --> 00:16:20.360
So then, when we come to our heart:

00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:24.096
in the heart resides the Spirit, as you
know very well.

00:16:24.297 --> 00:16:32.008
Now, when it is the heart, which has
to work over your brain and which can work,

00:16:32.209 --> 00:16:36.868
what becomes of you is nothing, but you
become a source

00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:40.426
of love and compassion. A source, I am
saying.

00:16:40.627 --> 00:16:46.296
You do not assert on others. You do not say
that, “I’ve done so much for you

00:16:46.497 --> 00:16:55.660
and what are you doing to me? What is this
that I should have so much expressed,

00:16:55.861 --> 00:16:58.648
in so many ways, and here you are,

00:16:58.849 --> 00:17:03.225
you are forgetting me and not doing
anything for me?”

00:17:03.426 --> 00:17:08.931
So the expectation of reward if it is
there,

00:17:09.132 --> 00:17:13.383
then you must know is your mind which is
giving you these ideas

00:17:13.584 --> 00:17:20.173
and is working it out that way that you
just now put attention

00:17:20.374 --> 00:17:24.106
to the amount of love the other person
has given you

00:17:24.307 --> 00:17:31.707
for whatever you have given to another
person. It's very subtle.

00:17:34.156 --> 00:17:40.871
So in Sahaja Yoga, you should see now
yourself as just a source of love,

00:17:41.072 --> 00:17:45.012
which is just flowing.

00:17:45.213 --> 00:17:50.567
In that, you do not say that you have
to have this or that,

00:17:50.768 --> 00:17:58.158
or you have to achieve this goal, or you
have to become that. It's finished now.

00:17:58.359 --> 00:18:05.234
Once you have become the source, then how
can you become something?

00:18:05.435 --> 00:18:11.453
The thing is, those who are receiving from
the source want to have

00:18:11.654 --> 00:18:23.414
some sort of a reward or some sort of
a recognition.

00:18:23.615 --> 00:18:29.825
In this subtle way if you move, your mind
is very clever.

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:34.952
In Sahaja Yoga, we have very clever,
intelligent people.

00:18:35.153 --> 00:18:42.778
But this mind... You have to be very
careful because this mind can cheat you.

00:18:44.694 --> 00:18:49.391
So ask your mind, "Why are you in Sahaja
Yoga?

00:18:49.592 --> 00:18:54.157
What is the purpose of your Sahaja Yoga?"

00:18:55.482 --> 00:19:03.761
Gradually this mind will shut up. And then,
you have to ask yourself that,

00:19:03.962 --> 00:19:12.286
"What is my own desire now? What do I want?

00:19:12.487 --> 00:19:19.090
What do I want to achieve? Why I am
in Sahaja Yoga?"

00:19:19.836 --> 00:19:24.015
If you ask this question, you will see
you’ll just dissolve,

00:19:24.216 --> 00:19:29.497
you'll become thoughtless because there is
no desire left now.

00:19:29.698 --> 00:19:33.385
There is no ambition left, no competition.

00:19:33.586 --> 00:19:38.833
All these qualities are of the brain, or we
can say, of the intellect,

00:19:39.034 --> 00:19:44.443
which makes you competitive, which makes
you also jealous.

00:19:44.644 --> 00:19:48.694
So jealousy is also a product of this
competitiveness

00:19:48.895 --> 00:19:53.473
because when two persons are competing
or many are competing

00:19:53.674 --> 00:19:57.681
and one is selected, others become jealous.

00:19:57.882 --> 00:20:03.684
I mean, instead of feeling happy, "All
right. So, one of us has become something,

00:20:03.885 --> 00:20:06.142
so we should be very happy that he has
become."

00:20:06.343 --> 00:20:11.753
On the contrary, the other people feel
jealous, "Why has he become?

00:20:11.954 --> 00:20:16.150
Who is he? What does he think of himself?"
Then they go further.

00:20:16.351 --> 00:20:21.004
Not you people, but on the whole, people
go further with it

00:20:21.205 --> 00:20:26.578
and what do they do is to harm another
person.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:32.727
In Sahaja Yoga, people are also sometimes
very worried and frightened.

00:20:32.928 --> 00:20:35.789
There is no need to be worried or
frightened

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:43.128
because now you have become a Sahaja
Yogi and a Guru. Nobody can touch you.

00:20:43.329 --> 00:20:49.378
Anybody who tries to touch you will be
subsided, somehow or other.

00:20:49.579 --> 00:20:55.659
Of course, I don't do anything as such.
But today only I heard that in Turkey

00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:02.320
there were two newspapers who were after
Sahaja Yoga, writing all nonsensical things.

00:21:02.521 --> 00:21:09.449
So, the first one met with an accident and
died. I didn't do that.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:14.875
The second one had two people, editor
and sub-editor,

00:21:15.076 --> 00:21:20.782
were killed and somebody cut their throats.
Of course, I didn't do that.

00:21:20.983 --> 00:21:23.715
Some fundamentalist must have done, or
somebody must have done.

00:21:23.916 --> 00:21:28.989
Now, we don't have to worry as to who
criticizes you, they say it about you

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.964
because you must know they are blind
people.

00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:38.110
They are absolutely blind, they are not
matured as far as the wisdom is concerned.

00:21:38.311 --> 00:21:42.126
For them to understand Sahaja Yoga is not
possible.

00:21:42.327 --> 00:21:45.684
They go up to a point and then they stop.
They cannot go further

00:21:45.885 --> 00:21:48.924
because this dissolution of your being,

00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:55.306
as I said, “the drop becomes the ocean”.

00:21:55.799 --> 00:22:00.659
It's difficult, specially in the West,
where there are so many ideas

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:08.834
of their own identifications and of their
own personalities.

00:22:09.938 --> 00:22:16.537
Now, it is quite, again, a paradox that we
don’t want people

00:22:16.738 --> 00:22:23.597
to dress up indecently or we don’t want
people to behave indecently.

00:22:23.798 --> 00:22:28.315
Decency is a very big part of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:28.516 --> 00:22:33.757
So one can ask that, "Mother, when you say
you have to completely dissolve,

00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:37.060
then why should we have this dignity?

00:22:37.261 --> 00:22:40.678
Why should we worry about having
the dignity?" It's quite all right.

00:22:40.879 --> 00:22:44.089
This question is all right. The answer is
like this:

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:56.843
Supposing, you put a drop of some filth in
the ocean, then the ocean can become dirty.

00:22:57.044 --> 00:23:02.229
If you put some poison, then the whole
ocean can become poisonous.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:09.197
In the same way, whatever is not congenial
to the ocean,

00:23:09.398 --> 00:23:13.833
to this Divine power, should not be done.

00:23:14.034 --> 00:23:20.369
Otherwise, you will spoil the whole of it.
We have had experiences.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.490
We have had Sahaja Yogis who were leaders
also,

00:23:24.691 --> 00:23:30.498
and they tried to be quite funny and
the whole collectivity was spoilt.

00:23:30.699 --> 00:23:36.873
One person who is not a good person can
spoil the whole collectivity.

00:23:37.074 --> 00:23:44.179
The one who is then a leader, on top
of that, is even worse.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:50.350
So, one has to understand that, when you
are becoming a drop of the ocean,

00:23:50.551 --> 00:23:56.223
this ocean is the pure ocean of love.

00:23:56.424 --> 00:24:02.343
In that you should not do something that
will create repulsion, frustration,

00:24:02.544 --> 00:24:11.957
or even sometimes it can create a very
grotesque image of the whole ocean.

00:24:12.158 --> 00:24:16.902
That is why we have to be decent people,
decorous people.

00:24:17.103 --> 00:24:24.255
It is not that in any way we want you to be
like a dandy people or anything,

00:24:24.456 --> 00:24:29.814
but what it means that you must respect
your body, respect yourself

00:24:30.015 --> 00:24:34.186
and a respectable personality you should
have.

00:24:34.387 --> 00:24:37.399
Too much indulgence to that is not proper,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.913
but it should be such that you should
respect yourself.

00:24:42.114 --> 00:24:45.570
It's very important. If you cannot respect
yourself

00:24:45.771 --> 00:24:51.778
you cannot respect at all the Divinity
within you.

00:24:51.979 --> 00:24:57.862
It's like a decoration of the Divinity that
your whole behavior,

00:24:58.063 --> 00:25:02.900
your whole attire has to be in such a way
that people should know

00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:05.906
that he is a decent man.

00:25:06.107 --> 00:25:12.726
Indecent things have come out and have
become now an everyday fashion.

00:25:12.927 --> 00:25:16.642
And they go on coming one after another
because of the entrepreneurs,

00:25:16.843 --> 00:25:19.201
and we are playing into the hands
of entrepreneurs.

00:25:19.402 --> 00:25:22.423
But if you know what dress you have to wear

00:25:22.624 --> 00:25:26.296
and what is good for you, once for all you
have to decide.

00:25:26.497 --> 00:25:29.830
Now the attention should not be also wasted

00:25:30.031 --> 00:25:33.180
in that, "I will today, I'll wear this kind
of a sari,

00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:36.361
tomorrow I’ll wear that kind of a dress,
third day…",

00:25:36.562 --> 00:25:41.730
because that also spoils the attention.
But if it is a decent thing,

00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:45.490
it's perfectly alright, and that will
really make you feel

00:25:45.691 --> 00:25:49.195
dignified within yourself.

00:25:49.396 --> 00:25:52.178
In modern times, as the people are, I don't
think

00:25:52.379 --> 00:25:55.798
they have much respect for themselves.

00:25:56.433 --> 00:25:59.933
You see very highly posted people, highly
placed people

00:26:00.134 --> 00:26:04.087
doing all kinds of nonsensical things like
cheating,

00:26:04.288 --> 00:26:14.844
like having relations with people who are
of dishonorable position.

00:26:15.045 --> 00:26:18.129
All this is happening. If you see
in the newspaper, you are shocked

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:22.477
how these people at the helm of affairs
could be like this.

00:26:22.678 --> 00:26:27.568
Because they are still not matured enough
to know where are they,

00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:30.565
what is their position, how they have
to be.

00:26:30.766 --> 00:26:34.997
If you are matured enough then you will
understand that, say, I’m a housewife,

00:26:35.198 --> 00:26:40.173
I’m such a minister, I’m prime-minister,
how I should be.

00:26:40.374 --> 00:26:46.181
That all that achievement they have outside
remains outside, doesn't go inside.

00:26:46.382 --> 00:26:50.201
But for a Sahaja Yogi it should be absorbed
within.

00:26:50.402 --> 00:26:58.000
It has to be absorbed within so that
the attention is not wasted too much.

00:26:59.572 --> 00:27:05.281
The another part which one has to see is
the heart.

00:27:06.217 --> 00:27:14.617
Some people are saying, "Mother, if our
heart is ruling the head,

00:27:14.818 --> 00:27:19.892
then we become too much emotional, we get
too much attached to people,

00:27:20.093 --> 00:27:28.488
we get, you see, sort of individual
friendships and things like that."

00:27:28.689 --> 00:27:34.710
On this point, one has to know that why do
you get attached to one person?

00:27:34.911 --> 00:27:41.432
It’s not your heart. It’s not your heart.
You get attached to a person

00:27:41.633 --> 00:27:49.434
because you have some sort of a, we can
say, a relationship, maybe.

00:27:49.635 --> 00:27:53.682
Or maybe, you like the hair-dress of that
person.

00:27:53.883 --> 00:27:58.162
Maybe, you like the dress that person has.

00:27:58.363 --> 00:28:03.678
Something outside quality is attracting you
towards that person.

00:28:03.879 --> 00:28:07.613
It is not something inner quality that is
attracting.

00:28:07.814 --> 00:28:13.340
For example, if you are attached to your
children too much, you will spoil them.

00:28:13.541 --> 00:28:18.430
They will not come up to your expectations.
Anybody you get attached to,

00:28:18.631 --> 00:28:25.081
you must verify, why are you attached
to such a person, what is the reason?

00:28:25.282 --> 00:28:30.694
Now, in Sahaja Yoga people are attached
to each other very much, I know that.

00:28:30.895 --> 00:28:36.387
But it is not for any external reason.
Because somebody is rich,

00:28:36.588 --> 00:28:40.004
because somebody is famous, because
somebody is doing

00:28:40.188 --> 00:28:45.130
some sort of a extraordinary work. No.

00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:53.926
They are attached to that person because
that person is a bundle of vibrations,

00:28:54.127 --> 00:28:59.095
that it gives you tranquillity, it gives
you joy and it gives you

00:28:59.296 --> 00:29:06.865
a kind of an immense dissolution of your
being.

00:29:07.066 --> 00:29:11.150
So, that happens when you are very much
there,

00:29:11.351 --> 00:29:17.268
as I have told you the story of once this
potter

00:29:17.469 --> 00:29:26.274
was kneading the clay and his name was
Gorakumhar,

00:29:26.475 --> 00:29:29.771
and when Namadeva, who was a tailor,

00:29:29.972 --> 00:29:36.046
but very well known poet, both of them
were poets, he went and he saw

00:29:36.247 --> 00:29:43.269
this potter was doing such a, I mean, it was
not a very respectable work he was doing,

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:51.241
he was busy kneading the clay, he looked
at him and what he says that,

00:29:51.442 --> 00:30:00.273
"I have come here to see the Chaitanya,
to see the formless.

00:30:00.474 --> 00:30:07.525
But what I find that the formless has got
into a form."

00:30:07.726 --> 00:30:14.004
This only, I always say, is only possible
between the two Saints of the same level.

00:30:14.205 --> 00:30:18.557
That the way they appreciate, that the way
they feel -

00:30:18.758 --> 00:30:22.926
there are no words for what I want to say -
but the way they feel

00:30:23.127 --> 00:30:28.880
the oneness, the unity, which is a subtle
one between each other.

00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:35.754
Such a feeling if you have for each other,
then know that you are

00:30:35.955 --> 00:30:40.657
really now dissolved and you are in
the ocean of joy.

00:30:40.858 --> 00:30:46.560
But on the contrary, those who are sitting
on the shores cannot feel that way.

00:30:46.761 --> 00:30:51.602
They judge, they try to find out what’s
wrong with that person, this is not so.

00:30:51.803 --> 00:30:56.452
They can never appreciate another person.
What they feel is that they have a right

00:30:56.653 --> 00:31:02.589
to criticize, to find out faults with others
and that they are something special.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.883
And the other person also finds some faults
with this person.

00:31:06.084 --> 00:31:10.482
So it’s a fault-finding society I find
sometimes. And you get fed up with it.

00:31:10.683 --> 00:31:16.162
But when you see that the another person
who is there,

00:31:16.363 --> 00:31:25.429
the person who is another saint, you feel
such rapport, such oneness,

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:31.916
such a spontaneous feeling for that person
which is absolutely pure.

00:31:32.117 --> 00:31:38.468
There’s no expectation, there’s no mental
activity to find out

00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:46.059
what’s wrong with that person. There’s no
judgment about what he, the person is like,

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:56.359
but just oneness with that person you feel,
and you feel that your quality of your love

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:02.223
has got a new shine, a new dimension.

00:32:02.533 --> 00:32:06.960
So it comes to that, what we should
appreciate within ourselves

00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:13.691
is the purity of our love. When you are
pure, the purity is there,

00:32:13.892 --> 00:32:22.405
you do not get attached to anything, but
in that detachment, you are enjoying.

00:32:22.606 --> 00:32:28.636
In attachment you cannot enjoy because
in that

00:32:28.837 --> 00:32:37.359
you are bothered more about the superficial
relationship with the other person.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.927
Now, in a wider way, if you see Sahaja
Yoga,

00:32:41.128 --> 00:32:49.553
you are all very important people -
extremely important -

00:32:49.894 --> 00:32:56.558
because in the history of spirituality there
were not so many saints sitting together.

00:32:56.759 --> 00:33:00.851
Never can you see so many people from so
many countries

00:33:01.052 --> 00:33:06.798
thinking about Divinity and morality.

00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:13.501
It is impossible to get so many people
together, on any point whatsoever,

00:33:13.702 --> 00:33:20.149
who are feeling the oneness, the...

00:33:21.847 --> 00:33:28.125
you can say, the most soothing feeling
with each other.

00:33:28.326 --> 00:33:34.537
Whether it is comfortable or not,

00:33:34.738 --> 00:33:45.194
whether it is very much according to
the norms of comfort,

00:33:45.395 --> 00:33:53.572
people who are saints are absolutely happy
with other saints

00:33:53.773 --> 00:33:59.772
and other saintly people. They rush
to people who are saints.

00:33:59.973 --> 00:34:03.349
Once it happened to Me when I was
in Kolhapur

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:08.063
that they told Me, “There is a saint who
talks about You.” “So where is he?”

00:34:08.264 --> 00:34:12.125
They said, “He lives up there and it will
take at least three hours

00:34:12.326 --> 00:34:16.125
for You to climb up. He only lives there,
he doesn't come out.”

00:34:16.326 --> 00:34:19.004
I said, "All right, I would like to go and
see him."

00:34:19.205 --> 00:34:24.788
So, I was walking and it started raining.

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:28.004
So they said, "Mother, You never go
to anybody like that,

00:34:28.205 --> 00:34:34.531
why are You going to him?" I said, "No,
just I want to go up and see him."

00:34:34.732 --> 00:34:38.982
Now, this fellow, they said, had a control
over rain,

00:34:39.183 --> 00:34:46.474
but it was raining, raining, raining very
heavily, and when I climbed up

00:34:46.675 --> 00:34:52.132
I saw him sitting down and going on like
this with great anger.

00:34:52.333 --> 00:34:57.575
So, I said, "Let us go and sit in his cave

00:34:57.776 --> 00:35:01.424
because this fellow is now not in a normal
mood."

00:35:01.625 --> 00:35:08.763
So, I went and sat in the cave there, and
there he came. He couldn't walk

00:35:08.964 --> 00:35:15.113
because his... they say that his legs
became absolutely lame

00:35:15.314 --> 00:35:19.897
because of the vibrations that were too
much in him,

00:35:20.098 --> 00:35:25.809
whatever it is, he couldn't walk. So, they
brought him there, he sat down.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:31.733
So, the first thing he asked Me, "Why
did You not allow me to stop the rain?

00:35:31.934 --> 00:35:38.052
It was raining so heavily, and when You
were coming up,

00:35:38.253 --> 00:35:43.398
I didn’t want You to get drenched the way
now You are all full of water

00:35:43.607 --> 00:35:50.928
and I didn’t want You to suffer like this
because it’s not a good welcome to You.

00:35:51.267 --> 00:35:57.560
So, did You do it just to control my ego,
because I must have developed ego

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.471
because I can control rain, that's a fact?"

00:36:00.672 --> 00:36:04.077
So I just smiled at him. I said, "See,

00:36:04.278 --> 00:36:09.477
you are My son, isn't it? And you have
bought a sari for Me.

00:36:09.678 --> 00:36:12.672
But you are a sannyasi, so I can't take
a sari from you

00:36:12.873 --> 00:36:14.919
because sannyasi dharma is different -

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.057
I'm a Gruhastha, I can't take a sari from
you.

00:36:18.258 --> 00:36:22.585
So, I deliberately got drenched so that you
could give Me a sari."

00:36:22.786 --> 00:36:28.409
The whole temper, the whole unnatural
behavior, all dropped out.

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:32.981
He became extremely sweet. "Yes, yes,"
he said, "how do You know I bought a sari?"

00:36:33.182 --> 00:36:35.962
"At least," I said, "in love you know
everything."

00:36:36.163 --> 00:36:41.802
And then he brought a sari for Me and he
did Aarti and everything.

00:36:42.003 --> 00:36:49.283
But, you see, all these things show that
how the love masters everything so easily.

00:36:49.484 --> 00:36:57.201
Small, small things, if you are expert
in expressing your love,

00:36:57.402 --> 00:37:02.885
how it works out. There are so many
incidents I can give you like this.

00:37:03.086 --> 00:37:11.616
But the main thing we have to see within
ourselves, "Do we really love each other?

00:37:11.817 --> 00:37:19.989
Do we really have affection and compassion
for others who are not even Sahaja Yogis?"

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:25.240
Those who are not Sahaja Yogis are also
the blind people.

00:37:25.441 --> 00:37:29.688
You should have compassion for them.

00:37:29.889 --> 00:37:34.321
You should feel that these people are so
unhappy

00:37:34.522 --> 00:37:38.029
and they cannot come to Sahaja Yoga

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:43.662
and they cannot become Sahaja Yogis,
and only in their ego they are satisfied.

00:37:43.863 --> 00:37:47.307
So, you must have real compassion for them.

00:37:47.508 --> 00:37:53.291
If you have this compassion you might be
told by people that,

00:37:53.492 --> 00:37:57.923
"Why are you wasting your energy, you are
doing this, you are doing that?"

00:37:58.124 --> 00:38:03.872
The compassion is actually, unites all
these things within ourselves.

00:38:04.073 --> 00:38:08.705
That’s the uniting factor. First is your
attention,

00:38:08.906 --> 00:38:13.818
first,  which is very, very important,
I think.

00:38:14.019 --> 00:38:19.618
And the second one is your intellect, or
you can say your mind,

00:38:19.819 --> 00:38:27.263
and the third one is your heart. They all
get somehow or other united together

00:38:27.464 --> 00:38:30.929
once you have this capacity to have
compassion.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:34.215
You don't quarrel with Me or anyone, you
don't have to think about it.

00:38:34.416 --> 00:38:39.431
You just, you just feel absolutely at home
when you are compassionate

00:38:39.632 --> 00:38:44.196
and with this compassion, you are having
relations with others.

00:38:44.397 --> 00:38:50.880
Now, this compassion is not studied out
or worked out or maneuvered.

00:38:51.081 --> 00:38:56.752
It is just there. It is there. In that
compassion it forgives,

00:38:56.953 --> 00:38:59.480
it forgets all nonsensical things.

00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:06.293
The forgiveness is only possible if you
have this compassion within you.

00:39:06.494 --> 00:39:09.700
Now, even there are Sahaja Yogis who asked
me,

00:39:09.901 --> 00:39:12.920
"Mother, how can we have love and
compassion?"

00:39:13.121 --> 00:39:18.380
I mean, this is a question which many have
asked me.

00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:24.943
Now, the simple thing is that if you
develop your thoughtless awareness

00:39:25.144 --> 00:39:29.120
in your meditation, in thoughtless
awareness,

00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:33.459
you watch anything in thoughtless
awareness, any relationship you see it

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:37.581
in thoughtless awareness, then you’ll be
amazed

00:39:37.782 --> 00:39:42.254
how the gates of this compassion will
open out.

00:39:42.455 --> 00:39:46.127
Thoughtless awareness opens your heart,

00:39:46.328 --> 00:39:50.604
but it doesn't go to one person or
to another person,

00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:55.942
but it is throwing lights on all the sides
of your being.

00:39:56.143 --> 00:40:05.267
Everybody is benefited, everybody has
a divine feeling for you.

00:40:05.468 --> 00:40:14.744
Because this compassion is not linear,
nor is it aggressive, but it just flows

00:40:14.945 --> 00:40:18.389
and smoothes and soothes everything

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:24.454
that is chaotic, that is troublesome and
that is painful.

00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:27.013
This is what you have now.

00:40:27.214 --> 00:40:30.217
You know, these things were done by saints
long time back.

00:40:30.418 --> 00:40:34.070
But then nobody liked them, and they
crucified them - out of jealousy.

00:40:34.271 --> 00:40:38.941
Because if somebody became a saint, then
people felt very jealous of that person.

00:40:39.142 --> 00:40:42.999
So they killed them or tortured them and
troubled them.

00:40:43.192 --> 00:40:48.127
The situation is not so bad now. Of course,
there are some useless people.

00:40:48.328 --> 00:40:56.434
There are some people who are really
monsters, I agree. Forget about them.

00:40:56.635 --> 00:41:03.647
But on the whole, our attitude should be
that these are blind people.

00:41:03.848 --> 00:41:08.709
Now, looking at somebody who is, maybe,
something wrong with that person,

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:12.887
may not be good-natured - may be anything.
But in your heart

00:41:13.088 --> 00:41:18.901
you should not have any grudge, you should
not have any complaints about them.

00:41:19.102 --> 00:41:24.868
You can talk to that person about it. You
can tell him in a way that will be absorbed,

00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:30.583
but you should not try to make an issue
out of it

00:41:30.784 --> 00:41:33.879
and try to, in any way, trouble or torture
anyone.

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:39.582
("Can you put off this one?" Hindi: "Put
off the fan".)

00:41:46.488 --> 00:41:51.270
You have seen already, in Sahaja Yoga,
those people who came and were troublesome

00:41:51.471 --> 00:41:57.131
and were not of any worth for us, just
dropped out by themselves.

00:41:57.332 --> 00:41:59.792
We didn't have to do much about it. They
just dropped out

00:41:59.993 --> 00:42:06.563
and they have gone into some sort of
a problematic life.

00:42:06.764 --> 00:42:10.224
I, even now, receive letters from them
saying that, “We have this problem,

00:42:10.425 --> 00:42:13.589
we have that problem and how to solve
this and solve that."

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:17.562
But it’s automatically happening because,
after all,

00:42:17.763 --> 00:42:23.475
there is a big choice going on and
the Divine s trying to decide

00:42:23.676 --> 00:42:29.088
who are capable of receiving the blessings
of the Divine.

00:42:29.289 --> 00:42:31.722
This is the only thing you have to achieve.

00:42:31.923 --> 00:42:35.503
That’s why you have come to Sahaja Yoga.
Nothing else is important.

00:42:35.704 --> 00:42:41.423
There are people who are very highly
placed, tomorrow they go into dust.

00:42:41.624 --> 00:42:46.437
There are people who are regarded as very
great, famous people,

00:42:46.638 --> 00:42:52.117
they go into dust. It's all the time is
happening in your presence.

00:42:52.318 --> 00:42:57.448
Every day you read a newspaper and you
find how they are behaving.

00:42:57.649 --> 00:43:02.531
Like today, somebody told Me that in
the newspaper there was there

00:43:02.732 --> 00:43:10.400
that now one bishop is going to discotheque,
can you imagine? He is going to a disco.

00:43:10.601 --> 00:43:14.786
Now, what people must be thinking, they
must be breaking their heads,

00:43:14.987 --> 00:43:19.435
"Now what to do, this stupid fellow whom
we call as the bishop and everything,

00:43:19.636 --> 00:43:22.942
is now going to disco."

00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:28.009
What they, I mean, all whatever he had
respect,

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:32.127
maybe it is artificial, but it’s all lost,
finished.

00:43:32.328 --> 00:43:38.821
Because you see, as they are, they have
no value of themselves.

00:43:39.022 --> 00:43:43.822
They just live with their ego, "I am such
a big man. I am this, that. I am a bishop."

00:43:44.023 --> 00:43:46.767
They walk in a different way, they talk
in a different way.

00:43:46.968 --> 00:43:49.623
And suddenly how they go down.

00:43:49.824 --> 00:43:51.903
Now, what was the need for this old Johnny

00:43:52.104 --> 00:43:55.211
to go to the discotheque, I can’t
understand?

00:43:55.412 --> 00:44:01.966
So, because of this kind of life that he
is leading, thinking no end of himself,

00:44:02.167 --> 00:44:06.957
he could never see that, “One day I will
go down like that.”

00:44:07.158 --> 00:44:10.008
Another thing, which you should see
in a very wider way,

00:44:10.209 --> 00:44:15.220
that he had no feeling why people respected
him.

00:44:15.421 --> 00:44:20.349
He never knew why people had respect
for him.

00:44:20.579 --> 00:44:27.354
Or he was not conscious of it. At least
he would have preserved that. He did not.

00:44:27.555 --> 00:44:33.998
Why should he go to a place about which
he has been always denouncing

00:44:34.199 --> 00:44:39.581
and saying that these are bad places, one
should not go there?

00:44:41.093 --> 00:44:48.125
So, in your case, you have to be conscious
that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:44:48.326 --> 00:44:52.145
If you become the ocean doesn't mean that
your consciousness has vanished,

00:44:52.346 --> 00:44:57.637
but it has enlarged. You have got
the consciousness of the ocean.

00:44:57.838 --> 00:45:03.797
You are not the one who has become like
a mesmerized person

00:45:03.998 --> 00:45:09.024
or a person who has no connection with
oneself.

00:45:09.225 --> 00:45:14.583
On the contrary, you are connected with
yourself much more than you were before.

00:45:14.784 --> 00:45:18.625
So, when you become the ocean you don't
loose your personality,

00:45:18.826 --> 00:45:22.725
but you expand your personality. You become
a greater person.

00:45:22.926 --> 00:45:27.936
And this is happening in Sahaja Yoga. I am
noticing many people are developing

00:45:28.137 --> 00:45:34.101
that kind of a personality, and they are
expressing it and manifesting it.

00:45:34.302 --> 00:45:37.095
It gives me great joy to see in My lifetime

00:45:37.296 --> 00:45:42.987
I could see such people who are doing this
kind of thing.

00:45:43.368 --> 00:45:48.193
So, whenever you are doing something,
whatever is your enterprise,

00:45:48.394 --> 00:45:53.209
whatever your lifestyle, whatever it is,
that’s all outside.

00:45:53.410 --> 00:46:00.713
One should not lose your attention, which
is towards God Almighty.

00:46:00.914 --> 00:46:05.233
If that is lost, you are lost. There is
a very nice poem

00:46:05.434 --> 00:46:12.746
Namadeva has written about that there
was a boy who was flying a kite.

00:46:12.947 --> 00:46:17.354
And the kite was floating, and this boy was
looking after the kite.

00:46:17.555 --> 00:46:23.145
And while he was talking to everybody else,
but his attention was on the kite.

00:46:23.346 --> 00:46:29.714
Then it goes further. He says that a lady
is having the little child

00:46:29.915 --> 00:46:36.418
on her body, on the waist, and she is
cleaning the house.

00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:42.555
She is cleaning with a little broom. She
has to move

00:46:42.756 --> 00:46:46.433
from here to there and after that cleaning,
she has to do other work also.

00:46:46.634 --> 00:46:51.938
But the child is here. So, her attention is
on the child

00:46:52.139 --> 00:46:55.499
that he should not fall down, something
should not happen.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.682
Though she is doing all kinds of work,
everything,

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:05.006
her attention is on the child. In the same
way, your attention should be

00:47:05.207 --> 00:47:09.380
on your Divine power of Kundalini.

00:47:11.272 --> 00:47:14.947
There’s third one he’s described that there
are many ladies

00:47:15.148 --> 00:47:19.198
who are taking water from a river.

00:47:19.399 --> 00:47:22.952
Sometimes they have three pitchers on their
heads and walking.

00:47:23.153 --> 00:47:26.334
And while they are walking, they are
talking to each other,

00:47:26.535 --> 00:47:29.123
they are telling stories about each other
and anything,

00:47:29.324 --> 00:47:34.117
but their attention was on the pitchers,
which are on their head.

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:37.934
In the same way, whatever we are doing,
our attention

00:47:38.135 --> 00:47:41.863
should be on our Kundalini.

00:47:42.064 --> 00:47:47.959
We should find out what are we doing.
As it is we have the light.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:54.094
But you must take light into every corner
of your life,

00:47:54.295 --> 00:48:03.137
every aspect of your thinking, every kind
of an effort you make.

00:48:03.338 --> 00:48:07.574
And you’ll be amazed, if you really watch
your attention

00:48:07.775 --> 00:48:10.904
you will really know what you are doing.

00:48:11.105 --> 00:48:14.063
It’s the attention to be watched so much

00:48:14.264 --> 00:48:22.940
that ultimately you’ll be surprised that
the attention is no more frittering away.

00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:27.549
Without the attention you cannot work out
Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:34.282
This is the main problem of Sahaja Yoga,
is that your attention has to be

00:48:34.483 --> 00:48:39.555
towards God Almighty. Otherwise, nothing
can work out.

00:48:39.756 --> 00:48:43.089
Your ascent cannot work out. Hah, if you
have come to Sahaja Yoga

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:46.106
to make money, all right, you will make
money and get out.

00:48:46.307 --> 00:48:49.458
If you have come here to show off your
knowledge and all that,

00:48:49.659 --> 00:48:53.661
you will show it and get out. If you have
come here to show

00:48:53.862 --> 00:48:59.829
your power and your authority, you stay
there and get out.

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.644
Like that many people have gone out if you
know.

00:49:02.845 --> 00:49:09.527
And this is what is to be really taken
care of: that you don’t try

00:49:09.728 --> 00:49:13.585
to use Sahaja Yoga for all these stupid
things,

00:49:13.786 --> 00:49:21.040
which are not permanent, which are not
eternal. Sahaja Yoga is to be used just

00:49:21.241 --> 00:49:29.575
for cleansing yourself, for becoming
the ocean, the ocean of love.

00:49:29.776 --> 00:49:36.999
Now, many people also feel that love is
rather difficult,

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:44.423
because you can be harmed by others, or
somebody can take advantage of you.

00:49:44.624 --> 00:49:52.134
The main thing about love is, if it is not
a pure love, then it creates problems.

00:49:52.335 --> 00:49:55.034
Supposing you trust somebody because
of money,

00:49:55.235 --> 00:49:57.604
trust somebody because of somebody…
relationship

00:49:57.805 --> 00:50:00.485
or anything, and you go on indulging
into it,

00:50:00.686 --> 00:50:07.081
ultimately you’ll find that you will be
very disappointed. Very disappointed.

00:50:07.282 --> 00:50:15.685
But supposing you show your love, just
with purity about that person...

00:50:15.886 --> 00:50:25.785
It’s so subtle. It’s so innate within you,
built in. It’s there.

00:50:25.986 --> 00:50:33.149
We have to just open out. Every human being
is a bundle of love.

00:50:33.434 --> 00:50:36.957
And when he is afraid of others - specially
in the West,

00:50:37.158 --> 00:50:39.134
there is so many ideas they have created

00:50:39.335 --> 00:50:44.556
that you are afraid of this kind of love
and that kind of love and

00:50:44.757 --> 00:50:48.438
you see the way the perversion and
all nonsense is there.

00:50:48.639 --> 00:50:55.689
But in pure love there is a kind of
a beautiful light

00:50:55.890 --> 00:51:03.333
which protects you, which guides you and
which enlightens your life completely.

00:51:03.534 --> 00:51:14.961
This light is just nourished and also, we
can say, like the lamp has to have the oil,

00:51:15.162 --> 00:51:22.358
this is the one that is for our
spirituality: the Love of a person.

00:51:22.559 --> 00:51:27.272
You are embodiment of love, take it from
Me, because you are a human being.

00:51:27.473 --> 00:51:31.359
Even the animals are there who know what
is love is.

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:38.668
You see… I know that if you love a tiger,
the tiger will never harm.

00:51:38.869 --> 00:51:41.544
If you love a snake, it will never harm.

00:51:41.745 --> 00:51:48.020
If you try to love anybody who is very
cruel and very bad,

00:51:48.221 --> 00:51:54.180
gradually he will calm down. He will harm
you little bit, he will do this,

00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:59.041
he will see things and he might be mean
with you, do all kinds of things.

00:51:59.242 --> 00:52:03.381
But then, gradually you find your love
works, and works, and works.

00:52:03.582 --> 00:52:09.200
And ultimately it is your love, which is
important to that person.

00:52:09.519 --> 00:52:15.347
Now, your love is really firstly
appreciated

00:52:15.548 --> 00:52:21.208
more by innocent people, like children.
Children know what love is.

00:52:21.409 --> 00:52:28.502
If the children see you, and they run away,
that means something wrong with you.

00:52:28.703 --> 00:52:33.184
I’ve seen people… like once we were
in Japan

00:52:33.385 --> 00:52:37.732
and there were two foreigners who were
there, ladies, who were dressed up -

00:52:37.927 --> 00:52:40.701
I don't know from which hair-dresser they
had dressed up themselves

00:52:40.902 --> 00:52:47.514
and they were very much overly decorated -
and they came with us, you see.

00:52:47.715 --> 00:52:55.778
We climbed up a place to see something
and when we came down

00:52:55.979 --> 00:53:01.497
there were some children standing there.
They had gone before us. So they said,

00:53:01.698 --> 00:53:05.994
"Where are those witches?” I said, “Which?”
“Which went with you?"

00:53:06.195 --> 00:53:09.431
I said, "What do you mean?" "They came,
you know, we were frightened,

00:53:09.632 --> 00:53:13.673
we ran away to our houses. Now we have
come to tell you they are witches."

00:53:13.874 --> 00:53:16.469
These small, small little Japanese
children, you know,

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:19.303
"They are witches, you know, they are
witches. Be afraid of them."

00:53:19.504 --> 00:53:23.799
And they had decorated themselves so much,
so much hair-dressed up.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.758
They have tried to make such a beautiful
show of themselves,

00:53:27.959 --> 00:53:31.712
but the… for the children, they were
witches and they ran away.

00:53:31.913 --> 00:53:35.049
And when we came, they came running and
telling us, “Don't be with them,

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.791
they're witches.”

00:53:37.992 --> 00:53:42.819
So, the judgment of the innocent people
is the best judgment.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:47.282
If they are innocent, they are extremely
well equipped

00:53:47.483 --> 00:53:51.325
to judge a person - who has love and who
does not have.

00:53:51.526 --> 00:53:56.010
And they are the best people because they
will appreciate you the best.

00:53:56.211 --> 00:54:00.380
They will understand that these are people
of some high quality.

00:54:00.581 --> 00:54:07.528
But if they are not innocent, cunning,
some people are extremely cunning -

00:54:07.729 --> 00:54:11.422
that’s the intelligence part of it - they
can never appreciate you.

00:54:11.623 --> 00:54:18.892
They'll appreciate something which is,
something very, very abnormal,

00:54:19.093 --> 00:54:25.252
which from divine part, divine angle,

00:54:25.453 --> 00:54:34.617
is very, very abtuse and funny. But they
will never appreciate you.

00:54:34.818 --> 00:54:37.816
Never, cannot. Up to a point they may,
but may not.

00:54:38.017 --> 00:54:42.504
Doesn't matter. You have to appreciate
yourself.

00:54:42.705 --> 00:54:48.779
You have to know that you are not unkind
to anyone, you are not judging others,

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:55.442
and that you are appreciating everything
in that person -

00:54:55.643 --> 00:55:00.804
whatever is good in him as a human being.
It works.

00:55:01.005 --> 00:55:05.500
You have seen, this all has worked through
My love and compassion.

00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:10.806
But I’m not conscious that I’m giving you
love or compassion or anything.

00:55:11.007 --> 00:55:13.886
I’m not conscious even that I am giving you
anything.

00:55:14.087 --> 00:55:21.888
I’m not even conscious as to… I have
created such a lot of beautiful people.

00:55:22.089 --> 00:55:25.115
I am not conscious of that. It’s just
happening.

00:55:25.316 --> 00:55:28.679
Just like this tree is here, see, it is
not conscious

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:34.702
as to what it is and what it looks like.
It’s just is there.

00:55:34.903 --> 00:55:40.493
In the same way, if it happens to you,
I tell you, you become really

00:55:40.694 --> 00:55:45.975
the source of such a joy for everyone.

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:51.895
Now, what do we have to do for this world?
What is needed to be done for this world?

00:55:52.096 --> 00:55:55.680
People talk of peace, this, that. There’s
no need to do anything.

00:55:55.881 --> 00:56:00.455
It just… you become a personality of that
kind -

00:56:00.656 --> 00:56:06.452
you emit peace, you emit love, you emit joy
to others.

00:56:06.653 --> 00:56:10.571
Now, this power is within you because it is
built-in, it's within you.

00:56:10.772 --> 00:56:16.603
It is in a potential form in every person.
Only thing, it has to be brought out.

00:56:16.804 --> 00:56:29.671
Now, with affection, you may not, but with
love and feeling that is innate within you.

00:56:29.872 --> 00:56:34.631
Because there are no words for such subtle
things that are within yourself.

00:56:34.832 --> 00:56:37.935
Because so far people don’t know what are
these things

00:56:38.136 --> 00:56:42.087
that make you feel oneness with others.

00:56:42.288 --> 00:56:50.081
All this, all this can happen to you very
easily, very easily,

00:56:50.282 --> 00:56:57.169
when you understand that you are not this
mind, you are not this body,

00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:03.099
you are not this attention - you are
the Spirit.

00:57:05.277 --> 00:57:08.998
Then you introspect, "Am I the Spirit?
All right, if I am the Spirit,

00:57:09.199 --> 00:57:12.656
what is… what am I doing?"

00:57:14.684 --> 00:57:19.066
Once you become the Spirit, then you feel,
"Why not others?"

00:57:19.267 --> 00:57:23.573
Out of love and compassion. Not for
becoming some leaders or anything.

00:57:23.774 --> 00:57:27.998
Just out of love. "If I am that why not
make others like that?"

00:57:28.199 --> 00:57:31.066
And that is how Sahaja Yoga has spread
so much,

00:57:31.267 --> 00:57:35.361
and we have such gems of people, such
beautiful people

00:57:35.562 --> 00:57:41.256
that I really never expected so much
to happen in My lifetime.

00:57:41.457 --> 00:57:46.630
It has never happened with any saint, any
incarnation, any prophet.

00:57:46.831 --> 00:57:51.256
So now, you people have become absolutely

00:57:51.457 --> 00:57:56.164
‘Khalis’ means absolutely you have vacated
yourself fully.

00:57:56.365 --> 00:57:59.916
The story of Radha and Krishna is very
beautiful

00:58:00.117 --> 00:58:06.784
where Radha said that, "Why do You take
this...

00:58:12.297 --> 00:58:14.444
[Hindi: "I don’t know the English word
for Murli’"],

00:58:14.645 --> 00:58:18.189
flute... to Your throat? Why do You take
this?"

00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:22.087
Because Murli is such a sweet thing, ‘na’,
flute is not so sweet.

00:58:22.288 --> 00:58:26.557
"But why do You take this flute to Your
lips?"

00:58:26.758 --> 00:58:31.716
After all… She, She must have been jealous,
I think so.

00:58:32.402 --> 00:58:38.719
So, it's a story, just a story. So, He
said, "Why not go and ask the flute?"

00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:42.361
So, flute She went and asked, "Why
Shri Krishna

00:58:42.562 --> 00:58:46.138
takes you to His lips all the time?"

00:58:46.339 --> 00:58:50.140
So, he said, she said, "You know,

00:58:50.341 --> 00:58:55.434
I have become completely hollow. There’s
nothing in me.

00:58:55.635 --> 00:59:02.931
He puts me to His lips and people say
that I am playing the tune.

00:59:03.132 --> 00:59:08.927
It’s He who is playing the tune. Where
am I? I’m not there.

00:59:09.158 --> 00:59:14.239
I’m just enjoying the same tune, which is
passing through me.

00:59:15.607 --> 00:59:20.805
That is the expression." But then Radha
told Shri Krishna,

00:59:21.006 --> 00:59:25.023
"Why don't You make (me) the same way
as the flute?"

00:59:25.224 --> 00:59:30.594
So, this is what you have to be, the flute,
means you have to be hollow within yourself.

00:59:30.795 --> 00:59:37.686
All these little, little things, you know,
which come into your life are not important.

00:59:37.887 --> 00:59:43.637
What is important is - have you become
completely hollow?

00:59:43.858 --> 00:59:47.603
This is where, I would say, introspection
will help.

00:59:47.804 --> 00:59:52.849
The one who makes the flute is also within
you.

00:59:53.050 --> 01:00:00.401
So let there be a flute made out of you
by yourself only.

01:00:00.602 --> 01:00:07.046
This is the way you make yourself what you
have to become.

01:00:07.247 --> 01:00:12.017
In Gita Shri Krishna has said, "Atmaneva
Atmane Shrushta",

01:00:12.218 --> 01:00:15.840
means the Spirit gets satisfied by itself.

01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:19.684
Isn't it very difficult thing to
understand -

01:00:19.885 --> 01:00:23.289
how can the Spirit be satisfied by itself?

01:00:23.493 --> 01:00:26.466
But now you can understand what
Shri Krishna has said

01:00:26.667 --> 01:00:32.540
that your own Spirit becomes satisfied with
itself.

01:00:32.741 --> 01:00:35.889
Then it doesn't require any other
satisfaction.

01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:40.193
You seek the comfort of your Spirit, you
seek the joy of your Spirit,

01:00:40.394 --> 01:00:43.521
you seek the beauty of your Spirit.

01:00:43.722 --> 01:00:53.411
You don't even seek, but it is in itself
is filled with that joy of the Spirit

01:00:53.612 --> 01:00:58.894
and it only can be satisfied by itself.

01:00:59.095 --> 01:01:02.060
There are many people who say, "I am not
satisfied, you see,

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:07.380
this I am not very much satisfied, it is
not that I am satisfied."

01:01:07.804 --> 01:01:13.776
In the same way, the Spirit can say,
"I am not satisfied."

01:01:13.977 --> 01:01:19.900
But the Spirit can be satisfied with Spirit
only.

01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:25.420
It’s like the reflection in the mirror.
When you look at the mirror you see there

01:01:25.717 --> 01:01:30.814
your own reflection. Now, if the mirror is
not all right, I will say,

01:01:31.015 --> 01:01:34.740
"I am not satisfied with what reflection
we are getting out of this mirror."

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:37.539
So you’ll change the mirror, you’ll bring
the better mirror,

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:42.574
you'll try to get a better picture
of yourself. In the same way,

01:01:42.775 --> 01:01:49.455
the Spirit which is reflected within you,
wants to see its own image.

01:01:49.656 --> 01:01:55.128
And then what you do is to… you go on,
somehow or other,

01:01:55.329 --> 01:02:02.725
changing, cleaning, making it all right
through your meditation

01:02:02.956 --> 01:02:07.593
so that your Spirit is satisfied with
the Spirit.

01:02:07.834 --> 01:02:11.842
Shri Krishna wrote Gita in such a ambiguous
manner because He was very clever.

01:02:11.993 --> 01:02:14.139
He knew human beings cannot take things
straight,

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:16.320
so tell them this way, that way, that way,

01:02:16.521 --> 01:02:20.896
so that they’ll run around and then
ultimately they will come to Truth.

01:02:21.097 --> 01:02:25.994
But Truth is very simple. Truth is
extremely simple.

01:02:26.195 --> 01:02:29.756
You don't have to go here and there and
you don't have to stand on your legs

01:02:29.957 --> 01:02:35.271
or feet all the time. You don't have
to fight with anything.

01:02:35.472 --> 01:02:42.205
You don't have to take to some sort of
a ‘tapasya’, abstinence - nothing.

01:02:42.406 --> 01:02:51.127
Only just you become like a flute. You
become hollow.

01:02:51.328 --> 01:02:55.408
It’s not difficult. It’s not difficult
at all for Sahaja Yogis

01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:59.975
because already the Kundalini has made
you hollow. It’s not difficult.

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:06.891
But still, I find people deviate. Their
attention goes here and there.

01:03:07.092 --> 01:03:10.081
So many people have told Me how their
problems were solved

01:03:10.282 --> 01:03:14.137
without doing anything about it. I said,
"What did you do?"

01:03:14.338 --> 01:03:19.352
"No, Mother, we just put it at Your lotus
feet." I said, "Really?"

01:03:19.553 --> 01:03:23.983
"Yes, that's all. Or we were just looking
at the problem, what the problem is.

01:03:24.184 --> 01:03:29.129
We were standing outside and looking
at the problem and the problem got solved."

01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:32.935
Even the most difficult problems that you
think, can be solved

01:03:33.136 --> 01:03:40.752
very easily because you have powers. Your
powers are great.

01:03:40.953 --> 01:03:45.884
You are saints, but more than saints,

01:03:46.311 --> 01:03:52.447
much more than saints because you are born
at such a volatile times.

01:03:52.648 --> 01:03:58.413
Like supposing, you have a light in
darkness, you are finding something,

01:03:58.614 --> 01:04:02.377
you bump into that and you bump into that.

01:04:02.578 --> 01:04:08.425
But supposing, this is a place full of gas,

01:04:08.806 --> 01:04:16.261
you bring one light, the whole thing becomes
enlightened. Like that you have powers.

01:04:16.462 --> 01:04:25.033
But you must get out of this nonsense
of "me", "my" and "mine".

01:04:26.157 --> 01:04:30.213
I don't know how to say you get out -
It’s not like a swimming pool,

01:04:30.414 --> 01:04:33.947
that you jump into it and get out. It’s not
like that.

01:04:34.148 --> 01:04:42.580
It is another kind of a very subtle
understanding that our roots have to grow.

01:04:42.781 --> 01:04:46.338
And for growing our roots, we have to go
within ourselves

01:04:46.539 --> 01:04:54.783
and find out within ourselves what is
the area we are occupying,

01:04:54.984 --> 01:05:02.621
in what areas in our lifestyle we are
taking these roots inside.

01:05:02.822 --> 01:05:09.224
Also, Shri Krishna has said that the tree
of life has the roots in the brain

01:05:09.425 --> 01:05:12.960
and grows downward. It’s very interesting
to understand

01:05:13.161 --> 01:05:16.643
that the roots are growing in the brain.

01:05:16.844 --> 01:05:24.971
That means, your own intellect is just
covered with compassion,

01:05:25.172 --> 01:05:36.429
it’s just being absolutely one with
compassion.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.567
I had told you a story about a saint

01:05:39.768 --> 01:05:44.255
who was to take to… water for the Deity
n Gujarat

01:05:44.456 --> 01:05:51.512
and he walked one month to go there with
a pitcher of water.

01:05:51.713 --> 01:05:59.600
And then at the… because it was a very
high mountain on which this Deity was,

01:05:59.801 --> 01:06:05.320
and he reached at the foothill.

01:06:05.521 --> 01:06:10.659
There he found a little donkey dying
of thirst

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:15.339
so he poured all the water for that donkey.

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:18.109
So those who were with him, they asked,
"What are you doing?

01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:22.026
You brought it all the way, and why are
you putting it for this donkey?"

01:06:22.227 --> 01:06:23.195
He said, "You don't know?

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:27.305
The God has come all the way down, just
to meet me here.

01:06:27.506 --> 01:06:29.601
He doesn't want me to climb up."

01:06:29.802 --> 01:06:38.038
This kind of an absolutely simple
understanding

01:06:38.239 --> 01:06:46.005
of another's feelings and another's
problems:

01:06:46.206 --> 01:06:50.472
you can solve them, you can sort them out.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:53.594
And the person will tell you that, "You
sorted out my problem."

01:06:53.795 --> 01:06:59.663
But you will not know how you have solved
because this love is the power.

01:06:59.864 --> 01:07:03.545
This love can see things. It is everything.

01:07:03.746 --> 01:07:07.591
It’s like a… you see a television,
all right, it’s a television.

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:10.215
If you see a telephone, it's a telephone.

01:07:10.416 --> 01:07:18.903
If you see anything you do with the power,
it’s all is embodied inside this love.

01:07:19.104 --> 01:07:23.693
You need not have to telephone. I never
telephone to anyone.

01:07:23.894 --> 01:07:27.364
Mostly I never telephone. I mean, if
somebody forces Me then it’s all right.

01:07:27.565 --> 01:07:30.711
I never telephone. But not to save
the bill,

01:07:30.912 --> 01:07:35.272
but I do not telephone because there is
no need.

01:07:35.473 --> 01:07:39.585
The whole subtle of the ether is at your
feet.

01:07:39.786 --> 01:07:46.236
Just you want to do something you can just
do it, just with the vibrations.

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:51.454
Now, many people say, "Mother, cure this
person, cure that person." There’s no need.

01:07:51.655 --> 01:07:57.366
You all can cure, you are so many. You can
cure anyone you want to,

01:07:57.567 --> 01:08:00.882
but you bring that person to Me. It’s not
needed.

01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:03.802
Just you can cure anybody you feel like.

01:08:04.003 --> 01:08:10.211
You can solve all their problems yourself.
One little Bandhan can solve it.

01:08:10.412 --> 01:08:13.979
But for that you should be the source
of love.

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:22.808
Once you give a Bandhan, the… this powerful
love takes over,

01:08:23.009 --> 01:08:26.452
"All right, I'll do the job."

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:32.246
But for that you have to be the master
of this beautiful thing.

01:08:32.447 --> 01:08:37.304
Now, one thing is very different from other
masteries.

01:08:37.505 --> 01:08:41.060
In other masteries, you see people try
to dominate

01:08:41.261 --> 01:08:46.480
or to, try to use it for destroying others.

01:08:46.681 --> 01:08:55.495
But the mastery of love is that you know
how to build

01:08:56.465 --> 01:09:05.026
a rapport with the Divine love. And this
Divine love is not only powerful,

01:09:05.227 --> 01:09:16.490
but it is such a efficient, I should say,
such an alert instrument

01:09:16.691 --> 01:09:19.787
which works out everything in such a manner

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:24.751
that you are amazed how things have worked
out.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:28.606
And everybody has noticed it. I know you
all know it.

01:09:28.807 --> 01:09:31.304
Not that you don't know, but you don't use.

01:09:31.505 --> 01:09:36.064
You have to be on the vibratory awareness
and use that.

01:09:36.265 --> 01:09:40.179
Even giving yourself is a Bandhan itself
clarifies you.

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:47.515
Imagine in your hand there is this great
power of giving you this balance,

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:51.921
this love, this affection and all
the protection

01:09:52.122 --> 01:09:56.611
while you can give it to others also. You
have become now

01:09:56.812 --> 01:10:01.951
the part and parcel of the Divine power.
You are now in the Kingdom of God.

01:10:02.152 --> 01:10:06.829
And whatever you want to do can be done
by this divine power.

01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:12.064
With all this telling you I still feel,
sometimes, you are not confident.

01:10:12.265 --> 01:10:18.521
You get upset. You feel that, "How can
this be?"

01:10:18.722 --> 01:10:22.382
You have no trust in yourself, you have no
faith in yourself.

01:10:22.583 --> 01:10:29.749
And also there are some people, sort of,
who feel they are neglected,

01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:33.812
or something should have happened to them.

01:10:34.013 --> 01:10:39.175
Once a lady started crying. So, I said,
"Why is she crying?"

01:10:39.376 --> 01:10:44.380
She said, "Because Mother didn't smile
at me." I didn’t smile at her?

01:10:44.581 --> 01:10:50.005
But I never smiled at anyone. I don't know
why she thinks like that.

01:10:50.206 --> 01:10:56.494
So, I asked her, "Why do you want Me
to smile at you? What's wrong with you?

01:10:56.695 --> 01:10:59.782
You are all right? Why should I smile
at you?"

01:10:59.983 --> 01:11:02.784
So, you see, also this kind of a feeling

01:11:02.985 --> 01:11:06.132
that comes up sometimes that in Sahaja
Yoga,

01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:11.309
Mother should all the time be only attached
to you.

01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:16.066
She cannot get attached, you know.
It’s a helpless condition I have.

01:11:16.267 --> 01:11:20.879
There are so many, you don't know, defects
I have, which you have no idea.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.955
I don't know how to count money.

01:11:23.156 --> 01:11:26.325
If I… give Me hundred rupees I’ll count it
two hundred rupees.

01:11:26.526 --> 01:11:28.871
You see, I don't know many things. I don't
know banking;

01:11:29.072 --> 01:11:32.693
I don't know many things and one of them
is I don't know

01:11:32.894 --> 01:11:38.841
how to put attention to this person or
to that person. Like politicians would do -

01:11:39.042 --> 01:11:43.686
"You see, ah, you must look after this man,
because he is very important." Nothing.

01:11:43.887 --> 01:11:49.467
To Me you are just part and parcel of Me,
finished, nothing more than that.

01:11:49.668 --> 01:11:55.509
So, you see, everybody so should know that
you are very close to My heart,

01:11:55.710 --> 01:12:00.371
you are very much there, I am very proud
of you. And something,

01:12:00.572 --> 01:12:06.345
really it’s a miracle that has happened,
that you people have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:06.546 --> 01:12:11.444
So on that point also, that how much Mother
cares for me, what She does...

01:12:11.645 --> 01:12:14.242
Now supposing, I tell somebody, "All right,
you don't sit here, sit there,"

01:12:14.443 --> 01:12:17.924
they feel bad. Anything you do, they feel
bad.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:23.812
This kind of a person has no sense of love.
He doesn't understand Mother's love.

01:12:24.013 --> 01:12:26.792
So, at the end of the whole thing I must
tell you,

01:12:26.993 --> 01:12:31.576
that when you are a guru, you are also
a mother.

01:12:31.777 --> 01:12:37.747
You have to express yourself like a mother.
She is kind, she is gentle, she forgives.

01:12:37.948 --> 01:12:42.390
She also corrects whenever it’s necessary,
but in her own sweet way she corrects

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:47.139
so the correction takes place - it's not
that a rebellion starts.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:53.920
So all that wisdom of a mother is within
you, is already there, so please try to use.

01:12:54.105 --> 01:13:00.149
I am sure, it will all work out and as it
is we are a very beautiful group of people

01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:11.480
who are something out of the blue, who are
so much in peace and in joy together.

01:13:11.681 --> 01:13:14.948
May God bless you all.

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:27.440
So, today's Guru Puja will be...

01:13:27.641 --> 01:13:32.646
Of course, we can - we can have a little
of Ganesha's Atharva Sheersha,

01:13:32.847 --> 01:13:36.085
but Devi Puja will be much less.

01:13:36.286 --> 01:13:42.288
And for Guru Puja I would request
the country leaders to come up.

01:13:42.489 --> 01:13:47.199
Country leaders have to come up. So it is
in a different way,

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.295
we can say that the main thing is
the Guru Puja

01:13:51.496 --> 01:13:53.955
where the country leaders have to come up.

01:13:54.156 --> 01:14:00.225
The Devi Puja will be followed after that,
which is very short.

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:05.183
(Hindi: "Please, change this tea.")
