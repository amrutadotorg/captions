WEBVTT

00:00.325 --> 00:02.333
Sahaja Yoga, as we know,

00:02.375 --> 00:07.315
is the spontaneous union of the
individual consciousness with the Divine Power

00:07.340 --> 00:11.976
through the awakening of our Kundalini
which many times remains dormant in our system.

00:12.001 --> 00:13.669
Mataji, it’s a pleasure to

00:13.694 --> 00:17.142
talk to You right in Your home turf, in New Jersey,

00:17.167 --> 00:21.644
and tell us … I know last four years ago I met You.
It was a great experience,

00:21.669 --> 00:24.086
and I want to tell our viewers again

00:24.111 --> 00:27.629
what it is all that You’ve been doing,
promoting Sahaja Yoga for the last

00:27.654 --> 00:30.876
thirty years now  all over the world.

00:30.905 --> 00:36.204
Tell us again briefly for viewers who don’t know
what Sahaja Yoga really means and signifies.

00:36.229 --> 00:42.695
What does it do and how do we get that
absolute knowledge through this discipline?

00:43.227 --> 00:46.927
Saha means with. Ja means born.

00:46.952 --> 00:54.822
Is born with you the right to get this yoga,
is the union with the Divine.

00:55.162 --> 00:57.386
So this is your birthright.

00:57.411 --> 01:01.530
All human beings have this right to get

01:01.796 --> 01:05.178
the awakening of their Kundalini by which

01:05.203 --> 01:08.793
they become one with the Divine Power.

01:08.841 --> 01:11.705
This is the real yoga.

01:12.123 --> 01:21.485
And as I said, even the ancient sages and astrologers, Bhrigumuni talks about it
and You’ve written in Your book also, Meta Modern Era …

01:21.549 --> 01:23.559
They all have talked about it,

01:23.584 --> 01:28.459
but in those days they used to work on, I would say,

01:28.779 --> 01:32.927
thousands of people. Then select one of them.

01:33.296 --> 01:37.535
Then cleanse them.
And then they used to give them Realization.

01:38.444 --> 01:44.846
Now the difference of this modern Sahaja Yoga, you can call it, is this:

01:44.871 --> 01:47.712
that you first give them awakening.

01:48.025 --> 01:52.924
Let them see for themselves what’s wrong with them. All right.

01:53.150 --> 01:56.917
Once they find out, let them correct themselves.

01:56.970 --> 01:58.931
And then it’s perfect.

01:58.956 --> 02:05.776
Because if you try like this, then it will take
thousands of years to give Realization to many people.

02:05.950 --> 02:11.465
With this method you can give collectively
to thousands of people Realization.

02:11.490 --> 02:14.125
Now we have to change the world,

02:14.152 --> 02:18.147
and how can we do it on individual basis if you go?

02:18.172 --> 02:22.713
This is the best way now; thousands are getting Realization all over.

02:22.738 --> 02:28.547
And now they are telling Me it’s in eighty-six countries working out.

02:28.572 --> 02:36.269
So we are going to have a global race, you can call it, a global awakening.

02:36.473 --> 02:38.332
Which is very important.

02:38.357 --> 02:41.621
And without this awakening, we cannot get transformed.

02:41.696 --> 02:45.881
This is to transform you, to completely change you.

02:45.906 --> 02:51.314
Now as you know we have, they say there are six enemies we have within us.

02:51.643 --> 02:53.469
In Sanskrit you know them.

02:53.494 --> 03:01.300
Now all these enemies, which are lust and greed,
and things like that – jealousies, and all.

03:01.325 --> 03:08.358
All these can be completely destroyed by Kundalini awakening.

03:08.383 --> 03:12.092
You become a different person. You become the Spirit.

03:12.117 --> 03:17.563
Now in all the scriptures it is written “Know thyself.”

03:17.677 --> 03:22.187
And that should happen to you, that you should know yourself.

03:22.223 --> 03:26.788
Otherwise, all gimmicks are going on.
All kinds of gimmicks as I told you last time also.

03:26.876 --> 03:28.854
They are of no value.

03:28.999 --> 03:32.034
And they’re not going to give you any results.

03:32.059 --> 03:37.092
What you should do is to get your Self Realization.
It’s not difficult. It’s free.

03:37.326 --> 03:38.438
Why not?

03:38.463 --> 03:42.885
But Mataji, how is Your discipline,
how is Sahaj Yoga different and unique from

03:42.910 --> 03:46.244
other yoga techniques for Self Realization?

03:46.315 --> 03:50.415
Others … you see out of them Raja Yoga is called, one Raj Yog.

03:50.448 --> 03:53.950
Now Raj Yog actually happens within.

03:54.143 --> 03:56.756
What happens, when the Kundalini rises,

03:56.790 --> 04:00.292
She closes the chakras. That’s called as khumba.

04:00.317 --> 04:03.252
But you can’t do it from outside, you see?

04:03.303 --> 04:07.996
Now supposing you move one wheel of the car.
Will the car move?

04:08.171 --> 04:12.136
In the same way, your energy has to be awakened.

04:12.161 --> 04:14.180
Now there’s Hatha Yoga

04:14.205 --> 04:17.776
which was thousands of years back they were practicing the same way –

04:17.831 --> 04:19.930
first cleansing – this, that –

04:19.962 --> 04:23.052
but ultimately, they said the same thing what I do.

04:23.126 --> 04:27.685
That they said you reach a stage which
we call as thoughtless awareness

04:27.710 --> 04:30.918
and then doubtless awareness. But in Sanskrit it is

04:30.943 --> 04:33.618
thoughtless awareness they have divided in two –

04:33.643 --> 04:37.241
Savichar and Nirvichar

04:37.379 --> 04:41.597
And in this thing – Savikalpa and Nirvikalpa.

04:41.622 --> 04:46.100
They have divided.
But we say you become thoughtlessly aware to begin with.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.557
As Jung has said about it.

04:48.613 --> 04:52.916
And then beyond that is Nirvikalpa
and you have no doubts about yourself.

04:52.965 --> 04:55.283
You know yourself, you know everything,

04:55.308 --> 04:57.896
when your knowledge is perfect.

04:57.921 --> 05:03.067
But, Mataji, now You said it’s a spontaneous,
and we’ve both said, it’s a spontaneous union of our

05:03.092 --> 05:07.638
inner consciousness along with the Divine Power.
But that’s only for that brief,

05:07.663 --> 05:10.722
few seconds that you get that Kundalini awakening …

05:10.730 --> 05:11.349
Shri Mataji: No, no.

05:11.365 --> 05:12.534
But then we have to keep practicing.

05:12.550 --> 05:13.812
No, no. You have to grow.

05:13.840 --> 05:14.687
That’s what I want to ask You.

05:14.712 --> 05:16.726
You see, you have to grow  because

05:16.751 --> 05:21.097
it’s like a primule in the seed, you see, which sprouts first.

05:21.296 --> 05:23.462
Then it has to grow into the tree.

05:23.576 --> 05:26.563
And for that, hardly one month,

05:26.629 --> 05:29.836
you have to attend our programs four times or five times.

05:29.889 --> 05:31.965
You can become masters.

05:32.119 --> 05:35.565
Nothing much to be done.
Because they’ll tell you the absolute knowledge.

05:35.590 --> 05:38.631
Now supposing on the hands, I told you that time also …

05:38.639 --> 05:39.212
Interviewer: Vibrations.

05:39.237 --> 05:41.260
that you can feel the different centers.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.414
Now, how to correct them?

05:43.552 --> 05:46.623
What are they? All this knowledge has to go to you

05:46.700 --> 05:49.157
and that takes hardly any time.

05:49.827 --> 05:52.574
All right, now we have seven centers within us –

05:52.599 --> 05:54.697
the lowest center, the first one,

05:54.722 --> 05:57.769
is for our morality and innocence.

05:57.835 --> 05:58.835
Mooladhara.

05:58.988 --> 06:02.655
Then the second one and third one, and fourth, fifth, sixth.

06:02.680 --> 06:08.495
All of them are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional

06:08.527 --> 06:10.093
and spiritual being.

06:10.118 --> 06:12.254
So when the Kundalini passes through them,

06:12.294 --> 06:15.274
She integrates them together. One thing.

06:15.425 --> 06:18.571
She enlightens them.
She enriches them.

06:18.643 --> 06:22.669
And then She connects them to the All Pervading Power.

06:22.806 --> 06:24.655
So the problem is solved because

06:24.680 --> 06:30.211
all these problems are because of the chakras,
of the centers which are in problem.

06:30.236 --> 06:36.493
But a lot of people say, “Why don’t we start with the seventh chakra?
Let’s go to the top chakra and start to enlighten that chakra

06:36.518 --> 06:38.646
without going to the Kundalini.”

06:38.671 --> 06:42.215
A lot of people say bypass the Kundalini and let’s go to the …

06:42.240 --> 06:42.900
Shri Mataji: You can’t.

06:42.925 --> 06:46.416
seventh chakra and move on. Forget the other chakras.

06:46.646 --> 06:49.578
You shouldn’t, you see, decide something like that.

06:49.603 --> 06:52.589
Actually, after Realization you, yourself, will know

06:52.624 --> 06:54.808
which chakra is catching.

06:54.833 --> 06:58.684
And then you will try to completely correct it.

06:58.709 --> 07:01.084
You have to be honest with yourself, you know?

07:01.109 --> 07:03.151
Once you know that, you do that.

07:03.176 --> 07:05.779
What’s the use of just somebody says do like that?

07:05.813 --> 07:07.479
Theories after theories.

07:07.504 --> 07:10.077
That’s not going to help. What is actually there,

07:10.125 --> 07:13.939
because this is the actualization of becoming.

07:13.964 --> 07:18.555
It’s not just talking and trying all tricks, you know?

07:18.723 --> 07:23.980
Does, does sometimes the Kundalini may not rise
in all the seven chakras. It may get stuck

07:24.005 --> 07:26.208
somewhere in the middle.
That’s another … a lot of people say.

07:26.233 --> 07:28.287
Some do. Agreed. Some do get.

07:28.327 --> 07:30.179
But you can clear it out. It’s not difficult.

07:30.203 --> 07:31.157
Is it easy to clear it out?

07:31.181 --> 07:33.482
You see others are there to help.

07:33.538 --> 07:39.116
Those who are now all right then
they can remove that obstruction.
Take it away.

07:39.679 --> 07:49.606
I see. And I believe, Mataji, recently only at the
National Institute of Medicine in Washington D.C.

07:49.631 --> 07:52.474
they demonstrated the technique of Sahaja Yoga.

07:52.568 --> 07:56.935
Oh, they were very much impressed and forty doctors came forward.

07:57.031 --> 08:00.136
But then they wanted to test a girl …

08:00.474 --> 08:04.737
how far … because I say that on these things you can

08:04.769 --> 08:07.843
make out your chakras.

08:07.946 --> 08:12.291
So they asked a girl, one doctor asked,
“What’s wrong with me?” (S)he said, “Heart.”

08:12.605 --> 08:15.630
And he had a bypass surgery two months back.

08:15.655 --> 08:20.554
They were all amazed. I said,
“Don’t have to do all the rigamarole of the diagnosis,

08:20.587 --> 08:22.476
just on your fingertips you can say.”
