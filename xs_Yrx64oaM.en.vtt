00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:15.460
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:20.657 --> 00:00:29.632
You have to know that truth is what it is.

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:35.071
We cannot conceptualize it with our human
awareness.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:43.824
We cannot order it, we cannot manipulate it,
we cannot organize it.

00:00:43.824 --> 00:00:48.506
It is what it is, has been and will be.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:51.404
And what is the truth?

00:00:51.404 --> 00:01:05.003
Truth is that we are surrounded or we are
penetrated or we are nourished, looked after

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:19.104
and loved by a very subtle energy which is
the energy of divine love.

00:01:19.104 --> 00:01:32.474
The second truth is that we are not this body,
this mind, these conditionings, this ego,

00:01:32.474 --> 00:01:38.854
but we are the spirit.

00:01:38.854 --> 00:01:47.484
You don’t have to accept what I’m saying
blindly, because blind faith leads to fanaticism.

00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:57.143
But as scientists you must keep your minds
open and see for yourself what I’m saying:

00:01:57.143 --> 00:02:09.244
if it is so, honestly you must accept it.

00:02:09.244 --> 00:02:24.652
We know so much through science about our
civilization, our advancement.

00:02:24.652 --> 00:02:33.024
This is the advancement of a tree which has
grown outside very much; but if we do not

00:02:33.024 --> 00:02:41.124
know our roots, we’ll be destroyed.

00:02:41.124 --> 00:02:46.574
So it is important to know about our roots.

00:02:46.574 --> 00:02:53.404
And this is what it is that I would say are
our roots.

00:02:53.404 --> 00:03:17.014
As you can see, there are seven centers within
us, and these subtle centers are placed in

00:03:17.014 --> 00:03:24.183
the spinal cord and the brain.

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:30.683
These cater to our physical, mental, emotional
and spiritual needs.

00:03:30.683 --> 00:03:41.414
On the physical side they manifest the energy
for the use of our plexuses which look after

00:03:41.414 --> 00:03:43.773
our physical problems.

00:03:43.773 --> 00:03:57.433
That is on the right side, the energy which
is supplied by this yellow line, a subtle

00:03:57.433 --> 00:04:07.844
channel – we call it as the Pingala Nadi
– this supplies energy for our physical

00:04:07.844 --> 00:04:11.574
and mental actions.

00:04:11.574 --> 00:04:20.904
So this is the power of action within us which
also caters to the right sympathetic nervous

00:04:20.904 --> 00:04:23.844
system.

00:04:23.844 --> 00:04:32.954
The another channel you see on the left-hand
side is the channel by which we desire, put

00:04:32.954 --> 00:04:35.574
our energy to our desire.

00:04:35.574 --> 00:04:42.664
So this is the power of desire and looks after
our emotions.

00:04:42.664 --> 00:04:49.544
This is the one which looks after our conditionings
also.

00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:59.754
At the end of these two channels they create
two institutions: one on the right side crosses

00:04:59.754 --> 00:05:07.374
over, and the yellow balloon that you see
is the ego, is the balloon of ego that we

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:16.534
have; and the left-hand side one that, which
conditions our mind is the balloon of superego.

00:05:16.534 --> 00:05:25.504
As we start growing, in age by the time we
are twelve years of age, these two completely

00:05:25.504 --> 00:05:36.944
meet and the soft bone in our head becomes
completely calcified.

00:05:36.944 --> 00:05:51.004
Now there’s third energy within us which
is in the center, and this central energy

00:05:51.004 --> 00:05:55.523
is the one which has made us human beings.

00:05:55.523 --> 00:06:02.714
And these centers are the milestones of our
evolution.

00:06:02.714 --> 00:06:10.274
So now the last jumping is left out.

00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:15.414
It has reached up to the limbic area.

00:06:15.414 --> 00:06:35.244
Now, only thing, it has to break through the
soft bone in the, on the head and break through

00:06:35.244 --> 00:06:41.654
that, which is the actualization of baptism.

00:06:41.654 --> 00:06:49.904
Baptism is not an artificial thing – it
is an actualization.

00:06:49.904 --> 00:07:03.754
But the energy that does it is, we call it
sleeping energy, in the triangular bone called

00:07:03.754 --> 00:07:05.314
as sacrum.

00:07:05.314 --> 00:07:14.054
That means the Greeks knew that this is a
sacred bone, that they called it “sacrum.”

00:07:14.054 --> 00:07:24.044
This energy has to rise and break through
that fontanel bone area and connect us to

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:34.304
that subtle divine Power which we have never
felt during human awareness.

00:07:34.304 --> 00:07:47.654
Thus we get connected to this divine Power,
and we start feeling it on our fingertips.

00:07:47.654 --> 00:07:56.174
It’s described in the Koran that “at the
time of resurrection your hands will speak,

00:07:56.174 --> 00:07:59.974
and they will give witness against you.”

00:07:59.974 --> 00:08:05.164
That is, you start feeling your own centers
– these are five, six and seven centers

00:08:05.164 --> 00:08:14.314
– and they indicate what’s wrong with
you within yourself, what’s the problem.

00:08:14.314 --> 00:08:24.633
Also you can feel the cool breeze coming out
of your head, cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:08:24.633 --> 00:08:35.224
Because this sleeping power which is called
as the kundalini – “kundala” means “coils”

00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:41.674
– is the power of pure desire within us.

00:08:41.674 --> 00:08:50.924
[Disturbance by a man in the audience]

00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:54.894
What’s he talking?

00:08:54.894 --> 00:09:06.284
Ah …. This is the result, you know, of tensions,
on modern tensions.

00:09:06.284 --> 00:09:09.883
So many such things are happening.

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:10.904
People have no peace.

00:09:10.904 --> 00:09:21.904
That’s what I say, the tree has outgrown
itself: it must find its roots.

00:09:21.904 --> 00:09:29.114
In America they say there are fifty-five per
cent people who suffer from terrible nervousness,

00:09:29.114 --> 00:09:34.654
and at least thirty per cent people have got
schizophrenia.

00:09:34.654 --> 00:09:41.265
It’s a very dangerous thing.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:49.003
If we don’t understand how delicately we
are made and to realize that we are human

00:09:49.003 --> 00:09:57.683
beings, the epitome of evolution, we are going
to land in great difficulties.

00:09:57.683 --> 00:10:05.964
We may try to run away from reality, but reality
will have an effect on us.

00:10:05.964 --> 00:10:15.554
Now, so now we have this kind of a mechanism
within us existing.

00:10:15.554 --> 00:10:24.073
Now this is a living process of evolution,
and you must understand that we don’t pay

00:10:24.073 --> 00:10:33.224
for living process, and we can’t even explain
it; because when you take a small little seed

00:10:33.224 --> 00:10:39.753
and put it in the Mother Earth, it germinates
by itself spontaneously.

00:10:39.753 --> 00:10:45.114
You don’t pay to the Mother Earth anything.

00:10:45.114 --> 00:10:53.743
And when it germinates, it grows into a tree
and produces thousands of seeds.

00:10:53.743 --> 00:11:02.354
So in that little seed the map of all the
things it was going to create is there.

00:11:02.354 --> 00:11:06.323
How it works, we never ask this question.

00:11:06.323 --> 00:11:08.794
We take all the things for granted.

00:11:08.794 --> 00:11:16.464
We don’t even ask the question how this
wonderful eye of ours is made like a camera,

00:11:16.464 --> 00:11:22.384
and that how we are programmed within ourselves
like computers.

00:11:22.384 --> 00:11:28.684
You see this is the color; you don’t have
to think about – it’s there.

00:11:28.684 --> 00:11:41.623
Through our sensory organs, how we find out
things: we’d never question it.

00:11:41.623 --> 00:11:51.134
But to answer now all our questions, we have
to become the divine computer.

00:11:51.134 --> 00:11:56.974
And that’s why we have to be connected to
the mains, I call them, as the people who

00:11:56.974 --> 00:12:09.404
are self-realized, the people who have got
their spirit in their attention.

00:12:09.404 --> 00:12:19.264
When the attention is enlightened through
this happening, then you can see the absolute

00:12:19.264 --> 00:12:20.514
truth.

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:27.914
Like supposing you are holding on to a snake
and there’s darkness, and somebody tells,

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:34.684
there is darkness, “But you have got a snake
in your hand.

00:12:34.684 --> 00:12:36.073
I can see it.”

00:12:36.073 --> 00:12:40.303
He’ll say, “No, I think it is a rope.”

00:12:40.303 --> 00:12:47.834
Now if you put on the light, immediately that
person will drop.

00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:55.433
In the same way, when the attention gets enlightened
by the spirit, the first nature, innate nature

00:12:55.433 --> 00:13:02.433
of the spirit is that it manifests absolute
truth.

00:13:02.433 --> 00:13:08.904
You immediately become so empowered that you
give up all those habits which are destructive

00:13:08.904 --> 00:13:11.264
to your life – immediately.

00:13:11.264 --> 00:13:18.764
I have seen people giving up drugs overnight
in London, alcoholism, all kinds of things.

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:24.534
I was amazed the way it’s working.

00:13:24.534 --> 00:13:32.964
It’s your own power within you; it just
there, is existing.

00:13:32.964 --> 00:13:41.164
There’s no obligation of any kind, it’s
just one enlightened candle can enlighten

00:13:41.164 --> 00:13:42.584
another candle.

00:13:42.584 --> 00:13:45.524
That’s how it works.

00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:52.294
And it has to work – otherwise, as I told
you, we are standing on the brink of destruction.

00:13:52.294 --> 00:14:00.914
Leave alone things like drugs and things we
take to escape reality, there are so many

00:14:00.914 --> 00:14:11.704
diseases that have come up and coming up that
it is going to be very difficult for us to

00:14:11.704 --> 00:14:22.334
exist on this Mother Earth after some time:
ecological problems, the uncertainty of life,

00:14:22.334 --> 00:14:27.544
the insecurities that are built within us.

00:14:27.544 --> 00:14:31.964
So many conditionings we have.

00:14:31.964 --> 00:14:34.284
How to get rid of them?

00:14:34.284 --> 00:14:38.573
How to be cleansed is a very big problem today.

00:14:38.573 --> 00:14:46.604
And for that I think it is important that
we have to get our Self-realization.

00:14:46.604 --> 00:14:56.823
We talk, “my, my body, my hand, my mind,
my ego” – but which is this “my”?

00:14:56.823 --> 00:14:59.594
Which is the “I” behind it?

00:14:59.594 --> 00:15:04.714
And when doctors also talk about the autonomous
nervous system, they don’t say what is this

00:15:04.714 --> 00:15:06.194
auto, who is this auto.

00:15:06.194 --> 00:15:10.944
We say “automobile” – so there is a
driver sitting driving the car.

00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:14.314
But who is driving this car?

00:15:14.314 --> 00:15:18.354
That is what we have to find out.

00:15:18.354 --> 00:15:22.314
And that auto is the spirit within us.

00:15:22.314 --> 00:15:32.544
Unless and until the connection with the Divine
is established, all other efforts are really

00:15:32.544 --> 00:15:33.574
fruitless.

00:15:33.574 --> 00:15:38.674
And that’s why many people ask Me why all
the religions are fighting among themselves,

00:15:38.674 --> 00:15:46.294
why people who believe in God are fighting
among themselves; why they are so sinful,

00:15:46.294 --> 00:15:47.674
why aren’t they so good.

00:15:47.674 --> 00:15:53.544
The reason is, they have not found the truth
as yet.

00:15:53.544 --> 00:15:59.774
Just believing in any God or being born in
any religion doesn’t make you a righteous

00:15:59.774 --> 00:16:05.284
person at all: anybody following any religion
can commit any sin.

00:16:05.284 --> 00:16:06.973
There’s no bondage.

00:16:06.973 --> 00:16:12.764
But when this kundalini rises into that green
part, as you see – we call it as a Void:

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.804
is the area which is like a bridging.

00:16:15.804 --> 00:16:23.864
Very significant it is, like Moses bridged;
in the same way, this is the bridging.

00:16:23.864 --> 00:16:29.374
And this bridging, when it takes place you
can cross over this ocean of illusion, as

00:16:29.374 --> 00:16:30.784
we say.

00:16:30.784 --> 00:16:38.194
But actually this ocean of illusion is representing
our ten valencies within us.

00:16:38.194 --> 00:16:49.444
We have ten valencies, ten dharmas, ten – our
innate nature as human beings.

00:16:49.444 --> 00:16:55.184
So when kundalini rises into this area, it
enlightens this area, and a person who is

00:16:55.184 --> 00:16:58.184
a realized soul doesn’t do anything wrong.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:03.453
He doesn’t cheat, he doesn’t bribes, he’s
not frightened.

00:17:03.453 --> 00:17:12.424
He’s so courageous, he’s so compassionate,
he’s so dynamic, he’s so loving.

00:17:12.424 --> 00:17:18.804
This is only possible when you are innately
religious.

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:24.304
Unless and until that happens, the religion
outside, the man-made religion, cannot give

00:17:24.304 --> 00:17:27.144
you what it is promising you.

00:17:27.144 --> 00:17:31.353
And that’s why people are surprised that
there is a big difference between the practice

00:17:31.353 --> 00:17:33.894
and precepts of religion.

00:17:33.894 --> 00:17:40.284
Every religion has said that “you seek your
Self.”

00:17:40.284 --> 00:17:45.874
So there was nothing wrong with all the prophets,
incarnations, all the saints.

00:17:45.874 --> 00:17:49.764
They all said the same thing.

00:17:49.764 --> 00:17:53.654
But we have missed the point.

00:17:53.654 --> 00:18:03.294
Everything has become either money-oriented
or is an intellectual, intellectual probing.

00:18:03.294 --> 00:18:08.824
It is through intellectual probing you reach
a point where you realize that you have not

00:18:08.824 --> 00:18:10.114
reached the reality.

00:18:10.114 --> 00:18:16.384
So what should we do?

00:18:16.384 --> 00:18:21.604
And this is a very great gift of modern times
which was promised long time back.

00:18:21.604 --> 00:18:30.583
Is described already in our Puranas that at
the time, these modern times called as Kali

00:18:30.583 --> 00:18:38.603
Yuga, the Paramachaitanya or this all-pervading
Power will become active – means there is

00:18:38.603 --> 00:18:48.004
Krita Yuga, it will become active – and
through it thousands of people will get their

00:18:48.004 --> 00:18:50.184
realization.

00:18:50.184 --> 00:18:54.274
Even in the Bible they have said that it’s
quite a limited number.

00:18:54.274 --> 00:19:01.784
John the – John has written in his “Revelation”
it’s quite a limited number, but we have

00:19:01.784 --> 00:19:05.463
already crossed that.

00:19:05.463 --> 00:19:08.924
And so many people have to become realized
souls.

00:19:08.924 --> 00:19:15.894
It’s very important today, and it’s so
easy – Sahaja.

00:19:15.894 --> 00:19:18.524
“Saha” is “with”, “ja” is “born.”

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:25.914
Born with you is the right to become one with
the Divine, united with the Divine – that

00:19:25.914 --> 00:19:27.504
is yoga.

00:19:27.504 --> 00:19:32.524
“Yoga” is nothing but to be united with
that divine Power.

00:19:32.524 --> 00:19:40.894
That’s what yoga is; all other things are
subsidiary.

00:19:40.894 --> 00:19:51.294
This union brings forth new dimensions on
our central nervous system.

00:19:51.294 --> 00:19:56.694
As a evolution, we always develop a new dimension.

00:19:56.694 --> 00:20:08.064
By this you develop a new awareness of collective
consciousness, by which you can feel other

00:20:08.064 --> 00:20:11.103
people, their centers.

00:20:11.103 --> 00:20:16.794
Sitting down here you can feel the center
of somebody – somebody who is dead, even

00:20:16.794 --> 00:20:21.644
you can feel his centers and find out what
he was: was he a realized soul or not?

00:20:21.644 --> 00:20:26.784
You can find out about anybody whether he
was a realized soul or not, sitting down here.

00:20:26.784 --> 00:20:28.744
You have to just think about him, put your
hands.

00:20:28.744 --> 00:20:35.603
If you are a realized soul you can feel on
your fingertips what is the problem.

00:20:35.603 --> 00:20:41.754
And somehow if you know how to correct those
problems, you get rid of your own diseases

00:20:41.754 --> 00:20:49.794
and the diseases of others, your own problems
and the problems of others.

00:20:49.794 --> 00:20:57.544
First you enter into a state of mind which
we call as “thoughtless awareness.”

00:20:57.544 --> 00:21:05.564
When you cross this center of Agnya that is
placed in the optic chiasma, you become thoughtlessly

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:06.564
aware.

00:21:06.564 --> 00:21:09.764
You are aware, but there is no thought.

00:21:09.764 --> 00:21:13.504
What a blessing it is!

00:21:13.504 --> 00:21:20.103
Say, I see a carpet here, it’s beautiful,
and when I look at it if I start thinking

00:21:20.103 --> 00:21:21.103
“what a good carpet!”

00:21:21.103 --> 00:21:25.204
If it is Mine it’s a very big headache because
I’ll be thinking, “I hope it goes home,

00:21:25.204 --> 00:21:32.524
is already insured, is not lost, is not spoilt”
– all kinds of worries about this carpet.

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:38.103
Thank God it’s not Mine, so I’ll look
at it, still I start thinking how much I should

00:21:38.103 --> 00:21:43.103
pay to get it, from where can I get it; all
these thoughts coming.

00:21:43.103 --> 00:21:52.514
But if I look at it without any thoughts,
then the joy of its creation, to whomsoever

00:21:52.514 --> 00:22:05.744
it may belong, so-called, starts pouring on
Me like beautiful flow of joy.

00:22:05.744 --> 00:22:17.254
Whatever the artist has put into it, all his
joy starts pouring, that peace and that joyous

00:22:17.254 --> 00:22:22.164
feeling within Me when I don’t think about
it.

00:22:22.164 --> 00:22:27.534
Thinking makes a person mad, creates lots
of problems.

00:22:27.534 --> 00:22:30.353
Too much thinking is wasteful, also.

00:22:30.353 --> 00:22:38.103
As I’ll tell you about the second center
we have here, tomorrow, about the second center,

00:22:38.103 --> 00:22:42.484
that by thinking, how many diseases you get.

00:22:42.484 --> 00:22:53.823
The other day I was in a radio station and
the gentleman was asking Me, “How can I

00:22:53.823 --> 00:22:55.223
get rid of my diabetes?

00:22:55.223 --> 00:22:57.144
You say that by thinking it happens.”

00:22:57.144 --> 00:23:00.603
I said, “Yes.”

00:23:00.603 --> 00:23:08.004
Because in India if they have to take tea
in a village, the sugar is put so much that

00:23:08.004 --> 00:23:12.484
the spoon must stand at right angle!

00:23:12.484 --> 00:23:15.103
And nobody gets diabetes.

00:23:15.103 --> 00:23:25.494
But people who are sedentary, planning too
much – I mean mostly, say, bureaucrats,

00:23:25.494 --> 00:23:31.843
diplomats, politicians – they are very vulnerable.

00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:36.484
What is the reason for that, which I’ll
explain to you tomorrow, how we get all these

00:23:36.484 --> 00:23:45.454
diseases because we think too much and we
cannot stop thinking.

00:23:45.454 --> 00:23:53.634
But so far, we have to understand that we
are all on the, either on the right side or

00:23:53.634 --> 00:23:56.584
on the left side.

00:23:56.584 --> 00:24:00.474
We are not in the center.

00:24:00.474 --> 00:24:07.384
The centers are like this, I would say: the
left and the right, and the left side and

00:24:07.384 --> 00:24:10.884
the right side join together to make the center.

00:24:10.884 --> 00:24:15.323
Now supposing you are right-sided – means
you are using too much of your physical or

00:24:15.323 --> 00:24:24.244
mental aptitudes, you are planning for future,
you are very futuristic – then this starts

00:24:24.244 --> 00:24:31.073
extracting energy from this center and starts
moving to the left, right, starts moving to

00:24:31.073 --> 00:24:33.234
the right.

00:24:33.234 --> 00:24:42.814
At the same time if something happens on the
left side and you get a jerk, it is broken.

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:48.934
Then you are vulnerable to diseases which
we call as psychosomatic, because this is

00:24:48.934 --> 00:24:53.414
the one is the somatic and this is the psycho.

00:24:53.414 --> 00:25:00.943
And these diseases cannot be cured.

00:25:00.943 --> 00:25:07.713
Because if somebody’s a doctor then he doesn’t
know about psychology; somebody is psychologist,

00:25:07.713 --> 00:25:09.034
he doesn’t know the medicine.

00:25:09.034 --> 00:25:12.864
I mean, we have doctors for one eye and another
doctor for another eye!

00:25:12.864 --> 00:25:16.174
We have gone to that limit of specialization.

00:25:16.174 --> 00:25:24.103
This is the science of integration.

00:25:24.103 --> 00:25:31.134
Is not a science of specialization but integration,
because this is one body which has got the

00:25:31.134 --> 00:25:35.944
nose, eyes, ears all stuck to one body.

00:25:35.944 --> 00:25:42.364
And this is one personality, and we have to
deal with this personality as a whole.

00:25:42.364 --> 00:25:47.544
But if you start treating it like one for
the nose, one for the ears, it’s not going

00:25:47.544 --> 00:25:49.843
to work out.

00:25:49.843 --> 00:25:57.424
So when this kundalini rises through these
centers it brings them back to normal, to

00:25:57.424 --> 00:26:07.144
the balance, integrates them one with another
and connects them with the mains from where

00:26:07.144 --> 00:26:11.304
the energy flows inside.

00:26:11.304 --> 00:26:18.294
And that’s how you become very dynamic,
you don’t get tired, you feel very young,

00:26:18.294 --> 00:26:30.073
you never feel your age; and you are extremely
compassionate and kind, and you love to do

00:26:30.073 --> 00:26:32.573
good to others.

00:26:32.573 --> 00:26:38.304
It is so much I have to tell you.

00:26:38.304 --> 00:26:43.614
Now Sahaja Yoga is working in forty nations,
and working out very well.

00:26:43.614 --> 00:26:46.584
The most surprising place was USSR.

00:26:46.584 --> 00:26:51.154
And now the people are saying, “Mother,
You have been working for twenty years in

00:26:51.154 --> 00:26:57.394
the West and only went last year to USSR,
and You have more Sahaja yogis there than

00:26:57.394 --> 00:26:59.924
You have all over the world.”

00:26:59.924 --> 00:27:03.674
Not in India: we have many more, of course,
because they know about it, they were not

00:27:03.674 --> 00:27:06.374
ignorant, so it’s all right – if you forget
India.

00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:15.384
I don’t know what’s so special about them
that they could see this so clearly.

00:27:15.384 --> 00:27:20.504
And one of the snags of Sahaja Yoga is that
you cannot pay for it.

00:27:20.504 --> 00:27:28.404
And this really is the very great snag, I
think, because a gentleman from BBC in England

00:27:28.404 --> 00:27:36.444
told Me that Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand
anything that can be done without money.

00:27:36.444 --> 00:27:39.984
I said, “Who has made this brain, God or
somebody else?”

00:27:39.984 --> 00:27:43.943
It’s very surprising!

00:27:43.943 --> 00:27:50.583
And even in, I went to Toronto – no, Boston
– and they said, “How many Rolls-Royces

00:27:50.583 --> 00:27:51.583
You’ve got?”

00:27:51.583 --> 00:27:55.514
I said, “I have none, because I don’t
take any money.

00:27:55.514 --> 00:27:57.654
Whatever I have is of My husband’s.”

00:27:57.654 --> 00:28:01.184
They said, “Then we are not interested.

00:28:01.184 --> 00:28:03.004
You have to be in the business.”

00:28:03.004 --> 00:28:09.333
It’s very shocking, this kind of a attitude
towards Divine.

00:28:09.333 --> 00:28:18.353
I said, “How much money did you pay to Christ?”

00:28:18.353 --> 00:28:24.944
Today also there was a question from a radio,
and they asked Me, “You don’t take any

00:28:24.944 --> 00:28:27.434
money; then how do You travel?”

00:28:27.434 --> 00:28:34.353
I said, “So far, for quite some time I was
travelling with My husband’s money, no doubt.

00:28:34.353 --> 00:28:39.813
But now we have so many Sahaja yogis and they
have some self-respect, and they don’t pay

00:28:39.813 --> 00:28:43.944
Me, they pay to the travel agents, not to
Me.

00:28:43.944 --> 00:28:49.843
They don’t want I to pay for them – then
tomorrow will say ‘all right, You pay for

00:28:49.843 --> 00:28:51.534
our food also!’”

00:28:51.534 --> 00:28:57.024
I mean, any self-respecting people can understand
that.

00:28:57.024 --> 00:29:03.514
So if somebody does not take money, they go
to that limit that even I should pay for their

00:29:03.514 --> 00:29:13.174
salvation, coming to their place I should
pay for the hall, I should pay for everything.

00:29:13.174 --> 00:29:21.043
This kind of a brain – oh, it’s not all,
all of you are not Anglo-Saxon, I hope so!

00:29:21.043 --> 00:29:25.603
– I can’t understand.

00:29:25.603 --> 00:29:28.274
And that’s why it has not come up to the
point where it should have.

00:29:28.274 --> 00:29:40.544
On the contrary, I must say Russians are very
brave people.

00:29:40.544 --> 00:29:46.087
With the war they have become very strong.

00:29:46.165 --> 00:29:52.343
On the contrary, in other countries I have
seen with the war they have become very nervous,

00:29:52.343 --> 00:29:54.744
very frightened.

00:29:54.744 --> 00:29:59.884
And immediately they took to Sahaja Yoga for
one point, that you cannot pay for it.

00:29:59.884 --> 00:30:06.634
They could see it, that you can’t pay because
it’s a living process.

00:30:06.634 --> 00:30:09.854
Is such a wisdom that clicked.

00:30:09.854 --> 00:30:21.703
You won’t believe, in England I was fighting
with seven hippies for four years: the questions,

00:30:21.703 --> 00:30:24.904
the bombardment and – too much!

00:30:24.904 --> 00:30:29.484
I was about to give up.

00:30:29.484 --> 00:30:35.874
They just thought that it’s something to
be attacked.

00:30:35.874 --> 00:30:40.000
And that’s the reason they attacked all
the saints, all the incarnations and all the

00:30:40.025 --> 00:30:41.995
prophets.

00:30:45.992 --> 00:30:51.211
But I hope now everybody realizes that we
are in trouble.

00:30:51.211 --> 00:30:54.101
We are all in trouble.

00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:56.642
We don’t know what’s going to happen next
day.

00:30:56.642 --> 00:31:02.971
We might get into cancer, might get into some
other trouble.

00:31:02.971 --> 00:31:06.701
We might have any problem that we do not know
about.

00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:10.282
We are not sure of our future.

00:31:10.282 --> 00:31:16.532
So it is better that we get our special energy
that is within us, we get ourselves enlightened

00:31:16.532 --> 00:31:30.342
and take to something that will make us much
wiser, healthier, joyous and knowledgeable.

00:31:30.342 --> 00:31:34.772
“Knowledge” does not mean what you know
through your brains, but on your central nervous

00:31:34.772 --> 00:31:36.292
system.

00:31:36.292 --> 00:31:47.072
That’s what everybody said, that the time
has come – it’s a blossom time, I call

00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:48.072
it.

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:52.311
There are thousands and thousands who can
get realization.

00:31:52.311 --> 00:31:58.772
It’s such a great blessing that we could
have en masse realization.

00:31:58.772 --> 00:32:03.542
On the Tree of Life there would have been
only one or two flowers to begin with, but

00:32:03.542 --> 00:32:07.691
today I call it a blossom time.

00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:18.922
Is actually the Day of Judgment, but “blossom
time” seems better to say – is more promising.

00:32:18.922 --> 00:32:24.970
I hope tonight we all will get realization
and enjoy ourselves.

00:32:25.174 --> 00:32:35.723
May God bless you all.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:44.440
I would like you to ask Me some questions,
because today is a first day. I’m sorry,

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:48.970
the mike was not all right so they started
very late, they said. The musicians have come

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:55.970
from India – and you’d be amazed that
Australians, Swiss, Germans, English, all

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:07.100
of them have learned Sanskrit songs and Marathi
songs, which is such a difficult language,

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:16.330
all these songs – and they have learnt English
songs. It was impossible to teach an Englishman

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:25.050
one sentence in Hindi. One gentleman asked
Me, “What do you say to the 'close the door'?”

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:36.390
So My father told him, “You just say 'there
was a banker.' That means ‘you close the

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:43.610
door’! And for opening the door you say
'there was a cold day.' That’s how you will

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:51.100
say 'open the door'!” So it was so difficult,
and I’m amazed how through Sahaja Yoga they

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.500
have become so dynamic.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:34:00.340
We have got many artists now flowering out.
In your country itself there are so many artists

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:07.340
who have come out of Sahaja Yoga. They are
very well known here. Also great potters and

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:15.590
ceramic makers have come out of this. It’s
working on this part, on this area of creativity,

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:26.160
and lots of musicians have become great musicians
in India. It’s working out in another direction

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:33.970
in England, that people are writing books
and they have become good orators who would

00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:40.970
never come on the stage. So this is on a worldly
level, we should say, but they themselves

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:48.310
are so patient and so loving that the happiest
thing I would like to tell you is that twenty-five

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:55.370
Germans rushed to USSR, to Russia, to help
Me to give realization to Russians. It was

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:06.760
very touching, really, to see Germans should
feel that innately that it’s their duty

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:14.220
to give them realization. They spent their
own money coming down there. It’s rather

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:19.300
difficult to go to Russia because you have
to pay for the hotels beforehand and all that.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:26.140
They did all that and they were there. It’s
a beautiful that’s happening in the world,

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:33.060
very beautiful people. And the way they admire
each other and adore, it’s wonderful.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:39.590
So I would expect you to ask Me some questions.
But the questions should be relevant because

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:45.120
I’m not here to aggress you, I’m here
just to give you what you have, your own property.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:50.730
So there’s no need to be aggressive with
Me or to be angry with Me. I’ve not come

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:57.710
here to take anything from you. So in a sensible
way, whatever you want to ask please ask,

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:04.510
and we should not waste also time of other
people who are anxious to have their realization.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:10.620
[Question: Is Mr. Gorbachev realized?]

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:17.620
Yes, he is very much. Thank God for that!

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:28.620
[Question: What about Mr. Bush then?]

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:30.170
Who?

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.610
[Mr. Bush.]

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:35.280
You can give him realization. You can.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:41.100
[Question: What for?]

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:48.100
It’s better not to ask about that. You see,
even Americans don’t understand sometimes

00:36:54.210 --> 00:37:01.210
that if Gorbachev has opted for democracy
he’s not opted for an American style of

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:07.050
democracy, because American democracy has
not created very good atmosphere. It’s a,

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:13.370
if you go to America you can’t even wear
a wedding ring. They can kill you even for

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:17.500
a wedding ring. Such a situation is there.
Horrible!

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:23.820
And I was going once on a Los Angeles road
and the one who was driving Me told Me that

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.770
“Mother, put down Your head.”

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:25.300
I said, “Why?”

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.830
And he said, “On this road last week eleven
people were killed.”

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:29.930
I said, “Why?”

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:31.190
“For the heck of it.”

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:38.190
I said, “For the heck of it? So mad?”

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:45.380
So that democracy has not created a good society,
not good society. They have money, that’s

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:53.320
all. But money is also not so much well-balanced,
I would say; it doesn’t create good people,

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:03.760
good children, good families. It should be
the money which is auspicious, which should

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:11.540
create good atmosphere. And very sick people
there are: certain are very silly also, stupid.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:22.030
Like eighty-two-year-old people, cinema actors
and actresses, going for a shake dance – they’re

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:32.860
already shaking! I mean, this I can’t understand.
And they, they want to ride horses at the

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:47.320
age of ninety-two years of age. And then they
fall down and die. What is the need at ninety-two

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:54.320
to ride a horse? I mean, there’s no maturity.
If democracy cannot mature you, then it’s

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:03.970
not nourishing. It must mature; you must become
a wiser person. If you still remain a sixteen-year-old

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:12.580
brat, what’s the use?

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:21.370
So it has failed somewhere. As communism has
failed, it has also failed. But Gorbachev

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:29.220
could see. Mr. Bush has to also see that.
Also the way they are supporting these Azerbaijanis

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:35.360
– they’re horrible people, these Azerbaijani.
I’ve been there, I’ve been to Samarkand

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:40.690
and I’ve been to all these places, and they
were rolling in luxuries, rolling in luxuries

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:45.510
when I went there, thousand time better than
their neighbors Afghanis.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:51.730
But they said, “We are very miserable because
we can’t follow Islam.”

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:56.180
But I said, “Why do you want to follow Islam?
What Islam has done good or Christianity has

00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:00.090
done good? Why are you so much anxious to
follow Islam?”

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.130
“No, we must have.”

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:06.660
And now the Iranians are penetrating that,
and if you support these Azerbaijanis you

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:13.660
are supporting the Iranians and their fundamentalism.
So there’s no thought given to it. It’s

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:21.240
not a proper vision; it’s a very blurred
vision. One should see clearly what we are

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:29.130
doing, who are we helping. There should be
some principle in what we are doing. Imagine,

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:40.170
Abraham Lincoln who started, who was a realized
soul himself, and how far you have taken him

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:49.310
there? And there’s only one single road
somewhere in his name. I mean, nobody bothers

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:55.730
about the principles he established. So something
has gone wrong there. So we must sit back

00:40:55.730 --> 00:41:02.730
and see that what’s wrong with our democracy.
And in all these democratic countries all

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:16.850
kinds of false gurus have prospered, because
everybody has freedom to give the money to

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:18.870
whosoever they like.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:25.870
Yes? These two ladies …. All right, you
ask first.

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:37.470
[Question: She’s been doing yoga for fifteen
years. And she says she has reached all these

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:58.090
points that You have mentioned, but she is
weak on her left side. Can You help her?]

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:06.190
Yah. It’s just the outcome of the modern
yoga, absolutely. Actually, Patanjali has

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:17.440
written such a big book on Hatha Yoga. Nobody
reads that. Only they have taken a wee, wee,

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:25.880
wee part of it, which is ashtanga, means there
are eight portions out of which one portion

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:34.520
is yam niyam, out of which it’s one-eighth
of the portion is about exercise, the physical.

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:44.590
But that also is to be used when your kundalini
is rising and you see the defects in your

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:53.280
spinal cord, or anywhere in your chakras:
then you must know if there is any need for

00:42:54.290 --> 00:43:01.290
a physical correction – all right? But the
way we are doing now Hatha Yoga is like taking

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:09.240
all the medicines of the medicine box inside,
without any discrimination. So when we pay

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:14.120
so much attention to the physical side, we
go to the right side and left side is neglected.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:21.120
There’s an imbalance. And you develop lots
of physical troubles also – physical. Like

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:27.970
these days jogging is a fashion, so everybody’s
jogging. Everybody wants to be a cinema actress,

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:34.360
or might be a beauty competition – I don’t
know what they want. And they don’t understand

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:40.330
that we are human beings, we are delicately
made. Even old people of eighty years are

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:47.330
jogging, for what? And then they get heart
attacks, serious troubles.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:55.340
So this kind of a Hatha Yoga weakens your
left side to such an extent that a woman may

00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:02.340
not be able to produce a child, even. Apart
from that, a man who does Hatha Yoga of this

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:07.970
kind is such a hot-tempered fellow, like an
oven, that you’d better approach that person

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:14.970
with a barge-pole! God knows when he’ll
jump on you. But in Sahaja Yoga you’ll achieve

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:22.270
your balance. So don’t, not to do so many
exercises now, discriminately understanding

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:28.400
which one you want, you have to do – that
much you should do.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:35.400
Yes. Then there’s one lady here who raised
the hand.

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:45.190
[Question: How can you tell whether you are
acting from intuition or if it's just the

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.770
desire of the moment?]

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:58.100
You mean you are asking Me or about yourself?

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:05.100
[Question: In a general sense. How can you
tell the difference?]

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:12.170
Because you have not reached that state of
Self-realization. In Self-realization if you

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:22.870
ask a question, any question: say, somebody
says, “I don’t believe in God.” All

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:29.870
right, ask a question, “Is there God?”
three times, and you get a beautiful wind

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:38.800
coming on you. “Was Christ the Son of God?”
Ask this question: you get it. Then ask about

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:49.230
some horrid guru who has been lynching you,
and you will get burns, might get even blisters.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:57.180
But unless and until you are a realized soul,
you have to – it’s not easy to make it

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:04.180
out. The only thing, you have to be connected
first of all and to be established. Then you

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:11.900
reach a state of doubtless awareness, from
the thoughtless awareness. And then you become

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:12.150
tremendous.

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:18.270
[Sahaja yogi: There’s one right at the back.]

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:24.500
Anyone.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:31.500
[Question: Does your realization take place
instantly or does it take place gradually?]

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:48.680
It takes instantly, My child. It should. Most
of the cases it has to; it’s so spontaneous.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.560
There was a saint called Ramadasa who was
the guru of Shivaji, a great king in India

00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:02.910
– a realized soul, again – and somebody
asked that saint, “How much time does it

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:05.010
take for the kundalini to rise?”

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:10.160
And in Sanskrit he said, “Tatkshan” – means
“that moment.” That moment. But there

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:17.160
has to be the person who gives you realization
authorized by the Divine, and the one who

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:26.030
is a seeker of truth. I mean, I’m Myself
surprised the way it's happening today, everywhere.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:36.410
These days it’s really very surprising that
the Divine is so anxious to give you realization.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:41.230
Many people ask Me, “Mother, why do You
give realization to so many people?”

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:45.730
I said, “How can I limit it? Now it has
become limitless.”

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:52.730
Some, like the parable of Christ, fall in
the marshy land and just sprouted and lost

00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:02.720
– I know that. But they’ll come back;
I’m sure they’ll come back. But some do

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:10.120
prosper very fast and settle down. Imagine
in a place like Russia, I thought this must

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:15.960
be just wilderness, there I find beautiful
things happening. They, they never talked

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:22.960
of God, they never talked of religion, they
never talked of spirituality. And openly I

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:32.200
talked of God and everything; nobody arrested
Me there. Here, we who worship God and who

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:41.560
have so many churches, who have so many temples
and mosques and all that, you have – I have

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:48.560
to move like a criminal! Except for their
church or their mosque or their temples, you

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:55.870
are a cult; while they take all the money,
everything – they are very money-oriented

00:48:55.870 --> 00:49:02.870
and power-oriented also – but you are a
cult! Is very funny.

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:11.830
Yes, please? There’s still the another gentleman
also? …. All right. They need to ask Me

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.150
….

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:17.490
[Question: Mother, I’ve been trying for
about two months, but I don’t feel any cool

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:18.010
breeze up here.]

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:25.010
You feel it in your hands?

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:27.350
[No, I don’t.]

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:32.750
All right, we’ll see about it. After the
program – ah, definitely today you’ll

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:36.660
feel it.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:43.660
[Question: Where in the seven centers would
You place instinct?]

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:52.710
You see, “instinct” is a very confusing
word – all right? In the seventh center

00:49:53.540 --> 00:50:00.520
when you arrive, you arrive in the limbic
area. And limbic area has got the seven seats

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:07.520
of seven centers. So you cannot say that any
particular place is the instinct, but the

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:18.480
instinct comes from the Divine. So when it
is connected with the Divine, you receive

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:28.450
it in your brain and it’s transmitted to
your nerves. Also it is transmitted to your

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:40.180
centers, nourishing it. So you cannot categorize
it.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:51.520
Yes, what is it? Ask, ask!

00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:02.400
[Question: He finds it very confusing: what
is mind, what is a thought and what is thinking?]

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:16.800
I think tomorrow I’m going to talk about
thinking. In that I’ll tell you everything

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:22.600
– all right? Can you keep it for tomorrow,
please? All right? Tomorrow I’ll tell you.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:28.040
[Question: Got food anything to do with this
process or technique?]

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:34.640
You see, any kind of food that you eat has
to be suitable for your temperament, your

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:39.700
prakriti. It has to be suitable. Supposing
you are a very right-sided person, then it’s

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:45.900
better for you to take more to carbohydrates.
But supposing you are a left-sided person,

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:51.870
is better for you to take to proteins. There’s
no hard and fast rule about it. It has to

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:58.870
be complementary to your nature. That’s
how we decide. Every individual has a different

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:06.690
temperament, and accordingly we have to decide
what sort of food one should take. … May

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.510
God bless.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:21.510
[Question: Two questions, Shri Mother. One,
are You a vegetarian? And secondly, does the

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:29.740
soul have a memory?]

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:36.600
All right. About Me you’d better discover.
You see, I don’t talk about Myself. The

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:43.600
reason is this: anybody who tried to seek,
say anything about oneself or claim anything,

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:51.590
people have been very nasty. Christ said,
“I am the Son of God” – which is a fact.

00:52:55.370 --> 00:53:02.370
They crucified Him. He didn’t tell a lie.
So I’m very tactful! So you first get your

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:13.430
realization, because I don’t want to get
crucified just now; I want to postpone it

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:20.430
as much as possible! So about Me you can find
out, once you get your realization, is better.

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:26.260
What is the second?

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:30.160
[Question: Does the soul have a memory?]

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:35.520
Soul has a memory, of course it has. Soul
also is another subject which will take at

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:42.430
least three, four lectures, and I have given
lectures on that. You can take the tape and

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:49.360
see for yourself, and after realization you
can see those dead souls also and also you

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:56.360
can see the Chaitanya, these vibrations, as
small little commas shining. After realization

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:02.460
you see them. And now there are lots of discoveries
have been made which I’ve said about soul,

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:09.460
which you can also see from My tapes and can
hear about it. It’s a very long subject.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:39.890
All right?

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:46.890
[Question: He has some artificial heart valves
and things in his body, and he wonders if

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:56.990
a person who has artificial organs can obtain
Self-realization.]

00:54:56.990 --> 00:55:03.990
Of course, you can. Anybody who is living
can get realization. Because, you are living

00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:13.850
because there is spirit within you. The day
spirit disappears from your heart, we are

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:26.550
no more. On the contrary, your heart condition
will improve, very much. Many people who had

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:35.530
bypass got rid of it. Many people who had
angina got completely cured. Many heart patients

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.330
were cured completely.

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:46.330
Yes, now, you ask. Now she is asking. … Can
you hear her? Little loudly, can you?

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:06.400
[Question: Apparently the authors of a lot
of these chakra books say that each chakra

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:24.250
corresponds to a different …]

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:24.500
Areas.

00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:25.090
[Question continues: ... corroboration of
your soul, of your being. Is that actually

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.750
true? Like as in the chakra here – ]

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:27.420
Agnya.

00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:34.030
[Question continues: Yeah. If, they say that
if that’s opened, you are able to perceive

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:35.670
things in other beings; like you’re able
to see where they have been and … or you

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:36.690
are able to use psychic powers and things,
you know? Is that actually true?]

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:40.110
Yah. Now, this chakra is very important … This
chakra of Agnya which is on the optic chiasma

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:47.110
is a very important center. It is a very constricted
thing, and the resurrection of Christ has

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:57.450
solved the problem for us, because He was
resurrected and He's bestowed upon on this

00:56:57.450 --> 00:57:04.450
chakra. He’s the ruling deity of this chakra.
So when kundalini awakens Him on this chakra,

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:13.610
He sucks in these two balloons, as I told
you: ego and superego. Now the ego and superego

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:23.400
are controlled by two organs or two things,
what we call as the pituitary and the pineal.

00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:32.880
So this center controls pituitary and the
pineal part. Also it is on the optic chiasma.

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:39.880
So you can see things clearly through it.
When it is awakened, you start seeing subtler

00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:49.580
things. But if you see the light, then it’s
not correct. That means you have moved to

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:54.490
the right, because you see elements on the
right side. You may see also the past: you

00:57:54.490 --> 00:58:05.157
may, you may see Krishna; you may see somebody,
the past. What you have to see, whatever you

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:10.900
see, you are not that. Supposing I see the
light, I am not the light. So you have to

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:17.900
be the light. So this movement is deviation
from reality. Either to the right, to the

00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:25.690
left, is not correct and should not be considered
as some achievement, because seeing gives

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:33.890
you nothing. Being gives you. It is becoming;
you have to become. All right? Now, is there?

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:55.060
[Question: Are our actions governed by free
will, or is it just fate?]

00:58:55.060 --> 00:59:02.060
It’s free will, absolute free will. You
have come here with your free will, and I

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:11.300
respect your free will, your freedom. If you
don’t want to have Self-realization, it

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:19.180
cannot be forced, it cannot be done. It respects
your free will. You can only get it if you

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:29.670
in free will, in your free glory, you want
to have it. In a way, of course, it does help

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:40.630
people who live in moderation; but as I told
you, the Divine is so anxious that whatever

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:47.190
you might have been, you get your realization,
sort of a thing happening today. That’s

00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:54.190
what I’ve seen it. So that’s what you
should expect, and shouldn’t think of your

00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:59.160
past at all. Forget it. Yes?

00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.880
[Question: What then of karma?]

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:07.880
Karma, as I told you, is sucked in when the
kundalini rises through this center. She’s

01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:15.340
sucked in those two institutions. One of them
is of ego. Is the only ego tells us we are

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:19.980
doing karmas. Animals don’t feel they are
committing sins or doing karmas; only we,

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:25.950
because we have ego. This ego is sucked in.
So all our karmas are finished. They said

01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:32.950
Christ has died for our sins, and that is
proved. … So far …

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:51.200
[Question: In regard to reincarnation, do
humans come back as humans?]

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:08.290
Yes, they do. Some of them do come from animal
stage also, because that we can explain why

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:10.850
they behave like this!

01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:17.850
[Question: Mother, I’ve been getting very
powerful sensations on this finger here and

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:28.520
this area here. What is the cause of that
disturbance …?]

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.610
What is the feeling? In the Agnya, here? Here
and here. You are feeling heat?

01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:40.610
[Pain on top of that finger and a small, a
kind of heat and pain there …]

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:49.400
Here? All right. You don’t worry about the
cause. We’ll correct it. All right? It’s,

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:58.960
it’s better not to know about it. It’s
nothing serious but still … You see, this

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.490
may be that – what is your job?

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:08.490
[I don’t have a job. I was in an auto accident
last year and I’ve been incapacitated since.]

01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.700
Incapacitated?

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:10.960
[Yes.]

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:11.230
How?

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:18.230
[Injuries to both legs and right up to my
abdomen, right up to my chest.]

01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.440
What he said?

01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.260
[Sahaja yogi: He's had severe injuries to
both legs and his torso up to his chest.]

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:21.750
And on your left hand, what are you feeling?

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:26.040
[A lot of pain in that finger there and a
pain just here which is in line with the third

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:26.290
finger.]

01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.660
All of them?

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:33.660
[Sahaja yogi: The right Vishuddhi, Shri Mother
…]

01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:40.700
[And this one here.]

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:47.700
All right. So this is, this is definitely
connected with your body and that has to be

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:55.760
corrected, that’s all. All right? Then you
won’t feel anything.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:02.760
[Question: Why do we take on the physical
state?]

01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:13.490
You cannot get realization without it, My
child. You cannot get
it in the air!

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:33.420
[Question: He said, if realization is the
dropping away of habits, isn’t riding a

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:49.710
horse at ninety-five just a matter of habit?]

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:56.240
No, no, no, no, no! You didn’t understand.
No, what happens, you become a very powerful

01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:02.900
personality. And you become an enlightened
personality. So you drop out whatever is bad

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.990
for you, that’s all.

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:09.860
[Question: Is horse-riding necessarily bad?]

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.860
Anything that is not good for you, you understand
and nobody has to tell you. You become your

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:19.570
own master, you become your own guru and you
drop it. I don’t have to tell you “don’t

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:23.740
do this” or “don’t do that” – you
just do it yourself. Isn’t it better for

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:30.740
Me? (Now, so many questions; it’s ten o’clock
about, yes?)

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.000
[Unclear question]

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:46.000
What did he say? Did you follow him?

01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:54.870
[Sahaja yogi: I don’t think I got that one.
…. I think he said, if You promote the idea

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:25.250
of jumping into the divine flow of vibrations
and want to clear ourselves, once upon a time

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:30.360
we jumped into the river to get clean but
now the river is polluted. Are there dangers

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.730
in jumping into the spirit?]

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:40.730
No, no, not at all dangerous – it’s wonderful!
No, no, not at all dangerous: that’s a myth.

01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:47.070
That’s a myth about kundalini. It’s such
a myth they have created because they never

01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:52.010
wanted you to get your realization, so that
they could make money out of you, you see.

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:57.520
They don’t want you to go to reality. So
then, they can use you. That’s the reason

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.820
they said all these things. It has no meaning.
We have now been working in so many places,

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:08.390
I’ve never seen. At the most some people,
like this lady who was here was sick, was

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:14.030
shaking her hand, and then she put it to her
Mother Earth and she was sitting before Me,

01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:20.349
and she got all right. So her shaking stopped.
It was Parkinson’s. Just sitting here; she’s

01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.599
gone now.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:20.779
[Question: What is the flame, Shri Mother
‒ the spirit? What is the flame? …. On

01:06:20.779 --> 01:06:25.080
the chart.]

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:32.080
Where is the flame?

01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:40.170
[Sahaja yogi: On the left Heart.]

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:47.170
On the left Heart is the spirit. Is the spirit.
It’s difficult to show spirit, you see,

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:57.900
so they have shown it as a flame.

01:07:00.389 --> 01:07:07.389
[Question: Do dreams have a part in one's
spirit?]

01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:14.810
They come from different areas. They don’t
only come from collective subconscious, they

01:07:14.810 --> 01:07:20.770
come also from the subconscious that you have
had in past lives, maybe in this life; could

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:27.060
be from just from yesterday. So it depends
on from what area it comes. But it’s not

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:31.360
important. Once you know the real truth, then
you don’t bother about these things; because

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:37.110
the communication is not circuitous, it’s
just direct, so you know the truth. So you’re

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:41.520
not interested to know any more.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:48.520
[Question: Is there
a place for sorrow in someone who is self-realized?]

01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:03.040
No, no, not at all. It’s such a joy. You
see, sorrow comes through our ignorance. Also

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:14.950
they want to, you to feel sorry for everything,
you know. Like the way they show Christ like

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:21.950
a skeleton, you see, naturally you feel sorry;
but only Michelangelo could see clearly that

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:29.280
it was a great Personality. So he painted
Him like a great giant in the, you see Him

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:37.630
in the Sistine Chapel. But below on the table
they have placed a skeleton of Christ which

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:46.380
is, creates such horrible feelings within
yourself. I think we should ask one of these

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:53.230
priests to carry one, the cross across and
see if they can do it with their skeleton

01:08:53.230 --> 01:08:53.940
bodies.

01:08:53.940 --> 01:09:00.940
So sorrow is also created. Also, people like
to show they are sorry. Like this Greek tragedy

01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:10.050
has no sense in it; just make it Greek tragedy,
unnecessarily. I mean, one gentleman falls

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:21.590
in love: he falls, doesn’t rise, falls in
love! And then he doesn’t marry that person;

01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:29.780
then he is pining. I mean, human life is worth
much more, not to pine after one lady. Then

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:37.180
in next year he marries that lady. I mean
this is the – you see, everything must have

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:43.020
an antithesis also. So then he marries the
same lady, and then he wants to get rid of

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:50.020
her somehow. And then he murders her out of
frustration. This should be the story, because

01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:57.510
this kind of wasteful habits of human beings
leading nowhere. You cannot get joy from another

01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:05.190
person: joy is your own property. This comes
from your own spirit. It doesn’t depend

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:13.760
on another person. Only a realized soul can
enjoy another realized soul. Only you understand

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:21.210
the value of another person when you are a
realized soul, and another person is also

01:10:21.210 --> 01:10:27.150
a realized soul; otherwise you cannot. Yes?

01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:31.720
[Unclear question]

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:38.720
You see, Gorbachev has solved one problem,
a little bit. Because these are two superior

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:56.380
powers, you see: super-most, we can call,
superpowers. So the, you need two hands to

01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:02.630
clap. So one hand has receded. Now this hand
doesn’t know what to do, what to hit, so

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:09.630
it has to recede also. So in a way, the pressure
of war he has lessened, and he is going to

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:18.060
lessen more. But I think today the world problem
is, if you see internationally, is fundamentalism.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:27.570
Is fundamentalism. And those who try to encourage
fundamentalism are really committing sins

01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:34.570
against humanity, I think. So fundamentalism
I find as the biggest problem, and to answer

01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:37.650
to this is Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:41.820
Then our social problems come because we don’t
understand the role of a woman and the role

01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:47.130
of a man; and when we don’t respect women
for their great role they are playing, they

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:54.130
become something funny. So all this understanding
comes to you very beautifully when you become

01:11:54.940 --> 01:12:01.940
a self-realized person. Another problem is
ecological problem, comes out of our own imbalances.

01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:09.110
Whatever is inside, we manifest outside. You
see, there’s so much imbalance in us.

01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:16.590
Like in, when we were in India I never allowed
any drinks in My house. I said, “All right,

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:21.360
if you want to drink, drink in your house
and come to My house.” But I can’t understand

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:28.360
a person who is drunk. God knows, he might
just get up and slap Me or do anything! But

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:35.680
when we went to London, they, they said we
have to offer them. I said, “All right.”

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.990
I told My husband, “You arrange all that.
Do it yourself.” That time ‒ it’s long

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:47.990
time back I’m telling you ‒ just to buy
crystal tumblers for an ordinary party we

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:56.940
had to shell out nine hundred pounds, to begin
with. That’s the beginning of the library.

01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:04.730
And so many were to be added later on. There
is one cup for this and a one cup for that

01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:11.730
– I mean, a one cup is sufficient. And one
tumbler for that and this – big, it’s

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:21.890
a big science, you know ‒ books after books.
I told My husband, “You’d better get it

01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:28.480
and read it.” Then we hired three, four
people. I said, “Baba, you look after these

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:34.010
people.” Somebody wants this, somebody wants
that, and it’s a very big sort of a social

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:35.050
nonsensical wastage.

01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:42.050
So these things we have created. Then, fork
and spoon, you start from here, go on like

01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:52.540
that; and then go on that way. There’s no
need to do all that. And I understand, if

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:59.430
it was something artistic, all right, some
artists are doing. But these days there’s

01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:04.520
no art: it’s so simple, there’s no art
in it. If there’s even one flower they don’t

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:11.520
like it – this is too much. No art anywhere,
no Limoges, it’s just straightforward march.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:20.100
So all this creation is all useless rubbish
which will form another plastic mountain.

01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:29.150
So this ecological problem has come because
we have no sense of balance and discretion.

01:14:29.150 --> 01:14:33.690
Just go to the shopping: the husband gives
the money to the wife to buy some shirts and

01:14:33.690 --> 01:14:40.690
she comes out with some three, four funny
punk dresses which will be discarded after

01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:49.920
three, four months. We play into the hands
of entrepreneurs all the time. Entrepreneurs

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.070
start some sort of a funny dress: all right,
everybody must dress up like that. We have

01:14:54.070 --> 01:15:00.050
our own intelligence, we have our own personality!
We have no individuality left; everybody must

01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:01.390
dress up the same way.

01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:08.010
Now, I should say that we must put some oil
in our head at least the day we want to wash

01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:15.010
our hair, because we’ll all become bald
and then these entrepreneurs will sell us

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:21.230
the wigs. That’s the trick! So now the fashion
is not to put oil – all right, don’t put

01:15:21.230 --> 01:15:27.210
oil; but at least before washing your hair
you can put some oil in your head. You see,

01:15:27.210 --> 01:15:31.690
this is what I am saying: the wisdom part
is not there and the balance is not there,

01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:38.690
and because of that we are getting into trouble.
All kinds of venturesome things have started,

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:46.500
like the Grand Prix. Now, the man must die
in the Grand Prix, otherwise it’s not a

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:50.040
good one – that’s what they say, exactly.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:55.340
So this sensationalisation – must have sensations,
as if we have become numbed people: absolutely

01:15:55.340 --> 01:16:00.770
we have no sensitivity to feel any joy or
happiness, so we have to be given injections

01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:07.500
all the time, like electric shocks. To Me
all these things, this looks so shocking.

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:11.750
And I’ll tell you tomorrow what happens
to you when you get into all these shocks.

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:18.750
This is what happens, that you develop blood
cancer. Cancer is created by us, by our imbalance,

01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:28.890
by our insanity. We have to become sane people.
We must respect ourselves. Perhaps we have

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:36.750
had no identity so far, that’s why we are
like this. But once you are realized, you

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:43.750
know your identity and then you enjoy yourself,
you respect yourself. And don’t waste your

01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:48.280
time in useless things, destroying yourself.

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:55.280
Yes? I, I tell you now, you see, the time
is coming up much more, so one question will

01:16:57.670 --> 01:17:04.670
do. Now who will withdraw? …. All right,
one lady waiting. Who is that one? This one?

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.640
…. What is it? …. What?

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:29.640
[Question: The spirit. Does the spirit discriminate
between good and evil, love and hate, or does

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:33.910
it just react?]

01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:40.910
Spirit is the source of knowledge, absolute
knowledge; is the source of peace, is the

01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:53.130
source of wisdom, is the source of joy, is
the source that enlightens our attention.

01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:08.130
We have such a big property with us. We should
allow it to enlighten us, shouldn’t we?

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:18.820
Now I think we should stop the questions,
because there’s one thing: I’m quite good

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:25.960
at answering questions. I’ll answer all
your questions, but by that I cannot guarantee

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.780
your realization. I can answer most of your
questions, but I can’t guarantee your realization.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:40.600
Realization has to work out. So even if you
have not been able to ask some question, forget

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:47.600
it. You can bring them tomorrow written down,
and I would like to answer them when you come

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:53.480
tomorrow. Beforehand if you give, I’ll answer
them. But just now I think, tell your mind

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:57.610
not to bother you any more about questions.
And that’s why I wanted you to ask questions,

01:18:57.610 --> 01:19:02.400
so that your mind should not suddenly come
out like jack-in-the-box and say, “Oh, you

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:09.400
didn’t ask this question. How can you have
realization?” So the most important thing

01:19:10.650 --> 01:19:15.430
is to get your realization.

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:22.430
So I think, let us have it now. Again, I cannot
force on you. You have to have it in your

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:30.400
free will. So please, those who want to have
should be there. It will take hardly ten minutes

01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:38.610
to work it out, and then tomorrow again I’m
going to work it out. It’s very simple,

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:46.900
very easy. But those who don’t want to have
it should not be in the hall. It’s not proper,

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:52.630
it’s not civil. So all those who want to
have it, are welcome.

01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:59.630
At the very outset, at the very outset there
are two conditions I have to tell you. First

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:18.110
one, as I told you before also, you have to
forget the past. You have to forgive yourself,

01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:27.100
and know that you are not guilty at all. All
these ideas are given to you that you are

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:34.100
sinful, you are guilty, you are this and that
because they wanted to cash it. You don’t

01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:43.740
have to suffer either. So first of all you
should know that you must forgive yourself

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:52.690
and must have self-esteem and you should be
very pleasantly placed towards yourself, because

01:20:52.690 --> 01:20:59.690
you are going to enter into the Kingdom of
God. This is the first condition.

01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:08.380
Now the second condition is that you have
to forgive everyone. Some will say it’s

01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:17.790
very difficult to forgive. But whether you
forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:25.130
anything. It’s a myth. But if you don’t
forgive then you really play into the hands

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:30.590
of the people who want to torture you. So
best is to forgive them, forget about them.

01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:36.140
Forgive and forget. But don’t start counting
how many people I have to forgive, what mistakes

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:42.080
they have done – nothing of the kind. Just
in general say “I forgive everyone” – just,

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:48.440
and it’s done. Because Divine is the ocean
of forgiveness, it’s a very powerful ocean

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:55.440
of forgiveness, and you cannot do anything
that it cannot forgive. And once you say “I

01:21:55.610 --> 01:22:02.610
forgive,” Divine takes over; we don’t
have to bother. All right? These are the two

01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:10.550
conditions we have; very simple conditions,
I think. We have to take out our shoes to

01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:17.550
take the help of the Mother Earth. That’s
very important.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:30.700
(It’s supposed to be .… Too much for the
throat, talking all the time. All right.)

01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:07.070
Now …. (It’s all right.) You have to put
both your feet apart from each other, because

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:14.650
as I told you there are two powers. A little
apart from each other, not touching. And you

01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:20.900
have to be comfortable. If there’s something
tight you can release it a little bit. You

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:27.860
need not bend down or stretch yourself too
much. Just in a normal way you sit down. Put

01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:34.860
no strain on your body. You have to put your
left hand towards Me like this, in a comfortable

01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:43.830
way, on your – you can keep it on your lap,
whatever is comfortable. Now this represents

01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:51.220
that you desire to have your realization.
So you keep it all the time like this. And

01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:58.220
with the right hand we’ll nourish our centers.
With the right hand we will nourish our centers.

01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:06.670
And so you will know also how to raise your
kundalini yourself. So two things can be done:

01:24:06.670 --> 01:24:13.670
your kundalini will be raised; as well as
you will feel, you will know how to feel your

01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:21.500
centers within yourself and how to correct
them. We’ll be working only on the left-hand

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:28.500
side. So now you have to put the left hand
towards Me. First I’ll show you, he will

01:24:29.710 --> 01:24:36.710
show you what is to be done, and then you’ll
have to close your eyes later on.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:47.560
First we’ll put our hand on our heart. In
the heart resides the spirit. Then we’ll

01:24:55.910 --> 01:25:02.910
have to put our hand on the upper portion
of our abdomen, on the left-hand side. This

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:11.460
is the center of your mastery, created by
great masters. Then you have to take your

01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:18.790
right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen
on the left-hand side, which is a very important

01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:25.790
center which manifests this pure knowledge
on your central nervous system. Then you have

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:42.480
to raise your hand higher, again on to the
left side of your abdomen, on the upper part.

01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:51.230
Press it hard, on the center of mastery. Then
to your heart again. And then on to the corner

01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:04.220
between your neck and your shoulder – from
the front side, not from the back but from

01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:10.850
the front side – and turn your head to your
right. Now this center is very important,

01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:17.320
because this catches on very much, specially
in the West, because people all the time feel

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:24.320
guilty. And because of this people get spondylitis
and angina and all other lethargic organs

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:32.180
diseases. So please put your hand here, as
far back as possible, and turn your head to

01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:35.170
your right.

01:26:35.170 --> 01:26:42.170
Now, take your right hand and put it on your
forehead across and try to put your head down

01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:53.430
slowly, resting on this hand. And now press
it on both the sides, as we do it when we

01:26:59.870 --> 01:27:06.870
have headache. This is the center for forgiving
others. Then you have to take down your hand,

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:13.680
take up your hand onto the back side of your
head where the optic lobe is, here at the

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:20.680
back. And now turn your head upward as far
as possible, resting on your hand. This is

01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:29.610
the center where you have to ask for forgiveness
from the Divine without feeling guilty – is

01:27:29.610 --> 01:27:36.610
for your satisfaction. Now, stretch your hand,
stretch your palm and put the center of your

01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:45.970
palm just on top of the fontanel bone area,
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:54.550
And now bend your head, please, downward as
much as possible. Push back your fingers,

01:27:57.510 --> 01:28:04.510
push back as much as possible. Now there will
be a pressure on the scalp. Now move this

01:28:05.010 --> 01:28:12.010
pressure on the scalp slowly clockwise, seven
times. You have to move the scalp, not your

01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:19.390
hand so much as the scalp, seven times clockwise,
slowly. Bend your head.

01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:29.610
That’s what we’ll have to do. That’s
all, nothing more. That’s the only thing

01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:42.280
we have to do. Now, you can take out your
spectacles if you want because you’re closing

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:48.410
your eyes, and might help your eyesight also.

01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:55.410
Now, put your left hand towards Me, comfortably.
Put your feet apart from each other. And now

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:05.840
put your right hand on your heart and close
your eyes. Here you have to ask Me a very

01:29:14.150 --> 01:29:21.150
important question, in your heart. You ask
Me a question as you would ask a computer.

01:29:21.850 --> 01:29:28.850
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother”,
whatever you like. “Mother, am I the spirit?”

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:37.740
Ask the question, in your heart, not loudly.
Three times ask in your heart, not loudly,

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:44.740
“Mother, am I the spirit?” You have to
only ask in your heart.

01:29:54.700 --> 01:30:00.720
If you are the spirit you become your own
guide, you become your own master, you become

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:07.720
your own guru. So now take down your right
hand into the upper portion of your abdomen

01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:17.030
on the left-hand side. And here you have to
ask another question, three times, not loudly,

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:31.440
in your heart, “Mother, am I the spirit?”
– ah! “Mother, am I my own master? Mother,

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:39.510
am I my own master?” Ask this question three
times. “Am I my own master?”

01:30:57.710 --> 01:31:04.710
I have told you that I respect your freedom,
and the pure knowledge cannot be forced on

01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:17.550
you. So please take your right hand in the
lower portion of your abdomen, and say it

01:31:22.450 --> 01:31:29.450
six times, asking Me, “Mother, please give
me pure knowledge.” I cannot force on you.

01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:39.370
You have to ask in your free will.

01:31:42.170 --> 01:31:49.170
As soon as you ask for the pure knowledge,
the kundalini starts moving upward.

01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:09.370
So now we have to nourish the higher centers
with our self-confidence. Raise your right

01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:23.150
hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.
Press it hard, on the left-hand side. And

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:36.110
here with full confidence you have to say
ten times, in your heart, not loudly, “Mother,

01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:45.130
I am my own master.” Please say this ten
times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:14.110
I told you at the very outset that the greatest
truth about you is that you are not this body,

01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:21.700
you are not this mind, you are not these conditionings,
emotions, nor this ego, but you are the spirit.

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:31.800
You are the pure spirit. So now raise your
right hand onto your heart and ask here, or

01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:52.870
say with full confidence, twelve times, “Mother,
I am the spirit.” Just say it without any

01:33:57.450 --> 01:34:04.450
hesitation. Say it twelve times, please.

01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:21.900
For your information you have to know that
the divine Power is the source of knowledge,

01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:38.830
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of
love. It is the ocean of peace and ocean of

01:34:45.370 --> 01:34:52.370
bliss. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.
So you cannot commit any mistake which cannot

01:34:54.810 --> 01:35:01.810
be dissolved by the power of this ocean of
forgiveness. So please raise your right hand

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:09.840
in the corner of your neck, on your shoulder,
push it back as much as possible and turn

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:18.200
your head to your right, and with full confidence
please say sixteen times, full confidence,

01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:29.780
in your heart, “Mother, I am not guilty
at all.”

01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:47.910
All right. As I told you before that you have
to forgive everyone, and those who say it

01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:04.410
is difficult, they must know that it is a
myth whether you forgive or don’t forgive.

01:36:04.410 --> 01:36:11.410
But if you don’t forgive then you play into
the wrong hands and get yourself tortured

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:18.060
by yourself. So please forgive – in general,
everyone, not counting how many people you

01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:23.940
have to forgive, what you have to forgive
– but just say, by raising your hand and

01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:30.940
putting it on top of your forehead across,
putting down your head as much as possible,

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:39.000
resting on your hand. Please say, with an
open heart please say, “Mother, I forgive

01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:53.490
everyone.” Please say it, please say; otherwise
it is difficult later on for Me: I have to

01:37:00.010 --> 01:37:06.510
clear out everybody’s Agnya and this takes
too much time then. So best is to say it from

01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:13.510
your heart. After all, you are not going to
miss your Self-realization for that.

01:37:16.050 --> 01:37:23.050
Now take back your right hand on the back
side of your head, and put your head on it,

01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:34.540
resting on it, upward. Here you have to say
for your own satisfaction, “Oh Divine, if

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:44.600
I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”
But don’t feel guilty, don’t count your

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:49.720
mistakes, don’t think about them. In general
you have to say, “Oh Divine, please forgive

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:56.720
me if I have done any mistakes or anything
wrong, anything against You.”

01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:08.750
Now, stretch your palm, stretch your palm
and put the center of your palm on top of

01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:17.850
the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone
in your childhood. Now put down your head

01:38:18.929 --> 01:38:25.929
properly. And here push back your fingers
as far as possible. Please push back. This

01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:36.130
is very important. And now put a pressure
on your scalp, and move your scalp slowly

01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:43.780
seven times clockwise. Here again I respect
your freedom, and I cannot force Self-realization

01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:53.990
on you. So here you have to say seven times,
bending your head properly and pressing it

01:38:54.770 --> 01:39:01.220
hard, moving seven times, “Mother, please
give me my Self-realization.” Please ask

01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:03.520
seven times, please.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:10.520
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.]

01:39:31.110 --> 01:39:38.110
Now, take down your hands and put them towards
Me, little higher. Now, little bit put your

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:17.070
right hand like this. Bend your head, and
see for yourself if there is a cool breeze

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:24.440
coming out of your head. But don’t touch
it – above your head, above your head. And

01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:33.300
some people get it far. So just try to feel
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:40.220
head. Now, don’t start doubting that it’s
air-conditioning and all that – air-conditioning

01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:47.220
cannot come out of your head! So see for yourself.
Now, put
your left hand towards Me. Now again bend

01:40:56.990 --> 01:41:03.990
your head, and see for yourself if there’s
a cool breeze coming out of your head. All

01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:19.590
right? Now put your right hand again, and
again bend your head and see for yourself

01:41:21.690 --> 01:41:27.560
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your
head. It might be hot also, doesn’t matter.

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:34.420
It may be heat coming out first and then the
cool breeze. Doesn’t matter if it is hot,

01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:36.830
doesn’t matter.

01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:43.830
Now, put your both the hands towards the sky
like this. Bend back, and ask Me a question.

01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:54.860
Three times, you can ask Me the question,
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the

01:41:54.860 --> 01:42:01.860
Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the all-pervading
Power of divine love? Mother, is this the

01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:11.220
Paramachaitanya?” Ask any one of these questions
three times.

01:42:17.110 --> 01:42:24.110
Now put down your hands. Now watch Me without
thinking. You can do it. Those who have felt

01:42:32.690 --> 01:42:39.690
the cool breeze in their hands or out of their
fontanel bone area, whether cool or hot, please

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:48.600
raise both your hands – both. Let’s see.
Just see the en masse, just see – wonderful!

01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:56.160
So may God bless you all.

01:42:56.160 --> 01:43:03.160
I bow to you all, because you have started
now your saintly life. And all those who didn’t

01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:10.660
get also should not get disappointed. On the
contrary, if time permits I would like to

01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:16.820
meet the people who have felt the cool breeze,
and those who haven’t felt can come on this

01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:22.920
side and the Sahaja yogis can work on them.
Again tomorrow you must come so you’ll be

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:27.920
fixed properly. Some, those who want to meet
Me can come and see Me, because there is some

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:34.920
time, and in the meanwhile we can have some
music. Now don’t think about it. If you

01:43:37.450 --> 01:43:42.150
start thinking, you’ll be lost. Just don’t
think about it; it’s beyond thinking.

01:43:42.150 --> 01:43:48.780
Thank you very much. Thank you. Beautiful!
Oh, My! Thank you. It’s beautiful flowers.

01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:53.429
If you can push this apart, I’d like to
meet people.

01:43:53.429 --> 01:43:53.860
