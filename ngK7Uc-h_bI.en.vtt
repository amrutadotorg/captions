1984-0708 Public Program 1 at Ilford Town Hall. Ilford (England), To Know The Truth

00:00.000 --> 00:06.892
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:07.000 --> 00:19.892
In the previous two lectures I told you how to understand the experience of truth.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.892
In the first one, we came to the conclusion that if we have to feel the truth,

00:29.000 --> 00:38.892
it’s not our only mental acceptance that it is truth, or our mental projection that it is truth,

00:39.000 --> 00:48.892
but you have to feel it on your central nervous system.

00:49.000 --> 01:02.892
In the second lecture I told you that when you feel the truth through your central nervous system

01:03.000 --> 01:13.892
in your evolutionary process, then you become something.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.892
You become, you become is the point. Is not that you think you are like this or like that,

01:22.000 --> 01:37.892
but you really become something. Like a flower becomes a fruit or an egg becomes a chick.

01:38.000 --> 01:47.892
You have to become something in your awareness, and this new awareness is the awareness of collective consciousness.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.892
Where you can feel yourself, what’s the problem with you and you can feel others, on your fingertips.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.892
This is a very good English idiom they use, on your fingertips.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.892
I mean somebody must have thought of Sahaja Yoga when they formed this I am sure.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.892
To use this, you should know it on your fingertips.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.892
Now what does that mean? We have never thought of it, we always say so, we should know them on our fingertips,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.892
but actually you feel them on your fingertips.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.892
The different centres within you and the centres in other people.

02:29.000 --> 02:39.892
As hot or cold, may be as heavy, burning; this you just feel it. You can feel it, others can feel it,

02:40.000 --> 02:48.892
children can feel it and everybody feels the same, because truth is absolute and is for everyone.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.892
Whether you have a different caste, community, race, religion, nationality,

02:57.000 --> 03:03.892
all kinds of superficial things, which divides human beings, everyone feels the same.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.892
For example, supposing you put a finger to this, (Candle flame) you are going to feel hot.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.892
Because you have a different hair style, you are not going to feel something different,

03:16.000 --> 03:23.892
it’s like that. Truth has to be that way, and that is what is the experience of truth.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.892
And once you know you have to know the truth and nothing else but the truth.

03:29.000 --> 03:38.892
When you decide in your mind and be honest about it then when you see it, it is very obvious.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.892
It has to be obvious, it cannot be secretive. It cannot be, it has to be obvious, apparent,

03:47.000 --> 03:51.892
absolutely known to your central nervous system.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.892
So you know the absolute as I told you. Like a computer you start working, you ask any questions,

04:00.000 --> 04:08.892
absolute questions and the answers come to you, as cool vibrations for yes and as hot vibrations for no

04:09.000 --> 04:16.892
and sometimes the vibrations stops to say that absolutely no.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.892
But it can be some blister sometimes a little bit, to say that it’s satanic.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.892
And you can decode it yourself and see for yourself.

04:26.000 --> 04:38.892
This is the second phase where you start knowing about others and knowing about yourself.

04:39.000 --> 04:47.892
So you become connected with the Absolute. Absolute, means there is no question about it,

04:48.000 --> 04:59.892
absolute means there is no doubt about it, absolute means it is single.

05:00.000 --> 05:09.892
Today I have to tell you about what actually happens when this force called Kundalini within you

05:10.000 --> 05:20.892
rises and gives you self-realization. Actually within your self what should happen?

05:21.000 --> 05:29.892
Nobody tells you these things, I mean, they’ll say you are to be reborn, so you have a sort of a certificate,

05:30.000 --> 05:38.892
twice born, reborn and you go about, when it’s not like that.

05:39.000 --> 05:48.892
Supposing a monkey puts a sign-board on, “I am a human being”, does he become?

05:49.000 --> 05:52.892
If we just say we are this, we are that, you are not.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.892
For example we say we are Muslims, we are Christians, we are Hindus, we are not.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.892
Because you have formed a group, you call yourself something, or something that you are not.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.892
It’s just your own idea. How are you a Hindu? How are you a Christian?

06:14.000 --> 06:21.892
What all these religions have said that you have to be born again.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.892
Every religion, Jews have in a way said it too,

06:29.000 --> 06:40.892
but the problem is that we don’t do what is told to us, we just form a group.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.892
Group can be made out of anything nonsensical like, I met some other people the other day

06:46.000 --> 06:50.892
and they told Me our group is called as Knives and Fork.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.892
I said “What’s that group?” Knives and Forks, yes very good group,

06:55.000 --> 07:02.892
so I said, “What is that?” “Because we put our knives and forks in a different way than others.”

07:03.000 --> 07:09.892
I said ” But what’s the use?” “No, we form a very strong group.” “For what?”

07:10.000 --> 07:12.892
“We can form a political party tomorrow.”

07:13.000 --> 07:16.892
I said, “All right, go ahead with this kind of a nonsense”,

07:17.000 --> 07:24.892
But it is nonsense, all this is nonsense. What is sensible is that

07:25.000 --> 07:29.892
we have to become something more than what we are. We are human beings,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.892
we have to become more knowledgeable, we have to become the knowledge.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.892
That knowledge you cannot get in the libraries or from the books.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.892
How do you grow into that knowledge is through this Kundalini awakening,

07:45.000 --> 07:49.892
through this happening that, this Kundalini rises within you

07:50.000 --> 07:57.892
and pierces through your fontanel bone area giving you the real baptism and not the artificial one.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.892
The reality again. Supposing somebody doesn’t get it, all right, so he comes back on Me,

08:06.000 --> 08:13.892
“Oh I never got it Mother”. Something wrong, he should get it, should get it.

08:14.000 --> 08:22.892
Because we cannot give you a false certificate, you cannot give yourself a false certificate.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.892
But it is very common as you see in this world, that when you listen to people who are religious,

08:32.000 --> 08:39.892
you find they are horribly fanatic, funny, stupid people.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.892
I mean if you want to hear about each one of them you should go to the opposite party.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.892
Like if you want to hear about Hindus go to Muslims.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.892
If you want to hear about the Muslims go to Jews and

08:58.000 --> 09:04.892
if you want to hear about Jews go to say Muslims or anyone, Christians, and they’ll tell you.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.892
So there’s nothing universal opinion about things.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.892
It is surprising for a person who wants to see the truth in every religion,

09:16.000 --> 09:21.892
he cannot understand why people belonging to religion, when God is only one,

09:22.000 --> 09:31.892
why there’s a fight going on. Why this world is divided by, even religious leaders are dividing the world.

09:32.000 --> 09:42.892
It is very amazing. So where is this religion? And what happens to our religion?

09:43.000 --> 09:54.892
When we get our self-realization, we become the Self, the Spirit and the Spirit is untarnishable.

09:55.000 --> 10:03.892
It’s untarnishable. You cannot cleanse the soap, can you?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.892
But the quality of Spirit is that it cleanses you. First is it cleanses you.

10:08.000 --> 10:15.892
Just like a Mother lovingly cleanses the child who has fallen somewhere in the road

10:16.000 --> 10:22.892
and cleanses the clothes and makes the child absolutely neat, tidy, clean

10:23.000 --> 10:25.892
and with great admiration looks at the child;

10:26.000 --> 10:35.892
in the same way the Spirit bathes you with it’s beautiful blessings so that you cleanse.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.892
And the second thing it does is to give you light.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.892
Now the light doesn’t mean electrical light, it doesn’t mean the light you see inside.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.892
What does this light means is your awareness itself.

10:54.000 --> 11:04.892
Your awareness itself becomes a higher awareness by which you start seeing things clear cut.

11:05.000 --> 11:12.892
Like I know somebody who came to see Me before Sahaja Yoga

11:13.000 --> 11:19.892
and he met Me after say a month, he was a changed man, I could not recognize him.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.892
So I said what has happened to him? He came to Me I asked him,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.892
”How are you?” He said “Mother I am fine.”

11:30.000 --> 11:38.892
He used to look very old and haggard and absolutely frustrated. I said “What has happened?”

11:39.000 --> 11:47.892
He said “Mother you know, when I got realisation, suddenly I felt tremendous compassion for everyone

11:48.000 --> 11:55.892
and I had an enemy that was my uncle and I hated him from the bottom of my heart,

11:56.000 --> 12:02.892
and I used to think he has killed my mother, and I could not believe that he has not killed my mother,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.892
so many people told me but still with the hatred I could not get over it.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.892
I had insulted him, he had insulted me and if somebody had given me freedom with

12:11.000 --> 12:16.892
a dagger I would have gone and killed him. I hated him from the bottom of my heart.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.892
And all the time I thought of killing him, doing this and all the nasty things I could think of.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.892
My whole mind was pre-occupied.” “So what happened?” He said,

12:30.000 --> 12:36.892
“Next day I started seeing his good points, I said no he is a very generous man.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.892
I have been nastier that he has been, suddenly I started feeling it, that feeling of love,

12:44.000 --> 12:49.892
compassion and when I said uncle, I forgive you completely,

12:50.000 --> 12:55.892
the blissfulness crawled upon me, that’s the first time I’ve felt the joy of my spirit.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.892
I had said this before also but I had never felt it,

13:00.000 --> 13:06.892
but first time when I said this I felt it and that bliss was so great and that joy was so great

13:07.000 --> 13:09.892
I said now I must have it at any cost.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.892
So next day I saw him at a race, he was a great race goer also, a very rich man.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.892
I saw him and I just embraced him. I couldn’t help it. He was surprised, he looked at me,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.892
he said come and have tea with me, and we are great friends now.”

13:30.000 --> 13:36.892
So all that wrinkle, all that horrible anger and all that has gone away

13:37.000 --> 13:42.892
and this divine, serene face was showing its beauty there.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.892
But he said “I have done this before, I’ve tried to forgive him, I told myself,

13:49.000 --> 13:53.892
I told many a times that he’s not killed my mother, I should not hate him.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.892
I tried to convince myself, but still I could not forgive, I didn’t have the power to forgive.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.892
But when I got my self-realization, suddenly the power came to me,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.892
in such a gush. I have become powerful Mother.”

14:10.000 --> 14:14.892
In the Sanskrit language it’s called the word Samarth,

14:15.000 --> 14:22.892
Samarth means powerful but actually means Sama-Artha, it means equal to your meaning.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.892
Equal to your meaning, means you become your Self. Samartha.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.892
When you become yourself, you become powerful to fight your weaknesses

14:34.000 --> 14:48.892
and you automatically do it without any trouble, spontaneously. Very easy it is to forgive.

14:49.000 --> 14:56.892
Not only this, so many things there are which you just do without any difficulty.

14:57.000 --> 15:07.892
It is very difficult before realization for a person to think that to part with your little bit of two P’s that you have,

15:08.000 --> 15:12.892
even that is sometimes difficult. You think ten times, calculate it, all right,

15:13.000 --> 15:19.892
if I give two P’s now how much will I get, three P’s or five P’s, all right

15:20.000 --> 15:29.892
if I get three P’s no good, five P’s is all right; but after realization you just give.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.892
You just give, you like to give, you love to give, you want to enjoy the giving capacity of yourself.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.892
So far the acquiring, acquisition and also the capacity to preserve,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.892
keep everything to yourself becomes a giving capacity.

15:45.000 --> 15:53.892
And as a result of that, what you find, you are filled in.

15:54.000 --> 16:07.892
Every sort of thing, every sort of material or physical or anything that is needed to make you happy

16:08.000 --> 16:13.892
just comes down. From where, how, God alone knows because it’s only God does the job,

16:14.000 --> 16:26.892
it’s God’s work. So the power to stand up against evil, against injustice,

16:27.000 --> 16:35.892
against wrong doing just changes your priorities completely

16:36.000 --> 16:44.892
and you become a powerful personality. Like Christ when He saw the prostitute,

16:45.000 --> 16:52.892
Mary Magdalene, being stoned, He saw the disciple Mary Magdalene in her.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.892
He stood up and He said, “Those who have not sinned can throw stones at Me.”

16:59.000 --> 17:04.892
That character, that strength that stood up there,

17:05.000 --> 17:11.892
and nobody could even think of throwing stones at Him.

17:12.000 --> 17:19.892
This powerful personality which is compassion, which is righteous, which is virtuous,

17:20.000 --> 17:30.892
starts shining through you. It’s not a quarrelsome dominating power in which we believe.

17:31.000 --> 17:38.892
According to us a powerful man is the one who can dominate the whole world.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.892
The power of love we have never exploited, never.

17:44.000 --> 17:51.892
All our enterprises, all our worldly affairs, political, economic, are based on hatred.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.892
The power of love in it’s purest from is the most powerful thing

17:59.000 --> 18:04.892
and that is going to emancipate the whole universe. There’s no other way out.

18:05.000 --> 18:11.892
It doesn’t mean your carnal love or your nonsensical ideas of love, it’s not, it’s pure love.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.892
The pure love is that kind where the sap rises in a tree

18:17.000 --> 18:25.892
and gives nourishment to all the parts of the tree and goes back. It’s not attached.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.892
If it gets attached to one flower, the tree will die, the flower will die.

18:32.000 --> 18:39.892
So this is the power which empowers you, nourishes you, soothes you,

18:40.000 --> 18:50.892
consoles you, relaxes you and leaves you powerful.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.892
That sort of a power is to be felt if it is the experience of truth.

18:57.000 --> 19:05.892
But we have never tried to understand love in its own truth.

19:06.000 --> 19:13.892
The reason is we were not realized people. When we are blind, we are mixed up.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.892
We can’t make out one from another but when our eyes are opened out

19:20.000 --> 19:27.892
we understand the true love. And this is what people have exploited, many of them,

19:28.000 --> 19:32.892
many so called gurus and these people who talk of God have exploited

19:33.000 --> 19:40.892
this side of love by teaching dirty things to people, debasing them, using their weaknesses.

19:41.000 --> 19:48.892
Saying that if you do this kind of a weakness, then you will reach God.

19:49.000 --> 20:02.892
Love that makes you a slave cannot be love and that is what it is, the love that is divine,

20:03.000 --> 20:10.892
is the love of God that starts flowing through you, you become the medium, as you call it,

20:11.000 --> 20:17.892
of that love. A powerful medium. But you know how to manoeuvre it.

20:18.000 --> 20:26.892
You know everything. It’s not blindly, I have seen some people, oh we are in love, you see going on like that, no.

20:27.000 --> 20:36.892
You know everyone. You know ins and outs of everyone and of yourself also.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.892
I have seen many people coming to Me and saying, “Mother please save me from this Agnya.”

20:43.000 --> 20:48.892
Now in our language it is this Agnya, but actually it means ego.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.892
You can see your ego clearly once you get realization and we say oh God what is this?

20:55.000 --> 21:01.892
That’s not me, I am not ego, oh that’s not me, I am the Self, I am the Spirit.

21:02.000 --> 21:09.892
So this separation takes place within yourself, with your own understanding that,

21:10.000 --> 21:20.892
you are not this body, this mind, this ego, this superego but you are the spirit.

21:21.000 --> 21:30.892
And the more you grow into it, a beautiful personality of a character, which is not a character,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.892
sometimes people think if you are very meek, is he compromising,

21:35.000 --> 21:39.892
such a character will never compromise, is a terrific character.

21:40.000 --> 21:47.892
It would never compromise with anything that is not the truth. It cannot by temperament.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.892
But is very kind and compassionate, forgiving.

21:53.000 --> 22:01.892
Gives lots of chances because there’s that inner urge to save others, to save others,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.892
to help others, to get them to the right thing.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.892
It’s like people who are standing on the brink of a disaster,

22:10.000 --> 22:15.892
or people who are on the bank and see the people getting drowned and trying to pull them out

22:16.000 --> 22:24.892
with all their effort. But they don’t want to compromise as to jump or to leave the banks that they have got.

22:25.000 --> 22:32.892
Such a character you develop then and this character is felt by everyone.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.892
I have known many Sahaja Yogis first who came to Sahaja Yoga,

22:39.000 --> 22:45.892
their own family people were angry. Now you are following another Guru,

22:46.000 --> 22:54.892
this is another cult, this is that. But then they found out that they are giving no money, nothing,

22:55.000 --> 23:03.892
and they are flowering. In every way they are beautiful, they are becoming better and better people.

23:04.000 --> 23:10.892
Righteous and virtuous people, powerful people of great character

23:11.000 --> 23:15.892
and they are amazed you know. How do they become?

23:16.000 --> 23:23.892
And they become very intelligent, they don’t do any stupid things, they just don’t do it.

23:24.000 --> 23:29.892
Even a little child knows it’s stupid. They don’t do stupid things.

23:30.000 --> 23:39.892
They don’t do nonsensical things. They are dignified and they don’t take to cheap entertainments.

23:40.000 --> 23:49.892
The depth that you feel in the poets, in the great musicians, becomes their own nature.

23:50.000 --> 24:02.892
When they talk, when they walk, any rapport with them, you can feel the depth of their spirit.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.892
They become very knowledgeable suddenly. As I told you last time these journalists asked Me

24:09.000 --> 24:12.892
“Mother have you got all scholars?” I said “Scholars, what.”

24:13.000 --> 24:17.892
“All scholars are Sahaja Yogis,” I said “No, at the most one percent may be,

24:18.000 --> 24:24.892
who have been great headaches to me, the rest of them are simple people.”

24:25.000 --> 24:32.892
Simple people are the best and this is what is true,

24:33.000 --> 24:42.892
that those who get realization start feeling the knowledge which is absolute.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.892
Seeing the knowledge, knowing the knowledge.

24:47.000 --> 24:55.892
Like if you see, say, this pillar, you just look at it, you say, oh very nicely done painted this,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.892
somebody might say it should not have been this color, that color.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.892
But a Sahaja Yogi doesn’t see this pillar as to how aesthetically it is and all that,

25:07.000 --> 25:15.892
but immediately he’ll say it’s beautiful. You’ll say why? It gives vibrations.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.892
The whole aesthetics are worked out through vibrations.

25:21.000 --> 25:29.892
All the beautiful things, as I told you last time, of the world have vibrations.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.892
Real beautiful things have vibrations. Like Mona Lisa I told you the other day,

25:35.000 --> 25:38.892
if you go and feel her vibrations, she has vibrations.

25:39.000 --> 25:50.892
Now the one who has made her has put his joy into her and she emits vibrations.

25:51.000 --> 26:02.892
And that is the thing that gives joy to you because you are at a level where you can feel those vibrations.

26:03.000 --> 26:12.892
You start feeling the physical side of yours, you understand you have a physical problem.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.892
Immediately you know you have a physical problem, you know where it is,

26:16.000 --> 26:20.892
how to correct it, how to cure it. I have seen many people who come to me,

26:21.000 --> 26:26.892
Mother cure my cancer, but they don’t come to Me before they get cancer.

26:27.000 --> 26:33.892
If they had come they would never have got it, but they had no time, at that time they had no time.

26:34.000 --> 26:41.892
But when they get cancer I have no time either. It happens always.

26:42.000 --> 26:51.892
Of course they are to be helped, cured, but why not come as a prevention to all those diseases

26:52.000 --> 27:10.892
which has no meaning. It is unnecessarily so much accepted that health is first of all.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.892
Then there is nothing to worry about health if you come to Sahaja Yoga,

27:15.000 --> 27:19.892
you don’t need any doctor, sorry for the doctors, I am sorry.

27:26.000 --> 27:33.892
And this is what it is to be understood that physically you feel absolutely fit.

27:34.000 --> 27:40.892
You look fit absolutely. You look marvellous.

27:41.000 --> 27:56.892
Then when you start expanding yourself you start feeling your own mind.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.892
The peace, the bliss of your own mind.

28:01.000 --> 28:07.892
Many a times you’ll find there is no thought but the joy is just bursting in

28:08.000 --> 28:15.892
and you just think why it has happened. Suddenly, how do I get this?

28:16.000 --> 28:28.892
Gradually the state of joy starts increasing in its frequency and you become joy.

28:29.000 --> 28:37.892
That is, one has to achieve, to become the joy is important.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.892
And once you become that joy it’s not a duality, it’s not a duality.

28:45.000 --> 28:52.892
It’s not a thing in which you feel the happiness and unhappiness but you feel the joy.

28:53.000 --> 29:03.892
Joy is a witness, it’s a kind of a power of a witness which sees a drama,

29:04.000 --> 29:12.892
by seeing the drama, whether tragedy or comedy, it’s at a point where it is just a witness and enjoying it.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.892
In the same way you’ll see so called comedies and tragedies of your life

29:18.000 --> 29:24.892
and the futility of your nonsensical endeavours and you’ll laugh at it, oh that’s it, that’s me.

29:25.000 --> 29:32.892
For example in Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare has tried to show the futility of all those egos.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.892
According to Indian standards he was Avadhotta, as they call it, a person who was realised

29:40.000 --> 29:46.892
and was a very evolved personality. And if you want to see how Romeo should get his realization

29:47.000 --> 29:51.892
and how he should feel that after all that happened he should laugh loudly.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.892
She gets realisation, oh what a fool a stupid thing I was.

29:59.000 --> 30:06.892
Shakespeare did not show him getting realization he kept it for us Sahaja Yogis to see it,

30:07.000 --> 30:12.892
but should have seen to it that Romeo laughs at himself and makes fun of himself,

30:13.000 --> 30:19.892
oh stupid Mr. Romeo, now you better settle down.

30:20.000 --> 30:26.892
But he showed and very cleverly if you see in all his Macbeth or any of his dramas

30:27.000 --> 30:31.892
that he has tried to show the futility of our ego, our enterprises,

30:32.000 --> 30:39.892
we think that is very important in life.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.892
I would say there are so many great writers in English language,

30:43.000 --> 30:46.892
which I cannot name them in a series, but I have read them.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.892
Somerset Maugham, I would say was another one. I was very much impressed by his writings

30:53.000 --> 30:58.892
and read most of his novels because he was very much there.

30:59.000 --> 31:06.892
Cronin for example is another one I would say who wrote Citadel was another great person who

31:07.000 --> 31:16.892
could see the drama of stupidity. Leave alone your great poets like William Blake and all those.

31:17.000 --> 31:26.892
But all that was to show that there is a higher being you see, which sees all this,

31:27.000 --> 31:31.892
and giving you a drama of yourself, projecting it through you.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.892
That this is what you are, you see, see yourself.

31:37.000 --> 31:48.892
That’s what they did and despite everything we’re lost. We are lost quite a lot.

31:49.000 --> 31:55.892
We have to become the same like Shakespeare to see the drama,

31:56.000 --> 32:00.892
like Somerset Maugham, we have to become the same.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.892
To see the drama, we may not write a book, doesn’t matter,

32:04.000 --> 32:10.892
but the capacity to see the drama, that’s what we develop.

32:11.000 --> 32:17.892
We need not write, we may not have the flare of a pen to write but we see it the same way as they see it

32:18.000 --> 32:24.892
and that’s the mental capacity to which we rise with self-realization.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.892
I have seen very stupid people absolutely calling themselves gurus,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.892
you look at them and you don’t know what to say, you see.

32:33.000 --> 32:40.892
You have to look at stupider persons to stupider, that person, what you say, stupidest person,

32:41.000 --> 32:45.892
in the presence of such a person, because he looks at you, you see,

32:46.000 --> 32:49.892
and you understand he is stupid and you don’t know what to do.

32:50.000 --> 32:56.892
And you get frightened of such a person you know and you don’t want to hurt his feelings you see,

32:57.000 --> 33:02.892
so you look the greater stupid person and then he gives you a big lecture,

33:03.000 --> 33:09.892
on something very stupid. But then you find that person you see,

33:10.000 --> 33:16.892
big newspapers you see like Times, publishing such a stupid man there.

33:17.000 --> 33:23.892
Just imagine, this is what we have done to Shakespeare, to all our great writers and everyone,

33:24.000 --> 33:29.892
we have reached that state that we cannot even see the stupidity.

33:36.000 --> 33:43.892
Our brain is stunned because we have been asking for sensations,

33:44.000 --> 33:49.892
with all these electrical sensations in the brain we are stunned.

33:50.000 --> 34:01.892
Which opens out, which completely opens out and you start seeing, through and through,

34:02.000 --> 34:10.892
the mockery of all this kind of seriousness and the hypocrisy

34:11.000 --> 34:19.892
and the way people who are stupid try to give you stupid ideas.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.892
And once you are realised you laugh at yourself,

34:23.000 --> 34:29.892
oh God I was so stupid, that’s what should happen.

34:30.000 --> 34:39.892
If that does not happen your self-realization has no meaning, it has no meaning.

34:40.000 --> 34:46.892
The righteousness and the virtues become part and parcel of your being.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.892
It’s not that you have to be told anything, you just shouldn’t do it.

34:51.000 --> 34:58.892
It’s beyond your self respect because you respect your Self, you respect your Spirit.

34:59.000 --> 35:06.892
How can you do such a thing? You cannot despise yourself can you?

35:07.000 --> 35:12.892
You just become virtuous. You may be kind to others even if they are not virtuous,

35:13.000 --> 35:18.892
you can be nice to them, you can forgive them but as far as you are concerned there is no compromise.

35:19.000 --> 35:26.892
And you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy your magnanimity, you enjoy your generosity.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.892
People will tell you, stupid fool, you go on distributing things what are you doing?

35:31.000 --> 35:40.892
And you laugh at them. As Lao Tse said, somebody told Me this saying about Lao Tse,

35:41.000 --> 35:46.892
another great incarnation of the primordial master,

35:47.000 --> 35:54.892
that when a wise sees the way, he respects it and says this is the way.

35:55.000 --> 36:03.892
That’s the sign of a wise man and a mediocre who is half way this way and that way

36:04.000 --> 36:10.892
when he sees the way he waits for others to go into it,

36:11.000 --> 36:17.892
and when the stupid sees the way he laughs.

36:18.000 --> 36:26.892
But when the wise sees the stupid in himself he laughs.

36:27.000 --> 36:41.892
So that power of wisdom starts shinning through you, you become a wise, righteous, virtuous man.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.892
And such a balance you develop. I have known people who are honest, you see, so called,

36:49.000 --> 36:54.892
now they go to such an extreme of honesty, that for honesty’s sake they’ll kill their father,

36:55.000 --> 36:58.892
kill their mother, kill everyone.

36:59.000 --> 37:03.892
But such a balanced and integrated person you become

37:04.000 --> 37:12.892
that whatever you do is good for your spirit and for the spirit of others.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.892
In Sanskrit the word is Haitha [BEST GUESS],

37:16.000 --> 37:22.892
what ever is good for your spirit and for the spirit of others you do it.

37:23.000 --> 37:31.892
And that is the right thing to do, and that’s how you become a righteous personality.

37:32.000 --> 37:39.892
That’s the religion within you that gets awakened. Nobody has to tell you your religion,

37:40.000 --> 37:46.892
you yourself become your own master, your own Guru, and by which you determine yourself,

37:47.000 --> 37:58.892
now Mr. you can’t do this. No you can’t. So you become your own police commissioner.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.892
You don’t need any outsider to tell you.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.892
You are on your own guard because if you do something like that your vibrations will disappear

38:09.000 --> 38:15.892
and then you don’t like it, don’t like it. Then you feel uneasy.

38:16.000 --> 38:24.892
Nobody has to have you as a Guru, there’s no need you become your own Guru, is the best way.

38:25.000 --> 38:37.892
And that’s how you solve the problem of becoming better by others,

38:38.000 --> 38:49.892
is very difficult but yourself becoming better, by your own understanding and urges,

38:50.000 --> 38:59.892
it’s a thousand fold happier and strong.

39:00.000 --> 39:12.892
So the third thing that happens to you, that you become religious, you become the Guru, yourself.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.892
Nobody has to tell you because there is a natural valency of ten within you

39:19.000 --> 39:24.892
which starts balancing you, and you become one and enjoy that balance.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.892
As you enjoy a balance of colors in a beautiful photograph,

39:30.000 --> 39:33.892
in the same way you enjoy the balance within yourself. You enjoy your personality,

39:34.000 --> 39:40.892
you enjoy your being and you enjoy to be the Self.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.892
And those who are on the same level, you just enjoy each other.

39:46.000 --> 39:54.892
This is the first time you enjoy other human being, as if you are enjoying a flower.

39:55.000 --> 40:05.892
The fragrance of that personality is spiritual fragrance, is so beautiful and attractive.

40:06.000 --> 40:17.892
Without any lust and greed in it but just enjoying the company is real perfect bliss.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.892
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

40:22.000 --> 40:22.000
END
