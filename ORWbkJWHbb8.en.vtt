WEBVTT

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.490
Today we are going to worship the Hamsa Chakra.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:50.731
So far we have been always worshipping a Deity
and this is the second time you are worshipping

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:54.160
this centre of Hamsa.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:10.071
Now this chakra is, it is, you know, placed
between the two eyebrows and two eyes represent

00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:17.060
the left and the right side.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:35.711
So this centre is very much guided by our
eyes, by our ears, by our nose, tongue, teeth,

00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:37.981
throat.

00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:47.541
Is a very important centre because the Vishuddhi,
which has to look after sixteen petals, which,

00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:56.461
sixteen petals, which look after all these
ear, nose, throat, different, different organs

00:04:56.461 --> 00:05:04.851
within us, also it has to communicate with
the Viraat.

00:05:04.851 --> 00:05:13.421
So it has to pass through this centre of Hamsa
Chakra.

00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:35.441
Hamsa Chakra is the very pivotal centre, which
expresses auspiciousness in our awareness.

00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:44.720
That means, if this centre is alert and awakened,
then we immediately know what is auspicious

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.951
and what is not auspicious, or we can call
it, we get the Divine Discretion.

00:05:51.951 --> 00:06:12.681
I think it is a part of the genetics that
people have discretion between good and bad,

00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:17.461
destructive and constructive.

00:06:17.461 --> 00:06:33.711
It is basically, has to be there, but we can
easily spoil it by all these organs which

00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:41.141
are collecting the conditionings and the ego
from outside.

00:06:41.141 --> 00:06:47.000
That’s why this centre is very vulnerable.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.791
Other centres are not so much connected outside
as this centre is connected, and receives

00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:57.990
all the information from, all these organs.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.021
For example, the eyes, now, we have.

00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:12.430
Eyes are very important because, they say
it, this is the window of the Spirit.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:19.761
And you have seen that when Kundalini rises,
and Spirit starts shining, there is a dilatation

00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:25.781
of the pupils and you look like an innocent
child and there’s a twinkle in your eyes.

00:07:25.781 --> 00:07:36.101
But the way that we play with our eyes all
the time, the way we use it indiscreetly with

00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:44.680
our lust and greed we can spoil this centre
very badly.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:08:00.691
Once we start taking to destructive things
in our life, we immediately become akin, or

00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:09.161
we start accepting, whatever is wrong, whatever
is destructive, very easily.

00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:17.381
I feel this is some sort of a genetic defect
because, in certain people, they will not

00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:23.700
accept anything that is stupid, idiotic or
destructive.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:33.011
But in certain people they’re very prone
and very easily can be taken to things which

00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:40.971
are absurd, which are stupid and which are
definitely destructive.

00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:53.561
This can become a very collective acceptance
also and once it becomes a collective acceptance,

00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:57.080
it starts penetrating throughout.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:04.520
It does not only have the effect of absorption,
but also it has an effect of affecting other

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.321
things.

00:09:06.321 --> 00:09:15.251
Say a person whose eyes are what we call flirtish
or roving eyes, such a person, if he goes

00:09:15.251 --> 00:09:21.050
to one group of people who do not know what
flirting is, do not know what roving eyes

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:31.610
is, with very steady eyes, he can influence
those people and can make some of them of

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.561
the same kind.

00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:45.930
So what happens, really, is this, that, this
is a very good door for all kinds of bhoots

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:56.640
to enter, entities to enter, and when you
start projecting it back, the same bhoots

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:08.360
can pass into another person and can create
the same kind of vacuum or same kind of vulnerability

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:17.570
in the Hamsa Chakra of other people.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:25.580
So that’s why eyes have to be very, very
clean, innocent.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:34.131
Another, you can see, is what you hear.

00:10:34.131 --> 00:10:39.640
Some people, if they hear something nonsensical,
they’ll just put their hands to their ears.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.490
They don’t want to hear anything.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:52.020
But there are some people who like it and
go on enjoying it.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:59.761
Ultimately, they become servile or, we can
say, conditioned, that they like all these

00:10:59.761 --> 00:11:08.050
horrible things that normally a human being
won’t like.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:17.231
Now, also you must have seen that people who,
like French people, I think they have no discretion

00:11:17.231 --> 00:11:18.231
of smell.

00:11:18.231 --> 00:11:29.181
They smell so awful, but they eat all rotten
food, rotten cheese, rotten, absolutely rotten

00:11:29.181 --> 00:11:33.361
wines, but they never smell it.

00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:34.931
Anybody in their company can smell it.

00:11:34.931 --> 00:11:39.381
Even their hands smell of their rotten cheese,
you can’t just [bare to] smell it.

00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:41.991
But they have lost the power.

00:11:41.991 --> 00:11:48.501
In the same way, in our country we have a
caste called sweepers who do all the cleaning

00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:51.161
of dirty things with their hands.

00:11:51.161 --> 00:11:53.451
They have no sense of smell.

00:11:53.451 --> 00:11:55.561
They have lost the sense of smell.

00:11:55.561 --> 00:11:58.201
The nose has lost that smell sense.

00:11:58.201 --> 00:12:01.901
They cannot smell anything dirty.

00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:05.470
That’s how they can do their work.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:14.441
So if you start also not being alert to fragrance
– I’ve seen also there are certain things

00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:27.381
people use made of tobacco, they are supposed
to be very good, very famous brands of perfumes

00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:32.770
like ‘Tabac’ and all that.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:38.391
So once they start liking that kind of a thing,
then they have other things like ‘Poison‘

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:43.441
and other horrible things, which, it’s horrible
smell in it.

00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:49.460
Apart from that, first [thing] you smell is
alcohol, is a spirit!

00:12:49.460 --> 00:13:01.031
But they don’t mind because they see in
that a very congenial type of a pleasure.

00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:06.881
But these pleasures, ultimately, can kill
all the cells of the nose and afterwards one

00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:10.511
may even lose the sense of smell.

00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:15.591
One of the joy-giving organ is the sense of
smell.

00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:21.131
When the Kundalini rises in many people they
get a fragrance of many things.

00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:28.611
Some people get of guggul or sometimes they
get a fragrance of sandalwood or something,

00:13:28.611 --> 00:13:36.520
which is a very natural essence of flowers
or maybe of some woods.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:49.821
But these unnaturally made things which are
actually destructive to your cells of smelling,

00:13:49.821 --> 00:13:55.881
that is what they start using, and once you
start using these kind of things then what

00:13:55.881 --> 00:14:00.960
happens is that you don’t feel any bad smell
anywhere, like animals.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.701
But so many animals can smell, if not they
don’t call it bad or good, but they can

00:14:05.701 --> 00:14:08.721
smell.

00:14:08.721 --> 00:14:15.111
Even that sensitivity of good and bad smell
which we human beings have got is lost.

00:14:15.111 --> 00:14:22.910
So whatever is our ascent, as human beings,
at what a level we have gone, start completely

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:27.721
disappearing, gradually, one by one.

00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:30.571
Then same with the throat.

00:14:30.571 --> 00:14:50.270
If the throat is using bad languages and is
being used for abusing people, showing temper

00:14:50.270 --> 00:15:03.011
on people or anything of aggression or sometimes
people take things which can also spoil the

00:15:03.011 --> 00:15:16.100
throat by their destructive qualities, like
alcohol; specially the smoking.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:23.150
If you smoke then the throat gets vulnerable
and the sweetness of your voice is lost.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.361
Then they speak with a hoarse voice.

00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:30.040
But this is all external.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.921
It starts becoming external.

00:15:32.921 --> 00:15:44.621
Mouth smells with that and also the teeth
react to all such things, which we take without

00:15:44.621 --> 00:15:50.622
discretion about it, because that’s the
fashion, because it is marketing well, because

00:15:50.622 --> 00:15:52.951
it is advertised!

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:59.241
That means we have not got our own wisdom,
our own personality.

00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:07.150
But when this centre is awakened, then what
you develop is a discretion.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:17.391
As I was telling them yesterday how the word
Hamsa has come for this centre.

00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:25.391
Because there’s a Sanskrit, very beautiful,
couplet, which says that a swan is white and

00:16:25.391 --> 00:16:28.561
a crane is a white bird.

00:16:28.561 --> 00:16:35.521
What is the difference between the swan and
a crane?

00:16:35.521 --> 00:16:43.321
The answer is that when you mix milk with
water, the swan will just suck in the milk

00:16:43.321 --> 00:16:53.241
while the crane has no discretion, no vivek.

00:16:53.241 --> 00:17:04.181
This discretionary power, once we start losing,
we start becoming just like robots, I would

00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:07.790
say, because we have no personality.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:14.970
Anybody can brainwash us and the more they
tell us about our discretion we listen to

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:15.970
them.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:22.121
That explains why people, so many thousands
of people, go to all these false gurus.

00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:28.191
Thousands of people, why did they take to
homosexuality and got into AIDS?

00:17:28.191 --> 00:17:37.271
Why thousands of people have taken to drugs?

00:17:37.271 --> 00:17:39.890
It is unbelievable!

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.131
Incredible!

00:17:42.131 --> 00:17:46.741
Why people have taken to all these things
[and] are destroying their life.

00:17:46.741 --> 00:17:52.410
They see a man going into the pub, coming
out and falling down on the ground with all

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.931
his purse being emptied.

00:17:54.931 --> 00:17:59.700
But they go with the purse, see that they
have sufficient money to go inside the pub,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.821
again come out to fall down on the street.

00:18:02.821 --> 00:18:13.311
Whatever idiotic or nonsensical [things] other
people are doing, when you see they’re idiotic,

00:18:13.311 --> 00:18:17.431
you pay money to become idiotic.

00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:24.621
One pays money to destroy oneself, go out
of the way.

00:18:24.621 --> 00:18:28.381
It is so unnatural for anyone.

00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:35.391
I mean even a dog or a cat, or any animal,
knows where is the danger is.

00:18:35.391 --> 00:18:41.330
They can smell the danger and they run away
because they have to preserve their lives.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:48.150
They think their lives are precious and they
must live and live well.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:56.221
But this ordinary, common sense starts missing
and they will say, “What’s wrong?

00:18:56.221 --> 00:18:58.311
What’s wrong in this?

00:18:58.311 --> 00:19:00.931
What’s wrong in that?”

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:05.491
That means the genetics of the Hamsa are missing.

00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:18.441
Now you should see there is no Deity on the
Hamsa Chakra, but it is the formless energy

00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:39.051
of so many organs which are looked after by
Buddha, Mahavira, Christ, Shri Krishna – four

00:19:39.051 --> 00:19:44.821
of them, managed by Shri Ganesha.

00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:51.691
So these genetics are put by Shri Ganesha
because He is the source of the Wisdom.

00:19:51.691 --> 00:20:02.521
So first, once they spoil their Mooladhara,
the wisdom is finished: [the] basis, the fundamentals,

00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:04.001
are finished.

00:20:04.001 --> 00:20:17.501
That’s why immoral life is very detrimental
to our life because we lose our discretion,

00:20:17.501 --> 00:20:20.371
the discretion is lost.

00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:34.901
Then if you can awaken Shri Ganesha in the
Hamsa Chakra, then suddenly you belong to

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:38.611
the higher race of Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:40.641
It’s surprising.

00:20:40.641 --> 00:20:48.351
I’ve seen people overnight give up their
drugs, very immoral people become extremely

00:20:48.351 --> 00:20:58.670
moral because of this chakra being suddenly
awakened and the light of the Spirit is best

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:11.281
expressed through this chakra in everyday
life, in the collective life also.

00:21:11.281 --> 00:21:16.951
One starts then seeing the point, as we say.

00:21:16.951 --> 00:21:21.831
Like now, in Sahaja Yogas, we have different
problems, also.

00:21:21.831 --> 00:21:30.170
Say, when people first come to Sahaja Yoga,
they start watching other people and starting

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:34.471
finding their faults, what’s wrong with
them.

00:21:34.471 --> 00:21:37.560
They never see what they are here for.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:43.991
They are not here to find out faults with
others, but to correct your own defects.

00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:45.810
So they say, “Oh, this man is no good.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:46.861
That man is no good.

00:21:46.861 --> 00:21:47.951
This is wrong.”

00:21:47.951 --> 00:21:50.161
They start creating problems, you see.

00:21:50.161 --> 00:21:54.800
They’ll talk to each other, saying, “Oh
this man is not good.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.701
That man is not good,” try create groups
and things.

00:21:58.701 --> 00:22:03.461
They’re here to offer what?

00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:11.091
Or create a politics or for your ascent?

00:22:11.091 --> 00:22:16.361
Some of them, if they do not do all this,
then they think we should start to make some

00:22:16.361 --> 00:22:30.711
money out of it or some sort of a thing, or
some start criticising others about something,

00:22:30.711 --> 00:22:37.170
which is not their concern.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:42.001
So they forget because they are just now coming
to Sahaja Yoga and their genetics are not

00:22:42.001 --> 00:22:44.440
established of their wisdom.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:53.401
They start worrying about things, which are
not their worry, which they should not bother

00:22:53.401 --> 00:22:57.711
about.

00:22:57.711 --> 00:23:01.091
Then some of them start thinking, “Oh, I
am the leader!”

00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:06.131
or “Why am I not the leader?”

00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:09.361
So they start finding fault with the leadership.

00:23:09.361 --> 00:23:13.801
Sometimes leader also can feel, “Oh, I am
the leader.

00:23:13.801 --> 00:23:21.231
I can be very stern, very disciplinary and
I can control people.

00:23:21.231 --> 00:23:24.211
I can do this.”

00:23:24.211 --> 00:23:35.920
They have come here to learn how to love,
to be compassionate, to be tolerant.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:51.521
The sense of leadership and also of obedience
– both are discretionary.

00:23:51.521 --> 00:24:00.211
If somebody says something to you and if you
obey that person for your benevolence, you

00:24:00.211 --> 00:24:07.050
will subtly understand that it is for your
good.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:13.201
If some leader says that “This is wrong
with you,” try to see if it is wrong, instead

00:24:13.201 --> 00:24:15.381
of feeling hurt about it.

00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:18.081
“Yes, it is wrong with me.

00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:19.151
So what should I do?

00:24:19.151 --> 00:24:20.361
How can I improve myself?”

00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:23.271
Ask the leader or you can write to Me or do
anything.

00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:24.271
But no!

00:24:24.271 --> 00:24:25.271
They will not do it.

00:24:25.271 --> 00:24:28.910
Immediately they will write a letter to Me
saying, “This leader is such-and-such, bad

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:29.910
fellow.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:30.910
He’s so this thing.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:31.930
He ate that money.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.011
He ate that thing!”

00:24:33.011 --> 00:24:36.111
and all kinds of things.

00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:41.211
Or else they may tell people, “Oh, Mother
listens to this fellow.

00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:42.211
He’s no good.

00:24:42.211 --> 00:24:44.341
He’s just telling Mother stories and Mother
listens!”

00:24:44.341 --> 00:24:47.731
Mother is not such a fool.

00:24:47.731 --> 00:24:54.211
She knows about everything.

00:24:54.211 --> 00:25:00.201
So all these things that we have gathered
from our previous life, even after our second

00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:01.810
birth we carry little bit.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:09.320
Like an egg becomes a bird but still lots
of things of the egg are hanging on to his

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.261
body, so you have to cleanse it.

00:25:11.261 --> 00:25:15.841
So, at this point, when you have got your
realisation, the first discretion should be,

00:25:15.841 --> 00:25:22.461
“How am I going to achieve that state of
Spirit?”

00:25:22.461 --> 00:25:24.040
The Pure Spirit!

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:32.621
Instead of that, also, people get lost because
they have no discretion.

00:25:32.621 --> 00:25:42.581
With this enlightenment, first thing that
happens, I’ve seen with people: Their eyes

00:25:42.581 --> 00:25:44.671
are fixed.

00:25:44.671 --> 00:25:47.851
They don’t rove their eyes much now.

00:25:47.851 --> 00:25:53.550
They have very innocent eyes.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:26:00.721
Otherwise they are really mad, those people
who go on looking at everything like this.

00:26:00.721 --> 00:26:03.221
There’s no difference between madman and
him.

00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:09.121
You put one madman, he does the same and a
person who is like that does the same.

00:26:09.121 --> 00:26:18.621
And it’s such a crazy thing to do, but immediately…I
mean, it is such a spontaneous thing.

00:26:18.621 --> 00:26:22.741
It’s like the light coming in the room.

00:26:22.741 --> 00:26:27.680
It is so spontaneous that you start seeing
things clearly – “No, no.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:33.261
This is not good!”

00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:39.261
Before in the garden, you would go and collect
all the thorns and put them in your body.

00:26:39.261 --> 00:26:42.601
That was the situation.

00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:46.201
Never looked at the flowers.

00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:51.631
And suddenly, after realisation, you will
be amazed, you just see flowers and don’t

00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:57.651
bother about thorns, or if you find you take
them out.

00:26:57.651 --> 00:27:07.991
There is joy even before realisation and after
realisation, but there is no capacity to enjoy.

00:27:07.991 --> 00:27:17.560
That capacity comes to you after realisation
and the main thing that happens to you is

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.341
the discretion.

00:27:19.341 --> 00:27:25.471
Then, like the swan, you just take the milk
of everything.

00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:36.981
At everything your attitude becomes very different,
you start seeing things in a different angle.

00:27:36.981 --> 00:27:45.791
Like once we had to go to one very ancient
temple to see some art.

00:27:45.791 --> 00:27:53.131
Me, my son-in-law and my daughter, we were
walking up up, we had to walk for miles, up

00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:58.920
the hill and they were very tired so we went
into one temple and just laid down ourselves.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.280
They were so tired.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.941
At that time I said, “See these elephants,
see how beautiful they are, every one has

00:28:06.941 --> 00:28:18.920
a different type of a tail and a different
type of a trunk, the poses are different.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.021
So many of them are like that.”

00:28:21.021 --> 00:28:22.381
My son-in-law said, “Babaa!

00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:23.871
We are so tired.

00:28:23.871 --> 00:28:27.680
How are you looking at these things?”

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:34.001
Because attention didn’t go to my tiredness
but to those beautiful things.

00:28:34.001 --> 00:28:38.121
Same thing, you start sucking in the milk.

00:28:38.121 --> 00:28:46.951
There is joy but you cannot feel the joy because
the power, that subtle power of Divine Discretion

00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:49.291
is not there.

00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:51.901
Once that comes in, you start enjoying everything.

00:28:51.901 --> 00:29:02.961
It’s just the same, [your] life is just
the same, nothing has changed: same house,

00:29:02.961 --> 00:29:08.221
same family, same city, same environment.

00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:19.721
But you start enjoying because the sensitivity
of your Hamsa Chakra is now only for Divine

00:29:19.721 --> 00:29:28.201
Discretion and you immediately know and then
you don’t want to do anything with the thorns,

00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:35.101
only want to gather flowers and you know how
to gather flowers and you are in joy.

00:29:35.101 --> 00:29:46.351
So the light of the Spirit, which shines through
your Hamsa Chakra, gives you wisdom.

00:29:46.351 --> 00:29:52.011
Wisdom doesn’t mean that you know how to
argue things or you fight with people.

00:29:52.011 --> 00:29:53.691
No, it doesn’t mean that!

00:29:53.691 --> 00:30:07.671
Wisdom means how you take to the good side
of everything, to enjoy it, this is Wisdom.

00:30:07.671 --> 00:30:15.581
And that you avoid all destructive things
and take to something constructive.

00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:23.421
Now you are going, say, on a road and is written
there – there’s danger.

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:25.601
Before realisation they will say, “All right.

00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:26.681
Let’s see what is danger.”

00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:33.491
They’ll jump into it and say that, “We
have got nirvana” by killing themselves.

00:30:33.491 --> 00:30:35.491
Such explanations!

00:30:35.491 --> 00:30:37.981
But a sensible man will say, “All right,
danger?

00:30:37.981 --> 00:30:38.981
Go back.

00:30:38.981 --> 00:30:40.991
What’s the harm, after all?”

00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:45.281
He preserves himself.

00:30:45.281 --> 00:30:54.351
He respects his life because he knows now
[that] he has become the instrument of God.

00:30:54.351 --> 00:31:02.371
So Wisdom comes to you automatically, but
through experience.

00:31:02.371 --> 00:31:06.491
Then you know this is the right path.

00:31:06.491 --> 00:31:10.241
Through experience you start understanding.

00:31:10.241 --> 00:31:12.430
Nowadays I am telling all these things to
you.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:17.051
Say, if, twenty years back, I never talked
of these things to them, [it was] because

00:31:17.051 --> 00:31:20.820
I knew if I start talking, they’ll say,
“Oh, She’s talking something out of the

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.820
blue.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.001
God knows if it is true or not.”

00:31:25.001 --> 00:31:33.771
But once the wisdom becomes transparent and
you start seeing through it, everything, very

00:31:33.771 --> 00:31:42.361
clearly, makes your mind absolutely clear
then, anybody who then tells things of wisdom,

00:31:42.361 --> 00:31:48.611
you never feel bad about it, on the contrary,
you thank that “I’m so lucky that I can

00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:53.050
hear about these things, such a nice things!”

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.530
And also those sayings start giving you joy.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:02.211
So, with the ear you hear so many things.

00:32:02.211 --> 00:32:06.721
Used to hear the same things, might [be] hearing
so much music, everything – before also

00:32:06.721 --> 00:32:09.901
– but never gave you joy.

00:32:09.901 --> 00:32:18.491
Now, because of this transformation, the same
music, which you heard before, now makes you

00:32:18.491 --> 00:32:22.660
feel as if you are in the seventh heaven.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.701
It gives you ecstasy.

00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:31.641
The poetry, which was quite mundane, ordinary,
people told Me, “Mother, it was such a headache

00:32:31.641 --> 00:32:33.940
to read William Blake in those days.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.381
But now we love it.

00:32:35.381 --> 00:32:38.150
We read it like Bible!”

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:44.711
Because now you have developed new sight,
new hearing power.

00:32:44.711 --> 00:32:51.300
All these are called in Sanskrit ‘atindrya’,
means ‘the organs which are subtle organs

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.331
within us’.

00:32:52.331 --> 00:33:03.670
So eyes have a subtle organ, ears have a subtle
organ and these subtle organs then start emitting

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:13.261
such responses to all the surroundings that
you just gather whatever is beautiful.

00:33:13.261 --> 00:33:17.731
Say it is very dark.

00:33:17.731 --> 00:33:22.231
Normally, you’ll be frightened.

00:33:22.231 --> 00:33:27.771
But if it is very dark, you say, “Oh, it’s
very good.

00:33:27.771 --> 00:33:29.281
How we are enjoying here na?

00:33:29.281 --> 00:33:31.101
It’s such venturesome thing!”

00:33:31.101 --> 00:33:35.550
You’ll go slowly, slowly holding each other’s
hands.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:41.491
Supposing it is very hot: Then maybe somebody
would say, people may start, I don’t know

00:33:41.491 --> 00:33:44.050
what they would do!

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:48.482
Another would just say, “It’s quite nice
day, you see, it’s nice sometimes to also

00:33:48.482 --> 00:33:49.482
have hot.

00:33:49.482 --> 00:33:50.482
It’s also very good!”

00:33:50.482 --> 00:33:51.482
– like that.

00:33:51.482 --> 00:33:52.530
If it is cold, the other way round.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:59.091
So, thus you start enjoying every aspect which
is supposed to be very, very bad for others,

00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:05.440
[but] to you, you know the aspect of that,
what is to be enjoyed, that part which is

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:14.851
to be enjoyed, and once you know how to do
it, then you say, “We are swimming in the

00:34:14.851 --> 00:34:16.631
Ocean of Joy.”

00:34:16.631 --> 00:34:29.471
The Ocean is the same, but now you just achieve
those beautiful drops of ambrosia which are

00:34:29.471 --> 00:34:36.841
in that Ocean and the rest are worried of
getting drowned.

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:38.310
Same Ocean!

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.310
Same world!

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:43.160
That’s why they say it’s a maya.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:50.520
But after this discretion is shining there’s
no maya – you start enjoying.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:58.670
It’s like this, supposing you drop somebody
in the ocean, he’ll be so frightened and

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:01.971
he’ll die before even he’s sunk really!

00:35:01.971 --> 00:35:08.050
But supposing a person there is, with all
his things to watch and he is the one who

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:13.790
is going to see all the beauty of the underworld.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.560
He’s very nicely secured.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:22.251
He’s got big, beautiful glasses and all
that and he’s wearing nice paddles.

00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:24.940
He doesn’t have to bother.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:29.241
He just goes there, nicely enjoys everything,
takes photographs.

00:35:29.241 --> 00:35:37.481
The ocean is the same for him or for the one
who is dropped in the ocean.

00:35:37.481 --> 00:35:44.511
But the one who is secured, the one who has
all the equipments, the one who knows what

00:35:44.511 --> 00:35:48.520
is to be seen is enjoying it.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:56.241
In the same way, you are equipped with wisdom,
with security and you know what you are doing,

00:35:56.241 --> 00:36:01.211
and the same thing starts becoming so very
beautiful and enjoyable.

00:36:01.211 --> 00:36:05.841
I have seen how Sahaja Yogis enjoy everything.

00:36:05.841 --> 00:36:14.280
Even if somebody is shouting or saying something
in a hall, I’ve seen all the Sahaja Yogis

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.591
start laughing, laughing, laughing, you know.

00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:22.420
He’s, poor man, trying his level best to
condemn everything, and here all the Sahaja

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:26.981
Yogis – just laughing at him, doing nothing,
and that fellow runs away.

00:36:26.981 --> 00:36:34.060
It is something so…I mean they’re enjoying
his stupidity.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:43.881
So the whole attitude of life is so changed
because of this Hamsa Chakra and you are not

00:36:43.881 --> 00:36:49.331
even aware that you have developed that Wisdom…automatically!

00:36:49.331 --> 00:36:59.871
Then you start also consolidating it and making
it your own enlightened faith because every

00:36:59.871 --> 00:37:09.311
time you see [that] whatever you believe in
just works out.

00:37:09.311 --> 00:37:22.262
You see, suddenly you find that things are
brought to you without your knowledge, without

00:37:22.262 --> 00:37:27.621
any effort, which you have been trying to
get.

00:37:27.621 --> 00:37:31.721
People suddenly meet you and you are helped.

00:37:31.721 --> 00:37:34.571
So many things happen.

00:37:34.571 --> 00:37:39.991
Recently, somebody came from India and he
had said that, “I would like to meet somebody

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:42.721
at Milan station“.

00:37:42.721 --> 00:37:47.551
So we sent somebody, but he was wearing a
very small, little badge so this gentleman

00:37:47.551 --> 00:37:56.130
couldn’t see, and he was watching for somebody
there.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:38:04.821
Suddenly, he saw one gentleman standing, like
a Sahaja Yogi, very relaxed, watching everybody,

00:38:04.821 --> 00:38:07.631
not running, not upset.

00:38:07.631 --> 00:38:09.870
He went and asked him, “Did you come for
me?”

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.271
“Yes, yes, yes.

00:38:11.271 --> 00:38:12.271
I was wondering.

00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:15.171
I thought it is you only who has come.”

00:38:15.171 --> 00:38:22.681
So, you make them out because their styles
are different, their standing methods are

00:38:22.681 --> 00:38:26.941
different, their talking is different, the
way they behave.

00:38:26.941 --> 00:38:37.111
It’s all, you see, is a miracle the way
the whole life and personality is changed.

00:38:37.111 --> 00:38:47.251
Once my husband had taken a Sahaja Yogi to
a library, a British library and people are

00:38:47.251 --> 00:38:48.421
very rude there.

00:38:48.421 --> 00:38:52.721
So they were late by about one or two minutes
and it was closing time.

00:38:52.721 --> 00:38:56.291
The fellow just started shouting at him.

00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:57.781
So the Sahaja Yogi said, “Yes, I agree.

00:38:57.781 --> 00:39:03.431
You see, we are late, but these traffics don’t
understand any laws that this library closes

00:39:03.431 --> 00:39:05.191
at this time, you know.

00:39:05.191 --> 00:39:07.241
They don’t understand – the traffic, you
see.

00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:08.630
They wouldn’t listen to us.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:13.761
We told them the library’s closing, you
see,” Fellow started looking at them!

00:39:13.761 --> 00:39:15.402
“But they wouldn’t understand it.

00:39:15.402 --> 00:39:16.402
So important.

00:39:16.402 --> 00:39:23.201
You know, the traffic was stopping us and
we are sorry we are here so late, but next

00:39:23.201 --> 00:39:24.491
time we’ll not do like that.”

00:39:24.491 --> 00:39:32.831
The fellow got absolutely so flabbergasted
and the whole thing melted away.

00:39:32.831 --> 00:39:34.461
He said, “All right, come along.”

00:39:34.461 --> 00:39:40.701
He opened the library for one hour after that.

00:39:40.701 --> 00:39:51.001
So the wisdom of handling people, wisdom of
talking to them, wisdom of handling your jobs,

00:39:51.001 --> 00:39:53.661
everything starts working out.

00:39:53.661 --> 00:39:58.201
And if it doesn’t work, you don’t feel
bad.

00:39:58.201 --> 00:39:59.201
You think, “What to do?

00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:03.501
The other fellow is not a Sahaja Yogi”.

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:06.181
You tried it’s…what can be done?

00:40:06.181 --> 00:40:14.531
Like this time, when we were coming, there
was a nice gentleman who is something like

00:40:14.531 --> 00:40:16.981
a manager in the KLM and all that.

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:21.870
So he came and told Me, “There’s a little
difficulty that there’s no seat for others.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.491
Only three persons first class can go.

00:40:25.491 --> 00:40:26.911
It’s impossible.

00:40:26.911 --> 00:40:28.511
He’s a friend of mine.

00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:30.381
He just can’t help you.”

00:40:30.381 --> 00:40:31.881
I said, “All right.”

00:40:31.881 --> 00:40:33.671
I went and sat on the chair.

00:40:33.671 --> 00:40:37.531
I did like this (bandhan) only I think, three
times must have.

00:40:37.531 --> 00:40:41.850
“Oh, there are six seats already there!

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:45.641
From where did they come up?”

00:40:45.641 --> 00:40:51.201
So then you start seeing one point very clearly
ki (that) there is this All-Pervading Power

00:40:51.201 --> 00:40:54.311
which is very active, which is watching us.

00:40:54.311 --> 00:41:00.350
All the great saints are managing things.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:08.211
Or sometimes you feel as if the angels are
with you, how they’re guiding things, how

00:41:08.211 --> 00:41:11.691
they’re helping us, how they’re there,
how it is working out.

00:41:11.691 --> 00:41:19.031
Then you start seeing all that, then you start
knowing it and believing in it, then this

00:41:19.031 --> 00:41:22.481
discretion settles down.

00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:29.191
Till that state it is settled down, it’s
quite possible that Sahaja Yogis might slip

00:41:29.191 --> 00:41:31.181
out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:31.181 --> 00:41:36.590
I have known many that, they come to Sahaja
Yoga and just slip out on small, small points

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.541
like that.

00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:44.600
Some other Sahaja Yogi, of their style only,
can say something harsh to them and they slip

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.600
out.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.751
Because on the periphery we have all kinds
of people and on the periphery if you stop

00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:56.120
and somebody says something to you, then they
drop out because they have not reached that

00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:02.360
state of discretion that, “This is the right
place I’m in.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.611
If another is wrong, he’ll get out.

00:42:05.611 --> 00:42:08.631
Why should I get out?”

00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:16.231
The growth is only possible when your Hamsa
is put right.

00:42:16.231 --> 00:42:22.601
Without that till you are completely there,
it’s very difficult.

00:42:22.601 --> 00:42:33.271
But once the Hamsa is established, I have
seen people become really very dedicated.

00:42:33.271 --> 00:42:36.741
As you know, it is very big organisation we
have, all over the world.

00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:43.631
I have no secretary, I have no organisation,
I have nothing like an office also.

00:42:43.631 --> 00:42:50.471
But everything, everybody’s my secretary,
everybody’s working it out on their own.

00:42:50.471 --> 00:42:52.441
They’re identified with it.

00:42:52.441 --> 00:42:54.971
They are responsible for it.

00:42:54.971 --> 00:42:57.380
I don’t have…I’m like a plug, they put
Me here, alright, there, there.

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:01.091
It’s all right wherever they put!

00:43:01.091 --> 00:43:06.840
Only this much of discretion, that they’re
my children, they’ll not do anything to

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.871
harm Me, they’ll look after Me.

00:43:09.871 --> 00:43:19.011
Sometimes, of course, it could be quite hectic,
could be very fast movement, whatever it is,

00:43:19.011 --> 00:43:27.051
but I don’t mind because they are doing
so much for Sahaja Yoga and they want to do

00:43:27.051 --> 00:43:33.161
it more and more and they are so responsible.

00:43:33.161 --> 00:43:37.600
So I respect it.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.110
Sometimes people say, “Mother, what a horrible
schedule You have.

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:43.691
We can’t bear to see it, you see, it is
too much.

00:43:43.691 --> 00:43:44.691
How will You do this?”

00:43:44.691 --> 00:43:47.191
I can do it!!

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:55.630
Because I have absolute faith in their identification
with Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:57.051
They are not cheats.

00:43:57.051 --> 00:43:58.281
They are not hypocrites.

00:43:58.281 --> 00:44:04.861
They’re not doing for their own being, own
self, but they’re doing it to help Sahaja

00:44:04.861 --> 00:44:11.101
Yoga, to help others.

00:44:11.101 --> 00:44:17.421
So the identification that you develop with
other wrong things just drops out, then you

00:44:17.421 --> 00:44:22.701
start identifying yourself with beautiful
things because you start getting the fragrance

00:44:22.701 --> 00:44:24.511
of the beauty.

00:44:24.511 --> 00:44:32.541
Then you start enjoying that beauty and your
heart starts opening out.

00:44:32.541 --> 00:44:44.191
All this joy and all these things are not
possible if your Hamsa is still infected with

00:44:44.191 --> 00:44:47.791
ego or with conditionings.

00:44:47.791 --> 00:44:53.271
We have so many conditionings like Hindus,
like Christians, like this, like that.

00:44:53.271 --> 00:44:58.661
These conditionings are so much.

00:44:58.661 --> 00:45:04.061
Such false things we are following.

00:45:04.061 --> 00:45:11.971
But once we give up all these conditionings
in the faith that we are doing it for our

00:45:11.971 --> 00:45:18.221
benevolence, this Agnya, this chakra opens
out very well.

00:45:18.221 --> 00:45:21.681
Without this, Agnya cannot open.

00:45:21.681 --> 00:45:29.501
I mean, you see, it’s an entry to Agnya,
it’s the entry to Vishuddhi, it’s the

00:45:29.501 --> 00:45:34.991
entry to all the chakras of your head, the
peethas that are there.

00:45:34.991 --> 00:45:42.391
So it’s so important to keep your Hamsa
Chakra clean!

00:45:42.391 --> 00:45:50.661
I’ve also told lots of things that can keep
the Hamsa Chakra clean, which you all should

00:45:50.661 --> 00:45:55.021
use, I mean on the physical level.

00:45:55.021 --> 00:46:01.481
Also on the mental level I’ve told you what
you have to do: is to steady your mind, see

00:46:01.481 --> 00:46:11.610
the beauty of anything and not the vulgarity
of it, not the utility of it, but the beauty.

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:24.120
Slowly, slowly you’ll find your eyes will
become cleaner and cleaner.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:33.951
People are now so much in Sahaja Yoga because
of their depth maybe, because of their seeking

00:46:33.951 --> 00:46:42.261
maybe, because of their janmas (births) maybe
or whatever it is.

00:46:42.261 --> 00:46:50.931
But this Hamsa Chakra does the greatest thing
about which, I do not know if you are aware

00:46:50.931 --> 00:46:57.590
or not, that, whatever are your karma phalas
(fruits of your actions) are finished.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:47:04.681
You are not responsible for your forefathers
karma phalas, your country’s karma phalas

00:47:04.681 --> 00:47:08.251
your own personal karma phalas.

00:47:08.251 --> 00:47:20.380
Whatever wrong you have done is finished,
as if you are cut off from your past completely.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:33.041
Once this is established, then all mistakes,
all wrong-doings, not only of you, of your

00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:39.741
relations, of your forefathers, of your family,
of your country, of this world, anything,

00:47:39.741 --> 00:47:40.741
doesn’t touch you.

00:47:40.741 --> 00:47:45.551
You are aloof from it.

00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:56.860
And in this Krita Yuga where this Brahmachaitanya
is

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:06.691
trying to expose and to punish people for
their past karmas – collectively also, country-wise

00:48:06.691 --> 00:48:18.820
also – will not be able to even touch you
because the light of this centre is extremely

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:29.641
powerful and you will be redeemed of all the
fears of whatever you have done before.

00:48:29.641 --> 00:48:40.350
You’ll just be beautiful like lotuses, which
are come out of the mire, and you’ll emit

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:43.011
beautiful fragrance all around the world.

00:48:43.011 --> 00:48:45.590
May God bless you all.
