00:01.160 --> 00:14.000
With today’s vibrations, you can see, when
you are prepared for a puja, how much you get.

00:14.090 --> 00:20.890
Today you can feel it.

00:20.890 --> 00:28.869
So the Divine is very anxious to act, only
thing you have to prepare yourself.

00:28.869 --> 00:34.880
And all these preparations are going to help
you tremendously.

00:34.880 --> 00:45.170
As we are now Sahaja Yogis we have to know
that we have become something different from

00:45.170 --> 00:46.910
what we were.

00:46.910 --> 00:53.070
We are Yogis, we are higher people than others.

00:53.070 --> 01:03.150
And as such we have to understand one thing
that we are not like other human beings who

01:03.150 --> 01:07.450
say something and do something, who can live
with hypocrisy.

01:07.450 --> 01:16.710
That’s why all the problems have arisen
out of all the religions.

01:16.710 --> 01:22.789
A person who says he’s a Christian he’s
absolutely anti-Christ; who says who is Islamic,

01:22.789 --> 01:34.329
he’s absolutely anti-Mohammed; who says
who is a Hindu is absolutely anti Shri Krishna.

01:34.329 --> 01:43.130
This is the main reason why all the religions
have failed so far because human beings talk

01:43.130 --> 01:48.270
big of ideals.

01:48.270 --> 01:53.749
They all say that we have this ideal, that
ideal, but they are not those ideals, they

01:53.749 --> 01:54.749
cannot live with those ideals.

01:54.749 --> 02:01.420
The ideals are not in their lives, they’re
outside.

02:01.420 --> 02:09.270
But they go about saying that these are our
ideals, they become fanatics but they are

02:09.270 --> 02:12.830
not the ideals.

02:12.830 --> 02:20.920
By Sahaja Yoga now you have the method, you
have the possibility, that you can become

02:20.920 --> 02:21.980
the ideals.

02:21.980 --> 02:30.840
The ideal has to first to be understood through
your brains, in the West specially.

02:30.840 --> 02:37.910
What are the ideals we have become or we have
to become, what we can achieve, this idea

02:37.910 --> 02:39.540
you must have.

02:39.540 --> 02:54.320
And secondly you must have a capacity to deepen
your

02:54.320 --> 03:00.450
meditative power so that these ideals go and
settle in your heart as a part and parcel

03:00.450 --> 03:06.030
of your being, that you can’t live without
these ideals.

03:06.030 --> 03:10.111
We can take an example say of Christ.

03:10.111 --> 03:17.700
For Christ He and His ideals were the same,
there’s no difference between them.

03:17.700 --> 03:22.450
He did not talk of one thing, did another
thing and executed the third.

03:22.450 --> 03:29.790
This will be the difference between the Sahaja
Yogis and non Sahaja Yogis, that whatever

03:29.790 --> 03:36.960
are your ideals have to be expressed in your
life every moment because you are that.

03:36.960 --> 03:43.000
If you are gold, then gold is gold all the
time.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.760
It is not gold sometimes, then sometimes iron
and sometimes mud, it is gold all the time.

03:50.760 --> 03:59.760
Only human beings are like that, that sometimes
they can be snakes, lions and could be foxes

03:59.760 --> 04:02.010
also.

04:02.010 --> 04:11.870
But as Sahaja Yogis you become pure human
beings and this is what we have to know.

04:11.870 --> 04:17.810
It is not difficult to strive for it, it’s
not difficult, because now you have the power

04:17.810 --> 04:23.510
to deepen your roots to your heart.

04:23.510 --> 04:32.260
So the brain must be used to understand clearly
what are the ideals of a Sahaja Yogi.

04:32.260 --> 04:40.510
What are the things that a Sahaja Yogi should
do, how he should behave in life, what methods

04:40.510 --> 04:46.750
he should follow.

04:46.750 --> 04:57.699
And then he has to bring it to his heart through
meditative processes, through surrendering.

04:57.699 --> 05:01.070
How I give you second birth you know very
well.

05:01.070 --> 05:05.910
I conceive you in My heart, otherwise I cannot
do it.

05:05.910 --> 05:13.460
Because My heart is so pure, it cleanses you;
by compassion My love cleanses you and then

05:13.460 --> 05:25.180
I can take you out of My Sahastrara, otherwise
how will I do that?

05:25.180 --> 05:33.600
And when that is happened you have become
a new personality.

05:33.600 --> 05:41.400
So you are very different from all others
because a Spirit has given birth to your Spirit.

05:41.400 --> 05:48.730
You have been cleansed by the Spirit.

05:48.730 --> 05:56.160
So you cannot live like that, like all other
human beings are living.

05:56.160 --> 06:04.730
All the clashes, all the problems of human
beings are because they are not what they

06:04.730 --> 06:16.110
talk, ideals are out, out of their life.

06:16.110 --> 06:22.230
That is how a Sahaja Yogi will show himself
off compared to anybody else.

06:22.230 --> 06:27.370
Take an example say of Abraham Lincoln, all
right?

06:27.370 --> 06:33.300
Abraham Lincoln believed that everybody must
have freedom and the government should be

06:33.300 --> 06:36.380
for the public, for the people.

06:36.380 --> 06:41.910
Whatever He talked He practised it.

06:41.910 --> 06:50.300
Whatever He believed in He worked it out and
gave His life for it, that’s why He’s

06:50.300 --> 06:51.740
a great man.

06:51.740 --> 06:56.520
Think of Mahatma Gandhi, they were not like
Christ – incarnations.

06:56.520 --> 07:04.860
Think of any great man, think of Shivaji Maharaj,
any one of the saints – they were human

07:04.860 --> 07:05.860
beings.

07:05.860 --> 07:12.570
But once they knew this is the principle on
which we have to live, they become one with

07:12.570 --> 07:15.020
the principles, they do not compromise.

07:15.020 --> 07:27.150
So what Sahaja Yogi has to be that we should
understand.

07:27.150 --> 07:35.350
A Sahaja Yogi is a person who has got Realization
through the Kundalini, and Kundalini is the

07:35.350 --> 07:43.470
motherhood in you, is the caring, nourishing
power within you.

07:43.470 --> 07:48.160
But mother will never compromise with the
son; if he wants to kill somebody she’ll

07:48.160 --> 07:49.160
say: “No.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.560
” I mean a real mother.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.970
She will even shoot that son who tries to
do wrong things.

07:54.970 --> 08:06.689
In the same way if you become the mother of
yourself, then you have to look after yourself,

08:06.689 --> 08:13.910
in the same manner that you nourish yourself
and all others also, you have to nourish them,

08:13.910 --> 08:21.120
care for them, and do not compromise with
wrong doings, unrighteousness things, absurd

08:21.120 --> 08:22.120
things.

08:22.120 --> 08:31.580
Now when I tell you this it is not necessary
for you to feel guilty.

08:31.580 --> 08:37.099
We have to look upward.

08:37.099 --> 08:48.200
Those who are standing even on a lower staircase,
if they are looking upward they are all right,

08:48.200 --> 08:58.890
but those who are standing at a higher steps,
and looking downward, will go down.

08:58.890 --> 09:01.399
So look forward.

09:01.399 --> 09:09.470
What we have to do in our day-to-day life
in simple relationships even husband, wife,

09:09.470 --> 09:13.890
children, parents – are you becoming silent
within yourself?

09:13.890 --> 09:22.580
Are you nourishing it, with your silence,
with your compassion, or you are supporting

09:22.580 --> 09:28.620
something that is absolutely anti-God?

09:28.620 --> 09:35.700
If you become the ideals, the power of ideals
itself, will make you so dynamic that you

09:35.700 --> 09:42.420
don’t need to consult anybody, you become
the ideal.

09:42.420 --> 09:47.350
They are like torches.

09:47.350 --> 09:52.920
Your ideals itself will be enlightened.

09:52.920 --> 09:57.190
So the first attitude should be: “How do
we deepen ourselves?”

09:57.190 --> 09:59.170
That should be first attitude.

09:59.170 --> 10:06.580
Now say a husband, wife are quarrelling morning
till evening they cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.150
Absurdities.

10:08.150 --> 10:14.270
If they are quarrelling they are not Sahaja
Yogis, take it for granted.

10:14.270 --> 10:18.990
Now what you have to do if two persons are
quarrelling, the one who is a Sahaja Yogi

10:18.990 --> 10:23.180
will leave that wife: “I have nothing to
do with wife, I have no wife nothing.

10:23.180 --> 10:25.730
” Keep out, detach completely from within.

10:25.730 --> 10:27.550
Just don’t talk to that wife.

10:27.550 --> 10:32.490
Don’t discuss, don’t bother about it,
just detach.

10:32.490 --> 10:47.589
If the son is like that just detach, up to
a point but no quarrelling, no argument nothing.

10:47.589 --> 10:55.850
Complete silence, a silent protest, must be
developed.

10:55.850 --> 10:58.730
But in that silence you should not be a cowardly
person.

10:58.730 --> 11:06.810
So many people are cowards, and that cowardliness,
they think is their silent process.

11:06.810 --> 11:21.970
A person who is really powerful will not deter,
will not be aggressive but will not also take

11:21.970 --> 11:24.560
aggression.

11:24.560 --> 11:30.680
So in your meditations you have to sit down.

11:30.680 --> 11:34.589
Now what do you say in meditation?

11:34.589 --> 11:37.280
Try to see all the chakras.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.890
What chakras are catching, face it yourself.

11:41.890 --> 11:45.580
These might be from your past life.

11:45.580 --> 11:49.470
Some chakras are weak.

11:49.470 --> 11:55.320
Try to make them all right, try to strengthen
them.

11:55.320 --> 12:01.200
Because ideals have to be worked out the instrument
has to be all right.

12:01.200 --> 12:11.310
If the instrument is a crazy one how will
you do?

12:11.310 --> 12:17.060
So first of all you must develop your instrument
properly, it should be balanced, powerful,

12:17.060 --> 12:19.450
not cowardly.

12:19.450 --> 12:24.190
People should feel your power.

12:24.190 --> 12:31.720
Of course the power is of love, but love doesn’t
mean that you compromise with all the nonsensical

12:31.720 --> 12:32.720
things.

12:32.720 --> 12:38.029
There should be no compromise at all.

12:38.029 --> 12:47.130
It’s a very self-certifying state.

12:47.130 --> 12:53.470
We cannot say when it is so, we just cannot
say.

12:53.470 --> 12:59.480
Itself the state will certify that I’m all
right now, I have reached that state.

12:59.480 --> 13:08.680
We cannot say after five hours, three minutes,
two seconds you’ll become that.

13:08.680 --> 13:17.930
You just mature and you see that maturity
within you.

13:17.930 --> 13:24.100
Once you understand that unless and until
you become your ideals you are not a Sahaja

13:24.100 --> 13:25.300
Yogi.

13:25.300 --> 13:28.899
Everybody can call themselves Sahaja Yogis,
there’s not inauguration, we don’t have

13:28.899 --> 13:42.050
any sort of a – inauguration of a university
where people can come and get their degrees

13:42.050 --> 13:45.960
and diplomas: “All right you are certified
twice born.

13:45.960 --> 13:52.800
” There are some who are several times twice
born.

13:52.800 --> 13:57.120
They are twice born today, tomorrow they are
not, then again they come twice born and again

13:57.120 --> 13:58.120
twice born.

13:58.120 --> 14:05.220
Some of them can be one hundred and eight
times twice born in Sahaja Yoga.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.250
And even then they are not certified.

14:08.250 --> 14:11.130
So you have to give yourself a certificate.

14:11.130 --> 14:17.350
There’s no university to do that.

14:17.350 --> 14:22.019
You have to understand yourself, what are
your problems, why you are behaving like this?

14:22.019 --> 14:24.470
You treat yourself as a child.

14:24.470 --> 14:28.709
When it is needed you have to rebuke yourself.

14:28.709 --> 14:32.050
When you have to glorify, you should glorify
yourself.

14:32.050 --> 14:34.970
So now you separate.

14:34.970 --> 14:40.390
You become the mother, the Spirit is the mother,
and you, whatever you are which has to grow,

14:40.390 --> 14:42.760
is the child.

14:42.760 --> 14:54.190
Mother is the ideal, she is the inspiration,
she is the power, and the child is the recipient.

14:54.190 --> 14:59.440
If the child is an obstinate fellow then you
can’t do anything about it.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.980
Also find out – you might be one of them.

15:01.980 --> 15:03.310
I know who are they like that.

15:03.310 --> 15:09.390
There are many and you can find them out in
no time.

15:09.390 --> 15:19.100
Obstinate fellows, if they live with ten people
suddenly we hear reports of their existence.

15:19.100 --> 15:26.100
They are quite eloquent even if they are not
talking a word people can tell you: “I had

15:26.100 --> 15:30.450
a fight with such and such.

15:30.450 --> 15:36.150
That person said such and such a thing to
me, that person was so cruel to me, that person

15:36.150 --> 15:37.880
demanded this.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.470
” You know which person it is, where.

15:40.470 --> 15:44.880
You see as a diamond can be made out thorns
can be made out, also anytime you go near

15:44.880 --> 15:50.310
the thorn, anyone without exception, it will
bite everyone.

15:50.310 --> 15:53.300
It is not going to spare, it’s a thorn.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.720
So a thorn has to be a thorn.

15:56.720 --> 16:06.360
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to be
a flower and a strong flower and an eternal

16:06.360 --> 16:10.870
flower, that always grows, does not fade out.

16:10.870 --> 16:19.300
Always growing, never fades, such a flower
you have to be, then you will be surprised

16:19.300 --> 16:38.100
that you do not get into a trip of ego, neither
you go into a complete collapse of super-ego.

16:38.100 --> 16:44.663
So much you know that any one of you can be
called as a scholar I can tell you.

16:44.663 --> 16:51.080
I mean so many times people have asked Me:
“Are they all scholars that You have – Your

16:51.080 --> 16:52.080
Disciples?”

16:52.080 --> 17:01.389
You know so much, much more than any Saint
ever knew I can assure you.

17:01.389 --> 17:03.440
But you know only in the brain, outside.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.010
It’s all bla bla bla.

17:06.010 --> 17:13.530
It comes to the brain, you use it to show
off to others, and finished.

17:13.530 --> 17:19.939
It doesn’t even settle down there, then
how will it go to the heart?

17:19.939 --> 17:26.209
So everybody is talking big, they can impress
people.

17:26.209 --> 17:32.860
I mean if some journalists come here they’ll
be so impressed by the Sahaja Yogis, so many

17:32.860 --> 17:39.620
wise men in England sitting down here.

17:39.620 --> 17:49.500
But you laugh at yourself; you have known
all this because I’ve been speaking too

17:49.500 --> 17:50.500
much.

17:50.500 --> 17:54.669
Also the Spirit is shining.

17:54.669 --> 18:06.240
Let your Spirit shine in such a way that people
know this is a man who is completely integrated:

18:06.240 --> 18:15.980
the Spirit, the talk, the behavior, the life
itself is completely integrated and this is

18:15.980 --> 18:16.980
what is Sahastrara.

18:16.980 --> 18:25.400
So if there is no integration you have not
achieved your Sahastrara.

18:25.400 --> 18:32.860
There will be no need to pull your ears.

18:32.860 --> 18:44.140
A day should come when you all will raise
your heads with great pride and glory because

18:44.140 --> 18:49.980
your ideals will shine like ornaments.

18:49.980 --> 18:56.480
I want to see those days when all those who
claim to be Sahaja Yogis become that.

18:56.480 --> 19:00.640
That’s the most important thing, all other
things are useless.

19:00.640 --> 19:07.500
Getting an ashram, getting this, doing this,
doing that – forget it.

19:07.500 --> 19:19.650
What you have to manage is this child which
has to grow, who is still naughty sometimes,

19:19.650 --> 19:20.650
tries to misbehave.

19:20.650 --> 19:21.880
Now put it right.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.090
You give it a name.

19:24.090 --> 19:29.960
You call yourself a Sahaja Yogi and that child
as Mr.

19:29.960 --> 19:30.960
X, Mr.

19:30.960 --> 19:36.660
Y whatever your name has been and always try
to tell: “Now will you behave yourself.

19:36.660 --> 19:42.060
” Get up in the morning, have your bath,
sit down for meditation.

19:42.060 --> 19:46.390
“I feel lazy,” the child says, “I can’t.

19:46.390 --> 19:51.590
” Then you accept the child, then the child
will become the mother and you will be losing

19:51.590 --> 19:53.010
your powers – excuses.

19:53.010 --> 20:03.330
The child knows, very intelligent, it’s
a very clever child, extremely intelligent,

20:03.330 --> 20:05.640
knows how to deceive you.

20:05.640 --> 20:13.169
But the child also knows innately what it
needs.

20:13.169 --> 20:19.870
If it comes to know that the mother in you
has developed that personality, then it accepts

20:19.870 --> 20:20.870
mother’s personality.

20:20.870 --> 20:27.320
But if the child knows the mother herself
is weak then he starts taking advantage of

20:27.320 --> 20:29.190
the mother.

20:29.190 --> 20:41.820
So you have to not fight yourself but to tame
and this is very easy.

20:41.820 --> 20:46.200
You’ll start enjoying it, looking at yourself:
“Oh Mr.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.669
so and so.

20:47.669 --> 20:49.240
” Then you won’t be angry.

20:49.240 --> 20:55.950
“I know how to handle you, you’re hiding
behind there, all right, giving excuses.

20:55.950 --> 21:09.860
” And the child grows big, so big that mother
sees that and is amazed.

21:09.860 --> 21:18.890
Like in Shri Krishna’s childhood, the Mother
was Yeshoda and the child was Shri Krishna.

21:18.890 --> 21:20.510
It’s very symbolic.

21:20.510 --> 21:30.200
And He used to play very naughty tricks and
She said: “You went and ate that mud from

21:30.200 --> 21:31.200
there.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.200
I know you have eaten.

21:32.200 --> 21:37.150
” He said: “How can I eat, how can I,
I can’t even go out of the house.

21:37.150 --> 21:38.820
I’m sitting down here.

21:38.820 --> 21:40.130
Where is the mud?

21:40.130 --> 21:42.090
How can I eat?”

21:42.090 --> 21:50.170
“You did eat, I know you have eaten, so
better show me your mouth.

21:50.170 --> 21:58.790
” He says: “Really?” and then the mouth
opens and the complete Vishwa Swarup, complete

21:58.790 --> 22:06.610
vision of the whole Vishwa She sees and the
Mother falls at His Feet.

22:06.610 --> 22:10.330
That’s what it should be.

22:10.330 --> 22:18.890
This mother has to fall at the feet of the
child that has grown.

22:18.890 --> 22:24.380
Very symbolic.

22:24.380 --> 22:31.419
That is how you have to grow, into that Vishwa
Swarup.

22:31.419 --> 22:39.179
Into that Collective Being, into that Virata.

22:39.179 --> 22:45.860
Arjuna and Shri Krishna is another very good
symbolic thing.

22:45.860 --> 22:52.690
Arjuna was a friend who used to take liberties
with Shri Krishna.

22:52.690 --> 23:02.570
Shri Krishna tried to tell him about Gita,
all these things.

23:02.570 --> 23:08.160
But still Shri Krishna could not convince
him of that.

23:08.160 --> 23:12.890
All these were just outside “bla bla bla’s”;
as Mother’s talks are.

23:12.890 --> 23:18.549
Mother’s talks are very entertaining you
know very humorous, nice to hear them, instead

23:18.549 --> 23:23.150
of listening to any music better to hear Mother’s
talks.

23:23.150 --> 23:27.360
And then the people think if they are listening
to Mother they have become Mother already.

23:27.360 --> 23:38.630
That’s it happened to Arjuna also but still
he found out that there’s something lacking

23:38.630 --> 23:41.710
in him, that he has not become the ideal.

23:41.710 --> 23:47.790
Still his attention is not there as it should
have been.

23:47.790 --> 23:54.619
So he asked Shri Krishna: “I think I’ll
see your great image.

23:54.619 --> 23:58.630
” Krishna said: “All right are you prepared?”

23:58.630 --> 24:01.230
He said “Yes, I am prepared.

24:01.230 --> 24:07.240
” And then He became the Virata, the vision
of the Virata and when he saw it, he said:

24:07.240 --> 24:10.100
“Stop it, it is too much for me.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.100
”

24:11.100 --> 24:17.590
That’s what should happen to your friend
who is this child.

24:17.590 --> 24:22.700
That it should become that Virata and when
you see that, should be amazed at yourself:

24:22.700 --> 24:25.380
“Oh God, I have grown like this.

24:25.380 --> 24:30.740
” Just like Yeshoda falling at the feet
of the little child, you have to fall at the

24:30.740 --> 24:34.830
feet of the child that is within you.

24:34.830 --> 24:38.800
I am sure this will happen now.

24:38.800 --> 24:42.820
So remember that no argument, no explanation.

24:42.820 --> 24:44.840
Mother is forgiving.

24:44.840 --> 24:49.390
She’ll forgive you everything, you know
that.

24:49.390 --> 24:58.340
Anything you do I’ll forgive you, even if
you murder Me I’ll forgive you, but you

24:58.340 --> 25:01.789
won’t be able to forgive yourself.

25:01.789 --> 25:08.000
So allow that child to grow, grow fully.

25:08.000 --> 25:15.700
Shri Mataji : Who-why all the children’
are crying like this?

25:15.700 --> 25:19.720
Shri Mataji : Why is it crying?

25:19.720 --> 25:21.440
Which child is that?

25:21.440 --> 25:22.730
Sahaja Yogi : Aarti.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.020
Shri Mataji : Hum.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.740
Aarti has a problem.

25:25.740 --> 25:32.120
Take Aarti out, you must clear her, She has
had problems for so many days.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.960
You must clear that child.

25:34.960 --> 25:40.320
Take her out for a while.

25:40.320 --> 25:51.260
Still screaming, better take her out.

25:51.260 --> 25:57.380
You must look after them and find out what’s
wrong with your children if they are crying.

25:57.380 --> 26:00.150
I know what are the children still not all
right.

26:00.150 --> 26:02.350
Just don’t pamper their ego.

26:02.350 --> 26:03.470
Work it out.

26:03.470 --> 26:04.549
Clear them out.

26:04.549 --> 26:05.549
It’s important.

26:05.549 --> 26:07.059
Don’t want to be bhootish.

26:07.059 --> 26:09.830
All their lives they’ll be bhootish like
this.

26:09.830 --> 26:12.430
I’ve seen many children who are like this.

26:12.430 --> 26:16.150
They see Me, they cry, weep, shout.

26:16.150 --> 26:20.310
It’s not a sign of a healthy child.

26:20.310 --> 26:24.470
Rajesh’s son would not even look at Me,
used to scream and shout.

26:24.470 --> 26:28.299
Now look at him how nice he’s become.

26:28.299 --> 26:33.920
So any child who is like that you don’t
say that, don’t avoid the topic.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.730
Look after that child, put him right.

26:35.730 --> 26:39.059
You have to see that the child is all right.

26:39.059 --> 26:46.070
As you have to put your child all right also
put the child which is really your son and

26:46.070 --> 26:49.940
do not live with that kind of a misunderstanding.

26:49.940 --> 26:55.680
If a child cries like that there’s something
wrong with the child.

26:55.680 --> 27:01.400
They are singled out.

27:01.400 --> 27:08.370
If you find your attention is going here and
there, if you are not attentive in the program

27:08.370 --> 27:10.630
something wrong with you also.

27:10.630 --> 27:16.610
If you go off to sleep something very seriously
wrong with you.

27:16.610 --> 27:20.720
At that time if you are thinking of other
things then something wrong with you.

27:20.720 --> 27:25.520
You get headaches, something wrong with you.

27:25.520 --> 27:33.750
Judge yourself, clear out, you must clear
out, that’s very important.

27:33.750 --> 27:40.140
If you are still getting into tempers, irritation,
anger, there’s no balance that has come

27:40.140 --> 27:43.290
in you, something wrong with you.

27:43.290 --> 27:48.780
If you know how to control your anger, then
it’s all right.

27:48.780 --> 27:54.020
You’ll find out everywhere how negativity
works in small things.

27:54.020 --> 27:59.750
Everybody’s improving but it’s rather
slow.

27:59.750 --> 28:04.870
It can be very fast if you meditate, that’s
very important.

28:04.870 --> 28:08.540
You have to know how to make your chakras
all right.

28:08.540 --> 28:10.890
Your mantras are to be siddhis.

28:10.890 --> 28:16.980
Mantras are to be such that they should not
be mechanical, just saying something mechanically.

28:16.980 --> 28:20.400
You should say it from your heart.

28:20.400 --> 28:24.679
Again, if you do not say mantras through your
heart, mantra is not siddha – means you

28:24.679 --> 28:27.710
may go on saying hundred times, it will have
no effect.

28:27.710 --> 28:32.320
Siddha mantra is that, that you say that,
it has an effect, it works.

28:32.320 --> 28:38.820
If it does not work then your mantra has no
meaning.

28:38.820 --> 28:51.309
So the development has to be within and without
and you have to certify yourself.

28:51.309 --> 28:53.650
Nobody else going to certify you.

28:53.650 --> 28:57.299
If you want to give yourself a false certificate
go ahead.

28:57.299 --> 29:00.260
If you want to cheat yourself go ahead.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.850
It’s not going to help anyone.

29:02.850 --> 29:09.270
But if you want to really have the joy and
the bliss of the grace of Heavenly Father,

29:09.270 --> 29:11.990
then come out of it.

29:11.990 --> 29:19.000
Many misidentifications that are there have
to be given up to enjoy that beauty.

29:19.000 --> 29:24.919
It’s such a great day today to meet you
all.

29:24.919 --> 29:31.240
Today is a day we celebrate in India where
relationship between brothers and sisters

29:31.240 --> 29:33.039
has to be established.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.390
They’re very pure.

29:34.390 --> 29:40.820
Brothers and sisters relationship is without
any lust or greed.

29:40.820 --> 29:49.620
It’s pure relationship where the sister
prays for the protection of the brother and

29:49.620 --> 30:03.970
brother prays for the self-sufficiency of
the kshema – well-being of the sister.

30:03.970 --> 30:13.390
So this time you have to think of your other
Sahaja Yoginis and Sahaja Yogis who are like

30:13.390 --> 30:15.909
your brothers and sisters.

30:15.909 --> 30:18.890
You have to think like that.

30:18.890 --> 30:20.540
Purify your hearts.

30:20.540 --> 30:25.220
It’s something funny in these countries
you know that there’s no such relationship

30:25.220 --> 30:26.620
exists.

30:26.620 --> 30:34.870
Purify your mind today on that point, that
everybody else is my brother or sister.

30:34.870 --> 30:38.450
If you are married it’s all right.

30:38.450 --> 30:43.919
But look at everyone, try to look at everyone
as a brother, and a sister.

30:43.919 --> 30:45.370
Both relationships don’t exist.

30:45.370 --> 30:51.039
This is a funny country where there is no
relationship which is pure.

30:51.039 --> 30:54.350
It’s such a filth I tell you.

30:54.350 --> 31:06.520
If you read them you can’t believe it, such
perversion.

31:06.520 --> 31:11.760
Specially innocent people like children are
attacked.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.559
Think of them as virgins.

31:15.559 --> 31:19.779
Be careful.

31:19.779 --> 31:22.590
And the young girls should know that they
are virgins.

31:22.590 --> 31:31.590
If they go about with boys and they are Sahaja
Yogis, they’re not.

31:31.590 --> 31:39.590
Sahaja Yoginis have to be chaste women, powerful,
chastity is their power and men too.

31:39.590 --> 31:47.559
After Sahaja Yoga men should become conscious
of their chastity, that is their power too.

31:47.559 --> 31:54.580
You see this was nomadic times when the men
used to go for hunting and women used to cook

31:54.580 --> 31:55.580
in the house.

31:55.580 --> 32:03.990
Men were supposed to have five women – they
were nomadic people, then they became sophisticated.

32:03.990 --> 32:10.340
Then the monogamy started which reached a
certain point.

32:10.340 --> 32:13.549
Then again this kind of an abandoned life
started.

32:13.549 --> 32:14.549
This is nomadic life.

32:14.549 --> 32:16.730
Now women also have become nomadic.

32:16.730 --> 32:21.930
Men and women are all nomadic and primitive.

32:21.930 --> 32:27.000
After sophistication they have become primitive,
this is the problem is.

32:27.000 --> 32:37.210
But now you have to become higher beings where
there are pure relationships.

32:37.210 --> 32:43.380
Any relationships, supposing there was something
in between Me and this instrument, we cannot

32:43.380 --> 32:44.770
use it.

32:44.770 --> 32:49.309
Any connection can be cut off if there is
something in between.

32:49.309 --> 32:57.000
To have the best connection is to have pure
relationships and it should be discretionary.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.590
Mother is a mother, father is a father, sister
is a sister, brother is a brother, all these

33:02.590 --> 33:07.279
are different, various types of relationships
should be understood.

33:07.279 --> 33:13.220
Women must understand they are women and men
must understand they are men.

33:13.220 --> 33:16.130
Also relationship to yourself is very important.

33:16.130 --> 33:22.909
Women should not try to be men – we cannot,
and men should not try to be women.

33:22.909 --> 33:24.059
Is wrong.

33:24.059 --> 33:27.820
Because basically they are different people.

33:27.820 --> 33:30.770
They are born differently.

33:30.770 --> 33:32.320
What is the difference?

33:32.320 --> 33:35.799
A man is more meticulous, he knows more about
machines, details about it.

33:35.799 --> 33:37.760
A woman will see the pattern.

33:37.760 --> 33:45.000
Woman will listen to the tune more, man will
be seeing to the instruments.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.120
That’s the nature God has created you.

33:48.120 --> 33:53.420
After all somebody has to see this and somebody
has to see that, both are beautiful.

33:53.420 --> 34:00.309
Nobody is higher or lower, but enjoy yourself
as being a woman, enjoy yourself as being

34:00.309 --> 34:01.330
a man.

34:01.330 --> 34:05.630
But man does not mean that you aggress women
thinking stupidly that you are higher than

34:05.630 --> 34:09.639
woman in evolution.

34:09.639 --> 34:15.609
Or women dominating men thinking that by dominating
them they can put them right.

34:15.609 --> 34:17.659
They have never put them right by that.

34:17.659 --> 34:21.969
They have gone absolutely cabbages, men have
become cabbages.

34:21.969 --> 34:24.809
Wherever women dominate, men become cabbages.

34:24.809 --> 34:27.649
They have not put them right.

34:27.649 --> 34:37.739
So both the qualities must be nourished and
developed and the relationship between man

34:37.739 --> 34:46.009
and woman should be of pure love.

34:46.009 --> 34:50.719
Once you start purifying yourself these things
will automatically work out and you’ll respect

34:50.719 --> 34:51.719
each other.

34:51.719 --> 34:53.069
Actually you are all yogis.

34:53.069 --> 34:59.499
I have to respect you and you have to respect
each other.

34:59.499 --> 35:02.569
On the contrary I find there is no respect.

35:02.569 --> 35:05.569
You are all great saints.

35:05.569 --> 35:07.999
Yes, you are.

35:07.999 --> 35:10.859
Respect, respect each other.

35:10.859 --> 35:15.459
You’re not to talk harshly to anyone, to
trouble anyone.

35:15.459 --> 35:20.059
Try to do as much as possible for others.

35:20.059 --> 35:22.709
This is the way we have to change.

35:22.709 --> 35:30.720
This has no brand, of any culture, is the
culture of God we are talking about, is the

35:30.720 --> 35:33.219
culture of His Kingdom.

35:33.219 --> 35:41.969
Where we give others, enjoy giving, doing
for others, loving others, caring for others

35:41.969 --> 35:43.849
– without any return.

35:43.849 --> 35:47.000
If you little bit help yourself the Divine
is very anxious.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.599
You have seen today that the vibrations are
so much that really I am finding it difficult

35:51.599 --> 35:56.049
even to talk to you, sucking, it’s going
on.

35:56.049 --> 36:01.640
Just a little thing you did yesterday, or
this morning.

36:01.640 --> 36:10.130
Tremendous vibrations, and you’ll be thrown
into that, you’ll blossom into something.

36:10.130 --> 36:13.999
Just pay attention to yourself and first and
foremost respect yourself because you are

36:13.999 --> 36:14.999
a yogi.

36:14.999 --> 36:24.009
You cannot be indignified, you cannot be stupid,
you cannot be high handed, you cannot be dishonest.

36:24.009 --> 36:32.890
You have to be a sweet, matured personality
because you are a yogi.

36:32.890 --> 36:38.380
I mean you should call yourself Yogi X, Y,
Z.

36:38.380 --> 36:47.140
Should, you are – but calling Yogi and fighting
and pulling each other’s hair, then I would

36:47.140 --> 36:54.759
say it’s better not call.

36:54.759 --> 36:58.839
Try to get rid of your problems which are
very simple.

36:58.839 --> 37:03.369
If you cannot, then tell Me.

37:03.369 --> 37:14.290
I will tell you how to get rid of them.

37:14.290 --> 37:17.559
Face them out.

37:17.559 --> 37:23.020
May God bless you all!

37:23.020 --> 37:32.830
Now today we’ll not have any havan, that
we have decided because in the Diwali there

37:32.830 --> 37:40.059
is no need to have any havan but we’ll have
just the puja.

37:40.059 --> 37:44.900
Now today is the puja – as you know there
are five days they celebrate Diwali.

37:44.900 --> 37:53.849
The first day is the thirteenth day where
it is the gruhalaksmi’s day, that is the

37:53.849 --> 38:00.059
day when the gruhalaksmi is worshipped.

38:00.059 --> 38:09.819
But a gruhalakshmi has to be worthy of the
worship, and then some utensil is given to

38:09.819 --> 38:13.019
the gruhalakshmi.

38:13.019 --> 38:17.869
Some sort of a utensil is to be given to the
gruhalakshmi as a present.

38:17.869 --> 38:25.229
That is the day Lakshmi was born, Lakshmi
was born out of the Mother Earth.

38:25.229 --> 38:33.739
Out of the, we should say, Mother Earth but
She came out of the sea after the churning,

38:33.739 --> 38:36.529
so that is the birth of the Lakshmi.

38:36.529 --> 38:47.990
She’s the giver of wealth, wealth which
is material as well as spiritual.

38:47.990 --> 38:53.049
A wife who says that: “All right you save
all the money,” teaches the children to

38:53.049 --> 38:59.619
be selfish and teaches the husband to be selfish,
to save all the money in the bank and not

38:59.619 --> 39:02.960
to be charitable is not a Lakshmi.

39:02.960 --> 39:07.349
She’s the One who teaches you how to be
charitable, how to give to others.

39:07.349 --> 39:15.640
A woman who is very particular about her money
and bank balances is not a Lakshmi at all.

39:15.640 --> 39:16.640
She has to spend.

39:16.640 --> 39:17.740
She’s there to spend.

39:17.740 --> 39:21.219
Man has to preserve his money but the woman
has to spend.

39:21.219 --> 39:33.290
He has to earn for she has to spend, but rightly,
spend it rightly, not only for herself but

39:33.290 --> 39:36.950
for the family, but for the husband.

39:36.950 --> 39:45.630
She thinks: “What should I buy for my husband,
for my children, for other Sahaja Yogis, for

39:45.630 --> 39:48.029
other people?” – all her job.

39:48.029 --> 39:54.329
The husband earns and gives it to her and
she does that.

39:54.329 --> 39:57.800
It’s a very sweet distribution I think.

39:57.800 --> 40:02.180
So that’s the day of the Gruhalakshmi when
She’s born.

40:02.180 --> 40:07.699
She must have these qualities, if she’s
a miserly, calculating type of a woman she

40:07.699 --> 40:10.589
is not a woman at all to begin with.

40:10.589 --> 40:20.200
If she’s worried about her own clothes and
her own comforts and her own things then she’s

40:20.200 --> 40:22.020
not a Gruhalakshmi.

40:22.020 --> 40:27.130
She makes others work and sits down herself
and orders about – she’s not a Gruhalakshmi

40:27.130 --> 40:29.279
at all.

40:29.279 --> 40:36.019
She has to work for others, she has to do
for others, she has to look after.

40:36.019 --> 40:37.900
That’s the thirteenth day.

40:37.900 --> 40:42.079
Then the fourteenth day is the day when Narakasura
was killed.

40:42.079 --> 40:52.559
You know Narakasura has taken his birth and
he’s to be killed – the Sahaja Yogis are

40:52.559 --> 40:55.459
going to kill him.

40:55.459 --> 40:59.280
You have to come up to a point and definitely
he can be killed.

40:59.280 --> 41:02.940
When Kartikeya is awakened within you he can
be killed.

41:02.940 --> 41:09.769
But for that you have to be just like gold,
untarnishable.

41:09.769 --> 41:14.329
You need strong people to do that.

41:14.329 --> 41:23.279
A sword that can kill him has to come out
of your metals, then Narakasura can be killed.

41:23.279 --> 41:27.969
He is one of the worst possible asura.

41:27.969 --> 41:29.230
That is the fourteenth day.

41:29.230 --> 41:40.019
When he was killed the gate of hell was opened
and all those who were his disciples or his

41:40.019 --> 41:43.589
followers or satanic people were put.

41:43.589 --> 41:52.670
That’s the only day you can sleep late,
and a good news for you.

41:52.670 --> 42:05.969
Then the fifteenth day, is the darkest night
which we had, darkest night, that is the night

42:05.969 --> 42:10.950
when you put the lights on because it is the
darkest night the negative forces can walk

42:10.950 --> 42:12.599
in.

42:12.599 --> 42:18.119
So the lights are put because Lakshmi can
come in.

42:18.119 --> 42:27.170
You’ll be surprised how Lakshmiji is, that
if a bottle of wine enters from one end She

42:27.170 --> 42:28.709
disappears from another.

42:28.709 --> 42:34.880
If there’s a lady, she’s bhootish in the
family, they can never have the enjoyment

42:34.880 --> 42:38.119
of Lakshmi.

42:38.119 --> 42:40.390
The Lakshmiji runs away from them.

42:40.390 --> 42:41.830
They may have money but they cannot enjoy.

42:41.830 --> 42:46.869
The Lakshmiji will run away.

42:46.869 --> 42:52.530
Such a person will be so inauspicious I tell
you.

42:52.530 --> 43:00.170
Supposing you want to, say, buy something
and such a bhootish person telephones to you-

43:00.170 --> 43:01.569
cannot get it, finished.

43:01.569 --> 43:08.339
First of all your ears will be finished with
the poison and then whatever work you are

43:08.339 --> 43:10.999
doing you’ll never be successful.

43:10.999 --> 43:18.119
Now this country is so full of such bhootish
women – alakshmis, that I don’t know how

43:18.119 --> 43:21.430
will they become all right.

43:21.430 --> 43:28.049
The women have to decide to get rid of their
bhoots and not to carry on with them.

43:28.049 --> 43:33.989
They must meditate, they must try, if they
feel sleepy they must go and have a bath,

43:33.989 --> 43:41.950
go twice, thrice, sometimes burning yourself
a little bit, doesn’t matter.

43:41.950 --> 43:47.329
See to it that you don’t feel sleepy and
dreamy.

43:47.329 --> 43:51.420
If you are dreamy by nature then you are bhootish.

43:51.420 --> 44:01.019
That’s the responsibility of women to keep
the Lakshmi intact.

44:01.019 --> 44:06.509
So that’s the Lakshmi Day when we say that
Lakshmi Puja takes place because that is the

44:06.509 --> 44:15.219
day you invite the Lakshmi to come in, the
Rajalakshmi, the Lakshmi by which you become

44:15.219 --> 44:27.499
the king of the family, or the royal benevolence
you can call it, the regal feeling in the

44:27.499 --> 44:34.829
family – that is the day.

44:34.829 --> 44:42.009
Then comes the day, next to that is the first
of the month in…

44:42.009 --> 44:48.109
That is the calendar, My forefathers, because
you’re all My children you have to use the

44:48.109 --> 44:53.309
same calendar, Shalivahanas calendar and that
is the first day of the Shalivahanas calendar.

44:53.309 --> 44:57.140
And what do they do in the morning time to
celebrate it?

44:57.140 --> 45:09.699
They take one of these jars, Aquarius and
put a shawl with it and that is put as a flag,

45:09.699 --> 45:13.289
representing the Aquarius and the shawl of
the Mother.

45:13.289 --> 45:17.650
That’s why they are called as Shalivahana
– the ones who carry the shawls of the Mother,

45:17.650 --> 45:20.400
the “carriers of the shawls of the Mother”.

45:20.400 --> 45:23.910
That’s how they put it up.

45:23.910 --> 45:28.119
The shawl on top of the Aquarius.

45:28.119 --> 45:38.509
This should be actually the flag of the Sahaja
Yogis that you make it the Aquarius or we

45:38.509 --> 45:49.199
can say the jar [- what do you call that pitcher?

45:49.199 --> 45:55.509
Or not pitcher but this lota business what
do you call that – there’s nothing used

45:55.509 --> 45:56.509
like that here.

45:56.509 --> 46:03.279
That one is kumbha – we can call in kumbha
and the shawl is there so they put it up.

46:03.279 --> 46:04.390
That’s why they] (FV note: The section between
square brackets was not found on either my

46:04.390 --> 46:05.390
audio tape or mp3 file, and hence could not
be verified.

46:05.390 --> 46:10.150
) call as Gudi Padwa, Padwa means first day
of the moon is Padwa, and Gudi means “this”.

46:10.150 --> 46:20.839
So they put it up and that is how they say
that today is the New Year day for the Shalivahanas.

46:20.839 --> 46:34.239
Shawl is the covering of your Mother which
gives it warmth and also it covers Her modesty.

46:34.239 --> 46:41.450
Shawl is a sign of regality and modesty and
chastity.

46:41.450 --> 46:42.979
So you stand for that of your Mother.

46:42.979 --> 46:53.400
You protect it like Ganesha does.

46:53.400 --> 47:00.130
Only on one point He gets angry, if anybody
says or does anything against the Mother,

47:00.130 --> 47:03.529
then He comes down.

47:03.529 --> 47:09.449
That’s why Christ has said: “Anything
against Me I’ll tolerate, but anything against

47:09.449 --> 47:14.299
the Holy Ghost, will not be forgiven.

47:14.299 --> 47:22.180
” That’s the Son talking about the Mother,
that’s what happens.

47:22.180 --> 47:25.589
So today is the second day.

47:25.589 --> 47:38.269
Second day is the Bija – is the they call
it the Bhav-bija is the day when the brother

47:38.269 --> 47:49.299
and the sister, who are the seeds of one tree
have that pure exchange of affection.

47:49.299 --> 47:55.209
The sister does the aarti of the brother,
gives him a tika and then brother gives her

47:55.209 --> 47:59.150
something as a token of his love, as a present.

47:59.150 --> 48:04.410
In Bombay we started that and they have made
sisters and brothers.

48:04.410 --> 48:08.299
I wish you also could find out somebody as
a nice brother.

48:08.299 --> 48:19.199
But I found that these relationships have
been so beautifully managed in India that

48:19.199 --> 48:27.999
if they could be managed here, it will be
a great day of really ecstasy for Me, because

48:27.999 --> 48:34.170
that means you have overcome this devil of
immorality.

48:34.170 --> 48:42.499
The purity, removing the lust and greed from
your mind completely and bestowing that affection

48:42.499 --> 48:47.170
for someone who is your sister.

48:47.170 --> 48:51.910
Very common in India, everybody has a sister
there; all the Sahaja Yogis have a sister

48:51.910 --> 48:55.509
and they look after their sister that way.

48:55.509 --> 49:02.969
Is a very sweet feeling and a sister is treated
– like Raulbai is a sister of Dumas you

49:02.969 --> 49:10.430
can imagine, and her sister is treated with
the same grace as the own sister is to be

49:10.430 --> 49:13.880
treated with all the relationships and everything.

49:13.880 --> 49:17.189
So this is the fifth day is Dwija.

49:17.189 --> 49:22.410
So from thirteenth to the fifth day they celebrate
Diwali.

49:22.410 --> 49:25.779
For us Diwali has a very great significance.

49:25.779 --> 49:35.400
That is, from one light many lights are awakened
and they are put in a line, so they are called

49:35.400 --> 49:39.309
as Diwali – means ‘the lights put in a
line’.

49:39.309 --> 49:47.650
So when you hold My Hands together all of
us – through that the energy passes and

49:47.650 --> 50:02.019
the enlightened rasa is established, and the
whole world has to become that beautiful reign

50:02.019 --> 50:18.059
of your Mother where nothing but the bliss
of your Father and His enjoyment when He sees

50:18.059 --> 50:24.569
His Own Creation dancing in that Ocean of
Bliss.

50:24.569 --> 50:26.720
May God bless you.
