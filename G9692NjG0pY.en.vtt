02:44.916 --> 02:53.247
Today I am feeling rather sad [that] had to
say something, hard things yesterday and you

02:53.247 --> 03:00.737
know [a] mother is like that (Mother is referring
to a lecture in Marathi the previous day).

03:00.737 --> 03:06.026
You have to correct your children, you have
to tell them something, but you don’t like

03:06.026 --> 03:12.217
it and you have to really put up yourself
to that point, that you can say something

03:12.217 --> 03:14.937
to your children.

03:14.937 --> 03:23.676
And the effect was good they said, but I didn’t
want them to cry or weep.

03:23.676 --> 03:28.876
I want them to be corrected, to understand
the responsibility that they have.

03:28.876 --> 03:39.437
We have to understand that we have a responsibility
towards Sahaja Yoga; and that is, if you understand

03:39.437 --> 03:45.547
the first responsibility, is that you have
to be very good Sahaja Yogis to begin with;

03:45.547 --> 03:47.737
that’s the greatest.

03:47.737 --> 03:52.237
I have seen some very little girls also are
very show-offs: they’ll be the first to

03:52.237 --> 03:58.587
sit further, they’ll be attracting my attention,
doing these things.

03:58.587 --> 04:02.527
So they have to be told to behave themselves.

04:02.527 --> 04:09.787
There are so many things like that which are
to be told to your children also.

04:09.787 --> 04:16.767
Like today so many leaders came and they also
told me what is happening in India now, specially

04:16.767 --> 04:26.607
in Maharashtra – but I think it is all over
– that they are taking to Western life,

04:26.607 --> 04:32.587
sitting before the mirror, all the time dressing
up, thinking about their beauty, this, that.

04:32.587 --> 04:36.457
I mean, it was never done before.

04:36.457 --> 04:41.097
And the mothers allow them to do because they
don’t want to face them.

04:41.097 --> 04:46.507
And then they see bad pictures and bad films
and things like that, and then they have a

04:46.507 --> 04:50.658
bad effect of these bad films and they try
to follow: at the age of sixteen years they

04:50.658 --> 04:54.447
want to fall in love or something like that.

04:54.447 --> 04:59.527
All this nonsense is coming, I know that this
filmmaking is a very dangerous thing these

04:59.527 --> 05:00.527
days.

05:00.527 --> 05:05.697
They are making all kinds of films to show
that a sixteen year old girl and an eighteen

05:05.697 --> 05:08.307
year old boy run away from the house because
they are ‘in love’.

05:08.307 --> 05:12.256
And what do they understand of it?

05:12.256 --> 05:17.286
No maturity of any kind to have a good married
life.

05:17.286 --> 05:20.486
But for a born-realised children it is different.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.006
They are very different.

05:23.006 --> 05:28.116
Because I have seen the reaction of my own
grandchildren, how they react.

05:28.116 --> 05:39.108
So, like one of them said to me, “Can you
imagine grandma that in our gardens, one young

05:39.108 --> 05:44.027
man running, another young woman running after
him, dancing in the garden and kissing.

05:44.027 --> 05:45.467
Is it possible?

05:45.467 --> 05:48.337
The stupid things they do in the films!”

05:48.337 --> 05:50.217
They make fun of all these things.

05:50.217 --> 05:58.917
The youngest one, he came once to Cabella
and there was some film made, of one actress,

05:58.917 --> 06:00.167
‘Mandakini’ or something.

06:00.167 --> 06:03.096
She’s a Muslim lady, but she calls herself
‘Mandakini’.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.107
“Never see her films!” he says, “very
bad, very bad!”

06:06.107 --> 06:07.307
I said, “What happened?”

06:07.307 --> 06:09.107
“Do you know what she did?

06:09.107 --> 06:13.527
She went into the River Ganges with very thin
clothes and she came out and she insulted

06:13.527 --> 06:14.527
all of us.

06:14.527 --> 06:15.527
We don’t see her film."

06:15.527 --> 06:16.736
I said, “Really?

06:16.736 --> 06:19.577
But must be, I said, the director."

06:19.577 --> 06:22.997
“Yes, that horrible Raj Kapoor, he’s the
worst.

06:22.997 --> 06:27.747
Thank God he’s dead now."

06:27.747 --> 06:28.747
Imagine!

06:28.747 --> 06:33.947
Even when they were young their reactions
were like this.

06:33.947 --> 06:37.827
Even I have seen my elder one.

06:37.827 --> 06:39.876
She was engaged.

06:39.876 --> 06:42.606
She was thinking she’ll select her own.

06:42.777 --> 06:49.576
She wanted to marry somebody and she only
stuck onto one fellow to see him, but to the

06:49.636 --> 06:53.206
end she was saying, “I don’t want to get
engaged till I see this man thoroughly.

06:53.206 --> 06:55.057
I have not seen him."

06:55.057 --> 06:58.066
I mean she never gave in fully.

06:58.066 --> 07:01.187
So I was we are never bothered about it.

07:01.187 --> 07:04.357
Whenever they are they behave in such a manner.

07:04.357 --> 07:08.747
Like another one in Delhi I asked her, “Why
do you wear these khadi clothes all the time?

07:08.747 --> 07:10.217
Can’t you wear something better?

07:10.217 --> 07:13.597
What will people think, that we don’t give
you any money?”

07:13.597 --> 07:14.977
She said, “No, it’s better.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.157
Nobody looks at you.

07:16.157 --> 07:19.557
It’s a very good idea."

07:19.557 --> 07:21.847
So this is a sign of a really born-realised.

07:21.847 --> 07:26.087
I have studied all of them, my grandson and
three children.

07:26.087 --> 07:27.777
There’s no question.

07:27.777 --> 07:31.137
They are so moral, so moral!

07:31.137 --> 07:36.387
And we never told them these things.

07:36.387 --> 07:40.687
We never told them that, “This is good,”
or, “that good,” or, “you should not

07:40.687 --> 07:41.687
do this."

07:41.687 --> 07:43.407
They, themselves [understand].

07:43.407 --> 07:51.497
Then my sister’s grandson the other day
we met, he’s only a five year old boy, born-realised.

07:51.497 --> 07:59.177
So in Sahaja Yoga we don’t eat paan, so
my sister, another sister, he calls as all

07:59.177 --> 08:01.967
of us as ‘grandmas’, she ate the paan.

08:01.967 --> 08:04.827
He just started fighting, “Why do you eat
paan?

08:04.827 --> 08:05.827
Dirty thing.

08:05.827 --> 08:06.827
Throw away!

08:06.827 --> 08:07.827
I will have nothing to do.

08:07.827 --> 08:08.827
I am kutti with you!”

08:08.827 --> 08:09.827
Means I am now finished with it.

08:09.827 --> 08:11.177
Five year old!

08:11.177 --> 08:12.177
He protested.

08:12.177 --> 08:13.367
And then he suddenly started crying.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.027
I said, “Why are you crying now?”

08:15.027 --> 08:16.457
“All of them are eating paan.

08:16.457 --> 08:17.527
They are all bad people.

08:17.527 --> 08:19.577
I don’t want to have them here!”

08:19.577 --> 08:22.257
I mean in the marriage, they were eating paan!

08:22.257 --> 08:26.277
So, he said he made everybody throw away their
paan!

08:26.277 --> 08:31.947
So I told him, “There are people who don’t
eat paan, don’t take cigarettes and don’t

08:31.947 --> 08:34.157
drink and they are with us.

08:34.157 --> 08:35.267
They are called Sahaja Yogis."

08:35.267 --> 08:37.427
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!” he said.

08:37.427 --> 08:38.967
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!

08:38.967 --> 08:41.557
Well, why do you tolerate, grandma, all these
people?

08:41.557 --> 08:42.877
Tell them off!

08:42.877 --> 08:44.527
They have no business to eat paan."

08:44.527 --> 08:48.087
I was surprised [at] a five year old child.

08:48.087 --> 08:53.887
Maybe, you might say, it’s my relationship
or my blood in them or whatever it is.

08:53.887 --> 08:59.587
They are really remarkably moral people, remarkably,
for their age.

08:59.587 --> 09:06.207
Also they are moral not only for themselves,
but also their friends and everyone, extremely

09:06.207 --> 09:11.627
moral.

09:11.627 --> 09:15.847
They don’t like people sitting before the
mirror for hours together, never.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.627
They said, “They must be bhoots."

09:17.627 --> 09:21.357
“We had a lady who was working in our house."

09:21.357 --> 09:25.777
She said, “She doesn’t clean my bathroom,
she’s just looking at the mirror and looking

09:25.777 --> 09:26.777
at herself!”

09:26.777 --> 09:29.487
I said, “Isn’t she frightened of herself?”

09:29.487 --> 09:31.247
All kinds of things!

09:31.247 --> 09:35.277
They make such fun of all the films, such
films you see.

09:35.277 --> 09:41.747
They have seen once there was one film which
my daughters had seen five times, making fun

09:41.747 --> 09:42.907
of the whole thing.

09:42.907 --> 09:44.287
You know, they really make fun of all that.

09:44.287 --> 09:49.157
So once my husband had to see that film with
other relations in Calcutta.

09:49.157 --> 09:50.157
He came back.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.887
He said, “Never see that film again!

09:51.887 --> 09:53.687
Never send those children to that film!”

09:53.687 --> 09:57.057
They had already seen it five times!

09:57.057 --> 09:59.957
But such a reaction, you know.

09:59.957 --> 10:08.217
They never take to modern ideas [like] answering
back to parents and, “I’ll do what I like!”

10:08.217 --> 10:09.217
Why?

10:09.217 --> 10:12.567
Why don’t they do it?

10:12.567 --> 10:16.267
And to me they are absolutely subservient.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.187
If I am having the bath, they’ll put on
the radio.

10:18.187 --> 10:24.577
If I come out, they are sitting there with
a towel and powder for my feet.

10:24.577 --> 10:29.267
All the time they are worried about me, why?

10:29.267 --> 10:34.797
Not about their parents, so much as they are
worried about me.

10:34.797 --> 10:38.957
This is because they are born realised and
the children who are not, these are half-way

10:38.957 --> 10:43.167
children, they are like that: they get impressed
by this Western thing and all that.

10:43.167 --> 10:47.937
So the parents should see and tell them, “What
is this nonsense?”

10:47.937 --> 10:49.817
So many things I can tell you about them.

10:49.817 --> 10:55.677
I have been studying them and I was worried
that if these children were not born in my

10:55.677 --> 10:57.487
family, what would have happened to them?

10:57.487 --> 11:02.947
They don’t like to hear any funny songs
– nothing.

11:02.947 --> 11:07.557
Once, early in the morning, my daughter was
playing some ghazals.

11:07.557 --> 11:11.947
so she got up and came in the room.

11:11.947 --> 11:12.947
She said, “What’s this going on, early
in the morning, crying, crying?

11:12.947 --> 11:13.947
What is this?”

11:13.947 --> 11:14.947
So I said, “This is ghazal."

11:14.947 --> 11:20.657
“What a puzzle, early in the morning, to
make everyone weep!”

11:20.657 --> 11:25.547
You see, these Lucknow people and all those
are very ghazalias: only in the mind.

11:25.547 --> 11:32.357
They never love their wives, never do anything
for them, but they are romantic type.

11:32.357 --> 11:36.667
And these girls know about it.

11:36.667 --> 11:37.707
“And we Lucknowas.

11:37.707 --> 11:39.787
We don’t want to marry these!

11:39.787 --> 11:45.627
They’re just romancing in their heads and
they don’t love their wives and the wives

11:45.627 --> 11:47.827
also don’t love."

11:49.541 --> 11:50.967
So this is what it is.

11:51.021 --> 11:53.997
I mean, they are so mature.

11:54.067 --> 12:01.597
These two were studying in Patna and they
had only one chappal (sandal) left with them,

12:01.597 --> 12:03.186
which was half broken.

12:03.976 --> 12:07.256
So I told, “All right, come along with me
to Delhi.

12:07.256 --> 12:09.116
I’ll buy good chappals for you."

12:09.116 --> 12:10.416
I took them there.

12:10.406 --> 12:12.740
They wouldn’t buy another one.

12:12.716 --> 12:14.190
“One chappal is only.

12:14.176 --> 12:15.500
One chappal and one chappal."

12:15.560 --> 12:18.180
I said, “Why you have come all the way just
to buy only one chappal?”

12:18.270 --> 12:21.510
“Yes, when this will break we will buy another
one."

12:21.510 --> 12:22.510
And the clothes?

12:22.510 --> 12:23.510
Nothing!

12:23.510 --> 12:24.830
I forced on them their clothes.

12:24.830 --> 12:25.830
They wouldn’t take it.

12:25.830 --> 12:26.830
They said, “No, no, no, no!

12:26.830 --> 12:27.830
There’s no need to spend.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.920
Why do you want to spend?

12:29.920 --> 12:33.230
Already we have got so much loan on our head,
of our parents.

12:33.230 --> 12:39.819
And why do you want to spend more money?”

12:39.819 --> 12:40.819
Even grandson.

12:40.819 --> 12:43.130
He said, “My school is so bad!

12:43.130 --> 12:44.530
All the girls want to talk to me."

12:44.530 --> 12:47.300
And now he’s head of the class, school also.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.350
They’re so wise, so sensible.

12:50.350 --> 12:57.400
And it’s an example, before you to see that
your children don’t take to stupid things

12:57.400 --> 13:00.430
of so called romance and all that.

13:00.430 --> 13:05.790
They don’t believe in all that.

13:05.790 --> 13:12.400
Today I have to tell you because I have got
reports of some girls who have been misbehaving,

13:12.400 --> 13:13.600
sitting before the [mirror].

13:13.600 --> 13:14.600
Why?

13:14.600 --> 13:15.600
Why so much?

13:15.600 --> 13:22.860
And I don’t know, I can’t face mirror
for more than for two minutes at the most.

13:22.860 --> 13:27.710
Not because I think I have something wrong
with me, but the vibrations start hitting

13:27.710 --> 13:32.020
me!

13:32.020 --> 13:35.990
I don’t know how I look or what.

13:35.990 --> 13:39.490
Why should you worry so much?

13:39.490 --> 13:43.870
We should be confident, have self-respect.

13:43.870 --> 13:48.970
All is accepted, dirty, filthy, from the West.

13:48.970 --> 13:53.420
And in Sanskrit, as you know I have told you,
they were called as mlecchas.

13:53.420 --> 13:55.150
Mleccha: mala-iccha.

13:55.150 --> 14:00.340
They want all dirt and filth, that’s what.

14:00.340 --> 14:04.020
Iccha is the desire; and they take to it.

14:04.020 --> 14:07.360
Even in the Muslim culture that is there,
that’s why in Lucknow and all that, I used

14:07.360 --> 14:11.360
to get suffocated the way people were romantic.

14:11.360 --> 14:12.360
No sense of proportion.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.600
But, thank God now, Lucknow has changed so
much.

14:15.600 --> 14:20.879
I am really amazed how these people just looking
at women: every woman they must see, turn

14:20.879 --> 14:21.879
their head at every woman.

14:21.879 --> 14:26.920
I mean, their necks might break one day.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.380
But in the West, I have seen, all women look
at the men!

14:29.380 --> 14:34.570
First I didn’t understand what is going
on.

14:34.570 --> 14:38.210
All the time like this, like this, like this.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.960
And then they end up in a lunatic asylum.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.199
What will happen otherwise also?

14:44.209 --> 14:46.249
We are Sahaja Yogis.

14:46.249 --> 14:48.299
We have our own traditions.

14:48.469 --> 14:51.069
We are people of very high families.

14:51.069 --> 14:53.949
Why should we take to these dirty things?

14:53.999 --> 14:59.299
So I would request you to tell your children
not to be impressed by this dirty, horrible

14:59.299 --> 15:00.499
culture that has evolved.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.369
It was not so bad in the West.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.579
I tell you, it was not.

15:03.579 --> 15:14.049
It is now ruined; the whole place. They have no idea as to how filthy it has become.

15:14.049 --> 15:24.499
If you are real Sahaja Yogis, you will be
very quiet, unassuming, dignified, mature,

15:24.499 --> 15:28.968
as well as you will be very moral.

15:28.968 --> 15:30.249
You have to be very [moral].

15:30.249 --> 15:36.649
And you should only like people who are moral.

15:36.649 --> 15:47.289
This is not to be taught, but to be shown
to the children, how you yourself live.

15:47.289 --> 15:56.619
If the mother is all the time busy with her
beauty and this and that, the child also takes

15:56.619 --> 15:57.619
it.

15:57.619 --> 16:12.309
All this filth and dirt should not settle
down, at least in Sahaja Yoga.

16:12.309 --> 16:17.339
This is what today I wanted to tell you: [about]
these people, really I got worried.

16:17.339 --> 16:18.429
They have no sense of music.

16:18.429 --> 16:19.869
They don’t understand music.

16:19.869 --> 16:22.699
They have no sense of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

16:22.699 --> 16:29.199
They are supposed to be your children!

16:29.199 --> 16:36.229
Tomorrow the same children will definitely
cleanse the whole world, but what is your

16:36.229 --> 16:37.229
attention is?

16:37.229 --> 16:40.531
You are giving money to them to do what they
like.

16:40.531 --> 16:44.879
You are not putting your any attention.

16:44.879 --> 16:48.049
Parents are there to correct their children.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.679
They have to.

16:49.679 --> 16:53.829
And if they argue, give them two tight slaps
and they will be all right.

16:53.829 --> 16:57.049
In the West, also, the children are horrible,
absolutely horrible children.

16:57.049 --> 17:00.838
They’ll go on asking you questions, “Why?

17:00.838 --> 17:01.838
Why?”

17:01.838 --> 17:04.239
Once I was travelling with a child like that
and the mother said, “What to do with this

17:04.239 --> 17:05.239
child?”

17:05.239 --> 17:07.849
I said, “You ask him: ‘Yesterday what
I answered, do you remember that?

17:07.849 --> 17:10.349
Tell me what I answered you!’

17:10.349 --> 17:12.929
” Since that day he stopped [asking] ‘why’.

17:12.929 --> 17:14.479
Children shouldn’t talk so much.

17:14.479 --> 17:18.749
They have no understanding of anything, still
little babies.

17:18.749 --> 17:22.158
How are they to talk, as if they are wisdom
personified?

17:22.158 --> 17:25.209
This is all Western new method of educating
their children.

17:25.209 --> 17:27.289
“Let them be what they want, they are free.

17:27.289 --> 17:28.289
So what?”

17:28.289 --> 17:35.218
With this method, no artist has been produced,
no musician has been produced, no composer

17:35.218 --> 17:36.269
has been produced.

17:36.269 --> 17:38.369
The whole quality has gone down.

17:38.369 --> 17:45.949
First you need some discipline in life to
become something.

17:45.949 --> 17:51.159
But also it’s very money-oriented in the
West, that if the boy has to clean the car,

17:51.159 --> 17:53.779
you pay him £2.

17:53.779 --> 17:57.718
No Sahaja Yogi should do that.

17:57.718 --> 17:59.759
He has to do that.

17:59.759 --> 18:02.349
He sits in the car, so why shouldn’t he
clean it?

18:02.349 --> 18:06.158
He should feel, “This is my responsibility."

18:06.158 --> 18:13.309
And a very big problem you will face if your
children turn out to be such horrible ones.

18:13.309 --> 18:19.079
Of course, I am trying to make a school here
for the Sahaj children, but the parents should

18:19.079 --> 18:20.338
not spoil them.

18:20.338 --> 18:23.488
Same with the western people.

18:23.638 --> 18:27.218
Now they have got their children, they are
so attached to their children.

18:27.218 --> 18:31.008
They think it is their own property, they
can do what they like with them.

18:31.008 --> 18:32.168
We made the school.

18:32.168 --> 18:33.628
We paid for the school.

18:33.628 --> 18:36.038
We collected everything, did all that.

18:36.038 --> 18:40.428
They are very nicely coming here to take away
their children to their own countries.

18:40.428 --> 18:45.778
They cannot think even that they are Sahaja
Yogis [and] they have to be in Ganapatipule

18:45.778 --> 18:46.778
[even] if you are not.

18:46.778 --> 18:53.748
They are not going to be like you that, for
some time, take all advantage of Sahaja Yoga

18:53.748 --> 19:01.848
and then just become the same stupid fools.

19:01.848 --> 19:04.828
So they decided to take away their children,
this, that.

19:04.828 --> 19:07.279
I told Yogi, “Why are you sending the children
[home]?”

19:07.279 --> 19:08.658
He said, “The parents are…”

19:08.658 --> 19:12.628
Who are the parents?

19:12.628 --> 19:16.598
Who are the parents?

19:16.598 --> 19:19.078
So this idea should not be there.

19:19.078 --> 19:21.797
Children are to be involved in the main stream.

19:21.797 --> 19:23.518
They should be in the main stream.

19:23.518 --> 19:24.888
They should be here.

19:24.888 --> 19:27.389
Otherwise, we have nothing to do with you
and your children.

19:27.389 --> 19:28.389
Get out!

19:28.389 --> 19:32.198
Now, I have to take a strong view of the whole
thing.

19:32.198 --> 19:36.718
I find, specially in Australia, they are becoming
extremely secluded people.

19:36.718 --> 19:42.028
Some of them are having, in the ashram, their
own rooms, their own television, their own

19:42.028 --> 19:43.538
this thing, their own cooking.

19:43.538 --> 19:45.118
This own business has to go away.

19:45.118 --> 19:49.238
Throw away all such people from the ashrams.

19:49.238 --> 19:51.838
I am surprised at Australians!

19:51.838 --> 20:01.158
They got out of the jail and again want to
go into the same jail.

20:01.158 --> 20:08.178
Next time all the children have to come to
Ganapatipule; next time, and nobody has to

20:08.198 --> 20:10.015
[say], “We have booked their seats.

20:10.098 --> 20:11.485
We have done that."

20:11.518 --> 20:13.435
I told them, “Put them into trouble.

20:13.498 --> 20:14.835
Tell them we can’t send the children.

20:14.835 --> 20:21.690
Let them pay for that then they will understand."

20:21.920 --> 20:29.657
Now the last, and not the least, is the way
still we are attached to money.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.907
Sahaja Yoga is free, agreed.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.847
Your Realisation is free.

20:34.907 --> 20:45.647
But this time, can you believe, [on] the sixteenth
of November, I telephoned from Russia to find

20:45.647 --> 20:48.805
out how much money was collected and there
was very little money there.

20:48.855 --> 20:53.995
And such a big programme, such a difficult
programme and such an expensive programme

20:53.995 --> 20:55.394
we had done.

20:55.394 --> 20:58.264
At the right time they let me down!

20:58.264 --> 21:00.505
So I had to borrow money to have this programme.

21:00.505 --> 21:01.505
Can you believe it?

21:01.505 --> 21:10.445
They don’t feel responsible that they’re
troubling Mother like this!

21:10.445 --> 21:13.855
I was not sure how many are coming, how many
are not coming.

21:13.855 --> 21:18.645
First they said only two hundred coming, then
three hundred are coming, then I heard there

21:18.645 --> 21:20.545
were six hundred!

21:20.545 --> 21:33.435
Have you got a big bank account here that
you can just do what you like?

21:33.435 --> 21:36.245
So they are not responsible.

21:36.245 --> 21:47.565
Next time if you do not pay money till the
end of October, you are out of the tour!

21:47.565 --> 21:49.644
Anywhere!

21:49.644 --> 21:56.425
I cannot go on borrowing money like this every
time.

21:56.425 --> 21:59.855
And then I have to return that money to my
husband.

21:59.855 --> 22:05.135
It’s a fact!

22:05.135 --> 22:08.655
Everybody knows.

22:08.655 --> 22:18.735
[In] money matters, also, we have not yet
been able to be real Sahaja Yogis.

22:18.735 --> 22:25.205
Now, this Shyamji, has bought these saris
on a little concession and he thought that

22:25.205 --> 22:28.585
he will sell those and whatever concession
he gets it, he will give to Sahaja Yoga.

22:28.585 --> 22:32.765
He’s a very honest man.

22:32.765 --> 22:38.855
But because some saris were a little less
in price they were not [sold by] Sahaj Yogis,

22:38.855 --> 22:43.665
nothing, and they were artificial saris, people
went and bought saris from him.

22:43.665 --> 22:46.055
And none of them bought saris from Shyamji.

22:46.055 --> 22:52.195
They are very vain type.

22:52.195 --> 22:56.825
Whatever is the little profit that he will
have, he gives it to me.

22:56.825 --> 22:59.144
We have so much extra expenses.

22:59.144 --> 23:05.245
You have no idea!

23:05.245 --> 23:06.255
Same about presents.

23:06.255 --> 23:10.805
The money, you people, you gave me about the
presents, also, is so delayed.

23:10.805 --> 23:19.805
Just now we have taken thirty-five thousand
pounds, extra, for the musicians, which is

23:19.805 --> 23:21.215
not yet paid back.

23:21.215 --> 23:26.565
Here are [the] people, you can ask them, they
are dealing in the bank.

23:26.565 --> 23:30.825
I have paid for this Chindwada house, four
lakhs of rupees already, not a single pie

23:30.825 --> 23:33.894
(1/192 rupee) has been given so far, paid
for.

23:33.894 --> 23:37.975
We have to do so many things.

23:37.975 --> 23:39.865
But so many Sahaja Yogis there are.

23:39.865 --> 23:41.535
I tell them all, “Don’t give me any presents.

23:41.535 --> 23:44.235
I don’t want any presents from you."

23:44.235 --> 23:47.235
But you must pay for all these expenses which
are incurred.

23:47.235 --> 23:52.885
Today is the first day I am talking about
it, because this time you really put me out

23:52.875 --> 23:57.475
completely.

24:00.275 --> 24:01.775
Absolutely, I was.

24:01.795 --> 24:04.285
I didn’t know what will I do.

24:04.575 --> 24:06.744
I never borrow money.

24:06.914 --> 24:14.647
Partly I got from Italy and partly I borrowed:
Partly, quite a lot.

24:14.857 --> 24:17.817
After all, everything needs money, you must
understand.

24:17.817 --> 24:24.297
So, you see, next time if you do all these
things I’ll cancel the tours.

24:24.297 --> 24:32.597
Please, by the end of October, remember all
your money should be there.

24:32.597 --> 24:40.187
It’s not proper to say all these things
to you, I know, but you should also know what

24:40.187 --> 24:42.287
trouble I am going through.

24:42.287 --> 24:43.287
For doing what?

24:43.287 --> 24:46.717
For your Realisation, for your tours, for
your everything.

24:46.717 --> 24:52.997
I don’t need Sahaja Yoga do I?

24:57.846 --> 25:08.523
Also, the last thing is this, as I have said,
money is needed just now, but maybe, might

25:08.603 --> 25:14.672
be, something might [be] worked out when you
won’t need so much money; may.

25:14.672 --> 25:23.787
It will only work out if you people are sincere.

25:23.846 --> 25:26.346
So many things [missing part]

25:26.436 --> 25:29.706
working out, I agree, but still

25:29.806 --> 25:38.946
these are things that are missing which must
be somehow or other corrected: by the leaders,

25:38.946 --> 25:43.436
by the world leaders, and coordinated.

25:43.436 --> 25:45.656
It should be done.

25:45.656 --> 25:48.125
After all, you know my age now.

25:48.125 --> 25:50.976
You don’t want to trouble me.

25:50.976 --> 25:58.135
This is the only kindness I need: not to go
on postponing things, not to go on being irresponsible,

25:58.135 --> 25:59.646
that’s all!

25:59.646 --> 26:04.125
I have been telling you for the last fifteen
years [that] I don’t want any presents!

26:04.125 --> 26:07.546
For presents, for saris, everybody’s anxious.

26:07.546 --> 26:13.036
Now this time every country wanted to give
me [a] sari.

26:13.036 --> 26:14.255
Just imagine!

26:14.255 --> 26:16.696
I don’t need that.

26:16.696 --> 26:22.186
I don’t know what I will do with it.

26:22.186 --> 26:29.266
But full attention to yourself and to the
collective work and to the global work.

26:29.266 --> 26:36.656
If I stop this work, it’s very easy, but
you don’t want that.

26:36.656 --> 26:39.466
Even few are coming, whatever it is.

26:39.466 --> 26:42.006
Definitely you tell me [that] so many are
coming – finished!

26:42.006 --> 26:46.986
It’s hardly two, three years more, at the
most it will continue.

26:46.986 --> 26:50.375
It cannot go on forever.

26:50.375 --> 26:57.176
We’ll have to think of something else.

26:57.176 --> 27:06.096
And my own style is that, whatever you give
for my pujas, I keep it for Sahaja Yoga only:

27:06.096 --> 27:11.516
for the buying of silver, this, that.

27:11.516 --> 27:15.656
So much of silver I have given, so much gold
that is here is my own.

27:15.656 --> 27:17.926
Everything, most of the ornaments are my own.

27:17.926 --> 27:22.546
Now what else I should do?

27:22.546 --> 27:29.446
Not that I want anything from you, but you
should be responsible and understand.

27:29.446 --> 27:31.286
All of you should, please.

27:31.286 --> 27:36.096
If you can really think that this is so important.

27:36.096 --> 27:41.296
Twelve disciples of Christ worked out Christianity
– only twelve.

27:41.296 --> 27:47.836
And they were fishermen: how they did it!

27:47.836 --> 27:56.076
All right, so everybody is telling me that,
“Mother you must talk to them and tell them

27:56.076 --> 27:58.175
about it."

27:59.134 --> 28:00.594
So I have told you.

28:00.974 --> 28:02.803
I have done my job.

28:02.803 --> 28:08.994
Now it is for you to think what is good and
what should be done.

28:08.994 --> 28:15.254
Sahaja Yoga is your own: is for your children,
is for your family, is for the country, not

28:15.254 --> 28:17.444
only [that, but] for the whole world, where
you live.

28:17.444 --> 28:19.964
You are such a great people who are realised-souls.

28:19.964 --> 28:24.844
Where are the realised-souls here?

28:24.934 --> 28:30.694
So have self-esteem, then you will feel responsible,
you know, “I am responsible."

28:32.523 --> 28:34.233
Thank you very much.

28:34.253 --> 28:37.243
May God bless you.
