00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:53.247
Today I am feeling rather sad [that] had to
say something, hard things yesterday and you

00:02:53.247 --> 00:03:00.737
know [a] mother is like that (Mother is referring
to a lecture in Marathi the previous day).

00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:06.026
You have to correct your children, you have
to tell them something, but you don’t like

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:12.217
it and you have to really put up yourself
to that point, that you can say something

00:03:12.217 --> 00:03:14.937
to your children.

00:03:14.937 --> 00:03:23.676
And the effect was good they said, but I didn’t
want them to cry or weep.

00:03:23.676 --> 00:03:28.876
I want them to be corrected, to understand
the responsibility that they have.

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:39.437
We have to understand that we have a responsibility
towards Sahaja Yoga; and that is, if you understand

00:03:39.437 --> 00:03:45.547
the first responsibility, is that you have
to be very good Sahaja Yogis to begin with;

00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:47.737
that’s the greatest.

00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:52.237
I have seen some very little girls also are
very show-offs: they’ll be the first to

00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:58.587
sit further, they’ll be attracting my attention,
doing these things.

00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:02.527
So they have to be told to behave themselves.

00:04:02.527 --> 00:04:09.787
There are so many things like that which are
to be told to your children also.

00:04:09.787 --> 00:04:16.767
Like today so many leaders came and they also
told me what is happening in India now, specially

00:04:16.767 --> 00:04:26.607
in Maharashtra – but I think it is all over
– that they are taking to Western life,

00:04:26.607 --> 00:04:32.587
sitting before the mirror, all the time dressing
up, thinking about their beauty, this, that.

00:04:32.587 --> 00:04:36.457
I mean, it was never done before.

00:04:36.457 --> 00:04:41.097
And the mothers allow them to do because they
don’t want to face them.

00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:46.507
And then they see bad pictures and bad films
and things like that, and then they have a

00:04:46.507 --> 00:04:50.658
bad effect of these bad films and they try
to follow: at the age of sixteen years they

00:04:50.658 --> 00:04:54.447
want to fall in love or something like that.

00:04:54.447 --> 00:04:59.527
All this nonsense is coming, I know that this
filmmaking is a very dangerous thing these

00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:00.527
days.

00:05:00.527 --> 00:05:05.697
They are making all kinds of films to show
that a sixteen year old girl and an eighteen

00:05:05.697 --> 00:05:08.307
year old boy run away from the house because
they are ‘in love’.

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:12.256
And what do they understand of it?

00:05:12.256 --> 00:05:17.286
No maturity of any kind to have a good married
life.

00:05:17.286 --> 00:05:20.486
But for a born-realised children it is different.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:23.006
They are very different.

00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:28.116
Because I have seen the reaction of my own
grandchildren, how they react.

00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:39.108
So, like one of them said to me, “Can you
imagine grandma that in our gardens, one young

00:05:39.108 --> 00:05:44.027
man running, another young woman running after
him, dancing in the garden and kissing.

00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:45.467
Is it possible?

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:48.337
The stupid things they do in the films!”

00:05:48.337 --> 00:05:50.217
They make fun of all these things.

00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:58.917
The youngest one, he came once to Cabella
and there was some film made, of one actress,

00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:00.167
‘Mandakini’ or something.

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:03.096
She’s a Muslim lady, but she calls herself
‘Mandakini’.

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:06.107
“Never see her films!” he says, “very
bad, very bad!”

00:06:06.107 --> 00:06:07.307
I said, “What happened?”

00:06:07.307 --> 00:06:09.107
“Do you know what she did?

00:06:09.107 --> 00:06:13.527
She went into the River Ganges with very thin
clothes and she came out and she insulted

00:06:13.527 --> 00:06:14.527
all of us.

00:06:14.527 --> 00:06:15.527
We don’t see her film."

00:06:15.527 --> 00:06:16.736
I said, “Really?

00:06:16.736 --> 00:06:19.577
But must be, I said, the director."

00:06:19.577 --> 00:06:22.997
“Yes, that horrible Raj Kapoor, he’s the
worst.

00:06:22.997 --> 00:06:27.747
Thank God he’s dead now."

00:06:27.747 --> 00:06:28.747
Imagine!

00:06:28.747 --> 00:06:33.947
Even when they were young their reactions
were like this.

00:06:33.947 --> 00:06:37.827
Even I have seen my elder one.

00:06:37.827 --> 00:06:39.876
She was engaged.

00:06:39.876 --> 00:06:42.606
She was thinking she’ll select her own.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:49.576
She wanted to marry somebody and she only
stuck onto one fellow to see him, but to the

00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:53.206
end she was saying, “I don’t want to get
engaged till I see this man thoroughly.

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:55.057
I have not seen him."

00:06:55.057 --> 00:06:58.066
I mean she never gave in fully.

00:06:58.066 --> 00:07:01.187
So I was we are never bothered about it.

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:04.357
Whenever they are they behave in such a manner.

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:08.747
Like another one in Delhi I asked her, “Why
do you wear these khadi clothes all the time?

00:07:08.747 --> 00:07:10.217
Can’t you wear something better?

00:07:10.217 --> 00:07:13.597
What will people think, that we don’t give
you any money?”

00:07:13.597 --> 00:07:14.977
She said, “No, it’s better.

00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:16.157
Nobody looks at you.

00:07:16.157 --> 00:07:19.557
It’s a very good idea."

00:07:19.557 --> 00:07:21.847
So this is a sign of a really born-realised.

00:07:21.847 --> 00:07:26.087
I have studied all of them, my grandson and
three children.

00:07:26.087 --> 00:07:27.777
There’s no question.

00:07:27.777 --> 00:07:31.137
They are so moral, so moral!

00:07:31.137 --> 00:07:36.387
And we never told them these things.

00:07:36.387 --> 00:07:40.687
We never told them that, “This is good,”
or, “that good,” or, “you should not

00:07:40.687 --> 00:07:41.687
do this."

00:07:41.687 --> 00:07:43.407
They, themselves [understand].

00:07:43.407 --> 00:07:51.497
Then my sister’s grandson the other day
we met, he’s only a five year old boy, born-realised.

00:07:51.497 --> 00:07:59.177
So in Sahaja Yoga we don’t eat paan, so
my sister, another sister, he calls as all

00:07:59.177 --> 00:08:01.967
of us as ‘grandmas’, she ate the paan.

00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:04.827
He just started fighting, “Why do you eat
paan?

00:08:04.827 --> 00:08:05.827
Dirty thing.

00:08:05.827 --> 00:08:06.827
Throw away!

00:08:06.827 --> 00:08:07.827
I will have nothing to do.

00:08:07.827 --> 00:08:08.827
I am kutti with you!”

00:08:08.827 --> 00:08:09.827
Means I am now finished with it.

00:08:09.827 --> 00:08:11.177
Five year old!

00:08:11.177 --> 00:08:12.177
He protested.

00:08:12.177 --> 00:08:13.367
And then he suddenly started crying.

00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:15.027
I said, “Why are you crying now?”

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:16.457
“All of them are eating paan.

00:08:16.457 --> 00:08:17.527
They are all bad people.

00:08:17.527 --> 00:08:19.577
I don’t want to have them here!”

00:08:19.577 --> 00:08:22.257
I mean in the marriage, they were eating paan!

00:08:22.257 --> 00:08:26.277
So, he said he made everybody throw away their
paan!

00:08:26.277 --> 00:08:31.947
So I told him, “There are people who don’t
eat paan, don’t take cigarettes and don’t

00:08:31.947 --> 00:08:34.157
drink and they are with us.

00:08:34.157 --> 00:08:35.267
They are called Sahaja Yogis."

00:08:35.267 --> 00:08:37.427
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!” he said.

00:08:37.427 --> 00:08:38.967
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!

00:08:38.967 --> 00:08:41.557
Well, why do you tolerate, grandma, all these
people?

00:08:41.557 --> 00:08:42.877
Tell them off!

00:08:42.877 --> 00:08:44.527
They have no business to eat paan."

00:08:44.527 --> 00:08:48.087
I was surprised [at] a five year old child.

00:08:48.087 --> 00:08:53.887
Maybe, you might say, it’s my relationship
or my blood in them or whatever it is.

00:08:53.887 --> 00:08:59.587
They are really remarkably moral people, remarkably,
for their age.

00:08:59.587 --> 00:09:06.207
Also they are moral not only for themselves,
but also their friends and everyone, extremely

00:09:06.207 --> 00:09:11.627
moral.

00:09:11.627 --> 00:09:15.847
They don’t like people sitting before the
mirror for hours together, never.

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.627
They said, “They must be bhoots."

00:09:17.627 --> 00:09:21.357
“We had a lady who was working in our house."

00:09:21.357 --> 00:09:25.777
She said, “She doesn’t clean my bathroom,
she’s just looking at the mirror and looking

00:09:25.777 --> 00:09:26.777
at herself!”

00:09:26.777 --> 00:09:29.487
I said, “Isn’t she frightened of herself?”

00:09:29.487 --> 00:09:31.247
All kinds of things!

00:09:31.247 --> 00:09:35.277
They make such fun of all the films, such
films you see.

00:09:35.277 --> 00:09:41.747
They have seen once there was one film which
my daughters had seen five times, making fun

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:42.907
of the whole thing.

00:09:42.907 --> 00:09:44.287
You know, they really make fun of all that.

00:09:44.287 --> 00:09:49.157
So once my husband had to see that film with
other relations in Calcutta.

00:09:49.157 --> 00:09:50.157
He came back.

00:09:50.157 --> 00:09:51.887
He said, “Never see that film again!

00:09:51.887 --> 00:09:53.687
Never send those children to that film!”

00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:57.057
They had already seen it five times!

00:09:57.057 --> 00:09:59.957
But such a reaction, you know.

00:09:59.957 --> 00:10:08.217
They never take to modern ideas [like] answering
back to parents and, “I’ll do what I like!”

00:10:08.217 --> 00:10:09.217
Why?

00:10:09.217 --> 00:10:12.567
Why don’t they do it?

00:10:12.567 --> 00:10:16.267
And to me they are absolutely subservient.

00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:18.187
If I am having the bath, they’ll put on
the radio.

00:10:18.187 --> 00:10:24.577
If I come out, they are sitting there with
a towel and powder for my feet.

00:10:24.577 --> 00:10:29.267
All the time they are worried about me, why?

00:10:29.267 --> 00:10:34.797
Not about their parents, so much as they are
worried about me.

00:10:34.797 --> 00:10:38.957
This is because they are born realised and
the children who are not, these are half-way

00:10:38.957 --> 00:10:43.167
children, they are like that: they get impressed
by this Western thing and all that.

00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:47.937
So the parents should see and tell them, “What
is this nonsense?”

00:10:47.937 --> 00:10:49.817
So many things I can tell you about them.

00:10:49.817 --> 00:10:55.677
I have been studying them and I was worried
that if these children were not born in my

00:10:55.677 --> 00:10:57.487
family, what would have happened to them?

00:10:57.487 --> 00:11:02.947
They don’t like to hear any funny songs
– nothing.

00:11:02.947 --> 00:11:07.557
Once, early in the morning, my daughter was
playing some ghazals.

00:11:07.557 --> 00:11:11.947
so she got up and came in the room.

00:11:11.947 --> 00:11:12.947
She said, “What’s this going on, early
in the morning, crying, crying?

00:11:12.947 --> 00:11:13.947
What is this?”

00:11:13.947 --> 00:11:14.947
So I said, “This is ghazal."

00:11:14.947 --> 00:11:20.657
“What a puzzle, early in the morning, to
make everyone weep!”

00:11:20.657 --> 00:11:25.547
You see, these Lucknow people and all those
are very ghazalias: only in the mind.

00:11:25.547 --> 00:11:32.357
They never love their wives, never do anything
for them, but they are romantic type.

00:11:32.357 --> 00:11:36.667
And these girls know about it.

00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:37.707
“And we Lucknowas.

00:11:37.707 --> 00:11:39.787
We don’t want to marry these!

00:11:39.787 --> 00:11:45.627
They’re just romancing in their heads and
they don’t love their wives and the wives

00:11:45.627 --> 00:11:47.827
also don’t love."

00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:50.967
So this is what it is.

00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:53.997
I mean, they are so mature.

00:11:54.067 --> 00:12:01.597
These two were studying in Patna and they
had only one chappal (sandal) left with them,

00:12:01.597 --> 00:12:03.186
which was half broken.

00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:07.256
So I told, “All right, come along with me
to Delhi.

00:12:07.256 --> 00:12:09.116
I’ll buy good chappals for you."

00:12:09.116 --> 00:12:10.416
I took them there.

00:12:10.406 --> 00:12:12.740
They wouldn’t buy another one.

00:12:12.716 --> 00:12:14.190
“One chappal is only.

00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:15.500
One chappal and one chappal."

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.180
I said, “Why you have come all the way just
to buy only one chappal?”

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.510
“Yes, when this will break we will buy another
one."

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.510
And the clothes?

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.510
Nothing!

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.830
I forced on them their clothes.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:25.830
They wouldn’t take it.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:26.830
They said, “No, no, no, no!

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.830
There’s no need to spend.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.920
Why do you want to spend?

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.230
Already we have got so much loan on our head,
of our parents.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:39.819
And why do you want to spend more money?”

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:40.819
Even grandson.

00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:43.130
He said, “My school is so bad!

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.530
All the girls want to talk to me."

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.300
And now he’s head of the class, school also.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.350
They’re so wise, so sensible.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:57.400
And it’s an example, before you to see that
your children don’t take to stupid things

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.430
of so called romance and all that.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.790
They don’t believe in all that.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:12.400
Today I have to tell you because I have got
reports of some girls who have been misbehaving,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.600
sitting before the [mirror].

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600
Why?

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.600
Why so much?

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:22.860
And I don’t know, I can’t face mirror
for more than for two minutes at the most.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.710
Not because I think I have something wrong
with me, but the vibrations start hitting

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:32.020
me!

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.990
I don’t know how I look or what.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.490
Why should you worry so much?

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.870
We should be confident, have self-respect.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:48.970
All is accepted, dirty, filthy, from the West.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.420
And in Sanskrit, as you know I have told you,
they were called as mlecchas.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.150
Mleccha: mala-iccha.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:14:00.340
They want all dirt and filth, that’s what.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.020
Iccha is the desire; and they take to it.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.360
Even in the Muslim culture that is there,
that’s why in Lucknow and all that, I used

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.360
to get suffocated the way people were romantic.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360
No sense of proportion.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.600
But, thank God now, Lucknow has changed so
much.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.879
I am really amazed how these people just looking
at women: every woman they must see, turn

00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:21.879
their head at every woman.

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:26.920
I mean, their necks might break one day.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.380
But in the West, I have seen, all women look
at the men!

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:34.570
First I didn’t understand what is going
on.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.210
All the time like this, like this, like this.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.960
And then they end up in a lunatic asylum.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.199
What will happen otherwise also?

00:14:44.209 --> 00:14:46.249
We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:14:46.249 --> 00:14:48.299
We have our own traditions.

00:14:48.469 --> 00:14:51.069
We are people of very high families.

00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:53.949
Why should we take to these dirty things?

00:14:53.999 --> 00:14:59.299
So I would request you to tell your children
not to be impressed by this dirty, horrible

00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:00.499
culture that has evolved.

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:02.369
It was not so bad in the West.

00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:03.579
I tell you, it was not.

00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:14.049
It is now ruined; the whole place. They have no idea as to how filthy it has become.

00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:24.499
If you are real Sahaja Yogis, you will be
very quiet, unassuming, dignified, mature,

00:15:24.499 --> 00:15:28.968
as well as you will be very moral.

00:15:28.968 --> 00:15:30.249
You have to be very [moral].

00:15:30.249 --> 00:15:36.649
And you should only like people who are moral.

00:15:36.649 --> 00:15:47.289
This is not to be taught, but to be shown
to the children, how you yourself live.

00:15:47.289 --> 00:15:56.619
If the mother is all the time busy with her
beauty and this and that, the child also takes

00:15:56.619 --> 00:15:57.619
it.

00:15:57.619 --> 00:16:12.309
All this filth and dirt should not settle
down, at least in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:17.339
This is what today I wanted to tell you: [about]
these people, really I got worried.

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:18.429
They have no sense of music.

00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:19.869
They don’t understand music.

00:16:19.869 --> 00:16:22.699
They have no sense of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:29.199
They are supposed to be your children!

00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:36.229
Tomorrow the same children will definitely
cleanse the whole world, but what is your

00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:37.229
attention is?

00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:40.531
You are giving money to them to do what they
like.

00:16:40.531 --> 00:16:44.879
You are not putting your any attention.

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:48.049
Parents are there to correct their children.

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:49.679
They have to.

00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:53.829
And if they argue, give them two tight slaps
and they will be all right.

00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:57.049
In the West, also, the children are horrible,
absolutely horrible children.

00:16:57.049 --> 00:17:00.838
They’ll go on asking you questions, “Why?

00:17:00.838 --> 00:17:01.838
Why?”

00:17:01.838 --> 00:17:04.239
Once I was travelling with a child like that
and the mother said, “What to do with this

00:17:04.239 --> 00:17:05.239
child?”

00:17:05.239 --> 00:17:07.849
I said, “You ask him: ‘Yesterday what
I answered, do you remember that?

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:10.349
Tell me what I answered you!’

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:12.929
” Since that day he stopped [asking] ‘why’.

00:17:12.929 --> 00:17:14.479
Children shouldn’t talk so much.

00:17:14.479 --> 00:17:18.749
They have no understanding of anything, still
little babies.

00:17:18.749 --> 00:17:22.158
How are they to talk, as if they are wisdom
personified?

00:17:22.158 --> 00:17:25.209
This is all Western new method of educating
their children.

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:27.289
“Let them be what they want, they are free.

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:28.289
So what?”

00:17:28.289 --> 00:17:35.218
With this method, no artist has been produced,
no musician has been produced, no composer

00:17:35.218 --> 00:17:36.269
has been produced.

00:17:36.269 --> 00:17:38.369
The whole quality has gone down.

00:17:38.369 --> 00:17:45.949
First you need some discipline in life to
become something.

00:17:45.949 --> 00:17:51.159
But also it’s very money-oriented in the
West, that if the boy has to clean the car,

00:17:51.159 --> 00:17:53.779
you pay him £2.

00:17:53.779 --> 00:17:57.718
No Sahaja Yogi should do that.

00:17:57.718 --> 00:17:59.759
He has to do that.

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:02.349
He sits in the car, so why shouldn’t he
clean it?

00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:06.158
He should feel, “This is my responsibility."

00:18:06.158 --> 00:18:13.309
And a very big problem you will face if your
children turn out to be such horrible ones.

00:18:13.309 --> 00:18:19.079
Of course, I am trying to make a school here
for the Sahaj children, but the parents should

00:18:19.079 --> 00:18:20.338
not spoil them.

00:18:20.338 --> 00:18:23.488
Same with the western people.

00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:27.218
Now they have got their children, they are
so attached to their children.

00:18:27.218 --> 00:18:31.008
They think it is their own property, they
can do what they like with them.

00:18:31.008 --> 00:18:32.168
We made the school.

00:18:32.168 --> 00:18:33.628
We paid for the school.

00:18:33.628 --> 00:18:36.038
We collected everything, did all that.

00:18:36.038 --> 00:18:40.428
They are very nicely coming here to take away
their children to their own countries.

00:18:40.428 --> 00:18:45.778
They cannot think even that they are Sahaja
Yogis [and] they have to be in Ganapatipule

00:18:45.778 --> 00:18:46.778
[even] if you are not.

00:18:46.778 --> 00:18:53.748
They are not going to be like you that, for
some time, take all advantage of Sahaja Yoga

00:18:53.748 --> 00:19:01.848
and then just become the same stupid fools.

00:19:01.848 --> 00:19:04.828
So they decided to take away their children,
this, that.

00:19:04.828 --> 00:19:07.279
I told Yogi, “Why are you sending the children
[home]?”

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:08.658
He said, “The parents are…”

00:19:08.658 --> 00:19:12.628
Who are the parents?

00:19:12.628 --> 00:19:16.598
Who are the parents?

00:19:16.598 --> 00:19:19.078
So this idea should not be there.

00:19:19.078 --> 00:19:21.797
Children are to be involved in the main stream.

00:19:21.797 --> 00:19:23.518
They should be in the main stream.

00:19:23.518 --> 00:19:24.888
They should be here.

00:19:24.888 --> 00:19:27.389
Otherwise, we have nothing to do with you
and your children.

00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:28.389
Get out!

00:19:28.389 --> 00:19:32.198
Now, I have to take a strong view of the whole
thing.

00:19:32.198 --> 00:19:36.718
I find, specially in Australia, they are becoming
extremely secluded people.

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:42.028
Some of them are having, in the ashram, their
own rooms, their own television, their own

00:19:42.028 --> 00:19:43.538
this thing, their own cooking.

00:19:43.538 --> 00:19:45.118
This own business has to go away.

00:19:45.118 --> 00:19:49.238
Throw away all such people from the ashrams.

00:19:49.238 --> 00:19:51.838
I am surprised at Australians!

00:19:51.838 --> 00:20:01.158
They got out of the jail and again want to
go into the same jail.

00:20:01.158 --> 00:20:08.178
Next time all the children have to come to
Ganapatipule; next time, and nobody has to

00:20:08.198 --> 00:20:10.015
[say], “We have booked their seats.

00:20:10.098 --> 00:20:11.485
We have done that."

00:20:11.518 --> 00:20:13.435
I told them, “Put them into trouble.

00:20:13.498 --> 00:20:14.835
Tell them we can’t send the children.

00:20:14.835 --> 00:20:21.690
Let them pay for that then they will understand."

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:29.657
Now the last, and not the least, is the way
still we are attached to money.

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:32.907
Sahaja Yoga is free, agreed.

00:20:32.927 --> 00:20:34.847
Your Realisation is free.

00:20:34.907 --> 00:20:45.647
But this time, can you believe, [on] the sixteenth
of November, I telephoned from Russia to find

00:20:45.647 --> 00:20:48.805
out how much money was collected and there
was very little money there.

00:20:48.855 --> 00:20:53.995
And such a big programme, such a difficult
programme and such an expensive programme

00:20:53.995 --> 00:20:55.394
we had done.

00:20:55.394 --> 00:20:58.264
At the right time they let me down!

00:20:58.264 --> 00:21:00.505
So I had to borrow money to have this programme.

00:21:00.505 --> 00:21:01.505
Can you believe it?

00:21:01.505 --> 00:21:10.445
They don’t feel responsible that they’re
troubling Mother like this!

00:21:10.445 --> 00:21:13.855
I was not sure how many are coming, how many
are not coming.

00:21:13.855 --> 00:21:18.645
First they said only two hundred coming, then
three hundred are coming, then I heard there

00:21:18.645 --> 00:21:20.545
were six hundred!

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:33.435
Have you got a big bank account here that
you can just do what you like?

00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:36.245
So they are not responsible.

00:21:36.245 --> 00:21:47.565
Next time if you do not pay money till the
end of October, you are out of the tour!

00:21:47.565 --> 00:21:49.644
Anywhere!

00:21:49.644 --> 00:21:56.425
I cannot go on borrowing money like this every
time.

00:21:56.425 --> 00:21:59.855
And then I have to return that money to my
husband.

00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:05.135
It’s a fact!

00:22:05.135 --> 00:22:08.655
Everybody knows.

00:22:08.655 --> 00:22:18.735
[In] money matters, also, we have not yet
been able to be real Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:18.735 --> 00:22:25.205
Now, this Shyamji, has bought these saris
on a little concession and he thought that

00:22:25.205 --> 00:22:28.585
he will sell those and whatever concession
he gets it, he will give to Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:28.585 --> 00:22:32.765
He’s a very honest man.

00:22:32.765 --> 00:22:38.855
But because some saris were a little less
in price they were not [sold by] Sahaj Yogis,

00:22:38.855 --> 00:22:43.665
nothing, and they were artificial saris, people
went and bought saris from him.

00:22:43.665 --> 00:22:46.055
And none of them bought saris from Shyamji.

00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:52.195
They are very vain type.

00:22:52.195 --> 00:22:56.825
Whatever is the little profit that he will
have, he gives it to me.

00:22:56.825 --> 00:22:59.144
We have so much extra expenses.

00:22:59.144 --> 00:23:05.245
You have no idea!

00:23:05.245 --> 00:23:06.255
Same about presents.

00:23:06.255 --> 00:23:10.805
The money, you people, you gave me about the
presents, also, is so delayed.

00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:19.805
Just now we have taken thirty-five thousand
pounds, extra, for the musicians, which is

00:23:19.805 --> 00:23:21.215
not yet paid back.

00:23:21.215 --> 00:23:26.565
Here are [the] people, you can ask them, they
are dealing in the bank.

00:23:26.565 --> 00:23:30.825
I have paid for this Chindwada house, four
lakhs of rupees already, not a single pie

00:23:30.825 --> 00:23:33.894
(1/192 rupee) has been given so far, paid
for.

00:23:33.894 --> 00:23:37.975
We have to do so many things.

00:23:37.975 --> 00:23:39.865
But so many Sahaja Yogis there are.

00:23:39.865 --> 00:23:41.535
I tell them all, “Don’t give me any presents.

00:23:41.535 --> 00:23:44.235
I don’t want any presents from you."

00:23:44.235 --> 00:23:47.235
But you must pay for all these expenses which
are incurred.

00:23:47.235 --> 00:23:52.885
Today is the first day I am talking about
it, because this time you really put me out

00:23:52.875 --> 00:23:57.475
completely.

00:24:00.275 --> 00:24:01.775
Absolutely, I was.

00:24:01.795 --> 00:24:04.285
I didn’t know what will I do.

00:24:04.575 --> 00:24:06.744
I never borrow money.

00:24:06.914 --> 00:24:14.647
Partly I got from Italy and partly I borrowed:
Partly, quite a lot.

00:24:14.857 --> 00:24:17.817
After all, everything needs money, you must
understand.

00:24:17.817 --> 00:24:24.297
So, you see, next time if you do all these
things I’ll cancel the tours.

00:24:24.297 --> 00:24:32.597
Please, by the end of October, remember all
your money should be there.

00:24:32.597 --> 00:24:40.187
It’s not proper to say all these things
to you, I know, but you should also know what

00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:42.287
trouble I am going through.

00:24:42.287 --> 00:24:43.287
For doing what?

00:24:43.287 --> 00:24:46.717
For your Realisation, for your tours, for
your everything.

00:24:46.717 --> 00:24:52.997
I don’t need Sahaja Yoga do I?

00:24:57.846 --> 00:25:08.523
Also, the last thing is this, as I have said,
money is needed just now, but maybe, might

00:25:08.603 --> 00:25:14.672
be, something might [be] worked out when you
won’t need so much money; may.

00:25:14.672 --> 00:25:23.787
It will only work out if you people are sincere.

00:25:23.846 --> 00:25:26.346
So many things [missing part]

00:25:26.436 --> 00:25:29.706
working out, I agree, but still

00:25:29.806 --> 00:25:38.946
these are things that are missing which must
be somehow or other corrected: by the leaders,

00:25:38.946 --> 00:25:43.436
by the world leaders, and coordinated.

00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:45.656
It should be done.

00:25:45.656 --> 00:25:48.125
After all, you know my age now.

00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:50.976
You don’t want to trouble me.

00:25:50.976 --> 00:25:58.135
This is the only kindness I need: not to go
on postponing things, not to go on being irresponsible,

00:25:58.135 --> 00:25:59.646
that’s all!

00:25:59.646 --> 00:26:04.125
I have been telling you for the last fifteen
years [that] I don’t want any presents!

00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:07.546
For presents, for saris, everybody’s anxious.

00:26:07.546 --> 00:26:13.036
Now this time every country wanted to give
me [a] sari.

00:26:13.036 --> 00:26:14.255
Just imagine!

00:26:14.255 --> 00:26:16.696
I don’t need that.

00:26:16.696 --> 00:26:22.186
I don’t know what I will do with it.

00:26:22.186 --> 00:26:29.266
But full attention to yourself and to the
collective work and to the global work.

00:26:29.266 --> 00:26:36.656
If I stop this work, it’s very easy, but
you don’t want that.

00:26:36.656 --> 00:26:39.466
Even few are coming, whatever it is.

00:26:39.466 --> 00:26:42.006
Definitely you tell me [that] so many are
coming – finished!

00:26:42.006 --> 00:26:46.986
It’s hardly two, three years more, at the
most it will continue.

00:26:46.986 --> 00:26:50.375
It cannot go on forever.

00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:57.176
We’ll have to think of something else.

00:26:57.176 --> 00:27:06.096
And my own style is that, whatever you give
for my pujas, I keep it for Sahaja Yoga only:

00:27:06.096 --> 00:27:11.516
for the buying of silver, this, that.

00:27:11.516 --> 00:27:15.656
So much of silver I have given, so much gold
that is here is my own.

00:27:15.656 --> 00:27:17.926
Everything, most of the ornaments are my own.

00:27:17.926 --> 00:27:22.546
Now what else I should do?

00:27:22.546 --> 00:27:29.446
Not that I want anything from you, but you
should be responsible and understand.

00:27:29.446 --> 00:27:31.286
All of you should, please.

00:27:31.286 --> 00:27:36.096
If you can really think that this is so important.

00:27:36.096 --> 00:27:41.296
Twelve disciples of Christ worked out Christianity
– only twelve.

00:27:41.296 --> 00:27:47.836
And they were fishermen: how they did it!

00:27:47.836 --> 00:27:56.076
All right, so everybody is telling me that,
“Mother you must talk to them and tell them

00:27:56.076 --> 00:27:58.175
about it."

00:27:59.134 --> 00:28:00.594
So I have told you.

00:28:00.974 --> 00:28:02.803
I have done my job.

00:28:02.803 --> 00:28:08.994
Now it is for you to think what is good and
what should be done.

00:28:08.994 --> 00:28:15.254
Sahaja Yoga is your own: is for your children,
is for your family, is for the country, not

00:28:15.254 --> 00:28:17.444
only [that, but] for the whole world, where
you live.

00:28:17.444 --> 00:28:19.964
You are such a great people who are realised-souls.

00:28:19.964 --> 00:28:24.844
Where are the realised-souls here?

00:28:24.934 --> 00:28:30.694
So have self-esteem, then you will feel responsible,
you know, “I am responsible."

00:28:32.523 --> 00:28:34.233
Thank you very much.

00:28:34.253 --> 00:28:37.243
May God bless you.
