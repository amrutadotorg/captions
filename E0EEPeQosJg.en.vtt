00:29.400 --> 00:35.920
Now the essence of Sahaja Yoga,

00:36.120 --> 00:41.280
I am sure Mr. Gavin Brown must have explained to you what it is.

00:41.480 --> 00:48.000
And so many of you are from Sahaja Yoga itself.

00:48.160 --> 00:53.920
So I need not explain to you all the details.

00:54.160 --> 00:59.600
But today we have to understand one thing

00:59.800 --> 01:04.520
that it’s a very serious time we are born into, extremely serious.

01:04.720 --> 01:08.280
And when we look at life

01:10.360 --> 01:14.280
we do not understand that

01:14.480 --> 01:19.120
if we miss this chance of our evolution,

01:19.320 --> 01:23.520
not only that we’ll miss it for ourselves,

01:23.720 --> 01:27.080
not only that we’ll miss it for England,

01:27.280 --> 01:29.520
or only for one country,

01:29.720 --> 01:33.640
but we’ll miss it for the whole creation.

01:34.320 --> 01:39.520
The trouble is, in the name of God,

01:39.800 --> 01:43.760
in the name of evolution,

01:46.880 --> 01:50.800
in the name of higher life,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.320
so many spurious people have come up

01:54.520 --> 01:59.240
that it has become impossible to convince anyone

01:59.440 --> 02:03.160
that there is something like truth left in it.

02:03.360 --> 02:06.320
Under these circumstances,

02:06.520 --> 02:09.120
one has to talk about truth

02:09.320 --> 02:11.480
and talking about truth

02:11.680 --> 02:15.120
doesn’t give you the experience of the truth at all.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.080
Discussing about it will not give you,

02:18.280 --> 02:22.280
it’s a different realm in which one has to go into,

02:22.480 --> 02:25.280
it’s a new awareness which you have to get,

02:25.480 --> 02:27.320
to understand the truth,

02:27.520 --> 02:31.640
for which I don’t know how many are prepared,

02:31.840 --> 02:34.480
and how many would like to know,

02:34.680 --> 02:39.040
and even if they like to know, how many will get it.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.120
So the problem is the other way round.

02:42.320 --> 02:46.080
It’s not the problem that you have few people,

02:46.280 --> 02:48.640
it’s not the problem

02:48.840 --> 02:52.440
that Sahaja Yoga cannot give you realization,

02:52.640 --> 02:58.160
it’s not the problem that you will not know the truth,

02:58.360 --> 03:01.880
but the whole circumstance is such,

03:02.080 --> 03:06.400
that whatever is false, whatever is spurious,

03:06.600 --> 03:12.040
whatever is silly, stupid, appeals to the masses.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.880
Sometimes I feel I have developed a method

03:15.080 --> 03:18.120
by which I can give really en masse realization

03:18.320 --> 03:19.560
all over the world,

03:19.760 --> 03:21.600
definitely I have.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.840
But the problem as it remains,

03:24.040 --> 03:26.080
the masses are not interested.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.600
It’s only very few who really can keenly take interest

03:30.800 --> 03:33.240
into their evolutionary process

03:33.440 --> 03:36.720
and would like to come out of the ignorance

03:36.920 --> 03:39.600
in which they have been living.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.400
In all the ego-oriented countries

03:42.600 --> 03:45.400
it’s very difficult to establish

03:45.600 --> 03:49.440
that we are still ignorant,

03:49.640 --> 03:52.800
we have to know a lot. It’s very difficult.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.640
Because they think we know everything,

03:54.840 --> 03:58.560
because we have been to the moon. Like the Russians say,

03:58.760 --> 04:03.400
‘We never saw God, we went to the moon, we never saw God.’

04:03.600 --> 04:05.920
It would be like saying that I have come

04:06.120 --> 04:08.720
to the third floor, I haven’t seen God.

04:08.920 --> 04:14.000
Where does God reside? Where it manifest within us?

04:14.200 --> 04:17.880
In what way it manifest, we don’t want to see.

04:18.080 --> 04:21.040
What we want to see is that through our effort,

04:21.240 --> 04:25.880
if we have not been able to see God, then He doesn’t exist.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.640
This is the way our attitude is,

04:28.840 --> 04:33.920
that better say, 'No,' to all that we did not know

04:34.120 --> 04:36.240
through our effort,

04:36.440 --> 04:40.920
because so far we have not known about Him.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.600
So He doesn’t exist.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.480
So you turn round in a cave

04:47.680 --> 04:51.480
when you see the shadows of yourself,

04:51.680 --> 04:53.880
you believe in them only and say,

04:54.080 --> 04:57.760
“It never existed anything else, the light does not exist.”

04:58.000 --> 05:00.400
That kind of an attitude exists

05:00.600 --> 05:05.600
or is persistently I am facing.

05:06.640 --> 05:14.320
And sometimes, I don’t know how to give them realization.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.000
Now as I said, it’s the other way round.

05:18.160 --> 05:21.240
You have to seek. You have to ask for it.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.640
You have to truly ask for it.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.920
Nobody is going to fall at your feet and say,

05:26.120 --> 05:28.120
‘All right, you get your realization.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.920
All right, you have this for heaven’s sake!'

05:32.120 --> 05:33.600
Just have it!

05:33.800 --> 05:35.720
Because nothing is selling here.

05:35.920 --> 05:40.240
We are so much used to the salesmanship, you see,

05:40.440 --> 05:43.800
that we think that if anything is selling,

05:44.000 --> 05:48.840
people have to persuade you, to request you, ask you,

05:49.040 --> 05:52.160
you can save pounds, you see, for sale and all that.

05:52.360 --> 05:56.160
But nothing is for sale.

05:57.440 --> 06:01.640
That’s a very difficult proposition to understand

06:01.840 --> 06:08.240
in the present atmosphere,

06:08.440 --> 06:14.480
where we do not know if you can get anything that is not for sale.

06:16.040 --> 06:21.800
But, I hope slowly and steadily,

06:23.800 --> 06:28.360
all of us have to get it.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.720
Somehow, one has to work very hard. Sometimes it’s very frustrating

06:32.920 --> 06:37.120
and it’s so stupid, the way people react,

06:37.320 --> 06:39.800
that I just don’t know what to say.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.880
Like the other day we had a meeting in Brighton.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.920
I was laughing all the time. But so saddening.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.040
A gentleman came to our program

06:49.240 --> 06:51.560
and he complained, he thought, he said,

06:51.760 --> 06:53.400
‘I was videoed.’

06:53.600 --> 06:57.320
See, who has got time here to put him for a video,

06:57.520 --> 07:00.200
who is interested in taking his photographs? I mean,

07:00.400 --> 07:03.240
he says, ‘I am a managing director.’ So what?

07:03.440 --> 07:07.800
In the presence of Divine, what is a managing director,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.640
what is a king, what is it? Just think of it. Who is he?

07:11.840 --> 07:14.760
What does he think of himself and he has complained against us.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.440
I hope he doesn’t go to police for that.

07:18.640 --> 07:21.680
Even the laws are so stupid sometimes, I can’t understand,

07:21.880 --> 07:27.920
how has he got any right to complain if you come to a program

07:28.120 --> 07:31.880
which is being conducted with a video on Me

07:32.080 --> 07:37.080
and if you are photographed, how can you complain?

07:39.160 --> 07:46.440
One thing I feel that on one side is such stupid,

07:46.640 --> 07:54.600
useless people, the other side are such great seekers.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.920
And how to reach them?

07:57.160 --> 08:02.680
Like a diamond covered with lot of mud.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.840
So much mud. It’s all mud.

08:07.040 --> 08:11.240
In that to find out those diamonds,

08:11.440 --> 08:15.920
to dive into this mire of ignorance,

08:16.120 --> 08:20.000
to get out these diamonds which are lost.

08:20.200 --> 08:25.200
It’s such a concern, that I feel sometimes

08:25.400 --> 08:29.520
that this mud is going to cover their brains, their ego,

08:29.720 --> 08:33.680
everything, and they may not receive their realization.

08:33.880 --> 08:37.280
They may miss this point.

08:37.480 --> 08:41.600
Actually, Divine does not know what human beings have created.

08:41.800 --> 08:43.240
Really, I tell you,

08:43.440 --> 08:47.600
Divine has no ideas what nonsense you have created around.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.320
All kinds of nonsense you have created

08:50.520 --> 08:53.640
out of your ignorance, out of your ego,

08:53.840 --> 08:58.560
out of your choice that you had.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.360
I can’t explain why people have created this kind of ignorance

09:04.560 --> 09:10.600
which cannot be broken, cannot be removed.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.200
Because they are so much identified.

09:14.400 --> 09:19.600
It’s like a stuck-up stamp which cannot come out of people.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.720
And when such a thing happens

09:25.040 --> 09:28.720
you feel, Oh, God!`'

09:28.920 --> 09:32.240
The whole creation has been created,

09:32.440 --> 09:36.040
whole working has taken place,

09:36.920 --> 09:41.000
the human beings have grown so well,

09:41.200 --> 09:44.920
out of a amoeba they have been brought to this stage.

09:45.160 --> 09:50.240
Now in these modern times you find the human beings so stupid,

09:50.440 --> 09:52.240
so foolish,

09:52.440 --> 09:57.280
and deluding others with their stupidity and foolishness.

09:58.320 --> 10:04.280
How are we to approach the people who are true seekers,

10:04.480 --> 10:07.400
have been seekers for ages,

10:07.600 --> 10:12.440
those who have sought for years together,

10:12.640 --> 10:17.600
all their lives before, who are lost?

10:17.800 --> 10:22.680
Sometimes it is very, very disappointing.

10:23.600 --> 10:27.400
But still, hoping against hopes,

10:27.600 --> 10:31.080
I hope we reach all the corners

10:31.280 --> 10:35.200
of this universe where we find

10:35.400 --> 10:40.640
all the people who are true seekers.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.000
It is their right to know,

10:43.200 --> 10:48.480
it is their power to know the Divine.

10:48.680 --> 10:52.600
It’s not for everybody because he’s somebody is a managing director

10:52.800 --> 10:54.640
or a king or anything. What does it matter?

10:54.840 --> 10:58.520
In the presence of God, they’ll be pushed out.

10:58.720 --> 11:02.160
They will not be allowed to enter into the kingdom of God.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.000
Who will be allowed to enter into the kingdom of God?

11:05.200 --> 11:07.880
Those who have known.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.880
Also, not those who just talk about God.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.840
Those who say that

11:15.040 --> 11:18.520
‘We are the worshippers of God, we have learned so much’.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.120
They will say, “All right, go with your books

11:22.320 --> 11:25.120
to the places from where you have come.’

11:25.320 --> 11:27.920
What have you to know is through your awareness,

11:28.160 --> 11:29.680
in your awareness you have to know.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.720
The awareness has to be enlightened.

11:31.920 --> 11:35.600
It is not, what you know with this human awareness,

11:35.800 --> 11:40.200
which is still at a point, I say, has to grow so much.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.280
First it has to be awakened

11:42.480 --> 11:44.840
and then it has to grow in its light.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.480
It’s such a lot of journey we have to do

11:48.680 --> 11:50.880
even after realization.

11:51.080 --> 11:56.360
It takes no time sometimes to give realization to many people.

11:56.560 --> 11:59.200
I know it has happened with so many.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.600
But they don’t know what they have to achieve.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.200
It’s such a horrible stuff is this ego is,

12:04.400 --> 12:08.000
that people don’t want to see what they haven’t got with them,

12:08.200 --> 12:12.920
and what they have to hide, have and what they, they deserve.

12:13.160 --> 12:17.360
They are so identified with ego and satisfied with it,

12:17.560 --> 12:21.440
that they don’t want to see that beauty that lies within them,

12:21.640 --> 12:26.720
the spirit, the reflection of God’s Love

12:26.920 --> 12:33.400
which is like the highest and the most precious thing

12:33.600 --> 12:36.920
that you could think of.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.520
In this England,

12:41.720 --> 12:46.080
I don’t know how many lectures I have given

12:46.280 --> 12:50.360
and how much I have worked hard.

12:51.040 --> 12:55.040
Of course there are results, no doubt. But it is so slow.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.680
Compared to the fake,

12:57.880 --> 13:00.320
compared to the artificial people,

13:00.520 --> 13:03.280
compared to the people who have made money out of you,

13:03.480 --> 13:05.320
those who have exploited you,

13:05.520 --> 13:07.040
have ruined you,

13:07.240 --> 13:12.880
Sahaja Yoga is working so very slowly.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.800
I would not have been so much disappointed

13:16.000 --> 13:18.840
if it was at the time of Christ

13:19.040 --> 13:23.480
because at that time there were very few seekers.

13:23.680 --> 13:30.880
Actually even the fishermen who Christ collected, were not seekers.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.400
You are seekers of the truth.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.920
And so many of you have taken birth

13:36.120 --> 13:38.080
just to seek the truth.

13:38.280 --> 13:42.320
And where are we going? What are we doing about it?

13:42.520 --> 13:46.280
What are our ideas about the truth?

13:46.480 --> 13:53.800
Can we have our own

13:54.520 --> 13:57.920
ideas, conception about the truth?

13:58.120 --> 14:03.720
Is it not that our ego itself has given us lots of ideas?

14:03.920 --> 14:07.360
Is it not that we do not want to see the truth?

14:07.560 --> 14:10.720
I meet all kinds of people in this country.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.400
I must say they are very highly placed, very great,

14:14.600 --> 14:17.520
somebody is a lord and somebody is a lady

14:17.720 --> 14:22.080
and somebody is another huge personality, and this and that.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.400
But, they said, ‘ Who wants to change? ’

14:25.600 --> 14:28.400
I said, “Really. That’s true.”

14:28.600 --> 14:32.120
Because they think they are the greatest people ever born

14:32.320 --> 14:36.280
and they’re going to take all their lordship with them to the heaven.

14:36.480 --> 14:39.000
They said, ‘Who wants to change? ’

14:39.200 --> 14:44.720
I said then, "Such a lot can be said on the point,

14:44.920 --> 14:46.920
but if you don’t want to change,

14:47.120 --> 14:49.320
that’s a full stop, complete full stop."

14:49.520 --> 14:51.480
You cannot talk to them.

14:51.680 --> 14:55.720
Now this, I must say is -

14:56.240 --> 15:04.120
only can work out with people who are seekers,

15:05.600 --> 15:11.680
who want to know, through their awareness, what is the truth.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.560
You have to know your spirit.

15:14.760 --> 15:19.640
Without knowing your spirit, you cannot know what is the truth.

15:19.840 --> 15:24.520
Whatever I may talk to you is a waste, complete waste

15:24.720 --> 15:29.200
because you haven’t got that awareness today,

15:29.400 --> 15:32.000
to know what I am talking about.

15:32.200 --> 15:37.080
So, first thing is: I request you to become the spirit.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.200
Is simple thing as that.

15:39.400 --> 15:46.680
Like now I have to see into your skin for example,

15:46.880 --> 15:50.240
I’ll have to use a microscope.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.720
And then people will say, ‘All right,you see through the microscope

15:53.920 --> 15:57.360
you cannot see with your naked eyes.’

15:57.560 --> 16:00.720
All right? Supposing I want to listen to somebody’s heart,

16:00.920 --> 16:03.240
then people will say, ‘Use a stethoscope,

16:03.440 --> 16:06.840
otherwise you cannot listen to somebody’s heart.’

16:07.040 --> 16:09.520
All right. You don’t question that time do you,

16:09.720 --> 16:11.560
you just put it there and try to listen.

16:11.760 --> 16:17.520
In the same way, why not we do about the spirit,

16:17.800 --> 16:22.600
why not we do what it is told to you,

16:22.800 --> 16:26.720
that you have to get your realization,

16:26.920 --> 16:29.800
that you have to become the spirit first,

16:30.000 --> 16:33.360
that unless and until this awareness is enlightened

16:33.560 --> 16:35.880
by the spirit, you cannot see.

16:36.080 --> 16:41.160
Is like telling something about the coulors to a blind,

16:41.360 --> 16:44.280
you have to open your eyes,

16:44.480 --> 16:50.000
but this simple thing also people don’t accept.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.080
The reason is people are very naive.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.000
They don’t know, what is it,

16:57.200 --> 17:01.920
and also they don’t want to understand.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.720
Now as you see a tree standing there

17:05.920 --> 17:08.000
and so many trees are there,

17:08.200 --> 17:13.000
you must also know, that there are roots to it.

17:13.200 --> 17:17.440
But somebody has told you there are roots.

17:17.640 --> 17:22.200
You may not believe into it, but why not see, is the point.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.040
Why not see if there are roots or not?

17:25.240 --> 17:29.080
Supposing I say, “ Whatever you are outside,

17:29.280 --> 17:31.800
you are much more inside.”

17:32.000 --> 17:33.880
So why not we see it?

17:34.080 --> 17:37.280
This is a simple question we should ask ourselves,

17:37.480 --> 17:41.240
‘Why should I put any barrier to that seeing,

17:41.440 --> 17:47.080
if that is going to give me all the best in this world?

17:47.280 --> 17:50.640
If it is going to give me

17:50.840 --> 17:52.680
even the inkling

17:52.880 --> 17:55.320
of that beautiful thing called spirit,

17:55.520 --> 17:57.320
why not have it?’

17:57.520 --> 18:01.280
You don’t have to pay for it, you don’t have to exert for it,

18:01.480 --> 18:05.080
you don’t have to do anything, but you have to desire.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.000
This is the point I am trying to make,

18:07.200 --> 18:10.120
that if you do not desire from your heart,

18:10.320 --> 18:13.400
then God is not going to fall at your feet,

18:13.600 --> 18:16.680
now please desire for Me, is He?

18:16.880 --> 18:19.400
It’s a simple thing like that

18:19.600 --> 18:21.920
and if you people understand

18:22.120 --> 18:24.640
that you have to really desire it,

18:24.840 --> 18:27.600
because it’s such a vicious circle I must tell you,

18:27.800 --> 18:31.280
that this kundalini - is not here the picture -

18:31.480 --> 18:38.440
the kundalini is the pure desire within you.

18:38.640 --> 18:42.880
Is the desire which is not yet manifested,

18:43.080 --> 18:47.040
it is not yet awakened in the sense that it is acting,

18:47.240 --> 18:50.440
but it has not acted.

18:51.280 --> 18:54.480
So, if so, how much important it is

18:54.680 --> 18:57.080
that you should have the desire

18:57.280 --> 19:02.280
to be one with the Divine, to be in Yoga,

19:02.480 --> 19:04.720
to be one with your spirit.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.160
The desire has to be strong,

19:07.360 --> 19:09.400
if it is not a strong desire

19:09.600 --> 19:13.600
you are challenging your own kundalini, you are anti-kundalini

19:13.800 --> 19:16.080
and then the kundalini won’t rise.

19:16.280 --> 19:20.000
But what is this brain has achieved so far, just look at it.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.880
You must understand, what have we achieved by this brain?

19:23.080 --> 19:26.440
For example, this stupid managing director whosoever came there,

19:26.640 --> 19:30.280
just ask him what good has he done to anyone?

19:30.480 --> 19:33.200
What does he know about spiritual life?

19:33.400 --> 19:36.880
What does he understand about Christ’s life?’

19:37.080 --> 19:38.680
But if he sends a letter,

19:38.880 --> 19:40.800
the newspaper is very willing to write it down.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.920
I mean look at the stupidity of the whole stuff.

19:44.160 --> 19:49.520
Without understanding that anything that has to go to the masses

19:49.720 --> 19:54.320
should be something sensible, from a sensible man,

19:54.520 --> 19:56.920
who is supposed to be an authority

19:57.160 --> 19:59.520
on spiritual life that he is talking about.

19:59.720 --> 20:03.160
What good this fellow has done, nobody reads that.

20:03.360 --> 20:07.280
But if I write something or any Sahaja Yogi says that, "see

20:07.480 --> 20:10.640
by coming to Sahaja Yoga we dropped down all our bad habits,

20:10.840 --> 20:12.720
I got cured of my cancer" or anything

20:12.920 --> 20:15.400
nobody wants to listen to you. They think you are mad.

20:15.600 --> 20:19.520
But a man like that, if he writes, then they publish it.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.880
So it shows very clearly

20:22.080 --> 20:25.200
that you see we are living with people

20:25.400 --> 20:30.080
who are really not only mad but are absolutely foolish people,

20:30.280 --> 20:34.320
who have no sense at all as to how they have to live

20:34.520 --> 20:37.440
and how they have to move.

20:37.640 --> 20:43.560
This is what we have come to know about so many people now,

20:43.760 --> 20:48.360
that sometimes you people have to take upon yourself

20:48.560 --> 20:52.880
to go into it and find out what is the truth.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.200
It is you who have to find it out.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.560
You see, it would be something like that, I say now,

20:58.760 --> 21:01.480
`This is a place where there are lots of diamonds',

21:01.680 --> 21:04.560
say, I say that. Or:`This is a cave in which,

21:04.760 --> 21:08.920
if you move there is a lot of, say - gold.'

21:09.160 --> 21:13.160
Now the gold is not going to come out from there, is it?

21:13.360 --> 21:14.720
Simple as that.

21:14.920 --> 21:18.360
You have to go towards the gold to find it out or not.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.080
You have to go towards it,

21:20.280 --> 21:23.360
but here I’m not saying that you walk towards anything

21:23.560 --> 21:27.440
or do anything like that, just you have to desire,

21:27.640 --> 21:31.000
and desire it from your heart.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.880
Is impossible for me to work out kundalini

21:34.080 --> 21:37.000
if you do not desire, because the desire,

21:37.200 --> 21:39.840
the pure desire, is the kundalini.

21:40.040 --> 21:44.160
You understand My problem is now. Pure desire is the kundalini

21:44.360 --> 21:47.120
and if you are against your pure desire,

21:47.320 --> 21:50.160
what can I do about it? Can I force it?

21:50.360 --> 21:53.680
You cannot push it out, you see? Like a seed,

21:53.880 --> 21:57.200
if you have to, if you want to have a seed sprouted,

21:57.400 --> 21:59.240
you have to put it in the Mother Earth,

21:59.440 --> 22:01.720
but you cannot take it out

22:01.920 --> 22:04.840
the bits of the seed and sprout it, can you?

22:05.040 --> 22:08.920
It’s a living process and for this living process

22:09.120 --> 22:12.000
you have to have a pure desire.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.560
And if that desire is not there,

22:14.760 --> 22:18.480
I am breaking My head against stones, I feel.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.240
So it is important that you understand

22:21.440 --> 22:25.640
that you must have that desire which is the highest.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.840
But if you are satisfied with things

22:28.040 --> 22:31.160
which are useless and nonsensical,

22:31.360 --> 22:33.200
then what am I to do with that?

22:33.400 --> 22:35.400
Now you just tell Me with someone

22:35.600 --> 22:38.240
who is interested in things which are nonsensical,

22:38.440 --> 22:40.160
now how do you bring them round?

22:40.360 --> 22:43.360
I mean, there is no psychology that can bring them round,

22:43.560 --> 22:47.480
you see, because you have to have the desire to be all right.

22:47.680 --> 22:50.440
But this is something so innate,

22:50.640 --> 22:55.280
being the process itself is a living process

22:55.480 --> 22:56.920
and doesn’t work out

22:57.160 --> 22:59.320
if the people do not have the pure desire.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.040
Now this written down since long.

23:02.240 --> 23:05.560
It cannot be changed, it cannot be forced,

23:05.760 --> 23:10.280
it cannot be sort of explained or discussed,

23:10.480 --> 23:14.280
or argued, nothing can be done; it has to work out within you.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.400
Now even when you have worked it out on someone,

23:17.600 --> 23:20.840
you may not achieve the results. That’s possible.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.200
You may, you may not.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.560
So, when the situation is so difficult

23:25.760 --> 23:29.600
and where the children are also so adamant,

23:29.800 --> 23:32.320
then what can Mother do?

23:32.520 --> 23:34.160
Is to push them in.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.200
See, I am very much concerned,

23:36.400 --> 23:40.560
that this ego which is sometimes so selfish

23:40.760 --> 23:42.440
and so conceited,

23:42.640 --> 23:46.200
that it satisfies itself and it’s very happy,

23:46.400 --> 23:49.240
it will not allow you to get to the, that point

23:49.440 --> 23:53.040
where you really stand, where you have all your powers,

23:53.240 --> 23:57.120
where you are the master of your being. It will not allow.

23:57.320 --> 24:00.360
The identification with the ego is so much,

24:00.560 --> 24:04.360
that’s easy to take a bull by the horn

24:04.560 --> 24:08.040
but to take an ego-oriented man through Sahaja Yoga’s practices

24:08.240 --> 24:10.840
is very difficult.

24:12.560 --> 24:19.120
I am rather today in a mood of,

24:19.320 --> 24:23.720
I should say little disgust, I should say,

24:23.920 --> 24:27.000
but also the other mood comes on me

24:27.160 --> 24:32.800
of complete compassion and tremendous love.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.760
That somehow I should do something to bring

24:38.000 --> 24:41.080
sense into the heads of these people.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.560
Something should happen to them

24:44.760 --> 24:48.640
because otherwise what I see is a complete disaster.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.400
It’s going to come, believe Me, it’s going to come.

24:51.600 --> 24:56.080
I don’t want to frighten you like Mrs. Thatcher does about Russians.

24:56.280 --> 25:00.720
That might be imaginary. But this is real and I am telling you

25:00.920 --> 25:05.840
it’s going to come to us. It will come as diseases, selfdestruction.

25:06.040 --> 25:09.560
But the greatest thing is the failure of the Divine Itself

25:09.760 --> 25:13.920
that it could not communicate with you people,

25:14.120 --> 25:16.040
who were made specially,

25:16.240 --> 25:19.240
who were brought to this earth on this time,

25:19.440 --> 25:21.880
who have to have the kingdom of heaven.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.880
And suddenly you find they all dropped out of the sieve.

25:29.800 --> 25:35.200
Sahaja Yogis also sometimes feel very frustrated, I know.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.400
But whatever it is, as far as I am concerned,

25:38.600 --> 25:40.720
I have tremendous desire now.

25:40.920 --> 25:44.920
But I am so desireless, that this desire also may not work out.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.000
You see, I am a desireless person.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.440
Now what to do?

25:48.640 --> 25:51.120
So I ask Sahaja Yogis to desire

25:51.320 --> 25:54.720
that the people should have that great desire

25:54.920 --> 25:56.920
to become the spirit.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.720
This is the greatest thing

25:58.920 --> 26:03.360
that we can give to our brothers and sisters,

26:03.560 --> 26:08.240
to the progeny, to the people who are children today,

26:08.440 --> 26:10.840
to this beautiful world.

26:11.040 --> 26:14.760
We need these beautiful lights

26:15.000 --> 26:20.720
and the beautiful time which they all have to enjoy.

26:20.920 --> 26:24.680
I hope those who have come for the first time

26:24.880 --> 26:26.920
will understand My difficulty

26:27.120 --> 26:31.680
and will try to see that you desire

26:31.880 --> 26:35.880
only your Self-realization and nothing else.

26:36.080 --> 26:40.440
Just desire that. I request you to desire your Self-realization

26:40.640 --> 26:44.360
and forget about everything, even if you are managing director

26:44.560 --> 26:47.000
or may be the King George the Vth, you see?

26:47.200 --> 26:49.760
Better keep all your shoes outside about it,

26:50.000 --> 26:56.480
and just desire that you become the spirit.

26:56.680 --> 27:03.640
You see the difference between Me and Christ is here:

27:03.840 --> 27:08.720
He got so fed up that He said, "Let Me be crucified."

27:08.920 --> 27:12.120
I mean of course it was in the plan that He should be crucified also

27:12.320 --> 27:15.240
but I mean that won’t solve the problem now.

27:15.440 --> 27:19.000
I have to see that you all get your resurrection somehow.

27:19.200 --> 27:22.840
It’s like a mother’s desire who wants to give a bath to the child

27:23.040 --> 27:25.240
and get him cleansed somehow, you see.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.480
So whichever way you like – whether you like a chocolate

27:28.680 --> 27:31.600
or whether you like a little rebuking

27:31.800 --> 27:35.040
or whatever way you like, I am willing to work it out,

27:35.240 --> 27:39.120
but please at least desire that you have to have

27:39.320 --> 27:41.600
your Self-realization.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.320
May God bless you all.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.720
I hope those who get realization

27:45.920 --> 27:48.000
will settle down with it seriously,

27:48.200 --> 27:50.640
understand it is your responsibility today

27:50.840 --> 27:53.520
that you are born today here in this country,

27:53.720 --> 27:57.120
which is a special thing for Me and for Sahaja Yoga,

27:57.320 --> 28:00.760
and that you should get your Self-realization,

28:01.000 --> 28:04.800
understand it very well and digest it and go into it

28:05.000 --> 28:11.640
and become a very, very powerful personality that you have to be.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.080
But even a small thing like that, they said,

28:14.280 --> 28:16.160
‘You take out your shoes.’ Because, you see,

28:16.360 --> 28:18.800
shoes make you little bit tightened up.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.040
Even that much if you ask them, oh, they,

28:22.240 --> 28:26.000
as if I’ve asked a hundred pounds from them!

28:26.200 --> 28:29.080
Even that little thing they don’t want to do

28:29.280 --> 28:31.200
and why are they here, I don’t understand,

28:31.400 --> 28:33.560
all the way they come for what?

28:33.760 --> 28:35.720
You don’t want to get your realization?

28:35.920 --> 28:43.320
You don’t want to get the greatest blessing of the Divine?

28:43.520 --> 28:47.040
Then what am I to do? How am I to deal with you?

28:47.240 --> 28:51.120
You may be very well educated person, all right, a learned man,

28:51.320 --> 28:54.520
but you have not known so far.

28:55.440 --> 28:58.080
It happens with gurus, it happens with everyone,

28:58.280 --> 29:00.000
they are sticking on to a guru;

29:00.200 --> 29:01.320
they are sticking on to a guru

29:01.520 --> 29:03.400
they cannot give up that guru, whatever it is,

29:03.600 --> 29:06.800
is another kind of a ego because they think of,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.080
‘All right, we have eaten the crow; so what

29:09.280 --> 29:11.360
if we have eaten the crow, we have eaten the crow!

29:11.560 --> 29:14.680
So, go ahead with it.’ This is another category of people

29:14.880 --> 29:18.640
who don’t want to give up whatever is nonsensical.

29:18.840 --> 29:22.360
Then the third category is another one who are just waiting,

29:22.560 --> 29:26.200
‘All right, let the catastrophe come.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.880
We are just waiting.’ I mean, they told Me,

29:29.080 --> 29:30.720
‘Mother, doesn’t matter, don’t You worry,

29:30.920 --> 29:33.120
we are all waiting for the catastrophe,

29:33.320 --> 29:35.880
disaster.When is it going to arrive? You just tell us that.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.400
We are all anxiously waiting.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.240
If it is coming, it’s a very good thing,

29:39.440 --> 29:41.920
now we are reconciled to a situation like that.’

29:42.160 --> 29:44.040
On the streets of Paris, if you go there,

29:44.240 --> 29:45.840
you find many like that, discussing,

29:46.040 --> 29:48.160
when are the ten stars going to meet

29:48.400 --> 29:54.680
so that we are all collided and made into a jam.

29:56.040 --> 29:59.160
We won’t be made into a jam, I must tell you,

29:59.360 --> 30:03.480
but something horrible which is thousand times worse

30:03.680 --> 30:09.160
than what you are doing on the streets of Paris.

30:09.360 --> 30:17.160
But this kind of attitude of three types of people,

30:17.360 --> 30:21.680
I don’t know, I may, I’m thinking, now I have been in London

30:21.880 --> 30:26.120
for so many days and My going time is coming

30:26.320 --> 30:29.120
and I don’t know what’s going to happen now,

30:29.320 --> 30:30.920
because Sahaja Yogis themselves are desperate

30:31.160 --> 30:33.280
and they all want to settle down in India.

30:33.480 --> 30:37.880
I will not allow them to settle down in India unless and until

30:38.080 --> 30:42.400
they at least get half of the English people realized.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.000
Yes, that’s for very sure.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.000
If you think that now Mother has gone there,

30:49.200 --> 30:52.120
so let us take our baggage there and let settle down

30:52.320 --> 30:55.200
in a nice little ashram enjoying yourself, nothing doing!

30:55.400 --> 30:56.680
You have to work hard.

30:56.880 --> 31:00.040
You have to get at least half of the British people realized

31:00.240 --> 31:03.120
somehow; if you can’t do it, you’re not allowed

31:03.320 --> 31:10.080
to enjoy any rest and I, too, will not be able to have any rest

31:10.280 --> 31:13.800
in My lifetime, if these things do not happen.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.920
I hope you all understand My concern,

31:18.160 --> 31:24.840
My great concern and My love for British people here

31:25.040 --> 31:28.360
who must understand also their place

31:28.560 --> 31:32.600
in this great work of God, how they should come up.

31:32.840 --> 31:33.920
May God bless you all.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.600
I'll have some water to drink.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.040
I think I'll be better off here.

31:42.560 --> 31:43.840
Better sit.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.000
I'm very much better here.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.600
Any questions? Please!

31:56.600 --> 32:00.680
So, you are here? So nice to see you!

32:06.680 --> 32:09.360
What's happening in the Isle of Wight?

32:12.120 --> 32:13.160
Are you there?

32:13.360 --> 32:14.440
Me?

32:14.640 --> 32:17.720
I don’t live in Isle of Wight. I'm from Hampstead.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.520
We have some people there? I don't know.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.360
We have to try all kinds of things.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.040
Now, what's the question is?

32:46.440 --> 32:49.720
I can't read your minds. Please tell me.

33:06.120 --> 33:08.000
It's all right. They are all right there.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.080
What's the question?

33:21.160 --> 33:23.000
No questions?

33:25.400 --> 33:26.760
There could be a question:

33:27.440 --> 33:30.600
"How to have the desire?"

33:32.040 --> 33:36.080
Isn't it? If somebody asked me a question like that,

33:36.280 --> 33:39.000
"How to have the desire, Mother, tell us?", you see, it would be,

33:39.160 --> 33:42.680
"How to have the desire to eat the icecream?", you see?

33:53.000 --> 33:55.880
Sometimes you don't know whether to cry or to laugh.

33:56.800 --> 33:57.920
It's like that.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.840
How many people have come for the first time? Please raise your hands.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.920
Lots of them. Good, good, good...

34:15.520 --> 34:18.000
I would say, those who have come the first time should come forward

34:18.200 --> 34:20.600
and sahaja yogis should go back.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.680
Mohan, you can go back.

34:25.080 --> 34:27.160
Who else is there? Haan, you go back.

34:37.160 --> 34:40.000
Yes, come along. Sit down, sit down, sit down.

34:40.200 --> 34:42.320
Here.

34:43.800 --> 34:47.160
First or second row, please be seated.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.600
Will you be comfortable? Sure?

34:51.800 --> 34:52.800
Yes, yes...

34:53.640 --> 34:55.440
Will you be comfortable there, down below?

34:55.640 --> 34:57.480
No, you can sit in the second row, if you want

34:57.680 --> 35:01.120
and if you are not comfortable, it is not easy to sit on the ground.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.560
Why don't you put the chairs around, like that?

35:04.760 --> 35:07.320
So they'll get you some chairs there and some chairs here

35:07.520 --> 35:10.720
Can you bring here some chairs, in the first line?

35:15.680 --> 35:17.240
Just put it there, now.

35:18.880 --> 35:19.880
You can bring it...

35:20.080 --> 35:22.160
[MOTHER SPEAKS HINDI]

35:22.360 --> 35:25.360
They are stuck together Mother.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.160
What's about - they are fixed?

35:27.240 --> 35:29.720
- Yes.
- What?

35:30.200 --> 35:31.200
Fixed, hai?

35:31.720 --> 35:33.120
I'm sorry for that.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.400
The whole thing, you can bring it, yes, yes.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.640
Better sit there, you have to be comfortable, my child.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.320
Better be there. You will be comfortable.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.640
You have to be comfortable, that's first thing.

35:57.840 --> 36:00.560
Right? Wherever you are comfortable, please be seated.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.720
It’s good to see so many new people.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.920
It's such a great thing.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.280
That's all, that's all, they don't want...

36:21.480 --> 36:24.560
They, they are... They say they are happy here.

36:41.560 --> 36:42.560
Now...

36:44.760 --> 36:46.240
Is a very simple thing

36:47.000 --> 36:51.320
that Kundalini is to be awakened within you

36:51.680 --> 36:53.520
because she's there,

36:54.440 --> 36:56.360
she has been there

36:57.160 --> 37:01.640
and she gets awakened by itself,

37:01.880 --> 37:05.480
spontanous, don't have to do anything. It's all yours.

37:05.840 --> 37:09.080
Only thing, as Gavin must have told you that

37:09.280 --> 37:11.600
an enlightened light can enlighten another light.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.200
In the same way,

37:13.480 --> 37:18.040
if I am an enlightened person, you should get your enlightenment.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.320
And it works in no time, should work in no time.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.760
If you can put your hands just like this,

37:26.120 --> 37:28.040
now, I must give you explanation,

37:28.280 --> 37:31.040
I'm not going to take anything from you.

37:31.240 --> 37:34.680
It's just because these fingers denote your centers.

37:34.880 --> 37:39.320
These are five fingers, six and seven are the left side

37:39.560 --> 37:42.160
centers, these are right side centers.

37:42.440 --> 37:46.040
When they are crossed together, you form the central path

37:46.480 --> 37:49.440
which is the one we call as the Sushumna.

37:49.720 --> 37:54.000
Now the central path manifests what we call in

37:54.280 --> 37:58.240
the medical terminology as parasympathetic nervous system.

37:58.600 --> 38:05.040
Now, this central path is - has got one left and one right

38:05.400 --> 38:06.720
in - on one center.

38:06.920 --> 38:11.320
So, what we do is to put our hands like this

38:11.520 --> 38:15.080
so that these ends, which are receptive,

38:15.400 --> 38:17.840
are the ends of the sympathetic nervous system,

38:18.280 --> 38:21.640
so the left and the right sympathetic system gets enlightened

38:21.880 --> 38:24.920
which is fixed here, like this, you see?

38:25.400 --> 38:29.360
So what we do is to just put your hands like this,

38:30.000 --> 38:31.120
towards Me,

38:31.480 --> 38:33.760
without putting any pressure or anything,

38:34.080 --> 38:36.400
on your lap. Be comfortable.

38:37.760 --> 38:38.880
Be comfortable.

38:40.240 --> 38:44.040
Now, you may have to loosen little bit if there is something tight

38:44.240 --> 38:46.640
or making you uncomfortable, that's all.

38:46.920 --> 38:47.560
And the feet,

38:47.760 --> 38:51.440
is better if you are sitting on the ground is all right or any way,

38:51.640 --> 38:54.200
but if they are on the Mother Earth, it helps.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.840
But if you like it, like you are sitting, is all right,

38:58.040 --> 39:01.360
doesn't matter. Put your hands straight like this.

39:01.800 --> 39:06.600
Makes no difference whatever way you have been putting your hands,

39:06.760 --> 39:11.200
just the fingers should come towards Me, that's all.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.120
Facing towards Me.

39:13.440 --> 39:16.440
Now, it doesn't matter from what race, creed,

39:16.680 --> 39:18.840
coulor, whatever way you are coming here.

39:19.360 --> 39:22.320
And also doesn't matter whatever you have done before.

39:22.560 --> 39:25.480
Now, we are here at this present moment.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.400
This moment is important for Me.

39:28.600 --> 39:32.600
At this moment, you are here

39:32.920 --> 39:38.320
to jump into the new awareness of Self-realization.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.480
So, this is the most important time -

39:41.840 --> 39:43.560
for Me and for you.

39:44.040 --> 39:48.000
At this time, forget about the past and the future.

39:48.280 --> 39:51.800
Say, somebody thinks that he is guilty

39:52.000 --> 39:53.800
of something, I mean that's a fashion these days,

39:54.000 --> 39:55.320
to feel guilty is a fashion.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.840
In the West it's a fashion.

39:57.040 --> 39:59.520
Just for nothing, why to feel guilty, I can't understand.

39:59.680 --> 40:03.680
An Indian will never feel guilty, you know, whatever they may do.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.800
And this fashion of feeling guilty

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
really clutches Me from here to here sometimes

40:10.160 --> 40:12.720
when I am talking to the Western people.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.520
At the first outset

40:14.720 --> 40:18.560
you must know that you are not guilty at all in the presence of God.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.880
In the eyes of God you are not guilty

40:21.080 --> 40:23.760
and you have no business to condemn yourself,

40:23.920 --> 40:28.680
because you are going to be the temple of God.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.440
And now don't feel guilty about yourself.

40:31.640 --> 40:36.400
You have not even made your nose, what are you feeling guilty about?

40:37.400 --> 40:41.560
So just have a very cheerful disposition about yourself,

40:42.240 --> 40:43.760
that you are not guilty,

40:44.240 --> 40:46.840
that you are going to be the spirit,

40:47.480 --> 40:49.680
the beauty, the glory that you are.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.280
And there is no need to feel guilty at all!

40:52.480 --> 40:54.800
Is very important. At the very outset,

40:55.120 --> 40:57.440
I will request you not to feel guilty.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.160
That's first thing you have to do.

41:00.440 --> 41:01.880
Sincerely

41:02.040 --> 41:04.440
you have to say to yourself, "I'm not guilty at all".

41:04.680 --> 41:07.160
Because there's a big block here sitting, just now,

41:07.360 --> 41:09.320
into everybody's left side.

41:09.520 --> 41:11.320
And that's how they get spondylitis

41:11.520 --> 41:13.880
so much so that I may get one day spondylitis,

41:14.080 --> 41:15.480
the way people are getting it.

41:15.760 --> 41:19.440
So we are not to feel guilty at all, we have to decide on that point.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.160
Whatever people might have told you,

41:22.440 --> 41:26.520
that we are the greatest sinners or whatever it is,

41:27.120 --> 41:30.320
in the presence of God's love

41:31.160 --> 41:35.000
we cannot feel guilty, because we challenge His powers

41:35.600 --> 41:36.680
of forgiveness.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.720
He has a power to forgive,

41:41.040 --> 41:45.360
and He forgives such big sins that what sins can we commit, isn't it?

41:46.040 --> 41:47.040
So just don't feel guilty,

41:47.160 --> 41:50.400
that is the first thing I have explained to you.

41:50.920 --> 41:52.360
By reading all these horrible books

41:52.560 --> 41:54.760
I think people also start feeling guilty.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.800
I don't know how, what are the... what are the sources are,

41:58.080 --> 41:59.280
but is a very common practice,

41:59.480 --> 42:02.080
I don't know where they sell this business of guilt

42:02.280 --> 42:05.640
but definitely people are feeling guilty for nothing at all.

42:05.920 --> 42:09.080
So I would request you not to feel guilty,

42:09.560 --> 42:13.200
put your hands towards Me and just close your eyes.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.400
Just close your eyes.

42:19.640 --> 42:22.200
Now, how do I manage it?

42:22.800 --> 42:23.920
I must tell you now.

42:24.520 --> 42:25.880
Is very simple for Me.

42:26.520 --> 42:29.120
What I do, that, with My attention,

42:29.320 --> 42:32.160
I put you, all of you, in My heart.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.840
I can do it.

42:34.080 --> 42:37.720
Supposing you know how to put someone in your heart,

42:38.240 --> 42:40.200
you can also do it very easy.

42:40.520 --> 42:42.120
You are all in My heart.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.800
Supposing I conceive you in My heart, you can say like that,

42:46.040 --> 42:47.600
and raise My Kundalini,

42:48.120 --> 42:52.680
and bring it to the fontanelle bone area

42:52.920 --> 42:57.800
where resides the seat of My spirit

42:58.280 --> 42:59.560
and then touches,

42:59.880 --> 43:01.480
My own Kundalini

43:04.200 --> 43:05.200
touches

43:06.000 --> 43:08.560
the spirit, the seat of the spirit,

43:09.480 --> 43:11.160
and when it happens,

43:12.040 --> 43:17.760
then you all feel that you have got your realization.

43:18.800 --> 43:21.000
You feel the realization.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.200
This is how it happens.

43:29.840 --> 43:32.320
But when you people get your realization,

43:32.600 --> 43:34.640
you also get the same powers.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.800
And you can give realization to others

43:38.320 --> 43:42.120
just by raising your hands behind the back of the people

43:42.480 --> 43:44.040
whom you want to give realization.

43:44.240 --> 43:47.560
It is a very simple method worked out very simply,

43:47.760 --> 43:51.000
by nature, by the living process of evolution.

43:51.720 --> 43:54.200
Now close your eyes properly,

43:54.840 --> 43:57.280
put your hands towards Me.

43:58.280 --> 43:59.560
As a result of this,

43:59.760 --> 44:05.240
first thing, you start noticing in your thoughts,

44:05.680 --> 44:09.880
ask your mind, "What are you thinking?"

44:11.080 --> 44:12.520
Keep your eyes shut, fully,

44:13.040 --> 44:14.160
that's important.

44:24.280 --> 44:26.720
You'll find that there is no answer.

44:27.200 --> 44:30.120
In many of you, you'll find that the answers are running away.

44:30.560 --> 44:31.800
When you are trying to catch

44:32.120 --> 44:35.880
the answer, there is no answer, is all running away.

44:36.240 --> 44:39.000
That's the best situation.

44:39.360 --> 44:42.680
When the mind is resting for the change, you see, it's not thinking.

44:51.080 --> 44:56.560
When this has happened within you, then we have to start

44:57.920 --> 44:59.280
acting on our desire.

44:59.760 --> 45:04.560
So the left hand represents the desire that we have,

45:04.800 --> 45:06.920
so keep the left hand fixed towards Me

45:07.160 --> 45:10.200
and with the right hand now you have to act.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.440
Don't open your eyes at any cost,

45:12.640 --> 45:16.360
please don't open your eyes at any cost.

45:16.720 --> 45:19.440
Put your right hand on your heart.

45:19.640 --> 45:23.760
If you're wearing a coat, put your hand inside the coat.

45:24.360 --> 45:26.920
Put it on your heart on the left-hand side.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.480
Put the left hand straight towards Me.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.760
Stretched out, now.

45:33.080 --> 45:38.680
Now you have to ask a question to yourself in your heart,

45:39.920 --> 45:41.720
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

45:42.000 --> 45:43.280
Ask the question. Which you are!

45:43.440 --> 45:46.120
But you better ask the question in the beginning because the

45:46.480 --> 45:49.160
attitude just now is:

45:49.680 --> 45:52.000
Whether I am the spirit or not,

45:52.400 --> 45:54.560
even if the Mother says, you need not believe it.

45:54.880 --> 45:56.680
So just say, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

45:56.880 --> 45:59.800
Keep your eyes shut fully.

46:01.520 --> 46:04.280
Ask sincerely.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.920
Now, if you are the spirit,

46:20.240 --> 46:23.240
then you have to be your master also.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.640
Now you can put the same hand

46:26.080 --> 46:30.440
down below on another center on the left-hand side on the stomach.

46:30.680 --> 46:33.920
On the stomach on the left-hand side quite lower,

46:34.160 --> 46:39.920
and ask a question in the center on the left-hand side,

46:40.240 --> 46:42.240
in the central part of the stomach,

46:42.480 --> 46:44.400
and ask a question,

46:44.600 --> 46:47.440
"Mother, am I my own master?"

46:47.880 --> 46:51.120
"Am I my own guru?"

47:32.240 --> 47:35.720
Ask this question at least ten times.

47:39.040 --> 47:42.240
Sincerely, from your heart, with confidence,

47:42.600 --> 47:48.400
ask the question, "Mother, am I my own master?"

47:58.320 --> 48:02.040
Now, put the right hand again on your heart.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.760
Now, at this point,

48:06.440 --> 48:08.760
you have to confidently say

48:09.160 --> 48:11.520
that "Mother, I am the spirit."

48:11.880 --> 48:15.120
You have to confidently say that "Mother, I am the spirit."

48:15.320 --> 48:17.600
Say it twelve times please.

48:17.920 --> 48:21.120
"Mother, I am the spirit!" You are the spirit.

48:21.560 --> 48:23.920
Everyone has said that you are the spirit.

48:24.240 --> 48:26.320
And you are to be born

48:26.720 --> 48:27.760
again.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.280
Just assert.

49:11.400 --> 49:15.760
Now raise your right hand higher

49:16.080 --> 49:19.640
onto the base of your neck, the left side.

49:19.920 --> 49:23.640
Again, we are working on the left because of the desire.

49:24.080 --> 49:26.360
Base of the neck on the left-hand side,

49:26.680 --> 49:31.240
where I told you is a big block of guilt.

49:31.880 --> 49:34.880
Now if you are the spirit, how can you be guilty?

49:35.880 --> 49:38.040
Because the spirit never commits sins,

49:38.680 --> 49:39.720
is guiltless,

49:39.920 --> 49:40.920
is perfect,

49:41.280 --> 49:42.280
is absolute.

49:42.840 --> 49:44.280
So now you say "Mother,"

49:45.560 --> 49:47.080
"I'm not guilty"

49:47.640 --> 49:49.400
with full confidence and sixteen times,

49:49.600 --> 49:52.080
and if you have been too much guilty, say it thirty-two times.

49:54.880 --> 49:55.920
That's...

49:56.120 --> 49:57.280
That's a better punishment.

49:57.600 --> 49:59.720
'Cause I am suffering because of your guilt.

50:05.880 --> 50:08.840
For anything, even for smoking or drinking or anything,

50:08.920 --> 50:11.880
don't feel guilty. Forget it.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.840
Serious or trivial things, don't feel guilty.

50:22.880 --> 50:24.920
You have to respect yourself, isn't it?

50:25.320 --> 50:26.560
If you are the spirit.

50:34.840 --> 50:35.840
Now.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.000
Better now.

50:52.760 --> 50:54.760
Because you really don't know what you are,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.640
that's why you are feeling guil... guilty, I really tell you.

50:58.720 --> 51:00.920
When you will know what you are,

51:01.360 --> 51:03.280
you'll be enamored

51:04.200 --> 51:05.280
to know.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.560
Please believe Me.

51:12.440 --> 51:15.400
Don't condemn yourself at all.

51:19.920 --> 51:21.280
No confessions.

51:22.760 --> 51:26.560
And no past to be brought in just now. Please forget the past.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.080
Don't try to count all of them one by one.

51:30.360 --> 51:32.400
At this time it's very important.

51:32.640 --> 51:35.520
I know what you are doing, some of you.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.720
Forget it.

51:41.760 --> 51:43.680
Just forget it.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.240
Whatever others might have said

51:48.400 --> 51:50.080
just forget it, for heaven's sake!

51:54.560 --> 51:58.040
Now raise this right hand over your forehead.

51:58.640 --> 51:59.640
Just.

52:00.360 --> 52:02.040
This is the crown of your head

52:02.360 --> 52:07.560
where we have not been able to forgive others.

52:08.080 --> 52:11.640
The one who wears the crown has to forgive others.

52:12.080 --> 52:15.600
So what we have to say that "Mother,

52:16.120 --> 52:18.920
I forgive everyone."

52:19.480 --> 52:21.560
Is the simplest thing to do

52:21.920 --> 52:26.800
because those who say it is difficult, they don't know it's a myth.

52:27.760 --> 52:31.040
When you forgive your - others, what are you doing? Nothing.

52:31.240 --> 52:34.320
And when you don't forgive,what do you do? Nothing.

52:34.720 --> 52:38.880
Only thing when you don't forgive, then only you torture yourself

52:39.120 --> 52:42.880
and play into the hands of people who wanted to trouble you.

52:43.040 --> 52:48.920
So just say with full heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

52:52.800 --> 52:57.240
Now, you can put your hand on your head.

52:58.120 --> 53:02.720
On your head in the center where you had a

53:03.520 --> 53:06.440
fontanelle bone area being soft in your childhood,

53:06.680 --> 53:08.680
and press it with your palm,

53:09.200 --> 53:12.080
you yourself, you are taking your own realization,

53:12.240 --> 53:14.440
so press it with your palm,

53:14.720 --> 53:17.240
in a clockwise manner,

53:17.720 --> 53:20.800
clockwise manner. Put your full palm on your head,

53:20.920 --> 53:23.240
in front, a little, it's in the front side,

53:23.520 --> 53:27.320
and press it and move it, your palm, move it like that, yes, palm.

53:27.760 --> 53:30.760
Move it. Press it hard.

53:33.280 --> 53:37.320
At this point, we have to say

53:37.880 --> 53:41.320
that, "Mother, I want my realization."

53:41.560 --> 53:45.760
Because as I told you, I cannot cross your freedom.

53:46.080 --> 53:49.400
So you have to say: "Mother, please give me realization."

53:49.720 --> 53:52.200
Otherwise I cannot do it, I'm sorry.

53:52.320 --> 53:56.080
That's the trouble with Me, is that I can't do it on My own.

53:56.280 --> 53:58.120
So I'm requesting you to say

53:58.320 --> 54:01.760
"Mother, I want my realization."

54:03.400 --> 54:05.280
It's all right, you've got it.

54:08.920 --> 54:11.000
Now raise your hand,

54:11.440 --> 54:15.680
about four inches, and see if there's a cool breeze coming out.

54:16.080 --> 54:19.040
You have to see for yourself.

54:19.560 --> 54:22.080
There? It's there.

54:22.840 --> 54:26.280
All right, now change over, you can change over and see.

54:26.480 --> 54:29.000
Don't open your eyes, just change over and see.

54:29.160 --> 54:31.920
Put your right hand towards Me.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.560
Right hand like this

54:33.760 --> 54:35.080
and now put the left hand

54:35.680 --> 54:38.720
and see if there's a cool breeze coming out

54:44.400 --> 54:45.480
See on your head,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.720
from your head, if there is a cool breeze coming out.

54:48.920 --> 54:50.720
Now don't think about it.

54:52.440 --> 54:55.720
You can't think, by thinking it has not... There?

54:56.640 --> 54:58.080
It is very subtle.

55:00.240 --> 55:03.040
Started in the hands. Stop to the head.

55:03.360 --> 55:04.520
Is working out,

55:04.840 --> 55:06.800
working out, woeking out.

55:07.200 --> 55:09.440
Change your hands again, whenever you want to.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.040
Change your hand. See for yourself,

55:11.240 --> 55:13.360
and don't you worry even if you don't feel it,

55:13.680 --> 55:17.880
we have so many people here who can again enforce it.

55:24.120 --> 55:28.680
Don't become serious, is going to be there. You just don't worry.

55:28.800 --> 55:31.840
None of you are missing your Kundalini.

55:31.920 --> 55:34.440
I can assure you, it's all there.

55:34.680 --> 55:37.040
May take a little more time for some people,

55:37.240 --> 55:39.000
less time for some people, makes no difference.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.760
Don't condemn yourself

55:40.920 --> 55:42.040
and don't be serious.

55:42.240 --> 55:45.000
Put your hand a little lower and move it up and down.

55:54.440 --> 55:57.640
Some people might be feeling in the hand.

55:57.920 --> 56:00.600
Some people will feel it in the hand,

56:00.880 --> 56:02.440
the hand that is towards Me.

56:11.720 --> 56:14.240
On here, ask them to see here.

56:22.480 --> 56:25.400
Now the Sahaja Yogis can see, but need not talk or touch,

56:25.680 --> 56:27.360
just see if they,

56:27.720 --> 56:29.000
you are feeling it.

56:32.640 --> 56:33.920
She's got it.

56:36.480 --> 56:37.920
It's very subtle.

56:38.680 --> 56:39.720
Got it?

56:40.840 --> 56:42.200
What about him? Mohan, just see,

56:43.120 --> 56:44.480
the gentleman next to you.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.040
He’s a realized soul.

56:48.080 --> 56:50.280
He's already there.

56:50.520 --> 56:51.600
Then

56:52.360 --> 56:56.520
see this gentleman touched it and again he is thinking about it.

57:06.480 --> 57:07.880
Now don't think about it,

57:08.280 --> 57:10.560
please don't think about it.

57:16.920 --> 57:19.800
There are wonderful people here in Holborn, I must say.

57:20.080 --> 57:22.720
It's a wonderful place to come to.

57:23.200 --> 57:24.680
Ha, all right?

57:25.000 --> 57:26.040
It's working out.

57:29.840 --> 57:30.920
Just see this how it is.

57:32.440 --> 57:34.320
Hello? Graham? See...

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Ha!
