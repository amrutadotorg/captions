00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.920
Now the essence of Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.280
I am sure Mr. Gavin Brown must have explained to you what it is.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.000
And so many of you are from Sahaja Yoga itself.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.920
So I need not explain to you all the details.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.600
But today we have to understand one thing

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.520
that it’s a very serious time we are born into, extremely serious.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.280
And when we look at life

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.280
we do not understand that

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.120
if we miss this chance of our evolution,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.520
not only that we’ll miss it for ourselves,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.080
not only that we’ll miss it for England,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.520
or only for one country,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.640
but we’ll miss it for the whole creation.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.520
The trouble is, in the name of God,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.760
in the name of evolution,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.800
in the name of higher life,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.320
so many spurious people have come up

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.240
that it has become impossible to convince anyone

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.160
that there is something like truth left in it.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.320
Under these circumstances,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.120
one has to talk about truth

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.480
and talking about truth

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.120
doesn’t give you the experience of the truth at all.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.080
Discussing about it will not give you,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.280
it’s a different realm in which one has to go into,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.280
it’s a new awareness which you have to get,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.320
to understand the truth,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.640
for which I don’t know how many are prepared,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.480
and how many would like to know,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.040
and even if they like to know, how many will get it.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.120
So the problem is the other way round.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.080
It’s not the problem that you have few people,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.640
it’s not the problem

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.440
that Sahaja Yoga cannot give you realization,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.160
it’s not the problem that you will not know the truth,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.880
but the whole circumstance is such,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.400
that whatever is false, whatever is spurious,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.040
whatever is silly, stupid, appeals to the masses.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.880
Sometimes I feel I have developed a method

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.120
by which I can give really en masse realization

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.560
all over the world,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.600
definitely I have.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.840
But the problem as it remains,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.080
the masses are not interested.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.600
It’s only very few who really can keenly take interest

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.240
into their evolutionary process

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.720
and would like to come out of the ignorance

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.600
in which they have been living.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.400
In all the ego-oriented countries

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.400
it’s very difficult to establish

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.440
that we are still ignorant,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.800
we have to know a lot. It’s very difficult.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.640
Because they think we know everything,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.560
because we have been to the moon. Like the Russians say,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.400
‘We never saw God, we went to the moon, we never saw God.’

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.920
It would be like saying that I have come

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.720
to the third floor, I haven’t seen God.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.000
Where does God reside? Where it manifest within us?

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.880
In what way it manifest, we don’t want to see.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.040
What we want to see is that through our effort,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.880
if we have not been able to see God, then He doesn’t exist.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.640
This is the way our attitude is,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.920
that better say, 'No,' to all that we did not know

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.240
through our effort,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.920
because so far we have not known about Him.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.600
So He doesn’t exist.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.480
So you turn round in a cave

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.480
when you see the shadows of yourself,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.880
you believe in them only and say,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.760
“It never existed anything else, the light does not exist.”

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.400
That kind of an attitude exists

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.600
or is persistently I am facing.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:14.320
And sometimes, I don’t know how to give them realization.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.000
Now as I said, it’s the other way round.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.240
You have to seek. You have to ask for it.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.640
You have to truly ask for it.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.920
Nobody is going to fall at your feet and say,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.120
‘All right, you get your realization.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.920
All right, you have this for heaven’s sake!'

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.600
Just have it!

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.720
Because nothing is selling here.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.240
We are so much used to the salesmanship, you see,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.800
that we think that if anything is selling,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.840
people have to persuade you, to request you, ask you,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.160
you can save pounds, you see, for sale and all that.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.160
But nothing is for sale.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.640
That’s a very difficult proposition to understand

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.240
in the present atmosphere,

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.480
where we do not know if you can get anything that is not for sale.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.800
But, I hope slowly and steadily,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.360
all of us have to get it.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.720
Somehow, one has to work very hard. Sometimes it’s very frustrating

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.120
and it’s so stupid, the way people react,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.800
that I just don’t know what to say.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.880
Like the other day we had a meeting in Brighton.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.920
I was laughing all the time. But so saddening.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.040
A gentleman came to our program

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.560
and he complained, he thought, he said,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.400
‘I was videoed.’

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.320
See, who has got time here to put him for a video,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.200
who is interested in taking his photographs? I mean,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.240
he says, ‘I am a managing director.’ So what?

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.800
In the presence of Divine, what is a managing director,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.640
what is a king, what is it? Just think of it. Who is he?

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.760
What does he think of himself and he has complained against us.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.440
I hope he doesn’t go to police for that.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.680
Even the laws are so stupid sometimes, I can’t understand,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.920
how has he got any right to complain if you come to a program

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.880
which is being conducted with a video on Me

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.080
and if you are photographed, how can you complain?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:46.440
One thing I feel that on one side is such stupid,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:54.600
useless people, the other side are such great seekers.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.920
And how to reach them?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.680
Like a diamond covered with lot of mud.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.840
So much mud. It’s all mud.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.240
In that to find out those diamonds,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.920
to dive into this mire of ignorance,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.000
to get out these diamonds which are lost.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.200
It’s such a concern, that I feel sometimes

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.520
that this mud is going to cover their brains, their ego,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.680
everything, and they may not receive their realization.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.280
They may miss this point.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.600
Actually, Divine does not know what human beings have created.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.240
Really, I tell you,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.600
Divine has no ideas what nonsense you have created around.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.320
All kinds of nonsense you have created

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.640
out of your ignorance, out of your ego,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.560
out of your choice that you had.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.360
I can’t explain why people have created this kind of ignorance

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.600
which cannot be broken, cannot be removed.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.200
Because they are so much identified.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.600
It’s like a stuck-up stamp which cannot come out of people.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.720
And when such a thing happens

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.720
you feel, Oh, God!`'

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.240
The whole creation has been created,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.040
whole working has taken place,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.000
the human beings have grown so well,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.920
out of a amoeba they have been brought to this stage.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:50.240
Now in these modern times you find the human beings so stupid,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.240
so foolish,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.280
and deluding others with their stupidity and foolishness.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.280
How are we to approach the people who are true seekers,

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.400
have been seekers for ages,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.440
those who have sought for years together,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.600
all their lives before, who are lost?

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.680
Sometimes it is very, very disappointing.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.400
But still, hoping against hopes,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.080
I hope we reach all the corners

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.200
of this universe where we find

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.640
all the people who are true seekers.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.000
It is their right to know,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.480
it is their power to know the Divine.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.600
It’s not for everybody because he’s somebody is a managing director

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.640
or a king or anything. What does it matter?

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.520
In the presence of God, they’ll be pushed out.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.160
They will not be allowed to enter into the kingdom of God.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.000
Who will be allowed to enter into the kingdom of God?

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.880
Those who have known.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.880
Also, not those who just talk about God.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.840
Those who say that

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.520
‘We are the worshippers of God, we have learned so much’.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.120
They will say, “All right, go with your books

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.120
to the places from where you have come.’

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.920
What have you to know is through your awareness,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.680
in your awareness you have to know.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.720
The awareness has to be enlightened.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.600
It is not, what you know with this human awareness,

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.200
which is still at a point, I say, has to grow so much.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.280
First it has to be awakened

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.840
and then it has to grow in its light.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.480
It’s such a lot of journey we have to do

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.880
even after realization.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.360
It takes no time sometimes to give realization to many people.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.200
I know it has happened with so many.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.600
But they don’t know what they have to achieve.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.200
It’s such a horrible stuff is this ego is,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.000
that people don’t want to see what they haven’t got with them,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.920
and what they have to hide, have and what they, they deserve.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.360
They are so identified with ego and satisfied with it,

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.440
that they don’t want to see that beauty that lies within them,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.720
the spirit, the reflection of God’s Love

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:33.400
which is like the highest and the most precious thing

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.920
that you could think of.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.520
In this England,

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.080
I don’t know how many lectures I have given

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.360
and how much I have worked hard.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.040
Of course there are results, no doubt. But it is so slow.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.680
Compared to the fake,

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.320
compared to the artificial people,

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.280
compared to the people who have made money out of you,

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.320
those who have exploited you,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.040
have ruined you,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.880
Sahaja Yoga is working so very slowly.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.800
I would not have been so much disappointed

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.840
if it was at the time of Christ

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.480
because at that time there were very few seekers.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.880
Actually even the fishermen who Christ collected, were not seekers.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.400
You are seekers of the truth.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.920
And so many of you have taken birth

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.080
just to seek the truth.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.320
And where are we going? What are we doing about it?

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.280
What are our ideas about the truth?

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:53.800
Can we have our own

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.920
ideas, conception about the truth?

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.720
Is it not that our ego itself has given us lots of ideas?

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.360
Is it not that we do not want to see the truth?

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.720
I meet all kinds of people in this country.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.400
I must say they are very highly placed, very great,

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.520
somebody is a lord and somebody is a lady

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.080
and somebody is another huge personality, and this and that.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.400
But, they said, ‘ Who wants to change? ’

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.400
I said, “Really. That’s true.”

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.120
Because they think they are the greatest people ever born

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.280
and they’re going to take all their lordship with them to the heaven.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.000
They said, ‘Who wants to change? ’

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.720
I said then, "Such a lot can be said on the point,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.920
but if you don’t want to change,

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.320
that’s a full stop, complete full stop."

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.480
You cannot talk to them.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.720
Now this, I must say is -

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:04.120
only can work out with people who are seekers,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.680
who want to know, through their awareness, what is the truth.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.560
You have to know your spirit.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.640
Without knowing your spirit, you cannot know what is the truth.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.520
Whatever I may talk to you is a waste, complete waste

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.200
because you haven’t got that awareness today,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.000
to know what I am talking about.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.080
So, first thing is: I request you to become the spirit.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.200
Is simple thing as that.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:46.680
Like now I have to see into your skin for example,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.240
I’ll have to use a microscope.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.720
And then people will say, ‘All right,you see through the microscope

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.360
you cannot see with your naked eyes.’

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.720
All right? Supposing I want to listen to somebody’s heart,

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.240
then people will say, ‘Use a stethoscope,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.840
otherwise you cannot listen to somebody’s heart.’

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.520
All right. You don’t question that time do you,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.560
you just put it there and try to listen.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:17.520
In the same way, why not we do about the spirit,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.600
why not we do what it is told to you,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.720
that you have to get your realization,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.800
that you have to become the spirit first,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.360
that unless and until this awareness is enlightened

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.880
by the spirit, you cannot see.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.160
Is like telling something about the coulors to a blind,

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.280
you have to open your eyes,

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:50.000
but this simple thing also people don’t accept.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.080
The reason is people are very naive.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.000
They don’t know, what is it,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.920
and also they don’t want to understand.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.720
Now as you see a tree standing there

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.000
and so many trees are there,

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.000
you must also know, that there are roots to it.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.440
But somebody has told you there are roots.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.200
You may not believe into it, but why not see, is the point.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.040
Why not see if there are roots or not?

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.080
Supposing I say, “ Whatever you are outside,

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.800
you are much more inside.”

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.880
So why not we see it?

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.280
This is a simple question we should ask ourselves,

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.240
‘Why should I put any barrier to that seeing,

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:47.080
if that is going to give me all the best in this world?

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.640
If it is going to give me

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.680
even the inkling

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.320
of that beautiful thing called spirit,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.320
why not have it?’

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.280
You don’t have to pay for it, you don’t have to exert for it,

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.080
you don’t have to do anything, but you have to desire.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.000
This is the point I am trying to make,

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.120
that if you do not desire from your heart,

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.400
then God is not going to fall at your feet,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.680
now please desire for Me, is He?

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.400
It’s a simple thing like that

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.920
and if you people understand

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.640
that you have to really desire it,

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.600
because it’s such a vicious circle I must tell you,

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.280
that this kundalini - is not here the picture -

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:38.440
the kundalini is the pure desire within you.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.880
Is the desire which is not yet manifested,

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.040
it is not yet awakened in the sense that it is acting,

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.440
but it has not acted.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.480
So, if so, how much important it is

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.080
that you should have the desire

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.280
to be one with the Divine, to be in Yoga,

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.720
to be one with your spirit.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.160
The desire has to be strong,

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.400
if it is not a strong desire

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.600
you are challenging your own kundalini, you are anti-kundalini

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.080
and then the kundalini won’t rise.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.000
But what is this brain has achieved so far, just look at it.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.880
You must understand, what have we achieved by this brain?

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.440
For example, this stupid managing director whosoever came there,

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.280
just ask him what good has he done to anyone?

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.200
What does he know about spiritual life?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.880
What does he understand about Christ’s life?’

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.680
But if he sends a letter,

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.800
the newspaper is very willing to write it down.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.920
I mean look at the stupidity of the whole stuff.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.520
Without understanding that anything that has to go to the masses

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:54.320
should be something sensible, from a sensible man,

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.920
who is supposed to be an authority

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.520
on spiritual life that he is talking about.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.160
What good this fellow has done, nobody reads that.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.280
But if I write something or any Sahaja Yogi says that, "see

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.640
by coming to Sahaja Yoga we dropped down all our bad habits,

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.720
I got cured of my cancer" or anything

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.400
nobody wants to listen to you. They think you are mad.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.520
But a man like that, if he writes, then they publish it.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.880
So it shows very clearly

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.200
that you see we are living with people

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.080
who are really not only mad but are absolutely foolish people,

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.320
who have no sense at all as to how they have to live

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.440
and how they have to move.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:43.560
This is what we have come to know about so many people now,

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.360
that sometimes you people have to take upon yourself

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.880
to go into it and find out what is the truth.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.200
It is you who have to find it out.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.560
You see, it would be something like that, I say now,

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.480
`This is a place where there are lots of diamonds',

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.560
say, I say that. Or:`This is a cave in which,

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.920
if you move there is a lot of, say - gold.'

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.160
Now the gold is not going to come out from there, is it?

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.720
Simple as that.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.360
You have to go towards the gold to find it out or not.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.080
You have to go towards it,

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.360
but here I’m not saying that you walk towards anything

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.440
or do anything like that, just you have to desire,

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.000
and desire it from your heart.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.880
Is impossible for me to work out kundalini

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.000
if you do not desire, because the desire,

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.840
the pure desire, is the kundalini.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.160
You understand My problem is now. Pure desire is the kundalini

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.120
and if you are against your pure desire,

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.160
what can I do about it? Can I force it?

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.680
You cannot push it out, you see? Like a seed,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.200
if you have to, if you want to have a seed sprouted,

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.240
you have to put it in the Mother Earth,

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.720
but you cannot take it out

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.840
the bits of the seed and sprout it, can you?

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.920
It’s a living process and for this living process

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.000
you have to have a pure desire.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.560
And if that desire is not there,

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.480
I am breaking My head against stones, I feel.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.240
So it is important that you understand

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.640
that you must have that desire which is the highest.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.840
But if you are satisfied with things

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.160
which are useless and nonsensical,

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.200
then what am I to do with that?

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.400
Now you just tell Me with someone

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.240
who is interested in things which are nonsensical,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.160
now how do you bring them round?

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.360
I mean, there is no psychology that can bring them round,

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:47.480
you see, because you have to have the desire to be all right.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.440
But this is something so innate,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.280
being the process itself is a living process

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.920
and doesn’t work out

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.320
if the people do not have the pure desire.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.040
Now this written down since long.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.560
It cannot be changed, it cannot be forced,

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.280
it cannot be sort of explained or discussed,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.280
or argued, nothing can be done; it has to work out within you.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.400
Now even when you have worked it out on someone,

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.840
you may not achieve the results. That’s possible.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.200
You may, you may not.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.560
So, when the situation is so difficult

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.600
and where the children are also so adamant,

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.320
then what can Mother do?

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.160
Is to push them in.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.200
See, I am very much concerned,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.560
that this ego which is sometimes so selfish

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.440
and so conceited,

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.200
that it satisfies itself and it’s very happy,

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.240
it will not allow you to get to the, that point

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.040
where you really stand, where you have all your powers,

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.120
where you are the master of your being. It will not allow.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.360
The identification with the ego is so much,

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.360
that’s easy to take a bull by the horn

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.040
but to take an ego-oriented man through Sahaja Yoga’s practices

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.840
is very difficult.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:19.120
I am rather today in a mood of,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.720
I should say little disgust, I should say,

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.000
but also the other mood comes on me

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:32.800
of complete compassion and tremendous love.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.760
That somehow I should do something to bring

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.080
sense into the heads of these people.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.560
Something should happen to them

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.640
because otherwise what I see is a complete disaster.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.400
It’s going to come, believe Me, it’s going to come.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.080
I don’t want to frighten you like Mrs. Thatcher does about Russians.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.720
That might be imaginary. But this is real and I am telling you

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.840
it’s going to come to us. It will come as diseases, selfdestruction.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.560
But the greatest thing is the failure of the Divine Itself

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.920
that it could not communicate with you people,

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.040
who were made specially,

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.240
who were brought to this earth on this time,

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.880
who have to have the kingdom of heaven.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.880
And suddenly you find they all dropped out of the sieve.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:35.200
Sahaja Yogis also sometimes feel very frustrated, I know.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.400
But whatever it is, as far as I am concerned,

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.720
I have tremendous desire now.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.920
But I am so desireless, that this desire also may not work out.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.000
You see, I am a desireless person.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.440
Now what to do?

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.120
So I ask Sahaja Yogis to desire

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.720
that the people should have that great desire

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.920
to become the spirit.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.720
This is the greatest thing

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.360
that we can give to our brothers and sisters,

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.240
to the progeny, to the people who are children today,

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.840
to this beautiful world.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.760
We need these beautiful lights

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.720
and the beautiful time which they all have to enjoy.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.680
I hope those who have come for the first time

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.920
will understand My difficulty

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.680
and will try to see that you desire

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.880
only your Self-realization and nothing else.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.440
Just desire that. I request you to desire your Self-realization

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.360
and forget about everything, even if you are managing director

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.000
or may be the King George the Vth, you see?

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.760
Better keep all your shoes outside about it,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.480
and just desire that you become the spirit.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:03.640
You see the difference between Me and Christ is here:

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.720
He got so fed up that He said, "Let Me be crucified."

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.120
I mean of course it was in the plan that He should be crucified also

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.240
but I mean that won’t solve the problem now.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.000
I have to see that you all get your resurrection somehow.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.840
It’s like a mother’s desire who wants to give a bath to the child

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.240
and get him cleansed somehow, you see.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.480
So whichever way you like – whether you like a chocolate

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.600
or whether you like a little rebuking

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.040
or whatever way you like, I am willing to work it out,

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.120
but please at least desire that you have to have

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.600
your Self-realization.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.320
May God bless you all.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.720
I hope those who get realization

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.000
will settle down with it seriously,

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.640
understand it is your responsibility today

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.520
that you are born today here in this country,

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.120
which is a special thing for Me and for Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.760
and that you should get your Self-realization,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.800
understand it very well and digest it and go into it

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.640
and become a very, very powerful personality that you have to be.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.080
But even a small thing like that, they said,

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.160
‘You take out your shoes.’ Because, you see,

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.800
shoes make you little bit tightened up.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.040
Even that much if you ask them, oh, they,

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.000
as if I’ve asked a hundred pounds from them!

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.080
Even that little thing they don’t want to do

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.200
and why are they here, I don’t understand,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.560
all the way they come for what?

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.720
You don’t want to get your realization?

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:43.320
You don’t want to get the greatest blessing of the Divine?

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.040
Then what am I to do? How am I to deal with you?

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.120
You may be very well educated person, all right, a learned man,

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.520
but you have not known so far.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.080
It happens with gurus, it happens with everyone,

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.000
they are sticking on to a guru;

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.320
they are sticking on to a guru

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.400
they cannot give up that guru, whatever it is,

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.800
is another kind of a ego because they think of,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.080
‘All right, we have eaten the crow; so what

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.360
if we have eaten the crow, we have eaten the crow!

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.680
So, go ahead with it.’ This is another category of people

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.640
who don’t want to give up whatever is nonsensical.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.360
Then the third category is another one who are just waiting,

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.200
‘All right, let the catastrophe come.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.880
We are just waiting.’ I mean, they told Me,

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.720
‘Mother, doesn’t matter, don’t You worry,

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.120
we are all waiting for the catastrophe,

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.880
disaster.When is it going to arrive? You just tell us that.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.400
We are all anxiously waiting.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.240
If it is coming, it’s a very good thing,

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.920
now we are reconciled to a situation like that.’

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.040
On the streets of Paris, if you go there,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.840
you find many like that, discussing,

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.160
when are the ten stars going to meet

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:54.680
so that we are all collided and made into a jam.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.160
We won’t be made into a jam, I must tell you,

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.480
but something horrible which is thousand times worse

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:09.160
than what you are doing on the streets of Paris.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:17.160
But this kind of attitude of three types of people,

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.680
I don’t know, I may, I’m thinking, now I have been in London

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.120
for so many days and My going time is coming

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.120
and I don’t know what’s going to happen now,

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.920
because Sahaja Yogis themselves are desperate

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.280
and they all want to settle down in India.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.880
I will not allow them to settle down in India unless and until

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.400
they at least get half of the English people realized.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.000
Yes, that’s for very sure.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.000
If you think that now Mother has gone there,

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.120
so let us take our baggage there and let settle down

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.200
in a nice little ashram enjoying yourself, nothing doing!

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.680
You have to work hard.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.040
You have to get at least half of the British people realized

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.120
somehow; if you can’t do it, you’re not allowed

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:10.080
to enjoy any rest and I, too, will not be able to have any rest

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.800
in My lifetime, if these things do not happen.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.920
I hope you all understand My concern,

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:24.840
My great concern and My love for British people here

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.360
who must understand also their place

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.600
in this great work of God, how they should come up.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.920
May God bless you all.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.600
I'll have some water to drink.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.040
I think I'll be better off here.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.840
Better sit.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.000
I'm very much better here.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.600
Any questions? Please!

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.680
So, you are here? So nice to see you!

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.360
What's happening in the Isle of Wight?

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.160
Are you there?

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.440
Me?

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.720
I don’t live in Isle of Wight. I'm from Hampstead.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.520
We have some people there? I don't know.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.360
We have to try all kinds of things.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.040
Now, what's the question is?

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.720
I can't read your minds. Please tell me.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.000
It's all right. They are all right there.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.080
What's the question?

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.000
No questions?

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.760
There could be a question:

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.600
"How to have the desire?"

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.080
Isn't it? If somebody asked me a question like that,

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.000
"How to have the desire, Mother, tell us?", you see, it would be,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.680
"How to have the desire to eat the icecream?", you see?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.880
Sometimes you don't know whether to cry or to laugh.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.920
It's like that.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.840
How many people have come for the first time? Please raise your hands.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.920
Lots of them. Good, good, good...

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.000
I would say, those who have come the first time should come forward

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.600
and sahaja yogis should go back.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.680
Mohan, you can go back.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.160
Who else is there? Haan, you go back.

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.000
Yes, come along. Sit down, sit down, sit down.

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.320
Here.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.160
First or second row, please be seated.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.600
Will you be comfortable? Sure?

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.800
Yes, yes...

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.440
Will you be comfortable there, down below?

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.480
No, you can sit in the second row, if you want

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.120
and if you are not comfortable, it is not easy to sit on the ground.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.560
Why don't you put the chairs around, like that?

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.320
So they'll get you some chairs there and some chairs here

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.720
Can you bring here some chairs, in the first line?

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.240
Just put it there, now.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.880
You can bring it...

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.160
[MOTHER SPEAKS HINDI]

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.360
They are stuck together Mother.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.160
What's about - they are fixed?

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.720
- Yes.
- What?

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.200
Fixed, hai?

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.120
I'm sorry for that.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.400
The whole thing, you can bring it, yes, yes.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.640
Better sit there, you have to be comfortable, my child.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.320
Better be there. You will be comfortable.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.640
You have to be comfortable, that's first thing.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.560
Right? Wherever you are comfortable, please be seated.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.720
It’s good to see so many new people.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.920
It's such a great thing.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.280
That's all, that's all, they don't want...

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.560
They, they are... They say they are happy here.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.560
Now...

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.240
Is a very simple thing

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.320
that Kundalini is to be awakened within you

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.520
because she's there,

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.360
she has been there

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.640
and she gets awakened by itself,

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.480
spontanous, don't have to do anything. It's all yours.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.080
Only thing, as Gavin must have told you that

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.600
an enlightened light can enlighten another light.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.200
In the same way,

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.040
if I am an enlightened person, you should get your enlightenment.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.320
And it works in no time, should work in no time.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.760
If you can put your hands just like this,

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.040
now, I must give you explanation,

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.040
I'm not going to take anything from you.

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.680
It's just because these fingers denote your centers.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.320
These are five fingers, six and seven are the left side

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.160
centers, these are right side centers.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:46.040
When they are crossed together, you form the central path

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.440
which is the one we call as the Sushumna.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:54.000
Now the central path manifests what we call in

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.240
the medical terminology as parasympathetic nervous system.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:05.040
Now, this central path is - has got one left and one right

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.720
in - on one center.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.320
So, what we do is to put our hands like this

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.080
so that these ends, which are receptive,

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.840
are the ends of the sympathetic nervous system,

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.640
so the left and the right sympathetic system gets enlightened

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.920
which is fixed here, like this, you see?

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.360
So what we do is to just put your hands like this,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.120
towards Me,

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.760
without putting any pressure or anything,

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.400
on your lap. Be comfortable.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.880
Be comfortable.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.040
Now, you may have to loosen little bit if there is something tight

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.640
or making you uncomfortable, that's all.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.560
And the feet,

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.440
is better if you are sitting on the ground is all right or any way,

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.200
but if they are on the Mother Earth, it helps.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.840
But if you like it, like you are sitting, is all right,

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.360
doesn't matter. Put your hands straight like this.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:06.600
Makes no difference whatever way you have been putting your hands,

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.200
just the fingers should come towards Me, that's all.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.120
Facing towards Me.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.440
Now, it doesn't matter from what race, creed,

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.840
coulor, whatever way you are coming here.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.320
And also doesn't matter whatever you have done before.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.480
Now, we are here at this present moment.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.400
This moment is important for Me.

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.600
At this moment, you are here

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:38.320
to jump into the new awareness of Self-realization.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.480
So, this is the most important time -

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.560
for Me and for you.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:48.000
At this time, forget about the past and the future.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.800
Say, somebody thinks that he is guilty

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.800
of something, I mean that's a fashion these days,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.320
to feel guilty is a fashion.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.840
In the West it's a fashion.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.520
Just for nothing, why to feel guilty, I can't understand.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.680
An Indian will never feel guilty, you know, whatever they may do.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.800
And this fashion of feeling guilty

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
really clutches Me from here to here sometimes

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.720
when I am talking to the Western people.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.520
At the first outset

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:18.560
you must know that you are not guilty at all in the presence of God.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.880
In the eyes of God you are not guilty

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.760
and you have no business to condemn yourself,

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.680
because you are going to be the temple of God.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.440
And now don't feel guilty about yourself.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:36.400
You have not even made your nose, what are you feeling guilty about?

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:41.560
So just have a very cheerful disposition about yourself,

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.760
that you are not guilty,

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.840
that you are going to be the spirit,

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.680
the beauty, the glory that you are.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.280
And there is no need to feel guilty at all!

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.800
Is very important. At the very outset,

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.440
I will request you not to feel guilty.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.160
That's first thing you have to do.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.880
Sincerely

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.440
you have to say to yourself, "I'm not guilty at all".

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.160
Because there's a big block here sitting, just now,

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.320
into everybody's left side.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.320
And that's how they get spondylitis

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.880
so much so that I may get one day spondylitis,

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.480
the way people are getting it.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.440
So we are not to feel guilty at all, we have to decide on that point.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.160
Whatever people might have told you,

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:26.520
that we are the greatest sinners or whatever it is,

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.320
in the presence of God's love

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.000
we cannot feel guilty, because we challenge His powers

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.680
of forgiveness.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.720
He has a power to forgive,

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.360
and He forgives such big sins that what sins can we commit, isn't it?

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.040
So just don't feel guilty,

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.400
that is the first thing I have explained to you.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.360
By reading all these horrible books

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.760
I think people also start feeling guilty.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.800
I don't know how, what are the... what are the sources are,

00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.280
but is a very common practice,

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.080
I don't know where they sell this business of guilt

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.640
but definitely people are feeling guilty for nothing at all.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.080
So I would request you not to feel guilty,

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.200
put your hands towards Me and just close your eyes.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.400
Just close your eyes.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.200
Now, how do I manage it?

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.920
I must tell you now.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.880
Is very simple for Me.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.120
What I do, that, with My attention,

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:32.160
I put you, all of you, in My heart.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.840
I can do it.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:37.720
Supposing you know how to put someone in your heart,

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.200
you can also do it very easy.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.120
You are all in My heart.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.800
Supposing I conceive you in My heart, you can say like that,

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.600
and raise My Kundalini,

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.680
and bring it to the fontanelle bone area

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:57.800
where resides the seat of My spirit

00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.560
and then touches,

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.480
My own Kundalini

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.200
touches

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.560
the spirit, the seat of the spirit,

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.160
and when it happens,

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:17.760
then you all feel that you have got your realization.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.000
You feel the realization.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.200
This is how it happens.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.320
But when you people get your realization,

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.640
you also get the same powers.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.800
And you can give realization to others

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:42.120
just by raising your hands behind the back of the people

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.040
whom you want to give realization.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.560
It is a very simple method worked out very simply,

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.000
by nature, by the living process of evolution.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.200
Now close your eyes properly,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.280
put your hands towards Me.

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.560
As a result of this,

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:05.240
first thing, you start noticing in your thoughts,

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.880
ask your mind, "What are you thinking?"

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.520
Keep your eyes shut, fully,

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.160
that's important.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.720
You'll find that there is no answer.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.120
In many of you, you'll find that the answers are running away.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.800
When you are trying to catch

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.880
the answer, there is no answer, is all running away.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.000
That's the best situation.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.680
When the mind is resting for the change, you see, it's not thinking.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:56.560
When this has happened within you, then we have to start

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.280
acting on our desire.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.560
So the left hand represents the desire that we have,

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.920
so keep the left hand fixed towards Me

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.200
and with the right hand now you have to act.

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.440
Don't open your eyes at any cost,

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.360
please don't open your eyes at any cost.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.440
Put your right hand on your heart.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.760
If you're wearing a coat, put your hand inside the coat.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.920
Put it on your heart on the left-hand side.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.480
Put the left hand straight towards Me.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.760
Stretched out, now.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:38.680
Now you have to ask a question to yourself in your heart,

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.720
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.280
Ask the question. Which you are!

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.120
But you better ask the question in the beginning because the

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.160
attitude just now is:

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.000
Whether I am the spirit or not,

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.560
even if the Mother says, you need not believe it.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.680
So just say, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.800
Keep your eyes shut fully.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.280
Ask sincerely.

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.920
Now, if you are the spirit,

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.240
then you have to be your master also.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.640
Now you can put the same hand

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.440
down below on another center on the left-hand side on the stomach.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.920
On the stomach on the left-hand side quite lower,

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:39.920
and ask a question in the center on the left-hand side,

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.240
in the central part of the stomach,

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.400
and ask a question,

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.440
"Mother, am I my own master?"

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.120
"Am I my own guru?"

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.720
Ask this question at least ten times.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.240
Sincerely, from your heart, with confidence,

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:48.400
ask the question, "Mother, am I my own master?"

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.040
Now, put the right hand again on your heart.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.760
Now, at this point,

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.760
you have to confidently say

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.520
that "Mother, I am the spirit."

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.120
You have to confidently say that "Mother, I am the spirit."

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.600
Say it twelve times please.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.120
"Mother, I am the spirit!" You are the spirit.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:23.920
Everyone has said that you are the spirit.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.320
And you are to be born

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.760
again.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.280
Just assert.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.760
Now raise your right hand higher

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.640
onto the base of your neck, the left side.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.640
Again, we are working on the left because of the desire.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.360
Base of the neck on the left-hand side,

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:31.240
where I told you is a big block of guilt.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.880
Now if you are the spirit, how can you be guilty?

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.040
Because the spirit never commits sins,

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.720
is guiltless,

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.920
is perfect,

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.280
is absolute.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.280
So now you say "Mother,"

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.080
"I'm not guilty"

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.400
with full confidence and sixteen times,

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.080
and if you have been too much guilty, say it thirty-two times.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:55.920
That's...

00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.280
That's a better punishment.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.720
'Cause I am suffering because of your guilt.

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.840
For anything, even for smoking or drinking or anything,

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.880
don't feel guilty. Forget it.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.840
Serious or trivial things, don't feel guilty.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.920
You have to respect yourself, isn't it?

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.560
If you are the spirit.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:35.840
Now.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.000
Better now.

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.760
Because you really don't know what you are,

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.640
that's why you are feeling guil... guilty, I really tell you.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.920
When you will know what you are,

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.280
you'll be enamored

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.280
to know.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.560
Please believe Me.

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.400
Don't condemn yourself at all.

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.280
No confessions.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.560
And no past to be brought in just now. Please forget the past.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.080
Don't try to count all of them one by one.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:32.400
At this time it's very important.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:35.520
I know what you are doing, some of you.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.720
Forget it.

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.680
Just forget it.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.240
Whatever others might have said

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.080
just forget it, for heaven's sake!

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:58.040
Now raise this right hand over your forehead.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.640
Just.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.040
This is the crown of your head

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:07.560
where we have not been able to forgive others.

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.640
The one who wears the crown has to forgive others.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.600
So what we have to say that "Mother,

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.920
I forgive everyone."

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.560
Is the simplest thing to do

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:26.800
because those who say it is difficult, they don't know it's a myth.

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.040
When you forgive your - others, what are you doing? Nothing.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.320
And when you don't forgive,what do you do? Nothing.

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:38.880
Only thing when you don't forgive, then only you torture yourself

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:42.880
and play into the hands of people who wanted to trouble you.

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:48.920
So just say with full heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.240
Now, you can put your hand on your head.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:02.720
On your head in the center where you had a

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.440
fontanelle bone area being soft in your childhood,

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.680
and press it with your palm,

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.080
you yourself, you are taking your own realization,

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.440
so press it with your palm,

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.240
in a clockwise manner,

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.800
clockwise manner. Put your full palm on your head,

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.240
in front, a little, it's in the front side,

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.320
and press it and move it, your palm, move it like that, yes, palm.

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.760
Move it. Press it hard.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:37.320
At this point, we have to say

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:41.320
that, "Mother, I want my realization."

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:45.760
Because as I told you, I cannot cross your freedom.

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.400
So you have to say: "Mother, please give me realization."

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.200
Otherwise I cannot do it, I'm sorry.

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.080
That's the trouble with Me, is that I can't do it on My own.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.120
So I'm requesting you to say

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.760
"Mother, I want my realization."

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.280
It's all right, you've got it.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.000
Now raise your hand,

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:15.680
about four inches, and see if there's a cool breeze coming out.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.040
You have to see for yourself.

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.080
There? It's there.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:26.280
All right, now change over, you can change over and see.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.000
Don't open your eyes, just change over and see.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.920
Put your right hand towards Me.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.560
Right hand like this

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.080
and now put the left hand

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.720
and see if there's a cool breeze coming out

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.480
See on your head,

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.720
from your head, if there is a cool breeze coming out.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.720
Now don't think about it.

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.720
You can't think, by thinking it has not... There?

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.080
It is very subtle.

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.040
Started in the hands. Stop to the head.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.520
Is working out,

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.800
working out, woeking out.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.440
Change your hands again, whenever you want to.

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.040
Change your hand. See for yourself,

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.360
and don't you worry even if you don't feel it,

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.880
we have so many people here who can again enforce it.

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:28.680
Don't become serious, is going to be there. You just don't worry.

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.840
None of you are missing your Kundalini.

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.440
I can assure you, it's all there.

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.040
May take a little more time for some people,

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.000
less time for some people, makes no difference.

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.760
Don't condemn yourself

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.040
and don't be serious.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.000
Put your hand a little lower and move it up and down.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.640
Some people might be feeling in the hand.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.600
Some people will feel it in the hand,

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.440
the hand that is towards Me.

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.240
On here, ask them to see here.

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:25.400
Now the Sahaja Yogis can see, but need not talk or touch,

00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.360
just see if they,

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.000
you are feeling it.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.920
She's got it.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.920
It's very subtle.

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:39.720
Got it?

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.200
What about him? Mohan, just see,

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.480
the gentleman next to you.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.040
He’s a realized soul.

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.280
He's already there.

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:51.600
Then

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:56.520
see this gentleman touched it and again he is thinking about it.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.880
Now don't think about it,

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.560
please don't think about it.

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:19.800
There are wonderful people here in Holborn, I must say.

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.720
It's a wonderful place to come to.

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.680
Ha, all right?

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.040
It's working out.

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:30.920
Just see this how it is.

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.320
Hello? Graham? See...

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Ha!
