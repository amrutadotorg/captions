00:00:02.111 --> 00:00:11.833
I’m just trying to remember if I had a more
fantastic birthday than this!

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:26.793
Where words do not come, there the joy
cannot be expressed.

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:34.905
When it becomes so deep, that there is no movement.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.628
This is a great country.

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:46.528
Australia has been created

00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:54.973
for a special purpose in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:58.481 --> 00:01:10.900
This is the Mooladhara chakra, where resides Shri Ganesha, of this world.

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:24.596
How important it is to keep this centre awakened within us.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:30.410
The information about my coming

00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:39.199
can only be broadcasted from this centre.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.918
Then the world Kundalini is going to rise.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.400
When you are putting your hands towards me,

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:55.706
then the divine love passes through
your fingers,

00:01:55.943 --> 00:02:03.057
goes down through your Ida and Pingala

00:02:03.258 --> 00:02:10.970
and informs Shri Ganesha about my presence

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:15.392
and then the Kundalini rises.

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:35.210
So today, we should say, is a great day
in the history of divine work,

00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:41.465
where I came to Australia.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.431
They asked me, “Was there any incarnation
in Australia?"

00:02:49.632 --> 00:02:55.738
Did God visit Australia in human form?

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.388
I said, “It’s not easy to reach Shri Ganesh!”

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:09.084
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh could not reach Shri Ganesh.

00:03:09.285 --> 00:03:15.866
And you know that he is placed like a lotus

00:03:16.075 --> 00:03:39.004
where all kinds of people who are insulted,
tortured, ignored, are saved.

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:49.877
Here he really decides whom to save
from hell, and whom not to save.

00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:54.101
God’s decisions are very different,
they are absolute.

00:03:54.302 --> 00:03:59.267
Human decisions are extremely cruel
and blind.

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:07.184
And today you find so many saints in this
Mooladhara.

00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:13.181
This is the work of Shri Ganesh.

00:04:13.382 --> 00:04:18.128
He has called you on this great chakra

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.991
where Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha
also cannot enter in it

00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:31.418
that you should stay here and grow
into beautiful saints

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:36.093
of very great magnitude in spirituality.

00:04:36.294 --> 00:04:41.979
Such glory is to him, is such a fortunate thing,

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.343
and such a blessing,

00:04:45.544 --> 00:04:51.232
that even Indians could be jealous of you.

00:04:58.993 --> 00:05:09.421
One has to see how Shri Ganesha acts within us.

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:14.544
It’s very important to recognise him,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.944
to understand him and to imbibe,

00:05:19.145 --> 00:05:25.633
otherwise, you will be wasting all His
energies staying in this place,

00:05:25.834 --> 00:05:31.894
living in this place, so close to him.

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:39.356
And though he is the giver of wisdom,

00:05:39.565 --> 00:05:46.211
I wonder how many people understand
the word ‘wisdom’.

00:05:46.757 --> 00:05:52.130
Wisdom is the centre of gravity within us

00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:58.469
which gives us the fulcrum on which
we rotate,

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.878
by which we realise that we are inclined

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:05.985
to the left or to the right.

00:06:08.593 --> 00:06:17.737
This fulcrum we have to be aware of,

00:06:17.938 --> 00:06:22.569
because otherwise we will not know
how far we have gone.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:29.648
Not only [that], but we should know that it is so much

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:37.776
the centre of gravity and our fulcrum - so close.

00:06:37.977 --> 00:06:44.453
Because if your centre of gravity and
fulcrum are separated

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.291
there’s no integration.

00:06:47.354 --> 00:06:51.291
You can be ruined completely.

00:06:52.228 --> 00:07:01.341
So wisdom means this integration between
your understanding

00:07:01.852 --> 00:07:12.433
and the understanding of Shri Ganesha, within you.

00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:22.000
For example, we go to extremes, extremes of behaviour.

00:07:22.162 --> 00:07:25.549
I would give you a very simple example:

00:07:25.662 --> 00:07:28.549
I was going to Hong Kong

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.884
and the lady who organised it,
she telephoned to me again and again

00:07:35.085 --> 00:07:41.158
and she told me that, “A big batch of people are coming to receive you

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:49.214
and you are going to be on the television
from the moment you land..

00:07:49.415 --> 00:07:51.705
and this is going to happen and that is going to happen”.

00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:53.972
Every day spending so much money.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.972
Describing to me the scene

00:07:57.173 --> 00:08:02.514
that I’ll be a “hot news” and all sorts of things, you see,

00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:05.514
encourage lots of people to come and see you

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.188
And she was on and on and on.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:13.188
And also, she told Dr Warren

00:08:13.398 --> 00:08:18.642
except for giving the newspaper [advert] she didn’t
have to pay for it.

00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:25.312
It was going too far.

00:08:28.677 --> 00:08:33.432
At that juncture, just it was not necessary

00:08:34.158 --> 00:08:38.982
to go to such a limit and plan it out that there will be people coming

00:08:39.183 --> 00:08:42.000
inside the aeroplane to receive me

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.535
makes no difference to me!

00:08:43.736 --> 00:08:48.161
And there would be a car waiting near
the aeroplane just to receive me.

00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:56.067
I don’t know! I don’t know who was waiting
where, at every point!

00:08:56.848 --> 00:08:59.459
And when we reached there, it was six
hours late

00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:04.924
and I told Warren, “It’s all going to be a fizzled out, take it easy!”

00:09:07.911 --> 00:09:12.695
And the plane just deposited us in Bangkok!

00:09:12.911 --> 00:09:17.095
There was no way – six hours.

00:09:17.296 --> 00:09:20.415
And we had to take another plane

00:09:20.616 --> 00:09:25.646
in which nobody came in

00:09:25.656 --> 00:09:27.646
no car

00:09:27.656 --> 00:09:28.646
nothing.

00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:32.552
We went down looking for her, couldn’t see
her.

00:09:32.753 --> 00:09:37.594
Telephoned to the hotel, they said, “No arrangements thrown.”

00:09:37.795 --> 00:09:42.585
Warren thought, “Mother has gone to another extreme now!”

00:09:44.402 --> 00:09:51.705
Quite worried that there’s no one to receive us at the airport in Hong Kong.

00:09:51.983 --> 00:09:54.304
It’s all a joke

00:09:54.505 --> 00:10:00.031
Going to extremes has to be corrected in you as well.

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:03.910
because if you get successful with your this kind of planning,

00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:06.827
then you’ll go on doing this kind of artificial planning

00:10:07.028 --> 00:10:10.087
and not the planning of the divine.

00:10:10.288 --> 00:10:12.976
The divine has its own plans

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.976
and we have to feel the plans of the divine.

00:10:16.177 --> 00:10:20.831
It works it out. You are just an instrument to work it out.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:28.725
So if you try to do something of your own,
something too much,

00:10:28.926 --> 00:10:35.162
then who is going to suggest the balance - is Shri Ganesh

00:10:35.363 --> 00:10:39.633
And that balance, once it’s established in you

00:10:39.834 --> 00:10:43.137
you know how you should balance yourself.

00:10:43.334 --> 00:10:46.137
Now, there is no alternative

00:10:46.338 --> 00:10:50.166
for Sahaj Yog, no alternative.

00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:52.166
One must know.

00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:55.917
Everything that is living has no alternatives.

00:10:56.118 --> 00:11:04.626
For example, if a mango tree says that,
“I will create a pomegranate,” it cannot!

00:11:04.835 --> 00:11:10.354
There’s no alternatives. Whatever is there, it has to see and enjoy;

00:11:10.555 --> 00:11:13.393
but not to force its way on it.

00:11:13.594 --> 00:11:17.031
This is one of the things we have to understand

00:11:17.232 --> 00:11:21.087
to establish our wisdom.

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:32.155
Because of our concept, our idea, our anything,

00:11:32.356 --> 00:11:40.608
even about God for example, about our achievements itself,

00:11:40.809 --> 00:11:45.695
can be absolutely wrong if you have no wisdom.

00:11:45.896 --> 00:11:54.714
But in nature, if you see, those who grow

00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:59.111
are never bothered about what shape
they are going to take, do they?

00:11:59.312 --> 00:12:05.718
Does a tree measure itself up to know how
many dimensions it is going to grow?

00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:09.740
It grows as much as it can

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:12.340
slowly, steadily

00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:17.644
in coordination with nature itself.

00:12:17.845 --> 00:12:28.296
Like that, the wisdom is the one that understands.

00:12:29.903 --> 00:12:33.479
It is an establishment, is a state of mind.

00:12:33.702 --> 00:12:39.877
We can say it’s the state of being, when you become wisdom.

00:12:41.726 --> 00:12:49.327
Such a wisdom outside, also expresses so beautifully.

00:12:49.528 --> 00:12:55.993
Such a wisdom gives you a gentleman and a gentlelady

00:12:59.682 --> 00:13:06.438
only in a personality which is settled down.

00:13:06.928 --> 00:13:09.222
If you are frustrated

00:13:09.228 --> 00:13:11.222
and if there’s a problem

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:14.915
if you are unhappy, if you are suppressed

00:13:15.116 --> 00:13:24.484
any extremes will not allow this flower of wisdom to grow.

00:13:24.685 --> 00:13:27.470
So even in frustration you have to look back,

00:13:27.671 --> 00:13:30.251
you have to stand back and see for yourself,

00:13:30.452 --> 00:13:32.405
“Why am I to be so frustrated?”

00:13:32.606 --> 00:13:38.220
Count your blessings one by one.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.220
Count your blessings one by one.

00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:46.634
I’ll say again, count your blessings one by one.

00:13:46.835 --> 00:13:48.716
Once you start counting your blessings,

00:13:48.917 --> 00:13:55.220
you will find in such a short time, where are you.

00:13:56.594 --> 00:13:59.831
Now the extreme projections of the mind can take you to:

00:14:00.032 --> 00:14:06.231
“I’m not going to face!” and you would like to do it.

00:14:11.428 --> 00:14:20.222
But in wise projection, you can see this, that you are what you have to be.

00:14:20.423 --> 00:14:23.737
You are saints.

00:14:24.747 --> 00:14:28.211
You were born to be saints in this great country.

00:14:28.412 --> 00:14:31.788
You are specially blessed people in the heavens,

00:14:31.989 --> 00:14:41.390
and are sent on this Earth to do this Maha Yoga, to spread it.

00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:44.073
You have achieved that state.

00:14:44.274 --> 00:14:49.424
And if you are saints, you should not be bothered as to a few things like,

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:54.500
“Oh! I haven’t got a suitcase” or something
sort of a thing like that

00:14:54.701 --> 00:14:57.622
which you have never been very much bothered before.

00:14:57.823 --> 00:15:00.000
Can you see that?

00:15:00.123 --> 00:15:03.370
Any kind of extreme behaviour

00:15:03.571 --> 00:15:07.855
For example, for materialism you people are not so bad

00:15:08.056 --> 00:15:14.805
in the sense that you understand the value
of aesthetics.

00:15:15.006 --> 00:15:20.282
But in possessiveness let us take the wise
path, the wisdom

00:15:20.483 --> 00:15:22.077
logical, it has to be logical

00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:31.077
What do we possess in this world?

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:35.801
Just think of one thing that we can possess!

00:15:36.009 --> 00:15:39.712
Except for your own Spirit, you don’t possess anything.

00:15:39.913 --> 00:15:45.270
Except for your evolutionary development, you don’t possess anything.

00:15:45.471 --> 00:15:48.440
For example, now you are a saint you’ll be born a saint always

00:15:48.641 --> 00:15:52.170
this is what you possess

00:15:52.241 --> 00:15:53.170
The rest you don’t possess

00:15:53.371 --> 00:15:55.258
It’s logical, logical.

00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:59.258
You need not to be realised to understand what I am saying.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:07.119
So why should we worry about our possessions?

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:12.225
When you leave this worry, this is another wisdom,

00:16:12.426 --> 00:16:14.276
this is the higher wisdom

00:16:14.426 --> 00:16:17.876
which you develop within yourself.

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:22.860
And if we leave our possessions, our material problems are solved.

00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:25.500
‘Leave’ doesn’t mean you throw them in the sea, 

00:16:25.503 --> 00:16:29.000
but the attachment to it dissolves

00:16:29.003 --> 00:16:31.497
It is solved.

00:16:31.503 --> 00:16:33.897
Let me give you an example

00:16:34.098 --> 00:16:38.000
Like Kay lost her travellers’ cheques

00:16:38.098 --> 00:16:40.699
she did not know, she was not knowing

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.000
Suddenly one man bumped into her.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.177
I was with her.

00:16:45.378 --> 00:16:48.589
He said, “Imagine, I never knew I was going to meet you!”

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.519
He said, “I went to a particular cashier or somebody"

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.903
And he said “Do you know this lady? I’ve got her travellers cheques with me.”

00:16:57.104 --> 00:17:00.981
And here, suddenly, I bump into you!”

00:17:01.182 --> 00:17:04.310
How the news has been organised, in the nature you see,

00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:10.713
when the flowers bloom, how these bees come all the way.

00:17:10.914 --> 00:17:18.223
How the birds fly all the way from Siberia to Australia?

00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:22.121
What wisdom, is that magnetism in them"

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:25.121
the magnetism that is in the Mother Earth"

00:17:25.322 --> 00:17:33.689
which tells them, “This is the way you have to go.”

00:17:34.196 --> 00:17:38.252
So we have to see to this magnetism within us:

00:17:38.453 --> 00:17:45.303
What makes us magnetic

00:17:45.629 --> 00:17:49.342
is not what we could have, what unnatural
things we have

00:17:49.543 --> 00:17:51.789
but what naturally we have achieved within

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.986
and we are not afraid to express it

00:17:55.187 --> 00:18:00.286
In fear you are never aggressive

00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:10.953
but even in fearlessness you are never aggressive

00:18:11.154 --> 00:18:17.633
In fear you might say that you are not afraid

00:18:17.834 --> 00:18:21.636
but you could be aggressive

00:18:24.615 --> 00:18:28.283
When people look very frightened, if you push them

00:18:28.484 --> 00:18:34.071
to the extreme of fright, they can come back

00:18:34.272 --> 00:18:36.686
But if you are fearless, you are innocent

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.686
you are just standing and watching

00:18:43.573 --> 00:18:50.094
Fearlessness never means aggression

00:18:51.165 --> 00:18:55.977
So the confusion of our own concepts

00:18:56.178 --> 00:18:59.000
can only be cleared out

00:18:59.001 --> 00:19:01.895
if there is light within us.

00:19:02.096 --> 00:19:07.615
For us, if somebody is aggressing us, then we think

00:19:07.816 --> 00:19:11.345
[that] if we do not aggress the other
person, we are frightened

00:19:11.546 --> 00:19:14.597
then we are useless,

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.997
we are weak, we are weak people

00:19:20.148 --> 00:19:22.000
so we should fight back.

00:19:22.148 --> 00:19:26.698
Even when you are fighting back, you are weak people.

00:19:27.673 --> 00:19:32.825
If it was not so, what is there to fight
back?

00:19:33.026 --> 00:19:37.805
In fearlessness you become the witness.

00:19:38.006 --> 00:19:40.102
You see the joke

00:19:40.116 --> 00:19:44.102
joke behind all this extreme behaviour of another person.

00:19:44.303 --> 00:19:48.420
And also you know the technique, kaushalam.

00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:51.436
Yoga also means kaushalam, it means technique

00:19:51.621 --> 00:19:53.436
how to manage the show

00:19:53.637 --> 00:20:00.201
by which his action doesn’t trouble you

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.201
if you want to.

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:08.024
If you don’t want, you can even take
the action upon yourself, to prove it

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:12.793
that, “Whatever you are doing is a little
silly and stupid.”

00:20:12.994 --> 00:20:16.795
Like Christ getting Himself crucified.

00:20:17.563 --> 00:20:21.741
It was a wise decision to do

00:20:23.313 --> 00:20:26.948
because if you have to prove that life is eternal

00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:30.592
the best thing is to die and show.

00:20:30.793 --> 00:20:35.358
And to be [done] publicly, so that nobody
should say that he was not dead.

00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:39.218
Still there are many people who are saying he was not dead.

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:42.874
Still there are people who are talking this: “He was not dead.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:47.123
He was alive. So he got out of the place.”

00:20:47.324 --> 00:20:51.657
Because they don’t know how to explain!

00:20:51.966 --> 00:20:58.299
So he had to die publicly

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:05.285
and then his resurrection was to be seen
by many people.

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:13.961
This drama had to be performed

00:21:14.162 --> 00:21:21.716
for you to have the wisdom to know that life is eternal.

00:21:22.835 --> 00:21:27.627
It doesn’t mean that he was weak, by any chance.

00:21:32.136 --> 00:21:37.642
So the idea of our aggression, or our suppression

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:45.301
Both come from either fear

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:54.301
or some sort of a satanic pleasure

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.301
to oppress others

00:21:58.686 --> 00:22:03.977
So wisdom lies in seeing yourself also

00:22:04.502 --> 00:22:07.275
See how wisdom is so important!

00:22:07.476 --> 00:22:12.748
Throughout if you find, in every chakra resides pranava

00:22:12.949 --> 00:22:15.696
is the life of every chakra.

00:22:15.897 --> 00:22:21.605
Because it is the wisdom that tells you whether you are in the chakra or not.

00:22:22.797 --> 00:22:24.692
So how wisdom is [so] important

00:22:24.797 --> 00:22:27.300
that you even become a sakshi if you have wisdom

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.154
otherwise you cannot

00:22:28.355 --> 00:22:34.599
You become a witness only when you have that focal point

00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:42.000
adjusted to your centre of gravity

00:22:42.324 --> 00:22:45.550
That is wisdom!

00:22:46.561 --> 00:22:49.427
When people tell me about somebody who has harmed them

00:22:49.628 --> 00:22:54.461
they paint such a dark picture of the whole thing

00:22:54.662 --> 00:23:01.458
as if it was another war that was fought.

00:23:03.619 --> 00:23:05.287
Then you go and listen to another side,

00:23:05.488 --> 00:23:10.885
they paint another horrible picture
of this side.

00:23:11.317 --> 00:23:16.567
Between these two pictures you stand.

00:23:16.768 --> 00:23:22.271
You find the one is reflecting the other,
the other is reflecting the other.

00:23:24.998 --> 00:23:32.352
There is no end to it, it’s eternally going
on from this to that, to that to this.

00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:38.519
How do you end it up?

00:23:39.286 --> 00:23:47.762
Only by your wisdom, by understanding it’s an illusion.

00:23:47.963 --> 00:23:52.172
The main thing is the mirror on which it is reflected,

00:23:52.373 --> 00:23:58.710
It’s just an illusion that is appearing, and we are worried about it.

00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:03.248
The whole illusion will drop out as soon as you just see the mirror

00:24:03.449 --> 00:24:07.462
and don’t worry about the reflections.

00:24:09.846 --> 00:24:15.377
They’ll come and go: it is for you just to witness it, that’s all.

00:24:15.578 --> 00:24:20.201
It’s not..the mirror is a mirror, which is a solid thing,

00:24:20.411 --> 00:24:24.524
and all the reflections are illusions.

00:24:26.843 --> 00:24:35.728
That’s how we miss all the sweetness of our own being.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:46.598
Wisdom lies in understanding that you are the Spirit.

00:24:46.805 --> 00:24:49.800
You are not all these illusions. You are the Spirit.

00:24:49.805 --> 00:24:53.492
You are the Spirit.

00:24:53.735 --> 00:24:57.601
The attention was, as animals, was on food only, you can say.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.752
You were aware of food, nothing else but food only.

00:25:01.953 --> 00:25:04.556
This grows higher and higher in awareness,

00:25:04.757 --> 00:25:08.000
then he came up to a point where he started thinking that

00:25:08.194 --> 00:25:11.000
he is the prime minister

00:25:11.194 --> 00:25:13.414
or he is an actor or an actress

00:25:13.615 --> 00:25:17.237
and this and that and so-called things they have achieved.

00:25:17.438 --> 00:25:23.045
Or maybe they start thinking - oh, they are atheists

00:25:23.246 --> 00:25:25.194
agnostics and all sorts of things, you see.

00:25:25.246 --> 00:25:28.194
Communists!

00:25:28.246 --> 00:25:34.194
And specialists!

00:25:41.116 --> 00:25:43.000
It’s a drama going on!

00:25:43.516 --> 00:25:45.859
They are wearing wigs after wigs.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.967
If they like this wig they’ll wear this, otherwise throw away!

00:25:49.168 --> 00:25:52.026
This has killed the romance completely!

00:25:52.227 --> 00:25:56.682
You start loving the wigs of a person!

00:25:59.317 --> 00:26:03.076
And wigs can be bought!

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.076
They could be exchanged.

00:26:07.278 --> 00:26:12.905
If you go into the market, you can get about ten types of wigs.

00:26:13.106 --> 00:26:19.055
Supposing you say, “Oh, I like this colour for the hair,”

00:26:19.256 --> 00:26:23.871
so the lady will go and wear that and come out

00:26:24.072 --> 00:26:27.846
and then you’ll like her for the wig that she has got

00:26:28.047 --> 00:26:32.637
Then another may wear the same

00:26:32.838 --> 00:26:40.721
Or this same lady, who looks nice with one wig,

00:26:40.922 --> 00:26:43.303
could bore you completely!

00:26:43.504 --> 00:26:52.037
Because there’s no living dynamism, that charisma

00:26:52.238 --> 00:26:56.208
Every moment is so beautiful

00:26:56.238 --> 00:26:58.248
It breaks into new waves

00:26:58.349 --> 00:27:02.175
of such beautiful colours and beautiful music.

00:27:02.376 --> 00:27:08.419
That’s all lost with these bought images.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:14.139
Every minute the image changes, with a living personality,

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.913
into tremendous beauty.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.913
But the first point is the wisdom

00:27:18.114 --> 00:27:20.840
to know that our images cannot be purchased

00:27:21.041 --> 00:27:24.000
or bought or created or made.

00:27:24.041 --> 00:27:27.675
They evolve!

00:27:29.026 --> 00:27:32.283
So we have to only see to our evolving force..

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:35.312
are we nearer it or are we out of it?

00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:40.000
Are we moving with our evolving force

00:27:40.195 --> 00:27:44.031
Of getting ourselves crucified

00:27:44.195 --> 00:27:52.231
with all these artificial misidentifications that says that,

00:27:52.432 --> 00:27:54.300
You are this, you are that.

00:27:54.432 --> 00:27:56.850
You are nothing but a seeker.

00:27:57.051 --> 00:27:59.535
It’s a category, I have told many-a-times

00:27:59.651 --> 00:28:01.535
that you are a seeker and you have to seek

00:28:01.736 --> 00:28:05.513
Now, what do you seek? Is your Spirit.

00:28:05.714 --> 00:28:08.549
And once you have found it, establish yourself on that.

00:28:08.714 --> 00:28:09.849
That’s what you are!

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:16.321
And to know that you are that Spirit itself is so satisfying

00:28:16.522 --> 00:28:22.341
is itself emitting wisdom in you

00:28:22.422 --> 00:28:25.000
Which is so joy giving

00:28:25.142 --> 00:28:27.000
and is nothing but love

00:28:27.142 --> 00:28:28.941
It’s love, I tell you!

00:28:29.142 --> 00:28:31.507
I mean, I cannot go beyond this.

00:28:31.708 --> 00:28:39.140
There’s no word in human language to say
what is love.

00:28:39.341 --> 00:28:43.237
To me it is nothing but silence.

00:28:43.341 --> 00:28:46.737
Everything stops at that point.

00:28:46.938 --> 00:28:51.719
This feeling within yourself, where the wisdom is becoming love,

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.123
and love becomes wisdom.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:59.123
that’s the real integration of life.

00:28:59.324 --> 00:29:01.962
Open your hearts!

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Allow Shri Ganesha to be settled in that

00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:11.246
That innocence which enhances everything.

00:29:11.447 --> 00:29:13.291
Look at the little ones.

00:29:13.447 --> 00:29:15.291
How they came forward to give me flowers.

00:29:15.492 --> 00:29:20.740
Every step, every movement was so joyous

00:29:20.941 --> 00:29:25.443
was creating such a beautiful, delicate ripple in my heart.

00:29:25.644 --> 00:29:30.092
And it’s written as history for me,

00:29:30.293 --> 00:29:37.159
to see these little, little sweet, innocent Ganeshas coming forward

00:29:37.545 --> 00:29:41.930
And the wisdom becomes so powerful

00:29:42.131 --> 00:29:46.648
that you know the source of love as Ganesha in you.

00:29:46.849 --> 00:29:49.534
For him, he did not know anybody else but one

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.834
That which is the source of love.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.832
Never questioned, never argued. No alternatives!

00:30:01.033 --> 00:30:07.969
No new ideas came to his mind.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.969
It's just taking in.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:17.780
Working it out within yourself and the whole thing just works out.

00:30:17.981 --> 00:30:22.780
The more you enter into it, you will
understand that you have really entered

00:30:22.981 --> 00:30:26.207
into the Kingdom of God where he looks after everyone.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.000
You want a house? All right, have it!

00:30:28.075 --> 00:30:32.187
What do you want? You want that? Alright!

00:30:32.275 --> 00:30:33.187
You have a problem? Have it.

00:30:33.388 --> 00:30:37.480
It’s all God’s, the own thing. Who owns it but God?

00:30:37.681 --> 00:30:41.978
He is the One who owns everything and He’s
the One who enjoys everything.

00:30:42.179 --> 00:30:45.679
And he wants you to enjoy everything.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:52.802
Only through the power of your wisdom that you can achieve it

00:30:53.003 --> 00:31:01.356
Today, You all have to show a part of that achievement in your wisdom

00:31:01.557 --> 00:31:07.433
in which there is no artificiality. It’s so natural.

00:31:08.586 --> 00:31:13.660
But natural doesn’t mean baser. Some
people think to be angry is also natural.

00:31:13.861 --> 00:31:17.718
But you are a human being and
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:20.778
Whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:26.060
is not the same as whatever is natural
to a buffalo.

00:31:27.033 --> 00:31:31.605
We have nothing to learn from them,
they have to learn from us.

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:35.864
So whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

00:31:36.065 --> 00:31:39.916
has to be learnt in the school of wisdom.

00:31:40.117 --> 00:31:43.561
Not by any rules or anything

00:31:43.762 --> 00:31:46.361
that I say, “You don’t do this,” and, “You do this!”

00:31:46.562 --> 00:31:51.929
“You are not to do like that.” “You are not
to do this way!”

00:31:54.952 --> 00:32:03.355
Even in the hand if you see: this portion is Australia.

00:32:04.136 --> 00:32:09.832
Now just see: this portion is the source for all the fingers

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:13.383
is the connecting point, this is your point

00:32:13.433 --> 00:32:17.783
But it doesn’t say anything!

00:32:17.984 --> 00:32:21.488
For example, this thumb means something,

00:32:21.689 --> 00:32:23.000
this finger means something

00:32:23.001 --> 00:32:24.137
this means something

00:32:24.338 --> 00:32:29.258
but this doesn’t say anything, doesn’t do anything.

00:32:29.459 --> 00:32:32.455
But without this nothing exists.

00:32:32.656 --> 00:32:37.973
If it is cut out here, you are paralysed,
all the movements are finished, you see.

00:32:38.174 --> 00:32:47.516
This is the connecting link with the divine
and the guiding link.

00:32:47.717 --> 00:32:49.557
This only tells which finger to move

00:32:49.717 --> 00:32:52.557
where to take, how to contract which muscle.

00:32:52.758 --> 00:32:58.740
All of this is controlled in this portion.

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:07.956
The day will come when the information
will reach the whole world

00:33:08.157 --> 00:33:13.039
through the awakening of Ganesha in my children

00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:16.039
the Sahaja Yogis in Australia.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:22.505
And the whole world is going to get the blessings coming into it

00:33:22.706 --> 00:33:26.184
Of course, you know that Kundalini is in India

00:33:26.706 --> 00:33:31.184
and only then the Kundalini can rise.

00:33:31.385 --> 00:33:39.698
But one thing you have to remember

00:33:40.142 --> 00:33:46.995
is that you are really placed at a very pivotal point here

00:33:47.196 --> 00:33:52.132
and that the responsibility is too much on you.

00:33:53.317 --> 00:33:59.925
And the responsibility is to keep the whole atmosphere pure

00:34:00.126 --> 00:34:04.120
and send forth all the fragrance of the lotus.

00:34:04.321 --> 00:34:10.786
Though maybe you will feel you are surrounded by all the mud and everything,

00:34:10.987 --> 00:34:17.092
but still you have to be very strong lotuses.

00:34:17.293 --> 00:34:22.597
For the whole world you have to come up

00:34:22.773 --> 00:34:28.050
and send forth that beautiful fragrance

00:34:28.251 --> 00:34:34.867
of announcement that the Blossom Time has come.

00:34:36.211 --> 00:34:39.040
I was asking for the river’s name

00:34:39.211 --> 00:34:41.040
what’s the name of the river

00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:44.657
I wonder if you thought about it

00:34:44.741 --> 00:34:47.657
See, the river’s name is ‘Parramatta’

00:34:47.858 --> 00:34:53.010
‘Para’ in Greek means ‘above, beyond’ should be Para

00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:57.000
And ‘Mata’ means ‘the mother’

00:34:58.211 --> 00:35:01.979
Your river’s name itself is Parramatta.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:08.662
It’s a Greek word and how the Greeks
have known this word ‘Parramatta’?

00:35:08.863 --> 00:35:12.884
This river had to be here, the Adi Shakti itself only, had to be here

00:35:13.085 --> 00:35:17.097
to bless the Ganesha all the time which has to do the work.

00:35:17.298 --> 00:35:22.273
He’s the one who sorts out

00:35:22.298 --> 00:35:24.673
The Lambodara!

00:35:26.162 --> 00:35:32.675
The one you will see in the Sistine Chapel, very well pointed out.

00:35:32.876 --> 00:35:34.581
It’s a huge big stomach.

00:35:34.606 --> 00:35:37.000
It’s really an Australian character, personality,

00:35:38.782 --> 00:35:46.039
standing there, sorting out people,
throwing left to the right.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.194
It’s so beautiful, I wish you could get
that picture some time.

00:35:50.395 --> 00:35:55.148
And you will be surprised – it’s an
Australian. you can see it perfectly -

00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:58.447
it’s Australian character.

00:35:58.648 --> 00:36:04.936
That is Christ, absolutely an Australian
body, standing up.

00:36:05.137 --> 00:36:09.330
I don’t know how Michelangelo could see that so clearly

00:36:09.531 --> 00:36:14.581
that he had to be Australian like that.

00:36:20.201 --> 00:36:26.353
It has been so beautiful to come down here.

00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:28.353
So beautiful.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:38.420
It’s blissful for you maybe, but for me it’s nothing but complete joy.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:43.420
complete joy.

00:36:45.104 --> 00:36:52.707
I had told that I will not do anything
after three years time;

00:36:52.908 --> 00:36:54.281
I will just settle down

00:36:54.298 --> 00:36:57.281
because the saintly person is not supposed

00:36:57.482 --> 00:36:59.904
to move from places to places, they must settle down,

00:37:00.105 --> 00:37:04.868
they must have their own round pillow that’s called as takiya,

00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:06.827
and you are not to leave that.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:12.827
But I am a Mother who is moving all over.

00:37:13.028 --> 00:37:18.939
And can you imagine, I’ve been all over
the places, but never to Australia before.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:27.920
So to come here first thing was so great
that even,

00:37:28.121 --> 00:37:33.011
today I have not been able to put
all that into words.

00:37:33.212 --> 00:37:36.711
May God bless you all.

00:38:00.755 --> 00:38:06.613
You are really the Ganeshas, the amount
of food you have.
