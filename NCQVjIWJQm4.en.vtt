WEBVTT

00:02.111 --> 00:11.833
I’m just trying to remember if I had a more
fantastic birthday than this!

00:14.830 --> 00:26.793
Where words do not come, there the joy
cannot be expressed.

00:27.734 --> 00:34.905
When it becomes so deep, that there is no movement.

00:39.405 --> 00:41.628
This is a great country.

00:41.705 --> 00:46.528
Australia has been created

00:50.131 --> 00:54.973
for a special purpose in Sahaja Yoga.

00:58.481 --> 01:10.900
This is the Mooladhara chakra, where resides Shri Ganesha, of this world.

01:12.404 --> 01:24.596
How important it is to keep this centre awakened within us.

01:25.552 --> 01:30.410
The information about my coming

01:33.117 --> 01:39.199
can only be broadcasted from this centre.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.918
Then the world Kundalini is going to rise.

01:44.119 --> 01:47.400
When you are putting your hands towards me,

01:47.655 --> 01:55.706
then the divine love passes through
your fingers,

01:55.943 --> 02:03.057
goes down through your Ida and Pingala

02:03.258 --> 02:10.970
and informs Shri Ganesha about my presence

02:11.184 --> 02:15.392
and then the Kundalini rises.

02:20.389 --> 02:35.210
So today, we should say, is a great day
in the history of divine work,

02:36.181 --> 02:41.465
where I came to Australia.

02:44.060 --> 02:49.431
They asked me, “Was there any incarnation
in Australia?"

02:49.632 --> 02:55.738
Did God visit Australia in human form?

02:56.160 --> 03:03.388
I said, “It’s not easy to reach Shri Ganesh!”

03:03.589 --> 03:09.084
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh could not reach Shri Ganesh.

03:09.285 --> 03:15.866
And you know that he is placed like a lotus

03:16.075 --> 03:39.004
where all kinds of people who are insulted,
tortured, ignored, are saved.

03:39.867 --> 03:49.877
Here he really decides whom to save
from hell, and whom not to save.

03:50.078 --> 03:54.101
God’s decisions are very different,
they are absolute.

03:54.302 --> 03:59.267
Human decisions are extremely cruel
and blind.

03:59.468 --> 04:07.184
And today you find so many saints in this
Mooladhara.

04:07.385 --> 04:13.181
This is the work of Shri Ganesh.

04:13.382 --> 04:18.128
He has called you on this great chakra

04:18.329 --> 04:24.991
where Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha
also cannot enter in it

04:25.207 --> 04:31.418
that you should stay here and grow
into beautiful saints

04:31.619 --> 04:36.093
of very great magnitude in spirituality.

04:36.294 --> 04:41.979
Such glory is to him, is such a fortunate thing,

04:42.180 --> 04:45.343
and such a blessing,

04:45.544 --> 04:51.232
that even Indians could be jealous of you.

04:58.993 --> 05:09.421
One has to see how Shri Ganesha acts within us.

05:09.679 --> 05:14.544
It’s very important to recognise him,

05:14.600 --> 05:18.944
to understand him and to imbibe,

05:19.145 --> 05:25.633
otherwise, you will be wasting all His
energies staying in this place,

05:25.834 --> 05:31.894
living in this place, so close to him.

05:35.636 --> 05:39.356
And though he is the giver of wisdom,

05:39.565 --> 05:46.211
I wonder how many people understand
the word ‘wisdom’.

05:46.757 --> 05:52.130
Wisdom is the centre of gravity within us

05:52.331 --> 05:58.469
which gives us the fulcrum on which
we rotate,

05:58.670 --> 06:01.878
by which we realise that we are inclined

06:02.079 --> 06:05.985
to the left or to the right.

06:08.593 --> 06:17.737
This fulcrum we have to be aware of,

06:17.938 --> 06:22.569
because otherwise we will not know
how far we have gone.

06:22.770 --> 06:29.648
Not only [that], but we should know that it is so much

06:29.849 --> 06:37.776
the centre of gravity and our fulcrum - so close.

06:37.977 --> 06:44.453
Because if your centre of gravity and
fulcrum are separated

06:44.654 --> 06:47.291
there’s no integration.

06:47.354 --> 06:51.291
You can be ruined completely.

06:52.228 --> 07:01.341
So wisdom means this integration between
your understanding

07:01.852 --> 07:12.433
and the understanding of Shri Ganesha, within you.

07:13.445 --> 07:22.000
For example, we go to extremes, extremes of behaviour.

07:22.162 --> 07:25.549
I would give you a very simple example:

07:25.662 --> 07:28.549
I was going to Hong Kong

07:29.140 --> 07:34.884
and the lady who organised it,
she telephoned to me again and again

07:35.085 --> 07:41.158
and she told me that, “A big batch of people are coming to receive you

07:41.819 --> 07:49.214
and you are going to be on the television
from the moment you land..

07:49.415 --> 07:51.705
and this is going to happen and that is going to happen”.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.972
Every day spending so much money.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.972
Describing to me the scene

07:57.173 --> 08:02.514
that I’ll be a “hot news” and all sorts of things, you see,

08:02.573 --> 08:05.514
encourage lots of people to come and see you

08:06.070 --> 08:09.188
And she was on and on and on.

08:09.270 --> 08:13.188
And also, she told Dr Warren

08:13.398 --> 08:18.642
except for giving the newspaper [advert] she didn’t
have to pay for it.

08:22.136 --> 08:25.312
It was going too far.

08:28.677 --> 08:33.432
At that juncture, just it was not necessary

08:34.158 --> 08:38.982
to go to such a limit and plan it out that there will be people coming

08:39.183 --> 08:42.000
inside the aeroplane to receive me

08:42.100 --> 08:43.535
makes no difference to me!

08:43.736 --> 08:48.161
And there would be a car waiting near
the aeroplane just to receive me.

08:48.362 --> 08:56.067
I don’t know! I don’t know who was waiting
where, at every point!

08:56.848 --> 08:59.459
And when we reached there, it was six
hours late

08:59.707 --> 09:04.924
and I told Warren, “It’s all going to be a fizzled out, take it easy!”

09:07.911 --> 09:12.695
And the plane just deposited us in Bangkok!

09:12.911 --> 09:17.095
There was no way – six hours.

09:17.296 --> 09:20.415
And we had to take another plane

09:20.616 --> 09:25.646
in which nobody came in

09:25.656 --> 09:27.646
no car

09:27.656 --> 09:28.646
nothing.

09:28.847 --> 09:32.552
We went down looking for her, couldn’t see
her.

09:32.753 --> 09:37.594
Telephoned to the hotel, they said, “No arrangements thrown.”

09:37.795 --> 09:42.585
Warren thought, “Mother has gone to another extreme now!”

09:44.402 --> 09:51.705
Quite worried that there’s no one to receive us at the airport in Hong Kong.

09:51.983 --> 09:54.304
It’s all a joke

09:54.505 --> 10:00.031
Going to extremes has to be corrected in you as well.

10:00.232 --> 10:03.910
because if you get successful with your this kind of planning,

10:04.111 --> 10:06.827
then you’ll go on doing this kind of artificial planning

10:07.028 --> 10:10.087
and not the planning of the divine.

10:10.288 --> 10:12.976
The divine has its own plans

10:13.000 --> 10:15.976
and we have to feel the plans of the divine.

10:16.177 --> 10:20.831
It works it out. You are just an instrument to work it out.

10:21.040 --> 10:28.725
So if you try to do something of your own,
something too much,

10:28.926 --> 10:35.162
then who is going to suggest the balance - is Shri Ganesh

10:35.363 --> 10:39.633
And that balance, once it’s established in you

10:39.834 --> 10:43.137
you know how you should balance yourself.

10:43.334 --> 10:46.137
Now, there is no alternative

10:46.338 --> 10:50.166
for Sahaj Yog, no alternative.

10:50.238 --> 10:52.166
One must know.

10:52.766 --> 10:55.917
Everything that is living has no alternatives.

10:56.118 --> 11:04.626
For example, if a mango tree says that,
“I will create a pomegranate,” it cannot!

11:04.835 --> 11:10.354
There’s no alternatives. Whatever is there, it has to see and enjoy;

11:10.555 --> 11:13.393
but not to force its way on it.

11:13.594 --> 11:17.031
This is one of the things we have to understand

11:17.232 --> 11:21.087
to establish our wisdom.

11:22.083 --> 11:32.155
Because of our concept, our idea, our anything,

11:32.356 --> 11:40.608
even about God for example, about our achievements itself,

11:40.809 --> 11:45.695
can be absolutely wrong if you have no wisdom.

11:45.896 --> 11:54.714
But in nature, if you see, those who grow

11:54.915 --> 11:59.111
are never bothered about what shape
they are going to take, do they?

11:59.312 --> 12:05.718
Does a tree measure itself up to know how
many dimensions it is going to grow?

12:05.919 --> 12:09.740
It grows as much as it can

12:09.919 --> 12:12.340
slowly, steadily

12:12.541 --> 12:17.644
in coordination with nature itself.

12:17.845 --> 12:28.296
Like that, the wisdom is the one that understands.

12:29.903 --> 12:33.479
It is an establishment, is a state of mind.

12:33.702 --> 12:39.877
We can say it’s the state of being, when you become wisdom.

12:41.726 --> 12:49.327
Such a wisdom outside, also expresses so beautifully.

12:49.528 --> 12:55.993
Such a wisdom gives you a gentleman and a gentlelady

12:59.682 --> 13:06.438
only in a personality which is settled down.

13:06.928 --> 13:09.222
If you are frustrated

13:09.228 --> 13:11.222
and if there’s a problem

13:11.423 --> 13:14.915
if you are unhappy, if you are suppressed

13:15.116 --> 13:24.484
any extremes will not allow this flower of wisdom to grow.

13:24.685 --> 13:27.470
So even in frustration you have to look back,

13:27.671 --> 13:30.251
you have to stand back and see for yourself,

13:30.452 --> 13:32.405
“Why am I to be so frustrated?”

13:32.606 --> 13:38.220
Count your blessings one by one.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.220
Count your blessings one by one.

13:40.421 --> 13:46.634
I’ll say again, count your blessings one by one.

13:46.835 --> 13:48.716
Once you start counting your blessings,

13:48.917 --> 13:55.220
you will find in such a short time, where are you.

13:56.594 --> 13:59.831
Now the extreme projections of the mind can take you to:

14:00.032 --> 14:06.231
“I’m not going to face!” and you would like to do it.

14:11.428 --> 14:20.222
But in wise projection, you can see this, that you are what you have to be.

14:20.423 --> 14:23.737
You are saints.

14:24.747 --> 14:28.211
You were born to be saints in this great country.

14:28.412 --> 14:31.788
You are specially blessed people in the heavens,

14:31.989 --> 14:41.390
and are sent on this Earth to do this Maha Yoga, to spread it.

14:41.591 --> 14:44.073
You have achieved that state.

14:44.274 --> 14:49.424
And if you are saints, you should not be bothered as to a few things like,

14:49.625 --> 14:54.500
“Oh! I haven’t got a suitcase” or something
sort of a thing like that

14:54.701 --> 14:57.622
which you have never been very much bothered before.

14:57.823 --> 15:00.000
Can you see that?

15:00.123 --> 15:03.370
Any kind of extreme behaviour

15:03.571 --> 15:07.855
For example, for materialism you people are not so bad

15:08.056 --> 15:14.805
in the sense that you understand the value
of aesthetics.

15:15.006 --> 15:20.282
But in possessiveness let us take the wise
path, the wisdom

15:20.483 --> 15:22.077
logical, it has to be logical

15:22.083 --> 15:31.077
What do we possess in this world?

15:31.759 --> 15:35.801
Just think of one thing that we can possess!

15:36.009 --> 15:39.712
Except for your own Spirit, you don’t possess anything.

15:39.913 --> 15:45.270
Except for your evolutionary development, you don’t possess anything.

15:45.471 --> 15:48.440
For example, now you are a saint you’ll be born a saint always

15:48.641 --> 15:52.170
this is what you possess

15:52.241 --> 15:53.170
The rest you don’t possess

15:53.371 --> 15:55.258
It’s logical, logical.

15:55.371 --> 15:59.258
You need not to be realised to understand what I am saying.

16:02.610 --> 16:07.119
So why should we worry about our possessions?

16:07.320 --> 16:12.225
When you leave this worry, this is another wisdom,

16:12.426 --> 16:14.276
this is the higher wisdom

16:14.426 --> 16:17.876
which you develop within yourself.

16:18.077 --> 16:22.860
And if we leave our possessions, our material problems are solved.

16:23.061 --> 16:25.500
‘Leave’ doesn’t mean you throw them in the sea, 

16:25.503 --> 16:29.000
but the attachment to it dissolves

16:29.003 --> 16:31.497
It is solved.

16:31.503 --> 16:33.897
Let me give you an example

16:34.098 --> 16:38.000
Like Kay lost her travellers’ cheques

16:38.098 --> 16:40.699
she did not know, she was not knowing

16:40.900 --> 16:43.000
Suddenly one man bumped into her.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.177
I was with her.

16:45.378 --> 16:48.589
He said, “Imagine, I never knew I was going to meet you!”

16:48.790 --> 16:52.519
He said, “I went to a particular cashier or somebody"

16:52.720 --> 16:56.903
And he said “Do you know this lady? I’ve got her travellers cheques with me.”

16:57.104 --> 17:00.981
And here, suddenly, I bump into you!”

17:01.182 --> 17:04.310
How the news has been organised, in the nature you see,

17:04.511 --> 17:10.713
when the flowers bloom, how these bees come all the way.

17:10.914 --> 17:18.223
How the birds fly all the way from Siberia to Australia?

17:18.424 --> 17:22.121
What wisdom, is that magnetism in them"

17:22.124 --> 17:25.121
the magnetism that is in the Mother Earth"

17:25.322 --> 17:33.689
which tells them, “This is the way you have to go.”

17:34.196 --> 17:38.252
So we have to see to this magnetism within us:

17:38.453 --> 17:45.303
What makes us magnetic

17:45.629 --> 17:49.342
is not what we could have, what unnatural
things we have

17:49.543 --> 17:51.789
but what naturally we have achieved within

17:51.990 --> 17:54.986
and we are not afraid to express it

17:55.187 --> 18:00.286
In fear you are never aggressive

18:04.649 --> 18:10.953
but even in fearlessness you are never aggressive

18:11.154 --> 18:17.633
In fear you might say that you are not afraid

18:17.834 --> 18:21.636
but you could be aggressive

18:24.615 --> 18:28.283
When people look very frightened, if you push them

18:28.484 --> 18:34.071
to the extreme of fright, they can come back

18:34.272 --> 18:36.686
But if you are fearless, you are innocent

18:36.700 --> 18:40.686
you are just standing and watching

18:43.573 --> 18:50.094
Fearlessness never means aggression

18:51.165 --> 18:55.977
So the confusion of our own concepts

18:56.178 --> 18:59.000
can only be cleared out

18:59.001 --> 19:01.895
if there is light within us.

19:02.096 --> 19:07.615
For us, if somebody is aggressing us, then we think

19:07.816 --> 19:11.345
[that] if we do not aggress the other
person, we are frightened

19:11.546 --> 19:14.597
then we are useless,

19:14.600 --> 19:19.997
we are weak, we are weak people

19:20.148 --> 19:22.000
so we should fight back.

19:22.148 --> 19:26.698
Even when you are fighting back, you are weak people.

19:27.673 --> 19:32.825
If it was not so, what is there to fight
back?

19:33.026 --> 19:37.805
In fearlessness you become the witness.

19:38.006 --> 19:40.102
You see the joke

19:40.116 --> 19:44.102
joke behind all this extreme behaviour of another person.

19:44.303 --> 19:48.420
And also you know the technique, kaushalam.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.436
Yoga also means kaushalam, it means technique

19:51.621 --> 19:53.436
how to manage the show

19:53.637 --> 20:00.201
by which his action doesn’t trouble you

20:01.000 --> 20:03.201
if you want to.

20:03.402 --> 20:08.024
If you don’t want, you can even take
the action upon yourself, to prove it

20:08.225 --> 20:12.793
that, “Whatever you are doing is a little
silly and stupid.”

20:12.994 --> 20:16.795
Like Christ getting Himself crucified.

20:17.563 --> 20:21.741
It was a wise decision to do

20:23.313 --> 20:26.948
because if you have to prove that life is eternal

20:27.149 --> 20:30.592
the best thing is to die and show.

20:30.793 --> 20:35.358
And to be [done] publicly, so that nobody
should say that he was not dead.

20:35.559 --> 20:39.218
Still there are many people who are saying he was not dead.

20:39.419 --> 20:42.874
Still there are people who are talking this: “He was not dead.

20:43.075 --> 20:47.123
He was alive. So he got out of the place.”

20:47.324 --> 20:51.657
Because they don’t know how to explain!

20:51.966 --> 20:58.299
So he had to die publicly

20:58.500 --> 21:05.285
and then his resurrection was to be seen
by many people.

21:09.469 --> 21:13.961
This drama had to be performed

21:14.162 --> 21:21.716
for you to have the wisdom to know that life is eternal.

21:22.835 --> 21:27.627
It doesn’t mean that he was weak, by any chance.

21:32.136 --> 21:37.642
So the idea of our aggression, or our suppression

21:37.700 --> 21:45.301
Both come from either fear

21:45.700 --> 21:54.301
or some sort of a satanic pleasure

21:54.700 --> 21:58.301
to oppress others

21:58.686 --> 22:03.977
So wisdom lies in seeing yourself also

22:04.502 --> 22:07.275
See how wisdom is so important!

22:07.476 --> 22:12.748
Throughout if you find, in every chakra resides pranava

22:12.949 --> 22:15.696
is the life of every chakra.

22:15.897 --> 22:21.605
Because it is the wisdom that tells you whether you are in the chakra or not.

22:22.797 --> 22:24.692
So how wisdom is [so] important

22:24.797 --> 22:27.300
that you even become a sakshi if you have wisdom

22:27.400 --> 22:28.154
otherwise you cannot

22:28.355 --> 22:34.599
You become a witness only when you have that focal point

22:35.355 --> 22:42.000
adjusted to your centre of gravity

22:42.324 --> 22:45.550
That is wisdom!

22:46.561 --> 22:49.427
When people tell me about somebody who has harmed them

22:49.628 --> 22:54.461
they paint such a dark picture of the whole thing

22:54.662 --> 23:01.458
as if it was another war that was fought.

23:03.619 --> 23:05.287
Then you go and listen to another side,

23:05.488 --> 23:10.885
they paint another horrible picture
of this side.

23:11.317 --> 23:16.567
Between these two pictures you stand.

23:16.768 --> 23:22.271
You find the one is reflecting the other,
the other is reflecting the other.

23:24.998 --> 23:32.352
There is no end to it, it’s eternally going
on from this to that, to that to this.

23:34.841 --> 23:38.519
How do you end it up?

23:39.286 --> 23:47.762
Only by your wisdom, by understanding it’s an illusion.

23:47.963 --> 23:52.172
The main thing is the mirror on which it is reflected,

23:52.373 --> 23:58.710
It’s just an illusion that is appearing, and we are worried about it.

23:58.911 --> 24:03.248
The whole illusion will drop out as soon as you just see the mirror

24:03.449 --> 24:07.462
and don’t worry about the reflections.

24:09.846 --> 24:15.377
They’ll come and go: it is for you just to witness it, that’s all.

24:15.578 --> 24:20.201
It’s not..the mirror is a mirror, which is a solid thing,

24:20.411 --> 24:24.524
and all the reflections are illusions.

24:26.843 --> 24:35.728
That’s how we miss all the sweetness of our own being.

24:40.380 --> 24:46.598
Wisdom lies in understanding that you are the Spirit.

24:46.805 --> 24:49.800
You are not all these illusions. You are the Spirit.

24:49.805 --> 24:53.492
You are the Spirit.

24:53.735 --> 24:57.601
The attention was, as animals, was on food only, you can say.

24:57.810 --> 25:01.752
You were aware of food, nothing else but food only.

25:01.953 --> 25:04.556
This grows higher and higher in awareness,

25:04.757 --> 25:08.000
then he came up to a point where he started thinking that

25:08.194 --> 25:11.000
he is the prime minister

25:11.194 --> 25:13.414
or he is an actor or an actress

25:13.615 --> 25:17.237
and this and that and so-called things they have achieved.

25:17.438 --> 25:23.045
Or maybe they start thinking - oh, they are atheists

25:23.246 --> 25:25.194
agnostics and all sorts of things, you see.

25:25.246 --> 25:28.194
Communists!

25:28.246 --> 25:34.194
And specialists!

25:41.116 --> 25:43.000
It’s a drama going on!

25:43.516 --> 25:45.859
They are wearing wigs after wigs.

25:46.060 --> 25:48.967
If they like this wig they’ll wear this, otherwise throw away!

25:49.168 --> 25:52.026
This has killed the romance completely!

25:52.227 --> 25:56.682
You start loving the wigs of a person!

25:59.317 --> 26:03.076
And wigs can be bought!

26:05.000 --> 26:07.076
They could be exchanged.

26:07.278 --> 26:12.905
If you go into the market, you can get about ten types of wigs.

26:13.106 --> 26:19.055
Supposing you say, “Oh, I like this colour for the hair,”

26:19.256 --> 26:23.871
so the lady will go and wear that and come out

26:24.072 --> 26:27.846
and then you’ll like her for the wig that she has got

26:28.047 --> 26:32.637
Then another may wear the same

26:32.838 --> 26:40.721
Or this same lady, who looks nice with one wig,

26:40.922 --> 26:43.303
could bore you completely!

26:43.504 --> 26:52.037
Because there’s no living dynamism, that charisma

26:52.238 --> 26:56.208
Every moment is so beautiful

26:56.238 --> 26:58.248
It breaks into new waves

26:58.349 --> 27:02.175
of such beautiful colours and beautiful music.

27:02.376 --> 27:08.419
That’s all lost with these bought images.

27:08.620 --> 27:14.139
Every minute the image changes, with a living personality,

27:14.340 --> 27:15.913
into tremendous beauty.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.913
But the first point is the wisdom

27:18.114 --> 27:20.840
to know that our images cannot be purchased

27:21.041 --> 27:24.000
or bought or created or made.

27:24.041 --> 27:27.675
They evolve!

27:29.026 --> 27:32.283
So we have to only see to our evolving force..

27:32.484 --> 27:35.312
are we nearer it or are we out of it?

27:35.521 --> 27:40.000
Are we moving with our evolving force

27:40.195 --> 27:44.031
Of getting ourselves crucified

27:44.195 --> 27:52.231
with all these artificial misidentifications that says that,

27:52.432 --> 27:54.300
You are this, you are that.

27:54.432 --> 27:56.850
You are nothing but a seeker.

27:57.051 --> 27:59.535
It’s a category, I have told many-a-times

27:59.651 --> 28:01.535
that you are a seeker and you have to seek

28:01.736 --> 28:05.513
Now, what do you seek? Is your Spirit.

28:05.714 --> 28:08.549
And once you have found it, establish yourself on that.

28:08.714 --> 28:09.849
That’s what you are!

28:10.050 --> 28:16.321
And to know that you are that Spirit itself is so satisfying

28:16.522 --> 28:22.341
is itself emitting wisdom in you

28:22.422 --> 28:25.000
Which is so joy giving

28:25.142 --> 28:27.000
and is nothing but love

28:27.142 --> 28:28.941
It’s love, I tell you!

28:29.142 --> 28:31.507
I mean, I cannot go beyond this.

28:31.708 --> 28:39.140
There’s no word in human language to say
what is love.

28:39.341 --> 28:43.237
To me it is nothing but silence.

28:43.341 --> 28:46.737
Everything stops at that point.

28:46.938 --> 28:51.719
This feeling within yourself, where the wisdom is becoming love,

28:51.920 --> 28:54.123
and love becomes wisdom.

28:54.220 --> 28:59.123
that’s the real integration of life.

28:59.324 --> 29:01.962
Open your hearts!

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
Allow Shri Ganesha to be settled in that

29:08.163 --> 29:11.246
That innocence which enhances everything.

29:11.447 --> 29:13.291
Look at the little ones.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.291
How they came forward to give me flowers.

29:15.492 --> 29:20.740
Every step, every movement was so joyous

29:20.941 --> 29:25.443
was creating such a beautiful, delicate ripple in my heart.

29:25.644 --> 29:30.092
And it’s written as history for me,

29:30.293 --> 29:37.159
to see these little, little sweet, innocent Ganeshas coming forward

29:37.545 --> 29:41.930
And the wisdom becomes so powerful

29:42.131 --> 29:46.648
that you know the source of love as Ganesha in you.

29:46.849 --> 29:49.534
For him, he did not know anybody else but one

29:49.600 --> 29:53.834
That which is the source of love.

29:55.120 --> 30:00.832
Never questioned, never argued. No alternatives!

30:01.033 --> 30:07.969
No new ideas came to his mind.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.969
It's just taking in.

30:11.170 --> 30:17.780
Working it out within yourself and the whole thing just works out.

30:17.981 --> 30:22.780
The more you enter into it, you will
understand that you have really entered

30:22.981 --> 30:26.207
into the Kingdom of God where he looks after everyone.

30:26.300 --> 30:28.000
You want a house? All right, have it!

30:28.075 --> 30:32.187
What do you want? You want that? Alright!

30:32.275 --> 30:33.187
You have a problem? Have it.

30:33.388 --> 30:37.480
It’s all God’s, the own thing. Who owns it but God?

30:37.681 --> 30:41.978
He is the One who owns everything and He’s
the One who enjoys everything.

30:42.179 --> 30:45.679
And he wants you to enjoy everything.

30:45.880 --> 30:52.802
Only through the power of your wisdom that you can achieve it

30:53.003 --> 31:01.356
Today, You all have to show a part of that achievement in your wisdom

31:01.557 --> 31:07.433
in which there is no artificiality. It’s so natural.

31:08.586 --> 31:13.660
But natural doesn’t mean baser. Some
people think to be angry is also natural.

31:13.861 --> 31:17.718
But you are a human being and
a Sahaja Yogi.

31:17.919 --> 31:20.778
Whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

31:20.979 --> 31:26.060
is not the same as whatever is natural
to a buffalo.

31:27.033 --> 31:31.605
We have nothing to learn from them,
they have to learn from us.

31:31.806 --> 31:35.864
So whatever is natural to a Sahaja Yogi

31:36.065 --> 31:39.916
has to be learnt in the school of wisdom.

31:40.117 --> 31:43.561
Not by any rules or anything

31:43.762 --> 31:46.361
that I say, “You don’t do this,” and, “You do this!”

31:46.562 --> 31:51.929
“You are not to do like that.” “You are not
to do this way!”

31:54.952 --> 32:03.355
Even in the hand if you see: this portion is Australia.

32:04.136 --> 32:09.832
Now just see: this portion is the source for all the fingers

32:10.033 --> 32:13.383
is the connecting point, this is your point

32:13.433 --> 32:17.783
But it doesn’t say anything!

32:17.984 --> 32:21.488
For example, this thumb means something,

32:21.689 --> 32:23.000
this finger means something

32:23.001 --> 32:24.137
this means something

32:24.338 --> 32:29.258
but this doesn’t say anything, doesn’t do anything.

32:29.459 --> 32:32.455
But without this nothing exists.

32:32.656 --> 32:37.973
If it is cut out here, you are paralysed,
all the movements are finished, you see.

32:38.174 --> 32:47.516
This is the connecting link with the divine
and the guiding link.

32:47.717 --> 32:49.557
This only tells which finger to move

32:49.717 --> 32:52.557
where to take, how to contract which muscle.

32:52.758 --> 32:58.740
All of this is controlled in this portion.

33:02.650 --> 33:07.956
The day will come when the information
will reach the whole world

33:08.157 --> 33:13.039
through the awakening of Ganesha in my children

33:13.157 --> 33:16.039
the Sahaja Yogis in Australia.

33:16.240 --> 33:22.505
And the whole world is going to get the blessings coming into it

33:22.706 --> 33:26.184
Of course, you know that Kundalini is in India

33:26.706 --> 33:31.184
and only then the Kundalini can rise.

33:31.385 --> 33:39.698
But one thing you have to remember

33:40.142 --> 33:46.995
is that you are really placed at a very pivotal point here

33:47.196 --> 33:52.132
and that the responsibility is too much on you.

33:53.317 --> 33:59.925
And the responsibility is to keep the whole atmosphere pure

34:00.126 --> 34:04.120
and send forth all the fragrance of the lotus.

34:04.321 --> 34:10.786
Though maybe you will feel you are surrounded by all the mud and everything,

34:10.987 --> 34:17.092
but still you have to be very strong lotuses.

34:17.293 --> 34:22.597
For the whole world you have to come up

34:22.773 --> 34:28.050
and send forth that beautiful fragrance

34:28.251 --> 34:34.867
of announcement that the Blossom Time has come.

34:36.211 --> 34:39.040
I was asking for the river’s name

34:39.211 --> 34:41.040
what’s the name of the river

34:41.241 --> 34:44.657
I wonder if you thought about it

34:44.741 --> 34:47.657
See, the river’s name is ‘Parramatta’

34:47.858 --> 34:53.010
‘Para’ in Greek means ‘above, beyond’ should be Para

34:53.211 --> 34:57.000
And ‘Mata’ means ‘the mother’

34:58.211 --> 35:01.979
Your river’s name itself is Parramatta.

35:02.180 --> 35:08.662
It’s a Greek word and how the Greeks
have known this word ‘Parramatta’?

35:08.863 --> 35:12.884
This river had to be here, the Adi Shakti itself only, had to be here

35:13.085 --> 35:17.097
to bless the Ganesha all the time which has to do the work.

35:17.298 --> 35:22.273
He’s the one who sorts out

35:22.298 --> 35:24.673
The Lambodara!

35:26.162 --> 35:32.675
The one you will see in the Sistine Chapel, very well pointed out.

35:32.876 --> 35:34.581
It’s a huge big stomach.

35:34.606 --> 35:37.000
It’s really an Australian character, personality,

35:38.782 --> 35:46.039
standing there, sorting out people,
throwing left to the right.

35:46.240 --> 35:50.194
It’s so beautiful, I wish you could get
that picture some time.

35:50.395 --> 35:55.148
And you will be surprised – it’s an
Australian. you can see it perfectly -

35:55.349 --> 35:58.447
it’s Australian character.

35:58.648 --> 36:04.936
That is Christ, absolutely an Australian
body, standing up.

36:05.137 --> 36:09.330
I don’t know how Michelangelo could see that so clearly

36:09.531 --> 36:14.581
that he had to be Australian like that.

36:20.201 --> 36:26.353
It has been so beautiful to come down here.

36:26.401 --> 36:28.353
So beautiful.

36:29.610 --> 36:38.420
It’s blissful for you maybe, but for me it’s nothing but complete joy.

36:38.610 --> 36:43.420
complete joy.

36:45.104 --> 36:52.707
I had told that I will not do anything
after three years time;

36:52.908 --> 36:54.281
I will just settle down

36:54.298 --> 36:57.281
because the saintly person is not supposed

36:57.482 --> 36:59.904
to move from places to places, they must settle down,

37:00.105 --> 37:04.868
they must have their own round pillow that’s called as takiya,

37:05.069 --> 37:06.827
and you are not to leave that.

37:06.920 --> 37:12.827
But I am a Mother who is moving all over.

37:13.028 --> 37:18.939
And can you imagine, I’ve been all over
the places, but never to Australia before.

37:19.140 --> 37:27.920
So to come here first thing was so great
that even,

37:28.121 --> 37:33.011
today I have not been able to put
all that into words.

37:33.212 --> 37:36.711
May God bless you all.

38:00.755 --> 38:06.613
You are really the Ganeshas, the amount
of food you have.
