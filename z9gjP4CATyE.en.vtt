00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Mahashivaratri Puja, Pune (India),
 15 February 2004.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
(Translated from Hindi)

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:53.342
Today we are here to do the Guru's puja

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:08.175
The Guru is praised more than the Deities and the Gods

00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:16.258
Who is this Guru?

00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:25.966
In this, which is the most important shakti?

00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:38.342
The Guru tattwa is the Shiva.

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:57.342
The form of the Shiva's power
we should consider as the Guru's power.

00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:04.966
Because when we take the powers from the Guru's shakti,

00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:15.300
and when the shaktis come within us then
we ourselves become the Guru

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:24.175
And with this, we are blessed for the whole life (Kalyan).

00:03:24.383 --> 00:03:27.966
The one who gets these powers,

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:34.175
it seems he has got all the blessings (kalyan).

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.342
"Kalyan" is a word which is very
hard to explain in a few words.

00:03:41.883 --> 00:03:49.467
"Kalyan" means to get blessed from all the sides.

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:53.383
the obtain joy from all the sides.

00:03:56.008 --> 00:04:00.008
When someone says that in the blessings
 you have got the Kalyan,

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:02.966
what does it mean?

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:05.258
What is Kalyan?

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:14.800
Kalyan means Atma Sakshatkar,
the Self-Realisation.

00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:21.175
Without the Self-Realisation,
you cannot have the Kalyan.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.467
Nobody can understand without having it.

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:33.258
All these things are in the Kalyan.

00:04:34.258 --> 00:04:43.800
Because of this a person gets all the joy,
and he becomes radiant.

00:04:45.966 --> 00:04:54.008
To have this Kalyan, whatever you have to do
you have done it all,

00:04:54.383 --> 00:04:59.175
whatever efforts you have to make
 it has all been made,

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.258
the faith which you have to take,
you have already taken it.

00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:06.008
But when you are all in the "Kalyanmarg" (Path of Kalyan),

00:05:06.258 --> 00:05:08.008
when he has given the mantra to have the Kalyan,

00:05:08.258 --> 00:05:11.258
what does it mean?

00:05:11.883 --> 00:05:16.759
It means that the most important thing

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.966
inside you is samadhan (satisfaction).

00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:25.383
Afterwards you all don't have to search for anything,

00:05:25.883 --> 00:05:29.383
you have all become the Gurus.

00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:35.091
You don't have to take some great things in this moment,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.800
but the blessings of this samadhana

00:05:38.008 --> 00:05:40.383
you all can feel inside yourselves,

00:05:40.883 --> 00:05:43.342
you all can know inside yourselves

00:05:43.966 --> 00:05:48.800
you all can enjoy within yourselves.

00:05:49.008 --> 00:05:55.175
First of all you all can see that the physical diseases,

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:06.258
the physical problems can be removed by this Kalyanmarg,

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:11.383
all the problems which are coming within you

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.800
that prevent you from blossoming,

00:06:17.008 --> 00:06:28.800
can be removed by this Kalyanmarg.

00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:42.883
When you all take to this, you get the Kalyan

00:06:43.883 --> 00:06:51.342
and you have the Self-Realisation.

00:06:52.383 --> 00:06:58.175
In this Shri Mahadeva is helping you.

00:06:59.467 --> 00:07:04.175
When the kundalini opens the sahasrara,

00:07:04.467 --> 00:07:09.175
Shri Mahadeva is sitting over there.

00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:12.342
And because of this, we call Him Mahadeva.

00:07:12.883 --> 00:07:16.883
It means the God of all the Gods, Mahadeva.

00:07:17.383 --> 00:07:22.509
in this Kalyan there are many important aspects.

00:07:23.008 --> 00:07:28.175
The first thing is shanti (peace).

00:07:28.383 --> 00:07:39.258
Mental peace, physical peace and the peace in the family life.

00:07:41.008 --> 00:07:46.175
In the family life there are many problems, many obstacles,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.175
and all these can be solved by the Kalyanmarg.

00:07:52.467 --> 00:08:03.008
Afterwards we cannot even feel the presence of the obstacles.

00:08:03.258 --> 00:08:05.883
In this way we could see many people in the whole world

00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:13.091
getting blessings from this Kalyanmarg and meditating upon it

00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:17.175
and enjoying for the whole life.

00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:22.342
This is the Kalyan by which mankind

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.800
can get the balances within themselves.

00:08:26.342 --> 00:08:29.592
And to obtain this balance,

00:08:29.883 --> 00:08:34.175
you have to go under the protection of the Guru.

00:08:34.467 --> 00:08:41.966
When you become the devotee of a Guru,

00:08:42.175 --> 00:08:47.966
you get the balance and you get everything.

00:08:48.175 --> 00:08:50.800
After this you do not need anything.

00:08:51.008 --> 00:08:55.467
In this way we get the balance

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.175
and we obtain the power of love within ourselves.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:11.383
When mankind obtains this, this whole body rejoices.

00:09:12.008 --> 00:09:18.383
When you obtain this state,

00:09:18.883 --> 00:09:26.966
the shaktis (powers) destroy all the problems,

00:09:27.175 --> 00:09:37.883
the disturbances in the body and the physical state,

00:09:38.467 --> 00:09:47.467
and so many people try very hard to obtain this shakti.

00:09:47.966 --> 00:09:52.800
He can get the shakti only form a person that is self-realised.

00:09:53.008 --> 00:10:02.091
and then he himself becomes in the God's form.

00:10:04.342 --> 00:10:12.008
This is a subject which you can only explain in Hindi language,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:21.966
which says that this Guru Padh you get from somebody else.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:28.883
But that somebody else is itself, is endowed with, the power

00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:34.008
the power of peace of mind, to begin with,

00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:46.883
and also the power to overcome all kinds

00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:52.467
of earthly problems, mental problems, physical problems.

00:10:52.966 --> 00:10:57.800
All these problems you can solve through your mental balance

00:10:58.008 --> 00:11:05.008
and mental blessings from your Guru.

00:11:05.258 --> 00:11:07.091
When you become the Guru,

00:11:07.383 --> 00:11:13.091
you yourself have the power, to bless others.

00:11:13.342 --> 00:11:22.383
With your blessing power you can create a guru out of many.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:33.008
And once the Guru is created and there is a Guru,

00:11:33.258 --> 00:11:38.383
who has this power, it's very satisfying and is very [UNCLEAR: enabling?].

00:11:39.175 --> 00:11:46.383
The satisfaction is so much that you don't want anything.

00:11:46.883 --> 00:11:49.091
This is the power of Shiva.

00:11:50.008 --> 00:11:54.091
You have seen Shiva, doesn't have much clothes,

00:11:54.342 --> 00:11:56.800
He doesn't decorate Himself,

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.467
He is just sitting in meditative mood, all the time.

00:12:01.966 --> 00:12:03.175
He doesn't want anything.

00:12:03.383 --> 00:12:08.883
He's so satisfied with Himself that He doesn't want anything.

00:12:09.258 --> 00:12:15.383
And that is the power you get after the Self-realization,

00:12:15.883 --> 00:12:21.966
if you have a Guru, and Guru of that level and caliber.

00:12:22.258 --> 00:12:25.966
One should not try to become a Guru.

00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:29.258
That's very, impractical.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.091
If you try to become, you'll never.

00:12:32.342 --> 00:12:36.008
It has to come to you automatically,

00:12:36.258 --> 00:12:39.966
without any asking, without any effort.

00:12:40.467 --> 00:12:45.383
So the only way you can get to it is through Dhyana.

00:12:46.008 --> 00:12:48.008
Dhyana is meditation.

00:12:48.342 --> 00:12:50.091
When you meditate,

00:12:50.342 --> 00:12:57.258
just meditate, and meditate, do not ask for anything.

00:12:57.467 --> 00:13:00.467
Meditation itself gives you

00:13:00.966 --> 00:13:08.883
that instrument which can bear this great power of the Guru.

00:13:09.383 --> 00:13:14.383
And then you automatically, you give this power to others;

00:13:14.883 --> 00:13:17.383
you don't have to work it out.

00:13:17.883 --> 00:13:19.467
Just in your presence,

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.091
people can get this power .

00:13:22.342 --> 00:13:27.008
of complete satisfaction

00:13:27.258 --> 00:13:32.467
And there is salvation, for you and for others.

00:13:33.467 --> 00:13:39.008
So all the problems which are faced

00:13:39.258 --> 00:13:43.258
for the journey of ascent are finished

00:13:43.383 --> 00:13:49.883
and you [are or now] drenched in the bliss

00:13:53.091 --> 00:13:57.467
of heavenly, peace and joy.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.883
That's why it is called as Kaivalya,

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:05.425
means only, only the blessings.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.342
See that means there is no other word to translate it.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.383
There's no other way of explaining it.

00:14:12.883 --> 00:14:17.091
It's a state. It's a Stithi.

00:14:17.342 --> 00:14:19.342
It's a state, in that state you have to rise

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.342
and you know that you are in that state.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.883
It's a very remarkable thing,

00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:30.342
that once you reach that state you don't have to ask for anything.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.050
It's all there, and you are so satisfied.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.467
I can go on talking about this special power

00:14:39.966 --> 00:14:44.425
but I think whatever I have said please meditate on that.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.467
And you are all capable of reaching that state.

00:14:48.966 --> 00:14:52.258
That state of complete peace and joy.

00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:57.883
May God bless you.
