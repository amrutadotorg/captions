00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:17.543
[Shri Mataji talks aside to a yogi and asks
him

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:22.719
if he has got the 108 Names of the Guru

00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:28.799
to read them during the puja]

00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:36.237
Alright. So today first we have Ganesh Puja
because Ganesha is innocence

00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:43.279
and we have to establish Him in any place
where we want to start

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.015
a work or do anything about it, because He
is innocence and innocence was created

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.884
before everything else was created.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:01:02.042
Is the most powerful power, I should say,
innocence.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:06.751
And then we’ll do the Guru Puja which is
actually

00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:12.011
the Adi Guru, the Primordial Master, who
incarnated on this Earth many a times.

00:01:12.212 --> 00:01:20.121
And, as you know, as Dattatreya He was born,

00:01:20.337 --> 00:01:27.026
as Janaka, Nanaka and many others.

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.551
That principle is within us and that is
very important

00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:38.047
that we should develop the principle
of Guru Nanak or Janak

00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:44.237
or anyone of these primordial masters.
Because if the Spirit is the master,

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:52.982
we have to become the master of ourselves.
And the power of the masters are

00:01:53.183 --> 00:02:05.451
that they are essences of the innocence –
of the creator,

00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:12.833
of the sustainer and the destroyer.

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:19.560
They are the innocence of all these. Out
of them – this great personality –

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:26.733
innocence of these three personalities
was created this great incarnation.

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:32.351
And their innocence is shown by their
detachment to things – they live everywhere

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:37.347
just like other human beings – married,
living in the families,

00:02:37.548 --> 00:02:44.328
but absolutely detached. Unless and until
this principle is awakened in you,

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:47.728
you cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:56.112
First of all, this principle of Guru must
be awakened in you which gives you balance

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.744
and then the ascent has to be brought in
through the Spirit, the Atma.

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:06.732
That is done by the Shakti, by
the Kundalini Herself.

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:11.854
She’s the Shakti, She’s the womb. She’s
the one Who nourishes, first of all.

00:03:12.055 --> 00:03:18.429
She nourishes that power within us,
nourishes us, nourishes all our chakras.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:26.957
By which She cures our mental, emotional,
physical, spiritual being.

00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:30.048
Because sometimes we bow to wrong type
of people,

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.374
our spiritual being is also very much hurt.

00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:37.138
And after that, after She has achieved
that,

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:46.730
then She ascends through your fontanel bone
and gives you the Self Realization.

00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:52.266
So it is She who is the giver of your
moksha.

00:03:52.778 --> 00:03:57.498
She is the one who is the giver of
the peace, of the joy,

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:03.071
and this Mother of yours resides in you
and She gives you the Realization.

00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:07.801
So we worship Her as the power within you,
so that you are empowered,

00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:16.407
you become powerful. But this power makes
you the master.

00:04:16.608 --> 00:04:20.808
When She comes in the Void area, She makes
you the Master

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:28.582
because She enlightens that Guru principle
within you and you become the Master,

00:04:28.783 --> 00:04:34.077
you become the master of yourself and by
that you become the Master of others also.

00:04:34.278 --> 00:04:38.894
The one who is not the Master of oneself
cannot be the Master of others.

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:43.908
So it works out, first of all, on you and
then it radiates.

00:04:44.109 --> 00:04:49.414
And that radiation makes others also accept
you as the guru.

00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:59.346
The dynamism and that compassionate
attitude

00:04:59.547 --> 00:05:05.788
all develops through this Guru principle.

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:11.430
But this is the blessing of the Kundalini,
the Womb, the Mother,

00:05:11.631 --> 00:05:14.711
the one who we call as Aquarius.

00:05:14.912 --> 00:05:21.390
This is residing within us and we have to
just accept

00:05:21.591 --> 00:05:27.600
Her manifestation and welcome Her with
open heart.

00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:34.367
And know that today is the day when we are
expecting human beings

00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:40.367
to rise to that level where they become
compassion, love, affection.

00:05:41.572 --> 00:05:47.267
This is the new awareness with which we are
going to be

00:05:47.468 --> 00:05:51.052
completely fulfilled and unless and until
that happens

00:05:51.253 --> 00:05:57.058
there’s no chance for the emancipation,
no doubt about it.

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:04.179
We have worked out so many things in so
many places

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.045
and every place, I find, has a different
problem.

00:06:09.553 --> 00:06:14.791
The most difficult, I find, is America,
it’s like Mathura

00:06:14.992 --> 00:06:18.084
where Shri Krishna had to go and establish
Himself,

00:06:18.285 --> 00:06:24.011
that was the Kingdom of Shri Krishna and
where Kamsa was ruling.

00:06:24.212 --> 00:06:29.755
So the people in Mathura were the most
difficult people because they were governed

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:35.087
by devils and the devils have a capacity
to dominate good people.

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:39.023
They’re all so dominated that even where
Shri Krishna lived,

00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:47.324
they tried to go and harm Him and kill Him
and all that.

00:06:47.525 --> 00:06:52.830
And all the dynamism of these people from
Mathura was killed by Kamsa

00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:58.558
who was to be killed by Shri Krishna.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.119
Surprisingly, the first day I came to New
York for the puja,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.504
the first day it was written “Parivartani
Ekadashi”.

00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:15.369
Now “Ekadesha” is the power with which
the people are going to be destroyed.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.521
Now that is “Parivartani” means the one
by which you are going to be transformed.

00:07:20.722 --> 00:07:25.101
So, how is it the power that is going
to destroy is going to transform you.

00:07:25.302 --> 00:07:31.703
Firstly, it will destroy all that is
oppressive, all that kills your dynamism,

00:07:31.904 --> 00:07:36.239
all that makes you slave, that is going
to be destroyed.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.634
Secondly, people will be frightened,
the halfbaked ones

00:07:39.835 --> 00:07:45.916
who are neither here nor there, that we’ll
be destroyed and that awe will change them.

00:07:46.117 --> 00:07:50.524
Thirdly, when you see that your kith and
kin are going to be destroyed,

00:07:50.725 --> 00:07:55.098
then you’ll have much more compassion,
much more tolerance for them

00:07:55.299 --> 00:07:59.609
and you’ll try to save them all. So that is
what it is,

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:06.050
where Shri Krishna had to raise a complete
mountain on His fingertip,

00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:11.179
you see like this, to the right side,
“Govardhandhari” He was called.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.765
That is what is my job here, is to raise
the mountain again

00:08:14.966 --> 00:08:21.054
and raise it on my finger tip like that.
But this finger has to be strong

00:08:21.255 --> 00:08:28.863
and this finger is nothing but the Sahaja
Yogis of America and they have to help

00:08:29.064 --> 00:08:36.962
by their dynamic behaviour and by their
proper understanding, responsibility

00:08:37.163 --> 00:08:43.870
as the people belonging to this great
nation of Fatherhood.

00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:49.610
This is the finger of the Father and that
Fatherhood has to be dynamic,

00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:58.268
has to be overpowering and has to be very
responsible.

00:08:58.469 --> 00:09:01.974
And in that responsibility you learn so
many things –

00:09:02.175 --> 00:09:05.627
so that’s my job is, that’s my goal is.
She (tv host) asked me in the TV,

00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:09.068
“What is your goal, Mother?” I didn’t tell
her that I have to raise

00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:12.420
the mountain on my finger, you see, she
would never have understood that.

00:09:12.621 --> 00:09:15.290
But that is what one has to do here.

00:09:15.491 --> 00:09:21.258
To raise the mountain and I find it’s like
that – Mountainous.

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:27.324
And base of the mountain seems to be Houston
which is the most difficult part of it,

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:33.917
they just don’t move, they just don’t move,
its jada it's very, very ‘tamasic’,

00:09:34.118 --> 00:09:39.351
it’s so full of ignorance and so full
of heaviness.

00:09:39.552 --> 00:09:43.619
That is the most difficult part and that’s
why – for Houston specially –

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.173
we should do a nice puja to the Kundalini
that She rises in Houston.

00:09:49.374 --> 00:09:52.063
May God bless you all.

00:09:56.695 --> 00:10:00.290
Can you give me the handkerchief.

00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:20.271
Yogi: Today it’s said it’s Anant
Chaturdashi. Shri Mataji: Uh?

00:10:20.472 --> 00:10:24.180
Yogi: Anant Chaturdashi.
Shri Mataji: Today? Ah-ah!

00:10:24.381 --> 00:10:28.267
That’s great! Yes, must be. I was wondering
Anant Chaturdashi.

00:10:28.468 --> 00:10:34.121
Anant Chaturdashi is the day when we

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:42.486
‘visarjan’– dissolve Shri Ganesha
in the water.

00:10:42.761 --> 00:10:46.355
(Hindi : it’s that day we put the Ganesha
in to the water)

00:10:46.556 --> 00:10:52.352
Because He’s established for ten days and
after ten days, He’s born on the fourth,

00:10:52.553 --> 00:10:58.305
after ten days He’s dissolved in the water
so that everywhere His Power is spread

00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:02.686
through the water. That’s why no wonder
there was a puja.

00:11:02.887 --> 00:11:06.435
Ganesha settled down into the water.

00:11:06.636 --> 00:11:10.754
That is Ananta Chaturdashi. Ananta is the,
is Shri Ganesha.

00:11:10.955 --> 00:11:15.605
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed.
Innocence cannot be destroyed.

00:11:15.806 --> 00:11:20.527
And that is why is the Ganesh Chaturdashi
means the day

00:11:20.728 --> 00:11:25.836
when Ganesha is dissolved in the water,

00:11:26.408 --> 00:11:34.891
in the ocean or He is created, worshipped
for ten days and again given back.

00:11:37.067 --> 00:11:42.850
So it’s a very great day today, I should
say, like the resurrection of Christ

00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:49.213
that you are,

00:11:51.485 --> 00:11:55.624
you had Christ here, He lived with you,

00:11:55.825 --> 00:12:00.393
and then went back to His Father. Father is
the ocean

00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:05.770
and that’s what in India they do, establish
Him on the fourth day

00:12:05.971 --> 00:12:09.405
and on the tenth day they put Him back
to the ocean.

00:12:09.606 --> 00:12:13.134
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in
our school. Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

00:12:13.335 --> 00:12:15.443
Yogi: I said we used to do the same
thing in our school. Shri Mataji: Eh?

00:12:15.644 --> 00:12:17.680
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in our
school.

00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:21.836
Other yogi: He says that he did the same in
his school, they used to make the Ganesha.

00:12:22.037 --> 00:12:27.218
Shri Mataji: Really? What school?
Yogi: (School name).

00:12:27.424 --> 00:12:33.056
Yogi: So we used to have a statue and four
of the guys used to carry them on.

00:12:33.257 --> 00:12:35.986
Shri Mataji: But no one understands. They
just do it without understanding

00:12:36.187 --> 00:12:40.020
what they are doing about it. So it’s
a thing, even in India

00:12:40.221 --> 00:12:42.546
how many people know about Ganesha,
no one knows.

00:12:42.747 --> 00:12:45.812
Yogini: In Maharastra. Shri Mataji: In
Maharastra, they worship Him a lot

00:12:46.013 --> 00:12:49.686
but they don’t know much about it. They
don’t know how much He’s important,

00:12:49.887 --> 00:12:53.802
about what He represents, how did He came
on this earth, nothing they know.

00:12:54.003 --> 00:12:58.337
We have become very superficial that way.

00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:06.241
But at least it keeps your attention by
doing all these things, “there”.

00:13:06.442 --> 00:13:10.631
You see, this is the advantage of in India,
the children have to be little bit

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:16.163
pinned down to a thing they, by festivals
and all that they try to then find out

00:13:16.364 --> 00:13:20.015
what is this, what is that. Their attention
is more there, not outside so much,

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.776
you see, that’s the thing is.
