1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,230
Today we have decided to have Mahakali Puja.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:14,750
Now we must understand the Mahakali is in totality

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,670
is a reflection of Adi Shakti in totality;

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,990
or we can call it that Adi Shakti is in charge,

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,230
She's managing all these three powers.

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,790
But Her manifestation in totality is Mahakali

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,990
in the sense that it is the desire of God Almighty.

8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,990
So first She's Adi Shakti in charge of all the three powers

9
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:56,630
and that's why we can say that when She is in a potential stage

10
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:04,590
She is Mahakali and then She divides Herself into two other forces

11
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,750
as Mahasaraswati

12
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:17,510
and the ascending force that we call,

13
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,910
or as a parasympathetic nervous system

14
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,950
expressed in us is the Mahalakshmi force.

15
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,910
So She has actually all these forces in Herself,

16
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,710
Mahakali has all these forces but She manifests,

17
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,350
She desires to act and when She wants to act

18
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,670
Her potential force becomes these two other forces.

19
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,230
So when we do the Puja of Mahakali, we must understand

20
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:55,630
that inbuilt within this force within us is desire;

21
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,870
so we can desire anything, if we want we can desire everything,

22
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:10,990
we can desire say the joy, we can desire the knowledge,

23
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,270
we can desire to be compassionate and love and we can desire also

24
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,750
the destruction of those which are negative forces.

25
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,750
But the Mahakali force is the one

26
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,230
which is working out the constructive force

27
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,430
but in that constructive force only there has to be destruction,

28
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,870
because if you are constructing something and there is destruction

29
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,070
which is trying to destroy your construction then you have to

30
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,990
destroy that destructive personality;

31
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,870
and this is what people sometimes misunderstand

32
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,510
and they think that Mahakali force is negative force

33
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:00,590
or is a force of destruction, it is, but in a very positive way

34
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,070
and if you understand this part of Mahakali force

35
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,910
then you will understand that if you have desires

36
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,350
to construct yourself properly in Sahaja Yoga

37
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,630
then you should also have the desire to destroy

38
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,150
whatever is standing against your construction.

39
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,030
So one by one we should see within ourselves what sort of things

40
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,870
that drag us down and thus they do not give us this desire.

41
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:42,430
If this desire becomes intense then you start immediately

42
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,870
seeing what are the forces that are destroying your ascent.

43
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:53,270
So we have to ascend is the point, our goal is to ascend,

44
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,910
our destination is to ascend; so our desire should be

45
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,550
that we should ascend and construct our being in such a manner

46
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,990
that we can receive all the...

47
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:21,550
so we should understand that we have to be prepared

48
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,150
to destroy many things within us,

49
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:33,070
if we have to become great evolved personalities

50
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,710
As you have seen in evolution itself you had huge big animals

51
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,270
like mammoth this that and they they could not cope with the evolution

52
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,390
so they were all destroyed, so many thing were destroyed,

53
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,950
and this destruction is built in within us,

54
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,310
when we ascend we just start seeing that these are the forces

55
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:06,910
which are destroying us and that our destruction is so much

56
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,230
that if we do not desire the destruction of these destructive forces

57
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,270
we'll be finished.

58
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,910
So at the same time, when we are ascending higher we have to know

59
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,710
what we have to destroy. For example even in living forces

60
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,230
when a flower becomes a fruit,

61
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:38,750
lots of things which were the part of the flower get destroyed,

62
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,510
automatically, but that is done in the will of God

63
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,830
by His own understanding. So it's absolutely perfect.

64
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,710
So in Sahaja Yoga when we desire something, we must know

65
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:03,430
what we desire, first fix your goal and then relate it to that.

66
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,190
Now there are many deviations in life, like you are going

67
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,990
to the airport, our attention should be we have to reach the airport

68
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,190
and whatever are distractions are distractions;

69
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,830
we should not get lost with it,

70
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,470
if you get lost with those distractions,

71
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,710
then we cannot achieve our goal in time.

72
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:29,830
So one has to understand first of all that our goal is to ascend

73
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:37,510
and for that the distractions are on our way, because of ourselves,

74
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,150
because of ignorance, because of darkness,

75
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,910
because the light is not so much.

76
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,670
The first destroying factor that is within us

77
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,390
is the Shri Ganesha's power

78
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,550
and this Shri Ganesha is the power of Mahakali.

79
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:03,430
She first planted Shri Ganesha to emit holiness on this Earth,

80
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,990
so the whole thing could be vibrated

81
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:12,070
and as you know one aspect of Shri Ganesha is also Omkara,

82
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,310
means this vibratory awareness which flows everywhere.

83
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,110
So these vibrations have four sides in it:

84
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:31,390
one is that these vibrations establish holiness,

85
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,950
auspiciousness through Mahakali power;

86
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:46,390
then these same vibrations also comfort us through Mahakali power.

87
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,070
Vibrations do not give you desires as such, if you see,

88
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,110
they do not give you desires,

89
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:02,070
but they give you proof of your desires being fulfilled.

90
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,190
Supposing you want somebody to be cured, this is your desire

91
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,430
and you give vibrations to that person; so it's a means,

92
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:22,190
so it is also the action part which is there in those vibrations,

93
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,150
but this action also comes from desire.

94
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,550
If you don't have desire you won't act,

95
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:38,430
so the desire is so important even to establish your own path,

96
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:43,350
to establish your forward march, if your desire is poor,

97
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,950
if you're half hearted you can't work it out.

98
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,070
Half hearted people cannot achieve anything in Sahaja Yoga,

99
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,350
it's not meant for half hearted people, it's meant for people

100
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:03,150
who are brave, who have intense desire,

101
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:10,430
who are intelligent and who are auspicious.

102
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:19,830
But in case you do not have intense desire,

103
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,750
then the pure desire doesn't work

104
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,510
and you do not get your realisation; also after getting realisation

105
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,870
unless and until you have desire to ascend,

106
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,150
very strong intense desire to ascend, you cannot ascend.

107
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,510
So for all Sahaja Yogis it is necessary to first of all

108
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,670
early in the morning, while taking the name of Ganesha,

109
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,270
must say what is my desire, this is my goal,

110
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:55,230
this is what it is, all activity must be surrendered for this work.

111
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:03,830
So now how our desires are curbed, first of all

112
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,270
through conditionings. We have certain conditionings.

113
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,710
After Sahaja Yoga people become very affectionate,

114
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,670
so immediately even if in the west - where the family is

115
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,910
not so important, children are not so important,
selfishness is there,

116
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:30,190
people think about themselves only, they cannot think of others -

117
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:37,590
even in those countries, it starts developing a kind of a,

118
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,430
another cocoon of myness, my child, my house, my home, my family;

119
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,470
then the attention starts working on that,

120
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,710
you become half hearted towards your ascent, because you're ascending

121
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:06,030
in a way so called and also you are spreading out.

122
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:16,710
Then the concern goes to other conditionings we have.

123
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,910
Like the other day I met one fellow he said that "Mother,

124
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:25,110
I'm a Sahaja Yogi, I know but I can't get over the idea of Christ",

125
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,470
I said "Who has asked you to get over idea of Christ?

126
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,550
Christ is there, in Sahaja Yoga very much,

127
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,310
but understand it in its own comprehensive way

128
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,910
and see for yourself!".

129
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:43,670
But this conditioning is of thoughts. Supposing if you have read

130
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,230
too many books, if you have gone through...

131
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,030
supposing you are a born Hindu or a born Christian

132
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,470
or born Jew or anything, so the conditioning is there.

133
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:01,150
You were born as a human being, you got this stamp later on

134
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,950
that you are a Hindu or a Christian or anything.

135
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,190
These stamps you did not carry when you were born.

136
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,550
Supposing the child was lost, he could be any religion,

137
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,790
so these are not really your innate religions,

138
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,710
this is just a stamp you have got, like Christian or anything.

139
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,510
Then you have another conditioning, that you belong to this nation,

140
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,950
that nation, like we have, we have America, this, that, that,

141
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,310
but still these are stamps. You were born in America,

142
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,870
that's why you are an American, anybody who is born in America

143
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,550
is not different from anybody else.

144
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,270
Only thing according to the climate of a particular place,

145
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,390
you might have your complexion, your height, your face and all that,

146
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,030
but that doesn't mean that innately this is meant for America,

147
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,190
it could be anywhere.

148
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,550
Then all these conditionings within us start acting on our language,

149
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,070
on our styles, on our lives in every way.

150
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,710
Then we start becoming Americans,

151
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,630
so these are the effects of the outside that come in us

152
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,150
and then we say we the Americans,

153
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:24,510
but if you scratch them inside body's the same, heart is the same,

154
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,150
the blood is the same, everything is the same,

155
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:34,270
there's nothing different, it's even not skin deep.

156
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,950
But in the brain it has gone that "I am an American".

157
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,910
Then all these things that are in that society,

158
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:50,030
for example in America so many things are allowed so that's alright,

159
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,390
in India many things are allowed, that's alright,

160
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,070
like that we start accepting the society, the norms of the society

161
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,310
and the conditioning starts.

162
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:10,790
But with all that, this desire is there, the pure desire to ascend.

163
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,110
I think you put these lights little ahead because they are so,

164
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,110
paper there and with my force, light is going behind,

165
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,790
no, no, not that one please, because they are facing that fan,

166
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:41,190
could bring them down here, still quite close to that fan you know,

167
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,510
you can put them anywhere, you can put them here if you want,

168
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,070
you see because my, the air is blowing that way and they are all going that way.

169
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,790
So the desire within us to ascend comes to us

170
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,470
also as a reaction to all these things,

171
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,510
when we see as Americans what's happening to our country,

172
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,510
what's happening to the people, what's happening to our surroundings

173
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,750
and then we get a shock. Oh God! What is this?

174
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,350
Then we also see this is artificiality, like in England

175
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,950
you have to wear a tail coat, you have to wear this,

176
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,470
you have to have this kind of spoon, this kind of a glass, this that

177
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,550
so reaction builds in; so you start anti-culture,

178
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,430
anti-culture to get rid of artificiality.

179
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,830
Well the desire behind it is, is to seek the reality.

180
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,510
To seek reality then they have hair just like primitive people,

181
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,750
they live like primitive people and the reaction is built in

182
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,790
behind all that is the same desire, is to ascend.

183
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,030
So this Mahalakshmi power is acting within us,

184
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:25,470
it is giving us all kinds of shows, we can say, alright you want to have,

185
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:30,750
say variety of things, go ahead with it, then you go crazy you see

186
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:36,270
what is this going on, why should we be so mad about it.

187
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:51,150
Now they want to have, a, you want to have say, your children,

188
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,630
your home, your houses; then you just get fed up with it, because

189
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,910
children become arrogant, they become horrid, they trouble you,

190
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,310
then you say, "Oh God! I'll never have any children any more!"

191
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,510
Then you have wives and you find wives horrible and husbands horrible,

192
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,950
then you divorce, you go on divorcing, divorcing, divorcing

193
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,070
and then you find it's useless, it doesn't work out,

194
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,990
nothing seems to work out, you feel so frustrated

195
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,990
and that action and reaction works on your desires.

196
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,790
So your desires go on changing,

197
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,550
especially when we are wanting to be affluent,

198
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:44,150
people become affluent and then they find the problems of affluence,

199
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,670
so a reaction is built in,

200
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,910
those who witness those problems of the rich,

201
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,350
they don't want to be that rich, nothing doing.

202
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:01,430
So in every way the desire to achieve things works out,

203
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,830
like some people want to have power, they go into politics,

204
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,430
fight it, get it done and done forever.

205
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,950
So lives after lives it goes on.

206
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,590
Then you are born in modern times when I am here

207
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:27,430
and now your only strong desire is to become The Spirit - I hope it is.

208
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:36,230
So now all these back things are to be crossed over,

209
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:42,110
they are finished, now what should we do for our realisation,

210
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,310
what action we should take?

211
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,510
The first action is to develop your Mahakali power,

212
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,310
by one power you destroy all that is nonsensical,

213
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:04,990
destroy all that is impeding you, troubling you, blocking you,

214
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,310
destroy all that, just I don't want it.

215
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,550
Because I have seen Sahaja Yogis suddenly go off,

216
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,550
like you have to go to the airport, suddenly you find

217
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:25,350
they have fallen into one of the gutters. "What happened?"

218
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,270
"Mother, we felt like going there", but why?

219
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,630
So keep your attention on that point.

220
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,230
Some people get married, in Sahaja Yoga also,

221
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,710
they have a desire to marry, have children, this thing,

222
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,670
but in that also they get fixed up. Marriage is not the end,

223
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,270
it's just one of the means to be balanced.

224
00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:02,030
So we have to have desire that we have to achieve something

225
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,470
so go on destroying all that is within us, within us is there are

226
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:16,070
six enemies as they say, is anger, then greed, jealousies, violence,

227
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:21,110
all these are within us, so have to destroy these six enemies.

228
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,470
But what's the power of a Mahakali is that she destroys

229
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,750
all the enemies that stand in your way,

230
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,590
all the rakshasas, all the devils all the negative forces,

231
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,630
she tries to destroy, so that your [path] should be all right;

232
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,510
but while She is destroying all of them

233
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,310
if you are sticking on to them, what can She do?

234
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:48,390
So your desire should be pure and that you should say that all right:

235
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,710
"We want to achieve that", and she is working it out for you.

236
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,470
This is the first thing, Her job.

237
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,350
Then the second job is that She comforts,

238
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,430
She gives you comforts, of every kind.

239
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,950
The first comfort She gives you is of your body,

240
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:15,110
your body becomes comfortable, means all your diseases and

241
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:21,030
all your troubles are destroyed. You find that your body becomes

242
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,390
healthy, you feel younger, you get energy

243
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,790
and you can work out your realisation.

244
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,750
This is the first thing She does for you: is to give you comfort.

245
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,630
Then she also gives you comfort of the Spirit,

246
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:45,750
so that you do not ask for artificial comforts,

247
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,910
you can live anywhere, you can live in a jungle, you are comfortable;

248
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:56,310
if you live in the most busiest place you are comfortable,

249
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,550
so you are comfortable everywhere and that sort of a comfort

250
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,230
she can establish within you.

251
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:13,670
Then the highest of all Her boon is that She gives you the joy,

252
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:23,030
joy of every kind, joy that emits from everything, from everyone.

253
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:28,510
So that is the highest you get when you keep your desire,

254
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:33,630
the flame of your desire burning, till you reach that state

255
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:43,230
of spiritual attainment, then you find that no more desire is left;

256
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:49,630
but only one, if it is any, that "let the whole world be realised".

257
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,670
Like a drunkard, you see, he wants to enjoy his drinking with others,

258
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,310
like that you become, you are drunk in your joy and

259
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,590
why not others enjoy, so you work for it.

260
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,550
But human beings, I have seen, they move like a yo-yo,

261
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,630
they achieve their spiritual attainment they have the joy

262
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,230
and then they go back to help people, they get caught up with them,

263
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:21,830
they are not strong enough; because the Mahakali power is not strong.

264
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,150
And another is the weakness of the Mooladhara.

265
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:34,510
Weakness of the Mooladhara makes you imbalanced

266
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,150
and in that imbalance you lose your will.

267
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,550
So one has to be very careful that our Mooladhara must be fixed properly.

268
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,150
There are so many ways by which you can fix up your Mooladhara

269
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,510
and you must fix up your Mooladhara first;

270
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:59,430
then your desire absolutely moves like a kite moves in the sky,

271
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,710
stuck to Mooladhara and you can move into any direction

272
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,030
to any height, wherever you go you are quite in charge,

273
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,150
you know how you are moving.

274
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,910
It can bind your attention, everything. So what we say that

275
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:23,310
the roots are very important first to be established

276
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,470
for the growth of your desire upward, like a tree.

277
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,750
So they go hand in hand, Mahakali power and Ganesha's power

278
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,870
go hand in hand because that's the foundation;

279
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:44,070
if it is based on that foundation, desires grow much stronger

280
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:49,790
and stronger and effective and they do not deviate.

281
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:57,470
Every sort of desire is fulfilled till you reach that state where

282
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,430
there's no other desire left but to enjoy, you just enjoy,

283
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,150
without any desire, desirelessly you enjoy.

284
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,630
And that state is to be enjoyed, just to be enjoyed.

285
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,630
What is there to talk about it? What is there to say about it?

286
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,550
You just are lost in the ocean of enjoyment

287
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:32,430
and that should happen everywhere and that's what you are worshipping.

288
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,110
So now I hope you have hundred and eight names of Mahakali,

289
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,430
and if you have the hundred and eight names of Mahakali

290
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:46,470
you will see one by one that her these stages are working out for you,

291
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:52,190
how manifest that you can see in those names.

292
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,710
So now first we'll have a one Atarva Sheersha

293
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,310
and then we can have these hundred and eight names.

294
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,750
