1
00:00:02,841 --> 00:00:06,515
Today, you are all celebrating my birthday.

2
00:00:08,714 --> 00:00:13,714
This is a matter of great satisfaction,

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,720
as in this time of Kaliyuga, who celebrates the birthday of mother?

4
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:23,677
This shows that though you all are

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,849
born in this Kaliyuga,

6
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:33,162
you don’t just know about your duty towards the mother,

7
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:36,638
but you also follow it.

8
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:42,152
At this age,

9
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:46,363
To celebrate birthdays means, a year is getting deducted every year.

10
00:00:47,956 --> 00:00:51,527
and there are so many tasks still to be done.

11
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:57,567
I can see many tasks,, which are incomplete

12
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:00,533
We will have to work hard and pay attention to them,

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,833
only then can they be completed.

14
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:12,857
Like I said yesterday, in Delhi,

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,503
we should pay attention to our culture.

16
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:23,518
We should sort out our cultural state also.

17
00:01:25,537 --> 00:01:29,378
and the third thing which is very important,

18
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:31,116
is that

19
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:35,366
towards our spiritual ascent, we

20
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:41,583
should pay not just the attention but as a

21
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:50,286
martyr who is ready to sacrifice his life for his cause,

22
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:55,794
same fervour we should have for the Sahaja Yoga.

23
00:01:57,443 --> 00:02:01,483
Until we have this sentiment within us,

24
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:04,641
Sahaja Yoga is going to be only for our benefit.

25
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:09,061
What are our benefts, what kind of happiness we got from this,

26
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:12,497
is what I keep hearing all the time.

27
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,852
Whatever we have benefited from it,

28
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,259
whatever good has happened,

29
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:29,096
is because of the only reason – that we have found your spirit.

30
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,702
But when the light has come in you, you have become the lamp,

31
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:38,429
then you can’t hide the lamp somewhere.

32
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,526
You should bring your lamp out.

33
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:48,455
And Sahaja yog, as I have said many times, is society-facing.

34
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,901
Facing towards the society- that is Sahaja Yoga.

35
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:56,926
The light that can’t be spread, is of no use.

36
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:00,182
So every Sahaj yogi should think,

37
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:07,245
"how and in which dimension or style have I spread Sahaja Yoga".

38
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:11,889
Firstly, a sort of speciality should enter your personality.

39
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,237
And on attaining this speciality, I have enlightened so many people.

40
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:26,335
Today, when you embark on any task, in any country,

41
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:30,440
the first question arises about the state of the people there.

42
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:34,836
What are their vices, what are their conditionings,

43
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:38,615
how much ego do they have? that is measured first.

44
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:42,766
Then the consideration comes if this work can be achieved or not.

45
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,305
The biggest problem is the human being.

46
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:48,543
Even if the number of people is huge,

47
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,592
if their state is not good, then no task can be  completed properly.

48
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:57,816
Sahaja Yoga has done this greatest task,

49
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,514
of transforming human beings, has changed humen so much.

50
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:05,850
it has brought forth their ascent.

51
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:11,365
Today, Sahaj yogis are honest, truthful, hard-working people.

52
00:04:11,763 --> 00:04:15,675
the kind of people which are very difficult to find in this country.

53
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:21,032
Very rare type of people, who do what they say,

54
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:25,496
They think what they know.

55
00:04:26,637 --> 00:04:29,518
Sahaj yoga has readied such rare type of people

56
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:34,954
In this respect, Sahaj yoga is a massive blessing on this country.

57
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:40,715
However, if you have these fine people,

58
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:44,612
like a talented artisan, who is without any work,

59
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,750
then this talent goes to waste.

60
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:53,534
So, every Sahaj yogi has to think about "how I can use my talent".

61
00:04:54,843 --> 00:05:01,907
But, he also first thinks of his physical troubles and comfort

62
00:05:06,117 --> 00:05:08,680
Or he thinks how I can-

63
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,037
I may have to spend money on this.

64
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:14,863
or the expenditure may increase, how to manage that?

65
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:20,957
In reality, you can not purchase joy, you can only experience it.

66
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:25,368
But, whatever we obtain,

67
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:31,566
or accept and adopt, get joy from it within us,

68
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:38,365
is different and Sahaj Yoga is different.

69
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:46,034
You get the joy here only by sharing it and there is no other way.

70
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:51,101
For that you may have to bear some troubles

71
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:53,471
face some problems,

72
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,921
but they don’t seem like troubles because your spirit gets satisfied.

73
00:05:58,136 --> 00:06:00,786
Bodily comforts don’t matter to you anymore.

74
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,291
You have to test yourself

75
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,244
that when you become the spirit,

76
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:10,411
when you share this light of the spirit with others,

77
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:13,173
then you go beyond bodily comforts.

78
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:18,525
You get so much joy of the spirit

79
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:21,530
that in that joy of spirit,

80
00:06:23,055 --> 00:06:25,372
you get immersed completely.

81
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:27,912
"Atmani atmana tushtah".

82
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:30,722
spirit gets satisfied only by the spirit

83
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:33,535
and does not require any other satisfaction.

84
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,103
He doesn’t look for anything else.

85
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,024
He gets so satisfied that He feels he’s drunk ambrosia.

86
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:45,909
After having ambrosia, there is no need to have anything else.

87
00:06:46,984 --> 00:06:48,745
when you get this state,

88
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:51,230
then you should know that you have become a Sahaj yogi,

89
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:53,341
else you are still incomplete.

90
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:57,573
Now You all know that I have become old

91
00:06:57,676 --> 00:07:01,534
and I have worked hard for 14 years tirelessly.

92
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:04,684
You can say my penance is now complete.

93
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:08,646
But, these last twelve years of hard work has been too much.

94
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:13,197
It seems the hard work will have to continue for another 12 years.

95
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:17,347
But, you have to see how much hard work you are putting in.

96
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:20,579
Your mind will find one excuse or the other

97
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:23,926
– that it can’t be done, I have my family,

98
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:28,964
my children, my house, my this, my that.

99
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:34,881
But, beyond all these things is the universe of joy.

100
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:38,740
If you want to achieve that, then you should know that

101
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:42,265
you have to fulfil the desire of your spirit.

102
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:45,880
Until you don’t fulfil the desires of your spirit,

103
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:48,528
all your desires will stay as they are

104
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,711
and all your tasks will stay as they are.

105
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,433
You can’t achieve anything,

106
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:55,663
especially welfare, unless your yoga is fully established.

107
00:07:55,846 --> 00:08:00,905
But, as soon as your yoga takes place and gets established,

108
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:04,319
you will notice that all your problems will be solved instantly.

109
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:06,980
your problems have been solved, right?

110
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,113
All of yours have!

111
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:14,302
Then you move forward and see whtever we think is a problem for us,

112
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:18,317
we think is very difficult for us,

113
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:23,496
instead you just think "we are involved in the work of Sahaj yoga,

114
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,367
and God is going to look after us,

115
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:28,507
then you will find that

116
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,840
all that you consider as problems will all disappear altogether.

117
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:38,826
I told you once before that the Kundalini,

118
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:47,855
remains beyond any cause and effect.

119
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:51,295
And, When you rise in your Kundalini, then

120
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:54,516
the cause gets omitted, as does the effect.

121
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:57,896
When the cause is not there, effect also is not there.

122
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:01,083
You have witnessed it.

123
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,940
Many of you know that these things happen all the time.

124
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:05,266
And it is happening.

125
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:09,385
We’ve got the things we never imagined,

126
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:11,206
we have achieved it.

127
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:15,500
we have got so much happiness, we have got everything in Sahaj yoga,

128
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:20,342
And even then if we are troubled about small-small things,

129
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:23,962
then it will become a difficult situation.

130
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:27,237
We should now think

131
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:33,182
that we have found so much happiness, comfort and security

132
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:34,571
and this Sahaj Yoga

133
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:38,079
when we give to others, they can also achieve these things.

134
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:42,325
But, when we give it to others, then we get more of it ourselves.

135
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:47,495
There are many thousand messengers of God, at work for us.

136
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:55,821
There are crores of hands, crores of their powers behind you all.

137
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:59,623
If one person stands up to do the work of Sahaj Yoga,

138
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,422
then you will not realise how things will happen,

139
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:04,334
how things will get arranged,

140
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:07,686
no one knows how things happen, but it will happen.

141
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:10,667
But, first, you have to prepare yourself.

142
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:15,802
because the deities which are inside you, know what you are?

143
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:19,056
whether you are truthful or fake

144
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:24,279
How high or low you are, they know everything.

145
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:30,759
And until they are sure that you are fully dedicated,

146
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:32,719
they will not help you.

147
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:40,729
Once they know that you haven’t come just for your selfish reasons,

148
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:45,253
but have come to do Sahaj yoga- which is society- facing-

149
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:47,639
you have come to spread it,

150
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:49,746
then you will be surprised that

151
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,040
that you will be showered with blessings from all four directions,

152
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:57,299
– like the whole atmosphere will become fragrant

153
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,118
and you will feel light

154
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:02,019
as if " I have no weight on my shoulders" everything is happening,

155
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:06,992
and everything gets organised by itself.

156
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,649
We have to come to that state.

157
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:16,408
Then you can see every person can do a lot of work and spread Sahaja.

158
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:22,938
I know that in Delhi, we still have to work a lot individually,

159
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:26,097
and then collectively.

160
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:28,007
It’s possible

161
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:32,103
for you all to talk to your neighbours and relatives about it.

162
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,427
You can call them all and tell them.

163
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:38,141
In India we have a very nice arrangement where we have our children,

164
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:41,029
our relatives, and acquaintances.

165
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:42,966
we can talk to all of them about it.

166
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:45,880
It is possible, among them Only a handful may believe in it.

167
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,642
But, when they will see how your state and realise the change in you,

168
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:53,122
then they will definitely make an effort.

169
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:54,479
At least some will.

170
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:58,630
In this manner, you can help spread Sahaj yoga.

171
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:03,019
Every person, whether it’s a woman or a man or a child,

172
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:06,678
every person when enlightened,

173
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:10,359
has a right to establish in Yoga,

174
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:14,447
but, it is their duty to give this light to others.

175
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:18,018
You have the power and everything

176
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,381
and if even then you didn’t give yoga to others,

177
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,730
then I can’t say how appropriate that would be.

178
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:34,113
In our Delhi centre,

179
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:39,357
many questions have arisen about which I would like to talk.

180
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:41,987
I will tell these people the problems we have

181
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,768
and how you can obtain

182
00:12:49,038 --> 00:12:50,664
the solutions to these questions.

183
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:52,117
It’s not a difficult task.

184
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:55,366
However, what we think from our mind

185
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,390
and any decisions we take based on our opinions,

186
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:03,505
still, until we

187
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:06,966
haven’t won over our Hamsa chakra and haven’t got the discretion,

188
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:09,579
until we develop descretion within us,

189
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:18,781
until we have the power to know what is right and wrong,

190
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:23,551
anything we know what is beneficial for Sahaj yoga,

191
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:28,543
until we develop the subtlity within us, to understand this,

192
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:32,378
until then you haven’t completely achieved Sahaj yoga.

193
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:35,379
How does that wisdom come?

194
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:36,506
Some ask, how do you get it?

195
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,871
How do you know you can ride a cycle? when you can actually ride it.

196
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:43,627
How do you drive a motor car? When you start driving it!

197
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:47,968
Similarly how does subtle intelligence come? Just when it comes!

198
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:52,963
How does it come? By being indifferent to it.

199
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,264
You start watching everything in a witness state, meditate,

200
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:02,372
and spend your time thinking about Sahaj yoga, then it will come.

201
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:06,606
But, how will it come, when will it happen?

202
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,130
It will happen when it does happen.

203
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:13,162
And if this hasn’t developed inside us yet,

204
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:15,687
then we should try to achieve it.

205
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:19,234
That’s why I said that now we should try really hard.

206
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,640
We should try really hard.

207
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,200
I had told them to invite only those people to the puja,

208
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:28,287
who have actually achieved something, and

209
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:36,665
(okay, wait, wait, now who ever has sent him, what do they understand? he is a child,)

210
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:39,687
Anyone capable of achieving something,

211
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:42,736
to give them is your paramount duty.

212
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,069
On every birthday, you make some or other new resolution.

213
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:56,381
Now, I understand that I should also make a new resolution.

214
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:02,384
And the new resolution is that

215
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:06,703
the Vishwa Dharma that We have made,

216
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:10,742
the universal religion that We have established,

217
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:12,793
and we all follow it,

218
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:17,199
if whoever doesn’t follow its ‘Maryada’ (boundaries),

219
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,692
such a person have no right to be called a Sahaj yogi.

220
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:23,366
This is what I thought that we should all resolve.

221
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:30,453
Anyone who follows its Maryada, only he/she can be its follower.

222
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,637
Any follower of Vishwa dharma, who doesn’t live by it,

223
00:15:34,962 --> 00:15:37,621
then we can’t accept him/her as a Sahaj yogi.

224
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,839
For example, if a person is Sahaja Yogi, and he takes dowry,

225
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,356
then he can’t be a Sahaj yogi.

226
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:48,382
Anyone believing in the caste system, can’t be a Sahaj yogi.

227
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,207
Any person believing in class system can not be a SahajaYogi.

228
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,582
So, Today I have decided that from today any person,

229
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:59,157
who calls himself a Sahaj yogi,

230
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:02,943
should have a complete understanding of Vishwa Dharma.

231
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:08,245
Not only this, but if it doesn’t reflect in their behaviour,

232
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:11,124
Supposing any sahaja Yogi behaves this way,

233
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:13,833
then he has no right to be in Sahaj Yoga.

234
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:16,992
He should be told that he should atone for his mistakes,

235
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:20,208
and correct himself as part of their atonement,

236
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,897
only then he can come to Sahaja Yoga.

237
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,763
There is no problem if people say only fewer people are left.

238
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:31,287
There is very less space left in God’s kingdom.

239
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,081
You don’t know.

240
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:37,005
How many people can you accommodate there?

241
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,273
Even hell doesn’t have enough space.

242
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:47,053
People will have to be kept somewhere in between only.

243
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,761
That’s why, half baked people,

244
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:57,401
who are good for nothing,

245
00:16:57,655 --> 00:16:59,996
shouldn’t come to Sahaj Yoga.

246
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:04,407
There is no need to trouble us.

247
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:09,424
People who come to Sahaj should follow it's protocol,

248
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,815
and instil them in their behaviour, practice them,

249
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:18,552
Tell your neighbours completely about it

250
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:22,079
and say that we believe in universal religion,

251
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:24,714
and not in any other religion.

252
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,491
If yogis don’t say that then we can’t accept them as yogis.

253
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:33,533
people who are scared to tell people in their society that

254
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:35,918
they are Yogis of Vishwa Dharma,

255
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:39,864
people who are afraid to tell that they are Sahaja Yogis,

256
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:43,631
Sahaja Yoga is not available for such people.

257
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:48,783
You will have to fully follow the protocols of Sahaj yoga.

258
00:17:49,353 --> 00:17:50,972
Like, many people are there

259
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:55,028
who tell that that ‘Mother, we sometimes drink a little alcohol,

260
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:58,819
smoke a little, consume tobacco also’,

261
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:01,315
Then you can not be a Sahaj yogi.

262
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:06,182
If a person doesn’t follow the Maryada of Sahaj yoga,

263
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,639
then he can not follow a universal religion.

264
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,971
And this Universal relegion of ours,

265
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,423
we must keep completely pure as it’s not just a universal religion,

266
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:17,623
but Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

267
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:20,630
I can’t allow any impurity to creep in,

268
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,678
That’s why anyone impure, can’t come into it.

269
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:30,991
Only those people who have fully accepted this universal religion

270
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,294
and follow the protocol can stay in it.

271
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,770
This is the resolution I have made for my birthday

272
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:42,195
and I hope you will accept it with love.

273
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:49,439
Now, about the specialities of this universal religion,

274
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:53,811
how should it be and what is its depth-

275
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:56,400
– all this, I will tell you on some other day.

276
00:18:56,766 --> 00:19:03,123
But, for now, you mustn’t do things that you roughly know to be wrong,

277
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:05,582
Things

278
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,208
even in the normal light,

279
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:17,666
if you can see that, is not Sahaj, that thing you cannot do.

280
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,617
And If you can’t get rid of these things, then you must spare Me.

281
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:24,772
I can’t fight you.

282
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,687
I have seen many people come just to get cured.

283
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:32,752
Then they will come with the second disease, then the third.

284
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:36,093
The reason is after being cured once, you should become Sahaj.

285
00:19:36,253 --> 00:19:39,847
If you don’t become Sahaj, and after that you become a-Sahaj,

286
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:41,980
then you become ill yet again.

287
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:43,949
Again you become sick.

288
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:47,736
Do I keep washing you like a washerman the whole life?

289
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,919
So, you should also keep yourself pure,

290
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:55,837
and should follow this religion like it’s our ornament,

291
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,202
this is our glory, our speciality,

292
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:03,043
This is why we are sitting in a high pedestal in the world.

293
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,748
Every part of our body should have this thought.

294
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:10,034
From each core of body the vibrations flow.

295
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:15,337
You should understand that God is so eager to decorate you with this,

296
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,441
But, how aware you are about it,

297
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:22,544
and how much you are ready for this, you should know.

298
00:20:24,753 --> 00:20:27,959
I tell you as much as I can.

299
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:30,477
Now, the yardstick is

300
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:34,048
that unless you follow the religion of Sahaj yoga,

301
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:38,798
you can’t enter Sahaja Yoga and you don’t have a right to pujas.

302
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:42,987
and you will have no right to anything else.

303
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:48,107
Whoever stays in the Maryada, only will have this right.

304
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,371
We might have only 4-5 people left, but doesn’t matter.

305
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:54,019
That will make things easier.

306
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,745
You should be very aware towards this,

307
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:05,060
make your life such that you all are together

308
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:09,584
and attain the meaning of your self, and be with one another.

309
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,423
And with that, you should become capable.

310
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:18,082
This is my blessing to you that you all should realise your powers

311
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:22,359
and then nourish the whole world with this power of love.

312
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:32,583
Since, today is my birthday, the puja will not be a long one.

313
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:34,397
A simple puja is going to happen,

314
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,487
first of all, with names of shri Ganesha My feet will be washed,

315
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,326
and with that nectar of the feet will be made. (charanamrit)

316
00:21:39,446 --> 00:21:42,525
After that My feet will be washed with water,

317
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:44,976
and that water will be theerth.(Holy water)

318
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:48,110
And after that I will prepare the charanamrit using My hands,

319
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,013
and at that time 108 names of Devi will be taken.

320
00:21:52,085 --> 00:21:55,044
That's it. There will not be much puja.

321
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,586
Does everybody has the 108 names?

322
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,467
Ganesha's name?

323
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:06,668
No, no. Devi's name.

324
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,303
Devi;s name. Distribute 108 names .

325
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:12,017
What?

326
00:22:12,303 --> 00:22:14,570
You have it but do others have it?

327
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:17,551
Does Everybody have it?

328
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:21,462
Have you got printed?

329
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:26,729
But now, they don't have that now, just now.

330
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:32,706
Okay now, among the 108 names,

331
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:34,706
He will tell you the first name,

332
00:22:34,905 --> 00:22:37,639
then you convert it intio mantra and say.

333
00:22:38,563 --> 00:22:42,293
Then you convert it into mantra and say.
