00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:14.455
So what demarcates today’s
celebration,

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:19.936
is the establishment of Shiva on this
earth.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:32.162
In the material self. Every matter has
been created with a deity

00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:37.862
and that deity is established in that
matter, as you know.

00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:47.801
So when it was thought by Adi Shakti

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:52.462
that first we must establish Shiva; without
Shiva you cannot establish anything.

00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:56.243
First He is to be established, because
He is the absolute.

00:00:56.444 --> 00:01:00.657
So you have to establish Shiva.

00:01:00.858 --> 00:01:05.833
And now what should we do?
How to establish Him?

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:11.351
He is the God of Tamo Guna.

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:20.002
He is the cold, He is the God of all
that is not active.

00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:31.878
So first of all, this earth, when it
receded from the sun, which was very hot,

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:39.442
was taken very near to the moon. The moon
is the brother-in-law of Shiva.

00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:48.864
So it was taken so close to moon that
the whole earth got covered with ice.

00:01:51.063 --> 00:01:55.583
And it was then gradually moved towards
the sun.

00:01:55.784 --> 00:02:04.554
When it was moved towards the sun,
gradually, then it started melting.

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:08.832
And the point that did not melt at all

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:12.782
was the point where Shiva was to be
established.

00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:21.167
That was predestined, that spot, and
that spot is the Kailash.

00:02:21.368 --> 00:02:26.457
The ice never melts there and if you see

00:02:26.658 --> 00:02:30.241
the whole mountain is like the face
of Shiva –

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:35.000
the eyes, the nose and everything you can
see clearly getting out –

00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:41.749
and all the year round, it keeps its shape
as it is.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.792
That is how Shiva was created.

00:02:46.993 --> 00:02:56.869
And He was placed in a witness state,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:05.609
as the spectator of all that happens
on this earth,

00:03:06.568 --> 00:03:08.936
facing towards the Kundalini of
the universe,

00:03:09.137 --> 00:03:13.739
which they were going to place in India.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.359
So He is facing towards the south.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.256
He is looking at the south with both
the hands like this,

00:03:25.962 --> 00:03:32.955
like a spectator watching the spectacle
of the Adi Kundalini.

00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:38.457
That is how Shiva was created.

00:03:38.658 --> 00:03:49.513
So, though we say that the heart
of the universe is England,

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:59.386
still Shiva resides on top of
the Sahasrara: this is the seat.

00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:06.467
Like you have got the seat of Shiva on top
of your head,

00:04:06.668 --> 00:04:14.818
but He resides in your heart, in the same
way Shiva belongs to this place

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:20.154
and He looks at the whole body from that,
this point -

00:04:20.355 --> 00:04:28.197
so the Feet are the south, this
(Sahasrara) is the north,

00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:36.166
this is the east, I'm sorry, west (right
arm), and this is the east (left arm).

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:43.476
That is how we can see the whole map of
the universe, of the world that is created.

00:06:31.877 --> 00:06:38.410
So now, when we understand

00:06:38.611 --> 00:06:42.632
that Shiva is the first thing that is
established in the matter,

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:47.680
then in us also first the Shiva is
established.

00:06:49.465 --> 00:06:53.399
When the foetus takes its form,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.618
the throb in the heart is the establishment
of Shiva.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:03.922
That is the sign that Shiva has been
established.

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:13.581
In case of people

00:07:15.128 --> 00:07:20.621
who are born with bad heart or with
troubles,

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:25.039
one has to say that Shiva is not fully
established.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.808
Not that they are bad people, but they are
not supposed to live for long,

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:33.669
and have to have another heart later on
maybe,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.560
or that there might be some sort of
a problem in their previous lives,

00:07:38.761 --> 00:07:45.255
and if they pay attention to Shiva tattwa,
their heart can be cured.

00:07:47.202 --> 00:07:51.297
So the most important organ in the body
is the heart.

00:07:51.507 --> 00:07:55.460
If the heart fails, you cannot remain
on this earth.

00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:58.488
So the most important thing is to look
after

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:05.065
your Shiva principle which is the Atma.

00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:10.114
We are worried about every sort of mundane
thing.

00:08:10.637 --> 00:08:14.588
Worried about this, worried about that,

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:21.370
but we are not worried about our Spirit.

00:08:22.455 --> 00:08:25.071
This is the biggest problem with us.

00:08:25.288 --> 00:08:30.515
If you worry about your Spirit, if you pay
attention to your Spirit,

00:08:30.716 --> 00:08:37.617
the whole universe then vibrates with
Parabrahma, which is nothing but joy.

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:46.519
So without, without any attention
to Spirit,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.646
if we think we can enjoy life, you cannot.

00:08:49.847 --> 00:08:53.828
You cannot enjoy your life if you pay
attention

00:08:54.029 --> 00:09:01.507
to other nonsensical things and you do not
pay attention to your Spirit.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:07.658
The complete silence comes into us only
through Spirit.

00:09:07.859 --> 00:09:13.238
If the Spirit is awakened within us, this
silence starts working

00:09:13.439 --> 00:09:20.296
and you feel extremely relaxed and
absolutely one with your Self.

00:09:20.497 --> 00:09:27.126
There is no problem, you don’t seek other
things that normally people seek -

00:09:27.327 --> 00:09:33.843
you seek your own company and you want
to be some time with yourself.

00:09:34.044 --> 00:09:38.522
Only thing that you seek after finding
your Spirit

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:44.727
is the company of other Sahaja Yogis who
also have found the Spirit,

00:09:44.928 --> 00:09:50.455
so there is a rapport established between
Spirits, that is in the heart.

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:55.711
And this Spirit is the universal being
within us, about which I have told you

00:09:55.912 --> 00:09:58.330
that once you become one with the Spirit,

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:02.310
you automatically become universally
conscious.
