08:18.784 --> 08:23.367
1987-0516 Shri Ganesha Puja, Auckland (New Zealand)

08:23.923 --> 08:31.447
I think it was, very nice that I could come to New Zealand.

08:34.018 --> 08:37.892
You should not feel depressed or unhappy,

08:38.013 --> 08:42.003
that the program started with a big bang and then it subsided

08:42.123 --> 08:46.378
then its coming up and all that. This is a common thing.

08:46.499 --> 08:50.687
Because it is a living process. In every living process,

08:50.808 --> 08:54.052
the thing starts with a very small thing.

08:54.172 --> 09:02.166
And then it grows, according to the weight, that one can, bear.

09:02.531 --> 09:07.998
You see the little tree, or when it was just a sampling,

09:08.118 --> 09:11.383
it had to fight a lot to come up.

09:11.503 --> 09:17.426
And when it came up, then also, it would not bear fruits.

09:17.546 --> 09:21.123
It would only bear two leaves, you see, to open out.

09:21.243 --> 09:26.500
Because the stock was not so powerful to hold the whole thing.

09:26.620 --> 09:30.395
So when your Sahaja Yogis will be more, and ready,

09:30.515 --> 09:33.262
then you’ll get more people and more people.

09:33.382 --> 09:37.012
But one should not expect too much of quantity.

09:37.132 --> 09:39.563
What we need is quality.

09:39.683 --> 09:44.623
If you try for quantity, then there would be a problem.

09:45.488 --> 09:49.250
Because quantity, the quality will go down.

09:49.370 --> 09:51.760
So in the beginning, when it is the foundation,

09:51.880 --> 09:55.188
it is very important to have good quality.

09:55.308 --> 09:57.295
As you see in a house,

09:57.415 --> 10:01.730
in the foundation we always put, very heavy stones,

10:01.850 --> 10:04.269
which can bear the whole structure.

10:04.389 --> 10:07.602
In the same way, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

10:07.722 --> 10:13.128
we have to put very solid people, to work it out.

10:13.248 --> 10:17.896
Unless and until they are of a very solid nature, they’re thrown out.

10:18.016 --> 10:20.914
That’s why Christ has said, first could be the last.

10:21.034 --> 10:23.887
Because so many people come for the first time,

10:24.007 --> 10:26.835
and may just get lost. Because they are no good.

10:26.955 --> 10:29.304
They have to bear the structure.

10:29.424 --> 10:31.929
They cannot be ordinary Sahaja Yogis.

10:32.049 --> 10:38.717
Now we have many qualities, to, to make it really,

10:38.837 --> 10:46.687
very very strong and also, to make it bearing.

10:46.807 --> 10:51.241
First of all, a Sahaja Yogi, which is on in the foundation

10:51.361 --> 10:56.444
doesn’t show off. He bears, he holds.

10:57.285 --> 11:02.332
He is the, actually the Adhara as they say, the support.

11:02.452 --> 11:05.654
The complete support of Sahaja Yoga in a country.

11:05.774 --> 11:08.412
So the first few, you come to the Sahaja Yoga,

11:08.532 --> 11:11.031
are very very important people.

11:11.151 --> 11:13.982
And an intensive work has to be done on them.

11:14.102 --> 11:17.395
And they have to work out also intensively.

11:17.515 --> 11:18.962
Because the first ones,

11:19.082 --> 11:23.078
if they are weak, the whole thing topples down.

11:23.355 --> 11:27.242
So by some mistake, you see, some weak persons may join you.

11:27.362 --> 11:29.336
Then the whole thing will topple down.

11:29.457 --> 11:32.734
Again you’ll have to raise it. It’s like another resurrection.

11:32.854 --> 11:36.197
Then again you have to see that you don’t have weak people there.

11:36.317 --> 11:38.689
Then you have to build them up in such a manner

11:38.809 --> 11:41.919
that they grow properly

11:42.039 --> 11:46.529
to the size that can bear the whole structure.

11:46.649 --> 11:48.567
Later on, of course, you’ll be surprised,

11:48.687 --> 11:52.629
the structure grows very fast. Like in Australia

11:52.749 --> 11:57.889
you know we started in a very, very, poor way, to begin with.

11:58.009 --> 12:01.491
And the people who really started are out of Sahaja Yoga.

12:01.611 --> 12:04.982
Absolutely out. And the rest of them,

12:05.102 --> 12:09.017
out of them also, those who were really solid people,

12:09.137 --> 12:14.266
could form the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

12:15.425 --> 12:18.839
So, one has to be careful, as to understand,

12:18.959 --> 12:23.103
that what we need now is quality, not the quantity.

12:23.223 --> 12:25.985
If you have too many people around your heads,

12:26.105 --> 12:28.329
you won’t be able to manage them at all.

12:28.449 --> 12:31.633
But if you have few good people you should be thankful.

12:31.753 --> 12:35.993
That’s why, if, there is no publicity that has come,

12:36.113 --> 12:40.763
or there are small number of people, you should be very satisfied.

12:40.883 --> 12:42.679
Not to feel sad about it,

12:42.799 --> 12:45.340
that see now, Sahaja Yoga is not spreading.

12:45.460 --> 12:48.341
It’s not the spreading that is important now.

12:48.461 --> 12:54.702
Is the deeper, embeddiment, that is important.

12:54.822 --> 12:58.584
And for that we need really solid people for Sahaja Yoga.

12:58.704 --> 13:02.237
So, you are the first, few people here,

13:02.357 --> 13:04.920
who are going to form the foundation,

13:05.040 --> 13:07.728
of New Zealand’s Sahaja Yoga.

13:07.848 --> 13:11.654
Maybe one day it might be a very very big structure.

13:11.774 --> 13:15.425
Doesn’t matter. Maybe your, you might be, taking a role

13:15.545 --> 13:18.921
of a foundation, which doesn’t show off.

13:19.501 --> 13:23.412
But your names will be written in golden letters,

13:23.761 --> 13:26.645
that such people started Sahaja Yoga.

13:26.765 --> 13:29.252
Because it’s a big struggle in the beginning to

13:29.372 --> 13:31.364
implement Sahaja Yoga.

13:31.975 --> 13:37.425
Now I have seen that people, who are false spread very fast.

13:37.545 --> 13:40.349
Very fast. You’ll hear their names everywhere,

13:40.469 --> 13:42.509
suddenly you see it’s all going everywhere.

13:42.629 --> 13:45.752
And you’ll be surprised that they are in the market already.

13:45.872 --> 13:49.526
The reason is, that, is not a living process.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.948
Is just Plastics.

13:52.068 --> 13:57.040
Plastic flower you can produce, in 1 day, thousands.

13:57.160 --> 14:00.830
But to produce 1 flower, on a tree,

14:01.330 --> 14:04.073
first flower is so difficult.

14:04.193 --> 14:07.887
Then few flowers, then the blossom time comes.

14:08.007 --> 14:11.485
Is not, that suddenly you get many flowers.

14:11.605 --> 14:15.274
So one has to understand that, in the beginning of anything,

14:15.394 --> 14:18.757
there are difficulties, and there are problems.

14:18.877 --> 14:20.407
Funny people will come in,

14:20.527 --> 14:22.757
they start doubting, they’ll go out.

14:22.877 --> 14:25.581
Then some more will come, they will get into it,

14:25.701 --> 14:27.955
they will do this, and they’ll get out.

14:28.075 --> 14:31.229
So there are two forces always working in Sahaja Yoga:

14:31.349 --> 14:34.511
one is the centripetal, another is centrifugal.

14:34.631 --> 14:37.809
By one force, people are attracted towards to Sahaja Yoga,

14:37.929 --> 14:39.563
because they know it’s the truth.

14:39.683 --> 14:42.182
And this is the end of their seeking.

14:42.302 --> 14:45.579
And this, they have to have. Because they, find out

14:45.699 --> 14:49.677
through their pure intelligence that this is the way.

14:49.797 --> 14:52.204
Now there are people who just try to test,

14:52.324 --> 14:54.621
like guru shopping you see. So they think:

14:54.741 --> 14:58.134
“let us go this shop is, they don’t charge you anything.

14:58.254 --> 14:59.257
Let’s get in here”.

14:59.377 --> 15:02.936
but they are the people, who just do not stick-on sometime.

15:03.056 --> 15:06.257
Or they have too many problems, from other gurus maybe.

15:06.377 --> 15:08.372
Or maybe they may stick-on.

15:08.492 --> 15:12.050
And some of them who stick-on, stick-on very well.

15:12.170 --> 15:16.363
So, we cannot say, what immediately will happen,

15:16.483 --> 15:19.548
in a living process you can’t say this tree,

15:19.668 --> 15:20.853
which side it will take?

15:20.973 --> 15:23.411
Whether it will go straight or on the sides

15:23.531 --> 15:25.153
or it will move the other way.

15:25.273 --> 15:27.431
So, it is, you cannot say that way.

15:27.551 --> 15:33.190
But we can say one thing, that, at least from my experience,

15:33.310 --> 15:36.895
I feel that in the beginning, whatever starts in a small way,

15:37.015 --> 15:40.667
in a struggling way, really is embedding itself nicely,

15:40.787 --> 15:42.580
into the Mother Earth.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.266
And is a very good sign.

15:44.386 --> 15:47.842
Because that’s the way, it always works out better.

15:47.962 --> 15:50.861
Whatever is frivolous, or whatever is cheapish,

15:50.981 --> 15:55.983
or which spreads out without much difficulties, is of no use.

15:56.103 --> 16:00.188
It’s like grass. Anybody can take it away.

16:00.308 --> 16:03.302
So the embeddiment and all that, has to go inside.

16:03.422 --> 16:06.052
As you are shaking it nicely to go inside.

16:06.172 --> 16:09.492
And that’s what it is. Where, you should be very happy,

16:09.612 --> 16:11.207
that it is working out that way.

16:11.327 --> 16:17.459
Somebody has come? Let him come. Come along.

16:24.864 --> 16:31.776
So the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, may look to be little shaky.

16:31.896 --> 16:35.277
May look to be little feeble. But it is not.

16:35.397 --> 16:38.529
It is getting stronger and stronger.

16:38.649 --> 16:42.580
And it is getting embedded into the Mother Earth.

16:42.700 --> 16:47.706
And, that is what, is the test of you being the real seekers.

16:47.826 --> 16:51.400
You being the people who want truth.

16:51.520 --> 16:55.458
Who do not want a big show, big,

16:55.578 --> 16:59.161
sort of a, community sitting there,

16:59.281 --> 17:04.771
all going mad with some sort of a shouting, screaming and nonsense.

17:04.891 --> 17:08.681
As it is you know, Sahaja Yoga, is a living process.

17:08.801 --> 17:12.080
And, it goes both, grows both, both ways.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.631
Upwards and downwards.

17:14.751 --> 17:17.301
In the beginning it grows more downwards,

17:17.421 --> 17:20.453
and in the downwards process, we have to depend,

17:20.587 --> 17:24.705
on our vibrations very much. We must all the time remember,

17:24.825 --> 17:29.376
that we are realized souls. That we have got vibrations.

17:29.496 --> 17:31.524
This is the way we have to judge.

17:31.644 --> 17:33.794
This is the way we have to understand.

17:33.914 --> 17:38.291
The vibration is the only way, that we’ll know others.

17:38.411 --> 17:42.358
Not by something, something you will feel

17:42.478 --> 17:45.422
that the person looks very sweet and nice and,

17:45.542 --> 17:47.768
may a snake come out of that person.

17:47.888 --> 17:51.671
So best is, to judge a person, through vibrations.

17:51.791 --> 17:53.953
Judge everything through vibrations.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.620
Not through your own understanding,

17:56.740 --> 18:00.584
or superficial methods of judging others.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.786
Now, there are also so many conditionings we have got,

18:03.906 --> 18:08.463
by which we judge others. And these conditionings, can also,

18:08.583 --> 18:13.347
bias our judgment. So best way is to see the vibrations.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.428
Through vibrations, you will have the real knowledge

18:16.548 --> 18:18.388
about what is happening.

18:18.508 --> 18:22.864
Now many people, in the beginning, also start misguiding.

18:22.984 --> 18:25.938
So best is to develop your vibrations.

18:26.058 --> 18:28.550
For that you have to grow inward first of all.

18:28.670 --> 18:33.345
If you grow inward, deeply, then what will happen,

18:33.465 --> 18:38.878
that outward growth will be very solid, and would be exact.

18:38.998 --> 18:41.059
You won’t have any problems with that.

18:41.179 --> 18:42.932
But if you do not grow inward,

18:43.052 --> 18:45.998
if you do not meditate and pay attention to it,

18:46.118 --> 18:51.423
and, I would say, it is more the dedication that you have,

18:51.543 --> 18:56.334
that works out so well that you grow upwards so well.

18:56.454 --> 18:59.914
I mean you can give a speech whenever you want about Sahaja Yoga,

19:00.034 --> 19:02.700
you can give realization to people whenever you want,

19:02.820 --> 19:05.036
you can cure people whenever you want.

19:05.156 --> 19:07.561
But first, there should be a depth in you.

19:07.681 --> 19:09.365
If that you have not achieved,

19:09.485 --> 19:11.920
you just start superficially doing something.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.556
Then maybe you are hit, or maybe you are in trouble,

19:15.676 --> 19:20.787
or maybe you may start doubting yourself, maybe Sahaja Yoga too.

19:20.907 --> 19:24.994
So the first thing is for us to grow deeply.

19:25.114 --> 19:28.941
And while we are growing deeply, we have to also grow

19:29.061 --> 19:34.177
in such a manner that we understand our vibrations clearly.

19:34.297 --> 19:38.663
Now see a root, of a little plant,

19:38.783 --> 19:43.424
has a got a very small little cell at the base of it.

19:43.544 --> 19:46.577
And the plant, doesn’t know anything,

19:46.697 --> 19:49.172
as much as that little cell knows.

19:49.292 --> 19:54.662
Because it is going inside, by its own intelligence,

19:54.782 --> 19:56.305
its own vibrations.

19:56.425 --> 19:59.106
Now if it finds a stone, it doesn’t go and quarrel.

19:59.226 --> 20:02.330
So don’t fight with the people who are stonies.

20:02.450 --> 20:03.942
Just don’t argue with them.

20:04.062 --> 20:06.895
You cannot make them understand. It’s not possible.

20:07.015 --> 20:10.155
They have to be seekers and soft,

20:10.275 --> 20:13.071
like the soft clay you can say,

20:13.191 --> 20:19.553
through which this little cell goes, penetrates.

20:19.673 --> 20:23.407
Then it finds, supposing, it finds a big stone.

20:23.803 --> 20:26.015
Then what, it goes round and round and round.

20:26.135 --> 20:29.435
So gives it a bandhan nicely! And goes down.

20:29.555 --> 20:32.906
Later on when it becomes a tree, he uses the stone

20:33.026 --> 20:36.967
for its, you see, for its support.

20:37.087 --> 20:38.134
So in the same way,

20:38.255 --> 20:41.276
you can go round and round and round somebody like that.

20:41.396 --> 20:44.188
But, giving just bandhan without saying anything.

20:44.308 --> 20:47.462
In your heart. Not saying, arguing with him anything.

20:47.582 --> 20:50.485
Because you’ll break your head but he will never be alright.

20:50.605 --> 20:52.777
So best is not to argue with him.

20:52.897 --> 20:54.884
But just give him bandhan in your heart

20:55.004 --> 20:58.003
and somehow or another bind it. So that later on,

20:58.123 --> 21:00.478
you see, he will become Sahaja Yogi,

21:00.598 --> 21:02.153
but will be a big support to us.

21:02.273 --> 21:04.861
Because it’s just a stone you see. Just now,

21:04.981 --> 21:08.857
use soft people, people who are easy people,

21:08.977 --> 21:14.086
people who are seekers, who are not so complicated.

21:14.967 --> 21:17.006
And, you cannot argue it out.

21:17.126 --> 21:20.093
Sahaja Yoga cannot be argued out, cannot be explained to.

21:20.213 --> 21:23.157
Only thing you have to get it. And if they don’t get it,

21:23.277 --> 21:25.974
you cannot argue it out: “Oh this is this, this is this”.

21:26.094 --> 21:28.466
Like, one reporter was asking me:

21:28.586 --> 21:30.887
“why is it I’m not getting realization?”.

21:31.007 --> 21:33.466
I couldn’t tell him that he was such an egoist.

21:33.586 --> 21:36.684
I couldn’t tell him that so I said: “maybe this, maybe that”.

21:36.804 --> 21:38.727
you see, I was avoiding the topic!

21:38.847 --> 21:40.628
No use telling him you are a big egoist.

21:40.748 --> 21:43.819
How can you get your realization? Because if I tell him like that,

21:43.939 --> 21:47.676
then he would be, just off! Absolutely. And he would be against

21:47.796 --> 21:49.339
Sahaja Yoga completely.

21:49.459 --> 21:53.589
So we have to use also, tactfully, a method by which

21:53.709 --> 21:57.649
we do not hurt others. But try to be nice and gentle,

21:57.769 --> 22:00.009
so they like at least your outer appearance

22:00.129 --> 22:04.911
that they are very gentle people, they
are very good people and all that.

22:05.165 --> 22:08.854
Now, in Sahaja Yoga also there is a temptation you might have.

22:08.974 --> 22:11.427
Because you suddenly get lot of money sometimes,

22:11.547 --> 22:13.398
suddenly get a big position.

22:13.518 --> 22:22.444
Suddenly, also you might get a very, rare, dynamic gifts.

22:22.564 --> 22:26.379
Like you can become great artist, you can become a great poet,

22:26.499 --> 22:29.761
you might be, something might happen to you suddenly.

22:29.881 --> 22:34.204
You get a public speaking gifts or anything like that.

22:34.324 --> 22:37.882
But these are all temptations, and one should not fall into it.

22:38.002 --> 22:40.997
Of course you must use them for Sahaja Yoga, is alright.

22:41.117 --> 22:42.738
But you should not fall into it

22:42.858 --> 22:45.369
and start thinking I’m something great. You see.

22:45.489 --> 22:50.270
If that is done, then there is a big problem because,

22:51.119 --> 22:56.369
such a thing gets a person completely out of Sahaja Yoga

22:56.489 --> 22:59.143
and he gets also punished, in a way.

22:59.263 --> 23:01.185
Maybe he loses his powers.

23:01.305 --> 23:06.603
So it’s best is, to keep to your Sahaja Yoga meditation.

23:06.723 --> 23:09.103
Keep to your own understanding.

23:09.223 --> 23:11.568
Know yourself, that is the best way.

23:11.688 --> 23:16.383
And not to be diverted by all these temptations.

23:16.503 --> 23:19.029
But the same can be used for Sahaja Yoga.

23:19.149 --> 23:22.429
If that is used for Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing wrong.

23:22.549 --> 23:26.712
Because these gifts are given to you, not to tempt you but,

23:26.832 --> 23:29.340
for using for Sahaja Yoga.

23:29.460 --> 23:34.117
For example, she got my photograph with the light on my head.

23:34.237 --> 23:42.000
That means there is something happen, between her and the light.

23:42.120 --> 23:45.462
Because how did I get that light upon my head is a problem.

23:45.582 --> 23:50.022
To be understood, very simply, that the Vishnumaya is the,

23:50.878 --> 23:54.954
is the, Goddess for light. For electricity.

23:55.493 --> 23:59.245
And if She wants, She can turn it into any angle

23:59.365 --> 24:03.448
and can put a subtle meaning to her photograph.

24:03.568 --> 24:06.072
Now people have taken photographs of the clouds

24:06.192 --> 24:08.501
and they found me there, absolutely there.

24:08.621 --> 24:11.187
People believe it or not but it is so.

24:11.307 --> 24:13.515
Two photographs they saw like that.

24:13.635 --> 24:16.687
And normally we don’t take photographs of the clouds.

24:16.807 --> 24:18.810
But it showed in such a way that,

24:18.930 --> 24:25.275
they first saw a very, luminous, cluster of a cloud.

24:25.395 --> 24:29.265
And then it expanded and started looking like a Ganesha.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.385
So, their attention was attracted.

24:31.505 --> 24:38.018
Then, strings of lights started flowing from both the sides.

24:38.138 --> 24:40.181
And they found two clusters.

24:40.301 --> 24:42.467
So they took photos of these two clusters

24:42.588 --> 24:45.298
and when they developed it, they found my photographs,

24:45.418 --> 24:47.393
two photographs of mine were there.

24:47.513 --> 24:50.974
One was with, even with the nose thing, when I was wearing it,

24:51.094 --> 24:52.360
means very latest ones!

24:52.480 --> 24:58.327
And another one where I look more like a, Red Indian face.

24:58.447 --> 25:01.132
That kind, coming out of the thing. It’s clearly,

25:01.252 --> 25:04.176
very clearly you can see. So that’s how they have taken it.

25:04.296 --> 25:08.322
It’s in the Bible, that you will know the Holy Ghost,

25:08.442 --> 25:14.124
with the forms of the clouds. Its written down.

25:14.244 --> 25:16.109
So this is how it is verified.

25:16.230 --> 25:18.835
But how many people are going to believe it? Very few.

25:18.955 --> 25:21.955
Very few people are going to believe that this is natural.

25:22.075 --> 25:25.078
They’ll think “oh, it’s all made up and done up and all that”.

25:25.198 --> 25:29.051
Because even if the nose ring is showing, is too much.

25:29.171 --> 25:31.083
Now this Vishnumaya works that way.

25:31.203 --> 25:34.325
There are so many other Deities who work out something

25:34.445 --> 25:36.908
in a different way. But whatever it is,

25:37.028 --> 25:39.705
they are all for your construction.

25:39.825 --> 25:43.908
For your building up as a good Sahaja Yogi.

25:44.028 --> 25:47.882
So the inner movement is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

25:48.002 --> 25:51.386
I’m very happy to know that you people are gathering here,

25:51.506 --> 25:54.617
for meditation and you’re listening to my tapes

25:54.737 --> 25:58.036
and are growing up well, and I was very happy to see

25:58.156 --> 26:01.832
the way you are growing. And keep your steady growth.

26:01.952 --> 26:04.723
Then you’ll become great Sahaja Yogis.

26:04.843 --> 26:09.885
I’m sure one day, New Zealand or Australia,

26:10.005 --> 26:16.450
may become the leader, of all the world to, follow, spirituality.

26:16.570 --> 26:20.582
Because, India is, of course, I must say India is spiritually

26:20.702 --> 26:23.735
very developed but, they are not leaders I think.

26:23.855 --> 26:27.565
So far, I have not seen much leaders coming out of India.

26:27.685 --> 26:30.424
But, once the leaders start coming out of India,

26:30.544 --> 26:32.952
we can say the, then the second position

26:33.072 --> 26:36.756
should be given to Australia and New Zealand.

26:36.876 --> 26:40.759
There will be great people coming out of Australia and New Zealand.

26:40.879 --> 26:47.848
No doubt about it. Because the, the root part maybe in India.

26:47.968 --> 26:50.748
The foundation part maybe from India,

26:50.868 --> 26:53.926
but the tree part, will be from the west.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.875
And that is how the east and west

26:55.995 --> 26:59.400
is going to complete the tree of Sahaja Yoga,

26:59.520 --> 27:02.229
blossoming and giving fruits.

27:02.349 --> 27:04.182
May God bless you all.
