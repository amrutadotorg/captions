00:08:18.784 --> 00:08:23.367
1987-0516 Shri Ganesha Puja, Auckland (New Zealand)

00:08:23.923 --> 00:08:31.447
I think it was, very nice that I could come to New Zealand.

00:08:34.018 --> 00:08:37.892
You should not feel depressed or unhappy,

00:08:38.013 --> 00:08:42.003
that the program started with a big bang and then it subsided

00:08:42.123 --> 00:08:46.378
then its coming up and all that. This is a common thing.

00:08:46.499 --> 00:08:50.687
Because it is a living process. In every living process,

00:08:50.808 --> 00:08:54.052
the thing starts with a very small thing.

00:08:54.172 --> 00:09:02.166
And then it grows, according to the weight, that one can, bear.

00:09:02.531 --> 00:09:07.998
You see the little tree, or when it was just a sampling,

00:09:08.118 --> 00:09:11.383
it had to fight a lot to come up.

00:09:11.503 --> 00:09:17.426
And when it came up, then also, it would not bear fruits.

00:09:17.546 --> 00:09:21.123
It would only bear two leaves, you see, to open out.

00:09:21.243 --> 00:09:26.500
Because the stock was not so powerful to hold the whole thing.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.395
So when your Sahaja Yogis will be more, and ready,

00:09:30.515 --> 00:09:33.262
then you’ll get more people and more people.

00:09:33.382 --> 00:09:37.012
But one should not expect too much of quantity.

00:09:37.132 --> 00:09:39.563
What we need is quality.

00:09:39.683 --> 00:09:44.623
If you try for quantity, then there would be a problem.

00:09:45.488 --> 00:09:49.250
Because quantity, the quality will go down.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.760
So in the beginning, when it is the foundation,

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.188
it is very important to have good quality.

00:09:55.308 --> 00:09:57.295
As you see in a house,

00:09:57.415 --> 00:10:01.730
in the foundation we always put, very heavy stones,

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.269
which can bear the whole structure.

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:07.602
In the same way, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:07.722 --> 00:10:13.128
we have to put very solid people, to work it out.

00:10:13.248 --> 00:10:17.896
Unless and until they are of a very solid nature, they’re thrown out.

00:10:18.016 --> 00:10:20.914
That’s why Christ has said, first could be the last.

00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:23.887
Because so many people come for the first time,

00:10:24.007 --> 00:10:26.835
and may just get lost. Because they are no good.

00:10:26.955 --> 00:10:29.304
They have to bear the structure.

00:10:29.424 --> 00:10:31.929
They cannot be ordinary Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:32.049 --> 00:10:38.717
Now we have many qualities, to, to make it really,

00:10:38.837 --> 00:10:46.687
very very strong and also, to make it bearing.

00:10:46.807 --> 00:10:51.241
First of all, a Sahaja Yogi, which is on in the foundation

00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:56.444
doesn’t show off. He bears, he holds.

00:10:57.285 --> 00:11:02.332
He is the, actually the Adhara as they say, the support.

00:11:02.452 --> 00:11:05.654
The complete support of Sahaja Yoga in a country.

00:11:05.774 --> 00:11:08.412
So the first few, you come to the Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:08.532 --> 00:11:11.031
are very very important people.

00:11:11.151 --> 00:11:13.982
And an intensive work has to be done on them.

00:11:14.102 --> 00:11:17.395
And they have to work out also intensively.

00:11:17.515 --> 00:11:18.962
Because the first ones,

00:11:19.082 --> 00:11:23.078
if they are weak, the whole thing topples down.

00:11:23.355 --> 00:11:27.242
So by some mistake, you see, some weak persons may join you.

00:11:27.362 --> 00:11:29.336
Then the whole thing will topple down.

00:11:29.457 --> 00:11:32.734
Again you’ll have to raise it. It’s like another resurrection.

00:11:32.854 --> 00:11:36.197
Then again you have to see that you don’t have weak people there.

00:11:36.317 --> 00:11:38.689
Then you have to build them up in such a manner

00:11:38.809 --> 00:11:41.919
that they grow properly

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:46.529
to the size that can bear the whole structure.

00:11:46.649 --> 00:11:48.567
Later on, of course, you’ll be surprised,

00:11:48.687 --> 00:11:52.629
the structure grows very fast. Like in Australia

00:11:52.749 --> 00:11:57.889
you know we started in a very, very, poor way, to begin with.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:01.491
And the people who really started are out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:01.611 --> 00:12:04.982
Absolutely out. And the rest of them,

00:12:05.102 --> 00:12:09.017
out of them also, those who were really solid people,

00:12:09.137 --> 00:12:14.266
could form the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:15.425 --> 00:12:18.839
So, one has to be careful, as to understand,

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:23.103
that what we need now is quality, not the quantity.

00:12:23.223 --> 00:12:25.985
If you have too many people around your heads,

00:12:26.105 --> 00:12:28.329
you won’t be able to manage them at all.

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:31.633
But if you have few good people you should be thankful.

00:12:31.753 --> 00:12:35.993
That’s why, if, there is no publicity that has come,

00:12:36.113 --> 00:12:40.763
or there are small number of people, you should be very satisfied.

00:12:40.883 --> 00:12:42.679
Not to feel sad about it,

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:45.340
that see now, Sahaja Yoga is not spreading.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.341
It’s not the spreading that is important now.

00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:54.702
Is the deeper, embeddiment, that is important.

00:12:54.822 --> 00:12:58.584
And for that we need really solid people for Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:58.704 --> 00:13:02.237
So, you are the first, few people here,

00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:04.920
who are going to form the foundation,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.728
of New Zealand’s Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:07.848 --> 00:13:11.654
Maybe one day it might be a very very big structure.

00:13:11.774 --> 00:13:15.425
Doesn’t matter. Maybe your, you might be, taking a role

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:18.921
of a foundation, which doesn’t show off.

00:13:19.501 --> 00:13:23.412
But your names will be written in golden letters,

00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:26.645
that such people started Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:29.252
Because it’s a big struggle in the beginning to

00:13:29.372 --> 00:13:31.364
implement Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:31.975 --> 00:13:37.425
Now I have seen that people, who are false spread very fast.

00:13:37.545 --> 00:13:40.349
Very fast. You’ll hear their names everywhere,

00:13:40.469 --> 00:13:42.509
suddenly you see it’s all going everywhere.

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:45.752
And you’ll be surprised that they are in the market already.

00:13:45.872 --> 00:13:49.526
The reason is, that, is not a living process.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.948
Is just Plastics.

00:13:52.068 --> 00:13:57.040
Plastic flower you can produce, in 1 day, thousands.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.830
But to produce 1 flower, on a tree,

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.073
first flower is so difficult.

00:14:04.193 --> 00:14:07.887
Then few flowers, then the blossom time comes.

00:14:08.007 --> 00:14:11.485
Is not, that suddenly you get many flowers.

00:14:11.605 --> 00:14:15.274
So one has to understand that, in the beginning of anything,

00:14:15.394 --> 00:14:18.757
there are difficulties, and there are problems.

00:14:18.877 --> 00:14:20.407
Funny people will come in,

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.757
they start doubting, they’ll go out.

00:14:22.877 --> 00:14:25.581
Then some more will come, they will get into it,

00:14:25.701 --> 00:14:27.955
they will do this, and they’ll get out.

00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:31.229
So there are two forces always working in Sahaja Yoga:

00:14:31.349 --> 00:14:34.511
one is the centripetal, another is centrifugal.

00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:37.809
By one force, people are attracted towards to Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:37.929 --> 00:14:39.563
because they know it’s the truth.

00:14:39.683 --> 00:14:42.182
And this is the end of their seeking.

00:14:42.302 --> 00:14:45.579
And this, they have to have. Because they, find out

00:14:45.699 --> 00:14:49.677
through their pure intelligence that this is the way.

00:14:49.797 --> 00:14:52.204
Now there are people who just try to test,

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:54.621
like guru shopping you see. So they think:

00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:58.134
“let us go this shop is, they don’t charge you anything.

00:14:58.254 --> 00:14:59.257
Let’s get in here”.

00:14:59.377 --> 00:15:02.936
but they are the people, who just do not stick-on sometime.

00:15:03.056 --> 00:15:06.257
Or they have too many problems, from other gurus maybe.

00:15:06.377 --> 00:15:08.372
Or maybe they may stick-on.

00:15:08.492 --> 00:15:12.050
And some of them who stick-on, stick-on very well.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:16.363
So, we cannot say, what immediately will happen,

00:15:16.483 --> 00:15:19.548
in a living process you can’t say this tree,

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:20.853
which side it will take?

00:15:20.973 --> 00:15:23.411
Whether it will go straight or on the sides

00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:25.153
or it will move the other way.

00:15:25.273 --> 00:15:27.431
So, it is, you cannot say that way.

00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:33.190
But we can say one thing, that, at least from my experience,

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:36.895
I feel that in the beginning, whatever starts in a small way,

00:15:37.015 --> 00:15:40.667
in a struggling way, really is embedding itself nicely,

00:15:40.787 --> 00:15:42.580
into the Mother Earth.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.266
And is a very good sign.

00:15:44.386 --> 00:15:47.842
Because that’s the way, it always works out better.

00:15:47.962 --> 00:15:50.861
Whatever is frivolous, or whatever is cheapish,

00:15:50.981 --> 00:15:55.983
or which spreads out without much difficulties, is of no use.

00:15:56.103 --> 00:16:00.188
It’s like grass. Anybody can take it away.

00:16:00.308 --> 00:16:03.302
So the embeddiment and all that, has to go inside.

00:16:03.422 --> 00:16:06.052
As you are shaking it nicely to go inside.

00:16:06.172 --> 00:16:09.492
And that’s what it is. Where, you should be very happy,

00:16:09.612 --> 00:16:11.207
that it is working out that way.

00:16:11.327 --> 00:16:17.459
Somebody has come? Let him come. Come along.

00:16:24.864 --> 00:16:31.776
So the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, may look to be little shaky.

00:16:31.896 --> 00:16:35.277
May look to be little feeble. But it is not.

00:16:35.397 --> 00:16:38.529
It is getting stronger and stronger.

00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:42.580
And it is getting embedded into the Mother Earth.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.706
And, that is what, is the test of you being the real seekers.

00:16:47.826 --> 00:16:51.400
You being the people who want truth.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.458
Who do not want a big show, big,

00:16:55.578 --> 00:16:59.161
sort of a, community sitting there,

00:16:59.281 --> 00:17:04.771
all going mad with some sort of a shouting, screaming and nonsense.

00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:08.681
As it is you know, Sahaja Yoga, is a living process.

00:17:08.801 --> 00:17:12.080
And, it goes both, grows both, both ways.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.631
Upwards and downwards.

00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:17.301
In the beginning it grows more downwards,

00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:20.453
and in the downwards process, we have to depend,

00:17:20.587 --> 00:17:24.705
on our vibrations very much. We must all the time remember,

00:17:24.825 --> 00:17:29.376
that we are realized souls. That we have got vibrations.

00:17:29.496 --> 00:17:31.524
This is the way we have to judge.

00:17:31.644 --> 00:17:33.794
This is the way we have to understand.

00:17:33.914 --> 00:17:38.291
The vibration is the only way, that we’ll know others.

00:17:38.411 --> 00:17:42.358
Not by something, something you will feel

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:45.422
that the person looks very sweet and nice and,

00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:47.768
may a snake come out of that person.

00:17:47.888 --> 00:17:51.671
So best is, to judge a person, through vibrations.

00:17:51.791 --> 00:17:53.953
Judge everything through vibrations.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:56.620
Not through your own understanding,

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.584
or superficial methods of judging others.

00:18:00.704 --> 00:18:03.786
Now, there are also so many conditionings we have got,

00:18:03.906 --> 00:18:08.463
by which we judge others. And these conditionings, can also,

00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:13.347
bias our judgment. So best way is to see the vibrations.

00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:16.428
Through vibrations, you will have the real knowledge

00:18:16.548 --> 00:18:18.388
about what is happening.

00:18:18.508 --> 00:18:22.864
Now many people, in the beginning, also start misguiding.

00:18:22.984 --> 00:18:25.938
So best is to develop your vibrations.

00:18:26.058 --> 00:18:28.550
For that you have to grow inward first of all.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.345
If you grow inward, deeply, then what will happen,

00:18:33.465 --> 00:18:38.878
that outward growth will be very solid, and would be exact.

00:18:38.998 --> 00:18:41.059
You won’t have any problems with that.

00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:42.932
But if you do not grow inward,

00:18:43.052 --> 00:18:45.998
if you do not meditate and pay attention to it,

00:18:46.118 --> 00:18:51.423
and, I would say, it is more the dedication that you have,

00:18:51.543 --> 00:18:56.334
that works out so well that you grow upwards so well.

00:18:56.454 --> 00:18:59.914
I mean you can give a speech whenever you want about Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:00.034 --> 00:19:02.700
you can give realization to people whenever you want,

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.036
you can cure people whenever you want.

00:19:05.156 --> 00:19:07.561
But first, there should be a depth in you.

00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:09.365
If that you have not achieved,

00:19:09.485 --> 00:19:11.920
you just start superficially doing something.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.556
Then maybe you are hit, or maybe you are in trouble,

00:19:15.676 --> 00:19:20.787
or maybe you may start doubting yourself, maybe Sahaja Yoga too.

00:19:20.907 --> 00:19:24.994
So the first thing is for us to grow deeply.

00:19:25.114 --> 00:19:28.941
And while we are growing deeply, we have to also grow

00:19:29.061 --> 00:19:34.177
in such a manner that we understand our vibrations clearly.

00:19:34.297 --> 00:19:38.663
Now see a root, of a little plant,

00:19:38.783 --> 00:19:43.424
has a got a very small little cell at the base of it.

00:19:43.544 --> 00:19:46.577
And the plant, doesn’t know anything,

00:19:46.697 --> 00:19:49.172
as much as that little cell knows.

00:19:49.292 --> 00:19:54.662
Because it is going inside, by its own intelligence,

00:19:54.782 --> 00:19:56.305
its own vibrations.

00:19:56.425 --> 00:19:59.106
Now if it finds a stone, it doesn’t go and quarrel.

00:19:59.226 --> 00:20:02.330
So don’t fight with the people who are stonies.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.942
Just don’t argue with them.

00:20:04.062 --> 00:20:06.895
You cannot make them understand. It’s not possible.

00:20:07.015 --> 00:20:10.155
They have to be seekers and soft,

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:13.071
like the soft clay you can say,

00:20:13.191 --> 00:20:19.553
through which this little cell goes, penetrates.

00:20:19.673 --> 00:20:23.407
Then it finds, supposing, it finds a big stone.

00:20:23.803 --> 00:20:26.015
Then what, it goes round and round and round.

00:20:26.135 --> 00:20:29.435
So gives it a bandhan nicely! And goes down.

00:20:29.555 --> 00:20:32.906
Later on when it becomes a tree, he uses the stone

00:20:33.026 --> 00:20:36.967
for its, you see, for its support.

00:20:37.087 --> 00:20:38.134
So in the same way,

00:20:38.255 --> 00:20:41.276
you can go round and round and round somebody like that.

00:20:41.396 --> 00:20:44.188
But, giving just bandhan without saying anything.

00:20:44.308 --> 00:20:47.462
In your heart. Not saying, arguing with him anything.

00:20:47.582 --> 00:20:50.485
Because you’ll break your head but he will never be alright.

00:20:50.605 --> 00:20:52.777
So best is not to argue with him.

00:20:52.897 --> 00:20:54.884
But just give him bandhan in your heart

00:20:55.004 --> 00:20:58.003
and somehow or another bind it. So that later on,

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:00.478
you see, he will become Sahaja Yogi,

00:21:00.598 --> 00:21:02.153
but will be a big support to us.

00:21:02.273 --> 00:21:04.861
Because it’s just a stone you see. Just now,

00:21:04.981 --> 00:21:08.857
use soft people, people who are easy people,

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:14.086
people who are seekers, who are not so complicated.

00:21:14.967 --> 00:21:17.006
And, you cannot argue it out.

00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:20.093
Sahaja Yoga cannot be argued out, cannot be explained to.

00:21:20.213 --> 00:21:23.157
Only thing you have to get it. And if they don’t get it,

00:21:23.277 --> 00:21:25.974
you cannot argue it out: “Oh this is this, this is this”.

00:21:26.094 --> 00:21:28.466
Like, one reporter was asking me:

00:21:28.586 --> 00:21:30.887
“why is it I’m not getting realization?”.

00:21:31.007 --> 00:21:33.466
I couldn’t tell him that he was such an egoist.

00:21:33.586 --> 00:21:36.684
I couldn’t tell him that so I said: “maybe this, maybe that”.

00:21:36.804 --> 00:21:38.727
you see, I was avoiding the topic!

00:21:38.847 --> 00:21:40.628
No use telling him you are a big egoist.

00:21:40.748 --> 00:21:43.819
How can you get your realization? Because if I tell him like that,

00:21:43.939 --> 00:21:47.676
then he would be, just off! Absolutely. And he would be against

00:21:47.796 --> 00:21:49.339
Sahaja Yoga completely.

00:21:49.459 --> 00:21:53.589
So we have to use also, tactfully, a method by which

00:21:53.709 --> 00:21:57.649
we do not hurt others. But try to be nice and gentle,

00:21:57.769 --> 00:22:00.009
so they like at least your outer appearance

00:22:00.129 --> 00:22:04.911
that they are very gentle people, they
are very good people and all that.

00:22:05.165 --> 00:22:08.854
Now, in Sahaja Yoga also there is a temptation you might have.

00:22:08.974 --> 00:22:11.427
Because you suddenly get lot of money sometimes,

00:22:11.547 --> 00:22:13.398
suddenly get a big position.

00:22:13.518 --> 00:22:22.444
Suddenly, also you might get a very, rare, dynamic gifts.

00:22:22.564 --> 00:22:26.379
Like you can become great artist, you can become a great poet,

00:22:26.499 --> 00:22:29.761
you might be, something might happen to you suddenly.

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:34.204
You get a public speaking gifts or anything like that.

00:22:34.324 --> 00:22:37.882
But these are all temptations, and one should not fall into it.

00:22:38.002 --> 00:22:40.997
Of course you must use them for Sahaja Yoga, is alright.

00:22:41.117 --> 00:22:42.738
But you should not fall into it

00:22:42.858 --> 00:22:45.369
and start thinking I’m something great. You see.

00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:50.270
If that is done, then there is a big problem because,

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:56.369
such a thing gets a person completely out of Sahaja Yoga

00:22:56.489 --> 00:22:59.143
and he gets also punished, in a way.

00:22:59.263 --> 00:23:01.185
Maybe he loses his powers.

00:23:01.305 --> 00:23:06.603
So it’s best is, to keep to your Sahaja Yoga meditation.

00:23:06.723 --> 00:23:09.103
Keep to your own understanding.

00:23:09.223 --> 00:23:11.568
Know yourself, that is the best way.

00:23:11.688 --> 00:23:16.383
And not to be diverted by all these temptations.

00:23:16.503 --> 00:23:19.029
But the same can be used for Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:22.429
If that is used for Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing wrong.

00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:26.712
Because these gifts are given to you, not to tempt you but,

00:23:26.832 --> 00:23:29.340
for using for Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:34.117
For example, she got my photograph with the light on my head.

00:23:34.237 --> 00:23:42.000
That means there is something happen, between her and the light.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.462
Because how did I get that light upon my head is a problem.

00:23:45.582 --> 00:23:50.022
To be understood, very simply, that the Vishnumaya is the,

00:23:50.878 --> 00:23:54.954
is the, Goddess for light. For electricity.

00:23:55.493 --> 00:23:59.245
And if She wants, She can turn it into any angle

00:23:59.365 --> 00:24:03.448
and can put a subtle meaning to her photograph.

00:24:03.568 --> 00:24:06.072
Now people have taken photographs of the clouds

00:24:06.192 --> 00:24:08.501
and they found me there, absolutely there.

00:24:08.621 --> 00:24:11.187
People believe it or not but it is so.

00:24:11.307 --> 00:24:13.515
Two photographs they saw like that.

00:24:13.635 --> 00:24:16.687
And normally we don’t take photographs of the clouds.

00:24:16.807 --> 00:24:18.810
But it showed in such a way that,

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:25.275
they first saw a very, luminous, cluster of a cloud.

00:24:25.395 --> 00:24:29.265
And then it expanded and started looking like a Ganesha.

00:24:29.385 --> 00:24:31.385
So, their attention was attracted.

00:24:31.505 --> 00:24:38.018
Then, strings of lights started flowing from both the sides.

00:24:38.138 --> 00:24:40.181
And they found two clusters.

00:24:40.301 --> 00:24:42.467
So they took photos of these two clusters

00:24:42.588 --> 00:24:45.298
and when they developed it, they found my photographs,

00:24:45.418 --> 00:24:47.393
two photographs of mine were there.

00:24:47.513 --> 00:24:50.974
One was with, even with the nose thing, when I was wearing it,

00:24:51.094 --> 00:24:52.360
means very latest ones!

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.327
And another one where I look more like a, Red Indian face.

00:24:58.447 --> 00:25:01.132
That kind, coming out of the thing. It’s clearly,

00:25:01.252 --> 00:25:04.176
very clearly you can see. So that’s how they have taken it.

00:25:04.296 --> 00:25:08.322
It’s in the Bible, that you will know the Holy Ghost,

00:25:08.442 --> 00:25:14.124
with the forms of the clouds. Its written down.

00:25:14.244 --> 00:25:16.109
So this is how it is verified.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.835
But how many people are going to believe it? Very few.

00:25:18.955 --> 00:25:21.955
Very few people are going to believe that this is natural.

00:25:22.075 --> 00:25:25.078
They’ll think “oh, it’s all made up and done up and all that”.

00:25:25.198 --> 00:25:29.051
Because even if the nose ring is showing, is too much.

00:25:29.171 --> 00:25:31.083
Now this Vishnumaya works that way.

00:25:31.203 --> 00:25:34.325
There are so many other Deities who work out something

00:25:34.445 --> 00:25:36.908
in a different way. But whatever it is,

00:25:37.028 --> 00:25:39.705
they are all for your construction.

00:25:39.825 --> 00:25:43.908
For your building up as a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:25:44.028 --> 00:25:47.882
So the inner movement is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:48.002 --> 00:25:51.386
I’m very happy to know that you people are gathering here,

00:25:51.506 --> 00:25:54.617
for meditation and you’re listening to my tapes

00:25:54.737 --> 00:25:58.036
and are growing up well, and I was very happy to see

00:25:58.156 --> 00:26:01.832
the way you are growing. And keep your steady growth.

00:26:01.952 --> 00:26:04.723
Then you’ll become great Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:04.843 --> 00:26:09.885
I’m sure one day, New Zealand or Australia,

00:26:10.005 --> 00:26:16.450
may become the leader, of all the world to, follow, spirituality.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:20.582
Because, India is, of course, I must say India is spiritually

00:26:20.702 --> 00:26:23.735
very developed but, they are not leaders I think.

00:26:23.855 --> 00:26:27.565
So far, I have not seen much leaders coming out of India.

00:26:27.685 --> 00:26:30.424
But, once the leaders start coming out of India,

00:26:30.544 --> 00:26:32.952
we can say the, then the second position

00:26:33.072 --> 00:26:36.756
should be given to Australia and New Zealand.

00:26:36.876 --> 00:26:40.759
There will be great people coming out of Australia and New Zealand.

00:26:40.879 --> 00:26:47.848
No doubt about it. Because the, the root part maybe in India.

00:26:47.968 --> 00:26:50.748
The foundation part maybe from India,

00:26:50.868 --> 00:26:53.926
but the tree part, will be from the west.

00:26:54.046 --> 00:26:55.875
And that is how the east and west

00:26:55.995 --> 00:26:59.400
is going to complete the tree of Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.229
blossoming and giving fruits.

00:27:02.349 --> 00:27:04.182
May God bless you all.
