1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:11,896
Today we have all been waiting to celebrate
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.

2
00:00:14,947 --> 00:00:22,289
There's so much significant that we are
in a place here,

3
00:00:23,262 --> 00:00:34,111
the same type of a hut Jesus had when He
was born,

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,775
and the wind was blowing from all sides

5
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:46,335
and it was difficult to keep the room very
warm,

6
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:54,516
though if it is correct He was not born
in the month of December,

7
00:00:54,717 --> 00:01:01,751
in a warmer month, not so very cold, maybe
this much as you see;

8
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:09,671
so maybe that the climate of today is quite
significant, with the climate

9
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,044
that He must have felt.

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,416
As for you people, you don't feel any
discomfort in this climate,

11
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:25,624
nor in these surroundings nor in the Spartan
living.

12
00:01:25,904 --> 00:01:30,754
He never felt any discomfort, nor
His Mother.

13
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:35,967
When our attention is on our Spirit,

14
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:48,709
then we do not feel the discomfort of nature
or of worldly things.

15
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:57,011
This is the first sign when a Sahaja Yogi
starts

16
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:03,094
complaining about comforts,

17
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:09,166
then the first sign is that he is not
a Sahaja Yogi as yet.

18
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:20,133
To begin with you just get absolutely
acclimatized with the climate and enjoy

19
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:30,337
the style, the speed, the way it is molding
you.

20
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:37,969
There's no friction between the nature and
the body because the Spirit

21
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,832
which is synchronizer, helps you to become
one

22
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:50,037
with this nature and enjoy the best part
of it.

23
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:54,627
The way you are enjoying it shows that you
are great Sahaja Yogis,

24
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:57,018
and that goes to My credit, I think,

25
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:05,078
that you people have accepted all
the discomfort as enjoyments.

26
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:11,177
Christ coming was a great event as I have
told you

27
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:20,250
to establish Agnya Chakra. And He was born
on this Earth

28
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:24,941
but much before He was born
in the consciousness

29
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:33,954
and that absolute consciousness itself took
birth as Jesus Christ.

30
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:38,860
To explain His life is only possible if you
are Realized souls,

31
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:44,858
otherwise you cannot explain Christ - what
He was, how He worked -

32
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:51,462
still it's very difficult to explain many
things in Sahaja Yoga as you know,

33
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:57,434
you just go on seeing things. Today you
saw fountains

34
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:01,227
coming out of the lake, which nobody can
explain,

35
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:05,889
even the engineer said that they can't
explain, nobody can explain it.

36
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,629
It just happens that the water gets
excited, feels the Divinity

37
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,328
and starts pouring out its love in a bubbly
manner.

38
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,933
Can you imagine that even the water can
feel it?

39
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:27,768
You have seen how the light can feel it,
in the same way every element can feel it.

40
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:32,045
All those elements are within us,
the highest of all,

41
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:38,412
as we say, is the light,

42
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:46,325
because light has an effect and that is
governed by Jesus Christ.

43
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:54,117
Light has an effect, light shows things
that are correct.

44
00:04:54,318 --> 00:05:02,393
That's the one which makes us understand
all the dimensions of worldly things

45
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:11,036
and ultimately when this light comes from
the Spirit and is enlightened by the Spirit,

46
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:17,765
then you start seeing the other dimensions
also which sometimes make you laugh,

47
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:24,282
sometimes make you smile and sometimes
make you cry also.

48
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:31,341
Such a beautiful new dimension you have
achieved through Sahaja Yoga,

49
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:36,217
but it was all built in within you and you
had to achieve it.

50
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:41,472
People on the other side had to work very
hard,

51
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:48,617
like Jesus Christ was born in a small manger
to show

52
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:53,287
that Divinity need not be born in royal
families,

53
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:57,417
can be born in a manger,

54
00:05:57,638 --> 00:06:02,041
can be born anywhere, makes no difference
to the Divinity.

55
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:10,453
But that has given some funny ideas
to people, that they are saying

56
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:17,682
we should make ourselves miserable

57
00:06:17,883 --> 00:06:24,690
and we should give away everything to God.
God doesn't want anything.

58
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:29,477
He cannot have anything, and you cannot
give anything.

59
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:34,278
Is a wrong idea that you become like
a pauper and give everything to God.

60
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:42,904
He doesn't want that. What He wants that
you have to be happy, joyous and enjoying.

61
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:45,117
That's the main point.

62
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:51,047
Also if you give a little bit, very little
bit to God,

63
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:54,050
then He gives you hundred times more.

64
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:58,214
That's why you have to give a very wee bit
to God.

65
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:01,867
But you don't have to hang yourself
by the trees

66
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:05,896
to prove that you want to sacrifice.

67
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:10,237
Christ has done everything for you. That's
the beauty of His life is

68
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:16,021
that from the very beginning of His birth
He has shown that He has enjoyed

69
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:23,751
no material well-being, as we call it.

70
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:33,145
He has not enjoyed any worldly things as we
know of

71
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:40,232
but that just means that He has done that
for us to see

72
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:45,917
that there is no need for us to hanker
after worldly things -

73
00:07:46,118 --> 00:07:50,438
they will hanker after us. You don't have
to worry about these things.

74
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:55,234
What you have to worry is the Spirit,
the main thing.

75
00:07:56,506 --> 00:08:04,362
All His life, which was very short I should
say, He has been trying,

76
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:12,143
He was very much interested in evaluating
people

77
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:16,607
because He didn't know what sort of things
these human beings are.

78
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:24,180
He was a foreigner for these human beings.
So He tried to evaluate

79
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:27,611
and in that evaluation

80
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:35,699
He said many things which are very
remarkable, and one has to understand.

81
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:42,469
One of the things He said that don't throw
your pearls before people

82
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:49,667
who do not want to understand you. For
Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand

83
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:55,014
that you should not talk about Sahaja Yoga
to people who are anti-God.

84
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:58,082
Now he may be your brother, may be your
sister, may be your father,

85
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:03,523
may be anyone, there is no need to convince
them about Sahaja Yoga

86
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:08,050
because they are not your relations.

87
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:11,700
Many people have only this worry how
to convince my husband

88
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:18,655
or how to convince my brother, there is
no need at all for you to work it out,

89
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:25,168
just give them up on this point.

90
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:30,337
The another thing He has told us which is
very important, I think,

91
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,869
that we must forgive.

92
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:39,233
He has given the greatest weapon that we
must forgive.

93
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:43,326
Now it's such a practical thing to forgive.

94
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:47,887
If you just forgive, the person doesn't
exist anymore

95
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:53,523
and the person doesn't trouble you anymore,
nor is he in your attention,

96
00:09:53,724 --> 00:10:00,065
just to forgive is a simplest thing to do
and the highest thing to do

97
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:09,233
to get relief from worldly or mental
tortures that we get.

98
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:19,279
His life has been a story of spirituality,

99
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,909
going through all kinds of turmoils and
tortures,

100
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,153
all types of troubles that the Spirit can
go through,

101
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:36,487
to show that nobody can kill that Spirit,

102
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:42,896
as it’s said in the Gita: "Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah,

103
00:10:43,097 --> 00:10:47,068
na chainam kledayantya apo, na shosayati
marutah".

104
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:49,928
It cannot be killed, it's an eternal life

105
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:53,433
and He tried to prove through His life
the eternity,

106
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:59,866
from the beginning to the end He showed
that Spirit is above matter,

107
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:04,230
that nothing can dominate Spirit.

108
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:08,535
It's a very big thing He has done for us is
to create

109
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:17,521
such a big confidence in our Spirit.

110
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:20,976
He has proved it beyond doubt.

111
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:26,289
I hope you people will understand and will
not bother Me or bother yourself

112
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,996
with small petty things here and there,
is nothing important.

113
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:42,831
Ask for bigger things, eternal things,
valuable things.

114
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,429
Also I am very happy that you like this
place

115
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,576
and you are enjoying yourself here very
much

116
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:52,528
and today we have declared so many
marriages.

117
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:55,639
There have been so many events in this
short time.

118
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,715
So I would like to bless you all for this
Christmas Eve

119
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,293
and I wish you all very happy Christmas and
Happy New Year.
