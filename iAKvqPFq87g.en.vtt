00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.780
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:58.350
At the very outset, I have to tell you that
truth is what it is.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.190
You cannot change it; you cannot transform
it; you cannot conceptualize it.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:15.730
It is what it is; it was what it was and it
will be what it will be.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:31.310
Whatever, I want to tell you today, I have
to request you, to keep your mind open, like

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.430
scientist.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.400
You need not believe into what I say.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.840
We have had enough of problems with blind
faith.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:51.660
But keep your minds open in case this proves;
then you have to believe, believe in it.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.000
If you are honest people, you have to believe
in it.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.860
Because it is for the benevolence of your
individual self, for the benevolence of your

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.019
city, your country and world at large.

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:18.250
Most of the problems of this world come from
human beings; humbly we must admit.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.230
There something wrong somewhere that we create
problems.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.290
And these problems come to human beings when
there is a problem with these centres here

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.370
as explained to you.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.320
Now these centres do exist.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.070
These are energy centres within you.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.330
And when they are, (Mother speaks aside, Thank
you, (Lawrence?)

00:03:47.330 --> 00:04:00.010
thank you, its cold, I don’t like, I like,
just ordinary (glass of water)) these centres,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:12.100
when they go into jeopardy, we have this problem
of human beings behaving in funny manners.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:26.610
When this power, which is within us, which
is in three and a half coils; that’s why

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.420
it is called as kundalini; “kundalini”
means a coil.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.800
It’s a mathematical thing.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:45.320
It rises like a primule in a seed and rises
upward against the gravity, and pierces through

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:56.210
your fontanel bone area, which was the soft
bone in your childhood.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:05.729
(Mother speaks aside, Thank you very much,
(referring to glass of water) thank you)

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:16.949
Now the truth is that you are not this body,
you are not this mind, you are not this ego,

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.300
you are not these conditionings.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:28.290
What we say, “This is my house, this is
my car, this is my wife, this is my husband,

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:36.660
my children” but who is this ‘my’ which
owns it?

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:47.180
So that ‘my’ which owns it is the ‘I’
the “self”; is the ‘pure spirit’ within

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.630
you.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:06:01.990
The second truth is, that there is all-pervading
power of Divine Love, of love, which does

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.480
all the living work.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.820
Now you see beautiful flowers all over since
I’ve come to Australia.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.710
I’ve been seeing all kinds of flowers, beautiful
flowers.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.010
Who does this miracle?

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.350
They’re different, of a different shape,
different colour.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.350
“Who” does that?

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:26.540
Who runs our heart, we never ask this question
to ourselves.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.160
We take all living work for granted.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:38.980
We never bother to find out who does that.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.940
The third question that should come to us
really, which cannot be answered by anyone:

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.229
“Why are we on this Earth?

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:54.180
What is our purpose of coming to this Earth,
to be born as human beings, to be evolved

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.910
as human beings, what is the purpose?”

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:02.040
Is it just to insure our self and die?

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.200
Is that?

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.190
What is the purpose of life?

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.920
What is our identity?

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:16.850
And when we start asking these questions,
we find that nobody has been able to answer

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:28.310
this question.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.070
Science cannot answer this question.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.350
Science has its own limitations.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:43.300
So this all-pervading power, which does all
the living work, we have never felt it.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.360
We have read it in Scriptures that there is
all-pervading power of God’s love, there’s

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.070
the ‘Ruh’, is there.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:56.080
They call it Paramchaitanya or also they say
it is the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.640
But where is that?

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.830
Nobody has felt it, nobody has known about
it.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:11.370
Another problem is this that our civilizations
grew too big in the West, even in Australia,

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.370
everywhere.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:19.400
Like a big tree but what about the roots?

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.490
If you do not find the roots, the result is
as you have now recession; this problem, that

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.220
problem.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.360
So where are the roots?

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:37.190
If the knowledge of Science comes from West,
this knowledge comes to you, say from India,

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.539
or from East, what’s the harm.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:46.950
Because it is important that we should know
our roots.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:52.500
And these are the roots, this is the knowledge
of the roots that is within us.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.380
When there is problem outwardly, we should
know there must be some problem inside us

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.610
and we don’t know anything about ourselves;
nothing.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.020
What we know; about outside.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:16.910
But we don’t know what’s wrong with us;
where do we go wrong?

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:25.680
So it is very important to understand that
if there is a way of going through the last

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.320
breakthrough of our evolution, if there’s
a way that we can find out our identity, if

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:37.310
there’s a way we can know our inner self
fully, why not do it?

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.010
For which you don’t have to pay.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.620
You can’t pay; it’s an evolutionary process.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.470
It’s a living process!

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:51.910
For example, how much do we pay for these
flowers to Mother Earth?

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.440
Who’s done the job?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:08.699
It’s built-in in a seed, to germinate and
built-in in the Mother Land that it will germinate.

00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:09.820
We don’t pay for that.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.060
It’s already built-in there.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.510
In the same way if it is built-in within you,
you can’t pay for it.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:21.670
One thing, if you realize that you can’t
pay for your evolutionary process, for anything

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:30.810
that is Divinity, for anything that is pure;
half of the problems will be solved of this

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.680
guru shopping that you have been doing all
these days.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:43.360
Because if you are not going to pay for it,
and these people are asking for money, that

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.990
means something wrong with them!

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.000
You cannot market it!

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:59.050
Thus, we reach a point where we realize that
something spontaneous living process has to

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:00.400
take place.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:09.800
And that has become very, very easy in modern
times.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.550
Because it is described already, prophesized
in the Bible, it is the Last Judgment and

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.830
otherwise in the Koran it is “Qiyamah”,
means the Resurrection.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:25.260
Even in Indian scriptures they have described
about these special times when people who

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:33.190
will get so much disillusioned in the illusion,
they will be born and they will be disillusioned

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.480
that they take to reality, and this thing
will happen.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:45.089
It’s already predicted and this is the time,
such a fortunate time when we are all born.

00:11:45.089 --> 00:11:48.040
And it has to work out.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.730
It is your own power.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:58.700
It’s your own Mother, it’s your individual
Mother, and She knows everything about you.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.560
It’s all tape-recorded.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.670
And She is anxious to give you this Second
Birth.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.890
She is anxious.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.670
And She does it very beautifully.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:14.240
I’ve read some books which says that Kundalini
Awakening is very dangerous and all that.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240
I can’t understand!

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.589
It has never happened before like that.

00:12:17.589 --> 00:12:24.149
I’ve been working like this for the last,
I think, I don’t know how many years now;

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:30.630
at least twenty-five years and I’ve never
seen anybody being harmed.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.460
On the contrary, everybody’s helped; physically,
mentally, emotionally.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:48.210
Now there are three doctors who have got M.D.
in Delhi University for Sahaja Yoga, in various

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.210
subjects.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:54.339
Now there’s a fourth doctor who is trying
on blood cancer and all that.

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:58.980
For medical science, if you ask them who does
all these things they will say “autonomous

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.400
nervous system”.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.750
But who is this “auto”, who is this “auto”
that does this work?

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.840
They can’t answer; they’re honest; they
can’t answer.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:18.610
So this autonomous nervous system, which is
parasympathetic and sympathetic, the parasympathetic

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:25.280
nervous system will take over and we can control
our parasympathetic through this.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:33.720
Of course, I don’t know how far the doctors
here are sensitive to a subject like that

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.070
but in Russia I was surprised.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:41.360
There are two hundred doctors who are practicing
Sahaja Yoga in Russia.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.980
Russian people are not so materialistic because
they have never known materialism much.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.680
About 30% of them are funny type.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:56.080
They’ll ask for Marlboro cigarettes but
70% are so sensitive to Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:02.240
I was amazed the way they took to me and threw
away all absurd gurus from them.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.170
Not one person could prosper.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:11.190
And no religion is allowed to be practiced
there where they have now started taking to

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.190
Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:19.410
It’s very amazing how these people who don’t
know even English, who don’t know about

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:25.520
God; they were not supposed to know about
any religion, they’re so clean, like a clean

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:31.080
slate and they have taken to Sahaja in such
a big manner; I’m surprised.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:38.510
In thousands and thousands of people, so sensitive,
so open-minded and scientifically so equipped.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:45.210
There were 300 scientists, I think maybe more,
who invited me.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:50.050
Started telling them about I…I thought,
better start from science.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.070
So they said, “Mother, no, don’t tell
us science; we know everything about science.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.810
No we don’t, You tell us the science of
God.”

00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:05.220
Such eager, intelligent, educated people.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:11.930
Now, this democracy of ours ‘so-called’,
today also in the newspaper.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.220
I read the same thing: “so-called democracy”.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:21.670
Because it looks sometimes like a demonocracy
you see, like you go to America; you can’t

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.840
even wear your wedding ring.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.710
They might take away your wedding ring also
and kill you for that.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:32.850
That’s supposed to be democracy!

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.330
You have to be extremely careful.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.810
I was surprised in Perth.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.470
We were going in the night for about thirty-five
kilometres.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.110
No gangsterism on the way, I was surprised.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.390
How this country is still saved.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:53.820
But it happens that this kind of democracy
without being in connection with that all-pervading

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.370
power can take you to anything.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.529
Same with religions.

00:15:59.529 --> 00:16:04.630
You take any religion, whether you are Hindu,
Christian, Muslim, anything.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.620
One can commit any sin.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:12.510
What’s the use of denouncing others; everybody
does the same I thing; no difference.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:24.400
All are only convinced they are something
excellent but they are not, in no way!

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:31.190
And so many things like this, when we start
seeing, we get disillusioned and we start

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:37.690
thinking, “Where is the truth, where is
the reality, what are we doing?”

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:43.709
At this time, I see; I call them ‘the seekers
of truth’.

00:16:43.709 --> 00:16:55.190
These are special category of people, as described
by so many poets.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:17:07.010
And when it works out, they are the ones who
jump into themselves.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:12.669
Jump into this beautiful era, of what we call
the New Age.

00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:13.940
It’s a happening.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.740
It’s not just branding yourself New Age;
somebody calls themselves by some other name,

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.360
it’s not that.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.589
It’s another Christian, Hindu, Muslim branding.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:30.290
But something that has to happen and that
happening is awakening of the kundalini.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:38.010
William Blake has said that men of God will
be born in those days, men of God.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:42.110
And they will become divine and they will
have powers to make others divine, exactly

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:49.610
that is Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:18:00.880
Moreover it’s such an internal happening
that, all outside things are not needed.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.429
For example, some people go to Himalayas,
stand on their heads.

00:18:06.429 --> 00:18:11.320
Or they starve themselves, fast, do all kinds
of things.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.320
And they find nothing.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.799
They can’t understand how it happens.

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:21.960
They go on telling me; Mother we did this,
we did that and we never found anything within

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.840
ourselves.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:32.190
So first you are to be connected to that all
pervading power, this is the power that’s

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:38.980
extremely dynamic no doubt, but it’s the
power of compassion.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.840
So you also become very dynamic.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.040
I know poor people becoming very rich suddenly.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.909
I have seen people who are sick becoming all
right.

00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:55.940
We have a very nice place in Perth, where
a boy who was already married, had children,

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.119
two children.

00:18:57.119 --> 00:19:03.940
He was in an accident and whole his brain
as if came out; a terrible condition.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.419
And doctors gave it up that he will die.

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:11.779
Not that he was saved, but he is absolutely
normal now.

00:19:11.779 --> 00:19:19.289
I was in tears to see him so beautifully cured.

00:19:19.289 --> 00:19:31.669
So this all-pervading power, which is the
Ocean of Bliss, Ocean of Knowledge, Ocean

00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:39.889
of Compassion, is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

00:19:39.889 --> 00:19:43.549
This power starts flowing through you.

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:47.640
You become a vehicle of that power.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:57.330
And once you learn how to make others the
same way, how to raise their kundalini, you

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.929
can create thousands of people who are self-realized.

00:20:00.929 --> 00:20:09.239
Surprisingly, in Australia many children are
born who are realized souls, very surprising.

00:20:09.239 --> 00:20:16.880
Maybe because in other European countries
children are killed by the parents.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.259
So maybe they are taking to you people who
are kind to children and your government is

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:23.830
also very kind to them.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:33.830
And these children are not understood by parents
sometimes because they’re very different.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.779
And they are very moral.

00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:44.640
So all the problems that we have created out
of our ideas of sort of modernism or any kind

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.159
of thing.

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:54.360
And that we see that our children are going
to dogs is all stopped through this awakening.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:03.299
It’s like this, that if I tell some children
don’t take to drugs, they’ll never listen

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:05.100
to me.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:11.330
If, supposing I’m carrying a snake in my
hand and there’s darkness all over, I can’t

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.869
see anything and somebody says, “you have
a snake in your hand”, I’ll never give

00:21:14.869 --> 00:21:17.720
up if I’m very obstinate, I will never give
up.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.760
I’ll say, “No, it’s just a rope.”

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:26.379
But when there’s little light I will myself
give it up.

00:21:26.379 --> 00:21:32.120
In the same way it happens; it works this
way that you yourself become powerful.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:41.019
Throw away all that is destructive, all that
is to be given up.

00:21:41.019 --> 00:21:45.390
I don’t have to say “Don’t do this;
the Ten Commandments we don’t talk about

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:50.379
in Sahaja Yoga, but only in you, the religion
is born.

00:21:50.379 --> 00:21:56.359
The innate religion, which keeps you religious,
righteous, compassionate and dynamic.

00:21:56.359 --> 00:22:01.691
You don’t have to change your dress, you
don’t have to change your lifestyle, you

00:22:01.691 --> 00:22:06.840
don’t have to give up your wives and children,
but you get it just where you are.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.869
It’s so simple, made so simple.

00:22:10.869 --> 00:22:16.019
I would say, if you are hungry, you can have
it.

00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:22.049
Like, if I’ve done the cooking, and if you
are hungry and you will say otherwise “mother

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:23.229
just lets have the food.”

00:22:23.229 --> 00:22:27.440
But if you are not, then you will go on discussing,
arguing, this, that.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.549
These are all mental feats.

00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:36.519
I mean if you want to ask me a question, you
can ask me any number and I am quite an expert

00:22:36.519 --> 00:22:43.860
now 25 years I have been facing all of you
and I can answer you, but its all a mental

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.860
feat.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.240
It doesn’t give you realization.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:51.679
You are here for your realization, by which
you are helped so much that physically, mentally,

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:57.809
emotionally, and spiritually you become all
right.

00:22:57.809 --> 00:23:04.229
Firstly, you become peaceful, absolutely peaceful.

00:23:04.229 --> 00:23:06.590
The peace within you, you achieve.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.000
How?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.299
You live with your thoughts.

00:23:10.299 --> 00:23:17.779
The thoughts rise, fall, rise, fall and in
between these thoughts, there’s a little

00:23:17.779 --> 00:23:18.789
space.

00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:22.859
Mostly, you are thinking about the future
or the past.

00:23:22.859 --> 00:23:27.269
You cannot be in the present.

00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:29.309
In the present, there is no thought.

00:23:29.309 --> 00:23:31.840
You are with reality.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.510
So when the kundalini rises, these thoughts
elongate and the space in between, of the

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.710
present is established.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:48.029
When that space is established, you become
peaceful, absolutely peaceful within yourself.

00:23:48.029 --> 00:24:00.220
I have met many people, elite people, I should
say, very elite, who have got Peace Prizes.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:06.759
They’re so hot-tempered people, I tell you,
that you have to touch them with a barge pole.

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:08.679
I mean you cannot go near them.

00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:13.440
It is horribly hot-tempered people, and they
have got peace awards I don’t know how.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.440
No peace within.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.600
At the slightest thing, they just shoot off.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.640
No patience, nothing.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:28.429
And then I realize that it’s so outside;
the whole thing is.

00:24:28.429 --> 00:24:34.049
They don’t understand if you don’t have
peace within, how can have a Peace Award?

00:24:34.049 --> 00:24:36.049
Well you can.

00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:38.919
That is our life.

00:24:38.919 --> 00:24:45.260
Now this peace is established within you and
you become, it’s a new dimension of existence,

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.770
where you become “thoughtlessly aware”.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:50.230
You are absolutely aware, but no thoughts.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.880
Just in peace.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:25:02.940
But you are aware; you are not fainted down
or you are not in some sort of a trance.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:12.450
You are absolutely aware and very much more
aware because, you are in Reality.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:17.259
Then the second dimension you achieve is that
you start feeling on your fingertips this

00:25:17.259 --> 00:25:20.720
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.769
Sometimes you feel it hot, also.

00:25:22.769 --> 00:25:30.259
On these fingertips are your sympathetic centres.

00:25:30.259 --> 00:25:35.559
And these Sympathetic Centres are from left
and right.

00:25:35.559 --> 00:25:39.779
They join together to make the Parasympathetic.

00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:47.240
So we have the left side and the right side
within us, and these left and right side,

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.940
indicates on our right and left side.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:56.849
On the left side we get our emotional and
the right side our mental.

00:25:56.849 --> 00:26:01.720
I mean English Language, “mental” means
something different, but I mean whatever we

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.749
do with our brain.

00:26:03.749 --> 00:26:10.629
And also you receive your physical problems
on the right hand side.

00:26:10.629 --> 00:26:14.529
These problems are indicative on your fingertips.

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:23.739
Said it by Hazrat Mohammed that at the time
of Qiyamah your hands will speak and will

00:26:23.739 --> 00:26:28.190
give witness against you; means they will
tell you what’s wrong with you.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:33.539
But not only that; they also tell you what’s
wrong with others.

00:26:33.539 --> 00:26:40.399
Now somehow if you know how to correct these
centres, you’re all right, and correct the

00:26:40.399 --> 00:26:44.929
centres of others you can also make them all
right.

00:26:44.929 --> 00:26:49.230
It’s so simple, it’s all within you, all
the mechanism is within you.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.940
It’s all there.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.139
Only thing you have to understand the importance
of it.

00:26:55.139 --> 00:26:57.419
Without that you can never be happy.

00:26:57.419 --> 00:27:01.529
This power, which is there, is the power of
pure desire.

00:27:01.529 --> 00:27:06.210
All other desires are not pure.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.340
Today we want to have say; some flowers.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.730
Tomorrow we want to have a house; the day
after tomorrow we want to have helicopter.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.120
I don’t know; we go on and on.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:21.080
So every desire, which is fulfilled, is never
satisfied!

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.320
Once we get it, it’s finished.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:28.279
Then again of course, it’s a law of economics
also, that in general, wants are not satiable.

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:29.749
It’s a fact.

00:27:29.749 --> 00:27:33.549
But this desire, whether you know it or not,
is within you.

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:39.580
Whether you are aware of it or not, is the
desire to be one with this all-pervading power.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:45.320
And all the powers that you have within you
start manifesting.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:51.230
You have no idea at all what powers you have.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:56.759
I always say about a television taken to a
very remote village in India where they have

00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:59.029
never seen electricity.

00:27:59.029 --> 00:28:03.820
And if you tell them that in this box you
can see some films, they’ll say, “What,

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.740
this is just a box!

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.309
What are you telling us stories?”

00:28:07.309 --> 00:28:12.259
We also feel we are just a box, nothing more
than a box.

00:28:12.259 --> 00:28:15.389
But do you know what powers you have within
yourself?

00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:18.590
What you can do for this world?

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:23.549
What can you do for yourself, to your family,
to your children?

00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:33.109
How you can really be a great force of reforms
and transformation without troubling anybody?

00:28:33.109 --> 00:28:38.119
Because, after this you know the absolute
truth.

00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:40.869
You know them on your fingertips.

00:28:40.869 --> 00:28:46.759
If a man from India comes from the jail, he’ll
directly come either to Australia or he will

00:28:46.759 --> 00:28:55.350
go to America, wear a dress of a what you
call this saddhu baba dress in saffron colour,

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.169
and go and sit in any place and become a big
guru.

00:28:59.169 --> 00:29:01.929
Earn a lot of money.

00:29:01.929 --> 00:29:11.090
How will you know if this fellow has been
to jail, or is he a real person or not?

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:17.369
So on your fingertips you can find out the
absolute truth.

00:29:17.369 --> 00:29:27.620
A new dimension in you, that on your fingertips
you know not only your centres, but the centres

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.679
of others.

00:29:28.679 --> 00:29:32.590
Everybody feels the same way, knows the same
way.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:37.510
Then where is the quarrel, where is the argument,
where is the war?

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:44.490
Now we have in India sometimes, people coming
from sixty nations because Sahaja Yoga is

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.020
now practised in sixty nations.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:50.370
I’ve never seen them quarrelling, fighting,
of course they pull each other’s leg and

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:57.200
have a little humor about it, but never have
I seen fighting, never!

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.080
No question, no question of argument.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:05.529
Because, you do not know the absolute truth,
so somebody says that Christianity is good,

00:30:05.529 --> 00:30:11.559
somebody says this Islam is good, somebody
says that is good or democracy is good, or

00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:12.720
communism is good.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.720
How?

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.119
How do you know that?

00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:23.009
Because you have got yarn in your heads, and
that’s how you’re formed your own ideas

00:30:23.009 --> 00:30:25.720
and you’re all fighting with each other.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.529
It’s all mental, which is all limited.

00:30:28.529 --> 00:30:34.909
But, with this, you know the Absolute and
is tangible.

00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:36.549
You can diagnose people.

00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:46.619
One fellow went to Huston and he said “Mother,
I was half dead with diagnosis only.

00:30:46.619 --> 00:30:49.429
But I said, “You don’t have to do anything
in Sahaja Yoga like that.

00:30:49.429 --> 00:30:52.460
You can diagnose about yourself, you can diagnose
about others.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.629
There’s no need to go through all that.

00:30:56.629 --> 00:31:01.919
This is what it is that you have to have your
own powers manifesting.

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:05.669
And you must have the full knowledge about
it.

00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:09.279
It should not be half way.

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:17.250
Your attention becomes extremely innocent
and powerful.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:23.219
The attention, when it is diverted everywhere;
you see you get confused and people get schizophrenia,

00:31:23.219 --> 00:31:24.219
this, that; all that.

00:31:24.219 --> 00:31:33.289
But here the attention is very innocent and
such a person, even if he radiates or even

00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:41.320
if he looks at or glances at somebody; he
can give peace; he can give redemption; he

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:47.719
can do so many things, he can do, because
his attention has become enlightened.

00:31:47.719 --> 00:31:51.649
Sitting down here you can know about anybody
you want to know.

00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:57.159
You can know about the people who are dead,
or the people who are very far away.

00:31:57.159 --> 00:32:04.799
You can find out sitting down.

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:08.130
This is what we can call as “collective
consciousness”.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:14.399
A new dimension of consciousness comes to
you about which Jung has written, collective

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:15.879
consciousness.

00:32:15.879 --> 00:32:19.019
So you develop this collective consciousness
within yourself.

00:32:19.019 --> 00:32:23.230
For that you don’t need any education, you
don’t need anything.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.230
Even villagers can do it.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:28.239
Even small little children can do it, because
they know this power.

00:32:28.239 --> 00:32:33.889
As all of us have the power to see something,
as you all can see me sitting down here, in

00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:44.419
the same way you can know about others; know
about yourself; without doing any acrobats.

00:32:44.419 --> 00:32:50.249
So simple as that, all these powers are your.

00:32:50.249 --> 00:32:56.710
But above all, you jump in the Sea Of Joy.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:03.899
The whole problem is taken over by this all-pervading
power of God.

00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:06.230
We say we leave it to God, all right, leave
it to God.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.769
But you are not connected.

00:33:07.769 --> 00:33:11.320
When we pray also we are not connected.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:16.809
You know a telephone, which is not connected,
you go on moving it, it will get spoiled but

00:33:16.809 --> 00:33:18.450
you are not connected.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:25.539
After realization, even to, just a problem
comes to you and it gets solved, because you

00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:30.259
get out of your problem and you can see it
clearly and the Divine helps you.

00:33:30.259 --> 00:33:37.779
There have been so many blissful miracles
of Sahaja Yogis that now we have given up.

00:33:37.779 --> 00:33:42.211
We wanted to print them, but in one month
they became so much high and we didn’t know

00:33:42.211 --> 00:33:43.399
what to do.

00:33:43.399 --> 00:33:51.780
So, all over we have to not believe in God,
but you have to feel the bliss of God; how

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.169
He looks after you.

00:33:54.169 --> 00:34:00.369
It’s not just a talk or a sermon, but it’s
a happening and the happening has to take

00:34:00.369 --> 00:34:05.340
place; otherwise our attention, which is outside,
will not be taken inside.

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:11.589
It’s a question of understanding our own
value, respecting ourselves.

00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:13.839
And it works.

00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:16.649
As you all are here I know you are all seekers.

00:34:16.649 --> 00:34:18.950
Otherwise you would not be here.

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:22.649
And it is your right to get this realization.

00:34:22.649 --> 00:34:27.440
Sahaja means “born”: ‘sah’ is with
you; ‘jah’ is “born”.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.359
“With you” is “born”.

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:34.369
This right to get to this yoga, means the
union with the Divine.

00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:39.860
And is your right and you should assert and
all those who will ask for it have to have

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:40.860
it.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.050
It is their right.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:45.470
The whole thing has built in our evolutionary
process.

00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:52.649
And now, the last bit has to happen and it
will work out.

00:34:52.649 --> 00:34:57.070
I have to tell you one thing more; that it
is not an individual happening.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:59.400
It’s a collective happening.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.910
It works better when there are many people.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:08.460
Also when you have to know about it, learn
about it, take advantage of it, you have to

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.619
come to the collective.

00:35:09.619 --> 00:35:15.060
It’s not like other organizations where
they have an introductory lecture and after

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.700
that they start marketing it.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.609
You cannot market it.

00:35:18.609 --> 00:35:21.940
For definite, you cannot market it.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.590
It is divine love.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.460
And love you can never market.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:32.230
In the same way this is Divine Love; how can
you market it?

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:38.390
So, if you have respect for yourself, if you
really love yourself, and you care for yourself,

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:46.030
you are not self-centered because after all,
you are a human being; epitome of evolution.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:53.530
So, only thing you have to give some time
and come to the collective and progress in

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:54.530
Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:55.900
It’s not difficult at all.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:02.070
Nothing is to be done as I told you; it’s
not to stand on your head or anything.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.020
Just wherever you are, you’ll get it.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.280
It’s so simple.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.280
Because the time has come.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.140
And you are not obliged to me buying for anything.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:19.390
It’s just happening, happening all over
and happens to everyone.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:23.080
So I would request you to pay attention to
it.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.870
And once you get your realization, you should
really come to the collective because it would

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:35.590
be like what Christ has described as sprouted,
seeds which were thrown somewhere and were

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:40.050
lost, so you have to grow, and that growth
is important.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:45.640
Once it happens, if you have any concern for
your country, for yourself and for the world,

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.220
you should try to keep to it and understand.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.680
It’s as simple as that.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:57.410
So the last thing as I told you, jump in the
ocean of joy.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:04.140
That is, when your ego is pampered you feel
happy and when the ego is punctured, you feel

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.280
unhappy.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.340
It is joy, has no duality.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.770
It’s just a witness state in which you witness
everything like a drama.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:18.290
And you lose your age very much.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:22.000
You feel very dynamic; at the same time very
compassionate.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.870
As you know I’m seventy-one years of age
and I’m traveling practically every third

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:27.870
day.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:28.870
And it’s all right.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:30.350
People said “Mother, don’t you feel you
are traveling too much?”

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:32.730
I said, “I’m not traveling, I’m just
sitting everywhere.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.700
Where am I traveling?”

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.200
In the same way, it happens to you.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:44.920
And the ageing and all that never comes into
your mind.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.470
You just live; live in the present.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:54.970
And you just enjoy life; enjoy the company
of all other realized souls.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:56.290
All over the world you have relations.

00:37:56.290 --> 00:38:01.890
Wherever you go they’ll be all there to
help you, to look after you.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:06.780
Something happens to one person, all over
the world they will try to help, the doctors

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:14.770
will run to that place, people will pray,
and I mean they will see to it that the person

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:15.770
is saved.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:22.640
It’s such a big family, such a beautiful
family into which I would request you to join.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:32.080
May God bless you!

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:41.790
Now, I cannot force self realization, cannot
be done, because I respect your freedom.

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:49.380
You are given freedom at a human level because
you have to ascent with your own, with your

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:54.260
own desire, I cannot force on you anything.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:39:02.770
As you have to accept it that you want to
have it.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:07.810
I would request people who don’t want to
have it, they should leave the hall and leave

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:13.450
others, but those who want to have it are
very welcome, and they can have it.

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:19.220
Even the knowledge they can have it without
any difficulties.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:27.580
So all those who want to go away should leave
the hall, please, I will be very thankful,

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.010
because it cannot work on people who do not
want it.

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:35.960
On the contrary it doesn’t help others also
to have such people among you who don’t

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:45.590
want to have it.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:55.440
It will take hardly ten minutes and I would
request you not to disturb others when we

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.050
are in the process of it.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:04.850
Actually it happens spontaneously without
anything but as there are little problems

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:10.760
on the centers, you have to nourish your centers
yourself as I’ll tell you, its very simple

00:40:10.760 --> 00:42:28.190
and will show you how we

00:42:28.190 --> 00:53:02.070
do it.

00:53:02.070 --> 01:14:08.810
