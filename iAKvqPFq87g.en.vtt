01:39.070 --> 01:43.780
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:43.780 --> 01:58.350
At the very outset, I have to tell you that
truth is what it is.

01:58.350 --> 02:05.190
You cannot change it; you cannot transform
it; you cannot conceptualize it.

02:05.190 --> 02:15.730
It is what it is; it was what it was and it
will be what it will be.

02:15.730 --> 02:31.310
Whatever, I want to tell you today, I have
to request you, to keep your mind open, like

02:31.310 --> 02:32.430
scientist.

02:32.430 --> 02:35.400
You need not believe into what I say.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.840
We have had enough of problems with blind
faith.

02:39.840 --> 02:51.660
But keep your minds open in case this proves;
then you have to believe, believe in it.

02:51.660 --> 02:55.000
If you are honest people, you have to believe
in it.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.860
Because it is for the benevolence of your
individual self, for the benevolence of your

03:04.860 --> 03:11.019
city, your country and world at large.

03:11.019 --> 03:18.250
Most of the problems of this world come from
human beings; humbly we must admit.

03:18.250 --> 03:25.230
There something wrong somewhere that we create
problems.

03:25.230 --> 03:32.290
And these problems come to human beings when
there is a problem with these centres here

03:32.290 --> 03:36.370
as explained to you.

03:36.370 --> 03:38.320
Now these centres do exist.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.070
These are energy centres within you.

03:41.070 --> 03:47.330
And when they are, (Mother speaks aside, Thank
you, (Lawrence?)

03:47.330 --> 04:00.010
thank you, its cold, I don’t like, I like,
just ordinary (glass of water)) these centres,

04:00.010 --> 04:12.100
when they go into jeopardy, we have this problem
of human beings behaving in funny manners.

04:12.100 --> 04:26.610
When this power, which is within us, which
is in three and a half coils; that’s why

04:26.610 --> 04:29.420
it is called as kundalini; “kundalini”
means a coil.

04:29.420 --> 04:31.800
It’s a mathematical thing.

04:31.800 --> 04:45.320
It rises like a primule in a seed and rises
upward against the gravity, and pierces through

04:45.320 --> 04:56.210
your fontanel bone area, which was the soft
bone in your childhood.

04:56.210 --> 05:05.729
(Mother speaks aside, Thank you very much,
(referring to glass of water) thank you)

05:05.729 --> 05:16.949
Now the truth is that you are not this body,
you are not this mind, you are not this ego,

05:16.949 --> 05:21.300
you are not these conditionings.

05:21.300 --> 05:28.290
What we say, “This is my house, this is
my car, this is my wife, this is my husband,

05:28.290 --> 05:36.660
my children” but who is this ‘my’ which
owns it?

05:36.660 --> 05:47.180
So that ‘my’ which owns it is the ‘I’
the “self”; is the ‘pure spirit’ within

05:47.180 --> 05:48.630
you.

05:48.630 --> 06:01.990
The second truth is, that there is all-pervading
power of Divine Love, of love, which does

06:01.990 --> 06:04.480
all the living work.

06:04.480 --> 06:08.820
Now you see beautiful flowers all over since
I’ve come to Australia.

06:08.820 --> 06:13.710
I’ve been seeing all kinds of flowers, beautiful
flowers.

06:13.710 --> 06:16.010
Who does this miracle?

06:16.010 --> 06:19.350
They’re different, of a different shape,
different colour.

06:19.350 --> 06:20.350
“Who” does that?

06:20.350 --> 06:26.540
Who runs our heart, we never ask this question
to ourselves.

06:26.540 --> 06:29.160
We take all living work for granted.

06:29.160 --> 06:38.980
We never bother to find out who does that.

06:38.980 --> 06:44.940
The third question that should come to us
really, which cannot be answered by anyone:

06:44.940 --> 06:48.229
“Why are we on this Earth?

06:48.229 --> 06:54.180
What is our purpose of coming to this Earth,
to be born as human beings, to be evolved

06:54.180 --> 06:56.910
as human beings, what is the purpose?”

06:56.910 --> 07:02.040
Is it just to insure our self and die?

07:02.040 --> 07:04.200
Is that?

07:04.200 --> 07:06.190
What is the purpose of life?

07:06.190 --> 07:07.920
What is our identity?

07:07.920 --> 07:16.850
And when we start asking these questions,
we find that nobody has been able to answer

07:16.850 --> 07:28.310
this question.

07:28.310 --> 07:32.070
Science cannot answer this question.

07:32.070 --> 07:36.350
Science has its own limitations.

07:36.350 --> 07:43.300
So this all-pervading power, which does all
the living work, we have never felt it.

07:43.300 --> 07:48.360
We have read it in Scriptures that there is
all-pervading power of God’s love, there’s

07:48.360 --> 07:50.070
the ‘Ruh’, is there.

07:50.070 --> 07:56.080
They call it Paramchaitanya or also they say
it is the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.640
But where is that?

07:58.640 --> 08:01.830
Nobody has felt it, nobody has known about
it.

08:01.830 --> 08:11.370
Another problem is this that our civilizations
grew too big in the West, even in Australia,

08:11.370 --> 08:12.370
everywhere.

08:12.370 --> 08:19.400
Like a big tree but what about the roots?

08:19.400 --> 08:24.490
If you do not find the roots, the result is
as you have now recession; this problem, that

08:24.490 --> 08:27.220
problem.

08:27.220 --> 08:30.360
So where are the roots?

08:30.360 --> 08:37.190
If the knowledge of Science comes from West,
this knowledge comes to you, say from India,

08:37.190 --> 08:41.539
or from East, what’s the harm.

08:41.539 --> 08:46.950
Because it is important that we should know
our roots.

08:46.950 --> 08:52.500
And these are the roots, this is the knowledge
of the roots that is within us.

08:52.500 --> 08:58.380
When there is problem outwardly, we should
know there must be some problem inside us

08:58.380 --> 09:03.610
and we don’t know anything about ourselves;
nothing.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.020
What we know; about outside.

09:06.020 --> 09:16.910
But we don’t know what’s wrong with us;
where do we go wrong?

09:16.910 --> 09:25.680
So it is very important to understand that
if there is a way of going through the last

09:25.680 --> 09:31.320
breakthrough of our evolution, if there’s
a way that we can find out our identity, if

09:31.320 --> 09:37.310
there’s a way we can know our inner self
fully, why not do it?

09:37.310 --> 09:40.010
For which you don’t have to pay.

09:40.010 --> 09:43.620
You can’t pay; it’s an evolutionary process.

09:43.620 --> 09:45.470
It’s a living process!

09:45.470 --> 09:51.910
For example, how much do we pay for these
flowers to Mother Earth?

09:51.910 --> 09:54.440
Who’s done the job?

09:54.440 --> 10:08.699
It’s built-in in a seed, to germinate and
built-in in the Mother Land that it will germinate.

10:08.699 --> 10:09.820
We don’t pay for that.

10:09.820 --> 10:11.060
It’s already built-in there.

10:11.060 --> 10:15.510
In the same way if it is built-in within you,
you can’t pay for it.

10:15.510 --> 10:21.670
One thing, if you realize that you can’t
pay for your evolutionary process, for anything

10:21.670 --> 10:30.810
that is Divinity, for anything that is pure;
half of the problems will be solved of this

10:30.810 --> 10:35.680
guru shopping that you have been doing all
these days.

10:35.680 --> 10:43.360
Because if you are not going to pay for it,
and these people are asking for money, that

10:43.360 --> 10:44.990
means something wrong with them!

10:44.990 --> 10:47.000
You cannot market it!

10:47.000 --> 10:59.050
Thus, we reach a point where we realize that
something spontaneous living process has to

10:59.050 --> 11:00.400
take place.

11:00.400 --> 11:09.800
And that has become very, very easy in modern
times.

11:09.800 --> 11:15.550
Because it is described already, prophesized
in the Bible, it is the Last Judgment and

11:15.550 --> 11:19.830
otherwise in the Koran it is “Qiyamah”,
means the Resurrection.

11:19.830 --> 11:25.260
Even in Indian scriptures they have described
about these special times when people who

11:25.260 --> 11:33.190
will get so much disillusioned in the illusion,
they will be born and they will be disillusioned

11:33.190 --> 11:36.480
that they take to reality, and this thing
will happen.

11:36.480 --> 11:45.089
It’s already predicted and this is the time,
such a fortunate time when we are all born.

11:45.089 --> 11:48.040
And it has to work out.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.730
It is your own power.

11:49.730 --> 11:58.700
It’s your own Mother, it’s your individual
Mother, and She knows everything about you.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.560
It’s all tape-recorded.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.670
And She is anxious to give you this Second
Birth.

12:03.670 --> 12:05.890
She is anxious.

12:05.890 --> 12:07.670
And She does it very beautifully.

12:07.670 --> 12:14.240
I’ve read some books which says that Kundalini
Awakening is very dangerous and all that.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.240
I can’t understand!

12:15.240 --> 12:17.589
It has never happened before like that.

12:17.589 --> 12:24.149
I’ve been working like this for the last,
I think, I don’t know how many years now;

12:24.149 --> 12:30.630
at least twenty-five years and I’ve never
seen anybody being harmed.

12:30.630 --> 12:34.460
On the contrary, everybody’s helped; physically,
mentally, emotionally.

12:34.460 --> 12:48.210
Now there are three doctors who have got M.D.
in Delhi University for Sahaja Yoga, in various

12:48.210 --> 12:49.210
subjects.

12:49.210 --> 12:54.339
Now there’s a fourth doctor who is trying
on blood cancer and all that.

12:54.339 --> 12:58.980
For medical science, if you ask them who does
all these things they will say “autonomous

12:58.980 --> 13:00.400
nervous system”.

13:00.400 --> 13:05.750
But who is this “auto”, who is this “auto”
that does this work?

13:05.750 --> 13:09.840
They can’t answer; they’re honest; they
can’t answer.

13:09.840 --> 13:18.610
So this autonomous nervous system, which is
parasympathetic and sympathetic, the parasympathetic

13:18.610 --> 13:25.280
nervous system will take over and we can control
our parasympathetic through this.

13:25.280 --> 13:33.720
Of course, I don’t know how far the doctors
here are sensitive to a subject like that

13:33.720 --> 13:36.070
but in Russia I was surprised.

13:36.070 --> 13:41.360
There are two hundred doctors who are practicing
Sahaja Yoga in Russia.

13:41.360 --> 13:46.980
Russian people are not so materialistic because
they have never known materialism much.

13:46.980 --> 13:49.680
About 30% of them are funny type.

13:49.680 --> 13:56.080
They’ll ask for Marlboro cigarettes but
70% are so sensitive to Sahaja Yoga.

13:56.080 --> 14:02.240
I was amazed the way they took to me and threw
away all absurd gurus from them.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.170
Not one person could prosper.

14:04.170 --> 14:11.190
And no religion is allowed to be practiced
there where they have now started taking to

14:11.190 --> 14:12.190
Sahaja Yoga.

14:12.190 --> 14:19.410
It’s very amazing how these people who don’t
know even English, who don’t know about

14:19.410 --> 14:25.520
God; they were not supposed to know about
any religion, they’re so clean, like a clean

14:25.520 --> 14:31.080
slate and they have taken to Sahaja in such
a big manner; I’m surprised.

14:31.080 --> 14:38.510
In thousands and thousands of people, so sensitive,
so open-minded and scientifically so equipped.

14:38.510 --> 14:45.210
There were 300 scientists, I think maybe more,
who invited me.

14:45.210 --> 14:50.050
Started telling them about I…I thought,
better start from science.

14:50.050 --> 14:53.070
So they said, “Mother, no, don’t tell
us science; we know everything about science.

14:53.070 --> 14:55.810
No we don’t, You tell us the science of
God.”

14:55.810 --> 15:05.220
Such eager, intelligent, educated people.

15:05.220 --> 15:11.930
Now, this democracy of ours ‘so-called’,
today also in the newspaper.

15:11.930 --> 15:16.220
I read the same thing: “so-called democracy”.

15:16.220 --> 15:21.670
Because it looks sometimes like a demonocracy
you see, like you go to America; you can’t

15:21.670 --> 15:24.840
even wear your wedding ring.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.710
They might take away your wedding ring also
and kill you for that.

15:28.710 --> 15:32.850
That’s supposed to be democracy!

15:32.850 --> 15:35.330
You have to be extremely careful.

15:35.330 --> 15:36.810
I was surprised in Perth.

15:36.810 --> 15:41.470
We were going in the night for about thirty-five
kilometres.

15:41.470 --> 15:44.110
No gangsterism on the way, I was surprised.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.390
How this country is still saved.

15:47.390 --> 15:53.820
But it happens that this kind of democracy
without being in connection with that all-pervading

15:53.820 --> 15:57.370
power can take you to anything.

15:57.370 --> 15:59.529
Same with religions.

15:59.529 --> 16:04.630
You take any religion, whether you are Hindu,
Christian, Muslim, anything.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.620
One can commit any sin.

16:06.620 --> 16:12.510
What’s the use of denouncing others; everybody
does the same I thing; no difference.

16:12.510 --> 16:24.400
All are only convinced they are something
excellent but they are not, in no way!

16:24.400 --> 16:31.190
And so many things like this, when we start
seeing, we get disillusioned and we start

16:31.190 --> 16:37.690
thinking, “Where is the truth, where is
the reality, what are we doing?”

16:37.690 --> 16:43.709
At this time, I see; I call them ‘the seekers
of truth’.

16:43.709 --> 16:55.190
These are special category of people, as described
by so many poets.

16:55.190 --> 17:07.010
And when it works out, they are the ones who
jump into themselves.

17:07.010 --> 17:12.669
Jump into this beautiful era, of what we call
the New Age.

17:12.669 --> 17:13.940
It’s a happening.

17:13.940 --> 17:18.740
It’s not just branding yourself New Age;
somebody calls themselves by some other name,

17:18.740 --> 17:20.360
it’s not that.

17:20.360 --> 17:23.589
It’s another Christian, Hindu, Muslim branding.

17:23.589 --> 17:30.290
But something that has to happen and that
happening is awakening of the kundalini.

17:30.290 --> 17:38.010
William Blake has said that men of God will
be born in those days, men of God.

17:38.010 --> 17:42.110
And they will become divine and they will
have powers to make others divine, exactly

17:42.110 --> 17:49.610
that is Sahaja Yoga.

17:49.610 --> 18:00.880
Moreover it’s such an internal happening
that, all outside things are not needed.

18:00.880 --> 18:06.429
For example, some people go to Himalayas,
stand on their heads.

18:06.429 --> 18:11.320
Or they starve themselves, fast, do all kinds
of things.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.320
And they find nothing.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.799
They can’t understand how it happens.

18:14.799 --> 18:21.960
They go on telling me; Mother we did this,
we did that and we never found anything within

18:21.960 --> 18:23.840
ourselves.

18:23.840 --> 18:32.190
So first you are to be connected to that all
pervading power, this is the power that’s

18:32.190 --> 18:38.980
extremely dynamic no doubt, but it’s the
power of compassion.

18:38.980 --> 18:40.840
So you also become very dynamic.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.040
I know poor people becoming very rich suddenly.

18:43.040 --> 18:47.909
I have seen people who are sick becoming all
right.

18:47.909 --> 18:55.940
We have a very nice place in Perth, where
a boy who was already married, had children,

18:55.940 --> 18:57.119
two children.

18:57.119 --> 19:03.940
He was in an accident and whole his brain
as if came out; a terrible condition.

19:03.940 --> 19:07.419
And doctors gave it up that he will die.

19:07.419 --> 19:11.779
Not that he was saved, but he is absolutely
normal now.

19:11.779 --> 19:19.289
I was in tears to see him so beautifully cured.

19:19.289 --> 19:31.669
So this all-pervading power, which is the
Ocean of Bliss, Ocean of Knowledge, Ocean

19:31.669 --> 19:39.889
of Compassion, is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

19:39.889 --> 19:43.549
This power starts flowing through you.

19:43.549 --> 19:47.640
You become a vehicle of that power.

19:47.640 --> 19:57.330
And once you learn how to make others the
same way, how to raise their kundalini, you

19:57.330 --> 20:00.929
can create thousands of people who are self-realized.

20:00.929 --> 20:09.239
Surprisingly, in Australia many children are
born who are realized souls, very surprising.

20:09.239 --> 20:16.880
Maybe because in other European countries
children are killed by the parents.

20:16.880 --> 20:21.259
So maybe they are taking to you people who
are kind to children and your government is

20:21.259 --> 20:23.830
also very kind to them.

20:23.830 --> 20:33.830
And these children are not understood by parents
sometimes because they’re very different.

20:33.830 --> 20:36.779
And they are very moral.

20:36.779 --> 20:44.640
So all the problems that we have created out
of our ideas of sort of modernism or any kind

20:44.640 --> 20:46.159
of thing.

20:46.159 --> 20:54.360
And that we see that our children are going
to dogs is all stopped through this awakening.

20:54.360 --> 21:03.299
It’s like this, that if I tell some children
don’t take to drugs, they’ll never listen

21:03.299 --> 21:05.100
to me.

21:05.100 --> 21:11.330
If, supposing I’m carrying a snake in my
hand and there’s darkness all over, I can’t

21:11.330 --> 21:14.869
see anything and somebody says, “you have
a snake in your hand”, I’ll never give

21:14.869 --> 21:17.720
up if I’m very obstinate, I will never give
up.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.760
I’ll say, “No, it’s just a rope.”

21:19.760 --> 21:26.379
But when there’s little light I will myself
give it up.

21:26.379 --> 21:32.120
In the same way it happens; it works this
way that you yourself become powerful.

21:32.120 --> 21:41.019
Throw away all that is destructive, all that
is to be given up.

21:41.019 --> 21:45.390
I don’t have to say “Don’t do this;
the Ten Commandments we don’t talk about

21:45.390 --> 21:50.379
in Sahaja Yoga, but only in you, the religion
is born.

21:50.379 --> 21:56.359
The innate religion, which keeps you religious,
righteous, compassionate and dynamic.

21:56.359 --> 22:01.691
You don’t have to change your dress, you
don’t have to change your lifestyle, you

22:01.691 --> 22:06.840
don’t have to give up your wives and children,
but you get it just where you are.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.869
It’s so simple, made so simple.

22:10.869 --> 22:16.019
I would say, if you are hungry, you can have
it.

22:16.019 --> 22:22.049
Like, if I’ve done the cooking, and if you
are hungry and you will say otherwise “mother

22:22.049 --> 22:23.229
just lets have the food.”

22:23.229 --> 22:27.440
But if you are not, then you will go on discussing,
arguing, this, that.

22:27.440 --> 22:31.549
These are all mental feats.

22:31.549 --> 22:36.519
I mean if you want to ask me a question, you
can ask me any number and I am quite an expert

22:36.519 --> 22:43.860
now 25 years I have been facing all of you
and I can answer you, but its all a mental

22:43.860 --> 22:44.860
feat.

22:44.860 --> 22:46.240
It doesn’t give you realization.

22:46.240 --> 22:51.679
You are here for your realization, by which
you are helped so much that physically, mentally,

22:51.679 --> 22:57.809
emotionally, and spiritually you become all
right.

22:57.809 --> 23:04.229
Firstly, you become peaceful, absolutely peaceful.

23:04.229 --> 23:06.590
The peace within you, you achieve.

23:06.590 --> 23:08.000
How?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.299
You live with your thoughts.

23:10.299 --> 23:17.779
The thoughts rise, fall, rise, fall and in
between these thoughts, there’s a little

23:17.779 --> 23:18.789
space.

23:18.789 --> 23:22.859
Mostly, you are thinking about the future
or the past.

23:22.859 --> 23:27.269
You cannot be in the present.

23:27.269 --> 23:29.309
In the present, there is no thought.

23:29.309 --> 23:31.840
You are with reality.

23:31.840 --> 23:36.510
So when the kundalini rises, these thoughts
elongate and the space in between, of the

23:36.510 --> 23:39.710
present is established.

23:39.710 --> 23:48.029
When that space is established, you become
peaceful, absolutely peaceful within yourself.

23:48.029 --> 24:00.220
I have met many people, elite people, I should
say, very elite, who have got Peace Prizes.

24:00.220 --> 24:06.759
They’re so hot-tempered people, I tell you,
that you have to touch them with a barge pole.

24:06.759 --> 24:08.679
I mean you cannot go near them.

24:08.679 --> 24:13.440
It is horribly hot-tempered people, and they
have got peace awards I don’t know how.

24:13.440 --> 24:14.440
No peace within.

24:14.440 --> 24:17.600
At the slightest thing, they just shoot off.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.640
No patience, nothing.

24:19.640 --> 24:28.429
And then I realize that it’s so outside;
the whole thing is.

24:28.429 --> 24:34.049
They don’t understand if you don’t have
peace within, how can have a Peace Award?

24:34.049 --> 24:36.049
Well you can.

24:36.049 --> 24:38.919
That is our life.

24:38.919 --> 24:45.260
Now this peace is established within you and
you become, it’s a new dimension of existence,

24:45.260 --> 24:46.770
where you become “thoughtlessly aware”.

24:46.770 --> 24:50.230
You are absolutely aware, but no thoughts.

24:50.230 --> 24:51.880
Just in peace.

24:51.880 --> 25:02.940
But you are aware; you are not fainted down
or you are not in some sort of a trance.

25:02.940 --> 25:12.450
You are absolutely aware and very much more
aware because, you are in Reality.

25:12.450 --> 25:17.259
Then the second dimension you achieve is that
you start feeling on your fingertips this

25:17.259 --> 25:20.720
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.769
Sometimes you feel it hot, also.

25:22.769 --> 25:30.259
On these fingertips are your sympathetic centres.

25:30.259 --> 25:35.559
And these Sympathetic Centres are from left
and right.

25:35.559 --> 25:39.779
They join together to make the Parasympathetic.

25:39.779 --> 25:47.240
So we have the left side and the right side
within us, and these left and right side,

25:47.240 --> 25:49.940
indicates on our right and left side.

25:49.940 --> 25:56.849
On the left side we get our emotional and
the right side our mental.

25:56.849 --> 26:01.720
I mean English Language, “mental” means
something different, but I mean whatever we

26:01.720 --> 26:03.749
do with our brain.

26:03.749 --> 26:10.629
And also you receive your physical problems
on the right hand side.

26:10.629 --> 26:14.529
These problems are indicative on your fingertips.

26:14.529 --> 26:23.739
Said it by Hazrat Mohammed that at the time
of Qiyamah your hands will speak and will

26:23.739 --> 26:28.190
give witness against you; means they will
tell you what’s wrong with you.

26:28.190 --> 26:33.539
But not only that; they also tell you what’s
wrong with others.

26:33.539 --> 26:40.399
Now somehow if you know how to correct these
centres, you’re all right, and correct the

26:40.399 --> 26:44.929
centres of others you can also make them all
right.

26:44.929 --> 26:49.230
It’s so simple, it’s all within you, all
the mechanism is within you.

26:49.230 --> 26:50.940
It’s all there.

26:50.940 --> 26:55.139
Only thing you have to understand the importance
of it.

26:55.139 --> 26:57.419
Without that you can never be happy.

26:57.419 --> 27:01.529
This power, which is there, is the power of
pure desire.

27:01.529 --> 27:06.210
All other desires are not pure.

27:06.210 --> 27:09.340
Today we want to have say; some flowers.

27:09.340 --> 27:12.730
Tomorrow we want to have a house; the day
after tomorrow we want to have helicopter.

27:12.730 --> 27:16.120
I don’t know; we go on and on.

27:16.120 --> 27:21.080
So every desire, which is fulfilled, is never
satisfied!

27:21.080 --> 27:22.320
Once we get it, it’s finished.

27:22.320 --> 27:28.279
Then again of course, it’s a law of economics
also, that in general, wants are not satiable.

27:28.279 --> 27:29.749
It’s a fact.

27:29.749 --> 27:33.549
But this desire, whether you know it or not,
is within you.

27:33.549 --> 27:39.580
Whether you are aware of it or not, is the
desire to be one with this all-pervading power.

27:39.580 --> 27:45.320
And all the powers that you have within you
start manifesting.

27:45.320 --> 27:51.230
You have no idea at all what powers you have.

27:51.230 --> 27:56.759
I always say about a television taken to a
very remote village in India where they have

27:56.759 --> 27:59.029
never seen electricity.

27:59.029 --> 28:03.820
And if you tell them that in this box you
can see some films, they’ll say, “What,

28:03.820 --> 28:05.740
this is just a box!

28:05.740 --> 28:07.309
What are you telling us stories?”

28:07.309 --> 28:12.259
We also feel we are just a box, nothing more
than a box.

28:12.259 --> 28:15.389
But do you know what powers you have within
yourself?

28:15.389 --> 28:18.590
What you can do for this world?

28:18.590 --> 28:23.549
What can you do for yourself, to your family,
to your children?

28:23.549 --> 28:33.109
How you can really be a great force of reforms
and transformation without troubling anybody?

28:33.109 --> 28:38.119
Because, after this you know the absolute
truth.

28:38.119 --> 28:40.869
You know them on your fingertips.

28:40.869 --> 28:46.759
If a man from India comes from the jail, he’ll
directly come either to Australia or he will

28:46.759 --> 28:55.350
go to America, wear a dress of a what you
call this saddhu baba dress in saffron colour,

28:55.350 --> 28:59.169
and go and sit in any place and become a big
guru.

28:59.169 --> 29:01.929
Earn a lot of money.

29:01.929 --> 29:11.090
How will you know if this fellow has been
to jail, or is he a real person or not?

29:11.090 --> 29:17.369
So on your fingertips you can find out the
absolute truth.

29:17.369 --> 29:27.620
A new dimension in you, that on your fingertips
you know not only your centres, but the centres

29:27.620 --> 29:28.679
of others.

29:28.679 --> 29:32.590
Everybody feels the same way, knows the same
way.

29:32.590 --> 29:37.510
Then where is the quarrel, where is the argument,
where is the war?

29:37.510 --> 29:44.490
Now we have in India sometimes, people coming
from sixty nations because Sahaja Yoga is

29:44.490 --> 29:46.020
now practised in sixty nations.

29:46.020 --> 29:50.370
I’ve never seen them quarrelling, fighting,
of course they pull each other’s leg and

29:50.370 --> 29:57.200
have a little humor about it, but never have
I seen fighting, never!

29:57.200 --> 30:00.080
No question, no question of argument.

30:00.080 --> 30:05.529
Because, you do not know the absolute truth,
so somebody says that Christianity is good,

30:05.529 --> 30:11.559
somebody says this Islam is good, somebody
says that is good or democracy is good, or

30:11.559 --> 30:12.720
communism is good.

30:12.720 --> 30:13.720
How?

30:13.720 --> 30:18.119
How do you know that?

30:18.119 --> 30:23.009
Because you have got yarn in your heads, and
that’s how you’re formed your own ideas

30:23.009 --> 30:25.720
and you’re all fighting with each other.

30:25.720 --> 30:28.529
It’s all mental, which is all limited.

30:28.529 --> 30:34.909
But, with this, you know the Absolute and
is tangible.

30:34.909 --> 30:36.549
You can diagnose people.

30:36.549 --> 30:46.619
One fellow went to Huston and he said “Mother,
I was half dead with diagnosis only.

30:46.619 --> 30:49.429
But I said, “You don’t have to do anything
in Sahaja Yoga like that.

30:49.429 --> 30:52.460
You can diagnose about yourself, you can diagnose
about others.

30:52.460 --> 30:56.629
There’s no need to go through all that.

30:56.629 --> 31:01.919
This is what it is that you have to have your
own powers manifesting.

31:01.919 --> 31:05.669
And you must have the full knowledge about
it.

31:05.669 --> 31:09.279
It should not be half way.

31:09.279 --> 31:17.250
Your attention becomes extremely innocent
and powerful.

31:17.250 --> 31:23.219
The attention, when it is diverted everywhere;
you see you get confused and people get schizophrenia,

31:23.219 --> 31:24.219
this, that; all that.

31:24.219 --> 31:33.289
But here the attention is very innocent and
such a person, even if he radiates or even

31:33.289 --> 31:41.320
if he looks at or glances at somebody; he
can give peace; he can give redemption; he

31:41.320 --> 31:47.719
can do so many things, he can do, because
his attention has become enlightened.

31:47.719 --> 31:51.649
Sitting down here you can know about anybody
you want to know.

31:51.649 --> 31:57.159
You can know about the people who are dead,
or the people who are very far away.

31:57.159 --> 32:04.799
You can find out sitting down.

32:04.799 --> 32:08.130
This is what we can call as “collective
consciousness”.

32:08.130 --> 32:14.399
A new dimension of consciousness comes to
you about which Jung has written, collective

32:14.399 --> 32:15.879
consciousness.

32:15.879 --> 32:19.019
So you develop this collective consciousness
within yourself.

32:19.019 --> 32:23.230
For that you don’t need any education, you
don’t need anything.

32:23.230 --> 32:24.230
Even villagers can do it.

32:24.230 --> 32:28.239
Even small little children can do it, because
they know this power.

32:28.239 --> 32:33.889
As all of us have the power to see something,
as you all can see me sitting down here, in

32:33.889 --> 32:44.419
the same way you can know about others; know
about yourself; without doing any acrobats.

32:44.419 --> 32:50.249
So simple as that, all these powers are your.

32:50.249 --> 32:56.710
But above all, you jump in the Sea Of Joy.

32:56.710 --> 33:03.899
The whole problem is taken over by this all-pervading
power of God.

33:03.899 --> 33:06.230
We say we leave it to God, all right, leave
it to God.

33:06.230 --> 33:07.769
But you are not connected.

33:07.769 --> 33:11.320
When we pray also we are not connected.

33:11.320 --> 33:16.809
You know a telephone, which is not connected,
you go on moving it, it will get spoiled but

33:16.809 --> 33:18.450
you are not connected.

33:18.450 --> 33:25.539
After realization, even to, just a problem
comes to you and it gets solved, because you

33:25.539 --> 33:30.259
get out of your problem and you can see it
clearly and the Divine helps you.

33:30.259 --> 33:37.779
There have been so many blissful miracles
of Sahaja Yogis that now we have given up.

33:37.779 --> 33:42.211
We wanted to print them, but in one month
they became so much high and we didn’t know

33:42.211 --> 33:43.399
what to do.

33:43.399 --> 33:51.780
So, all over we have to not believe in God,
but you have to feel the bliss of God; how

33:51.780 --> 33:54.169
He looks after you.

33:54.169 --> 34:00.369
It’s not just a talk or a sermon, but it’s
a happening and the happening has to take

34:00.369 --> 34:05.340
place; otherwise our attention, which is outside,
will not be taken inside.

34:05.340 --> 34:11.589
It’s a question of understanding our own
value, respecting ourselves.

34:11.589 --> 34:13.839
And it works.

34:13.839 --> 34:16.649
As you all are here I know you are all seekers.

34:16.649 --> 34:18.950
Otherwise you would not be here.

34:18.950 --> 34:22.649
And it is your right to get this realization.

34:22.649 --> 34:27.440
Sahaja means “born”: ‘sah’ is with
you; ‘jah’ is “born”.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.359
“With you” is “born”.

34:29.359 --> 34:34.369
This right to get to this yoga, means the
union with the Divine.

34:34.369 --> 34:39.860
And is your right and you should assert and
all those who will ask for it have to have

34:39.860 --> 34:40.860
it.

34:40.860 --> 34:42.050
It is their right.

34:42.050 --> 34:45.470
The whole thing has built in our evolutionary
process.

34:45.470 --> 34:52.649
And now, the last bit has to happen and it
will work out.

34:52.649 --> 34:57.070
I have to tell you one thing more; that it
is not an individual happening.

34:57.070 --> 34:59.400
It’s a collective happening.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.910
It works better when there are many people.

35:02.910 --> 35:08.460
Also when you have to know about it, learn
about it, take advantage of it, you have to

35:08.460 --> 35:09.619
come to the collective.

35:09.619 --> 35:15.060
It’s not like other organizations where
they have an introductory lecture and after

35:15.060 --> 35:16.700
that they start marketing it.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.609
You cannot market it.

35:18.609 --> 35:21.940
For definite, you cannot market it.

35:21.940 --> 35:23.590
It is divine love.

35:23.590 --> 35:27.460
And love you can never market.

35:27.460 --> 35:32.230
In the same way this is Divine Love; how can
you market it?

35:32.230 --> 35:38.390
So, if you have respect for yourself, if you
really love yourself, and you care for yourself,

35:38.390 --> 35:46.030
you are not self-centered because after all,
you are a human being; epitome of evolution.

35:46.030 --> 35:53.530
So, only thing you have to give some time
and come to the collective and progress in

35:53.530 --> 35:54.530
Sahaja Yoga.

35:54.530 --> 35:55.900
It’s not difficult at all.

35:55.900 --> 36:02.070
Nothing is to be done as I told you; it’s
not to stand on your head or anything.

36:02.070 --> 36:04.020
Just wherever you are, you’ll get it.

36:04.020 --> 36:06.280
It’s so simple.

36:06.280 --> 36:09.280
Because the time has come.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.140
And you are not obliged to me buying for anything.

36:12.140 --> 36:19.390
It’s just happening, happening all over
and happens to everyone.

36:19.390 --> 36:23.080
So I would request you to pay attention to
it.

36:23.080 --> 36:27.870
And once you get your realization, you should
really come to the collective because it would

36:27.870 --> 36:35.590
be like what Christ has described as sprouted,
seeds which were thrown somewhere and were

36:35.590 --> 36:40.050
lost, so you have to grow, and that growth
is important.

36:40.050 --> 36:45.640
Once it happens, if you have any concern for
your country, for yourself and for the world,

36:45.640 --> 36:49.220
you should try to keep to it and understand.

36:49.220 --> 36:51.680
It’s as simple as that.

36:51.680 --> 36:57.410
So the last thing as I told you, jump in the
ocean of joy.

36:57.410 --> 37:04.140
That is, when your ego is pampered you feel
happy and when the ego is punctured, you feel

37:04.140 --> 37:05.280
unhappy.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.340
It is joy, has no duality.

37:07.340 --> 37:10.770
It’s just a witness state in which you witness
everything like a drama.

37:10.770 --> 37:18.290
And you lose your age very much.

37:18.290 --> 37:22.000
You feel very dynamic; at the same time very
compassionate.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.870
As you know I’m seventy-one years of age
and I’m traveling practically every third

37:26.870 --> 37:27.870
day.

37:27.870 --> 37:28.870
And it’s all right.

37:28.870 --> 37:30.350
People said “Mother, don’t you feel you
are traveling too much?”

37:30.350 --> 37:32.730
I said, “I’m not traveling, I’m just
sitting everywhere.

37:32.730 --> 37:35.700
Where am I traveling?”

37:35.700 --> 37:38.200
In the same way, it happens to you.

37:38.200 --> 37:44.920
And the ageing and all that never comes into
your mind.

37:44.920 --> 37:49.470
You just live; live in the present.

37:49.470 --> 37:54.970
And you just enjoy life; enjoy the company
of all other realized souls.

37:54.970 --> 37:56.290
All over the world you have relations.

37:56.290 --> 38:01.890
Wherever you go they’ll be all there to
help you, to look after you.

38:01.890 --> 38:06.780
Something happens to one person, all over
the world they will try to help, the doctors

38:06.780 --> 38:14.770
will run to that place, people will pray,
and I mean they will see to it that the person

38:14.770 --> 38:15.770
is saved.

38:15.770 --> 38:22.640
It’s such a big family, such a beautiful
family into which I would request you to join.

38:22.640 --> 38:32.080
May God bless you!

38:32.080 --> 38:41.790
Now, I cannot force self realization, cannot
be done, because I respect your freedom.

38:41.790 --> 38:49.380
You are given freedom at a human level because
you have to ascent with your own, with your

38:49.380 --> 38:54.260
own desire, I cannot force on you anything.

38:54.260 --> 39:02.770
As you have to accept it that you want to
have it.

39:02.770 --> 39:07.810
I would request people who don’t want to
have it, they should leave the hall and leave

39:07.810 --> 39:13.450
others, but those who want to have it are
very welcome, and they can have it.

39:13.450 --> 39:19.220
Even the knowledge they can have it without
any difficulties.

39:19.220 --> 39:27.580
So all those who want to go away should leave
the hall, please, I will be very thankful,

39:27.580 --> 39:31.010
because it cannot work on people who do not
want it.

39:31.010 --> 39:35.960
On the contrary it doesn’t help others also
to have such people among you who don’t

39:35.960 --> 39:45.590
want to have it.

39:45.590 --> 39:55.440
It will take hardly ten minutes and I would
request you not to disturb others when we

39:55.440 --> 39:58.050
are in the process of it.

39:58.050 --> 40:04.850
Actually it happens spontaneously without
anything but as there are little problems

40:04.850 --> 40:10.760
on the centers, you have to nourish your centers
yourself as I’ll tell you, its very simple

40:10.760 --> 42:28.190
and will show you how we

42:28.190 --> 53:02.070
do it.

53:02.070 --> 01:14:08.810
[Self Realization]
