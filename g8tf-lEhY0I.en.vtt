WEBVTT

00:17.904 --> 00:28.180
Shri Hanuman puja. Pune (India), 31 March 1999.

04:58.524 --> 05:08.775
Today we are celebrating Jayanti (Birth Anniversary) of Hanumanji.

05:12.619 --> 05:20.405
What should we say about Hanumanji!

05:20.790 --> 05:28.607
He was so powerful and wise.

05:30.607 --> 05:36.436
He was equally devoted and dedicated.

05:39.226 --> 05:47.194
Generally such a powerful person becomes right sided.

05:47.623 --> 05:51.773
He considers Himself so dignified that

05:52.551 --> 05:59.053
He doesn't give any importance to anyone in His comparison.

06:00.683 --> 06:10.901
But Hanumanji is a special Deity.

06:11.852 --> 06:19.190
A special deity full of qualities that as much strong He was

06:19.390 --> 06:26.545
as much powerful He was as much was His devotion.

06:27.190 --> 06:30.130
An embodiment of balanced strength

06:30.155 --> 06:34.974
He had as much power, as He had devotion.

06:40.681 --> 06:51.072
How did He maintain this balance?

06:51.325 --> 06:56.781
And was steady in it  is worth understanding.

07:00.890 --> 07:05.230
In Sahaja yoga, when we are enlightened

07:05.617 --> 07:12.171
and in Sahaja yoga we get many powers

07:13.073 --> 07:17.528
simultaneously, we get balance.

07:21.046 --> 07:23.615
We love others.

07:25.462 --> 07:30.199
With love and with the help of the power of Love

07:30.302 --> 07:35.420
we get busy in our work and go on doing our work.

07:35.859 --> 07:39.544
In this way, Shree Hanumanji

07:39.815 --> 07:42.223
was very powerful.

07:42.427 --> 07:44.853
He had Divine powers

07:44.959 --> 07:48.585
He had NAVADHA (Special) powers.

07:49.379 --> 07:52.137
which are called GARIMA, LAGHUMA.

07:52.162 --> 07:54.762
He could become as big as He wanted to be

07:54.787 --> 07:57.101
or as minute as He wanted to be

07:57.189 --> 08:01.263
and as small as an atom.

08:02.490 --> 08:05.894
All these powers

08:06.727 --> 08:09.332
He got through His devotion.

08:10.065 --> 08:13.361
It means that devotion and power

08:13.418 --> 08:15.868
are both the same.

08:16.704 --> 08:19.602
He who has power

08:19.627 --> 08:23.776
and doesn't have devotion, becomes a Rakshasa (Demon).

08:24.699 --> 08:27.198
And He who has devotion

08:27.223 --> 08:30.945
but doesn't have power, becomes mad.

08:32.654 --> 08:36.660
Between both these, he who is in the central path

08:41.347 --> 08:49.412
attains this state which you may call power, or devotion.

08:49.511 --> 08:53.900
Each part of his body is made of that.

08:56.352 --> 09:03.352
Because of His this special feature today we worship Bajrang Bali

09:03.745 --> 09:10.218
in our motherland as well as in foreign countries.

09:10.624 --> 09:12.639
I am so surprised

09:12.834 --> 09:16.714
that the young boys, children of foreign countries,

09:16.865 --> 09:19.583
when they draw any picture

09:19.608 --> 09:24.438
first of all they draw Hanumanji’s picture.

09:25.780 --> 09:28.459
Next, His special quality

09:28.497 --> 09:34.680
was that He was half man and half monkey.

09:36.538 --> 09:44.452
Means, it was a perfect combination of animal and human being.

09:45.040 --> 09:58.387
So within us, whatever we have lost  in our evolution

09:59.057 --> 10:08.183
in that, the element of love and attachment that was what he

10:08.687 --> 10:10.678
took with him.

10:12.912 --> 10:23.906
For example, you see that guru's enamored path is believed

10:23.931 --> 10:32.873
in which of guru's  which creatures are considered as attendants.

10:33.123 --> 10:35.783
That is why they consider dogs.

10:36.173 --> 10:38.760
A dog has that quality

10:38.888 --> 10:47.346
that like a guru's disciple is fully dedicated

10:47.952 --> 10:53.686
and has no other master except his guru

10:54.535 --> 10:58.526
and has no other thought.

10:58.765 --> 11:04.040
Every time,  he sacrifices his life for his master.

11:05.262 --> 11:08.922
In the same way, it should be understood that

11:09.112 --> 11:13.630
a creature who has been brought up in evolution

11:13.655 --> 11:16.726
when he comes in contact with a human being,

11:17.007 --> 11:21.555
what he learns, is full devotion.

11:22.346 --> 11:29.423
It means, devotion is innately born within us.

11:32.654 --> 11:40.355
The seed of devotion is beforehand completely sown within us.

11:41.258 --> 11:46.689
When we were not in this state, not in the human state

11:46.728 --> 11:51.414
the emergence of devotion was more at that time.

11:51.531 --> 11:56.000
Devotion set its roots deeply in us.

11:56.025 --> 11:59.214
Take an example of any animal.

12:00.035 --> 12:02.049
You get a little love from him,

12:02.074 --> 12:05.430
give him a little love, a little fondness for him

12:05.598 --> 12:11.107
he gets so close to you, gives his regard to you

12:11.696 --> 12:15.501
and in this way loves you.

12:15.966 --> 12:18.774
You must have heard about a horse too

12:18.974 --> 12:23.743
that when a horse's rider falls down

12:23.768 --> 12:28.684
or is about to die, he remains loyal to him.

12:36.384 --> 12:43.169
In the same way it is said about elephants.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.899
The elephants' determination too is terrific.

12:48.924 --> 12:55.975
They never put their master to any trouble

12:56.554 --> 13:09.144
and if a lion or any other animal attacks their master

13:09.169 --> 13:12.183
the elephant will better die while going on fighting

13:12.620 --> 13:15.560
but he will not allow his master to be touched.

13:15.818 --> 13:25.110
This relation of a master and superior and high-quality animals

13:26.776 --> 13:31.591
this relation is established within us beforehand.

13:33.060 --> 13:38.957
And along with this relationship we get that power as well.

13:39.195 --> 13:40.780
For example, I told you that

13:40.805 --> 13:43.499
the elephant will die while going on fighting in the battlefield.

13:43.524 --> 13:47.879
The elephant gets this power of fighting too

13:47.904 --> 13:51.306
because of his love and devotion.

13:55.832 --> 14:05.740
We say that Sahaj yoga is the work of love and Divine love is true.

14:05.986 --> 14:11.784
But while doing this work, that power is also inherent in it.

14:14.811 --> 14:19.397
We may or may not know it,

14:21.450 --> 14:26.186
we may or may not have any knowledge of that

14:26.413 --> 14:32.362
but that also is inherent in it, and that is Divine power.

14:35.192 --> 14:39.783
Man's bowing down before anyone

14:39.883 --> 14:45.249
to respect anyone, to consider anyone great

14:45.308 --> 14:48.545
all these are the indications of that.

14:48.887 --> 14:55.785
But when he respects his master, then within him

14:56.007 --> 14:58.907
there is importance to his master

14:58.932 --> 15:03.749
but along with that is his power as well.

15:04.176 --> 15:07.806
So, devotion and power are not two different things.

15:07.855 --> 15:10.522
They are just one and the same.

15:10.547 --> 15:14.890
We will say that if there is power in the right hand

15:14.915 --> 15:16.759
there is devotion in the left hand.

15:17.863 --> 15:20.529
This fusion of power and devotion

15:20.824 --> 15:25.700
has been described beautifully in Shree Hanumanji.

15:27.513 --> 15:31.445
On the one hand He went burn Ravan's Lanka

15:32.876 --> 15:38.206
and there only He prostrated before Sitaji.

15:39.512 --> 15:44.687
And when Sitaji said ''No, you are My son

15:44.783 --> 15:46.902
I will not come at the behest of My son.

15:46.927 --> 15:50.782
My husband will have to come and will have to destroy this man.

15:52.376 --> 15:58.755
When He will destroy him (Ravana), then I will go with Him."

15:58.996 --> 16:02.963
Hanumanji said, “That is okay!"

16:02.988 --> 16:05.727
He could have picked Her up like that only.

16:06.045 --> 16:09.375
He had such powers.

16:09.765 --> 16:17.665
But He said,"If Mother is saying so, it is okay."

16:17.898 --> 16:21.929
And after that, such a great war broke out.

16:21.954 --> 16:25.405
There was a need for that.

16:27.313 --> 16:30.441
Now there were special qualities of Shri Ram.

16:30.466 --> 16:33.794
Extremely powerful!

16:34.413 --> 16:38.218
And His aim would never go astray.

16:39.451 --> 16:44.461
You must have heard what He did in Sita Swayamvar.

16:44.486 --> 16:47.231
But the same Shri Ram

16:47.256 --> 16:52.867
when it was the case of Ravana

16:54.292 --> 16:56.481
He didn't give up.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.348
He killed Him.

17:01.001 --> 17:08.592
Tulsidas ji has given a beautiful description of this scene.

17:09.158 --> 17:15.141
Then Shri Ram was repeatedly hitting the arrows

17:17.378 --> 17:20.761
at Ravana's ten heads.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.500
The heads would fall down one by one but get back again,

17:23.525 --> 17:25.335
fall down and get back again.

17:28.601 --> 17:31.283
Then Laxman said ,"what are You doing?

17:31.649 --> 17:34.476
Shoot one arrow in His heart,

17:35.298 --> 17:38.394
the moment You will hit an arrow in His heart

17:38.419 --> 17:40.069
instantly He will die

17:40.094 --> 17:41.994
Otherwise, how can He die ?

17:42.019 --> 17:43.870
He cannot die."

17:44.956 --> 17:49.489
The arrow should hit His heart.

17:50.740 --> 17:54.695
There is a beautiful description of Shri Ram there.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.705
He was a shy person, very shy.

17:57.879 --> 18:05.043
Shri Ram, even though He was so powerful, so intense

18:06.587 --> 18:09.089
even though He was such a noble person

18:09.114 --> 18:12.310
He said, " You see the problem is that

18:12.335 --> 18:17.282
in Ravan's heart resides My Sita.

18:17.406 --> 18:19.800
So, I won't hit Him in his heart.

18:20.900 --> 18:24.745
But when his head will cut off repeatedly

18:24.770 --> 18:29.084
his attention will surely shift towards his head.

18:29.151 --> 18:32.996
At that time I will kill him with an arrow."

18:33.021 --> 18:34.983
Otherwise for Him, it would be said

18:35.008 --> 18:37.494
that he would kill a person just with one arrow.

18:37.519 --> 18:40.346
But now you see how delicate the matter is.

18:40.371 --> 18:46.875
Simply, it is a husband's love towards his wife.

18:48.079 --> 18:55.547
Even though being an ocean of power, what an amount of love He had!

18:57.617 --> 19:01.152
There are many instances of Hanumanji

19:01.901 --> 19:13.398
in which Hanumanji proved that He is ocean of love

19:13.574 --> 19:18.894
and at the same time, he who is evil minded

19:18.990 --> 19:24.773
he who bothers others, he who destroys others

19:25.220 --> 19:33.633
he doesn't hesitate in any way to kill him.

19:34.433 --> 19:42.533
As all this fact is about Hanuman's devotion

19:42.924 --> 19:48.239
the same is worth noticing about his power of strength.

19:51.009 --> 19:56.542
He knew that Ravana was afraid only of fire.

19:58.904 --> 20:01.970
So, He went to Lanka and set it on fire.

20:02.478 --> 20:08.879
This was His power that He put Lanka on fire.

20:09.759 --> 20:15.805
And in that fire, He didn't kill anyone, He did not burn anyone.

20:16.305 --> 20:18.948
Ravana also did not get burnt,  nobody got burnt

20:18.973 --> 20:21.989
but he got scared.

20:22.014 --> 20:26.795
People got scared, as to what crime Ravana is doing.

20:27.017 --> 20:32.540
People had given full consent about
the type of deeds Ravana was doing.

20:32.746 --> 20:38.411
They would say, "He is Ravana. it is his will.

20:38.759 --> 20:43.783
Whatever he wants to do, let him do. Who are we to question him?

20:44.363 --> 20:46.444
Ravana is after all Ravana."

20:47.909 --> 20:54.860
But it is worth noticing that when Lanka was on fire

20:54.885 --> 20:59.034
when Lanka was completely combusted

20:59.307 --> 21:06.187
people understood that it was a dangerous situation

21:07.162 --> 21:14.135
because Lanka was put on fire and we too could be burnt.

21:14.868 --> 21:18.800
The quality of fire is that it goes upwards, doesn't come downwards.

21:19.079 --> 21:22.488
Everybody was watching upwards that it was burning.

21:22.702 --> 21:27.975
Whole of Lanka was combusted but nobody got burnt.

21:30.392 --> 21:33.110
He did so to frighten them

21:33.135 --> 21:39.885
to make them understand that Ravana is committing a great sin.

21:40.692 --> 21:46.516
How much understanding and how much balanced was Bajrang Bali

21:46.541 --> 21:48.512
should be noted.

21:49.596 --> 21:52.612
The same we come across in History.

21:52.833 --> 21:59.675
All those who were very powerful had immense love.

22:00.396 --> 22:05.316
If you observe an example, there is an example of Shivaji Maharaj.

22:05.417 --> 22:12.562
He was as powerful as He was well behaved,

22:12.667 --> 22:19.502
very disciplined and very well balanced.

22:21.931 --> 22:26.991
When you get this balance, then you are a Sahaja Yogi.

22:27.767 --> 22:31.799
If you get the power, it doesn't mean

22:31.824 --> 22:39.868
that you in your love and your dealings you somehow give up.

22:40.863 --> 22:46.249
But you are powerful and its beauty is that

22:46.584 --> 22:52.383
those who are Schedule caste, poor and unhappy

22:52.408 --> 22:56.281
those who are victims, those who are facing disaster

22:56.306 --> 22:57.840
are secured.........

22:59.062 --> 23:03.474
And those who are troubling them

23:03.559 --> 23:08.946
those who are destroying, those who are bothering

23:09.095 --> 23:12.179
have created  problems for people

23:12.204 --> 23:15.401
to such people

23:15.880 --> 23:17.224
there is no need to do anything.

23:17.249 --> 23:19.530
You can set them right only with the help of bandhans.

23:22.131 --> 23:25.830
The powers that you have received inside your being

23:25.966 --> 23:29.140
it should be used for this very purpose

23:29.381 --> 23:35.879
so that the evil will be destroyed.

23:37.393 --> 23:40.399
But in your power there is no sword

23:40.694 --> 23:43.536
or mace in your hand like Hanumanji.

23:44.716 --> 23:50.507
Mace is not outwardly but it is inside.

23:52.178 --> 23:55.220
You watch your experiences

23:55.450 --> 24:02.546
that he who bothers or disturbs, he is attacked by a mace

24:03.831 --> 24:07.533
you may or may not pick a mace in your hand.

24:08.013 --> 24:12.276
In this way you yourself are safe by default

24:12.500 --> 24:15.065
your safety is  guaranteed

24:15.090 --> 24:31.522
but along with that your other sahaja yogis too are safe.

24:32.662 --> 24:37.461
Now in this Shri Bajrangbali has a great role to play.

24:37.486 --> 24:39.017
You don't know

24:39.042 --> 24:42.846
that he is standing in front of you as well as at your back.

24:48.092 --> 24:51.508
His nature is just like children

24:52.672 --> 24:58.849
Too pure and too simple

24:59.589 --> 25:04.008
but such wisdom

25:06.345 --> 25:09.889
and all types of virtues He knows.

25:11.355 --> 25:15.726
It means that along with His power

25:15.751 --> 25:25.567
He has a lot of absolute discretion- very wise.

25:26.427 --> 25:29.659
The wisdom of the present time is useless

25:29.792 --> 25:31.378
but the wisdom

25:31.403 --> 25:35.351
that will scrutinize and understand everything with love

25:37.895 --> 25:43.444
a special form of that wisdom

25:44.834 --> 25:51.003
was Shri Ganesha and is Shri Hanumana.

25:53.954 --> 25:59.594
The speciality of both of them is that

25:59.619 --> 26:09.011
Hanumanji is very strong, very quick deity

26:09.036 --> 26:13.710
and Shri Ganesha is very cool.

26:13.735 --> 26:23.216
But both are great destructors in times of need.

26:23.352 --> 26:26.983
For Sahaja Yogis there is no need of destruction.

26:27.190 --> 26:30.136
There is no need to destroy anyone.

26:30.303 --> 26:32.837
You just think

26:35.685 --> 26:41.443
that both of them are with you at every moment.

26:42.050 --> 26:46.209
Whenever anyone bothers you

26:46.552 --> 26:53.385
in reality, your protectors are standing with you.

26:54.182 --> 26:57.309
Many times, you must be noticing

26:57.363 --> 27:04.655
that ministers or anyone visits a place, security escorts them.

27:04.989 --> 27:10.631
Sahaja Yogis' security always escorts them.

27:12.999 --> 27:19.576
The other security with them is that of Ganas.

27:23.507 --> 27:26.767
Now their work is too diversified

27:26.792 --> 27:30.635
miscellaneous and little job work also.

27:31.646 --> 27:34.171
And these only

27:34.196 --> 27:41.080
give a message about you to Shri Ganesha who is Ganapati

27:41.106 --> 27:42.105
about what is going on?

27:42.130 --> 27:43.868
What wrong is going on and where?

27:43.893 --> 27:47.023
From where you are being attacked ?

27:47.048 --> 27:51.161
And from where you are troubled?

27:53.480 --> 27:55.136
you may not even be knowing.

27:55.161 --> 27:58.533
Somebody may like to attack you in an unknown form

27:59.557 --> 28:04.943
even then both these deities are standing with you

28:04.968 --> 28:10.425
and when Ganapati tells this

28:10.617 --> 28:14.093
Shri Hanuman gets ready.

28:14.229 --> 28:18.005
Sahaja Yogis need not be afraid of anything.

28:18.203 --> 28:20.847
No need to be afraid of anything

28:20.872 --> 28:22.817
Right now I am going to tell you a Story.

28:22.842 --> 28:24.932
It is so amazing.

28:24.957 --> 28:37.023
You must have heard that America exploded a lot of bombs everywhere

28:37.990 --> 28:46.158
thinking that terrorists have made some arrangements.

28:47.325 --> 28:53.941
The story I am going to tell you is about a place in Africa.

28:54.164 --> 28:59.295
Here were some Sahaja Yogis and a bomb exploded there.

29:00.865 --> 29:05.596
Because of that bomb explosion, all the people died

29:05.621 --> 29:07.554
and Sahaja Yogis remained unhurt.

29:09.075 --> 29:10.107
They were so surprised.

29:10.132 --> 29:12.828
Even the dust did not touch them.

29:13.637 --> 29:17.859
They had never come to Cabella.

29:19.655 --> 29:22.384
They had never thought that they would ever come to Cabella.

29:22.409 --> 29:25.275
But when it took place, they came to Cabella.

29:25.818 --> 29:31.068
And after coming said,''Mother, don't know who saved us

29:31.618 --> 29:33.597
who protected us.''

29:33.966 --> 29:40.186
But all Sahaja Yogis were saved and the rest of the people died...

29:46.282 --> 29:50.308
Now it is an incident, it is true.

29:50.333 --> 29:57.884
And its reason is this that you have now recognized God.

29:57.909 --> 30:09.033
You have enlightened your soul in Sahaja Marga.

30:14.252 --> 30:24.330
With this new transformation

30:24.355 --> 30:36.083
you have become a great devotee and a powerful human being.

30:36.880 --> 30:40.801
Now it is not at all possible for anyone to touch you.

30:40.826 --> 30:44.696
I can give you hundreds of such examples

30:44.983 --> 30:48.091
that when you get your realization in Sahaja

30:50.346 --> 30:54.449
nobody can touch you.

30:56.198 --> 30:58.371
Previously also there were saints.

30:58.435 --> 31:01.959
All of them were tortured, victimized, everything happened.

31:02.513 --> 31:09.309
But in spite of being victimized or tortured, they didn't give up

31:09.334 --> 31:13.716
and not only this, they were always protected.

31:15.498 --> 31:20.928
And they would talk about such things
which would make people very angry.

31:20.959 --> 31:23.317
They would think, what are they talking

31:23.342 --> 31:28.141
against kings, against emperors and against everybody.

31:28.188 --> 31:32.364
They would talk about such things which would scare people

31:32.389 --> 31:37.423
but because of Hanumanji's powers, nobody could touch them.

31:38.175 --> 31:40.537
Nobody hit them.

31:40.791 --> 31:44.571
There is a nice story about Khwaja Nizzamudin Saheb.

31:45.017 --> 31:53.303
That his king told him to bow down before him ..[unclear]..

31:53.328 --> 31:54.664
He didn't bow down.

31:54.689 --> 31:58.695
He said, "No, I am not going to bow down before you. Who are you?''

31:59.404 --> 32:01.094
He was very angry.

32:01.119 --> 32:03.441
He said that if within three days

32:03.466 --> 32:06.670
you do not come and bow down before me

32:06.695 --> 32:09.360
I will get your neck cut off''.

32:09.443 --> 32:11.132
He said,'' Ok, get it cut off!

32:11.157 --> 32:12.592
I won't

32:12.617 --> 32:16.922
because you are not a great saint that i will bow down before you.''

32:19.284 --> 32:25.798
Then he came and raised a great commotion

32:25.823 --> 32:30.563
that after three days this man's neck is to be cut off.

32:30.612 --> 32:33.894
The day his neck was going to be cut off

32:33.919 --> 32:38.093
that night only, this King's neck got cut off, nobody knows how?

32:41.613 --> 32:47.861
If this would not have been in history, those who were great saints

32:47.886 --> 32:53.958
those who were great followers of dharma, would have been no more.

32:54.764 --> 33:01.054
Because Rakshas's ways are so powerful and violent

33:01.445 --> 33:09.084
and are so comprehensive that
they would have surely put an end to them.

33:09.735 --> 33:16.519
But behind them is God.

33:16.980 --> 33:23.181
And God is on one side Hanuman and on another side Ganesha.

33:23.329 --> 33:26.442
He is made of these two powers together.

33:27.226 --> 33:31.775
He is a protector, He takes care.

33:33.062 --> 33:38.119
There is a story of Rana Pratap of Mewar

33:38.932 --> 33:41.827
that when he went to fight a war,

33:43.115 --> 33:49.022
his soldiers thought that he was going to be defeated.

33:49.047 --> 33:49.880
So, they told him

33:49.905 --> 33:51.372
''You return back

33:52.917 --> 33:54.716
because we want that your life should be saved

33:54.741 --> 33:56.040
for the sake of Mewar."

33:56.462 --> 33:57.761
He didn't listen.

33:57.909 --> 34:00.220
He said,"All of you better go back.

34:00.245 --> 34:02.923
I will stay put like this

34:02.948 --> 34:05.939
because the Ganas are standing with me."

34:06.498 --> 34:07.989
He too was a Sahaja Yogi.

34:09.228 --> 34:11.141
"If you want to go, you go.

34:11.166 --> 34:13.129
I will stay here like this, only

34:13.345 --> 34:15.973
because the Ganas are with me."

34:16.396 --> 34:19.212
Just understand that

34:19.304 --> 34:23.891
you have every type of protection in your front and back.

34:31.675 --> 34:34.918
But just on getting this protection

34:35.780 --> 34:39.749
what should a man have? What should a Sahaja Yogi have?

34:40.041 --> 34:46.325
A very serious and determined person, and not afraid of anyone.

34:51.509 --> 34:55.121
He doesn't run away from anyone.

34:56.269 --> 35:00.222
He sticks at that place

35:01.289 --> 35:11.406
and those who are evil persons,in front of him.

35:16.039 --> 35:19.066
He doesn't need to do anything.

35:21.199 --> 35:23.123
That period is over.

35:23.148 --> 35:26.908
Now you just stand at a place and the other person will run away.

35:26.932 --> 35:29.018
He won't come to know what happened.

35:30.011 --> 35:34.436
Sahaja Yogis write and send about many such experiences

35:34.461 --> 35:38.885
that happened like this and that.

35:38.910 --> 35:43.429
Otherwise in the presence of these foreigners

35:43.454 --> 35:47.196
it is not so easy to spread Sahaja Yoga.

35:48.335 --> 35:51.572
And since Sahaja Yoga has started spreading among Muslims too

35:51.597 --> 35:53.924
you can understand that

35:53.949 --> 35:57.553
that this Divine power which is the power of love,

35:57.578 --> 35:59.856
how much strength it has within it

36:01.658 --> 36:05.461
and how many tasks can be done with the help of it.

36:06.119 --> 36:08.069
But it doesn't mean that

36:08.416 --> 36:19.188
you make any harassment in the name of Hanumanji.

36:19.452 --> 36:21.947
It doesn't at all mean that.

36:22.261 --> 36:24.104
For example nowadays, there are such (organizations)

36:24.196 --> 36:27.174
which  take the name of Hanumanji, take the name of Ganesh ji

36:27.246 --> 36:33.299
or of Mahadevji and make such organizations.

36:34.162 --> 36:36.915
There is no need of making any organization.

36:37.508 --> 36:40.704
You yourself are an organization.

36:40.729 --> 36:43.830
Neither anybody can touch you

36:46.308 --> 36:49.271
nor, anyone can destroy you.

36:51.362 --> 36:55.654
First, it is a matter of understanding one's own self

36:55.775 --> 36:58.418
which has been said in all scriptures

36:59.035 --> 37:03.998
that Atmasakhshatkar means to know oneself.

37:04.207 --> 37:06.557
What does it mean to know oneself?

37:08.217 --> 37:15.341
To know means to know who is in front of you and who is behind you.

37:16.051 --> 37:18.772
Who is your protector?

37:19.134 --> 37:24.492
And the love and affection you have for people

37:24.517 --> 37:30.899
and those who always think how to please others

37:30.924 --> 37:34.299
For example (NOT CLEAR)

37:34.324 --> 37:36.835
that i will make the whole world happy.

37:36.860 --> 37:39.269
I will fill everyone's heart with joy.

37:39.294 --> 37:41.447
This thought that comes in your mind

37:41.472 --> 37:47.524
you should understand that there is nobody who can harm you.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.006
Have courage!

37:50.446 --> 37:52.377
Nobody will destroy you.

37:52.402 --> 37:55.064
And for that you don't have to do anything.

37:58.791 --> 38:03.774
For that you don't need to keep any sword

38:04.064 --> 38:06.358
no need to have a mace

38:06.399 --> 38:07.674
They are already there.

38:07.699 --> 38:09.783
They have already come, well prepared.

38:10.143 --> 38:12.853
And they are settled in you.

38:13.799 --> 38:21.404
You don't need to make yourself strong. You are already so.

38:24.741 --> 38:29.454
There is a Chinese story, very interesting!

38:29.629 --> 38:33.788
In their country, cock fights are organized.

38:35.563 --> 38:39.336
When the cock fight was on, it so happened that

38:40.383 --> 38:46.311
somehow a king felt that he should go to a saint.

38:47.506 --> 38:54.545
Let the cocks learn from the saint, how to fight with the world.

38:55.072 --> 38:57.162
Because, this saint does not fight with anyone

38:57.187 --> 38:58.752
nor anyone touches him.

38:59.233 --> 39:01.173
People run away from him

39:01.198 --> 39:03.986
and salute him.

39:04.011 --> 39:07.943
So what is so special about him

39:08.078 --> 39:14.095
that he is living in this wicked world like this.

39:14.939 --> 39:18.940
The saint told him,''Ok! leave the cock here.''

39:19.683 --> 39:23.321
So, he went back, leaving one cock with him.

39:23.346 --> 39:26.325
He took back that cock after one month

39:26.710 --> 39:31.361
and put him where the cock fight was going on.

39:31.386 --> 39:33.489
There were a lot of cocks.

39:34.073 --> 39:37.067
He put him in such a courtyard.

39:37.577 --> 39:43.997
But this great cock kept standing.

39:44.774 --> 39:48.561
Now all the cocks were fighting among themselves.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.960
One after the other they left.

39:53.516 --> 39:55.799
Only this one cock kept standing.

39:57.607 --> 40:00.186
Everybody started getting scared of him
and he is not reacting at all.

40:00.211 --> 40:02.473
Is he somewhat special?

40:04.125 --> 40:09.076
And at the end that one cock was saved who kept standing gracefully.

40:11.292 --> 40:14.213
So when we are doing the puja of Hanuman Ji here today

40:14.238 --> 40:19.181
we must think that Hanumanji has settled in reality within us.

40:20.975 --> 40:23.622
He is on our right side.

40:30.648 --> 40:33.057
That means He is working on our Pingala Nadi.

40:34.424 --> 40:40.574
He works on our Pingala Nadi and creates enthusiasm in us

40:42.048 --> 40:46.257
and that creates warmath in our body.

40:47.151 --> 40:49.121
But his path is such that

40:49.229 --> 40:53.144
along with warmath you feel devotion within you.

40:56.271 --> 40:59.327
So, the warmath that comes, the enthusiasm it creates

41:03.274 --> 41:07.045
that works inside us on our right side

41:07.549 --> 41:12.986
and when we do not absorb the balanced power of Hanumanji

41:13.011 --> 41:17.056
we get a lot of diseases.

41:17.228 --> 41:33.493
For example the liver problem, asthma

41:35.102 --> 41:37.763
and when its heat goes downwards

41:37.788 --> 41:40.670
Hanumanji controls this heat.

41:40.695 --> 41:46.079
But when the heat doesn't get controlled, such diseases attack

41:46.104 --> 41:48.337
which are incurable.

41:48.362 --> 41:50.735
It can cause blood cancer

41:50.760 --> 41:52.800
and there can be intestinal trouble

41:52.825 --> 41:55.072
which means all the troubles all over the world are

41:55.097 --> 41:57.781
caused just by the breakdown of the liver

41:57.806 --> 42:04.969
and the liver gets spoiled because we do not follow Hanumanji.

42:05.624 --> 42:09.059
There is no need to get angry.

42:10.709 --> 42:13.783
But getting angry and start hitting,

42:14.315 --> 42:19.725
beating this and that person to create panic,

42:20.018 --> 42:22.829
this is not Hanumanji's power.

42:24.760 --> 42:27.988
There is no question of getting angry.

42:30.457 --> 42:34.679
There is no question of getting angry about anyone.

42:34.704 --> 42:40.561
There is no need at all, if you respect Hanumanji.

42:40.722 --> 42:43.123
He is not angry with anyone

42:45.913 --> 42:49.791
But a human being gets angry over everything.

42:50.476 --> 42:52.846
He gets ego.

42:53.766 --> 42:55.807
Hanumanji didn't have ego at all.

42:55.832 --> 42:59.079
A right sided person is very egoistic.

43:00.259 --> 43:03.946
A human being has so much ego!

43:03.971 --> 43:07.899
I become restless when I see what they were egotistical.

43:09.137 --> 43:12.848
That ego doesn't have any meaning

43:12.873 --> 43:14.164
What does "I" mean?

43:16.327 --> 43:21.985
Even an ordinary human being becomes egoistic.

43:22.121 --> 43:25.538
And many Kings and emperors also are not egoistic.

43:26.474 --> 43:31.599
Its reason is that inside their being there is such a conditioning

43:31.720 --> 43:34.295
that they do not recognize Hanumanji.

43:35.561 --> 43:40.835
As soon as you recognize Hanuman Ji, you recognise Shri Ram.

43:43.155 --> 43:48.817
Now tell Me if you are right sided, you should not get Asthma

43:48.842 --> 43:50.678
because Shree Ram is settled

43:50.703 --> 43:53.437
according to Sahaja Yoga in our right heart.

43:55.573 --> 43:58.419
Because you do not recognize Hanumanji

43:58.555 --> 44:03.419
your behaviour and your balance is not like His

44:03.444 --> 44:06.808
that is why you get Asthma as well.

44:09.140 --> 44:16.947
Shivji's place is in your heart,  there also is the same fuss

44:17.154 --> 44:22.443
and you can get a heart attack or you can have some other diseases.

44:24.818 --> 44:29.466
After coming to Sahaja Yoga you should understand that

44:29.491 --> 44:32.896
Hanumanji is an ideal in front of you.

44:33.211 --> 44:38.986
Ganeshji is already there, He is the incarnation of innocence

44:39.600 --> 44:44.006
just like small children, very innocent

44:44.074 --> 44:47.035
but very wise.

44:47.759 --> 44:51.719
And a perfect balance of Hanumanji’s

44:51.946 --> 44:54.980
happiness full of love

44:55.610 --> 44:58.844
and along with that experience Divine power.

45:01.370 --> 45:03.823
Keeping this in mind

45:03.848 --> 45:06.830
a Sahaja Yogi's character or life should be such

45:06.855 --> 45:10.163
that he should be balanced.

45:10.188 --> 45:16.857
Even when you are angry, just observe silence.

45:19.781 --> 45:22.510
I feel, I never get angry.

45:22.535 --> 45:26.767
Or maybe I get angry, but I am not aware of it.

45:28.557 --> 45:31.949
And the problem gets solved without getting angry.

45:31.974 --> 45:34.986
Yes, I may say,"what are you doing?"

45:35.011 --> 45:38.244
Not much beyond this.

45:38.735 --> 45:43.408
People abuse and use all bad words

45:43.520 --> 45:45.855
But when it crosses its limits

45:47.623 --> 45:51.729
and when this habit of getting angry crosses its limits and man.....

45:51.754 --> 45:53.985
He is sitting angrily

45:54.010 --> 45:55.631
sitting there in a very angry mood.

45:55.670 --> 45:57.532
He is showing his anger.

45:57.557 --> 46:03.029
When people are like that, a serious problem arises

46:03.054 --> 46:08.480
they get a serious disease called Alzheimer.

46:08.884 --> 46:12.380
Alzheimer is caused by anger.

46:15.251 --> 46:19.357
That anger which we get unnecessarily.

46:20.018 --> 46:23.527
Now try to understand, Your son has been slapped by somebody.

46:23.552 --> 46:25.664
And you get angry.

46:26.837 --> 46:29.353
Nothing is gained by getting angry.

46:29.378 --> 46:33.144
On the contrary you should think, if it is the mistake of our son?

46:33.169 --> 46:37.642
Or we are spoiling that boy unnecessarily
under the cover of our love.

46:41.728 --> 46:45.176
He will never have a balance in this way.

46:45.201 --> 46:48.664
Alzheimer is a very serious disease.

46:48.689 --> 46:50.809
A person gets mad,

46:50.873 --> 46:54.165
doesn't even die, nor allows anyone to die,

46:56.313 --> 46:59.791
abuses, goes on shouting.

46:59.816 --> 47:04.144
He gets so much caught up in his left side, in his brain

47:04.193 --> 47:07.263
that his personality becomes very strange.

47:10.172 --> 47:12.565
It's treatment is in Sahaja Yoga

47:12.590 --> 47:14.190
but it is very difficult,

47:14.215 --> 47:16.623
because they go on abusing.

47:16.648 --> 47:19.637
If they will abuse the person who will go to set them right,

47:19.662 --> 47:22.606
who will accept it. If anyone is a doctor.

47:22.631 --> 47:25.089
if he is abused, he will say let him go to hell.

47:25.114 --> 47:26.990
What have I to do with him?

47:27.302 --> 47:30.046
This is what happens with them, they don't want to.

47:30.356 --> 47:33.292
Mother we won't set them right, let them go.

47:34.259 --> 47:36.786
Whichever way they want to live, let them live.

47:36.811 --> 47:43.913
Now the next greatest enemies of Hanumanji are drunkards.

47:45.790 --> 47:51.315
Those who drink, are put to flames like Lanka.

47:54.597 --> 47:57.724
Say, you see those who drink

47:57.912 --> 48:00.625
nobody will talk to them nor do anything else.

48:00.650 --> 48:03.789
He will collect ten more drunkards and drink.

48:04.844 --> 48:06.982
And now when all of them are drinking

48:07.007 --> 48:11.184
they don't have anything to eat nor to drink at their homes.

48:11.209 --> 48:15.738
They are drinking just like mad people.

48:17.115 --> 48:20.937
Those who respect Hanumanji, can't drink,

48:21.561 --> 48:22.561
can't drink because,

48:24.337 --> 48:26.275
on the one hand, you respect Him

48:26.300 --> 48:28.197
and on the other hand do the opposite, that is not possible.

48:29.658 --> 48:33.225
Nowadays I find that drinking is on the rise.

48:41.050 --> 48:43.799
And I am so surprised , there was a senior officer

48:44.010 --> 48:47.233
once we went to his house,

48:47.708 --> 48:50.942
because both of them were friends of My Husband.

48:51.109 --> 48:53.592
And both husband and wife would drink.

48:54.270 --> 48:56.171
It was very cold.

48:56.196 --> 48:58.358
They told Me,"Stay here for the night."

48:58.383 --> 49:00.284
I said,"Ok, we will stay."

49:00.309 --> 49:02.440
In the whole house, there was just one blanket.

49:02.465 --> 49:04.077
I said,"Oh! My God!"

49:04.188 --> 49:07.110
Just one blanket in the home of such a senior officer.

49:07.135 --> 49:09.270
I said," It doesn't matter to Me, I will sleep."

49:09.295 --> 49:12.739
Now they were worried, how to manage for My husband in one blanket.

49:13.733 --> 49:16.699
I said," Don't worry. I will set it right."

49:16.724 --> 49:20.408
They had such a great problem about themselves and their daughter

49:20.433 --> 49:21.951
but they were not willing to agree

49:21.976 --> 49:24.648
that their daughter had any problem.

49:24.680 --> 49:26.408
As soon as they drink

49:26.433 --> 49:27.944
they will start saying

49:27.969 --> 49:30.976
our daughter is best of all, don't say anything.

49:31.023 --> 49:33.630
That girl was in complete devastation,

49:33.674 --> 49:35.337
because they were under the influence of intoxication.

49:35.362 --> 49:37.426
When intoxicated they were not are not in senses.

49:39.077 --> 49:42.795
That girl was completely devastated.

49:42.820 --> 49:45.463
At last she came to Me just now, crying.

49:45.712 --> 49:48.258
She has been totally devastated.

49:49.613 --> 49:53.135
So it is like this that intoxication on account of drinking

49:53.469 --> 49:57.267
increases intoxication all the more

49:58.428 --> 50:01.638
and in that the most intoxicating thing is that

50:01.781 --> 50:04.953
a man is devoid of love.

50:05.112 --> 50:06.947
He doesn't love anyone.

50:07.139 --> 50:13.110
That is why everyone, in every religion, prohibited drinking.

50:14.849 --> 50:16.964
But for example, as is the case with the Christian religion

50:17.100 --> 50:19.917
everybody manages somehow.

50:19.942 --> 50:20.880
They say it is so in Hindu dharam,

50:20.905 --> 50:23.606
in Christians and in Mohammedans too.

50:23.631 --> 50:26.553
So they said that when

50:27.329 --> 50:31.696
Christ had gone to attend a marriage,

50:31.721 --> 50:34.372
in that marriage liquor was made.

50:34.397 --> 50:36.586
Absolutely false!

50:38.003 --> 50:39.748
That is why we drink.

50:39.773 --> 50:43.771
I was surprised in England that if anyone dies, they drink

50:43.796 --> 50:46.091
if anyone dies, even then they drink.

50:46.116 --> 50:48.458
If anyone is born, even then they drink.

50:48.483 --> 50:50.855
What does it mean, I can't understand.

50:51.947 --> 50:54.215
The habit that they have got used to

50:54.240 --> 50:58.101
and drink has become like culture.

50:58.126 --> 50:59.924
They have to write books about drinks

50:59.949 --> 51:02.366
which should be drunk when

51:02.391 --> 51:03.432
not this,that

51:03.457 --> 51:06.665
and  which type of glass should be used.

51:07.960 --> 51:12.384
Now the condition of these drunkards that I have seen

51:12.409 --> 51:16.851
I think they are half human beings and half absolutely mad.

51:17.873 --> 51:19.188
They are mad!

51:19.966 --> 51:22.211
But it is getting sanctified there.

51:22.236 --> 51:24.285
It is topmost in France.

51:24.310 --> 51:26.151
It became the culture of France.

51:26.176 --> 51:28.998
We don't have to learn anything from them.

51:29.023 --> 51:31.777
Now what they talk about drinks;

51:31.897 --> 51:37.664
Christ, when He went there that time,  that place

51:37.689 --> 51:40.166
I have read this in HEBRU

51:40.397 --> 51:43.256
that the people

51:43.939 --> 51:47.210
used to drink the juice of DRAKSHA

51:47.337 --> 51:50.198
means, they used to take grape juice.

51:50.355 --> 51:56.945
So He put His hand in water and made juice of grapes out of water.

51:57.089 --> 52:01.489
Does that juice ever become a drink without rotting and softening?

52:02.784 --> 52:06.742
Can a drink ever be made in two minutes in Sahaj?

52:06.861 --> 52:09.095
Till you do not rot the drink a lot

52:09.120 --> 52:12.849
and the more it is rotten, the more it is costlier.

52:13.373 --> 52:16.866
If it has been rotten for the past fifty years
it is all the more better.

52:16.891 --> 52:20.909
And if it is a hundred year old, it is rare.

52:21.321 --> 52:24.571
These notions about drinks were created by drunkards,

52:24.596 --> 52:27.473
the drunkard writers and the drunkard tellers.

52:29.242 --> 52:31.515
With the lectures of the drunkards

52:31.540 --> 52:34.522
don't know how many people become fools.

52:34.547 --> 52:39.698
But I have not seen any effigy erected of
any drunkard in any country.

52:41.969 --> 52:49.506
So all these people

52:50.731 --> 52:55.292
are not only against Shri Hanuman,

52:55.364 --> 52:58.511
but they attack Him.

52:59.023 --> 53:00.689
Then He also shows His power,

53:00.714 --> 53:03.684
causing such heat in his stomach.

53:03.709 --> 53:07.907
It then causes Cancer and all the diseases.

53:07.932 --> 53:09.529
Drink more and more!

53:16.492 --> 53:19.118
This drinking and serving drinks to others

53:19.143 --> 53:22.628
is the custom of drinking that has started.

53:23.614 --> 53:25.416
I am scared of this.

53:25.441 --> 53:27.309
Manage Hanumanji

53:27.334 --> 53:29.317
Don't know what He will do.

53:30.241 --> 53:32.588
What disaster He may cause

53:32.613 --> 53:34.848
is unpredictable.

53:35.675 --> 53:40.521
I am afraid that one day He may put all the drunkards in the sea,

53:41.504 --> 53:47.006
because  He has mercy, devotion and everything

53:47.031 --> 53:49.746
but those who are against Him

53:49.771 --> 53:51.543
he is not for them.

53:51.822 --> 53:53.948
For example Shri Ganesha

53:53.973 --> 53:57.897
if anyone has a bad character

53:58.111 --> 54:01.312
if any one acts badly

54:01.359 --> 54:06.950
is attacked on his Mooladhara Chakra.

54:07.198 --> 54:10.314
But His case is different.

54:10.560 --> 54:17.095
When He sees that he is playing with his own consciousness

54:17.195 --> 54:25.706
by drinking- consciousness is lost- then He chases him.

54:26.211 --> 54:30.633
There will be conflict, quarrels and fights in homes

54:30.658 --> 54:33.487
and you see there will be fights on roads if you..

54:33.542 --> 54:35.260
NOT CLEAR..

54:35.285 --> 54:39.248
two drunkards will be hitting each other

54:40.882 --> 54:43.814
and then it spreads all the more.

54:43.839 --> 54:48.291
So Sahaja Yogis should not visit any drunkard's house

54:48.670 --> 54:51.143
that is an unholy place

54:51.168 --> 54:58.206
nor should keep any association with any drunkard.

55:00.393 --> 55:02.802
This is also fatal for Sahaja Yogis

55:02.827 --> 55:05.397
because on one hand you respect Hanumanji

55:05.422 --> 55:07.624
and on the other hand join drunkards.

55:12.844 --> 55:26.863
Especially in Poona, I don't know
how many types of Hanumanjis have come  here,

55:26.888 --> 55:32.042
people living in Poona should be very alert.

55:36.446 --> 55:39.612
Once a Hanumanji group had come
and requested Me to deliver a lecture.

55:39.637 --> 55:40.914
I said ,"I won't come".

55:40.939 --> 55:42.326
They asked, “Why Mother?"

55:43.096 --> 55:47.598
I told them that after having a drink you sing silly movie songs.

55:47.623 --> 55:51.405
Do you know who is this Maruti?

55:51.430 --> 55:53.631
When He will strangle throats of all of you

55:53.656 --> 55:55.523
then only you will come to know.

55:55.548 --> 56:02.430
I have heard about Ganpati programs
that  they don't allow anyone to drink.

56:02.737 --> 56:05.216
They drive away those who drink.

56:05.241 --> 56:06.767
Just think,

56:06.792 --> 56:09.146
see their courage!

56:09.171 --> 56:13.149
In front of Hanumanji, they do all this business

56:13.174 --> 56:16.566
In front of Hanumanji!

56:17.617 --> 56:20.053
What a courage!

56:21.680 --> 56:23.550
and this

56:23.968 --> 56:25.788
by doing everything

56:26.890 --> 56:29.745
people think that they get money.

56:30.972 --> 56:33.726
Those who deal in it

56:34.214 --> 56:38.365
and those who drink, are its customers

56:38.865 --> 56:43.867
everybody somehow absolutely

56:45.456 --> 56:51.194
useless, bankrupt , don't have a single penny

56:55.661 --> 56:58.484
We will say, what is there so much in drinking

56:58.509 --> 57:02.219
because it is Shri Hanumanji's case.

57:02.623 --> 57:06.869
What is the reason you are going against Hanumanji?

57:07.204 --> 57:11.177
His power flows through your right side.

57:11.202 --> 57:14.449
Use that in balance.

57:14.474 --> 57:18.859
instead of upsetting your liver, spoil this and spoil that.

57:18.875 --> 57:20.413
He will definitely get upset.

57:21.015 --> 57:24.259
That means it is Hanumanji's job in subtle.

57:25.878 --> 57:29.478
People don't understand this in reality.

57:29.676 --> 57:31.655
In reality it is such

57:31.680 --> 57:33.774
that if you say something against drinking

57:33.799 --> 57:36.749
people will run to kill you.

57:37.503 --> 57:38.470
If you don't drink

57:38.495 --> 57:41.091
they will say you are a fool that you don't drink.

57:43.795 --> 57:53.072
Oh!  behind him is standing such great Hanumanji.

57:54.235 --> 57:56.053
If you attack him even once

57:56.078 --> 57:58.360
you will be no more,  you will lose your life.

57:58.385 --> 58:00.560
I think that if people start striking beforehand.....

58:00.599 --> 58:03.272
How do people talk such nonsense?

58:06.635 --> 58:09.318
They will repeat the same thing again and again.

58:11.485 --> 58:13.347
They are almost absolutely mad

58:13.372 --> 58:18.570
they are all together, have a party and they are all mad.

58:22.237 --> 58:27.134
It may be marriage or marriage procession,
everywhere it is prevalent.

58:28.815 --> 58:35.976
Now the person who works

58:36.001 --> 58:40.695
one who thinks of the future, one who is thoughtful

58:40.720 --> 58:44.412
but is devoid of love towards everyone

58:44.500 --> 58:48.150
has no feeling of love, he is also in trouble.

58:48.762 --> 58:54.672
Because  the devotee of Rama

58:55.337 --> 58:59.875
there is no whereabouts of Hanumanji.

59:03.598 --> 59:08.616
If you are a great worker

59:08.843 --> 59:10.849
you are a well to do person, a nice person

59:10.886 --> 59:13.724
but you don't have love for anyone

59:15.707 --> 59:18.151
it won't work.

59:19.277 --> 59:22.910
You have to love everyone

59:23.763 --> 59:25.526
and that is why

59:25.681 --> 59:30.556
Christ has said ,"Forgive everyone."

59:30.747 --> 59:34.910
Who are you not to forgive?

59:35.495 --> 59:37.765
You yourself are not Hanumanji.

59:38.026 --> 59:42.597
Yes, Hanumanji is with you and He is an ideal for you

59:43.100 --> 59:51.588
that He on the basis of His devotion
has attained this high position.

59:53.691 --> 59:58.620
Wherever there is heat, people's brains get upset

59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.848
and the bond of love gets disrupted.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:12.086
Every body should salute such Hanuman devotee, Shri Bajrangbali

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:20.827
and should understand that whatever powers
we have got from Sahaja Yoga

01:00:20.852 --> 01:00:23.554
we should keep in balance.

01:00:26.953 --> 01:00:29.176
Love is such a thing

01:00:29.201 --> 01:00:36.844
that you can win over great personalities with the bond of love.

01:00:39.915 --> 01:00:42.652
I go on doing the same

01:00:42.677 --> 01:00:45.839
because I have to face strange people.

01:00:46.536 --> 01:00:51.882
Now handle them with such a trick of love that they will be ok.

01:00:52.685 --> 01:00:54.843
Once I went somewhere.

01:00:54.882 --> 01:00:59.098
There was a famous but very short tempered saint;

01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:02.124
All of them are very short tempered.

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:04.198
Then I climbed up and went there.

01:01:05.126 --> 01:01:09.432
He was shaking his neck in anger.

01:01:09.631 --> 01:01:17.650
Because he was egoistic that he could control rain.

01:01:18.149 --> 01:01:22.054
And as I climbed up and reached

01:01:22.205 --> 01:01:25.016
I was drenched completely wet in rain.

01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:29.447
Now, he was sitting in great anger.

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:32.295
I sat in his cave.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.284
He came and sat

01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:36.281
He was very angry.

01:01:36.306 --> 01:01:39.730
I asked,"What happened, even if I got wet?"

01:01:39.755 --> 01:01:48.532
He said, "You did not stop the rain to take away my ego.

01:01:48.557 --> 01:01:50.403
Because I can stop it.

01:01:50.428 --> 01:01:52.489
I had this ego."

01:01:52.514 --> 01:01:54.435
"There is nothing like that."

01:01:54.606 --> 01:01:59.737
I said,"You are a Saint and you have purchased a saree for Me.

01:02:00.204 --> 01:02:06.415
I cannot take anything from a saint.

01:02:06.646 --> 01:02:09.483
And you cannot give Me anything.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.056
Then I thought it is better to get wet
nd I will have to accept it."

01:02:15.911 --> 01:02:17.509
Because of that

01:02:17.534 --> 01:02:21.988
tears came out of his eyes and he fell down at My feet.

01:02:22.726 --> 01:02:26.145
I said, ‘what should I have done?
I had to just get wet.

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:29.453
Otherwise I too would not have accepted it.

01:02:29.478 --> 01:02:31.367
I said that it is better to get a little wet

01:02:31.392 --> 01:02:33.003
then I will have to accept it’.

01:02:34.323 --> 01:02:36.563
Then he said, "Is it so?"

01:02:36.588 --> 01:02:41.172
I said you have purchased a peach coloured saree for Me

01:02:41.197 --> 01:02:43.984
and nauvar (nine yards) this you have done a good thing

01:02:44.009 --> 01:02:49.089
because My petticoat too has got wet, so I can wear this nauvar.

01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:52.465
He was very happy.

01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:55.868
So, love is such a thing

01:02:56.043 --> 01:03:00.891
that it brings down to earth even great people fuming with anger.

01:03:02.497 --> 01:03:07.923
There are so many earlier examples of it.

01:03:07.948 --> 01:03:12.971
When they say," Basu"(Sit down),
the whole night will pass like that.

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:16.489
And even now everyday it happens so.

01:03:16.514 --> 01:03:18.821
Talk with love.

01:03:19.717 --> 01:03:21.562
How does it matter?

01:03:21.587 --> 01:03:26.874
If you love others, their good qualities will transmit to you

01:03:27.163 --> 01:03:36.722
and if you hate someone, their bad qualities will transmit to you.

01:03:37.262 --> 01:03:39.725
It is all give and take.

01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:43.684
This person is like this, that person is like that

01:03:43.709 --> 01:03:45.798
whosoever you see is not right.

01:03:47.399 --> 01:03:49.996
It is a custom with so many people

01:03:50.021 --> 01:03:51.492
It is their culture

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.824
that if someone comes to his home

01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:55.819
stays, has his meals and fun and everything is over.

01:03:55.844 --> 01:03:59.764
As soon as he leaves, comments follow that he is such a bad man.

01:03:59.789 --> 01:04:01.291
Next came and sat down

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:02.894
especially among women it is too much prevalent.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.420
He comes and sits.

01:04:05.445 --> 01:04:07.569
You are very nice, very nice and now you can go.

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:09.408
Yes he is like that!

01:04:10.392 --> 01:04:14.723
Oh! this outward love won't work.

01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:20.780
If you shower artificial love, does he not understand?

01:04:21.386 --> 01:04:27.204
You have got the power to love by heart as you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:04:30.026 --> 01:04:35.641
And when you will imbibe this

01:04:36.195 --> 01:04:42.098
when the tree of love will bloom by itself

01:04:42.325 --> 01:04:47.695
you will give joy to others and you too will enjoy its fragrance.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:53.244
Except the ocean of love, you will not like anything.

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:59.891
So, what you have to learn from Bajrangbali is

01:04:59.916 --> 01:05:06.338
His devotion and that power which He has given to you

01:05:06.363 --> 01:05:11.425
that nobody can touch you if your devotion is pure.

01:05:11.871 --> 01:05:13.866
Nobody can touch you.

01:05:13.891 --> 01:05:16.963
There are thousands of such examples in Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:16.988 --> 01:05:19.028
People call these miracles

01:05:19.053 --> 01:05:23.540
but I say that it is Shri Hanumanji's blessing.

01:05:26.899 --> 01:05:33.686
So, now I give My blessings and love to all of you.

01:05:35.509 --> 01:05:39.785
First love yourself and then others.

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:42.009
It doesn't mean my son, my this

01:05:42.034 --> 01:05:42.766
No! No! No!

01:05:43.984 --> 01:05:48.643
It means selfless love.

01:05:48.668 --> 01:05:51.185
Love that expects no return,

01:05:52.245 --> 01:05:55.982
Which has no relation, is limitless.

01:05:56.007 --> 01:06:02.624
Such a power of love has come to you, use it.

01:06:03.855 --> 01:06:06.156
Lots of blessings!

01:07:26.964 --> 01:07:31.554
Anant Aashirvad (Limitless blessings).
