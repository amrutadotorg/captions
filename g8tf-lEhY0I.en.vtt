Shri Hanuman puja. Pune (India), 31 March 1999.

00:04:58.524 --> 00:05:08.775
Today we are celebrating Jayanti (Birth Anniversary) of Hanumanji.

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:20.405
What should we say about Hanumanji!

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:28.607
He was so powerful and wise.

00:05:30.607 --> 00:05:36.436
He was equally devoted and dedicated.

00:05:39.226 --> 00:05:47.194
Generally such a powerful person becomes right sided.

00:05:47.623 --> 00:05:51.773
He considers Himself so dignified that

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:59.053
He doesn't give any importance to anyone in His comparison.

00:06:00.683 --> 00:06:10.901
But Hanumanji is a special Deity.

00:06:11.852 --> 00:06:19.190
A special deity full of qualities that as much strong He was

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:26.545
as much powerful He was as much was His devotion.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.130
An embodiment of balanced strength

00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:34.974
He had as much power, as He had devotion.

00:06:40.681 --> 00:06:51.072
How did He maintain this balance?

00:06:51.325 --> 00:06:56.781
And was steady in it  is worth understanding.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.230
In Sahaja yoga, when we are enlightened

00:07:05.617 --> 00:07:12.171
and in Sahaja yoga we get many powers

00:07:13.073 --> 00:07:17.528
simultaneously, we get balance.

00:07:21.046 --> 00:07:23.615
We love others.

00:07:25.462 --> 00:07:30.199
With love and with the help of the power of Love

00:07:30.302 --> 00:07:35.420
we get busy in our work and go on doing our work.

00:07:35.859 --> 00:07:39.544
In this way, Shree Hanumanji

00:07:39.815 --> 00:07:42.223
was very powerful.

00:07:42.427 --> 00:07:44.853
He had Divine powers

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:48.585
He had NAVADHA (Special) powers.

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:52.137
which are called GARIMA, LAGHUMA.

00:07:52.162 --> 00:07:54.762
He could become as big as He wanted to be

00:07:54.787 --> 00:07:57.101
or as minute as He wanted to be

00:07:57.189 --> 00:08:01.263
and as small as an atom.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.894
All these powers

00:08:06.727 --> 00:08:09.332
He got through His devotion.

00:08:10.065 --> 00:08:13.361
It means that devotion and power

00:08:13.418 --> 00:08:15.868
are both the same.

00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:19.602
He who has power

00:08:19.627 --> 00:08:23.776
and doesn't have devotion, becomes a Rakshasa (Demon).

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:27.198
And He who has devotion

00:08:27.223 --> 00:08:30.945
but doesn't have power, becomes mad.

00:08:32.654 --> 00:08:36.660
Between both these, he who is in the central path

00:08:41.347 --> 00:08:49.412
attains this state which you may call power, or devotion.

00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:53.900
Each part of his body is made of that.

00:08:56.352 --> 00:09:03.352
Because of His this special feature today we worship Bajrang Bali

00:09:03.745 --> 00:09:10.218
in our motherland as well as in foreign countries.

00:09:10.624 --> 00:09:12.639
I am so surprised

00:09:12.834 --> 00:09:16.714
that the young boys, children of foreign countries,

00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:19.583
when they draw any picture

00:09:19.608 --> 00:09:24.438
first of all they draw Hanumanji’s picture.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.459
Next, His special quality

00:09:28.497 --> 00:09:34.680
was that He was half man and half monkey.

00:09:36.538 --> 00:09:44.452
Means, it was a perfect combination of animal and human being.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:58.387
So within us, whatever we have lost  in our evolution

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:08.183
in that, the element of love and attachment that was what he

00:10:08.687 --> 00:10:10.678
took with him.

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:23.906
For example, you see that guru's enamored path is believed

00:10:23.931 --> 00:10:32.873
in which of guru's  which creatures are considered as attendants.

00:10:33.123 --> 00:10:35.783
That is why they consider dogs.

00:10:36.173 --> 00:10:38.760
A dog has that quality

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:47.346
that like a guru's disciple is fully dedicated

00:10:47.952 --> 00:10:53.686
and has no other master except his guru

00:10:54.535 --> 00:10:58.526
and has no other thought.

00:10:58.765 --> 00:11:04.040
Every time,  he sacrifices his life for his master.

00:11:05.262 --> 00:11:08.922
In the same way, it should be understood that

00:11:09.112 --> 00:11:13.630
a creature who has been brought up in evolution

00:11:13.655 --> 00:11:16.726
when he comes in contact with a human being,

00:11:17.007 --> 00:11:21.555
what he learns, is full devotion.

00:11:22.346 --> 00:11:29.423
It means, devotion is innately born within us.

00:11:32.654 --> 00:11:40.355
The seed of devotion is beforehand completely sown within us.

00:11:41.258 --> 00:11:46.689
When we were not in this state, not in the human state

00:11:46.728 --> 00:11:51.414
the emergence of devotion was more at that time.

00:11:51.531 --> 00:11:56.000
Devotion set its roots deeply in us.

00:11:56.025 --> 00:11:59.214
Take an example of any animal.

00:12:00.035 --> 00:12:02.049
You get a little love from him,

00:12:02.074 --> 00:12:05.430
give him a little love, a little fondness for him

00:12:05.598 --> 00:12:11.107
he gets so close to you, gives his regard to you

00:12:11.696 --> 00:12:15.501
and in this way loves you.

00:12:15.966 --> 00:12:18.774
You must have heard about a horse too

00:12:18.974 --> 00:12:23.743
that when a horse's rider falls down

00:12:23.768 --> 00:12:28.684
or is about to die, he remains loyal to him.

00:12:36.384 --> 00:12:43.169
In the same way it is said about elephants.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.899
The elephants' determination too is terrific.

00:12:48.924 --> 00:12:55.975
They never put their master to any trouble

00:12:56.554 --> 00:13:09.144
and if a lion or any other animal attacks their master

00:13:09.169 --> 00:13:12.183
the elephant will better die while going on fighting

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.560
but he will not allow his master to be touched.

00:13:15.818 --> 00:13:25.110
This relation of a master and superior and high-quality animals

00:13:26.776 --> 00:13:31.591
this relation is established within us beforehand.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:38.957
And along with this relationship we get that power as well.

00:13:39.195 --> 00:13:40.780
For example, I told you that

00:13:40.805 --> 00:13:43.499
the elephant will die while going on fighting in the battlefield.

00:13:43.524 --> 00:13:47.879
The elephant gets this power of fighting too

00:13:47.904 --> 00:13:51.306
because of his love and devotion.

00:13:55.832 --> 00:14:05.740
We say that Sahaj yoga is the work of love and Divine love is true.

00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:11.784
But while doing this work, that power is also inherent in it.

00:14:14.811 --> 00:14:19.397
We may or may not know it,

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:26.186
we may or may not have any knowledge of that

00:14:26.413 --> 00:14:32.362
but that also is inherent in it, and that is Divine power.

00:14:35.192 --> 00:14:39.783
Man's bowing down before anyone

00:14:39.883 --> 00:14:45.249
to respect anyone, to consider anyone great

00:14:45.308 --> 00:14:48.545
all these are the indications of that.

00:14:48.887 --> 00:14:55.785
But when he respects his master, then within him

00:14:56.007 --> 00:14:58.907
there is importance to his master

00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:03.749
but along with that is his power as well.

00:15:04.176 --> 00:15:07.806
So, devotion and power are not two different things.

00:15:07.855 --> 00:15:10.522
They are just one and the same.

00:15:10.547 --> 00:15:14.890
We will say that if there is power in the right hand

00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:16.759
there is devotion in the left hand.

00:15:17.863 --> 00:15:20.529
This fusion of power and devotion

00:15:20.824 --> 00:15:25.700
has been described beautifully in Shree Hanumanji.

00:15:27.513 --> 00:15:31.445
On the one hand He went burn Ravan's Lanka

00:15:32.876 --> 00:15:38.206
and there only He prostrated before Sitaji.

00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:44.687
And when Sitaji said ''No, you are My son

00:15:44.783 --> 00:15:46.902
I will not come at the behest of My son.

00:15:46.927 --> 00:15:50.782
My husband will have to come and will have to destroy this man.

00:15:52.376 --> 00:15:58.755
When He will destroy him (Ravana), then I will go with Him."

00:15:58.996 --> 00:16:02.963
Hanumanji said, “That is okay!"

00:16:02.988 --> 00:16:05.727
He could have picked Her up like that only.

00:16:06.045 --> 00:16:09.375
He had such powers.

00:16:09.765 --> 00:16:17.665
But He said,"If Mother is saying so, it is okay."

00:16:17.898 --> 00:16:21.929
And after that, such a great war broke out.

00:16:21.954 --> 00:16:25.405
There was a need for that.

00:16:27.313 --> 00:16:30.441
Now there were special qualities of Shri Ram.

00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:33.794
Extremely powerful!

00:16:34.413 --> 00:16:38.218
And His aim would never go astray.

00:16:39.451 --> 00:16:44.461
You must have heard what He did in Sita Swayamvar.

00:16:44.486 --> 00:16:47.231
But the same Shri Ram

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:52.867
when it was the case of Ravana

00:16:54.292 --> 00:16:56.481
He didn't give up.

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.348
He killed Him.

00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:08.592
Tulsidas ji has given a beautiful description of this scene.

00:17:09.158 --> 00:17:15.141
Then Shri Ram was repeatedly hitting the arrows

00:17:17.378 --> 00:17:20.761
at Ravana's ten heads.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.500
The heads would fall down one by one but get back again,

00:17:23.525 --> 00:17:25.335
fall down and get back again.

00:17:28.601 --> 00:17:31.283
Then Laxman said ,"what are You doing?

00:17:31.649 --> 00:17:34.476
Shoot one arrow in His heart,

00:17:35.298 --> 00:17:38.394
the moment You will hit an arrow in His heart

00:17:38.419 --> 00:17:40.069
instantly He will die

00:17:40.094 --> 00:17:41.994
Otherwise, how can He die ?

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:43.870
He cannot die."

00:17:44.956 --> 00:17:49.489
The arrow should hit His heart.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.695
There is a beautiful description of Shri Ram there.

00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:57.705
He was a shy person, very shy.

00:17:57.879 --> 00:18:05.043
Shri Ram, even though He was so powerful, so intense

00:18:06.587 --> 00:18:09.089
even though He was such a noble person

00:18:09.114 --> 00:18:12.310
He said, " You see the problem is that

00:18:12.335 --> 00:18:17.282
in Ravan's heart resides My Sita.

00:18:17.406 --> 00:18:19.800
So, I won't hit Him in his heart.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.745
But when his head will cut off repeatedly

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:29.084
his attention will surely shift towards his head.

00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:32.996
At that time I will kill him with an arrow."

00:18:33.021 --> 00:18:34.983
Otherwise for Him, it would be said

00:18:35.008 --> 00:18:37.494
that he would kill a person just with one arrow.

00:18:37.519 --> 00:18:40.346
But now you see how delicate the matter is.

00:18:40.371 --> 00:18:46.875
Simply, it is a husband's love towards his wife.

00:18:48.079 --> 00:18:55.547
Even though being an ocean of power, what an amount of love He had!

00:18:57.617 --> 00:19:01.152
There are many instances of Hanumanji

00:19:01.901 --> 00:19:13.398
in which Hanumanji proved that He is ocean of love

00:19:13.574 --> 00:19:18.894
and at the same time, he who is evil minded

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:24.773
he who bothers others, he who destroys others

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:33.633
he doesn't hesitate in any way to kill him.

00:19:34.433 --> 00:19:42.533
As all this fact is about Hanuman's devotion

00:19:42.924 --> 00:19:48.239
the same is worth noticing about his power of strength.

00:19:51.009 --> 00:19:56.542
He knew that Ravana was afraid only of fire.

00:19:58.904 --> 00:20:01.970
So, He went to Lanka and set it on fire.

00:20:02.478 --> 00:20:08.879
This was His power that He put Lanka on fire.

00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:15.805
And in that fire, He didn't kill anyone, He did not burn anyone.

00:20:16.305 --> 00:20:18.948
Ravana also did not get burnt,  nobody got burnt

00:20:18.973 --> 00:20:21.989
but he got scared.

00:20:22.014 --> 00:20:26.795
People got scared, as to what crime Ravana is doing.

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:32.540
People had given full consent about
the type of deeds Ravana was doing.

00:20:32.746 --> 00:20:38.411
They would say, "He is Ravana. it is his will.

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:43.783
Whatever he wants to do, let him do. Who are we to question him?

00:20:44.363 --> 00:20:46.444
Ravana is after all Ravana."

00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:54.860
But it is worth noticing that when Lanka was on fire

00:20:54.885 --> 00:20:59.034
when Lanka was completely combusted

00:20:59.307 --> 00:21:06.187
people understood that it was a dangerous situation

00:21:07.162 --> 00:21:14.135
because Lanka was put on fire and we too could be burnt.

00:21:14.868 --> 00:21:18.800
The quality of fire is that it goes upwards, doesn't come downwards.

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:22.488
Everybody was watching upwards that it was burning.

00:21:22.702 --> 00:21:27.975
Whole of Lanka was combusted but nobody got burnt.

00:21:30.392 --> 00:21:33.110
He did so to frighten them

00:21:33.135 --> 00:21:39.885
to make them understand that Ravana is committing a great sin.

00:21:40.692 --> 00:21:46.516
How much understanding and how much balanced was Bajrang Bali

00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:48.512
should be noted.

00:21:49.596 --> 00:21:52.612
The same we come across in History.

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:59.675
All those who were very powerful had immense love.

00:22:00.396 --> 00:22:05.316
If you observe an example, there is an example of Shivaji Maharaj.

00:22:05.417 --> 00:22:12.562
He was as powerful as He was well behaved,

00:22:12.667 --> 00:22:19.502
very disciplined and very well balanced.

00:22:21.931 --> 00:22:26.991
When you get this balance, then you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:22:27.767 --> 00:22:31.799
If you get the power, it doesn't mean

00:22:31.824 --> 00:22:39.868
that you in your love and your dealings you somehow give up.

00:22:40.863 --> 00:22:46.249
But you are powerful and its beauty is that

00:22:46.584 --> 00:22:52.383
those who are Schedule caste, poor and unhappy

00:22:52.408 --> 00:22:56.281
those who are victims, those who are facing disaster

00:22:56.306 --> 00:22:57.840
are secured.........

00:22:59.062 --> 00:23:03.474
And those who are troubling them

00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:08.946
those who are destroying, those who are bothering

00:23:09.095 --> 00:23:12.179
have created  problems for people

00:23:12.204 --> 00:23:15.401
to such people

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.224
there is no need to do anything.

00:23:17.249 --> 00:23:19.530
You can set them right only with the help of bandhans.

00:23:22.131 --> 00:23:25.830
The powers that you have received inside your being

00:23:25.966 --> 00:23:29.140
it should be used for this very purpose

00:23:29.381 --> 00:23:35.879
so that the evil will be destroyed.

00:23:37.393 --> 00:23:40.399
But in your power there is no sword

00:23:40.694 --> 00:23:43.536
or mace in your hand like Hanumanji.

00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:50.507
Mace is not outwardly but it is inside.

00:23:52.178 --> 00:23:55.220
You watch your experiences

00:23:55.450 --> 00:24:02.546
that he who bothers or disturbs, he is attacked by a mace

00:24:03.831 --> 00:24:07.533
you may or may not pick a mace in your hand.

00:24:08.013 --> 00:24:12.276
In this way you yourself are safe by default

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.065
your safety is  guaranteed

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:31.522
but along with that your other sahaja yogis too are safe.

00:24:32.662 --> 00:24:37.461
Now in this Shri Bajrangbali has a great role to play.

00:24:37.486 --> 00:24:39.017
You don't know

00:24:39.042 --> 00:24:42.846
that he is standing in front of you as well as at your back.

00:24:48.092 --> 00:24:51.508
His nature is just like children

00:24:52.672 --> 00:24:58.849
Too pure and too simple

00:24:59.589 --> 00:25:04.008
but such wisdom

00:25:06.345 --> 00:25:09.889
and all types of virtues He knows.

00:25:11.355 --> 00:25:15.726
It means that along with His power

00:25:15.751 --> 00:25:25.567
He has a lot of absolute discretion- very wise.

00:25:26.427 --> 00:25:29.659
The wisdom of the present time is useless

00:25:29.792 --> 00:25:31.378
but the wisdom

00:25:31.403 --> 00:25:35.351
that will scrutinize and understand everything with love

00:25:37.895 --> 00:25:43.444
a special form of that wisdom

00:25:44.834 --> 00:25:51.003
was Shri Ganesha and is Shri Hanumana.

00:25:53.954 --> 00:25:59.594
The speciality of both of them is that

00:25:59.619 --> 00:26:09.011
Hanumanji is very strong, very quick deity

00:26:09.036 --> 00:26:13.710
and Shri Ganesha is very cool.

00:26:13.735 --> 00:26:23.216
But both are great destructors in times of need.

00:26:23.352 --> 00:26:26.983
For Sahaja Yogis there is no need of destruction.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.136
There is no need to destroy anyone.

00:26:30.303 --> 00:26:32.837
You just think

00:26:35.685 --> 00:26:41.443
that both of them are with you at every moment.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:46.209
Whenever anyone bothers you

00:26:46.552 --> 00:26:53.385
in reality, your protectors are standing with you.

00:26:54.182 --> 00:26:57.309
Many times, you must be noticing

00:26:57.363 --> 00:27:04.655
that ministers or anyone visits a place, security escorts them.

00:27:04.989 --> 00:27:10.631
Sahaja Yogis' security always escorts them.

00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:19.576
The other security with them is that of Ganas.

00:27:23.507 --> 00:27:26.767
Now their work is too diversified

00:27:26.792 --> 00:27:30.635
miscellaneous and little job work also.

00:27:31.646 --> 00:27:34.171
And these only

00:27:34.196 --> 00:27:41.080
give a message about you to Shri Ganesha who is Ganapati

00:27:41.106 --> 00:27:42.105
about what is going on?

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.868
What wrong is going on and where?

00:27:43.893 --> 00:27:47.023
From where you are being attacked ?

00:27:47.048 --> 00:27:51.161
And from where you are troubled?

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.136
you may not even be knowing.

00:27:55.161 --> 00:27:58.533
Somebody may like to attack you in an unknown form

00:27:59.557 --> 00:28:04.943
even then both these deities are standing with you

00:28:04.968 --> 00:28:10.425
and when Ganapati tells this

00:28:10.617 --> 00:28:14.093
Shri Hanuman gets ready.

00:28:14.229 --> 00:28:18.005
Sahaja Yogis need not be afraid of anything.

00:28:18.203 --> 00:28:20.847
No need to be afraid of anything

00:28:20.872 --> 00:28:22.817
Right now I am going to tell you a Story.

00:28:22.842 --> 00:28:24.932
It is so amazing.

00:28:24.957 --> 00:28:37.023
You must have heard that America exploded a lot of bombs everywhere

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:46.158
thinking that terrorists have made some arrangements.

00:28:47.325 --> 00:28:53.941
The story I am going to tell you is about a place in Africa.

00:28:54.164 --> 00:28:59.295
Here were some Sahaja Yogis and a bomb exploded there.

00:29:00.865 --> 00:29:05.596
Because of that bomb explosion, all the people died

00:29:05.621 --> 00:29:07.554
and Sahaja Yogis remained unhurt.

00:29:09.075 --> 00:29:10.107
They were so surprised.

00:29:10.132 --> 00:29:12.828
Even the dust did not touch them.

00:29:13.637 --> 00:29:17.859
They had never come to Cabella.

00:29:19.655 --> 00:29:22.384
They had never thought that they would ever come to Cabella.

00:29:22.409 --> 00:29:25.275
But when it took place, they came to Cabella.

00:29:25.818 --> 00:29:31.068
And after coming said,''Mother, don't know who saved us

00:29:31.618 --> 00:29:33.597
who protected us.''

00:29:33.966 --> 00:29:40.186
But all Sahaja Yogis were saved and the rest of the people died...

00:29:46.282 --> 00:29:50.308
Now it is an incident, it is true.

00:29:50.333 --> 00:29:57.884
And its reason is this that you have now recognized God.

00:29:57.909 --> 00:30:09.033
You have enlightened your soul in Sahaja Marga.

00:30:14.252 --> 00:30:24.330
With this new transformation

00:30:24.355 --> 00:30:36.083
you have become a great devotee and a powerful human being.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.801
Now it is not at all possible for anyone to touch you.

00:30:40.826 --> 00:30:44.696
I can give you hundreds of such examples

00:30:44.983 --> 00:30:48.091
that when you get your realization in Sahaja

00:30:50.346 --> 00:30:54.449
nobody can touch you.

00:30:56.198 --> 00:30:58.371
Previously also there were saints.

00:30:58.435 --> 00:31:01.959
All of them were tortured, victimized, everything happened.

00:31:02.513 --> 00:31:09.309
But in spite of being victimized or tortured, they didn't give up

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:13.716
and not only this, they were always protected.

00:31:15.498 --> 00:31:20.928
And they would talk about such things
which would make people very angry.

00:31:20.959 --> 00:31:23.317
They would think, what are they talking

00:31:23.342 --> 00:31:28.141
against kings, against emperors and against everybody.

00:31:28.188 --> 00:31:32.364
They would talk about such things which would scare people

00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:37.423
but because of Hanumanji's powers, nobody could touch them.

00:31:38.175 --> 00:31:40.537
Nobody hit them.

00:31:40.791 --> 00:31:44.571
There is a nice story about Khwaja Nizzamudin Saheb.

00:31:45.017 --> 00:31:53.303
That his king told him to bow down before him ..[unclear]..

00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:54.664
He didn't bow down.

00:31:54.689 --> 00:31:58.695
He said, "No, I am not going to bow down before you. Who are you?''

00:31:59.404 --> 00:32:01.094
He was very angry.

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:03.441
He said that if within three days

00:32:03.466 --> 00:32:06.670
you do not come and bow down before me

00:32:06.695 --> 00:32:09.360
I will get your neck cut off''.

00:32:09.443 --> 00:32:11.132
He said,'' Ok, get it cut off!

00:32:11.157 --> 00:32:12.592
I won't

00:32:12.617 --> 00:32:16.922
because you are not a great saint that i will bow down before you.''

00:32:19.284 --> 00:32:25.798
Then he came and raised a great commotion

00:32:25.823 --> 00:32:30.563
that after three days this man's neck is to be cut off.

00:32:30.612 --> 00:32:33.894
The day his neck was going to be cut off

00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:38.093
that night only, this King's neck got cut off, nobody knows how?

00:32:41.613 --> 00:32:47.861
If this would not have been in history, those who were great saints

00:32:47.886 --> 00:32:53.958
those who were great followers of dharma, would have been no more.

00:32:54.764 --> 00:33:01.054
Because Rakshas's ways are so powerful and violent

00:33:01.445 --> 00:33:09.084
and are so comprehensive that
they would have surely put an end to them.

00:33:09.735 --> 00:33:16.519
But behind them is God.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:23.181
And God is on one side Hanuman and on another side Ganesha.

00:33:23.329 --> 00:33:26.442
He is made of these two powers together.

00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:31.775
He is a protector, He takes care.

00:33:33.062 --> 00:33:38.119
There is a story of Rana Pratap of Mewar

00:33:38.932 --> 00:33:41.827
that when he went to fight a war,

00:33:43.115 --> 00:33:49.022
his soldiers thought that he was going to be defeated.

00:33:49.047 --> 00:33:49.880
So, they told him

00:33:49.905 --> 00:33:51.372
''You return back

00:33:52.917 --> 00:33:54.716
because we want that your life should be saved

00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:56.040
for the sake of Mewar."

00:33:56.462 --> 00:33:57.761
He didn't listen.

00:33:57.909 --> 00:34:00.220
He said,"All of you better go back.

00:34:00.245 --> 00:34:02.923
I will stay put like this

00:34:02.948 --> 00:34:05.939
because the Ganas are standing with me."

00:34:06.498 --> 00:34:07.989
He too was a Sahaja Yogi.

00:34:09.228 --> 00:34:11.141
"If you want to go, you go.

00:34:11.166 --> 00:34:13.129
I will stay here like this, only

00:34:13.345 --> 00:34:15.973
because the Ganas are with me."

00:34:16.396 --> 00:34:19.212
Just understand that

00:34:19.304 --> 00:34:23.891
you have every type of protection in your front and back.

00:34:31.675 --> 00:34:34.918
But just on getting this protection

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.749
what should a man have? What should a Sahaja Yogi have?

00:34:40.041 --> 00:34:46.325
A very serious and determined person, and not afraid of anyone.

00:34:51.509 --> 00:34:55.121
He doesn't run away from anyone.

00:34:56.269 --> 00:35:00.222
He sticks at that place

00:35:01.289 --> 00:35:11.406
and those who are evil persons,in front of him.

00:35:16.039 --> 00:35:19.066
He doesn't need to do anything.

00:35:21.199 --> 00:35:23.123
That period is over.

00:35:23.148 --> 00:35:26.908
Now you just stand at a place and the other person will run away.

00:35:26.932 --> 00:35:29.018
He won't come to know what happened.

00:35:30.011 --> 00:35:34.436
Sahaja Yogis write and send about many such experiences

00:35:34.461 --> 00:35:38.885
that happened like this and that.

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:43.429
Otherwise in the presence of these foreigners

00:35:43.454 --> 00:35:47.196
it is not so easy to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:48.335 --> 00:35:51.572
And since Sahaja Yoga has started spreading among Muslims too

00:35:51.597 --> 00:35:53.924
you can understand that

00:35:53.949 --> 00:35:57.553
that this Divine power which is the power of love,

00:35:57.578 --> 00:35:59.856
how much strength it has within it

00:36:01.658 --> 00:36:05.461
and how many tasks can be done with the help of it.

00:36:06.119 --> 00:36:08.069
But it doesn't mean that

00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:19.188
you make any harassment in the name of Hanumanji.

00:36:19.452 --> 00:36:21.947
It doesn't at all mean that.

00:36:22.261 --> 00:36:24.104
For example nowadays, there are such (organizations)

00:36:24.196 --> 00:36:27.174
which  take the name of Hanumanji, take the name of Ganesh ji

00:36:27.246 --> 00:36:33.299
or of Mahadevji and make such organizations.

00:36:34.162 --> 00:36:36.915
There is no need of making any organization.

00:36:37.508 --> 00:36:40.704
You yourself are an organization.

00:36:40.729 --> 00:36:43.830
Neither anybody can touch you

00:36:46.308 --> 00:36:49.271
nor, anyone can destroy you.

00:36:51.362 --> 00:36:55.654
First, it is a matter of understanding one's own self

00:36:55.775 --> 00:36:58.418
which has been said in all scriptures

00:36:59.035 --> 00:37:03.998
that Atmasakhshatkar means to know oneself.

00:37:04.207 --> 00:37:06.557
What does it mean to know oneself?

00:37:08.217 --> 00:37:15.341
To know means to know who is in front of you and who is behind you.

00:37:16.051 --> 00:37:18.772
Who is your protector?

00:37:19.134 --> 00:37:24.492
And the love and affection you have for people

00:37:24.517 --> 00:37:30.899
and those who always think how to please others

00:37:30.924 --> 00:37:34.299
For example (NOT CLEAR)

00:37:34.324 --> 00:37:36.835
that i will make the whole world happy.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.269
I will fill everyone's heart with joy.

00:37:39.294 --> 00:37:41.447
This thought that comes in your mind

00:37:41.472 --> 00:37:47.524
you should understand that there is nobody who can harm you.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.006
Have courage!

00:37:50.446 --> 00:37:52.377
Nobody will destroy you.

00:37:52.402 --> 00:37:55.064
And for that you don't have to do anything.

00:37:58.791 --> 00:38:03.774
For that you don't need to keep any sword

00:38:04.064 --> 00:38:06.358
no need to have a mace

00:38:06.399 --> 00:38:07.674
They are already there.

00:38:07.699 --> 00:38:09.783
They have already come, well prepared.

00:38:10.143 --> 00:38:12.853
And they are settled in you.

00:38:13.799 --> 00:38:21.404
You don't need to make yourself strong. You are already so.

00:38:24.741 --> 00:38:29.454
There is a Chinese story, very interesting!

00:38:29.629 --> 00:38:33.788
In their country, cock fights are organized.

00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:39.336
When the cock fight was on, it so happened that

00:38:40.383 --> 00:38:46.311
somehow a king felt that he should go to a saint.

00:38:47.506 --> 00:38:54.545
Let the cocks learn from the saint, how to fight with the world.

00:38:55.072 --> 00:38:57.162
Because, this saint does not fight with anyone

00:38:57.187 --> 00:38:58.752
nor anyone touches him.

00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:01.173
People run away from him

00:39:01.198 --> 00:39:03.986
and salute him.

00:39:04.011 --> 00:39:07.943
So what is so special about him

00:39:08.078 --> 00:39:14.095
that he is living in this wicked world like this.

00:39:14.939 --> 00:39:18.940
The saint told him,''Ok! leave the cock here.''

00:39:19.683 --> 00:39:23.321
So, he went back, leaving one cock with him.

00:39:23.346 --> 00:39:26.325
He took back that cock after one month

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:31.361
and put him where the cock fight was going on.

00:39:31.386 --> 00:39:33.489
There were a lot of cocks.

00:39:34.073 --> 00:39:37.067
He put him in such a courtyard.

00:39:37.577 --> 00:39:43.997
But this great cock kept standing.

00:39:44.774 --> 00:39:48.561
Now all the cocks were fighting among themselves.

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.960
One after the other they left.

00:39:53.516 --> 00:39:55.799
Only this one cock kept standing.

00:39:57.607 --> 00:40:00.186
Everybody started getting scared of him
and he is not reacting at all.

00:40:00.211 --> 00:40:02.473
Is he somewhat special?

00:40:04.125 --> 00:40:09.076
And at the end that one cock was saved who kept standing gracefully.

00:40:11.292 --> 00:40:14.213
So when we are doing the puja of Hanuman Ji here today

00:40:14.238 --> 00:40:19.181
we must think that Hanumanji has settled in reality within us.

00:40:20.975 --> 00:40:23.622
He is on our right side.

00:40:30.648 --> 00:40:33.057
That means He is working on our Pingala Nadi.

00:40:34.424 --> 00:40:40.574
He works on our Pingala Nadi and creates enthusiasm in us

00:40:42.048 --> 00:40:46.257
and that creates warmath in our body.

00:40:47.151 --> 00:40:49.121
But his path is such that

00:40:49.229 --> 00:40:53.144
along with warmath you feel devotion within you.

00:40:56.271 --> 00:40:59.327
So, the warmath that comes, the enthusiasm it creates

00:41:03.274 --> 00:41:07.045
that works inside us on our right side

00:41:07.549 --> 00:41:12.986
and when we do not absorb the balanced power of Hanumanji

00:41:13.011 --> 00:41:17.056
we get a lot of diseases.

00:41:17.228 --> 00:41:33.493
For example the liver problem, asthma

00:41:35.102 --> 00:41:37.763
and when its heat goes downwards

00:41:37.788 --> 00:41:40.670
Hanumanji controls this heat.

00:41:40.695 --> 00:41:46.079
But when the heat doesn't get controlled, such diseases attack

00:41:46.104 --> 00:41:48.337
which are incurable.

00:41:48.362 --> 00:41:50.735
It can cause blood cancer

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.800
and there can be intestinal trouble

00:41:52.825 --> 00:41:55.072
which means all the troubles all over the world are

00:41:55.097 --> 00:41:57.781
caused just by the breakdown of the liver

00:41:57.806 --> 00:42:04.969
and the liver gets spoiled because we do not follow Hanumanji.

00:42:05.624 --> 00:42:09.059
There is no need to get angry.

00:42:10.709 --> 00:42:13.783
But getting angry and start hitting,

00:42:14.315 --> 00:42:19.725
beating this and that person to create panic,

00:42:20.018 --> 00:42:22.829
this is not Hanumanji's power.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.988
There is no question of getting angry.

00:42:30.457 --> 00:42:34.679
There is no question of getting angry about anyone.

00:42:34.704 --> 00:42:40.561
There is no need at all, if you respect Hanumanji.

00:42:40.722 --> 00:42:43.123
He is not angry with anyone

00:42:45.913 --> 00:42:49.791
But a human being gets angry over everything.

00:42:50.476 --> 00:42:52.846
He gets ego.

00:42:53.766 --> 00:42:55.807
Hanumanji didn't have ego at all.

00:42:55.832 --> 00:42:59.079
A right sided person is very egoistic.

00:43:00.259 --> 00:43:03.946
A human being has so much ego!

00:43:03.971 --> 00:43:07.899
I become restless when I see what they were egotistical.

00:43:09.137 --> 00:43:12.848
That ego doesn't have any meaning

00:43:12.873 --> 00:43:14.164
What does "I" mean?

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:21.985
Even an ordinary human being becomes egoistic.

00:43:22.121 --> 00:43:25.538
And many Kings and emperors also are not egoistic.

00:43:26.474 --> 00:43:31.599
Its reason is that inside their being there is such a conditioning

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.295
that they do not recognize Hanumanji.

00:43:35.561 --> 00:43:40.835
As soon as you recognize Hanuman Ji, you recognise Shri Ram.

00:43:43.155 --> 00:43:48.817
Now tell Me if you are right sided, you should not get Asthma

00:43:48.842 --> 00:43:50.678
because Shree Ram is settled

00:43:50.703 --> 00:43:53.437
according to Sahaja Yoga in our right heart.

00:43:55.573 --> 00:43:58.419
Because you do not recognize Hanumanji

00:43:58.555 --> 00:44:03.419
your behaviour and your balance is not like His

00:44:03.444 --> 00:44:06.808
that is why you get Asthma as well.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:16.947
Shivji's place is in your heart,  there also is the same fuss

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:22.443
and you can get a heart attack or you can have some other diseases.

00:44:24.818 --> 00:44:29.466
After coming to Sahaja Yoga you should understand that

00:44:29.491 --> 00:44:32.896
Hanumanji is an ideal in front of you.

00:44:33.211 --> 00:44:38.986
Ganeshji is already there, He is the incarnation of innocence

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.006
just like small children, very innocent

00:44:44.074 --> 00:44:47.035
but very wise.

00:44:47.759 --> 00:44:51.719
And a perfect balance of Hanumanji’s

00:44:51.946 --> 00:44:54.980
happiness full of love

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:58.844
and along with that experience Divine power.

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:03.823
Keeping this in mind

00:45:03.848 --> 00:45:06.830
a Sahaja Yogi's character or life should be such

00:45:06.855 --> 00:45:10.163
that he should be balanced.

00:45:10.188 --> 00:45:16.857
Even when you are angry, just observe silence.

00:45:19.781 --> 00:45:22.510
I feel, I never get angry.

00:45:22.535 --> 00:45:26.767
Or maybe I get angry, but I am not aware of it.

00:45:28.557 --> 00:45:31.949
And the problem gets solved without getting angry.

00:45:31.974 --> 00:45:34.986
Yes, I may say,"what are you doing?"

00:45:35.011 --> 00:45:38.244
Not much beyond this.

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:43.408
People abuse and use all bad words

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.855
But when it crosses its limits

00:45:47.623 --> 00:45:51.729
and when this habit of getting angry crosses its limits and man.....

00:45:51.754 --> 00:45:53.985
He is sitting angrily

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:55.631
sitting there in a very angry mood.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.532
He is showing his anger.

00:45:57.557 --> 00:46:03.029
When people are like that, a serious problem arises

00:46:03.054 --> 00:46:08.480
they get a serious disease called Alzheimer.

00:46:08.884 --> 00:46:12.380
Alzheimer is caused by anger.

00:46:15.251 --> 00:46:19.357
That anger which we get unnecessarily.

00:46:20.018 --> 00:46:23.527
Now try to understand, Your son has been slapped by somebody.

00:46:23.552 --> 00:46:25.664
And you get angry.

00:46:26.837 --> 00:46:29.353
Nothing is gained by getting angry.

00:46:29.378 --> 00:46:33.144
On the contrary you should think, if it is the mistake of our son?

00:46:33.169 --> 00:46:37.642
Or we are spoiling that boy unnecessarily
under the cover of our love.

00:46:41.728 --> 00:46:45.176
He will never have a balance in this way.

00:46:45.201 --> 00:46:48.664
Alzheimer is a very serious disease.

00:46:48.689 --> 00:46:50.809
A person gets mad,

00:46:50.873 --> 00:46:54.165
doesn't even die, nor allows anyone to die,

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:59.791
abuses, goes on shouting.

00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:04.144
He gets so much caught up in his left side, in his brain

00:47:04.193 --> 00:47:07.263
that his personality becomes very strange.

00:47:10.172 --> 00:47:12.565
It's treatment is in Sahaja Yoga

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:14.190
but it is very difficult,

00:47:14.215 --> 00:47:16.623
because they go on abusing.

00:47:16.648 --> 00:47:19.637
If they will abuse the person who will go to set them right,

00:47:19.662 --> 00:47:22.606
who will accept it. If anyone is a doctor.

00:47:22.631 --> 00:47:25.089
if he is abused, he will say let him go to hell.

00:47:25.114 --> 00:47:26.990
What have I to do with him?

00:47:27.302 --> 00:47:30.046
This is what happens with them, they don't want to.

00:47:30.356 --> 00:47:33.292
Mother we won't set them right, let them go.

00:47:34.259 --> 00:47:36.786
Whichever way they want to live, let them live.

00:47:36.811 --> 00:47:43.913
Now the next greatest enemies of Hanumanji are drunkards.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:51.315
Those who drink, are put to flames like Lanka.

00:47:54.597 --> 00:47:57.724
Say, you see those who drink

00:47:57.912 --> 00:48:00.625
nobody will talk to them nor do anything else.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:03.789
He will collect ten more drunkards and drink.

00:48:04.844 --> 00:48:06.982
And now when all of them are drinking

00:48:07.007 --> 00:48:11.184
they don't have anything to eat nor to drink at their homes.

00:48:11.209 --> 00:48:15.738
They are drinking just like mad people.

00:48:17.115 --> 00:48:20.937
Those who respect Hanumanji, can't drink,

00:48:21.561 --> 00:48:22.561
can't drink because,

00:48:24.337 --> 00:48:26.275
on the one hand, you respect Him

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.197
and on the other hand do the opposite, that is not possible.

00:48:29.658 --> 00:48:33.225
Nowadays I find that drinking is on the rise.

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.799
And I am so surprised , there was a senior officer

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:47.233
once we went to his house,

00:48:47.708 --> 00:48:50.942
because both of them were friends of My Husband.

00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:53.592
And both husband and wife would drink.

00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:56.171
It was very cold.

00:48:56.196 --> 00:48:58.358
They told Me,"Stay here for the night."

00:48:58.383 --> 00:49:00.284
I said,"Ok, we will stay."

00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:02.440
In the whole house, there was just one blanket.

00:49:02.465 --> 00:49:04.077
I said,"Oh! My God!"

00:49:04.188 --> 00:49:07.110
Just one blanket in the home of such a senior officer.

00:49:07.135 --> 00:49:09.270
I said," It doesn't matter to Me, I will sleep."

00:49:09.295 --> 00:49:12.739
Now they were worried, how to manage for My husband in one blanket.

00:49:13.733 --> 00:49:16.699
I said," Don't worry. I will set it right."

00:49:16.724 --> 00:49:20.408
They had such a great problem about themselves and their daughter

00:49:20.433 --> 00:49:21.951
but they were not willing to agree

00:49:21.976 --> 00:49:24.648
that their daughter had any problem.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.408
As soon as they drink

00:49:26.433 --> 00:49:27.944
they will start saying

00:49:27.969 --> 00:49:30.976
our daughter is best of all, don't say anything.

00:49:31.023 --> 00:49:33.630
That girl was in complete devastation,

00:49:33.674 --> 00:49:35.337
because they were under the influence of intoxication.

00:49:35.362 --> 00:49:37.426
When intoxicated they were not are not in senses.

00:49:39.077 --> 00:49:42.795
That girl was completely devastated.

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.463
At last she came to Me just now, crying.

00:49:45.712 --> 00:49:48.258
She has been totally devastated.

00:49:49.613 --> 00:49:53.135
So it is like this that intoxication on account of drinking

00:49:53.469 --> 00:49:57.267
increases intoxication all the more

00:49:58.428 --> 00:50:01.638
and in that the most intoxicating thing is that

00:50:01.781 --> 00:50:04.953
a man is devoid of love.

00:50:05.112 --> 00:50:06.947
He doesn't love anyone.

00:50:07.139 --> 00:50:13.110
That is why everyone, in every religion, prohibited drinking.

00:50:14.849 --> 00:50:16.964
But for example, as is the case with the Christian religion

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:19.917
everybody manages somehow.

00:50:19.942 --> 00:50:20.880
They say it is so in Hindu dharam,

00:50:20.905 --> 00:50:23.606
in Christians and in Mohammedans too.

00:50:23.631 --> 00:50:26.553
So they said that when

00:50:27.329 --> 00:50:31.696
Christ had gone to attend a marriage,

00:50:31.721 --> 00:50:34.372
in that marriage liquor was made.

00:50:34.397 --> 00:50:36.586
Absolutely false!

00:50:38.003 --> 00:50:39.748
That is why we drink.

00:50:39.773 --> 00:50:43.771
I was surprised in England that if anyone dies, they drink

00:50:43.796 --> 00:50:46.091
if anyone dies, even then they drink.

00:50:46.116 --> 00:50:48.458
If anyone is born, even then they drink.

00:50:48.483 --> 00:50:50.855
What does it mean, I can't understand.

00:50:51.947 --> 00:50:54.215
The habit that they have got used to

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:58.101
and drink has become like culture.

00:50:58.126 --> 00:50:59.924
They have to write books about drinks

00:50:59.949 --> 00:51:02.366
which should be drunk when

00:51:02.391 --> 00:51:03.432
not this,that

00:51:03.457 --> 00:51:06.665
and  which type of glass should be used.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.384
Now the condition of these drunkards that I have seen

00:51:12.409 --> 00:51:16.851
I think they are half human beings and half absolutely mad.

00:51:17.873 --> 00:51:19.188
They are mad!

00:51:19.966 --> 00:51:22.211
But it is getting sanctified there.

00:51:22.236 --> 00:51:24.285
It is topmost in France.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:26.151
It became the culture of France.

00:51:26.176 --> 00:51:28.998
We don't have to learn anything from them.

00:51:29.023 --> 00:51:31.777
Now what they talk about drinks;

00:51:31.897 --> 00:51:37.664
Christ, when He went there that time,  that place

00:51:37.689 --> 00:51:40.166
I have read this in HEBRU

00:51:40.397 --> 00:51:43.256
that the people

00:51:43.939 --> 00:51:47.210
used to drink the juice of DRAKSHA

00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:50.198
means, they used to take grape juice.

00:51:50.355 --> 00:51:56.945
So He put His hand in water and made juice of grapes out of water.

00:51:57.089 --> 00:52:01.489
Does that juice ever become a drink without rotting and softening?

00:52:02.784 --> 00:52:06.742
Can a drink ever be made in two minutes in Sahaj?

00:52:06.861 --> 00:52:09.095
Till you do not rot the drink a lot

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:12.849
and the more it is rotten, the more it is costlier.

00:52:13.373 --> 00:52:16.866
If it has been rotten for the past fifty years
it is all the more better.

00:52:16.891 --> 00:52:20.909
And if it is a hundred year old, it is rare.

00:52:21.321 --> 00:52:24.571
These notions about drinks were created by drunkards,

00:52:24.596 --> 00:52:27.473
the drunkard writers and the drunkard tellers.

00:52:29.242 --> 00:52:31.515
With the lectures of the drunkards

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.522
don't know how many people become fools.

00:52:34.547 --> 00:52:39.698
But I have not seen any effigy erected of
any drunkard in any country.

00:52:41.969 --> 00:52:49.506
So all these people

00:52:50.731 --> 00:52:55.292
are not only against Shri Hanuman,

00:52:55.364 --> 00:52:58.511
but they attack Him.

00:52:59.023 --> 00:53:00.689
Then He also shows His power,

00:53:00.714 --> 00:53:03.684
causing such heat in his stomach.

00:53:03.709 --> 00:53:07.907
It then causes Cancer and all the diseases.

00:53:07.932 --> 00:53:09.529
Drink more and more!

00:53:16.492 --> 00:53:19.118
This drinking and serving drinks to others

00:53:19.143 --> 00:53:22.628
is the custom of drinking that has started.

00:53:23.614 --> 00:53:25.416
I am scared of this.

00:53:25.441 --> 00:53:27.309
Manage Hanumanji

00:53:27.334 --> 00:53:29.317
Don't know what He will do.

00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:32.588
What disaster He may cause

00:53:32.613 --> 00:53:34.848
is unpredictable.

00:53:35.675 --> 00:53:40.521
I am afraid that one day He may put all the drunkards in the sea,

00:53:41.504 --> 00:53:47.006
because  He has mercy, devotion and everything

00:53:47.031 --> 00:53:49.746
but those who are against Him

00:53:49.771 --> 00:53:51.543
he is not for them.

00:53:51.822 --> 00:53:53.948
For example Shri Ganesha

00:53:53.973 --> 00:53:57.897
if anyone has a bad character

00:53:58.111 --> 00:54:01.312
if any one acts badly

00:54:01.359 --> 00:54:06.950
is attacked on his Mooladhara Chakra.

00:54:07.198 --> 00:54:10.314
But His case is different.

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:17.095
When He sees that he is playing with his own consciousness

00:54:17.195 --> 00:54:25.706
by drinking- consciousness is lost- then He chases him.

00:54:26.211 --> 00:54:30.633
There will be conflict, quarrels and fights in homes

00:54:30.658 --> 00:54:33.487
and you see there will be fights on roads if you..

00:54:33.542 --> 00:54:35.260
NOT CLEAR..

00:54:35.285 --> 00:54:39.248
two drunkards will be hitting each other

00:54:40.882 --> 00:54:43.814
and then it spreads all the more.

00:54:43.839 --> 00:54:48.291
So Sahaja Yogis should not visit any drunkard's house

00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:51.143
that is an unholy place

00:54:51.168 --> 00:54:58.206
nor should keep any association with any drunkard.

00:55:00.393 --> 00:55:02.802
This is also fatal for Sahaja Yogis

00:55:02.827 --> 00:55:05.397
because on one hand you respect Hanumanji

00:55:05.422 --> 00:55:07.624
and on the other hand join drunkards.

00:55:12.844 --> 00:55:26.863
Especially in Poona, I don't know
how many types of Hanumanjis have come  here,

00:55:26.888 --> 00:55:32.042
people living in Poona should be very alert.

00:55:36.446 --> 00:55:39.612
Once a Hanumanji group had come
and requested Me to deliver a lecture.

00:55:39.637 --> 00:55:40.914
I said ,"I won't come".

00:55:40.939 --> 00:55:42.326
They asked, “Why Mother?"

00:55:43.096 --> 00:55:47.598
I told them that after having a drink you sing silly movie songs.

00:55:47.623 --> 00:55:51.405
Do you know who is this Maruti?

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:53.631
When He will strangle throats of all of you

00:55:53.656 --> 00:55:55.523
then only you will come to know.

00:55:55.548 --> 00:56:02.430
I have heard about Ganpati programs
that  they don't allow anyone to drink.

00:56:02.737 --> 00:56:05.216
They drive away those who drink.

00:56:05.241 --> 00:56:06.767
Just think,

00:56:06.792 --> 00:56:09.146
see their courage!

00:56:09.171 --> 00:56:13.149
In front of Hanumanji, they do all this business

00:56:13.174 --> 00:56:16.566
In front of Hanumanji!

00:56:17.617 --> 00:56:20.053
What a courage!

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.550
and this

00:56:23.968 --> 00:56:25.788
by doing everything

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.745
people think that they get money.

00:56:30.972 --> 00:56:33.726
Those who deal in it

00:56:34.214 --> 00:56:38.365
and those who drink, are its customers

00:56:38.865 --> 00:56:43.867
everybody somehow absolutely

00:56:45.456 --> 00:56:51.194
useless, bankrupt , don't have a single penny

00:56:55.661 --> 00:56:58.484
We will say, what is there so much in drinking

00:56:58.509 --> 00:57:02.219
because it is Shri Hanumanji's case.

00:57:02.623 --> 00:57:06.869
What is the reason you are going against Hanumanji?

00:57:07.204 --> 00:57:11.177
His power flows through your right side.

00:57:11.202 --> 00:57:14.449
Use that in balance.

00:57:14.474 --> 00:57:18.859
instead of upsetting your liver, spoil this and spoil that.

00:57:18.875 --> 00:57:20.413
He will definitely get upset.

00:57:21.015 --> 00:57:24.259
That means it is Hanumanji's job in subtle.

00:57:25.878 --> 00:57:29.478
People don't understand this in reality.

00:57:29.676 --> 00:57:31.655
In reality it is such

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.774
that if you say something against drinking

00:57:33.799 --> 00:57:36.749
people will run to kill you.

00:57:37.503 --> 00:57:38.470
If you don't drink

00:57:38.495 --> 00:57:41.091
they will say you are a fool that you don't drink.

00:57:43.795 --> 00:57:53.072
Oh!  behind him is standing such great Hanumanji.

00:57:54.235 --> 00:57:56.053
If you attack him even once

00:57:56.078 --> 00:57:58.360
you will be no more,  you will lose your life.

00:57:58.385 --> 00:58:00.560
I think that if people start striking beforehand.....

00:58:00.599 --> 00:58:03.272
How do people talk such nonsense?

00:58:06.635 --> 00:58:09.318
They will repeat the same thing again and again.

00:58:11.485 --> 00:58:13.347
They are almost absolutely mad

00:58:13.372 --> 00:58:18.570
they are all together, have a party and they are all mad.

00:58:22.237 --> 00:58:27.134
It may be marriage or marriage procession,
everywhere it is prevalent.

00:58:28.815 --> 00:58:35.976
Now the person who works

00:58:36.001 --> 00:58:40.695
one who thinks of the future, one who is thoughtful

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:44.412
but is devoid of love towards everyone

00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:48.150
has no feeling of love, he is also in trouble.

00:58:48.762 --> 00:58:54.672
Because  the devotee of Rama

00:58:55.337 --> 00:58:59.875
there is no whereabouts of Hanumanji.

00:59:03.598 --> 00:59:08.616
If you are a great worker

00:59:08.843 --> 00:59:10.849
you are a well to do person, a nice person

00:59:10.886 --> 00:59:13.724
but you don't have love for anyone

00:59:15.707 --> 00:59:18.151
it won't work.

00:59:19.277 --> 00:59:22.910
You have to love everyone

00:59:23.763 --> 00:59:25.526
and that is why

00:59:25.681 --> 00:59:30.556
Christ has said ,"Forgive everyone."

00:59:30.747 --> 00:59:34.910
Who are you not to forgive?

00:59:35.495 --> 00:59:37.765
You yourself are not Hanumanji.

00:59:38.026 --> 00:59:42.597
Yes, Hanumanji is with you and He is an ideal for you

00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:51.588
that He on the basis of His devotion
has attained this high position.

00:59:53.691 --> 00:59:58.620
Wherever there is heat, people's brains get upset

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.848
and the bond of love gets disrupted.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:12.086
Every body should salute such Hanuman devotee, Shri Bajrangbali

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:20.827
and should understand that whatever powers
we have got from Sahaja Yoga

01:00:20.852 --> 01:00:23.554
we should keep in balance.

01:00:26.953 --> 01:00:29.176
Love is such a thing

01:00:29.201 --> 01:00:36.844
that you can win over great personalities with the bond of love.

01:00:39.915 --> 01:00:42.652
I go on doing the same

01:00:42.677 --> 01:00:45.839
because I have to face strange people.

01:00:46.536 --> 01:00:51.882
Now handle them with such a trick of love that they will be ok.

01:00:52.685 --> 01:00:54.843
Once I went somewhere.

01:00:54.882 --> 01:00:59.098
There was a famous but very short tempered saint;

01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:02.124
All of them are very short tempered.

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:04.198
Then I climbed up and went there.

01:01:05.126 --> 01:01:09.432
He was shaking his neck in anger.

01:01:09.631 --> 01:01:17.650
Because he was egoistic that he could control rain.

01:01:18.149 --> 01:01:22.054
And as I climbed up and reached

01:01:22.205 --> 01:01:25.016
I was drenched completely wet in rain.

01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:29.447
Now, he was sitting in great anger.

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:32.295
I sat in his cave.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.284
He came and sat

01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:36.281
He was very angry.

01:01:36.306 --> 01:01:39.730
I asked,"What happened, even if I got wet?"

01:01:39.755 --> 01:01:48.532
He said, "You did not stop the rain to take away my ego.

01:01:48.557 --> 01:01:50.403
Because I can stop it.

01:01:50.428 --> 01:01:52.489
I had this ego."

01:01:52.514 --> 01:01:54.435
"There is nothing like that."

01:01:54.606 --> 01:01:59.737
I said,"You are a Saint and you have purchased a saree for Me.

01:02:00.204 --> 01:02:06.415
I cannot take anything from a saint.

01:02:06.646 --> 01:02:09.483
And you cannot give Me anything.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.056
Then I thought it is better to get wet
nd I will have to accept it."

01:02:15.911 --> 01:02:17.509
Because of that

01:02:17.534 --> 01:02:21.988
tears came out of his eyes and he fell down at My feet.

01:02:22.726 --> 01:02:26.145
I said, ‘what should I have done?
I had to just get wet.

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:29.453
Otherwise I too would not have accepted it.

01:02:29.478 --> 01:02:31.367
I said that it is better to get a little wet

01:02:31.392 --> 01:02:33.003
then I will have to accept it’.

01:02:34.323 --> 01:02:36.563
Then he said, "Is it so?"

01:02:36.588 --> 01:02:41.172
I said you have purchased a peach coloured saree for Me

01:02:41.197 --> 01:02:43.984
and nauvar (nine yards) this you have done a good thing

01:02:44.009 --> 01:02:49.089
because My petticoat too has got wet, so I can wear this nauvar.

01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:52.465
He was very happy.

01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:55.868
So, love is such a thing

01:02:56.043 --> 01:03:00.891
that it brings down to earth even great people fuming with anger.

01:03:02.497 --> 01:03:07.923
There are so many earlier examples of it.

01:03:07.948 --> 01:03:12.971
When they say," Basu"(Sit down),
the whole night will pass like that.

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:16.489
And even now everyday it happens so.

01:03:16.514 --> 01:03:18.821
Talk with love.

01:03:19.717 --> 01:03:21.562
How does it matter?

01:03:21.587 --> 01:03:26.874
If you love others, their good qualities will transmit to you

01:03:27.163 --> 01:03:36.722
and if you hate someone, their bad qualities will transmit to you.

01:03:37.262 --> 01:03:39.725
It is all give and take.

01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:43.684
This person is like this, that person is like that

01:03:43.709 --> 01:03:45.798
whosoever you see is not right.

01:03:47.399 --> 01:03:49.996
It is a custom with so many people

01:03:50.021 --> 01:03:51.492
It is their culture

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.824
that if someone comes to his home

01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:55.819
stays, has his meals and fun and everything is over.

01:03:55.844 --> 01:03:59.764
As soon as he leaves, comments follow that he is such a bad man.

01:03:59.789 --> 01:04:01.291
Next came and sat down

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:02.894
especially among women it is too much prevalent.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.420
He comes and sits.

01:04:05.445 --> 01:04:07.569
You are very nice, very nice and now you can go.

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:09.408
Yes he is like that!

01:04:10.392 --> 01:04:14.723
Oh! this outward love won't work.

01:04:14.896 --> 01:04:20.780
If you shower artificial love, does he not understand?

01:04:21.386 --> 01:04:27.204
You have got the power to love by heart as you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:04:30.026 --> 01:04:35.641
And when you will imbibe this

01:04:36.195 --> 01:04:42.098
when the tree of love will bloom by itself

01:04:42.325 --> 01:04:47.695
you will give joy to others and you too will enjoy its fragrance.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:53.244
Except the ocean of love, you will not like anything.

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:59.891
So, what you have to learn from Bajrangbali is

01:04:59.916 --> 01:05:06.338
His devotion and that power which He has given to you

01:05:06.363 --> 01:05:11.425
that nobody can touch you if your devotion is pure.

01:05:11.871 --> 01:05:13.866
Nobody can touch you.

01:05:13.891 --> 01:05:16.963
There are thousands of such examples in Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:16.988 --> 01:05:19.028
People call these miracles

01:05:19.053 --> 01:05:23.540
but I say that it is Shri Hanumanji's blessing.

01:05:26.899 --> 01:05:33.686
So, now I give My blessings and love to all of you.

01:05:35.509 --> 01:05:39.785
First love yourself and then others.

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:42.009
It doesn't mean my son, my this

01:05:42.034 --> 01:05:42.766
No! No! No!

01:05:43.984 --> 01:05:48.643
It means selfless love.

01:05:48.668 --> 01:05:51.185
Love that expects no return,

01:05:52.245 --> 01:05:55.982
Which has no relation, is limitless.

01:05:56.007 --> 01:06:02.624
Such a power of love has come to you, use it.

01:06:03.855 --> 01:06:06.156
Lots of blessings!

01:07:26.964 --> 01:07:31.554
Anant Aashirvad (Limitless blessings).
