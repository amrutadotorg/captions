00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:06.166
Gauri is the Mother of Shri Ganesha

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:15.333
and She produced Shri Ganesha because

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:19.333
She was having a bath,

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.667
and to protect Her

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.417
chastity She created Shri Ganesha.

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:32.083
In the same way,

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.125
Kundalini is the Gauri

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:43.166
and we have got Ganesha sitting

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:47.542
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.542
So we have Mooladhara as

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:58.583
the abode of the Gauri, of Kundalini,

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:05.166
and the protection of the Kundalini is done by Shri Ganesha.

00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:09.667
As you know, Shri Ganesha is the deity

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:14.750
which is for our innocence.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.583
Only Shri Ganesha could be there in that position

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.500
because as you know the pelvic plexus looks after

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.792
all the excretory functions,

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:37.542
and it is Shri Ganesha only who can really stay there

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:41.250
without getting

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.667
dirtied by the surroundings

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:56.041
He is so pure; He is so innocent –

00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:04.709
while the Kundalini is the virgin,

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.999
the virgin Mother of Shri Ganesha.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:15.792
People have started talking against

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.333
Mary by saying that there was something wrong:

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.750
"How could a virgin get a child?"

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:29.417
Because we do not understand it is God

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:35.208
and in the area of God anything is possible.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.959
They're above all these things

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:44.542
and they can create anything

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.250
and in any way

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:52.625
Ganesha had to be born out of a virgin

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:56.834
because He was so pure.

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:04.500
So Kundalini has to be supported by Shri Ganesha.

00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:07.583
If Shri Ganesha is weak,

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:11.458
then Kundalini cannot be supported.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:17.208
Shri Ganesha has to support Her

00:03:19.542 --> 00:03:22.875
in the awakening part first of all.

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:27.041
When the Kundalini is getting awakened,

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.500
Shri Ganesha stops all the functions

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:34.000
that it has to perform.

00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:36.999
All the functions are stopped

00:03:39.208 --> 00:03:40.792
so that

00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:43.834
you must have seen, I sit for nine hours,

00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:48.083
ten hours sometimes - I don't get up,

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:51.166
because all functions of Shri Ganesha,

00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:55.792
everything stops when the Kundalini is rising.

00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:58.875
She is fully supported

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.625
and looked after by Shri Ganesha.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.792
The Kundalini is the energy that you know

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.542
which gives you your ascent,

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.125
but it's a virgin energy.

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:24.875
It's a energy that is detached;

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:30.250
it doesn't get attached to any center,

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:35.250
to any function.

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.999
Only one function it has to do,

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:41.166
is to

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:46.208
slowly and steadily

00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:53.083
pass through all these centers,

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:57.625
nourish them, give them whatever they like,

00:04:57.834 --> 00:05:00.792
whatever they want, whatever they can bear,

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:05.959
and slowly and steadily open the Sahasrara.

00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:09.375
She is coiled up in three and a half

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.041
coils.

00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:15.291
It has a mathematical significance

00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:19.458
why three and a half coils she is

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:23.000
- I think in My book I have described about her.

00:05:25.208 --> 00:05:26.208
But

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:38.959
though she's a virgin energy,

00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:40.999
still she is so wise,

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:43.000
so sensible,

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:46.583
so loving and so caring

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.041
that when she rises

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.083
She doesn't give any complications to you.

00:05:56.208 --> 00:06:00.250
She doesn't even make you feel that she's rising up.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.667
In some people she does,

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:04.250
when the people are not normal,

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:07.667
and some obstruction is there, then you do feel it;

00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:10.500
but normally

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.417
you do not even feel how she is rising.

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:18.917
She goes up in a way

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.458
automatically,

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:26.667
supported by the whole mechanism

00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:31.375
when she rises from one center to another center.

00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:37.208
The lower center first opens for her to enter in

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:41.542
and then it augments, it closes down

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:44.542
so that it can keep the Kundalini in its place,

00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:46.792
then it goes higher,

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:53.750
there again till it pierces through Sahasrara,

00:06:54.083 --> 00:07:00.041
this ascending of Kundalini goes on.

00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:03.375
This is what is raja yoga.

00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:06.917
That is not artificial,

00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:11.041
something outside, but the spontaneous working

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.834
of the mechanism is raj yoga.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.125
As I always say that when you start the motorcar

00:07:17.417 --> 00:07:20.709
all the mechanism starts working by itself,

00:07:20.917 --> 00:07:22.500
but by just moving the wheel

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:24.417
you cannot make the car move.

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:28.250
In the same way, when the Kundalini is rising,

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:32.959
she rises spontaneously

00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:37.750
and passes through these six centers.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.792
That time she also at Vishuddhi,

00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:49.792
she opens the Vishuddhi

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.959
and when she emerges through it at that time

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:59.291
the tongue is a little bit pulled in

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.458
just to keep the flow on.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.000
This reaction is called as khechari.

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:12.083
So when people are very deeply in meditation,

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:16.125
those who have achieved great heights in meditation,

00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:23.709
they find suddenly they get into khechari situation,

00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:28.333
or we call as mudra, in that state

00:08:31.208 --> 00:08:38.417
as if some nectar starts flowing from your palate.

00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:42.999
If you move your tongue upward like that

00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:48.166
you'll feel the cool coming down your tongue,

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:50.625
try that.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.999
Now this, you don't have to do

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:04.583
when you are in deep meditative state.

00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:07.333
It starts cooling down your tongue slowly

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:12.208
as automatically you get into khechari state.

00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:15.834
As far as Sahaja yogis are concerned today,

00:09:16.041 --> 00:09:18.959
there are very few who really feel that way.

00:09:19.417 --> 00:09:21.999
The reason is you do not meditate.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.709
We do not pay attention to our realization, also.

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:29.500
We talk about it quite a lot, in the West specially

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.500
we discuss it more than to do something about it.

00:09:33.792 --> 00:09:38.458
We have to meditate every day,

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.625
just like washing our hands

00:09:42.834 --> 00:09:45.208
or just like cleaning our teeth,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.750
we have to in the morning-time meditate

00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:50.834
and also in the evening we have to meditate.

00:09:51.041 --> 00:09:53.250
We have to meditate both the times

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.375
otherwise we cannot rise, we cannot grow.

00:09:56.625 --> 00:09:58.875
Just to think that "We are realized souls"

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:00.417
you do not become.

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:04.041
This cleansing has to be done every day,

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.834
every day in an hour.

00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:11.542
And this is why none of the experiences which are described

00:10:11.792 --> 00:10:14.667
are felt sometimes in Sahaja Yoga

00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:16.208
and people ask

00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:19.125
"Mother, how it is that we don't feel the khechari?"

00:10:19.417 --> 00:10:22.000
Because your attention is not also

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.417
there where it should have been.

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:30.333
So one has to try to meditate in such a manner

00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:35.166
that it is working of the Kundalini is facilitated.

00:10:36.375 --> 00:10:39.208
The chakras are cleansed out

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.417
and ultimately you are in a state of meditation.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.458
It's not a question of how to go into meditation,

00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:56.500
but is the question

00:10:58.083 --> 00:11:02.208
how to be in meditation all the time.

00:11:03.583 --> 00:11:06.750
So as you know that Kundalini, when she reaches

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.750
the Agnya Chakra

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:12.625
and when She opens Agnya chakra,

00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:18.417
then you can be in thoughtless awareness,

00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:22.208
then you don't think - thinking just stops.

00:11:22.417 --> 00:11:27.291
You watch everything, just watch,

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:30.792
but you do not get involved into what you are watching,

00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:36.667
but you just watch and that watching itself

00:11:37.917 --> 00:11:40.959
gives you the growth within.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.125
Think of the tree which is, say, in a turmoil or

00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:50.333
during earthquake: it won't grow.

00:11:51.834 --> 00:11:53.750
When the earthquake stops,

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:56.250
everything becomes quiet,

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.000
everything is peaceful,

00:11:58.208 --> 00:11:59.999
then only the tree can grow.

00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:03.166
In the same way, our growth can only take place

00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:06.041
if we are peaceful within ourselves.

00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:12.125
So for a Kundalini growing wider and wider

00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:14.625
and rising higher and higher,

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.583
first thing is we must have

00:12:16.792 --> 00:12:18.999
peace within ourselves,

00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:23.250
but this peace is possible if you can make really

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.000
peace with others.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.083
If you cannot make peace with others

00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:30.667
who are in Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:32.750
who are in the collective,

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:37.208
if you are in a turmoil, this Kundalini can never rise.

00:12:37.792 --> 00:12:41.375
That is why collectivity is so important.

00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:45.625
Without collectivity your Vishuddhi cannot open,

00:12:46.375 --> 00:12:48.208
and without collectivity

00:12:48.458 --> 00:12:53.000
you cannot have the growth of your spirituality.

00:12:54.917 --> 00:12:56.999
It's the growth of the spirituality

00:12:57.208 --> 00:13:01.166
as they say the Tree of Life is upside down

00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:04.166
and the roots are in the brain,

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.792
and this Kundalini has to go and water that brain,

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:12.999
as we water the roots.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.792
Then it starts growing downward

00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:18.583
and that's how you start expanding.

00:13:18.792 --> 00:13:21.583
When you start expanding, then you touch

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:23.834
the depth of your divinity.

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:26.709
And once you have touched the depth of your divinity,

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:31.625
then you start working it out in such a manner

00:13:31.834 --> 00:13:35.917
that people will know that you are yogiji:

00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:38.999
you are people of higher realm,

00:13:39.166 --> 00:13:41.041
you have something great.

00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:45.417
It's not how many times you read something,

00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:48.417
it's not how many times you talk about Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:51.333
it's not even how many times

00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:53.875
you just go on reciting names;

00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:58.041
but how many times from your heart

00:13:58.417 --> 00:14:01.458
your pure desire is to ascend.

00:14:01.709 --> 00:14:04.667
If this pure desire cuts upon you,

00:14:04.917 --> 00:14:07.083
then the first thing and the last thing you'll do

00:14:07.333 --> 00:14:10.375
is to meditate - you can't do without it.

00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:12.999
Even if you try, you can't do without it.

00:14:13.208 --> 00:14:17.000
If you will sleep without meditating, you'll think: "Oh,

00:14:17.583 --> 00:14:19.959
I have not meditated" - not out of guilt,

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:21.959
but "I have missed something,

00:14:22.208 --> 00:14:23.291
I have missed something."

00:14:23.625 --> 00:14:25.208
That should happen to us.

00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:28.917
So this power of Gauri has to be respected

00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:31.000
because she's our mother,

00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:33.166
she's our individual mother.

00:14:33.417 --> 00:14:35.750
She has given us second birth.

00:14:35.999 --> 00:14:39.250
She is the one who knows all about us;

00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:41.875
she's so gentle, so kind.

00:14:42.083 --> 00:14:44.166
How she slowly rises.

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:45.834
She doesn't give us trouble;

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.166
she takes all the trouble of penetrating

00:14:48.417 --> 00:14:52.208
through these centers and she gives us this second birth.

00:14:54.792 --> 00:14:56.959
Because she understands everything,

00:14:57.125 --> 00:15:00.166
she knows everything, she organizes everything,

00:15:00.417 --> 00:15:05.250
she brings forth all the beauty that you are.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.750
Once you start developing that beauty within yourself,

00:15:09.166 --> 00:15:11.917
then you'll be surprised how powerful you are;

00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:15.999
that all these things are of the same nature

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.125
is the truth that you discover,

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:24.208
is the same as the beauty, is the same as the joy.

00:15:24.583 --> 00:15:27.333
You don't have to think that joy is separate,

00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:29.792
truth is different, beauty is different.

00:15:30.041 --> 00:15:32.709
Because we are not yet at that point

00:15:32.917 --> 00:15:35.500
we just take one facet,

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:38.875
but once we reach that point then

00:15:39.375 --> 00:15:42.583
the whole thing seems to be one.

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:47.208
There is no differentiation at all.

00:15:47.625 --> 00:15:49.000
It's all one.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.709
Many facets of a diamond

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:53.333
but it's one diamond

00:15:53.583 --> 00:15:57.250
and that diamond is your self, your spirit.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.125
So today is a very great day,

00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:02.625
we have to thank our, our Kundalini,

00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:05.583
the Gauri for giving us realization

00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:09.041
and to know that we have to every time awaken Her,

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:11.709
every time we have to expand Her,

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:14.333
and every time to worship Her

00:16:14.583 --> 00:16:19.709
so that we always keep our realization intact

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:22.750
and keep our ascent intact.

00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:25.166
It is this ascent

00:16:25.417 --> 00:16:28.999
which is going to transform all the human beings.

00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:32.166
So you have to pray to Her that "keep us pure,

00:16:32.417 --> 00:16:34.792
make us pure." She purifies you,

00:16:34.999 --> 00:16:37.333
Her job is to purify your chakras,

00:16:37.542 --> 00:16:41.542
so "Please purify us, make our hearts clean,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.542
our minds clean, everything clean;

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.375
and ultimately

00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:51.875
keep our connection forever and everlasting,

00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:56.083
so that we feel this beautiful power of God's love

00:16:56.291 --> 00:16:58.208
flowing through us."

00:16:58.458 --> 00:17:01.041
For that, whatever is necessary you will do.

00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:03.166
You will be very much in the collective,

00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:05.083
will sacrifice anything

00:17:05.333 --> 00:17:09.375
and also will try to be very sensible,

00:17:09.583 --> 00:17:11.375
will try to spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:11.583 --> 00:17:14.250
because when you spread Sahaja Yoga like a tree,

00:17:14.458 --> 00:17:16.999
then the depth will grow also.

00:17:17.417 --> 00:17:20.792
But it has to be done with the same beauty

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.959
as the awakening of the Kundalini.

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:32.959
She has not troubled you,

00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:37.875
she has not given any problems to you,

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.583
so from that one has to learn

00:17:43.999 --> 00:17:49.625
that we have to behave in a manner

00:17:52.667 --> 00:17:55.999
the way Kundalini is so gentle,

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.709
so sweet, so nice, so effective

00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:06.208
and she brings our life to some meaning.

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:14.750
She completes the meaning of our life,

00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:18.917
she completes our desires

00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:20.959
and she takes us to a point

00:18:21.125 --> 00:18:23.208
where we start seeing the whole thing,

00:18:23.458 --> 00:18:26.125
the whole universe as one,

00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:28.166
all human beings as one.

00:18:28.417 --> 00:18:30.709
She gives us collective consciousness.

00:18:30.917 --> 00:18:34.999
All this work is done by Kundalini alone.

00:18:35.208 --> 00:18:39.917
Of course, if she does not go to any chakras

00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:42.166
and does not awaken any deity,

00:18:42.375 --> 00:18:44.291
we cannot even have the fruits

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.250
of those chakras being awakened.

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:49.875
So it is all her work, all her ascent,

00:18:50.041 --> 00:18:54.709
all her understanding and wisdom

00:18:54.917 --> 00:18:59.041
which has given us this beautiful state

00:18:59.291 --> 00:19:01.875
that we call ourselves as yogis.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.792
So I would request you all

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.709
to pay attention to your Kundalini,

00:19:07.917 --> 00:19:09.583
try to raise her all the time,

00:19:09.792 --> 00:19:11.875
see that you get your vibrations.

00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:13.875
Also see that,

00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:16.542
not only that you get your vibrations all right,

00:19:16.792 --> 00:19:20.417
but also for others you have a different attitude.

00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:22.291
Do not criticize others,

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.083
do not say anything about how wrong they are,

00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:27.959
but just see how right they are

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:31.291
and what good they are capable of.

00:19:33.083 --> 00:19:37.500
She is a virgin and still so wise.

00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:42.333
In the same way we have to be very wise,

00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:44.875
very sensible.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.041
We cannot afford to waste our time now

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:52.542
because we have to save the whole world -

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.291
is our responsibility.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.750
If we do not now work out even our own chakras,

00:19:57.999 --> 00:19:59.959
we cannot help anyone.

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:04.000
So first of all we must work out our own chakras,

00:20:04.208 --> 00:20:06.959
and then we can help the whole world.

00:20:07.125 --> 00:20:13.834
It's not something like a cult or an organization

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.250
where you just say: "I belong to this cult or this organization.

00:20:17.458 --> 00:20:19.208
So it's all right, I'll be saved by God."

00:20:19.417 --> 00:20:22.166
That's not promised in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.875
There's nothing like a ticket to Heaven.

00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:28.291
It has to be worked out.

00:20:28.542 --> 00:20:31.208
You have to work it out, and work it out

00:20:31.417 --> 00:20:34.375
with full understanding as to what is

00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:39.500
this Kundalini is and how she works.

00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:42.542
May God bless you.

00:27:33.959 --> 00:27:37.083
Now the, it is the leaders have to wash My hands.

00:34:48.083 --> 00:34:49.417
Now we’ll have to have fourteen ladies –

00:34:49.667 --> 00:34:52.041
not seven or six, but at least eight ladies,

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:56.250
if you can manage. How many married ladies are there?

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:20.792
She will put the line for you, then we’ll start.

00:35:24.417 --> 00:35:26.250
It should be first going this way,

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.625
because you have to put the line there…

00:38:34.625 --> 00:38:37.709
Shri Mataji, would you like us to sing “Hansata Ali”?

00:38:46.959 --> 00:38:50.417
I think sing one, one in between somewhere there,

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.458
because she’s still dying that foot.

00:38:53.667 --> 00:39:00.875
Let’s sing this one, “Adi Ma” - “Adi Ma”.

00:39:01.542 --> 00:39:03.750
So come along now.

00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:57.041
From My purse just give the ….

00:41:51.166 --> 00:41:52.959
Now, what else ….

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.166
May God bless you.

00:44:24.417 --> 00:44:26.083
The other way round, I think.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.458
All right? It’s all right.

00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:40.875
Will you read the Horoscope for them?

00:47:33.208 --> 00:47:40.625
Must clean up … Girls can wash it out with clean …

00:47:59.166 --> 00:48:03.709
Horoscope is read

00:48:04.291 --> 00:48:06.250
Dharmasthana.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:50.041
Dyankaraka - means that gives you the knowledge,

00:48:50.999 --> 00:48:52.834
knowledge on your central nervous system

00:48:53.041 --> 00:48:56.999
as well as knowledge on your mental level.

00:49:05.917 --> 00:49:08.291
“Different quantum”: quantum aunsha.

00:49:08.583 --> 00:49:11.583
Also means “part”, is quantum.

00:49:49.792 --> 00:49:50.834
And also it’s complete.

00:49:51.041 --> 00:49:53.417
They are saying that they’re aunsha Avatara.

00:49:53.625 --> 00:49:54.999
That means that’s part of Me.

00:49:55.208 --> 00:49:58.417
But in My case it’s all completed.

00:49:58.667 --> 00:50:01.583
I mean, it’s really fantastic …

00:50:25.875 --> 00:50:27.542
That’s like the cycle.

00:53:15.208 --> 00:53:20.000
Fifth, fifth - Sahasrara Day.

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:20.542
That’s what I’m hoping.

00:54:49.125 --> 00:54:52.750
I was born also on Wednesday!

00:56:22.375 --> 00:56:24.667
Masses, must be.

00:56:36.083 --> 00:56:38.667
The last bit, you could read that …

00:56:44.834 --> 00:56:46.999
Yes, continue, continue.

00:57:24.083 --> 00:57:29.542
Nishkalanka - Kalki.  Nishkalanka. Nishkalankara.

00:57:38.583 --> 00:57:41.542
Is the incarnation of Nishkalanka.

00:58:14.583 --> 00:58:16.792
You will have to make copies of this.

00:58:16.999 --> 00:58:19.667
Maybe you’d better, everybody should have his own copy.

00:58:19.875 --> 00:58:23.959
Whenever they need it, then they can read it.
