00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.400
Life! It’s stupidity, no?

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.160
That’s why. You say,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.640
“Oh stupidity, Mr. Ego is coming back.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.720
Now I’m not going to fall a prey to it”.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.520
It will go away.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:19.329
If you make fun of it, it will go away.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:19.360
Hanuman has helped, I must say.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.880
He is the killer of ego.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.400
Ah. You see? He plays all monkey’s

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.960
tricks to kill your ego.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.240
You know Ravana, burnt his tail.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.240
So he burnt the whole Lanka,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:54.480
and Ravana didn’t know what to do.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.738
So at least, thanks God, with Sahaja

00:00:57.738 --> 00:01:09.615
Yoga, everyone starts seeing it, I think.

00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:09.638
Otherwise, how can you?

00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:09.666
Because it’s a very subtle

00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:13.920
ego pampering stuff, you see.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.960
That’s why people don’t want

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.000
to leave it, you see.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.080
Shri Ma, I’ve wondered if you need

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.240
this slogan at all.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.120
This slogan for Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.200
I’m not this up, but I don’t know

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.960
what do you think to it.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.480
Before Realization, the 3 acceptances

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.600
would be: the Holiness Shri Mataji,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.520
accept the experience

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.160
and accept your Self.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.960
It would be the three acceptances.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.800
Baba, you are just hitting

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.400
everybody’s ego by that.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.320
Before Realization, nobody will come,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.040
as it is, nobody is coming.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.095
If you say, ‘accept Shri Mataji’

00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:03.520
that’s the reason they won’t accept.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.320
After Realization, the three ‘Vs’

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.760
have become veneration.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.320
Hum?

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:18.707
Veneration, Vibration, Ventilation.

00:02:18.707 --> 00:02:18.720
This is good.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.800
Remember the three ‘Vs’

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.880
then Victory is ours. Jai Mataji.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.560
That one was very good.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.920
But the first one, if you say it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.120
before Realization,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.800
nothing before Realization.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.480
Everything after Realization.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.160
Yes, just after Realization.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.600
So, if you remember the three ‘Vs’,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.720
Veneration, Vibration, Ventilation.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.920
Hum. That’s very good.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.680
Is it?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.640
You write this.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.840
You send this to the magazine.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.240
Yes, I did send it to India, actually.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.040
I didn’t hear any more about it.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.560
Hum?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.640
I did send it to India but I didn’t say

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.360
to put it in magazine.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.920
But when I wrote back to mister Lal—

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.280
no, no, it was when I wrote to the…

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.400
asked about the magazine.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.080
Because I asked to have it

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.360
sent direct to me from Delhi.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.480
Because I wanted to get

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.920
some of the back numbers.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.224
And I wrote it just then.

00:03:26.224 --> 00:03:26.240
And that was it.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.200
I didn’t hear any more about it.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.375
Now send him, with my signature.

00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:36.392
Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:38.480
May God bless you.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.000
Actually, Gavin was so bright.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.040
I just sent something, and this C.K.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.120
Sharma made a big mess out of the whole thing.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.880
So Gavin was so angry. He said,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.920
“Mother, I’m not going to write

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.400
anything now, whatever”.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.440
I said, “But doesn’t matter.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.880
Now let’s see it again”.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.480
I said, “He just changed the whole thing,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.920
made such a mess”.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.353
He doesn’t understand English even.

00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:04.880
He was very angry.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.800
But I said, “Now you forgive him.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.440
That’s it”.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.880
But ultimately, that Sharma

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.872
turned out to be such a fool, you see.

00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:15.280
Did you read the letter sent to Sharma?

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.160
No, I didn’t, Mother.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.840
Did you shoot?

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.560
Yes.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.120
That would have been better.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.720
If you had read the,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.560
you would have been happy.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.240
I read the letter that came round,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.080
because I received a copy of that letter.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.240
Hum?

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.000
I received a copy of that letter,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.920
but I only just started to read it.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.080
Gavin had done a very good job on that.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.400
One by one.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.480
Yes. I did write that part of the letter

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.800
that you asked me to write through Gavin.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.520
Now, that’s all right.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.840
But this one is another one,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.880
which CP has given him.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.800
A thing that, you know, when a person

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.600
starts going down,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.840
it starts ruining the person.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.520
You can see the effects of that everywhere.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.520
Everyone starts talking about it.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.920
Absolutely. And the whole thing

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.360
comes to a boiling point.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.760
About everyone. It happens like that.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.720
When one person gets down.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.400
Yes. Whatever is the situation, you see.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.560
Because Sahaja Yogis start seeing it,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.000
then the communication starts.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.840
Because, you see, whatever is

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.240
a Brahmin is a Brahmin.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.600
It’s just, whatever is gold is gold.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.560
And if something goes wrong with it,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.920
then you know what.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.200
And when somebody gets sick like that,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.480
you start seeing, talking about it.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.320
About this Sharma, I guess, just imagine,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.800
before he broke out,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.080
here the people were fed up,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.120
because whatever they wrote –

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.640
you wrote something, isn’t it?

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.356
Yes, Hester and I wrote something about it.

00:06:03.356 --> 00:06:05.440
But it came out, indubitably.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.960
So, this is what they told Me.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.160
Oh.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.560
And I’m very unhappy about it. I said,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.360
“They should have ought to sue us”.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.920
The way they were. Then, I went to India,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.200
there was a discussion about,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.400
“Why he’s charging so much

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.512
to London Sahaja Yogis?”

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.520
I said, “Not that’s so much

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.080
and this and that”.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.960
Then, these people in Delhi also said,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.600
“He’s taking lot of these advertisements.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.760
What is he doing about the money?

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.240
We have not seen the accounts or anything”.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.320
All this was brewing up, you see.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.360
But I said, “Let it be.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.640
It doesn’t matter. He has no job.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.440
Doesn’t matter. Doesn’t matter,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.320
if you work it out, I don’t know, sort of “.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.680
I gave him a little hint that,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.960
“You be careful about.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.880
Now you don’t spend here and there.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.480
And I’m also in New York. All right, sir?”

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.560
You see, these things start talking,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.000
whatever is nonsensical secret,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.760
start bringing up in the collective being.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.640
Because it comes as a

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:32.882
foreign matter in the body.

00:07:32.882 --> 00:07:32.902
And everybody feels,

00:07:32.902 --> 00:07:32.933
everybody starts talking on it.

00:07:32.933 --> 00:07:32.960
I saw it with Marcus, also.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.560
Everybody starts feeding ego, everywhere.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.640
In this side, that side, that.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.240
And the explosion came when there was

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:50.000
nobody I had taken back.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.960
I allow you to do it.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.040
Because if I say that,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.880
“Love would be like this,

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.160
it will become a religion”.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.080
So let the whole thing boil up.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.067
And then let the person see.

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:08.880
Same with Christoph.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.240
I mean, so many people told me

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.200
about Christoph.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.880
I talked to him also in a way

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:32.138
that he should understand.

00:08:32.138 --> 00:08:32.160
But there’s no love.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.840
I don’t understand what is hot,

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:48.560
cold food, everything. Just I’ll have.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.200
It blows up. It’s like the body, you know.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.520
In the body there’s a sickness,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.280
when you start feeling it,

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.840
reporting starts coming.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.160
It’s like a sickness, you see.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.280
And it works out that way.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.520
I’m just saying how things work out.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.200
Like this Ike Sharma. You see,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.120
in the beginning, he was nice.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.160
I mean, he’s a nice man.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.960
Otherwise, nothing wrong.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.662
But he didn’t ever got Realization also,

00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:21.680
of all the things.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.480
And like a sickness, you know,

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.920
in the collective being it comes in,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.640
somebody like that.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.120
Don’t sit in the thing. It’s still draft.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.880
Why don’t you close it?

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.240
And then, when I went to Delhi,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.800
everybody, it’s here only.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.720
First of all these people wrote something,

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.920
David wrote something,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.309
Gavin wrote something.

00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:53.840
But Hester told Me about your writing, that,

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.320
“Something nonsensical has come up”.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.360
Then Gavin told Me,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.040
“I’m not going to write.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.442
anything on you.

00:10:00.442 --> 00:10:01.680
Then I wrote it down.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.000
I showed it to you. I sent it there.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.240
And you still entirely thought

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.760
of something nonsensical.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.360
I’m very angry”.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.960
So I said, “All right, doesn’t matter.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.000
We’ll talk to him”.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.040
Then the question came up,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.080
“Why is he charging so much to us, money?”

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.240
Why shouldn’t he charge

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.680
the same as he’s charging there?

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.560
And only posting he can take from us”.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.480
Then in Delhi also they told Me—

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.680
I mean, everybody was telling

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.400
something like that.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.200
In Delhi they said,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.240
“He’s taking so much money

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.200
for advertisements”

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.160
and “You must say something Mother to him.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.440
He’s taking quite a lot of money

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.400
for advertisements

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.520
and he’s not showing any accounts properly.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.800
So he must take proper accounts”.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.080
I still allowed it to you.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.640
I talked to him. You see, I told him.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.840
I told him that there’s

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.960
something going wrong with you.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.000
Everybody is feeling it.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.800
You’d better do some justice to yourself.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:59.680
Instead of understanding, he went on.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.440
And now he is out of circuits.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.520
Not only, but he’s funny.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.440
It always happens like that.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.240
With Rustom, also, same thing happened.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.600
When he came, everybody told Me that,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.240
“He’s like this”.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.680
And the people whom he liked

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.880
were all nonsensical people.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.840
Like one of them was

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.200
the person from America.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.160
I told him, “Why are you

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.080
keeping him there, free? Why?”

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.040
“He’s all right, Mother.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.760
He’s quite good”.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.240
Because he used to pamper his ego, you see.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.520
I said, “No, he’s troublesome.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.160
He’s got very bad relations”.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.240
He had a fight with David Baxter.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.640
He had and that thing.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.160
He told David Baxter that,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.840
“I’m an incarnation of primordial…”.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.317
He came and told”.

00:11:44.317 --> 00:11:46.240
He said, “Is it true?”

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.080
I said, “I’ll ask him”.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.880
“Is it true, Mother?”

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.160
I said, “No, it is not.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.200
But I’ll ask him why did he say so”.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.440
Like that, you know, so many cases.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.520
And then he said, “I’m in charge here”.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.840
But the worst I’ve heard was that

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.680
he changed the mantras.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.200
Like I say, “Aham Sakshat”.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.320
He used to say “Aham Sakshat”.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.504
This was the best part of it.

00:12:13.504 --> 00:12:13.520
Can you imagine?

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.157
And how he dominated people, ‘bapre’!

00:12:16.157 --> 00:12:17.440
He dominated.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.320
Then he started learning the mantras.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.080
He thought that by learning mantras,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.760
he’ll be able to overpower him.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.760
So he learnt all the mantras.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.120
Rajesh started doing the same.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.000
I got such a fright.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.400
I told him, “Don’t learn mantras”.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.200
It’s a very tricky ground you are walking in.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.400
It’s a very tricky ground.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.920
So one has to be careful.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.920
You can destroy yourself completely,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.880
though you are saints.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.720
I mean, definitely, Rustom is

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.960
a very great saint, you see.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.240
But like a fool he just—

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.520
you see, this is the last—

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.400
temptation, is the word.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.480
These are all temptations in life.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.000
Ego. Others temptations are there,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.800
like sex, this, that.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.120
In India, the main temptation

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.160
is not so much sex,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.760
because they are, from childhood, you see,

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.160
we have a...

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.760
But the main is money. The embezzlement.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:23.360
Embezzlement, this is nowadays,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.040
of large amounts.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.520
Like this Mr. Lal. He embezzled

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.720
a lot of money.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.480
So, I had to donate some money.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.680
I wanted to donate out of

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.600
my personal money, some...

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.840
So, I took out twenty-one thousand

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.480
rupees from my account.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.320
I mean, cash I brought it out from the bank.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.200
But I said, “Look, instead of Me

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.400
donating all that,

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.160
I’ll ask, you see, some Sahaja Yogis

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.800
who cannot pay, to donate”.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.542
So, I gave them one thousand and one,

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:06.000
thousand and one, to several people.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.970
I asked them to donate.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:08.000
No, seventeen thousand, sorry,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.720
not twenty-one thousand, seventeen thousand.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.268
And five thousand, I donated

00:14:15.268 --> 00:14:22.320
in the name of my account.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.653
I have given seventeen thousand.

00:14:23.653 --> 00:14:27.064
So twenty-two thousand, it becomes, isn’t it?

00:14:27.064 --> 00:14:29.520
Seventeen thousand, twenty-two thousand.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.920
And then, I gave—because it was

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.640
from the bank.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.120
So, you see, bank is such a simple thing,

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.120
isn’t it, to take out the money,

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.040
give money to people to donate,

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.440
to fourteen people I gave money.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.280
All right, first of all, to see.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.000
And I asked them to put money

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.480
in the bank pockets.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.000
I’ll give it to them.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.120
I think I should get it, I guess.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:04.480
In the presence.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.200
It is recorded.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.832
So how did you sleep last night?

00:15:09.832 --> 00:15:10.960
I slept very well.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.800
Very well. You got it very well.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.320
How are you?

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:23.356
I’m fine, Shri Mataji.

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:23.920
You didn’t come yesterday.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.800
Sorry, no, I didn’t come.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.120
No, you were not.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.080
What’s your name?

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.680
Did you go to TM or something?

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.760
Yes. But not for very long.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.600
I haven’t been for months.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.800
Not much. No.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.400
You too didn’t go much, isn’t it?

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.280
Did you, yourself?

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.120
Yes.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.480
How many years?

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.400
Well, I did it for about three years.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.080
Three years.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.560
But I didn’t do the studies.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.120
I didn’t do the...

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:19.120
Did you also go to TM?

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.160
Really? How many years?

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.520
Only, one year.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.160
How many?

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.920
One year. One year.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:33.520
I went to see some person who is holy,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.600
and I told them the mantra,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.280
and I had prayers said over me,

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.840
because I don’t like what was happening

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.680
to me when I was meditating.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.040
What was happening?

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.240
Little louder you tell Me.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.480
Strange pictures in front of me

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.720
seemed to be drawing towards…

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.360
Really?

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:07.520
Yes.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.640
Experience should be something

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.720
like LSD style, should be,

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.560
the way their style is, you see.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.240
They are putting you on to the,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.160
what we call the supraconscious,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.400
the right-hand side.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.160
So people, sort of who take LSD also,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.440
you see, have the same kind of experiences.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:35.280
And if they see Me also, in the beginning,

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.360
some of the people who have taken LSD,

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.800
they just see light, nothing,

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.400
they can’t see Me.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.960
Most surprising, isn’t it?

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.800
Because even in the other platforms,

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.600
I have seen some people

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.960
suddenly getting stunned, you see,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.080
looking at Me like this.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.200
And you can’t understand,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.040
it goes on the eyes.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.267
And TM people get sometimes

00:17:53.267 --> 00:17:54.480
that kind of experience.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.240
Yes.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.993
About Me also.

00:17:59.993 --> 00:18:02.320
It’s very tricky, very tricky, you see,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.040
because you think

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.960
something unknown is happening,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.000
one starts believing them, you see.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.640
Because you don’t know

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.720
from where it is coming, what it is.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.160
You don’t know really, I mean,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.360
you don’t know where you stand

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.080
with everything, isn’t it?

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.440
So you just go on like

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.560
a under blanket movement.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.560
You just go on and on and on.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.960
Like Marcus did.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.880
He was with them for twelve years

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.840
and he said,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.840
“Mother, I did it very ardently

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.880
with complete faith.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.960
And I just said that, ‘This is the way,

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.000
and I must find out,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.120
must be something wrong with me

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.800
that I’m not achieving’ “.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.280
And they said,

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.480
“We didn’t know where we were going”

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.440
Until they develop epilepsy.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.560
Epilepsy.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.448
Most of them end up with epilepsy.

00:18:46.448 --> 00:18:52.320
I haven’t got epilepsy, I’m fine.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.800
But they used to faint on the street.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.920
In India, it’s very common.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.200
But the trouble is, you see,

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.680
they it in secrecy.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.080
So the—to find out whether it is due

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.360
to the same is very difficult.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.560
Once you get into epilepsy,

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.480
you go into mental hospital, all right?

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.320
So you go into mental hospital,

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.280
another person goes into

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.080
the mental hospital.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:12.960
But you don’t know there’s

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.960
a relationship existing

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.120
because it’s a secret.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.360
By the time you discover,

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.160
you’re already in it.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.240
Yes.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.360
Three of them got epilepsy in crossway,

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.440
three of them, very seriously.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:40.480
And that’s how they started to discover it.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.200
Though he has earned sufficient money now,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.720
he’s not interested.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.626
He’s got sufficient money to live

00:19:48.626 --> 00:19:54.480
and get there and he’s not interested much.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.160
There was another girl who came

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.342
to see Me in London.

00:19:57.342 --> 00:20:00.941
I mean, she’s in a daze, completely.

00:20:00.941 --> 00:20:02.880
She’s… I mean, she’s really dreaming.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.520
And she doesn’t know

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.480
what she’s talking about,

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.840
and very incoherent,

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.680
just like a mad person.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.760
And I believe she is of a very rich family

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.880
and most of her money has been donated.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:24.320
I have pity her.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.760
I think he’s the dragon

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.760
describing the Bible.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.018
It’s so simple.

00:20:33.018 --> 00:20:33.034
Why? Your money.

00:20:33.034 --> 00:20:34.960
While Indians are—as, you see,

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.400
you people are more sort of

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.240
sex-oriented and things like that,

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.200
more emotional type,

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.160
but Indian people are more money-minded.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.360
They want money.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.320
They want more money

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.120
and more money and more money.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.880
They say that to get more people,

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.822
they need the money to attract the people.

00:20:51.822 --> 00:20:51.840
I beg your pardon?

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.800
They say that they need the money

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.760
to attract more people.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.840
For what he uses that?

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.320
Sorry?

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.920
He uses the money himself.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.480
You see, you must have

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.280
some explanation, isn’t it?

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.560
Because whatever one does,

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.840
this is one of the explanations,

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.680
but he uses the money himself.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.920
He has a bed full of diamonds.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.720
This is all your money.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.800
If you attract people through money,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:21.280
such people are useless for any good work.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:26.000
Don’t you think so?

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.480
Please, speak very slowly.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.480
What is it?

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.880
She questioned why they ask for money,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.960
if there was truth.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.120
Yes, that’s it! It’s a simple thing.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.068
You do not sell truth in the market,

00:21:52.068 --> 00:21:52.080
do you know?

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.400
To attract people, you must have truth.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.840
What’s the use of attraction of people?

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.880
I mean, ultimately

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.640
what have you got to be?

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.160
That’s the point, isn’t it?

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.240
Attract for what?

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.498
Have you heard of Mentmore?

00:22:07.498 --> 00:22:07.502
Hum?

00:22:07.502 --> 00:22:08.000
Have you heard of Mentmore?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.992
Oh, I’ve heard of all of the.

00:22:11.992 --> 00:22:14.160
No, but they bought it.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.680
And some people go down for six months

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.720
and they just do advanced programs.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.960
But they’re very good.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.480
They do it in a very…

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.560
What program have they done? Nothing.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.320
What more can they do? Nothing.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.840
But they think they’re doing good.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.840
You see, because they’re mesmerized,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.040
because, you see, this is ego satisfaction,

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.360
you see, that, “We are paying for it”.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.120
That’s the human nature.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.080
If you pay for something,

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.600
say, you go to a psychologist,

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.440
but you are paying for the one

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.360
who sits down there.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.960
And you have to justify it somehow,

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.200
that, why are you there, you see?

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.840
They’ve done no good. They cannot do.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.680
Because one thing you must find out,

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.960
as I said yesterday,

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.880
what powers have you got of your own?

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.920
Do you know where you are,

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.080
whether it is good or bad?

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.360
Only, because you feel happy.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.280
I mean, as I said to you yesterday,

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.800
you can feel happy in a pub,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.800
but is it doing good to you? No.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.600
You may feel happy with the smoke, you see.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.280
But is it good for you? It is not.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.720
You see, happiness is not

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.720
the thing that determines it.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.120
Mostly happiness is a quality of ego

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.960
that just makes you feel very happy.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.000
It’s not joy.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.920
I mean, it’s so absurd, you can’t imagine.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.680
There was a fellow who was doing this.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.280
What was the friend of yours who died

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.680
while doing these siddhis?

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.840
His name was...

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.440
He was doing TM with siddhis.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:41.920
His name was...

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.600
Yes. Yes.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.240
And he was doing ‘siddhis’ and he was,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.400
you see, trying to fly mostly.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.457
He was doing siddhis even when he died,

00:23:52.457 --> 00:23:52.480
he collapsed with that.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.240
And he died.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.360
Still the wife says,

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.880
“It’s nice, now he’ll go to heaven”.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.073
Now what to do to such fools?

00:24:00.073 --> 00:24:01.760
It’s foolish. It’s stupid.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.120
You know, ten years later,

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.040
people will be laughing at you.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.400
Your children will be laughing at you,

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:12.480
“Our parents were trying to fly”. Why?

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:20.000
What is the wisdom?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.520
Instead of seeking your Spirit,

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:30.560
why should you seek this thing?

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.600
These are ‘paroksha’, it means outside.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.320
Whatever you see, whatever you hear,

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:17.440
is all knowledge outside, not inside. Yes?

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.480
Yes.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.720
But what you know is, inside is,

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.400
that you know this is hot, this is cold,

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.920
this is subjective knowledge.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:29.995
Yes. Last night I read photocopies

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:31.360
of a piece of writing

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.520
that Dara had from your meeting,

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.680
and it said that, “If you do TM,

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.680
it’s past lives you’re encountering.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.280
You’ll start a regressing”.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.280
A regressing.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.000
Yes, you encounter these past lives.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.880
No, if you do TM, you see, what happens,

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.800
you go to the supraconscious area.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.120
Then, supraconscious area is an area

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.320
where all the ambitious people have died,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.360
living there.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.040
Like Hitler is there.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.040
I mean, I’ve put the last on that,

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.163
is Hitler.

00:26:03.163 --> 00:26:03.280
He is living there.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.920
So these spirits, they overpower you.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.600
You become over-ambitious,

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.590
you start being too much of work,

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.360
you start becoming speedy.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.600
TM people become very speedy,

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.440
and the whole thing starts

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.480
a process of too much thinking.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.480
For the time being, you may be here.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.440
But then, just like speeding up, you see,

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.840
and then, just you go down.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.745
All your nerves are broken,

00:26:27.745 --> 00:26:30.080
because of the spirit that possesses you.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.480
Growth is only possible if you grow,

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.240
not through parasites. Isn’t it?

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.840
You have to grow yourself.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.760
Now what is the way of growth?

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.640
In nature, you have to germinate.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.320
Unless and until there is germination,

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.440
you cannot grow. There is no growth in it.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.800
There’s no growth of awareness.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.626
Whatever you were, you are today,

00:26:54.626 --> 00:26:54.640
just the same.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.400
On the contrary, you are worse now.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.276
You see my point? This is...

00:27:01.276 --> 00:27:01.840
You should see that,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.280
how to tell them about it.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.320
It’s the growth.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.200
It’s a living thing

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.640
that should happen to you.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.800
And these experiences are dead experiences,

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.160
have no meaning as we

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.120
do not relate to them.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.560
You just see, they are away from you.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.920
You don’t know how to manoeuvre them,

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.800
how to get them.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.760
They are just there.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.600
I mean, you can get it with even LSD,

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.560
the same experiences.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.720
For example, you start seeing an eye,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.600
you start seeing all kinds of things

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.320
and all that.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.640
But it’s a hallucination.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.000
What can you do about it? Nothing.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.120
You cannot manoeuvre it.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.880
Like seeing a TV.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.560
When you can’t do anything about the TV

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.160
program when you are watching it. Can you?

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.640
Yes. Turn it off.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.600
Turn off. That’s all!

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.960
That’s the only thing you can do.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.680
I never had any experiences like that.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.120
You didn’t get.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.240
I just felt relaxed.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.560
And just, then I started to think

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.280
that I wasn’t worried enough,

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.680
I wasn’t close enough to dare inside.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.040
But I didn’t feel unpleasant

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:03.880
or I didn’t feel…

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.040
No, see now, even the,

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.560
how you feel relaxed about it.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.000
It took away the nervous tummy

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.960
that I used to have.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.280
Hum?

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.200
I used to have a nervous stomach

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.760
and it went away with TM.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.160
That’s the – are you seeking only that?

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.000
Well, that was all I was.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.560
I just thought it was a relaxation method.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.960
No, you should not think of relaxation.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.960
You should not think of these cheap things.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.400
Anybody can take away your tummy;

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.720
little exercise can take away.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.200
You know what was happening really?

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.520
It was somebody who took over

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.760
from you the responsibility.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.160
You felt relaxed, but you are speeded.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.080
By speed you lost that.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.440
You can become very thin doing TM,

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.360
because you are working under pressure.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.106
Somebody else is riding.

00:28:51.106 --> 00:28:51.116
You see...

00:28:51.116 --> 00:28:51.120
Hum?

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.400
I was doing TM.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.943
I was very, very thin with TM.

00:28:58.943 --> 00:28:58.960
What did she say?

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.705
I became very thin when I was doing TM.

00:29:02.705 --> 00:29:03.440
Yes, you will, naturally,

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.120
because you are riding a double horse,

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.600
you see.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.520
It’s a, it’s somebody else, you see,

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.240
who makes you run.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.520
That’s one thing happens to you,

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:22.632
you become very, very thin. Very thin.

00:29:22.632 --> 00:29:25.200
I mean, you become exhausted.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.080
And you become extremely speedy.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.240
Thought, you cannot stop.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.360
Think like man.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.160
Yes, that’s true.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:36.720
Huh?

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.680
That’s very true.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.720
Isn’t it? This is it. See for yourself.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.800
I have seen TM people like,

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.920
when they came first to Me,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.440
they were so speedy.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.680
They were talking like telescopically,

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.000
you see:

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.480
the words were going from one to another.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.760
I just couldn’t follow them,

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.160
because they were so speedy.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.040
With such a speed,

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.480
tremendous speed they were talking.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.760
The whole thing was so speedy

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.600
and the thoughts were coming to them

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.440
just like bombardment.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.600
It was—those who have done

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.640
quite a lot of it, like David, Ian.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.400
Ian, what was his surname?

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.400
Sridhar.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.440
All of them, how they were talking.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.200
I just didn’t understand.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.440
I said, “Slow down, slow down, slow down”.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.120
I couldn’t understand what they were talking.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.120
Loudly, and with a great speed.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.720
Every one of you were like that.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.320
Even Hester, you, even, Peter is still

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.200
a little bit, of course,

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.600
sometimes like that.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.880
The worse was Linda.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.680
So many of them came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.520
And they went into such tantrums,

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.520
you can’t imagine.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.040
Did you tell them what happened?

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.560
You should tell them.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.120
One fellow jumped twenty feet.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.000
Just taking my name,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.520
he jumped twenty feet with fear, you know.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.360
And this fellow, Mr. David Plough,

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.160
he was going into contortions

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.040
only on the phone.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:07.840
I didn’t talk.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.000
One of the disciples of, a Sahaja Yogi

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.800
talked to him on the phone,

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.320
and he was going into contortions.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.120
And tremendous heat came out of his body.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.480
And when the Sahaja Yogi said,

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.080
“Are you getting tremendous heat?”

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:18.960
He said, “How do you know?”

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.880
He said, “I can feel it here on my hand”.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:29.600
He was very speedy also.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.160
These are very subtle happenings

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.000
which take place within us.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.240
Till you reach to that explosive stage,

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.800
where you just can’t control anymore,

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.440
then it coils on you

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.880
and then you start thinking.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.360
By that time you are lost.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.400
But as I said yesterday,

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.560
the turnover is good.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.280
Many people come, then they go away.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.120
But this has happened to these people

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.840
because they were very tenacious.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.040
They had all these problems,

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.880
till they continued.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.040
And then they were completely

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.080
flat out, finished.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.360
All money was lost. They were paupers.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.976
Their children were on the street.

00:32:13.976 --> 00:32:14.000
They had nothing to eat.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.840
They sold out their big houses.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:22.720
Everything happened.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.320
It is all prophesied

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.309
that all such false gurus will come.

00:32:28.309 --> 00:32:30.880
It’s all prophesied.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.880
And the first sign is that a person

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.320
who lives on your money is a parasite.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.440
Now supposing I tell you,

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.720
“Come and stay in my house with Me”.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.200
Will you live? No.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.720
You won’t accept such an invitation

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.320
to live with Me freely,

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.280
because you have a self-respect.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.360
But these people have no source of income

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.720
except that what you give them.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.080
And they live like lords.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:58.628
They are not yogis by any chance.

00:32:58.628 --> 00:32:59.800
Mahesh Yogi has also

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.440
a very great weakness for women.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.880
He has given pregnancy to women.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.520
And at least seven women have told Me.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.240
She knows also.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.760
He used to call them in the night

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.080
and have relations with women,

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:24.080
about ten years back.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.048
He was Purudeva.

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:37.052
Hum?

00:33:37.052 --> 00:33:37.086
He was Purudeva. Like Mahesh Yogi.

00:33:37.086 --> 00:33:37.109
This one was here also.

00:33:37.109 --> 00:33:37.495
Purudev is not a spiritual guru.

00:33:37.495 --> 00:33:37.499
Hum?

00:33:37.499 --> 00:33:37.520
Not a spiritual guru.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.040
I mean, he was not as sinister

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.000
as this fellow.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.560
But he was not a good man, neither.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.253
He died of cancer, Mother.

00:33:47.253 --> 00:33:48.960
Yes, yes, his guru.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.680
I’ve read one or two books about him.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.040
And I could see that

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.600
he was not a Realized soul.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.160
He may not be such a sinister fellow

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.480
in this way as I don’t know much

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.120
about his life,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:07.835
but I read his, these things.

00:34:07.835 --> 00:34:08.960
They play all kinds of tricks.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.680
Like he was, he said he was

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.160
the Shankar acharya.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.440
But then refused to be Shankar acharya.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.560
I mean, Shankar acharyas

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.520
are equally the same thugs.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.360
Just like being a pope here.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.235
Shankar acharyas,

00:34:28.235 --> 00:34:31.680
they are not Realized souls, no, no.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.280
Just like your Archbishop of Canterbury.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.200
So even if he was a Shankaracharya

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:37.600
or anything,

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.800
what difference does it make

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.200
in the realm of God?

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:48.160
They are all thugs. All unauthorized.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.080
Just like a cardinal you have,

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.360
he was one of them.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.480
And then he left it

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.720
and he joined these and all sorts of stories.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.160
And one of the Shankar acharyas

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.120
is now making a big umbrella of gold.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.040
And he wants to put diamonds,

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.480
to put on his head.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.120
That umbrella should fall on him nicely.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.520
Of tons weight, one ton weight.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.240
Can you imagine?

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:10.960
Who is going to lift

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:18.080
that umbrella on the head?

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.800
All these ideas come up.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.960
That’s what it is.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.240
You see, falsehood shows itself

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.360
by all these things.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.560
First, they try to hide it,

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.880
but then they either come out as violence,

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.520
or as possessions like Mentmore

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:41.280
or something like that.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.200
I mean, these people could not see it,

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.400
till late, till so late,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.560
how he was pampering their ego.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.800
They were appointed as ministers,

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.040
and they had chairs, you see,

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.440
gilded with gold. Joke!

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.920
And then, they were carried

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.200
with the cars, you see.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.160
Rolls Royce or what?

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.400
Jaguars.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.680
And the car was carried behind them.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.680
And the ego was so pampered that

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.240
they were supposed to wear lined dresses,

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.520
you see, lined these,

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.960
what you call them, these official blue

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.520
or black suits, you see,

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:46.000
with ties and things like that, all of them.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.920
How can you have a course in Divine love?

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.760
How can you? Can you have a course?

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.280
Can you give a course to a flower

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.800
to become a fruit?

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.631
I mean, I just think of a course business,

00:36:58.631 --> 00:37:00.000
you see, I’ve said.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.080
My grandchildren are Realised, you see,

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.680
four of them are.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.120
The youngest one, one brought some paper

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.960
from the school

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.600
and she said, “What’s written in this book?”

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.760
She’s about three or three years.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.760
She was going to a kindergarten school year

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.160
and I see she brought it.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.920
So she said, “What is in this, Grandmother?”

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.520
So I said, ” It’s written here that

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.960
if you can give hundred rupees

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.520
and if you go to a particular hotel,

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.560
you will get your transformation.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.640
And you will get peace and all that”.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.520
So the elder one said,

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.920
“It means Kundalini awakening, isn’t it?

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.206
Otherwise how can you get transformation?

00:37:44.206 --> 00:37:44.230
You cannot transform”.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:45.280
She said, “It means that”.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.120
So she said,

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:54.640
“How can you have a course for that, Nani?”

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:54.675
The name ‘Nani’ is Grandmother,

00:37:54.675 --> 00:37:54.716
“How can you have a course for that?”

00:37:54.716 --> 00:37:57.107
The elder one said.

00:37:57.107 --> 00:37:58.240
So she said, “They are mad people”.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.240
“They must be mad to say

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.400
there can be a course for this”.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.440
The little one of three years old.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.800
So the elder one says,

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.280
“My father has done already fourteen courses

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.080
and his Kundalini has not risen”.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.720
If by doing courses,

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.080
if the Kundalini rises—

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.280
So the girl said, “They are mad,

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:25.520
they are mad “, and she tore off the paper.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.280
You cannot do a course. You see, why?

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.920
It appeals to you people because

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.720
theological college you have got here.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.440
That’s why.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.720
You think if you can be trained in theology,

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.000
you can be trained in this way,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.200
so you think, “We should do a course”.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.720
You see, this is the background.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.200
That’s the reason.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.240
Otherwise, normally,

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.480
nobody would accept such a thing.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.720
So, what sort of...

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:55.988
Hum?

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.560
Apart from the money he has got,

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.320
I mean, what’s, what will become of him,

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.360
eventually?

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.040
Then why don’t you just think of it,

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.960
figure out what should become

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.000
of such a person.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.160
Tell me, what should be

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.480
the punishment of such a man?

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.381
Where will he be? Leave alone money.

00:39:18.381 --> 00:39:19.120
You see, I don’t mind money.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.240
Let it be, there are thugs

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.480
and thugs and thugs.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.320
But to begin with, he was a thief.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.040
To begin with he was a thief.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.480
He run away, as he steeled something,

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:33.920
into forest.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.960
There he met somebody

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.200
who told him all these mesmerisms.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.240
He came out of it after fourteen years

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.920
and he started this.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.960
But doesn’t matter.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.240
Even if he’s a thief, all right,

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.960
he can go to jail and finish with it.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.000
But what he’s doing is

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.520
to spoil your inner being.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.880
This is the greatest sin.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.320
The greatest sin is to spoil

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.560
your inner being.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.720
But why does he want to do that one?

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.120
Because he’s a devil,

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.440
because he is a satanic person.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.160
You see, they let loose all satanic forces.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.760
It’s the work of a...

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.240
They’re all let loose,

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.760
getting loose these things.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.520
You see, why there is so much

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:15.760
criminality these days in the world?

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.640
These people have brought

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.480
these horrible forces

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.240
and anybody who catches them

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:29.680
can be affected.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.440
Why am I doing this?

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.840
Because I want to do God’s work.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.960
Why are they doing it?

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.680
Because they are going to do Satan’s work.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.960
It’s just the same.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.440
Plus, doing that, they can earn money,

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.040
they can have all the ‘fun of life’,

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.280
have lots of women around, everything,

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.280
so why not do it?

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.880
And they do not exhaust at all,

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.080
as I exhaust Myself.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.720
They do not. They just settle down.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.840
Nobody can even meet them

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.520
and talk to them.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:02.240
Very few people have seen his face.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.720
But he gets such dedicated workers,

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:10.880
you see, just under his control.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.360
You saw all the things of mesmerism.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.800
All the satanic forces act together

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.600
and work out.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.600
For example, when he was

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.920
delivering lectures, he,

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.160
when he was nothing, he had not achieved

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.360
anything out of it.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.390
He was on the contrary going down.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:31.040
A hundred people would come

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.440
just to listen to him.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.360
And to listen to Me, how many were there?

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.000
And nobody would question or anything.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.840
Just accept, surrender to his life.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.960
First shot, you have to pay

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.280
three hundred pounds. First shot.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.360
And they would accept it

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.880
without any consideration,

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:59.920
without anything, just accept him.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.280
He made them tell lies.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:08.800
He told this, the chief director

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.080
of that academy,

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.520
to tell people that,

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.320
“You should say that

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.320
you are walking through walls.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.280
You have to tell people”.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.640
And he was so mesmerized,

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.680
he had to tell all sorts of things,

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:28.240
all kinds of lies.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.880
How is it such phenomena are possible?

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.040
Hum?

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.360
Are such phenomena as walking

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.200
through walls really possible?

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.120
Is it possible to walk through walls?

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.560
But people believe it, my child.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.000
But is it possible?

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.280
How can it be? How can it be?

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.920
What you got passes through is your mind.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.360
And mind is carried away by some devil.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.480
You see, all the separation of being,

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.920
fragmentation, you see,

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.440
anybody who is possessed can feel that.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.960
But people don’t know about

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.160
the unknown things, no?

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.520
They don’t know. They don’t know.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.920
This is the problem.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.640
Because they don’t know

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.520
about unknown things,

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.600
they go on asking for something absurd.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.760
And I don’t blame anyone of you,

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.520
because there were three very big

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.720
scientists from America,

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.880
who came to see Me.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.280
And they said, “We want to,

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.440
we want to fly in the air”.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.800
Just imagine! Coming to Me

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.800
of all the persons, you see.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.880
I said, “Why do you want to fly in the air?

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.800
You are already flying.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.760
You have gone to Moon”.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.472
They said, “No, we want to learn that way,

00:43:38.472 --> 00:43:41.520
the way of flying—what you call that,

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.520
astral travel”.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.800
I said, “Astral travel,

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.640
why do you want to do it?”

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.040
I said, “If I tell you that it is done

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.200
through the possession of a spirit,

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.000
will you do it?”

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.440
“Yes”.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.160
“But then you’ll lose all your freedom.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.360
You’ll be a slave”.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.240
“Yes, we don’t mind”.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.000
I said, “But why? Such a great thing.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.240
I mean, why do you think it is so great

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.320
to fly like that, invisibly?

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.800
Why, what is it that makes you feel that way?”

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.360
He said, “Americans are doing, the,

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.320
you know—the Russians are doing

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.240
experimentation on astral travelling

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.520
through parapsychology,

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.800
so we also want to do it”.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.400
I said, “If they are going to Hell,

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:28.080
are you going to go to Hell with them?”

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.920
They said, “No. You must teach us”.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.200
I said, “By the way, who told you

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.360
that I teach all this nonsense?”

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.960
They said, “There is one Patanjali

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:35.840
who told us”.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.440
This Patanjali was a man

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.880
who came to me to get cured

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.320
of this disease he had.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.800
He used to do astral movement and all that,

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.240
and his wife was so frightened,

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.760
because Indians know that

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.760
it is done through ‘bhoot’.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.197
If bhoot comes into you,

00:44:51.197 --> 00:44:53.120
as bhoot means a spirit comes to you,

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.640
you do that automatically.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.640
So I said, “Look at this Patanjali.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.480
Of all the persons whom I have cured

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.440
of this disease,

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:04.240
who worked for six months to get rid

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.680
of this disease from him,

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:12.080
he is sending people to Me for this?”

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.240
Then I asked Patanjali, I said,

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.200
“What do you mean by this?

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.880
Why did you send him over to Me?”

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.840
He said, “What to do?

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:18.880
They were after my life,

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.240
‘Tell me somebody who can

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.280
do astral travelling’”.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.800
He said, “I used to do it,

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.720
but I got myself cured from Mataji”.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.920
They said, “If she has cured you,

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.160
she can put that into us also”.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.360
Just how foolish people are!

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.040
Just see, if I can cure cancer,

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:38.800
I can put cancer back to you?

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.240
People are very stupid and foolish.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.640
This is all ego.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:54.400
It makes a monkey out of human beings.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.914
Just like that.

00:45:55.914 --> 00:45:57.760
It is very simple.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.840
You start seeing your ego

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.000
after Realization.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.160
And you start laughing at it.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.040
Before that you don’t know

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.120
whether you are ego or superego, you see.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.160
But then you start seeing,

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.160
“Oh, this monkey, oh, better”.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:10.800
Then you say,

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.560
“You, Mr. Ego, please keep quiet.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.520
Now I see you clearly”.

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.960
How are you? Better now?

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.840
Much better.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.080
Did you have something to eat?

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.160
No. Yes, I had some toast.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:26.640
Hum?

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.680
I had some toast.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:32.956
You have had.

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:32.960
Yes.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.240
Give him a candle now.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:39.120
You can come here if you want.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:53.280
You can sit here.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.080
Now you’d better have

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.640
your Realization established.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.200
Come along. Sit. Sit like this.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.902
What’s? Your name, you said is Ian.

00:47:01.902 --> 00:47:08.160
Ian, you sit with both the feet like this.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:13.280
Is he better?

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:18.080
Cool.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:33.280
Are you all right? It’s good.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.071
First thing happens is Left Vishuddhi

00:47:36.071 --> 00:47:37.440
catches, because of mantras.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.880
You see, it goes in here.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.880
Such a vicious circle.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.960
Like, it’s a—Vishuddhi, you see,

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.280
when you say mantras, this centre catches,

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.120
left side.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.240
You see, which makes you feel guilty

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.200
all the time within yourself.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.680
A kind of a guilt is built up, you see,

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.560
it makes you feel guilty for everything.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.200
And especially that you are not doing

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.040
your course properly, and this and that,

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.400
you are doing it half-heartedly

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.280
and all that.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.680
It goes on giving you ideas,

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.000
that you are not all right,

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.640
all those things.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.960
And then when you come to Sahaja Yoga also,

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.920
what happens, this is caught up.

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.440
So even if I tell you that,

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.800
“Sir, you have done wrong

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.800
in going to, say, TM”,

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.400
again that comes up there, that guilt.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.920
So it adds up to the guilt.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.440
You see, it’s such a vicious circle,

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.880
you cannot break it.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.760
If I tell you that,

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.240
then you’ll say,

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.320
“Oh, why, I shouldn’t have done it”.

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.720
Now, if I don’t tell you, you won’t realize.

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.240
If I tell you, that’s guilt.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.360
It’s a vicious circle.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.960
If you can break that vicious circle,

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.280
that you are not guilty,

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.440
you have done it in complete

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.880
misunderstanding and innocence.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.400
If you say like that,

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:55.105
immediately it will be cleared out.

00:48:55.105 --> 00:48:59.520
It’s better. Just do it like that.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:09.120
Watch Me, it’s best thing.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.800
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.800
Be comfortable. Be comfortable.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.920
Close your eyes.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.880
And don’t feel guilty.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.440
One thing is,

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.960
you are not guilty of anything.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.560
Whatever you have done, it’s done.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.240
You’ve done it in complete innocence.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.240
Now don’t feel guilty, one thing.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:24.880
All right?

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.480
Whatever I have said, forget it.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.720
I have just told you to explain,

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.920
not to make you feel guilty.

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.760
If you start feeling guilty, that’s it.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:35.520
Otherwise, it will go to ego or to guilt.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.120
Very vicious, it’s a very bad

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:43.200
vicious circle now.

00:49:46.880 --> 00:50:00.366
Better? Just put your hand towards him.

00:50:00.366 --> 00:50:02.600
One hand, right hand towards him, yes.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:24.320
It will work out.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:30.560
Yes?

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.120
This is Callaghan. Callaghan and Jane

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:38.640
and Antonia. They would like to see you.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.800
Hello! You could come,

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.760
I’m so very happy.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:46.137
I just tried to pay attention to you.

00:50:46.137 --> 00:50:46.155
May God bless you.

00:50:46.155 --> 00:50:59.040
Now, can you sit on the ground? All right.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:11.280
She’s all right. Hum?

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.280
What was the mantra you said, Paul?

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.560
I am.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.040
Hum?

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.480
I am.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.640
Then you say Mahakali’s mantra.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.120
You got all right.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:27.431
And, what’s the other one?

00:51:27.431 --> 00:51:32.420
‘Sarva mantra siddhi’

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:32.445
‘Sarva mantra siddhi’

00:51:32.445 --> 00:51:32.471
‘Sarva mantra siddhi’.

00:51:32.471 --> 00:51:34.400
Just try on this lady. Yes.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.000
Noora, Noora?

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.840
Noora, come along, come along.

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:38.720
Bob.

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.080
Yes, hello, Bob. Come along.

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.840
Sit down, sit down. Sit down, sit down.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:47.600
Noora, how did you sleep last night?

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.520
Very well, thank you.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.640
Ha! Yes, both of you were very good,

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.920
she and you.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.720
And all of you are going to be all right.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:59.094
You slept well last night?

00:51:59.094 --> 00:51:59.120
‘Sarva mantra siddhi’,

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.800
just see that mantra.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.947
In the whole, all of you can say,

00:52:02.947 --> 00:52:05.760
it will be a good idea.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:34.800
Om twamewa sakshat

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.280
Shri sarva&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:55.873
mantra siddhi sakshat,

00:52:55.873 --> 00:52:55.889
Shri Adi Shakti,

00:52:55.889 --> 00:52:55.920
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.080
All right?

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:58.880
Now Narakasura.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.400
Now see, they know what mantra

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.520
they are saying,

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.840
what chakras you are catching,

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.280
what is working it out,

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.960
they are feeling it within themselves,

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:10.640
what is related.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.880
This is knowledge.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.000
Now, say ‘Narakasya’.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.800
They know why, this gentleman,

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.880
TM fellow, was called as Narakasura.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.760
He was the one who was slain before

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.880
by the Goddess.

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:31.120
So, if you say that, it was the Goddess

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:36.080
who killed Narakasura, it works.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.120
That means he was Narakasura.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:38.880
That’s the proof.

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.920
The proof of the pudding

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.920
is in the eating of it.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.800
So simple as that. Now say that.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.960
Put your both the feet straight.

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:53.200
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:20.434
Say, ‘Narakasura’.

00:54:20.434 --> 00:54:20.453
Om twamewa sakshat,

00:54:20.453 --> 00:54:20.480
Narakasura mardini sakshat,

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:27.375
Shri Adi Shakti,

00:54:27.375 --> 00:54:45.680
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.840
Better?

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.480
Are you feeling the cool breeze now?

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.120
You see, when we called him

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.560
by that name, Narakasura,

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.600
you started feeling.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:05.520
So, that means he was Narakasura.

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.960
Don’t think about it.

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:10.400
Don’t think, thinking is a curse.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.440
All right?

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:18.400
Are you feeling the cool breeze? Good.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:22.000
You slept well?

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.035
Yes, thank you.

00:55:25.035 --> 00:55:25.040
Good.

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:36.800
She’s all right. What is it?

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:42.470
Are you better now?

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:43.200
Watch Me. Hand is better,

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.600
not shaking so much.

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.000
But shaking.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.440
Is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.520
he better?

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:13.822
Still there, Mother.

00:56:13.822 --> 00:56:13.834
Still there.

00:56:13.834 --> 00:56:13.840
Heart.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.880
She’s all right. She’s better.

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.040
In both the hands

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.200
are you feeling the cool breeze or one?

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.040
Good. Now relax.

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.320
Close your eyes and relax.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:29.480
Just think what you have got.

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:46.179
You just see what came above.

00:56:46.179 --> 00:56:46.240
You’re all right.

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.040
In any way, you should not feel bad

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.800
or embarrassed about whatever

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.440
you have done.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:56.560
That’s all. You are simple people.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.160
Once you think like that,

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:06.800
then everything will be all right.

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:14.208
It’s all right now.

00:57:14.208 --> 00:57:14.240
Better? Then you should believe.

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:18.880
It’s all right. That’s all.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:26.320
Good. She’s very good.

00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:31.600
There’s no rise or anything.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:43.040
Ha! All right?

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:47.920
It again.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:58:03.584
Can you come here? Sit down, please.

00:58:03.584 --> 00:58:05.770
You can put the light down a little bit.

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:11.400
If it is more convenient.

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:30.480
Now. Take it nearer, high, in here.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:22.240
Better?

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:27.360
How is it?

01:00:47.360 --> 01:01:11.760
You say the mantra

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:22.149
‘sarva mantra siddhi’ once.

01:02:22.149 --> 01:02:26.400
Om twamewa sakshat

01:02:28.160 --> 01:03:20.208
Shri sarva mantra siddhi sakshat,

01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:20.259
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:03:20.259 --> 01:03:27.246
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:03:27.246 --> 01:03:27.251
More.

01:03:27.251 --> 01:03:27.269
Om twamewa sakshat

01:03:27.269 --> 01:03:29.204
Shri sarva mantra siddhi sakshat,

01:03:29.204 --> 01:03:29.220
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:29.251
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:29.257
Again.

01:03:29.257 --> 01:03:29.275
Om twamewa sakshat

01:03:29.275 --> 01:03:45.428
Shri sarva mantra siddhi sakshat,

01:03:45.428 --> 01:03:45.478
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:03:45.478 --> 01:03:45.574
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:03:45.574 --> 01:03:45.608
Hum. Again.

01:03:45.608 --> 01:03:45.664
Om twamewa sakshat

01:03:45.664 --> 01:03:55.425
Shri sarva mantra siddhi sakshat,

01:03:55.425 --> 01:04:20.057
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:20.088
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:04:20.088 --> 01:04:20.094
Again.

01:04:20.094 --> 01:04:20.112
Om twamewa sakshat

01:04:20.112 --> 01:04:20.145
Shri sarva mantra siddhi sakshat,

01:04:20.145 --> 01:04:20.161
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:04:20.161 --> 01:04:20.192
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:04:20.192 --> 01:04:20.196
Hum.

01:04:20.196 --> 01:04:20.214
Om twamewa sakshat

01:04:20.214 --> 01:04:20.247
Shri sarva mantra siddhi sakshat,

01:04:20.247 --> 01:04:20.263
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:04:20.263 --> 01:04:20.294
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:04:20.294 --> 01:04:20.300
Again.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:20.318
Om twamewa sakshat

01:04:20.318 --> 01:04:20.351
Shri sarva mantra siddhi sakshat,

01:04:20.351 --> 01:04:20.367
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:04:20.367 --> 01:04:20.398
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:20.404
Again.

01:04:20.404 --> 01:04:20.422
Om twamewa sakshat

01:04:20.422 --> 01:04:20.455
Shri sarva mantra siddhi sakshat,

01:04:20.455 --> 01:04:20.471
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:04:20.471 --> 01:04:20.502
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:04:20.502 --> 01:04:20.513
Hum. Again.

01:04:20.513 --> 01:04:20.531
Om twamewa sakshat

01:04:20.531 --> 01:04:20.564
Shri sarva mantra siddhi sakshat,

01:04:20.564 --> 01:04:20.580
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:20.611
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:04:20.611 --> 01:04:20.622
Hum. Again.

01:04:20.622 --> 01:04:20.640
Om twamewa sakshat

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:20.673
Shri sarva mantra siddhi sakshat,

01:04:20.673 --> 01:04:20.689
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:04:20.689 --> 01:04:20.720
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.600
Now see if&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:45.440 --> 01:06:10.880
it’s come up.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:29.920
You say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:23.120
Sahasrara mantra,

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:23.520
because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:54.000 --> 01:16:06.240
now at the Sahasrara,

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:16.160
it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:38.240 --> 01:17:27.280
is filled with. Better now.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.040
Om twamewa sakshat&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.296
Shri Mahalakshmi,

01:17:59.296 --> 01:18:05.933
Mahasaraswati, Mahakali, Trigunatmika,

01:18:05.933 --> 01:18:07.680
Kundalini&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:19.120
sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti,

01:18:44.160 --> 01:19:06.597
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:19:06.597 --> 01:19:06.635
Om twamewa sakshat Shri Kalki Sakshat,

01:19:06.635 --> 01:19:10.880
Shri Adi&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:40.800
Shakti,

01:19:40.800 --> 01:20:07.545
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:20:07.545 --> 01:20:07.583
Om twamewa sakshat Shri Kalki Sakshat,

01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:07.606
Shri Sahasrara swamini,

01:20:07.606 --> 01:20:07.630
moksha Pradahini Mataji,

01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:07.661
Shri Nirmala Devi, namo namaha.

01:20:07.661 --> 01:20:07.680
Ha. It cleared out.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.360
Now say the Lord’s prayer.

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.560
Don’t close your eyes.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:32.080
All of you should say.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.240
Again

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:29.120
Are you all right, Bob?

01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:00.316
I’d like to see. Come here.

01:24:00.316 --> 01:24:02.000
You see, because Noora and,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.200
what’s your name is there?

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.828
Maureen.

01:24:07.828 --> 01:24:07.836
Maureen.

01:24:07.836 --> 01:24:09.280
So, we have one very great Maureen

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.360
in London also.

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:14.080
So, Noora is a very, really,

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.640
I was surprised how she’s got this name.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:41.200
It means life, you see. ‘nur’.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:08.160
Is it better? Are you feeling

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.120
the cool breeze?

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.040
Just watch Me, thinking is still on.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.560
On both the hands?

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.880
No, I feel cool on the right fingers.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.440
Feeling on the left?

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.280
No.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:22.880
All right put your right hand on your heart.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:42.160
You see, these gurus,

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.360
they remove your attention from God,

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.600
from Spirit, to other things.

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:49.520
So, try to catch it into

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.800
your Spirit in your heart.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:53.040
That’s the main thing, isn’t it?

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.200
All other things are useless.

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:57.120
What’s the use of giving the whole world

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:04.640
and not your own Spirit?

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.560
Just you desire that,

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.400
“I want to be my Spirit”.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.200
Just desire that. That’s what you

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.160
should desire, “I want to be my Spirit”.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.960
You also put your right hand on your heart.

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:18.880
On your heart. As here, yes.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:21.520
Now, press it. Yes, that’s better.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.080
Now, close your eyes and desire,

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:39.840
“I should be the Spirit”.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:27:05.440
Is Chaya there? Chaya

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:42.880
Are you feeling any breeze in the left?

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.280
No.

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.880
All right, watch Me without thinking.

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:49.120
That’s it.

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:27.600
Hum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:06.891
Better. Much better now.

01:31:06.891 --> 01:31:09.833
Is she better? Better? Void.

01:31:09.833 --> 01:31:16.080
Better say Guru mantra that,

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:28.923
“You are my guru”.

01:31:28.923 --> 01:31:28.956
Then only we’ll give it to him.

01:31:28.956 --> 01:31:34.560
Now is he all right on the Void? Heart.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.680
Catches heart so badly, I tell you,

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:42.800
all of you, you know,

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:46.320
still have the problem.

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:49.360
Are you feeling any cool breeze?

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:49.673
Not in the hand,

01:31:49.673 --> 01:31:51.760
I feel just over my fingers.

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:52.560
Feeling better?

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:54.610
Just briefly.

01:31:54.610 --> 01:31:54.635
There’s been some cool.

01:31:54.635 --> 01:31:55.040
Yes. It’s good.

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.680
Just ask for forgiveness for going to TM,

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.200
just like that.

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:07.589
You say that,

01:32:07.589 --> 01:32:08.800
“Forgive me for going TM”.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.960
Because the heart is catching still,

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:11.280
all right?

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.000
If you say that, it will work out faster.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:28.600
You see, heart is released. Say it again.

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:38.160
Heart. But don’t feel guilty. Just say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:44.960
it.

01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:45.600
All right.

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.388
I need to go and lie down and rest.

01:32:48.388 --> 01:32:48.400
What’s it?

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.640
I need to go and lie down again.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:33:05.120
All right.

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.320
It&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:16.631
comes from Center Heart as well.

01:33:16.631 --> 01:33:16.637
Heart.

01:33:16.637 --> 01:33:19.120
It comes from Left Heart

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:22.380
to the center as well.

01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:22.400
Heart in the centre.

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.080
You have not to be frightened of anything.

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:25.339
No fear.

01:33:25.339 --> 01:33:25.360
I’m not frightened.

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.200
No, not at all. Hum?

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.400
No, not even fear

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.600
about what you have done.

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.360
Nothing to have that, any fear.

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.560
Everything is curable.

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.000
Everything is perfect. All right?

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.840
Just think like that,

01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:38.560
“Now I’m very powerful that way”.

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.200
All right?

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:40.840
Everything can be awakened.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:44.397
This boy was sitting in a lunatic asylum.

01:33:44.397 --> 01:33:45.760
So you can imagine

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:58.313
how much Sahaja Yoga can help. All right?

01:33:58.313 --> 01:33:58.317
Yes.

01:33:58.317 --> 01:33:58.320
Ha!

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:02.800
To clear it say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.640
Jagadamba. Jagadamba.

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:28.346
Om twamewa sakshat Shri Jagadamba sakshat,

01:34:28.345 --> 01:34:32.101
Shri Adi Shakti, Shri Nirmala Devi,

01:34:32.102 --> 01:34:33.390
namo namaha.
