WEBVTT

03:08.036 --> 03:10.453
Sahaja yogis should not fall to such a level

03:10.994 --> 03:15.328
of mundane type of people after all what is going to happen to you

03:15.370 --> 03:19.745
I would say those who have been worrying and all that,

03:19.787 --> 03:22.244
should go into great meditation and understand

03:22.286 --> 03:26.161
that you are insulting yourself. You are saints;

03:26.203 --> 03:28.411
why should you worry about what plane you are going to get,

03:28.453 --> 03:32.536
what you are not going to get? Shows that your level is very low;

03:32.578 --> 03:34.994
definitely; all those who have worried.

03:34.994 --> 03:41.536
You have come here under My protection,

03:41.578 --> 03:52.244
and you will go back under My protection.

03:52.286 --> 03:55.161
we’ll not have any pujas. You must know

03:55.161 --> 04:00.828
that you are all part and parcel of My being;

04:00.870 --> 04:09.078
I have put you in My body and you have to behave yourself.

04:09.078 --> 04:18.994
so in such an auspicious day when we all have come here

04:19.036 --> 04:27.745
to do this special puja, and I would say this should be called

04:27.787 --> 04:32.662
as a Mahalakshmi Puja because it’s something to do

04:32.662 --> 04:36.578
with the industry of this country, and of the whole world.

04:36.620 --> 04:46.620
Unless and until all those human ventures are connected with God

04:46.662 --> 04:52.453
they cannot get their perfect stage and their status.

04:52.495 --> 04:56.244
That’s why we have problems now in the West.

04:56.286 --> 04:59.370
Supposed to be very clever people, very smart,

04:59.370 --> 05:04.286
very well equipped, well educated. We are having recessions

05:04.328 --> 05:07.328
and things because they have no balance.

05:07.328 --> 05:12.787
They don’t know that there is God’s power which works everything,

05:12.828 --> 05:17.119
and when you neglect that, this is what happens to you.

05:17.119 --> 05:28.787
Now for any venture that we do of this kind,

05:28.787 --> 05:34.119
first of all we have to use a lot of material from the Mother Earth,

05:34.161 --> 05:41.662
but if it is taken for a proper purpose, for constructive things

05:41.703 --> 05:46.578
and for helping others, with a balance,

05:46.620 --> 05:54.244
then Mother Earth can think, She can produce, more and more,

05:54.244 --> 05:56.703
all this She has produced before.

05:56.745 --> 05:59.495
She can produce for people who are sensible,

05:59.536 --> 06:09.203
who are in tune with God, not just making money for themselves,

06:09.244 --> 06:20.703
or for their own purpose, but are thinking in totality,

06:20.703 --> 06:26.244
thinking as to what we can achieve by doing this.

06:26.286 --> 06:32.745
And that is how an industry can grow.

06:32.787 --> 06:36.244
Now we see in Japan so much industry has grown,

06:36.286 --> 06:41.286
but no spirituality. They are not at all happy people.

06:41.328 --> 06:47.453
Their children are suffering, families are suffering.

06:47.453 --> 06:55.620
Money cannot get the total well being of a human being.

06:55.662 --> 06:59.828
So a balance has to be drawn.

06:59.828 --> 07:04.745
Especially in our country, thank God, we didn’t have

07:04.745 --> 07:10.495
such a fast industrialization, and that’s why we are saved

07:10.495 --> 07:13.203
of lots of problems that the Western people are suffering,

07:13.244 --> 07:15.828
about which the Indians are not aware.

07:15.870 --> 07:20.536
They think you are all living in a very comfortable life there.

07:20.578 --> 07:28.745
Industry has to go hand-in-hand with the handicrafts,

07:28.745 --> 07:35.745
and the industrialists have to also look after the artists,

07:35.787 --> 07:39.495
because otherwise who will look after them?

07:39.536 --> 07:43.453
How will they bring forth the balance between the art and the industry?

07:43.495 --> 07:48.828
And art is such a soothing thing for these hard-working people.

07:48.828 --> 07:52.745
They work the whole day, then there is some sort of a music,

07:52.745 --> 08:02.703
art, to console them, to give them peace, to relax them,

08:02.745 --> 08:10.203
and a balance. So I would say that all industries

08:10.244 --> 08:17.203
must take to some artistic ventures also, or they should also produce things.

08:17.203 --> 08:21.620
After I was telling Rajesh many a times that you should try to produce

08:21.662 --> 08:27.161
something artistic out of the steel scrap that is left over, will be a good idea.

08:27.161 --> 08:29.036
They have tried something like that.

08:29.078 --> 08:36.411
But industry should not be looked down upon

08:36.453 --> 08:38.870
as it is looked down upon in our country.

08:38.912 --> 08:41.453
I mean, as if industrialists are the greatest thieves

08:41.495 --> 08:46.703
and all the politicians are saints in this country. It’s the other way around I think.

08:46.703 --> 08:49.453
It should be treated with respect,

08:49.495 --> 08:51.620
and should be understood that it’s very important.

08:51.662 --> 08:57.203
And the industrialists, if they become also enlightened,

08:57.203 --> 09:03.578
they can do a lot, not only to their own country,

09:03.620 --> 09:06.453
but also to the people whom they are looking after.

09:06.495 --> 09:09.411
So in the Mahalakshmi principle,

09:09.453 --> 09:13.703
Mahalakshmi has various mudras.

09:13.745 --> 09:21.536
One of the mudra is that She puts Her right hand like this.

09:21.536 --> 09:26.994
Now this right hand is to give protection to people

09:26.994 --> 09:33.453
who are under the protection, or under the service,

09:33.453 --> 09:36.286
of some rich man, or the industrialist we can call it.

09:36.286 --> 09:40.370
In India if you call somebody a rich man it’s like abusing him.

09:40.411 --> 09:44.161
Nobody likes it, because the rich are always shown

09:44.203 --> 09:46.662
to be the worst people, which is not so.

09:46.703 --> 09:50.953
In My own experience it’s not so. If there’s a poor man also he could be terrible.

09:50.994 --> 09:54.286
We have had very bad experiences now, in Ganapatipule,

09:54.328 --> 09:56.453
of very poor people how they behaved

09:56.495 --> 10:00.119
in a very funny manner - supposed to be poor.

10:00.161 --> 10:11.119
So it should be a proper balance, it should be brought to a proper balance,

10:11.119 --> 10:16.620
between the understanding of the poor and the rich, and the rich and the poor.

10:16.662 --> 10:24.620
After some time you will find that people will not consider poverty

10:24.662 --> 10:31.370
or riches as so important, but the richness of the spirit

10:31.411 --> 10:33.828
will become very important.

10:33.870 --> 10:36.952
That is what is going to be the Sahaj nations

10:36.952 --> 10:41.536
where the richness of the heart, the spirituality,

10:41.536 --> 10:46.745
oneness with the Divine, will become the greatest boon

10:46.787 --> 10:53.244
for everyone. But still we are struggling

10:53.286 --> 11:00.161
to be on that state; many are; and still we go into materialistic tantrums

11:00.203 --> 11:06.203
or some sort of a stupid worrying fall.

11:06.244 --> 11:09.787
All these must be carefully watched.

11:09.828 --> 11:16.994
If you can keep this chariot of new progress

11:17.036 --> 11:19.411
progressing faster

11:19.453 --> 11:23.662
we are going to create a new world of complete harmony,

11:23.662 --> 11:28.870
complete peace, joy and love. But for that

11:28.870 --> 11:35.078
you are the ones who have to do it. I cannot do it.

11:35.119 --> 11:36.411
If I could have done it

11:36.411 --> 11:38.328
I would not have asked you to join Sahaja Yoga.

11:38.370 --> 11:41.203
It’s like the horses and the charioteer;

11:41.203 --> 11:49.078
horses are to be driven; charioteer doesn’t drive the chariot.

11:49.119 --> 11:53.536
In the same way you must understand your responsibility

11:53.536 --> 11:56.244
that this is the greatest work we are doing.

11:56.286 --> 12:05.036
It’s not only the industry, or the labor and the capital,

12:05.078 --> 12:09.495
I’m talking about, but I’m talking about the totality of well being.

12:09.495 --> 12:14.662
Of course all of this is a part and parcel of that, no doubt.

12:14.703 --> 12:18.453
But the balance should be with the totality.

12:18.495 --> 12:23.203
So we have to think of a total well being.

12:23.244 --> 12:27.495
Once we start thinking of the total well being then –

12:27.536 --> 12:29.161
first thing that should come to us:

12:29.161 --> 12:34.078
Are we capable of bringing up that total well being? Are we?

12:34.078 --> 12:40.119
Have we got the total well being within ourselves or not? Have we?

12:40.161 --> 12:42.787
We are still worried if the plane is coming or not,

12:42.787 --> 12:45.952
I mean, we are so mundane, so little, so small.

12:45.952 --> 12:54.994
With one bandhan you can control any plane, any atmosphere,

12:54.994 --> 12:59.078
and here you are, I mean, still worried about things

12:59.119 --> 13:01.994
which are absolutely under your control.

13:02.036 --> 13:07.203
So this totality has to be thought over.

13:07.203 --> 13:11.578
What is this totality that Mother is talking about?

13:11.578 --> 13:18.787
In this totality a world has to be created of people,

13:18.787 --> 13:32.703
by the people, who have no fear. This fear has to be given up.

13:32.745 --> 13:36.244
Behind all this nonsensical nervousness is fear.

13:36.244 --> 13:44.161
So for that, what She does is to give  Avaida

13:44.203 --> 13:50.912
Under Her protection you are beyond fear, you are protected.

13:50.952 --> 13:53.953
But if you do not want to believe in yourself,

13:53.994 --> 13:59.994
and you don’t believe into Her protection, then no body can help you,

14:00.036 --> 14:03.453
because everything is mythical for you.

14:03.495 --> 14:13.662
In every venture that we take up we should not have any fear

14:13.703 --> 14:19.620
because God is with you. Is a fact, is the truth. You just try.

14:19.620 --> 14:26.078
But when you try through your ego you fall into the trap of fear.

14:26.078 --> 14:29.703
I have seen egoistical people are the most frightened people,

14:29.745 --> 14:33.203
and panicked, because they panic others

14:33.244 --> 14:36.495
and so they think they can be panicked one day.

14:36.495 --> 14:40.952
When the English were here, first of all, in India,

14:40.952 --> 14:45.620
we were all frightened of them. Now I see

14:45.662 --> 14:49.703
that in England every English family is frightened of others.

14:49.703 --> 14:53.328
They’ll only open a chink of the door to see who is there,

14:53.370 --> 14:57.662
and shut it. They’re so frightened. I’m surprised,

14:57.703 --> 14:59.703
they are the same English who ruled us here.

14:59.703 --> 15:02.328
And we were so bewitched before them and now

15:02.370 --> 15:04.620
they are the ones who are frightened of us;

15:04.662 --> 15:07.994
because when a person who is egoistical tries to dominate others

15:08.036 --> 15:12.203
he sees himself in the mirror and thinks

15:12.203 --> 15:14.536
that the other person will dominate him.

15:14.578 --> 15:18.328
That’s how this fear creeps in, into our minds,

15:18.328 --> 15:22.536
and we start getting all kinds of these stupid tantrums

15:22.578 --> 15:25.828
out of this mythical fear.

15:25.870 --> 15:30.870
The fear is created by our ego.

15:30.912 --> 15:37.036
A person who has no ego, he’ll have no fear

15:37.036 --> 15:38.536
because he has not harmed anyone.

15:38.578 --> 15:42.536
Why should he have any fear? And such a man, or such a woman,

15:42.578 --> 15:46.495
will be looked after by God, because God takes over.

15:46.536 --> 15:51.411
When you surrender your ego to God He takes over.

15:51.453 --> 15:55.411
But those who have ego He says, “All right, go ahead,

15:55.411 --> 15:58.662
use your ego, try to protect yourself, cut your throat.”

15:58.662 --> 16:06.745
That’s what it is. So when I talk of total benevolence

16:06.745 --> 16:12.036
I’m talking about your own total benevolence.

16:12.078 --> 16:13.953
So first is the fear,

16:13.994 --> 16:17.286
which should go out of your mind completely

16:17.328 --> 16:21.787
if you believe in the Almighty God. We’ll say,

16:21.828 --> 16:24.495
“You are Almighty God, you are almighty this thing”

16:24.495 --> 16:28.119
It's all lip-service. If you believe that God is almighty,

16:28.161 --> 16:29.912
and you are connected with God,

16:29.952 --> 16:32.787
then why should you have any fear of anything?

16:32.787 --> 16:37.745
But when we say, “Don’t have fear,” another extreme comes up,

16:37.745 --> 16:40.745
“We don’t have fear, we can do what we like,

16:40.787 --> 16:45.953
we can perform everything ourselves, we need not tell anyone.”

16:45.994 --> 16:50.078
You have to tell God whatever you are doing.

16:50.119 --> 16:56.703
You have to take permission, you have to inform in His darbar,

16:56.703 --> 17:03.370
in His court, that, “Sir, we are thinking of doing such and such thing.”

17:03.411 --> 17:09.703
But you think you are God. You are not.

17:09.745 --> 17:13.745
And that’s why the another part of non-fear

17:13.787 --> 17:16.620
is this kind of an arbitrary behavior

17:16.662 --> 17:19.161
which is very dangerous for Sahaja Yoga,

17:19.203 --> 17:21.870
for yourself, and for everybody else.

17:21.912 --> 17:32.453
The second fear, I mean, I have, is that if I tell you anything,

17:32.495 --> 17:37.912
ninety-nine percent of you understand is for your benevolence,

17:37.952 --> 17:41.536
is for your good. But there is one percent of people

17:41.536 --> 17:47.495
who can just react because they have too much ego and they won’t take it,

17:47.495 --> 17:50.453
because they don’t think of their own benevolence.

17:50.453 --> 17:54.328
They don’t understand that if I am telling them anything,

17:54.370 --> 18:01.620
it is just to give them completeness, totality.

18:01.662 --> 18:06.244
But, on the contrary, they take a very wrong attitude;

18:06.244 --> 18:10.870
this is another nonsensity. So now one has to develop

18:10.870 --> 18:15.203
a kind of a indifference to this kind of people

18:15.203 --> 18:20.328
who unnecessarily go to the other limit of their own destruction,

18:20.370 --> 18:24.370
and don’t want to see what is the point in everything

18:24.411 --> 18:27.620
that I am telling you. Only I can tell you. Who else?

18:27.662 --> 18:30.203
I have to tell you what’s wrong with you,

18:30.203 --> 18:33.036
what you have done wrong, and then you must change it.

18:33.078 --> 18:39.994
This is another style of reaction one gets,

18:40.036 --> 18:42.578
means they are not interested in their own benevolence,

18:42.578 --> 18:45.952
they’re not interested in the benevolence of their children,

18:45.952 --> 18:50.328
they’re not interested in the benevolence of their country or the whole world.

18:50.328 --> 18:54.203
Now why have you come to Sahaja Yoga? Just ask one question.

18:54.203 --> 18:58.578
Of course for you to ascend. But ascend for what?

18:58.578 --> 19:02.370
Supposing we bring one tube light.

19:02.370 --> 19:06.578
For what we have to take the tube light? But for what?

19:06.620 --> 19:09.994
We have to put the light. But this tube light doesn’t give light,

19:10.036 --> 19:13.411
nothing of the kind, so what’s the use of having this tube light?

19:13.453 --> 19:18.119
In the same way, what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga

19:18.119 --> 19:25.203
if you cannot become the light of the Divine?

19:25.203 --> 19:35.453
So all of you, each one of you, is not at all a small person;

19:35.453 --> 19:38.662
no one; but you don’t realize what you are;

19:38.703 --> 19:43.495
still have those funny conditionings by which you think

19:43.495 --> 19:46.078
you are no good. All of you can come up,

19:46.078 --> 19:50.370
and see so many people. If they take to total benevolence

19:50.411 --> 19:58.078
within themselves it will manifest itself outside; absolutely; it’s a fact.

19:58.078 --> 20:03.828
Then the attention is very important.

20:03.870 --> 20:08.286
The attention should be on your own perfection

20:08.328 --> 20:14.870
and on your total benevolence. This is also another point people miss,

20:14.912 --> 20:17.453
that they start finding faults with others

20:17.495 --> 20:21.078
instead of finding faults with themselves.

20:21.119 --> 20:26.787
As a result, if you look at others, what will you get out of it?

20:26.828 --> 20:32.370
I just don’t understand. If somebody is wrong,

20:32.411 --> 20:35.912
he’s doing something evil, he's bad, even if you put attention to him,

20:35.912 --> 20:42.620
what will you do about it? But if you have something wrong,

20:42.662 --> 20:45.119
you have every right, you have every control,

20:45.161 --> 20:53.787
and you can correct yourself. This is especially Indian quality,

20:53.787 --> 20:55.952
is to find faults with others.

20:55.952 --> 21:00.370
They’ll never see that what’s wrong with us.

21:00.411 --> 21:06.328
All the time the attention is involved in finding with faults with others.

21:06.370 --> 21:13.286
Then how can we improve? On the contrary,

21:13.286 --> 21:17.244
if you start seeing faults, you get faulty much more.

21:17.286 --> 21:21.703
It’s a copycat nature of human beings.

21:21.745 --> 21:24.203
They see somebody doing like this,

21:24.244 --> 21:27.161
“Oh Mother, he’s a Sahaja yogi, he does like this,

21:27.203 --> 21:29.370
so what’s the harm if I do?”

21:29.370 --> 21:31.620
But who says he’s a Sahaja yogi?

21:31.620 --> 21:35.578
So ‘Sahaja yogi’ is not a brand, it's not a certificate,

21:35.620 --> 21:42.370
it’s not a kind of a organization, but it is your own status

21:42.411 --> 21:45.870
that you have achieved. Anybody can say,

21:45.912 --> 21:48.745
“I’m a Sahaja Yogi.” After all I cannot stop him from saying.

21:48.787 --> 21:51.745
I’m not such a ...(unclear). Even I have seen some mad people,

21:51.745 --> 21:54.370
they are Sahaja yogis, for years together they’re mad,

21:54.411 --> 22:00.370
but they’re Sahaja yogis. But you have to see for yourself,

22:00.370 --> 22:03.453
am I a Sahaja yogi or not? Before certifying yourself,

22:03.495 --> 22:09.703
why don’t you find out? But despite that, I must say,

22:09.745 --> 22:15.161
it's such a satisfaction. I never expected that so many people

22:15.203 --> 22:17.994
will get their realization to begin with, never.

22:18.036 --> 22:24.787
I mean, I knew that it was en masse modus operandi I have developed,

22:24.787 --> 22:30.119
but I never expected. But it has happened,

22:30.161 --> 22:35.828
and even now I have to expect that all of you

22:35.870 --> 22:40.703
will achieve the highest, highest positions, the paramapada (Sanskrit word),

22:40.703 --> 22:46.119
as I said, like the North Pole, or like the Meru; absolutely atala (Indian word)

22:46.161 --> 22:49.286
‘which cannot be disturbed’. So that’s My hope,

22:49.328 --> 22:52.119
and I’m sure you will all comply with it.

22:52.161 --> 23:20.952
(Talk continues in Marathi then returns to English)

34:06.495 --> 34:08.161
I’ll tell you in English. I have told you many a times

34:08.161 --> 34:11.244
about Namadeva and Gorakumbhar, how Gorakumbhar,

34:11.244 --> 34:14.536
when he saw Namadeva, Namadeva saw Gorakumbhar

34:14.578 --> 34:18.994
was kneading the clay for his pottery,

34:19.036 --> 34:22.787
he just went and stood before him stunned.

34:22.787 --> 34:30.994
And what he says that, “I have come to see here the formless”

34:31.036 --> 34:35.994
(that’s the vibrations). “But the Formless is in a form”

34:36.036 --> 34:39.703
This is the appreciation one should have,

34:39.745 --> 34:41.745
one Sahaja yogi should have for another.

34:41.787 --> 34:45.703
Every Sahaja yogi is a gem.

34:45.745 --> 34:51.161
Even the thought of a gem should bring joy to you.

34:51.203 --> 34:56.745
In every life, every style, in every areas, every dimensions,

34:56.787 --> 35:04.244
one should have this kind of a feeling. Muslims, Hindus, Christians,

35:04.286 --> 35:07.828
we do not accept. For us we are all Sahaja yogis,

35:07.870 --> 35:11.952
and we have faith in all the religions, not some above.

35:11.952 --> 35:15.952
We have faith in every thing. As well as we worship Rama

35:15.952 --> 35:20.453
we worship Muhammad Sahib also, same way, no less.

35:20.495 --> 35:24.286
As we worship Brahmadeva, or as we worship,

35:24.286 --> 35:29.119
we say, Dattatreya, we worship Zoroaster, there’s no difference at all,

35:29.161 --> 35:34.244
same way. There’s a big difference in having just a same,

35:34.244 --> 35:39.286
what you call, the same respect; it’s not that;

35:39.328 --> 35:43.787
but we worship the same way, so there’s no question

35:43.787 --> 35:48.286
of differentiating each other; nor on country-wise, nothing.

35:48.286 --> 35:51.703
And whatever defects we have, we see to it

35:51.745 --> 35:53.870
that this has come from our country;

35:53.912 --> 35:57.286
which I see many Sahaja yogis tell Me, “This is typical English,

35:57.328 --> 36:00.870
this is typically French, this is typically Italian.”

36:00.912 --> 36:06.994
They themselves tell Me. But main thing one has to understand is this,

36:07.036 --> 36:11.828
that in Sahaja Yoga we have lost all these boundaries; nothing is there.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.952
We have reached that state where we are all one.

36:14.953 --> 36:20.411
And the idea of any Sahaja yogi whatsoever,

36:20.411 --> 36:23.244
and any individual Sahaja yogi, or a group of Sahaja yogis,

36:23.244 --> 36:32.161
should fill you up with joy and a kind of a wave of joy

36:32.161 --> 36:38.328
which is continuously coming, because they are in the form of joy,

36:38.370 --> 36:43.953
peace. If this appreciation is reached, then only one can say

36:43.994 --> 36:49.244
that you are Sahaja yogis, and that is one of the tests I have seen.

36:49.286 --> 36:51.787
You love Me very much I know, all of you,

36:51.787 --> 36:55.870
but unless and until you love each other how am I going to be happy?

36:55.870 --> 37:00.787
So today specially, this Mahalakshmi principle,

37:00.828 --> 37:05.953
when it is awakened within you, then you get out of a Lakshmi principle,

37:05.994 --> 37:08.952
which makes you a little selfish maybe, self-centered,

37:08.952 --> 37:12.828
and you get into a new dimension of searching,

37:12.870 --> 37:19.119
of searching the higher value system, something beyond,

37:19.161 --> 37:25.203
without any limitations. And that Mahalakshmi principle

37:25.244 --> 37:30.620
is really nothing, in essence, if you see, is nothing but you are seeking the universal love,

37:30.620 --> 37:37.620
in the essence it is that. We don’t love people

37:37.662 --> 37:40.994
because they belong to some country, because they look like this,

37:41.036 --> 37:43.828
that this is this; nothing; we love them

37:43.870 --> 37:49.828
only because they are our part and parcel, we are one with them.

37:49.870 --> 37:54.620
So those who are today worshipping Mahalakshmi should feel

37:54.620 --> 37:56.994
how many worshippers of Mahalakshmi are there,

37:56.994 --> 38:00.870
and they are all our own. It’s such a great feeling.

38:00.912 --> 38:07.745
Otherwise, in Maharashtra especially, I must say, it was horrible,

38:07.787 --> 38:11.953
one Sahaja yogi goes to preach in another Sahaj, another district.

38:11.994 --> 38:20.036
(Background noise) The district leader starts fighting, just like this sound,

38:20.036 --> 38:25.203
“Who are you to come here? I’m the leader”

38:25.244 --> 38:32.953
Instead of respecting him, and making him a welcome guest,

38:32.994 --> 38:37.870
asking him what can you help, there’s a big fight.

38:37.912 --> 38:43.952
It’s really surprising. How can it happen?

38:43.953 --> 38:49.244
When Namadeva went to Punjab, Guru Nanak Sahib respected him;

38:49.244 --> 38:51.662
not only that, but he told him that,

38:51.703 --> 38:54.411
“You write now in Punjabi language also.”

38:54.453 --> 38:57.994
I have seen such a big book written by Namadeva. Can you imagine?

38:57.994 --> 39:03.119
He included all the great saints of Maharashtra in his Granth Sahib,

39:03.161 --> 39:08.828
because he knew that these are realized souls, they are higher souls.

39:08.870 --> 39:12.870
But these Sikhs are only reading it; nothing goes into their heads.

39:12.912 --> 39:18.495
What can you do? So at that time,

39:18.495 --> 39:21.662
if these saints could love each other,

39:21.703 --> 39:27.328
could express themselves in such a manner, why not we,

39:27.328 --> 39:29.745
the Sahaja yogis from all over the world?

39:29.787 --> 39:34.787
So I would say now, that, let us see, it’s a very nice program of Ras

39:34.828 --> 39:39.912
(Indian word) we’ll be having, where all the Indian and foreign Sahaja yogis are going to be together,

39:39.952 --> 39:43.453
and are going to dance together. All such things are there.

39:43.495 --> 39:48.328
So don’t sit in groups, but mix up with others, know them,

39:48.370 --> 39:51.495
and this is what we are going to know;

39:51.536 --> 39:56.453
each and every Sahaja yogi of the whole world.

39:56.495 --> 40:02.078
Is very important for Me that you should love each other.

40:02.119 --> 40:06.870
It will really soothe Me the most, it will give Me the greatest joy,

40:06.912 --> 40:14.745
the greatest achievement, and the fulfillment of My life.

40:14.787 --> 40:22.495
If somebody is really, definitely wrong, you just write to Me

40:22.495 --> 40:26.161
and I will know, because immediately I’ll know from vibrations.

40:26.203 --> 40:28.328
Nobody can befool Me, that’s one thing for sure.

40:28.370 --> 40:30.620
Some people say that, “Somebody has told this to Mother.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.912
” Nothing can be told to Mother, you don’t know;

40:32.952 --> 40:36.578
I am too cunning for all this. Nobody can tell Me anything;

40:36.620 --> 40:38.994
I know each and every... I play around a little bit,

40:39.036 --> 40:42.620
but I know each and every person. I give them a chance

40:42.662 --> 40:44.787
to hang themselves for a time being.

40:44.787 --> 40:49.078
But never believe that anybody can befool Me, and tell anything.

40:49.078 --> 40:58.662
I listen to everyone, and you can try that.

40:58.703 --> 41:03.286
If you love another Sahaja yogi,

41:03.286 --> 41:08.411
this loving process itself is so joy giving.

41:08.453 --> 41:15.578
When you first saw Me this time on the stage, you felt that way,

41:15.620 --> 41:22.119
because this process of loving is the greatest joy-giving thing.

41:22.161 --> 41:27.952
So be happy, be joyous. If some people are missing the plane,

41:27.952 --> 41:30.870
well and good, you will live with other Sahaja yogis,

41:30.912 --> 41:34.328
you are after all, you are somewhere in the world, you are not lost.

41:34.328 --> 41:37.703
Even if you are in the sea, you are there, on the plane you are there.

41:37.703 --> 41:43.453
What does it matter? Why is it so important

41:43.495 --> 41:47.370
that this plane must be reserved, and you must worry about this plane,

41:47.411 --> 41:50.244
“I must get out at this time” There’s no need.

41:50.244 --> 41:54.036
Wherever you are you are with Sahaja yogis,

41:54.078 --> 41:55.912
so why worry?

41:55.912 --> 42:01.703
You are, that’s the point. Like many people ask Me,

42:01.703 --> 42:04.244
“Mother You travel so much, how is it You don’t get tired?”

42:04.244 --> 42:06.870
Because I never think I am travelling, I just think, “I am,”

42:06.912 --> 42:09.870
that’s all. Whether in the plane or here, or there,

42:09.870 --> 42:14.328
I am just there. I have to tell Me I am traveling,

42:14.328 --> 42:19.994
then again I forget. So you are,

42:20.036 --> 42:23.745
whether you are here or in England, or anywhere,

42:23.787 --> 42:29.620
or you are here or you are there. So why to worry?

42:29.620 --> 42:32.411
Specially with the plane - I think there is something wrong

42:32.411 --> 42:38.578
with the Western genetics - the plane enters into their Kundalini,

42:38.620 --> 42:42.952
I think, and they go so bizarre with the airplanes.

42:42.952 --> 42:46.453
Something I’ve never been able to understand it.

42:46.453 --> 42:49.912
I’ve given them so many lessons to show that don’t do all this nonsense,

42:49.952 --> 42:52.036
but still they go on doing like this.

42:52.078 --> 42:55.328
But if I tell them they feel guilty,but again they do it.

42:55.370 --> 42:58.787
Next time if your plane is eight o’clock,

42:58.828 --> 43:03.453
go at nine o’clock, the plane will wait for you till ten o’clock,

43:03.495 --> 43:08.078
take it from Me. It has happened; so many can tell this.

43:08.119 --> 43:14.161
So many experiences are there. I mean, we haven’t written them down,

43:14.203 --> 43:18.161
but people know how planes have been delayed for us.

43:18.161 --> 43:22.328
I have never missed a plane all My life, and when I missed it,

43:22.328 --> 43:24.870
it was with a purpose; these big things happened.

43:24.870 --> 43:28.078
So it is important, it’s a drama.

43:28.119 --> 43:35.870
The worry should be one:

43:35.912 --> 43:43.495
“Why can’t I love everyone as I love myself?”

43:43.495 --> 43:50.703
I tell you only this universal love will give you

43:50.745 --> 43:55.994
that confidence and that higher status.

43:56.036 --> 43:58.703
Why these saints suffered for you?

43:58.703 --> 44:03.078
Why did Christ suffer for you?

44:03.078 --> 44:04.703
Why Muhammad Sahib suffered for you?

44:04.745 --> 44:07.119
Why anybody talked to you about Dharma?

44:07.161 --> 44:12.078
Why Gnaneshwara wrote Gnaneshwari? Why?

44:12.119 --> 44:14.203
What did they get?

44:14.244 --> 44:21.453
This satisfaction of their expression of universal love.

44:21.495 --> 44:25.912
All the great poets, William Blake or anyone,

44:25.912 --> 44:28.161
whatever they have done, it’s just

44:28.161 --> 44:32.203
because they have this universal love and they want to express it.

44:32.244 --> 44:33.912
Why not you do it?

44:33.952 --> 44:38.952
So if you want your Mahalakshmi principle

44:38.994 --> 44:42.620
to be all the time burning, then please

44:42.662 --> 44:46.745
see that you love each and every Sahaja yogi.

44:46.787 --> 44:49.495
That’s the message today. I hope you’ll understand that.

44:49.536 --> 44:52.370
May God bless you.
