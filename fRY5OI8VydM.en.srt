1
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:38,597
We have gathered here on the occassion of Ram Navami

2
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:40,657
everybody has said

3
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:46,567
Mother please tell us about Shri Ram

4
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:55,627
As you know that Shri Rama has taken
a very important place in our chakras

5
00:04:55,637 --> 00:05:02,967
He is sitting on our right heart

6
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:10,867
Shri Rama has taken a place of a father

7
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:26,804
so lack of father's duty and love
can cause a catch of this chakra

8
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:34,470
In Sahaja Yoga we can understand
that Rama and all other gods

9
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:41,397
came on earth with different power (shakti),

10
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:49,487
they came to do their jobs

11
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:54,313
In the sense Shri Rama has a special job

12
00:05:56,827 --> 00:06:02,687
Socrates has said
benevolent king has to come

13
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:07,169
For that Shri Rama came

14
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:13,307
Shri Rama came in complete human form

15
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:16,657
He even forgot that

16
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:21,367
he is a incarnation of Shri Vishnu
 He was made to be forgotten

17
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:31,377
But he was Purushottam on earth
(perfect human being)

18
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:40,107
you all must have heard of
his qualities and his childhood

19
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:47,643
In Sahaja yoga
when we worship any god

20
00:06:49,337 --> 00:07:02,757
what quality we gain from them

21
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:06,397
which qualities we will receive?

22
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:08,857
Shri Rama has many

23
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:19,867
One that he was ideal
another that he is a king

24
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:24,987
he kept his people higher than himself

25
00:07:24,997 --> 00:07:29,957
than his wife and children

26
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:38,247
If politicians today

27
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:42,797
understand this point

28
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:46,897
they wouldn't be called selfish

29
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:49,087
they wouldn't be selfish

30
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:51,437
would be follower of Dharma.

31
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:53,677
Nobody has followed

32
00:07:53,687 --> 00:08:00,677
Shri Rama as a role model
till today

33
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:03,637
By singing his bhajans

34
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:10,858
or building an institutions and temples
in his name

35
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:16,337
Shri Rama come to you?

36
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:20,077
Do you get his light in your life?

37
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:29,373
Only sahaj yogi can bring the light
of Shri Rama into the attention

38
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:34,263
He is totally beyond

39
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:39,062
Basically all the deities are
free from papas and punyas

40
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:45,242
so called sins
they never sin

41
00:08:45,252 --> 00:08:48,602
Shri Krishna killed many people

42
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:52,890
Shri Rama killed Ravana

43
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,852
It can be a sin in worldly sense

44
00:08:57,877 --> 00:09:00,962
but not in the eyes of god

45
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:13,197
As they destroy and remove evils
they have rights to do anything

46
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:21,307
When Devi slayed Rakshas
she has committed a sin?

47
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:30,856
Their work is to destroy the
rakshas and protect the saints

48
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:42,422
In Shri Rama's life Ahilya's saving is
the most important

49
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:46,293
she was cursed by her husband

50
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,859
In those times if any women
goes out of dharma

51
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:58,172
and if her husband is high saint
he could curse

52
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:04,032
But Ahillya was blamed falsely

53
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:09,438
And she was made into stone falsely

54
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:14,667
So shri Rama saved Ahilya

55
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:27,736
Especially his quality to have only one wife

56
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,060
his love to one wife must be understood

57
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:41,142
Even though he knew Sitaji is Mahalaxmi
she herself is a Goddess

58
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:50,702
But as a Human he never looked
 at any other women but his wife

59
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:56,226
When we talk about Rama
we should have the husband pure

60
00:10:56,464 --> 00:11:00,390
To worships shri Rama

61
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:10,782
Women should have the same faith
in husbands as Sitaji used to

62
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:17,060
Husbands also need the quality of Shri Ram
who believed one wife

63
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:20,012
Not difficult for sahaja yogis

64
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:24,987
Women should be respected
 Have respect for wifes

65
00:11:24,997 --> 00:11:28,997
When Ravana kidnapped Sitaji

66
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:34,662
Shri Rama felt his duty
 to rescue her

67
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:42,287
But in his kingdom
he was so just that

68
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:48,627
For people he left her
after spending so many years to rescue

69
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:54,777
As Sitaji herself a Devi
 so there's no effect

70
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:58,663
So Shri Rama did it

71
00:11:58,742 --> 00:12:05,184
to keep the benevolence
of public opinion

72
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:09,297
that society wouln't accpect the women

73
00:12:09,322 --> 00:12:15,287
who are questioned.

74
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:21,745
Although she is a Devi
Pure and Nirmala

75
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,173
Later that
Sita also left him somehow

76
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:32,872
She left him as a woman
and Shri Rama as a man

77
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:41,191
Sitaji disappeared into the mother earth
and Shri Rama went into River Sarayu

78
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:48,275
Their life is very eventful
 and full of Miracles

79
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:57,774
You see how shri Sita and Rama
have good attitude and are faithful each other

80
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:03,852
Even if she was left
Sita thought it her duty

81
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:09,942
She never complained
or talked ill of him

82
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:16,424
And effortlessly
she has raised her children

83
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:22,589
Shri Rama's children are
called Luv and Kush

84
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:31,491
They came as devotees
and we can see them as disciples

85
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,727
They represents Shisya (disciples)

86
00:13:34,737 --> 00:13:42,727
the power of Shisya
so we can be disciple of someone

87
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:48,757
As disciples they learned archery
when they were small

88
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:56,175
And learned Ramayana
and got proficiency in the music

89
00:13:56,547 --> 00:14:04,072
Showing the disciples must surrender completely
to the Guru

90
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:08,702
We also have a disciples in us

91
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:16,185
They were  completely surrendered to
 the Mother who is Shakti

92
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:22,137
Even they were about to fight
against Shri Rama

93
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:25,637
they kept Mother highest in the world

94
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:32,307
The mother cared them
and made them completely dharmic

95
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:35,227
It was her first duty

96
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:40,287
Not like today wives just cry
"my husband left me"

97
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:46,280
But with husband they fight always
and if he leaves they will cry

98
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:55,074
He has left no problem
I have children, I will care for them

99
00:14:55,107 --> 00:15:00,067
they will get all they need

100
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:09,847
Sitaj's life was special
with bravery and strength

101
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:12,767
Every woman must have it

102
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:17,837
Even if you are separated with your
husband or far away

103
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:25,637
there shouldn't be any loss
or shortage for children

104
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:31,310
Because her duty
is the most important thing

105
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:34,655
We shouldn't give up
most important thing

106
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:41,412
In sahaja yoga
all women should get this power

107
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:46,607
Shri Rama's life was
very pure and Nirmal

108
00:15:46,617 --> 00:15:49,677
he gave up everything
for his wife

109
00:15:50,597 --> 00:16:01,957
His wife had gone, he had to live alone
and he had to leave her

110
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:06,317
He gave up all the comforts of the life

111
00:16:06,327 --> 00:16:13,517
You know he used to sleep
on grass, on floor and walked barefeet

112
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:17,113
and wear clothes like saints

113
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:20,887
All these are not stories
it's a fact

114
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:28,987
In India many people used to have
high standard life

115
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:32,807
and they have never thought about
 small and low level things

116
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:41,903
But all these ideals of our country
have beccome fake

117
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:48,722
By singing bhajans to Ram
 we think we are done

118
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:51,852
we have got a kind of hypocracy

119
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:55,684
In countries without
these ideals

120
00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:01,052
people try to become the ideals
correcting themselves

121
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:05,843
If you have the ideal in front of us

122
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:10,197
you don't  become Shri Rama or Krishna

123
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:12,737
or you have anything to do with them

124
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:15,067
We feel like that

125
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:21,690
But if we have Shri Rama inside
his light can be in our attention

126
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:24,785
Let's understand

127
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:31,328
the circumstances when
Shri Rama came on earth

128
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:33,950
Sahaja Yogi must understand

129
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:43,957
If we get Shri Rama's state
All our political problems will go

130
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:49,040
when we decide to
become like shri Rama

131
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,257
Then everyone becomes good

132
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:19,787
firstly dharma, success and education
then the ideals

133
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:26,927
for that he made his life very idealistic

134
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:33,907
When someone tells you something
but he doesn't do it himself

135
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:38,489
Then how can you trust him and get his quality

136
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:42,747
There are many people who say
we believe in this and that

137
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:45,717
But they are opposite

138
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:54,651
Followers of Ram seems to be the biggest fraud politician
and they have many wives, impossible

139
00:18:55,057 --> 00:19:00,347
What is the duty of Sahaja Yogis' life?

140
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:05,828
we have to bring the light of god
in our attention

141
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:11,512
We must see and behave as Shri Rama

142
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:19,155
What would Shri Rama or Sita do
in this situation

143
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:24,832
What would Sita ji say?

144
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:29,111
How would Sita behave?
She is also Gruhlaxmi

145
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:34,737
As you know Sitaji took many births

146
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:41,307
Gruhlaxmi was in the form of Fatima-bi

147
00:19:41,332 --> 00:19:48,492
She was humbly in the house but all
dharma was done by her power

148
00:19:48,492 --> 00:19:54,802
Not necessary for her to go out
and give big lectures

149
00:19:54,827 --> 00:20:04,687
You can do that work at home
with children relatives and friends

150
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:09,577
you can spread sahaja Yoga at the house

151
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:13,807
After getting all of it
 you can go out to society

152
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:24,297
But ladies have to have purity like Sitaji first

153
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:28,557
First thing of the purity is
motherhood and love

154
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:35,187
When she was in exile never complained
 that my husband doesn't earn

155
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:40,402
He doesn't do this
he doesn't buy this and that

156
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:45,457
If he is in jungle so I am
What he will eat I wil

157
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:50,264
I don't eat before him
I serve him first

158
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:54,628
and  brother in law then I will eat

159
00:20:54,708 --> 00:21:08,707
Nowadays women think there is
much pressure of the work But it is not

160
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:15,663
A woman is like earth element
she can absorb

161
00:21:15,894 --> 00:21:20,609
So many are given by the earth

162
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:25,417
In the same way
women are like the earth

163
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:30,468
We have got so many powers
 that we can take everything inside

164
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:36,849
and shower the rain of love
God has given us the power

165
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:46,799
For example this fan is moving
Which one is greater, the power or fan?

166
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:55,187
If you think fan is greater as  it's moving
Then it's wrong

167
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:59,527
Women are ocean of shakti

168
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:04,402
With that support Men does their work

169
00:22:04,427 --> 00:22:11,666
They are potential and kinetic
Women are potential and men are kinetic

170
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:16,982
But if you start running like them

171
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:20,332
It's not good
No need for women

172
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:30,013
Each one is unique but equally important
But women can be good for both

173
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:34,652
When the time comes
women can be more productive

174
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:41,187
In Maharashtra
there was a 17-year-old widow named Tarabai

175
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:45,597
She was the daughter-in-law of Shivaji

176
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:50,027
Only she could defeat Aurangzeb

177
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:53,132
Her grave was built

178
00:22:53,132 --> 00:23:06,746
You must understand women can keep all her
power within her to become ferocious

179
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:19,167
But  if she waste her powers in
fighting, arguing, complaining or in frivolous things

180
00:23:19,177 --> 00:23:22,297
then her power would be gone

181
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:30,597
Women are so powerful that
she can work more than men if she want

182
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:34,074
But first of all
she must respect her powers

183
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:40,260
by scattering and wasting she becomes powerless

184
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:42,911
this kind of woman is not good

185
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:50,171
Women's job is very important and full of dignity

186
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:54,858
Women should be very modest and very wise

187
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:59,752
Let Men use bad words but women cannot

188
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:06,416
Men can argue and would fight
let them do but not Women

189
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:14,440
Their job is to make peace, protection and helping people

190
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:22,127
She is like shield not like sword
and sword cannot be shield

191
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:29,077
Shield is greater than sword
as shield can bear the sword

192
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:33,547
Sword can be broken
but not shield

193
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:42,167
So her most important power is humility

194
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:46,177
With humility comes all the powers

195
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:51,007
It's not difficult for sahaj yogis
not at all

196
00:24:51,017 --> 00:24:55,077
I see many sahaja yoginis chat a lot

197
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:58,777
anywhere they will chat with men

198
00:24:58,787 --> 00:25:03,067
"Mother help me" "what happened"

199
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:07,627
"The lady talks a lot please help me"

200
00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:10,552
"I am tired of her"

201
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:15,808
There isn't much to talk with men
What's the need?

202
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,410
Among women also

203
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:25,072
In sahaja yoga men study more

204
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:27,432
About Sahaja Yoga and the chakras

205
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:35,327
Which chakra is driving people and is catching?

206
00:25:35,337 --> 00:25:39,217
Man knows all
women would be left behind

207
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:41,129
Women must learn

208
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:47,692
For men Shri Rama is our ideal

209
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:53,392
In this sense Muslims are amazing

210
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:56,822
I don't want to say bad things

211
00:25:56,847 --> 00:26:03,507
Say if you go to Riyad
no  Muslim will see you

212
00:26:03,517 --> 00:26:08,137
they will respect women
If women are crossing the street

213
00:26:08,147 --> 00:26:12,307
they will stop the car
respecting women

214
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:17,177
But here it's opposite
I don't know why

215
00:26:17,187 --> 00:26:21,737
we see women with some intention

216
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:26,827
Seeing every woman
 they will break the neck

217
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:31,347
It's a big sin to see every woman

218
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:35,246
In sahaja yoga it's prohibited completely

219
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:40,542
Firstly you will spoil your eyes and Sahaja Yoga

220
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:45,587
Otherwise you may become blind

221
00:26:45,597 --> 00:26:49,697
Sometimes I see people have wandering eyes

222
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:54,072
While talking eyes are wandering
women too

223
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:59,387
The biggest loss is your attention

224
00:26:59,397 --> 00:27:02,627
Your attention goes here and there

225
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:07,012
then what's the use of self-realization

226
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:13,347
Without concentration Chitta can't be active

227
00:27:13,357 --> 00:27:18,537
Concentration must be obtained

228
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,210
In the west the disease is
more common among men

229
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:29,142
Western yogis are not alike
They know it's bad

230
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:33,257
They asked me the solution

231
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:42,772
Look at only ground and up to 3 feets
you don't have to see above

232
00:27:42,797 --> 00:27:51,167
Look at the ground
Yogis are walking looking at the ground abroad

233
00:27:51,177 --> 00:28:01,337
You see all good things, flowers and children
Nothing to see above

234
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:04,877
So, that's how you should control your chitta

235
00:28:04,877 --> 00:28:10,737
Shri Rama didn't need it
If you have a respect to shri Rama

236
00:28:10,762 --> 00:28:15,462
You must control your chitta like him

237
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:26,735
Tell your wife you respect her as shakti
But she has to deserve it

238
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:31,112
"Yatr naryan pujante tatr ramante devata"

239
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:41,951
"Where women are respected resides
god" But they have to be respectable

240
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:45,745
Please sit down

241
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:50,737
Don't move during Puja

242
00:28:50,737 --> 00:28:56,477
If the woman is worshipable
"Pujyante" means "worshipable"

243
00:28:56,477 --> 00:29:04,627
Who like to worship a bad woman
cruel Rakshasi?

244
00:29:04,627 --> 00:29:11,987
Those who are worshpable should be worshipped
There resides gods

245
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:16,893
Firstly they are mothers of children

246
00:29:16,918 --> 00:29:21,941
If husband scolds wife in front of children

247
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:26,497
then children will never respect mother

248
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:30,632
It's prime minister and deputy minister

249
00:29:30,657 --> 00:29:33,717
Women shouldn't insult her husband too

250
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:41,667
Power goes to children from father

251
00:29:41,707 --> 00:29:50,124
Without this basic understanding
they fight to take control

252
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:54,647
If woman knows handling of man
there won't be any fights

253
00:29:54,672 --> 00:30:00,927
Handling men is very easy
as they are just like children

254
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:06,612
they are innocent like children

255
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:10,252
By talking nonsense
 you can't handle them

256
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:13,521
You must forgive them as children

257
00:30:13,732 --> 00:30:17,312
If they fight outside
they get troubled

258
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:20,777
They can get angry only to wife

259
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:23,862
Getting angry at home is OK

260
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:33,024
Until you get this feeling, you cannot have
 mutual understanding, love and joy

261
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:39,119
Men also should care for wife's needs

262
00:30:39,144 --> 00:30:51,102
if wife is wrong, husband has duty to say no
"It's wrong, I won't do this"

263
00:30:51,102 --> 00:30:57,522
But no need to fight on small things
It doesn't look good as sahaja yogis

264
00:30:57,547 --> 00:31:01,277
I am surprised that
Sahaja couples fight each other

265
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:07,207
They come to complain about each other

266
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:16,432
How come sahaja couple cannot be together peacefully
while I'm talking about peace to the whole world

267
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,717
It won't work out if you are fighting like that

268
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:27,876
Husband has to have complete
understanding of his wife first

269
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:36,527
And know that all the other women
are like your sisters and mothers

270
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:41,332
If someone is not clean even after Sahaja Yoga
then there's no way out

271
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:46,362
There was a swiss man
not a Sahaja Yogi

272
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:52,267
Not Indian
He was a father of a Sahaja Yogini

273
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:59,112
Girl's husband had wandering
eyes but came to sahaja yoga

274
00:31:59,137 --> 00:32:07,135
They both came to Sahaja Yoga
The girl is very good but he went on doing it

275
00:32:07,254 --> 00:32:12,437
The non-yogi father told her to leave him

276
00:32:12,437 --> 00:32:18,797
"Even after sahaja yoga if he can't be cleansed
then leave him"

277
00:32:18,797 --> 00:32:26,937
"He is not a Sahaja Yogi don't relate with him"

278
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:35,977
Even Non-Sahaja Yogi can understand
that the person can't be cleansed

279
00:32:35,977 --> 00:32:42,787
He doesn't have stable attention
then it is bad

280
00:32:42,787 --> 00:32:50,347
Our culture is that men and women
must be brother and sister

281
00:32:50,347 --> 00:32:57,307
But I see a talkative woman
just go to talk to men

282
00:32:57,307 --> 00:33:06,017
I don't understand it
They don't sit with other ladies but with men

283
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:11,692
Same with men just start chatting with women

284
00:33:11,692 --> 00:33:21,862
Even with maid or anyone
just start talking, no self-esteem

285
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:29,307
We think it's masculinity but Shri Rama is
the perfect man who is highest

286
00:33:29,317 --> 00:33:35,307
But the one at the bottom
think they are perfect

287
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:40,587
Where is perfection?
Not believing in Shri Rama but in devil

288
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:44,237
If you believe in Shri Rama
follow his ideal

289
00:33:44,237 --> 00:33:49,673
Therefore children and women
are getting spoiled

290
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:55,187
But still Indian women maintained
good culture here

291
00:33:55,187 --> 00:34:05,007
If they were like Americans what it would have been
Men are fixed in terrible condition there

292
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:18,607
After 2-3 marriages Men becomes
bunkrupt but women make a palace

293
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:22,637
It's bad in America
Children are running away from home

294
00:34:22,637 --> 00:34:31,777
Indian woman manage their house
husband and children

295
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:37,652
But it's changing
They think the same like husbands

296
00:34:37,677 --> 00:34:43,077
If he runs away with 10 women
then we go with 15 men

297
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:48,927
If he is going to hell then I go before him

298
00:34:48,927 --> 00:34:54,262
Women shouldn't do it
The base of dharma is in woman's hand

299
00:34:54,262 --> 00:35:01,882
Woman must manage husband dharmic
making him understand

300
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:07,484
This is the biggest duty and power
of woman to be Dharmaic

301
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:15,147
Biggest dharma is forgiveness
Without it nothing works out

302
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:20,397
First thing she must have forgiveness
Forgive children, husband

303
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:24,857
give refuge to house servants
all are her duty

304
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:35,478
This is the work that Shri Rama couldn't do
neither Shri Krishna nor Shri Jesus

305
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:48,647
Rama would have killed everyone
who is useless, adharmic and flirt

306
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:52,057
Don't know how many he would be finished

307
00:35:52,057 --> 00:35:57,667
Krishna would use his sudarshan
chakra and there would be a battle

308
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:00,902
Christ would crucify himself

309
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:07,172
One crucifiction is better than everyday

310
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:13,327
Only Mother can do this work
 With such a power of love

311
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:17,900
Anything can be worked out with her power of love

312
00:36:17,932 --> 00:36:24,557
She holds everything with so much love
that children don't mind correcting

313
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:31,997
For instance when trouble comes only mother
knows how to handle it and scold later

314
00:36:31,997 --> 00:36:37,217
Because children understands mother's love
and it is for them

315
00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:44,927
With father children may react
but not with mother's love without expectation

316
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:54,062
She doesn't want anything but her children to be good
and get all my powers, all good in me

317
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:59,122
If mother feels it children will be fine

318
00:36:59,147 --> 00:37:06,597
But some mothers are very interfering
and get involved in everything

319
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:10,927
She comes always in front
while husband is at the back

320
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,927
Children will be spoiled by it

321
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:22,000
Under such harmful environment children
can be very emotional

322
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,152
So woman should be behind
and make her husband in front

323
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:31,837
Whatever husbands do
wifes must help him behind

324
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:41,227
The source of his power is wife
Then how pure and hard-working she should be

325
00:37:41,227 --> 00:37:48,057
I put everything on woman
because I know you have great powers inside

326
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:53,047
Look at me as a Mother
I must make everyone saints

327
00:37:53,047 --> 00:37:57,977
Curing many diseases
to make people saints

328
00:37:57,977 --> 00:38:03,127
Did anyone do this job?
Only Ahilya was saved

329
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:06,392
Jesus saved 21 people

330
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:09,672
I must have saved 21000 now

331
00:38:09,697 --> 00:38:14,702
Going around the world to do
everyone's job

332
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:21,392
it's still going on but I don't feel
because of love

333
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:28,437
Maybe I should put bandhan
as I don't know what kind of people I meet

334
00:38:28,437 --> 00:38:32,917
But as soon as people comes to me
 I absorb all the problems

335
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:40,442
So love acts by itself
I know everything is done by love

336
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:47,420
I don't feel bad whatever happens
Only Mother can bear the pain

337
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:55,997
So I want you to grow consistantly
without hurdles

338
00:38:56,007 --> 00:39:04,457
Also men should help their wives fully
Understand and respect them

339
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:13,768
Until the 2 wheels gets balanced
the chariot doesn't go forward

340
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:21,582
They both should be the same but
one on the left and the other on the right

341
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:26,467
It won't work if you change it

342
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:39,892
It is moving and working
because they are the same but unique

343
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:54,867
Same in the sense of height
length and width but they work differently

344
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:59,917
It's the same in our life

345
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:11,897
Shri Rama didn't think
only about husband and wife

346
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:17,587
Didn't think only about children and family

347
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:26,602
Also of brother, sister, mother, father
and everyone as a normal human being

348
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:33,152
After he thought about society

349
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:39,337
About public, state and country

350
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:50,687
As a human being he has shown
human ideals in his activities

351
00:40:50,687 --> 00:41:00,917
The person who loved his wife so much
knew she was pure and hed left her

352
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:12,712
Now people give so much to their own wife
but they never give to poor people

353
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:18,602
Otherwise they give to their relatives
It's a disease among politicians

354
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:28,372
But the one who has wife who is sakshat
devi had to leave her

355
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:36,937
We must understand it's attachment
to relatives and possessions

356
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:44,257
In west marriage relation wasn't alright
but after Sahaja Yoga wife became everything

357
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:52,145
Here leaders had to leave
because their wives were not alright

358
00:41:52,287 --> 00:41:56,727
Their attention got spoiled
by wife's preaching

359
00:41:56,737 --> 00:42:00,976
At least five yogi left
 because of their wives

360
00:42:01,442 --> 00:42:12,467
Wives should understand Sahaja Yoga
and their role in it

361
00:42:12,467 --> 00:42:18,207
In this case husbands shouldn't
agree with their wives at all

362
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:24,167
Tell her that “You talk and move
too much, Be quiet"

363
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:27,587
You are useless
Your chakras are not alright

364
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:32,712
She will be alright only in this way

365
00:42:32,712 --> 00:42:39,017
But instead you blame yourself
and obey your wife?

366
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:42,112
If she tells you to steal, you do it?

367
00:42:42,137 --> 00:42:50,627
Even after Sahaja Yoga you still
have some catches to take care

368
00:42:50,627 --> 00:43:01,627
On the occasion of Shri Rama
Hanuman should be remembered as his great devotee

369
00:43:01,627 --> 00:43:06,107
And how he was busy at his service

370
00:43:06,107 --> 00:43:18,102
He was aware that his life is
for serving Shri Rama

371
00:43:18,102 --> 00:43:25,282
We should have his awereness in Sahaj Yoga

372
00:43:25,307 --> 00:43:32,047
But it doesn't mean you cook food for
me which I don't eat

373
00:43:32,047 --> 00:43:38,382
You trouble me cooking so much
this and that

374
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:44,382
Don't keep on serving someone forcefully

375
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:50,567
What we need is zeal to serve (Sewa)

376
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:54,062
Hanuman didn't serve food to Shri Rama

377
00:43:54,062 --> 00:43:57,465
Delhi people kept on
serving food so much

378
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:03,317
that I had to tell them
I wouln't come if you don't stop

379
00:44:03,484 --> 00:44:07,267
Do what you have to do

380
00:44:07,267 --> 00:44:11,529
It's bad to force someone to eat

381
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:15,152
serving one after another

382
00:44:15,177 --> 00:44:19,217
I don't need anything
and I am tired

383
00:44:19,227 --> 00:44:26,996
I told you only flowers
But don't spend too much also

384
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:34,682
A lot of flowers make me
worry sometimes

385
00:44:34,707 --> 00:44:42,984
Please your Mother in balance
She is a simple woman who don't understand these

386
00:44:43,442 --> 00:44:51,012
We have to learn that zeal to serve is
from Hanuman ji

387
00:44:51,037 --> 00:44:55,977
There is no special service for me

388
00:44:56,002 --> 00:45:03,092
But if you want to serve me
 serve to Sahaj Yoga

389
00:45:04,797 --> 00:45:08,297
Serving to Sahaja Yoga is
serving to me

390
00:45:08,297 --> 00:45:12,877
How many realisation have you given

391
00:45:12,902 --> 00:45:16,401
How many did you transform and inspire

392
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:22,857
But if you say to new people
they have bhoot, they just leave

393
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:33,717
One gentleman was told he has
3 bhoots in him so he left Sahaja Yoga

394
00:45:33,717 --> 00:45:38,517
he was told number of bhoots even

395
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:45,301
he believed it because the Yogi
was an authority in the local area

396
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:49,817
I don't know who
but the person left

397
00:45:49,817 --> 00:45:56,257
So what we have to learn
from Hanuman is the zeal

398
00:45:56,257 --> 00:46:00,137
" Ram kaj karne ko tatpar"
(eager to do Ram's work)

399
00:46:00,137 --> 00:46:04,677
What is our work?
My work is sahaj yoga

400
00:46:04,677 --> 00:46:09,027
My work is sahaj yoga
 To raise kundalini

401
00:46:09,037 --> 00:46:13,770
To make people peaceful and lovable
talking about love

402
00:46:13,795 --> 00:46:27,227
Talk about Sahaja Yoga, about chakras
Make them understand

403
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:34,437
Doesn't mean you start giving lecture
Some people started to give so much lecture

404
00:46:34,437 --> 00:46:40,097
I had to tell them to stop
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga will be finished

405
00:46:40,107 --> 00:46:47,987
Only long lectures
No time for Mother's talk and Aarti

406
00:46:47,997 --> 00:46:52,902
He said he just can't stop

407
00:46:52,902 --> 00:46:57,232
He doesn't know why
"How can I fix it?"

408
00:46:57,232 --> 00:47:00,722
"You put supari (spice) in your mouth"

409
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:05,717
Then "How much?"

410
00:47:05,717 --> 00:47:09,577
"It depends on the size of your mouth"

411
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:15,407
"You don't know it even then
how come you talk aobut Sahaja Yoga"

412
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:18,907
you don't know it even

413
00:47:18,907 --> 00:47:21,457
People like giving lecture

414
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:28,077
Get on a stage and won't leave a mic

415
00:47:28,077 --> 00:47:34,057
Once with mic they cant't leave
It's a new disease

416
00:47:34,057 --> 00:47:40,807
So you must understand
why to give lecture

417
00:47:40,832 --> 00:47:49,757
There are so many Mother's talk
you can put a tape or video in every program

418
00:47:49,757 --> 00:48:02,627
After people can write question on paper
And ask them to bring it next program

419
00:48:02,627 --> 00:48:06,927
If there are someone
who is sick or in trouble

420
00:48:06,937 --> 00:48:13,737
Now there is a Yogi
He comes to cure in Calcutta

421
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:21,187
Now he was called to Russia

422
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:25,529
One person is running like
Hanuman all over to cure

423
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:30,914
You all can cure
All women can do

424
00:48:30,939 --> 00:48:34,321
All men also
But nobody tries

425
00:48:34,575 --> 00:48:38,877
By giving lecture how many were cured?

426
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:40,512
I don't know why only one in India

427
00:48:40,512 --> 00:48:41,012
don't know what's the matter
 that till now there is only one man in India
 who can cure people

428
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:52,117
In London there are 15~20 people
who can cure and in France also

429
00:48:52,117 --> 00:48:58,459
One should learn working on people
like giving bandhan

430
00:48:58,515 --> 00:49:09,257
No need to invite someone from abroad
Remove Sahaja Yoga badges if you cannot cure

431
00:49:09,257 --> 00:49:14,232
How do you work on others
if you can't cure even yourself

432
00:49:14,257 --> 00:49:20,272
Everybody has got
all the power to cure anyone

433
00:49:20,272 --> 00:49:24,157
Learn to become masters

434
00:49:24,157 --> 00:49:29,127
Instead of inviting someone
They should go out to cure

435
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:34,650
Just have some courage to work
Nothing will happen

436
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:44,469
By working, you become deeper like
a tree grows deeper as it expands

437
00:49:44,935 --> 00:49:52,882
Sahaja Yogis are very much different
from Incarnations

438
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:57,967
They have never worked in society before

439
00:49:57,967 --> 00:50:02,397
Nobody had the power for a mass

440
00:50:02,422 --> 00:50:08,282
Only one to one
Like King Janaka to Nachiketa

441
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:17,542
But now you all have it
Just grow it, that's all

442
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:24,427
Cure yourself and others
Understand Sahaja Yoga, you have everything

443
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:30,147
But still your attention is wondering
What are you running after?

444
00:50:30,147 --> 00:50:36,795
You still don't understand it
Sahaja Yoga is just blessing

445
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:41,147
You won't be in short of anything

446
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:46,547
Just work for sahaja Yoga
Even if you don't work you will be blessed

447
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:52,677
Business or promotion,
this and that

448
00:50:52,702 --> 00:50:59,520
Everyone is blessed and
nothing to give up

449
00:50:59,545 --> 00:51:05,200
Otherwise in time of freedom fight

450
00:51:05,387 --> 00:51:11,443
we were tortured
Lied on ice, got electric shocks

451
00:51:11,482 --> 00:51:15,972
My parents went to jail
Our house was sold

452
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:23,737
Lived in a hut... had to sacrifice a lot
And you don't have to do it

453
00:51:23,737 --> 00:51:28,707
But not only recieving
You have to give

454
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:36,045
If one door is open so should be the other one
Only one doesn't work

455
00:51:36,064 --> 00:51:42,773
Everyone reports me
about blessings they got

456
00:51:44,012 --> 00:51:50,967
We must see what we have done for others

457
00:51:51,017 --> 00:52:03,477
But there are many fights for leadership
It's all mother's play

458
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:07,627
You will know it when you will fall from there

459
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:14,356
Specially women shouldn't get involved
They fall very soon

460
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:19,347
And men should know
there is nothing like ministers

461
00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:22,982
This is Mother's play
Don't get involved in

462
00:52:22,982 --> 00:52:30,994
Why I call a leader? It's a play
There are no leaders

463
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:39,737
It's just a test if you have ego
If you have, you are gone

464
00:52:39,737 --> 00:52:46,507
It will be shown immediately
In Sahaja Yoga everything gets exposed

465
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:51,410
Even if I say something
 it shows on the faces

466
00:52:51,426 --> 00:52:59,149
Once some leaders came and
confessed their mistakes

467
00:52:59,205 --> 00:53:08,817
They have more responsibilities to be
better, sweet, humble and loving

468
00:53:08,817 --> 00:53:13,207
and become close and sharing with everyone

469
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:22,277
Now on the auspicious occasion of Shri Rama
we must understand what he had showen

470
00:53:22,302 --> 00:53:28,229
Only a bit of it would please our Mother

471
00:53:28,267 --> 00:53:39,402
He was in exile for a long time in Jungle
Walked barefeet, worked so hard

472
00:53:39,402 --> 00:53:43,352
Just to obey his father

473
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:47,362
Now to obey me
you don't need to go into exile

474
00:53:47,362 --> 00:53:52,647
Not barefeet, nor starving nothing
All are there for you

475
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:59,247
But you must know how to cure people
in Sahaja Yoga

476
00:53:59,247 --> 00:54:02,727
everything about sahaj yoga

477
00:54:02,754 --> 00:54:07,412
and mostly about love

478
00:54:07,437 --> 00:54:15,197
it's nothing but power of love
Everybody will be benefited

479
00:54:15,197 --> 00:54:21,727
This is not only for special people

480
00:54:21,737 --> 00:54:28,940
This is not only for one country
but for the whole world

481
00:54:29,402 --> 00:54:38,247
Watch how your attention is
If it's disturbed we should correct it

482
00:54:38,324 --> 00:54:45,437
Put the power of spirit in it
Do everything with concentration

483
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:52,080
And devotion and love will
make you deep

484
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:58,970
Otherwise there is lots of rubbish

485
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:06,896
If you wish to stay like rubbish
you know where it goes at the end

486
00:55:06,983 --> 00:55:11,727
If you want to feel you are
specially good capable of anything

487
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:17,926
First humility, not only towards me
but everyone

488
00:55:18,093 --> 00:55:30,805
Talk humbly with love and show that
people can blossom like lotus in Sahaja Yoga

489
00:55:30,908 --> 00:55:33,402
to spread fragrance everywhere

490
00:55:33,402 --> 00:55:42,007
People will tell me you are wonderful
if you will do it in that way

491
00:55:42,007 --> 00:55:47,128
One day you too will be called as
Maryada Purushottama

492
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:53,189
You are the temple of Rama
so have it within yourself

493
00:55:53,237 --> 00:55:59,276
Perform puja to it
Take care of your self-esteem

494
00:55:59,808 --> 00:56:08,765
Take the benefit of self-realization
inside yourself

495
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:13,397
You must have respect and devotion to it

496
00:56:13,397 --> 00:56:21,695
"Now we are realized"
"How can we do wrong, we are yogi"

497
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:28,387
Soon you will have blessings
immediately

498
00:56:28,387 --> 00:56:34,525
As I am called Rokra devi, you will get
blessing as soon as you assert it

499
00:56:34,771 --> 00:56:44,177
Everyone is getting blessed with it
give it back to the world

500
00:56:44,202 --> 00:56:57,912
Shri Rama used all his powers for the
benevolence of people to show the ideal

501
00:56:57,912 --> 00:57:05,812
You will be surprised to achieve so high
when the time comes

502
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:13,832
You won't have any disease and
all bad habits will be dropped

503
00:57:13,857 --> 00:57:22,042
You will eat, talk and watch
as much as you need

504
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:34,419
You will watch your mind
for introspection

505
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:45,205
"Where is my mind going?"
"I'm a Sahaja Yogi, stop it"

506
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:50,003
By doing so
you will be in meditation

507
00:57:50,028 --> 00:57:56,360
Your kundalini will be satisfied
and give you blessings

508
00:57:56,385 --> 00:57:59,365
You say,
"Mother what a blessing"

509
00:57:59,537 --> 00:58:04,240
But you have to jump into it
Only then will you know it

510
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:08,712
Till then you need to work hard

511
00:58:08,712 --> 00:58:14,792
Shri Rama was born
at midnight so let's have puja late

512
00:58:14,817 --> 00:58:21,879
Shri Rama Puja is not
a specially long one

513
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:33,791
As he is in a human form
he is humanity within us

514
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:46,552
by which we understand our intellect
and our thoughts get changed

515
00:58:46,577 --> 00:58:53,847
Shri Rama is that
Through him we can change our thoughts

516
00:58:53,847 --> 00:59:00,017
Our nature can change
Because he is our ideal

517
00:59:00,017 --> 00:59:07,438
After achieving his ideals we reach another
because he was human ideal

518
00:59:07,487 --> 00:59:13,667
It is great that God came to this world
in a human form to became our ideal

519
00:59:13,698 --> 00:59:23,472
He has gone through all the hardships
to show us strength to keep Dharma

520
00:59:23,497 --> 00:59:28,180
That is Vishwa Dharma
and the state of yoga

521
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:32,807
May God bless you all
