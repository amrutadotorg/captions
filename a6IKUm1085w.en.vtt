00:03:17.700 --> 00:12:38.160
Nishat Khan: Shri Mataji, it’s always a&nbsp;
special honour to be here, to play for you.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.520
And we are very grateful to be invited.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:49.260
And in a way, I invited myself this time,
to come and to play for you.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:58.020
Because I know that Shri Ganesha&nbsp;
Puja is a very important puja.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:05.100
And I want to play for you some compositions from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.860
guru vandana [respect for elders?],
and so I will play, because of this time,&nbsp;

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:25.800
we still have light of the evening,
I will play raga Marva [Then Yaman].

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.820
[Concert]

00:13:29.820 --> 00:14:07.080
[Starts at 1:08:26]

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.820
Nishat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:28.620
Khan:&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:28.680
I’ve played many concerts but&nbsp;
I have never played Marwa.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:35.280
I have never played Marwa for Shri Mataji,
because I wanted to play for very long time.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:38.760
And when I arrived this evening,&nbsp;

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:47.340
somebody told me that Shri Mataji&nbsp;
has asked to play now, at 6:30.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.840
I said in this light?

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.720
And I thought Shri Mataji knows.&nbsp;

01:08:52.260 --> 01:09:00.000
So, I’m really happy that I got to play this&nbsp;
beautiful spiritual raga for you, Madam.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:12.120
Shri Mataji: I must say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.319
apologize also,&nbsp;

01:09:16.319 --> 01:10:04.259
that Nishat Khan had told me that he&nbsp;
would like to play on a Ganesha Puja.

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:05.520
I had agreed also.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.540
But as you know the Swiss are very
particular about time.

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:12.100
They make all the watches.
[Laughter]

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:19.440
So, also we thought as there is very short time,&nbsp;

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:25.980
I felt that he may not be happy to&nbsp;
play for a short time something,&nbsp;

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:30.280
because he likes to play for a long period.
[Laughter]

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.940
But that’s our privilege.

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:40.740
But this time, as you know,&nbsp;
I have to go on Monday,&nbsp;

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.340
and I have not done yet my packing or anything.

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.400
And then from there, directly to Russia.&nbsp;

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:55.200
It’s going to be quite a fast&nbsp;
movement of marathon race of mine.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:03.900
So, we just thought that we’d better get somebody
who is just coming up as a musician.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:09.660
And then we can have such a&nbsp;
great artist like him later on&nbsp;

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:11.940
when he will have more time to play.

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:18.960
Especially, Marva is a raga&nbsp;
which I like the most, perhaps.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:23.640
Because it is, as he says, it’s&nbsp;
very meditative and very deep.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:31.800
And I remember first time, long, long time back,
Asad Ali [Khan] sahib was there and he had&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:32.520
invited me.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.660
They had never seen.

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:41.700
And he was just playing some sort&nbsp;
of a Bengali tune to begin with.

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.640
And Sahaja Yogis told me that, “We were bored.&nbsp;

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.620
And we thought he’s better&nbsp;
stop, that will be better”.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:47.460
It’s in the beginning.

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:54.600
And as soon as he saw me on the doorstep,
suddenly he told me his hand started moving.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.580
And he played Marva.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:58.920
My husband doesn’t like Marva.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.320
Today only, first time&nbsp;
again, it’s the second time,&nbsp;

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.660
that this was real Marva here.

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:10.860
He, you see, he’s a –
No, no but something I must tell you that,&nbsp;

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.780
that Marva he started playing.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:19.080
And after that, Asad Ali sahib&nbsp;
became a great artist also.

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.160
But that Marva, really, filled&nbsp;
me completely with vibrations.

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:27.600
He said, “Mother, I don’t know.
I knew all these things, but normally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.720
they don’t come to you easily.
But as soon as&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:36.660
you stand, I saw you standing there,
and my hand started moving on Marva”.

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:41.880
I said, “You made the whole&nbsp;
palace of Marva before me”.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.940
I cannot also forget that Marva, as this one.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:49.860
Because this is a raga very difficult, they say,&nbsp;

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:54.300
because you have to have spiritual depth.
Otherwise, you cannot play this.

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.100
And you all have enjoyed it.

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:59.820
Though commonly, people don’t like Marva so much.

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:03.600
But in Maharashtra it is&nbsp;
very, very much appreciated.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.760
And also in Punjab, I must say that&nbsp;
the ragis always sing in Marvara.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.440
So, it was very kind of you&nbsp;
to have chosen this raga.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.100
Because – and you went into&nbsp;
a kind of a, I don’t know,&nbsp;

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.460
what we call sanchar, both of you.

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:25.440
Sanchar is some Ganesha entered into&nbsp;
them and started playing, I think.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.780
The way they played was really very divine,
very beautiful, very remarkable.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.020
And this raga is very fulfilling.

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:39.930
The way he has played, this is the second&nbsp;
time I am hearing such a nice Marva.

01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:46.980
You see and because I know I’m very old
and I heard so many people singing this.

01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:52.500
Long time back also, I heard&nbsp;
Abdul Karim Khan in Marva.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:56.160
He was another one, he used to just&nbsp;
pull your strings of your heart,&nbsp;

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.500
as you feel it, the way he sang.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:06.180
So, there are people who have been&nbsp;
singing and also playing Marva.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:10.680
But playing Marva is not an easy&nbsp;
thing, I think, it’s easier to sing.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.393
Nishat Khan: [Hindi].

01:14:12.393 --> 01:14:15.000
Shri Mataji: [Hindi].

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.820
So, this two times I was, say, twice,
I have had this really thrilling&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:31.860
experience of such ascendance,
that the whole audience rises in spirituality.

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:36.300
It is a raga to be really&nbsp;
mastered and to be understood.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:41.520
I’m happy you all have enjoyed it
because I don’t think you have heard Marva before,&nbsp;

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.200
anybody playing before you.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.880
So, it was a very good choice.

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:55.980
Then our- another player is Sukhvinder Singh,
who is very well known all over, I tell you.

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.400
He said, “One thing I’ve missed in life”.&nbsp;

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.280
I said, “What?”
Tabla by Sukhvinder Singh.

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:09.900
Moreover, I have another relationship with him,&nbsp;

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:13.140
because Namdharis are the first&nbsp;
who entered into Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:19.560
Even in Taiwan and places like&nbsp;
that, these Namdharis came in&nbsp;

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.180
and they said, “Mother you are&nbsp;
doing what is predicted about you”.

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:30.720
They gave me writing from the Guru Gobind Singh,&nbsp;

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.780
where it is described in the&nbsp;
future, what will happen,&nbsp;

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:38.040
and how somebody will come and&nbsp;
give you Realization and all that.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:38.940
That’s all with me.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:42.300
So, I was very much touched by them.

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:43.560
Of course, now in Punjab,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:49.560
you have many Sikhs who have become Sahaja Yogis.
Many, many Sikhs who have become Sahaja Yogis.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:55.260
And Punjab, also, I went because they&nbsp;
came to Ganapatipule, some of them.

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.980
And they were just rolling on&nbsp;
the stage, you see, halfway.&nbsp;

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:02.040
And saying, “Mother, come&nbsp;
to Punjab, come to Punjab”.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:06.540
And Punjab was a disturbed&nbsp;
area but then CP allowed me.

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:12.780
And now we have many Sikhs,&nbsp;
many, many Sikhs in Punjab,&nbsp;

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:17.460
in the sense that, in their&nbsp;
Chandigarh and also Rawalpindi.

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:20.580
All over, they have taken to Sahaja Yoga.&nbsp;

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:24.720
And I’m sure this will work&nbsp;
out, the peace in that country.

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:27.420
It has now. It is much better.

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:31.740
Punjab is the place where I studied&nbsp;
and I like Punjabis very much.

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:38.640
And I find now this movement of Sahaja&nbsp;
Yoga is so much appreciated by Sikhs,&nbsp;

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.020
as well as by Hindus.

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:45.120
And also some Muslims met me.
They called me in their village.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:51.660
And they said, “Why? Why are we denied?
This is a promised in our Quran that we’ll&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:55.500
get Qiyama, we’ll get resurrection.
And why should you deny it?”

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.360
I said, “I didn’t. You should have come”.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.720
So, the whole village was Muslim village.
And it worked out.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:11.040
I tell you, it was so much of a assurance
that this world will come to that global&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:18.720
emancipation,
to that transformation, that there will be peace.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:21.240
Without peace you can’t hear this music.&nbsp;

01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:25.860
If there is no peace in your heart,&nbsp;
how can you enjoy this music?

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:29.100
You cannot play this music and you cannot enjoy.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.900
Anything that is beautiful, you cannot&nbsp;
enjoy unless until there is peace.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:38.220
And so, I’m going for this&nbsp;
mission of creating peace.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.800
And I’m happy you all enjoyed it.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:45.060
I must say that these artists&nbsp;
are very near the Divine&nbsp;

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:50.160
because the way they emit these&nbsp;
vibrations by which we feel so peaceful,&nbsp;

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:57.060
so relaxed and so much of the&nbsp;
Spirit, that is within you, shines.

01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:04.380
So, it’s a very reciprocal activity
between the musicians&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.420
and all of you who are here and who are enjoying.

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:13.680
I don’t know every time, even Asad&nbsp;
Ali Khan says and he also says,&nbsp;

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.740
that in my presence, they can go into ecstasy.

01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.120
Possibly. I don’t know.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.020
But what I have got is a just a mother’s love.

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:27.540
And I feel these are my children who&nbsp;
are artists, and they have to come up.

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:32.460
They have to come up because they have&nbsp;
to give joy to all the people, pure joy.

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:34.980
And this is what you are&nbsp;
enjoying and I’m happy about it.

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:39.600
I’m sorry because of this time&nbsp;
limit, due to your watches, you see,&nbsp;

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.660
[Laughter]
we had to little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:48.480
adjust it and he’ll play one more raga,
because we have other programs also.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.320
[Hindi&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:05.400
conversation]

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:12.280
Sir C.P.:&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:25.080
It is quite true that Marva is not an easy raga to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:30.120
appreciate.
And one must know music very well.

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:33.180
But I assure you that from today,&nbsp;

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:36.600
I have begun not only to like,&nbsp;
but become a devotee of Marva.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:49.440
Sahaja Yoga means transformation.

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.820
And even in me, you have brought&nbsp;
about transformation for music today.

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:56.920
So, thank you very much it was excellent.
[Applause]

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:13.860
So, now, we’ll have another raga played by him
and which you all are enjoying as it is.

01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:17.100
And he, they are now lost in the heavens, I think,&nbsp;

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:21.420
where, from where all these&nbsp;
beautiful renderings are coming.

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:30.360
And I don’t know how this rapport&nbsp;
is established and how it works out.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:35.940
But more and more musicians must be encouraged
and you also should learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:43.320
music, I would say,
to appreciate this kind of thing.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:49.860
It requires not only the practice, the ryas,
but also a spiritual help.

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:52.860
Otherwise, you don’t hear this kind of music.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:21:00.834
This is some sort of a very&nbsp;
‘ruki kamale’ [unsure; Hindi]

01:21:00.835 --> 01:21:02.700
Nishat Khan:&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:08.460
You know, sometimes, there are&nbsp;
some difficulties arising suddenly,&nbsp;

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:18.480
when I have to come.
But because of Mataji, somehow, it works out.

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:21.167
I’m very grateful.

01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:21.670
Shri Mataji: No, no.

01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:21.703
Nishat Khan: I’m very grateful.

01:21:21.703 --> 01:21:25.140
Shri Mataji: You see, I wanted you to come&nbsp;
first because of the shortage of time.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:32.940
Nishat Khan: This is the first&nbsp;
time I’m playing at 7:00 in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:32.940 --> 01:22:15.780
evening for you.
[Laughter]

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:20.820
So, I have a chance to play&nbsp;
little Marva, little Yaman.

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:24.600
Shri Mataji: All these&nbsp;
ragas are to be played also.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.580
Because you people start after 10:00,&nbsp;

01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:29.449
so you just go with Jaijaivanti&nbsp;
and Malkauns and all that.

01:22:29.449 --> 01:22:32.040
What about these ragas?
They have to be played.

02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:39.540
We all must really thank Nishat Khan&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:44.580
and Sukhvinder Singh,
both of them very much,&nbsp;

02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:51.780
for giving us such a great joy
great joy entertaining our Spirit.

02:00:54.780 --> 02:01:01.920
Today, I was reminded of another&nbsp;
great musicians in India,&nbsp;

02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:05.400
who played before me Yaman raga.

02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:21.540
And you see, we must say that today is Shri&nbsp;
Ganesha’s birthday we are celebrating here.

02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:27.540
And this is the first raga all&nbsp;
the musicians have to learn:&nbsp;

02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:31.620
Yaman raga is the first&nbsp;
raga they all have to learn.

02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:35.460
This is the Shri Ganesha, as they&nbsp;
say, Shri Ganesha of the music&nbsp;

02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:37.020
starts with Yaman raga.

02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:40.620
So, it was very appropriate&nbsp;
to play this raga here.

02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:48.420
This raga, as I was telling you what&nbsp;
Parveen Sultana also sang before me.

02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:50.520
She’s a very great artist, I must say,&nbsp;

02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:54.420
and normally people said that she&nbsp;
becomes very shrill or something.

02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:59.280
But no, she was excellent.
She sings so well and she’s such a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:04.260
fast-moving person, Parveen Sultana.

02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:08.520
But that day, it happened&nbsp;
that her harmonium player,&nbsp;

02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:11.880
I know her because she was&nbsp;
working in Khadi Bhandar.

02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:16.560
So, the harmonium player came and asked me,
“What have you done to this lady?&nbsp;

02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:21.300
After every 5 minutes, she shouts at me normally.&nbsp;

02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:26.280
But today, what have you done?
What magic you have created that she was&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:32.220
so silent and so beautifully singing and this.
And she also didn’t become that shrillness”.

02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:37.140
Another brother of mine who is&nbsp;
a great connoisseur, he said,&nbsp;

02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:41.040
“I’ve never heard this woman&nbsp;
singing so beautifully raga Yaman”.

02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:48.840
And then one gentleman from&nbsp;
there came, shouted at her that,&nbsp;

02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:54.240
“You sing a particular ghazal” which may&nbsp;
be little romantic side or whatever it is.

02:02:54.240 --> 02:03:00.480
She said, “Do you know before whom I am I singing?
How could you ask such a thing!”

02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:05.400
I was amazed at her.
She said, “Such a thing I can’t sing before this”.

02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:09.720
So, you know, in the music&nbsp;
also, when they are playing,&nbsp;

02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:16.440
I think they go into that realm of purity,
where they cannot stand anything impure or stupid.

02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:22.380
This, I was so surprised at&nbsp;
her playing just a Yaman raga,&nbsp;

02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:28.440
which is the basic, the child.
It is the child, the innocence of music.

02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:34.620
Because the first raga you learn is this
and that as he sang was,&nbsp;

02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:35.700
“Guru binaka esay gunaka he, Guru&nbsp;
namah neto gunaya we [unsure]”

02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:42.300
It’s the one where they say that,
“Without the guru,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:47.940
how can we get any virtues within us?
How can we get any qualities within us?”

02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:56.280
And this is the first thing they have to learn,
that you have to be very obedient to your guru.

02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:59.940
And I know everybody, all of them,
must have also&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:04.800
known their gurus have been&nbsp;
very, very strict people&nbsp;

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:08.820
and extremely meticulous, but&nbsp;
that’s why they are there.

02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:18.000
It’s such a, at such an young age, I mean
to see such improvisation, permutations,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:21.900
combinations of the music,
is something really out of the blue.

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:25.560
You cannot think because, I told&nbsp;
you, I’ve heard so many people,&nbsp;

02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:29.760
but heard all of them after 45, 50 years of age.

02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:31.980
They were not young people like you.

02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:39.000
Despite that, you have not only&nbsp;
done such justice to this music,&nbsp;

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.260
but also what your forefathers&nbsp;
have given you, is a treasure.

02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:46.200
I tell you, what your forefathers have given you,&nbsp;

02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:49.680
there is no need for you&nbsp;
to make new tunes, nothing.

02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:52.440
There, so much is there, so much!

02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:57.270
And when you see there are 900&nbsp;
ragas which are they call ‘prasida’,&nbsp;

02:04:57.270 --> 02:05:01.980
means are known to people and there&nbsp;
are so many which are unknown also.

02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:08.280
Then these all bandishes, as he is singing,
every one of them they were so such geniuses,&nbsp;

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:13.440
that they created these beautiful ragas.

02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:17.160
And the ragas also because&nbsp;
they also created the ragas,&nbsp;

02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:20.280
not only that, they created&nbsp;
the themes and the bandish,&nbsp;

02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:26.880
but also, they made it so much&nbsp;
sort of, one with the timing,&nbsp;

02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:28.620
one with the idea.

02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:30.960
Now for example, this Yaman raga,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:36.480
which is to be learned first,
is the Shri Ganesha of music.

02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:43.080
So, first thing is to respect your Guru.
And this is how they have made all the bandishes.

02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:48.240
Very deep people, they are not cheap.
They were not for any sort of show&nbsp;

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:53.340
or they were not for any sort&nbsp;
of a money or power or anything.

02:05:53.340 --> 02:05:54.420
Very, very&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:55.200 --> 02:06:00.171
highly qualified. Very, very highly qualified.
I met few of them Alaudin kasab also, I met.

02:06:00.171 --> 02:06:02.340
You see, and they’re very different people.

02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:04.620
And they had no interest in money or anything&nbsp;

02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:09.360
but they were sort of, you see, God&nbsp;
has created them to create music.

02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:14.880
Special people, absolutely,&nbsp;
and very loving, very kind,&nbsp;

02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:20.400
and extremely also very hot&nbsp;
tempered with their disciples.

02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:22.620
And was very strict with them.

02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:27.600
But the disciples had to agree and&nbsp;
had to accept what they are saying,&nbsp;

02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:31.320
because they were like we&nbsp;
are: you are seeking truth,&nbsp;

02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:34.020
they were seeking the mastery in music.

02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:38.760
So, all the people had to&nbsp;
be very obedient, careful.

02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:44.400
And I was myself surprised that in the Yaman Raga,
they have talked of the guru.

02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:49.560
Because is the first raga,&nbsp;
to be sung first of all,&nbsp;

02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:52.920
before learning any other raga.
First, you learn Yaman.

02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:55.560
And it is a raga of today,&nbsp;

02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:58.980
because today we are celebrating&nbsp;
Shri Ganesha’s birthday.

02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:00.900
So, it’s all very timely&nbsp;

02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:06.780
because you have done justice&nbsp;
to Marva and to Yaman raga.

02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:10.860
We are all thankful to you
and always try to understand that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:16.080
is some sort of a drama that takes place
and that explains many things, you see.

02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:19.320
All these coincidences are&nbsp;
done by this Divine Power.

02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:22.980
So, it’s perfectly all right.
We all enjoyed your music very much.

02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:28.140
We are all very thankful to you,
to give this tremendous joy&nbsp;

02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:32.160
and I really felt Shri Ganesha&nbsp;
is dancing in your hearts.

02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:35.040
That’s how it is worked&nbsp;
out because he’s innocence.&nbsp;

02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:40.920
And he is the creator of the&nbsp;
whole rhythm of the world.

02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:46.800
So, also today, they enjoyed your&nbsp;
music very much more, I should say,&nbsp;

02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:54.120
and you also played very much in a more speed,
because of accompaniment of Sukhvinder Singh.

02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:58.380
You see you, must always have&nbsp;
‘jod tour’ (alap), you see, yes.

02:07:58.380 --> 02:08:02.880
You must have equally well&nbsp;
played tabla, otherwise,&nbsp;

02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:07.140
the enjoyment is not so much,&nbsp;
you get sometimes bored.

02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:11.820
But [Hindi] every moment was enjoyable.

02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:14.460
So, it was my idea that you should bring him.

02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:16.020
So, [Hindi conversation]

02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:16.729
And we don’t understand,&nbsp;
they are organized for us.&nbsp;

02:08:16.729 --> 02:08:16.860
Everything is&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:46.951
for us&nbsp;

02:08:46.950 --> 02:09:13.739
and once we start realising&nbsp;
why these coincidences,&nbsp;

02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:18.360
then you’ll be amazed that&nbsp;
it’s all done very meticulously&nbsp;

02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:23.940
very effectively and efficiently&nbsp;
by this All-pervading Divine Power.

02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:26.760
So, may God bless you.
May God bless you.

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:27.600
Thank you very much.
