1
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,720
Just sit down.

2
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,920
Ask them to sit down on the ground. Please.

3
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,402
You, two ladies, sit down because they cannot see from the back.

4
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,520
Today you all have gathered here

5
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,760
to worship Me as your Guru.

6
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,360
I must say that I lack many qualities

7
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,800
that a guru should have,

8
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,720
in the sense I cannot be strict with you,

9
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,720
I cannot be stern with you,

10
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,360
and I really don’t know how to punish you for doing wrong things.

11
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,520
This may be because, normally I think

12
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,760
the gurus have problems with their disciples,

13
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,280
who are mostly not realized souls.

14
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
As they are not realized souls,

15
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,600
the gurus find it difficult to communicate

16
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,320
or talk to them

17
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,440
about the subtle problems that they have.

18
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,840
I know of many gurus

19
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,160
even in modern times

20
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,640
who’ve been really very, very strict.

21
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,520
And also they told Me

22
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,360
that they have achieved their realization

23
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,120
by working very hard

24
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,200
and by suffering under the strictness of the gurus.

25
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,840
Sometimes I was really filled with great compassion for such disciples

26
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,240
who haven't yet received their realization.

27
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,280
They had gurus who were really realized souls

28
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,720
and they never had their realization,

29
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,360
and the guru was extremely strict with them.

30
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:41,720
There was one gentleman I met in Kolhapur,

31
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,560
and he got realization in one minute.

32
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,520
So he told Me that his guru had "told me

33
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,960
to go for fast every month at least for eight days."

34
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,440
All right. "Then he asked me

35
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,800
to build a temple of Dattatreya in his village."

36
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,400
And every day he must go and worship Dattatreya

37
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,160
in the morning time and in the evening time.

38
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,560
He spent so much money,

39
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,960
and still he didn't get realization.

40
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,160
"And while You hardly took two minutes to give me realization, Mother.

41
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,600
What is this?

42
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,400
How You have been so gracious to me?"

43
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,840
So, I didn't know what to answer him

44
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,000
I didn't want to talk against his guru

45
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,720
because I know he is a realized soul.

46
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,840
Actually, most of these gurus

47
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,760
and incarnations

48
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,760
were very helpless with human beings.

49
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:19,200
Perhaps they didn't have such beautiful disciples as I have.

50
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,680
Perhaps at this time all the good people

51
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,800
who were seeking Divinity are born,

52
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:39,400
and they are here as Sahaja yogis.

53
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,640
I never had to work very hard on them.

54
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,680
Of course once in a while you do get a person

55
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,640
who tries to trouble us, or who tries to create problems.

56
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,320
But modern times are so special, I think,

57
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:08,360
that it's very easy to give realization to people.

58
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,000
At the time of Moses, He had made laws

59
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,720
because of the decadent society of the Jews at that time.

60
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:32,240
And that one was very hard, very, very hard,

61
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,600
which we know today as shariat –

62
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,280
was taken over by the Muslims.

63
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,280
And even now the punishments according to so-called Koran

64
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,720
are so hard that you can't believe it.

65
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:58,480
And most of the pressure of all their dharmic laws are on the women.

66
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,040
Whatever it is, even in the Bible if you read Christ,

67
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,400
He has said that

68
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,440
all those Ten Commandments are nothing,

69
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,440
you have to go beyond them.

70
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,120
And He says if your one eye is mischievous,

71
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,400
is committing sin, take it out.

72
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,280
What's the use of the whole body getting contaminated by that?

73
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,760
Or if your one arm is doing something that is wrong,

74
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,960
you better remove it.

75
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,520
Because of one arm, the whole body will suffer.

76
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,960
He said that, it is said that you should not be adulterous.

77
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,240
But I would say that you should not have eyes

78
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,320
in which for any woman you have desire-

79
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,040
you have committed the great sin;

80
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,200
and you'll all go to hell, all those people who will do it.

81
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,960
So you should not have adulterous eyes.

82
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,400
Another thing He has said,

83
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,880
that if somebody slaps you on one face,

84
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:37,040
you should turn another cheek towards that person.

85
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,640
When I knew about these laws I said,

86
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,920
How can you have such people in this world?

87
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,800
It's a very subtle thing.

88
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,840
And the last of all which was very, very good was

89
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,440
that you should be righteous,

90
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,120
righteous more than all the scribes and all the Pharisees

91
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,200
– means the priest and all this with the –

92
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,640
you have to be much more righteous than them.

93
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,320
I mean, in early age when I read it I thought,

94
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,440
where can you find such people

95
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:24,040
who can be called anywhere near Christ's description?

96
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,320
It was inconceivable at that time.

97
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,760
India is one place as I told you, people are dharmic by their own,

98
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,920
we can say,

99
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,840
their own genes you can call them,

100
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,360
or you can say they are extremely dharmic because of traditions -

101
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,680
brought up like that.

102
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,120
In My time, in the South India and Maharashtra,

103
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,280
I think we were very dharmic family,

104
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,040
and it was very dharmic atmosphere.

105
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,840
Still,

106
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,440
these things that Christ has described was not there.

107
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,200
For example, anger was regarded as a great asset.

108
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,720
People used to boast, “I am very angry with that person!”

109
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,120
they used to say.

110
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,240
Very common.

111
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,040
Of course I don't think in India anybody can say

112
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,920
“I hate you” because is regarded something sinful and stupid,

113
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,880
because to hate somebody is being adharmic.

114
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,400
But of course they did say so many things

115
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,960
that were not at all permissible by the laws of Christ.

116
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,760
And then came Mohammed Sahib,

117
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,560
who just found that nothing works out.

118
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,520
So I think they adopted shariat - but not Mohammed Sahib -

119
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,320
but they had adopted already the shariat.

120
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,280
He accepted.

121
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,520
He said, “All right, this shariat can be worked out."

122
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,720
But it is so inhuman and has no balance,

123
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:33,160
because only the women have to suffer; no, nothing to men.

124
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,640
If a woman did adultery then she was punished, but not the man.

125
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,840
Even, I don't know what is the law here,

126
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,880
but in India if a woman who is married does adultery,

127
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,800
such a man has to be punished,

128
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,920
but if the married man does adultery there is no punishment.

129
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:05,360
All these things, I know, cannot be forced on anyone.

130
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,760
Whatever Christ must have said,

131
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,800
He must have said in His own meditative mood.

132
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,840
He was surrounded by people

133
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,320
who tried to kill Him, and they killed Him ultimately.

134
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,200
And the kind of people they were,

135
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,760
specially at that time the Romans

136
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,160
– extremely cruel.

137
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,920
So how can He say that if you,

138
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,960
somebody slaps you on one cheek, you turn another cheek to that person?

139
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Very angry, hot-tempered people were there.

140
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,720
Krishna, of course, said it very clearly

141
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,640
that “krodhat bhijayati sammoha” – is krodh is the worst thing,

142
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,960
anger is the worst sin according to Him,

143
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,280
from - only from anger everything comes out.

144
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,120
But He didn't say how the anger comes in.

145
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,800
He didn't talk about it that the source of anger was your liver,

146
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,400
and also your upbringing.

147
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,640
These two things give you horrible anger.

148
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,760
Unless and until you witness yourself,

149
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,400
your realization has no meaning.

150
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,240
You should separate yourself from yourself,

151
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,440
and see for yourself what is really wrong with you.

152
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,920
Now supposing somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

153
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,960
instead of taking pride in it

154
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,440
or using that temper to control others,

155
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,040
he should try to control himself.

156
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,040
How?

157
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,160
First is the krodha.

158
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,160
Anybody who wants to be a saint should know

159
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,360
that anger, this krodha, should have no place.

160
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,320
And how do you do it?

161
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,080
You first of all witness yourself how you behave.

162
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,560
For example,

163
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,400
I would say artificially you become angry, artificially,

164
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,800
and stand before the mirror.

165
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
See your face, how you look like.

166
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,960
You'll be surprised,

167
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,240
looks like a face of a monkey or a tiger,

168
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,720
or I don't know what animal you must have been in last life.

169
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,160
And then you are amazed

170
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,480
that you are still carrying the traces of that previous life

171
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,120
that was whatever was the animal.

172
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,840
Then the second thing would be, take out the anger upon yourself.

173
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:15,440
As we have in Sahaja Yoga, we write down our own names and beat it.

174
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,680
But it is, should be that if you get angry with yourself,

175
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,960
then you will see

176
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,160
that you have won over your anger.

177
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,880
Because angry people only torture others,

178
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,040
they don't torture themselves. Of course sometimes they feel bad,

179
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
later on they feel “I should not have done this,”

180
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,600
they develop a left Vishuddhi.

181
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,760
But, mainly if you start getting angry with yourself –

182
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,880
“Why should I have done this? Why did I do this?"

183
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,480
"Why should I get tempted to this?” –

184
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,680
you'll be surprised, your temper will go down.

185
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,680
And also physically you should see you have a liver problem.

186
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,040
With that you just face yourself

187
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,000
and tell that “I’m going to get rid of this liver problem.

188
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,960
How dare it become my enemy

189
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,320
and stop my ascent in spirituality.”

190
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,960
So the first, the witness state has to be developed.

191
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,840
For a Sahaja yogi is very important to develop a witness state.

192
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,440
But normally what happens

193
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,400
that Sahaja yogis develop a witness state for others.

194
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,400
Now you know in Sahaja Yoga the door is open to everyone;

195
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,200
and some mad people also walk in,

196
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,480
some funny people also walk in,

197
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,320
some very bad-charactered people also walk in,

198
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,200
all kinds of things happen.

199
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,680
So now you should see,

200
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,960
what are you worried about?

201
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,800
Are you worried about people who have problems,

202
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,080
who are no good, for whom you cannot say that they'll be Sahaja yogis;

203
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:39,080
or you are enjoying the people who have got Sahaja Yoga?

204
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,760
This temper sometimes has made people really mad, I tell you,

205
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,080
can go into your head and can make you mad;

206
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,200
and we have some mad people in Sahaja Yoga, we have still.

207
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,040
But they have become so mad that now they are no more angry,

208
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,200
they are no more troublesome, they are just mad, that's all.

209
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,520
For such people you shouldn't worry.

210
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:17,400
There's no need to witness others – witness yourself.

211
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
And I sometimes feel

212
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,760
that anger comes through too much austerity,

213
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,440
too much of extreme nature also.

214
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,680
Some Sahaja yogis are extremely austere,

215
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,520
austere about everything. It's maddening.

216
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,560
In Sahaja Yoga there is, everything is Sahaj, it’s spontaneous.

217
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,960
You are not to be austere. You should not be particular.

218
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,920
Now, I said now it's not better,

219
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,000
not to wear a black sari or something, if I say so –

220
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,680
then it doesn't become a sentence from Brahma!

221
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,160
Supposing then somebody is wearing a black sari and coming,

222
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,040
you will all run away from that person –

223
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,440
or black clothes. It's not that.

224
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,760
You are gurus yourself;

225
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,680
why should you be afraid of any kind of person who comes to you,

226
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,880
whether it is black, white, or any type?

227
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:37,120
Why should you have any fear?  The another side of temper is fear.

228
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,440
A man who is hot-tempered always have fear

229
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,520
because he sees himself in others.

230
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,360
He sees that "another person also must be having the same kind of temper,

231
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,720
and he'll attack me," so he's always on the protective.

232
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,640
In a Sahaj manner

233
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:11,160
what we do is to live without fear.

234
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,200
It's said that wages of sin is fear,

235
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,760
but I would say wages of anger.

236
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,400
Those people who were very aggressive, say for example,

237
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,320
develop frights, all kinds of frights.

238
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,080
Those countries who have invaded other countries

239
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,240
and rule other countries,

240
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:44,160
and have got the experience of their ego, of their anger,

241
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,520
become extremely frightened people.

242
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,600
Specially the soldiers

243
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,600
who go on the war, kill so many people and come back,

244
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,440
and they are frightened.

245
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,760
I asked one of them in America, I said, “What are you frightened of?”

246
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,160
He said, “I feel that I have killed so many people,

247
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,160
now so many will kill me.”

248
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,280
But I said, “Why do you think like that?"

249
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,280
"Why should anybody kill you?”

250
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,600
He says, “Because, why did I kill others?"

251
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,080
"Why did I kill others? Because I killed others,

252
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,960
so anybody can kill me, isn’t it, without rhyme and reason.”

253
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,120
Logically I agreed. But his fear was so much

254
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,520
that when he came in My presence he was just shaking,

255
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,440
the whole body was shaking with fear.

256
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,440
So, whatever aggression we do boomerangs on us,

257
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,680
and we become very frightened about everything.

258
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,400
In Sahaj you witness yourself as a separate identity.

259
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,840
All your past is finished, gone, you are not bothered,

260
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,480
and you remain in a state which is fearless.

261
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,320
This state has to be achieved through Sahaja Yoga.

262
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,480
Very easy, once you know that you are protected you'll have no fear,

263
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:22,120
and as you'll have no fear you will not have also temper.

264
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,000
It works vice versa sometimes.

265
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,040
It's a very common thing I have seen,

266
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,920
a very aggressive person will be described by a psychologist

267
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,400
as a man of insecurity.

268
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,160
It's nice to say that, but it's not true.

269
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,160
He makes everybody insecured, then how can he be insecure?

270
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,080
If another person feels insecure with that person,

271
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,680
that means this man is not insecured,

272
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,280
but he is over-secured.

273
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,200
If you tell him that, then only he will improve.

274
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
But if you say, “You have insecurity,”

275
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,440
then he thinks, “Yes, my condition is pitiable."

276
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,440
"Even if I kill somebody is all right,

277
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,960
because my condition is pitiable.”

278
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,520
Such arguments work out

279
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,760
in such a manner, that you become convinced about yourself.

280
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,640
But if you see as a witness

281
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,240
you see, “What have I done so far?"

282
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,320
"Have I been able to conquer myself?”

283
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,680
Sahaja Yoga is not to conquer others or to control others,

284
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,440
but to conquer yourself.

285
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,160
If you have not done that, you can be self-certified -

286
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,720
“Oh, I have been a Sahaja yogi, I have been so great,

287
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,240
I have been this, I am -”  that makes no difference.

288
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,920
Have you completely transformed yourself, changed yourself,

289
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,560
and now in your presence do people feel secured?

290
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,360
If they feel insecure, then something wrong with you.

291
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Or if you feel insecure, also there’s something wrong with you.

292
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,280
Now this excuse to give, that “Mother, I am insecure” –

293
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,960
then you are not a Sahaja yogi, as simple as that.

294
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,640
Giving explanation like that shows you are not even a Sahaja yogi.

295
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,960
So now to become the guru, first of all,

296
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,520
you should have a great sense of forgiveness.

297
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,560
So much so like Buddha's.

298
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,200
Once Buddha was giving a lecture in a village

299
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,160
and suddenly somebody came in and started abusing Him,

300
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,840
saying all kinds of things and all that.

301
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,800
Then somebody told him, “What are you doing?

302
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,440
He is Buddha, the one who's Enlightened One.  He’s trying to help us

303
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,800
to become good, and you came and shouted at Him?”

304
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,920
So he was repentant.

305
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,200
He went to see Buddha, but Buddha had gone to another village.

306
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,440
So he went to another village, second day,

307
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,600
and he went and fell at the feet of Lord Buddha.

308
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,920
Lord Buddha said, “What's the matter?" "Why are you falling at My feet?”

309
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,520
He said, “Sir, I must say

310
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,360
that I was, really I didn't know You were the Enlightened One.

311
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,040
I just shouted at You, said things, I don't know what happened to me.

312
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,280
So please forgive me.”

313
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,760
He said, “When did you say this to Me?”

314
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,600
“Yesterday.” “Where?”  “In such place.”

315
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,680
He said, “Yesterday is finished now."  "What is there to forgive?”

316
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,600
Now, he came begging of His forgiveness, repenting.

317
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,920
Immediately He said, “Yesterday is over.”

318
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,760
That is one of the greatest qualities Sahaja yogis should have.

319
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,080
To call yourself a guru you must also have maturity.

320
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,840
And the maturity part is sometimes very -

321
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:48,240
Like yesterday in the drama. I was surprised when the -

322
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,040
it took some time, some people came in, went.

323
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,200
They were giggling just like children. It shows no maturity, no respect.

324
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Hah, anything laughable is there of course one can laugh,

325
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,040
or any enjoyment is there - but shows such childishness.

326
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,160
They are doing some drama, making fun of them.

327
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,880
Very common with Sahaja yogis I have seen, specially ladies.

328
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,560
They laugh at things where they should never laugh.

329
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,840
I am sitting there

330
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,880
and you are watching something,

331
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,160
what is there to laugh?

332
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,120
Shows complete immaturity!

333
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,440
Another thing I have seen is in small, small things,

334
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,480
specially in money matters, it’s very funny. I have to tell you this:

335
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,720
Turkish people, our Sahaja yogis have no money,

336
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,240
everything was stolen away from them.

337
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,360
So I said, “All right, you send some shirts here

338
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,480
and we'll sell those shirts,

339
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,680
and extra money you can take it,” because they would not take money from Me.

340
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,280
So when they sent the shirt here, it was - they said that “Mother,

341
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,520
I don't know marketing,"

342
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,840
they said, “Mother, it should be twenty-one dollars, twenty-two dollars.”

343
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,280
Many of them said it is expensive.

344
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,840
Then I said, “All right, collect money from everyone,

345
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,720
twenty-two dollars each without giving any shirt,

346
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,920
finished – for Turkey.”

347
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,120
But a false guru takes money from you, you don't mind.

348
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,520
Sahaja Yoga is free of course,

349
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,560
no doubt. Sahaja Yoga is free.

350
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,640
But you have to contribute.

351
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,520
How are we to run this Sahaja Yoga?

352
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,360
There's no sense of donation in you, at all.

353
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,080
For a guru, one must know how to donate.

354
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,280
I am surprised sometimes, there is no sense of donation.

355
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,560
We got something, say, terracotta from India, to help those people;

356
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,080
and I was surprised that these Belgian women are so funny

357
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,880
that they were telling everybody it is expensive.

358
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,400
If they don't want to buy, they need not buy.

359
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,160
Others were willing to buy but they, these women were telling

360
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,200
that these things are expensive.

361
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:35,160
Where do you contribute for Sahaja Yoga?

362
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,760
Now we had to have this pendal.

363
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,200
We had to have all kinds of things. What do you contribute?

364
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,560
This attachment to money can never be good for a guru.

365
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,720
I have no attachment at all. If you ask anyone they'll tell you,

366
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,960
even My husband will tell that,

367
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,360
that from inside I am absolutely detached.

368
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,440
I don't know also, I don't know banking,

369
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,920
I don't know how to keep accounts,

370
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,440
somebody keep accounts, somebody does that.

371
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,640
But this attachment to money in Sahaja Yoga –

372
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,440
I won't say like Christ that you'll all go to hell,

373
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,680
but you won't rise much higher.

374
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,640
You have come for your spiritual ascent.

375
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,520
I don't say you go to Himalayas, stand in the cold,

376
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,760
stand on your heads, nothing of the kind.

377
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:39,360
But the another defect they call in Me is

378
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,840
that I never tell them that “you must contribute.”

379
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,960
It is to be done with pleasure, with happiness,

380
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,400
that you can contribute something to Sahaja Yoga.

381
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,720
In any case, whether you give it or not,

382
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,800
I'll have to contribute for Turkey, no doubt.

383
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'll do that.

384
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,760
Now this kind of a thing as a market is there –

385
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,720
“It's very expensive. This is cheap, this, that” –

386
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,200
this is just an excuse because I know you can never contribute

387
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,600
even twenty dollars for anything.

388
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,560
So I bring their clothes, all right.

389
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:33,080
They have stitched the shirts, sent it here, and now –

390
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,920
I'm surprised.

391
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,640
But if the free presents are given, it's very much acceptable,

392
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,960
and nobody sees how expensive it is.

393
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,560
So now I would say that on money matters

394
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,560
a guru has to be absolutely detached and giving, and generous.

395
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,080
You'll enjoy your generosity but the problem is,

396
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,000
you are not generous at all.

397
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,880
You think Sahaja Yoga is another market-place where you have come.

398
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,960
So the generosity part is so much missing,

399
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,840
and it is very surprising.

400
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,920
They asked Me that “Mother, please,

401
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,680
we need some chiffon skirts and blouses for this summer.”

402
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,680
You stitch them for them, bring all the way;

403
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,560
nobody wants to buy, it's all lying there.

404
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,600
There's no shopping here. So I'm going to tell you that

405
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,600
as long as all these things are exhausted,

406
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,600
I am not going to ask any country to send anything here for sale.

407
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,240
To believe that you are Sahaja yogis, you are sadly mistaken.

408
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,080
Your attention so much - you'll go to hairdressers,

409
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,920
you'll do all kinds of things, but for Sahaja Yoga you have no money.

410
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,840
Today, as everybody has said,

411
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:19,320
“Mother, you should be little stern, You must tell,” I'm telling you this.

412
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,960
Your progress will be very slow.

413
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,080
Secondly, you have to introspect to find out,

414
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,280
what have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

415
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,720
How many people you have given realization? You have powers.

416
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,920
These gurus never had powers, though they were realized souls;

417
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,840
you have powers to give realization, how many of you have done it?

418
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,320
And once you start doing that,

419
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,160
you get about ten people, twenty people from somewhere,

420
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,560
you become great masters

421
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,600
and you start talking about your great mastery

422
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,520
and that you know everything,

423
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,200
that you are the guru, you are the Adi Shakti.

424
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,960
This is at the Agnya level.

425
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,480
As soon as you reach the Agnya level you get this into your heads.

426
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,160
So many, of course, have done so much for Sahaja Yoga,

427
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,240
otherwise it would not have been possible to see this today.

428
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,400
For all those who have not done anything,

429
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,960
I must tell you that you are just standing at the same steps.

430
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,560
Your kundalini has risen but you have done nothing,

431
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,520
nothing to give it to others.

432
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,160
Unless and until you give it, you cannot grow.

433
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,320
There are many I know who don't want to give

434
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,600
because they think “we'll catch.”

435
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:58,280
Don't want to look after others because they think they'll get egos.

436
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,640
This is not the way to be in Sahaja Yoga.

437
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:10,120
You have to do something which is very important, to spread Sahaja Yoga.

438
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,280
We are talking of global peace, of global transformation,

439
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,880
and what are we doing for it?

440
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:26,640
First improve your quality. And that improvement can only come

441
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,520
through sincere, honest introspection,

442
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:37,600
and also witnessing yourself every moment, how you behave.

443
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,960
I must tell you about Myself,

444
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,960
that from My very childhood I was like a grandmother.

445
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,240
I would not tolerate anything nonsense,

446
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,000
any stupid jokes, anything, like a grandmother.

447
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,960
And now I am a grandmother also.

448
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,440
And this maturity has to come in you.

449
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,720
To talk cheaply is all right,

450
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,600
some people have that habit – they are no Sahaja yogis.

451
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,800
But the ones who follow them and talk like that,

452
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,040
shows that they have no maturity.

453
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:30,600
If they were matured they would change all these people.

454
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,760
Whenever there are matured people, they definitely transform others.

455
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:44,080
And their own behaviour, people are surprised how they are.

456
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,560
This may be exceptional, may be very few like that.

457
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,840
But only thing why I am pointing it out to you,

458
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,400
that when you find somebody like that,

459
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,800
then please try not to listen to such a person,

460
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,680
not to follow such a person.

461
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,320
But such a person is extremely forward type

462
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,360
and everybody becomes sort of a follower

463
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:19,040
of such a useless Sahaja yogi, so-called.

464
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,240
So we have to mature. Now how do we mature?

465
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,760
Many ask Me this question.

466
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,480
We mature by meditation, by nirvicharita.

467
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,120
You have to be in thoughtless awareness to grow,

468
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,480
otherwise you cannot grow.

469
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,120
Now, you should practice this thoughtless awareness otherwise also.

470
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,760
Say you are walking on the road, suddenly you see a beautiful tree,

471
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,280
you should become thoughtless. Creation of Divine –

472
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,120
how beautiful it is! You should become thoughtless.

473
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,120
In thoughtless Sahaj works, otherwise it does not work.

474
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,840
You plan everything, you do everything, it won't work out.

475
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,640
If you leave it to Sahaj, it will work out.

476
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:15,080
But that never means that you should be lazy about it,

477
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,360
or also unsystematic – no.

478
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,720
You have to be alert, extremely alert, because if you are not alert

479
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,760
you will not see how the Sahaj is helping you.

480
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,680
I'll give an example.

481
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,720
Supposing you want to meet somebody.

482
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,720
Now that person has said, “I'll meet you at eleven o'clock,” say for example.

483
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,560
You have to be alert. He said he'll meet you at eleven.

484
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,960
By some chance you are late, supposing.

485
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,760
So you should be alert that you are late for the gentleman.

486
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:05,200
At that time, you should give a bandhan or raise your kundalini,

487
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,320
do something, so that you meet that person in any case,

488
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,240
whether you are late or not. But normally you should not be late.

489
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,480
If you just give a bandhan and say,

490
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,400
“I must be there at eleven o'clock,” you'll be there.

491
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,160
Sahaj will help you.

492
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,480
But you even forget to give bandhans,

493
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,480
you even forget to raise your kundalini,

494
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,080
you even forget to give vibrations.

495
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,160
So to mature, first of all you should know you are now Sahaja yogis,

496
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,880
and that you can control the whole situation

497
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:46,360
if you are one with this all-pervading Power.

498
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,000
It's very simple.

499
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,600
It was very hot, everybody was saying it's very hot. All right.

500
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:02,320
I got up, I said, “I'll make it,” within fifteen minutes I made it cool.

501
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,600
I say, “I made it” – “I,” but it's not “I.”

502
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,480
My connection with this all-pervading Power has done the job.

503
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,680
But the connection has to be sincere, strong, honest,

504
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,640
and all the time in your mind you should know

505
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,160
that you are connected.

506
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,400
This situation is very simple to achieve,

507
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:40,680
this state where you all the time feel “I am one with the Divine”.

508
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,120
Because you are not alert,

509
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:50,080
you don't want to see the miracles of this great Power

510
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,360
which you are in connection.

511
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,240
You are busy with other things, your attention is somewhere else,

512
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,320
you're looking at other things.

513
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,280
And then suddenly you say, “Mother, how is it I am such a Sahaja yogi,

514
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,040
I could not do this and that?”

515
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,120
What's going on there?

516
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,600
Even when I am speaking I see people are busy with something else.

517
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,720
So what you call,

518
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:41,720
is to mature through your meditation in nirvicharita –

519
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,440
in thoughtless awareness.

520
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:55,480
Unless and until you enlarge the state of thoughtless awareness

521
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,320
you cannot mature, because only in the present you can mature,

522
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,760
and present is thoughtless awareness.

523
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,560
And I have seen what is happening,

524
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:19,120
that people are only expecting

525
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,760
all kinds of miracles from Sahaja Yoga,

526
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,160
all kinds of help from Sahaja Yoga,

527
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:34,360
but they never think “what help are we doing?"

528
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,200
"What are we achieving?"

529
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,920
"Where are we?”

530
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,400
So at the Agnya again,

531
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,960
you people have to be extremely, extremely careful.

532
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,240
Now this is for men.

533
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,560
If you have not crossed your Agnya

534
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,160
and you start spreading Sahaja Yoga,

535
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:11,200
then you can become really a funny person,

536
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,680
not a Sahaja yogi.

537
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,720
This leadership business is a myth,

538
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,280
and this myth must be seen as a myth.

539
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,040
Whether you are leader or not leader makes no difference.

540
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,240
But the maturity has to come.

541
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,040
Now I am telling all this because

542
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,960
I have decided not to punish anybody in this lifetime.

543
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,520
So that you see for yourself,

544
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,440
yourself you understand,

545
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,280
yourself you realize. I know you very well, all of you, somehow.

546
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,280
But I want you to realize yourself,

547
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,240
“What are we doing wrong?" "Where are we doing right?”

548
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,480
and don't judge Sahaja Yoga on what merits you get out of it.

549
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,320
If you are not getting merits, there's something wrong with you.

550
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,960
If you can really understand this,

551
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,360
then you will become subtler and subtler

552
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:29,920
and all your gross attachments will become absolutely negligible.

553
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:36,040
You may have concern, but you won't have attachment.

554
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:43,440
From inside, this complete detachment has to come in.

555
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,720
And that can come, as I told you,

556
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,280
getting rid of your anger, first.

557
00:46:53,040 --> 00:47:00,720
Secondly, getting rid of attachments to material things,

558
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,760
by generosity.

559
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,440
It's nice to give something to somebody,

560
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,760
you enjoy your generosity, you really enjoy.

561
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,000
Generosity is to be enjoyed.

562
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,840
And once you start enjoying your generosity,

563
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,000
then you realize that

564
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,600
you, your love, your compassion,

565
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,320
it has now started flowing to others.

566
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,680
Little, little things are there.

567
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,760
I have seen you all love Me and you do want always to give Me

568
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,240
presents, presents, presents, presents, all right.

569
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,080
But this love must spread to everybody else.

570
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,720
You must know about others also,

571
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,440
what they need and what you have to do.

572
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,040
If somebody needs something, can you get it for that person?

573
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,800
Can you love that person?

574
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Can you give it to the children of other people,

575
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,640
something that you have?

576
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,720
If this generosity could be just, maybe, I don't know,

577
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,760
because I don't have to force Myself to be generous.

578
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,680
Everybody says, “Mother, You are too generous” –

579
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,600
in My family everybody thinks I am very generous and a gone case –

580
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,360
but I don't have to generate.

581
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,600
But perhaps you people through introspection

582
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,160
will definitely become generous,

583
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,880
and this generosity will start flowing.

584
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,840
I've known people who have lots of money, lots of things,

585
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:11,480
but not one single pai they'll give to Sahaja Yoga, not one single pai.

586
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,720
This sense of generosity comes

587
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:24,400
when you understand what is your purpose of life, why you are here.

588
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,720
Just to fulfil yourself with Sahaja Yoga,

589
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:35,760
or to be able to do something about it

590
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,400
without feeling that you have done something?

591
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,960
In this Christ has said very nicely –

592
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,480
I mean that He has said it, but where do you find this? –

593
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:52,760
that your left hand should not know what your right hand has given,

594
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,720
should never trumpet, “I, I, I, I, I.”

595
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,320
What Christ has said, to achieve that

596
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,520
you had to have realization, no doubt.

597
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,240
But I would say fifth chapter of Matthews you read.

598
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,440
Such things, so subtle He did that you'll be surprised that

599
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:23,680
how this religion in the name of Christ has gone on the other side of it.

600
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,440
Now people want to be gurus

601
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,640
because they think you have powers;

602
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,760
that you can overpower others,

603
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,880
you can say whatever you like to others,

604
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,480
you can torture anyone you feel like.

605
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,120
That has been before, I know.

606
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,440
Gurus have been very, very …

607
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,680
very, very cruel to their disciples also, I know that.

608
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,600
Once I went to Ambarnath,

609
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,320
and one gentleman came to see Me,

610
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,320
his name was Swami Jagannath, and he said that

611
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:17,760
“My guru has told me that Adi Shakti is going to come to Ambarnath,

612
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,200
and I will try to come at that time.”

613
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,080
I said, “Who is your guru?” So he told Me some name.

614
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,760
He was a realized soul, no doubt. So he came down.

615
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,480
He said, “Mother, should he come to You, or You will go to him?”

616
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,400
I said, “See, I am a Mother. I am not a guru.”

617
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,480
The gurus don't leave their places, can you imagine?

618
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,800
They call it takiya.

619
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,480
The guru should not leave his place,

620
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,480
should sit there and everybody must come to him.

621
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,800
I said, “I am the Mother, I will go and meet him.”

622
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,160
So I met him

623
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,400
and the fellow who had come, this Jagannath fellow -

624
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,440
I said, “What's the matter with you?

625
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,040
Why don't you open his Agnya? He's in so much pain.”

626
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,640
He said, “Who opened my Agnya? Why should I open his Agnya?”

627
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,120
I said, “You are the guru, you are the master.”

628
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,240
“So what? My guru never opened my Agnya.

629
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,480
I had to fight my ego all the time

630
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,640
and that's how I have got everything all right.”

631
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,040
So I said, “It's so easy to open the Agnya. Why can't you open?”

632
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,880
So I turned his Agnya and opened it, he was very happy.

633
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,560
He said, “You are a mother, You do what You like.

634
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,560
We are not going to do this.

635
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,600
If you don't make them work hard for their realization,

636
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,840
if you don't make them work hard for their development,

637
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,240
they will never be all right. These human beings are like this.”

638
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,560
I said, “Not for Me.”

639
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,080
He said, “All right, You are a mother, You forgive them,

640
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,840
You do what You like, You try to transform them, help them. But not me.”

641
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,640
I said, “All right.” But you know, he came at My feet and all that,

642
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,760
and he said that “You must praise.

643
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,920
She is Adi Shakti. You must praise Her now.”

644
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:15,360
He was there for a short time. Then we were coming home,

645
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,960
then this Baba Jagannath tells Me,

646
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,320
“Mother, thank God You have opened my Agnya.”

647
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,080
So I said, “What happened?”

648
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,880
“My guru when I came, he gave me two slaps on the face.

649
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,000
I was running his ashram, supposed to be the guru.

650
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:36,720
Two slaps, and put me upside down on the well.

651
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:43,480
And all the time my feet were tied up to the rope

652
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,200
which he used to lower down, again bring me up.

653
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,920
So he put me again and again into the water seven times,

654
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,560
then he pulled me out.” I said, “Baba, why did he do that?”

655
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,160
He said, “I must tell You that I have been smoking sometimes.”

656
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,440
For that.

657
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,320
But I said, “He never gave you realization?

658
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,200
You would be smoking in any case, that’s it.”

659
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,920
“He wants me to give up all these bad habits with my Agnya on.

660
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,280
Now You have opened my Agnya, I'm all right.”

661
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:23,840
So I felt that the behaviour of that guru was very surprising.

662
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,520
He says, “He beats us.

663
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,760
He always beats us for anything and we have to work very hard.”

664
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,360
I also know of the, some gurus of the music also do that,

665
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:42,560
and I met so many of such people who have been to very great gurus

666
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,720
and the way I got the report was so shocking to Me,

667
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,440
that why don't they tell them directly that

668
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,880
“See, this is wrong with you, and this is how you should be”?

669
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,400
But the gurus say that if you tell them like that,

670
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,800
they'll never listen.

671
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,040
“They only know the beating.”

672
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,760
I said, “Ba! What do you say?

673
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,600
They only know beatings?” “Yes.”

674
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,160
So the whole attitude towards the disciple

675
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,920
is not of compassion, in fact.

676
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,080
There are of course other gurus also

677
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:26,760
who take a terrible test of their disciples.

678
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,600
Like as you see, Shri Ramdas.

679
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,120
This was nothing compared to what Raja Janaka did.

680
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,200
They will test the person and then only give realization,

681
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,320
and out of thousands, to one only.

682
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,720
That is how we've got so many false gurus also,

683
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:54,720
because they were all discarded by these realized souls, so.

684
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,120
At this point

685
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,800
we have people who have got realization,

686
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,920
when the real gurus are like this.

687
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,760
I met another one, he asked Me,

688
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,760
“Why are You giving realization to all these useless people?”

689
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,440
I said, “Why?” And there were some Sahaja yogis,

690
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,680
he said, “How many can give life for Shri Mataji?”

691
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,120
I said, “Why do you want to ask for their life?  I don't want their life.”

692
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,000
He said, “This is the first question," he said,

693
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,760
"those - I have many who will give life for me.”

694
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,480
And he has not given them realization.

695
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:47,840
So now at this juncture, when we have people who are seeking,

696
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,440
who are going to these gurus –

697
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,760
of course false gurus you forget, but even real gurus –

698
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,680
they do not get their realization.

699
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:01,200
Now, you are capable of giving them realization – just imagine.

700
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,640
They have big, big ashrams and things like that,

701
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,120
they cannot give realization.

702
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,200
While you can, all of you can give.

703
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,320
Now, it's like this,

704
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:24,840
that if you put little light in a lamp

705
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:35,680
and it is just giving light to itself, nothing else, supposing.

706
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,560
Now you have to give light to others.

707
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,520
You have powers, you can do it.

708
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:52,600
You can really change people, you can cure them –

709
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,200
but, you will not.

710
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:02,960
You will bring all these sick people to Me, “Mother, You cure.”

711
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:09,600
Even for realization I've seen they bring people to Me.

712
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,520
What is the need?

713
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:16,960
You all know how to give realization, how to cure a person.

714
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,680
All of you know.

715
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:26,440
Now why is it that you people cannot do it?

716
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,920
Firstly, you may not be matured enough.

717
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,280
But even if you are mature,

718
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,240
you are not assuming your own powers,

719
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,560
you don't believe in it.

720
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:47,560
Humility is all right, but you must know what power it is.

721
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,720
Supposing somebody is a king, say,

722
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,760
and you put him on the throne.

723
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,640
Now if people are coming and instead of they touching his feet,

724
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,560
he goes and touches each and everybody's feet –

725
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,520
this is no humility. This is nonsense.

726
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,080
Whatever position you have,

727
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:18,040
you should try to do with humility, means through compassion.

728
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,680
The maturity is this, that you should know that you have these powers,

729
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,600
you should know how to preserve these powers,

730
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,680
you should know how to grow in peace,

731
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:41,400
and then when you meet people you should assume, inside.

732
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:50,360
I may be a housewife cooking for My grandchildren,

733
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,600
doing this, doing that.

734
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,400
But once I am sitting on the chair, I know what I am.

735
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,960
You may be anything - you may be a clerk, you may be dishwasher,

736
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,280
you may be anything, that makes no difference.

737
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:15,360
But once you are a Sahaja yogi, you are a Sahaja yogi.

738
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,160
Then you must show your dignity

739
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:24,640
and not thrive on your weaknesses.

740
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,120
You are much better than all these realized souls

741
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,880
who have achieved their realization in thousands of years,

742
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,160
because you have so many powers.

743
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:42,040
But their self-confidence

744
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,280
and assumption is not with you.

745
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,600
Some people say, “We are afraid of ego.” How can you have ego?

746
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,840
It's finished.

747
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,120
Even if you do some mistakes, doesn't matter.

748
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,760
“Mother, I touched my left foot, I touched my right” –

749
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,560
makes no difference.

750
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:20,160
Because of no self-confidence you become austere in Sahaja Yoga.

751
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,080
If you are self-confident,

752
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,240
then why should you be austere?

753
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,400
It all goes together.

754
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,880
First you must mature, with that you must have self-confidence,

755
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:46,520
and without fear you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

756
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:52,720
Some have fear about themselves and some have fear about others.

757
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,800
Also it comes from your conditionings, from your upbringing.

758
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,800
So today's Guru Puja is in a way very important,

759
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,840
because everybody said, “Mother, You should be stern,

760
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,800
You must tell them and You must - ”

761
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,360
I said, “All right, I'll tell them.”

762
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,160
But in no way to put you down, no way;

763
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,760
but to tell you what you can achieve.

764
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,560
To tell you how far you can go.

765
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,240
You, so many are more than sufficient

766
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,560
to transform at least ten globes,

767
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,880
ten worlds, more than sufficient.

768
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:36,320
But you are still involved in yourself, worried about yourself,

769
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,600
only your children, your husband, this, that –

770
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,000
doesn't work out.

771
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,800
As much as you want to grow,

772
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,080
this power can give you that power.

773
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,960
But problem that lies with us is that

774
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,080
we don't know ourselves,

775
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:08,040
and we don't want to know ourselves.

776
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:17,240
Today's Guru Puja should give you the state of guru.

777
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:27,840
If you want, it can work out.

778
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:38,080
The all-pervading divine Power of Love is absolutely working it out.

779
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:44,800
More than you, the Divine wants this world to change,

780
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,960
wants to transform the whole universe.

781
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,640
Now you are the instruments,

782
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,360
and if you try to cheat yourself,

783
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,720
who can stop it?

784
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,200
Just to enjoy music,

785
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:15,440
or to enjoy the company, or belonging to some club,

786
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,160
or to feel that it's a nice festival;

787
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,360
or at the most you seek

788
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:26,480
the security of your children and family and all that -

789
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,360
it is not satisfying.

790
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,640
It will never satisfy you.

791
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:40,480
It will only satisfy you when you will become the lights

792
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,600
to give it to others, to work for others.

793
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,320
And you have these powers, what I'm trying to tell again and again,

794
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,640
you have these powers by which you can introspect yourself,

795
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,720
you can witness yourself, and you can surrender.

796
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:05,720
Because mentally now you are convinced about Sahaja Yoga.

797
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,760
Emotionally you are convinced

798
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:17,960
that Sahaja Yoga has given you such sense of love and compassion.

799
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:26,120
Physically you are convinced that Sahaja Yoga has given you good health

800
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,360
and confidence about your health.

801
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,520
Now spiritually you should be convinced, spiritually,

802
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:42,360
that you are really spiritual people selected by the Divine;

803
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,240
that your last lives have been of great seeking,

804
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,440
that's why you are born now, and you are getting all these blessings.

805
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:57,440
So assume. assumption of your personality is important.

806
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:04,240
You must meditate, you should go into thoughtless awareness,

807
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:11,160
and all the time keep your attention alert.

808
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
That is very important.

809
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:19,480
When, what is the need, when something will come,

810
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:25,400
how we have to react –

811
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,640
all these things come to you when you are alert

812
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:36,920
and aware of this all-pervading Power all the time, every moment.

813
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,880
I don't worry at all, never . Everybody is surprised at Me.

814
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,080
I don't worry.

815
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,440
Why? My worry is taken over.

816
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:53,000
People say, “You travel, travel.” I never travel.

817
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,280
I'm sitting here or I'm sitting there, what is it?

818
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,000
Where am I travelling?

819
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,480
So you don't think on those lines.

820
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:12,000
So thoughtless awareness is the first beautiful state

821
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,560
you have to achieve. That will give you peace

822
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,600
and a witness state to enjoy the drama of life,

823
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:25,680
to enjoy the different varieties of people,

824
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:31,960
while you will be growing within yourself.

825
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:40,760
For a Sahaja yogi is important not to see the faults of others

826
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,200
but your own faults, and correct them.

827
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,840
I get so many letters regarding some lady

828
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,680
or some leader or somebody like that.

829
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,200
That “Mother, this leader is troubling me,

830
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,520
that leader is troubling me, this, that.”

831
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,760
I'm surprised.

832
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,320
I will change the leader as soon as I’ll find something wrong,

833
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,240
I've always done –

834
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,160
who is not suitable, who is in problem, is always done.

835
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,080
But the way you put your attention to the leader is

836
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:18,080
perhaps the jealousy part.

837
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:21,520
If the leader says something wrong with you, you should thank him.

838
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:25,320
Who is there to tell you?

839
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,320
I'm very proud of you, I'm very happy,

840
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,840
that never such disciples existed for any guru.

841
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:42,160
If I'm a guru, I should say, I should say now done, finished, - overjoyed.

842
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:46,360
But when I see that you people don't realize what you have achieved,

843
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,920
and you don't want to work it out,

844
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,360
then I think of the parable of Christ

845
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,480
that some seeds fell on the rock.

846
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:03,120
All your affection, all your love,

847
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:09,240
I know it is impossible to express what I feel about it.

848
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,960
But you don't know why you got realization,

849
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,000
why you are here, what is your speciality, what you have to get.

850
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,040
You don't know that.

851
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,440
And that is what you have to know.

852
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,800
I don't say like Christ that take out one eye

853
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:31,640
or take out one, cut out your hand – nothing of the kind.

854
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:37,040
You’ll be intact, your body should be intact, nothing is to be taken out.

855
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,760
We need this body. But,

856
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,760
in a subtle way what He was saying,

857
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,920
that whatever part of your body is doing wrong,

858
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:52,200
you should try to negate it – in a subtle way.

859
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:55,600
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga also,

860
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,200
if there is jealousy try to find out why you are a jealous,

861
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,440
why are you against the leader?

862
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:05,760
The leader says a word to somebody, they immediately write to Me.

863
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,800
Why is he leader, if he has not to tell anything?

864
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,560
Today I think for the first time I have been able to tell something to you

865
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,440
which I was hesitating always,

866
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,760
that “Let it be, just now they are still little babies, it's all right.”

867
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,080
But now, after this you have to grow,

868
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,120
grow in every way.

869
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,960
I just can't understand.

870
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:42,480
Those who got realization without the power of raising the kundalini

871
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,080
are doing such a lot of work.

872
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,920
And while you all have this power to raise the kundalini,

873
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:54,360
to cure people, and also to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

874
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,920
you are so sensible.

875
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:02,440
Still where is your attention, I don't understand.

876
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:10,880
Today's lecture should not really in any way hurt you,

877
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:14,960
because I don't want to hurt you at all.

878
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,120
Whatever is the situation, I accept.

879
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,840
But if you don't want to accept that situation,

880
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:26,080
what you should do I have told you.

881
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:34,560
This will definitely suddenly raise your spiritual height – definitely.

882
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,320
No doubt about it.

883
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:44,480
It's very important to see for yourself what's wrong.

884
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,800
After all, you are all seekers of truth for ages,

885
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,040
and now you've come, you have found the truth.

886
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:59,640
So try to identify yourself with truth, that's all.

887
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,200
And with reality.

888
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,880
If you identify yourself with truth and with reality,

889
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,720
your Sahasrara is absolutely open. No problem.

890
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,680
Truth is in your Sahasrara.

891
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,280
And when the truth comes in, you are surprised

892
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,960
that truth is love and love is truth –

893
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,960
pure love.

894
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,480
It's very, very joy-giving,

895
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:33,560
and all the niranandas you want to have,

896
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,680
you can have, if you understand this simple equation

897
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,440
that absolute truth is absolute love.

898
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,880
I have no expectations.

899
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:53,680
I must tell you I am oversatisfied.

900
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,560
As far as I am concerned, I think I have done My job.

901
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:04,640
But now this has to be taken over, you have to be responsible.

902
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:08,960
You have to work it out. I was so happy, this time every place I went to,

903
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,560
all the leaders said that “Mother,

904
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,400
You need not travel, now we take the responsibility.

905
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,600
We'll work it out.”

906
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:23,480
But all of you must support your leaders and do something about it.

907
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:28,240
Sometimes leaders are really, they can't understand

908
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,680
why people are having their own ideas about everything.

909
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,480
You must go all out.

910
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:46,840
For example, in our country when we wanted to remove the slavery,

911
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:53,600
everyone joined together to achieve it.

912
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,840
While there are people who are trying to cut down the leaders,

913
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:03,640
put them down, make fun of them, form groups.

914
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:10,360
Is this the way we are going to work it out?

915
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,440
You all should support the leader.

916
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:20,680
You should all go all out to do what the leader is telling you.

917
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,440
If something is wrong with the leader I'll talk to him,

918
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:26,160
then I'll put him right, I promise you.

919
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:30,040
But you don't try to find faults.

920
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:35,040
As it is all the leaders ask Me before doing something.

921
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:39,560
So you just try to follow the leaders, whatever the leader is saying,

922
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,320
absolutely put all your effort.

923
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:49,040
Because the complaints are that you people don't listen to them –

924
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,440
I'm really surprised.

925
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,640
Yesterday you saw he was playing sitar.

926
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,680
You should have asked him, what about his guru?

927
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,400
His own father was his guru and he used to beat him,

928
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,280
and then his grandfather also.

929
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:16,000
But with such desire to learn something, to be something

930
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,520
that they didn't mind anything,

931
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,840
“Beat me, do what you like, put me in jail,

932
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,920
but make me a good artist.”

933
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:28,240
In the same way is Sahaja Yoga.

934
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:33,160
Because there is, if you may call it a defect,

935
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,920
Sahaja Yoga is not a military thing,

936
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:44,080
it's just plain, simple, Mother's love.

937
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:50,960
And of course every mother wants her child to be great,

938
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,920
to have all her powers – she wants that, no doubt.

939
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:02,306
How she does it, how she works it out

940
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,320
is her own problem.

941
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:11,720
But how you take it and how you use it is your own problem.

942
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,200
I always bow to you people who have got realization,

943
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:19,600
because I think so many saints were never there on this earth.

944
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,040
But the saintliness has to be complete.

945
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,880
Without that you cannot help even your family,

946
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:35,320
leave alone your country, and no question of the whole world.

947
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:42,040
So what is needed now is to raise your awakening,

948
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,880
to raise your spirituality,

949
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:51,880
to go into a realm of complete support and surrender

950
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:59,280
to the movement of this spontaneous movement of Sahaja Yoga.

951
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,280
May God bless you all.

952
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:16,480
In short, you must worship yourself – in short.

953
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,840
All right.

954
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:28,400
Hymns to Shri Guru Dakshinamurti by Shri Adi Shankaracharya

955
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:32,760
- please don't take pictures now and meditate -

956
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:38,440
Salutations to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

957
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:41,680
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

958
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:46,120
who gives the Self Realization and Enlightenment,

959
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:48,120
that is the Spirit,

960
02:28:48,320 --> 02:28:52,480
which is everywhere and the universe within,

961
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:56,720
like the reflection of a town would be in a mirror,

962
02:28:56,920 --> 02:28:59,040
but which appears outside

963
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:02,480
like a dream seen in a sleep.

964
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:07,360
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

965
02:29:07,560 --> 02:29:10,480
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

966
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:17,040
who like a mandarin or a maha yogi creates through her maya

967
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:20,960
at her own free will this universe

968
02:29:21,160 --> 02:29:26,240
which was within her like a tree is in the seed.

969
02:29:26,440 --> 02:29:31,080
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

970
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:33,680
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

971
02:29:33,880 --> 02:29:38,200
whose presence is felt as the pulsation everywhere

972
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:41,000
in this illusöry universe,

973
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:42,960
who gives enlightenment

974
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:47,640
of "Thou Are That" to those who surrender

975
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:52,040
and whose realization would obviate repeated birth

976
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:55,040
in the ocean of illusion.

977
02:29:55,560 --> 02:30:00,400
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

978
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:03,560
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

979
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:08,480
whose knowledge pulsates from our own being

980
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:13,280
like the light of a lamp being placed into a pitcher

981
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:19,680
having numerous holes and thereby reveals the true nature

982
02:30:19,880 --> 02:30:23,360
of all that is there in the universe.

983
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:28,320
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

984
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:31,480
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

985
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:36,240
who by Her Grace removes the ocean of illusion

986
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:38,800
that has come into existence

987
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:42,320
due to the imagination and play of Maya

988
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:49,080
and because of which people go into the state of "branthi"

989
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:52,160
and forget their spirit.

990
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:57,280
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

991
02:30:57,480 --> 02:31:00,520
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

992
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:07,320
by whose Grace one receives the realization of ones spirit

993
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:12,120
which is until then overcast by Maya

994
02:31:12,320 --> 02:31:17,320
like the moon is overshadowed by the planet rahu.

995
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:23,640
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

996
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:26,720
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

997
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:29,960
whose manifestations are the five elements,

998
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:33,160
the sun, the moon and the spirit

999
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:35,920
and whose presence is felt everywhere

1000
02:31:36,120 --> 02:31:39,360
in the universe by enlightened souls.

1001
02:31:39,560 --> 02:31:44,480
Salutation to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

1002
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:47,960
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

1003
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:52,560
the Guru and Lord of the three locas,

1004
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:57,000
who is alert to remove the ??grids of birth and death,

1005
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:59,360
who is seated on the ground at the basis

1006
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:03,520
of the banyan tree, that is the tree of life

1007
02:32:03,720 --> 02:32:08,880
and is enlightening all the saints and sages.

1008
02:32:09,080 --> 02:32:11,800
The guru is silent -

1009
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:19,360
is silent, but disciples of the guru become doubtless.

1010
02:32:19,960 --> 02:32:25,920
The guru looks young and the disciples old.

1011
02:32:26,120 --> 02:32:31,320
Salutation again and again to Sakshat Shri Guru Dakshinamurti,

1012
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:34,480
Sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

1013
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:41,240
who manifests herself before her devotees in ??bhandra mudra -

1014
02:32:41,440 --> 02:32:44,760
the posture conferring benevolence

1015
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:49,360
and enlightens them with realization of their spirit,

1016
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:51,760
pulsating through their being,

1017
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:57,360
in all the three states of childhood, young age and old age -

1018
02:32:57,560 --> 02:33:03,000
wakefulness, dreams and deep sleep.

1019
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:08,320
Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji,

1020
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:14,840
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

1021
02:41:33,960 --> 02:41:37,280
The international present for this Puja.

1022
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:29,400
Steven Taylor from Australia is asking Shri Mataji to bless posters

1023
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:34,920
that he will distribute for each countries here present.

1024
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:38,920
This picture has been taken at Easter Puja in Australia.

1025
02:46:49,240 --> 02:46:52,440
Now this is also the weekend in which

1026
02:46:52,640 --> 02:46:58,560
the greatest fragment of the comet was hitting Jupiter,

1027
02:46:58,760 --> 02:47:04,720
and Jupiter has absorbed this aggression in itself,

1028
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:07,920
symbolizing the wholesomeness of Dharma.

1029
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:11,840
So on behalf of Africa,

1030
02:47:12,040 --> 02:47:15,760
I'd like to ask our sister Al Ga'

1031
02:47:15,960 --> 02:47:19,760
to present to Shri Mataji a present

1032
02:47:19,960 --> 02:47:23,120
which symbolizes the wholesomeness of Jupiter

1033
02:47:23,320 --> 02:47:26,200
and the wholesomeness of Dharma.

1034
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:09,920
This is a collection of miracle pictures

1035
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:13,680
