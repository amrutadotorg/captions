1
00:00:06,147 --> 00:00:13,267
Can you love a person who is distressful?

2
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:20,387
One who is aggressive? One who is hot-tempered?

3
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:23,867
One who cheats you?

4
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:28,507
Can you love such a person? You cannot,

5
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:35,827
Then how can you love yourself when you have these qualities,

6
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:40,427
when you do this to yourself?

7
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:55,947
So the first thing is the pure love for yourself.

8
00:00:57,427 --> 00:01:04,250
Pure love. It's such a great thing to have pure love.

9
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:07,951
So now you have got Self Realisation.

10
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:11,871
Means you know what you are,

11
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:15,791
you know what beautiful thing you are.

12
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:22,671
When that is so, you should try to love your self.

13
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:26,871
And when you start loving yourself,

14
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:31,111
you are not bothered about all non-sensical things.

15
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:37,911
Now this pure love is one of the most beautiful things

16
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:42,071
you have which you can do to yourself.

17
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:50,871
When you are selfish, you are not loving your self.

18
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:57,791
When you are unkind, you are not loving your self.

19
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:02,431
When you are agressive, you are not loving your self.

20
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:09,991
Because you are loving all these bad things; but your Self is pure.

21
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,951
It's absolutely pure and beautiful.

22
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:20,151
And it loves all that is beautiful and good.

23
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:26,271
So this is the beginning of your 'Self' Realisation:

24
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:31,351
when you realise how important is your Self.

25
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:35,151
You don't have wrong ideas about yourself,

26
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:38,751
you don't justify all the wrong things you do,

27
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:46,951
because you understand that  is a blemish on your Self.

28
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:53,031
Face yourself in the most honest manner,

29
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:58,471
and you will be amazed to see how nice it is.

30
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:04,671
Just to see the pure Self shining within you.

31
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:11,791
When that Self starts shining, you start seeing many other things

32
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:19,111
which you have not seen, so far. And one of them you see

33
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:27,471
is that love is not only for yourself, but for everyone.

34
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:34,591
It's a pure love for everyone else.

35
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:40,511
It's not only for yourself. It's very surprising:

36
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:48,551
when you really love yourself then your love is for yourself,

37
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:56,831
and you start spreading that love

38
00:03:57,271 --> 00:04:03,551
in such a manner that you beautifully love others.

39
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:07,951
You don't love for money,

40
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:14,871
you don't love for some advantage, for some power

41
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:22,352
or for some gain, but you love for love.
