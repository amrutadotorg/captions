WEBVTT

07:26.534 --> 07:35.624
The purpose of these marriages is this, that
we should have international understanding

07:35.624 --> 07:47.214
about human beings that after coming to Sahaja
Yoga we transcend all the barriers, all the

07:47.214 --> 07:56.184
barriers of race, religion, ?? and nationality.

07:56.184 --> 08:10.204
We have to create this homogenous world and
make it peaceful by removing this disease

08:10.204 --> 08:16.424
of national identification or racial identification.

08:16.424 --> 08:21.134
We are all created by God Almighty.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.294
Our differences are only skin deep.

08:23.294 --> 08:30.763
Culturally we are different little bit here
and there but basically in ourselves we are

08:30.763 --> 08:31.763
all spiritual.

08:31.763 --> 08:48.343
And the religion that you have is innate built
in within us which is an part and parcel of

08:48.343 --> 08:49.343
us.

08:49.343 --> 08:56.913
By these marriages we want to achieve a very
happy and a very enjoyable married life.

08:56.913 --> 09:07.284
In the marriage one has to know, nobody should
dominate anyone… that’s a wrong idea.

09:07.284 --> 09:14.724
But we have two wheels of the chariot, one
is big and one is small, then the chariot

09:14.724 --> 09:19.144
will never move forward, it will go round
and round.

09:19.144 --> 09:27.163
Both are equally the same, equal sized, but
they are not similar.

09:27.163 --> 09:31.483
The left cannot be the right and the right
cannot be the left.

09:31.483 --> 09:36.823
So men and women have to be men and women
in Sahaja Yoga.

09:36.823 --> 09:40.144
They cannot be unisex people.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.144
They cannot be.

09:41.144 --> 09:42.344
That’s very important.

09:42.344 --> 09:47.264
The man has to protect the wife, love her,
give her all the security that is needed.

09:47.264 --> 09:53.734
And woman has to nourish the husband and give
him all the love and affection she has.

09:53.734 --> 10:01.963
So here we are on the threshold of entering
into a new life where you have a companion

10:01.963 --> 10:03.544
of your own.

10:03.544 --> 10:07.114
She will be your wife.

10:07.114 --> 10:13.713
Not because only she is in Sahaja Yoga that
you have married her but she’s your own.

10:13.713 --> 10:22.594
So try to prove it to her that you love her
very much and that she is your wife and you

10:22.594 --> 10:25.553
have all that is yours is for her.

10:25.553 --> 10:28.984
This is very important in the very beginning
of it.

10:28.984 --> 10:35.323
Now there’s another thing I have found out
in my experience sometimes that they get married,

10:35.323 --> 10:40.884
I don’t know what happens, they are swayed
into it and they get married.

10:40.884 --> 10:44.273
And after they go back to their own country
they start saying “Mother we know we cannot

10:44.273 --> 10:46.694
manage, we have to work it out.

10:46.694 --> 10:50.114
This, that” Marriages are now worked out.

10:50.114 --> 10:51.574
Spontaneously it happens.

10:51.574 --> 10:56.624
But in India you see we are all the time prepared
for a good married life.

10:56.624 --> 10:58.183
The wife is told, the husband is told all
the time.

10:58.183 --> 11:00.543
So normally when they get married they think
this is what it is for us.

11:00.543 --> 11:02.604
They don’t have love affairs before hand;
they don’t have friends and things.

11:02.604 --> 11:09.224
But even if you had your past, now it’s
finished.

11:09.224 --> 11:16.754
You don’t discuss, don’t tell, don’t
talk about it, do your best.

11:16.754 --> 11:27.293
That’s absolutely wrong because the past
doesn’t exist, what exists is the present.

11:27.293 --> 11:30.433
So enjoy the present, forget it, forgive yourself.

11:30.433 --> 11:37.083
Many people also have this big problem that
they cannot forget their past and go on telling

11:37.083 --> 11:39.773
their wives that I was like this.

11:39.773 --> 11:41.744
There is no need to confess anything.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.143
They think it is honest.

11:43.143 --> 11:54.604
There is no question of honesty or dishonesty
at that time is but to enjoy full joyous mood

11:54.604 --> 11:55.914
of marriage.

11:55.914 --> 11:58.604
That’s in the head.

11:58.604 --> 12:01.104
Otherwise what’s the use of marrying and
then telling stories.

12:01.104 --> 12:07.414
Or some people have very bad habit of telling
him how bad the mother was, the father was

12:07.414 --> 12:12.594
or may be that how miserable he is or how
he has gone through struggle…

12:12.594 --> 12:15.214
there’s no need to talk of this.

12:15.214 --> 12:18.844
At this moment you are married, she is your
wife, and you have to express all your love

12:18.844 --> 12:30.684
and all your attention to her so she feels
secure and happy.

12:30.684 --> 12:32.494
This point please try to note.

12:32.494 --> 12:35.074
Nothing has to be talked about your past.

12:35.074 --> 12:37.724
Then we are Sahaja Yogis.

12:37.724 --> 12:46.203
I have seen some Sahaja Yogis, very great
Sahaja Yogis who are married, very very ordinary

12:46.203 --> 12:49.384
men, very ordinary, ordinary looking superficially.

12:49.384 --> 12:53.173
Or can say some of them could be called as
ugly.

12:53.173 --> 12:58.994
Some girls are like that, some men are like
that.

12:58.994 --> 13:04.923
I mean from these norms that you have about
beauty and all this nonsense.

13:04.923 --> 13:12.944
But when you see a person full of vibrations,
she gives you such tranquility, such joy.

13:12.944 --> 13:20.173
Don’t disturb it by having your pre-married
ideas about your wife you see.

13:20.173 --> 13:26.794
The reality is this is your wife and you are
her husband.

13:26.794 --> 13:30.214
Take the reality into consideration.

13:30.214 --> 13:34.374
Not some imaginary image you have about your
wife.

13:34.374 --> 13:35.634
Your wife is before you, she’s your wife.

13:35.634 --> 13:38.534
What’s the use of having imaginary ideas
you will never enjoy your married life, I

13:38.534 --> 13:46.334
mean if you have imagination, then you should
not even marry: marry your imagination is

13:46.334 --> 13:48.094
a better way.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.974
Why to ruin somebody’s life, why to make
somebody miserable?

13:50.974 --> 13:57.173
They are all intelligent and good Sahaja yoginis.

13:57.173 --> 14:03.974
We have seen to it they are all very good
Sahaja Yoginis.

14:03.974 --> 14:09.324
But once you try to misbehave with your wife
or try to create problems for us, naturally

14:09.324 --> 14:15.064
we don’t want you any more in Sahaja Yoga,
because it is getting too much and you know

14:15.064 --> 14:21.474
as it is not easy to marry you, to get your
visas, to take you down there its quite a

14:21.474 --> 14:25.334
lot of work one has to go into it.

14:25.334 --> 14:32.064
So now don’t think that you have been forced
into any marriage, you have been asked into

14:32.064 --> 14:33.504
any marriage, please.

14:33.504 --> 14:48.404
If you give up this kind of an imaginary ideas
about this marriage, again and again I am

14:48.404 --> 14:56.014
telling to you today now and this time also,
this present moment, all those who feel that

14:56.014 --> 14:58.323
way should immediately tell me, I will be
extremely happy.

14:58.323 --> 15:01.624
There is another third thing that I have seen
about the western people is that they are

15:01.624 --> 15:02.624
literally frightened of marriage, literally
frightened.

15:02.624 --> 15:10.233
First is they may live with a woman for 10
days or 20 days or 10 years, but as soon as

15:10.233 --> 15:18.703
they get married they go for a divorce, very
funny(??).

15:18.703 --> 15:27.793
For this I think the law is responsible, because
the women think they will get money out of

15:27.793 --> 15:34.763
their husbands may be or the husbands think
that they will get money out of their wives.

15:34.763 --> 15:53.944
In Sahaja Yoga if you want to take the divorce
later on, which I don’t like at all.

15:53.944 --> 15:59.703
We have only 1 % divorces, then I would not
allow you to extract money from the other,

15:59.703 --> 16:03.904
never, and nor the girl should extract money
from you.

16:03.904 --> 16:17.704
Last but not the least is important that,
once you are married, now the girls may not

16:17.704 --> 16:27.394
be able to go immediately from their various
places because of visa problems, but don’t

16:27.394 --> 16:37.914
give them money to be sent to their families,
that is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

16:37.914 --> 16:44.664
The girl should not send their money to their
parents that’s not allowed and trouble the

16:44.664 --> 16:46.294
husband for that.

16:46.294 --> 16:51.824
Sometimes if you want to send is alright,
but there should not be regular remittance

16:51.824 --> 17:00.614
all the time and this is sometimes comes to
my notice which I do not want to encourage.

17:00.614 --> 17:10.024
As far as that part is concerned you should
not give any money for sending it to the relations

17:10.024 --> 17:22.234
of your wife otherwise it will become a money
oriented marriage and people would marry because

17:22.234 --> 17:23.234
they can extract some money from it.

17:23.234 --> 17:24.234
All these things should be kept in to it,
that we are now married, we are stupid if

17:24.234 --> 17:30.324
we want to have a divorce, stupid.

17:30.324 --> 17:38.063
and I don’t like divorce at all.

17:38.063 --> 17:46.113
Though I allow because sometimes I find horrible
things happening.

17:46.113 --> 17:57.884
But rarely I would allow anybody to have a
divorce, rarely, so this idea should be given

17:57.884 --> 18:00.444
up and one should not be selfish…

18:00.444 --> 18:07.063
But from the very beginning if you try to
be very kind and nice, I am sure things will

18:07.063 --> 18:08.063
work out.

18:08.063 --> 18:17.924
We have to prove to the world that marriage
is a divine institution and by this divine

18:17.924 --> 18:24.984
institution if you have been put together
it’s also a divine plan.

18:24.984 --> 18:28.424
And through this divine plan many things are
going to work out.

18:28.424 --> 18:31.074
So those who are getting married today are
helping Sahaja Yoga very much.

18:31.074 --> 18:38.003
I have already told you there are many saints
who want to be married.

18:38.003 --> 18:41.084
And nowadays that you see this world full
of horrible people.

18:41.084 --> 18:59.224
We need so many saints to be born and so the
saints will be born in case you have good

18:59.224 --> 19:02.134
married time, happy married life and enjoyable
life.

19:02.134 --> 19:07.104
I think all this lecturing is of no use unless
and until you start enjoying your married

19:07.104 --> 19:08.104
life.

19:08.104 --> 19:09.104
There are such sweet things I need not tell
you.

19:09.104 --> 19:12.964
I was surprised that there is no book in English
language which describes the romance after

19:12.964 --> 19:20.434
marriage, I was surprised, no book, can you
imagine? and in India you won’t find any

19:20.434 --> 19:23.933
books which describe the romance before the
marriage.

19:23.933 --> 19:35.134
Nowadays they have started doing some sort
of stupid things but normally no question.

19:35.134 --> 19:42.574
So now it is for you, enjoy your married life
much more than you have enjoyed your childhood,

19:42.574 --> 19:47.534
your youth or any other times in college,
schools, anywhere.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.514
So be prepared.

19:49.514 --> 19:54.784
Make yourself friendly, ??open it, open your
heart.

19:54.784 --> 19:57.433
Don’t try to find faults in your wife.

19:57.433 --> 20:00.534
I mean some things she doesn’t know, some
things you don’t know.

20:00.534 --> 20:01.534
Doesn’t matter.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.303
All the time trying to find faults makes you
faulty.

20:04.303 --> 20:05.803
Don’t find faults.

20:05.803 --> 20:14.423
If you see somebody doing something wrong,
suppose if you find that person is trying

20:14.423 --> 20:16.673
to do something.

20:16.673 --> 20:23.334
All right, you just do it your self or don’t
tell.

20:23.334 --> 20:29.553
Gradually she will learn from you what is
the right way is.

20:29.553 --> 20:33.314
And one should make fun of these moments,
for example I don’t know how to do any banking,

20:33.314 --> 20:34.314
write a cheque.

20:34.314 --> 20:41.313
I am very bad at many things you see, can’t
even open a television, I can’t even the

20:41.313 --> 20:42.694
air conditioner.

20:42.694 --> 20:45.534
So many things I just can’t do.

20:45.534 --> 20:46.534
Doesn’t matter.

20:46.534 --> 20:47.563
My husband also equally the same.

20:47.563 --> 20:48.834
So we enjoy each other.

20:48.834 --> 20:51.374
All part and parcel of Sahaja Yoga.

20:51.374 --> 20:54.964
One unit here, one unit there, one unit there.

20:54.964 --> 21:01.433
But they are in the same ocean of spirituality.

21:01.433 --> 21:09.104
So any Sahaja Yogi who comes to your house
or any one, especially Indian women you will

21:09.104 --> 21:10.144
find, they will look after the guests very
well.

21:10.144 --> 21:14.164
And then there is some sort of a thing called
jealousy comes out…

21:14.164 --> 21:16.084
it’s very absurd.

21:16.084 --> 21:21.554
Indian women will not have anybody else as
their husbands but their own.

21:21.554 --> 21:22.554
It is then worked out.

21:22.554 --> 21:24.484
So don’t have these funny ideas that she
is very friendly, she is looking after other

21:24.484 --> 21:25.484
people, this and that.

21:25.484 --> 21:30.344
This kind of a nonsense should not be there.

21:30.344 --> 21:38.863
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t have those things,
we have become very pure, their eyes are pure.

21:38.863 --> 21:41.684
So don’t have any doubts about your wives.

21:41.684 --> 21:47.974
Same with the wives I will tell you.

21:47.974 --> 21:53.003
This will make your life very much more happier
and confident.

21:53.003 --> 22:01.113
If you have any problem you can always write
to me directly, need not even.

22:01.113 --> 22:10.184
tell through your leaders you can directly
write to me if you really have problem.

22:10.184 --> 22:25.654
But I think you are all intelligent people,
you should be able to sort out everything.

43:56.632 --> 44:05.393
Now I have been already with your fiancés
and I talked to them.

44:05.393 --> 44:09.583
I have praised you a lot.

44:09.583 --> 44:18.483
Now first thing we have to know that this
marriage ceremony that we have organised with

44:18.483 --> 44:20.523
a purpose.

44:20.523 --> 44:26.973
The first purpose is that regard marriage
is very essential for Sahaja Yoga.

44:26.973 --> 44:32.343
If somebody doesn’t want to marry, we say
alright you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

44:32.343 --> 44:33.383
It’s alright.

44:33.383 --> 44:42.993
Now why marriage is important, because a marriage
is like a big Yagnya, it’s like a big Tapasya,

44:42.993 --> 44:49.853
you can call it, or it’s a great experience.

44:49.853 --> 44:56.343
How to achieve balance, how to become a witness
and how to become a spirit.

44:56.343 --> 44:57.343
It’s very important.

44:57.343 --> 45:07.593
Now the first and foremost thing we have to
know (is) that he is your husband and nobody

45:07.593 --> 45:09.223
else is your husband.

45:09.223 --> 45:14.632
Nobody is more important than he is.

45:15.282 --> 45:19.482
See men are very easy to be controlled.

45:19.482 --> 45:25.152
If you can make them feel they are the most
important people for you, then you can manage

45:25.152 --> 45:27.452
them very well.

45:27.452 --> 45:34.701
But the first foremost ambition should be
or the idea should be that I will make my

45:34.701 --> 45:37.192
married life extremely happy.

45:37.192 --> 45:40.492
Because if the married life is happy you will
be happy.

45:40.492 --> 45:43.052
Now men have a habit of sometimes losing temper.

45:43.052 --> 45:45.981
Doesn’t matter that’s their habit.

45:45.981 --> 45:49.451
So you shouldn’t immediately become the
same type.

45:49.451 --> 46:03.731
But you can little bit in a womanly way try
to put your sweet device of smiling it or

46:03.731 --> 46:09.624
laughing it out or little bit [showing you
nice?] somehow.

46:09.794 --> 46:11.815
But not to make it serious.

46:11.815 --> 46:13.264
It’s very important.

46:13.264 --> 46:15.645
So how to handle the men.

46:15.645 --> 46:21.475
Especially your husbands is an art and that
art you will achieve gradually when you start

46:21.475 --> 46:22.535
seeing.

46:22.535 --> 46:28.125
But if you start finding faults with the men
and start saying you can’t do this, you

46:28.125 --> 46:34.634
can’t do this, you don’t know how to drive
or how to do this, or this things.

46:34.634 --> 46:36.434
Then you are finished.

46:36.434 --> 46:38.434
You must say you are the best driver.

46:38.434 --> 46:40.535
You are the best.

46:40.535 --> 46:43.929
That’s the way you have to deal with him.

46:43.929 --> 46:44.929
But not that you are befooling them.

46:44.929 --> 46:47.485
Because you say this because you love.

46:47.485 --> 46:51.130
And love is the basis between you and him.

46:51.210 --> 46:52.210
Nothing else.

46:52.210 --> 46:53.210
Not Money.

46:53.210 --> 46:56.179
Not what you have got for him or he has brought
for you.

46:56.179 --> 46:57.389
Nothing of that.

46:57.389 --> 46:59.880
All these things are not materialistic.

47:00.600 --> 47:03.160
They have nothing to do with matter.

47:03.219 --> 47:11.018
Love is something which you can express also
through matter, sometimes by giving some nice

47:11.249 --> 47:14.070
presents or nice food or something.

47:14.070 --> 47:16.100
But the most important thing is your heart.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.759
You should not cheat.

47:17.759 --> 47:24.099
In anyway you should not be hypocritical,
and you should not try to do something that

47:24.099 --> 47:25.809
is not pure.

47:25.809 --> 47:33.749
So in Sahaja Yoga, the purpose of these marriages
is to have you connected internationally.

47:33.749 --> 47:40.399
So you all transcend all the barriers of your
nationality, the barriers of our racialism,

47:40.399 --> 47:47.940
barriers of caste, barriers of so much materialism.

47:47.940 --> 47:49.899
So you should not compare your husband with
anyone.

47:49.899 --> 47:53.990
He is Your husband and you shouldn’t expect
too much from him.

47:53.990 --> 47:58.689
He’s not given me this, he has not done
that for me, he’s like this.

47:58.959 --> 48:00.760
This is not necessary.

48:00.760 --> 48:04.989
You must always think what I have done for
him.

48:04.989 --> 48:08.049
Also what’s wrong with me?

48:08.049 --> 48:13.749
Now some people, especially in the west it’s
very common, that after marriage they think

48:13.749 --> 48:17.230
that they have to work out marriages, no working
out.

48:17.230 --> 48:22.710
You see like they think that as you work out
your kitchen or work out your things.

48:22.710 --> 48:23.840
It’s not like this.

48:23.840 --> 48:28.380
Spontaneously between the two human beings
who are realised souls.

48:28.380 --> 48:35.080
It is not that you are working out anything,
but spontaneously you are going to enjoy,

48:35.080 --> 48:36.080
spontaneously.

48:36.080 --> 48:43.210
Now if you become extremely critical and try
to show you are very brilliant and this.

48:43.210 --> 48:44.870
It’s not going to work.

48:44.870 --> 48:46.610
To be humble.

48:46.610 --> 48:48.300
Keep quiet.

48:48.300 --> 48:51.930
Those who are really intelligent always keep
quiet and watch things.

48:51.930 --> 48:55.930
But those who are not, are bumptious.

48:55.930 --> 49:03.500
The more you are in Sahaja Yoga, the more
you will be respected by him and by everybody.

49:03.500 --> 49:07.170
Apart from that, there are so many saints
who want to be born.

49:07.170 --> 49:12.770
Once you have very happy married life among
yourselves, those saints will be born to you,

49:12.770 --> 49:16.100
and it will be such a blessing and joy for
you.

49:16.100 --> 49:23.360
So try to understand not to boss your husband
or try to put him right or do things and in

49:23.360 --> 49:24.360
a very.

49:24.360 --> 49:31.640
I have seen some ladies who are extremely
tense, very tense type.

49:31.977 --> 49:33.820
They can never give joy.

49:33.910 --> 49:37.440
They are themselves not in joy, how can they
give joy, are themselves not in joy.

49:37.440 --> 49:39.040
So the tension should not be there.

49:39.040 --> 49:40.710
At all of any kind.

49:40.710 --> 49:41.790
Be relaxed.

49:41.790 --> 49:49.270
You are the other side of SahajaYoga, which
gives peace, joy, nourishment and also complete

49:49.270 --> 49:51.590
tranquillity.

49:51.590 --> 49:55.250
In the family you are responsible for tranquillity.

49:55.250 --> 50:00.070
Even if husband is angry, children are fighting,
if the mother is tranquil you can control

50:00.070 --> 50:01.450
all the situation.

50:01.450 --> 50:08.280
So the situation has to be controlled in a
way that you make life happy for everyone.

50:08.280 --> 50:15.470
Sometimes women feel very angry when I tell
them that first feed your children, your husband

50:15.470 --> 50:17.960
and then you eat yourself.

50:17.960 --> 50:19.720
Because that is the job of a woman.

50:19.720 --> 50:25.440
Like a man should go, earn living, do what
he wants to do, job and all that.

50:25.440 --> 50:31.250
But the woman has to really look after the
husband, look after the family, look after

50:31.250 --> 50:32.250
everything.

50:32.250 --> 50:37.850
Also you will find our Indian husbands not
so good, as far as gardening is concerned,

50:37.850 --> 50:48.414
or you can say, they don’t know how to mend
anything like cars or your plumbing, they

50:48.434 --> 50:49.884
don’t know.

50:49.914 --> 50:52.114
So doesn’t matter, take it easy.

50:52.124 --> 50:55.284
Gradually they will pick up and they’ll
learn and they’ll do it.

50:55.954 --> 50:57.794
But don’t become impatient with them.

50:57.794 --> 51:00.154
Just make fun of it, you see, just make fun.

51:00.154 --> 51:07.054
That the best way to manage it and that don’t
expect too much, that they will do this nicely.

51:07.054 --> 51:12.154
Sometimes they cannot clean the utensils properly,
they don’t know how to do it.

51:12.154 --> 51:13.154
So alright.

51:13.154 --> 51:16.684
Just make fun of it and just enjoy it because
they have [unclear].

51:16.684 --> 51:21.534
You see in England or America I have seen
anywhere, they have no servants at all.

51:21.534 --> 51:25.954
While we have servants here so all these boys
are spoiled by the servants.

51:25.954 --> 51:31.124
So they are absolutely good for nothing as
far as these things are concerned.

51:31.124 --> 51:37.274
But if you just try to teach them and help
them, they will definitely go all out to do

51:37.274 --> 51:38.274
it.

51:38.274 --> 51:42.484
So the only thing you have to do is to love
them with a clear heart.

51:42.484 --> 51:48.144
And all the time forgive and let them know
that that she is the only one I have in the

51:48.144 --> 51:53.054
whole world apart from the Holy Mother.

51:53.054 --> 52:01.023
Of course, I’m not against divorce, but
I’m not for it.

52:01.353 --> 52:04.433
In the sense that I don’t like people when
they divorce.

52:04.433 --> 52:10.633
But when things are impossible and difficult
and one has to go in for such a thing, doesn’t

52:10.633 --> 52:11.633
matter.

52:11.633 --> 52:12.633
Sometimes one has to do it.

52:12.633 --> 52:14.303
But it should be very rare.

52:14.303 --> 52:17.733
One should not think of a divorce at all.

52:17.733 --> 52:21.633
People think of divorce in the west mostly
because of the laws, because the wife gets

52:21.633 --> 52:23.503
the money or the husband gets the money.

52:23.503 --> 52:28.253
But in SahajaYoga if you are marrying, all
these things even if you are divorced, I will

52:28.253 --> 52:29.763
not support.

52:29.763 --> 52:35.003
Moreover, another thing is that the wives
should not take money from the husband and

52:35.003 --> 52:37.493
send it to her relations.

52:37.493 --> 52:38.493
Never.

52:38.493 --> 52:47.462
It’s a very very wrong thing, is to support
your family through the money of their husband

52:47.462 --> 52:48.462
Absolutely not allowed.

52:48.462 --> 52:49.552
That should not be done.

52:49.552 --> 52:54.802
They.., you should not put the pressure of
your family on your husband.

52:54.802 --> 53:00.773
You see there has to be a clear cut understanding
for all of you.

53:00.773 --> 53:06.526
That you will not take.you must keep your
self respect.

53:08.626 --> 53:10.756
Don’t ask for anything.

53:10.756 --> 53:13.525
If he gives you anything [unclear] well and
good.

53:13.525 --> 53:15.136
But don’t ask, don’t demand.

53:15.136 --> 53:17.556
That means you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

53:17.556 --> 53:21.225
If you are a satisfied soul why should you
ask for anything?

53:21.225 --> 53:25.006
Or somebody gets something, she has got this,
she has …Nothing of that kind.

53:24.996 --> 53:32.582
You be satisfied and this is how some girls
nag the husbands very much.

53:32.712 --> 53:37.501
Most important thing is that you should not
talk about your past, at all.

53:37.501 --> 53:38.501
Because past is finished.

53:38.501 --> 53:39.501
Now you are Sahaja Yogis.

53:39.501 --> 53:42.611
You are all realised souls.

53:42.611 --> 53:45.282
So you don’t have to say a word about your
past.

53:45.282 --> 53:51.412
Even if husband starts talking you just stop,
and tell him we are to live in the present.

53:51.412 --> 53:53.421
Don’t tell us about your past.

53:53.421 --> 53:57.941
I don’t know why people think that they
will look more attractive if they talk about

53:57.941 --> 54:00.101
all the past nonsense they did.

54:00.101 --> 54:02.371
Or say that my mother was so bad.

54:02.371 --> 54:05.842
All psychological nonsense.

54:05.842 --> 54:11.671
Not to put your parents into jeopardy by saying
that they are very bad, they are no good.

54:11.671 --> 54:12.671
This, that..

54:12.671 --> 54:21.631
Just forget the past and live in the present
because in the present resides the reality

54:21.631 --> 54:26.601
and the reality is the ocean of joy.

54:26.601 --> 54:29.172
You should not nag him for anything.

54:29.172 --> 54:31.981
Supposing he didn’t like something, you
shouldn’t do it.

54:31.981 --> 54:36.931
Whatever he doesn’t like, small things,
you know like, I was married in a family which

54:36.931 --> 54:40.291
was culturally very different, very different.

54:40.291 --> 54:42.172
And they don’t wear flowers.

54:42.172 --> 54:47.941
You see, and in India all the married ladies,
I mean down south, I’m saying in my community,

54:47.941 --> 54:54.441
all wear garlands around their buns and [unclear].

54:54.441 --> 54:56.191
Always wear.

54:56.191 --> 54:57.772
My husband said no better not do it.

54:57.772 --> 55:04.231
Because you know here in our community only
the bad women wear that to attract man.

55:04.231 --> 55:07.611
Since that day I have never worn it.

55:07.611 --> 55:10.081
Doesn’t matter, not important.

55:12.801 --> 55:18.761
So, also you must understand now you have
to take to the style of life of your husband.

55:18.761 --> 55:22.591
He is fond of entertaining, look after that.

55:22.591 --> 55:24.991
Women should be entertaining, they should
look after.

55:24.991 --> 55:29.160
They should not mind if somebody comes to
stay with them or lives with them.

55:29.160 --> 55:30.581
They should not try to show.

55:30.581 --> 55:35.450
On the contrary they should be happy they
are able to look after someone who is a Sahaja

55:35.450 --> 55:36.450
Yogi.

55:36.450 --> 55:41.001
So, for the Sahaja Yogis, you must keep always
your heart open, your house open.

55:41.001 --> 55:46.391
There are so many things which I would like
to tell you but in this short time, I have

55:46.391 --> 55:54.871
to just say that it is the responsibility
of the women to make their marriages happy.

55:54.871 --> 56:03.521
Depends on their intelligence and on their
dedication to Sahaja Yoga.

56:03.521 --> 56:06.391
It’s your responsibility.

56:06.391 --> 56:15.354
And if you see in a wider sense the responsibility
of making a good society is that of a woman.

56:15.624 --> 56:17.244
Even if she has to suffer she can.

56:17.244 --> 56:18.494
She is like this mother Earth.

56:18.494 --> 56:21.023
She can suffer anything She never feels she
suffers.

56:21.023 --> 56:22.283
She is so great.

56:22.283 --> 56:24.093
You are Shaktis.

56:24.093 --> 56:28.364
So as Shaktis if you have to suffer, you don’t
mind.

56:28.364 --> 56:36.513
And what you have to feel is that we are responsible
for making our Sahaja Yoga society a perfect

56:36.513 --> 56:37.513
society.

56:37.513 --> 56:41.650
That’s our responsibility.

56:42.880 --> 56:52.283
All your greed, all your ambitions, everything
should be directed towards making a very very

56:52.379 --> 56:53.679
happy married life.

56:55.029 --> 57:11.879
I wish, I wish all, all of you, a very happy
and prosperous married life.
