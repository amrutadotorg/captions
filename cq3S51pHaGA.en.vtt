WEBVTT

00:07:26.534 --> 00:07:35.624
The purpose of these marriages is this, that
we should have international understanding

00:07:35.624 --> 00:07:47.214
about human beings that after coming to Sahaja
Yoga we transcend all the barriers, all the

00:07:47.214 --> 00:07:56.184
barriers of race, religion, ?? and nationality.

00:07:56.184 --> 00:08:10.204
We have to create this homogenous world and
make it peaceful by removing this disease

00:08:10.204 --> 00:08:16.424
of national identification or racial identification.

00:08:16.424 --> 00:08:21.134
We are all created by God Almighty.

00:08:21.134 --> 00:08:23.294
Our differences are only skin deep.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:30.763
Culturally we are different little bit here
and there but basically in ourselves we are

00:08:30.763 --> 00:08:31.763
all spiritual.

00:08:31.763 --> 00:08:48.343
And the religion that you have is innate built
in within us which is an part and parcel of

00:08:48.343 --> 00:08:49.343
us.

00:08:49.343 --> 00:08:56.913
By these marriages we want to achieve a very
happy and a very enjoyable married life.

00:08:56.913 --> 00:09:07.284
In the marriage one has to know, nobody should
dominate anyone… that’s a wrong idea.

00:09:07.284 --> 00:09:14.724
But we have two wheels of the chariot, one
is big and one is small, then the chariot

00:09:14.724 --> 00:09:19.144
will never move forward, it will go round
and round.

00:09:19.144 --> 00:09:27.163
Both are equally the same, equal sized, but
they are not similar.

00:09:27.163 --> 00:09:31.483
The left cannot be the right and the right cannot be the left.

00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:36.823
So men and women have to be men and women
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:36.823 --> 00:09:40.144
They cannot be unisex people.

00:09:40.144 --> 00:09:41.144
They cannot be.

00:09:41.144 --> 00:09:42.344
That’s very important.

00:09:42.344 --> 00:09:47.264
The man has to protect the wife, love her,
give her all the security that is needed.

00:09:47.264 --> 00:09:53.734
And woman has to nourish the husband and give
him all the love and affection she has.

00:09:53.734 --> 00:10:01.963
So here we are on the threshold of entering
into a new life where you have a companion

00:10:01.963 --> 00:10:03.544
of your own.

00:10:03.544 --> 00:10:07.114
She will be your wife.

00:10:07.114 --> 00:10:13.713
Not because only she is in Sahaja Yoga that
you have married her but she’s your own.

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:22.594
So try to prove it to her that you love her
very much and that she is your wife and you

00:10:22.594 --> 00:10:25.553
have all that is yours is for her.

00:10:25.553 --> 00:10:28.984
This is very important in the very beginning
of it.

00:10:28.984 --> 00:10:35.323
Now there’s another thing I have found out
in my experience sometimes that they get married,

00:10:35.323 --> 00:10:40.884
I don’t know what happens, they are swayed into it and they get mad.

00:10:40.884 --> 00:10:44.273
And after they go back to their own country
they start saying “Mother we know we cannot

00:10:44.273 --> 00:10:46.694
manage, we have to work it out.

00:10:46.694 --> 00:10:50.114
This, that” Marriages are now worked out.

00:10:50.114 --> 00:10:51.574
Spontaneously it happens.

00:10:51.574 --> 00:10:56.624
But in India you see we are all the time prepared
for a good married life.

00:10:56.624 --> 00:10:58.183
The wife is told, the husband is told all
the time.

00:10:58.183 --> 00:11:00.543
So normally when they get married they think
this is what it is for us.

00:11:00.543 --> 00:11:02.604
They don’t have love affairs before hand;
they don’t have friends and things.

00:11:02.604 --> 00:11:09.224
But even if you had your past, now it’s
finished.

00:11:09.224 --> 00:11:16.754
You don’t discuss, don’t tell, don’t talk about it to your brides.

00:11:16.754 --> 00:11:27.293
That’s absolutely wrong because the past
doesn’t exist, what exists is the present.

00:11:27.293 --> 00:11:30.433
So enjoy the present, forget it, forgive yourself.

00:11:30.433 --> 00:11:37.083
Many people also have this big problem that
they cannot forget their past and go on telling

00:11:37.083 --> 00:11:39.773
their wives that I was like this.

00:11:39.773 --> 00:11:41.744
There is no need to confess anything.

00:11:41.744 --> 00:11:43.143
They think it is honest.

00:11:43.143 --> 00:11:54.604
There is no question of honesty or dishonesty
at that time is but to enjoy full joyous mood

00:11:54.604 --> 00:11:55.914
of marriage.

00:11:55.914 --> 00:11:58.604
That’s in the end.

00:11:58.604 --> 00:12:01.104
Otherwise what’s the use of marrying and
then telling stories.

00:12:01.104 --> 00:12:07.414
Or some people have very bad habit of telling
him how bad the mother was, the father was

00:12:07.414 --> 00:12:12.594
or may be that how miserable he is or how
he has gone through struggle…

00:12:12.594 --> 00:12:15.214
there’s no need to talk of this.

00:12:15.214 --> 00:12:18.844
At this moment you are married, she is your
wife, and you have to express all your love

00:12:18.844 --> 00:12:30.684
and all your attention to her so she feels
secure and happy.

00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:32.494
This point please try to note.

00:12:32.494 --> 00:12:35.074
Nothing has to be talked about your past.

00:12:35.074 --> 00:12:37.724
Then we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:46.203
I have seen some Sahaja Yogis, very great
Sahaja Yogis who are married, very very ordinary

00:12:46.203 --> 00:12:49.384
men, very ordinary, ordinary looking superficially.

00:12:49.384 --> 00:12:53.173
Or can say some of them could be called as
ugly.

00:12:53.173 --> 00:12:58.994
Some girls are like that, some men are like
that.

00:12:58.994 --> 00:13:04.923
I mean from these norms that you have about
beauty and all this nonsense.

00:13:04.923 --> 00:13:12.944
But when you see a person full of vibrations,
she gives you such tranquility, such joy.

00:13:12.944 --> 00:13:20.173
Don’t disturb it by having your pre-married
ideas about your wife you see.

00:13:20.173 --> 00:13:26.794
The reality is this is your wife and you are
her husband.

00:13:26.794 --> 00:13:30.214
Take the reality into consideration.

00:13:30.214 --> 00:13:34.374
Not some imaginary image you have about your
wife.

00:13:34.374 --> 00:13:35.634
Your wife is before you, she’s your wife.

00:13:35.634 --> 00:13:38.534
What’s the use of having imaginary ideas
you will never enjoy your married life, I

00:13:38.534 --> 00:13:46.334
mean if you have imagination, then you should
not even marry: marry your imagination is

00:13:46.334 --> 00:13:48.094
a better way.

00:13:48.094 --> 00:13:50.974
Why to ruin somebody’s life, why to make
somebody miserable?

00:13:50.974 --> 00:13:57.173
They are all intelligent and good Sahaja yoginis.

00:13:57.173 --> 00:14:03.974
We have seen to it they are all very good
Sahaja Yoginis.

00:14:03.974 --> 00:14:09.324
But once you try to misbehave with your wife
or try to create problems for us, naturally

00:14:09.324 --> 00:14:15.064
we don’t want you any more in Sahaja Yoga,
because it is getting too much and you know

00:14:15.064 --> 00:14:21.474
as it is not easy to marry you, to get your
visas, to take you down there its quite a

00:14:21.474 --> 00:14:25.334
lot of work one has to go into it.

00:14:25.334 --> 00:14:32.064
So now don’t think that you have been forced
into any marriage, you have been asked into

00:14:32.064 --> 00:14:33.504
any marriage, please.

00:14:33.504 --> 00:14:48.404
If you give up this kind of an imaginary ideas
about this marriage, again and again I am

00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:56.014
telling to you today now and this time also,
this present moment, all those who feel that

00:14:56.014 --> 00:14:58.323
way should immediately tell me, I will be
extremely happy.

00:14:58.323 --> 00:15:01.624
There is another third thing that I have seen
about the western people is that they are

00:15:01.624 --> 00:15:02.624
literally frightened of marriage, literally
frightened.

00:15:02.624 --> 00:15:10.233
First is they may live with a woman for 10
days or 20 days or 10 years, but as soon as

00:15:10.233 --> 00:15:18.703
they get married they go for a divorce, very
funny(??).

00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:27.793
For this I think the law is responsible, because
the women think they will get money out of

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:34.763
their husbands may be or the husbands think
that they will get money out of their wives.

00:15:34.763 --> 00:15:53.944
In Sahaja Yoga if you want to take the divorce
later on, which I don’t like at all.

00:15:53.944 --> 00:15:59.703
We have only 1 % divorces, then I would not
allow you to extract money from the other,

00:15:59.703 --> 00:16:03.904
never, and nor the girl should extract money
from you.

00:16:03.904 --> 00:16:17.704
Last but not the least is important that,
once you are married, now the girls may not

00:16:17.704 --> 00:16:27.394
be able to go immediately from their various
places because of visa problems, but don’t

00:16:27.394 --> 00:16:37.914
give them money to be sent to their families,
that is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:44.664
The girl should not send their money to their
parents that’s not allowed and trouble the

00:16:44.664 --> 00:16:46.294
husband for that.

00:16:46.294 --> 00:16:51.824
Sometimes if you want to send is alright,
but there should not be regular remittance

00:16:51.824 --> 00:17:00.614
all the time and this is sometimes comes to
my notice which I do not want to encourage.

00:17:00.614 --> 00:17:10.024
As far as that part is concerned you should
not give any money for sending it to the relations

00:17:10.024 --> 00:17:22.234
of your wife otherwise it will become a money
oriented marriage and people would marry because

00:17:22.234 --> 00:17:23.234
they can extract some money from it.

00:17:23.234 --> 00:17:24.234
All these things should be kept in to it, that we are now married in Sahaja Yoga, we are stupid if

00:17:24.234 --> 00:17:30.324
we want to have a divorce, stupid.

00:17:30.324 --> 00:17:38.063
and I don’t like divorce at all.

00:17:38.063 --> 00:17:46.113
Though I allow because sometimes I find horrible
things happening.

00:17:46.113 --> 00:17:57.884
But rarely I would allow anybody to have a
divorce, rarely, so this idea should be given

00:17:57.884 --> 00:18:00.444
up and one should not be selfish…

00:18:00.444 --> 00:18:07.063
But from the very beginning if you try to
be very kind and nice, I am sure things will

00:18:07.063 --> 00:18:08.063
work out.

00:18:08.063 --> 00:18:17.924
We have to prove to the world that marriage
is a divine institution and by this divine

00:18:17.924 --> 00:18:24.984
institution if you have been put together
it’s also a divine plan.

00:18:24.984 --> 00:18:28.424
And through this divine plan many things are
going to work out.

00:18:28.424 --> 00:18:31.074
So those who are getting married today are
helping Sahaja Yoga very much.

00:18:31.074 --> 00:18:38.003
I have already told you there are many saints
who want to be married.

00:18:38.003 --> 00:18:41.084
And nowadays that you see this world full
of horrible people.

00:18:41.084 --> 00:18:59.224
We need so many saints to be born and so the
saints will be born in case you have good

00:18:59.224 --> 00:19:02.134
married time, happy married life and enjoyable
life.

00:19:02.134 --> 00:19:07.104
I think all this lecturing is of no use unless
and until you start enjoying your married

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:08.104
life.

00:19:08.104 --> 00:19:09.104
There are such sweet things I need not tell
you.

00:19:09.104 --> 00:19:12.964
I was surprised that there is no book in English
language which describes the romance after

00:19:12.964 --> 00:19:20.434
marriage, I was surprised, no book, can you
imagine? and in India you won’t find any

00:19:20.434 --> 00:19:23.933
books which describe the romance before the
marriage.

00:19:23.933 --> 00:19:35.134
Nowadays they have started doing some sort
of stupid things but normally no question.

00:19:35.134 --> 00:19:42.574
So now it is for you, enjoy your married life
much more than you have enjoyed your childhood,

00:19:42.574 --> 00:19:47.534
your youth or any other times in college,
schools, anywhere.

00:19:47.534 --> 00:19:49.514
So be prepared.

00:19:49.514 --> 00:19:54.784
 Make yourself ready, you can do it, open your heart.

00:19:54.784 --> 00:19:57.433
Don’t try to find faults in your wife.

00:19:57.433 --> 00:20:00.534
I mean some things she doesn’t know, some
things you don’t know.

00:20:00.534 --> 00:20:01.534
Doesn’t matter.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:04.303
All the time trying to find faults makes you
faulty.

00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:05.803
Don’t find faults.

00:20:05.803 --> 00:20:14.423
If you see somebody doing something wrong,
suppose if you find that person is trying

00:20:14.423 --> 00:20:16.673
to do something.

00:20:16.673 --> 00:20:23.334
All right, you just do it your self or don’t
tell.

00:20:23.334 --> 00:20:29.553
Gradually she will learn from you what is
the right way is.

00:20:29.553 --> 00:20:33.314
And one should make fun of these moments,
for example I don’t know how to do any banking,

00:20:33.314 --> 00:20:34.314
write a cheque.

00:20:34.314 --> 00:20:41.313
I am very bad at many things you see, can’t
even open a television, I can’t even the

00:20:41.313 --> 00:20:42.694
air conditioner.

00:20:42.694 --> 00:20:45.534
So many things I just can’t do.

00:20:45.534 --> 00:20:46.534
Doesn’t matter.

00:20:46.534 --> 00:20:47.563
My husband also equally the same.

00:20:47.563 --> 00:20:48.834
So we enjoy each other.

00:20:48.834 --> 00:20:51.374
All part and parcel of Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:51.374 --> 00:20:54.964
One unit here, one unit there, one unit there.

00:20:54.964 --> 00:21:01.433
But they are in the same ocean of spirituality.

00:21:01.433 --> 00:21:09.104
So any Sahaja Yogi who comes to your house
or any one, especially Indian women you will

00:21:09.104 --> 00:21:10.144
find, they will look after the guests very
well.

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:14.164
And then there is some sort of a thing called
jealousy comes out…

00:21:14.164 --> 00:21:16.084
it’s very absurd.

00:21:16.084 --> 00:21:21.554
Indian women will not have anybody else as
their husbands but their own.

00:21:21.554 --> 00:21:22.554
It is then worked out.

00:21:22.554 --> 00:21:24.484
So don’t have these funny ideas that she
is very friendly, she is looking after other

00:21:24.484 --> 00:21:25.484
people, this and that.

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:30.344
This kind of a nonsense should not be there.

00:21:30.344 --> 00:21:38.863
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t have those things,
we have become very pure, their eyes are pure.

00:21:38.863 --> 00:21:41.684
So don’t have any doubts about your wives.

00:21:41.684 --> 00:21:47.974
Same with the wives I will tell you.

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:53.003
This will make your life very much more happier
and confident.

00:21:53.003 --> 00:22:01.113
If you have any problem you can always write to me directly. 

00:22:01.113 --> 00:22:10.184
Need not even go through your leaders but you can directly write to me if you really have problem.

00:22:10.184 --> 00:22:25.654
But I think you are all intelligent people,
you should be able to sort out everything.

00:43:56.632 --> 00:44:05.393
Now I have been already with your fiancés
and I talked to them.

00:44:05.393 --> 00:44:09.583
I have praised you a lot.

00:44:09.583 --> 00:44:18.483
Now first thing we have to know that this
marriage ceremony that we have organised with

00:44:18.483 --> 00:44:20.523
a purpose.

00:44:20.523 --> 00:44:26.973
The first purpose is that regard marriage
is very essential for Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:26.973 --> 00:44:32.343
If somebody doesn’t want to marry, we say
alright you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:32.343 --> 00:44:33.383
It’s alright.

00:44:33.383 --> 00:44:42.993
Now why marriage is important, because a marriage
is like a big Yagnya, it’s like a big Tapasya,

00:44:42.993 --> 00:44:49.853
you can call it, or it’s a great experience.

00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:56.343
How to achieve balance, how to become a witness
and how to become a spirit.

00:44:56.343 --> 00:44:57.343
It’s very important.

00:44:57.343 --> 00:45:07.593
Now the first and foremost thing we have to
know (is) that he is your husband and nobody

00:45:07.593 --> 00:45:09.223
else is your husband.

00:45:09.223 --> 00:45:14.632
Nobody is more important than he is.

00:45:15.282 --> 00:45:19.482
See men are very easy to be controlled.

00:45:19.482 --> 00:45:25.152
If you can make them feel they are the most
important people for you, then you can manage

00:45:25.152 --> 00:45:27.452
them very well.

00:45:27.452 --> 00:45:34.701
But the first foremost ambition should be
or the idea should be that I will make my

00:45:34.701 --> 00:45:37.192
married life extremely happy.

00:45:37.192 --> 00:45:40.492
Because if the married life is happy you will
be happy.

00:45:40.492 --> 00:45:43.052
Now men have a habit of sometimes losing temper.

00:45:43.052 --> 00:45:45.981
Doesn’t matter that’s their habit.

00:45:45.981 --> 00:45:49.451
So you shouldn’t immediately become the
same type.

00:45:49.451 --> 00:46:03.731
But you can little bit in a womanly way try
to put your sweet device of smiling it or

00:46:03.731 --> 00:46:09.624
laughing it out or little bit [showing you
nice?] somehow.

00:46:09.794 --> 00:46:11.815
But not to make it serious.

00:46:11.815 --> 00:46:13.264
It’s very important.

00:46:13.264 --> 00:46:15.645
So how to handle the men.

00:46:15.645 --> 00:46:21.475
Especially your husbands is an art and that
art you will achieve gradually when you start

00:46:21.475 --> 00:46:22.535
seeing.

00:46:22.535 --> 00:46:28.125
But if you start finding faults with the men
and start saying you can’t do this, you

00:46:28.125 --> 00:46:34.634
can’t do this, you don’t know how to drive
or how to do this, or this things.

00:46:34.634 --> 00:46:36.434
Then you are finished.

00:46:36.434 --> 00:46:38.434
You must say you are the best driver.

00:46:38.434 --> 00:46:40.535
You are the best.

00:46:40.535 --> 00:46:43.929
That’s the way you have to deal with him.

00:46:43.929 --> 00:46:44.929
But not that you are befooling them.

00:46:44.929 --> 00:46:47.485
Because you say this because you love.

00:46:47.485 --> 00:46:51.130
And love is the basis between you and him.

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.210
Nothing else.

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:53.210
Not Money.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:56.179
Not what you have got for him or he has brought
for you.

00:46:56.179 --> 00:46:57.389
Nothing of that.

00:46:57.389 --> 00:46:59.880
All these things are not materialistic.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.160
They have nothing to do with matter.

00:47:03.219 --> 00:47:11.018
Love is something which you can express also
through matter, sometimes by giving some nice

00:47:11.249 --> 00:47:14.070
presents or nice food or something.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:16.100
But the most important thing is your heart.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.759
You should not cheat.

00:47:17.759 --> 00:47:24.099
In anyway you should not be hypocritical,
and you should not try to do something that

00:47:24.099 --> 00:47:25.809
is not pure.

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:33.749
So in Sahaja Yoga, the purpose of these marriages
is to have you connected internationally.

00:47:33.749 --> 00:47:40.399
So you all transcend all the barriers of your
nationality, the barriers of our racialism,

00:47:40.399 --> 00:47:47.940
barriers of caste, barriers of so much materialism.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.899
So you should not compare your husband with
anyone.

00:47:49.899 --> 00:47:53.990
He is Your husband and you shouldn’t expect
too much from him.

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:58.689
He’s not given me this, he has not done
that for me, he’s like this.

00:47:58.959 --> 00:48:00.760
This is not necessary.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.989
You must always think what I have done for
him.

00:48:04.989 --> 00:48:08.049
Also what’s wrong with me?

00:48:08.049 --> 00:48:13.749
Now some people, especially in the west it’s
very common, that after marriage they think

00:48:13.749 --> 00:48:17.230
that they have to work out marriages, no working
out.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:22.710
You see like they think that as you work out
your kitchen or work out your things.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:23.840
It’s not like this.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.380
Spontaneously between the two human beings
who are realised souls.

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:35.080
It is not that you are working out anything,
but spontaneously you are going to enjoy,

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.080
spontaneously.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:43.210
Now if you become extremely critical and try
to show you are very brilliant and this.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.870
It’s not going to work.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:46.610
To be humble.

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:48.300
Keep quiet.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.930
Those who are really intelligent always keep
quiet and watch things.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:55.930
But those who are not, are bumptious.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:49:03.500
The more you are in Sahaja Yoga, the more
you will be respected by him and by everybody.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:07.170
Apart from that, there are so many saints
who want to be born.

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:12.770
Once you have very happy married life among
yourselves, those saints will be born to you,

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:16.100
and it will be such a blessing and joy for
you.

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:23.360
So try to understand not to boss your husband
or try to put him right or do things and in

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.360
a very.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:31.640
I have seen some ladies who are extremely
tense, very tense type.

00:49:31.977 --> 00:49:33.820
They can never give joy.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.440
They are themselves not in joy, how can they
give joy, are themselves not in joy.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.040
So the tension should not be there.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.710
At all of any kind.

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:41.790
Be relaxed.

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:49.270
You are the other side of SahajaYoga, which
gives peace, joy, nourishment and also complete

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:51.590
tranquillity.

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:55.250
In the family you are responsible for tranquillity.

00:49:55.250 --> 00:50:00.070
Even if husband is angry, children are fighting,
if the mother is tranquil you can control

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.450
all the situation.

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:08.280
So the situation has to be controlled in a
way that you make life happy for everyone.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:15.470
Sometimes women feel very angry when I tell
them that first feed your children, your husband

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:17.960
and then you eat yourself.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.720
Because that is the job of a woman.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:25.440
Like a man should go, earn living, do what
he wants to do, job and all that.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:31.250
But the woman has to really look after the
husband, look after the family, look after

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:32.250
everything.

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:37.850
Also you will find our Indian husbands not
so good, as far as gardening is concerned,

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:48.414
or you can say, they don’t know how to mend
anything like cars or your plumbing, they

00:50:48.434 --> 00:50:49.884
don’t know.

00:50:49.914 --> 00:50:52.114
So doesn’t matter, take it easy.

00:50:52.124 --> 00:50:55.284
Gradually they'll become and they'll learn and they'll do it.

00:50:55.954 --> 00:50:57.794
But don’t become impatient with them.

00:50:57.794 --> 00:51:00.154
Just make fun of it, you see, just make fun.

00:51:00.154 --> 00:51:07.054
That the best way to manage it and that don’t
expect too much, that they will do this nicely.

00:51:07.054 --> 00:51:12.154
Sometimes they cannot clean the utensils properly,
they don’t know how to do it.

00:51:12.154 --> 00:51:13.154
So alright.

00:51:13.154 --> 00:51:16.684
Just make fun of it and just enjoy it because
they have [unclear].

00:51:16.684 --> 00:51:21.534
You see in England or America I have seen
anywhere, they have no servants at all.

00:51:21.534 --> 00:51:25.954
While we have servants here so all these boys
are spoiled by the servants.

00:51:25.954 --> 00:51:31.124
So they are absolutely good for nothing as
far as these things are concerned.

00:51:31.124 --> 00:51:37.274
But if you just try to teach them and help
them, they will definitely go all out to do

00:51:37.274 --> 00:51:38.274
it.

00:51:38.274 --> 00:51:42.484
So the only thing you have to do is to love
them with a clear heart.

00:51:42.484 --> 00:51:48.144
And all the time forgive and let them know
that that she is the only one I have in the

00:51:48.144 --> 00:51:53.054
whole world apart from the Holy Mother.

00:51:53.054 --> 00:52:01.023
Of course, I’m not against divorce, but
I’m not for it.

00:52:01.353 --> 00:52:04.433
In the sense that I don’t like people when
they divorce.

00:52:04.433 --> 00:52:10.633
But when things are impossible and difficult
and one has to go in for such a thing, doesn’t

00:52:10.633 --> 00:52:11.633
matter.

00:52:11.633 --> 00:52:12.633
Sometimes one has to do it.

00:52:12.633 --> 00:52:14.303
But it should be very rare.

00:52:14.303 --> 00:52:17.733
One should not think of a divorce at all.

00:52:17.733 --> 00:52:21.633
People think of divorce in the west mostly
because of the laws, because the wife gets

00:52:21.633 --> 00:52:23.503
the money or the husband gets the money.

00:52:23.503 --> 00:52:28.253
But in SahajaYoga if you are marrying, all
these things even if you are divorced, I will

00:52:28.253 --> 00:52:29.763
not support.

00:52:29.763 --> 00:52:35.003
Moreover, another thing is that the wives
should not take money from the husband and

00:52:35.003 --> 00:52:37.493
send it to her relations.

00:52:37.493 --> 00:52:38.493
Never.

00:52:38.493 --> 00:52:47.462
It’s a very very wrong thing, is to support
your family through the money of their husband

00:52:47.462 --> 00:52:48.462
Absolutely not allowed.

00:52:48.462 --> 00:52:49.552
That should not be done.

00:52:49.552 --> 00:52:54.802
They.., you should not put the pressure of
your family on your husband.

00:52:54.802 --> 00:53:00.773
You see there has to be a clear cut understanding
for all of you.

00:53:00.773 --> 00:53:06.526
That you will not take.you must keep your
self respect.

00:53:08.626 --> 00:53:10.756
Don’t ask for anything.

00:53:10.756 --> 00:53:13.525
If he gives you anything [unclear] well and
good.

00:53:13.525 --> 00:53:15.136
But don’t ask, don’t demand.

00:53:15.136 --> 00:53:17.556
That means you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:53:17.556 --> 00:53:21.225
If you are a satisfied soul why should you
ask for anything?

00:53:21.225 --> 00:53:25.006
Or somebody gets something, she has got this,
she has …Nothing of that kind.

00:53:24.996 --> 00:53:32.582
You be satisfied and this is how some girls
nag the husbands very much.

00:53:32.712 --> 00:53:37.501
Most important thing is that you should not
talk about your past, at all.

00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:38.501
Because past is finished.

00:53:38.501 --> 00:53:39.501
Now you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:39.501 --> 00:53:42.611
You are all realised souls.

00:53:42.611 --> 00:53:45.282
So you don’t have to say a word about your
past.

00:53:45.282 --> 00:53:51.412
Even if husband starts talking you just stop,
and tell him we are to live in the present.

00:53:51.412 --> 00:53:53.421
Don’t tell us about your past.

00:53:53.421 --> 00:53:57.941
I don’t know why people think that they
will look more attractive if they talk about

00:53:57.941 --> 00:54:00.101
all the past nonsense they did.

00:54:00.101 --> 00:54:02.371
Or say that my mother was so bad.

00:54:02.371 --> 00:54:05.842
All psychological nonsense.

00:54:05.842 --> 00:54:11.671
Not to put your parents into jeopardy by saying
that they are very bad, they are no good.

00:54:11.671 --> 00:54:12.671
This, that..

00:54:12.671 --> 00:54:21.631
Just forget the past and live in the present
because in the present resides the reality

00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:26.601
and the reality is the ocean of joy.

00:54:26.601 --> 00:54:29.172
You should not nag him for anything.

00:54:29.172 --> 00:54:31.981
Supposing he didn’t like something, you
shouldn’t do it.

00:54:31.981 --> 00:54:36.931
Whatever he doesn’t like, small things,
you know like, I was married in a family which

00:54:36.931 --> 00:54:40.291
was culturally very different, very different.

00:54:40.291 --> 00:54:42.172
And they don’t wear flowers.

00:54:42.172 --> 00:54:47.941
You see, and in India all the married ladies,
I mean down south, I’m saying in my community,

00:54:47.941 --> 00:54:54.441
all wear garlands around their buns and [unclear].

00:54:54.441 --> 00:54:56.191
Always wear.

00:54:56.191 --> 00:54:57.772
My husband said no better not do it.

00:54:57.772 --> 00:55:04.231
Because you know here in our community only
the bad women wear that to attract man.

00:55:04.231 --> 00:55:07.611
Since that day I have never worn it.

00:55:07.611 --> 00:55:10.081
Doesn’t matter, not important.

00:55:12.801 --> 00:55:18.761
So, also you must understand now you have
to take to the style of life of your husband.

00:55:18.761 --> 00:55:22.591
He is fond of entertaining, look after that.

00:55:22.591 --> 00:55:24.991
Women should be entertaining, they should
look after.

00:55:24.991 --> 00:55:29.160
They should not mind if somebody comes to
stay with them or lives with them.

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.581
They should not try to show.

00:55:30.581 --> 00:55:35.450
On the contrary they should be happy they
are able to look after someone who is a Sahaja

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:36.450
Yogi.

00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:41.001
So, for the Sahaja Yogis, you must keep always
your heart open, your house open.

00:55:41.001 --> 00:55:46.391
There are so many things which I would like
to tell you but in this short time, I have

00:55:46.391 --> 00:55:54.871
to just say that it is the responsibility
of the women to make their marriages happy.

00:55:54.871 --> 00:56:03.521
Depends on their intelligence and on their
dedication to Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:03.521 --> 00:56:06.391
It’s your responsibility.

00:56:06.391 --> 00:56:15.354
And if you see in a wider sense the responsibility
of making a good society is that of a woman.

00:56:15.624 --> 00:56:17.244
Even if she has to suffer she can.

00:56:17.244 --> 00:56:18.494
She is like this mother Earth.

00:56:18.494 --> 00:56:21.023
She can suffer anything She never feels she
suffers.

00:56:21.023 --> 00:56:22.283
She is so great.

00:56:22.283 --> 00:56:24.093
You are Shaktis.

00:56:24.093 --> 00:56:28.364
So as Shaktis if you have to suffer, you don’t
mind.

00:56:28.364 --> 00:56:36.513
And what you have to feel is that we are responsible
for making our Sahaja Yoga society a perfect

00:56:36.513 --> 00:56:37.513
society.

00:56:37.513 --> 00:56:41.650
That’s our responsibility.

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:52.283
All your greed, all your ambitions, everything
should be directed towards making a very very

00:56:52.379 --> 00:56:53.679
happy married life.

00:56:55.029 --> 00:57:11.879
I wish, I wish all, all of you, a very happy
and prosperous married life.
