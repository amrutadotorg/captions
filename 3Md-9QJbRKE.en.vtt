00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:32.600
When they asked Me what puja we should have in Vancouver,
I had heard about this ashram that it is placed

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:53.180
in very beautiful surroundings of nature and,
as nature is being created by the power of

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:09.440
Saraswati, I thought best would be to have
the Puja of Saraswati here. Another thing

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:19.880
is that when people live in nature, they become
extremely creative, their delicate feelings

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:31.240
are preserved and they are never in a rush;
or they are not what we can call too much

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:41.430
modernized, because nature soothes them down.
So also the creativity of Saraswati adds to

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:53.180
artist, and I knew that there must have been
many artist in this country created since

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.190
long.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:07.190
The Canada as such I feel is the Hamsa Chakra
of the Vishuddhi, but the power of Saraswati

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:31.250
becomes Mahasaraswati when it is manifested
by the Mahabrahmadeva which is called as Hiranyagarbha.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:44.670
For that She has to cross through the Hamsa.
She crosses through Hamsa and becomes the

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:53.170
Vishnumaya Shakti. I mean She is the Vishnumaya
Shakti. So Saraswati becomes the Vishnumaya.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:08.510
She crosses at two points - one at Hamsa and
another at Vishuddhi - so She is the Sister

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:19.630
of Shri Krishna. So Saraswati was born as
the Sister of Shri Krishna, and when Krishna's

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:32.370
mama name whose was, uncle was Kamsa, he came
to kill Her, She just rose into the sky and

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:43.890
became the lightning, and She declared the
coming of Shri Krishna, that He is already

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.060
there existing.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:59.060
So the relationship between Shri Krishna and
Vishnumaya is that of a brother and a sister,

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:09.380
and surprisingly the other day we celebrated
the Rakhi Bandhan, Raksha Bandhan, which is

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:18.780
the same thing as the brothers/sisters relationship.
So now here we are celebrating actually the

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:25.780
Deity which is the Sister of Shri Krishna.
Later on She was born as Draupadi, and that's

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:34.580
why Shri Krishna went to save Her chastity,
because is the brother only who is concerned

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:40.460
about the chastity and the name of the sister.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:47.460
So this is what yesterday happened that is
the Saraswati Puja, so Vishnumaya, Herself,

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:58.210
yesterday sixteen times thundered here; and
I didn't tell anybody what was happening,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:06.880
but I knew She would do that. And apart from
that, She has also threatened Washington.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:14.800
That's a good thing because Washington has
to be awakened. Now these are very, very subtle

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:21.800
things and very subtle relations, and only
I can tell these things because I know them,

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:30.820
that these relations exist. So I was not surprised
that She was there, but exactly sixteen hundred

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:39.380
times She passed it, this part of Vancouver,
is to show that the time has come for you

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:51.730
to understand that Sahaja Yoga is so important,
and if we do not assert ourselves fully to

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:02.940
Sahaja Yoga, Vishnumaya is going to take another
form which may burn all your forest, may burn

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:10.610
everything. Now you must know that lightning
represents all the five elements in it - it

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:21.570
has sound, it has light, it is in the ether,
it acts in the ether. Also it has got what

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:28.960
you called the water in it, and when the water
goes into friction, which is the Mother earth,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.930
so all these things act through Her.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:44.930
So this Vishnumaya yesterday showed us that
"I'm here now. Please worship Me." And so

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:53.180
far we have never worshiped Saraswati, and
Brahmadeva is not worshiped anywhere because

00:14:53.180 --> 00:15:00.180
He created this world, He created all this
woods and all these things and they created

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:09.270
all the seas and all the lands, all the stars,
universes after universes. But we are not

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:19.960
to worship like we worship this tree or that
tree. We are not to worship anything of that

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:26.960
kind, only thing whatever is created by Mother
Earth like swayambus, that's only we worship.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:33.490
And that, too, we worship now in a way that
is an abstract way, because wherever they

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:39.490
have appeared people are doing commercial
religion, so we don't go to this places also

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.340
as Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:48.690
So you can understand why all these things
happened unexpectedly yesterday after My coming,

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:54.850
that there was such a light of lighting which
never happened before and people were surprised.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:16:01.850
So is the Krishna's Sister who is a much more
dynamic and [Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi]

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:28.710
much more fiery personality - much, much more
fiery personality. Shri Krishna's essence

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:35.710
is that He is sweetness. Madhuria is His capacity
and Radha is the Allahda Dayini Shakti, means

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:50.400
the One which gives you that joy which creates
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi], raises

00:16:53.350 --> 00:17:00.350
your hair with joy - so, but in Sanskrit it
is pulakit, pulakita is the word.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:11.130
So this beauty of Shri Krishna which is sweetness,
the leela, creating beautiful feelings of

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:27.660
oneness of communication - all that is in
Shri Krishna. But She's the One Who warns,

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:35.420
and that is how the warning came. And She's
a very fiery personality which warns everyone.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:42.540
So on one way She has proved My coming here,
that I'm here. Perhaps maybe to the people

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:48.510
who are aboriginals they might understand
that this is what was prophesied and that

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:55.510
has happened, and also that you people have
to realize it's a warning that you cannot

00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:02.610
just allow Sahaja Yoga to drift in such a
manner that it takes its own course and works

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.050
out, and you are just by the way there.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:13.250
So this is a warning of Shri Krishna's Sister,
Vishnumaya, which is Saraswati Herself, and

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:17.930
that is what today we are going to worship
Her. Only the Sahaja Yogis, those who are

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:24.930
enlightened people, can worship Mahasaraswati.
Otherwise people can only worship Saraswati

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:32.300
because with worship of Saraswati you can
read books, you can create dances, music,

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:44.050
for the amusement of human beings, but actually
the Saraswati Puja is meant for people of

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:52.510
ordinary awareness, means ordinary or normal
human awareness. But for Sahaja Yogis, it

00:18:55.170 --> 00:19:01.920
is the Mahasaraswati which is to be worshiped.
As I have told you this Mahasaraswati becomes

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:08.920
the Vishnumaya, and She is Vishnumaya so you
have to be person that you should, yourself

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:19.730
should inform people like the Vishnumaya does
what Sahaja Yoga is with your fiery talks,

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:27.810
with things of exciting them, telling them
what are you up to. But what I have seen is

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:34.810
that mostly when people speak they try to
be very gentle and sweet like Shri Krishna.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:41.380
We tried that in America, that it might work
with Americans, but it did not. They like

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:48.380
people like say that Graham fellow or somebody
like that who talks in a fiery way. And I

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:54.680
think this is what we have to learn from yesterday's
experience: that you need really some fiery

00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:01.680
speakers and fiery people because they are
not at all sensitive to normal sensations.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:10.720
You see they, all their sensations are dead
I think they have become numb, and you have

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:17.820
to give them some shocks. They like shocks,
you see. Newspaper have to give them shocks,

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.750
any event that is shocking - that can only
attract their attention. Even the music has

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:28.790
to be so much that it should break the rocks.
It should be such music that will just break

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:34.910
their heads. So they have become really rocky
people, and you have to understand that their

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:41.420
rockiness can only be shattered by Vishnumaya.
And that's why this puja that we have today

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:48.420
in Vancouver has a very great significance
- not only for Canada, but also for America.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:55.860
Americans are taking for granted whatever
diseases coming today, whatever drugs they

00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:03.170
are taking, whatever destruction they're doing
to themselves is still not in their understanding.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.110
They don't understand what they're doing to
themselves, how they're destroying themselves,

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:14.890
how such a precious human life they're wasting
just for their own whim and for their so-called

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:15.660
freedom.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:22.660
So it is extremely, extremely important that
you should try to tell them in a fiery way,

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:28.410
"What are you doing? Why are you deceiving
yourself? Why don't you understand this is

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:33.540
wrong? At least for the progeny, you tell
them that 'We did this wrong, but you should

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.980
not do it.'"

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:41.980
All this kind of talk has to be there and
people have to get ready for such great speeches

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:49.850
and things, but to say that people won't like
it, I think is the other way around, unless

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.920
and until you frighten them they're not going
to be with you.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:01.600
So you have to tell and warn them and that's
what the Vishnumaya yesterday has suggested

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.330
that now take to a new style of strategy and
talk to people in a way that whenever you

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:11.580
are doing - say you are doing a course, at
the end of the course you have to say that

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:17.100
"Now, you see, Sahaja Yoga is not only doing
the course, but it's for your well being,

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.850
for your benevolence. And you have to go further
with it and you have to grow. Now don't leave

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:26.190
it half way. It's not like just sprouting
in the seed, but it has to become the tree

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.110
otherwise nobody can be helped."

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:36.110
So you see just tell them they - all the dangers
of not being properly brought up or mature

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:44.790
in Sahaja Yoga. It has to be told because
all this lovey-dovey business doesn't help

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:50.640
in America, I've seen that. You need really
fiery people because recently I was listening

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:56.850
to a speech of this Billy Graham, and I said,
"It's such an empty-headed fellow talks through

00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:03.450
his hat," but still people were so impressed.
And there was another one now I think he is

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:10.450
behind jail. I don't know his name, some funny
man. So I saw him also, I was surprised he

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:17.730
was just talking something empty, like empty
shell and people were all mad after him - thousands

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.500
standing, singing, doing this, doing that.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.950
So one has to understand that these people
require shocks, and they're to be shocked

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:30.990
and they're to be told that "This is going
to happen." There's one other organisation

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:37.990
which has gone into a kind of a shocking system
is the [Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi]

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:53.060
Brahma Kumari, Brahma Kumari, you see this
Brahma Kumaris have become like lightnings

00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:00.940
and they tell people - now they don't tell
that, "You are destroyed," what they tell,

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:05.570
"This world is going to be destroyed, everything
is going to be destroyed and you know you

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.730
are not prepared for it, what's going to happen?"

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.600
Same thing Jehovah Witness is doing, the same
thing. They are saying, "This world is going

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:19.600
to be destroyed, and we are all going to be
destroyed; so we should be prepared and we

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:26.760
should take to God." But this is not reality.
Despite that people are after that. You have

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:35.870
to tell them the reality that "Not only that
you're destroying yourself, but you're destroying

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:44.160
the future." People are already talking that
most of the people in America will be destroyed.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:50.160
Now it comes from various reasons. We can
say that there are no traditions and things

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.040
- that's not the point, that's not the main
point. One of the main points is that they

00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:01.040
destroyed so many people when they came and
settle down in this country. That's one point.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:08.040
Now the bhoots of those people who died are
still hanging around, and they want to see

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:15.600
that they destroy Americans as far as possible.
The amount of witchcraft, the amount of all

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:22.600
negative techniques that are working in America,
they're working nowhere. The gurus had to

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:29.240
get out of the all the countries, but they're
still very nicely settle in America. The reason

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:35.440
is these bhoots are giving them ideas. It's
not only that they need shocks, but also these

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:41.520
bhoots give them this perverted ideas of destruction,
so they go for their destruction.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:48.520
Now the bhootish ideas are such that you see
a person coming out of a pub, falls down.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:54.550
And bhootish idea is that "What's the harm?
You also try, you will never fall. You go

00:25:54.550 --> 00:26:00.720
in, nothing will happen to you. You're perfectly
all right. After all, doesn't matter."

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.970
Or else you tell them that "This is wrong.
We should not do."

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:12.640
"All right, so we are bad. So what?" These
are all bhootish ideas. These are not human

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.660
ideas to talk like this or to say like that.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:22.620
So to all these people, you see, the only
thing that is going to bring round is the

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:28.910
Vishnumaya Shakti, nothing else. I now realize
that it's only through Vishnumaya people can

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:35.910
be cured. So Vishnumaya Itself now has gone
off to sleep, thanks to Christian religion,

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:42.630
Catholic religion and also Hinduism, because
in Hinduism also there is a idea of sin - that

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:47.390
you have sinned this, you have done that sin.
So give so much money to the Brahmin, so you'll

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:52.980
be saved. I mean every religion has this nonsense.
But this Vishnumaya Shakti, which is being

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:58.870
absolutely subdued and is sleeping in human
beings, if you can raise It and tell people

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:05.870
to get up out of this slumber, this laziness,
by involving them very much in a bigger way,

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:14.680
by telling them that we are for peace, peace
of the world. We are for the emancipation

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:21.680
of the humanity, we are for saving people
from blunders and from their destruction.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:29.200
If you take a bigger platform and talk about
those things, then it will be helped. For

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:36.510
example, now it's a very good thing that I
was with Mahatma Gandhi, and people have got

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:43.110
great respect for Mahatma Gandhi. Of course
and Mahatma Gandhi was very much impressed

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:50.030
about Me no doubt. Even when I was a child,
he used to consult Me, and the proof of that

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:57.030
is that in his bhajans he has put the serial
of the bhajans in different ways, starting

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:06.930
from the heart talking about the Atma and
then he's starting from the Mooladhara upward

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:15.230
like that. So I mean that's one of the proofs
that he must have consulted Me. But whatever

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:23.890
it is, you have - can use him also that Shri
Mataji is doing what Mahatma Gandhi said.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:30.720
He has talked about sarva dharma savanatma
means all the religions are treated with same

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.360
respect and same understanding.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.460
Once you start talking like that, you see,
then people will understand that it has some

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:42.630
noble heritage behind it, because everybody
wants to know from what book I've learnt.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:47.120
I have never learnt from any book, that you
know very well. But you can say that "She

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.950
is the One Who was with him" and that "He
was very much impressed by Her," and the same

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:57.640
ideas of peace and non violence and all that.
"These are the same techniques and methods

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.880
She wants to use." That's a fact, no doubt,
but Mahatma Gandhi was a very fiery speaker.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:10.350
All people who followed him were very fiery.
They were not just "All right, come along,

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:15.730
have a cup of tea" and this kind of thing
is not going to work out.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:22.730
So Americans need challenge, and they need
really a fiery person to blast them. So now

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:30.640
if you go on this way - like the other day
when we had a program in New York and there

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:37.640
were so many black people and so many Chinese,
and then there were so many Indians and very

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.900
few were whites.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.970
So whites came and say, "Oh, nothing has happened
to me, you know."

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.510
So then what you have to do, "Nothing is happened?"

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.550
"Yes, that's what."

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:55.310
"Must be something wrong with you, or must
be you must have committed some sins or something."

00:29:55.310 --> 00:30:02.310
So then they get a shock. "Oh, it's something
surprising you haven't got it. Oh it's very

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.750
wrong, something wrong with you. You should
get it. Try to get it, you know, it's very

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:13.750
wrong. I hope you don't have cancer." [laughter]
Or you can ask, "Are you suffering from AIDS?"

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:19.920
"No, no, no."

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.100
"Then what are you suffering from? How is
it you didn't get it? You see this black man

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:29.340
got it, this Chinese has got it. Why don't
you get it? You are a white skin man, you

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:36.340
should get it first."

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:41.710
Then things will work out. I have been thinking
about it, why these Americans are so dull,

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:47.100
because you see they are on the whole very
dull people, extremely dull. Because this

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.700
kind of a rock music, you see, if you play
before anyone people would run away. "What

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:57.680
is this going on?" But the way they like this
rap music yesterday, they wanted Me to listen.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.680
The heart started beating the other way around.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.110
I said, "What's happening?" And the whole
thing started shaking. I sat on a bench and

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:11.110
the whole bench was shaking. There, who sat
with Me was, he was there and also Karan was

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:18.570
there and we found that he - Karan and everybody
was jumping like that, on - it was like a

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.940
earthquake going on.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:29.900
So this is what it is, that you see these
people are very, very dull people and numbed

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:36.650
out and they're numbed out because of their
so call freedom. It's like you go and ask

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:42.010
a bull, "Come and hit me," sort of thing,
you see. They have gone out of the way to

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:49.010
numb themselves completely; and this numbness
may be alcohol, may be drugs, may be woman,

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.350
may be marrying so many times. If you marry
one time it's sufficient. If you marry five

00:31:54.350 --> 00:32:00.660
times, I mean you become - I don't know what,
like a - I don't know if there's any animal

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:07.660
like that. But something you become absolutely
numb to things, you see. Because first of

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:15.280
all marrying one wife, then you have attachments
with her, you have children and you - I mean

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:21.390
after all it's so much to do with your wife
and then suddenly you divorce and you don't

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:24.880
feel anything, you don't feel it.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:31.780
It's great numbness and if you tell them,
"Yes I know, I know, I know." They know but

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:36.630
they don't feel. They don't feel that they're
doing anything wrong, they don't feel they

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:43.630
have done anything absurd and they don't suffer.
Any other person would suffer. Yes, he has

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:51.640
divorced his wife and it becomes really a
person quite lost, should be normally. But

00:32:53.010 --> 00:33:00.010
here what you find very nicely boasting, "You
know, I have divorced my two wives, and this

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:08.630
third one is coming up. You can meet her."
So that there's no shame about it, no shame,

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:13.510
no feelings, nothing. I mean you married a
woman, you lived with her, she was your wife

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:18.530
and you have no feelings for her. Your own
children also they have no feelings at all,

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.890
no feelings. Of course they're not like English,
where the English people kill their children,

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:28.080
so that's not so bad. But here I've heard
also they kill their husband, wife, kills

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:33.230
each other and all that. And for what? For
love. When they do not have love for one husband,

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:37.560
how are they going to have love for another
husband? I can't understand. Love is a quality

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.610
of heart.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:44.970
So this is what it is - if you see the whole
character is numbed out because they don't

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:49.790
behave like human beings. They behave like
- I don't know, again I say I don't know like

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:56.400
who because there's no comparison whatsoever.
So it is not that only in America people are

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:02.510
like that, it is all over. But in America
it is too much, too much of it, and all such

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:09.510
things rise from America. All such funny notions
rise from America, and everybody takes them

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:17.100
because they know how to advertise, they know
how to make it very, very popular.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:27.760
Once I was travelling by a ship and a pilot
came over the ship, and he was talking to

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.920
Me and he told Me that his brother is a very
nasty devil.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.320
I said, "What happened?"

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:42.240
So he said that he got hold of these four
boys who were Beatles, and he became their

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:49.240
manager. And he started this music and got
some women, got them drunk, put them on the

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:57.180
drugs. And the first music when they had that
music, these girls started screaming, shouting,

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:03.250
going mad. And it become popular. Normally
the reaction would be that, "Ba, it's such

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:08.340
a thing that when the music starts the girls
go mad, so don't go to such a music." On the

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:13.460
contrary, so many started coming. How do you
explain this kind of a reaction? The more

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:20.460
they shout, the more they scream, according
to them it's something. Means behind it is

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:28.330
one thing that it has touched them somehow;
otherwise, why will they scream? Means such

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.570
dumb people are been touched by something
is something great and all of us should go.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:39.910
We are also dumb, so we should attend to it.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:46.910
Now you may ask Me that "Mother how this dumbness
has come into people and this?" Is as simple

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:53.870
as that as I told you, that they've used their
freedom to such an extent, their attention

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:59.610
to such a wasteful pursuits, that they have
become really numb. Their attention doesn't

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:06.610
feel anything. Attention when you put it out
it reacts, and it comes back to you as something.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:12.510
But if you all the time go on bombarding outside
your attention, this some bombardment from

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:16.870
outside just finishes all your sensitivity.
There's no feeling, there's no attachment,

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:23.870
there is no, no recording of anything that
is happening. So for that I think Vishnumaya

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:35.860
is needed, and that's why She's placed on
the left side because Vishnumaya is the One

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:41.750
in charge of people who have become absolutely
feelingless. That's why She's there to give

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:43.000
you the feeling.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.960
So on the left side when She shines She gives
you the feelings, and people start understanding.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:55.960
So now the only thing that they have is a
kind of a mental idea that they're guilty,

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:02.730
that's all. This is just mental. If it is
mental idea, "Oh, I'm guilty," then you are

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:09.410
not going to feel it. I mean if you are, say
that you are mad, when you're not mad if anybody

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:14.770
calls you mad you are not going to feel it.
It's like this. So they don't feel it at all

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:20.700
because it is all mentally accepted thing
and they have become numb, "Now nobody can

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.640
harm you, so what's wrong?" sort of an attitude.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:31.640
I would now ask you people to go all out and
become fiery, write in newspapers and say

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:38.580
what's happening and how things are. I'm writing
a book like that now. It's called as Meta

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:44.050
Modernism, and as far as I could be fiery
I'm going to be there to tell them what's

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:51.050
wrong with them. And they should see to it
that this all wrong. No use trying to call

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:57.800
it something great. Like now AIDS have come
up. I thought with AIDS, they will be awakened.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:03.050
So now the AIDS have become a martyrdom, now
yuppies came up.

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.970
I said, "The yuppies will suffer from a disease."

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:10.260
So now they said, "No, no, no, no. It's very
nice to be yuppies. After all you see they

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:14.500
are another heroes who died for their yuppism."

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:21.500
Like you see every stupidity is made into
a something kind of a very glorifying thing,

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:29.350
so just - and people accept it. That's the
best part of it - they accept it. So it is

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:34.620
important for you to be fiery, and to show
them in that light what they are. They have

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:41.340
to be shown. It's not just a little light
of the Spirit will show them much, but it's

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:48.340
the real dazzling, burning light of a lightening.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:57.170
So today's puja is going to be especially
for you all to develop that creativity of

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:04.860
talking, behaving in every way in a fiery
way. That is going to put them right, nothing

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:13.130
else. In creative work also when we create
something or we sing something and all that,

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:20.320
if you go on singing say in our Indian style,
some music which is (Indian word) very slow

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:28.300
talas, that won't go. They like somebody like
Ravi Shankar who just goes on mixing up notes

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:35.300
and just goes on playing something which is
very, very unscientific according to Indians

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:41.080
and is not at all entertaining. It doesn't
open your heart and something like that. But

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:48.080
that is the thing that appeals to them, to
go into a big sort of a rock and roll sort

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:53.220
- make it, sitar, into rock and roll, even
worse than that. I don't know the new latest

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.200
one, I don't know what it is.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:01.110
So the second thing is that you can see how
they try to shock people. Also they try to

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:06.240
shock people, because they know that they
are also like us. Like you go in the market

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:13.240
you find somebody, his pant is - not pant
even, half pant - is all torn at wrong places,

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:21.240
and it is just to shock people. They are supposed
to hear - at least they are supposed to, in

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:27.870
America it is supposed to be you have to dress
up decently. You should not be indecently

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:33.600
dressed. That's what they want, but what you
find whatever chance they can get to dress

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:39.300
up in a way that you'll be shocked, they would
like to do. Like they have only one part of

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:45.340
the hair as white. I mean anything, anything
is possible just to shock others, shock others

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:51.730
and attract the attention. And what do you
get? Nothing. You spend so much money to attract

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:55.700
the attention of others, but what do you get?
That attention doesn't give you anything,

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.530
doesn't pay you anything, doesn't compensate.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:04.900
So it's such a joyless pursuit they get it.
All these things spoiled their attention which

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:11.900
destroys to this extent that they're feelingless
people. They have no feelings left. And then

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:19.220
the worse thing that has happened is they
become absolutely money-orientated. So the

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:27.630
money is another side of Saraswati. Saraswati
is different from Lakshmi, so the Lakshmi

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:41.420
and the Saraswati never go hand in hand. This
is the reason why when they get after Lakshmi,

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:49.710
run after money too much, they get shocks.
Because there's a - suddenly you find stock

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:55.050
exchange has fallen, there's a recession,
this business is gone, somebody who's very

00:41:55.050 --> 00:42:02.050
rich suddenly becomes a poor man. Is all the
work, this is all the work of the Saraswati.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:11.290
And if somebody is too much in Saraswati - reads
too many books, is an artist who is very ambitious,

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:21.490
who tries to outshine other artist and all
that - such a person also gets back a reward

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:28.630
from Lakshmi that his things never sell, he
never gets money, he starves, all sorts of

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:29.020
thing.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:36.020
So these two things are in balance only in
Hamsa, or we can say they are in balance when

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:43.480
you are Sahaja Yogi. So this has to be achieved
and is to be put together in balance that

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:52.890
you have the blessings of the Saraswati as
well as that of Lakshmi. But it crosses only

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:59.730
at the Hamsa point and at the Vishuddhi point.
So what do we have to do to bring the balance

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:06.730
is that whatever we are earning, whatever
we are doing, we should not be in mediocre

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:15.190
way. We should try to do it in a dynamic way,
in a fiery way. These two things should be

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:24.040
combined at the Vishuddhi level. So now, supposing
you are going to give a lecture about Sahaja

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:34.080
Yoga in a fiery way, and if you wear a dress
that you look like a hippie or somebody coming

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:39.590
out of a jail, nobody is going to take you
seriously. But if you're properly dressed

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:46.170
and you look respectable and presentation
is good, and then you give fiery speech, everybody

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:53.170
is going to listen. So this principle of Lakshmi
Tattwa is to be used with the domination of

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.180
the Saraswati principle.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:06.180
Now another blessings of Saraswati is that
you can have knowledge of Sahaja Yoga. I've

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:15.730
seen many women especially in Sahaja Yoga,
they're Sahaja Yogis, their vibrations and

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:23.690
all that is there, but they do not know what
is Sahaja Yoga. They do not know what these

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:33.130
chakras are. They do not know that how these
vibrations go out. Now today's lecture is

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:39.860
quite a lecture quite complicated I would
say, if you see to it. You have to listen

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:44.710
to it at least four, five times to understand
it with the paper and a pencil. It's not an

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:49.240
easy thing because I'm telling you now it's
all right, it's quite entertaining, but behind

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:56.240
the entertainment there is a deep knowledge.
So I've not seen the Sahaja Yoginis mostly

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:04.200
sit down with a paper and pencil to know what
is Mother saying, what is the knowledge She's

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:12.230
giving us about the various things. To them
Sahaja Yoga means to be nice, to cook good

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:26.840
food and help the Sahaja Yogis, just as come
to the pujas and all that and finished, also.

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:34.360
So for them it is very important that they
should also know what is Sahaja Yoga. They

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:39.190
must listen to My lectures, sit down, study
it nicely and understand it.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:46.190
The other way around are the men. For them
it is to do all the outside work, go round,

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:53.500
see things and all that, But as far as relationships
are concerned, or as far as emotional side

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:04.600
are concerned, they're negligent. And that
is why Sahaja Yoga by men is different; Sahaja

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:10.770
Yoga by women is different. And in France
specially it has gone very far away from each

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:15.030
other. The women were on one side, man are
on other side. Imagine in Sahaja Yoga you

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:20.820
have such a nonsense as that, but then we
discover the person who was doing it and we

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:26.710
managed it, so it was settle down and now
things are better. But women must know about

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:32.730
Sahaja Yoga, but that doesn't mean that they
should fight with them, or think that they

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:39.730
also know what these men know. But it's very,
very common. I've seen that men and women

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:45.540
are having a different type of attitude towards
Sahaja Yoga. One is an extravert, another

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:51.240
is an introvert. But in Sahaja Yoga there
is no difference between a woman and a man

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:57.130
as far as knowing Sahaja Yoga is concerned.
I'm a woman Myself and I know so much, so

00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:00.920
why not the woman shouldn't know about what
is Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:07.450
So all the women who are here or all over
have to know what is Sahaja Yoga. After all,

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:14.450
look at Vishnumaya - She is a woman, is the
Power that works. Brahmadeva doesn't work.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.530
He's created all these things because He has
the Power of Saraswati, otherwise He could

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:25.250
not have created. So everything is done through
the Power and the Power is a women, but if

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:32.220
the Power doesn't know what is Sahaja Yoga,
how is She going to work it out? So the women,

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:37.110
though they have children, I know - they have
to look after the household, kitchen - but

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:43.940
it's such a pleasure, such a joy to read about
Sahaja Yoga, to understand it, to know it.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:50.270
Of course some of them do also read. I'm not
saying that they do not. But there are very,

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:53.980
very few and they are very sensible, very
sensible.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:48:00.980
So this is My understanding of today's happening
that in this natural surrounding, these natural

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:09.880
surrounding where we are blessed by the work
of Brahmadeva and Saraswati, and where we

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:17.810
can feel the capacity of these Deities, to
what extent They can create. The nature is

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:26.410
absolutely one with the Divine. Now see, as
soon as I came here the nature knew I'm there.

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:32.780
It just started acting by itself. I didn't
have to give them a lecture, they didn't have

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:38.240
to do a puja, nothing of the kind. They know
what I was doing. I went to Los Angeles, same

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:43.350
thing. Anywhere I go the nature knows what
is to be done, "Now Mother is in the town,

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:50.350
what should we do?" And they do it. So this
is the trouble, is that I have make you to

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:56.490
do all kinds of deliberations for human beings
that "All right, do this, do that, do that."

00:48:56.490 --> 00:49:01.960
But I would say that spontaneously it should
happen, because now we are one. Just like

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:08.070
the nature is one with Me, you are also one
with Me. And that should start happening when

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.820
you will really become absolutely drawn into Sahaja Yoga, surrendered into Sahaja Yoga

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:13.070
Now Saraswati is the Goddess of learning and
Mahasaraswati is the Goddess of knowledge,
you will really become absolutely drawn into Sahaja Yoga, surrendered into Sahaja Yoga

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:15.900
you will really become absolutely drawn into Sahaja Yoga, surrendered into Sahaja Yoga

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:21.160
then only it will happen. May God bless you.
