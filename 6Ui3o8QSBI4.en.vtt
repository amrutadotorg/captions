00:00:01.064 --> 00:00:06.914
You must put some heated butter
in the nose, all of you.

00:00:06.914 --> 00:00:08.444
Sahaja Yogi: Inside?

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:11.724
Shri Mataji: Inside, with a dropper, alright?

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:13.654
Heat butter and fill it up.

00:00:13.654 --> 00:00:19.064
And then, when it is slightly warm, not very
warm, absolutely slightly warm, then put it

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:24.164
in your nose, very important, because the-
I don’t know in this country, people, it’s

00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:30.174
a very simple thing to be done once in a while,
about say two or three days later or even

00:00:30.174 --> 00:00:32.024
every day you do, doesn’t matter.

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:38.654
It’s like putting cream on your hands, you
see, because the cold weather also chaps inside

00:00:38.654 --> 00:00:40.484
the lining of the nose.

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:48.804
And when you put this, it makes the nose smooth
and you don’t get troubles of it.

00:00:48.804 --> 00:00:49.924
It’s very simple.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:53.783
All of you should do, all the Sahaja Yogis
are supposed to do.

00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:57.904
There are so many things that a Sahaja Yogis
are supposed to do, one of them is this, that

00:00:57.904 --> 00:01:01.034
try to keep you Hamsa Chakra alright.

00:01:01.034 --> 00:01:04.894
By keeping your nose alright you are keeping
your Hamsa Chakra better.

00:01:04.894 --> 00:01:11.094
So better use this simple method of heating
some ghee, we call it.

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:17.624
You see, you can prepare it, heat the butter,
keep it in a bottle with a dropper, and heat

00:01:17.624 --> 00:01:25.804
it in the hot water and then put it in the
nose, just like that, in the night, before

00:01:25.804 --> 00:01:26.804
sleeping.

00:01:26.804 --> 00:01:28.164
Even in the ears, we must put olive oil.

00:01:28.164 --> 00:01:31.884
It’s very important.

00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:36.814
For the teeth also, you must take some salt,
put some olive oil and rub your gums.

00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:40.073
With that, you won’t have to go to the dentist
anymore.

00:01:40.073 --> 00:01:43.278
That’s the best, I’ve never been to a
dentist all my life, and I don’t want you

00:01:43.278 --> 00:01:45.804
to go to the dentist anymore.

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:53.104
So that’s a very good way of rubbing your
gums with vibrated salt and what you call

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:54.304
the olive oil.

00:01:54.304 --> 00:02:01.594
Also you must oil your heads, every Saturday,
with so much of oil, nicely, oil it, massage

00:02:01.594 --> 00:02:04.934
your head and sleep off and next day, wash
up your hair.

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:06.714
You’ll feel very much better.

00:02:06.714 --> 00:02:10.444
If any of you cannot give olive oil the best
is almond oil for the head.

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:12.094
You’ll keep very peaceful.

00:02:12.094 --> 00:02:16.264
Specially your children, you must massage
them till they’re five years of age, every

00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:22.484
night, when they go out to sleep in the night,
nicely very- before sleeping.

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:26.014
And then put some powder, clean it out, let
them sleep.

00:02:26.014 --> 00:02:29.034
Then the children won’t be running and upset
and all that.

00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:31.844
They’ll become very quiet children, well-behaved
children.

00:02:31.844 --> 00:02:35.454
Because you people don’t massage the children,
all their lives they are jumping.

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:40.674
And all their lives they are slightly violent,
you see, the nose must be smooth out.

00:02:40.674 --> 00:02:45.413
It’s a very simple method and as you are
Realised people you’ll smooth them much

00:02:45.413 --> 00:02:46.413
more.

00:02:46.413 --> 00:02:48.817
All these small, small things must be taken
care of, you see.

00:02:48.817 --> 00:02:55.014
Now if you have too much of cold, if you have
too much of cold, then you can mix up with

00:02:55.014 --> 00:03:03.303
a bit of camphor, with oil, and put that in
the nose, little actually, not much, that

00:03:03.303 --> 00:03:07.524
also is very good, that also smooth your cold
and puts you right.

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:11.874
This country has one big problem with Vishuddhi
chakra everywhere in the West, because of

00:03:11.874 --> 00:03:12.874
the cold.

00:03:12.874 --> 00:03:17.193
And in Sahaja Yoga it is compulsory that you
must wear an undershirt.

00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:19.914
It is compulsory.

00:03:19.914 --> 00:03:25.724
Whatever may be, it is hot, cold, in India
when it’s steaming hot, you must wear an

00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:32.174
undershirt, because, when it is very hot you
start perspiring and that perspiration causes

00:03:32.174 --> 00:03:33.174
problems.

00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:39.424
So, always wear an undershirt, whether you
are in a hot season or in a cold season.

00:03:39.424 --> 00:03:42.723
That’s a compulsion for Sahaja Yogis that
they must wear.

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:49.464
And for all of them, also is compulsory that
they should always wear a muffler when they

00:03:49.464 --> 00:03:53.273
go out in the winter time this is an important
thing.

00:03:53.273 --> 00:03:59.363
And also put some cotton wool in the ears
as I put it.

00:03:59.363 --> 00:04:03.773
For your sake I’ve told you to put it cause
you are careless, so I look after you but

00:04:03.773 --> 00:04:05.864
putting it to my ears like this.

00:04:05.864 --> 00:04:08.184
You all should put it before going out.

00:04:08.184 --> 00:04:14.253
And keep your head covered in the night, when
you sleep, cover your head with something

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:15.253
and then sleep.

00:04:15.253 --> 00:04:18.894
Because most of the time, your body is all
covered, but the head is not covered.

00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:23.704
Because now you are Realised-souls and your
Sahastrara is weak, so you must look after

00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:24.704
your Sahastrara.

00:04:24.704 --> 00:04:28.954
Cover your head so that you won’t have any
problem.

00:04:28.954 --> 00:04:32.264
Also you must verify what sort of a person
you are.

00:04:32.264 --> 00:04:37.524
If you have a liver problem, you must get
a diet for that, which is here, people will

00:04:37.524 --> 00:04:38.524
tell you.

00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:42.994
If you are left sided person, if you have
left sided problems, then you must know about

00:04:42.994 --> 00:04:43.994
the diet that you have to take.

00:04:43.994 --> 00:04:49.644
For example, a person who is a left sided
should not take carbohydrates at all, on the

00:04:49.644 --> 00:04:51.784
contrary should eat proteins, in whatever
form it is possible.

00:04:51.784 --> 00:04:56.704
In Sahaja Yoga you know we don’t believe
in vegetarianism or anything, but we do believe

00:04:56.704 --> 00:05:04.814
that the muscles of bigger animals than us,
are not good for our teeth, or for our body

00:05:04.814 --> 00:05:11.954
also because the structure of a muscular cell
of a bigger animal is much bigger than ours.

00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:16.844
And that’s how they heat up, I mean, even
by mistake if I eat some beef, or anybody

00:05:16.844 --> 00:05:23.154
ask me, the other day, my cheeks were swollen
up, so that’s why it happens, it is an automatic

00:05:23.154 --> 00:05:24.154
reaction.

00:05:24.154 --> 00:05:32.554
And we are not supposed to use plastics; in
our clothes, also try to avoid.

00:05:32.554 --> 00:05:37.824
Some person, [?] plastic can be used but not
all the time plastics and nylons.

00:05:37.824 --> 00:05:40.104
And also the food should not be eaten in plastics.

00:05:40.104 --> 00:05:46.874
You can eat it in paper, paper is alright
because it is –what you call- is wood, it

00:05:46.874 --> 00:05:47.944
doesn’t matter.

00:05:47.944 --> 00:05:54.504
But you shouldn’t eat in plastic food, plactic
with fork and spoon of plastic and it’s

00:05:54.504 --> 00:05:59.264
too much plastic in this country, be careful
because plastic is anti-God.

00:05:59.264 --> 00:06:04.354
It is anti-human life, it is anti-biological
processes.

00:06:04.354 --> 00:06:08.894
So avoid plastic as far as possible, be careful
on that.

00:06:08.894 --> 00:06:14.054
Also don’t use, I mean, something out of
absolute plastic like, I’ve seen I wanted

00:06:14.054 --> 00:06:20.094
to buy one pair of slippers for myself, I
couldn’t get one in the all of New-York.

00:06:20.094 --> 00:06:22.474
Because I didn’t want a plastic.

00:06:22.474 --> 00:06:26.734
And if you wear that then you develop all
kinds of skin problems and diseases, so be

00:06:26.734 --> 00:06:28.204
careful on that.

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:31.354
There are so many other things we have to
be careful about.

00:06:31.354 --> 00:06:36.024
And because we have found out that these things
are harmful, that’s why we have made it

00:06:36.024 --> 00:06:38.754
compulsory that every one of you must be careful.

00:06:38.754 --> 00:06:45.084
Because now you have become the temple of
God and the temple of God should be healthy.

00:06:45.084 --> 00:06:51.984
We don’t want tubercular patients to go
around as saints nobody is going to believe

00:06:51.984 --> 00:06:52.984
them.

00:06:52.984 --> 00:06:56.294
Sahaja Yogi: Can you just tell us about sugar.

00:06:56.294 --> 00:06:57.584
Shri Mataji: Ah.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:03.674
Now there is another falsehood about- thank’s
God it’s now broken- that the sugar is against

00:07:03.674 --> 00:07:05.574
our growth and all that.

00:07:05.574 --> 00:07:10.954
Sugar is very important for attention, specially
people who suffer from liver.

00:07:10.954 --> 00:07:14.354
For example, people who are thin, mostly,
suffer from liver trouble.

00:07:14.354 --> 00:07:20.194
For them, sugar is so important, that if they
don’t take sugar, they’ll become like

00:07:20.194 --> 00:07:25.844
the sugar cane which is, comes out of the
machine, pressing machine, you see.

00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:28.024
They’d better take some sugar.

00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:32.164
Sugar is very important for your liver!

00:07:32.164 --> 00:07:36.134
Best carbohydrate is the white sugar, not
the red sugar; red sugar is not good because

00:07:36.134 --> 00:07:38.724
it has got molasses, it’s very heating.

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:42.924
Some people have funny ideas here, also about
food.

00:07:42.924 --> 00:07:48.224
Like, some of them believe, that if you eat
natural food- and once I got something from

00:07:48.224 --> 00:07:51.174
natural store and I got diarrhoea for five
days!

00:07:51.174 --> 00:07:56.364
Because it was meant for animals not for human
beings.

00:07:56.364 --> 00:08:02.254
Like some people eat, what you call them [Shri
Mataji speaks in Marathi] cotton seed.

00:08:02.254 --> 00:08:05.024
Now cotton seeds we give only to animals.

00:08:05.024 --> 00:08:07.024
I can’t believe it.

00:08:07.024 --> 00:08:10.574
But I’ve seen in Switzerland, they give
cotton seed in the bread.

00:08:10.574 --> 00:08:15.234
There was cotton seeds in the bread, one or
two is alright, but imagine [Shri Mataji speaks

00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:18.014
in Hindi] – Laughs from Hindi speakers.

00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:20.254
I mean it has to be given to buffalos only!

00:08:20.254 --> 00:08:22.374
[Laughter] Like that, I was given a [inaudible]
You see, these are very strong things.

00:08:22.374 --> 00:08:27.354
In the same way, very soft food is also not
good, we have to be in the centre in everything.

00:08:27.354 --> 00:08:32.833
Don’t eat very raw food you see, like some
of the bread in France you know, even in England

00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:36.634
we find, the bread cereals [inaudible] completely.

00:08:36.634 --> 00:08:38.974
So that kind of a crispy stuff is not needed.

00:08:38.974 --> 00:08:46.074
It should be such that your gums are looked
after, there are delicate things, and have

00:08:46.074 --> 00:08:49.054
food which is good for you.

00:08:49.054 --> 00:08:54.074
Don’t go with rationality, don’t go with
the fashion, but whatever is good for you

00:08:54.074 --> 00:08:55.074
that should be done.

00:08:55.074 --> 00:08:59.844
And you find out about yourself, what is your
temperament, what sort of a food will suit

00:08:59.844 --> 00:09:03.014
you, and accordingly you should eat.

00:09:03.014 --> 00:09:08.194
Of course, everybody is free to do what they
like but we can only advise them that this

00:09:08.194 --> 00:09:13.214
will suit you and you’ll find out it will
be very useful to all of you, it will help

00:09:13.214 --> 00:09:14.214
you.

00:09:14.214 --> 00:09:18.204
For your hair growth, also you should get
vibrated oil and use it.

00:09:18.204 --> 00:09:22.014
Now, you’ll be surprised that day, somebody
saw Warren and he said: “He is the same

00:09:22.014 --> 00:09:23.014
fellow?

00:09:23.014 --> 00:09:24.014
He looks much younger”.

00:09:24.014 --> 00:09:25.154
So I said: “Yes”.

00:09:25.154 --> 00:09:29.334
he had a bald head from here to here like
that and now he’s grown hair.

00:09:29.334 --> 00:09:36.064
With proper care, you can have you hair quite
intact, for quite some time, if you look after

00:09:36.064 --> 00:09:37.064
your hair.

00:09:37.064 --> 00:09:41.964
But hair is very important is not so much
the look, but it’s Sahastrara.

00:09:41.964 --> 00:09:49.204
And if you put oil in your Sahastrara every
week, you will have a smooth personality,

00:09:49.204 --> 00:09:57.424
a smooth behaviour, a smooth movement; you’ll
deal with other people in a gentle manner.

00:09:57.424 --> 00:09:58.464
So this is very necessary.

00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:03.494
In India we actually have a big masseur attached
to a family, you see, he’s a very hefty

00:10:03.494 --> 00:10:08.564
fellow, and he comes to masseur [massage]
the men, you see, and he just sits on their

00:10:08.564 --> 00:10:11.654
body and really finishes them off completely!

00:10:11.654 --> 00:10:15.114
At the first shot, they’re dead!

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:20.934
Then he uses their body fully and pushes them
and sits on them rub them with one clap!

00:10:20.934 --> 00:10:24.634
You see, five, six of them will be jumping
on five, six people.

00:10:24.634 --> 00:10:26.434
With clap, they’ll go round.

00:10:26.434 --> 00:10:29.274
By the time the second clap comes in, the
person is finished!

00:10:29.274 --> 00:10:31.284
That’s how, that’s how they manage.

00:10:31.284 --> 00:10:34.954
But there is no importance on massage in here,
you see.

00:10:34.954 --> 00:10:38.284
And don’t ask a non Sahaja Yogi to massage
you, never.

00:10:38.284 --> 00:10:44.914
Don’t allow anybody to touch you that way
because, you see, these people carry all bad

00:10:44.914 --> 00:10:46.744
vibrations and you may suffer.

00:10:46.744 --> 00:10:52.734
You must allow only the Realised souls to
massage you, if possible, or you yourself

00:10:52.734 --> 00:10:53.924
should massage yourself.

00:10:53.924 --> 00:10:59.524
But don’t go to these masseurs and people
who are massaging all kind of people and they

00:10:59.524 --> 00:11:01.974
might be giving you some troubles.

00:11:01.974 --> 00:11:07.044
So one has to be very careful about certain
things and certain personal habits also which

00:11:07.044 --> 00:11:08.044
we have discussed.

00:11:08.044 --> 00:11:13.554
And you can ask Warren, he’ll tell you about
it, which are very important for Mooladhara

00:11:13.554 --> 00:11:17.644
and all those things, which must be followed,
whether you are in England, America, anywhere.

00:11:17.644 --> 00:11:22.444
These must be followed to keep yourself clean
outside and inside.

00:11:22.444 --> 00:11:23.804
Now if you have any question.

00:11:23.804 --> 00:11:29.044
Sahaja Yogi: I was only wondering about the
kind of techniques that we should use when

00:11:29.044 --> 00:11:31.214
massaging the children.

00:11:31.214 --> 00:11:32.814
But I guess we can talk about that another
time.

00:11:32.814 --> 00:11:37.944
Shri Mataji: I mean, anyway you use is alright,
but always, you put it upwards, you see?

00:11:37.944 --> 00:11:43.404
The movement should be upwards, but use oil
otherwise you pull up, you pull up their hair.

00:11:43.404 --> 00:11:46.834
So use oil to put it upwards.

00:11:46.834 --> 00:11:50.184
Sahaja Yogi: And don’t forget the Sahasrara.

00:11:50.184 --> 00:11:52.574
Shri Mataji: Sahasrara, don’t forget.

00:11:52.574 --> 00:11:57.384
Sahasrara you must put lot of oil on children.

00:11:57.384 --> 00:12:05.344
Sahaja Yogi: Mother we’re gone need more
hairdressers, people who can cut hair, who

00:12:05.344 --> 00:12:06.344
are Realised souls, cause they are touching
our Sahastrara while cutting.

00:12:06.344 --> 00:12:07.344
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:12:07.344 --> 00:12:08.344
Otherwise you can grow, what’s the harm?

00:12:08.344 --> 00:12:09.344
Sahaja Yogi: We can grow our hair Mother?

00:12:09.344 --> 00:12:11.144
Shri Mataji: Yes here, up to here [below the
ears] you can grow and turn them round.

00:12:11.144 --> 00:12:18.564
Shri Mataji: You see, you’ll look like a
philosopher, quite impressive.

00:12:18.564 --> 00:12:24.714
Shri Mataji: But you should not be a funny
looking person.

00:12:24.714 --> 00:12:28.844
That’s one thing very important you see.

00:12:28.844 --> 00:12:33.224
You have to, not to adopt some funny methods,
you see?

00:12:33.224 --> 00:12:34.464
Like people have.

00:12:34.464 --> 00:12:39.514
Specially, nowadays, the fashion is to disable
your hair and keep them absolutely disabled,

00:12:39.514 --> 00:12:44.144
there’s no need of doing-
Sahaja Yogi: The hair must be up there, over

00:12:44.144 --> 00:12:45.144
the forehead.

00:12:45.144 --> 00:12:46.144
Shri Mataji: Ah!

00:12:46.144 --> 00:12:50.064
It should be keep back over the forehead,
don’t cover your forehead or your eyes,

00:12:50.064 --> 00:12:51.064
never.

00:12:51.064 --> 00:12:52.754
Sahaja Yogis: Agnya chakra
Shri Mataji: Ah.

00:12:52.754 --> 00:12:53.754
Agnya chakra.

00:12:53.754 --> 00:12:56.464
You must keep it open, you see, always open.

00:12:56.464 --> 00:13:02.264
You must have a centre path if it’s possible,
but keep the forehead open, this is important.

00:13:02.264 --> 00:13:06.494
You should keep the forehead open, it’s
very good for others you see, and don’t

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:08.703
cover your eyes with any hair.

00:13:08.703 --> 00:13:13.884
Many people have a habit of allowing the hair
to come in the eyes and you’ll have [inaudible].

00:13:13.884 --> 00:13:18.604
Children also, never allow hair to come on
their eyes.

00:13:18.604 --> 00:13:22.824
Then we have something for the eyes also,
what you call Netranjan, I don’t have now

00:13:22.824 --> 00:13:27.694
anything, but it’s a very good, simple thing,
cots you nothing about- [Shri Mataji speaks

00:13:27.694 --> 00:13:29.444
aside] one cent of a dollar.

00:13:29.444 --> 00:13:32.344
Sahaja Yogi: We have some, we can send them
tomorrow.

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:36.994
Shri Mataji: Alright, they have some, they’ll
give you, which is to be applied first very

00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:37.994
carefully.

00:13:37.994 --> 00:13:43.084
Because if you are not used to it, it will
a little bit burn and the tears will start

00:13:43.084 --> 00:13:45.334
coming out of your eyes, it will clear your
eyes.

00:13:45.334 --> 00:13:48.953
And you’ll be surprised, with that, if you
use it, you don’t develop these bags [dark

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:50.074
circles] and things like that.

00:13:50.074 --> 00:13:51.164
And the water flows out.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.274
It’s a very simple thing.

00:13:53.274 --> 00:14:01.924
And for soap also, try to use natural soaps,
better use, because here the soaps are such

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.894
that I don’t know what to say.

00:14:03.894 --> 00:14:05.014
Sahaja Yogi: Paramolove Mother?

00:14:05.014 --> 00:14:08.654
Paramolove, I think that is about the only
soap you can get here.

00:14:08.654 --> 00:14:22.185
Shri Mataji: Yes that is good, Paramolove
is good.

00:14:22.185 --> 00:14:23.185
It’s very good.

00:14:23.185 --> 00:14:24.185
Gap in the video

00:14:24.185 --> 00:14:28.274
Shri Mataji: What to do, is to take a little
oil, and heat with some clove, Cloves.

00:14:28.274 --> 00:14:30.104
Sahaja Yogi: Cloves?

00:14:30.104 --> 00:14:31.934
Shri Mataji: Cloves.

00:14:31.934 --> 00:14:41.504
And let the oil be a little bit cool down,
when it is quite cooled down, nor burning

00:14:41.504 --> 00:14:45.644
out at all, but just warm, you can feel it,
then put it in the ears.

00:14:45.644 --> 00:14:47.184
Sahaja Yogini: Olive oil is better?

00:14:47.184 --> 00:14:48.724
Shri Mataji: Olive oil is alright.

00:14:48.724 --> 00:14:49.724
Gap in the video

00:14:49.724 --> 00:14:55.074
Sahaja Yogi: Mother can you explain to us
the techniques of vibrated sugar and vibrated

00:14:55.074 --> 00:15:00.114
salt, by giving vibrations, I don’t quite
understand you see…

00:15:00.114 --> 00:15:06.064
Shri Mataji: You see, because God has given
you vibrations, the power is flowing through

00:15:06.064 --> 00:15:08.324
you now, the vibrations are there.

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:13.614
So whatever you get from outside is touched
by so many people, so many people have created

00:15:13.614 --> 00:15:17.464
it and they have got a good mind or may be
something’s wrong with them, best thing

00:15:17.464 --> 00:15:19.904
is to give them a bandhan before eating.

00:15:19.904 --> 00:15:23.044
[Shri Mataji turns tree times her hand]
Any food you eat you must give it a bandhan

00:15:23.044 --> 00:15:28.024
like this three times, so your vibrations
flow into the food and you get it sanctified.

00:15:28.024 --> 00:15:33.974
Or else, you can also use your hands for eating
if you have washed your hands, then it’s

00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:34.974
alright.

00:15:34.974 --> 00:15:40.144
Or else, if you are taking the water, you
can just put your hands there, then it gets

00:15:40.144 --> 00:15:41.474
vibrated, then drink it.

00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:45.504
Because, the thing is, the vibrations have
started flowing through your hands, but still

00:15:45.604 --> 00:15:48.964
have not spread to your body fully.

00:15:49.024 --> 00:15:51.604
You see my point?
