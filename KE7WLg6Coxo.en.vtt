WEBVTT

03:23.600 --> 03:26.200
but

03:53.900 --> 03:57.320
I don’t know what to say!

04:02.600 --> 04:05.560
You are living in this house now

04:05.680 --> 04:17.720
and it was very nice because Sahaja Yogis were living here and they enjoyed my stay here.

04:17.860 --> 04:19.060
but

04:19.060 --> 04:21.060
We have to change

04:25.040 --> 04:27.580
and progress that’s the point is

04:28.400 --> 04:34.520
With every change you must progress otherwise it has no meaning, the change has no meaning.

04:35.740 --> 04:39.860
So now they are thinking that I should now be in the house here.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.720
I think it’s a good idea.

04:59.420 --> 05:07.620
Shri Mataji we’d like to thank you for coming to live here in Ealing and in this house for so long.

05:07.620 --> 05:12.560
And we know that, from this house, all kinds of blessings have come out for us. and

05:12.880 --> 05:20.740
And I wanted to say it was a little bit symbolic Shri Mataji when you came here this house was in complete degradation and ruin

05:21.540 --> 05:28.140
and now you have built it up and reconstructed it, renovated it, into the palace that it is.

05:28.140 --> 05:37.320
And we hope  Shri Mataji you can achieve the same marvellous transformation with us because it’s symbolic.

05:37.580 --> 05:39.600
But have I not done that? I have already.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.460
You see, it is your doing, your accepting is the one that has worked.

05:45.320 --> 05:52.000
And I mean I must say there are so many. Very happy.

05:57.900 --> 06:02.960
I have no complaints about Sahaja Yogis here, they are very good. But what we should [do is] expand now,

06:03.320 --> 06:05.320
this joy, this peace.

06:05.900 --> 06:11.680
This can be done very easily if you can get hold of Sahaja Yogis, it will be very nice.

06:11.900 --> 06:15.140
But, as I told you, have some picnics.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.920
With the newcomers, you can have some picnics,

06:18.920 --> 06:26.240
along the river or Serpentine or somewhere close by, where they can come easily.

06:26.320 --> 06:33.780
They did this in Australia when I told them and it has…I mean of course Australia has such a big Sahaja Yoga there.

06:35.880 --> 06:44.620
Then you will become collective the more you meet, ask everyone who you are, seeing more, sort of thing.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.900
It will work here Mother when they get over their cynicism.

06:49.380 --> 06:51.380
So much cynicism in the people.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.440
Cynicism is there, I agree,

07:03.620 --> 07:07.560
but that they can only get over if they get Realisation.

07:07.860 --> 07:11.060
It’s a thing like that. If they get Realisation they’ll be alright.

07:11.140 --> 07:16.820
So for that, first of all, what we have to do is to humble down.

07:19.320 --> 07:25.400
they are Realised-souls so it’s much better to talk to them to do all these things.

07:25.440 --> 07:29.800
The thing is that they are not Realised-souls, that’s the main point is.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.760
When they come, now they are getting Realisation

07:33.240 --> 07:34.760
And so many are coming

07:35.260 --> 07:38.840
So our hopes that it will expand

07:39.080 --> 07:46.440
Once they’ll get into the sea of Realisation they’ll be alright.

07:48.120 --> 07:50.120
No problem.

08:08.100 --> 08:13.640
I am sure that, if you work it out, you see, once they are Realised-souls

08:13.640 --> 08:16.000
they are different people

08:18.080 --> 08:22.880
and it will work out, I am sure about it.

08:23.820 --> 08:31.960
We have to just meet them, have collective parties and things like that. They’ll enjoy.

08:32.880 --> 08:37.300
I mean that cynicism was old, age-old, now finished!

08:37.320 --> 08:41.760
and not in the young people, isn’t it.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.000
Not so much. Particularly the tiny ones.

08:45.180 --> 08:50.700
They are seeing how can they give Realisation in the streets, the younger children just take it immediately.

08:50.920 --> 08:51.880
Younger ones?

08:52.100 --> 08:55.280
Yes. And teenagers, young teenagers.

08:57.140 --> 09:02.280
And also, you see, once they grow in it they can spread it also.

09:07.260 --> 09:10.760
Drinking is too much in this country. That's the thing one has to control

09:11.820 --> 09:14.920
There’s no need to drink. I don’t understand there’s any need

09:16.200 --> 09:18.260
But sort of it’s a tradition

09:19.500 --> 09:22.100
children also take to all kinds of drinking.

09:23.220 --> 09:28.180
I think maximum is not here perhaps. Maybe in America. But here also it’s quite a lot.

09:33.140 --> 09:39.860
Once they get Realisation I think they’ll be alright. Suddenly they become aware of themselves

09:39.880 --> 09:41.880
then they are alright, better.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.760
First they must get their Realisation.

09:47.780 --> 09:53.580
They are beginning to go out into the schools, the Sahaja Yogis are going into the schools, the primary schools, to teach

09:53.820 --> 10:01.000
or to show them Kathak dancing and to sing, and so the children are getting Realisation.

10:01.300 --> 10:05.040
No but the only thing is that here the parents might have an objection.

10:05.120 --> 10:09.300
They don’t really talk about Sahaja Yoga directly,

10:09.500 --> 10:15.060
just to get them to feel it. And it’s in the dance and the music Mother.

10:15.220 --> 10:19.260
Best is to go to little grown up people.

10:19.940 --> 10:25.420
It’s better to spend money on them, time on them, than on children.

10:26.160 --> 10:33.000
It’s a problematic thing here. You see if someone starts, they’ll all join together and go against us.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.200
So better be careful

10:37.440 --> 10:39.440
It’s a very funny country you know.

10:49.240 --> 10:52.220
I don’t know what to describe it.

10:53.180 --> 10:57.760
Heart, heart is closed. The heart is closed,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
which has to open out.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.280
It circulates,

11:13.520 --> 11:21.040
the ideas circulate from here, but in this matter, in spiritual matters,

11:21.140 --> 11:23.400
they are very poor.

11:23.840 --> 11:29.340
Like, Bush has felt it.

11:29.780 --> 11:32.960
But Tony Blair I think is a Labour or what? I don’t know.

11:33.040 --> 11:37.900
He’s a Catholic I think. Or is his wife a Catholic?

11:42.520 --> 11:47.340
Wife may be a Catholic but so many Catholics have come to Sahaja Yoga.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.440
In Italy they are all Catholics

11:52.200 --> 11:54.200
but they don’t care!

11:57.620 --> 12:00.200
We’ll try to talk to him Mother.

12:00.200 --> 12:00.880
Who?

12:00.880 --> 12:02.880
Tony Blair

12:05.720 --> 12:07.720
I don’t know.

12:17.380 --> 12:21.880
then give him my book to read, maybe.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.880
He has no time.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.160
He’s very busy.

12:28.740 --> 12:30.740
Busy with nonsense!

12:35.560 --> 12:41.020
So many Muslims are coming to your country. We saw so many Saudis coming to this country!

12:41.240 --> 12:46.360
I mean, Saudis, if they come, they are the worst Muslims!

12:46.620 --> 12:48.620
So many Saudis!

12:51.740 --> 12:55.920
They have money, alright, but I don’t know their plans.

12:59.120 --> 13:05.800
And they look after these people who try to bring about all the problems – the Saudis.

13:12.180 --> 13:14.180
They are the ones who supply money,

13:15.200 --> 13:16.040
isn’t it,

13:16.720 --> 13:21.240
and all those things. In India they are running these madrasas.

13:24.140 --> 13:29.100
And they don’t believe in Mohammed Sahib! They don’t believe even in Koran!

13:31.860 --> 13:34.120
I must say Mohammed Sahib was very great,

13:34.120 --> 13:40.660
because he’s the only one who has talked about the ascent – miraj.

13:40.660 --> 13:48.020
He’s the only one, he said that,

13:48.380 --> 13:51.300
“After Realisation your hands will speak.”

13:51.300 --> 13:53.300
He’s the only one who has said it!

13:53.760 --> 13:56.240
None of these incarnations, nobody, has said this.

14:00.960 --> 14:07.460
He said something ... The Koran also, I don’t know if it is written by him, because the language is very harsh.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.400
But the main essence is there.

14:11.760 --> 14:19.520
Language is very harsh. I mean if you read it you would think that, “How could he say such things?” Because after all he was a great incarnation.

14:20.380 --> 14:22.380
but he

14:22.740 --> 14:27.980
didn’t say all this. It was really re-written by those people who were very cruel.

14:30.600 --> 14:34.300
But the thought, the contents, are correct.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.700
Also he did not know how to write.

14:56.040 --> 14:59.420
But he was such a great prophet I think. He was such a great man.

15:03.960 --> 15:11.980
Muslims can never understand him because he is beyond their conception. Can never understand him.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.620
Even the Christians have not understood Christ.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.799
They have made such a mess out of his life.

15:31.790 --> 15:33.849
I don’t know how human beings do that.

15:36.320 --> 15:41.679
Anybody who is great, who is something sensible, if he says anything, you make a mess of that.

15:43.490 --> 15:45.490
That’s human behaviour.

15:53.240 --> 16:00.250
But he said, “I’m not a prophet. I am nothing.” That’s what he said. I also said the same thing in the beginning.

16:00.980 --> 16:03.520
Because if they know somebody is saying that they will kill him.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.340
It’s very

16:12.180 --> 16:13.260
difficult.

16:15.260 --> 16:18.940
In the beginning Sahaja Yoga was very difficult, but now it’s better.

16:20.010 --> 16:22.879
But still in your country they have horrible people;

16:23.780 --> 16:26.600
they are all those horrible Swiss, they have come here

16:27.720 --> 16:29.720
working it out.

16:30.860 --> 16:35.200
Even they went into our bank to find out the money and everything.

16:42.060 --> 16:50.800
I don’t know why the media here is so fond of them because they give something funny about Sahaja Yoga.

17:02.740 --> 17:05.180
But Saudis coming here is very dangerous.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.860
They are settling down in London,

17:09.380 --> 17:11.380
specially in London

17:11.390 --> 17:16.659
It’s very dangerous, because they are moneyed people and they don’t believe in

17:18.949 --> 17:23.528
The Prophet or anything.

17:25.039 --> 17:27.039
They have their own

17:27.380 --> 17:29.380
thinking

17:32.440 --> 17:34.440
How will it

17:35.660 --> 17:37.660
be useful?

17:38.400 --> 17:41.060
But how they are given visas – is the best part.

17:46.180 --> 17:52.760
Jai Shri Mataji. If you have money then it’s very easy to come to this country.

17:55.760 --> 18:01.020
Because they said this house is sold out. I said, “I hope not to a Saudi?”

18:01.280 --> 18:03.940
Because they are buying everywhere.

18:07.220 --> 18:10.740
I think it would be difficult for a Saudi to live here!

18:24.320 --> 18:28.560
So we have to try it. And I think you will get more people now.

18:29.900 --> 18:33.980
Younger people of course you will get

18:34.140 --> 18:36.760
because they have no way to work it out.
