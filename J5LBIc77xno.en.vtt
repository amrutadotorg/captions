00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.840
Today we are celebrating the resurrection
of Christ.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.860
That is the greatest message of Christ's life,
not the crucifixion.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:55.720
Anybody can be crucified and killed, but this
dead body of Christ was resurrected from death.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.480
Death itself died, and He overcome it.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:19.660
It's a miracle for ordinary human beings,
definitely, but not for Christ, because He

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.710
was a Divine person.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:30.770
He was Shri Ganesha, He was Omkara Itself.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:41.310
So He could walk on the water, gravity would
not affect Him.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:50.100
And also He got resurrected because death
could not affect Him.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:03:03.040
Such a great Divine personality, specially
created for human beings, that people should

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.250
recognize Him.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.380
But they did not recognize Him.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.060
They killed Him in a very brutal manner.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:26.570
And even now they think cross is a great thing
because Christ died on the cross.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:34.950
It's a very cruel idea of human beings to
respect the cross.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.689
What does it show?

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:55.140
It shows that people liked all the cruelties
done to Him, symbolizing cross as the one

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:05.279
that represented His death and His atrocities,
the way He was tortured.

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:15.080
So it was a very sad time when He was crucified.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:26.400
But when He got resurrected, it was the most
joyous, most auspicious and most beautiful

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400
time.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:39.910
The resurrection of Christ is very symbolic
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:52.320
If Christ could be resurrected, then human
beings also can be resurrected, because He

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:01.480
came as a human being with all powers, and
He created the path of resurrection for us.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:10.100
This path of resurrection is the one that
we have followed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:19.790
But the greatest thing is the piercing of
the Agnya Chakra which is described in all

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:34.250
spiritual treatise, or may be called as the
scriptures, that that is the door which is

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:44.720
golden, which is like a cover, and no one
can pass through that, so constricted is this

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.514
door of Agnya Chakra.

00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:55.385
But Christ did cross that.

00:05:55.385 --> 00:06:06.775
His crossing has helped us today to
open your Agnya.

00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:12.554
Without opening the Agnya you cannot go to
Sahasrara.

00:06:12.554 --> 00:06:22.285
And this was done so easily in your case,
only because Christ could go through all that

00:06:22.285 --> 00:06:28.675
torture and all that brutality, and crossed
over.

00:06:28.675 --> 00:06:39.204
How much we should be indebted to Him, I don't
know words that can express, because He is

00:06:39.204 --> 00:06:45.804
the One who took lead in telling people that
“You seek.

00:06:45.804 --> 00:06:48.905
You seek and you'll find.”

00:06:48.905 --> 00:06:58.174
And then He says that “You have to come
and bang at the door.”

00:06:58.174 --> 00:07:06.595
This is exactly what has happened in your
case, that you have risen up to Agnya and

00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:10.245
then you have crossed beyond Agnya.

00:07:10.245 --> 00:07:21.035
This crossing of Agnya was not at all difficult
for you, though by your own ideas of thinking

00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:28.614
and of conditioning, of the futuristic planning
and all that, it was a big, big crowd, I should

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:36.334
say, of very black clouds were hovering on
the Agnya.

00:07:36.334 --> 00:07:45.484
Your thoughts were overpowering you, and you
could not have penetrated through this Agnya

00:07:45.484 --> 00:07:47.894
which was all covered.

00:07:47.894 --> 00:07:54.655
But you did, and you never even felt that
you have crossed the Agnya Chakra so easily.

00:07:54.655 --> 00:08:03.604
The first of all, we all should really be
very thankful to Christ for opening the Agnya

00:08:03.604 --> 00:08:04.945
for you.

00:08:04.945 --> 00:08:15.304
For Him all the tortures and all the brutality
were nothing, because His purpose of life,

00:08:15.304 --> 00:08:23.725
His purpose of His advent, His incarnation,
was to break the Agnya Chakra.

00:08:23.725 --> 00:08:31.824
Today you will find that even though your
Agnya is opened out and you have crossed through,

00:08:31.824 --> 00:08:43.644
still you'll be amazed that people get involved
in the Agnya Chakra.

00:08:43.644 --> 00:08:48.755
In Sahaja Yoga people do get involved in Agnya
Chakra.

00:08:48.755 --> 00:08:55.745
Now how do we see through introspection what
happens to us?

00:08:55.745 --> 00:09:08.635
For example, once people come to Sahaja Yoga,
they think they are in charge: in charge of

00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:18.355
this, in charge of that, in charge of all
the Sahaja Yogis; and they start behaving

00:09:18.355 --> 00:09:24.235
in a manner which doesn't behove a Sahaja
Yogi.

00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:25.975
It doesn't.

00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:34.195
I've seen them, and I really am amused the
way they just start thrusting themselves and

00:09:34.195 --> 00:09:39.965
showing off that they are very much in charge.

00:09:39.965 --> 00:09:42.755
This is nothing modern.

00:09:42.755 --> 00:09:48.095
This is used to be there with human beings.

00:09:48.095 --> 00:09:55.754
But if it was so, it was before Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:55.754 --> 00:10:04.795
Even now people get into the mood of dominating
others by saying that “We are in charge.”

00:10:04.795 --> 00:10:12.375
Sahaja Yoga is not so simple as you think,
because there are lots of temptations.

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:14.855
Supposing you make somebody a leader.

00:10:14.855 --> 00:10:27.235
Now a leader becomes sort of “in charge,”
you know, and he gets the drunkenness of power.

00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:39.395
When he's like that he starts dominating all
the rest of the people, and also starts showing

00:10:39.395 --> 00:10:53.265
off that he's something very great and he
has to dominate all the rest of the people.

00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:55.345
Then he creates an atmosphere of fear.

00:10:55.345 --> 00:11:02.025
Firstly, I've seen what happens with them
is that they start saying falsely that “Mother

00:11:02.025 --> 00:11:07.665
has told this, Mother has said so, this is
Mother's ideas.”

00:11:07.665 --> 00:11:11.985
I have nothing to do with that gentleman,
but he goes on talking like that, and people

00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:13.554
get very frightened.

00:11:13.554 --> 00:11:20.055
Then also he can also frighten you by saying,
“I will tell Mother.

00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:25.184
Mother will listen to me and She'll punish
you.”

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:32.395
I am sometimes very surprised at such people,
because I have never said that I'll punish

00:11:32.395 --> 00:11:39.254
somebody or I'll take him out of Sahaja Yoga
- nothing of the kind.

00:11:39.254 --> 00:11:43.874
So this man who thinks no end of himself,
he may be a leader, may not be a leader, may

00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:53.444
be nothing in Sahaja Yoga; and then if he
starts talking like this in such a funny manner

00:11:53.444 --> 00:11:58.095
that it doesn't look that the person is a
Sahaja Yogi.

00:11:58.095 --> 00:12:04.785
Then he goes even further.

00:12:04.785 --> 00:12:15.374
He goes himself describing as something very
great, as if he's the one who is chosen specially

00:12:15.374 --> 00:12:18.295
for rising higher and higher.

00:12:18.295 --> 00:12:22.254
When I hear about these things I'm really
amazed.

00:12:22.254 --> 00:12:33.064
How can people befool themselves all the time,
and behave in such a manner?

00:12:33.064 --> 00:12:36.585
First thing in Sahaja Yoga is humility.

00:12:36.585 --> 00:12:40.837
If you are not a humble person, you cannot
be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:12:40.837 --> 00:12:50.626
The person who orders about, the person who
talks in a manner as if he is Hitler, any

00:12:50.626 --> 00:13:01.086
person who tries to control and be in charge
of the thing, all these capacities only show

00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:06.934
that that person has achieved nothing in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:13:06.934 --> 00:13:11.225
First thing is to enjoy the humility.

00:13:11.225 --> 00:13:16.924
I've seen people like this, they'll always
sit in the first row.

00:13:16.924 --> 00:13:20.785
They'll be always sitting in a place where
you just see them all the time there.

00:13:20.785 --> 00:13:22.525
I just smile.

00:13:22.525 --> 00:13:25.995
I know they are just show-offs.

00:13:25.995 --> 00:13:30.554
They think no end of themselves, and that's
why they are there.

00:13:30.554 --> 00:13:36.535
But they themselves are losing, they themselves
are not very happy.

00:13:36.535 --> 00:13:43.345
That's why they try to do all these tricks
and this kind of domination.

00:13:43.345 --> 00:13:58.385
The other side of it is people who are humble,
who are simple, who are honest and who are

00:13:58.385 --> 00:14:03.825
really seeking the truth, are being oppressed
by this gentleman.

00:14:03.825 --> 00:14:12.455
He oppresses them, tries to show off, tries
to make slaves out of others.

00:14:12.455 --> 00:14:23.835
I have seen people have gone so far that there
was a group of people who just would not move

00:14:23.835 --> 00:14:29.064
even an inch without the permission of their
leader.

00:14:29.064 --> 00:14:37.205
And they would go all out to be subservient
to such a irrational personality.

00:14:37.205 --> 00:14:44.374
First of all, you know this is the love of
Mother.

00:14:44.374 --> 00:14:47.015
Mother never dominates.

00:14:47.015 --> 00:14:51.585
She cannot dominate, because She is nothing
but love.

00:14:51.585 --> 00:14:58.295
As soon as She sees the problem, immediately
She absorbs it.

00:14:58.295 --> 00:15:06.655
She has to make deliberations, just a drama
sometimes to show that She's angry.

00:15:06.655 --> 00:15:10.455
But She cannot basically be angry with anyone.

00:15:10.455 --> 00:15:17.675
It's the love which all the time, all the
time is flowing.

00:15:17.675 --> 00:15:21.815
And that love envelops the Mother, as well
as envelops you.

00:15:21.815 --> 00:15:26.694
That is how you people will understand Sahaja
Yoga.

00:15:26.694 --> 00:15:31.694
What does a human being need is nothing but
love and compassion, love and compassion of

00:15:31.694 --> 00:15:37.155
a very, very pure type.

00:15:37.155 --> 00:15:42.385
Look at Christ.

00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:46.325
He pitied the people who crucified Him.

00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:53.275
He told His Father, the God Almighty, that
“Please forgive them, because they do not

00:15:53.275 --> 00:15:55.575
know what they are doing.”

00:15:55.575 --> 00:16:02.955
He could see that the blindness of these people
are doing wrong things, and God the Father

00:16:02.955 --> 00:16:07.685
will be very annoyed, Who is wrathful and
may destroy them.

00:16:07.685 --> 00:16:21.225
So this is what it was done with a very compassionate
feeling, without thinking about, just automatically

00:16:21.225 --> 00:16:30.475
He felt that these people are doing all this
to Me, and I don't know what will happen to

00:16:30.475 --> 00:16:31.915
them.

00:16:31.915 --> 00:16:34.434
So He prayed to God, to Father, “Please
forgive.

00:16:34.434 --> 00:16:37.614
Please forgive them, for they do not know
what they are doing.

00:16:37.614 --> 00:16:41.235
They are blind, so please do not punish them.”

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:42.285
What compassion!

00:16:42.285 --> 00:16:43.325
What love!

00:16:43.325 --> 00:16:50.424
I mean, think of it: do we do that in our
life?

00:16:50.424 --> 00:16:59.194
If somebody harms us, troubles us, do we ask
Father to forgive those who do not know what

00:16:59.194 --> 00:17:00.194
they are doing?

00:17:00.194 --> 00:17:06.635
That should be the level of Sahaja Yoga, and
it will work out very well.

00:17:06.635 --> 00:17:13.905
If you ask for forgiveness, God will look
after them, He’ll transform them, He'll

00:17:13.905 --> 00:17:17.624
bring them to their senses.

00:17:17.624 --> 00:17:28.795
The message of Christ are full of love, compassion,
pure compassion.

00:17:28.795 --> 00:17:36.875
How He tried to protect Mary Magdalene is
an example of that, who was leading a sinful

00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:43.355
life; and for a saint it had nothing to do,
He had nothing to do with her.

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:51.205
But when He saw she being stoned by people,
He stood against her, took a stone in His

00:17:51.205 --> 00:18:02.165
own hand, and He says, “All right, those
who have not committed any wrong deed or have

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:07.995
not committed any sin, can take this stone
and hit Me.”

00:18:07.995 --> 00:18:15.175
And nobody came forward, because they had
to face themselves.

00:18:15.175 --> 00:18:28.255
When we are dominating others, then a kind
of a cruel joy is there, some sort of a joy

00:18:28.255 --> 00:18:33.335
that I don't understand Myself, but people
have.

00:18:33.335 --> 00:18:41.865
They show off that we have achieved this joy,
we have achieved this great power.

00:18:41.865 --> 00:18:52.405
It has happened for centuries, with all the
great emperors and also despotic rulers.

00:18:52.405 --> 00:18:57.385
But with Sahaja Yogis it should be the other
way round.

00:18:57.385 --> 00:19:05.485
They have to rule the world with peace and
love.

00:19:05.485 --> 00:19:09.025
They don't have to show off, by any chance.

00:19:09.025 --> 00:19:13.025
This is how Sahaja Yoga will spread much,
much fast.

00:19:13.025 --> 00:19:19.165
What does the world need? - you just think
of it.

00:19:19.165 --> 00:19:20.845
It needs only love and affection.

00:19:20.845 --> 00:19:34.245
Those people who are yet lost in the ignorance
about life and are still busy troubling others,

00:19:34.245 --> 00:19:42.925
torturing others, going against the collectivity,
will have to return to normalcy.

00:19:42.925 --> 00:19:48.885
It’s very abnormal behavior sometimes, and
you just don’t understand why they behave

00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:49.885
like mad people.

00:19:49.885 --> 00:20:01.435
It is very difficult also to tell such a person
that “You are mad.”

00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:09.315
And also it’s difficult to be with such
a person who is so mad with some sort of a

00:20:09.315 --> 00:20:10.565
power.

00:20:10.565 --> 00:20:15.855
It goes on like that with so many Sahaja Yogis,
I have seen, who start thinking they have

00:20:15.855 --> 00:20:25.035
lots of powers, they can do whatever they
like, they can talk to anyone and they can

00:20:25.035 --> 00:20:26.535
confuse everyone.

00:20:26.535 --> 00:20:36.365
But in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to confuse,
you have to clearly express your love.

00:20:36.365 --> 00:20:43.795
But that doesn’t mean any kind of a particular
gesture or a particular happening, but it

00:20:43.795 --> 00:20:51.325
is just a inner oneness with each other.

00:20:51.325 --> 00:21:06.065
Is, sometimes I find Sahaja Yogis so much
understanding each other, so much loving each

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:13.675
other, so beautifully enjoying the love of
other people.

00:21:13.675 --> 00:21:21.195
When I see that I feel very, very happy, absolutely
overjoyed.

00:21:21.195 --> 00:21:30.585
That’s what I wanted: these people should
enjoy, is there.

00:21:30.585 --> 00:21:38.475
And you’ll be amazed, the most enjoyable
thing is the love that you give to others.

00:21:38.475 --> 00:21:45.785
You may not receive, but when you give love
to others, then it’s the most enjoyable

00:21:45.785 --> 00:21:46.785
thing.

00:21:46.785 --> 00:21:58.885
But the way you express yourself is also an
art, I think, to understand how to please

00:21:58.885 --> 00:22:01.815
others, how to make them happy.

00:22:01.815 --> 00:22:07.645
I've told this story before also, about a
saint who lived in Gaganbhoura, is a, what

00:22:07.645 --> 00:22:14.085
you can say is a hill or a mountain.

00:22:14.085 --> 00:22:23.615
He used to live there and he couldn't walk,
you see: because of vibrations he lost his

00:22:23.615 --> 00:22:28.655
legs or something, the power in them.

00:22:28.655 --> 00:22:37.415
And then he would go all over the place on
a tiger, because tiger loved him and he loved

00:22:37.415 --> 00:22:39.255
the tiger.

00:22:39.255 --> 00:22:47.345
So this gentleman was all the time telling
people from Bombay, “What are you doing

00:22:47.345 --> 00:22:48.345
here?

00:22:48.345 --> 00:22:49.345
Mother has come!

00:22:49.345 --> 00:22:51.135
Go and touch Her Feet.”

00:22:51.135 --> 00:22:57.225
I didn't know why he was so much concerned.

00:22:57.225 --> 00:23:00.575
So I told Sahaja Yogis, “I must go and meet
him.”

00:23:00.575 --> 00:23:07.715
So all these gurus, you see, they say that
“We don't leave our pillows.

00:23:07.715 --> 00:23:14.065
We have to be in our own pillow” - means
wherever they live, they exist, they won't

00:23:14.065 --> 00:23:15.065
go out.

00:23:15.065 --> 00:23:18.255
I'm the other way round.

00:23:18.255 --> 00:23:22.045
I'm never stationed in one place, you see.

00:23:22.045 --> 00:23:25.005
So they asked if I could go.

00:23:25.005 --> 00:23:27.115
I said, “Why not?”

00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:31.945
So I went there, and the Sahaja Yogis said
that “Mother, You never go anywhere, so

00:23:31.945 --> 00:23:35.265
why do You want to go here?”

00:23:35.265 --> 00:23:43.865
I said, “All right, see the vibrations,”
and it’s tremendous vibrations.

00:23:43.865 --> 00:23:49.115
So when I went up, this fellow was very angry
with the rain because he was supposed to control

00:23:49.115 --> 00:23:53.105
the rain, he was supposed to be controlling
the rain.

00:23:53.105 --> 00:24:03.955
It's very surprising that when I went up,
he could not control and I got completely

00:24:03.955 --> 00:24:04.955
drenched.

00:24:04.955 --> 00:24:08.585
So he was very angry.

00:24:08.585 --> 00:24:15.135
He was sitting on a stone, you know, and he
was going like this with anger.

00:24:15.135 --> 00:24:16.315
I didn't say anything to him.

00:24:16.315 --> 00:24:27.265
I went inside and sat in the cave, where he
had made some arrangement for Me to be seated.

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:34.735
Then he came, he touched My Feet, and he sat
down.

00:24:34.735 --> 00:24:42.925
And I was amazed that he was still angry and
he couldn't understand why the rain could

00:24:42.925 --> 00:24:43.925
not stop.

00:24:43.925 --> 00:24:50.435
So he asked Me, “Why did You not allow me
to stop that rain?

00:24:50.435 --> 00:24:58.255
Because after all You are coming to see me
all the way, and the rain should have behaved.

00:24:58.255 --> 00:25:04.165
And I also could not somehow or other control
the rain, so what was the thing, what was

00:25:04.165 --> 00:25:05.165
the lesson?”

00:25:05.165 --> 00:25:06.645
I just smiled.

00:25:06.645 --> 00:25:14.595
I said, “See, you are an ascetic, you are
a sanyasi, and I am your Mother.

00:25:14.595 --> 00:25:23.185
I cannot take a sari from you because after
all you are a sanyasi, and you are not supposed

00:25:23.185 --> 00:25:26.205
to take anything from a sanyasi.”

00:25:26.205 --> 00:25:32.195
Even the Mother cannot take anything from
him.

00:25:32.195 --> 00:25:35.925
“But you have bought a nice sari for Me.

00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:41.485
So I had to get drenched so that I could take
a sari from you.”

00:25:41.485 --> 00:25:46.785
You see, the sweetness of My telling him just
made him melt down.

00:25:46.785 --> 00:25:49.195
He started crying.

00:25:49.195 --> 00:25:56.175
He said, “We need a Mother for this world.

00:25:56.175 --> 00:25:58.337
There should be the Mother.

00:25:58.337 --> 00:26:06.455
We cannot solve it, because whatever it is,
we get angry or we want to disappear.

00:26:06.455 --> 00:26:18.015
We don't want to be with these horrible people
who are so sinful, to help them.”

00:26:18.015 --> 00:26:24.325
This is the problem with the world today,
and that's why you find very few spiritual

00:26:24.325 --> 00:26:28.335
people in the whole world.

00:26:28.335 --> 00:26:36.565
Because they are the ones who are being very
much tortured, troubled, insulted, all kinds

00:26:36.565 --> 00:26:40.565
of things happen.

00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:45.295
So they're struggling, struggling, so they
want to die very fast.

00:26:45.295 --> 00:26:55.995
Gyaneshwara, such a great personality, such
a great writer, poet, I mean he was everything,

00:26:55.995 --> 00:26:58.855
so beautifully he has written.

00:26:58.855 --> 00:27:06.015
But at the age of twenty-three he took his
samadhi, means he went into a cave, and closed

00:27:06.015 --> 00:27:08.665
the cave and died there.

00:27:08.665 --> 00:27:17.215
Must have been tired and fed up with the surroundings
of ignorant people, and that's why he did.

00:27:17.215 --> 00:27:26.945
So you can imagine a person like Gyaneshwara,
who was the incarnation of Kartikeya, had

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:36.465
to recede into the world of the dead because
he couldn't bear it any more the way they

00:27:36.465 --> 00:27:37.875
were torturing them.

00:27:37.875 --> 00:27:47.945
They tortured him so much, saying that he
is the son of a sanyasi and he has, I mean

00:27:47.945 --> 00:27:57.945
it's like this: “son of a sanyasi” means
he is no good, he is absolutely like an illegitimate

00:27:57.945 --> 00:28:05.355
child; and he is ill-treated to such an extent,
he didn't even have shoes to wear in that

00:28:05.355 --> 00:28:06.435
heat of India.

00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:08.225
He used to walk bare feet.

00:28:08.225 --> 00:28:15.875
And his sister, brother, who were great scholars,
who were great saints, great incarnations,

00:28:15.875 --> 00:28:17.455
all of themself.

00:28:17.455 --> 00:28:26.575
As a result he wanted just to disappear, and
he made a beautiful way of doing it, that

00:28:26.575 --> 00:28:34.285
he told them that “I have to go,” and
he took leave from them and went inside his

00:28:34.285 --> 00:28:39.285
cave, and got his samadhi.

00:28:39.285 --> 00:28:45.185
Even Christ was very young when He was crucified.

00:28:45.185 --> 00:28:51.265
He was thirty-three years of age.

00:28:51.265 --> 00:29:08.445
It was all planned by the Divine that He was
to be crucified, to make way for our Sahaja

00:29:08.445 --> 00:29:19.855
Yoga: to open the Agnya, to sacrifice His
life, and for Him to be hanged in such a horrendous,

00:29:19.855 --> 00:29:29.845
cruel way, which normally you do not find
people behaving in such a manner towards a

00:29:29.845 --> 00:29:32.705
person who is about to die.

00:29:32.705 --> 00:29:41.515
So what happened, that those people who were
in charge of His crucifixion must have been

00:29:41.515 --> 00:29:45.165
some devils, the way they behaved.

00:29:45.165 --> 00:29:53.215
It is not possible to forgive them even if
He, Christ says; it's difficult to forgive

00:29:53.215 --> 00:29:59.095
such people who were watching the crucifixion
of Christ.

00:29:59.095 --> 00:30:17.405
So if that is the case that a person like
Him thought that “Let Me do My job, is to

00:30:17.405 --> 00:30:20.935
break Sahasrara.”

00:30:20.935 --> 00:30:28.375
And then He didn't want to live, live with
these stupid people to be tortured, and He

00:30:28.375 --> 00:30:35.555
just disappeared into Kashmir, where He lived
after His resurrection.

00:30:35.555 --> 00:30:48.135
Lots of stories are there about His ascent
and His resurrection, and you see, all those

00:30:48.135 --> 00:30:55.535
stories if you read, you'll be amazed how
miraculously He got His second birth, you

00:30:55.535 --> 00:31:00.645
can say, or second life in Kashmir.

00:31:00.645 --> 00:31:08.535
He lived in Kashmir happily for some time
with His Mother, and there He died.

00:31:08.535 --> 00:31:17.755
They say there's a grave of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and also His Mother who was there.

00:31:17.755 --> 00:31:24.745
But who has taken advantage of His life, from
His life?

00:31:24.745 --> 00:31:25.745
Who are the people really who wanted Him to
die?

00:31:25.745 --> 00:31:31.635
You know very well.

00:31:31.635 --> 00:31:51.365
You know very well how Christ died, and the
people came up suddenly, like Paul and Peter,

00:31:51.365 --> 00:31:53.965
who tried to make a big business out of it.

00:31:53.965 --> 00:32:07.885
It's very sad to see that these two persons
brought such a shame.

00:32:07.885 --> 00:32:14.035
This Paul was nothing but an organizer, I
think, also a beginner.

00:32:14.035 --> 00:32:18.935
You see, he was a person who was bureaucratic,
I should say.

00:32:18.935 --> 00:32:25.335
But he was not only bureaucratic, he was also
a man who wanted to have a big position.

00:32:25.335 --> 00:32:38.305
So he told a lie that he went down to Damascus,
and on his way, on his way he saw a big cross.

00:32:38.305 --> 00:32:48.305
According to Sahaja Yoga all such signs are
a sign of supra-conscious, is not of the Spirit.

00:32:48.305 --> 00:32:55.275
And then he came back and he started his own
research, and sort of things like that.

00:32:55.275 --> 00:32:57.675
And he's written a lot of things.

00:32:57.675 --> 00:33:08.025
But throughout if you read, you'll find that
he was not a Sahaja Yogi, he was just an organizer.

00:33:08.025 --> 00:33:14.555
He was a bureaucratic personality who was
writing how we should administer, how we should

00:33:14.555 --> 00:33:23.415
have people who are different types of people,
how should we manage them.

00:33:23.415 --> 00:33:25.655
So he's management department.

00:33:25.655 --> 00:33:29.325
He was the management department for the Christians.

00:33:29.325 --> 00:33:39.045
So the Christians also became extremely, very
secretariat type: like you see, everything

00:33:39.045 --> 00:33:46.705
has a time, you must come like this, you must
sit like this, must talk like this.

00:33:46.705 --> 00:33:54.085
And also the nations which are supposed to
be Christians are observing all that in a

00:33:54.085 --> 00:33:55.945
very official manner.

00:33:55.945 --> 00:34:12.375
It is not understood why, why are they so
much official in everything?

00:34:12.375 --> 00:34:20.945
Just the opposite what Christ did, is to break
the Agnya, they built up this.

00:34:20.945 --> 00:34:28.465
And the Christian nations became the most
arrogant, most aggressive nations in the whole

00:34:28.465 --> 00:34:29.465
world.

00:34:29.465 --> 00:34:35.265
For them, it was their right to occupy any
land they saw.

00:34:35.265 --> 00:34:46.074
It was in their right to establish their own
laws, their own, I should say, assemblies.

00:34:46.074 --> 00:34:49.435
All this is done in India, I know.

00:34:49.435 --> 00:34:59.945
Even today if you go to places like Punjab
and all that, you'll find the people are just

00:34:59.945 --> 00:35:14.435
living like rustic people working very hard,
and they are all the time under attack from

00:35:14.435 --> 00:35:27.105
people who are dominating, and those who wanted
the full advantage to be taken out of these

00:35:27.105 --> 00:35:30.004
people.

00:35:30.004 --> 00:35:38.234
It was a ridiculous thing to behave like that
as Christians.

00:35:38.234 --> 00:35:42.274
Then also they started converting people.

00:35:42.274 --> 00:35:46.355
It's another nonsense, converting.

00:35:46.355 --> 00:35:51.295
Converting them in the south, in the...

00:35:51.295 --> 00:35:57.754
What they did is to - we Indians never make
breads; they don't know how to use an oven

00:35:57.754 --> 00:35:58.934
in the south.

00:35:58.934 --> 00:36:06.475
So they made huge, big cakes - you can call
it a cake or you can call it a bread - and

00:36:06.475 --> 00:36:16.484
put it in the water or in a well, and they
would say that we have put the part of the

00:36:16.484 --> 00:36:24.744
calf of a buffalo or could be a cow, or something
like that.

00:36:24.744 --> 00:36:27.925
And they just believed them.

00:36:27.925 --> 00:36:34.284
And so they said, “Now you are finished,
because you're no more belonging to Hindu

00:36:34.284 --> 00:36:37.134
religion or to any other religion.

00:36:37.134 --> 00:36:39.504
So now you have become Christian.”

00:36:39.504 --> 00:36:47.975
And that's how they made thousands and thousands
of people Christians who were actually downtrodden

00:36:47.975 --> 00:36:53.014
people, I should say - at least, they would
call themselves downtrodden.

00:36:53.014 --> 00:37:02.655
Now all these downtrodden people, they wanted
to have converted to Christianity, because

00:37:02.655 --> 00:37:17.605
they thought - you see, it is, they all wanted
all such people who would just follow the

00:37:17.605 --> 00:37:23.964
missionaries, and who would not question.

00:37:23.964 --> 00:37:31.964
Because they were not educated people, they're
not people of any understanding or intelligence

00:37:31.964 --> 00:37:34.805
to understand what these people are.

00:37:34.805 --> 00:37:42.665
So when they started this tirade against the
downtrodden people, so many of them joined.

00:37:42.665 --> 00:37:54.254
Thus they formed their own race and they started
their religion there.

00:37:54.254 --> 00:38:00.974
This is a thing one should understand, how
the dominating nature of people accepted a

00:38:00.974 --> 00:38:09.964
particular religion, because that religion
is nothing but humility.

00:38:09.964 --> 00:38:19.984
And how then these people supposed to be in
charge of Christianity, converted people into

00:38:19.984 --> 00:38:22.395
something absurd.

00:38:22.395 --> 00:38:33.895
You see it is a human nature, it can enjoy
any nonsense, any kind of cruelty, any kind

00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:35.194
of oppression.

00:38:35.194 --> 00:38:44.145
It can never give up that realm, that area
where they have been dominating.

00:38:44.145 --> 00:38:54.415
Now as it is, the Christian nations have gone
even beyond that, because among the Christians

00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:57.935
it is all the freedom given to them.

00:38:57.935 --> 00:38:59.115
They're liberated.

00:38:59.115 --> 00:39:05.014
Do whatever you may like, if you will become
Christian.

00:39:05.014 --> 00:39:07.965
They're all right, isn’t it?

00:39:07.965 --> 00:39:16.024
They are the ones who have been dominating,
and those who are dominated are there everywhere.

00:39:16.024 --> 00:39:26.254
They would go to people, ordinary people whom
you can call as aboriginals, and convert them.

00:39:26.254 --> 00:39:28.545
Theirs main method was to convert.

00:39:28.545 --> 00:39:32.795
What was the need to convert so many people?

00:39:32.795 --> 00:39:39.075
Because in democracy it is important that
the number you have should be large.

00:39:39.075 --> 00:39:47.714
So to gain the number, they used to convert.

00:39:47.714 --> 00:39:53.944
And they have ruined so many people.

00:39:53.944 --> 00:40:04.784
It’s really, the whole situation of Christ
really makes Me feel very nervous.

00:40:04.784 --> 00:40:08.464
Today you all are Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:08.464 --> 00:40:14.974
You are all so much higher than others.

00:40:14.974 --> 00:40:20.865
You have all the powers.

00:40:20.865 --> 00:40:28.865
And then supposing you want to behave like
the Christians, I don't know what you will

00:40:28.865 --> 00:40:29.865
do.

00:40:29.865 --> 00:40:38.795
So now you are on the verge where Sahaja Yoga
is accepted in different countries, and there

00:40:38.795 --> 00:40:46.424
people respect people who are Sahaja Yogis,
they have given positions.

00:40:46.424 --> 00:40:54.444
Then suddenly you might get this power business
into your head and you may try, you may try

00:40:54.444 --> 00:41:04.075
to become like a despot, because that is human
nature.

00:41:04.075 --> 00:41:10.065
That's not divine, but that's a human nature.

00:41:10.065 --> 00:41:24.115
For example, when in the kingdom of, we can
say of the animals, they are aggressive on

00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:29.355
each other, it's all right, it's permitted,
it is done.

00:41:29.355 --> 00:41:34.885
But there's a system, there's a way, there's
a method how they dominate.

00:41:34.885 --> 00:41:38.125
It's not like this: they jump on everyone.

00:41:38.125 --> 00:41:44.185
But I've seen in Sahaja Yoga many people,
you make them a leader - finished.

00:41:44.185 --> 00:41:47.464
Then he sits on everybody's head.

00:41:47.464 --> 00:41:51.875
If you don't make them a leader then they
go on writing letters to Me, one after another,

00:41:51.875 --> 00:41:55.095
that “Mother, we want to be leader.

00:41:55.095 --> 00:41:57.465
I want to be a leader.”

00:41:57.465 --> 00:42:00.575
Like this they go on insisting on this.

00:42:00.575 --> 00:42:05.065
For what do you want to be the leader?

00:42:05.065 --> 00:42:07.465
Just to dominate others.

00:42:07.465 --> 00:42:12.754
And this domination business is not meant
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:12.754 --> 00:42:25.764
I am here today to tell you about, about a
beautiful image of Christ, who rose above

00:42:25.764 --> 00:42:26.905
death.

00:42:26.905 --> 00:42:44.214
In the same way let the death of all nonsensical
ideas, all negative thoughts, everything has

00:42:44.214 --> 00:42:47.825
to be overcome.

00:42:47.825 --> 00:42:56.784
You have to be the lord of yourself, and in
that you should feel so comforted, so happy.

00:42:56.784 --> 00:43:07.555
In giving others, you’ll find it very much
easier than taking something from others.

00:43:07.555 --> 00:43:16.984
It’s very, very surprising how Sahaja Yoga
has taught you all these things.

00:43:16.984 --> 00:43:27.145
In Sahaj Yog people have to say that “They
are very wonderful, they are very beautiful

00:43:27.145 --> 00:43:28.145
people.

00:43:28.145 --> 00:43:34.465
They are very loving, they are very kind.”

00:43:34.465 --> 00:43:46.205
I want to, I want to hear that all the time
about them, about you all, that you all are

00:43:46.205 --> 00:43:53.974
individually or collectively, you are something
outstandingly great.

00:43:53.974 --> 00:44:07.835
But this greatness is not by domination or
by showing off, but it is coming from within.

00:44:07.835 --> 00:44:10.395
People see you and know it is something.

00:44:10.395 --> 00:44:13.115
And that is how Sahaja Yoga is going to spread.

00:44:13.115 --> 00:44:20.924
It is the Christ within you has to arise,
Christ within you has to guide.

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:30.805
It is Christ within you who will teach how
to behave towards others, and how to gain

00:44:30.805 --> 00:44:38.705
their confidence and give them the love and
peace that you have now flowing within you,

00:44:38.705 --> 00:44:44.744
to make them very, very happy and joyous people.

00:44:44.744 --> 00:44:47.675
This is the message of resurrection.

00:44:47.675 --> 00:44:52.514
This is the message of breaking the Sahasrara.

00:44:52.514 --> 00:45:02.234
So this egg which was described in the - very
surprising, very clearly described in "Devi

00:45:02.234 --> 00:45:09.135
Mahatmayam," how this egg was formed and was
broken into two, and from one part of the

00:45:09.135 --> 00:45:12.045
egg came out Christ.

00:45:12.045 --> 00:45:15.684
Another part was Shri Ganesha.

00:45:15.684 --> 00:45:25.575
It’s all written down, but this Christ is
described as Mahavishnu, not as Christ, so

00:45:25.575 --> 00:45:34.075
this Mahavishnu then rose and He does all
these, all wonderful things.

00:45:34.075 --> 00:45:46.855
It’s a real message beautifully written
by the life of Christ, that now as we are

00:45:46.855 --> 00:45:58.164
thoughtlessly aware now, we have to express
that light through our lives, and we have

00:45:58.164 --> 00:46:09.545
to show to the world that we are quite capable,
and that only we are within ourselves absolutely

00:46:09.545 --> 00:46:10.545
complete.

00:46:10.545 --> 00:46:13.504
We don’t want anything from others.

00:46:13.504 --> 00:46:18.954
What we want now, to give whatever we have
achieved to others.

00:46:18.954 --> 00:46:27.575
This is what people are looking at you, and
at all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:27.575 --> 00:46:34.494
May God bless you.

00:46:34.494 --> 00:46:49.635
Thinking of Christ, I find it impossible to
keep awake even because, to keep in these

00:46:49.635 --> 00:47:01.585
modern times, it's very difficult when you
are thinking of Christ and talking about Him.

00:47:01.585 --> 00:47:12.774
It just, something shows that how people never
understood such a great man, such a great

00:47:12.774 --> 00:47:13.774
personality.

00:47:13.774 --> 00:47:17.655
And He was Divine, absolutely Divine; despite
that He made a drama, we should say, to go

00:47:17.655 --> 00:47:19.984
through all the sufferings.

00:47:19.984 --> 00:47:33.774
It's very painful, even to remember all that:
how He crucified Himself and how He died.

00:47:33.774 --> 00:47:44.284
But the main point is this: He's done for
you, for all of you, and you are so indebted

00:47:44.284 --> 00:47:45.284
to Him.

00:47:45.284 --> 00:47:56.885
It is His work which has helped the Kundalini
to be awakened and could pass through this

00:47:56.885 --> 00:47:59.254
fontanelle bone area.

00:47:59.254 --> 00:48:05.515
All this would have been impossible without
the sacrifice of Christ.

00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:15.534
You all should thus deserve to have some sacrifices.

00:48:15.534 --> 00:48:21.625
See, this is a very symbolic thing that has
happened.

00:48:21.625 --> 00:48:32.705
And you all should be all the time prepared
to sacrifice whatever is possible, for the

00:48:32.705 --> 00:48:35.305
emancipation of humanity.

00:48:35.305 --> 00:48:40.345
It's very, very subtle at this moment now.

00:48:40.345 --> 00:48:44.895
Forget about your seeking, forget about everything.

00:48:44.949 --> 00:48:57.329
What is needed is that you have to remember
all the time that you are saved, you are being

00:48:57.379 --> 00:49:01.599
blessed, by the sacrifices of Christ.

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:04.109
It's very important.

00:49:04.139 --> 00:49:09.028
May God bless you all.
