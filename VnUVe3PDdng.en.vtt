00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.762
But the real spirituality, if you have,

00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:13.085
the protection will be always there,

00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:16.641
and Shiva will be very blissful.

00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:20.004
It’s extremely blissful.

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:26.044
And what does he give you is even more beautiful

00:00:26.165 --> 00:00:28.327
than you could think of.

00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:33.964
He is extremely forgiving.

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:37.802
I should say he is the source of such forgiveness.

00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:44.601
If you have forgiveness in your heart, he resides in your heart.¶

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:54.923
Otherwise, gradually, you start developing

00:00:56.044 --> 00:01:01.206
very difficult types of diseases.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.762
Say, if you are forgiving, your heart runs very fast.

00:01:09.883 --> 00:01:16.560
No-one can touch your heart. You cannot get heart-attacks.

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:24.641
But if you are tolerating, suffering

00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:34.641
and taking many things as a power of your own,

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:41.246
doing wrong things and forgetting about God,

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:48.520
then you also start developing a very weak heart.

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:52.762
So one side is that you develop a heart

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:58.762
which is extremely aggressive,

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:04.367
and can become like Hitler’s heart.

00:02:05.286 --> 00:02:12.520
Under any kind of pretensions, if you start torturing someone,

00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:16.246
your heart becomes solid

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:20.762
and then you can get a tremendous massive heart-attack,

00:02:20.883 --> 00:02:23.923
and all the troubles from that.

00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:28.923
This is inevitable.

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:34.843
But supposing you are extremely tolerant

00:02:34.964 --> 00:02:39.843
and you tolerate all nonsense, you are very docile,

00:02:39.964 --> 00:02:43.206
you are a frightened person.

00:02:43.327 --> 00:02:47.964
If you are frightened, then because of fright you do that,

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:53.246
you can develop another kind of a heart we call as angina

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:55.802
where the blood supply is less,

00:02:55.923 --> 00:03:01.802
and ultimately you develop a kind of guilt and

00:03:01.923 --> 00:03:06.883
you lead a very mediocre life.¶

00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:14.004
So this second thing also is very visible

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:19.399
among people who think they are very, very tolerant.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.165
I am saying that tolerance is alright,

00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:26.883
because of Spirituality,

00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:30.439
but not because you are frightened,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.085
and you are afraid of something.

00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:38.560
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have no business to be

00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:41.125
afraid of anything.

00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:46.165
In India people are afraid of everything!

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:50.439
If they can see a squirrel, they will be frightened.

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.762
If they see a lizard – finished!

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.641
I mean they are afraid of anything,

00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:06.762
and the ladies in India are so afraid of even cockroaches!

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:11.964
This kind of temperament is absolutely stupid!

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:21.004
Because that makes you a kind of a person who is prone to angina.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.004
What is there to be afraid of?

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:27.327
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and Sahaja Yogini,

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:31.004
you are not to be afraid of anything.

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:34.206
They are afraid of rats,

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.246
all kinds of nonsense and they boast of it,

00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:40.480
and they talk about it.

00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:46.004
Here the heart is becoming weak and weak and weak.¶

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:51.520
Also, I must say, the Indian men are responsible for that.

00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:54.480
Because they treat their women as

00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:59.125
if they are appendages or some sort of a liability,

00:04:59.246 --> 00:05:01.641
I don’t know what they think they are.

00:05:01.762 --> 00:05:07.367
Their behaviour is so bad, unbelievable!

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.206
Especially in north India, I have seen, women have no position.

00:05:13.327 --> 00:05:18.560
The woman is brought in the house, kept in the house,

00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:22.125
just like a maidservant,

00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:25.286
she has to cover he face all the time,

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:31.439
she doesn’t have to go out anywhere without permission.

00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:33.520
It’s terrible!

00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:37.923
Some people say it is a Muslim influence or whatever it is.

00:05:38.044 --> 00:05:47.964
But when you believe in eternal life, in spiritual life,

00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:57.367
you should not be governed by any such nonsensical atrocities.¶

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:02.004
And that’s why I feel

00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:06.560
that you really need the emancipation of women in India.

00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:12.802
They are very good, they are very tolerant, they are very sweet,

00:06:12.923 --> 00:06:21.367
but they develop all the bad diseases, all the mental diseases,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.923
because they don’t know their own value,

00:06:26.044 --> 00:06:29.327
they don’t know their own self-respect.

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:33.762
And on this I have already spoken at length.

00:06:33.883 --> 00:06:37.165
Whey should men behave like that?

00:06:37.762 --> 00:06:45.165
I think in our country, we have at least seventy percent are women;

00:06:45.843 --> 00:06:52.246
and seventy percent people’s energy is wasted in the north India.

00:06:53.085 --> 00:06:56.480
I don’t know what they think of themselves.

00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:59.560
And then they are punished.

00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:03.802
All such countries can never prosper,

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:07.843
because women are the Laxmis.

00:07:08.286 --> 00:07:11.399
But they have to be Laxmis also,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.480
they have to behave like Laxmis.

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:19.560
But some of them come up like this that you are shocked.

00:07:19.802 --> 00:07:24.165
How can they be women, they look like devils?

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.044
So such an imbalance in the society

00:07:29.165 --> 00:07:33.883
which is punished, again, by Shri Mahadeva.¶

00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:38.964
He is very kind,

00:07:39.085 --> 00:07:42.964
and he looks after the people who have to suffer it.

00:07:43.085 --> 00:07:47.762
And he tries to punish people who make them suffer.

00:07:48.246 --> 00:07:53.681
It is his quality to help

00:07:53.802 --> 00:07:59.601
by destroying people who are aggressive.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:03.601
He doesn’t talk of any Kundalini,

00:08:03.722 --> 00:08:06.560
he doesn’t talk of Self Realisation,

00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:10.004
he just punishes them, nicely!

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:14.762
In such a bad way that it’s shocking!

00:08:14.883 --> 00:08:18.286
And he relieves sometimes people like

00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:24.641
– I have seen many women who live like this, suffer so much.

00:08:24.762 --> 00:08:30.125
They die much earlier than their ages.

00:08:30.762 --> 00:08:38.439
All this one has to see in the right perspective.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.883
He’s there to protect, of course,

00:08:44.004 --> 00:08:47.165
but more to destroy.

00:08:47.367 --> 00:08:53.399
He protects all kinds of animals, all birds,

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.165
all the nature, he protects.

00:08:58.125 --> 00:09:05.560
He is the one who brings all the joy,

00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:09.367
all the joy of spirituality.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:16.802
But if you try to become aggressive,

00:09:18.246 --> 00:09:22.641
then he is the one who will destroy.

00:09:23.004 --> 00:09:29.125
Sometimes he gives more long rope to hang,

00:09:29.246 --> 00:09:31.367
and so people think we are alright,

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.286
they are satisfied with themselves.¶

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:36.923
On the contrary, in the west I find,

00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:40.601
the women are ruling the men more than the men.

00:09:40.722 --> 00:09:42.802
Very surprising.

00:09:42.923 --> 00:09:46.286
I don’t know how they have handled the situation,

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:48.964
but they are ruling, all the time,

00:09:49.085 --> 00:09:51.964
and the men have to be under their thumb

00:09:52.085 --> 00:09:54.681
– I don’t know how they have managed it –

00:09:54.802 --> 00:09:59.206
but they do it! They are not humble.

00:09:59.327 --> 00:10:01.964
They don’t love,

00:10:02.085 --> 00:10:06.286
and they go on divorcing their husbands all the time.

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:09.601
They do not love!

00:10:09.722 --> 00:10:12.206
They don’t know what is love is.

00:10:12.327 --> 00:10:18.923
But also, I have seen men don’t understand what love is in India.

00:10:19.044 --> 00:10:21.367
They don’t know how to love

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.399
their wives, which is a life-partner.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.044
How to respect, they don’t understand.

00:10:31.165 --> 00:10:36.165
There, then comes a great wrath,

00:10:36.286 --> 00:10:40.802
and this wrath works in so many ways,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.641
in creating horrible diseases

00:10:44.762 --> 00:10:52.206
and in creating problems and problems for such men.¶

00:10:57.843 --> 00:11:02.681
And the society also is responsible

00:11:02.802 --> 00:11:10.085
for doing all kinds of things against humble people.

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:18.641
Both ways, one has to understand, that if you are aggressive,

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:25.601
you are under the Third Eye of Shri Mahadeva.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.923
In any way if you are aggressive, say with your servants,

00:11:32.044 --> 00:11:35.883
if you are aggressive with your subordinates,

00:11:36.004 --> 00:11:41.601
if you are aggressive with your children,

00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:48.085
there is this wrathful God watching,

00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:55.560
and one can get under the spell of his destruction.¶

00:11:57.165 --> 00:12:03.843
But he gives us the great heights of Himalaya.

00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:14.165
He makes human beings extremely beautiful, very noble,

00:12:14.762 --> 00:12:20.560
and he wants that people should love each other.

00:12:21.206 --> 00:12:25.327
There should be pure love among human beings.

00:12:26.165 --> 00:12:37.802
And also he makes you, very delicately,

00:12:40.439 --> 00:12:43.601
behaving towards other people;

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:48.641
very sweetly behaving towards others.

00:12:49.206 --> 00:12:57.327
If you don’t have that, then you are going in the wrong direction.

00:12:57.439 --> 00:13:00.125
But his greatest privilege,

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:05.044
that he gives you the height and the depth.

00:13:05.722 --> 00:13:13.923
If you are worshipping him, then you develop such heights

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:18.337
that you see the whole world as a witness.¶
