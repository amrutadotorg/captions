1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,840
Now I get many letters saying, ‘Mataji, let the love flow from our hearts.’

2
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,695
Now how am I supposed to do that?

3
00:00:13,776 --> 00:00:20,624
First open your hearts. I will tell you how to open your hearts

4
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:27,912
How to open your hearts starts with a small thing.

5
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:34,762
Make a list of the people whom you love and whom you hate.

6
00:00:34,843 --> 00:00:44,190
Then write a loving letter to the ones whom you hate…

7
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,079
Very difficult thing! Extremely difficult!

8
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:58,198
Write to them saying, ‘ I remember you a lot as you are great.’

9
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:03,682
It is ok even if they are not, nothing wrong in saying so!

10
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:12,798
Then say,’ I will feel very nice if you send an answer to this letter.’ Try it out

11
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:18,518
It will work out because the Spirit has made you capable of that love

12
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,524
There should be no superficiality. He should not feel that ,

13
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:25,262
’Oh, today he has sent a good letter
so tomorrow’s is going to be horrible.

14
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:29,127
This first letter is an introduction to what will follow! '

15
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:36,102
So, you should send a heartfelt letter full of love

16
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:41,789
Send to those people whom you hate or feel bad about.

17
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:48,004
But start with Sahaja yogis. Firstly, they should be Sahaja yogis

18
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,619
But you will be surprised that
when you write for the first time,

19
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,616
there will be at least one line
expressing that anger of the past.

20
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:05,620
So write one more, then a third and after a hundred letters,

21
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:11,355
there will be at least one letter where this anger is not at all expressed.

22
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:16,392
We should open our hearts to the person with whom we are angry.

23
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:19,588
We should see, what he did, am I also doing?

24
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:22,968
If you have done, then what is the need to be angry?

25
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:29,188
If he has behaved like that then I won’t behave in the same way.

26
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:32,203
In reality, you must love him.
