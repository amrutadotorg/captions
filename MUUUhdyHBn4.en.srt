1
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:42,885
We all have today gathered here

2
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:46,801
on top of this beautiful mountain,

3
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:52,218
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

4
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:57,177
It’s very significant for Sahaja yogis

5
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:03,594
to understand the great event of His resurrection,

6
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,968
by which He showed

7
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:11,634
that the spirit does not die.

8
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:16,427
He was – He was the Omkara,

9
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:21,177
He was the Logos and He was the Spirit,

10
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:27,344
and that is why He could walk on the water.

11
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:33,218
And also now we have made a film

12
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,801
where we have shown how the Mooladhara,

13
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:42,344
which shows the carbon atom,

14
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:46,634
as clearly if you see from right to the left,

15
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,594
you find a proper swastika there;

16
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:56,344
and left to the right we see Omkara.

17
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:59,344
But when you see from down below upward,

18
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:03,344
what you see is alpha and omega.

19
00:16:03,926 --> 00:16:08,218
That proves beyond doubt that Christ, as He said,

20
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,885
“I am the Alpha and I am the Omega,”

21
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:18,760
shows clearly that He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

22
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:23,135
It’s a scientific proof we have now with us,

23
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:29,135
and that’s how we can tell people that it’s a fact.

24
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:34,093
I don’t know at the time of Christ

25
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:38,260
this alpha and omega was known to the mathematicians,

26
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:40,885
but definitely to Him

27
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:46,010
when He said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

28
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,052
His was an incarnation very remarkable,

29
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:04,760
and very important for our ascent.

30
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:09,676
If He had not resurrected Himself,

31
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:14,218
we could not have achieved our ascent at all.

32
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:17,635
So it’s a great contribution.

33
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:22,885
The resurrection of Christ is evident now in your own life:

34
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,843
what you were before

35
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:30,427
and what you are today.

36
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,344
It is such a change,

37
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,885
such a difference,

38
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:42,135
such a transformation.

39
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,594
It is His own sacrifice

40
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:48,510
on the cross

41
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,510
and His own

42
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:55,552
beautiful resurrection

43
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:59,052
has created a way for all of us

44
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:04,634
to get into this new transformed state.

45
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:15,260
In this state is a different story for human beings,

46
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:18,093
and a different for Christ.

47
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:20,510
Christ was Himself

48
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:25,010
was holiness, was purity.

49
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:28,968
So His resurrection

50
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:35,718
is nothing but just a physical happening, we can say,

51
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:41,218
because He did not need transformation,

52
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:44,801
He did not

53
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:49,594
have to go through any cleansing.

54
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:54,385
But what happened in His case

55
00:18:55,052 --> 00:19:00,177
was that He became

56
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:04,843
resurrected from death

57
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:09,885
– symbolizes the life of human beings without spirituality

58
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,843
is like a death;

59
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,218
because they do everything

60
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:21,177
without any understanding about the totality,

61
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:24,552
about the reality,

62
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:27,926
about the absolute truth.

63
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,510
Whatever they do ultimately

64
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:35,010
takes them to their destruction.

65
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,010
Even the religions which are established

66
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:42,469
by these great incarnations

67
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:47,260
are absolutely on a decline.

68
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:51,635
You do not find any trace of religious life

69
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:53,552
with all those people

70
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:56,760
who claim that they are the ones

71
00:19:57,093 --> 00:20:00,885
who can represent those incarnations.

72
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:04,635
If you see in a subtle way

73
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:06,968
it’s very painful also,

74
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:11,469
that in the name of all these great incarnations

75
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,385
the kind of work people are doing,

76
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:19,344
the activities that they take to is something impossible,

77
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,634
because they have no fear of God.

78
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,135
In the name of God they’re doing all these horrible things

79
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:28,135
all over the world.

80
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:29,552
Of course here,

81
00:20:29,843 --> 00:20:31,760
you can say Catholic Church has been exposed.

82
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:34,010
Everywhere people are seeing

83
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:37,676
all these false things have been exposed.

84
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:41,926
But these false things they have used

85
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:46,385
under a garb of God,

86
00:20:46,676 --> 00:20:49,594
spirituality and beauty.

87
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,218
That’s the best way you can hide.

88
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,718
All the cruelty, all the violence,

89
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:02,552
all the ugliness

90
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:05,885
– this is how they have worked it out.

91
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,968
And it has gone into such a state

92
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:13,385
that you do not find the slightest

93
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:18,260
even tinge of religious life among these people.

94
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,676
Like all the thieves of the world,

95
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,968
all the great crooks of the world

96
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:26,968
and all the intriguers of the world has taken over.

97
00:21:29,218 --> 00:21:33,510
It’s only because what was written in all the books

98
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:37,676
and all the scriptures that you have to seek yourself,

99
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:40,635
was never done.

100
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:45,634
“You have to know yourself” was never done.

101
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,469
How many times Christ has said, “Know thyself.”

102
00:21:49,885 --> 00:21:52,260
He also said that “You are to be born again”

103
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:55,552
– so immediately they take a certificate, “I am born again”

104
00:21:55,926 --> 00:22:01,385
and start taking advantage of that kind of a certificate.

105
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:05,676
But they don’t think that actually

106
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:08,635
what benevolence it has given them.

107
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:10,885
At the most they might have made some money,

108
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:14,676
at the most they might have had some superficial powers;

109
00:22:15,052 --> 00:22:21,052
but it has done nothing, if you see from a innate nature.

110
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:27,801
One must pity their insanity,

111
00:22:28,552 --> 00:22:32,260
the way they have taken to Christ’s life

112
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:34,177
or to anybody else’s life

113
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:38,885
of such a noble and a higher value system,

114
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:45,385
and are doing all very low-graded things.

115
00:22:47,344 --> 00:22:52,552
In Sahaja Yoga now you have transformed yourself.

116
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:56,718
I would say your kundalini has done the job.

117
00:22:57,385 --> 00:23:01,427
But still the difference between Christ and you is this,

118
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:06,427
that you are coming from that environment,

119
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,634
that style of life,

120
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,260
that kind of thinking

121
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,843
which was all for your destruction.

122
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:19,510
Everything if you see now is for your destruction.

123
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,552
So when you’re coming out of it,

124
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,010
still these things hang over,

125
00:23:26,427 --> 00:23:31,385
still you get affected by them.

126
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:34,594
Even when you’re rising higher and higher,

127
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:38,177
you find suddenly you are again pushed down

128
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,052
to some sort of a funny situation,

129
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:46,843
to some sort of a degrading things.

130
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,302
Of course, sometimes you are shocked at yourself;

131
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:53,552
sometimes you accept all that.

132
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,344
So for a Sahaja yogi it is very important

133
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:58,427
that after coming to realization

134
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:01,843
he has to be very introspective.

135
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,093
Instead of seeing the bad of others,

136
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:08,218
he should try to see what is bad in within himself.

137
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,968
It’s very important that you have to know

138
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:17,302
how far you are going towards your spirituality.

139
00:24:17,968 --> 00:24:22,177
Because Christ did not need this,

140
00:24:22,801 --> 00:24:26,510
He did not have to even introspect Himself.

141
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:33,344
He was something which was beyond any corruption,

142
00:24:34,218 --> 00:24:40,510
and for Him it was just a physical transformation,

143
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:43,177
on the sense that from He died

144
00:24:43,634 --> 00:24:46,676
and then He resurrected Himself.

145
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:50,385
But for us it is very different.

146
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:53,801
We are now Sahaja yogis,

147
00:24:54,177 --> 00:24:57,676
but we were ordinary human beings.

148
00:24:58,093 --> 00:25:00,552
We had no light within us.

149
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:02,968
Now the light comes within us

150
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:05,634
and we see the light,

151
00:25:05,968 --> 00:25:09,344
then what do we become?

152
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:13,218
We have to become the light itself.

153
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,385
Christ was the light.

154
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,302
He did not have to become.

155
00:25:17,635 --> 00:25:19,635
So we have to become the light.

156
00:25:19,926 --> 00:25:23,843
And now you have to guard on

157
00:25:24,718 --> 00:25:28,302
the way this light might get disturbed,

158
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:33,968
might be reduced, or may be completely extinguished.

159
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:40,093
So carrying on yourself with this light,

160
00:25:40,427 --> 00:25:42,801
first thing you should know that

161
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:45,469
if you see the light, is not proper

162
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:47,135
– means you are not the light.

163
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,968
You have to become the light.

164
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,801
When you are the light,

165
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,843
then in that light you can easily see

166
00:25:57,177 --> 00:25:59,676
how your mind works,

167
00:26:00,177 --> 00:26:02,260
what ideas it gives,

168
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:09,177
what affects your mind

169
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,843
while you’re ascending.

170
00:26:12,177 --> 00:26:14,093
Is this the worry

171
00:26:14,385 --> 00:26:19,885
or is this the responsibility that you have?

172
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,510
Or is this from the bad habits you had,

173
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:26,676
that there is an impediment

174
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:32,177
in your growth as a spiritual personality?

175
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:35,634
So you have to guard yourself all the time,

176
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:41,010
and see for yourself how you are progressing.

177
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,510
It’s a very beautiful journey

178
00:26:45,885 --> 00:26:47,594
– very, very beautiful journey.

179
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:50,260
Yesterday I was very much happy to hear

180
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:55,260
the song of the Russians who describe about the journey,

181
00:26:56,427 --> 00:27:01,510
the journey of kundalini.

182
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:11,218
This is true, no doubt, that you are a realized soul.

183
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:17,594
Basically you were not a realized soul,

184
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:20,843
but now you are a realized soul.

185
00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:23,218
You are a evolved state.

186
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:29,427
Now what is missing is the idea

187
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:34,843
that we are absolutely all right

188
00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:39,635
and nothing can harm us, nothing can bring us down.

189
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:45,676
If you develop such an egoistical idea,

190
00:27:46,177 --> 00:27:48,843
it’s not going to help you at all.

191
00:27:49,344 --> 00:27:52,344
What you have to do is to

192
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:54,968
all the time introspect yourself.

193
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:57,552
That’s what is meditation for,

194
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,469
to see for yourself

195
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:03,926
how you are keeping up

196
00:28:04,427 --> 00:28:07,594
your spiritual ascent.

197
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:09,510
No one else can do it,

198
00:28:09,926 --> 00:28:12,344
it’s your own individual work.

199
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:14,594
Of course, if you go to the collective, immediately

200
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:17,635
they will know what chakras you are catching, no doubt.

201
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,760
They may not say, they may not refer it,

202
00:28:22,177 --> 00:28:23,634
but they will know definitely

203
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,760
that such-and-such chakra is catching

204
00:28:26,177 --> 00:28:28,093
and this person has this problem.

205
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:33,218
But they won’t know themselves what they are catching,

206
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,718
what is their problem is.

207
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,177
So if somebody tells you

208
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,427
that “I think this chakra is catching in you,”

209
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,427
you should never, never feel bad about it,

210
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,469
because by keeping that chakra intact

211
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,676
you are ruining your own life.

212
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:54,634
So what you have to do is to see

213
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,760
that if somebody tells you that

214
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:01,052
“I think this chakra is, there’s something wrong,”

215
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:04,010
you should thank that person, “Thank God you’ve told me.”

216
00:29:04,427 --> 00:29:07,010
Like a mirror – if you see in the mirror

217
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:09,552
there’s something wrong with your face,

218
00:29:09,843 --> 00:29:11,260
you can immediately correct it.

219
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:15,260
In the same way if somebody points it out to you,

220
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:19,052
you have to be mature enough that you should know

221
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:21,052
that it is a great blessing

222
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:24,552
that such thing has been pointed out to you.

223
00:29:25,552 --> 00:29:27,218
Like the other day there was some quarrel

224
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:28,968
between the two leaders.

225
00:29:29,344 --> 00:29:31,801
Always – there are two leaders, always there are quarrels.

226
00:29:32,093 --> 00:29:33,385
There should not be.

227
00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:37,177
It’s like two eyes never fight, two hands don’t fight,

228
00:29:37,552 --> 00:29:38,843
two legs do not fight.

229
00:29:39,218 --> 00:29:42,135
But if there are two leaders, there’s always a problem.

230
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:46,676
You have to have always one leader, otherwise big problem.

231
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:50,260
So they were arguing among themselves, you see,

232
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:55,218
two leaders arguing among themselves, and they came to Me.

233
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:59,260
Immediately I saw one of them was absolutely caught up.

234
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:01,926
I said, “You put your hands towards Me.”

235
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:03,926
When he puts his hand towards Me,

236
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,218
immediately he pushed it back. “What happened?”

237
00:30:07,552 --> 00:30:09,760
He said, “I’m getting burning sensation, Mother.”

238
00:30:10,135 --> 00:30:13,968
I said, “That’s it. Now, do you know what’s wrong with you?”

239
00:30:14,344 --> 00:30:16,469
He says, “I’m very hot-tempered, that I know.

240
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:20,510
I’m very egoistical. I should not have behaved like this.”

241
00:30:21,344 --> 00:30:26,594
But at the same time he could have felt very bad,

242
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:29,510
because I said it to him.

243
00:30:30,135 --> 00:30:33,093
But he did not because he’s a Sahaja yogi

244
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:35,427
and he knows what is benevolent for him,

245
00:30:35,843 --> 00:30:36,885
what is good for him.

246
00:30:37,177 --> 00:30:38,635
He did not feel bad at all.

247
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,135
On the contrary, he was so thankful to Me that

248
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,302
“Mother, because of You I have been found out.

249
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:49,052
Otherwise I was hiding it within my heart.”

250
00:30:56,052 --> 00:30:59,635
Now, the problem with us is that

251
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:04,260
we have achieved a lot of development within ourself,

252
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:07,760
and we have consolidated it.

253
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,260
Also, we have a great collective force,

254
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,135
I can see, in every country.

255
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:16,302
We can give realizations to so many,

256
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,302
and we can really establish

257
00:31:19,718 --> 00:31:24,427
all these great truths in our lives.

258
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,260
We can do it.

259
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:30,135
All the time we should establish them.

260
00:31:30,926 --> 00:31:34,302
But there is one point

261
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:37,760
on which one should not be very sure:

262
00:31:38,218 --> 00:31:44,385
that you have absolutely reached the last truth.

263
00:31:45,385 --> 00:31:48,052
You have to be careful on this point very much.

264
00:31:48,469 --> 00:31:54,260
I have seen people who go very high in Sahaja Yoga,

265
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:59,344
come up very high, and suddenly they go down very low.

266
00:32:00,427 --> 00:32:03,760
Makes Me very sad, extremely sad.

267
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:07,552
The reason is that they have no faith

268
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:14,510
– faith in themself and faith in Sahaj.

269
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:18,594
This is the faith which is missing.

270
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:23,801
You have to have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaj.

271
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:28,760
Sahaj means there is the divine Power,

272
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:37,093
and this all-pervading divine Power is looking after us.

273
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,801
It is now felt also, you have felt it.

274
00:32:45,135 --> 00:32:46,926
It’s not that only by saying it’s there

275
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,344
– you have known that it is so.

276
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,344
But even knowing that,

277
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:55,177
it has not become such a faith within you.

278
00:32:55,635 --> 00:32:59,427
But this is the faith about Christ has talked.

279
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:02,302
This is the faith with an enlightened mind,

280
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:04,135
not the blind faith.

281
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:07,968
And with the blind you might make mistakes,

282
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,510
while with the enlightened one if you have faith

283
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:17,760
you become extremely powerful, extremely powerful.

284
00:33:18,218 --> 00:33:20,385
There cannot be any problems

285
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,218
if your faith is enlightened.

286
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,885
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga

287
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:31,718
many people who are very steady,

288
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:36,635
who are upright,

289
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,510
who are very valuable.

290
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,843
They are like the people

291
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:45,385
who know they are standing on the rocks.

292
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:49,968
But those who are not yet so steady are the people,

293
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,385
they think they are still dwindling

294
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,469
on some sort of a funny waters of this life.

295
00:34:01,594 --> 00:34:05,676
The rocks have been there, you’re standing on the rocks;

296
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:10,302
and also that has come out of faith

297
00:34:10,635 --> 00:34:13,801
that nothing can disturb us, that faith,

298
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,801
nothing can trouble us.

299
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:20,635
As far as Christ is concerned, naturally,

300
00:34:21,052 --> 00:34:22,718
I mean, He knew everything,

301
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:25,135
so He was sure about it.

302
00:34:25,634 --> 00:34:29,302
He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never doubted.

303
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,344
He knew that, that He is the Son of God,

304
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,385
and that was the fact that He knew very well.

305
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:39,552
And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing.

306
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:41,801
It is so.

307
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,469
And that’s why He, I say, was standing on the rocks;

308
00:34:46,926 --> 00:34:50,302
while the other people,

309
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,926
even Sahaja yogis,

310
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:58,594
have to become like Christ

311
00:34:58,926 --> 00:35:01,843
as far as the faith is concerned.

312
00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:06,801
This faith is to be understood.

313
00:35:07,676 --> 00:35:10,427
This is an enlightened faith.

314
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:15,135
Like Christ – He went into crucifixion,

315
00:35:15,552 --> 00:35:18,010
He went into all kinds of things,

316
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:22,427
just because He knew it was just a drama

317
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,052
and He was doing all this just in a drama, playing;

318
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,801
and there’s nothing serious,

319
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,968
nothing is going to matter,

320
00:35:33,302 --> 00:35:34,801
and that He’s going to resurrect Himself.

321
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:37,427
He played the drama.

322
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:41,385
To Him it was nothing very serious.

323
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:47,634
He saw people making fun of Him, mocking at Him.

324
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,385
He also in His heart knew everything that

325
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,760
“These people who are mocking don’t know what I am.”

326
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:01,634
But at the same time,

327
00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:05,552
He was the embodiment of faith:

328
00:36:06,052 --> 00:36:10,552
faith in Himself

329
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:14,634
and in this all-pervading Power.

330
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:18,344
This never lets you down,

331
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:23,718
but for that you have to have absolute faith.

332
00:36:24,427 --> 00:36:29,177
Supposing I have someone on whom I have faith,

333
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:34,510
naturally I will give him all the work,

334
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,427
I will trust everything,

335
00:36:37,843 --> 00:36:40,760
I’ll keep the keys with him or the money with him,

336
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:44,385
never doubt such a person.

337
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:50,801
In the same way if you have faith – faith in yourself,

338
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:58,260
faith in Sahaja Yoga where you are established

339
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:03,177
– you’ll be surprised how things will work out,

340
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:06,760
how life will improve

341
00:37:07,218 --> 00:37:12,344
and you will be standing on the rocks, you’ll feel that way.

342
00:37:12,885 --> 00:37:15,177
You’ll have no doubts,

343
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:20,302
you’ll have no problems, no diseases.

344
00:37:22,926 --> 00:37:27,093
So, this is such a state

345
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:29,344
– only with faith.

346
00:37:29,843 --> 00:37:32,594
But now this faith, how do you get?

347
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:37,177
The problem is, how to get to this faith?

348
00:37:37,552 --> 00:37:38,968
There’s no course about it,

349
00:37:39,385 --> 00:37:41,177
there’s no literature about it,

350
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:43,801
there’s no lecture about it.

351
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:49,676
But there is an awakening within you

352
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:54,177
which will ask this

353
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,218
“What am I?” – this awakening,

354
00:37:57,594 --> 00:38:00,010
“What am I? What have I achieved?”

355
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:05,843
You see, this will question

356
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:11,718
“What is it that I have achieved?

357
00:38:12,135 --> 00:38:15,385
What have I got out of Sahaja Yoga?”

358
00:38:15,843 --> 00:38:18,427
All these questions will come to you.

359
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:20,968
But if you have faith,

360
00:38:21,427 --> 00:38:23,801
not the blind but the enlightened

361
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,760
which is established by many miracles in life,

362
00:38:27,135 --> 00:38:28,260
many things in life;

363
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:31,427
small, small things you’ll find there have been miracles,

364
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,968
small, small things.

365
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:35,385
There have been miracles even in big things,

366
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,510
in so many things where you never expected this will happen.

367
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:41,552
So now you know, very well settled,

368
00:38:41,968 --> 00:38:45,469
that you are now very nicely in Sahaja Yoga.

369
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:48,552
For example, it starts raining.

370
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:52,135
Half of you would get worried about it why it’s raining,

371
00:38:52,552 --> 00:38:55,177
but they will know that there’s a very beautiful roof,

372
00:38:55,552 --> 00:38:56,760
nothing can happen.

373
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:59,302
Let it rain as much as it likes.

374
00:38:59,676 --> 00:39:03,427
And then you’ll have faith that it is not going to rain,

375
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,510
it’s not going to drench us.

376
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:11,010
In the same way this faith within us

377
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:15,093
has to be absolutely solid,

378
00:39:15,843 --> 00:39:19,760
and that makes you extremely strong

379
00:39:20,218 --> 00:39:22,635
and makes you responsible

380
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,260
for the resurrection of thousands

381
00:39:25,594 --> 00:39:30,052
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

382
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:39,469
This kind of life that we have

383
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:46,552
– that only by our own establishment,

384
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,635
by our own understanding,

385
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:56,676
by our own observation that we settle into ourselves,

386
00:39:57,718 --> 00:40:00,260
we settle into Sahaja Yoga

387
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:04,843
– it’s something remarkable, but it should, it has happened,

388
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,427
it is happening, and should happen to all of you.

389
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:14,052
You all should have the chance

390
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:18,218
to know your spirit

391
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:22,843
and to know yourself.

392
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:26,302
So one has to have faith in oneself.

393
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,968
I’ve seen some Sahaja yoginis always come and say,

394
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,344
“Mother, I am no good, I am useless. I am doing no work.

395
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:36,718
I’m absolutely a lazy lump,” or whatever it is.

396
00:40:39,968 --> 00:40:43,801
It’s all right, you think that way – ask for it.

397
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:47,427
What do you want?

398
00:40:47,843 --> 00:40:52,093
Even if you don’t ask it will work out,

399
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:56,052
even if you don’t ask.

400
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:02,010
Even you just think about it, it will work out.

401
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:05,926
Even if you pay attention it will work out,

402
00:41:06,427 --> 00:41:08,968
because this all-pervading Power

403
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,093
is the only real power,

404
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,385
the all the rest of the powers are useless.

405
00:41:15,218 --> 00:41:21,968
And it’s so very efficient, so compassionate

406
00:41:22,635 --> 00:41:29,718
that in the split of the second it can work out things.

407
00:41:31,093 --> 00:41:34,385
The other day we had somebody from Australia,

408
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:36,469
and he was deceived by someone

409
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:39,302
and made him buy a land and a house

410
00:41:39,718 --> 00:41:43,634
at a very exorbitant price, for which he had no money.

411
00:41:44,093 --> 00:41:45,010
And this fellow said,

412
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,843
“Doesn’t matter even if you don’t have money,

413
00:41:47,218 --> 00:41:48,926
they will not say anything to you.”

414
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,634
He believed him – had wrong faith,

415
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,635
I should say, and then he said, “All right.”

416
00:41:55,968 --> 00:42:01,510
He paid all the money that he had, just to reserve it.

417
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:08,469
Somebody went there, there was a puja so so many went there.

418
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,968
So many pujas, you see, and things happened,

419
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:18,302
and so many people came and saw all this.

420
00:42:18,718 --> 00:42:22,843
But this fellow was so upset, so upset,

421
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,510
he could not understand,

422
00:42:24,926 --> 00:42:26,510
“Why it has happened to me

423
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:30,885
that I am placed into such a difficult situation?”

424
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,552
And he was deceived and he was,

425
00:42:35,218 --> 00:42:37,552
I mean, absolutely flabbergasted.

426
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:41,718
He had no idea as to how he will get out of this mess.

427
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,552
He had put in all his money there, everything was involved,

428
00:42:45,926 --> 00:42:52,135
and if he doesn’t pay that money he would have been in jail.

429
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:58,177
I just wrote to him, “Have faith in yourself.”

430
00:42:58,594 --> 00:43:01,676
That’s all – “Have faith.”

431
00:43:02,302 --> 00:43:04,385
And what a miraculous thing happened,

432
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,510
that somebody else offered a much higher price for that.

433
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:14,469
And that fellow said,

434
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,885
“Of course I’ll pay it whatever you have promised.

435
00:43:18,344 --> 00:43:21,302
I’ll pay you back, and I’ll pay you all the more

436
00:43:21,718 --> 00:43:25,552
that I want to pay.”

437
00:43:26,718 --> 00:43:31,843
It’s something unbelievable.

438
00:43:34,052 --> 00:43:37,469
So many went there, so many wanted to solve the problem,

439
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:42,052
did this, met the fellow and told them that he cannot pay.

440
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:45,177
Nothing worked out, nothing

441
00:43:45,676 --> 00:43:47,676
– only his faith.

442
00:43:48,135 --> 00:43:51,801
And can you imagine, now he’s going to become a rich man.

443
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:53,760
He was supposed to go to jail,

444
00:43:54,135 --> 00:43:55,427
now he’s going to become a rich man.

445
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,218
There are many miracles like that, that happen.

446
00:43:58,718 --> 00:44:00,218
This is just the financial side of it,

447
00:44:00,594 --> 00:44:01,427
but I know you know

448
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,676
that there are so many other miracles happening.

449
00:44:04,177 --> 00:44:08,302
After realization if you do not have faith, that shows,

450
00:44:08,718 --> 00:44:12,135
I mean, you are a very poor personality.

451
00:44:12,634 --> 00:44:16,218
After realization at least you should take to faith.

452
00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:19,552
That really is something surprising

453
00:44:19,885 --> 00:44:21,968
that people get their realization and everything,

454
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:26,718
still they do not have faith in themselves.

455
00:44:27,302 --> 00:44:32,552
Those who have had, have really achieved so much.

456
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:37,926
Now, the difference between us and Christ is that

457
00:44:38,302 --> 00:44:40,968
faith was part and parcel of His being.

458
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:46,177
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

459
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:49,760
Now we have to have it.

460
00:44:50,344 --> 00:44:54,010
We have to believe in ourselves.

461
00:44:54,676 --> 00:44:56,718
There’s so many incidents I can give you

462
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,594
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

463
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,010
where just the faith has helped.

464
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,760
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

465
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,427
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

466
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:13,010
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

467
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,177
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

468
00:45:17,469 --> 00:45:19,634
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

469
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,260
She said it three times.

470
00:45:21,634 --> 00:45:23,594
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

471
00:45:23,926 --> 00:45:26,218
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

472
00:45:26,552 --> 00:45:28,302
She just got up, walked out.

473
00:45:28,676 --> 00:45:31,177
And then she started running all the way,

474
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:33,552
and everybody started laughing.

475
00:45:33,885 --> 00:45:35,594
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

476
00:45:35,968 --> 00:45:38,218
I said, “But see her faith!”

477
00:45:38,885 --> 00:45:44,760
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

478
00:45:45,718 --> 00:45:52,093
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

479
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,801
They have shown faith in that person.

480
00:45:56,177 --> 00:45:57,635
As I have told you always,

481
00:45:57,968 --> 00:46:00,968
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

482
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:03,052
One among hundred might deceive us

483
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:04,843
doesn’t matter, we trust.

484
00:46:05,218 --> 00:46:08,968
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

485
00:46:09,385 --> 00:46:11,177
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

486
00:46:11,634 --> 00:46:14,469
But what about deities?

487
00:46:14,926 --> 00:46:17,801
You show faith in them and it works,

488
00:46:18,218 --> 00:46:19,552
immediately they work out.

489
00:46:19,968 --> 00:46:21,218
Like Guido told Me that

490
00:46:21,594 --> 00:46:24,344
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

491
00:46:24,843 --> 00:46:26,510
for these two days.”

492
00:46:26,926 --> 00:46:31,010
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

493
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,093
It disappeared.

494
00:46:35,552 --> 00:46:41,093
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

495
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:47,926
And when we talk of faith, you know,

496
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:54,218
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

497
00:46:55,344 --> 00:47:00,052
which organizes, which knows everything,

498
00:47:00,594 --> 00:47:02,676
which is so intelligent, efficient

499
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:04,634
– above all, it loves you.

500
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,093
And then you show faith.

501
00:47:09,635 --> 00:47:16,760
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

502
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:22,718
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

503
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:24,635
They don’t feel then bad,

504
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:27,760
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

505
00:47:28,135 --> 00:47:30,635
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

506
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:34,093
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

507
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:37,010
whether this thing happens or not.

508
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,427
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

509
00:47:41,885 --> 00:47:43,093
Supposing you are lost on the way,

510
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:46,760
know that it has to be that way.

511
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:51,302
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

512
00:47:51,676 --> 00:47:53,218
He was to be crucified.

513
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:55,052
He had to carry the cross,

514
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:59,010
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

515
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,427
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

516
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,302
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

517
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:08,676
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

518
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:12,218
But this faith in Him gave Him

519
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:17,718
such a tremendous powers.

520
00:48:19,135 --> 00:48:20,843
He could have done anything.

521
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,344
He could have killed all these people

522
00:48:23,635 --> 00:48:27,260
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

523
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:29,594
Just one glance could have killed them.

524
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:33,052
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

525
00:48:33,385 --> 00:48:34,594
He went through it.

526
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:38,427
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

527
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:41,635
He is the one who won everything.

528
00:48:42,344 --> 00:48:44,177
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

529
00:48:44,552 --> 00:48:46,385
has to look at one’s own life.

530
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:53,177
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

531
00:48:54,093 --> 00:48:58,218
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

532
00:48:58,718 --> 00:49:00,634
In the evolutionary process

533
00:49:01,052 --> 00:49:04,594
how many will become Sahaja yogis, I can’t say.

534
00:49:05,177 --> 00:49:11,427
And once look at the world, then you start feeling that

535
00:49:11,926 --> 00:49:14,469
most of it is going to be destroyed or finished,

536
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,635
most of the people are not going to be there.

537
00:49:18,093 --> 00:49:19,552
Not that we are not available,

538
00:49:19,968 --> 00:49:25,634
but because they are not fated

539
00:49:26,218 --> 00:49:27,885
to come to Sahaja Yoga,

540
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:30,510
they’re not meant to come to Sahaja Yoga.

541
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,427
So, you are so fortunate

542
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:36,676
that you have got your realization, your resurrection.

543
00:49:37,052 --> 00:49:40,052
But now have faith in that resurrection of yours,

544
00:49:40,469 --> 00:49:44,885
in your resurrection that is your being now.

545
00:49:45,385 --> 00:49:48,427
And with that you will know how precious

546
00:49:48,801 --> 00:49:51,594
you are for the whole world,

547
00:49:51,968 --> 00:49:54,093
and that what you have to do is not

548
00:49:54,427 --> 00:49:57,177
to think of material gains, physical gains

549
00:49:57,634 --> 00:50:02,885
or some emotional gains, but spiritual gains.

550
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,302
What have we done for spirituality, our own and of others?

551
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:10,843
This is the only thing that you have to think about,

552
00:50:11,218 --> 00:50:13,469
and you’ll be amazed, everything is organized,

553
00:50:13,843 --> 00:50:14,926
everything works out,

554
00:50:15,427 --> 00:50:19,093
everything in its own time shows its own results.

555
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,052
Now I am sure at least eighty percent of you

556
00:50:25,552 --> 00:50:30,594
believe into what I am saying – maybe, say, ninety percent.

557
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:39,552
But there could be about ten percent who still think that

558
00:50:39,885 --> 00:50:41,385
“All right, Mother says so.

559
00:50:41,718 --> 00:50:44,926
But then why it happened, why that happened?”

560
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,177
Like the other day I had a journalist,

561
00:50:47,635 --> 00:50:50,594
very well-known person, he said, “I can’t believe in God.”

562
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:51,968
I said, “Why?”

563
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:56,635
“Because how can there be such miseries in this world?

564
00:50:57,052 --> 00:50:59,010
How can there be a blind child,

565
00:50:59,302 --> 00:51:01,801
how can this and how can that?”

566
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,718
Then he started giving Me instances. “All right now,”

567
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,843
I said, “have you told Me everything?” "Yes".

568
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,552
I said, “Now, supposing we say that

569
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:15,843
you are sitting in the realm of congress government,

570
00:51:16,218 --> 00:51:20,718
or your Andreotti government or whatever you call it.

571
00:51:22,218 --> 00:51:25,552
So the situation is explainable;

572
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:30,427
you have not yet gone into the realm of God.

573
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:34,885
If you go to that state, and if you achieve it

574
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:37,177
and if you settle down, then tell Me,

575
00:51:37,635 --> 00:51:41,594
have you any problems? None.”

576
00:51:44,427 --> 00:51:46,635
I said, “Why do you see to the negative side?

577
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:50,843
Now if you say that there is a way out

578
00:51:51,302 --> 00:51:54,302
and that there is a solution,

579
00:51:54,718 --> 00:51:57,760
and that a time can come

580
00:51:58,093 --> 00:52:01,010
when in this race of Sahaja yogis there will be no diseases,

581
00:52:01,427 --> 00:52:04,801
no troubles, nothing, no problems;

582
00:52:06,634 --> 00:52:08,302
so why not see this?

583
00:52:08,676 --> 00:52:12,385
Why do you want to see one boy who is blind?

584
00:52:13,676 --> 00:52:17,634
But why don’t you see that the blind become all right?”

585
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,469
So this kind of negative attitude

586
00:52:21,843 --> 00:52:23,968
also Sahaja yogis can have.

587
00:52:24,427 --> 00:52:26,676
I’ve seen them: somebody’s sick,

588
00:52:27,135 --> 00:52:29,634
they’ll say, “Mother, he’s sick. I must bring him to You.

589
00:52:29,926 --> 00:52:33,177
You must see them.” There’s no need at all.

590
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:38,177
You can cure, your faith can cure.

591
00:52:38,676 --> 00:52:41,510
You know about somebody whose uncle was sick,

592
00:52:41,885 --> 00:52:43,135
who was not a Sahaja yogi.

593
00:52:43,634 --> 00:52:47,260
He went down there to see him, and his wife said that

594
00:52:47,634 --> 00:52:49,885
“You are capable of praying to Mother.

595
00:52:50,385 --> 00:52:54,801
Why don’t you tell Her to get my husband all right?”

596
00:52:55,218 --> 00:52:58,010
He was a cancer patient on deathbed.

597
00:52:58,469 --> 00:53:01,218
He said, “All right.” He just bowed down and he prayed,

598
00:53:01,552 --> 00:53:03,718
“Mother, please cure my uncle.”

599
00:53:04,135 --> 00:53:05,594
Third day he was out of hospital,

600
00:53:05,843 --> 00:53:08,052
and now he’s roaming about all over the world.

601
00:53:08,469 --> 00:53:12,052
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, still it has worked;

602
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:14,676
because now a Sahaja yogi saying that,

603
00:53:15,052 --> 00:53:17,344
the deities have to work it out.

604
00:53:17,801 --> 00:53:20,968
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, doesn’t matter.

605
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,344
It’s the deities who stood by it.

606
00:53:28,302 --> 00:53:34,760
And this one has to believe in oneself, fully,

607
00:53:35,552 --> 00:53:41,552
that if these powers are with us, why not we use it?

608
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,801
Why not we develop that complete faith

609
00:53:46,302 --> 00:53:48,177
that we are now Sahaja yogis,

610
00:53:48,594 --> 00:53:51,552
we are in the Kingdom of God,

611
00:53:52,052 --> 00:53:56,302
and that this Power is going to look after us?

612
00:53:56,843 --> 00:53:59,427
Then we’ll have no choices,

613
00:53:59,885 --> 00:54:05,760
we’ll have no hesitation.

614
00:54:06,635 --> 00:54:10,177
We’ll not bother, if you have to go to, say,

615
00:54:10,594 --> 00:54:13,052
to Singapore or you have to go to Africa

616
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:15,634
or go anywhere – so what?

617
00:54:16,093 --> 00:54:19,302
We are still in the Kingdom of God wherever we go,

618
00:54:19,676 --> 00:54:22,302
it’s perfectly all right.

619
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,218
And no worry of any kind.

620
00:54:25,635 --> 00:54:28,177
We are slaves of so many things, of our watches,

621
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,926
we are slaves of conditionings, things like that.

622
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:33,052
Everything drops out.

623
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:34,760
Doesn’t matter.

624
00:54:35,177 --> 00:54:38,052
What does it matter? Nothing is important.

625
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:42,302
As long as you are with yourself, everything is all right.

626
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,718
Like people tell Me,

627
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:45,427
“Mother, You travel so much. How do You do it?”

628
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,552
I said, “I never travel. As I am sitting here in the chair,

629
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:51,385
I am sitting there in the chair, that’s all;

630
00:54:51,843 --> 00:54:52,968
only the seat is changed.

631
00:54:53,385 --> 00:54:55,635
I never think I’m traveling. Nicely sitting down,

632
00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:00,760
settled in My seat I’m all right, so I am not tired.”

633
00:55:02,218 --> 00:55:08,344
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

634
00:55:08,885 --> 00:55:11,427
then you don’t bother.

635
00:55:11,885 --> 00:55:14,344
Many people will find out whether

636
00:55:14,676 --> 00:55:17,093
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

637
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:22,010
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

638
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,926
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

639
00:55:27,344 --> 00:55:30,968
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

640
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:34,344
Nothing can bind you,

641
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:36,552
nothing can pull you down,

642
00:55:36,885 --> 00:55:40,718
no habit can come back on you;

643
00:55:42,718 --> 00:55:48,010
because faith will purify you completely,

644
00:55:48,594 --> 00:55:51,635
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

645
00:55:52,135 --> 00:55:55,926
This faith is not something

646
00:55:56,385 --> 00:55:58,010
that can be put into your heads

647
00:55:58,427 --> 00:56:02,010
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

648
00:56:02,718 --> 00:56:07,552
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

649
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:13,260
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

650
00:56:13,885 --> 00:56:18,469
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

651
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:21,594
would be established,

652
00:56:22,052 --> 00:56:23,760
would be effective,

653
00:56:24,177 --> 00:56:29,552
and for the whole world will be a model.

654
00:56:31,135 --> 00:56:34,718
May God bless you all.

655
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:12,010
There are just the children, there are so many children.

656
00:57:15,093 --> 00:57:16,594
Today is the day of Christ,

657
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:21,052
so we should have children in any case to wash My feet.

658
00:57:22,843 --> 00:57:27,344
Can you fit it there, or you will have to move it?
