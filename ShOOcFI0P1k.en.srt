1
00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:19,850
I 

2
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:33,500
bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:43,170
I bow to them because they are a special category
of human beings which is described by William

4
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:56,739
Blake as the men of God who will become prophets
and they will have powers to make others prophets.

5
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,700
This is what is described by many other seers
in India also.

6
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,390
All over the world people have talked about
the resurrection time.

7
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:17,090
Mohammed Sahib in His Koran has described
that at the time of resurrection your hands

8
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,760
will speak.

9
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:28,560
Like when the disciples of Christ got their
blessings of Self realization from the Holy

10
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:38,501
Ghost which came as a cool breeze upon Him
they started using their hands because they

11
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:45,970
felt the power flowing through them and they
started speaking the language which was strange.

12
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:54,000
That was the language of the chakras and that's
why people thought they were off their minds,

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,160
they didn't understand.

14
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:09,340
But today we are in a special time which I
call as the blossom time.

15
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:16,680
We do not have only twelve people who are
seeking, twelve hundred who are seeking, but

16
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,780
thousands and thousands, millions and millions.

17
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:29,950
This seeking has come to us from ages, we
have been seekers from ages, though in the

18
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:39,580
western contries the tradition of seeking
has lost its meaning very much because of

19
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,440
industralisation.

20
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:49,620
It has grown like a tree which does not know
about its roots.

21
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:57,209
In India the climate was very gentle, I think,
and it's a very old country.

22
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:03,850
Since long people have been seeking why we
are on this earth, why God has made us human

23
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:12,770
beings, why should we be in such incomplete
state.

24
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:19,240
Still we are living in a relative world if
you understand.

25
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,470
We do not what is right and wrong is.

26
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:31,410
Shri Krishna has said that there are three
types of people in this world which create

27
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,410
problems.

28
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:43,540
The first type is the type which always takes
to something wrong, destructive, and run after

29
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,390
it and destroys oneself, emotional things.

30
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:53,650
He gets emotional attachments to wrong things,
he doesn't value his life much relatively,

31
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,020
and he destroys himself.

32
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:08,120
Then the second type of people who are which
he calls as the rajasikas who are futuristic,

33
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,880
the first are the ones who live in the past,
are the rajasikas, are the people who are

34
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,340
futuristic, as we are in the West, very much
futuristic.

35
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:27,030
We are planning all the time what we are going
to do next moment, but this moment, when we

36
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,560
are here, we are not there.

37
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,780
They are not capable of knowing what is right
and wrong.

38
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,970
Sometimes they may do right but mostly they
go towards wrong because they do not know

39
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,250
what is right and what is wrong.

40
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:51,150
The reason why we go towards wrong much more
is this: that we have come from carbon, say

41
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,050
earlier, from matter.

42
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,190
Matter always fights the spirit.

43
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:07,810
Say for example, we get used to anything that
is material, a chair, we cannot sit on the

44
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,810
ground.

45
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,470
If you are used to a bed we cannot sleep on
the ground.

46
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,840
So the matter is always trying to give us
habits.

47
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:24,710
It is trying to overpower us, and that's how
we start getting into a comfortable understanding

48
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,950
that we have to be dominated by matter.

49
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:41,580
So such people who are on the rajasic side,
we call them the rightsided people, are guided

50
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:48,680
by the ego that developed because they convert
matter into some form and they think they

51
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,470
achieved a lot.

52
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:58,790
As I said, a tree dies and they create a chair
and that chair sits on your head and you think

53
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,860
you have achieved a lot.

54
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,300
So this is what happens that the ego, as you
see on the right hand side, starts developing

55
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,110
and when it develops it guides you.

56
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,370
It can misguide you many a times, because
when there is ego pampering we feel happy

57
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,580
and when there is no ego pampering we feel
unhappy.

58
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,940
Like if you tell somebody, "Oh I like that".

59
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,509
Even a person, whom I met, who was trying
to hijack some plane.

60
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:33,250
So I said, "Why are you doing it, why do you
want to hijack a plane?"

61
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,180
He said, "For the heck of it, for the heck
of it."

62
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,030
I said, "But don't you think you'll be putting
so many people into trouble this?"

63
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,530
He said, "But I'll appear in the newspapers
as a great hero."

64
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,100
So the concept of the goodness is not there.

65
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:58,360
Benevolence is not there, but the concept
of something standing out, something out of

66
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,880
the blue, they want to show off that they
are something greater.

67
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,750
And in London we have a kind of funny people,
I don't know you might be having them here

68
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,750
also.

69
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:19,160
They call themselves punks and they came to
Me, to My program with pins here and pins

70
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
there.

71
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,500
All pins actually, in the noses, all over
pins, and with the hair dyed.

72
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,400
I asked them, "Why do you do it?"

73
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,630
They said, "What's wrong?"

74
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,530
There's no answer to it, what's wrong?

75
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,150
But what's so good about it?

76
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,110
Why to waste your energy on this nonsenical
thing?

77
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,200
"I like it."

78
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,999
If you like it then that's the last word,
"I like it."

79
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:47,760
That's how we live and thats how we grow with
it.

80
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,080
But one must understand we are neither our
conditionings, which is the superego which

81
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:02,840
is the psyche as described by this horrible
fellow Freud, or we are the ego as described

82
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,220
by other people, say, Sartre, and all this.

83
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:15,470
When he denied that you should not get into
any conditioning, he had no discretion of

84
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,470
any kind.

85
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,990
Because if you have no conditioning what do
you have?

86
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,630
Is nothing but pure ego, pure ego.

87
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:32,260
There's something like good conditioning also
and that good condition makes us to stay in

88
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:39,570
the center, binds us to that central path
which is described by Buddha.

89
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,040
You have to keep to the central path.

90
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,020
That is, you keep with your ten valencies.

91
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,640
Carbon has got four, you've got ten valencies.

92
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,980
These ten valencies of balance are very important.

93
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:01,240
Once you go into imbalances because of your
superego, of your conditioning, or because

94
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:10,100
of your too much of ego, you land up first
of all into physical problems, then into mental

95
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:17,910
problems, then into spiritual problems, and
lastly it's finished, it's complete destruction.

96
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:27,230
Now the problems we are facing in the West
are coming more from the right side than from

97
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,900
the left side.

98
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:40,240
To overcome this I thought Christ was the
solution because He came as an antidote for

99
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
that.

100
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,810
On the contrary, in all the Christian nations
if you find, people have been extremely aggressive

101
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,880
on other races.

102
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,910
Can you believe it, they are supposed to be
Christians taking Bible in one hand and pistol

103
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,930
in another hand.

104
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:10,470
That was really so misguiding that in India
those who were great people, sages, they never

105
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:16,730
understood Christ because is described that
such and such a personality is going to be

106
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,730
born.

107
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,210
He is the one who's the support of the universe.

108
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:26,980
He is the one who will die and establish the
principle of eternal life.

109
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:33,630
All being described very nicely in the Devi
Mahatmayan, a book written about fourteen

110
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,310
thousand years back, you'll be surprised.

111
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,720
But when they saw these people with the bible
in the hand and the revolver in another hand,

112
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,880
or a gun, or sometimes a cannon, they said,
"This cannot be because He is supposed to

113
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,110
be saumya: means mild, mildness.

114
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,769
That's why they gave up the hope.

115
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:08,850
We too must understand the knowledge of the
tree is not sufficient, we have to have knowledge

116
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:18,670
of the roots, and that's why I say the seekers
are a special category of human beings who

117
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:28,810
feel that they have to still know about the
roots, about the region from where they are

118
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,680
going to be nourished.

119
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,250
The third type of people are the seekers,
the sattva gunis.

120
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:44,520
They try to avoid extremes, they try to keep
in the center, they are the ones who are best

121
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
seekers.

122
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,600
Of course in seeking also people go astray.

123
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,970
They go astray in so many ways.

124
00:11:52,970 --> 00:12:01,480
Like, they may like a person because he is
giving them some sort of a workshop to work

125
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,210
out, they like to work, they want to achieve
something through work.

126
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,800
They don't like something that is easily available.

127
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,180
Sahaja Yoga, saha means 'with' and ja is 'born'
with you.

128
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:25,120
Sahaja Yoga is a spontaneous, living happening
of the evolutionary process within you, of

129
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,620
the living God, is the living energy within
you, which is this kundalini, which is the

130
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,740
true desire within you to become the Divine.

131
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:47,070
How can you pay for this kundalini, she doesn't
understand money, like the Mother Earth [the

132
00:12:47,070 --> 00:13:00,310
sound drops out where Shri Mataji is telling
the story of how Mother Earth germinates the

133
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,310
seed].

134
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:15,330
In the same way, the kundalini in her own
nature awakens because she is your own mother.

135
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:22,040
She is like a tape recorder which has taped
everything that was your past.

136
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:31,250
She's the one who is waiting for a chance
to give you your second birth.

137
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,120
This is what you have within yourself.

138
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,300
Now when I'm telling you about these things
you need not also believe in Me with blind

139
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,870
faith, not necessary at all.

140
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:48,889
You may not deny, but you should understand
that whatever I'm saying is like a hypothesis

141
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:50,880
a scientist can put before you.

142
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,600
But keep your minds open like a scientist
has.

143
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,339
Supposing a scientist already knows about
everything then what's the use of telling

144
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:06,010
anything to the scientist but as he keeps
his mind open, in the same way you keep your

145
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:13,330
minds open you'll understand this is a hypothesis
and this hypothesis if it is proved, then

146
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,050
you have to believe in it.

147
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:20,870
But we believe into things about, in nothing
is known to us, any kind of a mental projection

148
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,360
comes in, we just believe in.

149
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,149
I'm surprised how people have changed so many
of their habits suddenly because some sort

150
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:35,370
of a mental projection has come forward, that
you must wear this kind of dresses, that is

151
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,170
good for you, you must eat this kind of food,
that is good for you.

152
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:45,080
Like, I went to Switzerland I was surprised
they were eating cottonseed.

153
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,760
I was shocked, cottonseeds, how can human
beings consume, only in India buffaloes eat.

154
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,790
How can you eat cottonseed?

155
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,890
They said, "This is a special now diet created
for our health."

156
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:04,060
I said, "I tell you will end up very fast
with this because your intestines are not

157
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,530
that sturdy as the buffalo has, you are a
delicate human being, how can you eat this?"

158
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,740
They said, "No, this is what it is said."

159
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,230
But I said, "Whenever somebody has said it,
why do you accept it readily like that?

160
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,480
See some people who are eating it first of
all, what happens to them.

161
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,950
If they give it to say some sort of animals
and if they can digest it that doesn't mean

162
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,260
you can digest also."

163
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,820
Any sort of a fad, any sort of a new mental
idea comes to a rajasic's personality, he

164
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,820
accepts.

165
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,450
He likes to have change all the time.

166
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:42,300
Change that what it wants to such an extent
that they'll change their hairstyles and everybody

167
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,320
will be wearing the same hairstyles.

168
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,180
Then again a second time you will see them
having another style and that is a fashion

169
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,180
goes on.

170
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,769
They don't know by doing this they are really
creating not an individualistic taste at all,

171
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:59,970
but quite a common stuff goes on.

172
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:11,829
The problem is that we are looking at ourselves
as something superficial, something very outside.

173
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:17,070
If you dress up like this, like some people
dressed up just like a primitive people came

174
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,399
to Me.

175
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,950
I asked them, "Why are you like this, why
do you dress up like this primitive people

176
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,300
like this, and all your dress is so dirty."

177
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,730
He said, "We want to be primitive."

178
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,630
Now by dressing up like that can you become
primitive?

179
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,880
Your brain is so modern how can you become
primitive by dressing up like that?

180
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:44,860
This is the problem with us, we think by doing
something superficial we will get something

181
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:50,120
within ourselves and this is one of the biggest
hurdles in your seeking.

182
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,370
You have to know that by changing your name,
by chanting something, by doing all this madness

183
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,600
that people are doing, some people start jumping,
screaming, shouting, this all you can do otherwise

184
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
also.

185
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,809
Also this is not the way it's going to happen.

186
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:08,799
It is antar yoga, the inner yoga.

187
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,649
The inner yoga has to take place, kundalini
has to rise, you have to get your realization

188
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:19,759
as an experience on your central nervous system.

189
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,470
Like as on your central nervous system you
have got the rest of your evolution.

190
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:32,169
You are a human being, now with your own eyes
you can see things, more than the animals

191
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:33,820
can see.

192
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:41,690
You can feel the dirt and filth much more
than an animal can feel.

193
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,309
If you want a dog to pass through a dirty
lane he passes through.

194
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:47,309
But not you.

195
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:51,129
You cannot do it because you are a human being,
you have developed a new "experiencer" within

196
00:17:51,129 --> 00:17:56,830
you, a new "experiencer", which knows the
experience of the dirt and filth, and of cleanliness.

197
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:02,109
So you are so clean, you wash yourself, you're
keeping everything clean, you can't bear bad

198
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:04,730
smells and things like that.

199
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:12,110
In some way the evolution if it has to take
place within you, you have to develop an "experiencer"

200
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:19,989
of goodness, of righteoness, of virtue by
which I don't have to tell you, you do this,

201
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:25,749
you do that, or nobody has to tell you, but
you yourself become that.

202
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:33,440
That yourself, themselves, develop that special
capacity, that special experience that makes

203
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,789
you a good person.

204
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:41,570
We talk of peace, big organisations, My husband
himself is a Secretary General of one of them

205
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,700
and he says no use because people have to
be transformed.

206
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,529
Unless and until they are transformed there's
no use doing it, they are just the same.

207
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:55,170
Unless and until there's peace within yourselves
what's the use of talking about peace?

208
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:02,879
We need that transformation for which, you'll
be surprised, we are specially made.

209
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:09,619
The instrument is here like any instrument
you can see, this is an instrument, unless

210
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:11,769
and until I put it to the mains it doesn't
work.

211
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:17,739
Unless and until you are put to the mains
you do not work.

212
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,239
The energy doesn't flow through you.

213
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:25,879
Let the energy which is all-pervading, which
is doing all the living work.

214
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:30,149
Actually we don't do anything, but what we
do is a dead work.

215
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:38,770
All the living work which is transforming,
say, of flowers in the fruits, can we do that?

216
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:47,049
For example, I say but thousand and one, like
even looking after our breathing, pumping

217
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,460
our hearts regularly.

218
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,519
If you run fast, then sympathetic goes into
action, that we control but it comes to normal,

219
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,519
automatically.

220
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,519
How does it happen?

221
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,090
What works it out?

222
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,090
They call it of course, doctors are very good
at giving names, our autonomic nervous system.

223
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,570
Now who is this auto?

224
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,970
Auto is the spirit.

225
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,119
Auto is the spirit, they don't want to say
spirit.

226
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:16,330
They don't want to use that word, but it means
that, otherwise tell us, who is the auto.

227
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:22,440
This, one has to understand, that within us
this special instrument placed.

228
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,379
One after another these centers were created
at a different stage of our evolution.

229
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:35,570
For example at the first red spot is the carbon
situation.

230
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:41,169
Then as you started evolving more and more
these are the milestones within us.

231
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:48,299
Specially created within us, this kundalini
is there, which is the pure desire of becoming

232
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,840
one with the Divine.

233
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:58,989
All other desires are absolutely not desires,
because if they were we would have been satisfied

234
00:20:58,989 --> 00:20:59,989
with them.

235
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:03,239
Economics says that in general wants are not
satiable.

236
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:06,580
So all our wants are something, unsatiable
stuffs.

237
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,139
So why run after that?

238
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:15,629
What is that desire which is going to really
make us satisfied is this desire, is the kundalini.

239
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:22,360
So this exists within us, it is within us
this all has been made, specially.You are

240
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,220
a special instrument.

241
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,679
Now this instrument must be put to the mains.

242
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,239
That's the only job.

243
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:31,340
Then why deny it?

244
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,489
Why should we deny this?

245
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:41,750
Because we have become human beings with all
these things within us, so why not put it

246
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:48,610
to the mains, and once you put it to the mains
you are amazed that your own instrument what

247
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,610
you are.

248
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,470
You don't know what you are, you think you're
just an ordinary person you see hobnobbing

249
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,830
with other things of life?

250
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:05,119
No, actually you are a special instrument,
made specially to enter into the Kingdom of

251
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,119
God.

252
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:14,609
But only thing is, when we are naive or when
we are ignorant, we don't understand our own

253
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:20,399
value, like in the Indian village if you take,
say, a TV set and say that you can see all

254
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:25,330
kinds of dramas and plays and music out of
this, they'll say, "What?

255
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,960
This box how can it be?"

256
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,289
Then you put it to the mains, he's aghast,
what's this magic?

257
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:33,629
To him this is a magic.

258
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:36,669
For some people raising the kundalini is magic.

259
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:39,299
They always ask me how can it be so simple.

260
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,860
It has to be simple.

261
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,539
It is so vital.

262
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,220
As when we breathe.

263
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,341
What do we do?

264
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:48,869
Do we go to any guru or do we read any book
or anything?

265
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:52,210
If you had to do that, how many of us would
exist.

266
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,019
Whatever is vital has to be simple.

267
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:58,580
Whatever is living is simple.

268
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,559
We don't know how many things we are blessed
with.

269
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,739
The powers of God cannot be described, but
one can say that if you see, looking at things,

270
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:15,159
see an Australian gets a child looks like
an Australian; Indian gets a child looks like

271
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:16,770
an Indian, and also the face.

272
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:23,080
And if you see to the microscopic way, how
it works out, how it develops, how the choices

273
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,489
take place, is something a fantastic work.

274
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,119
You cannot go into that.

275
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,460
Is like an ocean.

276
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,509
When you start seeing the reality, is like
an ocean.

277
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:36,480
When you start discernng it, finding it out.

278
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,740
It's too
much.

279
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,059
So what is best to make your drop an ocean.

280
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,099
Just to dissolve it into the ocean.

281
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,850
Then people think that you have to surrender.

282
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,279
You don't have to surrender.

283
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:50,830
What is there to surrender?

284
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:57,349
Only your ego, which has bound you, only your
superego which has bound you, has to be sucked

285
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:58,349
in.

286
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:03,379
Let the kundalini pass through and you become
one with the Divine.

287
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:08,389
The problems of health are really shattering.

288
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:14,210
I say we'll not be destroyed by atom bomb
because whatever human beings create they

289
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,999
know what it is, like the atom bomb itself
has become a devil for them.

290
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,509
They are all worried.

291
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:25,129
The Americans are worried that if they start
it the Russians will destroy them, and the

292
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:28,299
Russians are worried if they start it American
will destroy them.

293
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:31,450
So let them be busy with each other.

294
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:41,890
But they are not worried as to the real destruction
which is bubbling through.

295
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:51,830
The destruction that is bubbling through in
America is not through atomic bomb, but through

296
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:58,640
their own mental disturbances, extreme behaviours,
their "What's wrong?"

297
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
business.

298
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,860
Russia same thing.

299
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
Why?

300
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,700
The presidents are dying, what's the reason,
have you been able to find out?

301
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,919
They are not murdered.

302
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,679
In America, they're murdered.

303
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:16,769
The reason, they are dealing in parapsychology,
they are dealing with all left-sided things.

304
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:22,989
Because they're dealing with these, all these
spirits are getting hold of them.

305
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,049
That's why they cannot go further.

306
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:30,340
So in both ways they are not aware so to what
is going to destroy them.

307
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,679
But as Australia is a neutral country, let's
see a neutral point of view, that we do not

308
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,609
want to be destroyed by our stupidity, nor
by our foolhardiness, but let us have our

309
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:48,360
own wisdom to underdstand how we construct
ourselves into human beings who will be wise

310
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
people.

311
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:56,539
Now specially for Australians, I have a special
feeling for them because this first red center

312
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:00,169
is Australia, and this represents the innocence.

313
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:05,779
So whatever Australians may try to destroy
their innocence, they cannot go very far because

314
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:08,129
you have rooted into innocence.

315
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:09,879
You are blessed with innocence.

316
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:15,599
You cannot go too far and it's here it will
start, you will see one day, the wisdom, because

317
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,570
this is the centre of wisdom too.

318
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:25,889
This is the centre of as we call Shri Ganesha,
the deity of innocence, who is the giver of

319
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:26,889
wisdom.

320
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:33,039
So this wisdom to give balance in this nonsensical
world, which is busy fighting and not constructing

321
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:39,830
themselves into better realms, will definitely
one day come through Australia, no doubt about

322
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,830
it.

323
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:48,840
But Australians also must put down both the
feet down on the ground and don't try to follow

324
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,450
others, not try to copy others.

325
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:58,889
If you have faith in yourself try to develop
your own wisdom and understand that you could

326
00:26:58,889 --> 00:27:04,529
one day do such a great thing that none of
these so called successful and great countries

327
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:05,529
have been able to.

328
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:12,639
It's all right to have dollar in a collapsable
state, you can have something else, but to

329
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:18,019
have people who are wise, who are not going
to be deterred by nonsense, to create such

330
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:20,169
people is possible in Australia.

331
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:24,669
Though my visits to Australia have been few,
I should say only three times, this the third

332
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:27,820
time here I am here.

333
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:36,130
I wish I could come many more times, but My
own opinion is this, that I have been laboring

334
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:41,749
in that England, which is the heart of universe,
for the last twelve years.

335
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:48,539
I haven't achieved much as I have done it
here in only four years, is surprising.

336
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,970
You must know your own nature, you must know
what you are.

337
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:56,309
You are Australians and you have a special
wisdom about it.

338
00:27:56,309 --> 00:28:01,929
Take to that wisdom, understand that, respect
it, and work it out.

339
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:08,529
I'm sure that will take no time for you to
understand that in your wisdom, you must become

340
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:11,039
that instrument that you are.

341
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,620
You have to become the spirit, that's what
are.

342
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:21,609
You are not this temporary phase in which
you are indulging, you are not to destroy

343
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:22,609
yourself.

344
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:27,659
You're not to destroy your own progenies,
but you have to save the whole world out of

345
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,049
this island of great people.

346
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:35,339
So may God bless you.

347
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:42,409
We take out our shoes to respect the Mother
Earth in a way, but also you must know that

348
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:46,940
all these centers are made of different elements,
and specially the kundalini rests in the sacrum

349
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:53,679
bone which is a sacred bone which means that
the Greeks knew about it, that it is a sacred

350
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,029
bone and is made specially of the earth element.

351
00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:01,700
So one has to understand that we have to take
a special help from the Mother Earth and that's

352
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,570
why I said Australia is something special
for us.

353
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,399
Regarding questions also, just now we are
in a mood, you see, to get our realization,

354
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:09,130
is better to keep the mood on.

355
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:15,139
Questions, whatever you think, you can ask
Me tomorrow; but ask sensible questions, because

356
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:23,460
you have to be constructive and wise and there's
no need to be aggressive with Me.

357
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:38,889
The other day there was somebody who just
for nothing at all just got in a mood of shouting

358
00:29:38,889 --> 00:30:12,239
at Me, for what I don't know, I didn't even
hear him what he was talking.

359
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:42,109
This is not 

360
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:45,779
the way to behave.

361
00:30:45,779 --> 00:31:01,320
After all you all have this instrument.

362
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:36,669
Now I 
have come here to give you what you have,

363
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:42,609
your own properties.

364
00:31:42,609 --> 00:32:04,859
I'm just to hand over your own keys to you.

365
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:11,469
What is there to fight with Me for that?

366
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:14,320
Is it something sensible to do?

367
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,429
But it happens.

368
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:21,070
I don't know why it happens like that: with
some people go off their heads, they can't

369
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,219
see things properly.

370
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:28,609
Whatever it is you please write down all your
questions and hand them over and I'll answer

371
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:32,499
them tomorrow if specifically possible, otherwise
in My lectures.

372
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:41,029
I'm here only for two days, that is today
and tomorrow, so you must take full advantage

373
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:46,049
of Me, I think, whatever is possible than
to waste your time here and there.

374
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:52,380
Now we have a very simple method of raising
our kundalini.

375
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,279
So what do we do first day is to raise our
own kundalini.

376
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:07,659
We put the left hand on the lap like this,
which is the side which we call is the power

377
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:14,970
of desire, on the lap just like this, towards
Me, just like, simple, like that on the lap

378
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,209
very comfortably.

379
00:33:16,209 --> 00:33:20,820
Sit comfortably, there's no need to push back
your head much or bend down, nothing keep

380
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,629
it absolutely normal.

381
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:26,009
Actually you have to lead a very normal life.

382
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:28,739
Somebody asked Me, "You have to be celibate
and all that?"

383
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:29,739
Nothing of the kind.

384
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:34,250
You have to be married, very happily married,
you have to have children, and you will know

385
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:39,590
how to lead a very sane, sensible married
life, and how to look after your children,

386
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,499
and you will have children who are great sages.

387
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:49,960
So I would suggest that you shouldn't have
all these ideas that you have to do this or

388
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,899
anything, as you are sitting you will get
your realization and then you will have just

389
00:33:55,899 --> 00:34:02,440
to find out what problems you have, what exercise
you may have to do if you have a very bad

390
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,179
problem of some physical side.

391
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:12,549
If you have any problem, say of mental side,
or any other problem of family life or anything,

392
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:18,849
they will tell you the method, the technique,
how through your spiritual powers you can

393
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,470
solve them.

394
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:24,619
So we have to have our own kundalini awakened.

395
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:27,710
Put left hand towards Me.

396
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:34,250
Now the right hand has to go on different
centers on the left hand side of your body,

397
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,409
on the left hand side.

398
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:38,330
Now the right hand is the power of action.

399
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:43,990
This is our hand we have to use because I
said you are fantastic and the fact is, the

400
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,980
greatest thing is that you can get your kundalini
awakened this way.

401
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:57,149
So put your left hand towards Me on the lap,
very comfortably you sit down, and the right

402
00:34:57,149 --> 00:34:59,930
hand you have to use for the different centers.

403
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,950
I show you which ones, and then I'll tell
you later on when you close your eyes.

404
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:12,579
So I want to tell you first, on the heart,
then on the upper part of the stomach, then

405
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:19,630
in the lower part of the stomach, then again
back on the upper part of the stomach, all

406
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:26,779
on the left hand side, then on the heart,
then on the neck, here, little on the back

407
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:33,950
side, goes here, is very important just now
this is the worst of all, because when you

408
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,630
feel guilty this catches.

409
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:42,849
Now one here [front agnya], then here [back
agnya], and then here [fontanelle], but I'll

410
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,970
tell you every time where you have to put
it.

411
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:54,440
At the very outset I have to request you that
you should tell yourself very clearly that

412
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,150
"I'm not guilty at all of anything."

413
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,430
Forgive yourself, that's very important.

414
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:07,180
I said you are the temple of God, you are
a special category.

415
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:11,119
Why do you want to debase yourself by feeling
guilty?

416
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:17,220
In My lecture if I've said something, forget
it.

417
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:25,819
Just tell yourself that "I'm not at all guilty"
very clearly with all confidence, that's one

418
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:31,089
of the things you have to do.

419
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,910
All right.

420
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:42,420
Now, we close our eyes and we don't open our
eyes till I tell you.

421
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,930
Don't open your eyes till I tell you because
the kundalini has to rise.

422
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:49,930
Everyone must do it.

423
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,700
Those who don't want to do it should please
go away.

424
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,680
Please be civil, don't do it, please go away.

425
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:03,920
Nobody can force this on you and this is no
show on, so please go away.

426
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,820
Secondly, those who are doing meditation should
sit till you get your realization.

427
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,220
It will not take much time, about fifteen
minutes at the most.

428
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:20,080
But some people have a habit of suddenly shooting
off like jack-in-the-box and disturbing others.

429
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,549
So you have to be pleasant about it.

430
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:24,280
You have to be pleasant, it's nothing serious.

431
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,789
You are going to enter into the kingdom of
God, you are invited.

432
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:36,519
There is an invitation, so be pleasant about
it and I'm sure it will work out.

433
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:44,792
Now, please close your eyes and the doubting
Thomas, you put him outside for the time being.

434
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:47,349
The doubting Thomas is not going to help you.

435
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:48,950
Just don't doubt yourself.

436
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:56,010
You are quite capable of getting realization,
all of you are quite capable of getting realization,

437
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,230
believe Me, there.

438
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:05,200
Now please put your right [hand], with all
your respect to your person, on your heart.

439
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,150
In the heart resides the Spirit.

440
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:17,039
So you ask Me a question, without feeling
guilty, with full confidence, a question to

441
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:23,790
be asked in your heart, you can call Me Shri
Mataji, or Mother, whatever suits you, "Mother,

442
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,160
am I the spirit?".

443
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,300
Ask the question three times because you are
like a computer and the answer comes to you

444
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,300
as vibrations.

445
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,750
Ask the question three times.

446
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,750
Believing in yourself.

447
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:41,309
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

448
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:48,700
Regarding feet I must tell you, you must sit
in a way the feet are parallel but not touching

449
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,400
each other, but touching the Mother Earth.

450
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,849
They should be parallel to each other, sit
in such a way that they are parallel, touching

451
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:00,670
the Mother Earth.

452
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,090
Not touching each other.

453
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:17,539
Ask a question, please ask a question three
times, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

454
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:33,260
Please don't feel guilty.

455
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:42,160
This question is followed by another question
that if you are the spirit, you are your own

456
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,790
guide, you are your own guru, you are your
own master.

457
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:55,809
So now, please take this right hand down on
the left hand side on the upper part of your

458
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:57,029
stomach.

459
00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:03,170
Now slowly press it there.

460
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,970
Don't say any mantras, don't chant anything,
nothing of the kind, just don't force your

461
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,990
mind to do anything, it will happen automatically.

462
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:19,059
Now at this point, you have to ask another
question to Me three times, "Mother, am I

463
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:20,369
my own guru?

464
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:22,970
Mother, am I my own master.

465
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:34,920
Mother, am I my own guide?"

466
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:45,130
All right.

467
00:40:45,130 --> 00:41:09,250
Now you take down your hand on the lower part
of your abdomen, your stomach, in the left

468
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,640
hand side, and push it there.

469
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:22,119
This center is very important, because this
is the beginning of asking for the true knowledge,

470
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:30,299
for the technique, how to maneuver this power
of God's love.

471
00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:34,300
So here I cannot cross your freedom.

472
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:39,349
You have to say that you want the true knowledge,
the pure knowledge.

473
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:47,759
So please say six times, because there are
six petals to this chakra, "Mother, may I

474
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:49,500
have the true knowledge?"

475
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:56,539
or "Mother, please give me the pure knowledge."

476
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:05,569
Six times please.

477
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:20,609
Please don't get up halfway.

478
00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:27,990
It's not proper to disturb others.

479
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:38,420
Please be seated, please be seated.

480
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:46,980
Now take this hand again back to the center
of the guru principle, that is in the upper

481
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,560
part of your abdomen.

482
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:57,869
On the left hand side, in the upper part of
the abdomen, on the left hand side.

483
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:02,559
Now as you have asked for your true technique,
the kundalini has started moving.

484
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:14,019
To give her a proper cooperation, now you
have to say, with full confidence, with full

485
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:20,150
assertion, "Mother, I am my own master.

486
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,680
Mother, I am my own guide.

487
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,049
Mother I am my own guru."

488
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:29,230
Please say this.

489
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:34,470
When you say this, the kundalini will rise
higher.

490
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:45,590
At this point you have to say ten times.

491
00:43:45,590 --> 00:44:04,990
As I said there are ten valencies, ten guru
principles, within us.

492
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:09,680
You shouldn't have any fear, any fear whatsoever,
about kundalini.

493
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:16,150
This kundalini is your mother and she is going
to bear all the brunt upon herself to give

494
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:19,759
you this realization, because this she has
been waiting for ages.

495
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:21,190
You are not going to be troubled at all.

496
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:25,250
There is not going to be any trouble whatsoever.

497
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:35,609
So now what we have, please close your eyes,
now what we have to do is to put this hand

498
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:42,519
on the heart again, back on the heart, left
hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

499
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:44,990
Take out your shoes please.

500
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:49,420
Put your left hand towards Me and right hand
on the heart.

501
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,680
Take out your spectacles, please.

502
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,940
Now keep your eyes shut.

503
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:06,670
At this point you have to say, assert with
full confidence in you, "Mother, "I am the

504
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:12,270
spirit", you are the spirit.

505
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:20,490
All right.

506
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:39,609
Say twelve times "Mother, I am the spirit."

507
00:45:39,609 --> 00:45:52,720
Now you have to know that God is the ocean
of compassion, ocean of Divine love, ocean

508
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,619
of grace, bliss, joy, everything.

509
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:03,440
Apart from that He is the ocean of forgiveness.

510
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:14,900
Whatever you might have done He is the ocean,
everything engulfs, dissolves into His ocean

511
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,779
of forgiveness.

512
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:27,779
So please forgive yourself first of all, and
now raise your right hand in the corner of

513
00:46:27,779 --> 00:46:30,250
your neck and the shoulder.

514
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,430
Little backwards.

515
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,970
This is the center you catch.

516
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:39,450
This is the center you catch when you feel
guilty.

517
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:45,410
So now please say with full understanding
about yourself.

518
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:53,740
Please put the hand from the front on the
chest you put it, not backwards, put it from

519
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:59,700
the, on the chest, the hand on the chest and
then put it down, otherwise it will pain.

520
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,700
Yes.

521
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:11,990
Now press it hard, press it hard, and here
you say sixteen times, with all faith in yourself,

522
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,000
"Mother, I am not guilty."

523
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,970
Say it sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty."

524
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:22,650
You have to be pleasant, you have to be happy,
you have to be joyous.

525
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,260
Not to feel guilty and miserable.

526
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:30,010
Please say, "Mother, I am not guilty at all."

527
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,010
That will really help.

528
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:36,099
This the worst center you have today, worst,
is very painful, please say, "Mother, I'm

529
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:37,119
not guilty."

530
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:44,579
If you still believe that you are guilty of
doing something wrong for nothing at all,

531
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:49,490
I would say better get a punishment of saying
hundred and eight times.

532
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,050
That will release you of your worries, of
feeling guilty.

533
00:47:52,050 --> 00:48:04,249
What do you do about it, it's a myth to feel
that way, isn't it?

534
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:09,670
Ah, better.

535
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:36,690
So now please say it sixteen times, "Mother,
I am not guilty."

536
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:47,130
Now raise this hand on your forehead across,
across and hold it tight and press it hard,

537
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:55,369
as if when you have headache, you press it
the same way.

538
00:48:55,369 --> 00:49:03,200
At this point you have to say, is the mantra
for this center, is, that "Mother, I forgive

539
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,099
everyone, Mother, I forgive everyone."

540
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:12,349
Now many people think that is very diffiult
to say, actually it's a myth, it's a myth

541
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:19,160
because we do not do anything whether we forgive
or we do not forgive.

542
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:25,440
But if we do not forgive others we play into
the hand of others.

543
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,170
So please say, "Mother, I forgive everyone",
from your heart.

544
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:34,210
How many times is not the point.

545
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:47,720
From your heart please say, "Mother, I forgive
everyone."

546
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,230
From your heart.

547
00:49:52,230 --> 00:50:05,190
Now take your hand on the backside of your
head, backside, on the optic lobe, hold it

548
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:06,420
tight.

549
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:14,279
Here because you feel so guilty please say,
once and for all, "Oh Lord, if I have done

550
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:21,130
anything in the glory of Divine which is wrong,
please forgive me."

551
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:35,240
Just once with full understanding and heart,
please say that, "Forgive me.

552
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:48,509
If I have done anything wrong, please forgive
me."

553
00:50:48,509 --> 00:50:53,390
All right.

554
00:50:53,390 --> 00:51:04,339
Now take this hand on top of your head, and
put your palm on top of your head and press

555
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:10,630
it hard and move it clockwise, on the area
that was soft in your childhood.

556
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,720
Press it hard and move it.

557
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:42,140
Your palm, palm, not fingers, and move it
clockwise.

558
00:51:42,140 --> 00:52:28,660
[Shri Mataji gives the cool breeze through
the microphone.]

559
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:35,589
Now please take down your hand, slowly, take
down your hand on your lap, right hand.

560
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:37,940
Now open your eyes.

561
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:42,059
Slowly, very slowly.

562
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:46,290
Now watch Me without thinking, watch Me without
thinking.

563
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:51,650
Though there is air conditioning, you'll find
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

564
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:58,079
If you put your right hand towards Me and
left hand on top of your head.

565
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,619
See, now is there cool breeze coming?

566
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:04,260
Little higher.

567
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:14,220
It's a very very subtle thing, don't doubt
it, little here, little here, please take.

568
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:24,130
Put right hand towards Me, little raise the
right hand maybe, hmm, good.

569
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:29,940
Move it like that and see, just see for yourself.

570
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,420
Move it little bit, see now.

571
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,849
There is the cool breeze, not the breeze from
top.

572
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:43,900
Don't doubt it, because this is the breeze
which will enpower you to cure others, to

573
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,460
cure yourself, so it's not the airconditioner,
just see this.

574
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,200
Now, all right, quite a blast.

575
00:53:50,200 --> 00:54:02,539
Now you put back the other hand toward Me,
now, again see the 

576
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:03,539
right hand, left hand towards Me.

577
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:08,380
With the right hand you see, right hand you
see, left hand towards Me and with the right

578
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,630
hand you see.

579
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:14,020
Enjoying so much, just see it's a miracle,
that's the real thing that you can't do.

580
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:18,480
You can jump, you can change your clothes,
cut your hair, cut your nose, do everything,

581
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,390
but you cannot get this cool breeze out of
your head.

582
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,321
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

583
00:54:24,321 --> 00:54:28,019
Holy Ghost is within us, reflected as the
kundalini.

584
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:33,200
See now, raise it higher, it's good.

585
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,160
It's there, it's there.

586
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,289
Now put both the hands towards Me.

587
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:42,260
See if the cool breeze is coming in the hand.

588
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:47,309
Should, but if it is not, we'll try something
else, and don't think.

589
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:49,859
It did not happen with thinking.

590
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:53,269
Now put your hands like that.

591
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:59,160
Now you can push both your hands like this
towards the sky.

592
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,730
Push back your neck also like this and ask
a question, "Mother, is this the breeze of

593
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,069
the Holy Ghost?

594
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:09,380
Mother, is this the all-pervading power of
God?

595
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,950
Mother is this the Brahma?"

596
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:16,920
Ask a question, push back your head.

597
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,549
Push back your head, and just ask.

598
00:55:21,549 --> 00:55:24,690
Now you're feeling the air conditioner, but
actually also you are feeling this breeze.

599
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,089
Put your hands towards Me.

600
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:32,359
Now see, you'll feel the breeze coming from
Me.

601
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:36,369
All right?

602
00:55:36,369 --> 00:55:45,150
Now take it down, see in your hands, are you
feeling the cool breeze?

603
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:48,279
Yes, there it is.

604
00:55:48,279 --> 00:55:55,059
One more thing we have to do now we have got
our realization.

605
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:56,980
Most of us have felt it.

606
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:02,170
Those who have not felt it, doesn't matter,
because of this center sometimes you do not

607
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:06,780
feel it, doesn't matter, but tomorrow again
you have to come and I'll establish it.

608
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,250
The one thing we have to do is protect ourselves.

609
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:13,680
Before we go out.

610
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,089
Tomorrow also before going out of the house
you protect yourself, in the night you protect

611
00:56:18,089 --> 00:56:21,849
yourself, very simple, because now the power
is flowing through your hands.

612
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:26,570
Now what you do is to put left hand towards
Me like this, or when in the house just like

613
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:27,570
this.

614
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:32,280
Now with the right hand you have to protect
your auras so no negative forces can trouble

615
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,280
you.

616
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,849
So what you do is to raise from here to the
top of your head.

617
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:39,680
Let's do seven times to seven chakras.

618
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,170
One, everybody should do it.

619
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:52,960
I don't want you to be caught up again, is
two, and everybody, whether you got realization

620
00:56:52,960 --> 00:57:04,779
or not, is, three, again, is, four, five,
six, and is seven.

621
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:08,760
Now the last thing I have to tell you is how
to raise your own kundalini.

622
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,769
You have to put this hand, I am showing now
only, before your kundalini and move your

623
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:21,559
hand in such a way that it is first above,
front, lower and back, it's like that.

624
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:26,270
Put the left hand straight, moving like that,
and this has to move like that, clockwise.

625
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:35,369
Now let's put it nearer the kundalini, lower,
lower, now start moving it, that's how it

626
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:39,249
moves, the hand, one hand, moves straight,
another goes round it.

627
00:57:39,249 --> 00:57:41,029
Now the kundalini is up.

628
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:46,539
Now make your shoulders loose, put your head
back, and give it a twist, now you have tying

629
00:57:46,539 --> 00:57:48,569
the kundalini up there.

630
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:51,039
Let's do second time again.

631
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:52,230
This is how you do it.

632
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:54,920
Three times, again you raise it.

633
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,920
Now you see it.

634
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:01,480
The left hand will move much faster, now you
push back your head, push back your shoulders,

635
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,700
and just give it a second twist.

636
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:12,539
Third time you have to give it three knots,
so again please raise it higher, push back

637
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:23,210
your head, give it one twist, then the second
twist, and the third one with a big knot.

638
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,220
Now feel it in your hands.

639
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,730
See now, the instrument will work better.

640
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:32,470
Like you see we have made our connections
better.

641
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:35,060
Right, that's it.

642
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,980
Now feel this experience.

643
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,400
This is the experience of the spirit.

644
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,920
Now what to do about it.

645
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,150
How to work it out, all those things...

646
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,269
May God bless you.
