WEBVTT

00:02.343 --> 00:06.719
Today we have come here

00:09.635 --> 00:11.926
to do Hanumana’s Puja.

00:12.594 --> 00:19.051
Shri Hanumana is a great character in our being,

00:20.469 --> 00:26.051
and He runs all the way from Swadisthana to your brain.

00:28.760 --> 00:34.010
And He supplies all the necessary guidance we need

00:34.343 --> 00:36.843
in our futuristic planning,

00:37.218 --> 00:43.135
or in our mental activities;

00:43.885 --> 00:48.885
He gives us guidance and protection.

00:55.260 --> 00:59.385
As you know that Germany is a place where

01:00.135 --> 01:04.510
people are very active, very right-sided,

01:05.135 --> 01:09.385
use their brain too much,

01:09.843 --> 01:13.759
and they are very machine-oriented also.

01:15.010 --> 01:19.635
It is very surprising how a deity like Shri Hanumana,

01:20.343 --> 01:23.343
who is an eternal child

01:23.719 --> 01:27.760
– because He was like a monkey,

01:28.010 --> 01:29.719
His head was that of a monkey,

01:29.926 --> 01:33.885
if not of an elephant – so He was an eternal child,

01:34.135 --> 01:39.051
and He was the one who was used

01:39.343 --> 01:42.719
to run the right side of human beings.

01:45.926 --> 01:49.135
He was told that “You must control the sun.”

01:49.759 --> 01:51.926
To begin with He has to control the sun,

01:52.093 --> 01:54.968
that the sun in the people,

01:55.260 --> 01:56.552
if there is too much sun

01:56.759 --> 01:58.302
then He must try to control it

01:58.552 --> 02:04.051
and make it cooler, or smoother.

02:05.093 --> 02:10.677
So – He was a child after all, so as soon He was born,

02:10.926 --> 02:14.552
when He knew that He has to look after the sun,

02:14.801 --> 02:16.260
He said, “Why not eat it off?”

02:16.510 --> 02:22.635
So He went, ran up the Virata’s body and ate up the Surya.

02:24.010 --> 02:25.135
There He had to be told,

02:25.302 --> 02:26.759
“No, no, no, no, You have to control Him.

02:26.843 --> 02:29.302
You don’t have to put Him inside your stomach!”

02:29.594 --> 02:34.051
– because He thought that this sun

02:34.385 --> 02:37.885
will be controlled better if He has it in His own stomach.

02:38.385 --> 02:44.719
So the beauty of His character is that

02:44.926 --> 02:50.801
He’s a child, and the child like behavior of Shri Hanumana

02:51.218 --> 02:55.885
has to control the right side,

02:57.010 --> 03:00.885
if there’s a right-sided mother or a right-sided father.

03:01.343 --> 03:05.469
Normally right-sided people don’t get children, normally.

03:06.051 --> 03:08.260
They’re over-right-sided,

03:08.594 --> 03:09.885
then even they get children,

03:10.093 --> 03:12.343
but they are really not liked by the children

03:12.594 --> 03:14.594
because they have no time for children,

03:14.760 --> 03:17.093
they all the time are very strict with the children,

03:17.302 --> 03:19.469
they shout them, shout at them,

03:19.677 --> 03:21.719
they don’t know how to handle the children.

03:22.093 --> 03:24.760
Or they’re over-indulgent,

03:25.218 --> 03:28.552
because they always think that “I never got this,

03:28.760 --> 03:30.885
so let me give it to the child.”

03:31.552 --> 03:33.594
So these extreme type of people

03:33.843 --> 03:38.343
who are right-sided

03:40.010 --> 03:44.677
have got this Hanumana, who is nothing but a child.

03:45.885 --> 03:52.469
He is very anxious, very anxious

03:52.677 --> 03:54.760
to do the work of Shri Rama.

03:55.093 --> 03:58.469
Now Shri Rama is a character, I would say,

03:58.719 --> 04:03.010
which is full of balance, absolutely.

04:03.302 --> 04:06.760
He’s the benevolent king which Socrates has described.

04:07.469 --> 04:11.510
So He needed somebody with Him all the time

04:12.385 --> 04:18.010
to do the work,

04:18.719 --> 04:24.635
or to supply Him or to help Him

04:25.051 --> 04:27.885
– like a secretary you can call Him;

04:29.177 --> 04:31.759
and Shri Hanumana was the one

04:32.010 --> 04:34.469
who was created for this purpose.

04:35.510 --> 04:37.677
Now Shri Rama (Shri Mataji may mean Shri Hanumana)

04:37.926 --> 04:42.469
was such a assistant;

04:42.719 --> 04:45.510
I mean, you cannot have such a word for Him.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.260
We can say He was such a servant of Shri Rama

04:48.510 --> 04:50.469
– even the servants, you see,

04:50.677 --> 04:54.801
don’t have that much of dedication for their master.

04:56.885 --> 04:59.218
We can say like a dog or a horse,

04:59.469 --> 05:06.385
but that also doesn’t have – such dedication for Shri Rama,

05:06.760 --> 05:14.677
that by the time He grew up He got “nau” nine siddhis,

05:14.885 --> 05:16.719
navadha siddhis.

05:16.926 --> 05:18.926
Nine siddhis He got.

05:20.093 --> 05:25.801
These siddhis are like this, that He could become big,

05:26.469 --> 05:30.010
He could become so heavy that nobody could lift Him;

05:31.218 --> 05:34.385
He could become so sukshma that nobody could see Him,

05:34.594 --> 05:37.385
He could become so subtle that nobody could see Him.

05:37.677 --> 05:40.885
There are nine siddhis that He got.

05:42.510 --> 05:49.385
So a person who has got the right side too much in him,

05:49.677 --> 05:53.093
He controls him with these nine siddhis.

05:56.801 --> 06:02.677
Now, how will He control a man who is running very fast

06:03.135 --> 06:04.260
in his life?

06:04.677 --> 06:08.719
What He does is to control his movement,

06:09.010 --> 06:10.760
He makes him in such a way

06:11.093 --> 06:15.719
that he has to put down his speed.

06:16.093 --> 06:18.760
He makes his feet very heavy;

06:19.343 --> 06:21.760
now he can’t do that much.

06:21.926 --> 06:25.343
Or He makes his hands very heavy,

06:25.594 --> 06:29.343
so the person cannot work very much with his hands.

06:29.677 --> 06:40.385
So He can give a tremendous kind of a lethargic heaviness

06:40.677 --> 06:46.469
to a person who is a very right-sided person.

06:49.469 --> 06:53.801
He has got another siddhis which are very interesting, is

06:54.010 --> 07:01.594
that He can extend His – He doesn’t have many weapons,

07:01.760 --> 07:04.093
He has only one gadaa in His hand

07:04.594 --> 07:11.801
– and He can extend His tail to any extent,

07:12.135 --> 07:16.343
and He can handle people with His tails,

07:16.594 --> 07:18.218
He does not have to use His hand.

07:18.385 --> 07:22.218
Sitting down here, He can put the tail around anywhere.

07:22.510 --> 07:27.385
If He wants He can just make a mountain of His tail

07:27.719 --> 07:28.719
and sit on that.

07:29.010 --> 07:31.427
Like He has all these monkey-tricks

07:31.677 --> 07:33.260
as you’re to call them, you see,

07:33.635 --> 07:37.260
and all these things He has within Himself

07:37.635 --> 07:40.510
is to control a person

07:40.801 --> 07:44.427
who is extremely right-sided, to begin with.

07:44.677 --> 07:47.302
Then He can fly in the air.

07:47.552 --> 07:54.177
Just, He doesn’t have any wings,

07:54.427 --> 07:56.510
but He can just fly in the air.

07:56.843 --> 08:00.677
That means He can become so big

08:01.177 --> 08:04.635
that the amount of air He displaces

08:04.926 --> 08:09.302
has a much more weight than His own weight

08:09.510 --> 08:11.385
– just the same principle Archimedes,

08:11.635 --> 08:13.427
if you know the Archimedes principle

08:13.759 --> 08:17.260
– that He becomes so big that His body

08:17.510 --> 08:22.759
starts floating in the air, like a boat, you see, you can call it.

08:23.051 --> 08:25.719
And He can fly in the air,

08:25.926 --> 08:34.177
and by flying in the air He can carry the messages

08:34.427 --> 08:38.177
from one to another, through the ether.

08:38.510 --> 08:42.260
Now the subtle of the ether that we have

08:42.677 --> 08:49.093
is under the command of Shri Hanumana.

08:49.385 --> 08:51.552
He is the one who controls,

08:51.968 --> 08:55.510
or He’s the Lord of this ether, the subtle of the ether

08:55.968 --> 08:59.051
or say, the causal of the ether; and through it,

08:59.260 --> 09:00.427
it communicates.

09:00.759 --> 09:03.051
All the communications that you find,

09:03.260 --> 09:07.759
like we have within ourselves also ductless glands

09:08.051 --> 09:11.385
which the pituitary is using, ductless glands,

09:11.552 --> 09:15.177
is through Hanumana’s movement;

09:15.719 --> 09:18.635
because He can go into a nirakar,

09:18.843 --> 09:20.968
He can go into a formless state.

09:21.177 --> 09:22.510
Also the communications,

09:22.719 --> 09:24.719
we use it for this communication that we have,

09:25.302 --> 09:30.385
maybe we can say that there’s a, we have got a loudspeaker,

09:30.719 --> 09:34.302
but we have a television, we have got radios

09:34.635 --> 09:36.051
and all those things.

09:36.302 --> 09:38.510
Where we catch on to the ether,

09:38.759 --> 09:44.093
anything is all the blessings of Hanumana,

09:44.385 --> 09:47.968
and are available to people who are right-sided.

09:48.385 --> 09:54.135
Only the right-sided people discover these things

09:54.302 --> 09:58.801
of the space, which we call as a cordless telephone

09:58.968 --> 10:03.385
or a thing without – we have also telegraphs and,

10:03.594 --> 10:08.469
where we don’t use any wires.

10:09.051 --> 10:12.051
So without any connection through the ether,

10:12.260 --> 10:13.427
He can manage.

10:13.635 --> 10:20.051
So all the ethereal connections has been done

10:20.302 --> 10:23.177
by this great engineer, Shri Hanumana.

10:23.427 --> 10:26.926
And it is so perfect, it’s so perfect

10:27.177 --> 10:29.385
that you cannot challenge it,

10:29.635 --> 10:31.177
and you cannot find faults with it.

10:31.427 --> 10:33.801
Maybe your instruments may not be all right,

10:34.135 --> 10:37.510
but as far as His ethereal work is concerned,

10:37.759 --> 10:39.302
He’s perfectly there.

10:39.635 --> 10:42.510
Now the scientists discover it and think that

10:42.719 --> 10:48.302
it is in the nature, but they never think, how can it be?

10:48.719 --> 10:50.635
We say something in the ether

10:50.843 --> 10:53.801
and how is it, it is received on the other end?

10:54.051 --> 10:56.760
They just take it for granted that it is so, that

10:56.926 --> 11:00.843
we say something here or we relay something

11:01.177 --> 11:04.635
on the television and it is seen the other side.

11:04.760 --> 11:10.051
But they never even think or search out how it is done,

11:10.385 --> 11:11.343
what is the way.

11:11.635 --> 11:16.635
And this is what is the work of Shri Hanumana,

11:16.843 --> 11:23.843
who has done such a beautiful network,

11:24.385 --> 11:28.177
and through that network all these things work out.

11:28.635 --> 11:32.051
So even on the right side

11:32.552 --> 11:39.218
the vibrations we get in the molecules,

11:40.635 --> 11:43.926
as you know that we get molecules like sulfur dioxide,

11:44.177 --> 11:46.385
if you have the sulfur, has two oxygen,

11:46.552 --> 11:50.968
and the oxygen goes on pulsating like that.

11:51.218 --> 11:53.677
They are asymmetric, symmetric type of vibrations,

11:53.843 --> 11:55.302
you all must be knowing about it.

11:55.552 --> 11:58.677
So all these things, symmetric and asymmetric vibrations

11:58.968 --> 12:01.760
are created by whom? Nobody wants to know,

12:02.051 --> 12:03.302
nobody wants to find out,

12:03.510 --> 12:05.218
because after all in an atom or...

12:05.427 --> 12:10.051
So imagine, in a molecule, that deep, who does that job?

12:10.302 --> 12:14.427
It’s done by Shri Hanuman, in His subtle ways.

12:14.677 --> 12:16.760
So He has another great,

12:16.968 --> 12:24.510
great siddhi which we call as anima.

12:24.801 --> 12:28.177
Anima, anu – “anu” means a molecule,

12:28.719 --> 12:31.385
and that means it can enter into a molecule,

12:31.594 --> 12:35.594
or “renu” is the atom.

12:35.801 --> 12:38.594
It can enter into molecule or into atom.

12:38.719 --> 12:40.302
Now, many scientists think that they have,

12:40.510 --> 12:43.010
in the modern times they discovered the molecules.

12:43.177 --> 12:47.510
It’s not so, because it’s already in our oldest scriptures,

12:47.759 --> 12:52.177
description of anima is there, is of anu, renu is there,

12:52.385 --> 12:55.135
so is already described there.

12:55.719 --> 13:00.635
Now, then whatever, wherever you see

13:01.135 --> 13:05.010
the electromagnetic forces working,

13:05.177 --> 13:09.135
it is worked through Hanumana’s blessings.

13:09.385 --> 13:14.260
He is the one who creates electromagnetic forces.

13:14.594 --> 13:18.385
So now we can see that as Ganesha

13:18.635 --> 13:22.051
has got the magnetic force in Him – He’s the magnet,

13:22.385 --> 13:24.759
He’s the, He has got the magnetic force

13:25.135 --> 13:29.010
– then we can say the electromagnetic is,

13:30.010 --> 13:33.843
is the one which we call as Hanumana’s force,

13:34.135 --> 13:36.135
on the material side of it.

13:36.594 --> 13:43.385
But from the matter He goes up to the brain.

13:43.635 --> 13:49.759
So He rises from Swadisthana up to the brain,

13:50.010 --> 13:56.843
so in the brain also He creates the co-relationships

13:57.302 --> 14:02.469
of the different sides of our brain.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.594
So how much He gives us.

14:04.759 --> 14:09.926
I mean, we can say if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

14:10.177 --> 14:13.510
then He gives us the power to think.

14:13.801 --> 14:18.302
He protects us also, that we should not think of bad things.

14:18.594 --> 14:20.594
That is, we can say that,

14:20.801 --> 14:25.801
that if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

14:26.260 --> 14:32.135
then Shri Hanumana gives us the conscience.

14:33.510 --> 14:36.260
I hope you understand the difference between the two.

14:36.510 --> 14:40.260
Wisdom is where you do not need conscience so much

14:40.510 --> 14:43.302
because you are wise, you know what is good, what is bad.

14:43.594 --> 14:46.135
But conscience is needed in a personality

14:46.510 --> 14:49.594
where he is to be controlled,

14:49.801 --> 14:54.177
and that control comes from Shri Hanumana,

14:54.469 --> 14:56.801
which is the conscience in the human being.

14:57.510 --> 15:00.051
Now this conscience which is Shri Hanumana

15:00.260 --> 15:06.177
is the subtle form of Him which gives us

15:06.469 --> 15:09.051
– is in Sanskrit called as “satasat vivekabuddhi”:

15:09.260 --> 15:12.594
means, “sat” means truth,

15:12.885 --> 15:15.051
“asat” means untruth,

15:15.302 --> 15:18.510
and “viveka” means the discrimination,

15:18.759 --> 15:22.594
and “buddhi” means the intelligence.

15:22.801 --> 15:28.926
So, intelligence to discriminate between

15:29.260 --> 15:35.594
the truth and untruth is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

15:36.968 --> 15:39.552
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

15:40.968 --> 15:45.968
if we say that Ganesha is the one who gives us,

15:46.302 --> 15:47.510
He’s the adhyaksha,

15:47.759 --> 15:49.635
means He is the – I call Him

15:49.760 --> 15:52.093
as the chancellor of the university.

15:52.427 --> 15:54.760
He is the one who goes on degree to us,

15:55.051 --> 15:59.552
“Now you have crossed this chakra, that chakra, that chakra.”

16:00.302 --> 16:06.760
And He helps us to know that what state we are in.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.926
So the Ganesha gives us, say,

16:10.218 --> 16:11.635
nirvichara samadhi

16:11.843 --> 16:14.843
which we can call it as the thoughtless awareness,

16:15.051 --> 16:16.843
and nirvikalpa samadhi.

16:17.302 --> 16:21.093
He gives all that, and also He gives us joy.

16:22.759 --> 16:35.093
But the understanding that this is good,

16:35.843 --> 16:38.427
this is for our benevolence,

16:40.302 --> 16:46.759
mental understanding, comes to us from Shri Hanumana.

16:47.051 --> 16:50.968
And it’s very important for Western people

16:51.218 --> 16:52.843
because it has to be mental,

16:53.093 --> 16:55.177
otherwise they won’t understand.

16:55.759 --> 16:58.760
If it is not mental they cannot come into abstract.

16:59.093 --> 17:00.302
It has to be mental.

17:00.677 --> 17:05.635
And so the mental understanding of whether it is good or bad

17:05.926 --> 17:08.677
is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

17:08.926 --> 17:13.635
Without Him, even if you become a saint

17:14.051 --> 17:16.760
you will be – of course, you are a saint

17:17.051 --> 17:19.677
and you will enjoy the saintliness;

17:19.968 --> 17:24.302
but whether this saintliness is

17:24.843 --> 17:26.843
all right if you live on Himalayas,

17:27.051 --> 17:30.926
or is all right when you go across to people

17:31.093 --> 17:34.051
to give them realization – all this scanning,

17:34.302 --> 17:36.677
this vivekabuddhi, all this scanning,

17:36.843 --> 17:40.843
all this discrimination, all this guidance,

17:41.177 --> 17:45.677
all this protection is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

17:46.759 --> 17:49.801
Germany being a country which is very, very much,

17:49.968 --> 17:52.635
I should say, an essence of right side;

17:53.177 --> 17:56.968
and because of it being such an essence of right side,

17:57.177 --> 18:01.051
is important to get the protector of right side

18:01.759 --> 18:03.760
here worshipped.

18:04.302 --> 18:08.427
But in all that vivekabuddhi,

18:08.677 --> 18:11.760
in that discrimination He knows one thing,

18:12.177 --> 18:16.760
that He’s absolutely subservient to Shri Rama.

18:17.343 --> 18:18.759
Now what is Shri Rama?

18:18.885 --> 18:21.051
Shri Rama is the benevolent king,

18:21.218 --> 18:23.427
He works for the benevolence.

18:23.759 --> 18:28.427
And Shri Rama Himself is a formal king,

18:28.635 --> 18:29.968
like sankocha, we call it – I mean,

18:30.093 --> 18:32.302
the English words are not so good to explain this,

18:32.510 --> 18:36.635
but Shri Rama is the one who is,

18:37.926 --> 18:40.051
who will not push forward Himself.

18:40.635 --> 18:43.177
He keeps back. He’s very balanced,

18:43.343 --> 18:45.968
He is a very poised person.

18:46.427 --> 18:48.843
So the Hanumana, you see,

18:49.177 --> 18:53.552
He, He is the one who is always anxious

18:53.760 --> 18:55.926
to do the work of Shri Rama, always.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.968
If Shri Rama says, “All right, you go and get the...”

18:59.302 --> 19:03.218
He told Him, “go and get the...” – sanjeevani

19:03.469 --> 19:07.343
is the kind of a herb that was needed

19:07.677 --> 19:10.427
to bring Lakshmana to life

19:10.759 --> 19:14.302
– He went there and He brought the whole mountain with Him,

19:14.469 --> 19:17.218
“Now, better have it.” It’s like that sort of a person,

19:17.552 --> 19:21.093
you see, so He brought the – that’s childlike behavior of His.

19:21.343 --> 19:26.677
And the discrimination in this is that,

19:26.968 --> 19:29.093
that “If Shri Rama has asked for,

19:29.302 --> 19:31.093
whatever He asks for, I’ll do it.”

19:31.343 --> 19:34.677
So is a relationship of a, I would say,

19:34.968 --> 19:36.843
like a guru and [*]shishya.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.760
But even more than that, that the shishya

19:40.093 --> 19:44.010
is just like a subservient servant,

19:44.218 --> 19:47.343
absolutely surrendered to God,

19:49.759 --> 19:51.843
absolutely surrendered to God,

19:52.093 --> 19:54.302
and His main thing is surrender.

19:54.552 --> 19:58.302
Now see, this surrender itself

19:58.885 --> 20:01.968
shows that all those who are right-sided people

20:02.177 --> 20:07.218
are surrendered to God, not surrendered to their bosses.

20:07.469 --> 20:09.343
Mostly all those right-sided people

20:09.552 --> 20:11.093
are very surrendered to their bosses,

20:11.343 --> 20:13.302
surrendered to their jobs,

20:13.594 --> 20:16.010
sometimes surrendered to their wives also.

20:16.552 --> 20:20.218
But they are subservient to wrong people,

20:20.469 --> 20:22.594
they have no discretion.

20:23.010 --> 20:25.427
You’ll always find that, they have no discretion.

20:25.677 --> 20:28.469
But if you take the help of Hanumana,

20:28.677 --> 20:31.218
then He tells you that you have to be

20:31.469 --> 20:34.843
surrendered to God Almighty and not to anybody else,

20:35.010 --> 20:37.343
or to your Guru like Rama.

20:37.677 --> 20:40.760
Otherwise you are not to be surrendered to anybody else.

20:41.093 --> 20:42.843
And then you are a free bird,

20:43.010 --> 20:46.469
and you have all the nine powers within yourself.

20:46.759 --> 20:54.760
Hanumana’s whole thing is to antidote your overactivity,

20:55.010 --> 20:59.885
to antidote your too-much thinking,

21:00.218 --> 21:02.635
to antidote your ego.

21:02.885 --> 21:07.218
Now, how He finishes the ego of people

21:07.427 --> 21:11.760
is very sweetly shown when He burnt the whole of Lanka

21:12.093 --> 21:19.093
– is the capital of Ravana

21:19.760 --> 21:21.843
– and the way He made fun of him.

21:22.177 --> 21:25.677
Because you see, anybody who is egoistical,

21:26.010 --> 21:29.010
one must make fun of him, then he’s all right.

21:29.302 --> 21:34.427
Like first He went and when Ravana saw Him,

21:34.552 --> 21:37.843
he said, “Who are You? Who are You, the monkey?”

21:38.177 --> 21:41.469
So He just pushed His tail towards him,

21:41.760 --> 21:45.177
and tickled his nose with His tail.

21:48.010 --> 21:53.010
So He’s the one who makes fun of egoistical people.

21:53.302 --> 21:55.677
Now, if somebody egoistical tries to trouble you,

21:55.968 --> 21:58.968
He’s the one; He’ll make such fun out of him

21:59.218 --> 22:01.759
that you’ll be amazed how this fellow was jumping,

22:01.885 --> 22:03.759
like a Humpty-Dumpty has fallen down

22:03.968 --> 22:05.010
and has broken his crown.

22:05.302 --> 22:08.218
So you see, it is the job of Hanumana

22:08.427 --> 22:12.177
to protect you from egoistical people.

22:12.427 --> 22:14.968
And also He protects the egoistical people

22:15.302 --> 22:19.759
by showing them down – like, say, Saddam.

22:20.051 --> 22:23.801
In the case of Saddam I just asked Hanumana to do the job,

22:24.051 --> 22:25.510
because I know He’ll do it.

22:25.801 --> 22:29.135
Now, how He has put this Saddam

22:29.385 --> 22:31.469
into different circumstances,

22:31.760 --> 22:34.051
that he doesn’t know what to do,

22:34.343 --> 22:36.677
he doesn’t know how to go.

22:36.760 --> 22:39.885
Because supposing he says, “All right, I’ll have war”;

22:40.218 --> 22:43.135
so the whole of Iraq will be finished,

22:43.594 --> 22:44.594
he’ll be finished,

22:44.760 --> 22:47.677
Kuwait will be finished, all petrol will be finished, all right.

22:47.885 --> 22:49.260
Everybody will be in trouble.

22:49.510 --> 22:52.343
But what about him? – he won’t be there, too.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.510
Because if the Americans have to fight,

22:54.719 --> 22:56.760
they will go in his place and fight.

22:57.051 --> 22:58.385
They won’t fight in America,

22:58.635 --> 23:00.594
he’s not going to go to America to fight them.

23:00.719 --> 23:02.051
Few Americans may be dead.

23:02.469 --> 23:06.260
So now, in this Saddam’s brain

23:06.469 --> 23:08.385
also Hanumana is working and telling him,

23:08.594 --> 23:14.010
“Now see, Mister, if you do like this, then this will happen.”

23:17.093 --> 23:19.469
He works into the brains of all the politicians,

23:19.760 --> 23:21.677
all these egoistical people.

23:22.093 --> 23:26.093
And then, then they get sometimes stunned,

23:26.343 --> 23:28.010
sometimes they change their policies,

23:28.260 --> 23:32.260
they come round and that’s how they manage.

23:32.552 --> 23:38.260
Also another great quality of Hanumana is that He makes,

23:38.926 --> 23:43.885
makes people – sort of an arbitrator He is

23:44.218 --> 23:46.801
– He makes people meet each other.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.385
And two egoistical people,

23:49.594 --> 23:50.885
He will make them meet,

23:51.093 --> 23:53.135
and then He’ll create such situation

23:53.385 --> 23:56.093
that they both become friends and become mild.

23:56.343 --> 24:03.552
So His whole character within us acts us to see our ego,

24:03.885 --> 24:07.677
discriminate that “Oh, this is my ego that is working,”

24:07.801 --> 24:13.385
and then to become childlike and sweet,

24:13.677 --> 24:15.218
mirthful and happy.

24:15.469 --> 24:17.093
He’s always in a dancing mood,

24:17.343 --> 24:18.885
all the time He’s dancing,

24:19.093 --> 24:22.594
and before Rama He’s always bowed down,

24:22.926 --> 24:28.260
and always wants to do whatever is the desire of Shri Ram.

24:28.594 --> 24:31.552
So if Ganesha stands behind Me,

24:31.677 --> 24:33.926
Hanumana stands here at My feet,

24:34.260 --> 24:35.385
and He’s there.

24:35.719 --> 24:40.010
In the same way I would say, if Germany – as Philip,

24:40.260 --> 24:44.594
he has asked Me that if

24:45.093 --> 24:47.926
Germany can become like Hanumana

24:48.469 --> 24:50.469
– then what a dynamic force we have,

24:50.885 --> 24:53.135
if they become so subservient.

24:53.594 --> 24:58.385
And the subservient nature of Hanumana

24:58.801 --> 25:00.677
is seen to such an extent that,

25:01.135 --> 25:02.719
as you know the story of Sita

25:02.968 --> 25:05.594
when She gave a necklace to Him

25:05.801 --> 25:09.719
and He wouldn’t wear it, because inside there was no Ram.

25:10.677 --> 25:14.177
Once, Sita felt that all the time He is around,

25:14.427 --> 25:19.218
and so He’s sort of cutting out Her privacy.

25:19.552 --> 25:24.552
So She said, “Now, You can be there only for one work.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.218
You need not to do every work.”

25:26.343 --> 25:27.760
He used to do every work of Shri Rama.

25:28.051 --> 25:29.885
She said, “For one work You should be there.

25:30.093 --> 25:31.343
Choose whichever work You want to do.”

25:31.552 --> 25:36.759
He said, “Only, you see, I would like to be with Shri Ram,

25:36.885 --> 25:40.177
that whenever He sneezes I should do like this.”

25:40.343 --> 25:41.635
You see, in India when we sneeze,

25:41.760 --> 25:42.968
we have to do like this with this;

25:43.218 --> 25:45.469
because the sneezing is, you see, avoids,

25:45.759 --> 25:49.760
to avoid all the negativity to go out.

25:49.968 --> 25:51.635
So we do like this if you sneeze.

25:51.968 --> 25:57.968
Or if you feel sleepy

25:59.343 --> 26:03.552
and you yawn, then also we do like that, mostly.

26:03.801 --> 26:08.385
So He said, “Whenever He’ll yawn, You allow Me just to...”

26:08.759 --> 26:09.843
– this we call as chutki,

26:10.051 --> 26:12.427
I don’t know what you call this, chutki –

26:12.635 --> 26:14.427
“allow Me to do this.”

26:14.926 --> 26:17.051
Sita said, “This is something very little work,

26:17.260 --> 26:19.260
you see, this fellow then will be out of sight.”

26:19.677 --> 26:20.801
So He stood there.

26:21.260 --> 26:23.177
So She said, “Now, why are You standing here?”

26:23.385 --> 26:25.552
“I am waiting for that.

26:30.177 --> 26:32.302
So how can I go?”

26:32.926 --> 26:35.801
And that’s how – She granted, first She granted,

26:35.968 --> 26:37.260
“All right, given to You this job,”

26:37.510 --> 26:40.260
now She can’t take it back because She’s granted this job.

26:40.427 --> 26:44.135
So He’s always there like this standing,

26:44.302 --> 26:46.719
just to do this to Shri Ram.

26:46.926 --> 26:49.385
So I mean, the sweetness of the whole thing

26:49.635 --> 26:54.968
is that every time, every minute He is subservient,

26:55.302 --> 26:58.260
He’s attentive, He’s there.

26:58.968 --> 27:03.385
Also in Sahaja Yoga

27:05.385 --> 27:11.759
I have relationships with you as a Guru, as a Mother

27:16.801 --> 27:19.135
and, I don’t know, unlimited.

27:19.385 --> 27:22.427
But still these two relationships we know of,

27:22.635 --> 27:24.926
that I’m your Mother and I’m your Guru.

27:25.260 --> 27:28.051
Now My – as a Guru,

27:28.385 --> 27:31.510
My main concern is that

27:31.926 --> 27:34.843
you should learn all about Sahaja Yog,

27:35.260 --> 27:38.635
you should become experts of Sahaja Yoga,

27:38.801 --> 27:41.385
and you should become yourself the gurus.

27:41.594 --> 27:43.552
It’s the only concern I have.

27:43.801 --> 27:46.385
But for that, complete surrender is required.

27:46.635 --> 27:48.302
“Islam” means surrender.

27:48.635 --> 27:49.926
So you have to surrender.

27:50.177 --> 27:51.594
If you are surrendered,

27:51.801 --> 27:54.843
then only you can learn what is the,

27:55.135 --> 28:01.843
what is the way you will handle Sahaja Yoga.

28:02.135 --> 28:04.719
Now, even this surrendering

28:05.051 --> 28:07.427
is done by Shri Hanumana.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.885
He’s the one who teaches you how to surrender now

28:11.177 --> 28:13.302
or makes you surrender,

28:13.677 --> 28:16.552
because egoistical people don’t surrender.

28:16.759 --> 28:20.635
Then He puts some sort of hurdles

28:20.760 --> 28:24.635
or some sort of miracles or some tricks,

28:25.093 --> 28:32.760
by which then a disciple surrenders himself to the Guru.

28:33.093 --> 28:34.552
Otherwise he’s not surrendered,

28:34.760 --> 28:36.759
he finds it difficult to surrender,

28:37.093 --> 28:43.552
and the force that acts to make him surrender to the Guru

28:43.677 --> 28:46.343
is also that of Hanumana.

28:48.093 --> 28:50.218
So not that He is only surrendered,

28:50.427 --> 28:53.177
but He makes others also to be surrendered.

28:53.343 --> 28:56.302
Because only the – because of ego you cannot surrender,

28:56.759 --> 28:59.552
so He’s the one who fights your ego,

28:59.885 --> 29:04.677
and He puts it down and makes you surrender.

29:05.093 --> 29:07.968
So in His own expression,

29:08.177 --> 29:14.759
I would say that what He has shown that

29:15.469 --> 29:20.218
there’s a very beautiful area of right side.

29:20.469 --> 29:24.677
If it is to be perfectly enjoyed

29:24.885 --> 29:28.968
then you should be completely surrendered to your Guru,

29:30.010 --> 29:32.760
as if you are the servant of that Guru.

29:32.926 --> 29:37.801
Whatever you have to do for that Guru,

29:37.968 --> 29:38.968
you have to do it.

29:39.177 --> 29:40.968
Of course, you must know that your Guru

29:41.177 --> 29:43.510
has to give you realization, minimum,

29:43.719 --> 29:45.719
otherwise that’s not a guru.

29:45.968 --> 29:48.926
But anybody who has given you the realization,

29:49.260 --> 29:51.260
you have to be so surrendered

29:51.510 --> 29:53.759
that you should be just like a servant,

29:53.926 --> 29:55.719
not to feel shy about it.

29:55.926 --> 29:57.302
Like I would now sometimes,

29:57.510 --> 29:59.385
you know, I am going by, say,

29:59.594 --> 30:02.427
I’m going by aeroplane,

30:02.926 --> 30:07.135
and sometimes I cannot wear My shoes

30:07.302 --> 30:09.510
because they’re so swollen up.

30:09.926 --> 30:12.385
So normally I would take the shoes in My hands

30:12.594 --> 30:13.968
and walk about.

30:14.135 --> 30:15.759
But I have seen Sahaja yogis,

30:15.926 --> 30:17.926
they pick up My shoes also and walk with it,

30:18.302 --> 30:20.302
and they don’t feel shy about it.

30:20.427 --> 30:23.719
They just feel so proud that they are carrying My shoes.

30:24.260 --> 30:25.635
So there is not

30:25.801 --> 30:29.177
– one should feel proud that you are doing all these things,

30:29.385 --> 30:32.926
that you have a chance to do all these things for your Guru,

30:33.177 --> 30:36.510
and that you are surrendering to that Guru;

30:36.635 --> 30:39.427
you are absolutely only bothered

30:39.635 --> 30:41.719
as to how you can serve the Guru,

30:41.843 --> 30:43.427
how you can please the Guru,

30:43.759 --> 30:47.635
and how you could be closer to that Guru.

30:47.968 --> 30:50.510
It doesn’t mean physical closeness

30:50.719 --> 30:54.926
but a kind of a rapport, a kind of an understanding.

30:55.177 --> 30:58.801
Even those who are away from Me can feel Me in their heart.

30:59.135 --> 31:00.968
And this is what it is, that

31:01.260 --> 31:07.759
we have to get this power from Shri Hanumana.

31:08.260 --> 31:12.719
Now, He’s the one who protects also all the deities.

31:12.926 --> 31:15.135
He protects. Now, there’s a difference

31:15.427 --> 31:18.385
between Shri Ganesha and Him.

31:18.635 --> 31:23.552
The Shri Ganesha gives energy shakti,

31:23.926 --> 31:26.759
but the one who protects is Shri Hanumana.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.719
So you’ll find that when Shri Krishna

31:29.843 --> 31:33.177
was the chariot of Arjuna,

31:34.177 --> 31:37.635
then on top of the chariot was sitting Hanumana,

31:37.801 --> 31:39.385
not Shri Ganesh.

31:39.719 --> 31:43.051
Hanumana was sitting there looking after Him.

31:44.385 --> 31:48.843
Also in a way that Shri Rama Himself becomes Shri Vishnu,

31:49.051 --> 31:51.510
so He has to look after Him.

31:53.051 --> 31:54.801
He is an angel, as you know:

31:55.051 --> 31:59.302
according to Christian, we should say according to Bible,

31:59.719 --> 32:02.843
that He is the angel called Gabriel.

32:05.051 --> 32:08.801
Now Gabriel is the one who brought the message,

32:09.051 --> 32:13.302
because He’s always a messenger, to Maria,

32:13.635 --> 32:16.926
and it’s surprisingly the words He used were

32:17.135 --> 32:21.968
“Immaculata Salve” – that’s My name.

32:22.260 --> 32:23.635
My first name is Nirmala,

32:23.843 --> 32:26.135
means “Immaculata” and surname is Salve.

32:26.510 --> 32:28.260
He said those words to Her.

32:28.635 --> 32:31.302
And today also I was surprised

32:31.801 --> 32:35.260
when it came to giving Me a present,

32:35.552 --> 32:39.302
they found a tea-set and dinner-set

32:39.635 --> 32:41.510
which is called as “Maria.”

32:41.801 --> 32:46.510
So Maria has to do quite a lot with Hanumana all Her life.

32:46.801 --> 32:49.385
That means Maria is the Mahalakshmi.

32:49.635 --> 32:54.385
Mahalakshmi being the Sita, Sita then Radha,

32:54.926 --> 32:57.801
Hanumana has to be there to serve Her.

32:58.135 --> 33:01.552
And that is why, you see, sometimes

33:01.968 --> 33:05.177
people say, “Mother, how did You know?

33:05.427 --> 33:07.510
Mother, how did You come to know?

33:07.926 --> 33:11.427
Mother, how did You send a message?

33:11.759 --> 33:14.427
Mother, how did You work it out?” Can you imagine?

33:14.719 --> 33:18.968
This is Shri Hanumana’s headache, He does it.

33:19.302 --> 33:21.385
Anything passes through My mind,

33:21.552 --> 33:23.177
He just takes it up and it’s done.

33:23.427 --> 33:26.635
Because as I told you that His whole organization

33:26.843 --> 33:28.510
is so well planned;

33:28.759 --> 33:30.843
all these messages, from where do they get them?

33:31.051 --> 33:33.051
Many people say, “Mother, I just prayed to You.”

33:33.719 --> 33:35.385
There was a gentleman

33:35.635 --> 33:37.051
whose mother was very sick

33:37.385 --> 33:38.759
and he went to see her,

33:39.051 --> 33:42.801
and she was just going to die with cancer.

33:43.135 --> 33:44.719
So he said, “I didn’t know what to do,

33:44.843 --> 33:45.801
so I just prayed to You,

33:45.968 --> 33:47.801
"Mother, please save my mother.”

33:48.051 --> 33:50.759
Now the sincerity of that person,

33:51.135 --> 33:54.926
the depth of that person as a Sahaja yogi Hanumana knows.

33:55.260 --> 33:58.135
He knows what is the weight of this person is.

33:59.051 --> 34:01.051
And immediately, you’ll be surprised,

34:01.260 --> 34:04.719
within three days the woman who was going to die survived,

34:04.926 --> 34:05.843
she got all right.

34:06.051 --> 34:08.427
He brought her to Bombay and the doctor said,

34:08.594 --> 34:10.510
“She has no cancer.”

34:11.801 --> 34:13.635
Many things which you call miracles

34:13.926 --> 34:16.177
are done by Shri Hanuman.

34:16.719 --> 34:20.177
He’s the one who is the doer of miracles.

34:20.427 --> 34:25.719
He does miracles also to show how stupid you are,

34:27.427 --> 34:28.594
how foolish you are,

34:28.843 --> 34:31.759
because He is on the right side,

34:31.926 --> 34:33.759
see He goes to the ego side.

34:34.051 --> 34:36.594
Now with the ego a human being

34:36.759 --> 34:40.759
is always becomes stupid – that’s, I mean, inevitable.

34:41.051 --> 34:44.260
With ego they become so stupid, “Oh, what’s wrong?”

34:44.719 --> 34:46.427
And that’s why you will find

34:46.719 --> 34:48.260
many people doing such stupid things,

34:48.510 --> 34:49.801
we can’t understand why they do it.

34:50.135 --> 34:52.010
They say, “What’s wrong?”

34:52.260 --> 34:56.427
What’s wrong is that Hanumana doesn’t like it is the point,

34:56.719 --> 34:59.801
and then it recoils.

35:00.302 --> 35:02.719
When they act stupidly it recoils

35:02.843 --> 35:06.719
and then they know that we have done such a big mistake,

35:06.926 --> 35:08.759
or it was all stupid.

35:09.051 --> 35:13.010
But sometimes it could be extremely, extremely

35:13.926 --> 35:17.051
difficult to retrace back;

35:17.302 --> 35:21.719
like the diseases, as I call it the yuppies disease,

35:21.926 --> 35:23.177
which is now impossible

35:23.385 --> 35:25.177
because Hanumana has taken away

35:25.385 --> 35:26.594
the electromagnetic force

35:26.759 --> 35:28.801
from these people and it doesn’t work,

35:29.051 --> 35:30.719
it doesn’t relate to your conscious mind.

35:30.926 --> 35:33.594
So your conscious mind cannot act, it just goes off.

35:34.010 --> 35:36.719
Only these people, if they worship Hanumana

35:37.010 --> 35:41.302
with the same devotion, then maybe they might be saved.

35:41.635 --> 35:44.302
But it’s not a easy thing to convince these stupid yuppies,

35:44.594 --> 35:45.759
you see, about anything.

35:45.968 --> 35:48.177
They say, “We don’t believe. So what?”

35:48.385 --> 35:49.926
So what, you die – what else?

35:50.177 --> 35:55.260
That’s the only limit, that’s the only life left for you,

35:55.427 --> 35:57.177
and you do that.

35:58.427 --> 36:00.801
There are so many aspects of Hanumana

36:01.051 --> 36:03.801
which I could have told you;

36:04.135 --> 36:07.843
but for example, for His body,

36:08.135 --> 36:11.385
you see, like Shiva is covered with the gheru.

36:11.594 --> 36:14.135
What you call gheru is a,

36:14.801 --> 36:17.010
that’s a kind of a, you know that gheru is,

36:17.260 --> 36:22.801
it’s a red-colored stone which is very, very, it is very hot.

36:23.051 --> 36:25.843
And supposing with the cold

36:26.135 --> 36:29.759
sometimes you develop those rashes,

36:30.010 --> 36:32.719
so if you put gheru those rashes are corrected.

36:32.926 --> 36:35.260
Or you get, due to badha sometimes,

36:35.510 --> 36:38.719
some sort of skin-diseases which are cured with gheru;

36:38.926 --> 36:41.385
because it is the one which is very hot,

36:41.677 --> 36:42.968
and it soothes you down.

36:43.218 --> 36:45.552
On the contrary Shri Ganesha

36:45.760 --> 36:48.677
is covered with lead oxide,

36:48.885 --> 36:52.177
with the red lead oxide which is,

36:52.427 --> 36:56.010
which is extremely cold.

36:56.302 --> 36:59.010
Lead oxide is a very cold thing.

36:59.218 --> 37:01.760
If you touch lead, you see, it’s a very cold thing.

37:01.968 --> 37:05.968
So that lead oxide is used to cover all His body,

37:07.218 --> 37:12.343
is there to balance the heat that He has,

37:12.635 --> 37:14.677
or the effects of heat He has.

37:14.885 --> 37:19.469
So we call this in Sanskrit language is called as sindhura,

37:19.843 --> 37:22.469
and also in Marathi or Hindi called shindhura.

37:22.759 --> 37:26.010
So they must find always this is the color of that thing;

37:26.218 --> 37:32.218
so luckily I got this sari in Vienna,

37:32.469 --> 37:37.010
and I have it very nice for this occasion.

37:37.302 --> 37:40.552
So He’s always covered with that color,

37:40.843 --> 37:43.759
what you call this sindhur color.

37:44.552 --> 37:49.552
And lead oxide, though they say it causes cancer,

37:49.885 --> 37:52.677
people say that lead oxide can cause you cancer;

37:52.968 --> 37:56.218
but it is the lead oxide which is very cold,

37:56.469 --> 37:58.010
it can cool you down so much

37:58.302 --> 38:00.093
that you can go to the left side.

38:00.343 --> 38:02.469
And cancer is a psychosomatic disease,

38:02.760 --> 38:05.552
and that might be the reason it might cause,

38:05.760 --> 38:07.968
in a very far-fetched way we can say,

38:08.218 --> 38:10.427
can cause cancer to you.

38:10.635 --> 38:12.968
Because if it is too cold and all that

38:13.427 --> 38:15.218
and then you go to the left side,

38:15.552 --> 38:18.177
and the left side you can catch the viruses,

38:18.469 --> 38:21.010
by which you can get into troubles.

38:21.385 --> 38:25.427
So, but the same lead oxide is all right for people

38:25.719 --> 38:29.051
who are very right-sided.

38:29.302 --> 38:33.260
For them if it is put on their Agnya it cools them down,

38:33.510 --> 38:34.719
they are cooled down.

38:34.968 --> 38:38.135
And it’s very good for them to put on their Agnya,

38:38.385 --> 38:39.635
so that they are cooled down.

38:39.843 --> 38:42.552
Their anger goes down, their temper goes down,

38:42.843 --> 38:44.759
and it’s a very good thing.

38:45.427 --> 38:47.759
So He’s the one who cures our anger,

38:47.968 --> 38:53.427
He’s the one who cures our hastiness,

38:53.843 --> 38:56.801
our speediness,

38:57.801 --> 38:59.552
our aggressiveness.

38:59.926 --> 39:01.719
He’s the one who does it.

39:01.926 --> 39:04.385
Now, He played a trick on Hitler. How?

39:04.635 --> 39:09.510
Hitler was using Shri Ganesha as a symbol,

39:09.759 --> 39:14.510
so this swastika was made in a clockwise manner.

39:14.926 --> 39:16.968
Then Hanumana played a trick on him.

39:17.427 --> 39:19.510
What He did, He made the

39:21.594 --> 39:26.510
stencil which they were using for making the,

39:28.302 --> 39:31.594
what you call the, making the swastika.

39:31.926 --> 39:36.469
He put it, somehow or other, lot of – I mean,

39:36.635 --> 39:39.177
He made it in such a way that they said,

39:39.302 --> 39:40.594
“We should use the other side.”

39:40.801 --> 39:44.759
As soon as they used the other side – it’s Hanumana’s trick;

39:45.177 --> 39:48.051
I suggested to Him, but I mean, He played the trick

39:48.469 --> 39:52.759
– they started using Ganesha from the other side.

39:52.926 --> 39:55.469
The same Ganesha about whom

39:57.177 --> 39:59.926
Shri Hanumana was worried how will He,

40:00.302 --> 40:02.385
how can He surpass Shri Ganesha,

40:02.635 --> 40:06.385
because He is the eldest, and how can you go beyond Him?

40:07.051 --> 40:10.552
And He is the deity, but Hanumana is an angel.

40:10.843 --> 40:14.177
So as soon as the trick was played,

40:14.427 --> 40:19.385
then both of them put together stopped Hitler from winning.

40:19.635 --> 40:21.968
This is how the trick was played.

40:22.218 --> 40:25.760
So all these little, little tricks, you see, are there.

40:26.093 --> 40:29.926
Once I remember I had My Puja in Germany;

40:30.302 --> 40:34.427
and Germany is the place where these tricks are played

40:34.760 --> 40:36.302
very much by Hanumana,

40:36.552 --> 40:39.177
because I have told you that they are the ones

40:39.427 --> 40:40.759
who require Him the most.

40:41.177 --> 40:43.801
So there was in Germany, there was a puja,

40:43.968 --> 40:47.677
and in the puja by mistake they put it the other way round

40:48.051 --> 40:49.385
– by mistake.

40:49.926 --> 40:52.926
I didn’t see. I, normally I always watch very carefully,

40:53.177 --> 40:55.302
but I don’t know why, that day I didn’t see it:

40:55.552 --> 40:57.385
it must be also Hanumana’s trick.

40:57.635 --> 40:59.510
And when I saw, I said,

40:59.759 --> 41:02.677
“Oh God, where is it going to now hurt?

41:02.968 --> 41:04.759
Where is it going to work out?

41:05.093 --> 41:07.051
Which country it is going to hit?”

41:07.302 --> 41:13.427
It did not hit Germany, it hit England.

41:13.677 --> 41:16.759
Because England, I have worked so hard there

41:16.926 --> 41:19.427
and they have been so negligent about Sahaja Yoga,

41:19.635 --> 41:23.427
so lethargic about it, that it just went and hit there.

41:23.759 --> 41:28.968
So He is the one who goes like a torrential rain,

41:29.260 --> 41:31.760
or can go like a speedy, very speedy

41:33.510 --> 41:36.051
tempest and destroy things.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.051
So He works out all these things

41:38.302 --> 41:40.385
through His electromagnetic forces.

41:40.635 --> 41:45.510
So all the matter, all the matter

41:46.719 --> 41:48.051
is under His control.

41:48.302 --> 41:50.510
All the matter is under His control,

41:50.801 --> 41:54.177
and He’s the one who creates rain for you,

41:54.427 --> 41:56.093
who creates sun for you,

41:56.385 --> 41:58.135
He creates breeze for you.

41:58.385 --> 42:00.801
He’s the one who does all these things

42:01.093 --> 42:03.801
just to have a proper puja,

42:04.051 --> 42:05.843
to have a proper meeting,

42:06.260 --> 42:08.759
everything He works out so beautifully.

42:08.968 --> 42:11.968
And nobody even knows that it is Shri Hanumana

42:12.135 --> 42:12.843
who has done it,

42:13.051 --> 42:16.719
and we should thank Shri Hanumana all the time.

42:17.343 --> 42:19.218
For the today’s thing, I mean, there are

42:19.552 --> 42:22.760
– I, if I have to talk about Him I’ll take hours together.

42:23.218 --> 42:27.635
But only thing I have to say that it’s a,

42:27.843 --> 42:31.968
such a blessing, I feel, that we have this in this palace,

42:32.343 --> 42:34.635
Shri Hanumana’s Puja.

42:34.760 --> 42:45.677
Because He was always a very majestic deity or a angel,

42:46.093 --> 42:51.051
and that in a place where it is so majestic

42:51.343 --> 42:53.677
and beautifully done, everything is there,

42:54.051 --> 42:55.635
and He would like that.

42:55.843 --> 43:00.051
He is not a sanyasi type of a person,

43:00.218 --> 43:01.177
He’s not an ascetic.

43:01.385 --> 43:03.594
Normally right-sided people are ascetic,

43:03.759 --> 43:07.635
they become..., they’ll make right-sided people,

43:07.926 --> 43:10.759
they’ll only have everything simple.

43:11.135 --> 43:13.469
They would like to shave off their nose also if possible,

43:13.760 --> 43:15.677
on the faces!

43:16.843 --> 43:20.343
So you see, the other way round, Hanumana is not doing.

43:20.635 --> 43:24.885
Hanumana likes beauty, He likes decorativeness,

43:25.343 --> 43:29.010
and He makes people non-ascetic,

43:29.302 --> 43:33.093
so Hanumana gives you this kind of a thing.

43:33.427 --> 43:36.010
But many people who are worshippers of Hanumana

43:36.343 --> 43:39.760
always say that those ladies should never go

43:39.968 --> 43:42.343
and take the darshan of Hanuman,

43:42.759 --> 43:45.093
because Hanumana is a brahmachari

43:45.635 --> 43:49.677
– is the one who is, who doesn’t want women to see him

43:50.177 --> 43:52.427
because he doesn’t wear full clothes

43:52.760 --> 43:55.343
– and He has very little clothes on Himself,

43:55.677 --> 43:57.427
so He doesn’t want women to see Him.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.302
But if women think He is just a child,

44:00.469 --> 44:01.760
then it’s just the same.

44:02.093 --> 44:05.552
But this idea I think the people don’t have,

44:05.759 --> 44:06.760
that He’s a child.

44:07.177 --> 44:09.343
What is for a child how many clothes he wear

44:09.552 --> 44:10.218
or doesn’t wear?

44:10.343 --> 44:11.343
And then He’s a monkey,

44:11.552 --> 44:13.010
and the monkeys are not supposed to wear clothes.

44:13.302 --> 44:15.302
So whatever He wears is quite a lot,

44:15.469 --> 44:18.010
and it doesn’t give you even the feeling at all that

44:18.218 --> 44:20.218
He’s in any way nude or anything,

44:20.427 --> 44:22.885
but you just see such a sweet form of Him,

44:23.177 --> 44:24.469
such a sweet form.

44:25.635 --> 44:28.385
I wish sometimes you’d get His photograph also,

44:28.759 --> 44:33.552
as you have got the photographs of Shri Ganesha.

44:33.801 --> 44:35.843
Then you’ll really fall in love with Him,

44:36.135 --> 44:36.926
He’s such a sweet thing.

44:37.177 --> 44:39.719
And though He is so huge and so big

44:40.135 --> 44:42.926
and though He has nails,

44:43.177 --> 44:46.635
but when He caresses My feet He pulls back His nails.

44:46.843 --> 44:50.051
He is so gentle, extremely gentle,

44:50.302 --> 44:53.260
and very beautifully He caresses My feet.

44:53.510 --> 44:56.635
And I have seen Him the way He handles everything,

44:56.843 --> 44:58.843
it’s extremely gentle ways.

44:59.135 --> 45:00.302
So that’s what I feel,

45:00.594 --> 45:02.510
that now Germans are becoming very gentle

45:02.719 --> 45:05.719
in handling things, in handling people.

45:05.968 --> 45:08.302
This change is coming, and I think

45:08.510 --> 45:10.759
is the blessing of Hanumana on them.

45:11.051 --> 45:14.135
So may God bless you.

45:19.218 --> 45:24.760
Now, so today we need not do Ganesh Puja,

45:25.093 --> 45:30.010
though a … once you can wash My feet with some song;

45:30.385 --> 45:32.135
because always before every puja

45:32.385 --> 45:36.719
one has to do Ganesha Puja, but need not be that elaborate.

46:11.635 --> 46:13.635
Just – where is Barbara?

46:13.801 --> 46:15.759
Ask her to get some hot water bottle,

46:15.926 --> 46:17.926
because Ganesha is cooling Me,

46:18.135 --> 46:21.177
the – and Hanumana is cooling Me down completely.

46:23.135 --> 46:24.135
It’s Hanumana, you see,

46:24.302 --> 46:26.510
is cooling Me down completely here from the back,

46:26.843 --> 46:29.926
and just now see how cool it’s becoming, the whole place,

46:30.385 --> 46:32.759
talking about Him.

02:03:41.218 --> 02:03:45.635
This is the present from Russia

02:03:46.093 --> 02:03:49.968
and here, see now, the color of Hanumana

02:03:50.218 --> 02:03:52.093
is exactly like My sari.

02:03:52.968 --> 02:03:55.968
And this is Hanumana, the Gabriel, just imagine:

02:03:56.218 --> 02:03:58.885
this is a Russian folk story,

02:03:59.177 --> 02:04:04.552
so Russians knew that He used to wear clothes of this color

02:04:04.843 --> 02:04:06.218
– just imagine.

02:04:06.635 --> 02:04:11.010
And He’s sitting on a horse,

02:04:11.677 --> 02:04:15.968
and also it is said that it is Gabriel

02:04:16.177 --> 02:04:22.427
who told Mohammed Sahib about the seven...

02:04:26.635 --> 02:04:30.427
He gave a horse to Mohammed Sahib

02:04:30.635 --> 02:04:36.051
to see to seven Heavens, you see, He gave.

02:04:37.010 --> 02:04:40.719
Yes, to see God Almighty on His greatness,

02:04:41.010 --> 02:04:42.343
that is the seven chakras,

02:04:42.677 --> 02:04:44.427
so Hanumana gave Him.

02:04:45.343 --> 02:04:46.885
It’s correct.

02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:49.594
Because Mohammed Sahib was on the left-hand side,

02:04:49.801 --> 02:04:53.760
He had a Chandra Ma; so He gave Him.

02:04:54.885 --> 02:04:57.260
So this is a beautiful piece.

02:04:57.968 --> 02:05:00.343
You should keep it there...

02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:05.218
But it’s made in Germany, made in Germany.
