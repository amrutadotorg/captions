1
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:06,415
Today was a very great day for all of you

2
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,639
to jump in the river and enjoy yourselves very much.

3
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:13,716
 I remember the past

4
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:17,260
of such days which I have also enjoyed before.

5
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:19,446
But one must know that

6
00:01:19,614 --> 00:01:23,335
 it’s not the outside that really gives you pleasure; it’s the inside.

7
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:26,334
Whether there is outside or not,

8
00:01:26,446 --> 00:01:29,374
 inside should be so elated.

9
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:33,886
You can use this as a memory  for yourself,

10
00:01:34,315 --> 00:01:36,544
 whenever you feel dejected or depressed,

11
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:39,712
and should try to maintain that

12
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:42,631
moment of joy and happiness within yourself.

13
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:46,163
 I hope you were in the present at that time,

14
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:48,953
so that it is completely recorded in your memory

15
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,256
and that you will enjoy all that.

16
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:53,985
The sign of a good Sahaja yogi is that

17
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,001
he has no complaints.

18
00:01:57,128 --> 00:02:00,678
 He doesn’t give ideas, suggestions,

19
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:03,845
 and object to what Mother says

20
00:02:04,345 --> 00:02:06,956
 and give new dimensions to it,

21
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:12,185
 doesn’t argue and thirdly, he’s always enjoying.

22
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:16,842
If you are not enjoying still your eyes are moving on one side,

23
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:20,090
 brain on another side, your ears in the third direction

24
00:02:20,313 --> 00:02:23,743
 then you are not integrated. You are not yet a proper Sahaja yogi.

25
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:28,836
 So you have to be a very proper, sensible Sahaja yogi.

26
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:32,088
 In your ascent you will discover all these things.

27
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:35,858
So try to be more in the center, in the present,

28
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:42,837
 and then only this will become

29
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,726
 a prominent feature within your heart.

30
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:49,845
And on that will be seated your Spirit shining all the time.

31
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:54,928
But the seat of the Spirit is  all the time wobbly

32
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:56,900
 and is not there;

33
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:59,940
 so Spirit does not know how to emit light in your life.

34
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:02,516
Now what I find is that our attention

35
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:05,079
 goes to all kinds of various activities,

36
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,627
which we should see like the sea that was flowing.

37
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:10,709
The re was lots of stones there.

38
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,166
And one can learn a lesson from that,  that when the stones

39
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,329
 are there it makes a ripple, a sound, a reflection back,

40
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,985
 and the water is obstructed.

41
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:25,358
 In the same way, if we have stones in our head,

42
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:32,117
that the flow of Kundalini get obstructed

43
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:35,399
 and then we get all kinds of, you see, reflections

44
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:37,886
and we reflect back and then we try

45
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:40,735
to give some suggestions or things, all that.

46
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:43,359
 We don’t allow the flow to go

47
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:46,345
 straight forward in a very smooth manner.

48
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:50,976
 So also it is very interesting and it makes a,

49
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:54,767
 you feel more interested because it helps the ego

50
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:57,285
to grow more.

51
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:02,043
But one has to learn that  that’s not the temperament of a Sahaja yogi.

52
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:05,674
Sahaja yogi is a subtle personality,

53
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:07,917
 absolutely peaceful within himself.

54
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:10,068
 He has no complaints about anything.

55
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:12,691
 He is always enjoying. He doesn’t say anything.

56
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,646
He doesn’t cry. He doesn’t weep.

57
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:17,666
 He doesn’t say, “This is wrong. That is wrong.”

58
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:21,533
He doesn’t talk about his family,

59
00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:24,879
 his children, his relations. He doesn’t.

60
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:28,349
 And if he has to talk about somebody,  he talks always the good,

61
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:31,951
 not the bad. Except for the leaders; when I ask them,

62
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,437
they have to tell Me the truth,

63
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:36,826
 if I ask or if I know something or if I have to verify.

64
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:40,006
But you shouldn’t get so much involved in your family, my mother,

65
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:41,697
 sister, wife, husband, this, that.

66
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:43,694
 Now it’s time for you to come up.

67
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,385
 Those who will come up and come over it will be a good idea.

68
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,909
 Secondly, as I’ve told you,

69
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,583
that the joy of the West is finished because

70
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:57,241
 the men have lost power as men,

71
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:59,432
 and women have lost their power as woman.

72
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:05,169
 It’s like the eyes going into the place of the nose

73
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:07,178
and the nose in the place of eyes.

74
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:10,788
So that’s why this misplacement has taken place.

75
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:16,409
So try to enjoy that role that you have, you have taken up

76
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,352
 and don’t to perform the role of others.

77
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:23,735
 This is a very simple thing which one should accept

78
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:27,122
 and one should work it out. And I’m sure

79
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:31,450
we will all come to balances and we will be in the center.

80
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:38,506
Now the problem is very simple

81
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:46,561
that  we have to accept the present, the present moment.

82
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:50,948
It’s very simple. At this present moment

83
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:56,328
you are sitting here in front of Me for a Puja.

84
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,507
 At every present moment is to be enjoyed.

85
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:03,413
Every present moment is to be enjoyed.

86
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:05,950
Not to get worried about the future.

87
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:08,489
Not to be upset about the past.

88
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:12,619
The compassion of God is tremendous; tremendous.

89
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,674
 Allow Him to work it out.

90
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:19,221
 When you try to play your role then the compassion,  as I told you,

91
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:21,324
 acts on the stones

92
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,120
and the stones give all this ripples and the sounds and all this

93
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:32,762
jumbling. So best way to allow your mind t

94
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:37,742
o be all right, is to be peaceful, alert alert, not sleepy.

95
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,581
Only when you sleep, then you don’t have the stones there.

96
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:49,048
 So when you’re alert, watching and enjoying every moment.

97
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:51,960
This is the message for today,

98
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:55,333
because really the time is beautiful

99
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,107
and I think it’s better that you be in thoughtless awareness and enjoy.

100
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,760
