1
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:10,867
All kinds of tricks he [Krishna] used to play. 
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

2
00:00:10,947 --> 00:00:14,387
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

3
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:17,587
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

4
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:21,827
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

5
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:25,467
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

6
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:29,827
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

7
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:34,187
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

8
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,507
meaning the power of creation,

9
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:39,827
because creation has been done already.

10
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,987
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

11
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:45,027
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

12
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:47,187
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

13
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:50,627
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

14
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:53,867
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

15
00:00:53,947 --> 00:00:57,227
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

16
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,187
and she opens her left side.

17
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,267
And in front of her

18
00:01:01,347 --> 00:01:05,507
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

19
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:08,347
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

20
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:10,827
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

21
00:01:10,907 --> 00:01:15,267
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

22
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:18,427
But in this one, the one that they have here

23
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:20,587
is the child is kept underneath this,

24
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:24,067
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

25
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:28,267
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

26
00:01:28,347 --> 00:01:31,267
So I'll tell you the last story about her

27
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:37,947
which will conclude this talk about

28
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:39,907
Radha and Shri Krishna.

29
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:43,147
That one day,

30
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:49,027
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

31
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:50,987
and Narada said, "See,

32
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:53,667
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

33
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:56,147
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

34
00:01:56,227 --> 00:02:01,027
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

35
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:05,947
So, the rumour, you see, went into the women.

36
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:09,867
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

37
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:13,107
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

38
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:18,107
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

39
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:21,268
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

40
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:22,987
"Narada is just telling you lies,

41
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:26,907
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

42
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:28,867
so don't listen to him."

43
00:02:28,947 --> 00:02:31,227
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

44
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:32,987
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

45
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:35,272
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

46
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:38,707
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

47
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:42,507
They said, "What's the matter? what sort of a pain it is,

48
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:45,667
what can we do to overcome this pain?"

49
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:47,627
He said, "There's very simple thing that

50
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:52,587
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

51
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:56,347
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

52
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,107
then I'll be saved."

53
00:02:58,187 --> 00:03:01,747
So, these ladies used their brains. They said that

54
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:03,507
"Already he doesn't love us

55
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,707
and then if we give him the dust of our feet,

56
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:09,667
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

57
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:12,747
So, what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

58
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:14,387
it's better to forget about it."

59
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:17,346
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

60
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:20,507
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

61
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:23,707
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

62
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,947
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

63
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:29,467
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

64
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:31,947
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

65
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:34,507
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

66
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:37,347
and this is the medicine." So, he went to Radhaji

67
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:40,587
and he said to her that,

68
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:43,867
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

69
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:49,427
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

70
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:52,227
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

71
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:55,747
for that pain, of course, why not?"

72
00:03:55,827 --> 00:04:01,627
So, he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

73
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,827
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

74
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:06,147
He said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

75
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:08,147
he has no sense of sin at all.

76
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:10,427
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

77
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:11,947
what am I to worry about sins.

78
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:15,307
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

79
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:16,707
this is his worry."

80
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:19,427
So, he took the dust of Radha's feet

81
00:04:19,507 --> 00:04:21,987
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

82
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:24,987
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

83
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,387
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

84
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,907
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

85
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:33,947
He said, "That I know." So, he said, "But how do you explain it?"

86
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:35,947
He said, "You'll understand just now."

87
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:38,467
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

88
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:43,667
you see Radha's feet were dusted

89
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:45,867
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

90
00:04:45,947 --> 00:04:52,307
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

91
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:54,987
you see, the soil is yellowish

92
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:59,347
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

93
00:04:59,427 --> 00:05:01,827
which she removed and took it.

94
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:07,347
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

95
00:05:07,427 --> 00:05:11,107
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

96
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:16,107
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

97
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:18,347
on the lotus of his heart.

98
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:24,827
The lotus had the pollen,

99
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,067
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

100
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:29,067
and was making it yellow.

101
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:32,667
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

102
00:05:32,747 --> 00:05:38,747
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

103
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:45,547
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

104
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:48,747
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

105
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:52,307
They have to be Radha to understand him.

106
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:54,787
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

107
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:57,747
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

108
00:05:57,827 --> 00:06:03,587
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

109
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:07,067
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

110
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:10,427
So, he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

111
00:06:10,507 --> 00:06:13,227
give him the the power and everybody danced.

112
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:17,067
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

113
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:20,707
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

114
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:24,987
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

115
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:27,067
For a minute you abandon everything."

116
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:30,147
And that abandonment has now become a,

117
00:06:30,227 --> 00:06:32,227
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

118
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:36,267
here it has become a year-long Holi.

119
00:06:36,347 --> 00:06:38,307
So, people are busy with a year-long Holi

120
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:40,227
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

121
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:43,667
So, what will be the situation of such a place?

122
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:46,467
And that's why I think, what happens that

123
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:50,587
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

124
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:53,827
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

125
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:57,027
And once they get into you, you get funny,

126
00:06:57,107 --> 00:07:01,387
you don't know why you behave like this,
why things work out that way.

127
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:03,467
This is why we have to understand

128
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:06,347
that we have to be attractive to God.

129
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:10,947
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

130
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:15,147
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

131
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,907
So May God Bless You.
