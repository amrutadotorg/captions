03:25:44.970 --> 03:25:51.090
This was a song composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore

03:25:52.350 --> 03:25:56.050
so many years back, when he had a vision

03:25:56.630 --> 03:25:59.410
of our Ganapatipule seminars.

03:25:59.910 --> 03:26:04.250
where he describes that people from all the world will come,

03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:06.730
from different countries will come.

03:26:08.530 --> 03:26:15.270
Also, the Hindus, the Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and all kinds of communities

03:26:16.270 --> 03:26:22.610
will get their awakening on the bank of the sea.

03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:25.530
‘Sagar’, sagar is the sea.

03:26:27.410 --> 03:26:31.410
So beautifully every detail he has described.

03:26:32.010 --> 03:26:34.930
He was a seer and he could see the future

03:26:35.490 --> 03:26:40.590
where many people, who are seekers, to become ‘mahamanav’ they come.

03:26:41.450 --> 03:26:45.550
And it’s very surprising how these seers

03:26:45.570 --> 03:26:47.490
have seen the future.

03:26:47.650 --> 03:26:50.310
Like, as you know, C. S. Lewis is there

03:26:50.410 --> 03:26:53.630
and also, we have got William Blake, so many others.

03:26:55.190 --> 03:26:59.050
And I feel today, in Bengal, when I have come here in Calcutta,

03:26:59.650 --> 03:27:01.950
that his dreams are fulfilled.

03:27:02.450 --> 03:27:05.690
His Spirit would be so happy to know-

03:27:12.630 --> 03:27:17.490
So, as you know that we get all kinds of people, all races,

03:27:17.950 --> 03:27:20.950
all religions together in Ganapatipule

03:27:20.965 --> 03:27:24.065
and where you all enjoy the bliss of

03:27:25.550 --> 03:27:30.230
God, where you feel that there’s an awakening.

03:27:30.230 --> 03:27:32.065
Also, He says that

03:27:32.070 --> 03:27:35.850
the great Mother has now risen, and She is awakened

03:27:35.850 --> 03:27:38.025
and She is going to awaken you.

03:27:38.030 --> 03:27:41.170
So, clearly, he has seen the whole thing.

03:27:41.170 --> 03:27:45.530
It’s remarkable how these seers can see things and reveal,

03:27:46.090 --> 03:27:47.710
to our amazement.

03:27:49.290 --> 03:27:54.110
I am very happy that we have such nice company

03:27:54.110 --> 03:27:58.870
of Baba Zaheer and his other brothers,

03:27:59.110 --> 03:28:03.310
who are qawwals and his sons also, who are qawwals.

03:28:04.250 --> 03:28:07.590
So, this is such a great thing to understand

03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:13.390
that these people have felt the same awakening within them as you have,

03:28:14.990 --> 03:28:16.290
and that

03:28:16.885 --> 03:28:19.795
they have really become Sahaja Yogis now

03:28:19.795 --> 03:28:21.590
and they sing from their heart.

03:28:21.670 --> 03:28:26.045
Some of these poems, I think, they made later on, after going from Bombay.

03:28:26.045 --> 03:28:29.085
Because I see that they are all new songs.

03:28:29.550 --> 03:28:33.190
And, they are singing what you would like to say.

03:28:33.790 --> 03:28:37.330
they are singing what you would like to express.

03:28:37.835 --> 03:28:41.025
And that’s why you feel so joyous and happy

03:28:41.025 --> 03:28:44.375
that, "you are saying what we wanted to say all these days".

03:28:45.750 --> 03:28:49.750
It’s remarkable how in the collectivity the thought

03:28:52.790 --> 03:28:56.790
Tongue works in a very different manner

03:28:57.310 --> 03:29:01.045
that we all want to say the same thing.

03:29:01.050 --> 03:29:03.150
For everyone, that is the truth.

03:29:03.270 --> 03:29:05.630
And you all feel so joyous about it

03:29:05.630 --> 03:29:07.630
and so happy about it.

03:29:07.970 --> 03:29:14.090
It is something, a kind of a rapport between one Realized soul and another Realized soul.

03:29:14.610 --> 03:29:18.950
Only a Realized soul can understand the bliss

03:29:19.470 --> 03:29:22.010
and the joy of this expression.

03:29:22.630 --> 03:29:25.990
Of course, so many things have been said about Me,

03:29:26.450 --> 03:29:30.110
that’s quite embarrassing. I don’t know what I do.

03:29:30.850 --> 03:29:34.130
I, really, I don’t think I do anything. It's all working out.

03:29:34.230 --> 03:29:38.310
It's all grace of the, this All-pervading Power

03:29:38.310 --> 03:29:41.130
which is working out everything so well.

03:29:41.430 --> 03:29:43.690
Today is the concluding day for us

03:29:45.490 --> 03:29:51.070
and to have such a nice program of qawwali here was really remarkable.

03:29:51.590 --> 03:29:54.630
I am sorry that half of the people have left

03:29:54.630 --> 03:29:57.030
because they didn’t know there was a program.

03:29:57.550 --> 03:30:01.610
Today we had to make some arrangements, in that it was lost.

03:30:02.190 --> 03:30:03.350
Doesn't matter.

03:30:03.350 --> 03:30:07.190
Those who are lucky have listened to them and have enjoyed them thoroughly.

03:30:15.190 --> 03:30:18.230
I bless those qawwals from my heart,

03:30:18.810 --> 03:30:23.010
and I always think there will be more people

03:30:23.390 --> 03:30:26.470
who will appreciate their music and understand

03:30:26.790 --> 03:30:30.030
and so many Muslims-

03:30:30.030 --> 03:30:32.550
as yesterday, Ilal said, "Mother, when will the Muslims know about You?"

03:30:32.850 --> 03:30:36.550
So, these are the people who can spread the news all over

03:30:36.550 --> 03:30:40.030
and can tell that now the time has come of ‘Qiyama’

03:30:40.390 --> 03:30:43.430
where you will have to get your Self-realization.

03:30:43.430 --> 03:30:46.710
They're very important, I'm so concerned about the Muslims now

03:30:47.130 --> 03:30:51.590
Because they are in quite darkness, and the way they are killing people

03:30:52.470 --> 03:30:55.915
because they are Muslims and they are killed in so many places

03:30:55.915 --> 03:30:57.770
while they also kill.

03:30:57.770 --> 03:31:00.810
It's a very violent, nonsensical thing,

03:31:00.810 --> 03:31:03.110
which was never preached by Mohammed Sahib.

03:31:03.710 --> 03:31:07.050
He was the one who was for love and love and love.

03:31:07.730 --> 03:31:12.410
He is the one who had to fight because they were so aggressive on Him.

03:31:12.410 --> 03:31:13.910
But otherwise,

03:31:13.950 --> 03:31:16.490
if you read Koran, you'll be surprised

03:31:16.490 --> 03:31:19.290
how much He has praised the love of God.

03:31:19.930 --> 03:31:23.030
And that’s what is so misleading these days

03:31:23.210 --> 03:31:24.750
that we don’t understand.

03:31:25.030 --> 03:31:29.670
I am happy at least the Sahaja Yogis understand Koran and understand Mohammed Sahib

03:31:30.050 --> 03:31:35.510
and are in devotion to Mohammed Sahib as they are to any other Guru.

03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:39.110
It’s very creditable for you people to accept.

03:31:40.030 --> 03:31:45.490
Because you have seen on your vibrations that Mohammed Sahib was an Incarnation

03:31:45.890 --> 03:31:47.510
of a Master

03:31:47.730 --> 03:31:49.590
so you cannot deny it.

03:31:49.730 --> 03:31:54.725
And these conditionings have gone into complete negligence now,

03:31:54.725 --> 03:31:57.565
and most of the Sahaja Yogis have such a respect

03:31:57.570 --> 03:32:00.090
for Mohammed Sahib and for Koran.

03:32:01.670 --> 03:32:04.410
I wish all the luck to these people

03:32:04.510 --> 03:32:06.905
that they propagate this idea

03:32:06.910 --> 03:32:11.210
and try to bring peace on this earth

03:32:11.790 --> 03:32:16.290
by telling people that what Mohammed Sahib has said and what are we doing.

03:32:16.830 --> 03:32:18.630
In the same way, for all of us,

03:32:18.630 --> 03:32:21.070
to whatever religion we may belong,

03:32:21.075 --> 03:32:23.475
we have so many conditionings and wrong ideas.

03:32:23.475 --> 03:32:25.535
So, we should try to correct them

03:32:26.130 --> 03:32:28.490
and see for ourselves that

03:32:28.670 --> 03:32:32.090
all of them came to spread spirituality.

03:32:32.290 --> 03:32:35.890
As I always said, they were like flowers on a tree

03:32:35.890 --> 03:32:38.650
same tree of spirituality they came.

03:32:39.190 --> 03:32:42.610
And whatever they had to do at that time, ‘samayachar’, they did it.

03:32:43.130 --> 03:32:45.585
But we have plucked the flowers

03:32:45.585 --> 03:32:47.935
and now fighting with the dead flowers.

03:32:49.275 --> 03:32:52.405
So, as Sahaja Yogis, when you are awakened in knowledge,

03:32:52.410 --> 03:32:54.770
and you know what knowledge is,

03:32:54.910 --> 03:33:01.870
then you have to really understand that we are all on the same path of spirituality.

03:33:03.250 --> 03:33:05.190
There’s no difference at all.

03:33:05.510 --> 03:33:09.370
May God bless you all for enjoying this qawwali

03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:12.650
and for coming all the way to Calcutta.

03:33:15.670 --> 03:33:19.890
It has been really a tremendous task, I must say.

03:33:20.230 --> 03:33:28.490
All my thanks are to these great organizers

03:33:28.490 --> 03:33:32.850
who have organized such a big thing in this place.

03:33:32.990 --> 03:33:36.870
And we had, yesterday, the whole thing filled up, you see.

03:33:37.290 --> 03:33:41.910
And the way it was conducted and worked out was so remarkable.

03:33:42.570 --> 03:33:45.210
All the leaders who came here

03:33:45.210 --> 03:33:48.470
were amazed at their organizing capacity.

03:33:48.775 --> 03:33:51.925
And they told Me, “Mother, we have to learn a lot from them.

03:33:52.050 --> 03:33:54.530
We can, of course, not surpass them.

03:33:54.850 --> 03:33:58.990
But whatever they have done is such an eye-opener

03:33:58.990 --> 03:34:02.070
that we have to now dedicate ourselves fully

03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:06.670
to proper understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

03:34:07.010 --> 03:34:11.810
its spreading and all the organizing should be our first priority.

03:34:12.330 --> 03:34:15.585
Unless and until people take interest in that,

03:34:15.585 --> 03:34:18.815
we cannot achieve what these people have achieved.”

03:34:19.115 --> 03:34:21.705
The collectivity of the

03:34:22.830 --> 03:34:27.810
Bengali people and Marwaris and all types of people

03:34:28.270 --> 03:34:29.750
who are here,

03:34:30.810 --> 03:34:35.610
from every part of our country, is so remarkable.

03:34:36.310 --> 03:34:40.430
There’s no quarrelling, no discussion, no argument,

03:34:40.430 --> 03:34:42.650
it's done so beautifully.

03:34:42.650 --> 03:34:45.850
Unbelievable how they have worked it out!

03:34:46.590 --> 03:34:49.625
So, we have to remember that we are one

03:34:49.625 --> 03:34:52.285
part and parcel of one being.

03:34:52.290 --> 03:34:55.630
And once we really realize that,

03:34:55.630 --> 03:34:58.730
we’ll enjoy each other’s company very much.

03:34:59.370 --> 03:35:02.830
All Sahaja Yogis enjoy each other's company.

03:35:03.150 --> 03:35:07.510
And also, all of you from the whole world, who have come here

03:35:08.030 --> 03:35:11.610
have seen how marvelously they have organized everything.

03:35:12.650 --> 03:35:16.730
I am thankful to you for coming here to celebrate My birthday

03:35:17.770 --> 03:35:18.790
And

03:35:19.130 --> 03:35:22.170
I don't know what to say now,

03:35:22.550 --> 03:35:29.270
because every birthday you discover such nice things and such nice people.

03:35:30.510 --> 03:35:35.610
This birthday was really remarkable for its all organization

03:35:36.270 --> 03:35:39.630
and the way it was worked out so smoothly.

03:35:39.630 --> 03:35:42.370
I wish we all learn from this.

03:35:43.170 --> 03:35:49.250
We are all thankful to the organization of Calcutta,

03:35:49.610 --> 03:35:52.950
for organizing this so well. Give them a hand.

03:36:14.185 --> 03:36:18.565
I know it's so overwhelming that we cannot even stop clapping.

03:36:19.855 --> 03:36:26.495
Also, we have to again and again thank these qawwals,

03:36:27.932 --> 03:36:30.882
who have come here all the way from
Hydrawad

03:36:31.322 --> 03:36:34.502
and have giving expressions to your feelings,

03:36:35.082 --> 03:36:37.582
also give them a hand.

03:36:48.018 --> 03:36:50.738
They are really religious people

03:36:50.878 --> 03:36:53.948
and that's how they got to Sahaja Yoga so easily

03:36:53.977 --> 03:36:57.097
And now the way they feel confident about life,

03:36:57.702 --> 03:37:00.362
as you people all feel confident.

03:37:00.527 --> 03:37:03.787
In the kingdom of God, there's nothing to worry

03:37:03.927 --> 03:37:09.147
nothing to bother about future or past, but to enjoy the present.

03:37:09.257 --> 03:37:12.237
And that's what they are doing and you were doing too.

03:37:12.237 --> 03:37:16.717
I enjoyed, I enjoyed the rapport that existed between you.

03:37:17.137 --> 03:37:20.072
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
