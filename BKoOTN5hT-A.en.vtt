00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.520
Now, what we can do is to, Philip,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.640
what should I tell you the practical side,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.000
the meditation. All right?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.222
Let's see what this meditation is, what We have to do on a meditation.

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:32.560
The first thing we have got is the left side

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.640
is the Mana-Shakti, is the power of your emotions. All right?

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.880
Now, emotions are connected with your right side, also -- prana.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.480
Say for example if you are emotionally disturbed,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.080
just now we got disturbed,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.160
so our shva, our breathing also increased

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.480
and we felt the whole body was sort of, say reacting

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.000
and the, we were feeling the reaction of the Prana, right side also.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.120
That it was trying to express itself.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.160
Like we started the tears, is the water-element

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.160
and all that came in and the whole emotion was so much pouring out

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.200
and with that our Prana was also involved.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.680
Say for example if you are frightened,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.880
if you are frightened

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.880
if you are frightened too much then what happens?

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.840
If you are frightened than also you get your breathing

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.040
very fast -- isn't it?

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
So it is connected.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.830
So it is connected. If you are frightened it is connected

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:54.720
with your Prana, in your breathing

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:04.260
and your whole system is connected with your emotions, physical system.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.800
If you cry too much, or if you weep too much, or if you are a sad person

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.920
that shows on your face, your Vishuddhi-Chakra also shows,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.480
and not only Anahata but also Vishuddhi.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.400
Then also your Agnya goes out.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.840
So all the Chakras reflect the left side

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.880
in such a way that physical manifestation is also there.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.160
So it proofs that both are very much connected.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.920
So to, if you have to, somehow or other,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.960
dissolve these two sides within us,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.280
the left and the right side

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.520
because if you do not dissolve it,  you are left half way here

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.600
so you have to dissolve these two things.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.560
And to dissolve these, what should we do?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.860
What can we do -- in meditation?

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.500
Can you suggest?

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.500
 Say we have got Prana and Mana.

00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:12.452
Now Prana represents the right side and the Mana-Shakti is the left side.

00:03:12.646 --> 00:03:17.712
All right? These two have to be dissolved -- in the air, means dissolved.

00:03:17.847 --> 00:03:21.360
Now how do we do it? To dissolve these two things,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.451
they are connected with each other.

00:03:26.368 --> 00:03:30.728
After realization, not before.

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:45.549
So before meditation we give ourselves a balance, all right?

00:03:45.628 --> 00:03:48.801
This side is more, this side is less. At the time.

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.493
Supposing you are emotionally -- at that time -- disturbed,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.072
then you put your right to the left.

00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:57.342
If you are that time disturbed on the left side

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:03.913
I mean disturbed in that sense that if a left side is frozen,

00:04:04.064 --> 00:04:09.021
then you raise your left side and give yourself a balance before meditation.

00:04:09.234 --> 00:04:12.830
Now let us see, which side is less, first of all.

00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:17.200
Put your hands like that.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.000
Are you all right? Getting cool breeze? Getting it?

00:04:22.100 --> 00:05:06.780
(Shri Mataji speaks to a little girl)

00:05:12.006 --> 00:05:16.286
So once you have given yourself a balance

00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:24.388
then the best thing is to pay attention to your emotions,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.150
to Manas-Shakti. Watch them.

00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:35.182
You can enlighten your emotions by thinking of your Mother. All right.

00:05:35.282 --> 00:05:37.417
Just enlighten them.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.685
Just She will solve the problem. Whatever are the problems in the Mana, all right?

00:05:43.828 --> 00:05:50.400
So once you get connected with those emotions

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:59.035
and you start looking at them in your meditation

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.769
you will see these emotions are rising within you

00:06:06.504 --> 00:06:12.104
and if you try to put these emotions on your Mother,

00:06:12.186 --> 00:06:15.586
as they say at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother,

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:20.666
they will start also dissolving those emotions

00:06:20.793 --> 00:06:29.240
and they'll become sort of -- ah -- expanded. Expanded, you see.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.920
You will extern that in such a way that

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.360
you will feel you are in control, these emotions.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.280
You are in control of them and by that controlling those emotions

00:06:40.896 --> 00:06:45.896
your emotions -- which are expanded, enlightened -- are powerful.

00:06:46.413 --> 00:06:52.705
And these emotions, when you feel that way,

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:58.639
then the cause of those emotions can be solved.

00:06:58.908 --> 00:07:02.577
For example just now you got emotionally stirred up

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:06.920
because I talked about -- say -- these children.

00:07:07.313 --> 00:07:09.964
Naturally, anybody would be.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.160
Now when you are stirred up with that you put that problem

00:07:15.272 --> 00:07:18.135
and those feelings that are rising in you,

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:23.116
that those waves of feelings that are coming at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother.

00:07:23.648 --> 00:07:29.200
So they get touched, say by that power you can say.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.340
Then these emotions become enlightened

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.560
and when these emotions become enlightened

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:42.400
they have a power to solve the problem. Do you see the point?

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.512
As if they had reached the shore where they got the light

00:07:45.584 --> 00:07:48.824
and this problem can be solved.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.637
Because now you are not in an individual cell,

00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:55.724
you are in the expanse, you are in the samashti

00:07:55.772 --> 00:07:58.343
and because you have entered into that position,

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.257
that's why you have got these powers of entering to another person's body,

00:08:02.312 --> 00:08:04.852
to see the vibrations of another person,

00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:09.352
to raise the Kundalini. Otherwise you could not have done it.

00:08:10.074 --> 00:08:14.800
So for you it is very easy because I am also sitting here in person.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.360
So easy to put these emotions just there

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.080
so that they get enlightened and your wish is fulfilled,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:30.785
because emotions are nothing but wishes. These are unfulfilled wishes.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:38.540
Now how they do it? Otherwise is also this way that you take up these emotions

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:49.600
and put them, so that is, these emotions are actually -- the left side,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.680
as I said, is the desire.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:09:00.767
So the desire is taken, any desire, and is put in the Prana.

00:09:00.856 --> 00:09:04.076
Now how do you put it on the Prana?

00:09:04.219 --> 00:09:09.260
That you control your Prana -- that's why they do Prana-yamas, you see?

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.880
Like you sit down now, very comfortably,

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.000
now you have a desire, you put your attention to that.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.440
Attention is very important -- you see?

00:09:18.548 --> 00:09:27.508
Now this attention is to be put onto the Prana,

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.880
so the emotions are there

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.145
and then bring those emotions and put them into your attention,

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:42.520
means they are now, you are aware of them.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.760
Now what you do is to watch your breathing. See now,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:56.851
try to reduce your breathing, reduce it.

00:09:59.094 --> 00:10:08.220
In the sense that you have breathed out, wait for a while, then breath in

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.020
for a long time. Then you breathe out.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.040
So in one minute your breezing will be less than normal.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.528
All right? Try that. Breathe in.

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:28.872
now with the emotions, keep the attention on the emotions -- you see?

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:32.701
so that the connection is established.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:08.741
Hmm. Better? You see the Kundalini rises?

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:16.480
Now when you are breathing you find that there is a space in-between,

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.780
which you just leave it vacant.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.800
Breathe in!

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.040
Now leave it vacant.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.860
Now breathe out.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.900
Now leave it vacant.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.703
Breathe in. Keep it there.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.900
Then leave it.

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:55.543
Keep out-side. Now breathe in.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:09.420
Now start breathing in such a way that you stop your breathing.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:35.820
Your attention should be on the heart, or could be on the emotions.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.020
It's better.

00:12:50.588 --> 00:12:53.908
Keep the breathing inside for a while,

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.720
then bring it out, then outside for a while.

00:12:58.827 --> 00:13:03.643
Then again, then you'll find that for a while you will not breathe.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:20.940
Hmm. You see, you settle down. The Laya takes place between your Prana and your Mana.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.020
Both the Shaktis become one.

00:13:26.429 --> 00:13:34.869
Now at this stage when you are silent, now you think of your intellect.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.140
It's lost.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.480
Now just think of it, it's lost, it's no more there.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:50.040
So what is happening, actually that this Laya -- the attention

00:13:50.198 --> 00:13:55.267
goes into the intellect and enlightens t

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.660
Aha, now see, the thought is not there -- try to find your intellect within yourself!

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:19.260
Now see! See, where is my intellect? Try to find it!

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:28.220
It's not there, it's not working. Again try it!

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.760
It is working, but it has become the samashti,

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.220
has become the collective now.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.923
Ha! See now!

00:14:50.104 --> 00:14:52.784
See now. Did you follow that?

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.260
There is no thought.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.762
This exercise will give you this thoughtless awareness,

00:15:05.809 --> 00:15:09.460
establishes in you the thoughtless awareness. There is no thought.
