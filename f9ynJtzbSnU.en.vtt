00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:07.019
Like fumes.

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:10.919
Fumo.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:14.191
And it is such an absurd place.

00:00:14.192 --> 00:00:17.532
And there is, also very surprising that,

00:00:17.544 --> 00:00:20.832
every 28 minutes, in a place

00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:22.812
water comes out of the Mother Earth,

00:00:22.812 --> 00:00:25.312
every 28 minutes.

00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:28.455
It shoots off, exactly after 28 minutes.

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:31.305
It’s a very funny place and lot of sulphur,

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:32.875
lot of sulphur there.

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:35.965
Sulphur just bubbling out of,

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:39.345
you find suddenly from somewhere
there’s a hot water coming out

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:41.723
like just pouring out water.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:43.883
Can you imagine such a place?

00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:46.103
Now, Andes is another site.

00:00:46.143 --> 00:00:52.976
Andes is a kind that will give tremors, earthquakes.

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:54.646
It will give lots of earthquakes

00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:57.926
and it has lots of gold also because it’s a right-sided,

00:00:57.986 --> 00:01:01.556
lot of gold and it will be giving lots of earthquakes.

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:04.786
When it will come to destruction,

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:07.146
it will be used as earthquakes.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.496
They will, it will act as earthquakes.

00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:11.808
America is that whole portion,

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:14.325
it is all Andes from top to bottom,

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:17.418
and all that will be shattered by earthquakes.

00:01:17.418 --> 00:01:23.120
So, these two forces will act
more at the time of destruction.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.250
So, one has to be careful about it.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.340
Because, you see, Bolivia,
say Peru and all these places,

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.862
these people went from here.

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:36.899
They killed so many of these people.

00:01:36.922 --> 00:01:40.989
So many of these races were killed completely.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.149
Then dead bodies were there.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.909
Killing is very bad, because when you kill a person,

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:53.029
that person cannot take birth and
hangs in the air and becomes a bhoot.

00:01:53.054 --> 00:01:55.029
So, they have overpowered Americans.

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:56.649
That’s why Americans are like that.

00:01:56.661 --> 00:02:01.589
You see, they killed all the people
from New York to the whole of America

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:04.289
was all people who were aboriginal.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.469
So, they have possessed them also.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.469
And in the same way in the South it’s happening.

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:10.009
So, it is all, again,

00:02:10.017 --> 00:02:12.749
though it is right-sided but it’s supraconscious,

00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:15.252
all supraconscious things.

00:02:15.252 --> 00:02:17.349
So, they have to be very careful now.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.019
They have to take to Sahaja Yoga

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.519
and those who will be taking to
Sahaja Yoga will be only saved.

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.019
The rest will be destroyed,

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.739
because Andes will act as a
supraconscious thing for destruction.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.239
And Fujiyama and all that, will have,

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.623
not, they will have those, what you call them?

00:02:34.623 --> 00:02:37.123
Volcanoes.

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:39.223
Mother, I‘m terribly sorry, but

00:02:39.247 --> 00:02:41.747
the tape, we ran out of tape.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.943
Would You just explain again the left side,

00:02:43.943 --> 00:02:45.653
the right side and the Himalayas?

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:47.533
I’m sorry to do this to You.

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:48.133
Of what?

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:51.801
Just as You described just a moment ago,

00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:55.921
how the Himalayas is this and the two columns.

00:02:55.916 --> 00:03:00.980
You see, you think of Himalaya as the central point,

00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:01.620
Kailash

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.475
Yes. Sahasrara.

00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:07.665
Yes, fontanelle bone

00:03:07.665 --> 00:03:12.625
And this is the plate of the Ekadesha.

00:03:12.627 --> 00:03:13.875
All right!

00:03:13.908 --> 00:03:22.578
Now all the, even this Zermatt and this alps
and all that is in the same.

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:24.034
In the same line?

00:03:24.043 --> 00:03:26.103
On the right and left side, both sides.

00:03:26.103 --> 00:03:28.603
(Unclear) Argentina we have all these on that

00:03:28.603 --> 00:03:31.103
so it’s all Ekadesha

00:03:31.103 --> 00:03:35.853
But, on both the sides, we have got Andes

00:03:35.858 --> 00:03:40.051
and this side, we have got Fujiyama and all this.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:50.507
Out of these two, the left-sided one is the Andes.

00:03:50.507 --> 00:03:54.134
I‘ve treated it as Andes as left-sided actually,

00:03:54.153 --> 00:03:58.127
because the sun rises from this side,

00:03:58.153 --> 00:04:00.653
and the right-sided one should be

00:04:00.653 --> 00:04:03.747
the Japanese according to Sahaja Yoga style.

00:04:03.747 --> 00:04:06.247
But in the thing, if you see,

00:04:06.247 --> 00:04:09.876
this is right and this is left.

00:04:09.877 --> 00:04:13.816
Now, what has happened is that

00:04:13.827 --> 00:04:22.008
the right-sided people like Spanish and all that,

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.660
went down there

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.460
and killed so many of these people,

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:29.926
who were all right-sided too.

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:32.435
So the whole thing we should call it as right-sided

00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:34.935
now. The Andes as right-sided.

00:04:34.935 --> 00:04:36.506
Because right-sided people

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:39.006
will be punished by the right-sided defects

00:04:39.006 --> 00:04:42.016
and left will be punished by the left-sided defects.

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:44.506
So, because the right-sided people have gone there

00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:47.486
and have killed the right-sided people,

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:49.076
the right-sided people there

00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:50.976
have overpowered these people.

00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:52.886
That’s why the speed is there,

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:55.386
and the Americans are, you see, like this

00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:59.366
all very violent all these things, because of that.

00:04:59.357 --> 00:05:03.146
Now all these things put together forms this,

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:05.236
the Andes, you see, is there, standing,

00:05:05.215 --> 00:05:07.715
waiting for its chance.

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:10.955
And when the things will be horrible absolutely,

00:05:10.987 --> 00:05:14.127
there won’t be any atomic bomb blast or anything.

00:05:14.157 --> 00:05:18.846
These, themselves will have earthquakes.

00:05:18.846 --> 00:05:23.717
Now, earthquake is the quality of Mother Earth.

00:05:23.717 --> 00:05:26.217
And she will assert through these.

00:05:26.217 --> 00:05:30.369
And on the right-hand side…

00:05:30.387 --> 00:05:32.887
Actually, it is actually not on the right-hand side,

00:05:32.887 --> 00:05:35.387
but now it’s the left-hand side

00:05:35.387 --> 00:05:39.818
of these Japanese what will happen…

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.788
Because they were made into left-hand sided,

00:05:42.788 --> 00:05:45.137
because they were given these drugs,

00:05:45.138 --> 00:05:47.097
opium, this thing, that thing.

00:05:47.107 --> 00:05:49.017
So they became left-sided.

00:05:49.017 --> 00:05:54.317
Now, these left-handed people
will be finished with volcanoes

00:05:54.356 --> 00:05:56.687
There will be volcanoes. There will be typhoons,

00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:57.923
they’ll be finished.

00:05:57.926 --> 00:06:00.426
While on this side, the

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:03.443
people who have been following

00:06:03.466 --> 00:06:07.663
these all wrong things will be finished with earthquakes.

00:06:07.673 --> 00:06:10.173
And all these places like,

00:06:10.173 --> 00:06:13.345
you can say, the west coast...

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:18.805
The west coast of America is very dangerous,

00:06:18.803 --> 00:06:24.505
because there were so many
atrocities done by Americans.

00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:27.005
They cannot get away with it,

00:06:27.005 --> 00:06:30.188
so themselves they’ll be finished
because they’ll become lunatics,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.438
mad and apart from that, the Mother Earth
itself will finish them, partly.

00:06:38.068 --> 00:06:41.801
Now on the right-hand side,

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:45.811
I think volcanoes will be finished this way,

00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:48.311
at the destruction time they’ll be used….

00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:51.471
But just now as far as now is concerned

00:06:51.503 --> 00:06:55.491
we have to see how many people we can bring out.

00:06:55.513 --> 00:06:59.851
If the number of Sahaja yogis
increases in those areas,

00:06:59.874 --> 00:07:03.811
then maybe, that Mother will be pacified.

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:09.099
The same that was written in the Bible,

00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:12.146
The same is written in the Bible,

00:07:12.146 --> 00:07:19.556
when God wants to come and
kill the Sodom and Gomorrah

00:07:19.543 --> 00:07:23.056
and Abraham perhaps asked to God,

00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:25.296
“but God if there is ten good people,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.116
what will you do?”

00:07:27.116 --> 00:07:29.616
and God said “O.K., I will save them,”

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:33.824
and then Abraham say, “but if there
are nine people, good people?”

00:07:33.856 --> 00:07:36.124
and God say, “O.K. I will save them.”

00:07:36.146 --> 00:07:39.626
so he asked, "And if there's just one good people?"

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:43.025
Then God said: “O.K., I will save that town.”

00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:45.145
And now Mother, are we the same?

00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:47.655
Now we are thousands.

00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:50.155
But in the Bible, it is written only how many?

00:07:50.155 --> 00:07:53.528
Hundred and forty-four thousand.

00:07:53.535 --> 00:07:58.608
That's all?

00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:04.845
We’re about reaching that number,

00:08:04.857 --> 00:08:07.357
one hundred and forty-four thousand.

00:08:10.467 --> 00:08:12.967
Only!

00:08:15.407 --> 00:08:16.797
It's written.

00:08:16.807 --> 00:08:18.547
It is written in the Bible.

00:08:18.547 --> 00:08:22.137
Shri Mataji, does it mean that the Last Judgement

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:27.127
at the time of destruction will manifest in these forms,

00:08:27.155 --> 00:08:28.884
earthquake and volcanoes?

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:31.024
Of course, that will be there.

00:08:31.038 --> 00:08:33.144
So many things will happen

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.313
and people will be killed and destroyed.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.820
And then they'll be put to the last thing,

00:08:37.842 --> 00:08:39.343
they will go to hell.

00:08:39.392 --> 00:08:41.892
People will descend to the hell.

00:08:41.892 --> 00:08:44.392
You see, what will happen on this Earth only,

00:08:44.392 --> 00:08:46.242
people will become mad,

00:08:46.261 --> 00:08:51.342
they’ll start eating faeces, Naraka
they will be creating for themselves.

00:08:51.342 --> 00:08:57.042
Now only the way, say, they are following Rajneesh.

00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:58.962
What are they doing?

00:08:58.962 --> 00:09:01.462
It's Naraka.

00:09:01.462 --> 00:09:03.761
That’s how they’ll be punished.

00:09:03.762 --> 00:09:06.262
And those who are described now, one thousand...

00:09:06.262 --> 00:09:09.551
one hundred and forty-four
thousand is a very small number.

00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:17.980
Can I ask a question about those people
who get killed, Mother and become bhoots?

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.380
Is there never any chance?

00:09:21.404 --> 00:09:23.270
Difficult.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.710
Those who are killed might be,

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:28.320
but those who are possessed...

00:09:28.361 --> 00:09:33.410
You see, what has happened that those
who are killed are reborn again.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.410
And some, those who are...

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.431
have been killing are also reborn.

00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:42.915
So there is a chance for such people.

00:09:42.945 --> 00:09:46.475
But those who are killed are possessing people

00:09:46.473 --> 00:09:48.973
who killed them.

00:09:53.953 --> 00:09:56.003
Why did they kill?

00:09:56.003 --> 00:09:57.939
They had no business.

00:09:57.993 --> 00:10:01.409
“Thou shalt not kill.”

00:10:01.423 --> 00:10:03.923
I mean after all, if you do not

00:10:03.923 --> 00:10:09.440
follow one rule and regulation
of your hopeless government,

00:10:09.426 --> 00:10:11.926
you are punished. What about God?

00:10:11.926 --> 00:10:16.350
He said “thou shalt not kill” and you have killed.

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:18.882
So, you should not be punished?

00:10:18.882 --> 00:10:21.382
I was thinking of those that got killed,

00:10:21.382 --> 00:10:25.076
those who were killed, the victims.

00:10:25.087 --> 00:10:28.076
If they are reborn they will not,

00:10:28.076 --> 00:10:33.663
but if they are taking a revenge, then how to save?

00:10:33.683 --> 00:10:36.853
And they can choose?

00:10:36.883 --> 00:10:39.863
They can choose.

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:43.573
If they want, they should take
their birth, get realisation.

00:10:43.573 --> 00:10:48.304
But they are trying to become bhoots.

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:57.267
The idea of revenge should not be there.

00:10:57.284 --> 00:11:01.254
Now, you see, Indians have only this sense, actually.

00:11:01.254 --> 00:11:04.404
How much Britishers have tortured Indians,

00:11:04.428 --> 00:11:07.384
you have no idea.

00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:10.078
I mean, I cannot tell you how much they have done.

00:11:10.108 --> 00:11:13.188
I can only tell you about my own family,

00:11:13.198 --> 00:11:18.238
that my father’s all houses,
everything was taken away.

00:11:18.238 --> 00:11:22.548
We were living in palaces, we started living in huts.

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:24.858
Cars, everything, all ornaments,

00:11:24.855 --> 00:11:27.865
everything of my mother was taken away.

00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:29.525
Only we had one big...

00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:34.195
mother had a big family gold thing we called Vaijayanti mala,

00:11:34.225 --> 00:11:36.105
that’s the only thing that she had hidden,

00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:39.495
which she pawned and on that she educated us.

00:11:39.462 --> 00:11:41.305
To me, they have beaten,

00:11:41.315 --> 00:11:43.555
they have given me electric shocks.

00:11:43.565 --> 00:11:48.915
They put me on the ice slabs.

00:11:48.938 --> 00:11:52.465
I was a young girl of 18-19 years, you see.

00:11:52.474 --> 00:11:54.734
To so many people they have tortured like this.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:12:00.904
Oh, they have tortured and tortured
to such an extent, you have no idea.

00:12:00.904 --> 00:12:06.477
But... and raping, prostitution,
everything they did to Indians.

00:12:06.504 --> 00:12:08.447
But Indians don’t hate English.

00:12:08.484 --> 00:12:10.984
They don’t hate them.

00:12:10.984 --> 00:12:14.174
They are very kind. If English go there, you see

00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:19.924
some English barristers went in to India and
the holiday was given to the High Court.

00:12:21.836 --> 00:12:24.336
They are so respectful, but when English now,

00:12:24.356 --> 00:12:26.856
when the Indians, because they misbehaved

00:12:26.836 --> 00:12:29.271
and they brought so many Indians with them.

00:12:29.292 --> 00:12:31.481
Now they were given British passports

00:12:31.502 --> 00:12:35.771
and sent as slaves to East Africa to work there.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:41.751
But when East Africa became independent they had British passports, so they came as Britishers.

00:12:41.772 --> 00:12:44.272
Now they are treated as immigrants in England.

00:12:44.272 --> 00:12:46.341
Think of it.

00:12:46.362 --> 00:12:50.446
Actually, they have only British
passport, they have no other passport.

00:12:50.446 --> 00:12:53.666
And 80% of Indians are like that.

00:12:53.671 --> 00:12:58.799
10% are students and 10% may be Pakistanis.

00:12:58.789 --> 00:13:00.159
Can you imagine?

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:02.659
And see the condition of Indians in England,

00:13:02.659 --> 00:13:05.159
the way these English feel about them.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:10.969
So, naturally, one would feel very
embittered with them. Isn’t it?

00:13:10.969 --> 00:13:14.879
But I have never seen any Indian
criticising English people.

00:13:14.902 --> 00:13:18.262
My husband once said it is Indians who are responsible,

00:13:18.272 --> 00:13:22.662
they behave in such a manner, they wash
their clothes, they hang them outside.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.652
This, that!

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.160
He will always blame the Indians;

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.232
they don’t know how to eat on a table,

00:13:28.232 --> 00:13:33.498
they use their hands, this that. Indians!

00:13:33.523 --> 00:13:35.510
Not embittered at all!

00:13:35.518 --> 00:13:37.808
They are the only people who have really forgiven.

00:13:37.838 --> 00:13:40.338
There is no embitterment and you know, in India

00:13:40.338 --> 00:13:42.838
it’s a law, unwritten law.

00:13:42.838 --> 00:13:47.574
I was on the censor board, that no
film can be made against the English.

00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:48.684
Nothing!

00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:52.224
No film is made about our freedom,
independence or about Gandhi.

00:13:52.224 --> 00:13:56.758
This is an Englishman who made it.

00:13:56.768 --> 00:13:59.268
We were not allowed to do that.

00:14:02.234 --> 00:14:11.533
There was a big series, very popular series showing how awful the British had been to the Indians, which was on in England.

00:14:11.564 --> 00:14:15.144
They always tried to debase
Indians, to make fun of them.

00:14:15.144 --> 00:14:24.313
Everybody’s horrified, because we
don’t know. We just read in the books

00:14:24.343 --> 00:14:26.843
What is the name of the series?

00:14:26.923 --> 00:14:31.083
The Jewel in the Crown! It’s called “The Jewel in the Crown”.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:36.033
It is about the last days of the British
Raj. And it is horrible. You can't watch.

00:14:36.028 --> 00:14:37.193
I mean, what do they show there.

00:14:37.185 --> 00:14:40.605
They show bestiality, they show absolute cruelty,

00:14:40.638 --> 00:14:45.785
beating some boy with sticks, accusing
him of raping a girl that he never did.

00:14:45.812 --> 00:14:46.937
Who? English?

00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:47.707
English, yes.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.467
They did?

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.697
It shows the English in a very bad light. Very bad!

00:14:57.448 --> 00:15:01.797
Good, it's being at least exposed.

00:15:01.817 --> 00:15:04.317
Somebody must have talked about it.

00:15:04.317 --> 00:15:09.717
When we watched the film of Gandhi, in
Delhi, when you took us to see that movie,

00:15:09.699 --> 00:15:13.454
at the half time, everybody walked out.

00:15:13.474 --> 00:15:18.244
About forty of the British Sahaja yogis
were just absolutely like stunned mullets

00:15:18.244 --> 00:15:20.104
they couldn’t move.

00:15:20.123 --> 00:15:21.314
That is nothing,

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.514
They have shown nothing, compared
to what people have seen.

00:15:24.514 --> 00:15:27.214
This series is much more brutal than that.

00:15:27.244 --> 00:15:29.744
Watching it was so horrible.

00:15:29.744 --> 00:15:30.655
I heard about it.

00:15:30.655 --> 00:15:31.835
Horrible.

00:15:31.835 --> 00:15:37.385
And you see now, as they were saying
there were no arches or bridges.

00:15:37.425 --> 00:15:40.875
Now, the British must have
removed everything that was there.

00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:44.705
They never respected anything. Even now
they have no respect for our culture,

00:15:44.723 --> 00:15:47.945
for our music, for anything.

00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.015
They haven’t got brains to understand.

00:15:53.366 --> 00:15:56.326
In such ego!

00:15:56.332 --> 00:16:00.006
Shri Mataji, you were saying this
afternoon that a lot of the culture, and

00:16:00.015 --> 00:16:07.742
history and architecture and so on, of India
predates, so much, a lot of the west.

00:16:07.776 --> 00:16:15.395
Most! I mean, I told them that
these people say Greeks brought us all these things,

00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:20.775
but, they have not seen that in India we have something called Ajanta Caves.

00:16:20.775 --> 00:16:21.895
Made in the caves!

00:16:21.904 --> 00:16:30.364
Caves mean like palaces, huge and
one stone, huge, for miles like that.

00:16:30.376 --> 00:16:33.534
I said, if we have learned from the Greeks,

00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:37.556
why don’t the Greeks have something like that.

00:16:37.564 --> 00:16:39.536
They don’t have anything.

00:16:39.536 --> 00:16:45.316
The kind of art we have in our country, you don’t
find it anywhere in the whole world, I think.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:53.058
I mean this now... I've said it of
course, (unclear) but it is built from down upwards.

00:16:57.818 --> 00:17:02.808
It is a cave, you see, from top downwards, in ten centuries.

00:17:04.488 --> 00:17:09.000
Excuse me, Mother, do you want me to translate
for the people that doesn’t understand?

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.530
Please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:09.218
All the engineering, everything
had to be calculated from...

00:18:14.239 --> 00:18:23.419
She’s explained that, what you explained today
that we started from the roof and then we go down...

00:18:23.433 --> 00:18:26.436
Like you were explaining today to this fellow.

00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:28.956
You explained today to [unclear] today

00:18:28.956 --> 00:18:31.226
that we start from the roof and then we go down,

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.940
not from the firmament we go up, it’s just the same.

00:18:34.984 --> 00:18:40.612
It’s India style. It’s a very clever.

00:19:04.486 --> 00:19:10.686
Yes, Mother, but she would just like
to ask some questions about Masonry,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.180
but you were talking about Ajanta, and perhaps
it’s better You finish…

00:19:13.196 --> 00:19:14.636
That I've finished off

00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:17.476
You finish Your talk.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:25.710
No, I am just saying that the Indians, you see,
have got something about them,

00:19:25.703 --> 00:19:28.203
that they are very forgiving.

00:19:28.203 --> 00:19:31.913
There is no embitterness in them, they’re very forgiving.

00:19:31.913 --> 00:19:35.393
They don’t carry any embitterness in their mind.

00:19:35.403 --> 00:19:40.012
And secondly, they are very anonymous.

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:43.483
You will never find name written in any painting.( unclear)

00:19:43.502 --> 00:19:46.792
You will never find an Indian
writing the name or anything.

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:50.776
This is all modern. Of course, modern
people, they are westernised.

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:54.124
But even now, you go anywhere
and ask them, 'Who has done it?"

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.824
Somebody, someone must have done it?

00:19:57.824 --> 00:20:00.967
That ego.

00:20:00.977 --> 00:20:07.187
Very anonymous people and that is only because
it is a very spiritual country, you see.

00:20:07.204 --> 00:20:09.317
The whole tradition is of spirituality.

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.834
That’s why people are very spiritual,

00:20:11.834 --> 00:20:14.948
they are not so materially equipped,

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:21.587
because they never paid much
attention to material advancement, you know.

00:20:21.608 --> 00:20:26.177
Perhaps Mother, I know that Coomaraswamy.

00:20:26.198 --> 00:20:29.778
Coomaraswami is the greatest Indian critic.

00:20:29.778 --> 00:20:36.342
and now everybody has set him
as a master in Indian art.

00:20:36.342 --> 00:20:43.372
I read all of his book and he is an excellent man,
I think. Perhaps he is also realised, I don't know.

00:20:43.388 --> 00:20:44.312
What is his name?

00:20:44.312 --> 00:20:45.982
Coomaraswamy!

00:20:45.982 --> 00:20:48.892
Coomaraswamy!

00:20:48.922 --> 00:20:51.422
Coomaraswamy, I have not read it.

00:20:51.422 --> 00:20:55.482
I think he is a good man.

00:20:56.858 --> 00:21:06.707
He said also that they didn’t
write their name on the [unclear]

00:21:07.668 --> 00:21:15.018
just because they see himself
just as an instrument of God,

00:21:15.018 --> 00:21:17.128
he was just a channel of God.

00:21:17.128 --> 00:21:19.628
He was nothing, just a channel and in fact

00:21:19.628 --> 00:21:26.542
a man who worked in Ellora just
wrote on the walls of Ellora,

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:32.302
“Oh God, how I made it." And he was just meaning that...

00:21:32.322 --> 00:21:33.822
You are... I am the instrument.

00:21:33.822 --> 00:21:39.742
“I am just an instrument, God. Because,
I couldn’t do it, You have done it”. And...

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.912
It is very beautiful.

00:21:41.912 --> 00:21:47.942
And we couldn't understand it in our culture
Mother, we think that we do “I do, I do, I do.”

00:21:47.967 --> 00:21:51.492
But they say “God, You do, I am just a channel.”

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.182
That’s the reason, but you see,
but we had a very bad invasion

00:21:55.182 --> 00:21:58.540
of the tantrikas with the
same kind of thing, you see,

00:21:58.536 --> 00:22:04.462
that those people who started practicing meditation.

00:22:04.482 --> 00:22:10.554
And perhaps they saw Ganesha at Mooladhara
and they thought this is the Kundalini.

00:22:10.554 --> 00:22:17.829
They started taking to sexual things
and all that, and did all wrong things.

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:24.209
Then they found out that they went into the realm
of the subconscious, the collective subconscious.

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:26.709
Then, they got the bhoots in their heads.

00:22:26.709 --> 00:22:34.871
They got ideas that, if you can
destroy the purity of a temple,

00:22:34.887 --> 00:22:37.387
then you can get all the bhoots there.

00:22:37.387 --> 00:22:42.742
So, they tried to destroy all the temples
with their horrible tantric things.

00:22:42.774 --> 00:22:45.274
Erotics they put in, to insult the Goddess.

00:22:45.274 --> 00:22:52.022
If you insult the Goddess, she goes away from there. Supposing, say before me, somebody is misbehaving, I’ll go away.

00:22:52.022 --> 00:22:54.344
Like that, to remove the attention.

00:22:54.362 --> 00:22:56.254
And the tantrism started.

00:22:56.262 --> 00:23:01.055
But, you know, we had no idea
that tantrism is like that.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.475
We never see these things.

00:23:02.475 --> 00:23:07.875
I, myself went to Nepal with my
children, my daughters, my husband

00:23:07.905 --> 00:23:10.855
and we saw all the temples.
We never saw anything erotic.

00:23:10.863 --> 00:23:12.563
Never saw!

00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:16.313
Then when I went to Gregoire, went to write
the book. He said, "Mother it's everywhere."

00:23:16.323 --> 00:23:17.753
I said, "Where?"

00:23:17.753 --> 00:23:22.973
There were some Japanese with
some zoom lenses, you see,

00:23:22.983 --> 00:23:25.801
with these.. .sticks. These....

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:26.701
Tripod.

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:30.865
What you call? These ladders.

00:23:30.916 --> 00:23:34.025
They had brought all the
ladders from Japan, you see?

00:23:34.025 --> 00:23:36.106
In India, you don’t get this kind of ladder.

00:23:36.106 --> 00:23:40.685
Ladders with zoom lenses, standing there.

00:23:40.716 --> 00:23:42.755
and somebody falling and somebody (unclear)

00:23:42.746 --> 00:23:44.015
I said, "What are they doing?"

00:23:44.015 --> 00:23:46.515
He said, "They are taking photographs of these erotics."

00:23:46.515 --> 00:23:51.635
I said, "At that point what do these men want to see?"

00:23:51.635 --> 00:24:02.009
These Japanese, I tell you, even somebody
was doing work on this... your...

00:24:02.034 --> 00:24:05.752
I think.... in Sistine Chapel, some Japanese.

00:24:05.774 --> 00:24:10.232
And he enlarged all
the private parts of all the things,

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:12.748
Every body's!

00:24:15.758 --> 00:24:19.071
Can you believe these dirty people?

00:24:20.858 --> 00:24:23.358
So, this is what it is. You see, we had an attack,

00:24:23.358 --> 00:24:24.758
we would not say no.

00:24:24.752 --> 00:24:26.632
But, these tantrikas came in,

00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:28.832
in the Advent it is given these things..

00:24:28.852 --> 00:24:30.422
Yes.

00:24:30.432 --> 00:24:34.534
These tantrikas did come
and they did attack us.

00:24:34.534 --> 00:24:37.922
But we are innocent, we never
knew these things at all.

00:24:37.922 --> 00:24:41.232
And in India, we don’t know
many things, I tell you.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.307
I did not know what was homosexual,

00:24:43.307 --> 00:24:45.490
I had no idea and when,

00:24:45.479 --> 00:24:49.040
you see, somebody explained to me I
really didn’t eat my food for 8 days.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.540
I couldn’t believe there could be such people.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.040
Many people don’t know there are such people.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:25:00.277
In India, I think at least 90% of people don’t know. At least!

00:25:00.277 --> 00:25:01.177
Maybe 95.

00:25:01.177 --> 00:25:03.677
May I just say Mother?

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:01.064
Mother, just another thing,

00:26:01.064 --> 00:26:06.791
You know that in all Italy is impossible
to find books about the Indian art.

00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:13.545
It is really impossible, but you can find
a book about all the erotics out of India,

00:26:13.565 --> 00:26:15.035
about all the erotics out of China.

00:26:15.063 --> 00:26:18.568
Because we did not know anything existed,

00:26:18.583 --> 00:26:21.928
we did not know anything existed like this.

00:26:21.943 --> 00:26:24.443
We had no idea anything was there.

00:26:24.443 --> 00:26:29.708
It is only in the West when we came, 'Oh
this is Kaama, this is..." What is this?

00:26:29.718 --> 00:26:30.758
Kamasutra!

00:26:30.739 --> 00:26:34.888
Kamasutra. How many Indians have
read this book, even heard about it?

00:26:34.886 --> 00:26:37.386
What is that?

00:26:37.386 --> 00:26:39.886
I mean it's pornography.

00:26:41.996 --> 00:26:43.899
How can you have pornography?

00:26:43.878 --> 00:26:47.419
But here people are, I mean, I don’t
know what sort of people they are.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.909
Educated, uneducated,
everybody viewed pornography?

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:55.919
What is the level?

00:26:55.919 --> 00:27:01.384
I had never known there were
books written like that Kamasutra.

00:27:01.384 --> 00:27:03.884
This must be some tantrika must
have written long time back.

00:27:03.884 --> 00:27:06.979
During the Gupta age, Mother.

00:27:07.014 --> 00:27:07.509
Is it?

00:27:07.509 --> 00:27:08.819
Yes, Mother.

00:27:08.819 --> 00:27:09.879
Gupta Age?

00:27:09.879 --> 00:27:19.009
A little before the Gupta age, because You
know Gupta-ism, [unclear] capitalism in India.

00:27:20.446 --> 00:27:27.956
Gupta, it cannot be, because in the 7th
century, the tantrism took root 6th century,

00:27:27.961 --> 00:27:32.376
after the... after the birth of...

00:27:32.391 --> 00:27:33.491
Adi Shankara

00:27:33.491 --> 00:27:37.991
Adi Shankaracharya it took roots, real roots.

00:27:38.025 --> 00:27:39.531
But could be other.

00:27:39.535 --> 00:27:48.925
It really took a complete form in a very
big way, Tantrism, after the 6th century.

00:27:48.936 --> 00:27:52.198
Just to oust Shankaracharya.

00:27:53.658 --> 00:27:57.238
And then the Buddhist, they went into tantric.

00:27:58.408 --> 00:28:02.430
And these Masonics are another
tantrics in the Occident.

00:28:05.373 --> 00:28:08.958
Masonry is Tantrism.

00:28:12.943 --> 00:28:16.175
But still, Indian people are very innocent.

00:28:17.905 --> 00:28:20.143
You won’t find such people anywhere.

00:28:20.143 --> 00:28:23.563
Even Africans are not like that,
nor Russians are not like that.

00:28:23.578 --> 00:28:25.278
They are very innocent, they don’t understand.

00:28:25.278 --> 00:28:30.678
Such a big man like that Modi, he's a stupid
fool, he doesn’t understand anything.

00:28:34.565 --> 00:28:37.065
He is worse than Me.

00:28:38.592 --> 00:28:40.122
Completely innocent.

00:28:40.122 --> 00:28:42.622
Absolutley!

00:28:45.652 --> 00:28:48.802
and they remain potent until they die,

00:28:48.832 --> 00:28:51.332
because they are so innocent.

00:28:54.742 --> 00:28:57.242
This is all bathroom culture.

00:29:01.212 --> 00:29:04.272
Khajuraho all that is extremely...

00:29:04.272 --> 00:29:07.176
and we never even saw all
these things. We were surprised.

00:29:07.229 --> 00:29:13.606
Khajuraho is the worst, because the
architect himself was a Tantric.

00:29:13.616 --> 00:29:16.116
That is the worst, Khajuraho

00:29:16.116 --> 00:29:19.846
No, not Khajuraho, Konark. Konark is the worst.

00:29:19.867 --> 00:29:24.056
But Khajuraho, the king was a very bad man.

00:29:25.168 --> 00:29:28.578
And his disciples,

00:29:28.584 --> 00:29:32.619
no, no, his ministers were Jains.

00:29:32.643 --> 00:29:35.829
They wanted to have Jain temples.

00:29:35.837 --> 00:29:40.377
So, to please the king they said
alright, we’ll have erotics outside.

00:29:40.397 --> 00:29:42.717
But they had to tell all kinds of stories to the artists.

00:29:42.717 --> 00:29:45.497
They had competition. Artists
were very clever, you see,

00:29:45.497 --> 00:29:47.997
they made very thin erotic pictures,

00:29:48.007 --> 00:29:51.761
and Gods & Goddesses are very healthy, fat.

00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:54.827
And in one corner, you see,
I did not know where it was.

00:29:54.815 --> 00:29:58.017
I went throughout Khajuraho without seeing anything.

00:29:58.005 --> 00:30:03.431
So, I told one lady, “I have read there are
erotics, what is that? I would like to see.”

00:30:03.422 --> 00:30:06.361
So she came around, "In this corner, that corner."

00:30:06.392 --> 00:30:11.461
And one could not see because all the
Europeans and all were so busy there.

00:30:13.512 --> 00:30:19.007
And Mother if you open [unclear] and ask book about
India, you just see this picture. All right.

00:30:19.007 --> 00:30:20.857
Only Khajuraho

00:30:20.857 --> 00:30:23.587
Indian art from the book is only Khajuraho

00:30:23.587 --> 00:30:24.847
Can you imagine?

00:30:24.847 --> 00:30:27.347
And Konark, Khajuraho and Konark.

00:30:27.347 --> 00:30:29.847
And we didn’t even see these things.

00:30:29.847 --> 00:30:32.347
You know, we went with our
daughters. Can you imagine?

00:30:32.347 --> 00:30:38.027
My husband, they won’t even see a
film together with my daughters.

00:30:38.027 --> 00:30:42.497
He’s so shy and we went to Nepal, we never knew.

00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:46.099
My son-in-law who has been so many
days in Nepal, he did not know.

00:30:46.099 --> 00:30:46.859
Can you imagine?

00:30:46.879 --> 00:30:49.579
This is Romel, who seems to
be a very intelligent man.

00:30:50.939 --> 00:30:53.049
He didn’t know anything.

00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:59.243
But it is very far-fetched you know.

00:31:01.859 --> 00:31:04.043
You have to really zoom lenses to see that.

00:31:04.072 --> 00:31:06.572
Yes Mother, on the roof.

00:31:12.952 --> 00:31:15.452
I mean, can’t understand.

00:31:16.932 --> 00:31:23.714
Of course, it entered into our sculpture and all
that in 10th century, but not so visible.

00:31:23.714 --> 00:31:26.214
But they went to another limit of things,

00:31:26.214 --> 00:31:28.974
these Kings, some of them, were very bad Kings,

00:31:28.974 --> 00:31:34.091
but they were after the 7th
century, and they did it.

00:31:34.091 --> 00:31:37.864
But we Indians don’t know.

00:31:37.881 --> 00:31:42.571
I’ve read lots of Sanskrit, I should
say, my mother was a Sanskrit scholar.

00:31:42.591 --> 00:31:44.261
My father was a Sanskrit scholar,

00:31:44.288 --> 00:31:48.868
but they never knew there was a book called Kamasutra.

00:31:48.868 --> 00:31:51.681
We never knew, I mean, it was like pornography.

00:31:51.691 --> 00:31:54.951
I mean, you don't bring pornography
for an educated man, do you?

00:31:54.951 --> 00:31:57.659
I mean, do you study pornography?

00:31:57.711 --> 00:32:01.939
Is it done here for research? Do you have?

00:32:01.981 --> 00:32:03.899
They have art exhibitions of it.

00:32:03.899 --> 00:32:08.319
They have big, big art exhibitions
of pornography and erotica.

00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:09.219
For what?

00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:13.939
Art exhibitions, in the big public galleries.

00:32:15.569 --> 00:32:17.529
Really?  Yes.

00:32:19.639 --> 00:32:22.966
I mean, you mean you have PhD’s on that, do you?

00:32:22.954 --> 00:32:23.592
Probably.

00:32:23.592 --> 00:32:26.092
Not in Italy Mother, nor European.

00:32:26.113 --> 00:32:28.392
In Spain, I think it is.

00:32:28.403 --> 00:32:30.903
One week, erotic  culture.

00:32:36.444 --> 00:32:43.041
They have one week, they have that red
rag for the bull and then next week

00:32:43.064 --> 00:32:45.564
they have this erotica.

00:32:45.564 --> 00:32:48.064
Stupid people.

00:32:51.537 --> 00:32:54.785
What can I do with them, tell
me? Now I have to go to Spain.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.237
I have been in Spain....

00:33:01.237 --> 00:33:01.857
You have been?

00:33:01.887 --> 00:33:04.040
two months and I found also yogis

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.758
Then why don’t you go and see the Sahaja Yogis?

00:33:06.788 --> 00:33:07.658
I will, Mother.

00:33:07.658 --> 00:33:10.568
Poor, this Don. I went with his wife.

00:33:12.538 --> 00:33:18.108
She is now in Barcelona, but now we have a centre also in Madrid

00:33:18.127 --> 00:33:20.281
and we have Spanish people there.

00:33:20.281 --> 00:33:21.131
I met them, Mother

00:33:21.131 --> 00:33:22.211
You met them?

00:33:22.242 --> 00:33:28.858
I met them, Mother and I convinced them
to come to the Guru Puja and they come.

00:33:28.858 --> 00:33:30.192
Very good.

00:33:30.192 --> 00:33:36.828
Nice people, very nice, poor things, but, you
see, the majority is nonsensical like that.

00:33:36.852 --> 00:33:39.352
They’re so stupid. My husband went to Spain,

00:33:39.352 --> 00:33:43.065
they gave him a present of an erotic thing, you see?

00:33:43.065 --> 00:33:46.189
I said, "What is this you have got?"

00:33:46.225 --> 00:33:47.449
I said, “Who gave you?”

00:33:47.475 --> 00:33:49.975
He said, "There’s something special for you.

00:33:49.975 --> 00:33:52.227
Very secretly they gave me”

00:33:52.245 --> 00:33:55.527
I said “This is erotics.” He said,  “Throw it away.”

00:33:55.515 --> 00:33:57.977
These stupid people wanted to insult me.

00:33:57.977 --> 00:33:59.407
Same in Greece.

00:33:59.407 --> 00:34:02.387
In Greece, they gave him erotic stuff, you see.

00:34:02.397 --> 00:34:05.929
To me, they gave me Mary’s face.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.029
He said, “What do they think me
to be?” And he threw it away.

00:34:12.163 --> 00:34:17.389
They think it is intellectual.
They show their freedom, perhaps.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:21.439
Freedom is what? Bathroom? Bathroom freedom.

00:34:21.423 --> 00:34:29.123
I think, in all Spain, they say that
now is a reaction of the Catholic church,

00:34:29.102 --> 00:34:31.602
with the previous government.

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:32.463
Franco!

00:34:32.463 --> 00:34:39.313
He is worst, forced them. Oppressing them, in all sense.

00:34:39.335 --> 00:34:41.835
Now is the reaction, they say, to the Catholic church.

00:34:41.835 --> 00:34:44.335
But that means you have no personality.

00:34:44.335 --> 00:34:45.365
Liberation!

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:52.015
Liberation, the drugs, it’s published, even the
minister said why not to smoke marijuana.

00:34:54.095 --> 00:34:59.194
In every bar you have slot machines, in every bar.

00:34:59.219 --> 00:35:03.495
Now supposing you have a problem
because of Catholic church,

00:35:03.519 --> 00:35:05.219
say they suppressed you.

00:35:05.219 --> 00:35:07.719
So, must you become stupid?

00:35:08.359 --> 00:35:11.569
No, I mean, you must have some
personality of your own, isn’t it?

00:35:13.766 --> 00:35:16.266
And whatever Catholic church preached

00:35:16.266 --> 00:35:19.182
there was nothing wrong with it. I
don’t think there was anything wrong,

00:35:19.182 --> 00:35:21.192
what they said was correct.

00:35:21.212 --> 00:35:24.812
But they did not give you the power to do that.

00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:27.322
The Catholic church themselves
did not have the power,

00:35:27.322 --> 00:35:29.822
nor did they give you the power to do that.

00:35:29.822 --> 00:35:33.798
After Sahaja Yoga, you see it is very easy.

00:35:36.692 --> 00:35:42.308
You enjoy it, being virtuous. Isn’t it?

00:36:53.663 --> 00:36:56.514
I mean, human beings have
become nothing but sex points.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:05.411
See? I mean, even the dogs and the
monkeys and the donkeys have it.

00:37:05.407 --> 00:37:07.337
What is so special about it?

00:37:07.357 --> 00:37:09.187
You see, people talk about sex here.

00:37:09.217 --> 00:37:13.327
You see, in India those, who are
... what we call the hijras people;

00:37:14.497 --> 00:37:17.677
the people who are third person.

00:37:17.691 --> 00:37:19.974
Eunach

00:37:20.007 --> 00:37:21.647
Hermaphrodites.

00:37:21.674 --> 00:37:24.174
You see, and they talk about having a child,

00:37:24.174 --> 00:37:27.097
that’s how human beings talk here.

00:37:27.124 --> 00:37:30.960
Sex is so natural what is so great about it?

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:36.704
I just don’t understand, really.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:39.190
I think these are impotent people who'll...

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:43.330
To them, it is great thing, to talk about sex, perhaps.

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:46.640
What is there to talk and to educate, what is there?

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.960
It is so natural.

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:53.862
To be...  first of all, you have all become unnatural
and then behave like unnatural people.

00:37:55.892 --> 00:37:59.120
It’s all unnaturalness, that’s why you are like this.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.690
Horrible it is. Absolutely horrifying.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.820
Despite all that, we produce
more children than you do.

00:38:10.828 --> 00:38:14.338
We have potent men and women.

00:38:14.358 --> 00:38:16.858
We have very good married lives.

00:38:16.858 --> 00:38:19.358
And we enjoy everything that we have.

00:38:20.338 --> 00:38:22.838
What have you achieved out of your sex?

00:38:22.838 --> 00:38:27.978
Nothing. Divorce, rapist, this, that, prostitution.

00:38:54.867 --> 00:38:57.847
Without Sahaja Yoga, there is no solution, Shri Mataji

00:38:57.847 --> 00:39:00.897
Without Sahaja Yoga, there is no solution, right?

00:39:00.897 --> 00:39:03.397
There is no solution.

00:39:03.397 --> 00:39:05.897
No solution

00:39:05.871 --> 00:39:10.576
They are all going in a mass way to hell, straight.

00:39:11.464 --> 00:39:13.487
Direct to hell.

00:39:13.504 --> 00:39:16.004
I mean what are they becoming? Just think of it.

00:39:17.524 --> 00:39:24.047
It is sensational, this that, nonsense, as if like dead
bodies, you see they need sensations all the time.

00:39:24.697 --> 00:39:30.396
Mother, We were so blind, that we
couldn’t see what we had lost.

00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:35.486
It is so much. How can we try to
explain to the people what we have lost?

00:39:35.493 --> 00:39:36.021
It is too much.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.520
It will happen, gradually they will.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.020
You don’t have to talk about
their past. Forget the past.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.337
You see gradually, because you
develop innocence, you see?

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:48.287
Innocence comes into your eyes.
The relationships are so pure.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:53.420
So relationships are pure, no complications. Nothing. So beautiful.

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:27.270
And with purity of relationship
only, your married lives will be alright.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.980
Otherwise, every man, his wife
is running with another woman.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.990
Err... with another man and the man
is running with another woman.

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:37.050
What sort of morality is that?

00:40:37.039 --> 00:40:39.994
Complete confusion,

00:40:40.009 --> 00:40:43.414
Complete confusion, it is nonsense.

00:40:46.539 --> 00:40:49.039
It is nonsense.

00:40:52.303 --> 00:40:53.987
I can’t understand this.

00:40:56.177 --> 00:41:01.607
I tell you, there’s a gentleman, he became my rakhi brother.

00:41:01.633 --> 00:41:04.133
You see once he just tied a rakhi.

00:41:04.133 --> 00:41:06.463
So I tied him a rahki,

00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:07.953
because he had no sister.

00:41:07.983 --> 00:41:12.483
So, he must be about now, 70 years
of age, or something like this.

00:41:12.506 --> 00:41:15.713
Once I was going to Bombay, uh, to Delhi.

00:41:15.698 --> 00:41:21.218
So my husband said, "Alright, you better go
with him because he is going by train."

00:41:21.241 --> 00:41:24.138
So he booked a coupé for both of us. You see!

00:41:24.171 --> 00:41:26.258
And we went together. I mean he is my brother.

00:41:26.258 --> 00:41:31.776
So my brother from his wife and from
my husband as if he is my brother

00:41:31.776 --> 00:41:33.706
And we went by coupé

00:41:33.726 --> 00:41:37.746
and when we reached there my husband came
to receive me with some foreigners also.

00:41:37.746 --> 00:41:40.766
They were quite surprised. They said,
“Are you divorced Mr Shrivastava?”

00:41:40.783 --> 00:41:41.856
He said, "No!"

00:41:41.906 --> 00:41:43.556
But she is coming out with another man.

00:41:43.556 --> 00:41:46.056
“That’s her brother.” "Oh brother!"

00:41:46.056 --> 00:41:47.477
"But doesn’t look like her.”

00:41:47.501 --> 00:41:50.001
He said, “That’s her brother, she
has accepted him as a brother.”

00:41:50.001 --> 00:41:54.934
But brother cannot travel in
the same coupé, under law.

00:41:54.934 --> 00:42:01.944
If there’s a brother and a sister, they
can’t live in one room, under law.

00:42:01.974 --> 00:42:05.944
What a filth it is!

00:42:05.994 --> 00:42:10.414
Can you imagine? There is no purity
between real brothers and sisters.

00:42:10.456 --> 00:42:15.428
Here is just a brother, which..sort of a Rakhi brother.

00:42:15.448 --> 00:42:18.158
Imagine, and never goes into our heads.

00:42:18.158 --> 00:42:22.537
Nothing, not even my husband’s head,
or his wife’s head or anything.

00:42:30.352 --> 00:42:32.677
So, this is something surprising

00:42:32.677 --> 00:42:34.162
that people don’t understand

00:42:34.162 --> 00:42:38.842
that, as you have to have rules and
regulations for a good civic life,

00:42:38.865 --> 00:42:46.459
for good married life also there has to be certain
rules and regulations which are to be respected.

00:42:46.499 --> 00:42:51.159
For your good married life, there
has to be some rules and regulations.

00:43:00.518 --> 00:43:04.705
Otherwise, how can you have a good married life?

00:43:04.694 --> 00:43:07.655
That is not, that is not curbing yourself.

00:43:07.686 --> 00:43:14.176
Every freedom has to have certain rules and
regulations so that the freedom is preserved.

00:43:14.176 --> 00:43:18.316
For the preservation of the freedom only.

00:43:19.873 --> 00:43:22.148
This is abandonment. Licence...

00:43:22.988 --> 00:43:24.483
Maryada Purushottama.

00:43:24.483 --> 00:43:25.743
Yes.

00:43:25.743 --> 00:43:28.243
Maryada Purushottam

00:43:29.173 --> 00:43:33.943
This is licence. This is not... this
is in no way freedom. It is licence.

00:43:35.403 --> 00:43:37.903
It is abandonment.

00:43:39.421 --> 00:43:40.991
Do you see my point?

00:43:40.991 --> 00:43:45.301
This is in no way this is freedom.

00:43:45.331 --> 00:43:46.331
What is freedom?

00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:47.591
The husband is worried about the wife.

00:43:47.574 --> 00:43:48.811
Wife is worried about the husband.

00:43:48.797 --> 00:43:50.339
Actually, we are free people.

00:43:50.336 --> 00:43:52.096
Like my husband goes all over the world

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:53.469
and I know for definite

00:43:53.443 --> 00:43:55.413
he is not going to look at any woman.

00:43:55.434 --> 00:43:57.223
And he knows for me also,

00:43:57.229 --> 00:44:00.743
so we are free people moving everywhere, happily.

00:44:01.962 --> 00:44:03.733
This is the true freedom, Mother

00:44:03.763 --> 00:44:06.362
It’s the true freedom.

00:44:06.384 --> 00:44:09.222
Yes, we are the free people

00:44:09.249 --> 00:44:10.329
Supposing now,

00:44:10.306 --> 00:44:11.939
he is there, in the house he comes,

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:13.740
if he sleeps in the same bed

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.070
my husband won’t doubt it, won't doubt it.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.080
He is like my son.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:17.990
Of course!

00:44:17.976 --> 00:44:20.476
My sons-in-law will come and sleep with me.

00:44:20.496 --> 00:44:21.845
You won't believe.

00:44:22.831 --> 00:44:24.315
They sleep on the same bed.

00:44:24.299 --> 00:44:26.665
“Just hug me, Mummy, Mummy.”

00:44:26.665 --> 00:44:27.975
Nobody says anything.

00:44:27.975 --> 00:44:29.505
Nobody can even think,

00:44:29.505 --> 00:44:32.485
you know, it doesn’t go into our heads.

00:44:35.335 --> 00:44:36.375
I can’t understand.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.520
With all this thinking

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.420
if people have become mad, like this,

00:44:40.428 --> 00:44:41.640
just sex points.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.240
I mean you have reduced yourself to nothing

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.740
but sex points.

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.240
Think about it? What a degradation!

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.740
We were like that before the Realisation.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.650
But now you have become Shri Ganeshas.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.390
You all have become Shri Ganeshas.

00:44:57.375 --> 00:44:59.490
You have become such great people now.

00:44:59.505 --> 00:45:02.200
But I think, still, I can’t forgive the English

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.700
for what they did to You.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:19.820
English people now has, in South America,

00:45:19.806 --> 00:45:23.260
people are [unclear] against English people,

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.760
just because of Malvinas. (the Falkland Islands.)

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.680
The what?

00:45:26.697 --> 00:45:29.940
The war, that they did unto Argentina.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.857
I didn't understand?

00:45:31.842 --> 00:45:32.303
Argentina?

00:45:32.291 --> 00:45:33.943
Yes, Argentina war with England

00:45:33.956 --> 00:45:37.143
The Malvina Islands

00:45:37.163 --> 00:45:38.993
That war was... people don't like it

00:45:38.972 --> 00:45:43.249
I have seen in all South America,
I usually go by, my job.

00:45:43.249 --> 00:45:49.789
Unclear

00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:51.338
That was very stupid.

00:45:51.357 --> 00:45:54.326
(Tape cuts out and resumes)

00:45:55.517 --> 00:45:58.678
Germans were teaching them and
they had those goose steps.

00:45:58.678 --> 00:46:01.777
Do you know what is a goose step
is? Left right, left right,

00:46:01.798 --> 00:46:04.857
and I asked, "How is it that you know all this?"

00:46:04.868 --> 00:46:06.678
They kept quiet.

00:46:06.678 --> 00:46:07.848
I said, "This is German."

00:46:07.848 --> 00:46:13.738
And there are lots of Germans who have built
up their bases there, horrible Germans.

00:46:13.768 --> 00:46:17.043
So in a way, it is I agree
that they should not have,

00:46:17.043 --> 00:46:18.793
but Argentina is saved,

00:46:18.761 --> 00:46:23.191
because these Germans would
have really finished them off.

00:46:25.678 --> 00:46:28.009
On Friday, I have been in Buenos Aires

00:46:28.017 --> 00:46:30.189
I came to the Puja.

00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:35.807
And I feel now, there is a group waiting for You

00:46:35.817 --> 00:46:38.857
or maybe waiting for me to make the decision.

00:46:38.866 --> 00:46:41.706
I spoke about You and they are really waiting.

00:46:41.695 --> 00:46:45.926
They’ll get it. They’ll get it, because,
you see, their prestige has gone.

00:46:45.926 --> 00:46:48.176
Argentina is in the UN, and all that.

00:46:48.177 --> 00:46:51.711
They have not lost much prestige.
English has lost prestige more.

00:46:51.711 --> 00:46:55.093
But the Germans are finished.

00:46:55.083 --> 00:46:57.363
They were horrible people there, Germans.

00:46:57.339 --> 00:47:01.373
And Germans were training all their
military, all their navy, everything.

00:47:01.373 --> 00:47:03.873
They have built a huge, big barricade,

00:47:03.873 --> 00:47:06.983
which I have seen Myself

00:47:07.013 --> 00:47:08.653
and I was quite frightened.

00:47:08.652 --> 00:47:10.713
So, in a way it's good.

00:47:10.713 --> 00:47:16.447
In a way it’s good, in a way also
Argentina has not lost prestige.

00:47:16.457 --> 00:47:18.277
So it's alright. Doesn’t matter.

00:47:18.311 --> 00:47:23.377
In the war, though, English has won the
war, Argentina has not lost its face, no doubt.

00:47:23.397 --> 00:47:25.897
People feel that Argentina was not wrong,

00:47:25.897 --> 00:47:28.397
in keeping Falklands.

00:47:28.397 --> 00:47:32.317
And still, there is a lot of
reaction against Mrs Thatcher.

00:47:32.317 --> 00:47:37.427
The other day they were asking her,
“How did you bombard that ship?"

00:47:37.427 --> 00:47:39.927
People detest Mrs Thatcher.

00:47:41.897 --> 00:47:46.345
The truth of the real aggressiveness
is coming out now in the war files.

00:47:46.357 --> 00:47:52.035
It is all being exposed, as to how they
overdid the boundaries of normal defense.

00:47:52.018 --> 00:47:53.645
Changing the course of the ship also,

00:47:53.645 --> 00:47:57.625
the ship went and bombarded
and two hundred sixty-five (unclear)

00:47:57.625 --> 00:48:00.125
So all this, prestige wise they have not lost.

00:48:00.125 --> 00:48:02.625
But these Germans are reduced
I am very happy about them,

00:48:02.625 --> 00:48:05.125
because these Germans, if you
allow them to grow like that.

00:48:05.125 --> 00:48:07.625
They are still in Chile, Mother, now.

00:48:07.605 --> 00:48:10.626
They are still in Chile now.

00:48:10.657 --> 00:48:11.146
Chile

00:48:11.146 --> 00:48:13.646
They have moved in Chile?

00:48:13.666 --> 00:48:18.917
They are now there, with Pinochet
and all these people, doing the same.

00:48:18.927 --> 00:48:26.067
But Chile people are also…Chile
government is very, very tough government.

00:48:26.077 --> 00:48:28.337
Shri Mataji, they’d like to give you dinner now.

00:48:28.337 --> 00:48:29.939
All right?

00:48:29.939 --> 00:48:33.749
Thank You very much for talking to us.

00:48:47.559 --> 00:48:51.587
I’m going to eat what you have brought for me.
