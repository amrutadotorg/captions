00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:07.405
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:29.844
There is no such area/courtyard in
life where man does not search.

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:39.721
Sometimes he doesn't know what
he is searching for.

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:54.236
He doesn't know that there is something
lost within him that he is searching for.

00:00:55.234 --> 00:01:03.044
Superficially no matter how much he may
say, 'I am fine,' or 'I am satisfied.'

00:01:05.343 --> 00:01:23.263
But if he thinks from within, then
there is some quest hidden within him
which is calling him from every side.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:43.190
Sometimes he thinks that if I earn
a lot of money then I will surely
find contentment/solution

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:54.369
And in his search of how to make
money, he does wrong things.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:04.269
But I have never seen any rich
person very happy, not till today.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.460
All those who come to Me say,
"Mother, in every way there
is discord in the house."

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:17.551
"And I don't have any peace within
me, please give me peace."

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:30.017
Then someone thinks that, "My physical
strength should increase so much
that the world trembles before me."

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:36.573
And he keeps trying that,
"I should make my body strong."

00:02:38.747 --> 00:02:46.387
"Even then I don't get peace."
He also says, "Mother, give me peace."

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.570
After that many people run
towards power, work very hard

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.323
'I want this power, I want that power.'

00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:03.546
I have seen even people with great
power that they have no peace.

00:03:05.173 --> 00:03:09.693
They also wonder where can this
peace be found.

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:30.345
In this way man is wandering here
and there, running about in
search of peace.

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:46.709
But where is this peace? Which
is that path through which this
peace could be found

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:59.015
whereby we can know the secret of
this peace? If there is such an
auspicious temple, then people
roam around in temples,

00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:05.635
then go to some gurus and then
get lost in books.

00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:19.283
Whether they believe in God or not,
but all the time they feel that
there is no peace within.

00:04:22.754 --> 00:04:31.914
When man evolved from animal to
human, then he lost his peace.

00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:42.581
Because animals are in the control
(loop) of God, so there is no need
for them to be disturbed

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:54.757
but there are two such institutions
inside a human being which do not
allow him to relax.

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:03.959
One of those institutions, which
we can say, is ego.

00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:12.772
It is only man who thinks, 'I do
this, I do that, I did this,
I did that,'

00:05:12.772 --> 00:05:17.355
or 'I have to do this' or 'My
forefathers did this.'

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:24.473
'What do I do next?' - he
thinks ahead.

00:05:25.094 --> 00:05:31.044
Which other special thing I want
to do - always thinking of the future.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:39.650
He is not at peace with what he
has at present. You know it is
said in Economics,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:48.457
in Economics, that the human wants
are never completely satisfied.

00:05:49.217 --> 00:05:57.027
You just see, today you bought this thing,
after that bought another thing -

00:05:57.755 --> 00:06:05.635
will go through so much trouble for
each thing and when they get that thing,
is achieved, it becomes worthless.

00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:13.011
Then started running after another
thing. When the other thing is got,
then after getting it,

00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:18.593
forgot everything how difficult
it was to get it, how much we
desired for it,

00:06:18.593 --> 00:06:24.607
forgot everything and thought
that it was useless, now do
something else .

00:06:24.887 --> 00:06:31.446
In this way a person's mind wanders
and starts running from one thing
to another.

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:39.609
And he starts thinking, 'Look,
I have so many nice things.'

00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:49.621
Despite having everything, he does
not have peace within him. Still,
he remains restless.

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:57.309
Some need one thing, some need
another. Some need things,

00:06:58.633 --> 00:07:06.393
some people desire for a home,
some people want children,

00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:19.248
then someone has a desire for power.
He runs after it and finds that
despite having all this,

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:30.859
even though this whole ocean is in
front of me, just like a bird
remains thirsty in the ocean

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:42.212
similarly, this ocean of the people
does not have the power to quench
my thirst.

00:07:48.052 --> 00:07:54.982
On the other hand, another institution
that has been formed within us, is
that of sanskaras (values).

00:07:55.609 --> 00:08:07.299
The values ​​start getting settled.
Someone says that from today onwards
do Surya Namaskar (prayer to the Sun)
every day.

00:08:09.547 --> 00:08:15.927
Now it's done that Surya Namaskar has
to be done. Now Surya Namaskar was
done today, was done tomorrow,

00:08:15.927 --> 00:08:21.654
was done the day after; done fifty
times, then a hundred times; in the
end got to know that he died of a
heart attack.

00:08:25.486 --> 00:08:31.366
If someone tells us some ritual,
then we go to the extremes.

00:08:31.923 --> 00:08:40.093
Despite having good values,
there is no peace in man/person.

00:08:40.738 --> 00:08:44.908
Like I know there is a gentleman,
he is a very honest man.

00:08:45.229 --> 00:08:50.589
He is so honest that he even points
out his wife's mistakes in front
of others.

00:08:54.206 --> 00:09:04.216
People call him honest, he is
such an honest man. But he does
not have peace in his mind.

00:09:04.927 --> 00:09:11.197
Why is there no peace within you
when you are on the path of honesty?

00:09:12.783 --> 00:09:17.173
And even then he will say, "See,
I could have earned this much money,'

00:09:17.173 --> 00:09:25.209
'But look, I'm honest, I didn't.
I didn't collect any money.'

00:09:25.222 --> 00:09:31.552
I don't think it is a special
thing for a person to be honest.

00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:39.625
Or there is a man who says,
'I speak the truth, I'm outspoken
too, I speak the truth.'

00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:48.512
'I speak the truth in every matter.'
But still he does not have peace
of mind.

00:09:48.658 --> 00:09:57.598
Only the values are present inside him.
So these sanskaras of religion which
are within us are from without.

00:09:57.598 --> 00:10:07.541
From that, it's just this that we
are pure people with pure conduct.

00:10:07.609 --> 00:10:20.289
But it's not empty yet, it's hollow.
No moistness of peace has come in it yet.

00:10:20.692 --> 00:10:29.592
There is no coolness of peace.
And most of the people who are
overly honest,

00:10:30.953 --> 00:10:37.263
they are so aggressive and short-tempered
- should always keep a distance of
five feet from them.

00:10:38.407 --> 00:10:46.557
Never know when they will push
you down because such people
have too much anger in them.

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:56.259
Because this sanskar (value) is also
an imposed ornament, which becomes
cumbersome,

00:10:56.415 --> 00:10:59.875
whose burden cannot be borne by man.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:10.390
Similarly that, we have children,
we should take care of them,
we should insure them,

00:11:10.549 --> 00:11:14.739
there should be property for them,
this should be done for the wife.

00:11:14.739 --> 00:11:26.364
Thinking about many such things also,
man can not attain his peace.

00:11:26.576 --> 00:11:34.716
I was once very surprised that in
Maharashtra there was a very
sober(grave) man,

00:11:35.631 --> 00:11:50.041
and he made a very nice project by
making a very beautiful Varna Nagar.

00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:57.131
Thousands of people got jobs in
it and he made it absolutely such

00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:03.216
that it felt as if you have come to
a big city of some Western country.

00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:08.006
Well-organized provisions were made
for everyone, everything was done.

00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:17.171
So I thought I should meet this
great man and he expressed a great
desire that he wanted to meet Mother.

00:12:17.244 --> 00:12:23.594
When I reached there he grabbed
My feet and started crying.

00:12:23.594 --> 00:12:27.510
Such an aged man - I said,
"What's happening to you,
why are you crying?"

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.986
Started saying, "Please let me take out
my pent up feelings; I have no peace of
mind at all."

00:12:31.986 --> 00:12:40.943
I said, "Why?" He said, "This Varna
Nagar that I have built, people
think highly of it,"

00:12:40.943 --> 00:12:45.658
"But I think I have ruined all
the able people."

00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:52.535
There were people here who did not
drink alcohol, so they have started
drinking, business of bad women
has started here,

00:12:52.535 --> 00:12:55.980
Here (UNCLEAR - Republic?) has started,
drugs have started here.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.012
Such things are happening here
that You won't believe.

00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:11.137
And above all, there are all kinds of
horrible atrocities and extreme
violence here, I don't know why.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:18.530
I was very surprised at this. He said,

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:24.978
"Mother, I did all the work with
good intentions in my heart to
develop this village."

00:13:24.978 --> 00:13:32.351
"With a lot of hard work and desire, I
brought it to such heights of progress.
I built so many schools in it,"

00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:38.597
"built colleges, what all I did
and in the end what is the outcome,"

00:13:38.597 --> 00:13:46.883
"that such corrupt/vicious people that when
I see them in the morning, I feel like
that why should I taint myself?"

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:53.494
Will drink alcohol the whole night.
Will take small children with them
and they all will drink.

00:13:56.592 --> 00:14:07.782
So whatever good deeds he did,
whatever work he did, that too
went to waste. Still there is
no peace among the people.

00:14:09.054 --> 00:14:18.174
When there was no freedom in our country,
Gandhiji used to say, 'First let freedom
come, then You can start Sahaja Yoga.'

00:14:18.174 --> 00:14:21.305
Until You are not free, how will
You start Sahaja Yoga?

00:14:21.344 --> 00:14:26.604
All right, I said, let freedom come.
That freedom came.

00:14:27.554 --> 00:14:33.594
Many people surrendered their
selves, sacrificed, freedom
came after doing a great deal.

00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:43.916
But now when I look at people,
I wonder where have these cunning
mafia-like people come from after
independence.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:50.730
I don't understand. The people of
that time who were fighting,

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:58.592
who went to prison, those who faced
so many problems, who are these people
who have come instead of them?

00:14:58.878 --> 00:15:07.498
It seems as if these demons have
come and sat in the place of the
gods and goddesses of Heaven.

00:15:07.738 --> 00:15:18.348
How much the society has changed!
Is this why we got independence?
People say a lot of things.

00:15:18.348 --> 00:15:23.714
Recently the people of Bangladesh
told Me that, "We fought so much Mother
that we want Bangladesh,

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:28.597
want Bangladesh, want Bangladesh.
What did we get from the
independence of Bangladesh?"

00:15:32.138 --> 00:15:38.098
So many people died in Bangladesh and
how much poverty has come in Bangladesh

00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:46.125
that this poverty is never going
to go away.

00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:50.490
This will keep on increasing,
our poverty will keep on
increasing day by day.

00:15:51.204 --> 00:15:54.784
Similar is the condition of the Pakistanis too.

00:15:55.776 --> 00:16:03.346
And if by any means you think that
through this fighting, this trouble
and sacrifice,

00:16:03.346 --> 00:16:11.574
and even if by talking big you achieve
something, you will still feel that
you have not achieved anything.

00:16:13.571 --> 00:16:23.761
Condition will be the same. Like
if you buy a car, then you feel
what car, should buy a house now.

00:16:24.614 --> 00:16:29.164
Bought a house, then will feel,
what is it of the house, my
sister is not married yet.

00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:36.499
In this way only, all the great things
that happened in the world and the
great battles for freedom were fought,

00:16:36.499 --> 00:16:46.323
did this, did that - but today,
no matter which country you go
to, man has become so distracted

00:16:46.323 --> 00:16:54.099
that can't understand that after fighting
so many battles, after becoming so
talented, after making so much progress,

00:16:54.099 --> 00:17:05.584
on what brink is man standing today?
Don't know when he will be destroyed,
when he will be ruined.

00:17:06.131 --> 00:17:13.931
A lot of people who are sitting that
(UNCLEAR), don't know how we're
going to be finished,

00:17:14.388 --> 00:17:23.608
but despite all this, man's quest
is towards peace.

00:17:25.884 --> 00:17:33.964
When there is a search in that too,
many associations are formed. Groups
in the name of this, groups in the
name of that.

00:17:33.964 --> 00:17:39.085
Recently I heard that in the demand
for peace (UNCLEAR).

00:17:39.698 --> 00:17:47.538
I have seen such people also who
have received Nobel Prize for Peace
but are so short-tempered

00:17:49.796 --> 00:17:59.646
and so full of anger that there are
ten thousands of wrinkles on their face.

00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:05.781
And as soon as we see them we feel,
'Oh my God, who is this messenger
of death?'

00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:12.807
and they have got the Nobel Prize
for Peace.

00:18:14.429 --> 00:18:18.049
From which angle did they look at
the person and gave the Nobel Prize?

00:18:18.307 --> 00:18:22.297
And upon asking the people that,
'Oh, are they coming here tomorrow?'

00:18:22.297 --> 00:18:27.966
'Oh my God, just don't ask anything.
Her tongue is like a sword?'

00:18:29.006 --> 00:18:37.176
And such anger that she dances from
here to there, from there to here,
when her temper rises.

00:18:37.737 --> 00:18:47.887
And has got Nobel Prize for Peace.
This world is also a strange drama.

00:18:48.041 --> 00:18:57.841
This alchemy of Kaliyug, all this
was going to happen in this Kaliyug.
This has indeed happened.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:06.580
But along with this a very great
blessing has come from God due to
which we (UNCLEAR).

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:14.884
In which this All-Pervading Power of
God's love has now taken pity

00:19:14.884 --> 00:19:25.188
on man, on his stupidity, that I gave
him freedom to find his freedom
find the Truth,

00:19:25.188 --> 00:19:34.060
search for God, then don't know what
all swirls he is carrying and what
condition he has made of himself.

00:19:35.681 --> 00:19:45.841
Why did it happen like this? Perhaps
it is the Power of Love of the
compassionate God,

00:19:45.841 --> 00:19:55.485
He felt compassion and in that
compassion, His form has changed
in the KritaYuga.

00:19:59.088 --> 00:20:06.338
Today Sahaja Yoga is taking full
advantage of that KritaYuga.

00:20:07.551 --> 00:20:18.451
The advent of KritaYuga and its
manifestation is a great blessing
for us.

00:20:18.692 --> 00:20:28.392
Anyone who does not take advantage
of this (opportunity) at this time,
will indeed be very unfortunate.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:44.450
There is no one as unblessed/miserable as the
one who cannot fully achieve the
blessings of this God.

00:20:47.522 --> 00:20:54.832
But in Kaliyug, we have even
lost faith in God.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:21:04.600
We think that God does not exist,
and even if He exists,
He must be sitting somewhere.

00:21:06.196 --> 00:21:14.066
People do not understand anything,
they are looking towards God in
delusion.

00:21:14.719 --> 00:21:23.199
And in order to understand this,
KritaYuga has come for you to
achieve Self-realisation.

00:21:24.379 --> 00:21:40.619
In Self-realisation you reach to
that abode which is the source
of peace. The peace of peace.

00:21:41.983 --> 00:21:52.573
From where peace flows, from where
the stream flows out, and whenever
desired, then also there is peace.

00:21:53.862 --> 00:22:04.322
Such a person is not only calm
himself, but wherever he goes,
there peace resides.

00:22:04.368 --> 00:22:10.778
Suddenly the person starts wondering
that who has come and stood there.

00:22:10.778 --> 00:22:16.844
Early in the morning it seems that
who is this statue of peace who
has come and stood there.

00:22:16.846 --> 00:22:24.366
It was as if peace had started flowing
from within and whatever restlessness
I had felt has vanished.

00:22:27.027 --> 00:22:39.216
Where did all that restlessness that
came from our ego and our mind disappear?

00:22:39.396 --> 00:22:54.536
And in this salty water, in this
salty water of the sea, from where
has a beautiful pond of Peace formed.

00:22:56.088 --> 00:23:06.188
How has this peace surged within
us and has calmed us down.

00:23:06.533 --> 00:23:17.743
And now it seems that all things
are swaying in peace. The speed
of peace has come.

00:23:18.093 --> 00:23:28.763
We think of peace as something
like ice that neither melts nor
spreads.

00:23:29.419 --> 00:23:35.409
Our opinion is this only, a person
whom we call a peaceful person,

00:23:35.409 --> 00:23:39.005
he neither speaks nor moves;
remains seated at his place.

00:23:40.738 --> 00:23:49.178
The peace of a Sahaja Yogi is like ice
but the ice flows

00:23:49.268 --> 00:23:57.647
and whomsoever it touches, it calms
them down, it gives them comfort.

00:23:58.111 --> 00:24:04.491
The alchemy to achieve this peace is
completely created within you by God.

00:24:04.564 --> 00:24:07.674
Has been very beautifully made,
with a lot of love.

00:24:07.826 --> 00:24:16.566
As if an artist is sitting in a
very peaceful place and drawing
a beautiful picture.

00:24:16.717 --> 00:24:22.957
In this way God has created this
beautiful creation within you.

00:24:23.707 --> 00:24:38.097
You don't even know and the peace
that He has filled in that creation,

00:24:38.731 --> 00:24:50.691
it creates peace in all our chakras
at the time of Kundalini awakening.

00:24:52.605 --> 00:24:58.185
This is the power of our Kundalini
passing through the seven chakras.

00:24:59.381 --> 00:25:11.631
And when it passes through each
energy centre, then each energy
centre has a peace of its own,

00:25:15.213 --> 00:25:21.943
its lake that is, it makes it
absolutely calm.

00:25:23.457 --> 00:25:31.637
As if there's a lake in which
there is absolutely no disturbance,
it's a calm lake.

00:25:31.771 --> 00:25:40.371
The beauty spread around that lake
is completely reflected in it
and gives joy.

00:25:40.371 --> 00:25:52.954
Similarly, how in such a person
does the lake of peace get
established in every chakra.

00:25:53.815 --> 00:26:10.025
All the beauty, all the tenderness,
all the love, all the joy that is
spread around it,

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:16.750
is reflected, but such a person's
life blossoms.

00:26:17.979 --> 00:26:24.029
Many people think that how can Kundalini
be awakened easily like this.

00:26:26.255 --> 00:26:29.955
At least in our country many
people know about Kundalini

00:26:29.955 --> 00:26:35.060
Many do not even know, they are very
ignorant. But they cannot believe this

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:42.542
that the Kundalini which rises
through great, difficult penance,
how does it rise so easily?

00:26:43.844 --> 00:26:47.464
Our chakras are not yet clean,
our lives are also not clean

00:26:52.430 --> 00:27:02.460
But the KritaYuga has already begun;
Its blessings which you have received

00:27:02.803 --> 00:27:10.034
thus that KritaYuga has brought
this environment/state today,

00:27:10.034 --> 00:27:17.099
that the Kundalini within us is
suddenly, at once awakened.

00:27:18.722 --> 00:27:27.972
And due to this blessing only,
today thousands of people in the
world are realizing their Spirits

00:27:27.998 --> 00:27:33.128
and are attaining that peace which
is the nature of that Spirit.

00:27:33.316 --> 00:27:39.226
Unless peace comes within a person,
he cannot think of anything,

00:27:39.226 --> 00:27:44.329
can't work out anything in a
smooth manner

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:48.169
and even after doing it, the
satisfaction is not achieved.

00:27:51.726 --> 00:27:57.446
The satisfaction is also not
something so concrete that you
have found the satisfaction.

00:27:57.446 --> 00:28:01.356
Meaning, any such thing you got
in your hands.

00:28:02.464 --> 00:28:13.164
This is also a leaning of the attention,
the form of that instinct is different,
that has changed.

00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:20.013
Just understand, that the instinct/disposition
which was running all around, has been
absorbed/settled within you.

00:28:20.214 --> 00:28:26.514
Those instincts, those tendencies,
all of those tendencies have come
into this life.

00:28:27.229 --> 00:28:34.340
So I said that, 'Now I am sitting in contentment.'
With pure attention I am just seeing.'

00:28:35.959 --> 00:28:48.049
But what is reflecting within you
after finding this contentment?

00:28:48.647 --> 00:28:56.593
Complete peace. So the peace of
this peace is the Kundalini.

00:28:57.049 --> 00:29:03.109
It resides within you and it/She is
your Mother, extremely peaceful.

00:29:04.069 --> 00:29:11.169
She is very calm and knows everything
about you.

00:29:11.425 --> 00:29:17.575
Just as is a tape record, in the same
way this peace has known everything
about you,

00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:23.525
that how is this son of Mine. She
is the Mother within you,
your individual Mother.

00:29:23.818 --> 00:29:28.828
Now She is sitting peacefully.
Many people say that She is
in a dormant state,

00:29:28.828 --> 00:29:37.755
waiting for an opportunity that some
authorized person comes and helps Me
progress in My rising up/upliftment.

00:29:38.667 --> 00:29:49.907
Not only this, that It should take
care of My son and impart all this
knowledge to him.

00:29:53.142 --> 00:30:08.522
And when She rises up, then knowing
what the path is like, where all to
stop on My son's way,

00:30:08.522 --> 00:30:13.415
which of his chakras are caught up,
how to pass through them,

00:30:14.085 --> 00:30:18.015
so that he does not face any problem,
he does not have any uneasiness.

00:30:20.281 --> 00:30:32.151
And very carefully/cautiously, cherishingly,
this Kundalini of peace rises

00:30:32.987 --> 00:30:39.257
and after rising up, imagine that
It pierces your bone.

00:30:39.296 --> 00:30:43.476
It pierces the bone of the head
and you don't even realize it.

00:30:46.705 --> 00:30:55.325
And if you just look at your chakras,
especially your Sahastrara,

00:30:55.490 --> 00:31:18.970
then it will appear as if nice, beautiful
lights of seven different colors are moving,
absolutely calm, oscillating, shaking.

00:31:20.326 --> 00:31:29.296
Slowly they are blooming, slowly they
are closing. Absolutely calm.

00:31:29.995 --> 00:31:36.475
Only fire rises above leaving the
element of earth.

00:31:36.703 --> 00:31:43.033
Similarly, Kundalini also, gravity
which is the element of earth,

00:31:43.042 --> 00:31:47.892
It crosses it and rises up.

00:31:47.892 --> 00:31:56.552
But the element of fire which
burns and gives heat,

00:31:58.101 --> 00:32:09.811
that same fire seems to be absolutely calm.
So these petals also, which are of your elements,

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:25.380
in the same way it seems, that the kindled
flames of these lamps burning here,
are absolutely calm.

00:32:25.487 --> 00:32:39.567
A strange sight is seen and then we
know that it is something extraordinary.

00:32:39.762 --> 00:32:53.752
Kundalini is neither as fiery
as fire nor does it give us shocks
like electricity,

00:32:54.022 --> 00:32:57.752
and it doesn't either carry us
away like water.

00:32:59.034 --> 00:33:07.064
But what it does is that by going
into every chakra it achieves
such a state of peace

00:33:07.064 --> 00:33:13.483
that every chakra is flushed with
that peace, is nourished by it.

00:33:13.584 --> 00:33:23.234
And in that peace its work gets
greatly balanced.

00:33:25.028 --> 00:33:31.958
Say, if you're taking a tree
onto a ship,

00:33:31.958 --> 00:33:37.987
or you're carrying a small plant,
and you notice the ship is shaking
a lot,

00:33:38.132 --> 00:33:41.332
in some time you will see that
the plant will die.

00:33:43.976 --> 00:33:54.636
Similarly if something is very restless,
there are a lot of problems in any house,

00:33:54.662 --> 00:34:05.882
children cannot prosper there.
Nothing can prosper in unrest
and see its beautiful form.

00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:13.391
So first of all the function of
Kundalini is to calm down all
the chakras first.

00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:21.011
And calmness comes, tranquility
comes in the human being, which is
complete security,

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.090
when he knows that I'm completely safe.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:36.470
That knowledge is not through the
intellect, but it becomes a part of
one's nature and he is safe, then
why worry?

00:34:37.134 --> 00:34:46.264
Sitting comfortably. Similarly, this
special state comes on all the chakras.

00:34:46.264 --> 00:34:50.441
And these chakras become absolutely calm.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:57.180
You can't achieve peace with anything.

00:34:57.497 --> 00:35:03.597
Many people said that, "Mother,
we do a lot of worship," "Okay,"

00:35:03.636 --> 00:35:08.766
“But we are not peaceful. We go
to temples, we are not peaceful.”

00:35:08.766 --> 00:35:12.819
"We read books, we are not peaceful.
We sing many hymns, we are not peaceful."

00:35:14.049 --> 00:35:22.929
"It provides some entertainment and
mind is distracted for a while,
but are not peaceful."

00:35:25.539 --> 00:35:33.059
The nature of this peace comes
from Kundalini.

00:35:34.214 --> 00:35:48.854
Kundalini is present in the Mooladhara
chakra within us, which is made up of
the earth element.

00:35:49.104 --> 00:35:55.614
But Mooladhara is the symbol of your
dharma(sustenance) and from there it

00:35:58.184 --> 00:36:09.684
takes all Its strength which is
peace-loving, and when it rises

00:36:10.546 --> 00:36:17.366
then you wonder what it was,
whatever was making me unstable,

00:36:17.366 --> 00:36:20.726
which were bothering me, don't
know where those thoughts have gone.

00:36:20.726 --> 00:36:24.646
So the first thing, when it comes
to the Agnya, it silences the Agnya.

00:36:25.474 --> 00:36:29.574
As soon as you calm down, it
takes you beyond the Agnya.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:39.470
After that when it comes into your
brain, it calms that down as well.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.200
Nowadays this disease of tension
has become very common.

00:36:44.957 --> 00:36:48.797
The reason for this is that
there is no peace in the brain.

00:36:48.837 --> 00:36:52.087
Now you can take its injections,
drink alcohol, do anything.

00:36:52.866 --> 00:37:01.166
There is a brief forgetfulness, after
that the situation becomes even worse.
That tension has returned again.

00:37:01.554 --> 00:37:07.108
Because the peace-giving power
is the Kundalini inside you.

00:37:07.585 --> 00:37:16.605
Man cannot attain peace by doing
anything unless his Kundalini
is awakened.

00:37:17.307 --> 00:37:21.557
Therefore it is extremely important
for the Kundalini to be awakened.

00:37:22.339 --> 00:37:32.589
And as no work can be done in
a disturbed place. There is a
fear in man all the time.

00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:39.778
If someone says that there is
rioting going on in Ghaziabad,
then no one will sit here.

00:37:40.518 --> 00:37:45.668
If someone says that there is
going to be an earthquake here,
then no one will listen.

00:37:45.995 --> 00:37:52.075
But someone says that everyone
there is listening very peacefully
and everyone is sitting quietly,

00:37:54.907 --> 00:38:08.057
then in this way a new order of
human beings is known, knowledge
is obtained,

00:38:08.077 --> 00:38:16.527
in which everyone is sitting peacefully,
everyone is listening peacefully,
everyone is singing peacefully,

00:38:17.465 --> 00:38:25.585
and there is nothing that is
causing any dispute or trouble
to anyone.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:33.148
In that peace, no words ever come
out of the mouth which would
cause pain to others,

00:38:33.148 --> 00:38:36.948
trouble others, hurt others.

00:38:37.158 --> 00:38:42.088
His hands cannot do any such
work which will

00:38:42.088 --> 00:38:47.454
hit or kill others because hands
have become peaceful.

00:38:50.727 --> 00:38:56.777
There is a very peaceful atmosphere
in the house of such a person.

00:38:56.777 --> 00:39:01.488
The plants and trees in such
houses are very big.

00:39:04.029 --> 00:39:10.839
If you keep flowers in the room
of such a person, even the
plucked flowers turn bigger

00:39:10.962 --> 00:39:17.122
and fragrance starts coming out
of them. There are many miracles
of this peace.

00:39:18.216 --> 00:39:25.906
You can especially see its miracle
on all living things.

00:39:25.937 --> 00:39:34.117
As, a gentleman who is a big scientist
in Austria was told

00:39:34.117 --> 00:39:41.488
that we have a [UNCLEAR - CORNER?]
in which the trees are dying,
make arrangements to save them.

00:39:42.381 --> 00:39:53.521
So he, used vibrations which are
peaceful, created his experiment
by taking the vibrated water.

00:39:53.645 --> 00:40:02.184
Surprisingly, all the trees
that were dying survived,
but the very old trees died.

00:40:02.504 --> 00:40:12.634
And all of them became so white
that people say that such trees
are no longer seen in India.

00:40:14.887 --> 00:40:20.117
You will come to know from a
distance only that this is
a Sahaja Yogi's farm.

00:40:20.593 --> 00:40:27.543
Because the wheat from a Sahaja
Yogi's field is big, shiny
and has a great taste.

00:40:27.618 --> 00:40:40.698
And the biggest thing is that they
were made from non-hybrid seeds,
ordinary seeds were used to make them.

00:40:43.446 --> 00:40:50.346
This area of yours, the area of
Meerut, I have known for many years.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:59.180
You must have heard that all the
land of Oonche Gaon - My husband
was the collector here and I
used to visit Ghaziabad as well.

00:41:00.456 --> 00:41:07.776
They said that, "Collector Sahab
it is important that farming
be done here."

00:41:08.581 --> 00:41:13.221
So My husband said, "Okay see,
this land lying here is very old."

00:41:13.588 --> 00:41:21.258
That is land from before 1857
and the British had also built
graves there for their dogs.

00:41:21.264 --> 00:41:28.744
There were lots of graves of
horses, of dogs, (UNCLEAR) and
the houses there were very big.

00:41:30.378 --> 00:41:35.908
So I said, "Okay, the work of
Shakambhari should be done here."

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:42.760
Because Shakambhari Devi manifests
Herself here [UNCLEAR - Athena?].

00:41:45.398 --> 00:41:56.258
And I said, okay, I will do it.
So I started farming.

00:41:57.533 --> 00:42:08.743
And I said that (UNCLEAR) gave
vibrated water to all.

00:42:08.752 --> 00:42:12.852
First soaked them for a while
and then sowed them.

00:42:14.368 --> 00:42:19.928
And you'll be surprised the tomatoes
produced were so very big.

00:42:19.928 --> 00:42:23.183
The tomatoes produced were so big
and so crisp.

00:42:23.354 --> 00:42:27.254
So people came from Bombay. They
said, 'Let us take these with us.'

00:42:30.252 --> 00:42:34.752
And the brinjals grew so big.

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:40.513
Some of them weighed almost three
quarters of a kilo each brinjal, so
much so that was difficult to lift them.

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:46.640
And wheat grew so much that it
was a record.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.845
They started saying that, 'This
cannot happen anywhere. How did
someone grow wheat in their house?'

00:42:50.845 --> 00:42:55.543
And the cucumber spread so much,
I told him, "Distribute it as
much as you can."

00:42:55.655 --> 00:43:01.115
I had kept a buffalo there, it would
sometimes give 18 seers of milk.

00:43:01.115 --> 00:43:03.999
What to do now, who will drink
18 kilos of milk in the house?

00:43:05.196 --> 00:43:10.396
Nobody could understand what
had happened. Cabbage so big.

00:43:10.396 --> 00:43:17.030
Everything there grew so very big
that couldn't understand.

00:43:17.919 --> 00:43:27.539
There was a Commissioner sahab, he
was I.G. of police there. Both of them
used to come in the morning during
their walk.

00:43:27.796 --> 00:43:33.656
Used to say, "It's alright that the
vegetables grown are very good at Your
place and we take the vegetables as well,"

00:43:33.656 --> 00:43:37.086
but the special thing is that there
is peace at Your place.

00:43:37.826 --> 00:43:42.026
So the poor fellows used to come and
keep sitting on the stairs in the morning.

00:43:42.026 --> 00:43:46.350
When We woke up, they were sitting outside.
"O, why didn't you people take chairs?"

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:49.513
They said, "We forgot to take chairs
etc, we just came and sat down."

00:43:49.513 --> 00:43:52.545
Every morning while taking a walk
they would come and sit there.

00:43:52.899 --> 00:43:56.834
After that, they would uproot
vegetables and take them.

00:43:56.834 --> 00:44:08.269
You'll be surprised that in agriculture
too, in farming as well, there is so
much impact of this peace.

00:44:08.622 --> 00:44:13.882
After that, daily quarrels between
husband and wife in the house.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.830
Any movie you watch nowadays, you will
see a fight between husband and wife,

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.970
watch any television, a fight between
husband and wife.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:23.873
Especially abroad, there's nothing
apart from those disputes.

00:44:23.873 --> 00:44:26.841
There is no other drama, just a
fight between husband and wife.

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:38.160
But after Sahaja Yoga, such peace
comes within you that many homes
have been settled down.

00:44:38.546 --> 00:44:45.376
You know so many international marriages
take place in Sahaja Yoga - 50, 75, 80

00:44:45.376 --> 00:44:50.012
and hardly one or two of them are unsuccessful,
the rest are such pure marriages.

00:44:50.027 --> 00:44:55.067
Their children are so beautiful,
children of so pure conduct.

00:44:55.584 --> 00:45:04.314
And the children who were earlier so bad
at studies, used to talk about all sorts
of useless things and answer back,

00:45:04.316 --> 00:45:13.276
they too became so beautiful and calm.
The whole community of Sahaja Yoga is
so peaceful,

00:45:13.276 --> 00:45:22.065
so good, so ideal, that whoever sees
is amazed.

00:45:22.065 --> 00:45:25.647
Says, "I have never seen such a society.
What kind of world is this?"

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:32.400
I said this is that pure world and
this is the Khalistan we are creating,

00:45:32.599 --> 00:45:36.839
about which Nanak Saheb has said
that create Khalistan.

00:45:36.839 --> 00:45:41.352
First become pure, if you are not
pure, how will you create Khalistan?

00:45:42.229 --> 00:45:46.499
Pakistan was created - become
irreproachable(pure) then create
Pakistan.

00:45:46.792 --> 00:45:52.922
Created Pakistan without being pure -
what was the benefit of that?

00:45:52.922 --> 00:45:57.961
Doesn't happen by giving big-big
names. It is something that has
to happen from within.

00:45:57.978 --> 00:46:04.118
If the work is not done as per the
name you have kept, then should
think why it is not being done.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:08.220
Apart from fighting, who else
is doing what?

00:46:08.434 --> 00:46:14.804
Apart from fighting, criticizing
each other, dragging each other,
harassing each other,

00:46:15.018 --> 00:46:24.708
but in this how we should also
respect each other

00:46:25.136 --> 00:46:30.316
and should also think about
how to calm others.

00:46:30.598 --> 00:46:37.728
Sometimes I am greatly astonished that
very simple, ordinary people -

00:46:38.448 --> 00:46:45.698
a man was driving a bullock cart
in which I was sitting.

00:46:45.698 --> 00:46:51.032
He started talking, so I said,
'Kabir has come down, this is
Kabir speaking.'

00:46:51.166 --> 00:46:54.496
So I said, "What has happened to you,
where did you learn this from?"

00:46:54.496 --> 00:46:59.298
So started saying, "Mother, how
can I say this? This is my
Kundalini speaking."

00:46:59.405 --> 00:47:05.785
"I have not learnt anything."
An illiterate man, but he
reached from where to where.

00:47:05.785 --> 00:47:10.343
And see, all those who became
saints and sages, did they go
to any university,

00:47:10.343 --> 00:47:15.229
go to college, got a degree,
got some titles - nothing.

00:47:15.316 --> 00:47:20.206
Very simple, common people -
Mohammed Saheb did not know any book.

00:47:20.224 --> 00:47:25.804
How did he do such amazing things?
How did he do all this?

00:47:26.058 --> 00:47:33.818
Entered into the peace, that very
source of peace which opened.

00:47:34.688 --> 00:47:45.798
Have to embrace the power of this
peace. Still, it may be, that
sometimes peace is elusive.

00:47:45.798 --> 00:47:52.929
Still there is no peace within Sahaja
yogis, that still peace (UNCLEAR).

00:47:52.929 --> 00:48:00.774
But it is just that as if everything
you have, such a big asset, some property,
and you are sitting hungry.

00:48:04.687 --> 00:48:13.467
Luckily for once, try to earn
something, try to look within yourself.

00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:25.161
It seems as if everything has some
reason in life, then this very peace
starts flowing in a blissful manner.

00:48:25.966 --> 00:48:30.896
Hope today you people will get
your Kundalini awakened completely

00:48:31.781 --> 00:48:36.181
The thing is that some of you
have come here for the first
time today,

00:48:36.181 --> 00:48:40.412
and few old Sahaja Yogis are also
sitting here.

00:48:40.576 --> 00:48:46.516
There are many people to tell you
about Kundalini and books are there too.

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:52.733
You (should) see that, you should
understand what that Kundalini is.

00:48:53.204 --> 00:48:58.774
But by understanding It, knowing It,
reading It, there is only one test,

00:48:58.774 --> 00:49:05.430
that I am the one who should attain
this peace, how much peaceful have
I become within myself.

00:49:05.665 --> 00:49:12.545
When you will understand this and
do your investigation accordingly,
then you will see

00:49:12.586 --> 00:49:16.066
that in reality this is some
special thing.

00:49:16.066 --> 00:49:21.797
The fire inside me subsided, as if
some peace is sprinkled within me,

00:49:21.941 --> 00:49:27.361
and the moon which is the source of
that peace, there is no difference
in it.

00:49:27.361 --> 00:49:35.282
Seems as if the heat of the sun is over.
Everything at once became calm.

00:49:36.228 --> 00:49:43.378
My infinite blessings to all of you
and May you [UNCLEAR – All achieve?]
this peace today.

00:49:44.318 --> 00:49:51.158
If you all want to go out for a
while, then you may, for five minutes.

00:49:51.158 --> 00:49:56.898
After that we will do a Self-realization
program in which ten minutes.

00:49:56.898 --> 00:50:03.731
Being born in this land of Yoga,
one is born due to some great
former good deeds.

00:50:04.625 --> 00:50:12.525
And that's why the work of Self
realisation is done here very easily.

00:50:13.118 --> 00:50:27.898
A day will come when the whole
world will come to you to know
what this hidden/invisible power is,

00:50:28.229 --> 00:50:34.209
It has to be achieved from within,
and how to be one with it.

00:50:35.468 --> 00:50:46.128
I am grand, huge/enormous, I see it every day,
it is now in your hands, understand
your importance here,

00:50:46.271 --> 00:50:55.791
understand your greatness, understand
your responsibilities, and flourish
fully in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:56.917 --> 00:51:02.967
You are the one who made the whole
world (UNCLEAR - transparent?)

00:51:03.895 --> 00:51:16.675
Thus understand that the land on which
you are sitting, it's great principle,

00:51:18.057 --> 00:51:27.547
and the land nourished by the incarnations
of many sages and saints,

00:51:28.905 --> 00:51:46.415
which did many important works in
the name of dharma, that holy land
has today in reality that power,

00:51:46.569 --> 00:51:57.219
that it will give you Self-realisation
in a simple manner. No need to do
any hard work.

00:51:57.463 --> 00:52:02.643
People who are sitting on chairs
just need to take off their shoes

00:52:02.643 --> 00:52:10.804
And both the legs have to be kept
separately. The rest who are sitting
on the ground are fine.

00:52:14.146 --> 00:52:24.676
Now place both your hands towards
Me in this way as if you are
asking for something.

00:52:25.114 --> 00:52:33.774
With pure feelings, keep purity in
mind. Place both hands towards Me.

00:52:37.379 --> 00:52:46.889
Now extend your right hand towards
Me and bend your head and see your
(UNCLEAR - fontanel bone area?) with your hand,

00:52:48.298 --> 00:52:54.628
moving your hand a little away and
see whether you feel any cool breeze
coming from your head?

00:52:54.628 --> 00:52:57.293
Sometimes hot air also comes out.

00:53:01.844 --> 00:53:08.074
Pay attention, and see if cool
or hot air is coming?

00:53:11.536 --> 00:53:14.226
Don't doubt yourself.

00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:29.301
Forgetting that we are big, if
nothing else, we keep a big,

00:53:29.301 --> 00:53:33.864
or we are very bad or we have committed
these sins - forget all these things.

00:53:33.864 --> 00:53:39.385
Please forget this thing, there is no
such thing, because you are a human being

00:53:39.385 --> 00:53:43.525
And it is only human beings who make
mistakes. God will not make mistakes.

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:52.595
Now the second thing is that you
should forgive everyone all together.
Forgive everyone all together.

00:53:52.857 --> 00:53:56.517
Whether you forgive or don't
forgive you do nothing.

00:53:56.628 --> 00:54:01.258
But when you don't, you people
definitely trouble yourselves.

00:54:01.258 --> 00:54:07.248
Now look, you have forgiven everyone,
a cool breeze is coming. You fully....

00:54:07.248 --> 00:54:13.639
This is the Kundalini that has
pierced your Brahmarandhra,
pierced your fontanel bone area.

00:54:13.811 --> 00:54:20.121
The cool breeze which is blowing
from your head is the power of
peace I was talking about.

00:54:21.086 --> 00:54:28.556
Now put your left hand towards Me
and bend your head again

00:54:28.556 --> 00:54:32.751
Check with your right hand to see
if there is any coolness is coming
from your head or not?

00:54:33.173 --> 00:54:37.181
Is there any cool breeze coming
or not? Just see

00:54:39.155 --> 00:54:44.355
Some people get it till quite
a distance from their heads,
some get it close by

00:54:44.355 --> 00:54:49.069
But you don't have to touch
the head, just hold it above.

00:54:58.575 --> 00:55:03.415
There is total calmness inside;
peace has been established.

00:55:04.569 --> 00:55:13.319
Now put your right hand towards Me
and your left hand, bend your left
hand again above your head

00:55:13.319 --> 00:55:18.382
Bend your head, bend your head, bend
your head to that [UNCLEAR - SHRI?]

00:55:18.382 --> 00:55:25.708
And now look. Is the cool breeze
coming or not? I am getting a
cool breeze from you people.

00:55:31.283 --> 00:55:36.543
Don't consider yourself guilty in
any way. Don't put yourself down.

00:55:36.594 --> 00:55:39.844
Now you are going to the
kingdom of God,

00:55:39.992 --> 00:55:51.212
so you have to reach there joyfully,
happily, slowly, respectfully.

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:58.008
He is the ocean of peace,
He is the lake of peace.

00:55:58.008 --> 00:56:04.458
He will come along within
you like a lotus flower.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:19.520
Now raise both your hands towards
the sky and look at Me without
any thoughts.

00:56:19.866 --> 00:56:30.866
There is no need to think and with
your head tilted back, ask a question
three times in your mind,

00:56:32.053 --> 00:56:44.053
“Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya?
Mother, is this the same power of peace?”

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:56.170
“Mother, is this,” one may also
ask that, “Shri Mataji, is this the
All-Pervading Power of God’s love?”

00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:04.380
"Is this the Spiritual power?" Whatever
you want ask the question three times
with your head raised up.

00:57:07.398 --> 00:57:18.768
There is a strong wind blowing.
Put your hands down. Put these
down one by one.

00:57:18.769 --> 00:57:26.919
Oh Baba! This is not Ghaziabad,
this has become Shanti Bagh.

00:57:29.679 --> 00:57:34.329
All of you have got your realization.
Most of the people have got their
realization.

00:57:37.337 --> 00:57:40.127
My greetings to all of you!
