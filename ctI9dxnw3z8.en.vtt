00:00:00.023 --> 00:00:04.237
it was only because they loved their country.

00:00:04.943 --> 00:00:08.183
Your country is spirituality.

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:19.540
It is the country of complete enjoyment of yourself.

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:25.373
It's the country where nothing but peace prevails.

00:00:25.613 --> 00:00:33.111
And, when you love that country, how can you have all these nonsensical ideas

00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:40.826
 for money and for power and all that? I just can't understand.

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:51.840
I, as it is you know very well, that I'm not bothered about these things at all in my life.

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:58.969
Of course, we need money for work, for everything.

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:05.482
But there's no need to run after it or hanker after it.

00:01:06.268 --> 00:01:10.204
I am surprised even after so many years of My hard work,

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:17.663
 there are some people still working out some stupid stuffs

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.437
which I can't understand. And, they should know they'll be exposed in no time.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.920
 This is the year of exposure I told last time. Absolutely!

00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:39.103
If you have no love for Sahaja Yoga,
if you have no love for your Mother,

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.380
you will run after those nonsensical things

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:47.844
and make some mess out of yourself.
If you want to destroy yourself,

00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:52.506
you can go to some other fields, but not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:59.551
In Sahaja Yoga, you have to know you have to be really dedicated and honest.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.631
 You should enjoy your honesty, you should enjoy your love,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.705
you should enjoy your generosity, everything.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.609
You will be exposed, no doubt. But then where will you go?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.799
What will be your position?

00:02:17.185 --> 00:02:24.580
 If you are doing all those things,
you have to go the way people have gone to hell, I should say.

00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:28.421
 Because after coming to the paradise of love,

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:32.048
 if you are still bothered about these nonsensical things,

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.060
then you will jump very fast into the hell. I can see that clearly.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.941
I shouldn't say this on My birthday, but this is the year of exposure.

00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:46.610
And be very careful!

00:02:47.031 --> 00:02:51.719
Nobody will be spared this year. What to do? Though it's My birthday,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.357
I have to tell you, it won't keep quiet.

00:02:57.827 --> 00:03:00.937
You know there are certain powers which flow.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:09.294
And different, different years I find a different type of powers start flowing,

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:15.903
 and this is the time when power for exposure is going to be there.

00:03:16.778 --> 00:03:24.182
 Whether you are a leader or if you are not, if you are making anything dishonest,

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:29.768
you will be exposed and you will be rightly punished.

00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:33.006
Sahaja Yoga may not punish you,

00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:38.774
but there are so many ways that this power works out.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.008
The first thing is what we call "alakshmi."

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.393
Alakshmi means at that time when you are punished,

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:56.320
you will be surprised, you will just become bankrupt. You will have no money.

00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:59.870
You will be exposed. You may be in jail.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:06.688
So, though it's a very auspicious day, I must tell you not to be inauspicious.

00:04:07.498 --> 00:04:11.867
Yesterday's lecture I explained to you: know what your powers are -

00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:20.057
 what you can enjoy, what you can give, what can work out.

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:25.453
But firstly, you must know are you capable of doing that

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:30.321
 or you are just working it out in the other way around.

00:04:30.652 --> 00:04:40.286
 I was amazed to hear that after so many years also people have not given up this kind of a

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:45.760
temptations that they have and they had.

00:04:48.525 --> 00:04:55.849
On Birthday, you must remember how many years you have spent doing Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:57.137 --> 00:05:02.080
You must understand all the nice time you had

00:05:02.152 --> 00:05:08.461
and how many every year you have spent in enjoying My Birthday -

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.170
 also, in understanding how you have grown into it, how you changed it, and

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:23.732
how you enjoyed and how you have imbibed all the qualities of Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:34.220
First and foremost quality of a Sahaja Yogi, that he has to be absolutely honest.

00:05:35.052 --> 00:05:40.118
He has not come here to make money. Not money!

00:05:40.397 --> 00:05:44.059
He has not come here to make a power.

00:05:44.374 --> 00:05:52.653
But he has come to rise into the new beautiful world that we are creating.

00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:55.613
 We have to create this world for the

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:03.164
whole world, for people who live all over, who are even in the jungles,

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:10.958
who are lost into Himalayas, anywhere

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:16.868
we have to spread this beautiful sensation,

00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:24.824
 or beautiful existence of self-respect and dignity.

00:06:26.438 --> 00:06:32.651
Very important is to see if you are really the self.

00:06:32.884 --> 00:06:36.011
Are you respecting yourself?

00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:40.136
Yesterday only you said "Know Thyself."

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:44.890
If that is the case, do you respect yourself?

00:06:45.395 --> 00:06:49.304
Very important is first to respect yourself.

00:06:49.757 --> 00:06:52.188
If you don't know how to respect yourself

00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:57.121
and you run after useless things, then what should we say?

00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:03.580
What is the quality that you have imbibed in Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:08.484
 except that you have started a business or something like that?

00:07:09.275 --> 00:07:22.160
 It is very sad but there are people
who are still ruined in the mud of all these things.

00:07:23.594 --> 00:07:26.433
You have overcome so many things I know,

00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:31.473
you have achieved so many things I know which is not possible.

00:07:31.774 --> 00:07:38.163
 Humanly impossible things you have done - you have got over all this nonsense.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.005
 But still there are some people among you

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:48.187
who still are in the stinking mud of nonsense.

00:07:51.727 --> 00:07:59.384
It is nice that you are celebrating My Birthday
with such enthusiasm and such happiness.

00:07:59.662 --> 00:08:02.247
So nice to see all this.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.030
And, I want you all to be My decorations.

00:08:07.276 --> 00:08:11.381
In the whole world they should see that you are My children,

00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:17.275
 and that you are of such great values and such great understanding.

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:22.823
You are My children.

00:08:23.688 --> 00:08:32.282
I have really worked for you in the sense every minute, moment of My life.

00:08:32.647 --> 00:08:39.705
 I have thought of you. I wanted to work it out in such a beautiful manner

00:08:39.871 --> 00:08:49.358
 that you become really good people, ideal people, special people with understanding.

00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:57.116
So, that is the day you should feel that your birthday is being celebrated.

00:08:58.062 --> 00:09:03.365
When you are completely cleared out, you have become Nirmal,

00:09:03.955 --> 00:09:12.389
absolutely pure personality of love,
that's the day is your birthday and Mine too.

00:09:13.749 --> 00:09:15.842
I have to tell about these things

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.549
because some things have come to My notice and I am really shocked

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:27.056
 the way some people are still not understanding their value,
not understanding their worth.

00:09:27.123 --> 00:09:35.246
 And, that's what other day I told you that you must know about yourself.

00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:39.466
First of all, the self is the spirit.

00:09:40.165 --> 00:09:43.573
 It's the spirit the reflection of God Almighty.

00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:47.851
If you want to live like all other ordinary nonsensical people,

00:09:47.931 --> 00:09:50.359
you should stay out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:51.033 --> 00:09:58.687
But if you think that you have to really show your worth coming into Sahaja Yoga

00:09:58.789 --> 00:10:02.517
 and if you have to feel proud of yourself,

00:10:02.645 --> 00:10:09.689
then try to understand that in Sahaja Yoga
you don't have to have all these weaknesses.

00:10:10.546 --> 00:10:18.757
 When the Kundalini rises, she passes through
the six chakras by enlightening them.

00:10:19.582 --> 00:10:26.183
 I may tolerate you up to a point but the Kundalini

00:10:27.048 --> 00:10:30.704
will punish you. She will do what is needed to correct you.

00:10:30.824 --> 00:10:33.339
 Up to a point, She will do.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:42.278
And, afterwards, when She finds it is not possible to correct you,

00:10:42.651 --> 00:10:47.705
then I don't know what will happen and how it will work out.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.665
Sahaja Yoga is very easy to come in, to move in and to work it out.

00:10:54.834 --> 00:10:58.194
But you go against yourself.

00:10:58.504 --> 00:11:04.250
 If you try to behave like very ordinary, useless people

00:11:04.422 --> 00:11:09.602
then you cannot stay in Sahaja Yoga.  You'll be thrown out.

00:11:09.916 --> 00:11:14.284
 As soon as you are thrown out, where will you land,

00:11:14.377 --> 00:11:18.575
 what will happen that you know very well.

00:11:22.418 --> 00:11:28.543
On this auspicious day, I have to request you to be auspicious.

00:11:29.099 --> 00:11:32.869
Not to do anything that is inauspicious.

00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:39.132
They call it protocol. But there are small, small things

00:11:39.521 --> 00:11:42.814
which shows you are auspicious.

00:11:43.013 --> 00:11:47.842
Very, very minute subtle things that shows

00:11:47.914 --> 00:11:51.787
you're auspicious, which you don't have to learn.

00:11:52.262 --> 00:12:00.987
 Automatically, spontaneously it comes and you enjoy your auspiciousness

00:12:01.711 --> 00:12:07.807
because you are holy, because you are Nirmal

00:12:08.037 --> 00:12:12.777
 and you enjoy that quality within you.

00:12:13.446 --> 00:12:17.696
And, when that happens, that is your birthday.

00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:23.102
You were reborn as you know. All of you were reborn.

00:12:23.253 --> 00:12:28.448
You were reborn but still you were children and now you have grown up.

00:12:28.837 --> 00:12:34.970
 That growth has to be shown in every way.

00:12:35.114 --> 00:12:43.005
When a person grows, then he goes all out to do various things,

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:49.208
to express himself. In the same way, when you are grown up,

00:12:49.632 --> 00:12:55.262
 then you have to show that you are grown up in Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:55.381 --> 00:13:01.101
 that you are very deep and you are very senior person.

00:13:01.329 --> 00:13:03.979
I have seen some little children also.

00:13:04.131 --> 00:13:10.039
They are so grown up and so sensible that sometimes I am amazed.

00:13:10.145 --> 00:13:12.744
 They are great saints reborn.

00:13:13.401 --> 00:13:16.373
 They are great people who are reborn.

00:13:16.476 --> 00:13:21.147
But if you are still running after nonsensical things,

00:13:21.282 --> 00:13:25.510
 if you are still full of lust and greed,

00:13:26.018 --> 00:13:29.110
then better you leave Sahaja Yoga up to itself

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:34.518
 and you can find some other area where you can do that.

00:13:35.588 --> 00:13:44.978
It is something surprising how people do not understand
 their position in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:48.058 --> 00:13:53.371
Your growth has been on the whole very good.

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:58.305
I know there are many people who are wonderful Sahaja Yogis,

00:13:58.432 --> 00:14:05.135
 who are really great Sahaja Yogis and they have every right to call themselves

00:14:05.358 --> 00:14:08.277
Sahaja Yogis or Mahayogis.

00:14:09.222 --> 00:14:13.263
But that is only possible and perceptible

00:14:13.581 --> 00:14:21.411
if you really grow up inside

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:30.217
and your spirit shines like crystal clear ocean of love.

00:14:38.038 --> 00:14:41.104
Now, the connection has been done.

00:14:41.645 --> 00:14:45.091
You have the knowledge of all the chakras.

00:14:45.443 --> 00:14:49.153
You know how to raise Kundalini.

00:14:49.567 --> 00:14:54.384
You know also how to cure people and how to treat people.

00:14:55.317 --> 00:15:03.437
With all that knowledge, with all that life you have got,

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:12.294
it's like the milk you give to your energies

00:15:12.667 --> 00:15:17.014
and then you have to become energetic.

00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:20.861
You cannot be lethargic about it.

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:26.555
When you are lethargic, then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:33.429
You have to be moving with this flame in your heart

00:15:33.648 --> 00:15:42.295
that you know what is self is and you know what you have to do for others.

00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:48.287
Must be, you must have been also great seekers in previous lives,

00:15:48.645 --> 00:15:55.038
 and that seeking that was there has brought you to Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:56.006 --> 00:16:01.821
 Now, with that seeking when you are here,
 still you are seeking all these useless things.

00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:04.813
They cannot grow, you cannot grow.

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:09.310
And such people cannot make others also grow.

00:16:11.477 --> 00:16:14.955
So, the main thing one has to understand,

00:16:15.211 --> 00:16:19.074
how you have grown in your love.

00:16:19.265 --> 00:16:26.625
You see, a person who is frightful, who is very strict,

00:16:27.163 --> 00:16:33.640
who talks very rudely, is not a Sahaja Yogi, no way.

00:16:34.008 --> 00:16:41.229
But the one who looks after, cares, loves

00:16:41.524 --> 00:16:46.934
and is very generous, is the real Sahaja Yogi.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.208
 You are people of special qualities

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:55.440
 and those qualities must be shown in your life.

00:16:56.027 --> 00:17:02.167
I know you love Me very much. And you know what you have done to celebrate My birthday.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.139
As you have so many of these decorations,

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.524
I have already told you that you are My decorations.

00:17:12.056 --> 00:17:14.895
And, your lives are My decorations,

00:17:15.316 --> 00:17:22.590
and the way you behave and the way you know yourself

00:17:22.997 --> 00:17:29.997
- things will be so much appreciated all over the world.

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:37.686
It is not for any other purpose but only to remember

00:17:38.002 --> 00:17:41.505
 that you all have to grow.

00:17:41.918 --> 00:17:48.140
 You have to become very, very deep personalities.

00:17:48.394 --> 00:17:55.816
You have to grow within yourself celebrating your own birthday.

00:17:55.968 --> 00:18:01.688
Everyday try to see, what is your experience?

00:18:02.075 --> 00:18:07.488
What did you see? Whom did you meet? How did they talk?

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.811
 I mean I know so many names.

00:18:11.002 --> 00:18:13.438
Practically, everybody's name I know.

00:18:13.622 --> 00:18:16.673
Practically, everybody's Kundalini I know.

00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:22.872
 I also know whose Kundalini is all right, whose is not. I know so many people.

00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:27.437
So many ask Me, "How do You know so many names and how do You remember that?"

00:18:27.612 --> 00:18:34.548
I say, "I don't know that part", but it is that whenever I see a person,

00:18:34.644 --> 00:18:40.990
I see his Kundalini and from that Kundalini I know who he is.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:45.090
 There can be thousands and thousands of Kundalinis,

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:51.446
but I know who is who because I love them.

00:18:51.648 --> 00:18:56.024
If you love somebody, then you know what he is.

00:18:56.151 --> 00:19:00.386
It's not stupid love, as they call it romance and all that.

00:19:00.537 --> 00:19:03.334
 It's very deep feeling.

00:19:03.652 --> 00:19:08.608
When you enter like into the garden of your heart

00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:13.511
and you feel the beautiful fragrance all around -

00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:20.168
when you think of such nice people as there have been as saints,

00:19:20.354 --> 00:19:25.038
 great saviors and now the Sahaja Yogis -

00:19:25.369 --> 00:19:37.671
you feel so much grateful that you have achieved
that state of collective enjoyment.

00:19:38.671 --> 00:19:43.637
I have never put any restrictions on you. Do what you like,

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.357
whatever way you want to do it, you can do it. I have never been bothering

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:55.537
you about money or anything. But that is a testing ground.

00:19:56.124 --> 00:20:01.187
 That is the testing ground where you are standing.

00:20:01.593 --> 00:20:06.939
If you do not test yourself, how will you know how far you have come?

00:20:07.202 --> 00:20:13.775
So, you are the student, you are the examiner,

00:20:13.986 --> 00:20:18.335
 and you are the one who has to give yourself certificate.

00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:25.277
And, in that case what happens is that you start understanding,

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:31.202
 understanding so many things which you have never understood.

00:20:32.768 --> 00:20:36.847
I mean, the knowledge, so called knowledge,

00:20:36.998 --> 00:20:41.691
 is no knowledge because it's all falsehood, it's all mental.

00:20:41.921 --> 00:20:48.434
But the real absolute knowledge dawns upon you about everyone,

00:20:48.736 --> 00:20:59.256
 about every aspect, about every surrounding
that you have, so clearly you know.

00:20:59.905 --> 00:21:08.114
 And, that should happen that you should know very clearly -

00:21:08.415 --> 00:21:16.155
 very, very clearly - what is the situation with you,

00:21:16.448 --> 00:21:21.018
 where are you and what are you doing.

00:21:21.436 --> 00:21:27.717
Not that you have any less powers. You have all the powers,

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.396
but for that you have to go deep down.

00:21:31.508 --> 00:21:36.377
Like there's a well, the well has water in it,

00:21:36.494 --> 00:21:43.494
but if your bucket doesn't go down, how can it bring the water?

00:21:43.972 --> 00:21:52.319
If your bucket is filled with stones, what's the use of that well to you?

00:21:52.633 --> 00:21:59.017
 In the same way, we have everything within us, as I told you yesterday,

00:21:59.399 --> 00:22:07.875
and Sahaja Yoga is the way you can go down and find about yourself

00:22:08.027 --> 00:22:14.810
which is so beautiful, clean - and that's the thing to be enjoyed.

00:22:14.977 --> 00:22:19.564
 Not other nonsensical things after which you are running,

00:22:19.699 --> 00:22:22.354
 which you think is important.

00:22:22.488 --> 00:22:28.457
I have already told you: it is "Shudh Ichchaa" is the Kundalini - Shudh Ichchaa,

00:22:28.668 --> 00:22:34.160
pure desire because other desires are never fulfilled.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:40.191
You try to buy one thing, then you don't enjoy.

00:22:40.322 --> 00:22:45.107
You want to buy another one, you don't enjoy.
You want to buy another one, you don't enjoy.

00:22:45.202 --> 00:22:48.574
So, because it's not the real desire.

00:22:48.678 --> 00:22:53.574
This is the principle of economics that you are never satisfied.

00:22:53.741 --> 00:22:57.081
You go on buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying.

00:22:57.222 --> 00:23:00.316
And you buy so many things ultimately

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.467
what happens is that all the industries collapse.

00:23:04.966 --> 00:23:08.011
That's what is happening in America.

00:23:08.242 --> 00:23:18.440
It has a quality that whatever you do repels back on you.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.131
Only the spiritual growth does not repel.

00:23:24.798 --> 00:23:29.590
 It flowers, it's fragrant, it's beautiful -

00:23:29.693 --> 00:23:33.943
such a beautiful experience to be with yourself,

00:23:34.181 --> 00:23:40.719
as if you have entered into the beautiful garden of paradise.

00:23:42.409 --> 00:23:47.586
 If that feeling if you want to have, give up all nonsensical ideas.

00:23:47.824 --> 00:23:50.112
Give up all worldly nonsense.

00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:56.482
 Everything you give up, and then you will feel that you are now

00:23:56.633 --> 00:24:01.479
very much there where you should have been.

00:24:02.309 --> 00:24:07.273
 You will have no doubts. You will have no hankerings.

00:24:07.591 --> 00:24:11.704
You will not feel at all in any way dissatisfied.

00:24:12.304 --> 00:24:21.618
 But some people are still at a very elementary stage, I know.

00:24:22.351 --> 00:24:28.780
I know I have not told them because
I know this is the year they'll be all exposed. No doubt!

00:24:30.661 --> 00:24:39.420
Then, what is the use of doing something  in which you will be exposed

00:24:39.745 --> 00:24:46.959
and that the whole world of Sahaja Yoga  will look at you as a criminal?

00:24:47.255 --> 00:24:52.737
 Or as person who doesn't need any respect whatsoever.

00:24:54.539 --> 00:25:03.546
Either you get out of it - and if you are here to gain lots of

00:25:06.714 --> 00:25:17.140
 ascending steps, you have to have your eyes upward and not downward.

00:25:17.358 --> 00:25:20.342
 You must see what steps there are.

00:25:20.581 --> 00:25:26.119
You have to climb up those steps. With these steps where do you enter? I tell you,

00:25:26.234 --> 00:25:35.564
 in that beautiful garden - fragrant, garden of yourself,  which is so beautiful.

00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:39.665
Instead of that, you are lost in the maya

00:25:39.881 --> 00:25:46.474
 of the world as so many are lost. So, why have you come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.166
Give up those nonsensical ideas.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:57.013
Try to take to spirituality. Pure spirituality.

00:25:57.494 --> 00:26:03.390
"Purity" is the world. Purity you must have.

00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:13.019
And, purity within is you can easily, easily establish with Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:22.447
 Your witness state has to improve.
Witness state has to be projected so much

00:26:22.772 --> 00:26:30.017
 that this conditioning and ego of reaction will finish up.

00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:34.747
You will have no more reactions, but you will just witness.

00:26:34.898 --> 00:26:42.086
And, the knowledge that is real comes always,  to always through witnessing.

00:26:42.902 --> 00:26:47.715
If you do not know howwitness, then whatever knowledge you have is nothing

00:26:47.818 --> 00:26:54.781
 but through your ego or through your, you can say, conditionings.

00:26:55.102 --> 00:26:57.267
 It's not absolute knowledge.

00:26:57.854 --> 00:27:01.761
So, to get the absolute knowledge about anything,

00:27:01.872 --> 00:27:06.732
what you have to do is to reach the point of absoluteness -

00:27:07.239 --> 00:27:17.116
 to reach the point where you are absolutely clean, pure, Nirmal.

00:27:18.416 --> 00:27:22.695
Now, don't condemn yourself if you have some defects.

00:27:23.132 --> 00:27:25.878
There has to be. You are all human beings.

00:27:26.032 --> 00:27:35.777
But all this defects with your power of spirituality you can absolutely overcome.

00:27:36.509 --> 00:27:39.258
For that, what have you to do?

00:27:39.455 --> 00:27:44.806
First is introspection. First is trying to find out.

00:27:45.084 --> 00:27:47.644
You separate yourself with yourself

00:27:47.804 --> 00:27:52.957
and say, "Hello Mister, how are you?" Start with that.

00:27:53.557 --> 00:27:56.777
"Hello, what are you up to?"

00:27:57.374 --> 00:28:01.388
And, you start seeing yourself outside

00:28:02.246 --> 00:28:09.653
and eradicating, removing all that is not yourself.

00:28:10.394 --> 00:28:17.394
That knowledge of self comes to you when you want the knowledge.

00:28:18.601 --> 00:28:23.272
 It should be pure desire to know about the self.

00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:31.243
 You are special people, no doubt.
You are all chosen to be very, very special, no doubt.

00:28:31.362 --> 00:28:36.427
 There must be something about you that you have come to this state

00:28:36.486 --> 00:28:42.781
where you are trying to become the self.

00:28:43.535 --> 00:28:47.696
Self is absolutely self-satisfied.

00:28:48.907 --> 00:28:52.047
It does not need anything to satisfy itself.

00:28:52.206 --> 00:28:55.745
Actually, it is satisfaction personified.

00:28:56.343 --> 00:29:05.509
 It just sees things, it just watches things, it just witnesses.

00:29:05.735 --> 00:29:13.044
 And while witnessing anything, it knows. It knows.

00:29:13.409 --> 00:29:17.517
 You don't have to tell: this is this or this is what.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.430
You don't have to express too much anything.

00:29:20.571 --> 00:29:28.264
 It's just self expressive if, if you are a clean person,

00:29:28.905 --> 00:29:35.725
your desires are clean and that you just have pure desire to ascend.

00:29:36.282 --> 00:29:40.526
So, again I have to talk about Kundalini that you must have

00:29:40.654 --> 00:29:48.833
 a Kundalini completely establishing itself within you.

00:29:50.425 --> 00:29:54.576
 Completely expressing within you.

00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:59.921
Completely enlightening, enlightening your self.

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:08.382
Such a Kundalini should be there,
and only possible if you do not put hurdles in her growth.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:14.015
 If you allow it to grow, it grows and it works out.

00:30:15.268 --> 00:30:19.746
As you know, I have started this work only in 1970.

00:30:20.016 --> 00:30:23.537
Not because I could not start it earlier,

00:30:23.918 --> 00:30:28.890
not because there were all bad people in this world,

00:30:29.074 --> 00:30:40.227
but because I was waiting Myself to be deft in dealing with all kinds of Kundalinis.

00:30:40.887 --> 00:30:46.989
 I had to work out all the permutations and combinations that were there.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:55.114
And, then I just thought if I could get hold of a way by which

00:30:55.407 --> 00:31:00.857
 all these combinations can be worked out in one line,

00:31:01.466 --> 00:31:06.434
then only Kundalini will rise. And it worked, it happened

00:31:06.807 --> 00:31:12.982
 with a sincere desire! Because I felt very sad about people

00:31:13.501 --> 00:31:19.402
who are spending their lives in something very nonsensical.

00:31:19.522 --> 00:31:24.891
They cannot enjoy anything, they have no genuine feeling for anything,

00:31:25.042 --> 00:31:31.368
 they have no genuine love for anything, and they are not even loved.

00:31:31.646 --> 00:31:36.849
 They cannot love, they are not loved and they are in misery.

00:31:38.143 --> 00:31:45.762
So, it was very deliberate action on My part, I should say,

00:31:45.985 --> 00:31:48.815
 that I watched human beings very carefully.

00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:53.710
 Why they do it like this? Why they behave like this?

00:31:53.853 --> 00:31:57.739
Why are they not understanding? Why are they harsh?

00:31:58.035 --> 00:32:03.481
 Why they shout? Why they beat? Why they do all these things?

00:32:04.411 --> 00:32:07.075
 Because of imbalances within.

00:32:08.107 --> 00:32:12.921
 But with introspection if you start seeing those imbalances,

00:32:13.041 --> 00:32:19.188
 you now know how to cure yourself and you can really work it out.

00:32:19.307 --> 00:32:22.536
You have to just work on your chakras.

00:32:22.926 --> 00:32:26.872
See which chakra is catching, where is the problem.

00:32:27.276 --> 00:32:36.546
 You have to respect yourself in such a way that
you become your own doctor.

00:32:36.917 --> 00:32:40.170
And, you know everything about yourself.

00:32:40.287 --> 00:32:44.778
"Ah, this is wrong with me. Why am I catching?
Why am I catching on that chakra?

00:32:44.961 --> 00:32:50.021
 Why this is happening?" This is the education you have to give it to yourself,

00:32:50.069 --> 00:32:57.069
which will be only possible if you experience all those catches.

00:32:58.018 --> 00:33:03.418
It is for you to grow now. Grow into great people,

00:33:03.633 --> 00:33:13.410
 great personalities, very tremendous people
who have made history, who are respected.

00:33:13.966 --> 00:33:21.720
 All those great saints and all that also were of great caliber

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:27.141
 but they didn't know how to raise the kundalini, which you know.

00:33:27.462 --> 00:33:32.586
You have something special knowledge how to raise the Kundalini,

00:33:32.784 --> 00:33:41.999
how to judge the Kundalini, how to understand where is the problem.

00:33:42.569 --> 00:33:50.125
 And, also you know how to tell that person about

00:33:51.157 --> 00:33:55.694
his problems, very beautifully with love.

00:33:55.908 --> 00:34:03.956
So, the message of your spirit is that you should love each other.

00:34:05.764 --> 00:34:09.801
 If you do not love someone then what's the matter?

00:34:10.118 --> 00:34:16.839
 Why don't you love?
What is the bad thing about a particular person?

00:34:17.397 --> 00:34:23.003
 If he is a Sahaja Yogi and a great Sahaja Yogi, is it out of jealousy?

00:34:23.258 --> 00:34:29.925
 Is it out of greed or is it out lust still you are like that?

00:34:30.251 --> 00:34:42.709
Then the oneness in the whole world of brotherhood is something to be really enjoyed.

00:34:43.117 --> 00:34:46.566
 Enjoyed so beautifully.

00:34:47.014 --> 00:34:49.659
See all these things you have here.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:58.325
There is so much harmony among them.
So much of harmony because it is done with love!

00:34:58.799 --> 00:35:02.989
 If you do anything with love, it's very harmonious.

00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:07.201
 It creates such harmony among people.

00:35:07.517 --> 00:35:16.184
You see, the enjoyment of each other's company, the enjoyment of each other's achievements

00:35:16.838 --> 00:35:26.901
is so much joy giving that I cannot describe it in words. It's impossible.

00:35:27.059 --> 00:35:32.617
Words cannot communicate to you that feeling that you have.

00:35:32.757 --> 00:35:38.175
As I told you, you feel as if you are in the Garden of Eden.

00:35:39.778 --> 00:35:46.980
That sort of a feeling should come into you when you, your self, you know.

00:35:47.267 --> 00:35:54.115
 Because when you know your self, actually you know your own being

00:35:54.211 --> 00:36:02.043
 and you are so happy that your self is so beautiful.

00:36:02.532 --> 00:36:10.844
 That you are so beautiful, that you are so joyous, that you have all these things -

00:36:11.458 --> 00:36:20.695
to know that within you is really, really very much fragrant with enjoyment.

00:36:21.419 --> 00:36:27.459
That state you must have. I see sometimes when you are overjoyed you dance and sing

00:36:27.799 --> 00:36:31.092
and do...that's something really very good.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:36.251
But all the time your spirit should dance at smallest things,

00:36:37.963 --> 00:36:44.412
 at the little thing that is made, say, something artistic you see,

00:36:44.707 --> 00:36:54.405
something you see a gesture of kindness, a gesture of gratitude.

00:36:54.816 --> 00:37:04.313
You feel that depth of that feeling.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:11.095
For example, today I saw the flag. Independence

00:37:11.426 --> 00:37:14.455
when we got, we made this flag.

00:37:14.648 --> 00:37:22.240
 I had seen this flag been brought down
and put up when the other flag was brought down.

00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:27.047
 I cannot tell you what was the feeling that moment.

00:37:27.697 --> 00:37:35.261
Such a feeling that the truth has somehow or other overcome the untruth.

00:37:35.554 --> 00:37:40.544
 The justice has been shown over the injustice.

00:37:40.928 --> 00:37:45.973
That feeling is still so much, I can't even see the flag.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.468
 If I see it, I remember the whole history,

00:37:49.696 --> 00:37:55.164
the whole thing - how many people sacrificed,
how many martyrs there were,

00:37:55.316 --> 00:38:00.946
and how much people have fought for it. That flag stands for that.

00:38:01.915 --> 00:38:08.915
And, you stand for all that. You stand for all those ideals.

00:38:09.791 --> 00:38:13.103
You stand for all those sacrifices.

00:38:13.365 --> 00:38:21.460
 And, you stand for all that is to be achieved for bettering human beings.

00:38:21.834 --> 00:38:27.785
You have to achieve a great deal for others.

00:38:28.111 --> 00:38:34.911
You have to work within yourself what you can do for others,

00:38:35.451 --> 00:38:42.615
 what you can achieve for others, what is the best way to imbibe

00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:49.787
those qualities within you that you become a absolutely unique personality.

00:38:50.487 --> 00:38:53.650
As I told you, there have been many great leaders

00:38:53.745 --> 00:38:59.737
and many great people who are remembered by many people.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.577
 Now, what you should see what made them so great?

00:39:05.265 --> 00:39:09.328
Why so many years people still remember?

00:39:09.811 --> 00:39:13.417
 I have given you the statue of Shivaji Maharaj.

00:39:13.576 --> 00:39:21.692
Now, he was another soul, a great soul who had such principles,

00:39:22.023 --> 00:39:29.912
 and such beautifying life in his language, in his attitude and everything.

00:39:30.238 --> 00:39:33.412
 With all that, he was a very brave person.

00:39:34.127 --> 00:39:41.127
Once you have this, you will not deter from doing anything that is important.

00:39:41.755 --> 00:39:44.452
 You will have no fear of anything.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:51.980
You will not go round and round but you will know
how to find the solution and how to work it out.

00:39:53.096 --> 00:39:59.616
 This will happen to you if you really know yourself,

00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:06.233
you will have such powers of courage.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:10.477
 You will not be dare devil, but with wisdom.

00:40:10.845 --> 00:40:14.082
 Courage with wisdom you will have.

00:40:14.965 --> 00:40:23.014
 And, that is what is your self
which will give you lots of wisdom and lots of courage.

00:40:25.026 --> 00:40:31.698
 It's not a fighting spirit, it's not a violent nature, it's not rude nature,

00:40:31.831 --> 00:40:37.563
but it's a very silent beautiful, courageous attitude.

00:40:37.891 --> 00:40:41.862
There is a story about one Chinese saint.

00:40:47.417 --> 00:40:54.699
That when this Chinese saint was asked by one king

00:40:55.881 --> 00:41:03.151
 that he should teach how to fight to his cocks.
They were having cock fights.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:12.290
The Chinese saint said, "All right, bring your cock here.
I will teach you how to fight."

00:41:13.744 --> 00:41:22.577
And, the Chinese saint must have put some wisdom
 into the head of a cock. Can you imagine?

00:41:23.476 --> 00:41:32.254
And, when they took them for that fight,
 what they found that cock was just standing.

00:41:32.799 --> 00:41:38.270
 It would not attack, it would not retreat, it would just stand.

00:41:38.651 --> 00:41:44.578
And, all the cocks ran away from the field

00:41:45.538 --> 00:41:54.349
because in that standing was the power of wisdom and power of courage.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:42:01.461
Courage is silently very powerful.

00:42:03.383 --> 00:42:07.284
You don't have to bomb anybody, don't have to kill anybody,

00:42:07.627 --> 00:42:10.750
but you have to stand up with courage.

00:42:10.853 --> 00:42:19.410
And, that is the another quality which will express,
which is very polite, very sweet.

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:24.360
 You will be standing with that courage.

00:42:25.083 --> 00:42:28.146
I know so many of you are like that.

00:42:28.613 --> 00:42:35.796
 There's no struggle, there's no fight, just standing with courage

00:42:36.429 --> 00:42:39.424
and doing whatever is right.

00:42:39.631 --> 00:42:47.230
And, that is quite possible because you have
now the connection with the Almighty.

00:42:47.713 --> 00:42:51.271
 You have the connection with the Paramachaitanya

00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:54.819
and that will work it out, everything.

00:42:55.011 --> 00:43:05.096
I'll be very, very happy to say that today
 I'm seeing so many of you are such good Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:12.772
 So many of them! And, if you find anyone who is not, please report it to Me.

00:43:13.513 --> 00:43:15.298
Please tell Me.

00:43:15.784 --> 00:43:21.577
 Please find out if there is anyone who is trying to be very oppressive

00:43:21.731 --> 00:43:25.931
and who is trying to control everything, who is trying to make money,

00:43:26.008 --> 00:43:29.436
who is trying to have lust and greed being expressed.

00:43:29.733 --> 00:43:38.626
So, once you have really worked out you should know

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:47.562
this is the area what we call is Dharmayudha.

00:43:49.015 --> 00:43:55.065
Dharmayudha means the war of religion,

00:43:55.415 --> 00:43:58.406
but not the way people are fighting it.

00:43:58.924 --> 00:44:04.067
Our dharmayudha is that we are standing on dharma,

00:44:04.218 --> 00:44:10.628
and dharma means not religion but it is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:44:11.408 --> 00:44:19.905
We are standing on our religion and there's a negativity, we can call it adharma,

00:44:20.808 --> 00:44:25.384
which is fighting so you stand on your dharma.

00:44:25.615 --> 00:44:35.595
Unless and until you are dharmic you cannot have any achievement in Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:43.158
I have seen people who are say, abroad,

00:44:43.387 --> 00:44:46.825
 they have funny ideas and they will come and tell me,

00:44:46.948 --> 00:44:51.493
"Mother, see, I have a wife but I'm in love with another woman.

00:44:51.674 --> 00:44:53.170
So, what should I do?"

00:44:53.353 --> 00:44:58.051
I said, "You get out. That's all. Just get out."

00:44:58.463 --> 00:45:01.162
Or he may say, the wife might say

00:45:01.241 --> 00:45:05.313
that, "Mother, see, I'm having relations with another man.

00:45:05.448 --> 00:45:07.269
And, what should I do?"

00:45:07.495 --> 00:45:12.274
I said, "You get out. That's all. You get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:12.573 --> 00:45:17.730
You are no good for Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja Yoga is no good for you."

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:23.675
Is a complete outcast!

00:45:24.517 --> 00:45:29.186
They have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:30.729 --> 00:45:48.327
Also, in India we have problem of dishonesty.

00:45:49.677 --> 00:45:52.436
 They are dishonest people.

00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:56.417
 This is our special temperament, I think.

00:45:56.488 --> 00:46:01.811
 We have very corrupt people. India has become so corrupt that

00:46:02.086 --> 00:46:06.687
 I can't believe it. I was here about thirty-five years back,

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:09.835
we had never heard of corruption.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.935
Now, they have become so corrupt

00:46:14.253 --> 00:46:21.348
and that's what enters, that also enters into Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:26.005
When that enters into Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.794
they will be just found out

00:46:31.091 --> 00:46:34.733
and will be punished not by Me,

00:46:34.787 --> 00:46:38.293
by you, but their own Kundalini.

00:46:43.363 --> 00:46:51.033
So, every country has its own specialty as far as doing something wrong.

00:46:51.439 --> 00:46:54.605
 We are not here to do anything wrong.

00:46:54.828 --> 00:47:00.004
 We are not going to express ourselves as wrong people.

00:47:00.187 --> 00:47:06.977
But we are here to prove that we are perfect, we are wonderful people.

00:47:07.343 --> 00:47:11.653
That is what is the self - that we are perfect.

00:47:12.132 --> 00:47:20.905
 We don't have to go according to what we were.

00:47:21.591 --> 00:47:28.115
It's a new realm we have reached, it's a new area we have reached,

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:32.784
and let us enjoy that great area.

00:47:33.613 --> 00:47:36.704
I think all of you understand Me

00:47:36.792 --> 00:47:46.359
 that today I am little worried about people
who are dragging Sahaja Yoga down.

00:47:47.819 --> 00:47:53.780
 And, they should understand that I understand everything.

00:47:54.128 --> 00:47:59.600
And, when they'll be harmed, they should not blame Me for that.

00:48:00.045 --> 00:48:06.445
It is obvious that they are nowhere near Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:11.867
 Sahaja Yoga purifies you everyday.

00:48:12.384 --> 00:48:16.944
You see one experience, you see one person,

00:48:17.028 --> 00:48:23.354
you see some events and it purifies you.

00:48:24.787 --> 00:48:26.485
That's the sign.

00:48:26.663 --> 00:48:30.721
Supposing I see somebody - a dishonest man,

00:48:30.858 --> 00:48:38.299
 immediately I start finding "I hope I'm not doing any dishonesty Myself."

00:48:39.823 --> 00:48:46.541
Just imagine that you are the one who is the curator -

00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:50.069
 correcting influence on yourself.

00:48:50.538 --> 00:48:53.244
Where do you stand? Do you stand

00:48:53.426 --> 00:48:59.060
 on the correction point or in getting finished with it?

00:48:59.612 --> 00:49:02.860
Yesterdays lecture everybody liked very much

00:49:02.971 --> 00:49:06.883
but this is the extension of that lecture, I'm telling you.

00:49:07.097 --> 00:49:11.438
That you are very great people. You can save the whole world.

00:49:11.879 --> 00:49:17.706
I must say I never expected all this to happen in My lifetime.

00:49:18.007 --> 00:49:24.116
And it has happened. And, I see you as very great, very great people.

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:28.219
 Especially ladies have to work it out more

00:49:28.439 --> 00:49:37.353
because I am a woman, and women have a special capacity to love and to bear.

00:49:38.901 --> 00:49:43.862
I expect all of you to become beautiful, beautiful Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:44.021 --> 00:49:47.658
And that nothing can convince the whole world

00:49:47.886 --> 00:49:58.532
 but your work, your abilities, and also your power to love.

00:50:01.348 --> 00:50:07.267
So many things I have seen, experienced about you people.

00:50:07.541 --> 00:50:12.114
 When I think about them I really feel very happy.

00:50:12.439 --> 00:50:17.098
I have seen people how they have managed and looked after

00:50:17.336 --> 00:50:22.209
so many things which were difficult, and have worked it out.

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:25.814
So, now we are in for a new world

00:50:25.902 --> 00:50:32.259
and in that new world, a new race of Sahaja Yogis  have to show their presence.

00:50:32.441 --> 00:50:38.442
 They have to show their powers and their courage and their understanding.

00:50:38.638 --> 00:50:46.648
It is not serious. It is not frivolous. But it is joyous.

00:50:47.133 --> 00:50:53.410
 It is just joy that you have to feel about yourself.

00:50:53.593 --> 00:50:59.679
 I am telling you all this
because this is within you,  within your power.

00:50:59.785 --> 00:51:06.288
 It is all the time residing within you and that you have faced it also.

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:11.264
So, I wish you all a very, very happy birthday

00:51:11.371 --> 00:51:21.812
 so that you people have a new birth
and new understanding and a new personality.

00:51:22.239 --> 00:51:26.058
 Try to accept that personality, try to respect it.

00:51:26.284 --> 00:51:29.494
That's the personality is your self.

00:51:29.657 --> 00:51:32.470
May God bless you!
