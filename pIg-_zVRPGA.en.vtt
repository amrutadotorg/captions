00:02:05.477 --> 00:02:09.367
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna

00:02:12.457 --> 00:02:18.337
as a very great personality.

00:02:19.487 --> 00:02:24.547
And you know why He came on this earth –

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:34.427
to establish this is the new form of, not Virat, not Virata,

00:02:36.307 --> 00:02:46.317
but a form by which this country became so prosperous.

00:02:51.527 --> 00:02:59.337
And by His advent only He created a beautiful mentality

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:08.507
among the people how to develop this country with Dharma.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.447
And you had very great leaders

00:03:16.357 --> 00:03:18.397
who followed Him

00:03:21.357 --> 00:03:26.317
and who worshipped Him in a way,

00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:33.347
and created a new world of this America.

00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:38.477
But unfortunately as the time passed on,

00:03:39.517 --> 00:03:46.527
His form vanished from the minds of the people.

00:03:48.397 --> 00:03:52.437
The reason was, Krishna was represented here

00:03:53.327 --> 00:03:58.317
by very, very wrong type of people who had no idea

00:03:58.477 --> 00:04:01.407
about Shri Krishna:

00:04:04.547 --> 00:04:12.447
that He was a great master of wealth,

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:20.347
that He knew how to use the wealth and how to create

00:04:20.477 --> 00:04:24.477
the wealth with dharma, not with adharma.

00:04:26.477 --> 00:04:30.487
They all forgot about it completely

00:04:31.397 --> 00:04:35.377
and gradually started using maneuvering powers,

00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:45.407
all kinds of, all kinds of adharmic things – cheating, grabbing

00:04:45.547 --> 00:04:54.307
money, spending their money in absolutely useless things.

00:04:56.547 --> 00:05:01.427
He is Kubera. He doesn’t need any money, of course,

00:05:02.477 --> 00:05:05.517
He achieves money;

00:05:07.547 --> 00:05:10.317
and not only that,

00:05:10.507 --> 00:05:14.327
He is living, He lived in money.

00:05:15.347 --> 00:05:21.467
They said that He created a golden house for Him,

00:05:22.387 --> 00:05:27.387
absolutely made with gold in Dwarika,

00:05:27.547 --> 00:05:30.427
but it submerged in the water,

00:05:30.517 --> 00:05:37.407
in the sea, and nobody believed that it is true.

00:05:37.527 --> 00:05:42.407
But now they have found out His house under the water,

00:05:42.507 --> 00:05:44.337
very deep waters,

00:05:45.307 --> 00:05:52.337
so all their conjecture about Him was wrong, all false;

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:56.507
that He was definitely a man who made lots of money

00:05:57.377 --> 00:05:58.507
by dharma.

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:04.357
Also He was a son of a king, and He built this Dwarika

00:06:04.517 --> 00:06:07.347
out of gold.

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:11.437
It is still there and people have found it,

00:06:12.427 --> 00:06:15.467
but under the sea.

00:06:16.537 --> 00:06:21.307
Thousands of years have passed, but still existed.

00:06:22.327 --> 00:06:25.507
Only because perhaps it belonged to Shri Krishna,

00:06:26.377 --> 00:06:28.377
it is still existing.

00:06:28.517 --> 00:06:33.397
That’s what it is, because He was the one

00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:37.407
who was for satya first – truth.

00:06:38.337 --> 00:06:44.457
He was for truth, and He worked out everything

00:06:45.347 --> 00:06:48.517
on the principle of truth.

00:06:49.437 --> 00:06:53.347
Whatever was not truth, He tried to finish it off.

00:06:53.487 --> 00:07:00.387
Whatever was destructive, He tried to remove that;

00:07:00.547 --> 00:07:07.507
and He established Himself through truth only, truth only.

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:12.497
He’s the one who represent the truth, absolute truth,

00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:18.337
and how the truth can prevail in everything.

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:25.307
I’m just the opposite of Him because I don’t understand

00:07:25.437 --> 00:07:27.377
money at all,

00:07:27.527 --> 00:07:32.307
but He’s looking after that part in My life.

00:07:32.507 --> 00:07:35.467
I’m so hopelessly bad –

00:07:36.377 --> 00:07:40.547
I don’t understand banking, I don’t understand money,

00:07:41.457 --> 00:07:46.377
I can’t even count money. Now what can you say to that?

00:07:47.377 --> 00:07:49.547
But He’s there to look after,

00:07:50.447 --> 00:07:54.537
and I've never a dearth of money, never a dearth of any

00:07:55.547 --> 00:08:00.327
wealth, it’s all full of it.

00:08:01.327 --> 00:08:06.397
Also it comes through your sense of satisfaction.

00:08:07.437 --> 00:08:10.487
If you have that sense of satisfaction,

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:15.537
you don’t look for money.

00:08:16.427 --> 00:08:20.467
What happened in your country that some people got money.

00:08:21.337 --> 00:08:25.337
If you got little money, then you get the taste of money.

00:08:25.507 --> 00:08:28.347
They’re not satisfied people.

00:08:28.477 --> 00:08:33.507
So like mad they went on spending on nonsensical things.

00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:38.487
It is something very much human.

00:08:39.397 --> 00:08:42.537
After your human evolution,

00:08:43.407 --> 00:08:47.367
after you have reached a certain state of enlightenment,

00:08:47.547 --> 00:08:54.547
then all these demeaning things like greed

00:08:56.387 --> 00:08:59.397
all disappear from your character.

00:08:59.397 --> 00:09:03.487
You don’t have that greed in you anymore

00:09:04.387 --> 00:09:09.317
and you become extremely a satisfied person.

00:09:09.447 --> 00:09:13.537
To you money is there, all right, but it’s not so important.

00:09:15.317 --> 00:09:23.437
It is just that you think you don’t need it, and you’ll get it.

00:09:24.357 --> 00:09:27.547
All done by Shri Krishna all over, can you imagine?

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:31.427
He’s doing all this, looking after you

00:09:32.307 --> 00:09:35.547
and helping you with money.

00:09:36.427 --> 00:09:39.517
We started Sahaja Yoga without a single pai.

00:09:40.407 --> 00:09:43.407
I don’t, never had any problem.

00:09:43.547 --> 00:09:51.397
So one thing, as Kubera He’s the supplier of wealth.

00:09:51.537 --> 00:09:55.327
He looks after people who don’t have money.

00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:59.367
He gives money to people who stand by truth,

00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:04.457
who enjoy the life of truth.

00:10:07.417 --> 00:10:19.487
It is His work that people enjoy wealth, otherwise they don’t.

00:10:20.527 --> 00:10:22.447
They have this much, they want to have more;

00:10:23.367 --> 00:10:25.457
that means they don’t enjoy the wealth.

00:10:26.327 --> 00:10:29.347
They have a little, they want to get much more. Why?

00:10:29.487 --> 00:10:34.397
Because they are not enjoying whatever they have.

00:10:34.517 --> 00:10:38.457
But after Self-realization you will see that you enjoy

00:10:39.357 --> 00:10:41.457
whatever you have.

00:10:42.327 --> 00:10:45.407
You enjoy it fully, absolutely,

00:10:45.517 --> 00:10:49.417
and you don’t hanker after something, that is not there.

00:10:49.517 --> 00:10:52.327
Doesn’t matter if you don’t have.

00:10:53.347 --> 00:10:55.317
Many a times people have asked Me,

00:10:55.447 --> 00:11:00.457
“Mother, why not we have the puja of Krishna as Kubera?”

00:11:00.537 --> 00:11:02.427
I said, “All right.

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:05.377
Just now everybody’s trying to become Kuber.

00:11:05.507 --> 00:11:07.467
Let them learn a lesson,

00:11:08.317 --> 00:11:11.477
and then we will have the puja of Kubera.”

00:11:12.327 --> 00:11:17.367
And that’s why today I’ve agreed to have this puja.

00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:23.427
Because now you have seen what happens if you have greed.

00:11:24.477 --> 00:11:28.457
You go on committing all kinds of sins,

00:11:28.547 --> 00:11:34.317
all kinds of wrong things which can destroy your country.

00:11:34.417 --> 00:11:37.547
Such a rich country has now become a poor country.

00:11:38.377 --> 00:11:40.467
Where is that money gone?

00:11:41.307 --> 00:11:42.357
They’re very clever.

00:11:42.447 --> 00:11:45.547
Somebody told Me today that this money with the insurance.

00:11:45.547 --> 00:11:48.427
“My God,” I said, “the law is such that

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:50.537
you can’t get out that money.”

00:11:51.397 --> 00:11:55.387
Secondly they said that it is in offshore and all that.

00:11:55.537 --> 00:12:01.367
I said, “But see now, they were never afraid

00:12:02.497 --> 00:12:05.537
that they'll be caught up,

00:12:06.467 --> 00:12:10.347
and they continued for so many years.

00:12:11.447 --> 00:12:14.387
But I’m sure one day

00:12:14.457 --> 00:12:18.477
they'll all be exposed by Kubera Himself.”

00:12:19.407 --> 00:12:24.397
So today by worshipping Kubera what we are doing,

00:12:24.497 --> 00:12:30.387
we are going to establish, establish the truth of money,

00:12:31.307 --> 00:12:35.317
what lies behind the money,

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:45.307
what is the point of having money.

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:47.347
This country had money.

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:52.467
As a result so many good people came here to work,

00:12:53.317 --> 00:12:56.377
and you had so many complementary things.

00:12:57.307 --> 00:13:00.487
You had lots of people who have complemented,

00:13:01.327 --> 00:13:05.307
because I think in certain things Americans were little less;

00:13:05.407 --> 00:13:09.387
not in intelligence, but in brilliance I think

00:13:09.457 --> 00:13:11.527
they were little bit lacking.

00:13:12.377 --> 00:13:15.357
So they got very brilliant people from abroad,

00:13:15.447 --> 00:13:20.487
and also they were very focused people,

00:13:21.317 --> 00:13:23.417
so they worked it out very well.

00:13:23.527 --> 00:13:28.347
Also they respected people who came with brains.

00:13:28.467 --> 00:13:31.527
So this is what happens when you forget

00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:36.317
that truth is the main point.

00:13:36.397 --> 00:13:41.327
If you don’t have the truth, no use having money.

00:13:41.427 --> 00:13:46.307
Because what you did was to go around with this thing,

00:13:46.387 --> 00:13:52.457
that thing, I mean all kinds of things, to just get money.

00:13:54.307 --> 00:13:57.477
The other day I was traveling through Las Vegas, lastly.

00:13:59.327 --> 00:14:01.427
And when we stopped at that airport

00:14:02.337 --> 00:14:05.347
so many people walked into the aeroplane,

00:14:05.507 --> 00:14:07.497
and they all were looking as if somebody’s dead

00:14:08.377 --> 00:14:09.487
in their family or what has happened.

00:14:10.407 --> 00:14:12.367
First I couldn’t understand.

00:14:12.487 --> 00:14:16.427
Then said, “Mother, they have lost all their money.”

00:14:20.517 --> 00:14:24.417
So when they have money, they are jumping, next moment

00:14:24.527 --> 00:14:26.547
they are crying because they have lost the money.

00:14:27.397 --> 00:14:29.427
What’s the use of such a money

00:14:29.537 --> 00:14:34.317
which is so temporary, which is so useless?

00:14:34.437 --> 00:14:39.547
But that is human nature, to run after maya.

00:14:40.457 --> 00:14:47.317
And this is the quality of money, that it gives you maya.

00:14:47.507 --> 00:14:52.397
Maya like this, that they get a little money somehow;

00:14:52.537 --> 00:14:56.517
with that little money, they buy something.

00:14:57.387 --> 00:15:00.367
Then they think money is very important.

00:15:00.497 --> 00:15:03.407
You see, you can buy lots of things,

00:15:03.507 --> 00:15:06.417
you can buy cars, you can buy airplanes, this, that.

00:15:07.397 --> 00:15:12.427
So there is where maya plays on you, and you start running

00:15:12.547 --> 00:15:17.317
after that mad money which makes you mad.

00:15:17.427 --> 00:15:21.527
It’s nice that at this juncture they have discovered

00:15:22.437 --> 00:15:25.507
the falsehood of this maya money.

00:15:26.397 --> 00:15:30.327
And I am so happy that they were all handcuffed,

00:15:30.457 --> 00:15:36.317
and all their power of money was finished.

00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:41.427
So, this Kubera is working out all these tricks.

00:15:42.467 --> 00:15:48.387
Krishna is a very tricky, extremely tricky personality.

00:15:48.527 --> 00:15:54.547
He puts the tricks, every action after every action.

00:15:56.327 --> 00:15:58.387
Now money matters:

00:15:58.527 --> 00:16:04.317
He first befools you that you run after it,

00:16:05.347 --> 00:16:09.487
and then you just discover that it was stupidity.

00:16:10.347 --> 00:16:15.307
We have a story in our land, country, called “Sheikh Chili.”

00:16:15.417 --> 00:16:17.387
He got little money,

00:16:17.527 --> 00:16:23.367
and he got into the grab of this maya.

00:16:23.487 --> 00:16:26.527
So he thought, “I can do very well.”

00:16:27.377 --> 00:16:30.327
So he started dreaming as to what he should do.

00:16:30.477 --> 00:16:34.347
So he went and bought lots of eggs and he said,

00:16:34.437 --> 00:16:39.347
“Now these eggs will have little, little chicks which will grow,

00:16:39.437 --> 00:16:42.397
which will I’ll sell and I’ll so much money,”

00:16:42.477 --> 00:16:44.407
and it was like that he was talking.

00:16:45.357 --> 00:16:50.537
And while thinking about it in his mind, he went off to sleep,

00:16:51.397 --> 00:16:54.497
and then in his sleep he fell on the eggs

00:16:55.337 --> 00:16:58.387
and all the eggs broke.

00:16:58.497 --> 00:17:01.437
So the maya was over.

00:17:02.347 --> 00:17:05.407
This should happen early, but if it doesn’t happen

00:17:05.537 --> 00:17:10.407
then you end up in the jail or something like that.

00:17:10.547 --> 00:17:17.327
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which gives you a complete vision,

00:17:17.407 --> 00:17:20.377
complete vision of the destruction

00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:25.317
that can follow this maya business.

00:17:25.537 --> 00:17:30.377
It is something, such an insight

00:17:30.507 --> 00:17:33.407
that you don’t have to do anything with it.

00:17:34.347 --> 00:17:38.317
I'm different, I told you I don’t understand it at all.

00:17:38.427 --> 00:17:42.317
But even if you understand the value of money,

00:17:42.417 --> 00:17:46.327
even if you understand that money can bring

00:17:46.437 --> 00:17:51.397
lots of things to you, despite that you don’t look at it,

00:17:51.477 --> 00:17:57.467
just turn your face – that is the sign of a real Sahaja yogi.

00:17:57.537 --> 00:18:01.387
To him it doesn’t matter, temperamentally.

00:18:01.467 --> 00:18:06.327
It’s not that he does something for that, or tells his mind, nothing.

00:18:06.437 --> 00:18:11.367
Temperamentally he doesn’t care for money,

00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:15.447
just because he’s above it.

00:18:15.547 --> 00:18:19.477
The one who is above money is a real Sahaja yogi.

00:18:20.317 --> 00:18:23.507
The one who is engulfed in the nonsense

00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:28.327
and the maya of money is not a Sahaja yogi.

00:18:28.437 --> 00:18:30.437
Of course I have seen most of the Sahaja yogis

00:18:30.517 --> 00:18:33.307
are extremely honest, specially in the West.

00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:37.427
But in India there’s a disease: as you have some here viruses,

00:18:38.307 --> 00:18:41.407
we have certain viruses in India also.

00:18:41.547 --> 00:18:44.317
So they still go on running after money,

00:18:44.437 --> 00:18:46.437
to them money is important.

00:18:47.347 --> 00:18:50.527
But in the evolutionary process if you reach a certain state

00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:54.447
where you rise above your Nabhi Chakra,

00:18:55.327 --> 00:19:00.307
rise your Nabhi Chakra, then money is not so important,

00:19:00.417 --> 00:19:02.477
it’s not so important.

00:19:07.347 --> 00:19:16.337
To Me, I find I cannot buy things unnecessarily.

00:19:17.497 --> 00:19:19.537
Of course I mean there are so many unnecessary things

00:19:20.437 --> 00:19:24.447
they have, because you people give Me here presents, this that.

00:19:25.317 --> 00:19:30.307
But Myself, you’ll be amazed, I’m so nervous or I should say

00:19:30.387 --> 00:19:36.427
hesitant, or you may call it absolutely absent from the spot

00:19:36.537 --> 00:19:41.407
where they are doing any business, any purchasing.

00:19:43.337 --> 00:19:45.547
Come here and fix it please.

00:19:51.337 --> 00:19:54.477
It falls down, so I'm holding on!

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:03.397
Correct, now all right.

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:13.497
In the same way, Sahaja yogis have to fix their mind

00:20:21.397 --> 00:20:23.517
to their spirit,

00:20:24.417 --> 00:20:30.397
and enjoy the powers of your spirit, your own.

00:20:30.537 --> 00:20:37.367
That enjoyment once you get it, you don’t fall to your greed.

00:20:38.407 --> 00:20:40.337
This is something

00:20:40.507 --> 00:20:45.307
very, very simple,

00:20:45.487 --> 00:20:48.387
but sometimes you don’t do it.

00:20:48.527 --> 00:20:54.317
You get enamored by something, maybe a car,

00:20:54.437 --> 00:20:57.427
maybe aeroplane, I don’t know what – whatever it is.

00:20:58.317 --> 00:21:02.327
It’s a headache to have too many cars, isn’t it?

00:21:03.487 --> 00:21:05.447
But people have;

00:21:06.337 --> 00:21:08.367
they think by that people are impressed,

00:21:08.487 --> 00:21:11.457
and they think no end of themselves or not – nothing.

00:21:12.377 --> 00:21:15.527
If they are impressed, what is the use to us?

00:21:16.387 --> 00:21:18.507
What do we get out of it?

00:21:19.367 --> 00:21:24.427
Sahaja yogi has his own spirit to enjoy,

00:21:24.537 --> 00:21:26.407
more than anything else.

00:21:27.317 --> 00:21:28.527
He doesn’t want to possess anything.

00:21:29.397 --> 00:21:32.327
It’s a headache to possess things also.

00:21:32.467 --> 00:21:36.417
The other side of it is a Mahalakshmi.

00:21:37.407 --> 00:21:40.487
If that principle is within you, Mahalakshmi Principle,

00:21:41.377 --> 00:21:43.507
you’ll have never a problem of money.

00:21:44.377 --> 00:21:47.387
On the contrary, you’ll know how to stop it.

00:21:47.517 --> 00:21:51.527
So far as I am concerned,

00:21:52.387 --> 00:21:56.447
I get fed up of My Mahalakshmi Principle

00:21:57.327 --> 00:21:59.417
because I don’t know from where it works out,

00:21:59.537 --> 00:22:05.447
how it works out, without any effort.

00:22:07.447 --> 00:22:12.547
But the temperamentally, I have no interest at all,

00:22:13.427 --> 00:22:15.507
temperamentally.

00:22:16.427 --> 00:22:23.427
But it is the, I don’t know what is the cause of this effect.

00:22:25.357 --> 00:22:29.317
Now supposing I buy some small thing, just like that,

00:22:29.467 --> 00:22:33.527
it will sell at least ten times more.

00:22:34.417 --> 00:22:38.467
It will be of value at least ten times more, I don’t know how.

00:22:39.527 --> 00:22:45.437
It’s very surprising – automatically.

00:22:46.437 --> 00:22:53.307
I’ll buy something very small, then I find it’s very expensive.

00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:58.527
How it works, just must be miracles of Mahalakshmi, I think.

00:22:59.447 --> 00:23:03.467
So what I have to tell you is this,

00:23:04.377 --> 00:23:09.497
that you should not worry about your financial situations

00:23:10.347 --> 00:23:12.337
at all.

00:23:12.457 --> 00:23:14.397
Do not go on calculating,

00:23:14.517 --> 00:23:19.307
do not see how much money you have in the bank,

00:23:19.427 --> 00:23:21.307
what you have to do with your money,

00:23:21.417 --> 00:23:22.447
where you should invest.

00:23:23.347 --> 00:23:27.307
I have seen people going mad planning the whole thing.

00:23:27.477 --> 00:23:31.397
There’s no need to do that once you are a Sahaja yogi.

00:23:31.527 --> 00:23:35.307
It all works automatically.

00:23:35.417 --> 00:23:39.397
The greed is within you, just like any other disease.

00:23:39.537 --> 00:23:43.357
As you have diseases, greed is also there.

00:23:43.517 --> 00:23:47.447
As your diseases can get cured with Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:48.357 --> 00:23:56.537
your diseases, as much as your greed is, it vanishes.

00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:01.457
You don’t know what is greed is.

00:24:02.547 --> 00:24:07.427
The only way to counter-balance is to become extremely

00:24:07.537 --> 00:24:10.397
generous.

00:24:10.537 --> 00:24:15.327
If you are extremely generous, greed will run away.

00:24:15.457 --> 00:24:18.427
That may be another way of doing it.

00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:25.357
Supposing you get something in your house

00:24:27.347 --> 00:24:29.377
and you think it is too much.

00:24:30.307 --> 00:24:33.337
Not to get rid of it but just to think it’s too much,

00:24:33.337 --> 00:24:35.357
you should give it to someone; you just start thinking,

00:24:35.457 --> 00:24:37.357
whom can you give?

00:24:37.537 --> 00:24:39.547
And immediately you’ll remember,

00:24:40.407 --> 00:24:44.407
“Oh, that person doesn’t have this. Let me give him this.”

00:24:45.307 --> 00:24:48.467
And if you give him he’ll be so thankful, so thankful,

00:24:49.347 --> 00:24:52.417
and he’ll say all kinds of nice things to you

00:24:53.307 --> 00:24:57.307
which normally nobody would say to you, nobody.

00:25:00.537 --> 00:25:06.397
And it’s surprising how joy-giving it is,

00:25:06.517 --> 00:25:11.347
how people like your generosity.

00:25:11.467 --> 00:25:14.467
So you have to be generous, just generous;

00:25:15.337 --> 00:25:17.437
not with yourself, but with others.

00:25:18.327 --> 00:25:23.357
As much as possible, be generous.

00:25:24.417 --> 00:25:32.397
Generosity is very love-giving, one of the expressions

00:25:32.517 --> 00:25:35.397
of your love.

00:25:35.517 --> 00:25:39.497
Many a times it has happened with Me

00:25:40.377 --> 00:25:44.497
that I saw somebody needed something,

00:25:46.327 --> 00:25:48.387
and kept it in My mind.

00:25:48.547 --> 00:25:52.397
Then I bought that thing and gave it to that person.

00:25:53.317 --> 00:25:58.447
And the amount of love that person gave Me

00:25:59.327 --> 00:26:01.347
was thousand time more

00:26:01.487 --> 00:26:09.307
than what I would have got joy out of buying it, by that thing.

00:26:09.437 --> 00:26:13.407
It was so insipid for Me, but for him it was.... He told so

00:26:13.507 --> 00:26:18.347
many people, “Mother gave me this. Mother gave me.”

00:26:18.457 --> 00:26:20.527
I mean, I was surprised.

00:26:21.387 --> 00:26:23.487
Then they asked Me, “Mother, how did You give him?”

00:26:24.357 --> 00:26:26.477
I said, “Just out of love.”

00:26:27.357 --> 00:26:30.387
Many people took to Sahaja Yoga thinking,

00:26:30.477 --> 00:26:33.337
“What a generosity is!”

00:26:33.457 --> 00:26:37.527
So to be generous is the best way to live in this world.

00:26:39.407 --> 00:26:43.307
After all it’s a headache to have too many things.

00:26:43.417 --> 00:26:47.517
Better to get rid of them, but out of love.

00:26:48.367 --> 00:26:50.487
If you do that,

00:26:51.377 --> 00:26:56.387
you’ll be know how much they’ll be appreciative of you.

00:26:57.397 --> 00:27:04.507
Another thing is, to get greed of, to get rid of greed

00:27:06.307 --> 00:27:11.427
you should try to do some sort of a collective social work.

00:27:12.447 --> 00:27:17.457
Supposing you go to some place where lots of poor people

00:27:18.317 --> 00:27:22.417
are there, I tell you your greed will just drop out.

00:27:23.537 --> 00:27:25.547
You’ll be amazed how these people are living,

00:27:26.417 --> 00:27:28.337
in what conditions.

00:27:28.447 --> 00:27:32.417
“Why do I care for all the wealth and everything?”

00:27:33.397 --> 00:27:36.367
That will be just shocking.

00:27:36.477 --> 00:27:39.427
Sometimes, you see, you see people

00:27:40.537 --> 00:27:44.457
in India also in a very bad condition.

00:27:45.317 --> 00:27:47.477
Once I went to Calcutta

00:27:49.397 --> 00:27:54.507
and I was so – somehow or other you see by chance,

00:27:55.367 --> 00:28:00.347
I happened to be in places where people were very, in a very,

00:28:00.527 --> 00:28:05.457
very great poverty, even the children.

00:28:06.327 --> 00:28:09.517
And you’ll be amazed, for days together I wouldn’t eat My food.

00:28:10.407 --> 00:28:14.347
I was crying and not eating My food, I just didn’t know

00:28:14.447 --> 00:28:16.407
what to do.

00:28:16.517 --> 00:28:19.527
Because I felt, “What is this?

00:28:20.427 --> 00:28:23.427
Why these people are so poor?”

00:28:23.527 --> 00:28:27.427
And I was helpless so I was crying,

00:28:27.517 --> 00:28:33.407
that one day I should try to do something for them.

00:28:33.527 --> 00:28:38.317
It is really remarkable, at a very young age of Mine

00:28:38.537 --> 00:28:47.367
I started a leper home, I started an infirmary, a refugee home,

00:28:48.397 --> 00:28:50.427
all kinds of things.

00:28:52.387 --> 00:28:57.517
And I never even thought that whatever money I have,

00:28:59.377 --> 00:29:06.377
if I gave to these people I may have to give up some things.

00:29:07.387 --> 00:29:09.447
I also sold some of My things,

00:29:10.317 --> 00:29:14.437
because so pleasure-giving I tell you, so pleasure-giving,

00:29:15.317 --> 00:29:18.467
so joy-giving to be generous.

00:29:19.447 --> 00:29:26.367
It is so pain in every way that you should be generous.

00:29:26.537 --> 00:29:29.477
That is the quality of Kubera.

00:29:30.387 --> 00:29:34.377
He’s an extremely generous personality,

00:29:35.387 --> 00:29:39.447
and that’s what’s personality you should be.

00:29:40.327 --> 00:29:43.457
So, I’ve seen that Sahaja yogis are very generous.

00:29:44.457 --> 00:29:50.317
So far nobody has told Me that somebody is a miserly fellow –

00:29:50.447 --> 00:29:53.407
so far, so far.

00:29:54.367 --> 00:29:59.547
But I’m sure one day will come when we’ll have people

00:30:00.407 --> 00:30:04.317
of very high quality.

00:30:04.427 --> 00:30:08.387
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t say like other cults say that

00:30:08.497 --> 00:30:14.437
you give up your clothes, you give up your family, you stay,

00:30:15.317 --> 00:30:20.547
stay in a forest or in a hut or anything – nothing of the kind.

00:30:21.407 --> 00:30:24.427
Don’t give up anything.

00:30:24.527 --> 00:30:28.527
You have to give up from your heart.

00:30:29.407 --> 00:30:31.527
Just it should happen in your personality.

00:30:32.377 --> 00:30:34.517
You don’t have to give up.

00:30:35.397 --> 00:30:44.317
And if you have that well-built in spirituality,

00:30:45.327 --> 00:30:52.367
you’ll not even think of grabbing someone.

00:30:53.457 --> 00:30:56.407
On the contrary,

00:30:56.547 --> 00:30:59.497
you would like to give up everything.

00:31:00.367 --> 00:31:03.367
My father was even worse than Me, I should say.

00:31:04.417 --> 00:31:07.437
He always used to leave the house open, all doors open.

00:31:08.307 --> 00:31:12.447
He said, “No thief will come in if you keep the doors closed.”

00:31:13.307 --> 00:31:15.417
So one day a thief came

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:19.467
and he took away his gramophone – in the old times,

00:31:20.317 --> 00:31:23.497
these big horn ones – he took away.

00:31:24.407 --> 00:31:27.467
The next day My father was sitting, very sad.

00:31:28.347 --> 00:31:29.407
So My mother asked him,

00:31:29.507 --> 00:31:31.437
“Why are you sad, because of the gramophone?”

00:31:32.317 --> 00:31:35.427
“No, I’m only sad because it seems he is a connoisseur of

00:31:35.547 --> 00:31:42.417
music, he has taken the gramophone but no records.”

00:31:43.417 --> 00:31:46.547
So My mother said, “All right, what should we do?

00:31:47.417 --> 00:31:50.367
Should we advertise in the newspaper that you take away

00:31:50.487 --> 00:31:53.517
your records?”

00:31:55.457 --> 00:32:01.377
I mean, it's such a beauty, that even after so many years

00:32:01.487 --> 00:32:04.527
I am telling you and you are enjoying.

00:32:05.387 --> 00:32:09.527
What a beautiful character it was of generosity.

00:32:10.407 --> 00:32:15.337
But if you force it through religion,

00:32:15.477 --> 00:32:20.307
through any such ideas that “you give up that, you give” –

00:32:20.437 --> 00:32:23.317
don’t have to give up.

00:32:23.447 --> 00:32:27.447
You give up from within.

00:32:28.397 --> 00:32:32.427
If you are not attached to it, you have given up.

00:32:32.547 --> 00:32:36.367
That much should be there and if you all enjoy your

00:32:36.507 --> 00:32:41.507
generosity and charity, nothing like it!

00:32:42.407 --> 00:32:46.507
I have known people who are very rich and all that,

00:32:47.397 --> 00:32:51.347
but they lack generosity.

00:32:51.467 --> 00:32:54.467
That is another quality of Kubera.

00:32:55.337 --> 00:32:58.497
He perhaps understand banking, perhaps.

00:32:59.367 --> 00:33:03.357
That time there were no banks but I think must be,

00:33:03.457 --> 00:33:06.337
because the way He manages banks, you know,

00:33:06.437 --> 00:33:10.387
it seems to Me that He’s sitting on top of them,

00:33:10.507 --> 00:33:15.317
and that’s why still in the banks there is no problem.

00:33:15.467 --> 00:33:16.517
I don’t know.

00:33:17.387 --> 00:33:23.397
But He’s a very clever person,

00:33:25.547 --> 00:33:27.527
very intelligent,

00:33:28.397 --> 00:33:30.417
very alert,

00:33:31.457 --> 00:33:36.457
which is important if you have to deal with money –

00:33:37.507 --> 00:33:42.357
though He was absolutely detached from money.

00:33:43.317 --> 00:33:46.327
And just see His life, what He did.

00:33:46.437 --> 00:33:51.347
He lived in childhood with His guru,

00:33:51.507 --> 00:33:53.467
and He used to take

00:33:54.347 --> 00:34:03.427
what you call the cows and herds outside in the jungles.

00:34:05.437 --> 00:34:11.437
That is how He lived in His childhood, and later on

00:34:14.327 --> 00:34:18.537
He was playing with the boys

00:34:19.387 --> 00:34:23.537
who were looking after the cows in a very,

00:34:24.437 --> 00:34:27.377
I mean, ordinary family.

00:34:31.357 --> 00:34:34.427
He never hankered after money.

00:34:35.397 --> 00:34:36.537
He used to steal,

00:34:38.527 --> 00:34:44.327
used to steal the butter,

00:34:44.517 --> 00:34:50.427
because these ladies used to sell these to Kamsa’s

00:34:54.427 --> 00:34:57.357
military people.

00:34:58.307 --> 00:35:00.407
So He used to eat that,

00:35:00.507 --> 00:35:04.337
so that this lady should not give it to them.

00:35:04.477 --> 00:35:08.397
Just imagine, such a little boy like Him.

00:35:08.517 --> 00:35:15.417
So actually, how He was teaching them a lesson.

00:35:16.307 --> 00:35:19.517
Those ladies were greedy, and wanted to give that

00:35:20.397 --> 00:35:22.527
to these horrible soldiers,

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:28.377
and He would eat all that butter Himself.

00:35:28.487 --> 00:35:31.427
In everything that He did,

00:35:32.307 --> 00:35:37.457
what you see is extreme generosity, extreme generosity.

00:35:39.307 --> 00:35:44.327
With all His intelligence He, He was so good.

00:35:48.547 --> 00:35:52.507
And He killed

00:35:56.537 --> 00:36:00.517
His own uncle, I should say;

00:36:02.497 --> 00:36:05.397
but for Him it is, was not important,

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:09.467
so-called relations were not important.

00:36:10.437 --> 00:36:13.467
But what you see in our India specially,

00:36:14.347 --> 00:36:16.487
that relations are very important.

00:36:17.347 --> 00:36:21.437
The father is a thief, his son is thief, his grandson is a thief,

00:36:21.527 --> 00:36:26.397
all of them are thieves – can you imagine?

00:36:27.367 --> 00:36:32.397
I haven’t seen in a family if there’s one person who is a thief,

00:36:32.497 --> 00:36:37.317
any one his progeny are honest.

00:36:37.427 --> 00:36:42.477
It’s a very funny thing, but such greed crawls into their minds

00:36:43.477 --> 00:36:47.457
that they don’t think is important.

00:36:48.337 --> 00:36:53.457
They just think that stealing is the only way one can live.

00:36:54.357 --> 00:36:58.497
Though in India there are people who are extremely honest.

00:36:59.307 --> 00:37:00.387
I have seen our servants.

00:37:00.527 --> 00:37:03.487
They never steal anything, nothing, never.

00:37:04.447 --> 00:37:06.517
I don’t know, they have no reasoning for it,

00:37:07.377 --> 00:37:09.357
it’s a matter of habit.

00:37:09.447 --> 00:37:14.527
They never steal anything – very surprising.

00:37:18.337 --> 00:37:20.477
Why, why don’t they steal?

00:37:21.457 --> 00:37:26.437
They’re happy with their lives, they don’t want to change it.

00:37:26.527 --> 00:37:32.317
They don’t want to have these horrible things

00:37:32.447 --> 00:37:34.497
that can put them in jail.

00:37:35.347 --> 00:37:37.397
But they don’t know,

00:37:37.477 --> 00:37:42.307
they don’t even think about it; just they just don’t do it.

00:37:43.307 --> 00:37:48.427
Why, because they have a sense of shame.

00:37:49.327 --> 00:37:52.537
In the poorer peoples, sense of shame is very,

00:37:53.377 --> 00:37:55.317
very developed.

00:37:55.407 --> 00:38:03.357
In that society they have a great respect for people who are

00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:06.347
honest, and they are all honest.

00:38:06.507 --> 00:38:10.547
One of them may be not,

00:38:11.407 --> 00:38:14.547
but they have no respect for such a person,

00:38:15.447 --> 00:38:20.517
because they think self-respect is the biggest thing.

00:38:21.347 --> 00:38:24.397
Can you imagine these poor people?

00:38:24.507 --> 00:38:28.427
They have food once a day,

00:38:28.527 --> 00:38:32.417
but to them their self-respect is above everything.

00:38:32.527 --> 00:38:38.497
So the third solution for this kind of a nonsensical greed is

00:38:39.507 --> 00:38:42.537
your self-respect.

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:45.447
Why should you steal,

00:38:45.547 --> 00:38:48.377
why should you have anything that is stolen,

00:38:48.507 --> 00:38:50.497
or why should you have anything that belongs

00:38:51.337 --> 00:38:53.447
to another person?

00:38:54.367 --> 00:38:56.477
If you have that self-respect within you,

00:38:57.337 --> 00:39:02.387
you won’t touch anything that is not yours.

00:39:03.467 --> 00:39:06.517
When the servants can do that, why not people

00:39:07.377 --> 00:39:11.367
who are not that badly off?

00:39:11.477 --> 00:39:17.337
It is a temperament of a higher level, I think,

00:39:17.457 --> 00:39:20.357
which they develop, where their self-respect

00:39:20.477 --> 00:39:25.327
is much more important than all kinds of

00:39:25.427 --> 00:39:29.427
other things that may satisfy their greed.

00:39:29.537 --> 00:39:35.317
But one thing about greed is, it is never satisfied.

00:39:35.427 --> 00:39:38.307
It is never satisfied.

00:39:38.417 --> 00:39:41.307
I’ve seen people who were very rich once upon a time,

00:39:41.407 --> 00:39:43.497
became very, very poor.

00:39:44.387 --> 00:39:47.377
So to them life has become hell.

00:39:47.497 --> 00:39:53.357
They can’t live with, without their great,

00:39:54.467 --> 00:39:59.447
I should say, pomp and show,

00:40:00.317 --> 00:40:03.327
but they don’t understand that it was false.

00:40:03.477 --> 00:40:08.407
They just go on feeling extremely

00:40:09.417 --> 00:40:13.457
downtrodden when they lose their money.

00:40:14.477 --> 00:40:18.457
Then there are people who want to have money;

00:40:19.317 --> 00:40:25.307
they’ll do anything but get money.

00:40:25.427 --> 00:40:31.457
It’s a very funny thing, but also power is the same as that.

00:40:32.327 --> 00:40:34.457
If you have your own powers,

00:40:35.307 --> 00:40:37.467
you don’t hanker after these powers.

00:40:37.467 --> 00:40:39.537
But they want to have power because

00:40:40.377 --> 00:40:44.457
they want to have money, and they get power with money –

00:40:44.537 --> 00:40:46.427
can you imagine?

00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:49.527
Where are human beings, at what level?

00:40:50.387 --> 00:40:53.347
At what level of evolution they are?

00:40:53.437 --> 00:40:58.547
They are going round and round the circle of this money.

00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:02.497
This is Nabhi Chakra

00:41:03.357 --> 00:41:05.397
which has to improve,

00:41:05.477 --> 00:41:08.497
which gives you satisfaction.

00:41:09.367 --> 00:41:12.327
If your Nabhi Chakra is satisfied,

00:41:12.427 --> 00:41:16.407
you have achieved the state of Kubera.

00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:20.307
That’s very important, to see

00:41:20.407 --> 00:41:24.537
that your Nabhi should be satisfied.

00:41:26.337 --> 00:41:29.377
There are so many other kinds of things we have,

00:41:29.497 --> 00:41:33.417
but I think now the worst is this greed.

00:41:33.527 --> 00:41:38.437
And this, if it is managed somehow or other,

00:41:38.527 --> 00:41:41.437
brought to its own level,

00:41:41.537 --> 00:41:45.387
then I think world will improve very much.

00:41:45.387 --> 00:41:47.317
May God bless you.
