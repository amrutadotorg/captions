1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:13,110
symmetry what is sahaja yoga sahaja some

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:17,190
is faith Germans born so it is born with

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:21,869
you the right to become United which is

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,240
the yoga with the divine and this this

5
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,189
sahaja yoga is something that everybody

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,210
can have is it is something everybody

7
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:35,040
can practice of course and how does the

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,160
this connection with the divine take

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,710
place we have within ourselves this

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,370
power in the triangular bone which is

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,850
called a sacred meaning sacred which

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:51,000
when awakened sprouts like a premium in

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:58,190
a seed and Rises through six subtle

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:02,129
centers opens out the last center and

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:05,460
gets connected with the damar which is a

16
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:09,510
subtle energy all around us which

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:12,979
organizes us which nourishes us does all

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,090
the living work above all it loves us

19
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:20,310
does this mainstream mythology that

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,770
people who have not had the ability to

21
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,280
practice sahaja yoga are not connected

22
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,780
with the divine most of them are not I

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:33,150
need some of them are they don't know

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:35,549
all about it so this is what a an extra

25
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,320
force that is available to human beings

26
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,630
to develop themselves in this way of

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,270
course this is the last breakthrough of

28
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,759
our evolution where you have to get

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,470
connected with the divine you have to

30
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,689
feel it on your central nervous system

31
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:54,479
and that's how you get your

32
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:57,930
self-realization do I perceive here that

33
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:03,119
this is a way of balancing oneself of

34
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:05,000
keeping in such a way of living one's

35
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,079
life in such a way that one is not

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,599
unbalanced in one's view of what is

37
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,330
going on around us yes we have two sites

38
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,150
in our system of autonomous nervous

39
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,580
system

40
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,920
turn right which he called as left and

41
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:24,250
right sympathetic nervous system the

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:27,819
left side caters for our emotions for

43
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:32,170
our past our desires the right side

44
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:35,560
caters for our actual physical and

45
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:38,500
mental if you indulge into one too much

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,190
and go too far with it you develop an

47
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,440
imbalance within yourself in the center

48
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,440
lies the third power which we call as

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,359
parasympathetic nervous system this is

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,269
the channel which is the central path of

51
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:55,930
ascent when the kundalini rises through

52
00:02:52,269 --> 00:03:00,609
it it brings you in the balance because

53
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:02,109
it rises in the center of the system so

54
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:05,560
this is the minimum that happens that

55
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:09,970
you developed your balance so how does

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:14,440
one actually achieve this balance it

57
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:15,810
just happens one tinniest in other words

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,579
there's no there's no physical

59
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,690
requirement on an individual not at all

60
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:25,000
not at all it's a evolutionary step as I

61
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,370
told you in our evolution we have

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,700
developed a balance we can stand on our

63
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,190
two legs animals cannot in the same way

64
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:39,209
you develop this special balance between

65
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:42,760
your emotions and your actions in a very

66
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:45,970
proper way you speak as though this is

67
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,090
some sort of evolutionary step yes it is

68
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,669
it is the last breakthrough that you

69
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:54,819
have to become the spirit now and this

70
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:57,310
has to be achieved which can be achieved

71
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:59,049
only through a living process because we

72
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,870
have become human beings through a

73
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:05,260
living process and that living process

74
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,879
has to act within us the sounds as

75
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,370
though it is rather a significant time

76
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,519
than in the in the history of humanity

77
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:15,370
very much in the history of humanity in

78
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,280
the history of evolution in the history

79
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:21,669
of spirituality is the most important

80
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,150
time because here where you get what

81
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:26,889
heaven has been promised to you so far

82
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,620
so it's no accident

83
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:32,289
that sahaja yoga has appeared in the

84
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,389
world at this time no not at all not at

85
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:37,029
all it's all predicted thousands of

86
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,759
years back in India and later on by many

87
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:44,080
Saints even William Blake has predicted

88
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,509
it shri mataji you went to russia last

89
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:53,169
year and I believe the reception you got

90
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:55,539
was most surprising yes I was myself

91
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:59,639
surprised because thousands of people

92
00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:01,870
came and very sensible well-educated

93
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,840
people came and they all settle down

94
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,289
thousands I didn't know how to cope with

95
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,229
that number because there were so many

96
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:15,580
and even the members of the Supreme

97
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:20,979
Council the government they came that I

98
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:24,719
could only say that in the so-called

99
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:28,319
free societies we waste too much time

100
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:31,210
experimenting with our freedom and

101
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,770
indulge too much into the politics which

102
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,889
is a waste thing I think there in

103
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,629
economics all these things while the

104
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,599
people there didn't have any such

105
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:44,169
chances so they put their energies to

106
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:45,610
something that was higher than that they

107
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,430
diverted and they were very

108
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,939
knowledgeable they knew a lot about

109
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,529
seeking they knew a lot about Kundalini

110
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:56,460
and as if they were just waiting for me

111
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:58,899
it was very de mama

112
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,500
mr. Gorbachev has said the Russians

113
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:05,110
require a mental revolution do you see

114
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,469
the acceptance of sahaja yoga as part of

115
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,990
this revolution of course he himself is

116
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:14,649
a saint and what he is meaning by mental

117
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,930
then they should now understand that

118
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:20,639
they have to develop that balance

119
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,229
between communism and democracy our

120
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,509
democracies are imbalanced they are

121
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,599
one-sided they have no not the other

122
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:32,819
side of collectivity but communism has

123
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:38,259
collectivity it is power oriented our

124
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:40,639
democracies are money-oriented what he

125
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:45,560
is meaning is the maturity

126
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:49,599
of all wisdom so yeah referring back to

127
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,599
what we were talking about earlier is it

128
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:57,949
okay as we were talking about earlier

129
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,770
about bringing the human body into

130
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:02,870
balance could we say then that mr.

131
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:07,240
Gorbachev is bringing the whole Eastern

132
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:12,949
Bloc into balance yes yes they had one

133
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:18,590
too much on one side and he's trying to

134
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:21,949
bring them in the center you mentioned

135
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:24,889
that you went to an Eastern Bloc

136
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:29,050
conference last year and I believe you

137
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:31,400
gave many influential people realisation

138
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,229
is it true that you believe that this

139
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,990
was instrumental in helping the

140
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:39,860
overthrow of oppressive communism it was

141
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:43,099
a yoga yoga seminar and I expected all

142
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,560
of them to be there and surprisingly I

143
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:48,169
talked to them hardly for 30 to 35

144
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,819
minutes and then I gave them realization

145
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,589
and all of them got it they were

146
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:55,099
representative from all these Eastern

147
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:57,860
Bloc countries when they got it

148
00:07:55,099 --> 00:08:00,680
they're so surprised at it that they

149
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,750
walked out with me out for the hall and

150
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,819
nobody was left in the hall listen to

151
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,190
other people they gave me their

152
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:09,919
addresses and they said we want this

153
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,629
only in our country and they wanted to

154
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,099
search our centers and I am told they

155
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:19,490
have already started centers the

156
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:22,279
all-pervading power requires a medium to

157
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,189
trigger something and when these people

158
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:27,560
were created as realized Souls as they

159
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:28,699
got connected with this all-pervading

160
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,560
power

161
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:35,990
I think they'd record it they had that

162
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,399
confidence that courage in them because

163
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,289
once we realized you become very

164
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,760
courageous and you want to establish

165
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:45,829
truth at any cost

166
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:49,149
similarly the the West shall we call it

167
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:53,290
the Western nations have had sahaja yoga

168
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:55,630
available to them to to investigate to

169
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:59,019
to see for themselves how it worked for

170
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:02,139
20 years and yet it has been very slow

171
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:07,750
to grow why is it happened this way do

172
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:11,759
you think here people have so many

173
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:15,550
diverse ideas about things they are very

174
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:18,160
self opinionated also about things and

175
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,190
the so-called man-made religions all

176
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,319
over have also conditioned them too much

177
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,430
they have other conditionings of

178
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:31,560
different norms that they have as far as

179
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:34,509
the social life is concerned and the

180
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:38,139
physical appearances rather on a very

181
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:41,259
superficial level so the people have not

182
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:43,120
grown I think so much deeper of course I

183
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:47,079
must say there are so many seekers in

184
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:53,290
the West so many seekers and they were

185
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:56,199
lost because as soon as people knew that

186
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,870
there's a market for them the false

187
00:09:56,199 --> 00:10:02,199
gurus jumped out and they started

188
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,350
preaching about false things just to

189
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:07,510
earn money they were all money oriented

190
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:10,120
now there's another psychology with the

191
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,850
Western mind that you must buy

192
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,819
everything if something is not for sale

193
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:19,120
then it is useless and this psychology

194
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:21,250
has really debted them to come to sahaja

195
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,980
yoga very much because this is a living

196
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,810
process and you cannot pay for it and

197
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,110
they couldn't bear it I mean actually I

198
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:31,949
must say one of the very important

199
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:35,050
television gentlemen told me off that

200
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:40,449
anglo-saxon brain cannot accept anything

201
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:42,730
which cannot be sold I didn't know what

202
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:45,490
to tell him I just said who has made

203
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:49,060
this brain his God has made and why is

204
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:52,779
it so so you have an expectation really

205
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,439
that the syncro sahaja yoga will change

206
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:56,290
the world

207
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:58,990
of course it changes human beings and

208
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:01,120
they manifest the change outside and we

209
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,160
create a new race that's what they're

210
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,949
talking about if you know they talk of

211
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,730
new age of a new race but I don't know

212
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:09,130
what is there

213
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,990
Nation about it they talk about all this

214
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,320
thing Aquarius and Aquarius is the

215
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:17,380
Kundalini she is placed in the Aquarius

216
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,360
and they talk about Aquarius and all

217
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,300
kinds of things they're talking writing

218
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,570
thinking about it but when it comes to

219
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,649
actualization I think they think I am

220
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:32,350
very too simple for them not complicated

221
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:35,410
and sahaja Yoga is too simple it should

222
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:37,660
be very complicated and all their own

223
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,269
ideas about seeking that they must

224
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,029
suffer they must go to Himalayas

225
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:47,949
they must starve themselves and then

226
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:51,130
only they can get realization Sri Hari

227
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:55,870
is the evolution of the planet closely

228
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:59,740
related to the evolution of humanity and

229
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:02,260
he was related and the planet our planet

230
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,329
is moving in a spiral way all the

231
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:08,070
planets are moving in a spiral way and

232
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:11,889
they are creating all possible things

233
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:15,760
for the use of human beings so that they

234
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:17,680
can save time save time for getting

235
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,800
their ascent and for the meditative

236
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:25,139
growth but people don't understand that

237
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:28,029
part there are theories around now that

238
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:30,310
the suggestions so we say that the

239
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:34,569
planet could be a living organism a

240
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:36,970
complete entity of course it is one of

241
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:41,860
the examples of this one I can give you

242
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:46,329
is that if you sleep under a coconut

243
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:49,089
tree a coconut never falls on anything

244
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:55,660
that is living whether it is a human

245
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:57,910
being or a snake never falls that is so

246
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,519
is it all around the world coconuts

247
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:04,449
never fallen and living creatures so

248
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:07,060
they understand we call it as Shri Paulo

249
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:12,459
because because we think that it is like

250
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:15,430
a brain which understands well if this

251
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:17,319
world is a living organism what is the

252
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,449
brain what drives this being this

253
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:20,860
organism what has made it evolve the way

254
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:23,600
it

255
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:27,820
there is the subtle power which is

256
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:31,460
all-pervading love God's love which

257
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:36,890
manifests all the things like living

258
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:38,030
work all nourishment all balancing it's

259
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,690
so balanced

260
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:46,550
if the Pacific was slightly deeper than

261
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:53,000
this there would have been problems if

262
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:54,680
Himalaya was safe one and a half times

263
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,370
then what it is there would have been

264
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:01,790
problems so everything is so balanced in

265
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:04,730
nature hmm and the Almighty has created

266
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:07,730
only one word only we human beings have

267
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:11,720
divided and moved like criminals with

268
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:14,440
our passports in our hands Shri Mata

269
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,840
Hari what we have been talking about

270
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,720
many people would regard as a belief or

271
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,560
a theory how does one know that the

272
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,300
difference between truth and a belief

273
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,970
first of all anything for which you have

274
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,730
to pay money is not the truth you can't

275
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:36,380
pay for it if you cancel out that I

276
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:41,630
think 99.9% all the falsehood will drop

277
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:45,950
out but truth to be really actualized

278
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:48,980
you have to have self realization then

279
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,870
you feel on your fingertips vibratory

280
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,420
awareness a new awareness a new

281
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,990
dimension awareness by which you can

282
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:59,840
make out what is true and what is false

283
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:03,860
that's an absolute truth that you

284
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:06,110
realize at that stage so one must have

285
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,840
one's realization really to be able to

286
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:12,860
tell the truth you want to follow anyone

287
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:16,150
one must have realizes shri mataji thank

288
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,150
you very much thank

289
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:25,640
you know they are doing one thing doing

290
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,930
one another I was reading an article

291
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,050
just now where you were talking about

292
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:32,660
inner peace and outer peace this seems

293
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,670
to be something that attracts the

294
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:43,720
attention of people in this present

295
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:48,140
stressful age my realization what have

296
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,230
you become a person and out with

297
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,560
thoughtless awareness

298
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:57,470
that means you see everything you

299
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:02,890
witness everything and whenever you want

300
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:07,630
to say or to think you can see about it

301
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:20,090
but you don't react there's no reaction

302
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:24,110
so you are empowered to see it in such a

303
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:29,680
manner that there need not be any

304
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:32,960
thought just the whole creation actually

305
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:37,430
it's a very subtle thing is to be

306
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:40,130
experienced and that is the point where

307
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:43,370
we realize that we are the source of

308
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,800
peace and that's how our inner peace is

309
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,960
established now people have many

310
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,240
foundations of peace I have known all of

311
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,600
them they have no peace within

312
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,190
themselves some people have got peace

313
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,100
Awards there are horribly hot-tempered

314
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:03,380
people but they have got to be some odds

315
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:05,270
Nobel Prizes the peace has to be first

316
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:11,360
of all found inside and then it

317
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:14,090
manifests outside you know the another

318
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,830
question we wanted to ask you is because

319
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:20,959
of this rather useful way you use your

320
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:23,870
hands to describe the movement of the

321
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,209
chakra when they when they they part I

322
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,820
wonder if you could just explain why

323
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:29,390
when illness occurs it occurs because of

324
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,340
the

325
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,789
the movement away of one center from

326
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,470
another alright what I try to show them

327
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:38,840
that this is the left side this is the

328
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,970
right side this is the left sympathetic

329
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,519
nervous system say and this is the right

330
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:46,610
sympathetic nervous system and really

331
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:49,909
spinal cord looks like this and inside

332
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:53,419
here is the spinal cord which has the

333
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:56,299
centers in it the subtle centers now

334
00:17:53,419 --> 00:18:00,169
when you start using the energy of these

335
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:03,590
centers say too much on the right and it

336
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:06,080
starts moving more towards the right and

337
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,980
there's a constriction and the power

338
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,970
becomes less because you are exhausting

339
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,909
going more towards the right side

340
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:17,000
suddenly something happens and from the

341
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:19,789
left if there's a jerk then the

342
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,279
connection is completely broken this is

343
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:25,340
on its own it starts working on its own

344
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:28,279
that's what you say that this has become

345
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:31,010
malignant I have no relationship with

346
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,409
the whole to have the proportionate

347
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:36,440
growth so if the nose starts developing

348
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:38,990
it can cover your eyes and govern your

349
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,840
mouth everything this is how a cancer is

350
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,419
setting or any other disease there's so

351
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,299
many psychosomatic diseases are nothing

352
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:50,299
but somatic he is from the right side

353
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:52,789
and when the psyche gives in then it

354
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:55,340
becomes a psychosomatic disease there

355
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:59,389
are so many diseases which are more

356
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:02,210
psychosomatic than physical and these we

357
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:05,720
call them as incurable can be easily

358
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:08,299
cured by Kundalini awakening because

359
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,669
when Kundalini passes through this she

360
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:13,059
just integrates them for example she is

361
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:17,389
going like this then she goes into this

362
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:21,769
integrates them just like she strings

363
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:24,620
them like pearls and so they are brought

364
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:27,130
down and also she nourishes that Center

365
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,330
that's what people get cured

366
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:35,950
automatically by themselves by their own

367
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:38,710
power Shri Mataji you ready

368
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,500
she mythology do you want to speak to

369
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,870
the IBC in Adelaide afternoon or would

370
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:51,730
you rather that I rang them and said

371
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:54,250
you're too busy abrupt yes I've been a

372
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:58,120
lot of problems there abrupt and also

373
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:59,560
very flippant I don't think they said

374
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,970
they wanted to talk to you about false

375
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:09,700
gurus and woke a few seconds what just

376
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:10,990
do what all right they've been having a

377
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,380
little trouble this morning you know we

378
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:16,330
have banners to put up announcing your

379
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,280
program tonight and they we had them on

380
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:20,620
various bridges and I kept chasing them

381
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:25,990
away but we finally found a place where

382
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:30,220
they've allowed them to stay another

383
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:32,740
piece that must be busy with big exits

384
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,110
oh yes it's all very reserved places for

385
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,640
addictions yes also if it was for the

386
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,550
election it would be able to go up

387
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,520
anywhere but if it's anything else

388
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:46,200
they're not so happy

389
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,200
that's was the attention enough
