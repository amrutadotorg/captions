About Indian Sages
Aurangabad, India, 19 December 1989

2
00:00:06,563 --> 00:00:09,487
So now most of you are here,

3
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:21,425
and it’s a nice place for all of you
to meet from different countries.

4
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:27,976
Aurangabad has a special significance in my own life

5
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:34,581
because my forefathers came from
 a place very near from here,

6
00:00:34,606 --> 00:00:39,250
called as Pathan
but originally known as Pratishthan.

7
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:44,634
I think about two years back we were there,

8
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:52,812
and this is the place where Valmiki,
 who wrote the great epic of Ramayana,

9
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:59,604
lived here. And when Sita came,

10
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:07,177
was taken away from her house

11
00:01:07,412 --> 00:01:10,585
and when she was pregnant,

12
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:16,713
 there was another ashram of his in Nepal where she stayed,

13
00:01:17,372 --> 00:01:21,422
and then she was brought here.

14
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:26,980
That’s why you see a kind of a

15
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,308
culture of Maharashtra, going to the hills
and also to Nepal, through her

16
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:45,080
and her children who went down,
went to Russia and another to China.

17
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:50,656
 The name of one who went to Russia
was Luv,

18
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:54,085
and another who went to China was Kush.

19
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,942
 So they are called as Slavs.

20
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:59,574
They were mostly called as Lev,

21
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:03,892
and those who went to China
are called as Kusha.

22
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:08,171
So they lived here from their birth

23
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:12,057
till they became about, say, twelve years of age,

24
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:15,849
 when Valmiki composed Ramayana

25
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:21,053
and taught them how to sing that song of Ramayana.

26
00:02:21,196 --> 00:02:24,766
So then they went to Ayodhya

27
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,716
 and there they started singing the song.

28
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:32,468
With that singing, Shri Rama was very much touched.

29
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:37,301
They challenged him in a way, that
 there is a lady who was such a chaste person,

30
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:44,153
 who was driven out of - they didn’t know 
that was Rama was their father.

31
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:51,113
Then they came back and stayed here

32
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:57,619
for some time and then went again to Nepal 
because  she was a Nepali lady.

33
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:02,725
 So I think her father must have arranged 
something for her to stay in Nepal

34
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:09,112
 in that Valmiki ashram,
which can be only approached from Bihar,

35
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:11,716
which I have seen Myself.

36
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:19,704
Also that’s a very important spot where
this ashram was established by Valmiki,

37
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:23,545
because here there was a big struggle of evolution

38
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,092
 going on between the big animals like mammoth

39
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:30,143
and all those big, big animals,

40
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,701
between the others who were very quick to turn

41
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:39,735
and were very clever, intelligent and supple.

42
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:43,627
They destroyed most of these big animals.

43
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:49,992
And in that river there were lots of crocodiles,

44
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:57,016
and when the king of the elephant, known as Gajendra,

45
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,920
 was drinking in water, one of them, a big one,

46
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:06,985
attacked to kill him so that the whole clan,

47
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:13,001
 or you can say the whole genii
of these elephants, would be destroyed.

48
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:17,796
That spot is very important

49
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:20,384
because there Shri Vishnu appeared

50
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:23,785
and he killed the crocodile and saved the elephant.

51
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,482
So out of all these
big animals, only the elephant was saved,

52
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:31,907
and that’s why that place is called as Gajendramoksh.

53
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:36,781
So there’s a big quarrel going on because 
Valmiki had his ashrams in different places,

54
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:39,446
 where [was real of Valmiki’s things].

55
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:43,203
 But actually he lived here in this area

56
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,340
on the other side of the Godavari River

57
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:53,793
which was going along the

58
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,986
Paithan or the Pratishthan, the kingdom of Shalivana.

59
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,598
And he used to plunder people and he was a plunderer.

60
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:07,949
 He was a fisherman and he was a plunderer.

61
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,646
Then from there they say Narada came as a
saint from there,

62
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:17,333
 from the other side, and they plundered him also.

63
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:21,075
So he said ,“Why are you plundering me?” Narada asked.

64
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,329
He said, “Because I have to feed my children.
I have to feed my wife.

65
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:28,161
I have to feed my family. I have to look after them.

66
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:31,435
I have a large family. So how am I to maintain all that?

67
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,392
 I am the only person who is the earning member. “

68
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,692
But he said, “Do you think 
they will sacrifice everything for you?”

69
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:40,580
He said, “I am sure they will.”
He said, “All right."

70
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:44,120
 Now you become like a dead man.”

71
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:48,067
And they took his dead body, so-called, four of them,

72
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:51,210
 four saints, and put it in the house

73
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:56,108
and told them that this fellow died in plundering us.

74
00:05:56,156 --> 00:06:00,968
 “But there is a way to again bring him to life,

75
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:05,433
 that you have to promise that somebody from you,

76
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:09,238
you all, have to die in his place.

77
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:16,263
If you agree that you will die in his place,
then one person has to replace him.”

78
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:20,608
They tried and tried.

79
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:24,087
And somebody said, “No, I cannot die. I am too young.”

80
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:26,987
Another said,“No, I have to look after my children.”

81
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:31,893
Another said, “What will happen to my grandchildren?”
all kinds of things.

82
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,275
And nobody offered themselves.

83
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,021
So Valmiki got up and he realised that so far

84
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:43,920
he has been really doing something wrong.

85
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:48,106
So he said then, “What should I say?”

86
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:50,580
He said, “What would you say then if you
die?”

87
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:53,249
He said, “I’ll say, ‘Mara, mara’,” means,

88
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:55,314
 ‘I am dead. I am dead. I am dead’.”

89
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,894
He said, “All right, say the other way.

90
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,653
 Go on saying.” So it came to,
 “Rama, Rama,” like that.

91
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:02,591
But they said, “It won’t work out.

92
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,596
You have to do a penance

93
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:07,929
because you have done lots of bad things in your life

94
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:10,442
and you have hurt many people.

95
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,966
 So you have to do the penance.”

96
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,658
So he sat down for penance on a big mountain here

97
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:23,025
which is called as the Valmiki Mountain.

98
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:27,214
And the termites ate up his body,

99
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:29,311
and he became like a termite.

100
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:31,582
Only his neck was up and he was saying that

101
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:34,849
and the whole body was eaten up by termites.

102
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:38,175
So then again Shri Vishnu appeared before him

103
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,420
 and removed his termites and gave him his realisation.

104
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:46,860
 And a termite in Sanskrit language is called as valmi.

105
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:49,500
That’s why he was called as valmi ki. That’s why

106
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,818
he was called as Valmiki.

107
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:59,548
So the story then afterwards leads
 to the coming of Sita there.

108
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:04,100
So it is a very important part of Ramayana was played here,

109
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:08,066
 and it is said that Shalivahanas helped

110
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:13,843
this Valmiki temple and Valmiki person to prosper,

111
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:18,464
 and they treated him with great respect as their master.

112
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:22,469
 But actually, their master was long 
time back was one Chandalia

113
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:27,076
 where we have taken the land near Nira River.

114
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:31,575
 So it’s a very ancient time thousands of years back

115
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,704
because Rama must have lived before Krishna,
say about eight thousand years back.

116
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:41,395
 So it is a very ancient place, this one is.

117
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,376
After that people removed all the trees and all that.

118
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:46,852
 So it has become such a barren land

119
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:54,678
and it is not sort of so fertile now,

120
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:58,893
 but once upon a time it was a beautiful forest here

121
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:03,490
 and in that forest Valmiki used to live.

122
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:05,878
So this is the story of this place, I hope

123
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:10,146
 you will be happy to know you are in a very 
historical place just now.

124
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:13,462
 And I am trying to find out if you can on your way go to

125
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,710
also to this Paithan, Pratishthan

126
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:18,718
on your way, maybe. I don’t know how,

127
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,010
because we are all running short of time

128
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:24,059
because of aeroplane timings, as you know.

129
00:09:24,076 --> 00:09:27,844
But in any case I am very happy
that also Italians have arrived,

130
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:30,793
 and they have taken so much trouble to come all the way

131
00:09:30,818 --> 00:09:33,846
directly from there to get to the puja.

132
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:38,734
Though I had arranged in Pratishthan
 all their food, everything, breakfast,

133
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,808
so they could sleep in the night and early in the morning

134
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:45,222
take the food and come here.

135
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,803
All these stories these
people know very well.

136
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:52,976
We all know everything about our country,
 these ancient times,

137
00:09:53,001 --> 00:10:00,434
 you see, grand, beautiful, and the 
work of all these saints and all these

138
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:08,737
seers has woven into the character of Maharashtran people.

139
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:13,702
 So you will find them that they have certain gifts

140
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:18,639
already to protect themselves,
which has come because of the

141
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:26,445
 following of these saints and 
the following of a realised soul.

142
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:29,164
And the people are very God-fearing

143
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:34,919
and they respect saints and 
they also know who is a real saint mostly.

144
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:41,311
I hope you all will understand that

145
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:45,128
when we think of the comfort of our spirit,

146
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:49,659
 the whole life is sort of penetrated 
with the light of the spirit,

147
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:52,806
 and we start changing our attitude towards life.

148
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:57,692
 Not only that, but also we have a kind of a

149
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:02,246
 tremendous confidence in our virtues 
and we enjoy them.

150
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:07,147
We do not indulge into any such thing.

151
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,452
 Though in a way we can say that the,

152
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:15,170
 in this culture there is not much of finesse, 
not much of artificiality.

153
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:18,615
They won’t say thank you a hundred times.
 That is not done.

154
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:20,226
They don’t say sorry.

155
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:23,142
They won’t even fold their hands to normally,

156
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:26,587
 the women especially to men, and say namaskar.

157
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:29,251
Only to God they fold their hands.

158
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:31,656
So there are certain things, that

159
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:34,367
 all the time we go on shaking hands in the West.

160
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:37,789
All the time we start bowing to everyone, saying sorry,

161
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:39,537
 thank you and all that.

162
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,263
That you will find they don’t do,

163
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:44,661
 but at heart they are very simple people.

164
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:49,574
 They live among rocks; so they
have that rocky character.

165
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:51,710
 And I hope you will enjoy them.

166
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:54,167
May God bless you.
