00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:15.240
Tonight we had decided to talk about Creation
but our management has not been able to provide

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:27.180
me with a chalk and with a blackboard so,
I don’t know, I’ll try to explain it without

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.180
drawing.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.099
It’s a very difficult subject.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:40.550
And I’ll try to make it intelligible.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:01:05.760
But I would request you to pay full attention
for such a difficult subject like Creation.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:16.580
The greatest blessing today is that many of
you can feel the vibrations.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:25.440
And not only that but you also know and realise
that they can think and they can love.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.090
It’s a very big blessing.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.750
Of course, some of you haven’t got it, but
those who have got it know that these vibrations

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.130
organise, because they raise the Kundalini,
they go to the place where it is needed, out

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.900
of compassion, to that portion where there
is deficiency.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.870
They understand, they organise they are universal
in nature and they love.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:59.979
They answer to your questions, when you ask
them some questions – you receive answer

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.710
from them.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.180
They are living vibrations.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.319
These vibrations are from the Divine.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:24.900
This Divine is called as Brahma, Brahma Tattwa,
Principle of Divine.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:39.109
We can say that the process of Creation is
an eternal process.

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.450
Means a seed becomes a tree and the tree becomes
a seed, and the seed becomes a tree, and it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.529
goes on and on – it’s eternal.

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:51.969
So, it cannot have a starting point and it
cannot have an ending point.

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.760
It goes on and on and on.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.499
That’s why it can have different states
of existence, you can say, state of being.

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:07.430
So, the first, just the being, is Brahma,
where nothing exists.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.430
We say ‘nothing’.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:17.299
When we say nothing, it is a relative word:
because we do not exist, so we say ‘nothing

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.519
exists’ – it’s a relative word.

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.879
When we are not existing, for us everything
is ‘nothing’.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:26.879
There is something, but that is not ourselves.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:33.849
And that’s why, relatively, we say it is
‘nothing’.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.079
It’s only the word Brahma, we can say.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:47.790
You can think of an energy, if you want to,
an energy-form that exists.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:04:00.689
But the energy accumulates at a point and
forms a nucleus.

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:12.379
The energy that thinks, energy that is distributed,
accumulates at a point, concentrates on a

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:20.910
point, you can say, and this point is the
point we call as Sadashiva.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.450
This happens because that energy desires,
thinks, organises, loves.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:41.990
When it wants to create, when the desire is
felt in that energy to create, at that time

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.480
a nucleus is created.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.120
This nucleus we call as Sadashiva.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.880
This nucleus does not disappear.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.890
You can think of a nebula.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.540
I mean, it is something which is all relative
you can think, you cannot think something

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.760
in absolute form.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.190
So, with thinking you cannot conceptualise
the whole thing, but if you can think of a

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:16.020
state, where it’s just an energy and no
creation.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.110
But not the energy of electricity, magnetism
– all these things.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:26.080
Is the combination, the synthesis of all the
things which goes into laya which becomes

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.740
that, dissolves into that.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:44.580
It coagulates on a point, that may be a [suitable]
word, coagulates at a point which we can call

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.580
as a nucleus.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.710
This point we call as Sadashiva.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:05.050
This Sadashiva is the Ishwara, is the God
Almighty.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.410
We call it now “God” because now it has
a limitation.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.300
In the sense that we can call it something.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.340
But if it is just an energy we just call it
a Brahma.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:26.170
You can say like this: when the water becomes
ice, a follicle of ice is formed, you can

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:34.250
differentiate between the water and the ice,
but still, it’s a relative, relative understanding.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:45.680
At this state God Almighty, Parameshwara,
takes its form as an identity.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:53.120
That’s why we can say that it is not Brahma,
but an identity.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.620
Identity has its aura, has its aura, we can
say, its light.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.720
This light is the Divine Love.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:15.230
It goes into various forms but Sadashiva remains
as He is.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:28.120
Now, the desire to create is transferred to
the aura.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:36.700
The aura is the Power of God, Shakti.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:45.730
Ishwara has certain things beyond Him also
and before Him.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:55.150
God Almighty has something beyond Him that
He cannot control: one, He cannot control

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.800
His eternal nature.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.760
It is His nature to be eternal, He cannot
stop it.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:08.730
He will go on changing His form, it is His
nature, it just… it is His swabhava.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.940
He cannot change it, His eternal nature.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.940
He will be eternally.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:16.169
Eternity is His temperament, His nature, He
cannot overcome that.

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:26.400
For example, God cannot take away your freedom
to choose the Truth.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400
He cannot.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.880
Once He has granted, He’s not going to take
it away.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.889
You have to choose it in all your freedom.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:37.490
He will not force you to take it.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.550
Many people have hopes like that – they
are sadly mistaken.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:46.850
At this juncture only lies the problem of
complete destruction or complete resurrection.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:52.769
It is left into the hands of human beings
to decide whether they want to accept the

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:57.360
Truth or if they want to follow the falsehood.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.249
So, you have [been] given complete freedom
to choose.

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:08.540
I won’t go into the details about God Almighty,
because it’s a very subtler subject and

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.910
requires much more attention.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:16.560
I have talked about it before to many people
and all His nature, they know that.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:24.449
But He is the Witness, He is the Sakshi (witness)
in the form of a Sakshi.

00:09:24.449 --> 00:09:25.519
What is He witnessing?

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:29.370
He is witnessing the Creation.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:35.819
And the power that creates the Creation is
the Shakti, is His power, is His consort.

00:09:35.819 --> 00:09:46.079
Now, for us, human beings, we don’t understand
that a wife and a husband could be that one

00:09:46.079 --> 00:09:47.079
(unified).

00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:51.920
For example, you can understand like a Sun
and a sunlight, Moon and the Moonlight – as

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.269
these two things are one and the same.

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:57.339
Or the meaning and the word.

00:09:57.339 --> 00:09:58.910
In the same way, Shiva and Shakti are one
together.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:05.209
For example, you can be a father, you can
be a mother.

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:13.119
You can be a father, you can be a brother,
you can be a son – three things you are

00:10:13.119 --> 00:10:14.360
doing together.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.029
In the same way, you can be your Self and
your power.

00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:24.050
You know: you and your Self and your power
are different, but you are one.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.560
You have a power to write, but you are not
your power.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.370
Neither your power is your Self.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:41.300
In the same way, Shiva and Shakti are two
persons to be identified, but they are part

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.470
and parcel of one uniform thing known as ‘Brahma’.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:54.459
But these horrible Tantrikas – again they
come round here – have spoiled the relationship

00:10:54.459 --> 00:10:57.230
between Shiva and Shakti.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.100
Not that they were human beings, that’s
why they established all these funny ideas

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.160
and talked about these nonsensical things.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.240
Because they are the people who are nothing
but their sex-points.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.490
They are nothing nobler than that.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.180
They are very depraved and diseased and debased
people.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.880
They suffer from such a terrible disease that
no way they can see anything else but this.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.550
Ashvameda has also described as something
to do with sex.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.809
Everything they look, they see sex there.

00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:31.319
It’s like a person, as we call it in Hindi
– [HINDI 13:00 mins] – who is wearing

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:35.899
the glass of sex and watching through that
life, everything becomes sex, sex, sex, they

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:40.350
are such debased and horrible depraved people,
even God, they are bringing to that level.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:47.790
Unless and until they are bringing to that
level, they cannot exist.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.850
How will they justify themselves, the way
they are?

00:11:50.850 --> 00:12:00.000
Sex has nothing to do with Shiva and Shakti.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.619
What is Sun and sunlight?

00:12:01.619 --> 00:12:05.399
Is there any sex involved there?

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:07.380
Is there nothing existing without sex for
these horrible tantrikas?

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:13.589
Is there no relationship that exists without
sex?

00:12:13.589 --> 00:12:25.040
So, Shiva is the God Almighty – we should
call him as Sadashiva.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.639
I’ll try to draw a little bit, let us see
how it works out.

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:33.910
Now forming into a nucleus like this.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:42.809
Now, this is the remains of the nucleus, you
can say, which forms its power here into a

00:12:42.809 --> 00:12:43.809
valaya.

00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:46.160
How does it form?

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.230
He moves supposing backwards, you can say.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:13:00.700
Then what happens when he moves backwards…kara
noko (marathi: don’t do that)…this, whole

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:17.990
thing like this, remains here and all of this
passes, forms a shell around it and the waves

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:27.069
cross over and settle onto the shell – here.

00:13:27.069 --> 00:13:40.679
Now, this is the situation: when all inside
forms another nucleus here by concentration

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:44.139
– this is the Shakti.

00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:45.139
And this is the Sadashiva.

00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:51.480
This is the Mahashakti, you can say ‘Adi
Shakti’ and this is the Sadashiva.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:14:05.749
Now here, Shiva, once the Shakti forms Her
personality, or we can say, Her ego is established,

00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:08.110
She is a different identity from Shiva.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:13.959
Because the whole process is to create the
play for the witness to see.

00:14:13.959 --> 00:14:16.869
He is the One who is going to watch the play.

00:14:16.869 --> 00:14:19.759
She is the One who is going to create it.

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:28.860
So, She accumulates Her ego onto a point here
and becomes Shakti, assumes a position there.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:39.350
And the first thing She does as a Shakti is
to go round in a parabolic…in a parabola

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.179
around Her Lord.

00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:44.879
This point one must understand.

00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:48.839
She is a Shakti, is the Power of God.

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:54.379
And the whole Creation is only meant for God
Almighty to be seen.

00:14:54.379 --> 00:14:59.339
He’s the only spectator of the play of Shakti.

00:14:59.339 --> 00:15:03.779
And if He doesn’t like the play, for example,
He doesn’t like the way it is or the way

00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:10.279
people are that are created, He can immediately
stop the play by closing His eyes, by denying

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:17.220
the play, by showing His annoyance or by His
stopper, He can just stop it.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.649
That’s why He is also called as a destroyer.

00:15:20.649 --> 00:15:22.540
But the whole thing is meant for His amusement.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.870
And if it doesn’t give Him pleasure, He
can stop it.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:33.760
That’s why the first one who must be pleased
is the One who is the spectator.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:48.970
Because of this, Shiva is garlanded by Her,
is a parabola and that’s why parabola is

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.860
the symbol of Adi Shakti.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:59.461
This is sort of a certificate to Her, a sort
of a granting Her the varadan, as we call

00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:02.600
it in Sanskrit language, is the varadan that
‘go ahead with your work.’

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.749
This is a sanction given to Him.

00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:11.519
When She completes this parabola, the sanction
has been granted and that’s why She is a

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:12.519
parabola.

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:16.869
Here the question of men dominating the women
and women dominating the men does not come

00:16:16.869 --> 00:16:19.269
in, because this is predominantly in our heads,
you see.

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:24.089
When we think of it, we think of men and women,
it is nothing of the kind.

00:16:24.089 --> 00:16:25.470
It’s just complete Oneness.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:29.600
Can we think of one couple which is absolutely
united with each other?

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.670
We cannot.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.550
Because we are all incomplete people.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.920
But if you could stretch your imagination
to such a point that both of them are meant

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:44.829
for each other only and the One who is active,
is the Adi Shakti, is only active to please

00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:53.989
the God Almighty Who is the only spectator
of Her play and He’s to be pleased first.

00:16:53.989 --> 00:16:59.540
So, She surrenders Herself before Him, takes
the sanction through the parabola.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.869
Now, parabola is a very important thing.

00:17:02.869 --> 00:17:08.320
You know that everything travels through parabola,
never in a straight line.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:14.050
For example, if you love someone, our love
goes round that person and comes back to us

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.800
as love.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:22.680
But if you hate that person, then our hatred
goes round that person and comes back to us

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.340
as a terrible hatred.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:31.830
So, the parabola is taken, but you might say
‘why a parabola?’

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:36.280
The question can be: “Why should there be
a parabola and not a circle?”

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:43.860
The reason is: parabola is the shortest distance
to go round another point, is the shortest.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.860
And that’s why it’s a parabola.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:54.510
It is even in our ordinary life, you will
find this happening: that whatever you do

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:59.550
to others, it comes back to you in some form,
whether you do good or bad.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:06.160
And that’s why our karmic ideas and that
of our doing punyas are all there.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.160
Because whatever we emit through us, will
come back to us.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.620
In the same way, if you bless the whole world,
the blessings of the whole world will come

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.040
to us.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:24.960
As I told you, the process is not that simple
as it can be drawn, because it’s a living

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:32.240
process of a big dimension but I’m just
trying to make it simpler for you to understand.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:42.650
Now, this parabola, when, here now, when She
is, She goes into the motion of a parabola

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:49.300
and Shiva sanctioned Her, sanctions Her – it’s
a living process, again you must understand,

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.890
it’s a living process, it’s as human as
we are.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.770
Both of them are as human as we are, we should
say, they are thousand times more human than

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:57.770
we are.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:05.660
So, here the Wife, His Consort, says that:
“I am very happy just like this.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.150
I won’t go any further with it."

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.630
Because Creation is not an easy thing for
Her, She doesn’t want to depart from Her

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:14.630
Creation.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:22.700
Creation is the child and She says, “I would
not like to have children now, because I will

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.700
lose you."

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:31.170
So, She pushes Herself towards Him and He
pushes Her back and disappears, opening out

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.980
from here.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:38.410
Now She is in this form.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:42.870
So, the beginning of the Om starts.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:48.320
Parabola, first of all, gets converted into
Om.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:59.850
Then She pushes Herself down and settles down
for a while to meditate and to find out how

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.170
She is going to work it out, we can say like
this.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.860
You see, it is Her desire which must be aroused.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.990
If Her desire is not aroused, She will not
conceive the Creation.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.230
So, a kalpa is spent in that.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:17.350
Quite a lot of time is spent in Her own thinking
– which way She should do it.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.850
She has created many universes.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.140
It is not one universe She has created.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.230
She has created universes after universes
and I will show you how She has created so

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.230
many universes.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.250
And some of them are still lingering on, some
of them are destroyed.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:34.360
But today before us: this Universe, this Earth,
on this Earth, India and in India, Delhi,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.260
you are sitting attending this place.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.260
It’s like that.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.490
So, at this moment, whatever is the thing,
is not the past, nor the future, but I’m

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.190
telling you about the present moment we are
here.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.620
But many universes have been created by Adi
Shakti; even before us.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.240
And She has tried many other things also.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.140
Ultimately She has tried this.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.030
She has created Earth and then created us.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.930
Now, how She has done that we’ll see later
on.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:05.820
Just now let us see how She assumes her powers.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:18.460
When She decides to create, She is endowed
with three powers: She has three powers of

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.720
God which are granted to Her.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.570
By one power, first of all, is the existence,
the desire to exist, She desires to exist

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.790
with God.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:41.750
The second power is to create and the third
power is to sustain.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:52.720
First power is existence, second is to create
and the third is the evolving power or sustenance

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.770
power by which gradually you sustain something
and you become something.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:00.700
These are the three powers She assumes.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:09.980
In short, we can say that She forms three
powers of Mahakali, Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.650
These are the three powers She assumes within
Herself.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.980
Now, She uses again Her parabolic systems.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:23.930
You know, supposing, I have come to this house
by this way, I know this way.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:24.990
Then I take that way, I know that way.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.890
I know the middle way, everything.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:31.250
Now, I know these three ways and I know all
about it: with that knowledge, I can do something

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.250
else.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:37.510
So, She again uses Her parabolic movements.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:45.091
Actually, Her three movements, of Mahakali,
Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati, are all the

00:22:45.091 --> 00:22:48.740
time with Her, with the Adi Shakti.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:53.180
She can separate them and put them into three
different channels.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.980
She can combine them and synthesise them and
use it as a parabola – you understand this?

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:03.490
That’s why when we put a bandhan to you,
we say “put a parabola,” is a parabola,

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.550
because the vibrations are all in… all the
three powers are flowing this way.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:16.950
So, we have got, you know that, three powers
– the Mahakali power you can say, I need

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:17.950
not write, “Mahakali power”.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:22.680
By Mahakali power She desires, as I’ve told
you, is the emotional side of God, you can

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.680
say.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.560
She represents the emotional side of God,
She desires.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.600
Is the desire is that of God.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.000
God Almighty, Who is the spectator, He is
the Sakshi.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.080
And She puts that Sakshi into your heart,
She reflects that into your heart which is

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.000
kept all the time burning to watch what you
are doing.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.380
To see your play after your creation.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:56.540
Her Mahasaraswati power, now, moves in a parabola.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:11.970
She can move in any angle, 360 angles She
can move, from one point.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:17.610
Sometimes, She goes round and round at a point.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:29.250
When She goes round and round at a point,
Her Mahasaraswati power can get consolidated;

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.840
you can say, it becomes dense.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:37.190
You see, that’s the trouble with English
language!

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:51.430
It becomes dense, it becomes so very dense
that it cracks out.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:58.110
These cracks occur due to the momentum of
the movement of the Mahakali power, Mahasaraswati

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.110
power.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:04.380
Because it is moving in a round and round
fashion, they also get into the momentum of

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.230
that movement, they start moving.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:10.150
For example, this part starts moving, this
part starts moving, this part starts moving.

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:16.250
And when they start moving, they become rounds,
they lose their angularities and then they

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.380
become round.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:24.730
Now I’m telling you, very much in short
because it’s a…they become round.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:28.910
These rounds again are put into friction with
each other.

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:32.880
And that is how, we can say – now forget
about other universes, where other styles

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.010
were also created – but about this one we
can say, was created.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:42.130
Now, you must all the time remember that this
Power thinks, understands, organises, loves

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.240
and is an identity.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.440
So, She creates the Earth.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.930
Earth is not created so easily.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:59.320
Part of the Sun is removed just like this,
with the hand, you can say.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.700
We must understand why the Sun became so cold.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:11.070
Sun is, from the Sun it is removed very much
far away first, to the farthest point so that

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.150
it freezes completely.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:16.590
Also like Moon, it was taken very far away.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:21.640
It just freezes completely and is then brought
near the Sun again, like a pendulum.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:27.490
It is moved again towards the cold side, again
it is brought to the hot side.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:34.620
It is brought to a point, to the medium point
where Earth is made, is made – again I’m

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:39.490
saying, it’s not a chance of nature – is
made deliberately, habitable for human beings,

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.250
the temperature was brought in.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:47.710
It has been done by Adi Shakti, the Mother.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:53.600
She has done it deliberately, it’s not easy
to conceive of such a Mother.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.350
But She has done it.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:00.860
And She brings this Earth to a point where
life can begin.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:10.050
So the combination of Moon and the combination
of Sun gives you hydrogen from the Moon, oxygen

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.910
from the sun, gives you water, the freezing
and heating.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:19.050
The freezing and heating gives you the water.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:25.310
In the water, when the Earth is made, spirally,
to move upward, again the heating and cooling

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.310
starts.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:37.030
By heating and cooling, life comes into being
as amino-acids.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.030
Is done deliberately!

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:42.050
What I am saying: it is not done by something,
by chance.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.800
On this also one has to think once: “How
is it?”

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.800
It is not chance!

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:51.555
If you read Du Nouy [Pierre Lecomte Du Nouy
(1883-1947)] , is a very big biologist, I

00:27:51.555 --> 00:27:55.180
mean, I think he’s one of the greatest biologists
who has really gone into the calculations

00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:10.530
of how much time should it take for a simple
amoeba to be created out of the matter and

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:15.429
he has calculated that it should take much
more time than even what we have had so far

00:28:15.429 --> 00:28:19.740
– billions of billions of years are needed
just by chance.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:24.270
Law of chance is there, which I don’t know
if I should tell you elaborately, but law

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:33.330
of chance is that, if you have in one tube
50 red pebbles and 50 white pebbles and if

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:40.280
you start shaking them and make them absolutely
in a chaotic order, it takes so much, so much

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:47.030
times shaking to make it again the same as
it is, or to bring it into order.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:58.260
So, even to create an orderly living protoplasm,
a cell, would have taken much more time than

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.690
it has taken so far: much more, many times
more, billions of billions.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:08.560
And it has taken only 5 billion years for
Earth to secede from the Moon.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.780
And only 2 billion years for it to cool down.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:17.490
So, he says, it is beyond any understanding
– only thing that can explain it, what we

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:19.600
can say, is that there is a ‘Juggler’
behind it.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.720
And there is a Juggler, about which our great
rishis and munis know that – that Juggler

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.470
is nobody else but Adi Shakti, the Primordial
Mother.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.280
The Primordial Father is Sadashiva and the
Primordial Mother is Adi Shakti.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.780
And are we going to discuss about their sex?

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:40.190
Are we going to do that way with the tantrikas?

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:45.430
Is that the way to pay homage to your parents?

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:50.310
We have to understand that it’s a very,
very solemn subject, we are discussing here

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:54.920
the sanctum sanctorium of the love of our
Primordial Parents.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.580
It’s a very, very holy thing.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:03.590
We are not holy people, we are yet full of
lots of greed and lust, but they are above

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:04.590
everything.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:08.120
So, when we are discussing them, we have to
know, we have to do it with great shraddha,

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:15.300
and with our head bowed before them that it
is our luck and we are very fortunate that

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:22.370
we have been able to learn something about
these two Primordial Parents who have brought

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:28.480
forth this Creation, their child.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:39.280
So, one of these then again cracks and becomes
a surya-mandal, and a surya-mandala has got,

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:46.920
as you know, Earth and Moon and all these
things and I have told you how Earth is created.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:57.010
After the Creation of Earth, first, you know
that amino-acids were formed, the vegetation

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.460
started and then the human being started.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.990
Now, the matter, also, is a very systematic
thing.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.270
Matter is not unsystematic, it is systematic,
but it is not organised – there is difference

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.441
between the two.

00:31:10.441 --> 00:31:12.970
The systematic things are dead, can be dead.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:19.920
You can put five stones here in a systematic
manner, but they are not organised, because

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.980
they are not living things.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.830
There’s a difference between the two.

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.990
So, first, the systematic things were laid
down.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:35.750
Perhaps, if you know about the…Eight different
types of elements were created.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:44.420
These were created and were put into proper
places through Shri Ganesha.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:57.250
You know that the carbon… carbon is in the
centre of these periodical elements that appear.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:04.790
That means a element which has got one valency,
two valency, three valency and four valency,

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:09.880
the three are the plus ones, then you’ve
got one C, carbon, which has got four valences.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:18.430
Then you have got, again, minus one, two,
three and four – is a complete eight.

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:25.600
Like that, the whole matter has been organised.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:32.830
To organise the matter, some deity was to
be created for that, and first deity that

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.600
was created was that of Shri Ganesh.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:45.140
Let us see now how She created here.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:54.930
You have seen that one part of Her, which
is the Mahasaraswati, has created the matter.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:59.180
Mahasaraswati has created the matter.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.980
Now, Mahakali has to give them existence.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.550
How do you get an existence?

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:09.090
Is through your sustenance or, you can say,
through your quality – whatever you are.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:18.010
So, Mahakali gives that existence to those
material things, not human beings or living

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:32.400
things but matter, through a deity known as
Shri Ganesh.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:38.290
Mahakali…

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:42.590
In the heart of the Viraata, as you see, – you’ll
see Viraata also He comes in, because that

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:48.200
I will tell you later on – but in the heart
of Viraata, is the Primordial Being, the complete

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.309
Primordial Being, the Mahakali is settled
down.

00:33:51.309 --> 00:33:57.040
What She does, She goes three and a half from
the heart: one up, one down like that – three

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.510
and a half times and comes to the end of the
three and a half, down-way.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:03.710
Three and a half.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.030
Now, She comes at the end of it.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:11.090
And if you put three and a half like that
and if you cut it straight, you get 7 centres

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.460
cut in.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:25.220
Is there a drawing person who knows how to
draw?

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:39.380
You should start from like that, you can put
it like this.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:44.550
She comes down here.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:50.730
She comes down here and from here She penetrates.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:55.440
You see, She cuts at seven points here.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:01.720
At this point, She creates the first deity,
little below, of Shri Ganesh.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:06.340
I mean, this is not done in one day, is not
done in one year, not done in one Yuga, it

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.920
is done in many Kalpas.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:16.100
The first step is to create Shri Ganesh, this
is Her abode and She puts Shri Ganesh.

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:20.950
Now, he is emitting his vibrations through
all this.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:25.220
He passes through all this whatever She has
created.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:31.050
On this picture is settled the work of the
Mahasaraswati, you can say.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:35.619
She comes down with all Her programs like
this and She makes it.

00:35:35.619 --> 00:35:37.119
And She gets joined here again.

00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:40.790
So, Shri Ganesh emits His vibrations through
her.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:46.120
First, Shri Mahakali creates Shri Ganesh and
then Mahasaraswati comes down, She creates

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.570
all these things and gets connected to Shri
Ganesh.

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:56.740
So, the vibrations of Shri Ganesh start flowing
through all the creation of Mahasaraswati.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:05.720
Before creating all this, the complete thought
of what is going to happen in future comes

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:10.160
in a clear-cut vision of the Adi Shakti.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.890
And She puts Her plans through.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:17.270
First of all, the Mahalakshmi power comes
down and creates the Shri Ganesh.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:22.360
You can understand now how important it is
that we have to be holy people.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.760
First, She created the holiness on this Earth.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.170
First thing, Her relationship with the child
was established, because the Creation is going

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:33.750
to be created in the image of Her child.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:40.230
That’s why Shri Ganesh was created first.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:45.619
And then from here, say, is the Adi Shakti,
the other power, Mahasaraswati, on Her way,

00:36:45.619 --> 00:36:48.670
She comes down and gets connected with Shri
Ganesh.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:53.810
And that’s how the Shri Ganesh establishes
the relationship and emits His vibrations

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:54.810
through this.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:58.740
Because of His vibrations passing through
the matter that She has created.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:04.780
For example, our Mother Earth: through this
passes the, you know that through it passes

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.780
the axis.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.270
Nobody has seen the axis, but they say, there
is an axis, from the way it moves.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.720
There is a kind of an axis.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:19.020
Now, this is the power of Mahakali passing
through the [axis].

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.390
We can say, it’s the power of Shri Ganesh
passing through the axis of the Mother Earth,

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.940
which has got magnetic power in it.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:32.380
And that’s how, through that, it controls
its speed, its movement, and also it looks

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.380
after us.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:39.730
Why don’t we think that when we put a little
seed in the soil it sprouts, automatically?

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:45.090
You have seen now, many of you who have been
suffering from certain troubles and diseases,

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:48.790
that the Mother Earth herself took down your
problems, She sucked them out.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:55.750
It is a fact, you can see it in Sahaja Yoga,
that after realisation if you have any problem,

00:37:55.750 --> 00:38:00.190
if your head is heavy, if you are a realised
soul, otherwise She doesn’t listen, because

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:06.160
you should be activated or you should be granted
a certificate from the Adi Shakti that you’re

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.290
a realised person, otherwise why should She
accept you?

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:16.660
You just put your head on the soil, put your
both the hands on the Mother Earth and you’ll

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.240
find the whole thing will be sucked out from
your forehead.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.940
It has been done with many, even from the
legs it can take out.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.810
Mother Earth is actually, is the Mother of
Adi Shakti, you can say.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:34.661
She is the Mother, they say, because She is
made in such a way that She takes all the

00:38:34.661 --> 00:38:37.340
weights of the world in Herself.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.961
She controls all the weights of the world
and She can consume all your weight.

00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:41.961
She’s the dharaa.

00:38:41.961 --> 00:38:47.040
Now, weight means everything that… your
weight is what we weigh in: that’s not the

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.040
thing.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.740
Weight means also your sins, also your punyas.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.740
It means everything.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:55.850
If you have too many sins in you, then Mother
Earth feels hurt.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:39:01.730
Wherever there is too much of sin, then Mother
Earth has to ask help.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:07.540
And then some other deity has to, like Vishnu
himself, has to come on this Earth to save

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:11.170
Her from this too much of overloading of sins
upon this Earth.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.170
Is a fact!

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:14.350
It is not I’m telling you a mythical story,
is a fact.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:16.920
Which you have to verify after getting vibrations.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.250
Before getting vibrations, you cannot find
out from the Mother Earth.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:23.580
If you want to find out some time, if you
are realised, you just stand on the Mother

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.560
Earth and ask her “Will you take away my
sins, oh Mother Earth?

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.230
Will you take away my karmas?

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:29.470
I have been realised."

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:31.010
Immediately, She’ll start drawing you.

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:32.010
You’ll be surprised.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:33.350
You’ll feel so much lighter.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:34.540
You have to use Her.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.020
That is how Mother Earth has been created.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:45.270
But also Adi Shakti through Her Mahasaraswati
power has created the five elements.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:49.080
Before everything else, She created tanmatra
(subtle elements) as you call it, I mean,

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.850
if I go into details, it’s going to be too
much for you!

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:54.109
But first of all, the causal essences were
created by Her.

00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:56.240
But if I say like this, there won’t be anything
false.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:04.710
If I say that just by seeing by Her sight,
by her drushti (sight), She has created this

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.690
light.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:13.190
Just by Her breathing, She has created air,
because Her desire is the last point.

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:16.350
Because She desired there should be air, She
created air.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:22.870
Like that, She has, Her smell has created
the causal, gandha, which has created this

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:23.950
mother Earth.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:30.160
And it has started from Her only, from Her
desires, by Her desiring it – it was created

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.930
for Her and that’s how it was created in
the whole Universe, which was later on made

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:39.350
into Earth, Moon, Sun and all these things.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:41.560
Actually, it was Her mere desire which brought
forth these.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:46.620
For us it is impossible to understand someone
like that, who, just by mere desire can create.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:51.880
But when we think of somebody who is above
all the powers of the world, the One the,

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.090
who is the highest of all: She can do anything
She feels like.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:56.740
Can’t we think like that?

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.560
We cannot think of someone like that.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.320
We think of God, who is Almighty, we call
Him, but when we talk of His mights we start

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.320
laughing.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.320
How can it be?

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.320
But She can do anything She wants to.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:10.220
It is only Her mere desire that has brought
forth all these creations and all this things

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.270
that you see in this world are created only
by Her desire.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.830
She created akasha.

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:20.190
She created all these five elements, which
you know, and then She started Her another

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:23.430
form which we call as the Mahalakshmi form.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:28.930
Before that, I think, I should tell you about
Shri Ganesha’s existence in the matter.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:33.150
He acts in the matter as vibrations, as Mahasaraswati
vibrations.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:38.310
They are electromagnetic vibrations, Mahasaraswati
vibrations are electromagnetic vibrations,

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:43.610
we can say, that electromagnetic and also
there is sound, and all these five elements

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:44.690
are expressed in that.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:54.590
You can record them – because if you take
a sulphur dioxide, for example, a sulphur

00:41:54.590 --> 00:42:00.369
dioxide and two oxygen and one sulphur and
if you watch them properly under a very highly

00:42:00.369 --> 00:42:05.820
micro – you can try, I don’t know if people
have tried, but you can try to find out – and

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:13.160
put it under, let’s say, a very highly developed
micro – microwave- microscope, you can say,

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:20.670
you can see that the oxygen things and sulphur,
– sulphur is stationary, – but these two

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:21.670
are vibrating.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:25.120
They are vibrating, there’s a vibration
going between these bonds.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:30.810
They can be isometric also, they can be symmetric,
they can be even, uneven and they can be expanding,

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.080
and closing like that.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.280
So, there are three types of vibrations, we
find.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.351
And the fourth side is nothing but Shri Ganesha
himself who is controlling.

00:42:38.351 --> 00:42:42.940
So, this we can see with our naked eyes, if
you want to see, even if you are realised

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:43.940
or not.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.970
From where do these vibrations come in the
minutest paramanu, as you call, the molecules?

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:53.980
In a molecule, how do you get these vibrations,
can you explain this?

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.220
It is so much, sukshma, parasukshma.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:04.630
The powers of Ganesha are very, very subtle
and they enter into the matter and create

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:11.570
this kind of vibrations, which you can even
see and record, electromagnetic vibrations,

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:18.470
in, even, a one small, little molecule.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:25.800
So, we have in these, as I told you, into
the periodic level, periodic laws of elements,

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.890
you can find out that all the elements are
divided into eight types.

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.150
Just see!

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:34.480
How can all the elements be divided into eight
parts without somebody being there?

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:40.430
Can you do something without organising a
proper chart of these elements?

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.270
Just think about it!

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.040
You see, when we challenge God, we have to
understand that in this world everything is

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:51.440
so well organised, there are eight elements
spread out so well, placed so well.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:56.800
And it has a particular style of behaviour
and every element is different in numbers

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:04.110
and protons and these numbers are very well
calculated in such a manner that the end of

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:10.890
it, that the last circle, that the last circle
of all the protons should be eight.

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:17.130
If it is not eight, if it is less than eight
then it creates a valency problem.

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.820
It is so well organised, then, even if you
study this, if there is anybody who knows

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:24.540
little bit of chemistry, you know, so if you
know chemistry, it’s such a wonderful thing.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.540
We take it for granted!

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.619
We think it is our right to have the matter
so well organised for us!

00:44:28.619 --> 00:44:33.760
But the valencies are all depending on such
a nice organisation of this eight protons

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.200
at the outer thing.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.770
This is all done through the Mahasaraswati
power.

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:43.650
But the vibrating force…Now see, there is
a vibrating force: this is all done through

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:46.020
the, as I told you, through the Mahasaraswati
power.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.609
She creates.

00:44:47.609 --> 00:44:51.040
Now the vibrating force: He exists, matter
also exists.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.040
It must exist.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.880
If it does not exist, nothing can exist.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:45:01.310
So, the existence force is given through the
Mahakali force, which is acting through Shri

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:04.670
Ganesh, who is sitting at the nucleus.

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:08.970
He is sitting at the nucleus of every [atom].

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:13.660
Can you imagine how much it must be?

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:17.330
Every molecule and every atom.

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:19.200
You cannot understand the finiteness of it.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.790
Now, see, say, take one element like gold,
how many molecules it has?

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:23.820
Can you calculate?

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.320
[It’s] beyond us!

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.690
How many, you can say, atoms it has?

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.970
We just cannot calculate it.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:34.320
And then how many Ganesha’s pictures must
be there?

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.050
How is it achieved?

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:42.240
Is another thing which I will tell you if
I come in the way.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:50.490
How infinite reflections are caught into and
why there are two things like Shiva and Adi

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:51.490
Shakti?

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.990
The reason is it has to create an infinite
reflection.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.250
How do you create an infinite reflection?

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:59.260
Do you know that?

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:05.500
Anybody who knows physics?

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:10.170
If you place in the centre of two mirrors
something, then the reflections are infinite.

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:20.980
So, the first mirror is the Adi Shakti and
the second mirror is this Creation, and that’s

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:27.030
how you can get infinite reflections on this
Earth.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.640
This is the reason why you can get infinite
reflections.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:37.540
And that’s why you had to create another
one who reflects it.

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:42.990
And that’s why there have to be three identities,
one, the God Almighty, then Adi Shakti and

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:44.470
then the whole Universe.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:48.650
It had to be that way, otherwise you cannot
create infinite reflections.

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:53.680
Now, somebody who has done this job must be
a very clever man, no doubt.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:58.410
When human beings think that they can know
God through their buddhi, they must know,

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:01.910
how can you reach this Buddhi, it’s supreme.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:06.830
How much labour He has taken to create us!

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:16.830
After creating the matter, then He, or I should
say, His power as Mahalakshmi descends on

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:18.890
this Earth.

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:23.030
Mahalakshmi helps in sustenance.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:27.570
Sustenance means all the scanning of all these
elements.

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:36.080
When they create the matter, the matter is
differently created, created for different

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.450
purposes.

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:43.030
Now, what is the ultimate?

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:48.950
The Creation has its ultimate aim is to create
human beings – this creation, just imagine!

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:54.820
You people are so great that for you all these
troubles have been taken.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:48:00.380
Such an important thing is a human being that
all these troubles are taken, – all matter,

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:05.520
all, everything, is used just to create you.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.520
This is the ultimate aim.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:12.570
Sort of a stage has to be laid down and you
come, the Sahaja Yogis come on the scene,

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:14.869
you can say.

00:48:14.869 --> 00:48:17.000
Just the instrument of man is to be created.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.910
Now, why God wanted to create an instrument
of man?

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:29.510
Because He wanted to create an instrument
which could feel Him, which could understand

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:36.440
Him, which could emit, like Krishna creating
his murli (flute).

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:41.000
He just wanted to play through our instruments
His power.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.590
But He didn’t want to do it through the
dead instruments like these but through the

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:47.590
living instruments.

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:54.710
Supposing, if this (microphone) can understand,
can love, has a human mind, and if my voice

00:48:54.710 --> 00:49:03.200
is passing through it like a hollow personality
then we can say that this is a realised personality.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.950
But this is not a living being, you are a
living being.

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:10.390
You are made specially with all these difficulties
for millions of years, have been worked out

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:14.420
so carefully, so delicately, one after another.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:19.740
We have to now jump to the evolution part,
because you see, it’s a very long thing.

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.000
Shri Mataji: Kiti wasle (Marathi: what time
is it?)

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.260
Yogi: Saha wasle (six o’clock)

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:28.450
So, now we have to come to the most important
part which is evolution, which we should understand,

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:35.840
because we know evolution through science.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:44.950
When these three forces came into being, before
creating any earth or before creating this

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:52.840
universe or anything, first they had to draw
out a proper picture about it and a proper

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.210
understanding of it, you see.

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:56.460
As before doing anything, say, we have to
plan out things, we have a planning commission,

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:59.490
first of all, we sit down with a planning
commission.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:05.030
In the same way, first, they had to form a
stage where they just plan out the things.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:08.349
This stage we can call it as the vaikuntha
state.

00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:13.500
Because this (current stage) is not the earliest
state, this is created later on.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:23.300
First, the planning state is known as the
vaikuntha state.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:27.020
At this stage they created all the incarnations.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:32.490
Incarnations were not created after the Earth
has been created, which is a very wrong idea.

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:36.020
They created all the incarnations at the vaikuntha
state.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:41.820
Where you or I never existed at that time,
this Earth never existed and nothing existed

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.940
that you see with your naked eyes now.

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:49.860
But a state of existence, the first one, known
as the vaikuntha state, existed.

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:59.470
In that vaikuntha state the planning of the
whole Universe and the whole cosmos and all

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:00.590
that was decided.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:08.290
So, the first person who had to come on this
was Shiva, because without him nothing can

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:13.540
exist, but where to settle Him down, because
He is to be reflected onto something.

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:18.160
If Shiva has to be reflected onto someone,
you have to create a reflector.

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:28.590
So, they had to, first, think of the one Primordial
Being or a, one Huge Identity you can call

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.220
it, known as Viraat.

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.760
They created Viraata.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:38.470
This will be the Viraata, this will be the
complete form of the Primordial Being.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:42.960
This is the one I’m telling you about, this
Reflector, The First One.

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.630
The God Almighty has to be reflected, so,
first, let us create, first of all, the Primordial

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:50.140
Being, the Viraat.

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:58.940
In the Viraat they created different incarnations.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.780
Incarnations are not created from human beings.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.190
I don’t know why people think like that.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:05.910
They cannot be created by human beings.

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:06.950
But they were first created.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:12.080
You see, evolution is alright from amoeba
to human beings, but there is no evolution

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.560
for incarnations.

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:18.660
They are made like that from the very beginning.

00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:29.190
As you have seen in the Viraata, I have shown
you the picture of the Viraat, the three powers

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:38.540
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati
met at the Agya Chakra, and there they produced

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:47.060
two children each – it’s not a story,
is a fact, again – as brothers and sisters.

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:56.580
And these brothers and sister means the relationship
is of a temporary nature but of a subtler

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:57.580
temperament.

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:03.720
And then they were married, inter-communication
took place.

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:12.570
Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati and Mahakali created
all together six children, who were married.

00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:14.810
Inter-marriage took place.

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:25.100
By that inter-marriage they got an entity
which was a kinetic personality and a potential

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.690
energy within it, such a combination.

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:32.440
And they placed those incarnations on different
chakras.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:39.980
They brought from these, from the top, all
of them were brought from the Agya downward

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:44.060
and placed onto all the chakras.

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:50.820
These incarnations, as you know, are placed
on different chakras of the Viraata.

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:56.130
Many people won’t understand this and won’t
like to hear this also, because human beings

00:53:56.130 --> 00:54:02.840
are so egoistical that they cannot understand
that there is a God, Who is Almighty, Who

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:07.180
is going to do everything, He has His own
ways of doing it.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:11.550
Now, whether I’m telling the Truth or not,
you can verify it on vibrations.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:15.220
You can see for yourself how Incarnations
were created.

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:21.090
And all these Incarnations were placed in
the Viraata state.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:34.010
Here, to create the reflection on the other
side, Shiva was removed from the Shakti, as

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:39.270
it was removed in the beginning and it was
placed on top of the Viraata’s head as the

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.270
Sadashiva’s peetha.

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:42.180
In the same way, we, too, have a Sadashiva’s
peetha on our head.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.410
You see, we are the reflection of the reflector.

00:54:44.410 --> 00:54:52.990
So, we, too, have the same style, we, too,
have a Sadahsiva’s peetha on our head.

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:55.150
He’s also placed here only.

00:54:55.150 --> 00:55:06.619
But when the Kundalini enters into the being,
when he is in the womb of the mother, that

00:55:06.619 --> 00:55:13.410
time this Sadashiva peetha, or we can say,
Sadashiva from this peetha descends into the

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:14.810
heart.

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:20.670
And that’s how you hear the first throb
in the heart.

00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:23.820
It is just the same as it happened in the
Viraata.

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:29.740
But at the vaikuntha stage this was not created,
the second reflector here was not created,

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:31.300
only the first one.

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:40.349
So, only the Viraata was created and in His
Being, in the planning stage, first of all,

00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:46.369
these officers, you can say, in charge of
these chakras were created by Adi Shakti.

00:55:46.369 --> 00:55:52.730
God is the witness and She is doing the play
and She creates those chakras.

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:55.520
In the chakras She places all these deities
to govern.

00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:08.070
Now, there is the existence, there is the
creation, creative force, and there is the

00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:11.570
evolutionary force – all inside the Viraata
state.

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:16.480
Now, this is at the vaikuntha state, we say,
because this state is on this first reflection.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:27.660
It is not in us, or we cannot feel it, the
vaikuntha state, because it is in the first

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.660
thing.

00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.310
Then another state was created, then third
was created.

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:36.360
But the fourth one is the bhavasagara, is
the state at which all of us were born.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:43.040
First, in the fourth state…now, can you
think of a four strata personality which is

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.600
facing a mirror?

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:47.800
Now, which is the first one [that] shows?

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.800
Is the topmost.

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.640
And that’s why the topmost shows is the
bhavasagara.

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:56.010
But if you can go deep down into your state,
you can feel all the other three.

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:58.620
But first of all, the one which you can see
and feel it, is the bhavasagara.

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:00.640
So, you are born in the bhavasagara.

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:03.430
At this state you are at the bhavasagara state.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:11.530
At this bhavasagara state, now, you are created
and you have to evolve.

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:15.270
At this time the Mahalakshmi power acts to
evolve you.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:21.359
You already know how evolutionary things have
taken place but I will tell you how evolution

00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:24.869
has taken place according to our puranas (ancient
scriptures), and which is a fact.

00:57:24.869 --> 00:57:34.580
The Evolution of Man started, first from the
amoeba, you can say; because the life came

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:37.500
into being into water, as I told you [that]
first the water was created.

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:42.080
In the water the amino-acids were formed,
amoeba were formed, fishes were formed and

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:49.230
fishes, when they were formed, they found,
the smaller fishes found it difficult to exist

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:52.960
because of the bigger fishes were trying to
eat it.

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:58.390
It comes as a reciprocal thing, they were
absolutely fed up of this destruction that

00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:59.450
was going on.

00:57:59.450 --> 00:58:05.130
At this time, Shri Vishnu Himself, the One
who is the evolutionary force, descended on

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:08.880
this Earth as the Matsya-Avatara.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:12.660
He helped some of the fishes to cross across
the shores.

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:17.460
By crossing across they had that courage,
She was the leader.

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:18.860
And then others started crossing across.

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.589
This was the first evolutionary stage which
we know.

00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:27.320
These fishes became reptiles later on; as
you know, in the evolutionary stages that

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.660
they became reptiles.

00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:31.210
But how did they become reptiles?

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:33.900
There must be someone who must have given
them the lead.

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:39.950
It was again Shri Vishnu, who came on this
Earth as a Kurma and lots of things were done

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:45.750
at this time in the vaikuntha stage, before
He came on this Earth as a Kurma Avatara.

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:51.270
At the vaikuntha stage, when they created
this Earth, when they created, they planned

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:56.990
this whole Viraata and wanted to create, on
this side of the reflector the whole planning

00:58:56.990 --> 00:59:02.910
and the whole thinking and all that process
brought forth some sort of a waste matter.

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:06.150
It brought forth the waste matter.

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:11.360
This waste matter got contaminated or, we
can say, got stagnated on to one side which

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:16.532
was neglected somehow, and through it started
coming out some satanic forces and there was

00:59:16.532 --> 00:59:20.630
a big fight between the satanic forces and
the good forces.

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:25.030
It actually happened in the third stage, not
at the vaikuntha stage, but at the third stage,

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:28.420
because when the planning started, the working
out started, these satanic forces started

00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:29.420
working out.

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:31.410
Now, people may say, “Why God created satanic
forces?”

00:59:31.410 --> 00:59:38.090
He did not, but eventually they turned out
to be because at the second stage, when some

00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:39.560
of the Devas, who were created.

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:43.960
Again, they were not evolved people, they
were created, Devas, in charge of all these

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:48.020
elements and all the working, you see, you
have to create also officers or people who

00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:49.760
have to go in the field and work out.

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:54.040
All these Devas and Devatas: out of their
working, what happened [is] that they got

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.710
lost, some of them, and became satanic forces.

00:59:56.710 --> 01:00:01.770
Sort of a waste-product came in, and with
that waste-product, satanic forces started

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:08.790
and they acted in such a way that there was
a war during the Kurma-Avatara between Rakshasas

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:10.150
and the Suras, as they call it.

01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:14.430
So, the good people who were in charge of
the elements, all the working in the office

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:17.440
of God started fighting with the satanic forces.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:24.410
At that time, He Himself worked out this and
you know what happened in the amrut-mantan

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:28.960
which took place, and this is, – people
don’t understand how can the amrut-mantan

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.810
take place in the bhavasagara, – it did
not.

01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:36.180
It took place at a stage which is not bhavasagara.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.510
At the bhavasagara it did not take place.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.330
Now, we are at the bhavasagara state.

01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:45.073
At the bhavasagara state the same Kurma, the
same one took birth and came on this Earth

01:00:45.073 --> 01:00:48.940
and gave us a understanding how to become
a proper reptile.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.260
Like that we grew up.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.460
So, the whole thing will take too much time,
I need not go into that.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.710
But, ultimately, a human being was created.

01:00:55.710 --> 01:01:01.180
All this is done by Mahalakshmi power, which
has acted through Vishnu, which I have told

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:09.010
you how evolution has taken place, how you
are made.

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:11.190
Now, what is going to happen?

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.750
You reach this point, up to this point, till
Christ came in.

01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:17.890
Christ was also an incarnation and his Mother
was nobody else but Radhaji Herself, the Mahalakshmi.

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:21.380
And they brought forth up to this stage the
human beings.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.349
After this, now, what man has to become?

01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:32.420
– is to enter into a state where he becomes
nirvichar, means there is no more the consciousness

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.760
of the bhavasagara, but you go little beyond
it.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:45.720
From this stage you dive into a state of Universal
Unconscious, as they call it, it’s nothing

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.950
but the same power which exists here, which
is a synthesis of all the three powers, is

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:51.950
the synthesis of all the three powers.

01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:53.410
That is the Adi Shakti’s power.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:58.220
Adi Shakti’s power is all-pervading, exists
everywhere, but we never feel it otherwise.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:01:59.220
Why?

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:00.630
Because we are very grossly placed.

01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:06.420
We can say, that a tube, which has got, say
four layers, out of which it can only use

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:10.760
the outer tube, because the inner tubes are
all closed.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.859
When the innermost tube is opened out, you
become absolutely Self-realised, but when

01:02:15.859 --> 01:02:20.270
even the second tube is opened out, you can
feel the all-pervading force of God Almighty,

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:24.410
which is, we call it as Sampovapi achetan.

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:28.859
But it is no more achetan (unconscious) for
you because you are conscious of it.

01:02:28.859 --> 01:02:31.359
That is how you start your dialogue with God.

01:02:31.359 --> 01:02:36.359
What happens is that here, the reflection
here, the reflector, that is reflecting work,

01:02:36.359 --> 01:02:38.940
from here you ascend into this part.

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:41.530
You ascend onto this part.

01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:46.070
You do not become this but you ascend into
this area.

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:48.650
From here you ascend into this area.

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:55.520
And this area is filled with the all-pervading
power of Adi Shakti.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:01.230
Till you reach to this stage, you have to
go up to this stage of an incarnation, which,

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:02.760
of course, is a big gap.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:08.520
But I can say that Mahavira and Buddha, both
of them rose to that height.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.580
But look at their disciples!

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:13.410
For example, Buddha’s disciples, they have
decried Shiva, they have decried all the Gods

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:15.920
and Goddesses, I mean as if they did not know
much about it.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:22.130
And the way they have shown in certain statues
– that a Goddess is standing on top of a

01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:26.260
Shiva and a Parvati and is trying to kill;
She is hitting Shri Ganesha and this is something

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.260
so non-sensical.

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:32.670
I mean, they completely killed the image of
One United Force, acting the whole thing,

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:35.030
in One united idea, with One united mind.

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:39.980
Only whenever they had not united, they became
Rakshasas and formed the satanic force.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:44.300
As I told you it’s a very, very difficult
subject and I’ve tried to handle it in English,

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.300
is even worse.

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.750
So, I’ve tried my level best to do it, but
still if you have any questions, anything,

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:53.420
you can ask me, some time, you can write to
me, we can find it out.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:57.200
For tomorrow…Now, this is the only thing
is, I wanted to tell you about this, that

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.660
now you have got thoughtless awareness, no
doubt.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:02.750
Most of you have got thoughtless awareness,
you have got vibrations, but you have to jump

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:03.750
into Nirvikalpa.

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:04.750
Nirvikalpa.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:08.339
And [to] that you have to jump through deep
meditation and through deep exposure.

01:04:08.339 --> 01:04:13.160
Otherwise, you see, it is no use only having
this little state of Nirvichara, you have

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.160
to jump into Nirvikalpa.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.160
That is a stage, little, as I’ve told you
here, that a little ahead of this reflector,

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.160
you have moved.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.460
But still you are going up and down, so many
of you.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:27.071
This is a state known as satori in the Zen
system of religion, they call it as satori:

01:04:27.071 --> 01:04:29.460
where, you see, if a person is going up and
down, is catching, doing this, that.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.089
This stage has to be overcome.

01:04:31.089 --> 01:04:34.120
Then you go to the Nirvikalpa state.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.910
At the end of the Nirvikalpa state you just
don’t catch much.

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:37.370
You are not bothered.

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:40.930
So far, I haven’t met any human being like
that.

01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:47.520
You see, I have seen very great saints and
realised people and I can say that they are

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:52.710
definitely Self-realised, they are even controlling
nature, some of them do, but still they catch

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:54.890
on their chakras, is something surprising.

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:59.810
But, you see, human beings are like that,
they’ll go on catching and again, perhaps,

01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:04.080
they jump into the third state of Self-realisation
completely, but they are again in a satori

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.560
state and they come back and go back and,
like that, may be.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:11.250
But I have seen that, so far, I have not met
one human being whom I will say he is fully

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.180
Self-realised, who doesn’t catch.

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:17.340
Except for me, I find, everybody is catching.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.680
It’s most surprising.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.580
But when you don’t catch – what happens,
when you don’t catch?

01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:24.520
Actually, this is a state rather difficult
to achieve.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:30.740
But if you don’t catch, if you think you
don’t catch – how you should do it ?- is

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.220
to see this way: that if, supposing, you are
catching Agya, maybe.

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:38.190
You must know that when you are catching your
Agya, you should not think you are catching

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:42.220
your Agya, but you should think that you are
gathering a force here to combat the another

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.220
person.

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:44.220
If you can do like that.

01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:48.930
Supposing you are catching on the Vishuddhi
chakra, instead of thinking that you are catching

01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:53.270
on Vishuddhi chakra and getting upset about
it, if you start thinking that this is a force

01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:56.240
you are accumulating just to counterbalance
his Vishuddhi chakra.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.220
Then, I think, it will work out better.

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:03.710
That’s why I always say that: extend your
hands to others and see for yourself.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:07.359
This has helped many people because if they
catch on Agya and if they give vibrations

01:06:07.359 --> 01:06:08.790
to somebody who is Agya caught, they find
they are released.

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:11.960
Such things are happening to very few but
it’s happening.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:15.700
So, this is what you can try: that don’t
think you are catching but you should think:

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:19.890
a force has been accumulated to expel the
Agya of another person who is facing you.

01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:23.340
In the beginning, of course, it’s a very,
very slow process, but gradually you can do

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:26.450
it and only people who start giving others.

01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:30.330
This is a collective thinking, is a collective
thinking: that, supposing, now you can say

01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:35.470
like that, that if, supposing, there is a
malaria attack on Me, then My own blood, My

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:38.190
own blood cells are trying to combat it.

01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:39.230
And they are combating it.

01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:42.359
You see, if I give in, if I give in, then
I become malarious.

01:06:42.359 --> 01:06:44.180
But if I do not give in, I become victorious.

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:50.330
In the same way, if you could think this way
while giving vibrations: that if you catch

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:54.839
it is actually a force being accumulated into
you and then you have to give it, then you

01:06:54.839 --> 01:06:58.250
are going to be much faster than all the munis
put together, I can tell you.

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:01.470
But that thinking is rather difficult for
human beings, because once they catch, they

01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:04.260
get little worried, “I’m catching,”
they start taking out their own.

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:08.270
If you don’t take out your own and go all
out to give it to others, it will work out

01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:09.270
better.

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:12.720
And this I’ve been, I’ve experimented
with one or two people, I’m saying, and

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.720
it has worked.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.800
Everybody does not have that capacity.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.950
So, gradually you rise, because you are just
now newly born children, you have still to

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:21.720
grow, you have to grow more.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:25.030
You might be learned, you might be knowing
a lot, that doesn’t mean, as far as your

01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:27.810
spirituality is concerned, you have just have
come out of your satori state, some of you,

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:29.980
and some of you are still in the satori state.

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:32.230
So, be careful about it.

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:36.170
I would like to meet you again, perhaps, after
two years, I don’t know when.

01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:39.130
Tomorrow we are having a meditation here,
then I won’t speak much.

01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:40.560
Tomorrow we have a meditation.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:45.540
We have a meditation centre here, where you
should go and meet, when you meet in a group

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:51.410
then it is a samuhik, is a group activity,
I will be there.

01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:57.130
You’ll be surprised that my vibrations cannot
be felt anywhere so much as they can be felt

01:07:57.130 --> 01:08:00.490
in a group, about which I know that such and
such group is working here.

01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:03.590
So, we have already three groups which are
working in Delhi.

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:05.710
And they are made quite closer to the places.

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:09.060
After all, we must know that we don’t have
to go to Himalayas, as people went down, we

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.190
don’t have to do all these things.

01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:13.950
Only thing we have to go is to a place which
is very much closer to us, it has been brought

01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:15.320
to our doors.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:21.620
The whole thing has been brought to your doors:
the knowledge, the vibrations, the realisation

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:22.930
and everything is made so easy.

01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:23.930
It’s made easy….

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:26.609
But it should not mean that we should take
it for granted.

01:08:26.609 --> 01:08:31.339
It has been made easy through a very, very
great tapasya on my part, I should say.

01:08:31.339 --> 01:08:35.089
In many ages I’ve been living now for thousands
of years and I’ve been working it out on

01:08:35.089 --> 01:08:40.190
so many human beings and so many things and,
at long last, I’ve been able to find out

01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:43.830
most of the permutations and combinations
of most of the human beings and that’s how

01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:46.359
it has been worked out in such a large mass-scale.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:49.920
It would not have been possible if I had not
worked it out in that way.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:54.210
And that’s how if it has worked out it has
to click with most of the people except for

01:08:54.210 --> 01:09:00.460
one type is very, very difficult, I must say,
those who are bound to people who are rakshasas.

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:03.819
If they are born rakshasas and if your head
has touched their feet, it’s a very difficult

01:09:03.819 --> 01:09:04.819
thing.

01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:06.989
So, I would warn you, that before you touch
feet of anybody, you’d be careful about

01:09:06.989 --> 01:09:07.989
it.

01:09:07.989 --> 01:09:08.989
May God bless you all!

01:09:08.989 --> 01:09:13.270
It’s already very late for all of you and
such a difficult subject to be brought to

01:09:13.270 --> 01:09:16.370
such a short time, it’s very difficult.

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:21.030
I hope to write some book on Sahaja Yoga:
‘I hope’, I am saying, because, so far,

01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:22.109
I’ve never written any book.

01:09:22.109 --> 01:09:24.950
[I’m] trying to write some book, but before
that some other people are writing.

01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:27.920
I hope, I may be able to write something.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:31.440
In any case, you try not to bother too much
about these things.

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:35.880
This is not so important as your own realisation
and your own ascent [because] the whole knowledge

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.029
will be dawned upon you.

01:09:37.029 --> 01:09:38.730
You don’t have to bother!

01:09:38.730 --> 01:09:41.730
Every word now you read, you will have a meaning
about it and you will understand.

01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:45.670
The first thing is that you must get your
realisation, second thing is you must ascend.

01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:48.980
You must ascend much more and give more time
to this.

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.410
Do not take it for granted.

01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:52.680
It is a very important thing which you should
do.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.969
After all there are other things, they are
important.

01:09:54.969 --> 01:09:57.820
But this is the most important thing which
has to be done.

01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:01.480
By God’s grace, if it works out I’ll be
very happy.

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:07.060
As it is, I’m extremely happy because in
none of my lives I’ve been able to give

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:09.130
realisations to so many people.

01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:11.460
So as it is, I am over-satisfied with Myself.

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:15.190
But as far as you are concerned, you should
not be satisfied, you should ask for more

01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:17.940
and more and more and it will be granted.

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:20.690
Because you are the people who are on the
stage, you are created for this purpose.

01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:22.340
One has to do it.

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.449
God has to do it.

01:10:24.449 --> 01:10:29.489
If He does not do it, He cannot fulfil His
own desires.

01:10:29.489 --> 01:10:31.340
And His Creation, He is not going to destroy.

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:31.469
May God bless you!
