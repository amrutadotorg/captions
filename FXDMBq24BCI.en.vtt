00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:11.348
Doctor Warren has clearly told you about these
subtle bodies within us.

00:07:12.374 --> 00:07:18.467
And we should think why this subtle body was
created?

00:07:19.396 --> 00:07:24.867
What was the need to create this body within us
and how it was created?

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:33.465
These, all these centers, are the milestones
of our evolution.

00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:43.344
And as we started growing, higher and higher,
developing higher and higher awareness, we

00:07:43.686 --> 00:07:46.366
developed all these centers one by one.

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:52.837
And at the human level, it’s this center
where the man raised his head up.

00:07:52.837 --> 00:07:54.126
Still why?

00:07:54.126 --> 00:07:58.517
What was the need to create a human being?

00:07:58.517 --> 00:08:04.217
Supposing I’m trying to get some nuts, bolts
and things, and try to fix them up,

00:08:04.413 --> 00:08:07.907
make it into a good instrument.

00:08:07.907 --> 00:08:10.167
One would ask what are you doing?

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:13.027
Why are you assembling all this, what are
you making out of it?

00:08:13.027 --> 00:08:21.186
After all, it cannot be a waste, why such
a special thing has been made, for what purpose?

00:08:21.186 --> 00:08:26.237
And that is what we have not yet discovered,
what is our purpose.

00:08:26.237 --> 00:08:31.258
But if you go to any of the Scriptures, you’ll
find out that they have said,

00:08:31.258 --> 00:08:36.266
all of them have said, that you have to become your Self.

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:41.167
That there is All-pervading Power around us.

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:43.997
Now this All-pervading Power we cannot see.

00:08:43.997 --> 00:08:45.937
It exists.

00:08:45.937 --> 00:08:48.946
As they say, if you have to believe it, or
not.

00:08:48.946 --> 00:08:52.837
But we should find out if there is such a
Power or not.

00:08:52.837 --> 00:09:00.369
For example, if I say that there are lots of
beautiful pictures

00:09:00.369 --> 00:09:05.807
and beautiful music in this area, you won’t believe it.

00:09:05.807 --> 00:09:13.147
But if I get you a television set and if I
plug it to the main, you starts seeing

00:09:13.147 --> 00:09:16.717
that it is receiving something.

00:09:17.364 --> 00:09:24.349
In the same way, when you become connected
with the whole,

00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:31.547
then what should happen to you is that you start feeling that All-pervading Power.

00:09:31.547 --> 00:09:33.857
This is Self-knowledge.

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:42.857
And it’s written at length, very clearly,
by many people in the Indian Scriptures.

00:09:42.857 --> 00:09:52.516
The reason was, the people who came in the
other parts of the world,

00:09:52.516 --> 00:10:00.398
had such a tough time, they were not given any chance to say
anything much about it.

00:10:00.398 --> 00:10:09.147
Hardly they could utter anything and they
were crucified, poisoned, beaten up, tortured,

00:10:09.147 --> 00:10:14.647
all kinds of problems they were given.

00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:21.761
So this has to happen within us that you we
should feel this All-pervading Power.

00:10:23.152 --> 00:10:27.297
The other day, we had 2 persons from a guru
and they said,

00:10:27.297 --> 00:10:32.544
"How can it be only this cool breeze that is coming in us, is something?"

00:10:32.544 --> 00:10:38.645
For a human being, to conceive something about
God,

00:10:38.645 --> 00:10:46.717
is to go to scriptures which have lasted for all these ages, to find out

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.072
one of the authorities you can have.

00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:55.107
Now, it is said that there is All-pervading
power in all the scriptures.

00:10:56.465 --> 00:11:02.356
Now supposing, by going to somebody, he says,
"I give you power called, so called shaktipat",

00:11:02.356 --> 00:11:09.060
and he just starts jumping like a mad horse
or a like a mad monkey.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.357
And you say, "It is shaktipat!"

00:11:12.357 --> 00:11:17.712
And you have vigorous movements and all kinds
of acrobats you fall into

00:11:17.712 --> 00:11:19.787
and you believe that this is shakti.

00:11:19.787 --> 00:11:24.785
And then, by the time it is over, you are
exhausted and finished.

00:11:25.416 --> 00:11:27.976
How can that be a shaktipat?

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:37.551
The idea of energy within us is not horse
energy by which a horse can run very fast,

00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:41.756
that’s physical energy, we should understand.
That's just a 'prana shakti',

00:11:42.245 --> 00:11:46.717
part of this- just part of this path.

00:11:46.717 --> 00:11:49.908
It’s just a physical energy.

00:11:51.587 --> 00:11:56.927
Now human beings don’t need a horse power,
do they?

00:11:56.927 --> 00:12:01.527
You have already got big cars here which have
tremendous horse powers.

00:12:01.527 --> 00:12:06.477
You don’t have to become horses now, or
bulls or some sort of an animal.

00:12:07.552 --> 00:12:11.846
Our idea of a Superman is that he will have
such power

00:12:11.846 --> 00:12:15.710
that he can lift the whole building and throw away somewhere.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.757
All such absurd ideas should be given up

00:12:20.757 --> 00:12:25.592
and you should understand that is physical wellbeing

00:12:25.967 --> 00:12:35.477
so that you can feel the blessings, the
blessings of your Spirit.

00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:44.856
Blessing work, an animal doesn’t understand;
but a human being must understand that when

00:12:44.856 --> 00:12:53.787
he gets spiritually endowed and spiritually
blessed, then, first thing he should have

00:12:53.787 --> 00:12:57.307
is a physical wellbeing.

00:12:57.307 --> 00:13:04.637
That doesn’t mean that he becomes a wrestler,
That doesn’t mean that his body will be

00:13:04.637 --> 00:13:10.636
so built that if he slaps somebody, then the
other person will die.

00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:18.227
On the contrary, you become such a powerful
personality that if somebody slaps him, for

00:13:18.227 --> 00:13:21.967
him it’s nothing, it is all nonsense.

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:33.007
So the concept of human beings can be from
the kind of life they lead, the kind of media

00:13:33.007 --> 00:13:39.907
they face, the kind of identification the
society has, all kinds of things could be there.

00:13:39.907 --> 00:13:46.717
For example, for Japanese children, I was
amazed, for them the idea of a Superman is

00:13:46.717 --> 00:13:52.841
that he should look like a ghost, he should
at least ten times bigger than a normal human being.

00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:55.267
And that’s what they think they should achieve.

00:13:55.267 --> 00:14:03.337
Because I studied their media, specially their
cinema, and most of them have produced these phantom ideas.

00:14:03.337 --> 00:14:07.033
We don’t become phantoms, that is one thing
one should know.

00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:14.657
Neither we become agitated – how can we
become agitated? We are in bliss and peace.

00:14:14.657 --> 00:14:25.402
If you start just gesticulating and sort of shouting
and screaming like mad, then how can that be a 'shaktipat''?

00:14:25.402 --> 00:14:29.919
It’s madness, you are possessed!
It's possession on you.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:35.477
Anywhere you go anybody who’s possessed, you
go and see lunatics, they do the same.

00:14:35.477 --> 00:14:42.121
You pay these people to become lunatics, to
believe that they have given you a power,

00:14:42.437 --> 00:14:44.001
it’s absurd.

00:14:44.001 --> 00:14:51.115
Now the power that has come, is going to come
to us, has to give you a wellbeing.

00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:54.880
All these people if you look at them, they
are sickly people, they are reclusive.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.525
They are actually frightened, some of them are
even frightened of a garlic as I told you.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:08.975
So the Realization, if it comes to you, the
chakras which are placed on your fingers,

00:15:08.975 --> 00:15:11.652
should be enlightened, minimum of minimum.

00:15:11.652 --> 00:15:16.131
And that you should be able to feel this All-pervading Power that is there.

00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:21.236
This is Self-knowledge, this is 'atma bodha'.

00:15:22.126 --> 00:15:29.491
'Bodha' means to know; to know, to feel that
power.

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:32.033
Even, after Realization  [...]

00:15:32.033 --> 00:15:38.082
when you grow a little bit more,
you start seeing comma like powers,

00:15:38.082 --> 00:15:49.270
it’s just like, you can say a – in
English I don’t know- small sparklers of commas,

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.765
you can see it clearly. You can also see the Kundalinis of the people.

00:15:53.765 --> 00:16:01.497
You can also see a good soul and a bad soul like dots, you can clearly start seeing, once you get your Realization,

00:16:01.497 --> 00:16:03.172
when you are at that level, you start seeing.

00:16:03.172 --> 00:16:07.529
But if you get possessed, say you are on the
left-hand side, then what will you see?

00:16:07.823 --> 00:16:10.335
You’ll see ghosts walking into your house.

00:16:10.335 --> 00:16:12.597
You’ll say your room is lifted up.

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:16.717
Suddenly you’ll find your body is taken
away and you are somewhere hanging.

00:16:16.717 --> 00:16:21.881
All these are very, very dangerous things
about which people are not aware.

00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:25.919
Never go near these things and these people.

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:30.718
Recently there’s a big disease that has
started, which is a very dangerous disease

00:16:30.718 --> 00:16:34.021
I don’t know if you people, are aware of
it or not.

00:16:34.021 --> 00:16:39.076
That when small children are sleeping in the
day time, say they are in Switzerland.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:45.161
And say, their mother may be in America.

00:16:45.161 --> 00:16:47.037
The timings are different.

00:16:47.037 --> 00:16:50.647
That time, it may be the night and here it
may be the day time.

00:16:50.647 --> 00:16:54.657
And the mother goes to a clairvoyant and says
that: “I would like to speak to my child”.

00:16:54.657 --> 00:16:56.717
“All right”.

00:16:56.717 --> 00:17:06.717
So the child is sleeping and this clairvoyant
gets a soul around, and asks the soul to get the soul of the child

00:17:07.823 --> 00:17:13.207
and the mother can hear the voice of the child,
sitting down here.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:19.676
“Oh, I’m speaking without any telecommunication
I’m talking to this child”.

00:17:19.676 --> 00:17:26.616
And it’s very common that the child dies
in sleep and the mother doesn’t know.

00:17:27.581 --> 00:17:35.015
Because the soul has to return, and if it
does not return properly,

00:17:35.406 --> 00:17:41.004
if something goes wrong in his return, the child suffers and also,

00:17:41.004 --> 00:17:50.545
the soul suffers in any case when
it leaves the body and it is very dangerous to human life

00:17:50.545 --> 00:17:57.597
And we go headlong into it and we destroy
ourselves.

00:17:57.597 --> 00:18:01.390
They are very, very cunning people I tell
you.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:06.717
Yesterday, those two people who were discussing
me, arguing with me, they told me that their guru

00:18:06.717 --> 00:18:08.717
thinks very highly of me.

00:18:08.717 --> 00:18:15.098
And there also, people have heard they told me that our guru said that, You don’t go to Her

00:18:15.098 --> 00:18:20.824
because She will only accept you if you are absolutely purified and we have to purify you".

00:18:20.824 --> 00:18:23.449
All this is nonsense!

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:31.285
These people are just playing tricks on your
mind. The purification takes when the Kundalini
rises.

00:18:31.285 --> 00:18:33.085
She purifies you.

00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:37.879
Because you come to know about yourself when
the Kundalini rises, face the problem.

00:18:38.355 --> 00:18:41.421
And once you know the problem you correct
yourselves.

00:18:41.775 --> 00:18:46.976
Kundalini awakening gives you the judgement
of your own Self

00:18:46.976 --> 00:18:50.735
as if you are going in the car

00:18:50.735 --> 00:18:56.717
and you get out of the car to see what’s
wrong with the car.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.190
It is very simple when the Kundalini rises
to correct you.

00:19:02.581 --> 00:19:05.879
For example, supposing there’s a person
who smokes too much.

00:19:06.717 --> 00:19:09.950
I may tell him, "Don’t smoke, don’t smoke", all that.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:14.345
He gets tired of me, run away, won’t see me again.

00:19:14.345 --> 00:19:17.124
There is no need to tell you don’t smoke.

00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:20.847
Once you get your Self-realization, you won’t
smoke at all.

00:19:20.847 --> 00:19:24.796
Little willpower will work it out,  in the
first instance.

00:19:24.865 --> 00:19:31.282
But even if it doesn’t act in the first instance,
gradually you will just drop it out

00:19:31.282 --> 00:19:34.866
because of transmutation that takes place.

00:19:34.866 --> 00:19:40.622
So we have to see that when we say that we
have got some sort of a shakti or a power within us,

00:19:40.622 --> 00:19:52.191
we should become master of ourselves,
of our greed, of our desires and of our aggressive nature.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:54.923
We should become the master of that.

00:19:54.923 --> 00:19:59.612
Unless and until that happens to us, how should
we believe that it is innate power?

00:19:59.612 --> 00:20:03.845
and that we should feel this All-pervading, blissful
Power around us.

00:20:03.845 --> 00:20:08.162
Unless and until you’re awakened to that,
how can you see?

00:20:08.162 --> 00:20:12.677
Unless and until you eyes are open, how will
you see that?

00:20:12.677 --> 00:20:16.717
And that awakening is enlightenment.

00:20:16.717 --> 00:20:21.539
Now you are so beautifully made inside see,
already you are made like that.

00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:24.331
Already you are made like that.

00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:33.575
Except that if you are not ruining it, by breaking
it completely, you are there!

00:20:33.575 --> 00:20:42.939
His made, for which you have not paid anything.
You are putting no effort, no jumping, nothing.

00:20:42.939 --> 00:20:49.860
You have become a human being from a monkey,
without cutting your tails.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.710
Automatically, spontaneously.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:21:01.070
And if you have to become anything higher, you will become, spontaneously.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:10.413
The only difference is that, at this stage
of evolution, you have been given your freedom to chose.

00:21:10.413 --> 00:21:15.770
Because at a high level when you will move,
you have to be free people.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:20.290
And that freedom is to be respected this is one point.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:27.212
And the second point is that your Realization
has to take place in your human awareness,

00:21:27.212 --> 00:21:28.742
you should know!

00:21:28.742 --> 00:21:32.878
When you became a human being from a monkey stage, you never knew how you became.

00:21:32.878 --> 00:21:35.463
But now you must know!

00:21:35.463 --> 00:21:41.939
Because you must know that there is God
and you must know that his power is flowing to you.

00:21:44.698 --> 00:21:50.724
That’s why one should understand what we
should expect when we get our Realization.

00:21:50.724 --> 00:21:55.569
Of course, as we said, that when you start
getting the power within you,

00:21:55.569 --> 00:22:02.373
once it starts working, then you can learn about it, how
you manifest it, how you use it.

00:22:02.373 --> 00:22:07.650
First, when electricity was discovered, nobody
knew that it will have so many uses.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.077
But then you discover how many uses it has!

00:22:12.077 --> 00:22:16.430
But here, you don’t even have to discover it.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:22.356
If it is told that this has this use, you
just try and see for yourself, it has or not.

00:22:22.356 --> 00:22:28.426
It’s like, you get, say, a car, you purchase
a car and they give you everything in writing,

00:22:28.426 --> 00:22:33.907
"Now try this one. If you press this button, that will
happen. If you  press that button, that will happen."

00:22:33.907 --> 00:22:37.877
In the same way, the whole thing is invented

00:22:37.877 --> 00:22:44.597
completely decorated for you to use this power

00:22:44.597 --> 00:22:52.678
to manoeuvre it, to handle it and to manifest it.

00:22:55.024 --> 00:23:03.409
We have no self-esteem. If we had self-esteem, we should understand that

00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:08.146
God has created you with such difficulties, whatever it is

00:23:08.255 --> 00:23:15.013
Thousands of times, thousands of years it
has taken for you to become a human being.

00:23:15.228 --> 00:23:21.802
And that you must be something special, much
higher than animals, no doubt about it;

00:23:21.802 --> 00:23:25.683
and that it should happen to you.

00:23:25.683 --> 00:23:30.819
It is He who loves you. It is He who is the father.

00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:38.377
His compassion, love and the greatest father
that you could think of, who wants to share.

00:23:38.377 --> 00:23:42.050
He wants to give his kingdom to you.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:46.797
You must have that self-esteem that you are a human being.

00:23:46.797 --> 00:23:55.081
I think somehow, perhaps, because of these conditionings you have had,

00:23:55.081 --> 00:24:00.557
you think, “How can we get Realization so easily?”
You can’t believe it.

00:24:00.557 --> 00:24:06.553
You don’t want to believe it.
You think, ‘How can we be Realized so easily?”

00:24:06.553 --> 00:24:11.617
Because everything you do in life, you think
you have to struggle.

00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:15.851
But there are so many things you don’t do with struggle;

00:24:15.851 --> 00:24:18.824
like, you get a fruit without any struggle.

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:23.174
Even if you breath, all your autonomous nervous system works without any struggle.

00:24:23.174 --> 00:24:27.070
You eat and the food is digested automatically.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:32.541
You don’t have to struggle for it, you don’t have to jump or do jogging or anything like that.

00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:35.905
It just works out.

00:24:36.296 --> 00:24:44.072
We should understand it is the blessing, it’s the blessing.

00:24:44.072 --> 00:24:53.305
People have become so much science oriented that they have forgotten that science also is a blessing.

00:24:53.305 --> 00:24:57.758
Science is a blessing now, for example,
see this photograph of mine here.

00:24:57.758 --> 00:25:04.496
I had gone to a village and the village, which had no electricity, nothing,

00:25:04.496 --> 00:25:09.026
had a very old building of a school, I was sitting outside.

00:25:09.026 --> 00:25:15.736
And the photograph caught on these falling rains,
the photograph!

00:25:15.736 --> 00:25:18.127
Your camera has caught it.

00:25:18.127 --> 00:25:24.733
I went to Hong Kong on the Television, and they asked me,

00:25:24.733 --> 00:25:30.210
because the person who was owning the television,
his daughter, invited me

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:34.819
And she said, "Mother, can we ask people to put their hands towards you, like this?"

00:25:34.819 --> 00:25:37.748
I said, "All right. Let’s start."
And they got Realization,

00:25:37.748 --> 00:25:40.990
so many of them! They wrote letters that,
"We got Realization."

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:45.042
On the television!

00:25:45.042 --> 00:25:51.049
Even on the telephone, you can give Realization,
on the telephone you can save people.

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:56.717
All this science has created, it's for Sahaja Yogis and for Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:56.717 --> 00:26:01.258
It is a blessing to communicate the message.

00:26:01.258 --> 00:26:04.968
But, people are so blind, so blind,

00:26:04.968 --> 00:26:13.769
that they think all this has been given to us to make more money and to create more plastics.

00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:23.735
They cannot believe that this is to communicate about God’s love, his compassion

00:26:23.735 --> 00:26:32.543
and that security that is from the most loving Father you could think of.

00:26:32.543 --> 00:26:38.844
It is beyond human conception to understand his compassion, I accept.

00:26:38.844 --> 00:26:44.607
But still you see compassion in life and if He is the source of compassion

00:26:44.607 --> 00:26:48.269
then what must be his level of compassion?

00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:54.375
Now as it is, he [Warren] has told you all about this quite a lot and I have also yesterday told you

00:26:54.375 --> 00:26:59.210
And he said that I have only one more lecture to cover the whole subject, I don’t know what’s going to happen,

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:04.512
how far I can go with people in New York.

00:27:05.001 --> 00:27:10.080
I think we may have one more lecture when I come back, one more lecture might be.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.328
But today, I think I should talk to you about the Self, first of all,

00:27:14.328 --> 00:27:17.843
then about all these things, it will be a better idea.

00:27:18.723 --> 00:27:23.802
Now what is the Self within you?

00:27:25.875 --> 00:27:34.251
Self is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:27:37.528 --> 00:27:44.269
First, let us see how the creation came into being.

00:27:46.517 --> 00:27:50.419
In the beginning or in the end

00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:53.160
because there is no beginning and there is no end.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.080
Like you cannot say, "Hen came first, it came first or the egg", it’s something like that.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:04.047
It started at a point, you see, when it was just all quiet.

00:28:04.927 --> 00:28:13.378
And the whole creation becomes

00:28:13.378 --> 00:28:18.355
untroubled or we can say it is sleeping.

00:28:18.355 --> 00:28:20.375
Everything is sleeping,

00:28:20.375 --> 00:28:24.851
like we sleep so the whole world sleeps for us.

00:28:24.851 --> 00:28:29.140
That is a state that’s called as Parabrahma in Sanskrit language.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.166
That is a state that’s called as Parabrahma in Sanskrit language.

00:28:33.192 --> 00:28:38.027
Now, in the Bible, whatever is written is very telescopic and very fast.

00:28:38.027 --> 00:28:41.390
And to understand it I am just trying to enlarge it

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:46.717
that where ever are the missing points, you can put them up.

00:28:46.717 --> 00:28:51.123
Now the first state is of Parabrahma

00:28:51.123 --> 00:29:00.128
is a state where everything is not manifesting,

00:29:00.128 --> 00:29:04.132
everything is sleeping.

00:29:04.621 --> 00:29:11.794
Then this Parabrahma becomes aware of Itself

00:29:11.794 --> 00:29:16.717
that It awakens as we awaken.

00:29:16.717 --> 00:29:21.436
Then It starts manifesting.

00:29:21.973 --> 00:29:26.224
All the awareness, the consciousness of that

00:29:26.224 --> 00:29:31.338
starts accumulating on the periphery

00:29:31.338 --> 00:29:41.132
and the centre remains as the Subject.

00:29:42.627 --> 00:29:49.290
The periphery now is the Power of that Subject.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:55.638
So we had the subject, the God Almighty, is called as Sadashiva

00:29:55.638 --> 00:30:00.073
and his Power that is the Primordial Power,

00:30:00.073 --> 00:30:06.717
in Sanskrit is called as Adi Shakti,
and we call it as Holy Ghost in the Bible.

00:30:07.157 --> 00:30:12.053
So, they separate, I mean it’s a –

00:30:12.053 --> 00:30:17.223
some drawings have to be made but doesn’t matter now- I'll just tell you in short.

00:30:17.223 --> 00:30:23.345
And this Spectator, this Sadashiva,

00:30:23.345 --> 00:30:28.997
this God Almighty starts watching his own Power.

00:30:28.997 --> 00:30:36.046
Now we cannot understand the complete concord and complete understanding,

00:30:36.046 --> 00:30:42.096
complete oneness and integration between these two entities,

00:30:42.096 --> 00:30:48.859
God Almighty and his Power. It’s like the Sun and his rays or sunshine,

00:30:48.859 --> 00:30:53.294
Moon and moonlight, but even more than that.

00:30:53.294 --> 00:30:55.439
Nothing can come in between them.

00:30:55.439 --> 00:31:01.001
They are absolutely in unison with each other

00:31:01.001 --> 00:31:05.302
and every thing works simultaneously.

00:31:05.302 --> 00:31:12.496
In human relationship, no husband and wife can be like that, it’s impossible.

00:31:12.496 --> 00:31:28.135
Then the Spectator, Sadashiva, forces his Power, which forms an entity, to create.

00:31:28.673 --> 00:31:31.348
First, She refuses.

00:31:31.348 --> 00:31:38.061
And then He gives Her- I mean in a very poetic way- it’s called as a “Lasya”, means a launch.

00:31:38.061 --> 00:31:42.052
And that gives the first sound, Omkara.

00:31:42.052 --> 00:31:46.717
That’s the first, logos, the first sound, the Word.

00:31:46.717 --> 00:31:52.625
That’s the Word She says, She creates.

00:31:53.114 --> 00:31:56.717
Then She starts creating.

00:31:56.717 --> 00:31:59.065
She creates, She divides Herself

00:31:59.065 --> 00:32:03.684
First of all, She is nothing but the Power of desire.

00:32:03.684 --> 00:32:11.292
Because, first it is to be desired! It’s the God’s desire!

00:32:11.292 --> 00:32:13.765
She exists as a desire.

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:17.548
Unless and until there is desire, nothing can work out.

00:32:17.548 --> 00:32:23.909
So She is the Power of desire. like we have also the Power of desire within us.

00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:33.628
Then from this desire, comes the other Power which makes it an act.

00:32:33.628 --> 00:32:39.396
So the other Power of action comes in.

00:32:39.836 --> 00:32:50.019
These two Powers bring forth a system in between themselves,

00:32:50.019 --> 00:32:53.570
like left and right,

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:58.182
which starts giving sustenance to things that have been created.

00:32:58.573 --> 00:33:04.760
As I told you that carbon has four valences, it’s a tetravalent,

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:10.646
I don’t know if you people have studied chemistry or not, there’s a chemical periodic table if you see,

00:33:10.646 --> 00:33:15.764
it’s all divided so beautifully and it is so well arranged,

00:33:15.764 --> 00:33:21.388
that one has to believe that there is a great Juggler

00:33:21.388 --> 00:33:26.300
or a great Planner who has done it, otherwise it’s not possible.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:32.043
It’s so well arranged! The whole valences system and everything is so well arranged.

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:43.945
All this is done by the central path which gives them the sustenance, the quality that they have.

00:33:43.945 --> 00:33:47.176
Then the sustenance starts growing

00:33:47.176 --> 00:33:51.651
till you become a human being as shown here.

00:33:51.651 --> 00:33:57.978
In this Void, here as carbon then you move into the Void

00:33:57.978 --> 00:34:04.172
and here you go through all the evolution starting from a fish

00:34:04.172 --> 00:34:09.341
up to the human level where you become a small man.

00:34:09.732 --> 00:34:15.811
Once you become the small man, Vamana, is called that.

00:34:15.811 --> 00:34:21.172
First the man who came on this earth was a small statured man.

00:34:21.563 --> 00:34:31.259
Then a man came who was Parashurama, a very, very - Poseidon, a very large man, huge man.

00:34:31.845 --> 00:34:34.809
Two extremes.

00:34:34.809 --> 00:34:41.207
And then, came the man who was in the centre.

00:34:41.207 --> 00:34:49.285
And the leadership of all this evolution was done by the Incarnation

00:34:49.285 --> 00:34:54.136
of the aspect which is the evolutionary aspect.

00:34:54.136 --> 00:34:59.549
So the first aspect She creates is of desire aspect.

00:34:59.549 --> 00:35:04.251
When the desire dies, the whole thing is destroyed.

00:35:04.251 --> 00:35:06.913
And the Spectator is watching it.

00:35:06.913 --> 00:35:09.134
Spectator has a desire.

00:35:09.134 --> 00:35:13.257
As long as the Spectator is happy, the play goes on.

00:35:13.257 --> 00:35:17.973
As soon as He doesn’t like the spectacle, He disappears.

00:35:17.973 --> 00:35:29.172
As soon as He disappears, then the whole show is over.

00:35:29.172 --> 00:35:34.408
It’s for that only Spectator the whole show is there.

00:35:34.408 --> 00:35:39.784
So this Power of desire has to be till the end.

00:35:39.784 --> 00:35:44.022
Once the Power of desire is finished, then there is no more show;

00:35:44.022 --> 00:35:46.718
there’s no more Spectator,

00:35:46.718 --> 00:35:49.670
there’s no more his Power, they’re all merge together

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:53.111
and again become the Parabrahma status.

00:35:55.263 --> 00:35:57.906
Now the other Power, as I said,

00:35:57.906 --> 00:36:01.814
which is the aspect of creation so the Creator aspect is there.

00:36:01.814 --> 00:36:08.415
One is the one which is the existence and the other side of the existence is the Destroyer.

00:36:08.415 --> 00:36:11.928
And then another aspect is of the Creator

00:36:11.928 --> 00:36:18.386
and the central one is the Sustainer, is the Protector.

00:36:18.386 --> 00:36:26.200
Out of these, this one incarnates, only one aspect

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.997
because it has to give a quality and the leadership.

00:36:30.997 --> 00:36:35.128
For example, when there was a great flood,

00:36:35.128 --> 00:36:38.049
then He [Vishnu] incarnated.

00:36:38.049 --> 00:36:41.189
He incarnated as a fish

00:36:41.189 --> 00:36:44.949
and the dolphin-fish. Dolphin.

00:36:44.949 --> 00:36:48.609
I don’t know if you know about dolphins or not.

00:36:48.609 --> 00:36:52.893
But dolphin is a mammal and is a friend of human beings.

00:36:52.893 --> 00:36:58.721
So He incarnated as a dolphin-fish and saved the boat [Noa’s Ark].

00:36:58.721 --> 00:37:03.711
As you know, there was a boat in which people were saved.

00:37:03.711 --> 00:37:09.283
He saved the boat. He is the dolphin who incarnated on this Earth.

00:37:09.625 --> 00:37:13.583
One by one, He incarnates.

00:37:13.583 --> 00:37:19.382
Then He incarnates as a turtle,

00:37:19.382 --> 00:37:24.235
four legged, which comes out of the water

00:37:24.235 --> 00:37:29.027
to show the fishes that you can come out.

00:37:31.027 --> 00:37:36.301
Then, gradually He incarnates as a quadruped.

00:37:36.301 --> 00:37:40.696
Like that, the Incarnations — He comes as a leader.

00:37:40.696 --> 00:37:45.531
Somebody has to give that confidence.

00:37:45.531 --> 00:37:50.268
One fish comes and takes them out

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:54.281
and others come, they follow them up.

00:37:54.574 --> 00:38:00.802
As they go on improving, every time there is an Incarnation.

00:38:00.802 --> 00:38:05.069
And between one Incarnation and another Incarnation,

00:38:05.069 --> 00:38:10.240
there is a very great time

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:15.431
and that is called as 'Yugas [eras].

00:38:16.017 --> 00:38:21.279
Like that, these Incarnations come on this Earth.

00:38:21.572 --> 00:38:27.881
Plus the incarnations of the Primordial Being come in this area [Void]

00:38:27.881 --> 00:38:32.126
- where we can say this is the Ocean of Illusions -

00:38:32.126 --> 00:38:35.818
and try to save the people

00:38:35.818 --> 00:38:43.189
from getting too much to that side [right] or to this side [left] as I told you yesterday.

00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:50.565
And that time, when they become human beings,

00:38:50.565 --> 00:38:55.556
then the seekers are born, which you are,

00:38:55.556 --> 00:39:03.070
which are the epitome, epitome of human evolution.

00:39:03.363 --> 00:39:12.662
Now these seekers are engulfed by forces of ignorance

00:39:12.662 --> 00:39:17.342
and these ignorance forces also form anti-Christ.

00:39:17.342 --> 00:39:25.598
They can be devilish because they think, “Why are we not there?” like a competition setting.

00:39:25.598 --> 00:39:31.755
And they try to retard the progress of the saints.

00:39:31.755 --> 00:39:37.427
That’s why a seeker, when he’s born, is attacked,

00:39:37.818 --> 00:39:44.121
from very childhood, immediately he is attacked.

00:39:44.121 --> 00:39:47.398
Even the parents may attack the seeker.

00:39:47.398 --> 00:39:49.588
They may act through the parents.

00:39:49.588 --> 00:39:54.238
If not the parents, then the society, the schools.

00:39:54.238 --> 00:39:56.717
They’re all the time attacked.

00:39:56.717 --> 00:40:05.185
The people who are attacking may not be aware of it but they are used as mediums and these people are attacked.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:12.596
And with that attack, when they are absolutely in a mess,

00:40:12.841 --> 00:40:17.255
and they don’t know how to save themselves,

00:40:17.499 --> 00:40:23.434
then, another Incarnation is specially made,

00:40:24.314 --> 00:40:29.488
is the One that manifest here

00:40:29.488 --> 00:40:39.079
who is the desire Power of God, but is the Destroyer part,

00:40:39.421 --> 00:40:49.441
who is born to destroy these evil forces, to kill them.

00:40:51.151 --> 00:41:03.023
This is 14 thousand years back, the first incarnation of this great Lady.

00:41:04.391 --> 00:41:10.888
She’s called as Jagadamba, the Mother of this world.

00:41:10.888 --> 00:41:16.717
She comes in there [centre heart]. She saves them.

00:41:16.717 --> 00:41:26.235
Today is the first day, we celebrated the first day of an Incarnation

00:41:26.235 --> 00:41:37.041
and that is a very, very important day for Indians, because they believe in Shakti and She is the Shakti,

00:41:37.041 --> 00:41:45.735
that she came on this earth to kill these horrible devilish incarnations

00:41:45.735 --> 00:41:50.678
who are called as rakshasas.

00:41:51.313 --> 00:41:57.368
So this part is represented within us

00:41:57.368 --> 00:42:07.540
at the heart level in the centre, in the vertical column

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:14.373
and it manifests in the children till the age of 12 in the sternum

00:42:14.373 --> 00:42:20.894
and creates antibodies. She creates Her army as the antibodies.

00:42:20.894 --> 00:42:25.614
Till the age of 12 years the children develop those antibodies within themselves

00:42:25.614 --> 00:42:36.415
and whenever there is a danger, whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual danger,

00:42:36.415 --> 00:42:40.819
these antibodies fight.

00:42:40.819 --> 00:42:45.999
That’s why, when you are frightened, the sternum starts breathing fast

00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:58.205
and informs that all the antibodies should join hands to protect the subject.

00:42:58.596 --> 00:43:03.335
These antibodies are created here [centre heart].

00:43:03.335 --> 00:43:17.605
And the left hand side, left had side of this [left heart] is the essence of Motherhood.

00:43:17.947 --> 00:43:25.181
If in your childhood, your Mother had played a role

00:43:25.377 --> 00:43:34.760
which has given you fears or kind of a frightening experience, then this center goes out.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.476
We say the left heart is catching.

00:43:38.965 --> 00:43:43.670
Sometimes, if you are a bad mother also it might catch.

00:43:44.012 --> 00:43:50.033
The right heart is the one, is that of the father.

00:43:50.033 --> 00:43:57.696
And the fatherhood is expressed by the leader who came on this earth about 8 thousand years back,

00:43:57.696 --> 00:44:00.140
who is called as Shri Rama.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:04.052
He is not - if  you see here, He’s in the center.

00:44:04.052 --> 00:44:10.307
To make him a complete human being, He was pushed onto the right-hand side.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.044
He is Shri Rama.

00:44:13.044 --> 00:44:20.935
Shri Rama came on this earth to establish the institution of benevolent king.

00:44:21.717 --> 00:44:28.070
The political development and the political evolution started from his side.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:32.714
He is the one who gave leadership as a benevolent king,

00:44:32.714 --> 00:44:43.807
the one who represents God and who is a king. The idea of a king related to God came from Shri Rama.

00:44:43.807 --> 00:44:49.487
But the modern Kings are not like that, they have no relation with God.

00:44:49.487 --> 00:44:56.085
On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people.

00:44:56.085 --> 00:44:58.774
Absolutely Satan they are!

00:44:58.774 --> 00:45:03.806
And you can see from the way they lead their lives and they have led their life before

00:45:03.806 --> 00:45:09.919
So the benevolence of Shri Rama is here to be followed

00:45:09.919 --> 00:45:17.469
by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs.

00:45:17.469 --> 00:45:21.943
He is the ideal that was created for human beings,

00:45:21.943 --> 00:45:29.454
to run their authority as the head,

00:45:29.454 --> 00:45:36.717
or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people,

00:45:36.717 --> 00:45:41.796
who has to govern them by making them respectful,

00:45:41.796 --> 00:45:45.070
by respect.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:54.748
And if human beings create such kings who are not respectable,

00:45:54.748 --> 00:46:00.230
those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage,

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:04.576
those who are selfish, those who are self-centred,

00:46:04.726 --> 00:46:08.841
then they have nothing to do to be there.

00:46:09.525 --> 00:46:13.983
So this is the position of Rama who is the father.

00:46:13.983 --> 00:46:20.377
So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects,

00:46:20.377 --> 00:46:28.392
that’s what He has tried to show by his life. So much so that He had to sacrifice his beloved Wife,

00:46:28.392 --> 00:46:31.814
whom He loved so much.

00:46:32.254 --> 00:46:37.596
But these days, you know, how people do for their own children, they’ll sell the whole country.

00:46:37.596 --> 00:46:40.525
In our India, they do it.

00:46:40.525 --> 00:46:47.323
Here it’s just the other way round, nobody cares for children at all and nobody knows whose children they are.

00:46:47.323 --> 00:46:55.318
But in India it’s the other way round, that they will even sell their country for their children.

00:46:55.318 --> 00:47:00.907
All these two extremes go against the character of Shri Rama.

00:47:01.836 --> 00:47:07.195
Now this is the character that was created 8 thousand years back.

00:47:07.195 --> 00:47:13.949
So I’ve explaining to you all these things.
Now this is the heart. In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:47:13.949 --> 00:47:20.853
The Spirit is watching the game of this creation,

00:47:21.391 --> 00:47:30.456
and is watching what is happening to this person, this person, to this person, to this person.

00:47:30.456 --> 00:47:37.091
Every body has got in their heart the Spirit

00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:40.979
which is watching.
It’s called as the “cetana” [consciousness],

00:47:40.979 --> 00:47:44.229
means the one, the knower of the field.

00:47:44.229 --> 00:47:51.874
So, he’s watching every minute; he knows what you do, when you go, what mistakes you create, he watching,

00:47:51.874 --> 00:47:54.819
he doesn’t interfere.

00:47:54.819 --> 00:47:59.364
He’s only- the interference comes from here [Swaddisthan?], from that thing,

00:47:59.364 --> 00:48:03.619
He tries to give you conscience, he tries to improve you.

00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:08.740
From here sometimes [Mooladhara], the wisdom part, he tries to tell you, “Be in the center”

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:12.707
by punishing you and showing it is wrong.

00:48:12.707 --> 00:48:19.103
But he’s just watching the game, “Let’s see how far it goes.”

00:48:19.103 --> 00:48:23.165
He is 'the knower of your field'.

00:48:23.165 --> 00:48:27.291
He is the Universal Being within you.

00:48:27.291 --> 00:48:34.231
He is the reflection of that God Almighty who’s the Spectator within you.

00:48:34.671 --> 00:48:43.152
And his Power is this All-pervading Power which has created all this [the subtle system].

00:48:43.787 --> 00:48:50.692
So to feel this All-pervading Power, you have to become the Spirit.

00:48:50.692 --> 00:48:54.639
All this creation has no meaning if you do not become the Spirit.

00:48:54.639 --> 00:48:59.589
In the Vedas, the first, the very first stanza says that,

00:48:59.589 --> 00:49:03.193
"By reading Vedas, if you do not become Vedis [ wise men]

00:49:03.193 --> 00:49:07.472
-Vedinies- 'Veda' word comes from 'vidya'. Vidya means to know;

00:49:07.472 --> 00:49:12.492
if you don’t become the knowledge, then it has no meaning.

00:49:12.492 --> 00:49:21.838
But knowledge doesn’t lie in dancing and shouting and all the monkey tricks that people do;

00:49:22.132 --> 00:49:24.331
it’s no monkey tricks there.

00:49:24.673 --> 00:49:32.814
Knowledge is that you become the Self, you feel the All-pervading Power and by which you know everything else.

00:49:32.814 --> 00:49:39.316
That is Self-knowledge and that is what we have to achieve.

00:49:40.098 --> 00:49:47.296
If you do not want to become your Spirit,
I’m sorry, I’ve nothing to offer.

00:49:47.296 --> 00:49:53.637
If you have some other things in your mind, you can go away from here, but no use arguing it,

00:49:53.637 --> 00:50:00.430
there should be no argument about it.
If you don’t want to become, I have nothing to say,

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:04.048
I’ve nothing else to offer or to request you.

00:50:04.048 --> 00:50:12.333
I would request you that you become your Spirit, then we’ll talk about it.

00:50:12.333 --> 00:50:17.220
And when you become your Spirit - there’s a very good book

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:20.618
written by Adi Shankaracharya in the 6 century,

00:50:20.618 --> 00:50:24.797
the one who was the first Shankaracharya, nowadays all of them are horrible ones.

00:50:24.797 --> 00:50:30.952
One of them is now making a big umbrella of gold, set with diamonds, imagine!

00:50:30.952 --> 00:50:36.717
He’s a short fellow. I said,
"This umbrella will fall upon him one day".

00:50:36.717 --> 00:50:41.461
He’s trying to compete with Pope.

00:50:41.461 --> 00:50:45.860
And this Adi Shankaracharya has said that,

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:53.703
"Nothing can work it out, no Yoge, no shankye, no. All these philosophies are useless.

00:50:53.703 --> 00:50:59.573
It only works out- no discipline, nothing-

00:50:59.573 --> 00:51:02.390
by the Grace of the Mother;

00:51:02.586 --> 00:51:09.228
by the Grace of the Mother who is the Kundalini herself, She’s the Primordial Kundalini.

00:51:09.228 --> 00:51:15.278
Only by the awakening of the Kundalini it works out. It’s clearly given but you people do not read those books.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:21.044
Today is the name of the Goddess. Ten of them are nothing but the different chakras,

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:24.898
where She resides in the Mooladhara. She resides in the Swadhishthana.

00:51:24.898 --> 00:51:31.789
She resides in the Manipura, She resides in the - what you call - this Hridaya (heart) chakra.

00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:36.725
Then She resides in the Vishuddhi, then into Agnya, and then into Sahasrara.

00:51:37.311 --> 00:51:39.802
All these names are given there.

00:51:39.802 --> 00:51:45.649
Of course, it was not so clearly said as it is said today because the time was not there to say.

00:51:45.649 --> 00:51:50.661
But all these things are there: how she rises, how she breaks all these “granthis”

00:51:50.661 --> 00:51:55.034
which are between these two chakras, are the “granthis” means the knots.

00:51:55.034 --> 00:51:57.803
It’s so clearly given.

00:51:57.803 --> 00:52:01.112
It’s never given that you start jumping like a monkey,

00:52:01.112 --> 00:52:03.758
or you take out your clothes.

00:52:03.758 --> 00:52:08.455
All this nonsense is not there, on the contrary, it is said that this is all possession.

00:52:08.455 --> 00:52:14.323
You get “bhootagrasta”, means you get possessed by the dead.

00:52:14.616 --> 00:52:16.717
It’s so clearly given!

00:52:16.717 --> 00:52:25.708
But people don’t read these books: they jump onto people who have come here to show some sort of a mesmerism

00:52:25.708 --> 00:52:28.124
and accept it. But you are seekers.

00:52:28.124 --> 00:52:32.795
I would request you, you are seekers, first of all know that you are seekers

00:52:32.795 --> 00:52:37.340
and don’t be deluded by these false tricks.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:43.302
Do not waste your energy on these false things, you’ll become your Self.

00:52:43.302 --> 00:52:46.987
Of course, it goes without saying that

00:52:46.987 --> 00:52:52.460
the change, the transformation, comes in, in your awareness,

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:56.663
first of all, in your awareness.

00:52:56.663 --> 00:53:03.639
Not in jumping and none of all these nonsensical things. I mean people think that if you become a stupid fellow,

00:53:03.639 --> 00:53:05.154
then your awareness has improved.

00:53:05.154 --> 00:53:10.285
Transformed, after all, after all you are transformed, you see, your were a sane person, you’ve become stupid.

00:53:10.285 --> 00:53:13.165
You are transformed in any case.

00:53:13.165 --> 00:53:19.250
If you become mad, then is it a greater transformation. Mother says, “All right, transformation. You have become mad!"

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:25.677
You're sane people, you are landing in a lunatic asylum, you are transformed. And also transmutation has taken place.

00:53:25.677 --> 00:53:29.782
"Because now we wear dresses like lunatic people,

00:53:29.782 --> 00:53:32.745
we behave like lunatic people, transformation has taken place".

00:53:32.745 --> 00:53:38.099
It’s an ascent of the mind, you have to ascend.

00:53:38.099 --> 00:53:43.936
Your awareness has to ascend and not to descend. It’s very easy to descend.

00:53:43.936 --> 00:53:50.871
To move on to the left or to the right is not the way, but to move here into Super Consciousness.

00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:54.924
And that’s one thing one should know, should happen to you.

00:53:54.924 --> 00:53:59.736
That is the Self-knowledge. That is the thing one has to get

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:06.961
is to awaken these centres within you which are represented on your fingers here,

00:54:06.961 --> 00:54:13.836
seven of these are shown here and then to feel the All-pervading Power to begin with.

00:54:13.836 --> 00:54:17.611
Once it has happened, then to know how to discern,

00:54:17.611 --> 00:54:22.544
how to decode, how to find out, how to improve, how to go further with it.

00:54:22.544 --> 00:54:25.224
First of all, get the connection!

00:54:25.224 --> 00:54:29.909
If your car has not yet started, what are you doing about it?

00:54:29.909 --> 00:54:37.447
It’s so simple and such a common sense, but I don’t know how these people have taken over it.

00:54:37.838 --> 00:54:44.774
The only problem, as I told you before, is this, that God has given you freedom.

00:54:45.165 --> 00:54:48.436
And that freedom is to be respected.

00:54:48.436 --> 00:54:54.015
But if you go to these people, you don’t ask any questions, you do as others are doing, just like monkeys.

00:54:54.015 --> 00:54:58.320
You don’t even think why they are doing it. I mean you see that it is so filthy!

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:03.501
Like a gentleman who came to me, who went to a guru, and he was absolutely ruined.

00:55:03.501 --> 00:55:06.042
I said:  "How could you do it? You are an Indian.

00:55:06.042 --> 00:55:09.951
Don’t you know that this is not to be done?" He said, "I just tried to see.

00:55:09.951 --> 00:55:16.098
Just out of curiosity I went there. And then I also started jumping and I got into it".

00:55:16.489 --> 00:55:22.003
And for five years he was in it, he could not know that he was in it.

00:55:22.003 --> 00:55:26.380
I said, "For Indians they have some wisdom because they have read all these things, they know all about it.

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:28.726
How could you do it?"

00:55:29.068 --> 00:55:34.932
They know that unholiness is not the way to God.

00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:45.120
Now, some of them can give you also an explanation that all your- you are to be cleansed.

00:55:45.706 --> 00:55:50.466
And you pay for it as if you go to some a laundry here, you pay for it,

00:55:50.466 --> 00:55:55.360
you put yourself into it, go into some turnings and you become cleansed.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.760
You are to be cleansed.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.298
You must see their life pattern, you see, you must see how they live.

00:56:01.298 --> 00:56:04.835
The person who cannot even smell a flower how can he cleanse you?"

00:56:04.835 --> 00:56:10.755
He himself needs a lot of treatment.

00:56:10.755 --> 00:56:16.037
Flower he cannot smell, can you imagine a man like that who cannot smell a flower?

00:56:16.037 --> 00:56:19.369
I mean he’s a dumb personality I would say,

00:56:19.369 --> 00:56:25.335
the most beautiful thing that is produced is a flower, how is he going to feel the human flowers?

00:56:25.335 --> 00:56:28.318
How is he going to enjoy?

00:56:28.709 --> 00:56:35.551
A person who cannot take out his goggles from his eyes and can’t face people,

00:56:35.551 --> 00:56:40.141
how can you believe that such a man could be something holy?

00:56:40.141 --> 00:56:45.204
Any holy person doesn’t have this kind of eyes.

00:56:45.204 --> 00:56:53.023
One has to know that if the person doesn’t lead a holy life and parasites,

00:56:53.365 --> 00:57:00.092
greedy  people, asking for money and Roll Royce and things like that, how such people, you think they can be a guru?

00:57:00.092 --> 00:57:03.506
You have no self esteem I should say.

00:57:03.506 --> 00:57:06.717
They are absolutely devils.

00:57:06.717 --> 00:57:11.518
But the problem in this, for me, the problem is very, very different.

00:57:11.518 --> 00:57:17.742
Krishna has said, "Yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata…

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:23.754
Paritranaya sadhunang vinashay cha dushkritam
…sambhabami yuge"

00:57:23.754 --> 00:57:30.978
He said that, "Whenever there is the degradation of the sustenance,

00:57:30.978 --> 00:57:40.575
then, to save the Saints and to kill the Satanics,

00:57:40.575 --> 00:57:47.270
I come on this earth and take a form."

00:57:47.563 --> 00:57:54.870
Now the problem is, all the Saints have got these Satanics in their heads. My problem is very complicated.

00:57:54.870 --> 00:58:00.589
I know they are Saints, I know there are the ones who are seekers and have been for ages,

00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:06.478
but they are impressed by the Satanics and the Satanics are ruling.

00:58:07.211 --> 00:58:14.665
So if any- if the question of killing, 'samarak', of Krishna  comes in, you see, even if they are killed

00:58:14.665 --> 00:58:18.231
they are in your brains, then how can you kill?

00:58:18.231 --> 00:58:25.509
They have to go out of your brain. The complicated structure today of the seekers is this,

00:58:25.509 --> 00:58:31.664
that in their brains they have got all the Satanics centred, they cannot get rid of it.

00:58:31.664 --> 00:58:33.701
They are so impressed!

00:58:33.701 --> 00:58:40.853
Yesterday, the fellow said, "But Mother, everything is good, there is nothing like evil." I said, "Really?"

00:58:40.853 --> 00:58:53.676
You can imagine To believe in such a thing

00:58:53.676 --> 00:58:56.318
Then why do you need discrimination? Go ahead.

00:58:56.318 --> 00:59:01.048
Whether you go to hell or to heaven what does it matter? If there is no evil,

00:59:01.048 --> 00:59:07.382
enjoy your Hell! Have a holiday!

00:59:08.115 --> 00:59:13.609
Christ has so many times said about the Satan.

00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:18.471
Not only but He said that the Satan tried to tempt Him.

00:59:18.471 --> 00:59:25.704
He has talked of Satan and still, how do you believe that there is no evil? I just can’t understand.

00:59:31.138 --> 00:59:36.572
There is not only evil but the darkness is so great

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:43.010
that we are standing at a point so precariously placed,  very precarious placed

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:51.171
that people are more impressed by evil than by good. See how many people we are. Just see for yourself.

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:58.162
Here we are for reality, you cannot pay for anything, you get your Realization,

00:59:58.162 --> 01:00:01.015
50% people have got Realization here,

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:04.418
but how many people there are? And they have no patience even to sit down

01:00:04.418 --> 01:00:09.639
but I’ve known people: "I’ve been with a guru for 8 years. He is in my heart".

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:15.188
The heart is all catching and you’re fainting all the time with the guru being there.

01:00:15.432 --> 01:00:19.658
The very big problem which you should realize these are all saints.

01:00:19.903 --> 01:00:25.670
My only concern is to save them.

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:33.624
There are very subtle methods of sabotising of destroying the work of God.

01:00:33.624 --> 01:00:41.150
And you should know, when you get your Realization, that you have to become strong pillars of God’s work

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:51.750
and not indulging into frivolous, useless, cheep things. But get to it, learn it, master it. You’ll become your own master.

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:56.638
These gurus who have no powers, nothing, they have become gurus and have minted so much money out of you

01:00:56.638 --> 01:01:01.445
and you are the people who are Realized souls and you are so quiet.

01:01:01.445 --> 01:01:07.750
You should shout at the top of houses and say that these are false people,

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:15.268
these are fake people. Christ himself has said that there will be false and fake gurus.

01:01:15.268 --> 01:01:19.068
And then people said that, "Why are you talking against them?"

01:01:19.068 --> 01:01:24.689
He said, "The Satan is are not going to talk against himself, his house".

01:01:24.689 --> 01:01:28.403
He said it clearly.

01:01:28.892 --> 01:01:35.213
And when people tell me, "Mother, don’t talk against them". I say, I always tell them, "I’ll talk, not only talk,

01:01:35.213 --> 01:01:39.699
but where ever it is possible, I'll tell them definitely,

01:01:39.699 --> 01:01:46.717
I'll verily say that these are Satan whom I know now for ages, for thousands of years, I’ve known them,

01:01:46.717 --> 01:01:51.500
each one of them, all their tricks I know. I know what they do to you.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:57.132
And don’t listen to them that they are cleansing you. Let them cleanse themselves and repent

01:01:57.132 --> 01:02:01.812
so that they don’t go back into Hell permanently.

01:02:02.056 --> 01:02:09.327
So here, at this stage of the Mother, She’s terrific.

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:17.931
She protects you. She has many antibodies.

01:02:17.931 --> 01:02:29.117
Actually, these antibodies were created at a particular time when it was said that there was a Satan who could not be killed

01:02:29.117 --> 01:02:34.969
by the quadruped and the people who have two legs like human beings.

01:02:35.799 --> 01:02:47.234
So She created a special type of  a – gnat, you call that gnat? A black thing, with six legs,

01:02:47.234 --> 01:02:53.508
and She killed him. And these antibodies are those with the six legs.

01:02:53.508 --> 01:02:56.258
And they worked it out.

01:02:56.258 --> 01:03:00.595
There are there and She’s the one who protects us.

01:03:01.328 --> 01:03:09.266
Now, coming to the gross level, when a lady is worried

01:03:09.266 --> 01:03:16.924
about her security, which is very common in America, because husbands, if they have flirts,

01:03:16.924 --> 01:03:23.326
if they have no time for their wives, and if all the time, they tell the wife that, "You may have to leave the house",

01:03:23.326 --> 01:03:29.004
they develop the fear in this area [heart centre].

01:03:29.004 --> 01:03:40.358
And the disease which is caused by that is breast cancer, which is very common in America, breast cancer.

01:03:41.092 --> 01:03:45.734
Breast cancer is caused to women who have a sense of insecurity.

01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:49.280
In Sahaja Yoga, you can cure breast cancer.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.508
It’s very easy to cure breast cancer in Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:54.801 --> 01:04:00.284
Now the combination of this and this gives you asthma.

01:04:00.284 --> 01:04:06.295
Among men who have asthma, they must look after their fatherhood.

01:04:06.637 --> 01:04:11.652
Their own father- supposing somebody’s father is dead

01:04:11.994 --> 01:04:17.287
without the knowledge of the man or the father can possess also.

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:21.069
In that case, you get this kind of a thing.

01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:26.717
Surprisingly, recently in London, one doctor, I don’t know how,

01:04:26.717 --> 01:04:32.875
he experimented with a lady that was suffering from anorexia.

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:39.208
Her father had died and she would not eat her food.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:44.435
And many of them are like that whose father has died, they suffer from anorexia.

01:04:44.435 --> 01:04:51.500
And he said, "All right, let us see about your father. Let us do some sort of a ceremony for him."

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:55.585
And she started eating all right, it’s most surprising.

01:04:55.585 --> 01:04:58.307
It came in the paper that he did that.

01:04:58.307 --> 01:05:05.526
That is how you can cure such women who suffer from a deficiency of a fatherhood;

01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:13.468
or may be we can say, if the father possessed you, if the child is thinking of the father all the time,

01:05:13.468 --> 01:05:15.835
all these things can be cured in Sahaja Yoga,

01:05:15.835 --> 01:05:21.092
which, I’m sure, when you will go further in the studies of Sahaja Yoga,

01:05:21.092 --> 01:05:27.286
you will learn one by one, how to cure such people who have these diseases.

01:05:28.459 --> 01:05:36.156
Now, I think I’ll leave these three centres for tomorrow and I’ll try to cover it up.

01:05:36.156 --> 01:05:41.056
But this is the Spirit that is still watching.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:44.943
When the Kundalini –this is the seat of the Spirit -

01:05:44.943 --> 01:05:49.248
when the Kundalini rises and she touches that seat,

01:05:49.248 --> 01:05:56.717
immediately, you get connected to the Spirit.

01:05:56.717 --> 01:06:01.459
And the Spirit, which is this All-pervading Power

01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:08.633
starts flowing through your hands as well as you start feeling it outside.

01:06:09.024 --> 01:06:15.720
The Spectator, the Witness, who was outside our central nervous system,

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:21.041
now comes into our central nervous system and we know everything about it.

01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:25.976
as we start using this power of Spirit.

01:06:25.976 --> 01:06:29.785
If you remember, Christ was touched by some woman who was sick,

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:34.235
and He felt the power flew to her and this is the same thing.

01:06:34.235 --> 01:06:41.002
But Christ was different. He was All-pervading Power. He was Omkara,

01:06:41.002 --> 01:06:44.814
that’s why He could walk on the water.

01:06:44.814 --> 01:06:52.389
But about Christ and about Shri Krishna, I’ll tell you later on, tomorrow, if you don’t mind.
