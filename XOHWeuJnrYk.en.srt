You have to put My Feet into your heart.

3
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:23,258
Just My Feet into your heart.

4
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:31,251
Because photo, face, everything might be an illusion.

5
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:41,727
Might be, by seeing My Face you do not get over your barriers.

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,571
To say, “I must see Mother. I must do this.

7
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:54,664
Mother must come to my house. She must have food at my place.

8
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:58,003
She must visit my home.” All this is so stupid.

9
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:01,800
I cannot understand what’s the matter with these people.

10
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:10,141
“Mother, please come in my heart.

11
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,336
Let me clean my heart so that You are there.

12
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:16,269
Put Your Feet into my heart.

13
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:22,550
Let Your Feet be worshipped in my heart.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,597
Let me not be in delusion.

15
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:31,594
Take me away from illusions.

16
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:34,243
Keep me in reality.

17
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:38,738
Take away the sheen of superficiality.

18
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:43,391
Let me enjoy Your Feet in my heart.

19
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:46,331
Let me see Your Feet in my heart.”
