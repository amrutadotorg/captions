00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
I have known of people who were caught up
with Left Vishuddhis and have become devilish

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.400
by nature, devilish.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.610
They have gone out of Sahaja Yoga, they have
criticised Sahaja Yoga, they have tried to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.269
trouble Me a lot.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.590
So don’t think that, if Vishuddhi is spoiled,
there’s nothing so special about it.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.920
It can be a very dangerous centre.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.420
Of course, Heart, Agnya and Vishuddhi, these
three centres, one has to guard against, because

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:42.149
three of them can allow you, or can force
you, to become one with identification of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.980
evil as your own.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.160
You might just feel that it’s nice to be
evil.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.030
You might just feel that it is a great fun
to be evil, and you might become evil.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.119
So, at the Vishuddhi chakra, one has to be
extremely careful.

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.409
Vishuddhi chakra looks after so many things,
specially your skin, your eyes.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.610
Skin is now, I have seen people who have bad
Vishuddhi, can have all kinds of funny troubles

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.610
with their skins.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:28.409
Of course it has to do with your liver, but
skin is, the way it shines, the way it glows,

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.640
depends on how you smile, how you look at
the world.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.120
Many people have a habit of smiling for nothing
at all, especially women I have seen, ladies

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.440
I have seen, they just smile stupidly.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.180
That’s not proper.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.090
One should not be stupid.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.180
Stupidity is against Shri Krishna’s principle.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.219
Like, you have seen the stupid people, how
they are.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.869
Their tongue is always half way out.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:09.690
If you have noticed a stupid man, his face
is that, his tongue is always out, mouth half

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.230
open and he looks like a dumbfounded fool.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.110
Now in this only the Vishuddhi plays the part.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.290
Another one is the one where you get the Vishuddhi’s
strains.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:35.860
So such a person has very pursed lips, angry
lips, and he doesn’t talk.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:46.120
The another one might even get the expression
of an idiot but could be just making a face

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.820
like that.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:03:04.540
Because, if he’s cunning, he may take a,
I would say, a kind of a rupa (form), a mask

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.739
on his face, that he is an idiot and may try
to deceive you.

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.290
So nothing is definite about Vishuddhi.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.750
Whatever may be the expression of a person
– a person may look very innocent, because

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.150
that’s the thing you can do with your Vishuddhi.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.435
You are free because you have raised your
head, at this point you have achieved this

00:03:28.435 --> 00:03:36.320
kind of a special aptitude, that you can deceive
yourself and you can deceive others.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.819
Some people look extremely innocent on the
face.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.790
They may look to be very simple people, but
may turn out to be horrid.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.959
Some people may look to be idiotic but may
be very intelligent.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:59.480
So it is how you play with your Vishuddhi,
which is responsible, but the main thing what

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.610
I’m trying to tell you, that you can manoeuvre
your Vishuddhi.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.970
The way you want to put your expression, the
way you want to make your face, the way you

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.250
want to suggest something – all [these]
you can manoeuvre and you can keep your heart

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.250
away from it.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.070
In the heart, you may have poison for a person
but outwardly you may say to that person in

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.630
a very sweet manner something that the person
might feel impressed.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:33.440
But in this, all this behaviour, pattern of
behaviour, you are deceiving your Self, not

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.140
deceiving the another person, because your
Self is Spirit which knows you very well.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:46.810
And this will go on and on for all your lives
that have to come.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.790
So there is no need, in any way, to be artificial
in your expression.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.660
There is no need to hide anything in your
expression.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.289
Of course, I mean, if you don’t like someone,
you need not just say, “I don’t like you“.

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.919
But, in that case, you have to be not also
so much appreciative of the person that he’s

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.539
deluded into your appreciation.

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:18.930
Now, eyes are very important, and eyes, in
a way, are very much looked after by Vishuddhi

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:28.729
because the muscles of the eyes are looked
after by Vishuddhi.

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:35.240
Now the kind of muscles we have, which pull
our eyes, which close our eyelids and all

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.710
that, is very much suggestive.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.320
You must notice that there are some people
who come to Me, their eyes go on like this

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.720
(flickering), when they close their eyes,
they cannot keep it shut.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.780
There are some people, when they open their
eyes to Me, they just keep the eyes open,

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.900
they just cannot close it.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.390
Both are in trouble.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:06.550
The ones which are just keeping the eyes open
all the time, are the people having supra-conscious

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.569
problems.

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:13.319
And those who are flickering their eyes are
having the sub-conscious problem.

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:20.610
Some people have also the habit of keeping
the eyes in an angle all the time, they never

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.910
see you straight but in an angle they’ll
see you (laughter).

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.940
They think it’s sometimes, it’s very fashionable,
sometimes.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.759
Ladies think it’s a very good way of looking
at people.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.150
And some of them have such eyes that they’ll
go on, you know, looking and pouring their

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.270
greedy eyes onto others, or their lusty eyes
onto others.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.800
This is the worst thing you can do to your
eyes because such people easily can become

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:58.110
blind, such people might have trouble of the
eyes, specially reddening of the eyes can

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.260
come to such people, very much, very quickly.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:09.140
So one has to be careful to keep the eyes
very pure, the eyes of an Yogeshwara, who

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.670
was Shri Krishna.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.230
He was a witness.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:18.840
He was on this earth, He played with Radha.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.560
He married five women, they were the Five
Elements.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.530
Sixteen thousand women He married – they
were His sixteen thousand Powers.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.070
But He was Yogeshwara, He was Yogeshwara.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.430
He had no lust in His eyes, in His mind about
them at all.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.310
He was beyond that.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.979
He was Yogeshwara.

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:45.220
That was the testing point of His, that He
had no lust in His eyes about these women

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.220
that He had.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.539
Such an Yogeshwara is there.

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:51.900
Of course, I don’t expect you to be Shri
Krishna.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:59.039
But you have your wife, those who do not have
wife must look forward to a wife.

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:05.419
That, “We’ll get wives and we’ll have
a wife, ” and think of a wife who will be

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:11.199
your own, so that your eyes will not fall
onto every woman who comes across with that

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.470
kind of a thing.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.130
I have seen people, even the photographs or
anything they see, it’s surprising!

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.620
I mean there’s nothing in a photograph,
what is in a photograph?

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.500
But even a photograph can attract their attention.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:27.060
I mean, I don’t know what can attract their
attention like this but they are so vulnerable

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.410
and they have no control over their eyes,
no control.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.080
They become absolutely lost and they have
no control.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.620
That shows that they have no powers in them
and they are slaves of their responses.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.560
So the eyes are very, very important.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.000
As Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have
adulterous eyes“.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.740
There should be no adultery.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.410
Some people have a habit of showing anger
with the eyes.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.791
You see, if they have to show anger they’ll
just go on looking like this and show the

00:08:57.791 --> 00:08:58.791
anger.

00:08:58.791 --> 00:08:59.791
I need, dare not, do that to you but still.

00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:10.770
(laughter) And the angry eyes, you see, are
another dangerous things to do, with your

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.560
eyes, because then they can become mesmeric.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.940
If you start putting your eyes onto something
and concentrating on it, your eyes might become

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.040
mesmeric, means bhoots will start coming out
of your eyes.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.149
First of all, you’ll catch bhoots in your
eyes, they’ll settle down there and then

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:29.120
they will be falling on other people as bhoots.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:37.390
It’s a very, very dangerous thing, to go
on looking at something continuously with

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.390
concentration.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:43.860
There’s another kind of a stupid thing,
or a bhootish thing maybe, that people ask

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.310
you to meditate here (at Agnya), it’s absolutely
wrong.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.550
[Even though] in Gita it is written, still
it is wrong.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.769
Nobody should put attention here.

00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:57.230
If they have to put attention, put attention
at the door.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.190
What’s the use of looking at a window?

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.250
You can’t get out of it, can you?

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.820
If you have to look at anything, be on the
lookout for the door.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.490
And the door is here.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:15.120
The door of Sahastrara is to be opened out,
so you should not try to concentrate on this

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.160
part.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.230
Many people who have concentrated on this
part have become mad.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:26.300
When they become mad, people say “He’s
a Yogi, but has got unmanitasha” – that

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.990
he moves like a madcap.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.990
How can a Yogi be a madcap?

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.550
That means he’s united with God, is He mad?

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.520
All such mad people are really mad!

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.250
They have nothing to do with God, definitely.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:47.170
But, there are people who believe in such
things – “Oh, he is in love with God,

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:52.709
so he just jumps on the stage and goes into
ecstasy, dances like a madcap.”

00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:54.860
How can God be mad?

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.860
First position is this, that the sanest personality
is God.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.480
Has to be.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.830
From where do the sanity comes in?

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:13.010
So, this is one thing one has to understand,
that any such practices can lead you to lunacy,

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.570
and one should not do it.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:22.580
Thirdly, the indiscretion that one has, comes
from people who are good hearted, nice people,

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:30.610
but they get carried away by the smiles of
others or by the artificial goodness they

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.300
show on their faces.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.890
I’ve known some people, they always have
a face, like this, as if they are all the

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:36.890
time smiling.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.209
(Shri Mataji tries to demonstrate) I mean,
I can’t do that way.

00:11:38.209 --> 00:11:46.680
All the time, if you look at somebody like
this, you see, it means as if you are mocking

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.550
at the person.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:56.330
And there are people I have seen who are just
like this every time (a small child laughs),

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.269
and then like this!

00:11:58.269 --> 00:11:59.519
(Mother laughs).

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.260
So, one should not be always in one pose.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.080
Sometimes these muscles can get very weak
and start paining if you take one [pose].

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.170
There are some others who always try to show
that they are very miserable.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:17.800
I don’t know, what do they want to attract?

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.690
Attract the attention of others?

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.690
Attract the bhoots in themselves or, I don’t
know, what are they up to?

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.339
Why can’t they keep a normal face?

00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:32.410
Even while sitting in dhyan , or meditation,
I have seen them, trying to show Me, or whatever

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.150
it is, because My eyes are mostly closed,
but doesn’t matter.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.570
When I open My eyes, I find some people like
this, like that (looking at Her smiling).

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.570
Why?

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.570
What is the need?

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.090
(laughter)

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.339
You have to have a balanced face.

00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:49.240
That’s what Shri Krishna has described the
stitha pragnya (the witness state), the one

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.750
who is balanced.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:56.149
Who doesn’t laugh like an idiot.

00:12:56.149 --> 00:12:58.390
Who laughs, but not like an idiot!

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.980
Nor is a serious [type], like another kind
of an idiot!

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:12.329
So, both the things are not at all expression
of your inner being.

00:13:12.329 --> 00:13:19.370
Such a person is, as I told you today, is
not frivolous, but not serious either.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.400
But full of joy within himself.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:30.050
He doesn’t want you to be unhappy, never
would like that you should be unhappy people.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:35.410
But human beings, if they want to be unhappy,
what can anybody help, because they have got

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.410
the free will to be unhappy.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:41.490
They have got a free will to cut their nose,
they have a free will to cut their ears, they

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.360
have free will to commit suicide.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.270
They have this free will, so-called.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:53.959
Now, the greatest free will comes from Vishuddhi
chakra, as I told you.

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:57.250
And that’s why we call Him Yogeshwara.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.459
He is the Ishwara of Yoga.

00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:05.550
The establishment of yoga is possible when
you surrender yourself to Shri Krishna.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:13.100
[When you] completely surrender yourself to
Shri Krishna your yoga will be established.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.100
Means what?

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.980
Means all your balances will be established.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:29.579
You go into complete balance, and that balance
is complete because Vishnu, Who is the incarnation

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:37.579
for sustaining the dharma, Who is responsible
for giving you the balance, becomes complete

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.500
in the form of Shri Krishna.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:47.500
That’s why is said that you leave all the
dharmas – “Sarva dharmanam parityaja,

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.620
mamekam sharanam vraja”.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.840
That’s why “Surrender all of them to Me”.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:57.500
So all the dharmas, if you put it at the lotus
feet of Shri Krishna, means, if you follow

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:03.680
His ideals, then all your dharmas are balanced.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:11.000
But, after realisation, you go beyond dharma.
