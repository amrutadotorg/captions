00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
I have known of people who were caught up
with Left Vishuddhis and have become devilish

00:05.400 --> 00:06.400
by nature, devilish.

00:06.400 --> 00:11.610
They have gone out of Sahaja Yoga, they have
criticised Sahaja Yoga, they have tried to

00:11.610 --> 00:13.269
trouble Me a lot.

00:13.269 --> 00:18.590
So don’t think that, if Vishuddhi is spoiled,
there’s nothing so special about it.

00:18.590 --> 00:21.920
It can be a very dangerous centre.

00:21.920 --> 00:28.420
Of course, Heart, Agnya and Vishuddhi, these
three centres, one has to guard against, because

00:28.420 --> 00:42.149
three of them can allow you, or can force
you, to become one with identification of

00:42.149 --> 00:44.980
evil as your own.

00:44.980 --> 00:51.160
You might just feel that it’s nice to be
evil.

00:51.160 --> 00:59.030
You might just feel that it is a great fun
to be evil, and you might become evil.

00:59.030 --> 01:04.119
So, at the Vishuddhi chakra, one has to be
extremely careful.

01:04.119 --> 01:10.409
Vishuddhi chakra looks after so many things,
specially your skin, your eyes.

01:10.409 --> 01:17.610
Skin is now, I have seen people who have bad
Vishuddhi, can have all kinds of funny troubles

01:17.610 --> 01:18.610
with their skins.

01:18.610 --> 01:28.409
Of course it has to do with your liver, but
skin is, the way it shines, the way it glows,

01:28.409 --> 01:33.640
depends on how you smile, how you look at
the world.

01:33.640 --> 01:41.120
Many people have a habit of smiling for nothing
at all, especially women I have seen, ladies

01:41.120 --> 01:43.440
I have seen, they just smile stupidly.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.180
That’s not proper.

01:45.180 --> 01:48.090
One should not be stupid.

01:48.090 --> 01:52.180
Stupidity is against Shri Krishna’s principle.

01:52.180 --> 01:58.219
Like, you have seen the stupid people, how
they are.

01:58.219 --> 02:01.869
Their tongue is always half way out.

02:01.869 --> 02:09.690
If you have noticed a stupid man, his face
is that, his tongue is always out, mouth half

02:09.690 --> 02:15.230
open and he looks like a dumbfounded fool.

02:15.230 --> 02:19.110
Now in this only the Vishuddhi plays the part.

02:19.110 --> 02:26.290
Another one is the one where you get the Vishuddhi’s
strains.

02:26.290 --> 02:35.860
So such a person has very pursed lips, angry
lips, and he doesn’t talk.

02:35.860 --> 02:46.120
The another one might even get the expression
of an idiot but could be just making a face

02:46.120 --> 02:47.820
like that.

02:47.820 --> 03:04.540
Because, if he’s cunning, he may take a,
I would say, a kind of a rupa (form), a mask

03:04.540 --> 03:11.739
on his face, that he is an idiot and may try
to deceive you.

03:11.739 --> 03:16.290
So nothing is definite about Vishuddhi.

03:16.290 --> 03:21.750
Whatever may be the expression of a person
– a person may look very innocent, because

03:21.750 --> 03:25.150
that’s the thing you can do with your Vishuddhi.

03:25.150 --> 03:28.435
You are free because you have raised your
head, at this point you have achieved this

03:28.435 --> 03:36.320
kind of a special aptitude, that you can deceive
yourself and you can deceive others.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.819
Some people look extremely innocent on the
face.

03:38.819 --> 03:45.790
They may look to be very simple people, but
may turn out to be horrid.

03:45.790 --> 03:50.959
Some people may look to be idiotic but may
be very intelligent.

03:50.959 --> 03:59.480
So it is how you play with your Vishuddhi,
which is responsible, but the main thing what

03:59.480 --> 04:04.610
I’m trying to tell you, that you can manoeuvre
your Vishuddhi.

04:04.610 --> 04:08.970
The way you want to put your expression, the
way you want to make your face, the way you

04:08.970 --> 04:14.250
want to suggest something – all [these]
you can manoeuvre and you can keep your heart

04:14.250 --> 04:15.250
away from it.

04:15.250 --> 04:21.070
In the heart, you may have poison for a person
but outwardly you may say to that person in

04:21.070 --> 04:25.630
a very sweet manner something that the person
might feel impressed.

04:25.630 --> 04:33.440
But in this, all this behaviour, pattern of
behaviour, you are deceiving your Self, not

04:33.440 --> 04:39.140
deceiving the another person, because your
Self is Spirit which knows you very well.

04:39.140 --> 04:46.810
And this will go on and on for all your lives
that have to come.

04:46.810 --> 04:51.790
So there is no need, in any way, to be artificial
in your expression.

04:51.790 --> 04:56.660
There is no need to hide anything in your
expression.

04:56.660 --> 05:01.289
Of course, I mean, if you don’t like someone,
you need not just say, “I don’t like you“.

05:01.289 --> 05:07.919
But, in that case, you have to be not also
so much appreciative of the person that he’s

05:07.919 --> 05:10.539
deluded into your appreciation.

05:10.539 --> 05:18.930
Now, eyes are very important, and eyes, in
a way, are very much looked after by Vishuddhi

05:18.930 --> 05:28.729
because the muscles of the eyes are looked
after by Vishuddhi.

05:28.729 --> 05:35.240
Now the kind of muscles we have, which pull
our eyes, which close our eyelids and all

05:35.240 --> 05:37.710
that, is very much suggestive.

05:37.710 --> 05:43.320
You must notice that there are some people
who come to Me, their eyes go on like this

05:43.320 --> 05:46.720
(flickering), when they close their eyes,
they cannot keep it shut.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.780
There are some people, when they open their
eyes to Me, they just keep the eyes open,

05:50.780 --> 05:53.900
they just cannot close it.

05:53.900 --> 05:56.390
Both are in trouble.

05:56.390 --> 06:06.550
The ones which are just keeping the eyes open
all the time, are the people having supra-conscious

06:06.550 --> 06:07.569
problems.

06:07.569 --> 06:13.319
And those who are flickering their eyes are
having the sub-conscious problem.

06:13.319 --> 06:20.610
Some people have also the habit of keeping
the eyes in an angle all the time, they never

06:20.610 --> 06:24.910
see you straight but in an angle they’ll
see you (laughter).

06:24.910 --> 06:28.940
They think it’s sometimes, it’s very fashionable,
sometimes.

06:28.940 --> 06:32.759
Ladies think it’s a very good way of looking
at people.

06:32.759 --> 06:38.150
And some of them have such eyes that they’ll
go on, you know, looking and pouring their

06:38.150 --> 06:43.270
greedy eyes onto others, or their lusty eyes
onto others.

06:43.270 --> 06:49.800
This is the worst thing you can do to your
eyes because such people easily can become

06:49.800 --> 06:58.110
blind, such people might have trouble of the
eyes, specially reddening of the eyes can

06:58.110 --> 07:02.260
come to such people, very much, very quickly.

07:02.260 --> 07:09.140
So one has to be careful to keep the eyes
very pure, the eyes of an Yogeshwara, who

07:09.140 --> 07:10.670
was Shri Krishna.

07:10.670 --> 07:13.230
He was a witness.

07:13.230 --> 07:18.840
He was on this earth, He played with Radha.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.560
He married five women, they were the Five
Elements.

07:22.560 --> 07:27.530
Sixteen thousand women He married – they
were His sixteen thousand Powers.

07:27.530 --> 07:32.070
But He was Yogeshwara, He was Yogeshwara.

07:32.070 --> 07:36.430
He had no lust in His eyes, in His mind about
them at all.

07:36.430 --> 07:38.310
He was beyond that.

07:38.310 --> 07:39.979
He was Yogeshwara.

07:39.979 --> 07:45.220
That was the testing point of His, that He
had no lust in His eyes about these women

07:45.220 --> 07:46.220
that He had.

07:46.220 --> 07:48.539
Such an Yogeshwara is there.

07:48.539 --> 07:51.900
Of course, I don’t expect you to be Shri
Krishna.

07:51.900 --> 07:59.039
But you have your wife, those who do not have
wife must look forward to a wife.

07:59.039 --> 08:05.419
That, “We’ll get wives and we’ll have
a wife, ” and think of a wife who will be

08:05.419 --> 08:11.199
your own, so that your eyes will not fall
onto every woman who comes across with that

08:11.199 --> 08:12.470
kind of a thing.

08:12.470 --> 08:16.130
I have seen people, even the photographs or
anything they see, it’s surprising!

08:16.130 --> 08:19.620
I mean there’s nothing in a photograph,
what is in a photograph?

08:19.620 --> 08:21.500
But even a photograph can attract their attention.

08:21.500 --> 08:27.060
I mean, I don’t know what can attract their
attention like this but they are so vulnerable

08:27.060 --> 08:30.410
and they have no control over their eyes,
no control.

08:30.410 --> 08:34.080
They become absolutely lost and they have
no control.

08:34.080 --> 08:39.620
That shows that they have no powers in them
and they are slaves of their responses.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.560
So the eyes are very, very important.

08:42.560 --> 08:47.000
As Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have
adulterous eyes“.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.740
There should be no adultery.

08:49.740 --> 08:53.410
Some people have a habit of showing anger
with the eyes.

08:53.410 --> 08:57.791
You see, if they have to show anger they’ll
just go on looking like this and show the

08:57.791 --> 08:58.791
anger.

08:58.791 --> 08:59.791
I need, dare not, do that to you but still.

08:59.791 --> 09:10.770
(laughter) And the angry eyes, you see, are
another dangerous things to do, with your

09:10.770 --> 09:13.560
eyes, because then they can become mesmeric.

09:13.560 --> 09:18.940
If you start putting your eyes onto something
and concentrating on it, your eyes might become

09:18.940 --> 09:22.040
mesmeric, means bhoots will start coming out
of your eyes.

09:22.040 --> 09:26.149
First of all, you’ll catch bhoots in your
eyes, they’ll settle down there and then

09:26.149 --> 09:29.120
they will be falling on other people as bhoots.

09:29.120 --> 09:37.390
It’s a very, very dangerous thing, to go
on looking at something continuously with

09:37.390 --> 09:38.390
concentration.

09:38.390 --> 09:43.860
There’s another kind of a stupid thing,
or a bhootish thing maybe, that people ask

09:43.860 --> 09:47.310
you to meditate here (at Agnya), it’s absolutely
wrong.

09:47.310 --> 09:51.550
[Even though] in Gita it is written, still
it is wrong.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.769
Nobody should put attention here.

09:53.769 --> 09:57.230
If they have to put attention, put attention
at the door.

09:57.230 --> 10:01.190
What’s the use of looking at a window?

10:01.190 --> 10:03.250
You can’t get out of it, can you?

10:03.250 --> 10:07.820
If you have to look at anything, be on the
lookout for the door.

10:07.820 --> 10:09.490
And the door is here.

10:09.490 --> 10:15.120
The door of Sahastrara is to be opened out,
so you should not try to concentrate on this

10:15.120 --> 10:17.160
part.

10:17.160 --> 10:20.230
Many people who have concentrated on this
part have become mad.

10:20.230 --> 10:26.300
When they become mad, people say “He’s
a Yogi, but has got unmanitasha” – that

10:26.300 --> 10:28.990
he moves like a madcap.

10:28.990 --> 10:30.990
How can a Yogi be a madcap?

10:30.990 --> 10:35.550
That means he’s united with God, is He mad?

10:35.550 --> 10:39.520
All such mad people are really mad!

10:39.520 --> 10:42.250
They have nothing to do with God, definitely.

10:42.250 --> 10:47.170
But, there are people who believe in such
things – “Oh, he is in love with God,

10:47.170 --> 10:52.709
so he just jumps on the stage and goes into
ecstasy, dances like a madcap.”

10:52.709 --> 10:54.860
How can God be mad?

10:54.860 --> 10:58.860
First position is this, that the sanest personality
is God.

10:58.860 --> 11:00.480
Has to be.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.830
From where do the sanity comes in?

11:03.830 --> 11:13.010
So, this is one thing one has to understand,
that any such practices can lead you to lunacy,

11:13.010 --> 11:14.570
and one should not do it.

11:14.570 --> 11:22.580
Thirdly, the indiscretion that one has, comes
from people who are good hearted, nice people,

11:22.580 --> 11:30.610
but they get carried away by the smiles of
others or by the artificial goodness they

11:30.610 --> 11:32.300
show on their faces.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.890
I’ve known some people, they always have
a face, like this, as if they are all the

11:35.890 --> 11:36.890
time smiling.

11:36.890 --> 11:38.209
(Shri Mataji tries to demonstrate) I mean,
I can’t do that way.

11:38.209 --> 11:46.680
All the time, if you look at somebody like
this, you see, it means as if you are mocking

11:46.680 --> 11:48.550
at the person.

11:48.550 --> 11:56.330
And there are people I have seen who are just
like this every time (a small child laughs),

11:56.330 --> 11:58.269
and then like this!

11:58.269 --> 11:59.519
(Mother laughs).

11:59.519 --> 12:01.260
So, one should not be always in one pose.

12:01.260 --> 12:06.080
Sometimes these muscles can get very weak
and start paining if you take one [pose].

12:06.080 --> 12:10.170
There are some others who always try to show
that they are very miserable.

12:10.170 --> 12:17.800
I don’t know, what do they want to attract?

12:17.800 --> 12:20.690
Attract the attention of others?

12:20.690 --> 12:23.690
Attract the bhoots in themselves or, I don’t
know, what are they up to?

12:23.690 --> 12:26.339
Why can’t they keep a normal face?

12:26.339 --> 12:32.410
Even while sitting in dhyan , or meditation,
I have seen them, trying to show Me, or whatever

12:32.410 --> 12:36.150
it is, because My eyes are mostly closed,
but doesn’t matter.

12:36.150 --> 12:38.570
When I open My eyes, I find some people like
this, like that (looking at Her smiling).

12:38.570 --> 12:39.570
Why?

12:39.570 --> 12:40.570
What is the need?

12:40.570 --> 12:42.090
(laughter)

12:42.090 --> 12:45.339
You have to have a balanced face.

12:45.339 --> 12:49.240
That’s what Shri Krishna has described the
stitha pragnya (the witness state), the one

12:49.240 --> 12:51.750
who is balanced.

12:51.750 --> 12:56.149
Who doesn’t laugh like an idiot.

12:56.149 --> 12:58.390
Who laughs, but not like an idiot!

12:58.390 --> 13:02.980
Nor is a serious [type], like another kind
of an idiot!

13:02.980 --> 13:12.329
So, both the things are not at all expression
of your inner being.

13:12.329 --> 13:19.370
Such a person is, as I told you today, is
not frivolous, but not serious either.

13:19.370 --> 13:22.400
But full of joy within himself.

13:22.400 --> 13:30.050
He doesn’t want you to be unhappy, never
would like that you should be unhappy people.

13:30.050 --> 13:35.410
But human beings, if they want to be unhappy,
what can anybody help, because they have got

13:35.410 --> 13:36.410
the free will to be unhappy.

13:36.410 --> 13:41.490
They have got a free will to cut their nose,
they have a free will to cut their ears, they

13:41.490 --> 13:44.360
have free will to commit suicide.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.270
They have this free will, so-called.

13:47.270 --> 13:53.959
Now, the greatest free will comes from Vishuddhi
chakra, as I told you.

13:53.959 --> 13:57.250
And that’s why we call Him Yogeshwara.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.459
He is the Ishwara of Yoga.

13:59.459 --> 14:05.550
The establishment of yoga is possible when
you surrender yourself to Shri Krishna.

14:05.550 --> 14:13.100
[When you] completely surrender yourself to
Shri Krishna your yoga will be established.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.100
Means what?

14:14.100 --> 14:18.980
Means all your balances will be established.

14:18.980 --> 14:29.579
You go into complete balance, and that balance
is complete because Vishnu, Who is the incarnation

14:29.579 --> 14:37.579
for sustaining the dharma, Who is responsible
for giving you the balance, becomes complete

14:37.580 --> 14:39.500
in the form of Shri Krishna.

14:41.240 --> 14:47.500
That’s why is said that you leave all the
dharmas – “Sarva dharmanam parityaja,

14:47.500 --> 14:49.620
mamekam sharanam vraja”.

14:49.620 --> 14:51.840
That’s why “Surrender all of them to Me”.

14:51.840 --> 14:57.500
So all the dharmas, if you put it at the lotus
feet of Shri Krishna, means, if you follow

14:57.500 --> 15:03.680
His ideals, then all your dharmas are balanced.

15:03.680 --> 15:11.000
But, after realisation, you go beyond dharma.
