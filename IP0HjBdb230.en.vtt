00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:10.983
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Krishna Puja.

00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:22.733
We have to understand clearly that Shri Krishna

00:00:23.067 --> 00:00:28.192
is a very, very important deity within us

00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:33.108
because He is the Vishnu,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.317
who resides in the Void,

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:43.067
in the Nabhi.

00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:50.858
He is the one who generates Dharma within us.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:55.108
When you got your realization I didn’t tell you,

00:00:55.484 --> 00:00:57.733
“Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:03.150
I never told you that “This is not good. That is not good.”

00:01:03.608 --> 00:01:05.650
You just did it

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:12.359
because Shri Vishnu was awakened within you.

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:15.525
He is in the Void

00:01:15.983 --> 00:01:20.067
and if He is awakened

00:01:20.942 --> 00:01:28.192
He brings you to the light,

00:01:28.942 --> 00:01:32.108
removes your ignorance, removes your darkness,

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:36.608
and you start seeing that

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.983
whatever you were doing was destructive for you,

00:01:42.524 --> 00:01:47.192
and that’s how the dharma is established.

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:51.275
Of course, the Dharma was established also

00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:57.900
by all the ten Gurus who came on this earth,

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:02.566
the prophets, who taught us about dharma.

00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:16.733
So this combination of Shri Vishnu

00:02:17.108 --> 00:02:20.525
and the ten Gurus

00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:26.359
is to establish Dharma within us.

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:29.691
Now this Dharma is taught by prophets,

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.775
as you have seen everywhere.

00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:35.566
They have said, “Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:38.359
They have talked of Ten Commandments.

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:44.733
Every prophet has talked about Dharma, what is to be done,

00:02:45.484 --> 00:02:49.566
up to a point when Christ also had to talk about it

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:54.108
and He says, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

00:02:54.525 --> 00:03:02.816
But Shri Krishna is the one

00:03:03.234 --> 00:03:08.900
who says that “I come on this earth

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:19.359
when there is a glani, means demise, of Dharma.”

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.983
When the Dharma becomes weak

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.733
then He comes on this Earth,

00:03:26.234 --> 00:03:28.942
and then He destroys the people

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.566
who are responsible

00:03:35.317 --> 00:03:44.025
for bringing Dharma to this level of doom.

00:03:45.108 --> 00:03:48.025
The second thing He says, that

00:03:48.484 --> 00:03:53.650
“I protect the saints. I protect the saints

00:03:55.025 --> 00:04:02.858
and I kill all those who are devils or who are satanic,

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:04.858
who are destructive.”

00:04:05.234 --> 00:04:06.900
These are His promises

00:04:07.317 --> 00:04:11.775
which He gave long time back as Shri Krishna.

00:04:12.192 --> 00:04:16.983
As Vishnu we know Him only as the one

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.317
who is the giver of Dharma, mainly.

00:04:21.816 --> 00:04:25.525
But all His potent qualities really were expressed

00:04:25.942 --> 00:04:28.025
when He came as Shri Krishna.

00:04:28.484 --> 00:04:31.608
At the time of Shri Rama also these qualities

00:04:32.067 --> 00:04:34.983
could not be expressed in that way.

00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:40.275
So Shri Krishna’s first half of His life

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.025
He spent in Gokul and Vrindavan

00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:51.150
where He showed His beautiful expression of His character,

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.608
as He made it,

00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:59.275
what He calls as Leela, Leeladhara,

00:04:59.608 --> 00:05:04.484
the one who said that you become a witness;

00:05:06.108 --> 00:05:09.400
you witness the whole world like a drama,

00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:11.067
Sakshi Swarupa.

00:05:11.442 --> 00:05:18.108
And then once you see the whole world as just

00:05:18.608 --> 00:05:25.775
a child watches, in a child-like mirth and joy, you enjoy life.

00:05:26.192 --> 00:05:27.525
That has happened to you people

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.983
that you have become like citizens of Vrindavan and Gokul,

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:35.067
the way you are enjoying yourself,

00:05:35.442 --> 00:05:40.775
enjoying each other’s company, enjoying the bliss of God.

00:05:41.192 --> 00:05:44.067
Then He showed also by killing Kaliya,

00:05:44.442 --> 00:05:46.733
by killing Putana and other people,

00:05:47.192 --> 00:05:54.025
that if anybody tries to trouble such joyous children of God,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.275
He is the one who will definitely protect

00:06:00.608 --> 00:06:04.900
and kill all such evil forces which are troublesome.

00:06:05.442 --> 00:06:10.234
But later on He becomes the king,

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.775
and when He becomes the king

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.524
He uses His powers in a different way.

00:06:18.858 --> 00:06:22.942
First of all, if you see His own uncle, His own relation,

00:06:23.275 --> 00:06:26.775
His own uncle, mother’s brother, was Kansa,

00:06:27.234 --> 00:06:29.317
and was such a bad man.

00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:33.983
So Shri Krishna didn’t spare him, He killed him.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.608
He killed so many people.

00:06:37.067 --> 00:06:40.733
Before becoming the king, He killed so many people.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:48.484
Now what does that mean, that His own uncle He killed?

00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:56.525
One quality that He has, which Christ had, we can say,

00:06:56.983 --> 00:07:02.524
or so many saints had, is forgiveness.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.733
He did not believe in forgiveness.

00:07:07.234 --> 00:07:12.317
He’s the only one who said that, “I have to punish.”

00:07:12.775 --> 00:07:16.025
We have to have somebody who should punish also.

00:07:16.442 --> 00:07:18.150
If you are like Shiva,

00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:21.359
then Shiva used to even love rakshasas

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:26.400
and in His innocence He used to give them also blessings.

00:07:26.775 --> 00:07:33.400
But Shri Krishna did not believe in forgiveness at all

00:07:34.234 --> 00:07:38.317
because it was important that there should be

00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:40.858
somebody with a very stern mind,

00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:45.108
with such a stern understanding that a devil is a devil,

00:07:45.442 --> 00:07:48.942
and devil must be killed.

00:07:52.192 --> 00:07:54.900
He has done in His lifetime,

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:58.275
if you see, killing of so many people.

00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:01.108
That doesn’t mean that we have right to kill anybody.

00:08:01.442 --> 00:08:04.317
He was Shri Krishna; we are not.

00:08:04.858 --> 00:08:08.816
We have to forgive because we are human beings.

00:08:09.234 --> 00:08:12.858
Once we forgive we transfer all our anger,

00:08:13.275 --> 00:08:21.566
all our attitude of taking revenge, to Shri Krishna.

00:08:23.566 --> 00:08:25.192
He takes over.

00:08:25.524 --> 00:08:28.484
Once you say that “I forgive,” then He takes over,

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:31.775
because He does not forgive.

00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:37.025
He will immediately take over from you

00:08:37.525 --> 00:08:41.484
and if it is justifiable, if it is necessary

00:08:41.775 --> 00:08:47.525
He will punish the people who are torturing saints,

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.816
who are destroying the dharma.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.442
Now it is very surprising

00:08:54.733 --> 00:08:58.484
that whatever is preached by the person,

00:08:58.858 --> 00:09:03.234
that area becomes just the opposite of it.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.192
Is very surprising.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.525
Like we said that Christ said,

00:09:11.816 --> 00:09:13.983
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

00:09:14.359 --> 00:09:18.234
Christians are the worst as far as their eyes are concerned.

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:25.275
In the same way, in the Hindu religion it is said that

00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:29.525
everybody has the spirit.

00:09:29.942 --> 00:09:34.775
Still the Hindus believe in the different castes and communities

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:38.775
and fight with each other.

00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:45.400
Everything that was preached, just the opposite of it is followed.

00:09:45.816 --> 00:09:48.524
If you read even Koran, in the Koran,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.484
Mohammed Sahib has all the time

00:09:51.816 --> 00:09:54.442
said about rahmat, means compassion.

00:09:54.775 --> 00:09:56.525
But you don’t find it anywhere.

00:09:56.983 --> 00:09:58.566
He has not said about shariat,

00:09:58.942 --> 00:10:00.317
He has not said of many things

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:04.816
which are being practiced by Muslims, just on their own.

00:10:05.275 --> 00:10:07.608
He never said that women should cover their face

00:10:07.983 --> 00:10:10.192
or cover their heads,

00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:14.067
but it is practiced and not practiced but vengeance.

00:10:14.484 --> 00:10:19.983
So what it shows to us is this, that whatever is preached,

00:10:20.359 --> 00:10:24.691
just the opposite of that people try to do.

00:10:27.234 --> 00:10:32.067
And when such things happen, the dharma goes down.

00:10:32.525 --> 00:10:38.150
Now as you know that Krishna, His country is America.

00:10:38.608 --> 00:10:40.442
He rules over America.

00:10:40.858 --> 00:10:48.983
So it is a rich country because Shri Krishna is Kubera.

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:53.108
He is the Lord of wealth.

00:10:53.525 --> 00:10:57.234
So, He has given wealth to America.

00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:05.400
Then He is Vachana, means communication.

00:11:06.067 --> 00:11:11.691
His another quality is that He is the one who communicated.

00:11:12.108 --> 00:11:16.691
It was He who danced with gopis and gopas.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:24.108
It was He who transferred His powers to them.

00:11:24.566 --> 00:11:30.733
So the communication part is one of His greatest qualities

00:11:31.192 --> 00:11:33.484
that is working in America.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:39.067
So they are going just the opposite way

00:11:39.484 --> 00:11:42.275
that if there is a war, say, with Saddam Hussein,

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.608
so America is going.

00:11:44.983 --> 00:11:47.650
If there’s Korean War, America is going.

00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:52.691
Everywhere there is any problem, America has to go.

00:11:52.942 --> 00:11:54.275
I mean, one can ask question,

00:11:54.566 --> 00:11:56.275
“Who are you? Why, why are you bothered?

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.566
Keep to your own country enjoying yourself.

00:11:59.025 --> 00:12:00.775
Why are you sending troops all over?

00:12:01.108 --> 00:12:02.525
Why are you looking after everyone?”

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.484
Even the formation of UN and all that is done

00:12:05.816 --> 00:12:09.816
under the guidance of the Americans.

00:12:10.192 --> 00:12:12.484
They play a very important part

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:16.442
in the formation of this United Nations

00:12:16.858 --> 00:12:22.150
and one world and peace and all sorts of things.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:28.983
But actually, if you see, the main thing that Krishna had taught,

00:12:29.442 --> 00:12:31.858
they are missing.

00:12:32.234 --> 00:12:33.900
They are all right for communication.

00:12:34.192 --> 00:12:37.733
They are all right for establishing

00:12:38.067 --> 00:12:40.900
relationships between countries.

00:12:41.317 --> 00:12:45.484
But the worst thing they have done is that there is no dharma,

00:12:45.775 --> 00:12:49.484
no idea of dharma, no morality.

00:12:50.442 --> 00:12:54.067
Democracy without morality.

00:12:54.524 --> 00:13:00.025
To talk of morality in America is something out of the blue.

00:13:00.525 --> 00:13:05.025
They cannot understand anyone who talks of morality.

00:13:05.525 --> 00:13:09.733
Now, of course, the pangs of their doings

00:13:10.108 --> 00:13:13.150
is really torturing them.

00:13:13.608 --> 00:13:17.650
And also they are realizing, some of them,

00:13:17.983 --> 00:13:21.275
that because of immoral behavior

00:13:21.733 --> 00:13:26.317
they have come to a point where

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.983
sixty-five percent people of that country who are Americans

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:37.733
may suffer from some disease or may just die out

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:40.442
at a very young age.

00:13:40.775 --> 00:13:45.983
When it is coming

00:13:46.442 --> 00:13:53.317
as a starking

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.525
information is a shock.

00:14:00.942 --> 00:14:04.566
But despite that, despite all this,

00:14:04.942 --> 00:14:08.067
they are still going on with it and thinking that

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.317
“No, no, no, it’s all right. It’s not for us. What is there to worry?”

00:14:13.858 --> 00:14:17.942
Now His punishments have started,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.317
which they don’t realize how the punishment has started.

00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:27.275
Now supposing somebody is leading an immoral life

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:32.234
and as a result he develops some disease.

00:14:32.775 --> 00:14:37.275
Now this disease is not curable.

00:14:38.108 --> 00:14:41.192
They try everything to find out the ways and methods

00:14:41.525 --> 00:14:44.067
of curing these diseases which are coming

00:14:44.442 --> 00:14:48.025
out of immoral living. They cannot.

00:14:48.484 --> 00:14:54.608
It’s an impossible task for all the medical sciences of America

00:14:54.858 --> 00:14:58.983
to find out how to cure these particular diseases

00:14:59.275 --> 00:15:01.733
which are coming out of immorality.

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:05.067
But the worst part is that they cannot even say

00:15:05.484 --> 00:15:09.359
that immorality is wrong.

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:15.691
They cannot even openly admit that immoral behavior

00:15:16.108 --> 00:15:19.442
leads to these things.

00:15:19.983 --> 00:15:24.442
And this immorality is completely neglected

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.650
in a country of Shri Krishna where He was born,

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:34.983
always He says, just to establish morality.

00:15:36.275 --> 00:15:39.317
Artificial morality, that is there,

00:15:39.733 --> 00:15:43.234
like the Islamic talk about or the Christians talk about

00:15:43.691 --> 00:15:48.900
or Hindus talk about, is artificial, where they are hypocritical.

00:15:49.359 --> 00:15:51.691
They follow one code of conduct

00:15:52.108 --> 00:15:59.192
and another they have for themselves secretly adopted.

00:15:59.566 --> 00:16:03.275
But America is an open thing.

00:16:03.691 --> 00:16:07.025
Whatsoever they are doing they are not hiding it.

00:16:07.484 --> 00:16:09.608
They say, “We don’t believe in hypocrisy.”

00:16:10.108 --> 00:16:11.691
So they are not hiding it.

00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:16.025
And this has led this country, such a vast,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.983
beautiful, rich, prosperous country,

00:16:19.359 --> 00:16:22.900
into such a ditch that I do not know

00:16:23.317 --> 00:16:26.025
how it is going to recover unless and until

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.900
it takes to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:29.317 --> 00:16:35.566
Now another thing what dharma does to a normal person?

00:16:36.234 --> 00:16:39.275
A dharmic person is the one who is always

00:16:39.608 --> 00:16:42.025
introspective by nature.

00:16:42.484 --> 00:16:49.317
He tries to see, “Am I doing things all right? Is it correct?”

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:54.858
He doesn’t allow his mind to justify wrong things.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.400
That is one of the signs of a real dharmic person.

00:16:58.733 --> 00:17:00.359
He may not be a Sahaja yogi.

00:17:00.858 --> 00:17:06.858
But he will ask himself, “Is it right or is it wrong?”

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:12.608
But that capacity is completely gone in America.

00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:15.983
They never try to introspect themselves.

00:17:16.484 --> 00:17:20.524
On the contrary, they always say, “What’s wrong?”

00:17:20.983 --> 00:17:24.650
Those people who go on like this

00:17:25.067 --> 00:17:32.733
will definitely fall into a mess of things

00:17:33.108 --> 00:17:40.650
that will have no moral conductor, moral guidance.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:49.650
It is introspection which gives you a awakened conscience.

00:17:50.025 --> 00:17:53.524
It’s conscience which tells you, “This is wrong.”

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.025
They may be guided in one part.

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:59.067
For example, you see, they might say that

00:17:59.524 --> 00:18:03.650
“We are all right in administration,” maybe, or,

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:10.524
“We are all right for, say, our railways, our shipping,

00:18:10.942 --> 00:18:15.524
our other things, or maybe other economic banks

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.524
or whatever it is.”

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.858
But all these things are extremely superficial

00:18:21.275 --> 00:18:24.775
for human beings and they are outside.

00:18:25.275 --> 00:18:30.400
The inside is all managed by the conscience

00:18:30.775 --> 00:18:36.524
and also through moral inspection of yourself.

00:18:36.942 --> 00:18:39.566
People say, “Mother, what is this conscience is?”

00:18:40.025 --> 00:18:41.442
This conscience is there.

00:18:41.858 --> 00:18:47.192
It is there all the time, but a person who has to be

00:18:47.608 --> 00:18:51.400
conscious about it. “I have a conscience”.

00:18:51.942 --> 00:18:55.650
And this conscience has to answer.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.775
That conscience that is within us is,

00:19:00.192 --> 00:19:05.816
is the light of Shri Krishna within us even before realization.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.858
As you know, the ascent takes place, of Kundalini,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.484
through the Sushumna which is guided by Mahalakshmi.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.566
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.108
By listening to your conscience

00:19:24.733 --> 00:19:32.816
you develop a proper channel of Mahalakshmi within yourself.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.733
But the people who have no conscience,

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.359
in a particular line it’s not so; it is in every line, in every way.

00:19:40.733 --> 00:19:42.525
Otherwise, one chakra will be all right,

00:19:42.942 --> 00:19:45.317
another chakra will be in jeopardy.

00:19:45.733 --> 00:19:49.650
So the conscience has to be referred to,

00:19:50.192 --> 00:19:53.442
which is beyond rationality. It is not rationality.

00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:57.067
Something may look like rational to kill somebody

00:19:57.484 --> 00:19:59.025
or to snatch somebody’s money

00:19:59.484 --> 00:20:03.359
or to grab somebody’s land. May seem.

00:20:03.816 --> 00:20:08.192
But conscience will tell you that this is not right.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.025
At a time when people invaded so many countries

00:20:12.442 --> 00:20:15.900
and tried to overpower them,

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.858
it was America which was the only country,

00:20:19.234 --> 00:20:22.566
you must understand, never went out of their bounds

00:20:23.025 --> 00:20:25.524
to become empires.

00:20:25.983 --> 00:20:28.234
Very surprising, what kept them there.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.566
Because at that time when all this nonsense was going on

00:20:31.942 --> 00:20:37.067
all over the world, and that era when people

00:20:37.442 --> 00:20:39.359
didn’t mind subjecting other people,

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:43.816
taking away their lands and becoming this thing,

00:20:44.525 --> 00:20:47.400
America had stopped at that time.

00:20:47.816 --> 00:20:50.484
Before doing that, they had done once for all.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.108
They had occupied the area, they became the landlords,

00:20:54.442 --> 00:20:57.317
they became this. Of course they were foreigners.

00:20:57.733 --> 00:20:59.858
But after having done that,

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:03.691
the era when the people started expanding their empire,

00:21:04.192 --> 00:21:07.067
they did not do it.

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:11.275
Now what is the reason? Why they didn’t do it?

00:21:11.525 --> 00:21:12.650
We should ask a question:

00:21:13.025 --> 00:21:15.816
when others were expanding their empires,

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:20.150
why did not America do it?

00:21:20.733 --> 00:21:23.025
The reason is very simple.

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:26.900
At that time some great people with great conscience

00:21:27.317 --> 00:21:29.317
were born in that country

00:21:29.733 --> 00:21:33.192
and they guided that country.

00:21:33.608 --> 00:21:37.816
Like, you can say, Washington was there.

00:21:38.317 --> 00:21:43.691
Of course, there were so many people, whom if I name there,

00:21:44.067 --> 00:21:45.816
there will be a big list of those people.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:49.234
But if you see their character, their life, the way they lived.

00:21:49.566 --> 00:21:51.775
Abraham Lincoln, if you see his life,

00:21:52.234 --> 00:21:55.150
full of conscience, full of conscience.

00:21:55.608 --> 00:22:00.816
And they didn’t allow the nation to be drifted away

00:22:01.234 --> 00:22:04.234
to the ambition of gathering other countries

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.900
and making them their slaves and ...

00:22:07.317 --> 00:22:09.775
This they didn’t do.

00:22:10.275 --> 00:22:16.067
So in the first place when the,

00:22:16.484 --> 00:22:18.983
when, I should say, Columbus went there, conquered them,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.525
and tried to … actually, he didn’t do much.

00:22:24.983 --> 00:22:27.608
But Spanish and then others, and then Anglo-Saxons,

00:22:27.983 --> 00:22:30.691
all of them, when they conquered that country,

00:22:31.108 --> 00:22:33.816
once they settled down there,

00:22:34.359 --> 00:22:39.691
as if that era was over for them once for all,

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:43.484
and then they started talking about freedom,

00:22:43.942 --> 00:22:48.192
of democracy, of higher values.

00:22:48.733 --> 00:22:55.816
But the karmas of their past,

00:22:56.442 --> 00:23:01.608
the way they killed so many aboriginals,

00:23:02.108 --> 00:23:04.650
so many Red Indians,

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:09.192
will not be forgiven by Shri Krishna

00:23:09.691 --> 00:23:15.067
unless and until now they take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:16.608 --> 00:23:19.858
Despite that time when they did not try

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:23.691
to overpower other countries and to spread their empire

00:23:24.108 --> 00:23:29.900
and do all kinds of cruelties, like Hitler, they didn’t do that.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.566
And they always stood for something that is justice …

00:23:34.067 --> 00:23:35.775
tried to, I mean, at least.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.816
Then they became hypocritical also but on the whole,

00:23:40.192 --> 00:23:43.192
on the face of it, they tried to show

00:23:43.524 --> 00:23:46.524
that they are for uniting the whole world.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.608
They are against racialism, against fundamentalism, all these,

00:23:51.983 --> 00:23:57.359
I mean, just some sort of an idealism they propagated.

00:23:57.816 --> 00:24:04.150
But despite all that, all these ideas of self-destruction

00:24:04.524 --> 00:24:07.067
started working in them.

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:12.484
So I would say it is nothing but their karmas

00:24:12.816 --> 00:24:16.691
are working against them.

00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:23.442
And that’s how the violence is so much rampant there.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.566
So many diseases, so many things,

00:24:27.067 --> 00:24:32.359
it is very remarkable that all these troubles have started

00:24:32.858 --> 00:24:36.900
very, very recently in America,

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:43.108
because the exposure is coming up.

00:24:43.566 --> 00:24:46.524
To add up to that, we had lots of false gurus

00:24:46.858 --> 00:24:52.108
who went there and captured

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:55.942
innocent, simple people who were seeking the truth.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.566
We have lost so many of them in America.

00:24:58.942 --> 00:25:04.067
Also there, I would say, in the atmosphere where these

00:25:04.566 --> 00:25:07.484
curses of the people whom they had killed,

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.775
which reacted, and they took to something that was wrong.

00:25:13.192 --> 00:25:15.816
Why should they have taken to wrong things

00:25:16.192 --> 00:25:19.650
as far as their personal life is concerned?

00:25:20.108 --> 00:25:22.275
Freedom was given to them

00:25:22.733 --> 00:25:26.775
but they thought freedom is there also to ruin themselves

00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:30.525
or to make a mess out of their lives.

00:25:31.108 --> 00:25:34.858
This is a wrong idea which worked in them.

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:37.650
Then the whole idea became collective.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.733
When it became collective they found out that people

00:25:41.192 --> 00:25:43.900
like all those things that are destructive.

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:46.442
So, we have Hollywood there,

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.525
we have all such organizations and musicians

00:25:51.067 --> 00:25:58.025
and big, big, we can say, destructive forces

00:25:58.858 --> 00:26:06.150
which have formed groups and militant organizations

00:26:06.525 --> 00:26:13.775
which openly say that “We are that.”

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:20.983
For example, only in America we have satan’s,

00:26:21.442 --> 00:26:25.650
satan’s organization, devils’ organizations.

00:26:26.234 --> 00:26:30.442
Then there’s witchcraft. Openly.

00:26:30.942 --> 00:26:36.150
Openly, they are registered organizations in America,

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.108
when nowhere in the world you can have such a thing

00:26:39.442 --> 00:26:41.442
that this is a black magic organization,

00:26:41.816 --> 00:26:43.400
this is a witchcraft organization,

00:26:43.816 --> 00:26:46.983
openly they are registered there.

00:26:47.484 --> 00:26:50.691
So to such an extent they have gone;

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.608
and accepted collectively.

00:26:55.067 --> 00:26:59.733
The reason is the punishment.

00:27:00.484 --> 00:27:05.858
That’s why America is the most difficult place for us,

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:09.650
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:10.108 --> 00:27:12.733
One must have real sympathy for them.

00:27:13.234 --> 00:27:17.733
They are now passing through the phase of punishment,

00:27:18.317 --> 00:27:23.108
because their forefathers did all kinds of wrong things

00:27:23.525 --> 00:27:28.525
and they, too, never accepted Dharma as a principle of life.

00:27:29.317 --> 00:27:32.525
They thought that Dharma means killing your freedom;

00:27:32.983 --> 00:27:37.484
dharma means it takes away your personal, private life

00:27:37.858 --> 00:27:43.608
into the hands of something else.

00:27:44.067 --> 00:27:49.025
So to establish Dharma in America,

00:27:49.816 --> 00:27:51.525
what can we do?

00:27:51.983 --> 00:27:54.691
I’ve been to America at least ten times

00:27:55.108 --> 00:27:58.442
more than I’ve been to Russia

00:27:58.983 --> 00:28:06.108
and I want to really somehow or other bring to their notice that

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.650
"You have lost your Dharma."

00:28:09.025 --> 00:28:10.524
But this will never appeal to them

00:28:10.858 --> 00:28:12.192
because they are very egoistical.

00:28:12.566 --> 00:28:15.608
If you tell them like that, then they’ll be very angry.

00:28:16.067 --> 00:28:18.484
On the contrary, those who tell them, like Rajneesh

00:28:18.816 --> 00:28:22.317
and all these people, “Oh, this, no dharma,” their weaknesses,

00:28:22.733 --> 00:28:26.025
their egos are pampered. Then they are very happy.

00:28:26.484 --> 00:28:29.025
So it’s a difficult task in that country

00:28:29.442 --> 00:28:33.608
to make people understand that you are under punishment,

00:28:34.067 --> 00:28:36.775
that this punishment you can only overcome

00:28:37.192 --> 00:28:39.442
if you become Sahaja yogis.

00:28:39.816 --> 00:28:43.484
With Sahaja Yoga their dharma will be awakened

00:28:43.942 --> 00:28:49.359
and all their punishments and all their curses will be over.

00:28:49.775 --> 00:28:52.359
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga much more

00:28:52.733 --> 00:28:54.566
than any other country.

00:28:55.025 --> 00:28:58.525
My concern for America is for the same reason.

00:28:59.108 --> 00:29:01.525
I’m not saying so much about South America

00:29:02.067 --> 00:29:04.400
but more about the North America.

00:29:04.816 --> 00:29:07.900
But even in South America, what I found is

00:29:08.442 --> 00:29:16.484
that it is a kind of a nation

00:29:17.108 --> 00:29:24.524
where they have no guidance at all about Dharma, no guidance.

00:29:25.317 --> 00:29:28.234
Openly they are doing carnival, this, that.

00:29:28.691 --> 00:29:33.858
I mean, how can you do it in a country, all those things?

00:29:34.275 --> 00:29:37.816
They are following the footsteps of North America.

00:29:38.275 --> 00:29:41.150
Like in North America they have that Halloween nonsense.

00:29:41.524 --> 00:29:42.983
I mean, imagine openly on the street

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.275
doing Halloween nonsense.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.192
So they are following carnival.

00:29:47.608 --> 00:29:50.566
To them, “Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

00:29:50.942 --> 00:29:54.566
as if there is a very big achievement and going into that carnival

00:29:54.942 --> 00:29:56.067
from all over the places.

00:29:56.524 --> 00:30:00.733
From Australia people are coming down.

00:30:02.025 --> 00:30:07.317
All this is working against them very much.

00:30:07.691 --> 00:30:11.025
Their situation is so bad in so many ways

00:30:11.525 --> 00:30:18.150
that it is not easy to explain why they are going to that limit.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:24.775
Like thirteen-year-old girls are made into prostitutes in Brazil.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.608
Openly.

00:30:29.484 --> 00:30:33.525
All their trees are cut in Amazon. Openly.

00:30:34.067 --> 00:30:37.025
Whole smuggling is done, openly.

00:30:37.484 --> 00:30:39.900
Their politicians are corrupt.

00:30:40.275 --> 00:30:43.733
There, I mean, so much of black magic there,

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.067
so much of black magic. Openly that.

00:30:47.524 --> 00:30:53.525
They are just following the footsteps of North America.

00:30:54.025 --> 00:30:58.983
The Dharma is like this Catholic Church is there.

00:30:59.484 --> 00:31:02.942
What is it going to teach them Dharma, this Catholic Church?

00:31:03.442 --> 00:31:06.524
So they go to church, they do everything

00:31:06.942 --> 00:31:12.942
and they come back home with same ideas that they have.

00:31:13.524 --> 00:31:17.524
There are countries and countries which are so very poor.

00:31:18.025 --> 00:31:23.150
So that shows that Kubera’s attention is not on that country.

00:31:23.691 --> 00:31:27.192
Normally, poor people are dharmic, normally.

00:31:27.816 --> 00:31:29.983
Because you see, money gives them these ideas

00:31:30.442 --> 00:31:33.317
to do all nonsensical things and ego.

00:31:33.775 --> 00:31:38.900
Normally, the poor people are dharmic but there it is different.

00:31:39.317 --> 00:31:42.359
They indulge into black magic too much.

00:31:42.733 --> 00:31:45.524
They were telling Me that it is the black magic

00:31:45.816 --> 00:31:48.359
which came from Africa and they have accepted.

00:31:48.775 --> 00:31:52.400
But so much it is developed in South America

00:31:52.816 --> 00:31:55.942
that it is impossible to understand that

00:31:56.525 --> 00:31:59.150
how they have accepted this nonsense

00:31:59.608 --> 00:32:02.942
so easily to curse themselves.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.150
Now, we have to understand that these problems

00:32:06.484 --> 00:32:11.816
also exist within ourselves, on our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:32:12.608 --> 00:32:18.525
If we have to keep our Vishuddhi Chakra all right,

00:32:19.192 --> 00:32:24.317
we have two sides as you know, is the left and the right.

00:32:24.983 --> 00:32:32.524
So the right side is the Vishuddhi Chakra which is speaking,

00:32:32.983 --> 00:32:36.108
which is talking about Dharma,

00:32:36.524 --> 00:32:41.858
which is on the aggressive side, we can say.

00:32:42.733 --> 00:32:46.234
Now those people who are aggressive,

00:32:46.733 --> 00:32:48.525
who talk in an aggressive manner,

00:32:48.942 --> 00:32:54.816
who are, say, trying to dominate others by their talks,

00:32:55.525 --> 00:32:59.400
are the people who are right-sided.

00:32:59.816 --> 00:33:04.400
I’ve seen people, those who really do wrong things.

00:33:04.775 --> 00:33:08.942
Say, a person, a servant steals something.

00:33:09.524 --> 00:33:13.524
You call him, he’ll be so rude to you that you’ll be amazed.

00:33:13.858 --> 00:33:15.234
This man is so rude.

00:33:15.608 --> 00:33:20.525
How can he, how can have been able to steal something?

00:33:20.983 --> 00:33:25.067
He’s not afraid; he’s answering you back so nicely.

00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:27.775
So those people who are right-sided

00:33:28.192 --> 00:33:30.733
can cover up any sin that they have committed,

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.400
any wrong they have done,

00:33:32.775 --> 00:33:36.150
any murder they have done, by their talk.

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:41.484
It could be a talk which is very aggressive, blatant.

00:33:41.858 --> 00:33:46.025
People might think, “Oh, how can that be?

00:33:46.442 --> 00:33:49.608
This man is telling so loudly everything,”

00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:53.067
and you just, you are stunned and you think,

00:33:53.442 --> 00:33:56.484
“No, it’s not possible. How can a person who says this thing ?”

00:33:56.858 --> 00:34:01.108
In this way we, too, as ordinary human beings,

00:34:01.525 --> 00:34:06.067
indulge into all kinds of nonsensical things

00:34:06.525 --> 00:34:10.442
and then we try to justify it by talking,

00:34:11.317 --> 00:34:13.192
wriggling out of it.

00:34:13.525 --> 00:34:20.067
You know as many criminals, war criminals,

00:34:20.524 --> 00:34:24.067
have come out of it by just talking,

00:34:24.608 --> 00:34:27.900
by creating stories, by showing something like that.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.359
That also is with all human beings,

00:34:31.775 --> 00:34:34.816
they have this capacity to say something

00:34:35.234 --> 00:34:39.484
by which to hide whatever wrong you are doing.

00:34:39.858 --> 00:34:42.108
But it is never realized by them

00:34:42.566 --> 00:34:47.234
that whatever harm you have done is not going to be forgiven

00:34:48.484 --> 00:34:51.983
and will be less forgiven when you talk like this,

00:34:52.524 --> 00:34:55.400
because Shri Krishna is finished.

00:34:55.942 --> 00:35:01.317
If you start justifying, rationalizing all your wrong things,

00:35:01.942 --> 00:35:06.858
then you will be punished and you will be punished very badly

00:35:07.317 --> 00:35:11.942
in so many ways that you will not know how to get it out of it.

00:35:12.442 --> 00:35:16.983
Physically, mentally, emotionally, every way you’ll be.

00:35:17.566 --> 00:35:24.858
So our Right Vishuddhi we have to have a temperament,

00:35:25.317 --> 00:35:29.775
a culture, a style, a behavior

00:35:30.234 --> 00:35:33.025
which has got the quality of Shri Krishna,

00:35:33.442 --> 00:35:38.608
which is called as madhurya, means melodious, melodious.

00:35:39.025 --> 00:35:43.566
We should talk in such a manner that it should be melodious.

00:35:44.067 --> 00:35:47.108
The person who listens to you,

00:35:47.566 --> 00:35:55.150
listens as if he’s listening to the flute of Shri Krishna.

00:35:55.608 --> 00:35:59.900
The voice of a Sahaja yogi should be sweet like that.

00:36:00.359 --> 00:36:05.691
When you talk to someone it should be melodious.

00:36:06.275 --> 00:36:08.234
It should not be aggressive, at all,

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:11.608
but on the contrary it should be melodious.

00:36:12.108 --> 00:36:15.983
It should not be sarcastic; it should not hurt another person.

00:36:16.484 --> 00:36:21.067
Any word that hurts others cannot be coming

00:36:21.442 --> 00:36:24.025
from the proper type of Right Vishuddhi.

00:36:24.442 --> 00:36:28.192
So in no way one should hurt.

00:36:28.733 --> 00:36:33.400
I wish all the Sahaja yogis develop that melodious voice

00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:37.359
of Shri Krishna as their Vishuddhi is awakened.

00:36:37.691 --> 00:36:43.942
Madhurya, in his behavior, madhurya is – you see,

00:36:44.317 --> 00:36:48.942
while talking to someone there are so many gestures by which

00:36:49.359 --> 00:36:53.150
you can express your madhurya.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:58.775
For example, specially in Italy and other places,

00:36:59.192 --> 00:37:00.983
I’ve seen people use too much of their hands.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.067
This is also Shri Krishna’s style.

00:37:03.524 --> 00:37:05.275
So they use their hands in such a way

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:09.359
that sometimes you don’t understand what they are meaning.

00:37:09.775 --> 00:37:12.025
And sometimes it can be quite aggressive also,

00:37:12.442 --> 00:37:14.025
the way they use their hands.

00:37:14.442 --> 00:37:17.359
Now, the hands must be used in such a way

00:37:17.775 --> 00:37:20.775
that it should create madhurya.

00:37:21.234 --> 00:37:26.359
I’ve seen this in Russia or specially in Eastern blocs

00:37:26.733 --> 00:37:30.150
where people, they have to express their love

00:37:30.525 --> 00:37:35.275
– [just put like this, it’s cold] – if they have to say namaste.

00:37:35.691 --> 00:37:38.234
The whole expression is so sweet,

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:44.900
and also their heart is very full when they see Me.

00:37:45.317 --> 00:37:47.359
So they don’t know how to express it.

00:37:47.733 --> 00:37:52.067
So they just put their hands like this.

00:37:52.524 --> 00:37:54.691
Or they feel shy, they do like this.

00:37:55.234 --> 00:37:59.317
Very, very sweet things they express through their hands,

00:37:59.608 --> 00:38:05.108
through their eyes. It is the tears, you see,

00:38:05.524 --> 00:38:13.150
that really create such clouds of, I should say,

00:38:13.484 --> 00:38:16.192
very dense clouds of compassion in My heart

00:38:16.608 --> 00:38:21.150
when I see their eyes expressing their love for Me.

00:38:21.608 --> 00:38:26.858
Everything, the tears, everything, that’s the face,

00:38:27.275 --> 00:38:32.442
the eyes, the hands, all these belong to Shri Krishna.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.067
So in their behavior, in their talking,

00:38:36.525 --> 00:38:40.192
how they express themselves.

00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:42.400
You can use the same eyes

00:38:42.816 --> 00:38:44.858
for showing your temper and getting angry.

00:38:45.317 --> 00:38:48.108
Many people use eyes for controlling others.

00:38:48.524 --> 00:38:51.983
They’ll put their eyes like this, stare at someone, try to control.

00:38:52.484 --> 00:38:58.691
They may use their eyes also for condemning someone.

00:38:59.192 --> 00:39:03.524
Also sometimes they use, sort of spit at someone

00:39:04.025 --> 00:39:10.150
or try to show the tongue to insult someone.

00:39:10.608 --> 00:39:17.442
So in the behavior also we must have a kind of a sweetness.

00:39:17.858 --> 00:39:21.025
Like when I went to, went to England first,

00:39:21.524 --> 00:39:24.359
I was, you see, I learnt English in My own way.

00:39:24.733 --> 00:39:26.816
But when I went there newly they said,

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.234
“Now, if you have to say word like ‘thought’

00:39:29.525 --> 00:39:32.234
you must say ‘thought’.” I said, “What?”

00:39:32.608 --> 00:39:35.942
“You must take out your tongue and say ‘thought’”.

00:39:36.317 --> 00:39:39.775
I said, “Is absurd. Why should you take out your tongue?”

00:39:40.192 --> 00:39:43.317
He said, “Unless and until you take out your tongue like that

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:48.108
is not something, proper expression.”

00:39:48.525 --> 00:39:50.525
So I said, “This is English. You have developed

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.983
some nonsensical things, to show tongue at it, everyone.”

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.317
Even a child, you know, when he gets angry

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:57.983
automatically he shows his tongue.

00:39:58.359 --> 00:40:04.442
So you see all these expressions are – and making faces now,

00:40:04.816 --> 00:40:07.983
as they say that ‘stiff upper lip,’ you see.

00:40:08.317 --> 00:40:11.525
You must have heard about that, with a nose like that, you see,

00:40:11.858 --> 00:40:14.983
snooty nose or a face where you just make your faces

00:40:15.442 --> 00:40:21.608
and make a crooked face just to tease someone

00:40:22.067 --> 00:40:26.733
or to make an expression out of your nose.

00:40:27.108 --> 00:40:28.525
Also people do it like this, you see,

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.816
to show as if you are sneezing at that person.

00:40:32.317 --> 00:40:34.858
All these things, expressions, are coming

00:40:35.359 --> 00:40:41.983
out of Shri Krishna’s grace, but the power of that is madhurya,

00:40:42.524 --> 00:40:45.775
is the sweetness, the melodiousness;

00:40:46.275 --> 00:40:52.234
the rapport should be so sweet that that rapport should create

00:40:52.691 --> 00:40:55.858
tremendous joy and tremendous happiness.

00:40:56.275 --> 00:41:00.691
As you have heard the song of Baba Mama’s on My eyes:

00:41:01.108 --> 00:41:05.192
only I looked at him, I say with that glance

00:41:05.525 --> 00:41:08.650
– that generated that beautiful music in him.

00:41:09.108 --> 00:41:13.067
So, as far as possible, as far as possible,

00:41:13.484 --> 00:41:16.983
try to put your eyes on the greenery; that’s the best.

00:41:17.484 --> 00:41:21.900
Then it soothes down and also you develop

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:25.067
the soothing quality of the greenery.

00:41:25.524 --> 00:41:28.150
I always tell people that “Better see the greenery around,

00:41:28.566 --> 00:41:29.816
how it soothes your eyes.”

00:41:30.317 --> 00:41:33.816
In the same way you should try to soothe

00:41:34.608 --> 00:41:37.067
the other person when you talk to that person.

00:41:37.442 --> 00:41:39.025
The person must melt.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.317
Instead of that, if you start arguing and fighting with that person,

00:41:43.733 --> 00:41:44.900
that person will never melt.

00:41:45.234 --> 00:41:49.359
On the contrary, you’ll be adding fire, more fire to that person.

00:41:49.858 --> 00:41:53.691
That was the quality of Shri Krishna, is the madhurya,

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:58.942
and that it is expressed in His lifetime

00:41:59.359 --> 00:42:03.400
how He beautifully managed to say things

00:42:03.775 --> 00:42:10.025
in His own sweetness, specially in His childhood.

00:42:10.816 --> 00:42:14.359
The another quality which Shri Krishna has, which

00:42:14.691 --> 00:42:20.858
we can express through our Right Vishuddhi, is diplomacy.

00:42:21.192 --> 00:42:23.192
But there are two types of diplomacies:

00:42:23.566 --> 00:42:26.067
one is genuine; one who is artificial.

00:42:26.524 --> 00:42:31.192
In the genuine diplomacy you do not have to take to

00:42:31.566 --> 00:42:35.566
a certain standard or you don’t have to read some books

00:42:36.067 --> 00:42:39.275
to know what is diplomacy.

00:42:39.691 --> 00:42:42.858
Is a genuinely it comes to you.

00:42:43.275 --> 00:42:46.525
It, the whole thing works very sweetly,

00:42:46.983 --> 00:42:49.983
in such a genuine manner.

00:42:50.442 --> 00:42:53.192
I, I have used it many-a-times Myself,

00:42:53.566 --> 00:42:56.025
and you all can use it also many-a-times.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.442
That’s only possible if you don’t get angry with them;

00:42:59.858 --> 00:43:02.566
not possible if you are angry.

00:43:03.067 --> 00:43:07.025
Now, there’s a story I’ve told you about some,

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:08.816
this Gagangiri Maharaj.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.234
I went to meet him and he was very angry

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:14.359
because he could not stop the rain.

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:16.150
He was supposed to stop the rain.

00:43:16.524 --> 00:43:18.108
And I was all drenched.

00:43:18.484 --> 00:43:20.192
And he was so angry and he said that

00:43:20.524 --> 00:43:22.775
“Is it my ego You are trying to control?”

00:43:23.108 --> 00:43:25.691
and like that he started little bit fighting with Me.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.983
I said, “No, that’s not the reason.”

00:43:28.484 --> 00:43:31.691
He said, “Why? Why did You not allow me to stop the rain?

00:43:32.025 --> 00:43:32.858
You are all drenched.”

00:43:33.192 --> 00:43:35.733
I said, “Because you are a sanyasi

00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:37.359
and you bought a sari for Me.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:39.524
I would not take a sari from a sanyasi.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.983
So I had to get drenched, for your sake.”

00:43:42.484 --> 00:43:46.942
The whole thing finished off.

00:43:47.525 --> 00:43:50.733
The whole anger, temper, finished off.

00:43:51.275 --> 00:43:54.067
This is how we have to melt people.

00:43:54.525 --> 00:43:59.733
The diplomacy is not convincing anybody

00:44:00.108 --> 00:44:03.900
with his intellect or by temper or anything

00:44:04.317 --> 00:44:10.234
but it is to melt away another person by your goodness,

00:44:10.733 --> 00:44:13.067
by your good words, by your sweet words,

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:15.317
by your forgiving nature.

00:44:15.733 --> 00:44:20.400
This quality He had and He tried this on many people.

00:44:20.775 --> 00:44:23.524
It worked on some; it did not work on some.

00:44:23.983 --> 00:44:25.525
He didn’t feel it’s a failure.

00:44:26.025 --> 00:44:28.025
It’s the reaction of the another person

00:44:28.442 --> 00:44:30.525
which is important to be seen.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.442
So this quality of Right Vishuddhi you should have,

00:44:34.816 --> 00:44:39.608
is to talk to others and melt them away.

00:44:39.942 --> 00:44:44.067
I hope in America people develop this quality

00:44:44.525 --> 00:44:48.400
and try to improve relations with each other.

00:44:48.733 --> 00:44:51.733
Actually, to talk to they are very sweet, I must say.

00:44:52.192 --> 00:44:53.775
They get very friendly with you.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:55.775
You give them any number of presents,

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:58.816
they’ll be very happy but they’ll never give you any present.

00:44:59.234 --> 00:45:01.192
You call them for dinner, anything,

00:45:01.608 --> 00:45:04.359
they’ll ten times they will come to your house for dinner

00:45:04.775 --> 00:45:06.691
but they will never call you for dinner.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.566
You see, they are very friendly as long

00:45:09.942 --> 00:45:11.484
as you are doing anything for them.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.442
But when it comes to returning it they find it difficult;

00:45:15.858 --> 00:45:19.442
they don’t do it. So, you see the whole thing amounts

00:45:19.733 --> 00:45:23.067
to be a very sweet exploitation of another person.

00:45:23.566 --> 00:45:26.484
This is what is to be understood that by sweetness

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.275
you are not going to exploit anyone but by sweetness

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:34.525
you are going to melt that person and bring him to the level

00:45:34.942 --> 00:45:40.359
that he can understand what is goodness.

00:45:41.025 --> 00:45:43.816
Now, about South America, I’ve already told you

00:45:44.317 --> 00:45:48.900
that they are extremely simple and innocent people.

00:45:49.317 --> 00:45:52.192
They are very poor, simple, innocent,

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:55.650
but what has entered them into is this black magic,

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:59.942
and which they are now realizing, luckily,

00:46:00.359 --> 00:46:03.150
that this is black magic which is troubling them.

00:46:03.608 --> 00:46:06.067
But somehow they have depended on it so much,

00:46:06.484 --> 00:46:07.566
on the left side.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.192
They feel very guilty about it; they feel very bad.

00:46:10.524 --> 00:46:12.900
All the time you find them absolutely guilty.

00:46:13.359 --> 00:46:14.858
Their whole behavior is that

00:46:15.317 --> 00:46:17.400
as if they have done something wrong

00:46:17.816 --> 00:46:20.691
but they do not know how to correct themselves.

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:25.733
So for us is important not to feel guilty about anything.

00:46:26.192 --> 00:46:28.775
We are all Sahaja yogis.

00:46:29.192 --> 00:46:31.858
How can we have guilt after all, when we are the spirit?

00:46:32.234 --> 00:46:33.983
Spirit cannot have the guilt.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.234
So this guilt has to go away.

00:46:36.608 --> 00:46:41.733
But by guilt what do we do, what we lose is the witness power,

00:46:42.192 --> 00:46:45.275
because when there is a guilt we put it here, the guilt is there.

00:46:45.691 --> 00:46:48.192
But we cannot see.

00:46:48.566 --> 00:46:51.900
We cannot witness what’s wrong

00:46:52.359 --> 00:46:54.317
and we do not want to face the difficulty,

00:46:54.608 --> 00:46:58.524
our mistakes or the difficulty we have.

00:46:58.942 --> 00:47:01.025
Just put it as a guilt here, finished.

00:47:01.359 --> 00:47:03.359
Is stored up there nicely, guilt.

00:47:03.775 --> 00:47:05.442
But we do not want to face it.

00:47:05.816 --> 00:47:09.942
For example a man, say, or a woman is very cruel by nature.

00:47:10.317 --> 00:47:13.858
Then suddenly she realizes that she has been cruel

00:47:14.275 --> 00:47:16.234
or whatever it is. So she puts it down there,

00:47:16.566 --> 00:47:18.442
“Oh, I’ve been very bad. I’ve been very cruel,

00:47:18.775 --> 00:47:22.608
this thing, that thing.” But she doesn’t face it.

00:47:22.983 --> 00:47:25.400
Facing means she should know, “Why was I cruel?

00:47:25.691 --> 00:47:27.858
What was the need for me? I should not have been cruel

00:47:28.275 --> 00:47:31.691
and now I will not be cruel anymore.” That finishes off.

00:47:32.108 --> 00:47:35.650
But, “I’m very guilty about it. I’m very guilty about it,”

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:38.108
doesn’t help. On the contrary, you know,

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.025
what are the problems are of the guilt,

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.733
and the same problems are today faced by South America.

00:47:45.275 --> 00:47:48.108
When I went there I was surprised that in Brazil

00:47:48.525 --> 00:47:53.900
the man who was the topmost there talked to Me in a manner,

00:47:54.317 --> 00:47:56.733
“Oh, we are, we know we have lots of defects.

00:47:57.192 --> 00:47:59.234
We know we are no good,” this, that.

00:47:59.691 --> 00:48:02.858
What I just say, why doesn’t he correct?

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:08.442
If he knows this is the mistake, this is the thing,

00:48:08.816 --> 00:48:10.983
why shouldn’t he correct? Then he told Me that

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.900
“You write to me all the things You found wrong with us.”

00:48:14.359 --> 00:48:16.108
And it was really very sweet of him.

00:48:16.566 --> 00:48:20.150
So then one journalist came and we told him.

00:48:20.484 --> 00:48:22.608
And now I think they are doing something about it.

00:48:22.942 --> 00:48:25.525
They are trying to improve it and things will improve definitely.

00:48:26.025 --> 00:48:30.525
But on the contrary I found that Russia is very different.

00:48:30.858 --> 00:48:34.108
In Russia they never said, “We are guilty,” or anything,

00:48:34.524 --> 00:48:37.067
nothing of the kind. They never said so.

00:48:37.524 --> 00:48:39.359
They said, “That time is over now.

00:48:39.691 --> 00:48:42.942
We are in the kingdom of God. Finished.

00:48:43.317 --> 00:48:47.317
So that is over. We are now in the Kingdom of God

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:51.359
and we have to enjoy life.” Everything positive.

00:48:51.691 --> 00:48:53.942
Never talked of their past, of their governments

00:48:54.317 --> 00:48:58.858
or this happened, or Stalin or Lenin or anyone.

00:48:59.317 --> 00:49:02.400
They were not concerned. They were above it.

00:49:02.816 --> 00:49:05.108
“So why should we worry?” They said, “Why should we worry?

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:06.942
Let them fight. Let them do what they like.”

00:49:07.359 --> 00:49:09.983
They don’t want to know anything about their politics,

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.317
about their problems or anything.

00:49:13.733 --> 00:49:15.525
They think, “Our problems are solved.

00:49:15.942 --> 00:49:17.691
We are now realized souls.

00:49:18.108 --> 00:49:20.900
We are enjoying ourselves. Let us enjoy.”

00:49:21.317 --> 00:49:24.525
Very straight-forward way of understanding Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:25.025 --> 00:49:26.983
But I’ve seen people, they write to Me

00:49:27.359 --> 00:49:29.775
ten pages of their confessions as if I am a priest,

00:49:30.192 --> 00:49:33.525
Catholic priest, you see, all about their, what they have done,

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.983
this they have done, and I don’t want to read it.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.108
Just throw it or I burn it off.

00:49:39.566 --> 00:49:42.067
So they try to confess. There’s no need to confess.

00:49:42.525 --> 00:49:46.234
There’s nothing to say. And not to dwell upon

00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:49.775
what wrongs you have done, but now enjoy what you have got it.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:53.733
It’s like this: supposing a beggar is made a king, all right?

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:57.524
Then he should enjoy his kingdom, should behave like a king.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.858
But still he remembers his past more,

00:50:00.275 --> 00:50:01.816
so anybody who passes by he says,

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:06.150
“Give me five rupees or five pounds.” It’s like that.

00:50:06.525 --> 00:50:08.524
Once you are in the Kingdom of God,

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:10.983
know that you are in the Kingdom of God.

00:50:11.442 --> 00:50:16.275
But this black magic business is very, very dangerous

00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:18.359
and it can act through anyone.

00:50:18.691 --> 00:50:21.691
It can act through your relations, act through your friends,

00:50:22.067 --> 00:50:23.400
act through anyone.

00:50:23.691 --> 00:50:26.983
So one has to be very careful that you do not become,

00:50:27.359 --> 00:50:30.234
because of your guilt business or whatever it is,

00:50:30.691 --> 00:50:34.317
you become vulnerable to black magic.

00:50:34.775 --> 00:50:37.400
It can ruin you. It can ruin your families.

00:50:37.816 --> 00:50:40.733
Even if you are a Sahaja yogi it can ruin you.

00:50:41.275 --> 00:50:44.816
So this guilt business has to be given up completely.

00:50:45.234 --> 00:50:47.733
You should not be guilty. Guilt is put into you.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:49.816
Somebody can say, “Oh you are so bad.

00:50:50.234 --> 00:50:53.108
You didn’t do this for me. You didn’t do that,”

00:50:53.442 --> 00:50:55.359
or something like that. They put ideas.

00:50:55.733 --> 00:50:58.025
Then you start feeling, “Oh, I should have done this for them.

00:50:58.317 --> 00:51:01.275
I should have. It was wrong on my part,” or something,

00:51:01.566 --> 00:51:02.525
and then the guilt starts.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.691
Instead of doing something for that person

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.983
or instead of understanding that this all nonsense,

00:51:08.442 --> 00:51:11.524
they go on brooding on that, brooding and then suddenly

00:51:11.858 --> 00:51:17.775
they find they are in the trouble of getting possessed

00:51:18.192 --> 00:51:20.942
or being affected by black magic.

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:25.108
So one has to forget it and get into the atmosphere

00:51:25.524 --> 00:51:30.525
where you know that you are now in the kingdom of God.

00:51:31.067 --> 00:51:34.608
For Shri Krishna, whatever is to be said is less than

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:37.108
what He’s said always, I always feel,

00:51:37.525 --> 00:51:44.525
and that His main work is through our brain.

00:51:45.025 --> 00:51:49.067
That is Virata. He works through our brain.

00:51:49.566 --> 00:51:51.816
And as Shiva works through our heart,

00:51:52.192 --> 00:51:54.025
He works through our brain.

00:51:54.524 --> 00:52:00.108
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment,

00:52:00.524 --> 00:52:04.108
all the subtleties of the brain and the knowledge

00:52:04.608 --> 00:52:08.234
starts manifesting and expressing itself.

00:52:08.608 --> 00:52:10.484
But the greatest thing that happens,

00:52:10.816 --> 00:52:12.691
that integration takes place in your brain.

00:52:13.108 --> 00:52:14.983
It’s not that your heart wants one thing

00:52:15.442 --> 00:52:17.317
and your brain wants another thing.

00:52:17.733 --> 00:52:19.150
The integration takes place.

00:52:19.484 --> 00:52:21.067
And when that integration takes place

00:52:21.484 --> 00:52:24.733
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

00:52:25.192 --> 00:52:29.524
Even without thinking about it, without reading about it,

00:52:29.858 --> 00:52:31.816
you just become dharmic.

00:52:32.192 --> 00:52:34.150
You are not to be told that you have to be dharmic.

00:52:34.525 --> 00:52:37.733
Innately you become dharmic because your brain,

00:52:38.192 --> 00:52:42.359
which normally is used for rationality,

00:52:42.816 --> 00:52:44.691
for justifying all that is wrong,

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:49.442
becomes dharmic, becomes divine.

00:52:49.816 --> 00:52:53.317
This is the greatest thing that Shri Krishna does to you

00:52:53.733 --> 00:52:58.608
is to make your brain, brain itself dharmic.

00:52:59.067 --> 00:53:08.150
It becomes a vehicle of understanding Dharma,

00:53:08.983 --> 00:53:18.359
of leading a dharmic life and of standing firmly on Dharma.

00:53:18.816 --> 00:53:25.400
It’s the brain; it is the brain which really,

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:31.900
mostly, takes you away from Dharma, apart from black magic.

00:53:32.484 --> 00:53:37.192
But once your Sahasrara is opened out,

00:53:37.691 --> 00:53:43.192
Virata is expressed.

00:53:43.608 --> 00:53:45.775
Then you are amazed at yourself.

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:48.525
The one who was indulging into everything thinking,

00:53:48.858 --> 00:53:51.525
“This is pleasure. This is my right. I should have done it.

00:53:51.983 --> 00:53:53.608
Who else can tell me?” and all that,

00:53:53.942 --> 00:53:56.900
suddenly you become a prophet.

00:53:57.317 --> 00:54:00.484
This is the greatest blessing of Shri Krishna

00:54:00.816 --> 00:54:06.025
that He is Virat, and the Virat is your brain,

00:54:06.524 --> 00:54:10.608
and the brain of God Almighty is Virat.

00:54:11.067 --> 00:54:13.650
So this is what one has to realize,

00:54:14.025 --> 00:54:17.524
that after realization a person gets ideas

00:54:17.858 --> 00:54:21.484
which are always constructive, and if they are not,

00:54:21.733 --> 00:54:23.484
then you are not yet a Sahaja yogi.

00:54:23.942 --> 00:54:28.234
Constructive and dharmic, that is very, very important

00:54:28.608 --> 00:54:33.484
for us to understand, where is our mind going?

00:54:33.942 --> 00:54:40.775
Is it contradicting, it is telling something else than what it is?

00:54:41.442 --> 00:54:45.942
We have to just keep a watch and you’ll be amazed to see

00:54:46.317 --> 00:54:50.317
how your brain has changed its ways.

00:54:50.816 --> 00:54:54.400
The upside brain has become normal.

00:54:54.816 --> 00:55:01.524
This you can get very easily if you just meditate

00:55:01.983 --> 00:55:07.983
every day and see for yourself how the expression

00:55:08.442 --> 00:55:13.608
of your Sahasrara is penetrating into your being

00:55:14.067 --> 00:55:17.067
and is acting in your life.

00:55:17.484 --> 00:55:21.275
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be manifested

00:55:21.733 --> 00:55:25.733
and you don’t have to anymore doubt yourself,

00:55:26.108 --> 00:55:28.442
and others will never doubt you.

00:55:28.733 --> 00:55:31.025
May God bless you.
