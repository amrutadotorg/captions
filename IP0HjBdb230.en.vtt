WEBVTT

00:03.150 --> 00:10.983
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Krishna Puja.

00:14.524 --> 00:22.733
We have to understand clearly that Shri Krishna

00:23.067 --> 00:28.192
is a very, very important deity within us

00:29.524 --> 00:33.108
because He is the Vishnu,

00:33.650 --> 00:38.317
who resides in the Void,

00:40.484 --> 00:43.067
in the Nabhi.

00:43.608 --> 00:50.858
He is the one who generates Dharma within us.

00:51.317 --> 00:55.108
When you got your realization I didn’t tell you,

00:55.484 --> 00:57.733
“Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

00:58.192 --> 01:03.150
I never told you that “This is not good. That is not good.”

01:03.608 --> 01:05.650
You just did it

01:06.108 --> 01:12.359
because Shri Vishnu was awakened within you.

01:13.234 --> 01:15.525
He is in the Void

01:15.983 --> 01:20.067
and if He is awakened

01:20.942 --> 01:28.192
He brings you to the light,

01:28.942 --> 01:32.108
removes your ignorance, removes your darkness,

01:32.525 --> 01:36.608
and you start seeing that

01:37.900 --> 01:41.983
whatever you were doing was destructive for you,

01:42.524 --> 01:47.192
and that’s how the dharma is established.

01:47.525 --> 01:51.275
Of course, the Dharma was established also

01:51.733 --> 01:57.900
by all the ten Gurus who came on this earth,

01:58.234 --> 02:02.566
the prophets, who taught us about dharma.

02:12.025 --> 02:16.733
So this combination of Shri Vishnu

02:17.108 --> 02:20.525
and the ten Gurus

02:20.942 --> 02:26.359
is to establish Dharma within us.

02:26.733 --> 02:29.691
Now this Dharma is taught by prophets,

02:30.067 --> 02:31.775
as you have seen everywhere.

02:32.108 --> 02:35.566
They have said, “Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

02:35.983 --> 02:38.359
They have talked of Ten Commandments.

02:38.733 --> 02:44.733
Every prophet has talked about Dharma, what is to be done,

02:45.484 --> 02:49.566
up to a point when Christ also had to talk about it

02:50.025 --> 02:54.108
and He says, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

02:54.525 --> 03:02.816
But Shri Krishna is the one

03:03.234 --> 03:08.900
who says that “I come on this earth

03:09.359 --> 03:19.359
when there is a glani, means demise, of Dharma.”

03:20.733 --> 03:22.983
When the Dharma becomes weak

03:23.400 --> 03:25.733
then He comes on this Earth,

03:26.234 --> 03:28.942
and then He destroys the people

03:29.359 --> 03:34.566
who are responsible

03:35.317 --> 03:44.025
for bringing Dharma to this level of doom.

03:45.108 --> 03:48.025
The second thing He says, that

03:48.484 --> 03:53.650
“I protect the saints. I protect the saints

03:55.025 --> 04:02.858
and I kill all those who are devils or who are satanic,

04:03.275 --> 04:04.858
who are destructive.”

04:05.234 --> 04:06.900
These are His promises

04:07.317 --> 04:11.775
which He gave long time back as Shri Krishna.

04:12.192 --> 04:16.983
As Vishnu we know Him only as the one

04:17.400 --> 04:21.317
who is the giver of Dharma, mainly.

04:21.816 --> 04:25.525
But all His potent qualities really were expressed

04:25.942 --> 04:28.025
when He came as Shri Krishna.

04:28.484 --> 04:31.608
At the time of Shri Rama also these qualities

04:32.067 --> 04:34.983
could not be expressed in that way.

04:37.067 --> 04:40.275
So Shri Krishna’s first half of His life

04:40.650 --> 04:43.025
He spent in Gokul and Vrindavan

04:43.484 --> 04:51.150
where He showed His beautiful expression of His character,

04:51.650 --> 04:55.608
as He made it,

04:56.067 --> 04:59.275
what He calls as Leela, Leeladhara,

04:59.608 --> 05:04.484
the one who said that you become a witness;

05:06.108 --> 05:09.400
you witness the whole world like a drama,

05:09.775 --> 05:11.067
Sakshi Swarupa.

05:11.442 --> 05:18.108
And then once you see the whole world as just

05:18.608 --> 05:25.775
a child watches, in a child-like mirth and joy, you enjoy life.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.525
That has happened to you people

05:27.900 --> 05:32.983
that you have become like citizens of Vrindavan and Gokul,

05:33.359 --> 05:35.067
the way you are enjoying yourself,

05:35.442 --> 05:40.775
enjoying each other’s company, enjoying the bliss of God.

05:41.192 --> 05:44.067
Then He showed also by killing Kaliya,

05:44.442 --> 05:46.733
by killing Putana and other people,

05:47.192 --> 05:54.025
that if anybody tries to trouble such joyous children of God,

05:54.400 --> 06:00.275
He is the one who will definitely protect

06:00.608 --> 06:04.900
and kill all such evil forces which are troublesome.

06:05.442 --> 06:10.234
But later on He becomes the king,

06:10.650 --> 06:13.775
and when He becomes the king

06:14.150 --> 06:18.524
He uses His powers in a different way.

06:18.858 --> 06:22.942
First of all, if you see His own uncle, His own relation,

06:23.275 --> 06:26.775
His own uncle, mother’s brother, was Kansa,

06:27.234 --> 06:29.317
and was such a bad man.

06:29.733 --> 06:33.983
So Shri Krishna didn’t spare him, He killed him.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.608
He killed so many people.

06:37.067 --> 06:40.733
Before becoming the king, He killed so many people.

06:41.192 --> 06:48.484
Now what does that mean, that His own uncle He killed?

06:48.942 --> 06:56.525
One quality that He has, which Christ had, we can say,

06:56.983 --> 07:02.524
or so many saints had, is forgiveness.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.733
He did not believe in forgiveness.

07:07.234 --> 07:12.317
He’s the only one who said that, “I have to punish.”

07:12.775 --> 07:16.025
We have to have somebody who should punish also.

07:16.442 --> 07:18.150
If you are like Shiva,

07:18.525 --> 07:21.359
then Shiva used to even love rakshasas

07:21.775 --> 07:26.400
and in His innocence He used to give them also blessings.

07:26.775 --> 07:33.400
But Shri Krishna did not believe in forgiveness at all

07:34.234 --> 07:38.317
because it was important that there should be

07:38.608 --> 07:40.858
somebody with a very stern mind,

07:41.275 --> 07:45.108
with such a stern understanding that a devil is a devil,

07:45.442 --> 07:48.942
and devil must be killed.

07:52.192 --> 07:54.900
He has done in His lifetime,

07:55.275 --> 07:58.275
if you see, killing of so many people.

07:58.608 --> 08:01.108
That doesn’t mean that we have right to kill anybody.

08:01.442 --> 08:04.317
He was Shri Krishna; we are not.

08:04.858 --> 08:08.816
We have to forgive because we are human beings.

08:09.234 --> 08:12.858
Once we forgive we transfer all our anger,

08:13.275 --> 08:21.566
all our attitude of taking revenge, to Shri Krishna.

08:23.566 --> 08:25.192
He takes over.

08:25.524 --> 08:28.484
Once you say that “I forgive,” then He takes over,

08:28.775 --> 08:31.775
because He does not forgive.

08:32.359 --> 08:37.025
He will immediately take over from you

08:37.525 --> 08:41.484
and if it is justifiable, if it is necessary

08:41.775 --> 08:47.525
He will punish the people who are torturing saints,

08:47.900 --> 08:50.816
who are destroying the dharma.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.442
Now it is very surprising

08:54.733 --> 08:58.484
that whatever is preached by the person,

08:58.858 --> 09:03.234
that area becomes just the opposite of it.

09:03.650 --> 09:06.192
Is very surprising.

09:06.650 --> 09:11.525
Like we said that Christ said,

09:11.816 --> 09:13.983
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

09:14.359 --> 09:18.234
Christians are the worst as far as their eyes are concerned.

09:18.858 --> 09:25.275
In the same way, in the Hindu religion it is said that

09:26.525 --> 09:29.525
everybody has the spirit.

09:29.942 --> 09:34.775
Still the Hindus believe in the different castes and communities

09:35.275 --> 09:38.775
and fight with each other.

09:39.691 --> 09:45.400
Everything that was preached, just the opposite of it is followed.

09:45.816 --> 09:48.524
If you read even Koran, in the Koran,

09:48.900 --> 09:51.484
Mohammed Sahib has all the time

09:51.816 --> 09:54.442
said about rahmat, means compassion.

09:54.775 --> 09:56.525
But you don’t find it anywhere.

09:56.983 --> 09:58.566
He has not said about shariat,

09:58.942 --> 10:00.317
He has not said of many things

10:00.650 --> 10:04.816
which are being practiced by Muslims, just on their own.

10:05.275 --> 10:07.608
He never said that women should cover their face

10:07.983 --> 10:10.192
or cover their heads,

10:10.566 --> 10:14.067
but it is practiced and not practiced but vengeance.

10:14.484 --> 10:19.983
So what it shows to us is this, that whatever is preached,

10:20.359 --> 10:24.691
just the opposite of that people try to do.

10:27.234 --> 10:32.067
And when such things happen, the dharma goes down.

10:32.525 --> 10:38.150
Now as you know that Krishna, His country is America.

10:38.608 --> 10:40.442
He rules over America.

10:40.858 --> 10:48.983
So it is a rich country because Shri Krishna is Kubera.

10:49.524 --> 10:53.108
He is the Lord of wealth.

10:53.525 --> 10:57.234
So, He has given wealth to America.

10:57.691 --> 11:05.400
Then He is Vachana, means communication.

11:06.067 --> 11:11.691
His another quality is that He is the one who communicated.

11:12.108 --> 11:16.691
It was He who danced with gopis and gopas.

11:17.150 --> 11:24.108
It was He who transferred His powers to them.

11:24.566 --> 11:30.733
So the communication part is one of His greatest qualities

11:31.192 --> 11:33.484
that is working in America.

11:33.900 --> 11:39.067
So they are going just the opposite way

11:39.484 --> 11:42.275
that if there is a war, say, with Saddam Hussein,

11:42.650 --> 11:44.608
so America is going.

11:44.983 --> 11:47.650
If there’s Korean War, America is going.

11:48.025 --> 11:52.691
Everywhere there is any problem, America has to go.

11:52.942 --> 11:54.275
I mean, one can ask question,

11:54.566 --> 11:56.275
“Who are you? Why, why are you bothered?

11:56.650 --> 11:58.566
Keep to your own country enjoying yourself.

11:59.025 --> 12:00.775
Why are you sending troops all over?

12:01.108 --> 12:02.525
Why are you looking after everyone?”

12:02.900 --> 12:05.484
Even the formation of UN and all that is done

12:05.816 --> 12:09.816
under the guidance of the Americans.

12:10.192 --> 12:12.484
They play a very important part

12:12.816 --> 12:16.442
in the formation of this United Nations

12:16.858 --> 12:22.150
and one world and peace and all sorts of things.

12:22.650 --> 12:28.983
But actually, if you see, the main thing that Krishna had taught,

12:29.442 --> 12:31.858
they are missing.

12:32.234 --> 12:33.900
They are all right for communication.

12:34.192 --> 12:37.733
They are all right for establishing

12:38.067 --> 12:40.900
relationships between countries.

12:41.317 --> 12:45.484
But the worst thing they have done is that there is no dharma,

12:45.775 --> 12:49.484
no idea of dharma, no morality.

12:50.442 --> 12:54.067
Democracy without morality.

12:54.524 --> 13:00.025
To talk of morality in America is something out of the blue.

13:00.525 --> 13:05.025
They cannot understand anyone who talks of morality.

13:05.525 --> 13:09.733
Now, of course, the pangs of their doings

13:10.108 --> 13:13.150
is really torturing them.

13:13.608 --> 13:17.650
And also they are realizing, some of them,

13:17.983 --> 13:21.275
that because of immoral behavior

13:21.733 --> 13:26.317
they have come to a point where

13:26.650 --> 13:30.983
sixty-five percent people of that country who are Americans

13:31.400 --> 13:37.733
may suffer from some disease or may just die out

13:38.192 --> 13:40.442
at a very young age.

13:40.775 --> 13:45.983
When it is coming

13:46.442 --> 13:53.317
as a starking

13:57.150 --> 14:00.525
information is a shock.

14:00.942 --> 14:04.566
But despite that, despite all this,

14:04.942 --> 14:08.067
they are still going on with it and thinking that

14:08.400 --> 14:13.317
“No, no, no, it’s all right. It’s not for us. What is there to worry?”

14:13.858 --> 14:17.942
Now His punishments have started,

14:18.400 --> 14:22.317
which they don’t realize how the punishment has started.

14:22.691 --> 14:27.275
Now supposing somebody is leading an immoral life

14:27.733 --> 14:32.234
and as a result he develops some disease.

14:32.775 --> 14:37.275
Now this disease is not curable.

14:38.108 --> 14:41.192
They try everything to find out the ways and methods

14:41.525 --> 14:44.067
of curing these diseases which are coming

14:44.442 --> 14:48.025
out of immoral living. They cannot.

14:48.484 --> 14:54.608
It’s an impossible task for all the medical sciences of America

14:54.858 --> 14:58.983
to find out how to cure these particular diseases

14:59.275 --> 15:01.733
which are coming out of immorality.

15:02.067 --> 15:05.067
But the worst part is that they cannot even say

15:05.484 --> 15:09.359
that immorality is wrong.

15:09.942 --> 15:15.691
They cannot even openly admit that immoral behavior

15:16.108 --> 15:19.442
leads to these things.

15:19.983 --> 15:24.442
And this immorality is completely neglected

15:24.900 --> 15:28.650
in a country of Shri Krishna where He was born,

15:29.150 --> 15:34.983
always He says, just to establish morality.

15:36.275 --> 15:39.317
Artificial morality, that is there,

15:39.733 --> 15:43.234
like the Islamic talk about or the Christians talk about

15:43.691 --> 15:48.900
or Hindus talk about, is artificial, where they are hypocritical.

15:49.359 --> 15:51.691
They follow one code of conduct

15:52.108 --> 15:59.192
and another they have for themselves secretly adopted.

15:59.566 --> 16:03.275
But America is an open thing.

16:03.691 --> 16:07.025
Whatsoever they are doing they are not hiding it.

16:07.484 --> 16:09.608
They say, “We don’t believe in hypocrisy.”

16:10.108 --> 16:11.691
So they are not hiding it.

16:12.067 --> 16:16.025
And this has led this country, such a vast,

16:16.400 --> 16:18.983
beautiful, rich, prosperous country,

16:19.359 --> 16:22.900
into such a ditch that I do not know

16:23.317 --> 16:26.025
how it is going to recover unless and until

16:26.400 --> 16:28.900
it takes to Sahaja Yoga.

16:29.317 --> 16:35.566
Now another thing what dharma does to a normal person?

16:36.234 --> 16:39.275
A dharmic person is the one who is always

16:39.608 --> 16:42.025
introspective by nature.

16:42.484 --> 16:49.317
He tries to see, “Am I doing things all right? Is it correct?”

16:49.775 --> 16:54.858
He doesn’t allow his mind to justify wrong things.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.400
That is one of the signs of a real dharmic person.

16:58.733 --> 17:00.359
He may not be a Sahaja yogi.

17:00.858 --> 17:06.858
But he will ask himself, “Is it right or is it wrong?”

17:07.359 --> 17:12.608
But that capacity is completely gone in America.

17:13.067 --> 17:15.983
They never try to introspect themselves.

17:16.484 --> 17:20.524
On the contrary, they always say, “What’s wrong?”

17:20.983 --> 17:24.650
Those people who go on like this

17:25.067 --> 17:32.733
will definitely fall into a mess of things

17:33.108 --> 17:40.650
that will have no moral conductor, moral guidance.

17:42.400 --> 17:49.650
It is introspection which gives you a awakened conscience.

17:50.025 --> 17:53.524
It’s conscience which tells you, “This is wrong.”

17:53.900 --> 17:56.025
They may be guided in one part.

17:56.442 --> 17:59.067
For example, you see, they might say that

17:59.524 --> 18:03.650
“We are all right in administration,” maybe, or,

18:04.067 --> 18:10.524
“We are all right for, say, our railways, our shipping,

18:10.942 --> 18:15.524
our other things, or maybe other economic banks

18:15.900 --> 18:17.524
or whatever it is.”

18:17.900 --> 18:20.858
But all these things are extremely superficial

18:21.275 --> 18:24.775
for human beings and they are outside.

18:25.275 --> 18:30.400
The inside is all managed by the conscience

18:30.775 --> 18:36.524
and also through moral inspection of yourself.

18:36.942 --> 18:39.566
People say, “Mother, what is this conscience is?”

18:40.025 --> 18:41.442
This conscience is there.

18:41.858 --> 18:47.192
It is there all the time, but a person who has to be

18:47.608 --> 18:51.400
conscious about it. “I have a conscience”.

18:51.942 --> 18:55.650
And this conscience has to answer.

18:56.150 --> 18:59.775
That conscience that is within us is,

19:00.192 --> 19:05.816
is the light of Shri Krishna within us even before realization.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.858
As you know, the ascent takes place, of Kundalini,

19:10.400 --> 19:14.484
through the Sushumna which is guided by Mahalakshmi.

19:14.900 --> 19:18.566
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

19:19.900 --> 19:24.108
By listening to your conscience

19:24.733 --> 19:32.816
you develop a proper channel of Mahalakshmi within yourself.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.733
But the people who have no conscience,

19:36.150 --> 19:40.359
in a particular line it’s not so; it is in every line, in every way.

19:40.733 --> 19:42.525
Otherwise, one chakra will be all right,

19:42.942 --> 19:45.317
another chakra will be in jeopardy.

19:45.733 --> 19:49.650
So the conscience has to be referred to,

19:50.192 --> 19:53.442
which is beyond rationality. It is not rationality.

19:53.942 --> 19:57.067
Something may look like rational to kill somebody

19:57.484 --> 19:59.025
or to snatch somebody’s money

19:59.484 --> 20:03.359
or to grab somebody’s land. May seem.

20:03.816 --> 20:08.192
But conscience will tell you that this is not right.

20:08.650 --> 20:12.025
At a time when people invaded so many countries

20:12.442 --> 20:15.900
and tried to overpower them,

20:16.400 --> 20:18.858
it was America which was the only country,

20:19.234 --> 20:22.566
you must understand, never went out of their bounds

20:23.025 --> 20:25.524
to become empires.

20:25.983 --> 20:28.234
Very surprising, what kept them there.

20:28.650 --> 20:31.566
Because at that time when all this nonsense was going on

20:31.942 --> 20:37.067
all over the world, and that era when people

20:37.442 --> 20:39.359
didn’t mind subjecting other people,

20:39.650 --> 20:43.816
taking away their lands and becoming this thing,

20:44.525 --> 20:47.400
America had stopped at that time.

20:47.816 --> 20:50.484
Before doing that, they had done once for all.

20:50.900 --> 20:54.108
They had occupied the area, they became the landlords,

20:54.442 --> 20:57.317
they became this. Of course they were foreigners.

20:57.733 --> 20:59.858
But after having done that,

21:00.359 --> 21:03.691
the era when the people started expanding their empire,

21:04.192 --> 21:07.067
they did not do it.

21:07.566 --> 21:11.275
Now what is the reason? Why they didn’t do it?

21:11.525 --> 21:12.650
We should ask a question:

21:13.025 --> 21:15.816
when others were expanding their empires,

21:16.150 --> 21:20.150
why did not America do it?

21:20.733 --> 21:23.025
The reason is very simple.

21:23.359 --> 21:26.900
At that time some great people with great conscience

21:27.317 --> 21:29.317
were born in that country

21:29.733 --> 21:33.192
and they guided that country.

21:33.608 --> 21:37.816
Like, you can say, Washington was there.

21:38.317 --> 21:43.691
Of course, there were so many people, whom if I name there,

21:44.067 --> 21:45.816
there will be a big list of those people.

21:46.150 --> 21:49.234
But if you see their character, their life, the way they lived.

21:49.566 --> 21:51.775
Abraham Lincoln, if you see his life,

21:52.234 --> 21:55.150
full of conscience, full of conscience.

21:55.608 --> 22:00.816
And they didn’t allow the nation to be drifted away

22:01.234 --> 22:04.234
to the ambition of gathering other countries

22:04.650 --> 22:06.900
and making them their slaves and ...

22:07.317 --> 22:09.775
This they didn’t do.

22:10.275 --> 22:16.067
So in the first place when the,

22:16.484 --> 22:18.983
when, I should say, Columbus went there, conquered them,

22:19.400 --> 22:24.525
and tried to … actually, he didn’t do much.

22:24.983 --> 22:27.608
But Spanish and then others, and then Anglo-Saxons,

22:27.983 --> 22:30.691
all of them, when they conquered that country,

22:31.108 --> 22:33.816
once they settled down there,

22:34.359 --> 22:39.691
as if that era was over for them once for all,

22:40.192 --> 22:43.484
and then they started talking about freedom,

22:43.942 --> 22:48.192
of democracy, of higher values.

22:48.733 --> 22:55.816
But the karmas of their past,

22:56.442 --> 23:01.608
the way they killed so many aboriginals,

23:02.108 --> 23:04.650
so many Red Indians,

23:05.150 --> 23:09.192
will not be forgiven by Shri Krishna

23:09.691 --> 23:15.067
unless and until now they take to Sahaja Yoga.

23:16.608 --> 23:19.858
Despite that time when they did not try

23:20.359 --> 23:23.691
to overpower other countries and to spread their empire

23:24.108 --> 23:29.900
and do all kinds of cruelties, like Hitler, they didn’t do that.

23:30.400 --> 23:33.566
And they always stood for something that is justice …

23:34.067 --> 23:35.775
tried to, I mean, at least.

23:36.150 --> 23:39.816
Then they became hypocritical also but on the whole,

23:40.192 --> 23:43.192
on the face of it, they tried to show

23:43.524 --> 23:46.524
that they are for uniting the whole world.

23:46.900 --> 23:51.608
They are against racialism, against fundamentalism, all these,

23:51.983 --> 23:57.359
I mean, just some sort of an idealism they propagated.

23:57.816 --> 24:04.150
But despite all that, all these ideas of self-destruction

24:04.524 --> 24:07.067
started working in them.

24:07.359 --> 24:12.484
So I would say it is nothing but their karmas

24:12.816 --> 24:16.691
are working against them.

24:17.691 --> 24:23.442
And that’s how the violence is so much rampant there.

24:23.900 --> 24:26.566
So many diseases, so many things,

24:27.067 --> 24:32.359
it is very remarkable that all these troubles have started

24:32.858 --> 24:36.900
very, very recently in America,

24:38.650 --> 24:43.108
because the exposure is coming up.

24:43.566 --> 24:46.524
To add up to that, we had lots of false gurus

24:46.858 --> 24:52.108
who went there and captured

24:53.150 --> 24:55.942
innocent, simple people who were seeking the truth.

24:56.150 --> 24:58.566
We have lost so many of them in America.

24:58.942 --> 25:04.067
Also there, I would say, in the atmosphere where these

25:04.566 --> 25:07.484
curses of the people whom they had killed,

25:07.900 --> 25:12.775
which reacted, and they took to something that was wrong.

25:13.192 --> 25:15.816
Why should they have taken to wrong things

25:16.192 --> 25:19.650
as far as their personal life is concerned?

25:20.108 --> 25:22.275
Freedom was given to them

25:22.733 --> 25:26.775
but they thought freedom is there also to ruin themselves

25:27.234 --> 25:30.525
or to make a mess out of their lives.

25:31.108 --> 25:34.858
This is a wrong idea which worked in them.

25:35.359 --> 25:37.650
Then the whole idea became collective.

25:38.150 --> 25:40.733
When it became collective they found out that people

25:41.192 --> 25:43.900
like all those things that are destructive.

25:44.442 --> 25:46.442
So, we have Hollywood there,

25:46.900 --> 25:50.525
we have all such organizations and musicians

25:51.067 --> 25:58.025
and big, big, we can say, destructive forces

25:58.858 --> 26:06.150
which have formed groups and militant organizations

26:06.525 --> 26:13.775
which openly say that “We are that.”

26:14.150 --> 26:20.983
For example, only in America we have satan’s,

26:21.442 --> 26:25.650
satan’s organization, devils’ organizations.

26:26.234 --> 26:30.442
Then there’s witchcraft. Openly.

26:30.942 --> 26:36.150
Openly, they are registered organizations in America,

26:36.650 --> 26:39.108
when nowhere in the world you can have such a thing

26:39.442 --> 26:41.442
that this is a black magic organization,

26:41.816 --> 26:43.400
this is a witchcraft organization,

26:43.816 --> 26:46.983
openly they are registered there.

26:47.484 --> 26:50.691
So to such an extent they have gone;

26:51.150 --> 26:54.608
and accepted collectively.

26:55.067 --> 26:59.733
The reason is the punishment.

27:00.484 --> 27:05.858
That’s why America is the most difficult place for us,

27:06.359 --> 27:09.650
for Sahaja Yoga.

27:10.108 --> 27:12.733
One must have real sympathy for them.

27:13.234 --> 27:17.733
They are now passing through the phase of punishment,

27:18.317 --> 27:23.108
because their forefathers did all kinds of wrong things

27:23.525 --> 27:28.525
and they, too, never accepted Dharma as a principle of life.

27:29.317 --> 27:32.525
They thought that Dharma means killing your freedom;

27:32.983 --> 27:37.484
dharma means it takes away your personal, private life

27:37.858 --> 27:43.608
into the hands of something else.

27:44.067 --> 27:49.025
So to establish Dharma in America,

27:49.816 --> 27:51.525
what can we do?

27:51.983 --> 27:54.691
I’ve been to America at least ten times

27:55.108 --> 27:58.442
more than I’ve been to Russia

27:58.983 --> 28:06.108
and I want to really somehow or other bring to their notice that

28:06.400 --> 28:08.650
"You have lost your Dharma."

28:09.025 --> 28:10.524
But this will never appeal to them

28:10.858 --> 28:12.192
because they are very egoistical.

28:12.566 --> 28:15.608
If you tell them like that, then they’ll be very angry.

28:16.067 --> 28:18.484
On the contrary, those who tell them, like Rajneesh

28:18.816 --> 28:22.317
and all these people, “Oh, this, no dharma,” their weaknesses,

28:22.733 --> 28:26.025
their egos are pampered. Then they are very happy.

28:26.484 --> 28:29.025
So it’s a difficult task in that country

28:29.442 --> 28:33.608
to make people understand that you are under punishment,

28:34.067 --> 28:36.775
that this punishment you can only overcome

28:37.192 --> 28:39.442
if you become Sahaja yogis.

28:39.816 --> 28:43.484
With Sahaja Yoga their dharma will be awakened

28:43.942 --> 28:49.359
and all their punishments and all their curses will be over.

28:49.775 --> 28:52.359
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga much more

28:52.733 --> 28:54.566
than any other country.

28:55.025 --> 28:58.525
My concern for America is for the same reason.

28:59.108 --> 29:01.525
I’m not saying so much about South America

29:02.067 --> 29:04.400
but more about the North America.

29:04.816 --> 29:07.900
But even in South America, what I found is

29:08.442 --> 29:16.484
that it is a kind of a nation

29:17.108 --> 29:24.524
where they have no guidance at all about Dharma, no guidance.

29:25.317 --> 29:28.234
Openly they are doing carnival, this, that.

29:28.691 --> 29:33.858
I mean, how can you do it in a country, all those things?

29:34.275 --> 29:37.816
They are following the footsteps of North America.

29:38.275 --> 29:41.150
Like in North America they have that Halloween nonsense.

29:41.524 --> 29:42.983
I mean, imagine openly on the street

29:43.400 --> 29:45.275
doing Halloween nonsense.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.192
So they are following carnival.

29:47.608 --> 29:50.566
To them, “Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

29:50.942 --> 29:54.566
as if there is a very big achievement and going into that carnival

29:54.942 --> 29:56.067
from all over the places.

29:56.524 --> 30:00.733
From Australia people are coming down.

30:02.025 --> 30:07.317
All this is working against them very much.

30:07.691 --> 30:11.025
Their situation is so bad in so many ways

30:11.525 --> 30:18.150
that it is not easy to explain why they are going to that limit.

30:18.650 --> 30:24.775
Like thirteen-year-old girls are made into prostitutes in Brazil.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.608
Openly.

30:29.484 --> 30:33.525
All their trees are cut in Amazon. Openly.

30:34.067 --> 30:37.025
Whole smuggling is done, openly.

30:37.484 --> 30:39.900
Their politicians are corrupt.

30:40.275 --> 30:43.733
There, I mean, so much of black magic there,

30:44.150 --> 30:47.067
so much of black magic. Openly that.

30:47.524 --> 30:53.525
They are just following the footsteps of North America.

30:54.025 --> 30:58.983
The Dharma is like this Catholic Church is there.

30:59.484 --> 31:02.942
What is it going to teach them Dharma, this Catholic Church?

31:03.442 --> 31:06.524
So they go to church, they do everything

31:06.942 --> 31:12.942
and they come back home with same ideas that they have.

31:13.524 --> 31:17.524
There are countries and countries which are so very poor.

31:18.025 --> 31:23.150
So that shows that Kubera’s attention is not on that country.

31:23.691 --> 31:27.192
Normally, poor people are dharmic, normally.

31:27.816 --> 31:29.983
Because you see, money gives them these ideas

31:30.442 --> 31:33.317
to do all nonsensical things and ego.

31:33.775 --> 31:38.900
Normally, the poor people are dharmic but there it is different.

31:39.317 --> 31:42.359
They indulge into black magic too much.

31:42.733 --> 31:45.524
They were telling Me that it is the black magic

31:45.816 --> 31:48.359
which came from Africa and they have accepted.

31:48.775 --> 31:52.400
But so much it is developed in South America

31:52.816 --> 31:55.942
that it is impossible to understand that

31:56.525 --> 31:59.150
how they have accepted this nonsense

31:59.608 --> 32:02.942
so easily to curse themselves.

32:03.400 --> 32:06.150
Now, we have to understand that these problems

32:06.484 --> 32:11.816
also exist within ourselves, on our Vishuddhi Chakra.

32:12.608 --> 32:18.525
If we have to keep our Vishuddhi Chakra all right,

32:19.192 --> 32:24.317
we have two sides as you know, is the left and the right.

32:24.983 --> 32:32.524
So the right side is the Vishuddhi Chakra which is speaking,

32:32.983 --> 32:36.108
which is talking about Dharma,

32:36.524 --> 32:41.858
which is on the aggressive side, we can say.

32:42.733 --> 32:46.234
Now those people who are aggressive,

32:46.733 --> 32:48.525
who talk in an aggressive manner,

32:48.942 --> 32:54.816
who are, say, trying to dominate others by their talks,

32:55.525 --> 32:59.400
are the people who are right-sided.

32:59.816 --> 33:04.400
I’ve seen people, those who really do wrong things.

33:04.775 --> 33:08.942
Say, a person, a servant steals something.

33:09.524 --> 33:13.524
You call him, he’ll be so rude to you that you’ll be amazed.

33:13.858 --> 33:15.234
This man is so rude.

33:15.608 --> 33:20.525
How can he, how can have been able to steal something?

33:20.983 --> 33:25.067
He’s not afraid; he’s answering you back so nicely.

33:25.525 --> 33:27.775
So those people who are right-sided

33:28.192 --> 33:30.733
can cover up any sin that they have committed,

33:31.150 --> 33:32.400
any wrong they have done,

33:32.775 --> 33:36.150
any murder they have done, by their talk.

33:36.650 --> 33:41.484
It could be a talk which is very aggressive, blatant.

33:41.858 --> 33:46.025
People might think, “Oh, how can that be?

33:46.442 --> 33:49.608
This man is telling so loudly everything,”

33:50.067 --> 33:53.067
and you just, you are stunned and you think,

33:53.442 --> 33:56.484
“No, it’s not possible. How can a person who says this thing ?”

33:56.858 --> 34:01.108
In this way we, too, as ordinary human beings,

34:01.525 --> 34:06.067
indulge into all kinds of nonsensical things

34:06.525 --> 34:10.442
and then we try to justify it by talking,

34:11.317 --> 34:13.192
wriggling out of it.

34:13.525 --> 34:20.067
You know as many criminals, war criminals,

34:20.524 --> 34:24.067
have come out of it by just talking,

34:24.608 --> 34:27.900
by creating stories, by showing something like that.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.359
That also is with all human beings,

34:31.775 --> 34:34.816
they have this capacity to say something

34:35.234 --> 34:39.484
by which to hide whatever wrong you are doing.

34:39.858 --> 34:42.108
But it is never realized by them

34:42.566 --> 34:47.234
that whatever harm you have done is not going to be forgiven

34:48.484 --> 34:51.983
and will be less forgiven when you talk like this,

34:52.524 --> 34:55.400
because Shri Krishna is finished.

34:55.942 --> 35:01.317
If you start justifying, rationalizing all your wrong things,

35:01.942 --> 35:06.858
then you will be punished and you will be punished very badly

35:07.317 --> 35:11.942
in so many ways that you will not know how to get it out of it.

35:12.442 --> 35:16.983
Physically, mentally, emotionally, every way you’ll be.

35:17.566 --> 35:24.858
So our Right Vishuddhi we have to have a temperament,

35:25.317 --> 35:29.775
a culture, a style, a behavior

35:30.234 --> 35:33.025
which has got the quality of Shri Krishna,

35:33.442 --> 35:38.608
which is called as madhurya, means melodious, melodious.

35:39.025 --> 35:43.566
We should talk in such a manner that it should be melodious.

35:44.067 --> 35:47.108
The person who listens to you,

35:47.566 --> 35:55.150
listens as if he’s listening to the flute of Shri Krishna.

35:55.608 --> 35:59.900
The voice of a Sahaja yogi should be sweet like that.

36:00.359 --> 36:05.691
When you talk to someone it should be melodious.

36:06.275 --> 36:08.234
It should not be aggressive, at all,

36:08.650 --> 36:11.608
but on the contrary it should be melodious.

36:12.108 --> 36:15.983
It should not be sarcastic; it should not hurt another person.

36:16.484 --> 36:21.067
Any word that hurts others cannot be coming

36:21.442 --> 36:24.025
from the proper type of Right Vishuddhi.

36:24.442 --> 36:28.192
So in no way one should hurt.

36:28.733 --> 36:33.400
I wish all the Sahaja yogis develop that melodious voice

36:33.691 --> 36:37.359
of Shri Krishna as their Vishuddhi is awakened.

36:37.691 --> 36:43.942
Madhurya, in his behavior, madhurya is – you see,

36:44.317 --> 36:48.942
while talking to someone there are so many gestures by which

36:49.359 --> 36:53.150
you can express your madhurya.

36:53.650 --> 36:58.775
For example, specially in Italy and other places,

36:59.192 --> 37:00.983
I’ve seen people use too much of their hands.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.067
This is also Shri Krishna’s style.

37:03.524 --> 37:05.275
So they use their hands in such a way

37:05.650 --> 37:09.359
that sometimes you don’t understand what they are meaning.

37:09.775 --> 37:12.025
And sometimes it can be quite aggressive also,

37:12.442 --> 37:14.025
the way they use their hands.

37:14.442 --> 37:17.359
Now, the hands must be used in such a way

37:17.775 --> 37:20.775
that it should create madhurya.

37:21.234 --> 37:26.359
I’ve seen this in Russia or specially in Eastern blocs

37:26.733 --> 37:30.150
where people, they have to express their love

37:30.525 --> 37:35.275
– [just put like this, it’s cold] – if they have to say namaste.

37:35.691 --> 37:38.234
The whole expression is so sweet,

37:38.650 --> 37:44.900
and also their heart is very full when they see Me.

37:45.317 --> 37:47.359
So they don’t know how to express it.

37:47.733 --> 37:52.067
So they just put their hands like this.

37:52.524 --> 37:54.691
Or they feel shy, they do like this.

37:55.234 --> 37:59.317
Very, very sweet things they express through their hands,

37:59.608 --> 38:05.108
through their eyes. It is the tears, you see,

38:05.524 --> 38:13.150
that really create such clouds of, I should say,

38:13.484 --> 38:16.192
very dense clouds of compassion in My heart

38:16.608 --> 38:21.150
when I see their eyes expressing their love for Me.

38:21.608 --> 38:26.858
Everything, the tears, everything, that’s the face,

38:27.275 --> 38:32.442
the eyes, the hands, all these belong to Shri Krishna.

38:32.900 --> 38:36.067
So in their behavior, in their talking,

38:36.525 --> 38:40.192
how they express themselves.

38:40.691 --> 38:42.400
You can use the same eyes

38:42.816 --> 38:44.858
for showing your temper and getting angry.

38:45.317 --> 38:48.108
Many people use eyes for controlling others.

38:48.524 --> 38:51.983
They’ll put their eyes like this, stare at someone, try to control.

38:52.484 --> 38:58.691
They may use their eyes also for condemning someone.

38:59.192 --> 39:03.524
Also sometimes they use, sort of spit at someone

39:04.025 --> 39:10.150
or try to show the tongue to insult someone.

39:10.608 --> 39:17.442
So in the behavior also we must have a kind of a sweetness.

39:17.858 --> 39:21.025
Like when I went to, went to England first,

39:21.524 --> 39:24.359
I was, you see, I learnt English in My own way.

39:24.733 --> 39:26.816
But when I went there newly they said,

39:27.150 --> 39:29.234
“Now, if you have to say word like ‘thought’

39:29.525 --> 39:32.234
you must say ‘thought’.” I said, “What?”

39:32.608 --> 39:35.942
“You must take out your tongue and say ‘thought’”.

39:36.317 --> 39:39.775
I said, “Is absurd. Why should you take out your tongue?”

39:40.192 --> 39:43.317
He said, “Unless and until you take out your tongue like that

39:43.650 --> 39:48.108
is not something, proper expression.”

39:48.525 --> 39:50.525
So I said, “This is English. You have developed

39:50.900 --> 39:53.983
some nonsensical things, to show tongue at it, everyone.”

39:54.400 --> 39:56.317
Even a child, you know, when he gets angry

39:56.650 --> 39:57.983
automatically he shows his tongue.

39:58.359 --> 40:04.442
So you see all these expressions are – and making faces now,

40:04.816 --> 40:07.983
as they say that ‘stiff upper lip,’ you see.

40:08.317 --> 40:11.525
You must have heard about that, with a nose like that, you see,

40:11.858 --> 40:14.983
snooty nose or a face where you just make your faces

40:15.442 --> 40:21.608
and make a crooked face just to tease someone

40:22.067 --> 40:26.733
or to make an expression out of your nose.

40:27.108 --> 40:28.525
Also people do it like this, you see,

40:28.900 --> 40:31.816
to show as if you are sneezing at that person.

40:32.317 --> 40:34.858
All these things, expressions, are coming

40:35.359 --> 40:41.983
out of Shri Krishna’s grace, but the power of that is madhurya,

40:42.524 --> 40:45.775
is the sweetness, the melodiousness;

40:46.275 --> 40:52.234
the rapport should be so sweet that that rapport should create

40:52.691 --> 40:55.858
tremendous joy and tremendous happiness.

40:56.275 --> 41:00.691
As you have heard the song of Baba Mama’s on My eyes:

41:01.108 --> 41:05.192
only I looked at him, I say with that glance

41:05.525 --> 41:08.650
– that generated that beautiful music in him.

41:09.108 --> 41:13.067
So, as far as possible, as far as possible,

41:13.484 --> 41:16.983
try to put your eyes on the greenery; that’s the best.

41:17.484 --> 41:21.900
Then it soothes down and also you develop

41:22.359 --> 41:25.067
the soothing quality of the greenery.

41:25.524 --> 41:28.150
I always tell people that “Better see the greenery around,

41:28.566 --> 41:29.816
how it soothes your eyes.”

41:30.317 --> 41:33.816
In the same way you should try to soothe

41:34.608 --> 41:37.067
the other person when you talk to that person.

41:37.442 --> 41:39.025
The person must melt.

41:39.400 --> 41:43.317
Instead of that, if you start arguing and fighting with that person,

41:43.733 --> 41:44.900
that person will never melt.

41:45.234 --> 41:49.359
On the contrary, you’ll be adding fire, more fire to that person.

41:49.858 --> 41:53.691
That was the quality of Shri Krishna, is the madhurya,

41:54.150 --> 41:58.942
and that it is expressed in His lifetime

41:59.359 --> 42:03.400
how He beautifully managed to say things

42:03.775 --> 42:10.025
in His own sweetness, specially in His childhood.

42:10.816 --> 42:14.359
The another quality which Shri Krishna has, which

42:14.691 --> 42:20.858
we can express through our Right Vishuddhi, is diplomacy.

42:21.192 --> 42:23.192
But there are two types of diplomacies:

42:23.566 --> 42:26.067
one is genuine; one who is artificial.

42:26.524 --> 42:31.192
In the genuine diplomacy you do not have to take to

42:31.566 --> 42:35.566
a certain standard or you don’t have to read some books

42:36.067 --> 42:39.275
to know what is diplomacy.

42:39.691 --> 42:42.858
Is a genuinely it comes to you.

42:43.275 --> 42:46.525
It, the whole thing works very sweetly,

42:46.983 --> 42:49.983
in such a genuine manner.

42:50.442 --> 42:53.192
I, I have used it many-a-times Myself,

42:53.566 --> 42:56.025
and you all can use it also many-a-times.

42:56.400 --> 42:59.442
That’s only possible if you don’t get angry with them;

42:59.858 --> 43:02.566
not possible if you are angry.

43:03.067 --> 43:07.025
Now, there’s a story I’ve told you about some,

43:07.484 --> 43:08.816
this Gagangiri Maharaj.

43:09.150 --> 43:12.234
I went to meet him and he was very angry

43:12.650 --> 43:14.359
because he could not stop the rain.

43:14.858 --> 43:16.150
He was supposed to stop the rain.

43:16.524 --> 43:18.108
And I was all drenched.

43:18.484 --> 43:20.192
And he was so angry and he said that

43:20.524 --> 43:22.775
“Is it my ego You are trying to control?”

43:23.108 --> 43:25.691
and like that he started little bit fighting with Me.

43:25.900 --> 43:27.983
I said, “No, that’s not the reason.”

43:28.484 --> 43:31.691
He said, “Why? Why did You not allow me to stop the rain?

43:32.025 --> 43:32.858
You are all drenched.”

43:33.192 --> 43:35.733
I said, “Because you are a sanyasi

43:36.067 --> 43:37.359
and you bought a sari for Me.

43:37.650 --> 43:39.524
I would not take a sari from a sanyasi.

43:39.900 --> 43:41.983
So I had to get drenched, for your sake.”

43:42.484 --> 43:46.942
The whole thing finished off.

43:47.525 --> 43:50.733
The whole anger, temper, finished off.

43:51.275 --> 43:54.067
This is how we have to melt people.

43:54.525 --> 43:59.733
The diplomacy is not convincing anybody

44:00.108 --> 44:03.900
with his intellect or by temper or anything

44:04.317 --> 44:10.234
but it is to melt away another person by your goodness,

44:10.733 --> 44:13.067
by your good words, by your sweet words,

44:13.484 --> 44:15.317
by your forgiving nature.

44:15.733 --> 44:20.400
This quality He had and He tried this on many people.

44:20.775 --> 44:23.524
It worked on some; it did not work on some.

44:23.983 --> 44:25.525
He didn’t feel it’s a failure.

44:26.025 --> 44:28.025
It’s the reaction of the another person

44:28.442 --> 44:30.525
which is important to be seen.

44:30.900 --> 44:34.442
So this quality of Right Vishuddhi you should have,

44:34.816 --> 44:39.608
is to talk to others and melt them away.

44:39.942 --> 44:44.067
I hope in America people develop this quality

44:44.525 --> 44:48.400
and try to improve relations with each other.

44:48.733 --> 44:51.733
Actually, to talk to they are very sweet, I must say.

44:52.192 --> 44:53.775
They get very friendly with you.

44:54.150 --> 44:55.775
You give them any number of presents,

44:56.150 --> 44:58.816
they’ll be very happy but they’ll never give you any present.

44:59.234 --> 45:01.192
You call them for dinner, anything,

45:01.608 --> 45:04.359
they’ll ten times they will come to your house for dinner

45:04.775 --> 45:06.691
but they will never call you for dinner.

45:07.150 --> 45:09.566
You see, they are very friendly as long

45:09.942 --> 45:11.484
as you are doing anything for them.

45:11.900 --> 45:15.442
But when it comes to returning it they find it difficult;

45:15.858 --> 45:19.442
they don’t do it. So, you see the whole thing amounts

45:19.733 --> 45:23.067
to be a very sweet exploitation of another person.

45:23.566 --> 45:26.484
This is what is to be understood that by sweetness

45:26.900 --> 45:30.275
you are not going to exploit anyone but by sweetness

45:30.650 --> 45:34.525
you are going to melt that person and bring him to the level

45:34.942 --> 45:40.359
that he can understand what is goodness.

45:41.025 --> 45:43.816
Now, about South America, I’ve already told you

45:44.317 --> 45:48.900
that they are extremely simple and innocent people.

45:49.317 --> 45:52.192
They are very poor, simple, innocent,

45:52.650 --> 45:55.650
but what has entered them into is this black magic,

45:56.150 --> 45:59.942
and which they are now realizing, luckily,

46:00.359 --> 46:03.150
that this is black magic which is troubling them.

46:03.608 --> 46:06.067
But somehow they have depended on it so much,

46:06.484 --> 46:07.566
on the left side.

46:07.900 --> 46:10.192
They feel very guilty about it; they feel very bad.

46:10.524 --> 46:12.900
All the time you find them absolutely guilty.

46:13.359 --> 46:14.858
Their whole behavior is that

46:15.317 --> 46:17.400
as if they have done something wrong

46:17.816 --> 46:20.691
but they do not know how to correct themselves.

46:21.150 --> 46:25.733
So for us is important not to feel guilty about anything.

46:26.192 --> 46:28.775
We are all Sahaja yogis.

46:29.192 --> 46:31.858
How can we have guilt after all, when we are the spirit?

46:32.234 --> 46:33.983
Spirit cannot have the guilt.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.234
So this guilt has to go away.

46:36.608 --> 46:41.733
But by guilt what do we do, what we lose is the witness power,

46:42.192 --> 46:45.275
because when there is a guilt we put it here, the guilt is there.

46:45.691 --> 46:48.192
But we cannot see.

46:48.566 --> 46:51.900
We cannot witness what’s wrong

46:52.359 --> 46:54.317
and we do not want to face the difficulty,

46:54.608 --> 46:58.524
our mistakes or the difficulty we have.

46:58.942 --> 47:01.025
Just put it as a guilt here, finished.

47:01.359 --> 47:03.359
Is stored up there nicely, guilt.

47:03.775 --> 47:05.442
But we do not want to face it.

47:05.816 --> 47:09.942
For example a man, say, or a woman is very cruel by nature.

47:10.317 --> 47:13.858
Then suddenly she realizes that she has been cruel

47:14.275 --> 47:16.234
or whatever it is. So she puts it down there,

47:16.566 --> 47:18.442
“Oh, I’ve been very bad. I’ve been very cruel,

47:18.775 --> 47:22.608
this thing, that thing.” But she doesn’t face it.

47:22.983 --> 47:25.400
Facing means she should know, “Why was I cruel?

47:25.691 --> 47:27.858
What was the need for me? I should not have been cruel

47:28.275 --> 47:31.691
and now I will not be cruel anymore.” That finishes off.

47:32.108 --> 47:35.650
But, “I’m very guilty about it. I’m very guilty about it,”

47:36.150 --> 47:38.108
doesn’t help. On the contrary, you know,

47:38.400 --> 47:40.025
what are the problems are of the guilt,

47:40.400 --> 47:44.733
and the same problems are today faced by South America.

47:45.275 --> 47:48.108
When I went there I was surprised that in Brazil

47:48.525 --> 47:53.900
the man who was the topmost there talked to Me in a manner,

47:54.317 --> 47:56.733
“Oh, we are, we know we have lots of defects.

47:57.192 --> 47:59.234
We know we are no good,” this, that.

47:59.691 --> 48:02.858
What I just say, why doesn’t he correct?

48:06.150 --> 48:08.442
If he knows this is the mistake, this is the thing,

48:08.816 --> 48:10.983
why shouldn’t he correct? Then he told Me that

48:11.400 --> 48:13.900
“You write to me all the things You found wrong with us.”

48:14.359 --> 48:16.108
And it was really very sweet of him.

48:16.566 --> 48:20.150
So then one journalist came and we told him.

48:20.484 --> 48:22.608
And now I think they are doing something about it.

48:22.942 --> 48:25.525
They are trying to improve it and things will improve definitely.

48:26.025 --> 48:30.525
But on the contrary I found that Russia is very different.

48:30.858 --> 48:34.108
In Russia they never said, “We are guilty,” or anything,

48:34.524 --> 48:37.067
nothing of the kind. They never said so.

48:37.524 --> 48:39.359
They said, “That time is over now.

48:39.691 --> 48:42.942
We are in the kingdom of God. Finished.

48:43.317 --> 48:47.317
So that is over. We are now in the Kingdom of God

48:47.650 --> 48:51.359
and we have to enjoy life.” Everything positive.

48:51.691 --> 48:53.942
Never talked of their past, of their governments

48:54.317 --> 48:58.858
or this happened, or Stalin or Lenin or anyone.

48:59.317 --> 49:02.400
They were not concerned. They were above it.

49:02.816 --> 49:05.108
“So why should we worry?” They said, “Why should we worry?

49:05.442 --> 49:06.942
Let them fight. Let them do what they like.”

49:07.359 --> 49:09.983
They don’t want to know anything about their politics,

49:10.400 --> 49:13.317
about their problems or anything.

49:13.733 --> 49:15.525
They think, “Our problems are solved.

49:15.942 --> 49:17.691
We are now realized souls.

49:18.108 --> 49:20.900
We are enjoying ourselves. Let us enjoy.”

49:21.317 --> 49:24.525
Very straight-forward way of understanding Sahaja Yoga.

49:25.025 --> 49:26.983
But I’ve seen people, they write to Me

49:27.359 --> 49:29.775
ten pages of their confessions as if I am a priest,

49:30.192 --> 49:33.525
Catholic priest, you see, all about their, what they have done,

49:33.900 --> 49:35.983
this they have done, and I don’t want to read it.

49:36.400 --> 49:39.108
Just throw it or I burn it off.

49:39.566 --> 49:42.067
So they try to confess. There’s no need to confess.

49:42.525 --> 49:46.234
There’s nothing to say. And not to dwell upon

49:46.525 --> 49:49.775
what wrongs you have done, but now enjoy what you have got it.

49:50.150 --> 49:53.733
It’s like this: supposing a beggar is made a king, all right?

49:54.150 --> 49:57.524
Then he should enjoy his kingdom, should behave like a king.

49:57.900 --> 49:59.858
But still he remembers his past more,

50:00.275 --> 50:01.816
so anybody who passes by he says,

50:02.150 --> 50:06.150
“Give me five rupees or five pounds.” It’s like that.

50:06.525 --> 50:08.524
Once you are in the Kingdom of God,

50:08.900 --> 50:10.983
know that you are in the Kingdom of God.

50:11.442 --> 50:16.275
But this black magic business is very, very dangerous

50:16.691 --> 50:18.359
and it can act through anyone.

50:18.691 --> 50:21.691
It can act through your relations, act through your friends,

50:22.067 --> 50:23.400
act through anyone.

50:23.691 --> 50:26.983
So one has to be very careful that you do not become,

50:27.359 --> 50:30.234
because of your guilt business or whatever it is,

50:30.691 --> 50:34.317
you become vulnerable to black magic.

50:34.775 --> 50:37.400
It can ruin you. It can ruin your families.

50:37.816 --> 50:40.733
Even if you are a Sahaja yogi it can ruin you.

50:41.275 --> 50:44.816
So this guilt business has to be given up completely.

50:45.234 --> 50:47.733
You should not be guilty. Guilt is put into you.

50:48.150 --> 50:49.816
Somebody can say, “Oh you are so bad.

50:50.234 --> 50:53.108
You didn’t do this for me. You didn’t do that,”

50:53.442 --> 50:55.359
or something like that. They put ideas.

50:55.733 --> 50:58.025
Then you start feeling, “Oh, I should have done this for them.

50:58.317 --> 51:01.275
I should have. It was wrong on my part,” or something,

51:01.566 --> 51:02.525
and then the guilt starts.

51:02.900 --> 51:04.691
Instead of doing something for that person

51:05.150 --> 51:07.983
or instead of understanding that this all nonsense,

51:08.442 --> 51:11.524
they go on brooding on that, brooding and then suddenly

51:11.858 --> 51:17.775
they find they are in the trouble of getting possessed

51:18.192 --> 51:20.942
or being affected by black magic.

51:21.400 --> 51:25.108
So one has to forget it and get into the atmosphere

51:25.524 --> 51:30.525
where you know that you are now in the kingdom of God.

51:31.067 --> 51:34.608
For Shri Krishna, whatever is to be said is less than

51:35.025 --> 51:37.108
what He’s said always, I always feel,

51:37.525 --> 51:44.525
and that His main work is through our brain.

51:45.025 --> 51:49.067
That is Virata. He works through our brain.

51:49.566 --> 51:51.816
And as Shiva works through our heart,

51:52.192 --> 51:54.025
He works through our brain.

51:54.524 --> 52:00.108
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment,

52:00.524 --> 52:04.108
all the subtleties of the brain and the knowledge

52:04.608 --> 52:08.234
starts manifesting and expressing itself.

52:08.608 --> 52:10.484
But the greatest thing that happens,

52:10.816 --> 52:12.691
that integration takes place in your brain.

52:13.108 --> 52:14.983
It’s not that your heart wants one thing

52:15.442 --> 52:17.317
and your brain wants another thing.

52:17.733 --> 52:19.150
The integration takes place.

52:19.484 --> 52:21.067
And when that integration takes place

52:21.484 --> 52:24.733
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

52:25.192 --> 52:29.524
Even without thinking about it, without reading about it,

52:29.858 --> 52:31.816
you just become dharmic.

52:32.192 --> 52:34.150
You are not to be told that you have to be dharmic.

52:34.525 --> 52:37.733
Innately you become dharmic because your brain,

52:38.192 --> 52:42.359
which normally is used for rationality,

52:42.816 --> 52:44.691
for justifying all that is wrong,

52:45.150 --> 52:49.442
becomes dharmic, becomes divine.

52:49.816 --> 52:53.317
This is the greatest thing that Shri Krishna does to you

52:53.733 --> 52:58.608
is to make your brain, brain itself dharmic.

52:59.067 --> 53:08.150
It becomes a vehicle of understanding Dharma,

53:08.983 --> 53:18.359
of leading a dharmic life and of standing firmly on Dharma.

53:18.816 --> 53:25.400
It’s the brain; it is the brain which really,

53:25.900 --> 53:31.900
mostly, takes you away from Dharma, apart from black magic.

53:32.484 --> 53:37.192
But once your Sahasrara is opened out,

53:37.691 --> 53:43.192
Virata is expressed.

53:43.608 --> 53:45.775
Then you are amazed at yourself.

53:46.150 --> 53:48.525
The one who was indulging into everything thinking,

53:48.858 --> 53:51.525
“This is pleasure. This is my right. I should have done it.

53:51.983 --> 53:53.608
Who else can tell me?” and all that,

53:53.942 --> 53:56.900
suddenly you become a prophet.

53:57.317 --> 54:00.484
This is the greatest blessing of Shri Krishna

54:00.816 --> 54:06.025
that He is Virat, and the Virat is your brain,

54:06.524 --> 54:10.608
and the brain of God Almighty is Virat.

54:11.067 --> 54:13.650
So this is what one has to realize,

54:14.025 --> 54:17.524
that after realization a person gets ideas

54:17.858 --> 54:21.484
which are always constructive, and if they are not,

54:21.733 --> 54:23.484
then you are not yet a Sahaja yogi.

54:23.942 --> 54:28.234
Constructive and dharmic, that is very, very important

54:28.608 --> 54:33.484
for us to understand, where is our mind going?

54:33.942 --> 54:40.775
Is it contradicting, it is telling something else than what it is?

54:41.442 --> 54:45.942
We have to just keep a watch and you’ll be amazed to see

54:46.317 --> 54:50.317
how your brain has changed its ways.

54:50.816 --> 54:54.400
The upside brain has become normal.

54:54.816 --> 55:01.524
This you can get very easily if you just meditate

55:01.983 --> 55:07.983
every day and see for yourself how the expression

55:08.442 --> 55:13.608
of your Sahasrara is penetrating into your being

55:14.067 --> 55:17.067
and is acting in your life.

55:17.484 --> 55:21.275
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be manifested

55:21.733 --> 55:25.733
and you don’t have to anymore doubt yourself,

55:26.108 --> 55:28.442
and others will never doubt you.

55:28.733 --> 55:31.025
May God bless you.
