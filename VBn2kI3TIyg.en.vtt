00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.447
It means that you
will have to add better

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.430
gurus, brother, only
then you will go across.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.070
Because who will eat the rest?

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.250
Where is his shop?

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.730
Because they ate their
goods.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.810
Now they won’t recommend to
somebody, as doctors do, no.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.150
You will go to someone, sir, that I have
lost my eye; Ok, first lets

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.685
Examine Teeth .

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.200
Then you removed all the teeth there.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.210
Then he said that I will examine your
eye, removed your eye; All done.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.450
later, it was known that
nothing has happened to you.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.730
Similar is the condition of these people,
there is a partnership among all of them.

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:37.419
He said, "I only take this much, not the rest,
the rest for the guru [inaudible].

00:00:37.444 --> 00:00:42.452
Now that guru, another character sitting, has taken out
the rest of the money; Came to be known that

00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:49.277
the house has been sold, the children have all been
left out, they are standing on the cross roads,
the poor children are begging.

00:00:49.294 --> 00:00:53.493
When we don't use our intellect,
we go to such gurus.

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:58.927
And in this way think that any work that is done
in the name of God, God does, is a very wrong thing.

00:00:58.944 --> 00:01:00.843
Like today one lady met us there.

00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:06.893
So she said, "Our guru was prominent for [inaudible-of
Upanishads], but here she is sitting and ringing the bell.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.643
That we are in the refuge of the guru,
we are in the refuge of the guru.

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:14.813
So I said, then; She said,
"I'm crossed over now."

00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:17.373
Your own certificate, your own everything.

00:01:17.373 --> 00:01:18.693
How did you cross? ‘Beta’

00:01:18.693 --> 00:01:21.253
I took to the refuge of the guru, I was crossed.

00:01:21.253 --> 00:01:24.313
I said, this can not happen
by coming to my shelter either.

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:26.873
Now I am sitting alive, your guru is dead.

00:01:26.873 --> 00:01:30.773
But you say, "Mom! We are your refuge."
And get us across.

00:01:30.812 --> 00:01:35.993
It takes your effort, and the awakening of the Kundalini,
It’s the work of transcending.

00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:39.833
Until you cross, till then bowing your
head in refuge your, Mother!

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.453
This is not going to
work.

00:01:41.453 --> 00:01:43.193
I may tell you clearly,

00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:48.233
Until you have crossed over, till then
All sayings are nonsense, useless

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.532
That I have come your refuge, this and that.

00:01:50.557 --> 00:01:53.453
Hey, all this is you said from your side, but

00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:55.393
I had to come in refuge, isn’t it.

00:01:55.393 --> 00:02:00.813
Its me who has to act, the work must
be done through my hands; Unless I

00:02:00.813 --> 00:02:03.453
As long as the work is not done with my
hands, it will be a useless thing.

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:07.093
And let me tell you in totality that
The one who is not realized, is not transcended;

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.733
The realized one is has crossed over.

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:12.593
In it none can falsely certify,
no matter you fight for it,

00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:14.480
Quarrel, do whatever, what can I do.

00:02:14.513 --> 00:02:18.793
If didn’t then no, and it happened then its done;
Its straight forward that we can do

00:02:18.793 --> 00:02:21.693
hard work, but we can't transcend.

00:02:21.693 --> 00:02:26.853
We can try all out, we can give you love;
Can do all that but transcend,

00:02:26.853 --> 00:02:28.559
you will have to get realized.

00:02:28.593 --> 00:02:33.113
Like we can cook, we can cook great food,
but if you don’t have a tongue

00:02:33.113 --> 00:02:36.326
inside you, then we will feed
when and you will understand when.

00:02:36.353 --> 00:02:40.759
Your tongue should be awakened that
It may understand what mother has made.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:45.008
After all its you who has to eat; or eating
also I should do it for you.

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:51.393
It must be understood that the element is
the same; that Guru you get only from God.

00:02:51.393 --> 00:02:56.916
The Guru who ascends into the Supreme is
the Guru, and no one else is a Guru.

00:02:56.973 --> 00:03:02.034
All are blind, and where the blind is leading
other blind, God knows.

00:03:02.073 --> 00:03:04.708
Nothing happens with such a shrine.

00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:09.273
Shrine gets effective only after realization;
Prior to that Shrine is nothing.

00:03:09.273 --> 00:03:13.382
You must have seen that I don't let
anyone come to my feet without getting crossed over.

00:03:13.407 --> 00:03:16.765
Because what can I do if
you haven’t crossed over, what should I do? First

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.353
realisation is must. Yes, it is

00:03:18.353 --> 00:03:22.049
definitely there that many people
do transcend while coming on feet, that’s ok.

00:03:22.132 --> 00:03:25.693
But needs no shrine; he must
come refuge later.

00:03:25.693 --> 00:03:29.743
When you seek shrine the for then, at least,
for the sake of shrine one must get realized.

00:03:29.768 --> 00:03:34.651
There should be light, without
light, what are you going to do for me?

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:41.951
I don't know maybe if I am too from 420, 108,
how are you going to know if I am or not.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:44.879
Even if I am talking nonsense,
then how will you know?

00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:48.948
I will never let you come to my
feet until you have crossed over.

00:03:48.973 --> 00:03:53.093
That is why it was forbidden not
to be in captivation of anyone.

00:03:53.213 --> 00:03:57.113
Devotion should only be in front of
the one who reconciles you to God.

00:03:57.113 --> 00:04:01.653
Unless that event happens within you,
without substance

00:04:01.653 --> 00:04:04.352
you should not believe anything.

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:10.273
So, I have told you about our
element of security.

00:04:10.273 --> 00:04:15.488
Tomorrow I will tell you about the rest of
the elements, today has been a long day.

00:04:15.513 --> 00:04:19.393
And I was very happy about one thing, because
everyone said yesterday, tomorrow is cinema. Then

00:04:19.393 --> 00:04:20.893
no one will come, Mother! In the program.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:26.793
। And my father was going to London,
so I came, leaving him like that.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:29.813
I didn't even go to the airport! I
said no, I should go, maybe,

00:04:29.813 --> 00:04:34.613
Someone will come, and that's why I will come,
and I am very happy that you people

00:04:34.613 --> 00:04:39.953
Leaving your cinema, have here, it means
that you gave more importance to the element, and

00:04:39.953 --> 00:04:42.062
So I was very glad.

00:04:42.113 --> 00:04:45.896
By the grace of Mother, if you all cross today,
then tomorrow it will be a lot of fun, and

00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:47.063
Come here with everyone tomorrow.

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:55.638
They want to, but I've
seen that we have

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.297
we had one girl from England, her

00:04:59.322 --> 00:05:04.377
name was Felicity, and she came here;
I was speaking only in Hindi or Marathi,

00:05:04.402 --> 00:05:08.897
and .

00:05:08.922 --> 00:05:15.002
When she went back to England, she
lost all her vibrations, so, because I was

00:05:15.002 --> 00:05:15.942
speaking in English.

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:23.362
So, I said, what's the matter, and I
analysed it that when I'm speaking in

00:05:23.362 --> 00:05:28.630
English, Hindi or Marathi, it is a
mantra, it's a thing that gives energy, no

00:05:28.655 --> 00:05:33.042
doubt, but when I speak in English
language, specially, say, the people who

00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:37.842
understand English are, sort of,
they start thinking about it and their ego

00:05:37.842 --> 00:05:41.602
starts working it out, and when ego
starts working it out, you know what

00:05:41.602 --> 00:05:47.322
happens, and that's why the vibrations
were much poorer, and if you want, I

00:05:47.322 --> 00:05:51.857
will speak it, if you want Me to
speak in English, I will, I don't mind,

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:56.122
but the problem is this, that the
more I'll speak in English, the worse it

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.677
would be for vibrations.

00:05:57.702 --> 00:06:05.678
So, I would like all of you to tell
Me what should I do,

00:06:05.712 --> 00:06:09.545
because Indians don't go into
thought processes, you see, when

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.517
I speak in Hindi, they don't go
into thought processes so much.

00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:19.322
One or two might go, but it's not a
common thing, but Western people always

00:06:19.322 --> 00:06:24.201
must put everything into thought process, a
machinery, you see, already working it out.

00:06:24.242 --> 00:06:31.917
So, if you allow Me, it would be better
if I speak in Hindi today, is it all right?

00:06:31.942 --> 00:06:36.942
And just try to hear it from your Sahasrara,
and you'll be amazed that all your

00:06:36.942 --> 00:06:40.782
chakras can be opened out, just don't
try to understand it, that's the best,

00:06:40.807 --> 00:06:47.363
because it is the thought comes afterwards,

00:06:47.397 --> 00:06:49.897
the bijas, the seed of the thought,

00:06:50.002 --> 00:06:56.142
is the first, the primal, and the,
whether this language or that language or

00:06:56.142 --> 00:06:58.706
any language, the
seed is the same.

00:06:58.781 --> 00:07:02.782
You see, the cup is different, but
the seed is the same, and the effect of

00:07:02.782 --> 00:07:09.797
the cup should not be there, it is
the effect of the content of the cup,

00:07:09.822 --> 00:07:17.457
which is important, and once you just try
the content, you should not bother about it.

00:07:17.482 --> 00:07:24.322
So what you should care for is the
content, and not the, not the glass or

00:07:24.322 --> 00:07:31.262
the cup in which it is being delivered,
and for the people who are more worried

00:07:31.262 --> 00:07:35.362
about the cup always, it is better
that they don't know the cup, they better

00:07:35.362 --> 00:07:39.342
have it, the content, it will
help you, you will see that.

00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:44.922
Just think from that angle, actually
this is a very common thing, and

00:07:44.922 --> 00:07:52.222
Christine, who was also from London,
she never felt such force in, in England,

00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:56.442
but when she came to England, and
when she was moving about with Me, and I

00:07:56.442 --> 00:08:02.082
was mostly speaking in Hindi or Marathi,
and she's in the, another world now,

00:08:02.302 --> 00:08:03.282
and she's very good.

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:09.162
I think it also keeps your ego a
little bit down, you see, ego is too

00:08:09.162 --> 00:08:14.002
much in English speaking countries,
that you know very well, the English

00:08:14.002 --> 00:08:21.562
language itself is very ego orientated,
I think, and it keeps your ego down, like

00:08:21.562 --> 00:08:28.022
the other day we were coming by
plane, and one of the air hostess, she just

00:08:28.022 --> 00:08:34.082
announced that those who are going
further to Nepal, please consult the people

00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:38.662
down, she had to say down below, she
missed the below point, and everybody

00:08:38.662 --> 00:08:42.442
started laughing at her and making
fun of her as if she was the greatest fool

00:08:42.442 --> 00:08:47.282
ever born, you see, but now these air
hostess must be knowing at least three or

00:08:47.282 --> 00:08:54.042
four languages, plus languages of
this country, while the people who are

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:58.582
supposed to be English speaking only
know English, nothing more, and the French

00:08:58.582 --> 00:09:01.782
think they know their own language, so
they don't know any other language but

00:09:01.782 --> 00:09:02.182
French.

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:09.742
So it is important to understand that
when we have a ego orientated personality,

00:09:10.022 --> 00:09:16.022
it is better not to listen to words,
but better to have the contents without

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:19.702
the words there, is a better
idea, it will work out better.

00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:24.302
So again, I hope by My speech I
have not again given a push to your

00:09:24.302 --> 00:09:30.502
egos by any chance; Try to keep it down,
and see that this ego business, which

00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:34.802
is our enemy, absolutely it is our
enemy, that we have acquired through our

00:09:34.802 --> 00:09:39.982
different systems, we know that, and
so we must try to keep it down as much

00:09:39.982 --> 00:09:43.022
as we can, and you'll enjoy
the Hindi speech, all right?

00:09:46.232 --> 00:09:53.548
Now I have praised you very loudly, so whether
this is true or not, it is a matter to know.

00:09:53.526 --> 00:10:00.392
This ego is no less in our human beings, we become
egoistic about every useless thing.

00:10:00.426 --> 00:10:04.017
And these are such useless stuff,
sticking out like this that

00:10:04.042 --> 00:10:12.026
even though we know it's the most stupid
thing, we keep doing it.

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:18.825
Sahaja Yoga shows you the truth,
the truth that is, was and will remain.

00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:26.051
In it’s case no one can compromise,

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:32.048
that you may say, "Come on, Mother! Why don't you
just say that so that the work gets materialized?

00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:36.245
If you say this way, it will be good,
say it that way;

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:41.590
It will be good; Nothing
such is true, whatever is, so it is. That will

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:47.530
Remain like this, and if you are not willing to
believe the truth, you will have to suffer it.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:52.570
Means, it is not that the truth harms you,
but if you let go the truth

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.930
then you come down to untruth and
when you come down to untruth, then untruth is a

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.026
harmful factor, it will hurt you.

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:03.526
It has so happened that in
Sahaja Yoga many people

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:09.120
Came, achieved heights, had big gains,
got a lot; transcended

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.800
many and after that they left Sahaja Yoga, and after
that by themselves came after years that Mother!

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.120
I've got this disease, what do I do now?
There are many such people,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.720
hey started saying that Sahaja Yoga
has punished us; Sahaja yoga did not punish

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.580
But if you are sitting under someone's
umbrella and you leave him and

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.800
go out and if it rains on you,
what will you say, that this shelter

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.220
gave you sufferance; You only
wiped off your canopy and went out. But being in

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:43.060
Sahaja Yoga, it’s canopy if has
sheltered you then this is its

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:49.950
In fact obligation upon you, instead
that it be your obligation on that canopy.

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:56.133
This is the obligation of that canopy, great obligation
that it sought you and kept you within its fold.

00:11:56.157 --> 00:12:01.688
And cared for your micro needs.

00:12:01.716 --> 00:12:06.255
There are many things that are
found in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:12.810
Out of that, as I told you, the prasad of
Lakshmi also remains for you and

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:17.990
I also told you that Shri Lakshmi Ji
resides in the navel chakra.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.810
The power of Shri Lakshmi resides there in;
And I also told you how Lakshmi ji is.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:29.270
I told you that there is a great difference
between Lakshmi ji and those who have money. Lakshmi ji

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.690
standing on a lotus, she has a lotus in her
one hand and the other hand is giver of

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:41.650
Shelter. Lakshmi ji is standing on the lotus;
In looks, She is quite heavy,

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:46.830
You must have not ever seen Lakshmi ji
like today's beauty queens?

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:54.070
but Her health is very good
because they have a lot of

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:59.510
water inside them, they were born out of water,
were they not? The one who is born from water,

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:03.330
She has to have a lot of water inside
This too has a reason, if she

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.950
water inside Her, then for the movement of these
Chakras, there being no buffer, no hurdles in between;

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:13.090
There being No safety left, so
presence of water in body is

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.030
Necessary. And for this there is less noise
and even then

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:28.210
so standing on the lotus,

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:34.570
as if there seems no word in
Hindi, but one should say that she is adorned or well

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:40.130
Even by balance and no weight is put on the

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.950
lotus, and doesn’t lay her weight on lotus; That is
she does not put her burden on anyone.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:50.510
You see how much burden people
put on others; Now, as if a guest has come,

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:56.630
and our people, especially Sahaja yogis,
sometimes do such a thing,

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:04.830
sometimes a specialty of Hindustani Sahajayogi also do it.
As if you have come from somewhere, now you have
come to Delhi,

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:09.250
then he will first say, "Sir, we are not getting

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.621
any rest here."

00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:12.988
And I can't find enough food here.

00:14:13.038 --> 00:14:15.571
It's not a good arrangement here.

00:14:15.655 --> 00:14:22.621
That arrangement is not right, like in their house, these
people look absolutely luxurious habitually.

00:14:22.646 --> 00:14:26.890
As soon as you come here, everyone
knows that this thing is not right here.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:32.950
So-and-so is not good here. If someone
comes to Mumbai, it is the same for them. It means

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:38.190
you remain a thorn; everywhere
you don’t behave

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:42.630
like a flower, like a thorn you remain
biting; Everywhere, everyone should

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.530
feel that you have come from somewhere, you
are something special. You

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:51.997
must have some speciality.

00:14:52.048 --> 00:14:55.414
In this we think that we have made our life

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.040
something very important.
And the man, who got more money

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:06.600
he pretends more; The more a man is
poor, the less his tantrums in their country,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.600
but as much as a man gets rich,
the more his tantrums and

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:17.800
Lakshmi ji's tantrums, She somehow
keeps standing on Lotus

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.040
all the time; never says ‘Bhai! I’m tired.’ For some time

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.620
I may lay down’. All the time, balancing her
gorgeous body keeps

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:33.840
Standing, absolutely lightly that
no one feels; This is untarnishable

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:40.480
example of Lakshmi. The man who has
real Lakshmi never feels heavy any where.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.578
Such a person, wherever he lives his

00:15:45.579 --> 00:15:49.615
fragrance, his aroma spreads far and wide but

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:55.100
Its not reflected from his any gestures;
He doesn’t show off to you.

00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:58.909
Whether you have money or you don't

00:15:58.943 --> 00:16:02.609
Or he has more money, or what you lack.

00:16:02.643 --> 00:16:09.076
He lives in such a way that no one knows
When how he came and how went away.

00:16:09.126 --> 00:16:14.876
He spends life like someone
That no one knows; but mostly

00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:20.220
People with more money, first boost
that Sir, I am so rich; and if not the at least

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.520
Will keep playing strange horns on the way,
so that they turn and see that

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:31.480
who donkey is coming. Everything
must be shown off; everything

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:36.580
Has an imitation for it. He brings all
games in his name because he is

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:42.620
wealthy. It is not a question of Lakshmi ji,
Lakshmi ji lives in such a way,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:48.110
controlled and balanced that no-one knows;
Then with one hand

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:52.890
they should donate, that donation also
no one must know that its donation.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.450
Its just flowing, its going, its being given;
No question of taking and from other hand

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:03.030
there should be shelter for those who are
dependent on them. All should be blessed instead

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:06.770
That many kick, beat, do this and
that to their servants; not this.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:13.089
Dependent, that is, those who are
completely dependent on Lakshmi ji.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:19.663
a complete hand, looks full of boon
And they have lotus in their both hands.

00:17:19.688 --> 00:17:27.604
Lotus are pink in color and
Pink color signifies love; This pink color is

00:17:27.638 --> 00:17:35.130
a sign of their Preet, pink color represents
her love. She absolutely in

00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:38.466
her delicate petals

00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:43.891
gives place to a creature with
thorns like a whirlpool.

00:17:43.925 --> 00:17:48.750
may come from anywhere, there remains
arrangements for him to stay, all the time for him

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.530
There is arrangement. I haven’t seen
any such rich that on their door if anyone

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.610
comes, then said good brother, you don’t
have a place, come at my place, sleep here.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.890
He will instead keep four guards, four security;
Even if there is some gentleman then

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:07.360
They will beat him out. So the element of
Lakshmi, inside us, is

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.200
in naval ‘Nabhi’ Chakra, about which
I told you. It is,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.080
as it is, we can not become that element
You change everything that of

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:22.160
outside, but that element remain as
it is, neither the element can be changed nor

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.300
You can direct it and neither
you can fight with it.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.740
That element is made as such element,
If you have to stay on the element and

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:38.180
you have to be honest, then
you should know that what is true will

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.740
remain the truth; You can't change
that. Now many people say

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:48.360
What happened mother If our money is
black money, so what; Here we have built

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.976
huge buildings here for the poor and
we have built many temples.

00:18:51.977 --> 00:18:58.401
And we built many temples and

00:18:58.426 --> 00:19:01.140
so the thing is that for the poor people

00:19:01.176 --> 00:19:06.992
[IN AUDIBLE]

00:19:07.025 --> 00:19:09.351
It is God's job to build a temple.

00:19:09.376 --> 00:19:15.023
This is man's work; What is the
benefit of building a temple?

00:19:15.074 --> 00:19:20.223
That’s visible to you. Put four men there; Whatever
they will extort from whoever comes,

00:19:20.257 --> 00:19:25.507
they will take and eat it and say,
“ Sahab now do worship.”

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:31.920
Temples should also have Brahmins;
Brahmins, that is who has known Brahma, who is reborn

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.880
who is realized is Brahmin. Nowadays In which
temple such a Brahmin is sitting.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:42.560
On the contrary, I see all are demons,
so horrid

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:48.280
absolutely monsters; Wherever you go, there is
sting, beating, greed, all kinds of dirt. And

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.820
inferior things except this know
nothing; They, in any way,

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:58.100
cannot be Brahmins. The real Brahmin is
the one who is a realized soul; only he should be

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.860
called a Brahmin., who is reborn ‘Dvij’;
Now the challenge for Brahmin is

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:09.474
if they want the uplift of Brahmins then go and tell
them: Look, you are defaming the name of Brahmins

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:14.840
You are not Brahmins; You can not
be Brahmin as the Brahmin is that who has

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:20.280
attained the Brahma tatva of God, Brahma tatva
is flowing within him, he only is

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:26.220
self Brahmin and none the else; This will cause
a great deal of harm to the entire caste.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:33.820
And all the caste will be infamous. Now, to know
this element that in Lakshmi Tatwa

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:40.400
what mistakes we commit, let me explain
a little bit to you. Lakshmi element, that is

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.080
all around it is spread the principle of religion; and
this element of religion, the ten Gurus have

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.500
262
bestowed on us. It is that so far
we say that the main ten

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:55.420
Gurus that we had, it does not mean that
These ten Gurus that were

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.080
the only happening and no one has happened;
but these main Ten Gurus, in Sahaja Yoga

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:04.575
we recognize which starting from Adi Nath

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:09.036
And to Socrates and

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.856
From Lautse to King Janak, Nanak, Mausa

00:21:14.873 --> 00:21:18.206
And many such other these ten are

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.160
there whom we recognize, who we
believe have become immortal.

00:21:22.177 --> 00:21:27.160
Joraster, all these are the descents of

00:21:27.193 --> 00:21:30.585
the same Guru element, one of the same.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:36.820
Now it should be kept in mind
how in the Lakshmi element,

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.360
we mess in. Its necessary why is there
no Lakshmi in our country; many people

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.760
Ask me Ram Chandra left what vibrations in
your country; Vibrations that

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:53.427
He left must be in your Lakshmi Tatwa,
you all will see the reason of it; The first reason is that

00:21:53.461 --> 00:21:57.061
Wherever you have Bhoot Vidya, Phantom Vidya,
Samshan Vidya

00:21:57.078 --> 00:22:01.827
and Tantric Vidya, if you run

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:06.453
any of these knowledge,
then Lakshmi Ji will go from there.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:14.486
Immediately Lakshmi ji will leave.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:21.000
If you run any Vidya, run Tantra Vidya;
That is, any ghost knowledge,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.860
If you use any of these knowledge,
then your Lakshmi power

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.300
will end. As told to you, one Sahab
used to visit us.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:37.660
He had a shop and that shop was not running
at all; then I said, “Ok! Bring

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.000
your wife. When
he came with his wife, saw that his house-wife
[Graha Lakshmi ] had

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.520
absolutely ghostly looks, so filthy thoughts
were running inside her. I asked her

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.940
whom do you visit, do you go to
some tantric? She said no, not to Tantric,

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.400
but he is our Guru. I Said,
“ Ok! What does your Guru do?” And

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.640
when she told us what all he told
them to do; I said Baba re Baba,

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:06.140
he is a solid tantric and that's why the woman
got in clutches. । then removed those peepers

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:10.880
that were offered on him. After
that the man flourished so much,

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.020
Flourished so much that he himself was astonished
that the people who never came to our shop

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.000
started coming and like this Lakshmi ji
started coming. Now

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.980
see where all is more poverty
in your country; Kerala, I have

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:31.800
Been to; I was very surprised that
In Kerala, in house only people

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.676
burry all dead; Where they die,
they bury them.

00:23:36.726 --> 00:23:41.976
Where is the need of going far away,
buried there itself, work finished.

00:23:41.993 --> 00:23:47.426
No! the voice is coming, yes!

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:52.918
Ok!

00:23:52.952 --> 00:23:58.201
Now, now the voice is coming, now

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.518
this phantom lore and this samshan vidya

00:24:01.283 --> 00:24:05.590
And there is also a difference
in such death,

00:24:05.623 --> 00:24:13.503
means that the man who
dies should be properly burried.

00:24:13.503 --> 00:24:15.172
Even otherwise there
is no need to burry

00:24:15.196 --> 00:24:17.123
anybody; but yes, if
some has become a saint

00:24:17.123 --> 00:24:22.563
Saint means not that who worships
and who, wearing

00:24:22.623 --> 00:24:25.361
saffron clothes wanders here
and there, not that; the one

00:24:25.385 --> 00:24:28.123
who gets realised, who is
transcended; the one who has

00:24:28.123 --> 00:24:30.965
become a saint,
which has transcended,

00:24:30.989 --> 00:24:33.523
is not burnt. He is never burnt.

00:24:33.523 --> 00:24:38.163
That is called samadhi.
They can be in the tomb. Here,

00:24:38.163 --> 00:24:42.313
wherever see all tombs
of this and that are seen.

00:24:42.313 --> 00:24:47.568
And when a man dies, who
is not realized, then it is better to

00:24:47.593 --> 00:24:51.713
burn that so that all
the negativities, in him,

00:24:51.713 --> 00:24:55.593
get cleared and in a way, he gets born
once again,

00:24:55.653 --> 00:24:58.021
it becomes complete
cleansed because you know

00:24:58.045 --> 00:25:00.413
that you have a special
characteristic that

00:25:00.413 --> 00:25:05.833
can purify even 'Kanchan',
means Gold. So such man

00:25:05.833 --> 00:25:10.873
must be burnt, straight way;
But people bury him at home.

00:25:10.873 --> 00:25:14.493
When we went there in the rural, I said
where did you bring here among ghosts,

00:25:14.493 --> 00:25:17.372
Complete creamation
city is totally creamation

00:25:17.396 --> 00:25:19.953
ground. Then asked
how; I said here all

00:25:19.953 --> 00:25:24.073
dead are burried, I see; When they
were asked, said yes! here since thousands

00:25:24.073 --> 00:25:28.373
years its prevalent; I said 'Aye',
what you burry in home only. Then

00:25:28.373 --> 00:25:32.690
came to know that once

00:25:32.707 --> 00:25:36.789
Shankaracharya, Adi-Shankaracharya,
that too disciple principle,

00:25:36.813 --> 00:25:43.730
He is a big personality, refused them that

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.528
your mother, you can not

00:25:46.553 --> 00:25:52.033
burn, you can't burn mother.
Then he used banayan leaves,

00:25:52.033 --> 00:25:55.533
tree to burned his mother.
Then he cursed them that you

00:25:55.533 --> 00:26:00.853
too will not get any thing to
burn and in your homes only

00:26:00.853 --> 00:26:02.927
you will have to
burry. But for that curse

00:26:02.951 --> 00:26:05.433
became very heavy, then
these people started to

00:26:05.433 --> 00:26:12.493
bury it in the house. So for the curse
and the abundance of burrial land

00:26:12.493 --> 00:26:18.333
there it is difficult to eradicate poverty;
though we went and tried hard there

00:26:18.333 --> 00:26:23.013
for this and made people understand
not to burry in homes but outside and

00:26:23.013 --> 00:26:27.113
Here, poverty did not get eradicated.

00:26:27.151 --> 00:26:32.749
The second thing is
where humans for laziness

00:26:32.773 --> 00:26:40.043
only turns, poverty sets in there; Lazy
people, means most lazy people are in this

00:26:40.043 --> 00:26:43.005
in this Bengal region. You won't
find more lazy person any where

00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:45.943
else. I used to think earlier
that the people of Lucknow are

00:26:45.943 --> 00:26:49.561
the most lazy.
When my in-laws are

00:26:49.585 --> 00:26:53.203
in Lucknow, I saw that their Sun

00:26:53.203 --> 00:26:56.036
rises at 11'o clock; What will
happen to them; I am from Maharashtra

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.723
and I'm habitual of getting up
at 4 am, i am from Maharashtra.

00:26:58.723 --> 00:27:01.557
In Maharashtra, the
poor people take out food

00:27:01.581 --> 00:27:04.803
from the stone, they need
labor hard with stones.

00:27:04.803 --> 00:27:11.363
There poor people getup at four
to work hard. People from UP

00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:14.021
I have seen, are very lazy, most

00:27:14.045 --> 00:27:16.703
lazy, but when I visited Bengal

00:27:16.703 --> 00:27:19.736
I said that such won't
be found anywhere.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.793
Now that I went to
London, I think that

00:27:22.793 --> 00:27:25.847
the most lazy are
English people. They

00:27:25.871 --> 00:27:29.423
are the laziest people.
Now in Hindi that

00:27:29.423 --> 00:27:36.825
I speak, there is no harm in telling.

00:27:36.922 --> 00:27:38.625
You won't believe that these

00:27:38.653 --> 00:27:40.971
people wash their faces in the

00:27:40.995 --> 00:27:43.313
night itself before sleeping and

00:27:43.313 --> 00:27:49.313
there are also those who haven't
had bath for a year. Muslims

00:27:49.313 --> 00:27:55.073
at least take bath every Friday; They
are above them, full one year and there

00:27:55.073 --> 00:28:00.673
if you made some one get up in
the morning at around 9/10 O'clock

00:28:00.673 --> 00:28:03.331
then is no sinner, wicked,

00:28:03.355 --> 00:28:06.013
demon more than you. Means

00:28:06.013 --> 00:28:10.193
that there is no sin bigger than that.

00:28:10.193 --> 00:28:12.682
And for getting up before
10 O'clock, meaning

00:28:12.706 --> 00:28:15.592
before 12 O'clock it's
extremely difficult thing.

00:28:15.592 --> 00:28:17.579
But for job what could you do?

00:28:17.652 --> 00:28:23.162
So as you sleep in bed, get up,
get into jeans and reaching office

00:28:23.212 --> 00:28:27.142
go to the bathroom, do everything
there, bathing is no question to you.

00:28:27.166 --> 00:28:35.128
Only brushing is need, so did at night.

00:28:35.162 --> 00:28:38.583
And Indians are just the
opposite; Every morning they

00:28:38.607 --> 00:28:42.028
will bath in the morning
and will get out in that cold,

00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:44.476
after that they may get
cancer; And if ask them,"

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.278
Brother take bath at night,
brush it in the morning",

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:49.522
Mother, you are
saying that; I said," yes!

00:28:49.546 --> 00:28:52.133
Brother, I am saying
the same and do like that.

00:28:52.231 --> 00:28:54.357
Then they said." How
about you." I said,"

00:28:54.381 --> 00:28:56.400
I don't move out,
I remain indoors."

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.715
So for me, my issue is
different, now nothing is

00:28:58.739 --> 00:29:01.400
going to happen to me
but it is fine for you in such

00:29:01.433 --> 00:29:03.340
cool winter here that you get

00:29:03.364 --> 00:29:05.271
up to take bath in the morning.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.138
And then you should bath in cold water
after that you go out.

00:29:09.163 --> 00:29:11.120
Even otherwise It is a very
wrong thing to take bath

00:29:11.144 --> 00:29:13.063
in hot water and then
move out., no matter here.

00:29:13.063 --> 00:29:18.223
उसके बाद हमेशा ठंडे पानी से One
should take a bath, always take bath with

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:24.342
Even later on also bath with cold
water, then you won't ever get cold etc.

00:29:24.383 --> 00:29:28.923
Now this is a little thing but but to
do that is also quite difficult for them

00:29:28.923 --> 00:29:33.603
They are so lazy and are always so
tired that now these people came here

00:29:33.603 --> 00:29:36.271
They will keep
lying for whole day

00:29:36.295 --> 00:29:38.963
long and sleep,
eat whole day and

00:29:38.963 --> 00:29:40.212
when asked in the evening; What

00:29:40.236 --> 00:29:41.403
brother, we have got tired!.

00:29:41.903 --> 00:29:43.350
What did you do?

00:29:43.383 --> 00:29:50.616
If they get tired of sleeping, then
how will they be, only God knows?

00:29:50.263 --> 00:29:56.323
But laziness is also too much in our
country and so do are the ways to avoid it.

00:29:56.323 --> 00:29:59.267
There are so many [more
than 2500- 'pachis sau']

00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:02.173
labor saving devices,
just ask the Bengalis.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:05.323
Ask, this is the condition
of Bengali people

00:30:05.353 --> 00:30:11.993
If you to buy something then buy by
12 noon; see from 12 to 3 in afternoon

00:30:11.993 --> 00:30:14.273
all the shops are closed.
The lock is installed,

00:30:14.297 --> 00:30:16.333
and you will hear the
snores from inside.

00:30:16.333 --> 00:30:18.504
and that even upto
5 in evening the

00:30:18.528 --> 00:30:21.213
shops do not open,
that is 12 O'clock to

00:30:21.213 --> 00:30:25.273
five o'clock no shop opens.
So, there are many such shops

00:30:25.273 --> 00:30:30.733
that do not open upto 12 O'clock, no
matter what you have to buy and second

00:30:30.733 --> 00:30:35.853
thing is that they are so engrossed
in laziness that they, for this,

00:30:35.853 --> 00:30:41.433
do not understand that there is any other
world because when you are short of time

00:30:41.433 --> 00:30:44.584
what will you see to others,
what will you understand

00:30:44.608 --> 00:30:47.333
from others, what can
you learn from others?

00:30:47.333 --> 00:30:51.173
They do not know if there is also any other
world; As for them, 'We are the only one'.

00:30:51.173 --> 00:30:56.253
We are everything. Great region like Bengal
where such accomplishments have happened.

00:30:57.153 --> 00:31:02.673
Goddess has done how many deeds but
today Tantriks have ruined for their alms.

00:31:02.673 --> 00:31:05.319
The tantrics have
absolutely taken control over

00:31:05.343 --> 00:31:07.873
there; they have so
controlled because lazy

00:31:07.873 --> 00:31:09.977
People have no other
business except for going and

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:12.493
asking their future; Brother,
when there is nothing to do

00:31:12.493 --> 00:31:14.576
you will show your
hand to know what's

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.193
there? This way great
Tantriks gathered there

00:31:17.193 --> 00:31:21.833
who keep on telling that this will happen
to you, your father will die then you

00:31:21.833 --> 00:31:24.256
then you are going to get
a lot of money and then you

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.702
will have an accident and
you will have lot of money.

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:29.019
and like this such people [NOT CLEAR]

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:31.366
And for this reason, at

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.702
such places, no money

00:31:33.727 --> 00:31:34.957
should be given. But
what is not always earning

00:31:34.981 --> 00:31:36.427
hard. But whatever it is,
hard work is always earned.

00:31:36.452 --> 00:31:40.261
When Lakshmi ji
came into the world,

00:31:40.285 --> 00:31:44.093
then you know
Deities & devons all

00:31:44.093 --> 00:31:49.233
laboured together then only Lakshmi
ji came in the world.

00:31:49.233 --> 00:31:54.690
Then who don't labor, for them
Lakshmi if at all comes, goes waste.

00:31:54.715 --> 00:31:57.412
As some rich accumulate
money for all their

00:31:57.436 --> 00:32:00.648
children, and for the
sake of donations will not

00:32:00.673 --> 00:32:05.893
give a penny, not there; Buy
jwels, this and that for children

00:32:05.893 --> 00:32:09.753
When the father died, they
will busy managing to least spent

00:32:09.753 --> 00:32:13.253
on performing the last
rites. Its better to throw them

00:32:13.253 --> 00:32:18.493
in the sea. No, its alright; gone once
for all. Then by taking such money

00:32:18.493 --> 00:32:21.027
all kinds of filth gets

00:32:21.051 --> 00:32:24.693
adicted; free money for no labor

00:32:24.693 --> 00:32:29.013
if some human gets, it's not
valued and for this Sahaj Yoga

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:30.996
also is not valued.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.823
Specially in Hindustan because
these people have not to work very

00:32:33.847 --> 00:32:36.596
hard but these poor people,
outside, need to labor very hard.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.234
Therefore, they vlaue
it. You get it instantly

00:32:39.258 --> 00:32:41.513
as you are born on
this virtuous land.

00:32:41.553 --> 00:32:45.456
Your mother is very
much kind on you,

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.383
means it's not me,
your 'Bharat Bhumi'.

00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:52.090
So you get a lot with
her help and even

00:32:52.114 --> 00:32:55.300
after that you have
no appreciation for her.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.767
This is absolutely correct.

00:32:57.803 --> 00:33:00.051
Why our UP people so lazy,

00:33:00.075 --> 00:33:02.323
the reason is that in UP

00:33:02.323 --> 00:33:09.583
Ganga and Jamuna have given so much
boon that the land over there is so good

00:33:09.583 --> 00:33:13.444
Land is so productive
that you put only

00:33:13.468 --> 00:33:17.328
seeds in the ground,
it will come out.

00:33:17.353 --> 00:33:21.047
And because of this
people there are excessively

00:33:21.071 --> 00:33:24.607
lazy because there is
no need to labor hard.

00:33:24.641 --> 00:33:27.248
You say anything,
let's go like a bit and have a walk, would

00:33:27.273 --> 00:33:30.137
say," Just have a seat,
only now have come."

00:33:30.161 --> 00:33:33.493
Whole day long this will
go on. One Sahab came to

00:33:33.493 --> 00:33:35.428
Lucknow, started
saying that we said that

00:33:35.452 --> 00:33:37.873
haven't you to go to
Puna, your sister is there.

00:33:37.873 --> 00:33:39.302
Starting to say, had
to go, but its quite

00:33:39.326 --> 00:33:40.971
difficult. I said what
difficult it is Sahab,

00:33:41.038 --> 00:33:43.414
I will get you the
ticket and if you

00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:45.813
so want will get you
[Bhoomi-UNCLEAR]

00:33:45.813 --> 00:33:51.193
He started saying that if feel cold,
now open the bedding, take out quilt.

00:33:51.193 --> 00:33:53.988
If its not hinderance then what?

00:33:54.013 --> 00:33:56.885
There are a descriptions
of each one of the

00:33:56.909 --> 00:34:00.193
lazy, although we also
saw, but description is

00:34:00.193 --> 00:34:02.826
that once it was asked that

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.973
whosoever the laziest among you

00:34:05.973 --> 00:34:08.491
come a step forward; most of

00:34:08.515 --> 00:34:11.033
the lazy were got seated, one

00:34:11.033 --> 00:34:13.081
was left behind; He was
asked why you did not

00:34:13.105 --> 00:34:15.153
come forward; replied
who to take that headache

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:21.281
to come forward.

00:34:21.315 --> 00:34:25.049
This description of laziness

00:34:25.073 --> 00:34:30.413
begins the rule of the house; That's why

00:34:30.413 --> 00:34:34.661
these are UP people, there in
none other more reprover than them.

00:34:34.685 --> 00:34:36.093
You see

00:34:36.093 --> 00:34:38.484
what I am saying is
true or not; when ever

00:34:38.508 --> 00:34:41.193
you talk to the people
of UP, then understand

00:34:41.193 --> 00:34:43.501
that there will be
politics in this. Yes! Its

00:34:43.525 --> 00:34:45.833
different in Sahaj
Yoga; Now that politics

00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:48.181
that the message will
pass from here to there

00:34:48.205 --> 00:34:50.928
and you kept sitting;
Yes, they said this for us.

00:34:50.953 --> 00:34:53.851
Said yes, 'Bhai' it was so said to us;

00:34:53.875 --> 00:34:56.773
and this created
enemity between us.

00:34:56.773 --> 00:34:59.271
Dispute happens,
groupism begins. And the

00:34:59.295 --> 00:35:01.793
reason is that there
is too much time. You

00:35:01.793 --> 00:35:03.531
have no labor to do; your mother

00:35:03.555 --> 00:35:05.293
is giving free, you are eating

00:35:05.293 --> 00:35:07.166
and drinking. The one who has

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:09.453
time does all this
and in its case

00:35:09.453 --> 00:35:12.401
the people are so
cautious and they are

00:35:12.425 --> 00:35:15.373
so proud in this
matter that you get

00:35:15.373 --> 00:35:17.781
so surprised. They are
not concerned of their

00:35:17.805 --> 00:35:20.213
poverty. Our one of the
servants was from UP,

00:35:20.213 --> 00:35:23.373
very dirty, and used
to do dirty dishes.

00:35:23.397 --> 00:35:26.313
Sahab came from
Madras, I said see

00:35:26.313 --> 00:35:28.146
you are so dirty,
all these Madrasis

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.373
will become servants
and all of you guys

00:35:30.373 --> 00:35:33.641
will ousted of your
job, you people should

00:35:33.665 --> 00:35:36.933
work hard; said,' see
what labor we will do,

00:35:36.933 --> 00:35:39.613
just keep those servants.
Now we are going to rule.

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:42.693
We said to them," Wah Bhai
Wah".[ Appreciable]. They all

00:35:42.693 --> 00:35:45.332
are ruling; Those
brain calculations

00:35:45.356 --> 00:35:47.313
happen more there, where

00:35:47.313 --> 00:35:50.611
every thing one gets easily and where

00:35:50.635 --> 00:35:53.933
you have to do labor;
Punjab is a good

00:35:53.933 --> 00:35:56.481
land but there is
all the time there

00:35:56.505 --> 00:35:59.053
are external
problems. All the time

00:35:59.053 --> 00:36:04.813
outside people keep coming to Punjab. Those
human beings won't labor here, if Laxmi ji

00:36:04.813 --> 00:36:08.221
stays, then we may listen what you say.

00:36:08.345 --> 00:36:11.853
We have seen such
families where in coins

00:36:11.887 --> 00:36:14.196
used to be abundant,
and were counted

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.336
by stick as you measure Petrol,

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.187
as to how much inches
is left out and today the

00:36:19.211 --> 00:36:22.028
status is that you may
search all then except for

00:36:22.053 --> 00:36:24.183
dust there is nothing. Lot many

00:36:24.207 --> 00:36:26.336
families extinguished; and alike

00:36:26.403 --> 00:36:29.869
laziness is detrimental to Sahaj Yoga.

00:36:29.888 --> 00:36:32.002
So, for any Sahaj Yogi laziness

00:36:32.036 --> 00:36:38.959
I say that for Sahaj Yogi
laziness is his worst enemy.

00:36:38.983 --> 00:36:44.469
So it is said that there
is still time and when you

00:36:44.493 --> 00:36:47.393
you get into laziness,
your 'Navel chakra' will

00:36:47.417 --> 00:36:50.633
get caught; Now I told
you that for 'Naval Chakra'

00:36:50.633 --> 00:36:55.721
to be in order a person must be active,
should wake up early in the morning

00:36:55.745 --> 00:36:57.433
and in the morning

00:36:57.433 --> 00:36:59.731
whatever Sahaj Yoga
work is to be done and only

00:36:59.755 --> 00:37:02.053
after finishing it active
in your daily routines.

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:07.213
Sahaj yoga teaches so many things,
teaches so many things that you will be

00:37:07.213 --> 00:37:12.273
surprised. We had people in London for whom
it was difficult to wake up early, but now

00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:14.891
they get up at 4
o'clock, bathe, and sit for

00:37:14.915 --> 00:37:17.533
meditation; they
themselves are surprised.

00:37:17.533 --> 00:37:21.873
I asked them how they did it; they say that
their Mother! you wake us up at 4 o'clock,

00:37:21.873 --> 00:37:26.133
Said Mother! You wake us up and we
get up early. So long as in our country

00:37:26.133 --> 00:37:29.442
this activeness does not
inculcates; poverty can’t be

00:37:29.466 --> 00:37:33.413
eradicated from this country
by crying, shouting and begging.

00:37:33.413 --> 00:37:37.793
Begging is the worst
thing; I say it's better that

00:37:37.793 --> 00:37:43.193
the country might starve and die,
but what's the need to beg from others?

00:37:43.193 --> 00:37:48.013
Rather I say there is nothing more malign
and worst thing; it's better

00:37:48.013 --> 00:37:52.773
we might die, but it's okay; it's better
than begging from others countries.

00:37:52.773 --> 00:37:54.590
Is there any shortage of
anything in our Country;

00:37:54.614 --> 00:37:56.241
If there is any short
fall of any thing in

00:37:56.265 --> 00:37:57.413
your country,

00:37:57.413 --> 00:38:01.033
You see, then to
approach other country I feel

00:38:01.033 --> 00:38:05.773
What do they have except for plastic?
a gentleman came to our house and said

00:38:05.773 --> 00:38:07.992
visit our house and
said, "It's very important;

00:38:08.016 --> 00:38:09.993
we have an Indian
artefact." Didn’t know

00:38:09.993 --> 00:38:16.213
what strange it was? We drove us 50 miles;
And what did he show

00:38:16.213 --> 00:38:22.653
a Moradabadi Goglet was kept in his home.
Our daughter asked, "Mom, what is it?"

00:38:22.653 --> 00:38:25.151
He has bored; He asked,
“ What did she say, what is

00:38:25.175 --> 00:38:27.673
she saying?” I said,” No,
she is appreciating you

00:38:27.673 --> 00:38:32.273
that you brought this Muradabadi
Goglet. He said, "This is absolutely

00:38:32.273 --> 00:38:34.880
authentic." I said, "Good,
what's so authentic?"

00:38:34.904 --> 00:38:37.233
He said, "This is a
very old vase"; I got

00:38:37.233 --> 00:38:43.053
reminded of Premchand ji's story that was
nicely written on big round bowl [ ‘Lota’]

00:38:43.053 --> 00:38:49.273
I recollected the same that this
person took us 50 miles to show us a

00:38:49.273 --> 00:38:52.401
Goglet from Moradabad
because at there place

00:38:52.425 --> 00:38:55.553
Brass sells at Gold
prices. At there place,

00:38:55.553 --> 00:39:01.173
If someone wears a cotton cloth, they
become like a king; cotton, handmade, Oh

00:39:01.173 --> 00:39:03.373
Oh My God, what’s
this, at our place people

00:39:03.397 --> 00:39:05.913
think that thing bought
from the market is more

00:39:05.913 --> 00:39:08.731
better, readymade is more
expensive; they don't believe

00:39:08.755 --> 00:39:11.573
it. At our place, if we say
that we have cotton cloth,

00:39:11.573 --> 00:39:13.592
That we get so much
cotton cloth, started

00:39:13.616 --> 00:39:16.093
saying, "Is it, you get
so much cotton, so, then

00:39:16.093 --> 00:39:19.164
You're a rich person",
they said; I said that we are

00:39:19.188 --> 00:39:22.258
but think as we don't have
transistor, so we'r poor.

00:39:22.283 --> 00:39:24.155
Started saying people there
are fools; I said,” Absolutely, they

00:39:24.179 --> 00:39:26.050
are totally foolish.” useless
things when they have everything?"

00:39:26.075 --> 00:39:28.768
‘Are’ who has all the
things and he runs

00:39:28.792 --> 00:39:32.039
after wasteful things,
what he must be called?

00:39:32.068 --> 00:39:36.308
AS we had been to Germany then
all told us that in Germany,

00:39:36.333 --> 00:39:38.051
Very good stainless
steel is available, do bring

00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:39.793
one piece for each one
of us. It was long ago,

00:39:39.793 --> 00:39:46.853
around 65 years earlier; So I told
to the lady who was with us that

00:39:46.853 --> 00:39:50.598
we have to buy some stainless steel;
She asked, "What did you say, stainless

00:39:50.622 --> 00:39:51.862
steel?" I said, "Yes.”

00:39:51.887 --> 00:39:53.988
Started saying," Although
you look royal, why

00:39:54.012 --> 00:39:56.113
are you buying
stainless steel?” I said our

00:39:56.113 --> 00:39:58.141
relatives are habitual
of using Stainless steel.

00:39:58.165 --> 00:39:59.933
She said, " I have
heard that you people

00:39:59.933 --> 00:40:02.298
eat in brass vessels"; I said, “
Yes, by all means we do eat in

00:40:02.322 --> 00:40:04.879
brass.” Then said for whom you
are taking this worthless stainless

00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:06.543
stainless steel.

00:40:06.543 --> 00:40:08.975
At our place beggars
eat in stainless

00:40:08.999 --> 00:40:12.043
steel. At our place If
someone becomes rich,

00:40:12.043 --> 00:40:15.243
they proudly keep stainless steel vessels,
as if what they have

00:40:15.243 --> 00:40:20.763
achieved. Our values have become so
low that we have become useless or

00:40:20.763 --> 00:40:23.502
that we're poor; I don’t
understand if we are really

00:40:23.526 --> 00:40:26.103
so poor? You come to
India, and we'll make you

00:40:26.103 --> 00:40:28.999
ill by feeding you so
much that if we don’t

00:40:29.023 --> 00:40:31.919
make you sick within
two days, then you say!

00:40:31.953 --> 00:40:36.663
I got worried; I say I'm Mata ji, and
I'll also start fasting like them.

00:40:36.663 --> 00:40:40.263
But I tell everyone not to fast; Then
It will come on me. And in fact

00:40:40.263 --> 00:40:45.363
any one is to fast, that’s me. As
they are all after me saying ,

00:40:45.363 --> 00:40:49.583
"Eat this, eat that"; it's like when a new
groom comes, and they put lot of food in

00:40:49.583 --> 00:40:53.923
his mouth. Same is my condition, who will say that
there's poverty in this house? Now, these foreigners...

00:40:53.923 --> 00:40:57.673
are coming, they say they eat a lot in the morning, they
eat a lot during the day, they eat a lot in the evening.

00:40:57.733 --> 00:41:00.240
It's not visible anywhere
that there's poverty here.

00:41:00.298 --> 00:41:04.064
What kind of calamity has come
that you eat in a brass plate?

00:41:04.115 --> 00:41:07.347
People say that they
took us to show them...

00:41:07.365 --> 00:41:10.086
They start saying, "Look, this
is the house, you can also make

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.741
an ashram, but don't use
cement in it." That's for them...

00:41:13.014 --> 00:41:15.539
Its rubbish. Cement is
rubbish, worse than rubbish;

00:41:15.563 --> 00:41:17.783
the person who is
completely labor class...

00:41:17.783 --> 00:41:19.959
lives in cement. A
wooden house is a

00:41:19.983 --> 00:41:22.783
superior thing, and
even better than that...

00:41:22.783 --> 00:41:29.543
is the thatched house,
which is called...’Kual’;

00:41:29.543 --> 00:41:36.723
It's knitted, that's the best. If you see
it, you'll say, "How beautifully it's been

00:41:36.723 --> 00:41:39.243
built with our own hands!"
Our values have changed;

00:41:39.267 --> 00:41:41.483
if our values are
right, then we'll know...

00:41:41.483 --> 00:41:47.163
how rich we've become, and how much
God has given us. God...

00:41:47.163 --> 00:41:50.963
has blessed us not with ten glasses,
one for each drink...

00:41:50.963 --> 00:41:54.359
Have you seen in anyone's house that
there are ten different glasses?

00:41:54.409 --> 00:41:58.423
Here, they have separate glasses for
whiskey, brandy, water...

00:41:58.423 --> 00:42:04.203
Separate for poison, and every other thing
has separate glasses, and in our house...

00:42:04.203 --> 00:42:08.374
there's only one clean,
pure, good, and superior...

00:42:08.398 --> 00:42:11.983
brass glass. What's
the advantage of that?

00:42:11.983 --> 00:42:14.214
Their glass and their
entire civilization is

00:42:14.238 --> 00:42:16.783
based on glass...; What’s
there in them that you

00:42:16.783 --> 00:42:22.023
People want to learn from them?
We are not short of anything, but now we're

00:42:22.023 --> 00:42:26.583
trying to become like them. So, we think
that we'll consider ourselves equal...but

00:42:26.583 --> 00:42:32.923
we don't know how to talk among ourselves.
The true form of Lakshmi is in

00:42:32.923 --> 00:42:35.411
giving among ourselves;
Laxmi Pati, when they

00:42:35.435 --> 00:42:37.923
start giving, only then
more will come to them.

00:42:37.923 --> 00:42:40.447
If Lakshmi Pati is
no more, then in three

00:42:40.471 --> 00:42:43.503
generations, and his
children and grandchildren

00:42:43.503 --> 00:42:47.623
if cursed by all and want that they
be destroyed in every way,

00:42:47.623 --> 00:42:52.243
There in is litigation and fighting,
and later on whatever happens,

00:42:52.243 --> 00:42:57.282
In litigation all money get consumed
by Advocates, that's not Lakshmi Pati;

00:42:57.307 --> 00:43:01.965
Or those commercial women who
loot such houses, would he be Lakshmi Pati?

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:05.839
Lakshmi Pati is one who... [inaudible]
no one can touch his Lakshmi.

00:43:05.873 --> 00:43:08.728
He should be called Lakshmi
Pati whose things may someone

00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:11.606
dare steal; and if one does,
his condition will worsen.

00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:15.858
Such Lakshmi Pati and Lakshmi principle
are the most abundant in this country.

00:43:15.883 --> 00:43:21.883
But we've forgotten them;
what have we become now? Even I don't

00:43:21.883 --> 00:43:27.163
understand myself; I've become a stranger
in this country. I don’t

00:43:27.163 --> 00:43:29.532
Understand that when
God has given us everything;

00:43:29.556 --> 00:43:32.223
Small thing to be satisfied
with what we have, why do

00:43:32.223 --> 00:43:37.703
we lack in that. In Punjabi language,
we always keep on doing ‘Khai, Khai’,

00:43:37.703 --> 00:43:42.503
isn’t it; don’t know that, maybe the word
has lost its meaning, but earlier, "khai",

00:43:42.503 --> 00:43:44.824
whatever it is ‘Khai’,
is truth; All is well.

00:43:44.848 --> 00:43:47.912
If someone asks, "How are
you?". All fine [ Khairiyat Se]

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:52.362
So, did I reply, was not
to say that I'm dying. when

00:43:52.403 --> 00:43:56.783
you're fine [Khariyat Se], it means
saying from the heart,

00:43:56.783 --> 00:43:59.964
"I'm really fine." and
until there is contentment

00:43:59.988 --> 00:44:03.103
in all, Lakshmi's blessings
won't be bestowed.

00:44:03.103 --> 00:44:07.143
Until then Lakshmi's blessings won’t

00:44:07.143 --> 00:44:11.716
come on you because the
solution is only her blessings.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:16.313
And if you don't have
contentment, no matter how much...

00:44:16.313 --> 00:44:23.073
Money gets showered upon you, you are of
no worth, Absolutely useless and

00:44:23.073 --> 00:44:25.781
And another thing which
makes the Lakshmi Go

00:44:25.805 --> 00:44:28.513
is miserliness.
Hindustanis are a bit less

00:44:28.513 --> 00:44:31.211
Miser; these people are
more miser. they become...

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:33.933
so, we need to avoid
miserliness. Whatever money

00:44:33.933 --> 00:44:38.693
they have, that much they get glued to
money; more the money comes, more miser

00:44:38.693 --> 00:44:42.031
they are. So beware of
miserliness. Lakshmi ji’s

00:44:42.055 --> 00:44:45.393
principle is giving,
charity, charity, charity.

00:44:45.393 --> 00:44:48.905
The person who gives charity...

00:44:48.906 --> 00:44:53.708
that is Lakshmi Pati; Lakshmi ji always
resides, indestructible.

00:44:53.733 --> 00:45:00.833
because of her nature. Today, I said
something about Lakshmi ji...

00:45:00.833 --> 00:45:02.481
after seeing the
condition of these people...

00:45:02.505 --> 00:45:04.833
I felt like telling something
to people of the region; ‘Bhai’

00:45:04.833 --> 00:45:08.506
what are you doing,
doing all this Lakshmi ji...

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:12.203
won't come. Lakshmi ji
will come to Sahjis only

00:45:12.203 --> 00:45:15.391
On realization, awakening
the Lakshmi principal.

00:45:15.415 --> 00:45:18.263
Then all sorts of ‘
Bhoot ‘ problems will

00:45:18.263 --> 00:45:21.381
vanish from the world.
Now, the Chakra above

00:45:21.405 --> 00:45:24.523
that, about which I
told you, is of security,

00:45:24.523 --> 00:45:30.863
where in the Goddess resides and which
for us is the endowment our power, Shakti.

00:45:30.863 --> 00:45:37.823
In Hinduism, Shakti is worshipped...
Hinduism is the worship of Shakti, but...

00:45:37.823 --> 00:45:42.723
we don't see Hindus worshipping Shakti;
instead, they

00:45:42.723 --> 00:45:48.403
worship money. I've never
seen Hindus worshipping Shakti...

00:45:48.403 --> 00:45:53.663
They might be worshiping, but in their
minds they only want money. Even to the

00:45:53.663 --> 00:45:59.683
Extent, when they go to Shakti's
they ask Mother! Give us money. Going

00:45:59.683 --> 00:46:04.383
To Shakti and asking this that give
us money; Instead we should ask to

00:46:04.383 --> 00:46:05.434
Make us capable.

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:12.156
Make equal meaning, what we are, make
us of the same meaning. Make us the Spirit.

00:46:12.156 --> 00:46:20.156
If we ask for this from our mother, then
there is no need to ask for any worldly thing.

00:46:20.156 --> 00:46:24.196
You are powerless, so
you run after other things.

00:46:24.196 --> 00:46:27.256
The one who is capable,
keeps them on his kick.

00:46:27.256 --> 00:46:30.876
He is a King; he does
not care for any thing.

00:46:30.876 --> 00:46:35.996
And so we need to awaken in Sahaja
Yoga and rise and stand up and be

00:46:35.996 --> 00:46:39.996
such special people, who
are of one specific in the world.

00:46:39.996 --> 00:46:44.076
In which all these stupid wasteful things,
that Sahab grabbed someone's money

00:46:44.076 --> 00:46:49.256
snatched someone's house, troubled
someone, murdered some one; Such a

00:46:49.256 --> 00:46:55.136
kind of demon army is getting
created in this country, to abolish this

00:46:55.136 --> 00:46:59.836
it is necessary that you awaken in Sahaja
Yoga, then such people will get readied, such

00:46:59.861 --> 00:47:03.997
people will be ready, that no demonic
power of the world can remove them.

00:47:04.022 --> 00:47:08.397
And could not destroy them. This
is the only way to save our country.

00:47:08.422 --> 00:47:11.995
I do not see any other way out.
There should be transformation

00:47:12.019 --> 00:47:16.003
and for the transformation there
should be awakening of Kundalini.

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:21.103
Until the Kundalini's awakened,
there won't be transformation in you.

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:24.828
Now the very important Chakra
that is called Vishuddhi Chakra

00:47:24.853 --> 00:47:29.311
today is too much catching of
you all because its dusty all around.

00:47:29.336 --> 00:47:34.696
And this Shri Chakra is on the name
of Shri Krishna. It is Shri Krishna's

00:47:34.696 --> 00:47:37.829
abode, He is Purnavatar
[Great Incarnation]; He is

00:47:37.853 --> 00:47:41.436
Purnavtar because for Him
this world is a play [Leela].

00:47:41.461 --> 00:47:47.296
All is a joke, He is in those
conditions where any artificiality He

00:47:47.296 --> 00:47:51.736
need not do, need not say
anything, need not sniveler

00:47:51.736 --> 00:47:57.886
He is doing all this play. When in
Sahaja Yoga, a person rises above

00:47:57.886 --> 00:48:03.384
this Chakra, this power comes in
him too that he starts witnessing.

00:48:03.409 --> 00:48:11.382
He does not get entangled in unwarented
things, a pleasure always reflects in him.

00:48:11.407 --> 00:48:15.036
And he witnesses that the whole
world is just a continuing play; all this

00:48:15.036 --> 00:48:19.396
fun is going on, all this is falsehood;
Why all these people are running

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:22.144
after this falsehood. This
Chakra is very important

00:48:22.168 --> 00:48:24.916
with in us. Now earlier I
used to say people that

00:48:24.916 --> 00:48:28.656
Do not smoke. Now when cancer
disease has come, people are saying that

00:48:28.656 --> 00:48:31.416
yes 'Bhai', Mother was saying
not to smoke; now all people

00:48:31.416 --> 00:48:36.296
say that it definitely results in
cancer. What is cancer? Cancer also

00:48:36.296 --> 00:48:40.636
deviation from Sushmna is
Cancer. If you are on Sushumna,

00:48:40.636 --> 00:48:43.664
then you cannot have any
disease, especially cancer; But

00:48:43.688 --> 00:48:46.716
if you remained deviated
from Sushmna to either left or

00:48:46.716 --> 00:48:52.956
right in any extreme you may
get Cancer. So in the middle

00:48:52.956 --> 00:48:56.479
you have to stay; After coming
to Sahaja Yoga thousands

00:48:56.503 --> 00:48:59.896
of people, thousands of
people have left cigarette

00:48:59.896 --> 00:49:03.804
smoking cigarettes
instantly. Like that their Guru

00:49:03.828 --> 00:49:07.656
element also got
corrected, drinking etc. also

00:49:07.656 --> 00:49:12.882
they left. Now this Vishuddhi
Chakra, the main spaeciality of it is that

00:49:12.906 --> 00:49:18.131
when we raised our neck
and we became human

00:49:18.156 --> 00:49:23.556
then only Vishuddhi
Chakra got fully manifested;

00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:26.491
prior to it, whatever
its role that was

00:49:26.516 --> 00:49:30.304
not completed and now it
has sixteen roles,'Kalayein';

00:49:30.328 --> 00:49:33.829
Shri Krishna is identified
as Sixteen Kala! And

00:49:33.854 --> 00:49:36.553
in the same way
sixteen are its sub-plexes.

00:49:36.587 --> 00:49:39.695
One, whose Vishuddhi
Chakra will be fine, his

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:45.028
face will be here this side, before
that its work was not completed.

00:49:45.053 --> 00:49:51.486
And now it has its sixteen roles.
Shri Krishna is called 'Solah Kala'.

00:49:51.519 --> 00:49:53.912
And like wise it has
sixteen sub plexes. The

00:49:53.936 --> 00:49:56.328
one, whose Vishuddhi
Chakra will be alright

00:49:56.353 --> 00:50:01.886
his face will be beautiful, glorious,
his eyes will have magnificent,

00:50:01.986 --> 00:50:06.216
and his figure will be
stunning and his magnificence

00:50:06.216 --> 00:50:11.736
would have a high level of sense of
detachment; as if seeing a play. On that man's

00:50:11.736 --> 00:50:15.276
face it will look as if some play is going
on; in a moment he is anngry and in another

00:50:15.276 --> 00:50:17.509
he will be laughing,
only his pranks would be

00:50:17.533 --> 00:50:20.175
going on. Whose Vishuddhi
chakra goes out of order

00:50:20.175 --> 00:50:25.656
है, उसकी शकल खराब हो जाती है पहली बात,
And all of this becomes like rebellious;

00:50:25.656 --> 00:50:30.816
his face will have indifferent
looks sometimes scary, sometimes

00:50:30.816 --> 00:50:34.029
sometimes scared.
Now what all we people

00:50:34.053 --> 00:50:38.176
[inaudible] do, there
is no need to do all that.

00:50:38.176 --> 00:50:40.653
there is no need to do any
thing for this. You just correct

00:50:40.677 --> 00:50:42.982
your Vishuddhi Chakra
and your face will be alright.

00:50:43.015 --> 00:50:45.825
Much of facial will
get set right and apart

00:50:45.849 --> 00:50:49.196
from it the one whose
Vishuddhi Chakra is caught

00:50:49.196 --> 00:50:52.933
his voice also either
becomes harsh Or it gets

00:50:52.957 --> 00:50:57.193
slowed down or its
sweetness will become extinct.

00:50:57.226 --> 00:51:00.586
The third thing is that
there is a left side of the

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:04.443
Vishuddhi Chakra inside us,
which we can say that which

00:51:04.543 --> 00:51:08.530
On our left side, she
is Vishnu Maya, that is,

00:51:08.554 --> 00:51:12.540
the sister of Shri Krishna,
who was Vishnu Maya.

00:51:12.574 --> 00:51:19.824
Now that our sibling
relationship has deteriorated,

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:22.486
In any case, this Chakra
is spoiled when brothers do

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:25.106
not appreciate their
sisters, he teases his sisters,

00:51:25.106 --> 00:51:30.266
the also this Chakra goes bad.
But in world when we look at every

00:51:30.266 --> 00:51:34.866
women with bad eyes, and we
are not left within us the thought

00:51:34.866 --> 00:51:38.806
that this is our sister then
this Chakra is caught very badly

00:51:38.806 --> 00:51:43.386
and when left Vishuddhi turns
bad then the man feels that I made a

00:51:43.386 --> 00:51:47.666
big mistake. In a way he
becomes a guilty man and

00:51:47.666 --> 00:51:51.606
sometimes this guilt increases so much that
he starts commting more sins with his hand.

00:51:51.606 --> 00:51:54.314
लगते हैं। He develops
a guilt complex inside

00:51:54.338 --> 00:51:57.426
him.Therefore it has its
mantra in Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:57.426 --> 00:52:01.366
In English it is said that I am not guilty;
In Hindi people say," Mother we did not

00:52:01.366 --> 00:52:06.986
commit any such mistake that you
can't pardon. The right side Vishuddhi

00:52:06.986 --> 00:52:14.506
is of Vitthal Rukmani, that is of the
time when He was ruling. When we

00:52:14.506 --> 00:52:20.546
are positioned in our Kingdom, means our
Kingdom is that of God and when in God's

00:52:20.546 --> 00:52:25.786
when we are sitting in the kingdom of God
and still we are begging like a begger and

00:52:25.786 --> 00:52:29.486
ask for money from people
and we flatter them and

00:52:29.486 --> 00:52:36.645
bow down before them then the right
Vishuddhi gets caught. The person who

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:40.307
for his selfish motive
bows down his head before

00:52:40.332 --> 00:52:44.655
others or bows down before
the the negative man because

00:52:44.709 --> 00:52:48.851
he considers him to be the Guru or
something, his right Vishuddhi gets caught.

00:52:48.876 --> 00:52:55.557
And for the right Vishuddhi many
complications arise, specially cancer

00:52:55.624 --> 00:52:59.781
may result. So those who for
flattering are going on feet of this and

00:52:59.806 --> 00:53:02.994
touching the feet of
other, doing this and that

00:53:03.018 --> 00:53:06.206
for them, may know in
end that except for God

00:53:06.206 --> 00:53:13.836
they should not bow down their
head. And what is the need to bow and

00:53:13.836 --> 00:53:18.936
down in front of them and what can they
give. Many people say that he was a Saint, we

00:53:18.936 --> 00:53:21.640
bowed down; more so
they are hypocrites and

00:53:21.664 --> 00:53:24.756
silly, if not then 420 or
demonic or Rakshasi.

00:53:24.756 --> 00:53:30.656
Ok, if its not, take it there, a monk,
is Sadhu or Saint and realized too,

00:53:30.656 --> 00:53:36.016
understand, still he is a human and
not God. He is not an incarnation. When

00:53:36.016 --> 00:53:39.816
Unless he is an incarnation, where is
need to bow head. Tomorrow you too may

00:53:39.816 --> 00:53:46.276
get realized, but to

00:53:46.276 --> 00:53:48.934
in front of the incarnation
is other thing; Then all

00:53:48.958 --> 00:53:51.616
the Chakras open up. Only
in front of the incarnation,

00:53:51.616 --> 00:53:55.276
one should bow down head.
Bowing head before the parents is

00:53:55.276 --> 00:53:58.114
another thing. It's a
daily courtsy, its different

00:53:58.138 --> 00:54:00.976
thing. Bowed down to
parents, if went in marriage

00:54:00.976 --> 00:54:04.716
then touched feet of
elders, its another thing.

00:54:04.716 --> 00:54:10.136
Did once, its done, its courtsy,
but every time whosoever comes

00:54:10.136 --> 00:54:16.516
some gentleman from there and
said that 'Sahab' he is a minister sir

00:54:16.516 --> 00:54:19.197
and here are his four
deadly followers coming

00:54:19.221 --> 00:54:21.902
behind him and
[inaudible] meeting is done.

00:54:21.936 --> 00:54:28.176
People who are in such a
plight get into such sufferings.

00:54:28.176 --> 00:54:33.455
They face so much problems that
I am tired of treating them because

00:54:33.455 --> 00:54:38.916
man should care for his honor and the
pride; This Chakra that gave you pride

00:54:38.916 --> 00:54:43.436
you raised your head. Not for this that
you keep on bowing down at every place and

00:54:43.436 --> 00:54:45.638
decline your esteem.
You are great thing,

00:54:45.662 --> 00:54:48.196
God has transformed you
human from an amoeba.

00:54:48.196 --> 00:54:52.996
and when you have come to this condition,
its necessary for you to respect it.

00:54:52.996 --> 00:55:00.076
respect self and know your
pride. Second thing is this that

00:55:00.076 --> 00:55:05.666
Many people also have the feeling
that they are afraid of others; this also

00:55:05.666 --> 00:55:11.109
can catch the left Vishuddhi.
When you're afraid of a man

00:55:11.146 --> 00:55:15.886
In fact, you are unnecessarily afraid;
then your left Vishuddhi can be on hold.

00:55:15.886 --> 00:55:17.983
The Vishuddhi Chakra
is very important and

00:55:18.007 --> 00:55:20.566
caught up Vishuddhi Chakra
causes many diseases,

00:55:20.566 --> 00:55:23.786
but then the worst thing is
that even if your realiztion

00:55:23.786 --> 00:55:28.886
you do not feel the vibrations, you do
not feel; all the sensation of hand dies.

00:55:28.886 --> 00:55:32.666
Then you don't feel in hand,
and people say Mother! inside

00:55:32.666 --> 00:55:36.906
we are but do not feel in
hand. And so they find problem.

00:55:36.906 --> 00:55:40.084
The biggest obstacle
of the Vishuddhi is that if

00:55:40.108 --> 00:55:43.286
you have uttered the
wrong mantras, if you have

00:55:43.286 --> 00:55:47.826
taken mantras from any person who is un
authorized, who has given you false mantr,.

00:55:47.826 --> 00:55:52.266
in all these your left Vishuddhi will
catch and treatment of this left Vishuddhi

00:55:52.266 --> 00:55:57.526
is to awaken that mantra. If
any mantra is not awakened,

00:55:57.526 --> 00:56:02.920
then don't chant it and Mantar wake up only
when it is told by some realized soul and

00:56:02.953 --> 00:56:06.138
may also demonstrate other
remedies too. Or that to what extent its

00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:09.784
alright, what is the problem, which
Mantra is to be chanted at what time.

00:56:09.817 --> 00:56:15.151
And if he can tell you fully,
then you say that mantra

00:56:15.184 --> 00:56:17.051
Then you can
accomplish the mantra.

00:56:17.151 --> 00:56:21.751
In Sahaja Yoga today there are thousands
of people who have aquired mantras power.

00:56:21.786 --> 00:56:23.786
They are so authoritative
of these Mantra that

00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:25.766
if they, right sitting
at their place here

00:56:25.766 --> 00:56:29.626
with them then that
can work out their tasks

00:56:29.626 --> 00:56:34.341
आप, लेकिन अच्छे मंत्र Can do ऐसे
अच्छे लोग पहुंच गए हैं सहज योग में,

00:56:34.366 --> 00:56:38.626
दिल्ली में नहीं हैं इतना।
Something in Delhi

00:56:38.626 --> 00:56:43.726
Are not पर बाकी ऐसे मैंने बहुत से People
who saw the mantras completely and on

00:56:43.726 --> 00:56:48.935
the mantra for that perfection मेहनत
करनी पड़ती है। You have to sit and say

00:56:48.968 --> 00:56:52.806
mantras, have to speak on it, on your
chakras ध्यान करना पड़ता है और उसकी

00:56:52.806 --> 00:56:57.266
सिद्धता हासिल करनी पड़ती
है। If someone gave Ganesh

00:56:57.266 --> 00:57:00.844
He can do such wonders,
which has no limits. But till

00:57:00.868 --> 00:57:04.446
now there are many innocent
people in Sahaja Yoga that

00:57:04.446 --> 00:57:09.086
Those who care this and those
who have cared for, that is most of

00:57:09.086 --> 00:57:13.686
The people who perfected
the mantra so quickly, I wonder.

00:57:13.686 --> 00:57:20.226
Such a big task can be accomplished with just
one of his mantra. That is why I tell you

00:57:20.226 --> 00:57:25.866
not to disturb your Vishuddhi Chakra. The
Vishuddhi Chakra is Virat, Krishna is the

00:57:25.866 --> 00:57:28.644
manifestation of Virat.
Finally Krishna is 'Virata' great.

00:57:28.668 --> 00:57:31.446
Whatever evolution there is
only due to power of Vishnu.

00:57:31.446 --> 00:57:36.146
So, when he becomes Vishnu, He
finally becomes Virat and this is the

00:57:36.146 --> 00:57:41.086
place of Virat; Since this is the place
of Virat, to correct this Vishuddhi Chakra

00:57:41.086 --> 00:57:44.004
you do not bow down
in front of anyone, it must

00:57:44.028 --> 00:57:46.946
bow down only in front
of Virata because you

00:57:46.946 --> 00:57:50.284
now have become part of
Virata gone, now you are realized

00:57:50.308 --> 00:57:53.587
and beware if you bowed
your head in front of anyone.

00:57:53.671 --> 00:57:58.106
If you have bowed down in front of
someone, you have forgotten Virat.

00:57:58.106 --> 00:58:00.721
Muhammad Saheb has
said a very great Mantra of

00:58:00.745 --> 00:58:03.886
Virata, "You call Allah Ho
Akbar" and this Mantra is

00:58:03.911 --> 00:58:06.962
Muhammad Saheb, who was
an incarnation of Dattatreya,

00:58:06.986 --> 00:58:09.861
has said this mantra,
"You say Allah Ho Akbar".

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:14.563
Akbar means Great, means Virata,
this finger is of Virat, of Vishuddhi.

00:58:14.588 --> 00:58:18.788
If you put both fingers in the ear
and push your neck backwards and

00:58:18.846 --> 00:58:23.326
say Allah Ho Akbar, then your Vishuddhi
Chakra gets opened. Apart from this many

00:58:23.326 --> 00:58:25.984
asanas etc are there,
that I can't tell you today;

00:58:26.008 --> 00:58:28.666
But there are many ways
in which it can be cured

00:58:28.666 --> 00:58:33.906
and it should be kept right. The
biggest thing is that you will not say

00:58:33.906 --> 00:58:39.320
any bitter thing to anyone with your tongue
and there is no need to flatter anyone.

00:58:39.347 --> 00:58:40.979
When someone does
not believe in Sahaja Yoga,

00:58:41.003 --> 00:58:42.561
then you should
clearly say, "Let it be,

00:58:42.586 --> 00:58:48.166
you can not access it, leave it."
There is no need to flatter anyone, nor is

00:58:48.166 --> 00:58:52.586
there any need to beg anyone, nor is
there a need to talk harsh to anyone.

00:58:52.586 --> 00:58:56.369
It's okay if they believe
it, otherwise leave it, just

00:58:56.393 --> 00:59:00.176
finish the work, be in the
middle. The Vishuddhi Chakra

00:59:00.176 --> 00:59:06.516
has many defects, there are many ways
of it, because it has sixteen kalas, and

00:59:06.516 --> 00:59:12.076
sixteen thousand are its powers, which were
with Krishna as his wives during his time.

00:59:12.076 --> 00:59:18.276
If someone says that he
was such an addict for Krishna,

00:59:18.276 --> 00:59:21.664
So it is very surprising that
the One who is Yogeshwar

00:59:21.688 --> 00:59:24.756
of the Yogeshwars, in
order to understand him,

00:59:24.756 --> 00:59:27.926
you will have to learn
a lot about him; he was

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:31.616
Yogeshwar himself, these
were his sixteen thousand

00:59:31.616 --> 00:59:37.396
powers which he had given birth to in
this world and then he got them imprisoned,

00:59:37.396 --> 00:59:43.556
and he married them again
because he had no Sahaja Yogi,

00:59:43.556 --> 00:59:48.456
So he thought, "Okay, I keep my
powers in the world in human form.

00:59:48.456 --> 00:59:51.522
And the biggest work
that he has done is to

00:59:51.556 --> 00:59:58.406
cultivate Sahaja
Yoga. He spread out

00:59:58.456 --> 01:00:06.396
the seed completely, and Jesus came
to the Agya Chakra afterwards and said,

01:00:06.396 --> 01:00:11.716
"Some seeds fell here, some seeds fell
there, some seeds remained in between."

01:00:11.716 --> 01:00:14.863
When Jesus speaks
of his father, he is no

01:00:14.887 --> 01:00:18.665
other than second or
the third, he is Krishna.

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:21.205
Krishna is his father, whenever
you look at Jesus Christ, this

01:00:21.229 --> 01:00:23.982
is these two fingers. He used
them to spread the seed completely;

01:00:24.032 --> 01:00:27.257
This finger is of Vishnu
and this finger is of Krishna.

01:00:27.282 --> 01:00:29.890
He always talked
about his father, for this,

01:00:29.914 --> 01:00:32.340
if you read, then
read the Devi Bhagwat

01:00:32.381 --> 01:00:34.729
in which there is a
description of Mahavishnu,

01:00:34.753 --> 01:00:36.681
who was made the
son of Radha ji and

01:00:36.714 --> 01:00:44.681
exactly the same thing is Jesus Christ,
he had two parts, one was Shri Ganesha

01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:46.339
and one Jesus Christ.

01:00:46.407 --> 01:00:52.527
Moving forward, in the Eleventh Rudra,
the great power that exists is the Om

01:00:52.527 --> 01:00:54.915
power. This is why He
did not die; His resurrection

01:00:54.939 --> 01:00:57.567
occurred, for He was the
embodiment of Pranava because

01:00:57.567 --> 01:01:02.547
He came into this world and then departed
from it. He was the very form of Ganesh, who

01:01:02.547 --> 01:01:07.687
came into this world, and thus nothing could
destroy Him. He was the only incarnation

01:01:07.687 --> 01:01:16.112
sent by the Divine, who was solely the
Pranava. The reason He was crucified was

01:01:16.137 --> 01:01:23.610
because the Agnya Chakra
He had to be open up.

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:31.477
When, due to human stupidity,
He was crucified, it was as though

01:01:31.501 --> 01:01:36.367
He removed Himself from that Agnya
Chakra for the sake of everyone. And

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:44.442
His message was not about the cross;
His message was about resurrection.

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:48.274
He rose up and
demonstrated resurrection.

01:01:48.299 --> 01:01:51.711
He showed how to
live after dying, and that

01:01:51.735 --> 01:01:55.146
is the essence of Sahaja
Yoga, where you too

01:01:55.196 --> 01:01:58.606
experience the same. The
conception is immaculate, meaning

01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:01.979
that even today, when you
enter the womb of the mother,

01:02:02.012 --> 01:02:07.757
she brings you into this world through
the Brahmarandhra; you are the one who

01:02:07.782 --> 01:02:11.890
first die and are reborn anew.
Jesus Christ was the first to

01:02:11.915 --> 01:02:17.173
demonstrate this; He was the greatest
son of the mother and your eldest brother.

01:02:17.198 --> 01:02:21.998
He was the first to do such a great
deed, and today, by his example, you are

01:02:22.023 --> 01:02:28.643
also doing the same. Every incarnation that
comes leads the way, takes a step forward,

01:02:28.676 --> 01:02:32.816
and performs great
and magnificent works.

01:02:32.841 --> 01:02:38.321
And the person who has crossed the
Agnya Chakra knows that our mantra is

01:02:38.346 --> 01:02:40.734
returning to Sahaja
Yoga, and once they return,

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:43.146
they are immediately
freed from the Agnya Chakra

01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:49.111
because it has been said, just
as we forgive our sins, we forgive

01:02:49.136 --> 01:02:54.396
those who have opposed
us, in the same way, O Lord,

01:02:54.421 --> 01:02:57.064
forgive our sins. This is
the mantra of the Agnya

01:02:57.088 --> 01:02:59.621
Chakra; you will be
surprised, and many times

01:02:59.646 --> 01:03:02.746
I tell you to forgive,
forgive, forgive because your

01:03:02.771 --> 01:03:09.951
Agnya is caught. Between ego
and anti-ego, there is a space where

01:03:09.976 --> 01:03:12.124
the pituitary and pineal
glands manage both,

01:03:12.148 --> 01:03:14.196
and in between them
is a subtle space of

01:03:14.221 --> 01:03:21.421
the Agnya. Both of these work
and both are handled by them and

01:03:21.446 --> 01:03:26.686
their behavior. The process begins with the
Vishuddhi Chakra, but their movement and

01:03:26.711 --> 01:03:33.360
Handling and the steering happen
through the Agnya Chakra, where

01:03:33.396 --> 01:03:36.828
Mahaganesh and Mahabhairav
are seated. And what

01:03:36.852 --> 01:03:40.210
was in front, the place
of the Agnya Chakra

01:03:40.235 --> 01:03:46.475
here is the place of Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ is Mahavishnu. And

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:52.400
Krishna had said for Him that whatever
things people offer to me in this world,

01:03:52.443 --> 01:03:55.141
one-sixteenth of that will be
yours, and you will come as the

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:57.863
foundation of the entire world.
And higher than me even will be

01:03:57.888 --> 01:04:02.888
your place . Although Shri
Krishna’s position is that of the Virata,

01:04:02.913 --> 01:04:06.353
here in the middle of Agnya Chakra,
see at both the places, see that in

01:04:06.378 --> 01:04:09.756
between these two, He
placed His son. And Radha

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:13.158
Ji herself is Mary, who
in the same form of Mary

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:15.276
came into this world;
She brought this son.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.743
This entire play and
drama were enacted so that

01:04:17.768 --> 01:04:20.007
human beings, in
their foolishness, could

01:04:20.031 --> 01:04:22.888
understand that in their
arrogance, in their ego,

01:04:22.913 --> 01:04:25.711
they failed to recognize
even a being like Jesus

01:04:25.735 --> 01:04:28.533
Christ, who was the
embodiment of the Spirit.

01:04:28.558 --> 01:04:34.748
But now this cannot happen. Jesus
Christ has said that whatever you may have

01:04:34.773 --> 01:04:36.861
said against me, I
forgive that, and whatever

01:04:36.885 --> 01:04:39.593
injustice you have done
to me, I will forgive that too.

01:04:39.618 --> 01:04:42.508
But if anyone takes
even a small step against

01:04:42.532 --> 01:04:45.158
the Holy Ghost,
meaning the Adi Shakti,

01:04:45.183 --> 01:04:51.643
I will take care of it. He has
clearly stated in plain words that

01:04:51.668 --> 01:04:58.608
the punishment for that will be very
severe. He has said this explicitly.

01:04:58.633 --> 01:05:02.673
If you read the Bible, you will
see that he has mentioned that

01:05:02.698 --> 01:05:05.490
the Holy Ghost will come
into the world, and from the

01:05:05.514 --> 01:05:08.738
Holy Ghost, cool air will flow,
the Cool Breeze will come.

01:05:08.763 --> 01:05:10.853
This is written in
the Bible. That is why

01:05:10.877 --> 01:05:13.703
Christians, not so much
in India, but those outside,

01:05:13.728 --> 01:05:15.816
accept this very quickly.
This is the sign of the

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.928
Holy Ghost; this is the
sign of the Adi Shakti.

01:05:17.953 --> 01:05:23.173
No one else emits such cool air as
that which comes from the Holy Ghost.

01:05:23.198 --> 01:05:25.451
This is written in it,
but the most surprising

01:05:25.475 --> 01:05:27.678
thing is that there
was a William Blake...

01:05:27.703 --> 01:05:32.575
A man named William Blake, who was a great
poet a hundred years ago, even wrote about

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.167
where our ashram would
be. He mentioned that the

01:05:35.191 --> 01:05:38.306
ashram would be in Lambeth
Well, where among the ruins,

01:05:38.343 --> 01:05:40.221
furbations would be
offered, which is true.

01:05:40.245 --> 01:05:42.123
And where all Mother
first visited in London,

01:05:42.148 --> 01:05:44.936
the place where I lived
in Surrey Hills. He wrote,

01:05:44.969 --> 01:05:47.544
"First because will
live in Surrey Hills."

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:49.802
He also mentioned
that, Her love, in detail.

01:05:49.836 --> 01:05:52.612
the vibrations of their of
would spread like sinews

01:05:52.636 --> 01:05:56.136
everywhere, reaching every
place and being used in every way.

01:05:56.203 --> 01:05:58.194
He described Sahaja
Yoga in such fine detail,

01:05:58.218 --> 01:06:00.483
and the most significant
thing he wrote was that

01:06:00.508 --> 01:06:02.678
in Sahaja Yoga, people would
become prophets, meaning

01:06:02.702 --> 01:06:05.208
they would become apostles,
they would attain realization.

01:06:05.263 --> 01:06:08.062
The people of God, the
men of God, would achieve

01:06:08.086 --> 01:06:11.363
self-realization. And one
special thing would be that

01:06:11.397 --> 01:06:14.445
those who attain
realizationwould also make

01:06:14.469 --> 01:06:17.517
others into prophets.
He described everything

01:06:17.542 --> 01:06:22.333
In the same way, even in John's
Revelation, everything about Sahaja Yoga is

01:06:22.358 --> 01:06:24.465
written. Those who have
the understanding can

01:06:24.489 --> 01:06:26.596
comprehend it after
attaining realization.

01:06:26.621 --> 01:06:31.161
Such prophecies have been made
everywhere. Those who are wise

01:06:31.186 --> 01:06:36.293
understand everything, but
for those who are not wise,

01:06:36.294 --> 01:06:39.526
it is like letters before a
buffalo—they cannot grasp it.

01:06:39.551 --> 01:06:45.251
It is the same thing. For
a person to understand,

01:06:45.294 --> 01:06:49.114
they must first attain realization.
Until the light comes within, one cannot

01:06:49.147 --> 01:06:51.524
comprehend it. That is why
you must first attain realization,

01:06:51.548 --> 01:06:53.647
and then everything
completely you will understand.

01:06:53.672 --> 01:07:02.052
Speaking about it without realization
will be futile. Well, it has been a long

01:07:02.077 --> 01:07:07.377
time now, so you should attain realization.
Already all are done. Please put your hands

01:07:07.402 --> 01:07:14.002
Towards me, which day is your center
here? It dented; Dented every where

01:07:14.027 --> 01:07:18.967
as if just escaping, as if just above
the head and was in between the crown.

01:07:18.992 --> 01:07:23.732
This is how it happened, and as soon
as the key was turned, the bus started

01:07:23.757 --> 01:07:29.577
moving again. People were astonished,
saying that into such a deep pit

01:07:29.609 --> 01:07:31.888
all those who had fallen,
were three generations of

01:07:31.912 --> 01:07:34.650
people, all would have perished
—none would have survived.

01:07:34.707 --> 01:07:41.047
There are countless such incidents, but if
two people will not come here on Sunday

01:07:41.047 --> 01:07:45.632
or Monday, then for them, Mataji
does not exist; First, force yourself to

01:07:45.657 --> 01:07:48.475
come; afterward, you will
come naturally. Even if stopped

01:07:48.499 --> 01:07:51.317
forcefully, you will not stop
because, in the beginning,

01:07:51.342 --> 01:07:57.422
you have to gauge yourself a
little. Once you understand yourself,

01:07:57.447 --> 01:08:00.239
the joy is so immense that
nothing else matters.Then,

01:08:00.263 --> 01:08:02.677
you will come here out
of sheer enthusiasm.

01:08:02.702 --> 01:08:05.040
Someone might say, "Not
on Monday, sir," and you will

01:08:05.064 --> 01:08:07.402
feel, "Oh, what went wrong?"
Because the whole world

01:08:07.427 --> 01:08:11.487
changes. But there comes a time
when you need to push yourself

01:08:11.512 --> 01:08:14.069
a little for it. So
please, push yourself,

01:08:14.093 --> 01:08:17.152
come to Sahaja Yoga,
meet everyone, be blessed,

01:08:17.177 --> 01:08:20.378
and talk amongst yourselves.
These are your real brothers

01:08:20.402 --> 01:08:23.317
and sisters, and they
will tell you where you are

01:08:23.342 --> 01:08:25.361
caught up, where they
are getting stuck, and

01:08:25.385 --> 01:08:27.782
they will explain everything
to you. And now that

01:08:27.807 --> 01:08:29.955
you have been enlightened,
the light has come within you,

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:32.126
you too should look towards
others. Your brothers, sisters,

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:35.062
and relatives call them
up; invite everyone.

01:08:35.086 --> 01:08:37.521
We have a Sahaja
Yogi, Mr. Pradhan.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:43.026
His eldest son's son passed
away in a very tragic way—

01:08:43.062 --> 01:08:46.223
he jumped into a tank
and died. People then

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:49.937
said to him, "Mataji
did nothing for this boy."

01:08:49.937 --> 01:08:55.817
To this, he replied, "Sir, has Mataji
taken a contract for my family?"

01:08:55.817 --> 01:08:59.783
His father never went to Mataji,
and his son never went either.

01:08:59.808 --> 01:09:03.616
Although he was my grandson, and it is
a great sorrow for me, but against Mataji,

01:09:03.641 --> 01:09:06.981
please do not speak. My son
said, "You are being foolish;

01:09:07.006 --> 01:09:09.463
you are completely devoted
to Sahaja Yoga, while this

01:09:09.487 --> 01:09:11.897
boy never even came. He
used to laugh at Mother."

01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:15.161
When they never sought her
refuge, never did anything for it,

01:09:15.185 --> 01:09:18.432
then why do you expect anything? Has
Mother taken a contract for all the work?

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:23.940
And when today, their age
is around 65 or 75 years.

01:09:23.965 --> 01:09:26.451
They are very hardworking
people, very noble people,

01:09:26.475 --> 01:09:28.765
and have done a lot for
Sahaja Yoga. But see,

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:32.777
you invite your relatives for meals,
for gatherings. Tell them to come for the

01:09:32.802 --> 01:09:34.790
feast of Sahaja Yoga.
You may have to invite them

01:09:34.814 --> 01:09:36.802
for food, but they will
surely come for a meal.

01:09:36.827 --> 01:09:42.127
After the meal, there will be bhajans,
and after the bhajans, realization.

01:09:42.152 --> 01:09:44.744
In some way or another,
they have to be brought across.

01:09:44.768 --> 01:09:47.312
It is not easy; they are
not easily caught. Just as

01:09:47.337 --> 01:09:50.035
fish are caught, in the same
way, these Sahaja Yogis

01:09:50.059 --> 01:09:52.757
have to be brought in.That
is why effort must be made.

01:09:52.782 --> 01:09:57.222
Still, many will slip away completely.
So, those who are foolish, let them be.

01:09:57.247 --> 01:09:59.390
We will see them
later. But those who are

01:09:59.414 --> 01:10:01.827
wise, explain to them,
make them understand,

01:10:01.852 --> 01:10:03.343
and bring them into Sahaja Yoga.
