00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:03.579
Birthday Puja March 21, 1998
Delhi, India

00:04:49.593 --> 00:04:58.137
I was overjoyed to see

00:04:58.218 --> 00:05:06.136
this beautiful welcome.the way you had organized

00:05:09.666 --> 00:05:16.246
I must say that it’s your love which finds

00:05:16.353 --> 00:05:27.071
all kind of expressions of enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:28.482 --> 00:05:37.291
I really can’t understand how these unique ideas

00:05:37.617 --> 00:05:45.640
come to your heads, and you represent

00:05:45.677 --> 00:05:51.380
the different countries from where you have come.

00:05:52.362 --> 00:06:00.478
I wish you carry these flags back to
your own countries,

00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:05.664
and tell them the message that the time has come

00:06:05.957 --> 00:06:12.481
for our resurrection, that we have to rise.

00:06:12.942 --> 00:06:18.548
We have to rise above this human level

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.373
to a higher level of existence.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.328
And if that happens, then how it changes your life,

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:37.029
how it makes you happy,
how you lose all your absurd ideas of hatred

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:50.383
and of harming others, injuring others: all this kind of ideas

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:58.547
which have worked out to give some sort of
a sadistic pleasure to many people,

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:07.876
and they have enjoyed the way they want to destroy

00:07:08.353 --> 00:07:12.773
the joy of others, the happiness of others.

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:20.562
To maintain the happiness, I know, you being Sahaja Yogis,

00:07:20.713 --> 00:07:27.349
you have to bear a lot, tolerate a lot of nonsense.

00:07:27.407 --> 00:07:33.411
You have already done it, and gradually once

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.837
Sahaja Yoga is established in your own countries as something

00:07:40.297 --> 00:07:45.090
that is so beautiful, so very pure,

00:07:45.226 --> 00:07:50.776
so very important that all others in your countries

00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:59.357
also will try to follow that path which you have crossed over.

00:07:59.701 --> 00:08:04.302
Only your lives are the ones which will reflect

00:08:04.372 --> 00:08:10.551
the beauty of your inner being and of Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:12.427 --> 00:08:18.004
I told you yesterday what was missing in the human awareness,

00:08:18.052 --> 00:08:22.338
and that the attention was not on the Spirit.

00:08:23.467 --> 00:08:29.500
But when it is on the Spirit, what happens to you?

00:08:29.682 --> 00:08:37.636
Firstly you become according to Sanskrit words, gunatit:

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.319
you go beyond all the three gunas.

00:08:42.626 --> 00:08:51.678
That means you are no more a person who is tamo guni,

00:08:51.703 --> 00:09:02.860
means the one who has got all kinds of desires of self-indulgence.

00:09:04.242 --> 00:09:09.602
Your attention moves from there to the second style

00:09:09.689 --> 00:09:13.978
where you are rajo guni, the right-sidedness:

00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:16.911
they want to do something, want to show something,

00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:21.489
you want to become something, you want to compete with others.

00:09:21.582 --> 00:09:24.457
All this struggle just disappears.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:27.617
"Atit" means beyond.

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:33.553
Then sattwa guni: that is also where you are seeking,

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.239
where you see that what’s wrong in this kind of extreme behavior,

00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:43.071
and you just hate that kind of life

00:09:43.096 --> 00:09:48.626
and you want to get out of it, and then you start seeking.

00:09:49.191 --> 00:09:51.462
That also is finished.

00:09:51.684 --> 00:09:58.490
All the gunas are finished, so you become gunatit.

00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:05.675
It just happens when your attention goes to your Spirit,

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:13.163
because now the attention is not on any one of your inherent,

00:10:13.188 --> 00:10:19.376
you can say, or conditioned qualities, or of egoistical qualities.

00:10:20.367 --> 00:10:27.205
So you become a person who is beyond this.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:35.087
This is something very remarkable as far as

00:10:35.112 --> 00:10:39.776
for normal life, but for you it is not, it just happens.

00:10:39.896 --> 00:10:42.547
You just enjoy being yourself.

00:10:42.984 --> 00:10:49.116
You’re no more concerned about your own conveniences,
comforts and petty things.

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:53.784
But what happens is that you just go beyond

00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:57.546
all these three gunas which have been

00:10:57.714 --> 00:11:03.210
dominating you this way or that way.

00:11:06.525 --> 00:11:13.334
So that’s how you cross the limit of human awareness, firstly.

00:11:14.268 --> 00:11:24.295
Then the second one is, you become kalatit: you go beyond time.

00:11:24.634 --> 00:11:28.674
I know today I was late somehow.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.366
It just works out that way.

00:11:31.391 --> 00:11:33.689
But you didn’t miss the time.

00:11:33.714 --> 00:11:37.469
You were still enjoying.
I could see, sitting in the house,

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:40.340
that you are all in a very enjoyable mood,

00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:43.378
all of you are enjoying nicely.

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:47.298
I’m not here, but still you are enjoying.

00:11:47.511 --> 00:11:49.821
This is beyond time.

00:11:49.846 --> 00:11:52.192
You’re not bound by time.

00:11:52.217 --> 00:11:56.166
Whatever is the time is your own, because

00:11:56.333 --> 00:11:58.896
you are standing in the present,

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:04.527
you are not standing here and thinking of the future.

00:12:04.838 --> 00:12:08.186
You didn’t think about what will happen tomorrow

00:12:08.211 --> 00:12:12.163
or how will you catch your plane, or how will you do this.

00:12:12.188 --> 00:12:14.432
Here you were just enjoying,

00:12:14.472 --> 00:12:19.329
enjoying the present, and the present is the reality.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:24.258
If you are thinking of the future or of the past,

00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:27.512
then you are not in reality.
I have told many-a-times

00:12:27.726 --> 00:12:30.836
that past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

00:12:30.861 --> 00:12:34.865
So at this moment you are here sitting,

00:12:34.953 --> 00:12:38.834
perhaps may be waiting for Me, may be

00:12:38.897 --> 00:12:43.191
just enjoying every moment of your stay here,

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:46.493
of your connections with others.

00:12:46.938 --> 00:12:50.517
And this enjoyment cannot be described,

00:12:50.597 --> 00:12:53.675
how you are enjoying this.

00:12:54.596 --> 00:12:57.652
Otherwise people would be seeing the watch,

00:12:57.724 --> 00:13:00.374
wondering, “Why Mother has not come?

00:13:00.408 --> 00:13:02.239
What is the problem?

00:13:02.264 --> 00:13:08.716
Why She is not arrived?” and all kinds of ideas can go round.

00:13:09.081 --> 00:13:12.602
It helps a lot to be kalatit.

00:13:12.863 --> 00:13:17.479
I remember in Nasik I had to work very hard because

00:13:17.504 --> 00:13:20.732
no Sahaja Yogi would come forward to do anything,

00:13:20.757 --> 00:13:24.118
they were so shy and so much worried.

00:13:24.909 --> 00:13:28.891
And it so happened, luckily or unluckily we can say,

00:13:29.011 --> 00:13:31.653
that My car failed on the way and

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.492
I was delayed in going.

00:13:35.728 --> 00:13:43.429
About one hour passed, there was no car coming that way,
there’s no way to go,

00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:46.654
and we were stranded on the road.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.675
Now surprisingly, when I reached the place

00:13:50.706 --> 00:13:56.594
where we were going to have the program,
the Sahaja Yogis took over.

00:13:56.764 --> 00:14:01.782
They took the responsibility, and they were very busy

00:14:02.417 --> 00:14:05.776
giving Realizations to others and working it out.

00:14:05.801 --> 00:14:07.673
Otherwise they would not.

00:14:07.698 --> 00:14:11.058
They could not believe that they have power to give Realization.

00:14:11.169 --> 00:14:14.650
I may tell them, but they would not raise their hands.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:21.046
And just because the time was there
and they thought, “So many people are here,

00:14:21.071 --> 00:14:26.742
Mother is not coming or She may be coming,
so it’s our responsibility.”

00:14:26.896 --> 00:14:30.306
In that way they took the responsibility.

00:14:30.354 --> 00:14:35.764
So when you are beyond the time,
you become responsible for that moment.

00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:41.268
It’s such a responsibility which is also collective,

00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:46.517
means you just all of you become responsible.

00:14:48.215 --> 00:14:51.589
It’s very surprising, we are so many here,

00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:55.052
there’s no quarrel, no fight, nothing.

00:14:55.203 --> 00:14:59.939
We are very nicely settled down, just beyond

00:14:59.964 --> 00:15:05.169
all kinds of stupid ideas of attacking each other.

00:15:05.328 --> 00:15:12.467
That happens because you are not involved with the time.

00:15:12.618 --> 00:15:15.091
The time cannot bow you down.

00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:19.094
Perhaps if it were not you people, some other people,

00:15:19.205 --> 00:15:22.529
they would have thrown stones on My car,

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:28.291
thinking,  “So it is so late She comes,
we are here boiling in the heat.”

00:15:28.406 --> 00:15:30.716
They would have resented.

00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:34.140
But not the people who are beyond time.

00:15:34.418 --> 00:15:37.389
They are nicely sitting down, enjoying themselves.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:43.110
It doesn’t matter, the time passes on.

00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:50.887
Then you become dharmatit: you become beyond dharma,

00:15:51.752 --> 00:15:58.919
beyond your human nature.

00:16:00.073 --> 00:16:04.335
That means whatever you do is religious,

00:16:06.526 --> 00:16:11.094
whatever is your endeavor is religious.

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:15.856
If, say, you are in a business,

00:16:16.094 --> 00:16:20.117
you would like to do business in a religious manner,

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:25.127
because you are beyond religion you are not bothered as to

00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:29.579
follow a particular pattern or ritual of any religion,

00:16:29.961 --> 00:16:32.198
but you are beyond it.

00:16:32.333 --> 00:16:41.093
Like people who are, you see, not beyond religion:

00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:46.091
they must get up early in the morning,  they are bound

00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:51.280
by their rituals and they pass through the rituals,

00:16:51.305 --> 00:16:56.128
and if one of the rituals is not done
they are very unhappy and shaken up.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.790
But not you.

00:16:57.894 --> 00:17:01.014
For you, you are always in dhyan,

00:17:01.078 --> 00:17:05.641
always in meditative mood, and anything goes wrong

00:17:05.842 --> 00:17:08.868
you just jump into that awareness

00:17:08.948 --> 00:17:13.236
where you get the solution, and you are not disturbed,

00:17:13.453 --> 00:17:18.663
not disturbed at all when things go wrong.

00:17:18.853 --> 00:17:24.419
Like ritualistic nature makes you very constricted,

00:17:24.593 --> 00:17:28.799
very docile, sometimes can be aggressive also.

00:17:29.062 --> 00:17:33.305
People with their ritualism trouble others a lot.

00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:39.010
Like one lady who was supposed to be our friend came to My house.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.433
So she said, "I’m a vegetarian."
I said, "Then?"

00:17:42.512 --> 00:17:48.892
"But I can’t eat the food in which non–veg. food has been cooked."

00:17:49.604 --> 00:17:50.773
"All right.

00:17:50.798 --> 00:17:53.969
So we’ll have to get new utensils."

00:17:53.994 --> 00:17:56.943
So I went and bought new utensils for her.

00:17:56.976 --> 00:17:59.900
So she said that "You have to be careful

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.781
that even the spoon should not be used."

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:07.938
So I had to go and get for her a spoon.

00:18:07.963 --> 00:18:14.420
Then she said, "Tumblers; because people are taking food here

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:17.598
who are eating non–veg. food,

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:23.175
so you better get us something which is absolutely new."

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:26.227
So I had to incur all these problems.

00:18:26.473 --> 00:18:30.137
And then she was in the kitchen and she wouldn’t allow

00:18:30.215 --> 00:18:32.344
our cook to cook anything for us.

00:18:32.399 --> 00:18:35.735
She said, "First I will cook, and then you can cook."

00:18:35.838 --> 00:18:38.980
And she made such a nuisance out of her

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:43.186
that instead of being a guest she became a pest,

00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:47.410
and this is what happens to people who are ritualistic,

00:18:47.457 --> 00:18:49.942
because they are very demanding.

00:18:49.966 --> 00:18:53.692
They go on demanding that “This is our dharma.”

00:18:53.913 --> 00:18:59.756
I know of another story was told to Me by somebody in Bombay.

00:18:59.888 --> 00:19:03.690
She said, "This lady who came to me as a guest, because

00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:07.118
she was related to something very high up,

00:19:07.357 --> 00:19:11.790
she was worse than my great-great-great-grandmother."

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:13.625
I said, "Really?"

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.251
She said, "I can’t understand that in India

00:19:17.306 --> 00:19:19.798
we have such people still living.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:24.891
She came here and she said, ‘I cannot take water from the tap.

00:19:25.086 --> 00:19:28.846
You have to get it from some sort of a well.’

00:19:29.142 --> 00:19:32.633
“Now, there are only two wells in Bombay.

00:19:32.681 --> 00:19:36.202
So people had to go and fetch the water,

00:19:36.277 --> 00:19:40.967
but the cook had to be completely drenched in water

00:19:40.992 --> 00:19:43.349
and then only he could cook.

00:19:43.374 --> 00:19:46.783
“‘Because if he cooks without that, then I won’t eat.’

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:51.294
“And she went on, and on, and on there, and

00:19:51.384 --> 00:19:53.748
the cook got sick with pneumonia,

00:19:53.773 --> 00:19:57.677
another cook came and he got flu, you see?

00:19:57.702 --> 00:19:58.949
This lady didn’t mind.

00:19:58.949 --> 00:20:01.149
“She said, ‘No, that’s my style.’"

00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:05.428
So she asked Me, "What should we do with such people, Mother?"

00:20:05.453 --> 00:20:08.534
I said, "You should have asked her
that ‘We have this thing.

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:11.504
If you like it well and good; otherwise you don’t eat,

00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:15.692
it’s all right, good. Fasting is a very good thing.’

00:20:16.486 --> 00:20:21.265
That’s the only solution for such people who are so self-centered

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.773
and so much bothering others.”

00:20:24.821 --> 00:20:27.886
So this self-centeredness comes to us

00:20:27.902 --> 00:20:30.759
because we think, "This is our dharma,

00:20:30.784 --> 00:20:35.389
this is our right, this is - everything belongs to us.

00:20:35.414 --> 00:20:38.294
How dare they do not do it?"

00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:42.803
How much we trouble others, how much we make them inconvenient,

00:20:42.922 --> 00:20:50.150
how much we try to make their lives miserable,
we never think.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.111
We go on demanding things,

00:20:54.207 --> 00:20:58.183
“This is my dharma, what can I do?

00:20:58.597 --> 00:21:00.581
This is what I have to do.”

00:21:00.606 --> 00:21:03.907
But it becomes such a conditioning of the mind

00:21:04.312 --> 00:21:07.794
that I have seen many cases in Sahaja Yoga

00:21:07.819 --> 00:21:09.668
who got conditioned like that.

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:14.448
There was a lady, French lady who came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:14.529 --> 00:21:18.657
and her mother was very ritualistic to begin with,

00:21:18.887 --> 00:21:25.116
and she was so troublesome that she must go to church every Sunday.

00:21:25.408 --> 00:21:30.511
She would dress up well, go to church and come back home.

00:21:31.155 --> 00:21:33.625
And one day she just disappeared.

00:21:33.777 --> 00:21:36.821
So they told the police to find out this lady,

00:21:37.242 --> 00:21:40.753
and when he went to find out the lady,
the police said that

00:21:40.778 --> 00:21:44.121
"We can’t find her, God knows where she has disappeared."

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.711
Then she said, "All right, go and find out in the church."

00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:50.015
She was still sitting in the church.

00:21:50.146 --> 00:21:52.376
Next time again she disappeared.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.190
It happened three, four times.

00:21:54.215 --> 00:21:57.214
So the police said, "Sorry, we are finished with her.

00:21:57.239 --> 00:22:02.569
Now if you want you can put her in
the old people’s house, and that’s all."

00:22:02.865 --> 00:22:06.029
So they sent her to an old people’s house.

00:22:06.342 --> 00:22:10.826
So this Sahaja Yogini told Me, "Mother, very surprising,

00:22:10.945 --> 00:22:13.699
they are otherwise very stupid people,

00:22:13.786 --> 00:22:19.136
they go on sitting, brooding, talking nonsense like mad,

00:22:19.161 --> 00:22:24.404
they have all become senile and their senility can be very well seen.

00:22:24.483 --> 00:22:30.471
But what happens that on a Sunday
they all dress up well and go to church.

00:22:31.302 --> 00:22:34.872
That’s the only point where they are sane."

00:22:34.897 --> 00:22:38.272
It is very surprising how the conditioning works.

00:22:38.297 --> 00:22:41.098
There was one person I had

00:22:41.241 --> 00:22:45.304
who came and stayed with us, and he said, "I’m very good driver."

00:22:45.429 --> 00:22:46.912
So I said, "All right."

00:22:46.937 --> 00:22:49.621
But he only know driving, he didn’t know about London,

00:22:49.646 --> 00:22:51.947
what sort of a place London is.

00:22:52.013 --> 00:22:54.737
Now he knew the driving very well,

00:22:54.762 --> 00:22:59.288
but if I had to go to the north, he’ll drive Me to the south.

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:03.157
If I had to go to the east, he’ll drive Me to the west.

00:23:03.182 --> 00:23:04.758
I said, "What’s the matter?

00:23:04.758 --> 00:23:08.515
You know driving?"
"Yes, I know driving, that I know,

00:23:08.594 --> 00:23:12.389
but I don’t know anything about road, I have no road sense."

00:23:12.555 --> 00:23:14.383
One day the police got hold of him.

00:23:14.408 --> 00:23:15.883
I was also in the car.

00:23:15.908 --> 00:23:17.963
He said, "Where are you going?"

00:23:18.312 --> 00:23:21.406
He said, "I am going to such and such place."

00:23:21.431 --> 00:23:25.290
So he said, "Now you have been to this place six times.

00:23:25.315 --> 00:23:29.074
Again you are coming back to the same point six times!"

00:23:29.099 --> 00:23:33.476
So in the old age I have known that these things form

00:23:33.533 --> 00:23:35.619
a kind of a habit,

00:23:35.704 --> 00:23:39.449
but in young age also you can find people

00:23:39.545 --> 00:23:42.600
get so conditioned by their style.

00:23:42.691 --> 00:23:48.056
So this is what you can call the human element,

00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:53.391
where you get attached or get bothered about something.

00:23:54.439 --> 00:24:00.123
Now it’s a kind of a, I should say, a madness

00:24:00.362 --> 00:24:03.631
that somebody demands this, somebody demands that,

00:24:03.663 --> 00:24:06.739
"I don’t like this, I don’t like that."

00:24:06.739 --> 00:24:09.284
It goes on, and on, and on.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:14.511
It’s so common to say "I don’t like,” “I like."

00:24:14.882 --> 00:24:19.221
It is very surprising that they go on saying like this.

00:24:19.246 --> 00:24:23.407
They go to somebody’s house, "No, no, I don’t like this carpet."

00:24:23.432 --> 00:24:27.255
I mean, it’s not your carpet, you’ve not purchased it.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.175
This person has purchased the carpet.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.113
What have you got to do?

00:24:31.138 --> 00:24:32.816
Why should you say "I don’t like"?

00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:33.944
Who are you?

00:24:33.969 --> 00:24:35.430
You have not paid for you.

00:24:35.455 --> 00:24:38.583
The one who has paid likes it, finished!

00:24:38.702 --> 00:24:41.911
Why do you want to pass your remarks, "I don’t like it"?

00:24:41.936 --> 00:24:45.202
Are you a connoisseur, so to criticize others?

00:24:45.438 --> 00:24:49.280
Somebody is wearing, supposing, the hairdress in a way,

00:24:49.431 --> 00:24:52.521
but "I don’t like this kind of hairdress."

00:24:52.601 --> 00:24:53.787
"Why?"

00:24:53.812 --> 00:24:57.690
"I don’t like, that’s all."

00:25:04.263 --> 00:25:07.797
Then it goes from there to human beings and everyone.

00:25:07.972 --> 00:25:12.046
Who are you to like or dislike?

00:25:12.308 --> 00:25:14.252
What is your position?

00:25:14.363 --> 00:25:19.305
Why should you say “I like” or “don’t like”?

00:25:20.267 --> 00:25:23.333
But is very common, specially in the West,

00:25:23.524 --> 00:25:27.864
to pass such remarks, "I don’t like it."

00:25:28.231 --> 00:25:29.991
"I don’t like India."

00:25:30.016 --> 00:25:32.119
"All right, if you don’t like, sit at home.

00:25:32.144 --> 00:25:33.857
Why did you come here?"

00:25:33.906 --> 00:25:36.032
"I don’t like Turkey."

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.627
"Why?"

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:42.816
Because if supposing anybody is wearing a long skirt,

00:25:42.893 --> 00:25:47.414
they’ll say, "No, I don’t like it because it is Turkish."

00:25:47.945 --> 00:25:50.870
So you should only wear short skirts.

00:25:51.148 --> 00:25:54.232
But we don’t like short skirts, supposing.

00:25:54.257 --> 00:25:57.460
But one should not say that "I don’t like it,"

00:25:57.485 --> 00:26:03.108
because it hurts people, it takes awaythe pride of the person.

00:26:04.338 --> 00:26:08.060
Now when you are in Sahaja Yoga

00:26:08.092 --> 00:26:12.270
you must know that you are not normal human being,

00:26:12.295 --> 00:26:17.677
according to the normal standards, you see, you are above them.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.200
Your likes and dislikes are different from theirs,

00:26:22.399 --> 00:26:25.280
and your whole attitude has changed.

00:26:25.957 --> 00:26:30.629
You are, sometimes you are just like children, I have seen.

00:26:31.203 --> 00:26:36.032
You talk like small little children, very innocently,

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:39.885
and sometimes you talk very profound things.

00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:44.469
Now this is unknown to people who are supposed to be normal,

00:26:44.557 --> 00:26:48.423
because normal people, you know, they are so bombastic,

00:26:48.448 --> 00:26:53.908
all the time they go on saying "I, I, I."

00:26:54.974 --> 00:27:03.180
Kabira has said that when a goat is living,

00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:08.036
she goes on saying "meh, meh, meh," means "I, I, I."

00:27:08.613 --> 00:27:15.348
But when she is dead and her intestines are drawn into

00:27:15.833 --> 00:27:23.095
a kind of a wire for, we call dhunak - means

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.252
“with which they separate the seeds from the cotton"

00:27:27.324 --> 00:27:31.090
- that time, what she says, "tu hi, tu hi, tu hi”:

00:27:31.115 --> 00:27:37.462
“you are, you are, you are." You are...

00:27:38.899 --> 00:27:45.549
When you say that, immediately
your attention goes away from others,

00:27:45.717 --> 00:27:50.271
finding faults with them, finding what’s wrong with them,

00:27:50.358 --> 00:27:54.898
using your brains all the time to criticize others,

00:27:55.266 --> 00:28:00.484
to make fun of others, sometimes even to talk ill of others.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.741
People enjoy gossips.

00:28:02.845 --> 00:28:04.082
Why?

00:28:04.123 --> 00:28:06.319
They enjoy gossip

00:28:06.423 --> 00:28:11.399
because they don’t know that another person is the same as myself,

00:28:11.743 --> 00:28:15.356
and I have no business to gossip about that person.

00:28:15.381 --> 00:28:19.419
So this understanding, I should say this loving

00:28:19.444 --> 00:28:24.080
wisdom doesn’t exist when you are a normal human being.

00:28:24.363 --> 00:28:29.135
At the slightest provocation you can get angry,

00:28:29.264 --> 00:28:34.173
start doing all kinds of things just like a bull in the

00:28:34.515 --> 00:28:37.205
china shop, you can behave any way.

00:28:37.356 --> 00:28:41.179
Suddenly you’ll find them just growing up into that.

00:28:41.204 --> 00:28:45.414
The reason for that is, you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

00:28:46.097 --> 00:28:50.761
But Sahaja Yogi is a person who enjoys all kinds of things.

00:28:51.595 --> 00:28:57.298
Say somebody becomes very angry and hot-tempered.

00:28:58.001 --> 00:29:05.086
He also sees that what is happening, how he is behaving.

00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:11.611
So, actually it is not a dharma
that you get angry with someone, it’s not.

00:29:11.682 --> 00:29:16.583
It is something very low to be angry with others,

00:29:16.589 --> 00:29:21.862
to be all the time shouting at others,
to be exacting things from others

00:29:21.887 --> 00:29:27.186
or to criticize others, thinking you are something great.

00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:29.093
And this doesn’t pay.

00:29:29.965 --> 00:29:32.848
By the time you come to the end of life you’ll find

00:29:32.872 --> 00:29:36.388
you haven’t got one friend, one neighbor.

00:29:37.612 --> 00:29:42.500
Another thing is that when you are very egoistical,

00:29:43.151 --> 00:29:45.616
you think no end of yourself

00:29:45.712 --> 00:29:49.762
and you go on talking, jabbering, talking, jabbering,

00:29:49.897 --> 00:29:52.991
and the another person just gets bored stiff;

00:29:53.228 --> 00:29:56.535
but still you are talking, talking, talking about yourself,

00:29:56.585 --> 00:29:59.223
"I did this, I did this, I went there.

00:29:59.248 --> 00:30:01.368
I, I, I…"

00:30:03.085 --> 00:30:09.249
It goes to any limit,
and you are not ashamed as to what you are saying.

00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:16.765
I have seen people who have taken to all kinds of

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:23.685
funny attitudes towards others,
when they are just normal human beings.

00:30:24.624 --> 00:30:30.915
If somebody says something wrong about somebody,
somebody says that

00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:35.412
"That person is like this, I know, you see he did this way."

00:30:35.437 --> 00:30:39.577
Immediately it goes into their mind, "Yes, it’s so."

00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:46.491
Now that makes your mind a sick mind,

00:30:47.293 --> 00:30:52.268
we can say vikrudh, where the mind is not normal.

00:30:52.491 --> 00:30:56.341
You become sick, and you accept all this sickness

00:30:56.444 --> 00:31:03.724
and go on accepting it, accepting it till you are a sick person,

00:31:04.207 --> 00:31:09.019
and this sickness is extremely dangerous.

00:31:09.154 --> 00:31:12.071
Not for others so much as for yourself,

00:31:12.206 --> 00:31:16.460
because nobody can stand such a sick personality.

00:31:16.887 --> 00:31:22.777
Now you might say, I’ve seen people who have taken to religion.

00:31:23.086 --> 00:31:29.248
Like now I am a religious person, supposing now.

00:31:31.082 --> 00:31:34.756
You better be religious, so what?

00:31:34.781 --> 00:31:37.034
You can’t do this, you can’t do that,

00:31:37.106 --> 00:31:41.647
you cannot sit here, you cannot eat this, this is important:

00:31:41.672 --> 00:31:47.083
all try type the discipline others,
instead of disciplining yourself.

00:31:47.607 --> 00:31:51.786
Because when you are a normal person you don’t see yourself,

00:31:52.295 --> 00:31:56.750
you just see others; but once you are a realized soul,

00:31:56.781 --> 00:32:02.512
you just start watching yourself and see for yourself what’s wrong.

00:32:03.431 --> 00:32:10.195
Now after becoming the Spirit,
in the light of the Spirit you see yourself.

00:32:11.203 --> 00:32:13.099
You just see yourself.

00:32:13.817 --> 00:32:17.167
What happens, how you behave

00:32:17.292 --> 00:32:23.461
and how you enjoy yourself, when you know how to correct yourself.

00:32:23.723 --> 00:32:25.603
It’s very sweet.

00:32:25.953 --> 00:32:30.273
Little, little things you do in such a beautiful manner,

00:32:30.337 --> 00:32:33.352
and you’ll say such beautiful things.

00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:40.194
Of course there are people
who cannot be corrected, they’re incorrigible.

00:32:40.219 --> 00:32:45.548
So also you should just see this is incorrigible, you can’t help it.

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:48.538
Like in Sahaja Yoga we have some people

00:32:48.602 --> 00:32:52.541
who are all the time trying to help the wrong type of people,

00:32:52.861 --> 00:32:57.275
like they have taken a power of attorney in Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:01.354
So if somebody tries to be funny,

00:33:01.529 --> 00:33:05.045
we expect a telephone call from that power of attorney.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:08.329
After two hours, he tells, “Now,

00:33:08.354 --> 00:33:12.759
please tell Mother that such and such person is to be looked after.

00:33:12.784 --> 00:33:14.959
This has to be done, that has to be done.”

00:33:14.959 --> 00:33:18.163
It’s absolutely a habitual thing with them

00:33:18.188 --> 00:33:22.327
to inform Me that “No, You must help, You must do something.”

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.222
But now it has become such a common practice,

00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:30.000
and we know that he will just now come along

00:33:30.039 --> 00:33:33.196
and give us a big lecture on this subject.

00:33:33.401 --> 00:33:38.796
So you see, it’s a nature of a human being

00:33:38.852 --> 00:33:43.881
which has been going through the different types of

00:33:44.229 --> 00:33:51.126
complications in life,  also born with some genes or something

00:33:51.259 --> 00:33:57.247
that he is not a very normal person, though we say he’s normal;

00:33:57.405 --> 00:34:03.822
because the way he reacts, the reaction that he shows is very absurd.

00:34:03.933 --> 00:34:08.407
There’s no need for anybody to telephone to Me, to tell Me

00:34:08.432 --> 00:34:15.060
that “You see, this man is such and such, You better look after him.”

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:20.130
Unnecessarily to interfere with others’ affairs

00:34:20.313 --> 00:34:23.138
when you have no authority,

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:27.094
when you have nothing to do with that person.

00:34:27.185 --> 00:34:31.608
All sorts of, I can tell you, designs are there that

00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:35.865
has been made into the minds of human beings,

00:34:35.984 --> 00:34:40.473
and these designs all disappear, just disappear.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.207
I don’t know how they get all these designs, from where they get it -

00:34:44.279 --> 00:34:48.738
maybe their country, maybe their family, maybe their genes -

00:34:48.763 --> 00:34:53.887
whatever you may say, all this disappears, even your genes change.

00:34:54.253 --> 00:35:00.889
That is what is Sahaja Yoga,
where you become the Spirit; everything changes.

00:35:01.184 --> 00:35:06.125
And what happens to you, that you become

00:35:06.403 --> 00:35:11.792
a person who knows what is joy, who enjoys joy,

00:35:11.817 --> 00:35:16.354
who enjoys existence, who gives joy to others,

00:35:16.379 --> 00:35:21.909
makes others happy, all the time thinks how to make others happy.

00:35:22.075 --> 00:35:24.243
Just it happens,

00:35:24.331 --> 00:35:27.802
though you are brought up the same way as others are,

00:35:27.827 --> 00:35:31.889
though you are being educated the same way,  maybe;

00:35:32.087 --> 00:35:39.294
but all that disappears
and you become a wise, beautiful joyous person.

00:35:41.292 --> 00:35:45.590
It’s something that you have achieved, of which you may not be aware,

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:50.600
the way you are enjoying in this scout-ground.

00:35:50.823 --> 00:35:53.988
No other group could have enjoyed as you have enjoyed.

00:35:54.043 --> 00:35:57.936
I can see what you are doing here and how you are enjoying,

00:35:58.254 --> 00:36:01.674
how you are enjoying the company of others,
it’s very remarkable;

00:36:01.975 --> 00:36:07.292
and that has come because your heart is full of joy

00:36:07.387 --> 00:36:10.014
of the Spirit that shines within you.

00:36:10.464 --> 00:36:13.446
You can examine yourself and see for yourself

00:36:13.486 --> 00:36:17.001
whatever I‘m saying is there or not of course,

00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:20.189
There are some people who think no end of themself,

00:36:20.214 --> 00:36:23.864
they are staying in a hotel or some lodge, or something.

00:36:23.999 --> 00:36:25.537
They are not enjoying.

00:36:26.085 --> 00:36:28.694
They still think that they are something great,

00:36:28.773 --> 00:36:32.804
so they must stay somewhere like that.

00:36:33.003 --> 00:36:35.891
Very surprisingly, specially Indians I have seen,

00:36:35.916 --> 00:36:41.735
when they come to Cabella they all want to stay in a hotel.

00:36:41.861 --> 00:36:46.211
In their lives they might be having one bathroom in their house,

00:36:46.369 --> 00:36:49.739
but when they come to Cabella they want to stay in a hotel

00:36:49.764 --> 00:36:53.223
with attached bath,  this, that;

00:36:54.463 --> 00:36:57.170
young people, it’s very surprising.

00:36:57.274 --> 00:37:01.201
It happens because I think they have never seen a good hotel,

00:37:01.226 --> 00:37:04.600
or may be that they have lived in a very bad condition.

00:37:04.671 --> 00:37:10.503
But a person who is a Sahaja Yogi
can live anywhere, can sleep anywhere.

00:37:11.116 --> 00:37:17.065
Only thing is that his Spirit is there to make him happy,
nothing else.

00:37:17.302 --> 00:37:20.347
That is the One that gives you happiness.

00:37:20.372 --> 00:37:26.822
All these other ideas that human beings have,
which have created problems after problems.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:33.569
Now you see, because you belong to a different religion, you are bad.

00:37:33.837 --> 00:37:36.559
If you want to know about the Christians,

00:37:36.615 --> 00:37:39.626
you’d better go and ask the Jews;

00:37:39.651 --> 00:37:43.657
and if you want to know about the Jews, better go and ask the Muslims;

00:37:43.682 --> 00:37:47.961
and if you want to know about the Muslims, go and ask the Hindus.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.438
You’ll be amazed how they talk about other people

00:37:52.525 --> 00:37:55.785
as if all of them are bad, and they are the best.

00:37:55.833 --> 00:38:00.969
So this whole attitude changes completely.

00:38:01.205 --> 00:38:06.221
You forget it: who is what, whose religion is what,

00:38:06.246 --> 00:38:11.966
from what sort of family they come in,
from what is the background they are coming in.

00:38:12.078 --> 00:38:15.270
They become just one with each other.

00:38:15.455 --> 00:38:19.725
What they enjoy is the company of all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:38:20.059 --> 00:38:23.263
All the Sahaja Yogis are there, that’s all.

00:38:23.342 --> 00:38:27.562
So many Sahaja Yogis will be there, and that is the Mecca,

00:38:27.614 --> 00:38:32.648
that is the Kumbha Mela, that you can call anything if you like.

00:38:32.758 --> 00:38:36.597
The collective joy that you enjoy has come to you

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:40.615
because you have crossed, crossed thatbarrier

00:38:40.695 --> 00:38:45.120
which has stopped you from seeing the truth.

00:38:45.501 --> 00:38:50.309
The truth is, as I said yesterday, that you are the Spirit,

00:38:50.334 --> 00:38:58.725
and once you become the Spirit
you become gunatit, kalatit and dharmatit.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:05.236
Once you cross these limits, then you become like a drop in the ocean.

00:39:05.374 --> 00:39:08.649
If the drop is outside the ocean,

00:39:08.727 --> 00:39:12.584
it’s always frightened of the sun because it will dry it up;

00:39:12.895 --> 00:39:17.155
he doesn’t know what to do, which way to slip, which way to move.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.730
But once it is one with the ocean, it just moves

00:39:20.755 --> 00:39:24.899
and enjoy because he’s not alone, it’s not alone.

00:39:24.924 --> 00:39:30.873
It’s moving with the waves of that beautiful ocean of joy.

00:39:31.143 --> 00:39:35.292
And that is what you have achieved, of which you are aware;

00:39:35.317 --> 00:39:38.144
you know, but you don’t know you have achieved it,

00:39:38.192 --> 00:39:40.715
because you are the Spirit.

00:39:41.665 --> 00:39:44.033
Now you should be on the watch

00:39:44.668 --> 00:39:49.908
about yourself sometimes,
and you’d be amazed to see how you are changed,

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:56.425
how you have become so simple and sensible and wise.

00:39:56.882 --> 00:40:00.339
So many problems come in the West because

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:05.152
they are still stupid, I think, very stupid people.

00:40:05.278 --> 00:40:10.817
Because even an old man of eighty years

00:40:10.881 --> 00:40:16.198
would like to marry a lady who seen 20 years

00:40:16.729 --> 00:40:20.679
and he doesn’t understand why he is doing it,

00:40:21.458 --> 00:40:24.632
because he doesn’t accept his age,

00:40:24.699 --> 00:40:29.589
he doesn’t accept that "I am an old man,
I must behave like an old man."

00:40:30.013 --> 00:40:36.851
He wants to marry a girl who can be his granddaughter.

00:40:37.208 --> 00:40:39.575
This is more common in the West.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.340
They always think like that.

00:40:41.365 --> 00:40:45.044
Any young girl they see, they think they should marry that girl.

00:40:45.273 --> 00:40:50.535
They may be just on their way to the grave,

00:40:50.694 --> 00:40:54.271
but doesn’t matter, they want to have a wife like that.

00:40:54.359 --> 00:40:56.558
This is the problem of the West.

00:40:56.653 --> 00:40:58.397
Now how does it come?

00:40:58.422 --> 00:41:03.461
Because they don’t understand that we are old,

00:41:03.803 --> 00:41:06.176
and to be old is to be proud.

00:41:06.201 --> 00:41:08.799
Now when I was five years,

00:41:08.824 --> 00:41:13.842
I cannot imagine so many people could have
come to wish Me a happy birthday.

00:41:14.112 --> 00:41:17.442
Even when I was fifty years there were not so many people.

00:41:17.467 --> 00:41:23.105
Now when I am seventy-five, see
how many people are there to wish Me happy birthday!

00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:27.414
When you are old you should be proud of your age,

00:41:27.597 --> 00:41:31.441
if you have lived wisely; but if you have been stupid,

00:41:31.466 --> 00:41:33.852
then of course nobody can help.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:39.298
Everybody will laugh at such a person,
but they will do the same thing.

00:41:39.473 --> 00:41:44.765
It’s a custom in the West to go on having wives after wives,

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.077
divorcing your wife and this, that.

00:41:47.797 --> 00:41:50.375
In India it’s the other way round I should say,

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.336
they don’t have much respect for the women.

00:41:54.392 --> 00:41:59.161
They were supposed to have great respect for women,

00:41:59.186 --> 00:42:04.308
supposed to have placed their women at the pedestal of a sati,

00:42:04.467 --> 00:42:08.733
and even if the woman may be anything, they don’t respect.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.395
Now this is from where it has come, I don’t know.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:18.206
Some of them say that it is written by some poet

00:42:19.016 --> 00:42:20.684
that a woman should be beaten up.

00:42:20.709 --> 00:42:21.979
I mean, who is this poet?

00:42:21.979 --> 00:42:25.179
He should be beaten up I think, first of all.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:31.125
He was born out of a woman, and here he writes like this.

00:42:31.281 --> 00:42:36.486
So you see, we like to take up something which is wrong,

00:42:36.772 --> 00:42:39.216
which is absolutely absurd.

00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:43.729
This comes because you are not wise.

00:42:44.057 --> 00:42:49.084
A wise person will take in whatever is the wisdom.

00:42:49.799 --> 00:42:53.225
He won’t accept anything nonsensical.

00:42:53.355 --> 00:42:57.333
You go on reading the books one after another, one after another.

00:42:57.492 --> 00:43:01.569
So many books you read, and where do you land up with that?

00:43:01.659 --> 00:43:05.851
You find you are reading books which are no good for you,

00:43:05.876 --> 00:43:10.518
useless, but if you are fond of reading, you go on reading.

00:43:11.867 --> 00:43:19.732
So the lack of wisdom gives you indiscrimination

00:43:20.201 --> 00:43:23.772
and you justify it, all that you justify

00:43:23.797 --> 00:43:26.109
and you say, "Now this is very good.

00:43:26.134 --> 00:43:28.460
Whatever I am doing is the best.”

00:43:28.485 --> 00:43:33.451
It’s not ego, I would say, but stupid human understanding.

00:43:33.975 --> 00:43:37.020
"Whatever I am doing is good.

00:43:37.045 --> 00:43:39.965
Whatever is my attitude is good.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:44.900
How dare anybody tell me anything that this is wrong, that is wrong?"

00:43:45.049 --> 00:43:48.939
Everybody will laugh at that person, make fun of that person.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.599
Such a person will suffer a lot, everything.

00:43:51.624 --> 00:43:56.769
But he will never accept that "I have done something wrong."

00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:01.831
So when you go beyond dharmatit you become, go beyond dharma,

00:44:01.856 --> 00:44:06.068
then what happens that dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

00:44:06.694 --> 00:44:11.244
You don’t do wrong things, you just don’t do it.

00:44:11.689 --> 00:44:15.107
It’s not that somebody is telling you or you want to follow it,

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.958
or there is compulsion or you are disciplined,

00:44:17.983 --> 00:44:21.884
but you just don’t like to do wrong things, to say something

00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:27.010
which is not respectful, which is not helpful, which is not loving.

00:44:27.271 --> 00:44:31.196
This is the quality of a Sahaja Yogi,

00:44:31.244 --> 00:44:33.966
where you become the Spirit.

00:44:34.191 --> 00:44:37.353
Becoming the Spirit, you don’t have to tell anybody,

00:44:37.409 --> 00:44:41.116
so obvious, so evident and one can see that,

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:45.816
and the more you go deep into yourself, you find that

00:44:45.903 --> 00:44:51.500
you are endowed with such greatness within you,

00:44:51.525 --> 00:44:57.047
such beautiful feelings, such nice things within you

00:44:57.072 --> 00:45:01.495
that you overcome the ego of others.

00:45:01.654 --> 00:45:03.374
I must tell you a story.

00:45:03.399 --> 00:45:06.937
Once I went to see a saint.

00:45:07.132 --> 00:45:08.339
So the Sahaja Yogis said,

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.603
"Mother, You never go and see these gurus and this and that,

00:45:11.659 --> 00:45:13.994
so why do You go?"
I said, "You come along with Me."

00:45:14.019 --> 00:45:15.518
So we had to climb a lot.

00:45:15.543 --> 00:45:17.495
I said, "From here you see his vibrations.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.141
First you see his vibrations.”

00:45:19.648 --> 00:45:22.286
So lots of vibrations were coming.

00:45:22.311 --> 00:45:26.552
So we went up the hill, climbed up.

00:45:26.867 --> 00:45:31.600
And this gentleman was supposed to have powers

00:45:31.688 --> 00:45:37.771
that he could control the rain, and it started raining,

00:45:37.882 --> 00:45:43.028
and raining very heavily,
and I got completely drenched in that rain.

00:45:43.149 --> 00:45:46.664
When I went up I saw him sitting on a stone,

00:45:46.689 --> 00:45:50.222
just shaking his head with anger or I don’t know what.

00:45:50.707 --> 00:45:53.590
So I went into his cave and sat down.

00:45:54.392 --> 00:45:59.637
So he came back, he came back and he said to Me,

00:45:59.662 --> 00:46:04.687
"Mother, why didn’t You allow me to stop the rain?

00:46:04.838 --> 00:46:08.103
Is it to overcome my ego?"

00:46:08.128 --> 00:46:12.277
I said, "No, not that, I didn’t want,

00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:16.997
I didn’t see your ego anywhere; but the problem is the another.

00:46:17.163 --> 00:46:20.690
You are a sanyasi, you are a one who are an ascetic,

00:46:20.715 --> 00:46:22.355
you bought a sari for Me.

00:46:22.484 --> 00:46:26.958
Now if you bought a sari for Me,
I can’t take from you because you’re a sanyasi.

00:46:26.983 --> 00:46:32.440
So I had to get drenched,
so that I will have to borrow sari from you."

00:46:32.465 --> 00:46:36.665
And the whole thing melted away.

00:46:36.888 --> 00:46:39.788
He became a very different person.

00:46:39.813 --> 00:46:44.866
So with wisdom you know how to handle different types of people.

00:46:44.952 --> 00:46:51.840
You say things by which you melt their ego.

00:46:52.005 --> 00:47:01.454
Their conditionings also are brought into a kind of a new awakening.

00:47:02.605 --> 00:47:08.656
They see in you that wisdom, that love, that expression of,

00:47:08.799 --> 00:47:11.307
I should say, your Spirit.

00:47:11.513 --> 00:47:18.446
And that’s how so many saints,
though they were tortured and troubled by many,

00:47:18.485 --> 00:47:23.769
but they were definitely very much respected and loved.

00:47:24.183 --> 00:47:33.027
But those saints in those days, I must say,
were definitely very nice and good people,

00:47:33.135 --> 00:47:40.345
but one thing was there: they were rather strict
and disciplining with their disciples.

00:47:40.487 --> 00:47:45.265
The reason was that they were not realized souls, their disciples,

00:47:45.321 --> 00:47:50.864
and these gurus thought that “Unless and until
ou discipline these people,

00:47:50.975 --> 00:47:54.448
they’ll never rise, they’ll never become something great,

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:56.634
so they have to be disciplined.”

00:47:56.659 --> 00:47:59.821
And those who were seekers of truth accepted

00:47:59.846 --> 00:48:03.468
that "All right, whatever you say, we’ll do.

00:48:03.572 --> 00:48:06.184
Even if you ask us to fast, we’ll do it.”

00:48:06.209 --> 00:48:09.038
They’ll stand on their heads, “All right, stand on our heads.

00:48:09.038 --> 00:48:12.363
Do what you say, and we will be willing to do it.

00:48:12.388 --> 00:48:14.952
You don’t have to worry on that point."

00:48:14.977 --> 00:48:17.964
And that’s how they were very disciplining type.

00:48:17.989 --> 00:48:21.469
But in Sahaja Yoga there is no discipline taught.

00:48:21.753 --> 00:48:25.044
The reason is, you are realized souls,

00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:29.797
your Spirit is there and the Spirit gives you the light.

00:48:29.916 --> 00:48:35.746
In that light you see yourself so clearly,
and you can discipline yourself.

00:48:35.848 --> 00:48:37.738
I don’t have to tell you.

00:48:37.763 --> 00:48:42.326
You know that so many people have given up drugs overnight,

00:48:42.366 --> 00:48:45.237
but I never told them, I never even talked about  drugs

00:48:45.262 --> 00:48:48.182
or anything, and how did they do it?

00:48:48.207 --> 00:48:52.843
Because they had the light, and this is what is you have got today,

00:48:52.868 --> 00:48:55.157
is the light of the Spirit.

00:48:55.221 --> 00:48:58.495
You become absolutely independent

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:02.503
and absolutely free; complete freedom,

00:49:02.551 --> 00:49:05.052
because you have the light.

00:49:05.163 --> 00:49:10.833
You cannot do, you cannot do wrong things.

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.339
Supposing now there is light,

00:49:16.879 --> 00:49:22.395
and there is some sort of a big explosion taking place.

00:49:22.622 --> 00:49:25.670
I won’t run towards the explosion, no.

00:49:25.741 --> 00:49:30.384
You won’t run either, because you have got the eyes.

00:49:30.409 --> 00:49:35.469
So the Spirit and its light is the greatest guiding factor

00:49:35.795 --> 00:49:40.342
by which you become, as I said, gunatit,

00:49:42.448 --> 00:49:48.609
you become kalatit, and you become dharmatit.

00:49:49.211 --> 00:49:51.515
You are not slave of anything.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:55.285
You are not slave of your watch, you are not slave of time,

00:49:55.310 --> 00:50:00.446
you are not slave as to what is your gunas are.

00:50:00.572 --> 00:50:05.849
You don’t want to see whether
you are right-sided, left-sided or centered.

00:50:06.137 --> 00:50:13.945
You are a Sahaja Yogi, and a Sahaja Yogi is beyond all these things,
so you are gunatit.

00:50:14.252 --> 00:50:18.601
You are dharmatit because dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

00:50:18.656 --> 00:50:23.307
You don’t have to follow any disciplining of dharma.

00:50:23.332 --> 00:50:29.341
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga, in some of the ashrams
they are very strict.

00:50:29.571 --> 00:50:30.784
That should not be so.

00:50:30.809 --> 00:50:33.116
I have told them never to be strict.

00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:37.495
If somebody doesn’t get up at, say, four o’clock, doesn’t matter.

00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:39.798
Let him get up at ten o’clock.

00:50:39.873 --> 00:50:43.732
After some time he himself will get up at four,

00:50:43.765 --> 00:50:46.627
but don’t try to discipline them too much.

00:50:46.746 --> 00:50:49.766
Children also you should not discipline too much.

00:50:49.924 --> 00:50:54.760
Of course if they are realized souls, they themselves are so good,

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.257
they are so beautiful.

00:50:56.282 --> 00:50:59.437
But if they are not, try to give them Realization.

00:50:59.462 --> 00:51:03.064
Once you realize that those who are not realized

00:51:03.128 --> 00:51:07.420
are making all these mistakes, that they are in the darkness,

00:51:07.445 --> 00:51:11.156
your attitude towards them will change.

00:51:11.256 --> 00:51:15.845
You will just try to be extremely patient

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:20.297
and kind, and affectionate and loving,

00:51:20.362 --> 00:51:23.494
because you will know that person is not realized.

00:51:23.645 --> 00:51:28.279
He has not got his eyes, he can’t see, he is blind,

00:51:28.304 --> 00:51:34.071
he can’t hear, he can’t feel the reality.

00:51:34.332 --> 00:51:36.833
So first let him feel the reality.

00:51:36.858 --> 00:51:39.971
What is the use of giving him a lecture and disciplining?

00:51:39.996 --> 00:51:45.176
Still he’ll go on making mistakes
and troubling himself, or troubling others.

00:51:45.201 --> 00:51:47.515
So this is what you have achieved

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:52.540
through your enlightenment, that you are beyond all these things.

00:51:53.207 --> 00:51:57.035
And you become a person of a temperament

00:51:57.107 --> 00:52:02.971
which is so loving and so joy-giving.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:08.663
I mean, it’s so many examples I can give in Sahaja Yoga
which has happened,

00:52:08.732 --> 00:52:13.542
that I have seen the beauty of their love and affection,

00:52:13.567 --> 00:52:17.523
not only towards Me, but only towards others also.

00:52:17.548 --> 00:52:23.194
Only if it is only towards Me I can explain it,

00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:28.553
but I can’t explain the way they are kind to people,
as I told you yesterday,

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:30.805
that these people went to Israel,

00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:34.299
now they went to Egypt, they went to Russia.

00:52:34.324 --> 00:52:35.308
Who told them?

00:52:35.308 --> 00:52:37.684
I never asked anybody to go anywhere.

00:52:37.709 --> 00:52:41.250
On their own they felt they have to go  and do this job,

00:52:41.275 --> 00:52:46.809
and they have to help people to get out of their ignorance.

00:52:48.122 --> 00:52:52.609
So today, on such a day when you are celebrating

00:52:52.752 --> 00:52:57.505
My seventy-fifth Birthday, and so many balloons are there -

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:18.325
they are very remarkably, very picturesque

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:24.012
and have colors of different types, expressing your love for Me.

00:53:25.356 --> 00:53:28.248
In everything I see your love.

00:53:28.369 --> 00:53:32.700
Whatever you have done here, all your decorations, everything,

00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:38.303
I feel My children are so loving.

00:53:38.685 --> 00:53:43.761
I have done nothing for you,
I don’t know what makes you feel such gratitude.

00:53:43.904 --> 00:53:46.409
I still want to know, what have I done?

00:53:46.434 --> 00:53:47.940
I have done nothing!

00:53:47.965 --> 00:53:51.010
But the way you want to express your love,

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:55.497
it’s very surprising; except for, I would say,

00:53:55.522 --> 00:54:00.182
that you got the light of your Spirit.

00:54:00.281 --> 00:54:05.334
In that light, might be you see something different in Me,

00:54:06.406 --> 00:54:13.128
but the way you are showing your gratitude is really beyond Me.

00:54:13.254 --> 00:54:16.149
As the other day, one of the speakers said that

00:54:16.174 --> 00:54:18.904
“You don’t thank your mother, take her for granted.”

00:54:18.929 --> 00:54:20.009
It’s a fact.

00:54:20.182 --> 00:54:23.972
There’s no need to thank Me, you have to take Me for granted.

00:54:23.997 --> 00:54:27.555
But the way you want to thank Me, just like a

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:32.741
small little child would like to thank, you just become like children.

00:54:32.988 --> 00:54:35.582
You’re so enthusiastic about it,

00:54:35.614 --> 00:54:41.940
and you don’t understand that
normally is not done like this anywhere;

00:54:42.035 --> 00:54:47.959
nobody tries to be just like children expressing
their beautiful love.

00:54:48.401 --> 00:54:53.553
It’s a very new thing that one can see.

00:54:53.702 --> 00:54:59.260
Such peace, such love, such joy all around

00:54:59.554 --> 00:55:04.837
in a far-fetched place like this, how could you do that?

00:55:05.271 --> 00:55:07.080
How could you manage that?

00:55:07.405 --> 00:55:14.646
It’s not easy to understand,
it’s not for human beings to see that.

00:55:15.334 --> 00:55:19.116
They just don’t understand how these people are like this,

00:55:19.156 --> 00:55:23.495
and why are they living like this so happily?

00:55:23.946 --> 00:55:29.396
Now you have comforts in the house,
you are living so well in your houses,

00:55:29.547 --> 00:55:32.650
everything is there, but here in this scout-ground

00:55:32.667 --> 00:55:35.440
it’s not such a comfortable place to live.

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:38.446
But you can live anywhere, I know, I have seen it.

00:55:38.471 --> 00:55:41.604
Wherever you are, as long as there are Sahaja Yogis around,

00:55:41.652 --> 00:55:43.739
you don’t care for anything.

00:55:43.764 --> 00:55:48.920
And this collective enjoyment of each other,

00:55:49.071 --> 00:55:52.443
without any expectation, without any criticism,

00:55:52.468 --> 00:55:57.488
without any gossip or any nonsense like that, is so beautiful.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:01.775
And even when you pull each other’s legs,
you know, I enjoy your jokes

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:08.475
and understand that it’s such friendship,
such beautiful friendship.

00:56:08.593 --> 00:56:15.096
Whether you are from India or from England
or from America, or from any other place,

00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:19.276
you find there’s such oneness of understanding,

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:25.527
oneness of movement,  like one waves rises

00:56:25.552 --> 00:56:29.182
and another wave rises, and another wave rises.

00:56:29.207 --> 00:56:37.365
It’s continuous, eternal, and this is
what one has to achieve for others also.

00:56:37.598 --> 00:56:43.112
For that also, must remember that
you have the light; others don’t have.

00:56:43.158 --> 00:56:48.592
So you have to be very considerate, tolerant and understanding

00:56:48.617 --> 00:56:53.463
about their problem, and just listen to them.

00:56:53.549 --> 00:56:54.876
What is their problem?

00:56:54.901 --> 00:56:59.768
First they’ll tell you that “My business is going down,”

00:56:59.824 --> 00:57:04.927
or they might say that  “My wife is no good,”

00:57:05.006 --> 00:57:09.773
or “My son has no job, he is not working.”

00:57:09.808 --> 00:57:12.309
All kinds of things they might tell you.

00:57:12.334 --> 00:57:16.672
Listen, listen to them, for them it is important, all right.

00:57:16.697 --> 00:57:22.930
After that you will find gradually, you see,
they’ll soothe down

00:57:23.058 --> 00:57:28.377
because you are emitting love,  you are emitting joy,

00:57:28.409 --> 00:57:35.037
you are emitting confidence through your spiritual awakening.

00:57:35.062 --> 00:57:37.716
You have those powers.

00:57:37.839 --> 00:57:42.291
You just stand anywhere and you can create peace in that place,

00:57:42.316 --> 00:57:44.938
you can create happiness in that place.

00:57:44.989 --> 00:57:51.343
So be confident, don’t lose your confidence.

00:57:51.494 --> 00:57:58.586
Also your wisdom to understand others will be very much convincing

00:57:58.611 --> 00:58:03.297
for other people to understand that
“They are something exceptional.

00:58:03.376 --> 00:58:06.612
They don’t get angry, they don’t get into temper,

00:58:06.668 --> 00:58:10.512
they are not mad people,
they are not after some sort of a craze -

00:58:10.537 --> 00:58:14.945
just very, very balanced people."

00:58:15.361 --> 00:58:17.734
And this you don’t have to practice.

00:58:17.759 --> 00:58:19.054
It is there.

00:58:19.093 --> 00:58:22.404
It is within you, and you should be proud of it.

00:58:22.763 --> 00:58:28.103
You should not think that it is something

00:58:28.191 --> 00:58:33.465
that you have to achieve, or to become.

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:36.213
You have it, within yourself you have it.

00:58:36.238 --> 00:58:41.858
Only thing that you have to see in the light of the Spirit yourself.

00:58:43.246 --> 00:58:48.569
It just is a very simple thing, and that works out.

00:58:49.023 --> 00:58:53.338
It is not easy for others to understand you,

00:58:53.457 --> 00:58:56.529
but it should be very easy to understand them;

00:58:56.554 --> 00:58:59.464
because you were like that before,

00:58:59.489 --> 00:59:06.808
and now they are seeing you and they will become like you.

00:59:07.683 --> 00:59:09.250
It’s very simple.

00:59:09.275 --> 00:59:13.874
You can see this, that I started Sahaja Yoga with one lady.

00:59:13.899 --> 00:59:16.337
And now today, see how many are there.

00:59:16.369 --> 00:59:19.778
Now what have I done, I really don’t know, what have I done?

00:59:19.778 --> 00:59:21.850
I have no idea.

00:59:21.883 --> 00:59:26.355
And what you think, such gratitude and enjoyment and joy!

00:59:27.204 --> 00:59:30.005
So all these things, whatever I have told you,

00:59:30.236 --> 00:59:35.777
you have to be aware of your being,  of your own Self,

00:59:35.825 --> 00:59:41.045
of your Spirit, that you are the Spirit.

00:59:41.281 --> 00:59:46.652
And as you are the Spirit, you are beyond all these things.

00:59:46.834 --> 00:59:53.367
And once that happens, you’ll be amazed what a personality you are.

00:59:53.827 --> 01:02:46.638
(Shri Mataji continues in Hindi)
