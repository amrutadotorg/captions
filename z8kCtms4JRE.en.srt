1
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:56,549
Today we have all been waiting to celebrate
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.

2
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,942
There's so much significant that we are
in a place here,

3
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:18,764
the same type of a hut Jesus had when He
was born,

4
00:04:19,373 --> 00:04:22,428
and the wind was blowing from all sides

5
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:30,988
and it was difficult to keep the room very
warm,

6
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:39,169
though if it is correct He was not born
in the month of December,

7
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:46,404
in a warmer month, not so very cold, maybe
this much as you see;

8
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:54,324
so maybe that the climate of today is quite
significant, with the climate

9
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:58,697
that He must have felt.

10
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:04,099
As for you people, you don't feel any
discomfort in this climate,

11
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,307
nor in these surroundings nor in the Spartan
living.

12
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:15,437
He never felt any discomfort, nor
His Mother.

13
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:20,650
When our attention is on our Spirit,

14
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:33,392
then we do not feel the discomfort of nature
or of worldly things.

15
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:41,694
This is the first sign when a Sahaja Yogi
starts

16
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:47,777
complaining about comforts,

17
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:53,849
then the first sign is that he is not
a Sahaja Yogi as yet.

18
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:04,816
To begin with you just get absolutely
acclimatized with the climate and enjoy

19
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:15,020
the style, the speed, the way it is molding
you.

20
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:22,652
There's no friction between the nature and
the body because the Spirit

21
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:29,515
which is synchronizer, helps you to become
one

22
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:34,720
with this nature and enjoy the best part
of it.

23
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:39,310
The way you are enjoying it shows that you
are great Sahaja Yogis,

24
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:41,701
and that goes to My credit, I think,

25
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:49,761
that you people have accepted all
the discomfort as enjoyments.

26
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:55,860
Christ coming was a great event as I have
told you

27
00:06:56,061 --> 00:07:04,933
to establish Agnya Chakra. And He was born
on this Earth

28
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:09,624
but much before He was born
in the consciousness

29
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:18,637
and that absolute consciousness itself took
birth as Jesus Christ.

30
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:23,543
To explain His life is only possible if you
are Realized souls,

31
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:29,541
otherwise you cannot explain Christ - what
He was, how He worked -

32
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:36,145
still it's very difficult to explain many
things in Sahaja Yoga as you know,

33
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:42,117
you just go on seeing things. Today you
saw fountains

34
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:45,910
coming out of the lake, which nobody can
explain,

35
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:50,552
even the engineer said that they can't
explain, nobody can explain it.

36
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:56,292
It just happens that the water gets
excited, feels the Divinity

37
00:07:56,493 --> 00:08:01,991
and starts pouring out its love in a bubbly
manner.

38
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:05,596
Can you imagine that even the water can
feel it?

39
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:12,431
You have seen how the light can feel it,
in the same way every element can feel it.

40
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:16,708
All those elements are within us,
the highest of all,

41
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:23,075
as we say, is the light,

42
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:30,988
because light has an effect and that is
governed by Jesus Christ.

43
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:38,780
Light has an effect, light shows things
that are correct.

44
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:47,056
That's the one which makes us understand
all the dimensions of worldly things

45
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:55,699
and ultimately when this light comes from
the Spirit and is enlightened by the Spirit,

46
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:02,428
then you start seeing the other dimensions
also which sometimes make you laugh,

47
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:08,945
sometimes make you smile and sometimes
make you cry also.

48
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:16,004
Such a beautiful new dimension you have
achieved through Sahaja Yoga,

49
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:20,880
but it was all built in within you and you
had to achieve it.

50
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:26,135
People on the other side had to work very
hard,

51
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:33,280
like Jesus Christ was born in a small manger
to show

52
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:37,950
that Divinity need not be born in royal
families,

53
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:42,080
can be born in a manger,

54
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:46,704
can be born anywhere, makes no difference
to the Divinity.

55
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:55,116
But that has given some funny ideas
to people, that they are saying

56
00:09:55,317 --> 00:10:02,345
we should make ourselves miserable

57
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:09,353
and we should give away everything to God.
God doesn't want anything.

58
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:14,140
He cannot have anything, and you cannot
give anything.

59
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:18,941
Is a wrong idea that you become like
a pauper and give everything to God.

60
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:27,567
He doesn't want that. What He wants that
you have to be happy, joyous and enjoying.

61
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:29,780
That's the main point.

62
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:35,710
Also if you give a little bit, very little
bit to God,

63
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:38,713
then He gives you hundred times more.

64
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:42,877
That's why you have to give a very wee bit
to God.

65
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:46,530
But you don't have to hang yourself
by the trees

66
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:50,559
to prove that you want to sacrifice.

67
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,900
Christ has done everything for you. That's
the beauty of His life is

68
00:10:55,101 --> 00:11:00,684
that from the very beginning of His birth
He has shown that He has enjoyed

69
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:08,414
no material well-being, as we call it.

70
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:17,808
He has not enjoyed any worldly things as we
know of

71
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:24,895
but that just means that He has done that
for us to see

72
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:30,580
that there is no need for us to hanker
after worldly things -

73
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:35,101
they will hanker after us. You don't have
to worry about these things.

74
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:39,897
What you have to worry is the Spirit,
the main thing.

75
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:49,025
All His life, which was very short I should
say, He has been trying,

76
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:56,806
He was very much interested in evaluating
people

77
00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:01,270
because He didn't know what sort of things
these human beings are.

78
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:08,843
He was a foreigner for these human beings.
So He tried to evaluate

79
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:12,274
and in that evaluation

80
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:20,362
He said many things which are very
remarkable, and one has to understand.

81
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:27,132
One of the things He said that don't throw
your pearls before people

82
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:34,330
who do not want to understand you. For
Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand

83
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:39,677
that you should not talk about Sahaja Yoga
to people who are anti-God.

84
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:42,745
Now he may be your brother, may be your
sister, may be your father,

85
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:48,186
may be anyone, there is no need to convince
them about Sahaja Yoga

86
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,713
because they are not your relations.

87
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,363
Many people have only this worry how
to convince my husband

88
00:12:56,564 --> 00:13:03,318
or how to convince my brother, there is
no need at all for you to work it out,

89
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:09,831
just give them up on this point.

90
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:15,000
The another thing He has told us which is
very important, I think,

91
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:18,532
that we must forgive.

92
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,896
He has given the greatest weapon that we
must forgive.

93
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:27,989
Now it's such a practical thing to forgive.

94
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,550
If you just forgive, the person doesn't
exist anymore

95
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:38,186
and the person doesn't trouble you anymore,
nor is he in your attention,

96
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:44,728
just to forgive is a simplest thing to do
and the highest thing to do

97
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:53,896
to get relief from worldly or mental
tortures that we get.

98
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:03,942
His life has been a story of spirituality,

99
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:09,572
going through all kinds of turmoils and
tortures,

100
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:14,816
all types of troubles that the Spirit can
go through,

101
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:21,150
to show that nobody can kill that Spirit,

102
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:27,559
as it’s said in the Gita: "Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah,

103
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,731
na chainam kledayantya apo, na shosayati
marutah".

104
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:34,591
It cannot be killed, it's an eternal life

105
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:38,096
and He tried to prove through His life
the eternity,

106
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:44,529
from the beginning to the end He showed
that Spirit is above matter,

107
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,893
that nothing can dominate Spirit.

108
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:53,198
It's a very big thing He has done for us is
to create

109
00:14:53,399 --> 00:15:02,184
such a big confidence in our Spirit.

110
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,639
He has proved it beyond doubt.

111
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,952
I hope you people will understand and will
not bother Me or bother yourself

112
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:16,659
with small petty things here and there,
is nothing important.

113
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:27,494
Ask for bigger things, eternal things,
valuable things.

114
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:32,092
Also I am very happy that you like this
place

115
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:34,239
and you are enjoying yourself here very
much

116
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,191
and today we have declared so many
marriages.

117
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:40,302
There have been so many events in this
short time.

118
00:15:40,503 --> 00:15:44,378
So I would like to bless you all for this
Christmas Eve

119
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:47,956
and I wish you all very happy Christmas and
Happy New Year.
