00:19.896 --> 00:25.515
Sahasrara Puja – “The Ghost of Materialism”
3rd May 1987

00:25.515 --> 00:26.746
Thredbo, Australia

00:31.643 --> 00:38.403
Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja
yogis.

00:42.756 --> 01:04.486
It was a long time back that I desired Sahasrara
should be opened out, but waiting for a right

01:04.486 --> 01:06.366
time.

01:06.366 --> 01:22.496
It was important to do it at the right time.

01:22.496 --> 01:34.895
A boy in Aurangabad, quite young, asked Me
a question, “Mother, this all-pervading

01:34.895 --> 01:49.916
Power of Brahmachaitanya is beyond senses,
you cannot feel it through senses.

01:49.916 --> 01:57.985
How is it we are now feeling it through our
senses?”

01:57.985 --> 02:04.476
This is the question he asked, and I ask you
the same question.

02:04.476 --> 02:20.016
Before this, those people who got realization
could not talk about it in the way you can

02:20.016 --> 02:24.756
tell people, that you can feel it on your
senses.

02:24.756 --> 02:34.306
They could not explain, they could not put
it into experience.

02:34.306 --> 02:52.155
Just what they did was to tell them in words,
words which were telling about something – like

02:52.155 --> 02:59.355
the taste of mango, unless and until you eat
the mango how will you know the taste?

02:59.355 --> 03:04.265
By just knowing about “it’s wonderful,
it’s great, it’s fantastic,” still you

03:04.265 --> 03:11.485
have not tasted the mango.

03:11.485 --> 03:17.586
So what has happened now, was the question.

03:17.586 --> 03:22.765
Another thing was that these people got so
fed up, like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-one,

03:22.765 --> 03:26.156
he took a samadhi.

03:26.156 --> 03:34.836
He went into a room and closed the doors and
settled down there, and he died there.

03:34.836 --> 03:40.536
All of them – even Christ got Himself crucified.

03:40.536 --> 03:51.946
Because they could tell a parable, they could
tell a simile, but what had happened to them

03:51.946 --> 04:05.027
that they could not explain, and they felt
so sad and so frustrated.

04:05.027 --> 04:09.866
In a way they finished their life very early.

04:09.866 --> 04:21.426
This was the question.

04:21.426 --> 04:56.276
So what was the secret, can any one of you
tell Me?

04:56.276 --> 05:13.026
The answer is simple, but it’s difficult
to digest.

05:13.026 --> 05:27.326
The answer is that all these incarnations
who came on this Earth were part of the Sahasrara,

05:27.326 --> 05:39.005
were part of the Brahmachaitanya, were part
of the Adi Shakti.

05:39.005 --> 05:48.366
They came on this Earth, gave realization
to some people who were excellent, good people

05:48.366 --> 05:55.846
who had no problems; as if they came out of
the ocean of love and took all of them to

05:55.846 --> 06:00.616
the ocean of love, to enjoy that ocean.

06:00.616 --> 06:06.266
As Kabira has said that “When a drop becomes
the ocean, what can I say?”

06:06.266 --> 06:14.016
(“Jub mast hue, phir kya bole?”)

06:14.016 --> 06:17.266
So many of them took to mauna, that is silence.

06:17.266 --> 06:29.276
They disappeared, they got dissolved completely
into the ocean of love.

06:29.276 --> 06:37.766
But you did not get dissolved.

06:37.766 --> 06:50.185
Something special has happened to you, that
the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole ocean

06:50.185 --> 07:06.806
has taken the form of a cloud – that’s
Adi Shakti – and has come on this Earth

07:06.806 --> 07:28.815
to shower the chaitanya on you people, enrich
you, nurture you, develop you, by manifesting

07:28.815 --> 07:39.856
the love in such a manner that you have entered
into the body of the Adi Shakti.

07:39.856 --> 07:45.556
So like one pitcher which is in the River
Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of

07:45.556 --> 07:50.935
the Adi Shakti.

07:50.935 --> 07:54.636
Your entity, your personality is preserved.

07:54.636 --> 08:04.556
Despite that you feel the Brahmachaitanya
through your senses and you can give realizations

08:04.556 --> 08:08.465
to others, but you are in the body of the
Adi Shakti.

08:08.465 --> 08:17.656
As long as you are in the body of Adi Shakti
you can do all that.

08:17.656 --> 08:21.095
This is the greatest thing that has happened.

08:21.095 --> 08:28.266
The whole of the Sahasrara has opened out
with all the seven peethas of all the deities,

08:28.266 --> 08:30.586
who are just part and parcel of it.

08:30.586 --> 08:42.676
The whole of it has come in the form of a
Mother who is humble, who is deceptive, illusive,

08:42.676 --> 08:46.916
who is Mahamaya.

08:46.916 --> 08:57.016
It’s the greatest thing that could happen
to human beings and to the whole universe,

08:57.016 --> 09:05.156
that now you can get your realization, you
can give realizations to others, you can understand

09:05.156 --> 09:12.896
through your senses, through your logic what
is vibrations, what it does.

09:12.896 --> 09:24.636
Just like the proof is here: all the flowers
were dead last night, finished with the heat

09:24.636 --> 09:26.586
of the people who were carrying them.

09:26.586 --> 09:33.706
And then I just put some vibrated water on
them, and you see how they are.

09:33.706 --> 09:42.756
Brahmachaitanya has revived them, but their
personality is there, they are all vibrated,

09:42.756 --> 09:45.615
and they are looking so fresh and beautiful.

09:45.615 --> 09:56.276
Same thing with you, you all look so fresh
and beautiful, anybody can make out a Sahaja

09:56.276 --> 09:57.606
yogi.

09:57.606 --> 10:03.816
Under these circumstances one has to understand
that there are certain limitations which you

10:03.816 --> 10:05.036
have to observe.

10:05.036 --> 10:08.735
First of all, I have taken you in My body.

10:08.735 --> 10:20.855
A foreign thing has to go in the body and
it has to be looked after, nurtured.

10:20.855 --> 10:32.006
But if you become troublesome, then you’ll
be thrown out, I can’t bear you.

10:32.006 --> 10:36.586
Some people are extremely troublesome.

10:36.586 --> 10:46.466
They do not meditate, they have their own
ideas about meditation, they do not develop

10:46.466 --> 10:59.276
themselves, they do not mature, they live
in the past or in the future, and such people

10:59.276 --> 11:00.276
are troublesome.

11:00.276 --> 11:07.786
A simple thing I’d requested you all, to
put some ghee in the nose, which is a very

11:07.786 --> 11:10.656
simple thing but is very important.

11:10.656 --> 11:21.636
You all suffer from a very bad Hamsa, and
one of the things that is a symptom in a AIDS

11:21.636 --> 11:24.536
case is a bad Hamsa.

11:24.536 --> 11:38.396
You’ll be vulnerable to AIDS – and a small
thing like that is not observed.

11:38.396 --> 11:47.706
It has to be a religious obligation that you
must listen to Me, whatever I say.

11:47.706 --> 11:50.746
Actually you must obey Me.

11:50.746 --> 11:59.906
My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My feet
obey Me; what about you, who are raised to

11:59.906 --> 12:16.786
the great dignity and the great position of
being the yogis in the body of the Adi Shakti,

12:16.786 --> 12:31.006
and they are acting as cells in My body?

12:31.006 --> 12:39.846
First and foremost thing is, to do this kind
of a venture, to put all kinds of things in

12:39.846 --> 13:00.386
your body is a very daring thing, and the
process is also very hazardous.

13:00.386 --> 13:17.086
This has to be achieved with great patience,
love, compassion and above all, hard labor.

13:17.086 --> 13:26.975
This has to be regarded as the greatest thing,
that Sahasrara was opened by Me.

13:26.975 --> 13:36.216
Of course I am the master of Sahasrara, I
am the master of all the chakras, but also

13:36.216 --> 13:41.175
I’m beyond Sahasrara, much beyond it.

13:41.175 --> 13:49.035
If that is the situation, you should be careful
about your Sahasrara – that is Me – and

13:49.035 --> 13:59.086
looking after your own heart which is the
Brahmarandra peetha here, which opens out

13:59.086 --> 14:02.785
ultimately when you get your realization.

14:02.785 --> 14:11.816
Sahaja Yoga is spreading everywhere horizontally;
vertically it must also spread.

14:11.816 --> 14:20.066
And there, if you really have proper understanding
of what I am, Sahasrara should be absolutely

14:20.066 --> 14:21.475
clearcut.

14:21.475 --> 14:29.756
And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you must listen
to whatever I have told you, obey it as absolutely

14:29.756 --> 14:39.305
a ordained thing.

14:39.305 --> 14:43.146
To keep the Sahasrara clean is to open your
heart.

14:43.146 --> 14:51.175
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill
it up with My love?

14:51.175 --> 14:56.636
Open your heart to your fellow yogis and yoginis.

14:56.636 --> 15:03.376
Don’t get worried about what has happened
in the past, don’t get worried about what

15:03.376 --> 15:10.425
has happened in your life as far as your relationships
are concerned.

15:10.425 --> 15:16.946
Such things won’t happen now in Sahaja Yoga,
they cannot happen.

15:16.946 --> 15:23.055
It has been worked out that way, it cannot
happen.

15:23.055 --> 15:27.876
If this hand is paining, the other hand is
there to help it out.

15:27.876 --> 15:33.526
You’re not alone, you are in the body of
the collective being.

15:33.526 --> 15:42.045
If there are stupid people, if there are idiotic
people, Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such

15:42.045 --> 15:48.576
people – in Sanskrit language they are called
as “mudhahs.”

15:48.576 --> 15:57.316
Neither this is meant for people who are over-smart
and trying to cheat themselves – intelligence

15:57.316 --> 16:09.545
has that capacity – and to indulge into
things which are not Sahaj.

16:09.545 --> 16:14.105
Slowly you will find your vibrations will
disappear, you’ll become sick, you’ll

16:14.105 --> 16:22.026
have problems and you’ll be in trouble.

16:22.026 --> 16:34.186
This is not a kind of a warning but a request,
because you are in My body, and whenever

16:34.186 --> 16:44.636
anybody tries to be troublesome in My body
I have to bear it up, and suffer a lot.

16:44.636 --> 16:55.386
It’s a funny type of a crucifixion when
every moment you are hanged onto a cross by

16:55.386 --> 17:01.716
anyone who wants to do it.

17:01.716 --> 17:10.726
Sahaja yogis have all the laws in their hands
to torture My life, to trouble Me if they

17:10.726 --> 17:23.485
want to; but they have also such a capacity,
such a caliber, such a potential that they

17:23.485 --> 17:28.196
can reside in My heart forever.

17:28.196 --> 17:34.486
Open your hearts, that’s the thing I will
say.

17:34.486 --> 17:39.906
Now we have to see what keeps our hearts closed.

17:39.906 --> 17:49.766
Firstly it keeps our heart in a binding, the
fear of the past.

17:49.766 --> 17:57.836
In the past if you have done anything wrong,
in the past we have had bad experiences of

17:57.836 --> 18:01.166
people, we are very frightened.

18:01.166 --> 18:10.476
I’ve seen, I’m surprised, I’ve seen
it Myself that in England when we were staying

18:10.476 --> 18:20.446
– it was that day unluckily or luckily it
was snowing for the first time, and we were

18:20.446 --> 18:22.886
shifting, so I had gone out.

18:22.886 --> 18:31.315
And when I came back I saw a lady and a little
baby in a pram, standing at the door and talking

18:31.315 --> 18:32.315
to some lady.

18:32.315 --> 18:40.166
The other lady was just talking through a
little opening in the door, because there

18:40.166 --> 18:42.075
was a chain on.

18:42.075 --> 18:49.796
Then I went out and came back after half-an-hour,
and I saw the same thing.

18:49.796 --> 18:55.955
The lady was still standing in the snow, and
this lady was talking to her through a chink.

18:55.955 --> 18:58.426
I was surprised.

18:58.426 --> 19:03.726
What is this going like “Midsummer’s Night’s
Dream,” these people are talking to each

19:03.726 --> 19:06.976
other – horrible!

19:06.976 --> 19:13.006
What was it that was frightening to this lady
inside the room – what this lady would have

19:13.006 --> 19:16.186
done with the child, who had come to her door?

19:16.186 --> 19:19.936
What was there to be so frightened of?

19:19.936 --> 19:27.335
Because of the ego within yourself: you have
frightened others, you have tortured others,

19:27.335 --> 19:35.016
you have dominated others, you have done all
these things, so there is fear in your mind

19:35.016 --> 19:39.996
that others may do the same thing to you.

19:39.996 --> 19:44.256
Or what is there to be so much frightened,
to lock your doors to everyone who comes to

19:44.256 --> 19:49.406
your house?

19:49.406 --> 19:57.126
Secondly, maybe you might have been tortured
by someone or troubled by someone, so your

19:57.126 --> 20:00.866
heart is closed, you can’t open heart to
others.

20:00.866 --> 20:05.096
People just don’t talk, they just keep “mum.”

20:05.096 --> 20:07.536
What has happened?

20:07.536 --> 20:11.796
Just like a dead body moving about.

20:11.796 --> 20:21.925
Supposing I was like this, who would have
told you the secrets of Sahaja Yoga and Sahasrara?

20:21.925 --> 20:28.466
So this kind of a nature comes from people
who are frightened in the past perhaps, or

20:28.466 --> 20:35.506
they might have frightened people with their
bad Vishuddhi.

20:35.506 --> 20:44.416
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in
the West, and that also is inherited by you

20:44.416 --> 20:45.596
people.

20:45.596 --> 20:49.976
As soon as you put them onto something, they
become aggressive.

20:49.976 --> 20:53.656
I can’t bear it within Myself.

20:53.656 --> 21:02.565
Supposing I have some sort of a medicine that
makes some cells very aggressive, then what

21:02.565 --> 21:03.565
happens?

21:03.565 --> 21:07.195
Ultimately I become a patient of cancer.

21:07.195 --> 21:20.506
An aggressive cell is called as the malignant
cell, and such a cell cannot give you proper

21:20.506 --> 21:28.336
attention, cannot give you proper depth, but
you become nothing but a malignant cell, a

21:28.336 --> 21:32.706
cell which is creating a cancer.

21:32.706 --> 21:37.106
And such a person creates cancer among Sahaja
yogis.

21:37.106 --> 21:47.246
I’ve heard horrible stories about how some
women, some men have become aggressive.

21:47.246 --> 21:51.716
With a little position they get, immediately
they become aggressive.

21:51.716 --> 22:00.966
Say somebody is a wife of a organizer, or
a so-called leader’s, then she thinks she

22:00.966 --> 22:10.126
is nothing but a prime minister or something
– or her husband becomes something.

22:10.126 --> 22:15.686
This aggressiveness adds to the aggressiveness
of another person.

22:15.686 --> 22:17.506
So then reaction starts.

22:17.506 --> 22:21.806
One says something, the another says something;
we become reactionaries.

22:21.806 --> 22:27.236
We haven’t got something of our own, that
we should be reactionaries?

22:27.236 --> 22:35.346
There should be no reaction to anything, because
we have something of our own.

22:35.346 --> 22:41.525
Why should we react to something, whatever
people are doing to us or have done to us?

22:41.525 --> 22:42.955
– it’s finished.

22:42.955 --> 22:45.096
Open your hearts.

22:45.096 --> 22:51.756
That’s why when you came to India, I think
you must have noticed that in the Indian heart

22:51.756 --> 23:02.195
there is nothing like an anger for say, for
English or for Portuguese, or for anybody

23:02.195 --> 23:04.526
who has dominated them.

23:04.526 --> 23:11.646
They have so much love and affection and respect,
and they see that what good you have done

23:11.646 --> 23:12.796
to them.

23:12.796 --> 23:20.436
Like some barristers came to India and they
visited some high courts, and they had holiday

23:20.436 --> 23:31.776
for one day to celebrate the visit of these
British lawyers and barristers.

23:31.776 --> 23:40.336
But if you go to England they will beat you,
throw you out.

23:40.336 --> 23:46.606
This aggressiveness has to go from your heart,
it has to get out of it.

23:46.606 --> 23:55.476
There’s no place in My body for aggressive
people, no place at all.

23:55.476 --> 24:04.006
I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn’t
aggress Me.

24:04.006 --> 24:08.416
If you aggress any Sahaja yogi, you are aggressing
Me.

24:08.416 --> 24:12.196
But when it comes to others, they won’t
aggress others.

24:12.196 --> 24:20.455
Like a bad husband will aggress his wife,
but not other people.

24:20.455 --> 24:24.226
So those who are non-Sahaja yogis, they do
not aggress them.

24:24.226 --> 24:32.825
That’s a very important part of Sahasrara,
because ego covers a great part of Sahasrara,

24:32.825 --> 24:41.575
and if your Sahasrara is covered with this
ego business, how can I help you and how can

24:41.575 --> 24:43.486
I help Myself?

24:43.486 --> 24:56.976
Now so many of you are in My body, just imagine,
circulating fast; and most of them are fighting

24:56.976 --> 25:00.736
to be in My heart, but they are settling in
My ego.

25:00.736 --> 25:10.006
Well, I am egoless, because I have no reactions.

25:10.006 --> 25:13.026
If you have no reaction you cannot develop
ego.

25:13.026 --> 25:17.746
I’ve no reactions, I’m reactionless.

25:17.746 --> 25:33.726
I am in My own peace and glory, trying to
work out Sahaja Yoga.

25:33.726 --> 25:47.236
I do not react to anything, but your reactions
trouble Me because you are within Me.

25:47.236 --> 25:54.096
Then the second part is the fear that comes
from childhood.

25:54.096 --> 26:02.636
I do not know about Americans, but so many
Americans who came to Me were half-mad, cracked

26:02.636 --> 26:07.906
people, absolutely cracked in the head, nothing
normal about them.

26:07.906 --> 26:12.606
Either they will not talk – if they talk
they talk irrelevantly, you don’t know what

26:12.606 --> 26:14.046
they are talking about.

26:14.046 --> 26:16.217
Same with the French.

26:16.217 --> 26:26.466
French were mad much before anybody was mad
in this world, I think; very cracky people

26:26.466 --> 26:34.266
you see, very difficult, it’s absolutely
can’t understand, everything upside-down.

26:34.266 --> 26:45.536
When you blame our Indian telephone, you must
know they were made by French.

26:45.536 --> 26:55.606
I always say that in Pune we have got the
telephone just to see, because it is called

26:55.606 --> 27:01.697
as “Punya Patnam” – means the, is the
“city of punyas” – and only God can

27:01.697 --> 27:09.786
listen to this telephone, but even God cannot!

27:09.786 --> 27:20.656
So this kind of a crackedness, or this what
you call this madness, aggressive madness,

27:20.656 --> 27:36.286
comes from ego going to the level of super-ego;
and they get first of all “what’s wrong?”

27:36.286 --> 27:43.085
When they talk you feel they are fighting,
and these are love talks, “romantic” they

27:43.085 --> 27:46.976
say, and we feel they are fighting.

27:46.976 --> 27:55.825
And then after some time the aggressiveness
is very apparent, and then it becomes as if

27:55.825 --> 28:00.516
they are off their heads, absolutely off their
heads.

28:00.516 --> 28:04.776
And it’s very common with Americans, very
common.

28:04.776 --> 28:14.446
You can’t find Americans when they are talking,
any good speaker, who doesn’t have twitches

28:14.446 --> 28:21.085
on his faces, on his body, everywhere, because
so many nerves have been already strained

28:21.085 --> 28:34.856
with this kind of “what’s wrong?” business
– going to the other extreme of deciding

28:34.856 --> 28:37.346
everything for yourself.

28:37.346 --> 28:52.455
And the thing behind is a ghost, I should
say, a very big ghost, and which is not in

28:52.455 --> 28:55.966
the past or the future, but in the present.

28:55.966 --> 28:58.085
And that ghost I call it as materialism.

28:58.085 --> 29:09.266
Materialism – it’s a ghost, it’s a horrible
devil that has come onto the heads of Americans,

29:09.266 --> 29:15.416
and from them to all of us.

29:15.416 --> 29:19.886
This materialism is a horrible stuff.

29:19.886 --> 29:33.276
It’s so ridiculous, shameful, doesn’t
even suit a human person; even a dog would

29:33.276 --> 29:45.716
hate such a materialism, to what level human
beings have gone.

29:45.716 --> 29:52.185
This materialism makes a person absolutely
shameless.

29:52.185 --> 30:02.916
A lady would not mind asking another lady,
“By the way, have you got my spoons with

30:02.916 --> 30:03.916
you?”

30:03.916 --> 30:07.636
There’s no shame in it.

30:07.636 --> 30:18.376
When we were small we were told in India – I
mean, that’s our culture – that if somebody’s

30:18.376 --> 30:26.506
pin is in your house you should preserve it
and return it, but even if your diamond is

30:26.506 --> 30:29.955
lost with somebody, never ask for it.

30:29.955 --> 30:35.226
Is not good manners.

30:35.226 --> 30:45.846
What is more valuable is not the diamond,
is the relationship, is the friendship, and

30:45.846 --> 30:50.396
the emotions of human beings to be respected.

30:50.396 --> 30:52.396
How can you ask?

30:52.396 --> 30:56.756
If there was a diamond they would have found
it and would have given it to you, but if

30:56.756 --> 31:03.856
there is no asking for that or reporting like
that then it’s sure there’s no diamond;

31:03.856 --> 31:05.425
and even if it is there, doesn’t matter.

31:05.425 --> 31:14.016
After all, what is a diamond? – you are
wearing or they are wearing, what does it

31:14.016 --> 31:15.016
matter?

31:15.016 --> 31:21.239
In My father’s house all the doors were
open all the time, all the doors, day and

31:21.239 --> 31:22.239
night.

31:22.239 --> 31:27.886
Never a thief came in, thought that doors
are open so nothing is locked, there’s nothing

31:27.886 --> 31:28.886
precious.

31:28.886 --> 31:37.685
Only we had one theft, and the thief came
and took away a gramophone from us, and some

31:37.685 --> 31:38.685
records.

31:38.685 --> 31:41.016
So My father said, “He’s a connoisseur.

31:41.016 --> 31:44.426
He took the right thing from this house, so
let it be.

31:44.426 --> 31:53.006
What’s the use of informing the police?”

31:53.006 --> 32:05.466
So this materialism that comes in is a mad,
mad, mad dog, and gives you a disease which

32:05.466 --> 32:10.146
is worse than any disease that is possible.

32:10.146 --> 32:18.886
How people play on it, on this disease, as
you must have known that doctors when you

32:18.886 --> 32:23.786
get some disease little bit, they’ll take
out your teeth, take out your eyes, take out

32:23.786 --> 32:29.436
your nose, take out your purse and take out
everything that you have, for a little thing

32:29.436 --> 32:32.546
like malaria or something.

32:32.546 --> 32:41.526
But this disease takes away everything that
is beautiful within you, that is good within

32:41.526 --> 32:42.836
you.

32:42.836 --> 32:47.046
For example, it started a fashion.

32:47.046 --> 32:49.846
With this materialism they start fashions.

32:49.846 --> 32:54.356
Ladies are more vulnerable.

32:54.356 --> 33:02.236
Fashion starts, any sort of fashion starts,
like the sleeves to be made long – in India

33:02.236 --> 33:09.866
also they started – then make it short,
then make it half, then make it no sleeves.

33:09.866 --> 33:11.636
I said, “I am not running that race.

33:11.636 --> 33:16.805
I will have the sleeves all the time, same
sleeves so I don’t have to bother.

33:16.805 --> 33:22.606
I can tell My tailor and he can make whatever
way I want to have, the tailor, because he

33:22.606 --> 33:27.856
knows I make one style” – finished with
it.

33:27.856 --> 33:31.156
Why do people want to run with the fashion?

33:31.156 --> 33:37.916
Just think of it, what is the need to run
with the fashion?

33:37.916 --> 33:40.666
Now new race has started, run with it.

33:40.666 --> 33:43.506
Then another race has started, run with it.

33:43.506 --> 33:48.466
Then the third race has started, run with
it – all the time running with the mad race

33:48.466 --> 33:53.335
of fashions.

33:53.335 --> 34:00.386
Now a new race has started of fashions not
to put any oil in the head, so you become

34:00.386 --> 34:02.786
bald, then you buy wigs.

34:02.786 --> 34:08.976
It’s all entrepreneurs who are working out,
it’s all enterprises.

34:08.976 --> 34:20.986
So you become absolutely bald-headed people,
then you get your wigs from them, then there

34:20.986 --> 34:25.526
is a special charge for dressing the wigs,
so you go for dressing the wigs.

34:25.526 --> 34:28.896
Goes on like mad.

34:28.896 --> 34:40.936
Then there’s another type: now a new fashion
has started in London because, you see, these

34:40.936 --> 34:42.956
people want to make some money.

34:42.956 --> 34:48.506
People don’t even have so much of logic
and intelligence left in their heads to see

34:48.506 --> 34:53.206
that what they were preaching one day, they
are just the thing against it.

34:53.206 --> 34:59.706
Formerly it was you had to wear a tail coat,
you had to have your hair absolutely done

34:59.706 --> 35:06.496
with proper hair-grooming and all that, as
you can see in the old pictures.

35:06.496 --> 35:11.706
Then it started striped three-piece suits.

35:11.706 --> 35:21.086
Now it is, I mean, few days earlier was tight
clothes, then they developed varicose veins,

35:21.086 --> 35:22.116
you see.

35:22.116 --> 35:27.796
So no, no – now it is the fashion to wear
absolutely loose dresses.

35:27.796 --> 35:33.616
I saw the other day one lady making a dress
out of a big blanket, going like this.

35:33.616 --> 35:42.096
I thought she was some priest or someone!

35:42.096 --> 35:45.316
So that stupidity has started.

35:45.316 --> 35:55.416
Imagine – think of Sahasrara, think of Divine,
in what world we are, and in what world the

35:55.416 --> 35:59.376
stupid people are going.

35:59.376 --> 36:07.556
That’s another world, absolutely another
stupid world where people just go after nonsensical

36:07.556 --> 36:14.116
things, changing from one to another, changing
from everything: ties are changed, everything

36:14.116 --> 36:16.166
is changed, giving you such a headache.

36:16.166 --> 36:19.046
All the time you have to think, “Now what
fashion is there?

36:19.046 --> 36:21.276
Let’s find out in the newspaper.

36:21.276 --> 36:22.816
What is – this is the fashion now.

36:22.816 --> 36:25.716
All right, wear this dress.”

36:25.716 --> 36:30.986
All this is befooling going on, because this
ghost has entered into us.

36:30.986 --> 36:41.776
In Sahaja Yoga also when we enter, be careful,
materialism should not enter into your minds.

36:41.776 --> 36:47.696
It’s nothing important.

36:47.696 --> 36:53.586
Even when somebody dies you are supposed to
wear something black, or white or I don’t

36:53.586 --> 36:56.016
know what else, but white or black.

36:56.016 --> 37:03.836
And somebody died in England who was a great
friend of My husband, and I had no black sari,

37:03.836 --> 37:04.836
completely black.

37:04.836 --> 37:06.836
I mean we don’t have such a sari.

37:06.836 --> 37:08.286
I didn’t know what to do.

37:08.286 --> 37:10.436
I told My husband I don’t have a black sari.

37:10.436 --> 37:12.906
He said, “Then You don’t come.”

37:12.906 --> 37:18.646
Imagine how his wife would feel if I don’t
go to the thing, how she would take it.

37:18.646 --> 37:25.926
All this is nothing, what is important is
the black sari!

37:25.926 --> 37:33.706
In every walk of life you are being befooled
by this materialism.

37:33.706 --> 37:39.566
I don’t know how you got stuck into it first
of all.

37:39.566 --> 37:42.436
And the other side is, the same people are
befooling you.

37:42.436 --> 37:48.546
“All right, this is not good, this is too
much” – so go to the anti-culture.

37:48.546 --> 37:54.386
What is anti-culture is another kind of materialism,
another kind of nonsense.

37:54.386 --> 38:01.186
Nowadays they are having in this London an
anti-culture movement which is called as “punks.”

38:01.186 --> 38:07.816
I think out of date now Me, but still what’s
for the time being as I see is punks.

38:07.816 --> 38:11.326
It costs them forty pounds sometimes to make
that hair.

38:11.326 --> 38:20.136
I mean, is it something that you are saving
money on that?

38:20.136 --> 38:27.396
So the whole thing works out just to take
out your attention from reality, from higher

38:27.396 --> 38:35.906
values, to something nonsensical.

38:35.906 --> 38:44.676
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead
a life of collectivity.

38:44.676 --> 38:51.916
It’s very important that we have to be collective.

38:51.916 --> 38:58.066
We shouldn’t talk of “This is mine, this
is mine, and this I own.”

38:58.066 --> 39:03.296
Even about children you should not do like
that, “This is my own child, this is my

39:03.296 --> 39:04.506
own baby.

39:04.506 --> 39:12.926
This is my brother, this is my sister.”

39:12.926 --> 39:18.436
This “my, my” should go away; but that’s
not possible, it’s not easy to forget about

39:18.436 --> 39:24.026
it because left Nabhi and right Nabhi has
to be all right.

39:24.026 --> 39:30.266
The only way to do it is that “Mother, it’s
all Yours.”

39:30.266 --> 39:36.616
It’s not dangerous to say that, because
I’ll never take anything that is supposed

39:36.616 --> 39:40.476
to be yours.

39:40.476 --> 39:45.206
Just to say, “Mother, it’s all Yours,”
to start it – “It’s all Yours.

39:45.206 --> 39:53.216
I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all my things
are Yours, my life is Yours.”

39:53.216 --> 39:58.346
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrara.

39:58.346 --> 40:07.416
The deity of Sahasrara is a very simple person,
extremely simple, and can be moved with very

40:07.416 --> 40:13.136
little actions, can be pleased with very few
little actions here and there.

40:13.136 --> 40:16.646
Not much is needed to please the deity of
Sahasrara.

40:16.646 --> 40:26.966
It’s a very simple person; little things
make Her happy.

40:26.966 --> 40:32.646
Yesterday you had brought the flowers, and
I didn’t take them.

40:32.646 --> 40:36.376
You all must have thought, “What’s it,
we couldn’t give flowers to Mother, holding

40:36.376 --> 40:37.526
in our hand.”

40:37.526 --> 40:42.716
But I wanted to show this miracle to you,
that’s why I didn’t take.

40:42.716 --> 40:48.596
And I took it in the end, and see now they
are the best among all of them; don’t they

40:48.596 --> 40:54.516
look as if they have been plucked from the
tree?

40:54.516 --> 41:00.616
Just I wanted to show this, so I said, “I’m
tired,” I sat down and then I looked at

41:00.616 --> 41:08.996
you with the flowers, you see, in the hands,
you’re sitting all of you!

41:08.996 --> 41:18.606
So She is Leela Vinodini.

41:18.606 --> 41:27.136
She plays around, makes little mischiefs here
and there for you to learn lessons.

41:27.136 --> 41:33.796
Because if I tell you “Do this” then it’s
not possible, but little circuitous way I

41:33.796 --> 41:37.526
can show you that this is wrong, you should
not do it.

41:37.526 --> 41:43.406
There’s nothing to feel bad, I would have
taken all the flowers; but somebody must have

41:43.406 --> 41:47.036
thought of it, why Mother has not taken the
flowers today.

41:47.036 --> 41:55.356
I don’t know if you thought of it or not,
but I knew it Myself that I have to take the

41:55.356 --> 42:00.786
flowers to show this miracle to them, that
these flowers are going to last much longer

42:00.786 --> 42:08.206
than any other flowers, because they are vibrated
with the Brahmachaitanya.

42:08.206 --> 42:13.246
And the water was very, very, very cold, so
even I opened a hot water tap.

42:13.246 --> 42:22.096
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, they didn’t
die, despite that they are perfectly all right.

42:22.096 --> 42:28.916
So you have seen so many miracles of this
Brahmachaitanya which is showing on your photographs,

42:28.916 --> 42:36.556
on so many your lives, in so many changes
that have taken place within yourself, within

42:36.556 --> 42:40.756
your family, within every one of you.

42:40.756 --> 42:45.136
All this has happened because you are in Brahmachaitanya.

42:45.136 --> 42:51.396
All this you are receiving because you are
blessed by Brahmachaitanya.

42:51.396 --> 42:56.686
But others are not, so your attitude should
be towards them that they are in the other

42:56.686 --> 43:00.066
world – what to do, how to help them?

43:00.066 --> 43:06.106
We should try to help them if possible, but
up to a point.

43:06.106 --> 43:08.576
We should not drag down ourselves for others’
sake.

43:08.576 --> 43:14.766
Up to a point only we can help them, and we
have to be very happy that Sahaja Yoga is

43:14.766 --> 43:18.256
spreading so much horizontally.

43:18.256 --> 43:22.946
But for vertical thing we must know our quality
must improve.

43:22.946 --> 43:27.766
If some people rise higher, others will also
start rising with them.

43:27.766 --> 43:34.946
It’s the absolute honesty of purpose should
be there, absolutely understanding should

43:34.946 --> 43:37.476
be there.

43:37.476 --> 43:41.706
Open your hearts to each other, so that you
open your hearts to Me.

43:41.706 --> 43:47.056
Every cell must know another cell, otherwise
it won’t work out.

43:47.056 --> 43:55.896
That is a great thing that has happened, when
you are on this Earth, when you are the ones

43:55.896 --> 43:59.336
who have to receive this great blessing.

43:59.336 --> 44:05.836
So many saints did not receive it, so many
great people who came on this Earth, they

44:05.836 --> 44:07.116
did not receive it.

44:07.116 --> 44:13.146
Even the incarnations who came on this Earth
could not do it what you are doing.

44:13.146 --> 44:21.826
So have that satisfaction and glory of your
own being and of your own standard, and of

44:21.826 --> 44:22.826
your own caliber.

44:22.826 --> 44:28.086
The others are not of your caliber, all right,
forget about it.

44:28.086 --> 44:34.406
That should not give you ego, but should give
you a personality that does not react.

44:34.406 --> 44:42.506
We have something of our own, we do not react
to things.

44:42.506 --> 44:45.526
We are not reactionaries.

44:45.526 --> 44:52.346
And things will disappear which are harmful.

44:52.346 --> 44:57.973
Everything will be perfectly all right, because
we are standing

44:58.002 --> 45:00.872
in our own perfection, in our own glory.

45:00.888 --> 45:02.435
What do we need?

45:02.521 --> 45:05.599
Nothing, just enjoying ourselves.

45:08.819 --> 45:11.412
May God bless you all.
