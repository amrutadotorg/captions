00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.400
Sahasrara Puja – “The Ghost of Materialism” 3rd May 1987

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.760
Thredbo, Australia

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.400
Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja yogis.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:53.000
It was a long time back that I desired

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.240
Sahasrara should be opened out, but waiting for a right time.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:22.360
It was important to do it at the right time.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:34.760
A boy in Aurangabad, quite young, asked Me a question, “Mother, this all-pervading

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:49.800
Power of Brahmachaitanya is beyond senses, you cannot feel it through senses.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.880
How is it we are now feeling it through our senses?”

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.360
This is the question he asked, and I ask you the same question.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:19.880
Before this, those people who got realization could not talk about it in the way you can

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.640
tell people, that you can feel it on your senses.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:34.200
They could not explain, they could not put it into experience.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:52.040
Just what they did was to tell them in words, words which were telling about something – like

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.240
the taste of mango, unless and until you eat the mango how will you know the taste?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.160
By just knowing about “it’s wonderful, it’s great, it’s fantastic,” still you

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.360
have not tasted the mango.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.480
So what has happened now, was the question.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.640
Another thing was that these people got so fed up, like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-one,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.040
he took a samadhi.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.720
He went into a room and closed the doors and settled down there, and he died there.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.400
All of them – even Christ got Himself crucified.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:51.840
Because they could tell a parable, they could tell a simile, but what had happened to them

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:04.920
that they could not explain, and they felt so sad and so frustrated.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.760
In a way they finished their life very early.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:21.320
This was the question.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.960
So what was the secret, can any one of you tell Me?

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:08.920
The answer is simple, but it’s difficult to digest.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:27.320
The answer is that all these incarnations who came on this Earth were part of the Sahasrara,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.240
were part of the Brahmachaitanya, were part of the Adi Shakti.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:48.280
They came on this Earth, gave realization to some people who were excellent, good people

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.800
who had no problems; as if they came out of the ocean of love

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.440
and took all of them to the ocean of love, to enjoy that ocean.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.160
As Kabira has said that “When a drop becomes the ocean, what can I say?”

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.760
(“Jub mast hue, phir kya bole?”)

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.800
So many of them took to mauna, that is silence.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:26.800
They disappeared, they got dissolved completely into the ocean of love.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.840
But you did not get dissolved.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:49.800
Something special has happened to you, that the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole ocean

00:06:50.200 --> 00:07:06.680
has taken the form of a cloud – that’s Adi Shakti – and has come on this Earth

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:15.560
to shower the chaitanya on you people,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:23.560
enrich you, nurture you, develop you,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:39.720
by manifesting the love in such a manner that you have entered into the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:48.600
So like one pitcher which is in the River Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of
the Adi Shakti.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.320
Your entity, your personality is preserved.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:02.760
Despite that you feel the Brahmachaitanya through your senses

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.600
and you can give realizations
to others,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.080
but you are in the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:18.440
As long as you are in the body of Adi Shakti you can do all that.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.240
This is the greatest thing that has happened.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.400
The whole of the Sahasrara has opened out with all the seven peethas

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.080
of all the deities,
who are just part and parcel of it.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:43.280
The whole of it has come in the form of a Mother who is humble, who is deceptive, illusive,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.400
who is Mahamaya.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.880
It’s the greatest thing that could happen to human beings and to the whole universe,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.240
that now you can get your realization, you can give realizations to others,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:13.520
you can understand through your senses, through your logic what is vibrations, what it does.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:22.640
Just like the proof is here: all the flowers were dead last night,

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.200
finished with the heat of the people who were carrying them.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:33.880
And then I just put some vibrated water on them, and you see how they are.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.560
Brahmachaitanya has revived them, but their personality is there, they are all vibrated,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.600
and they are looking so fresh and beautiful.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.480
Same thing with you, you all look so fresh and beautiful,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.560
anybody can make out a Sahaja yogi.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.800
Under these circumstances one has to understand

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.560
that there are certain limitations which you have to observe.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.560
First of all, I have taken you in My body.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:19.400
A foreign thing has to go in the body and it has to be looked after, nurtured.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:30.480
But if you become troublesome, then you’ll be thrown out, I can’t bear you.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.440
Some people are extremely troublesome.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:45.400
They do not meditate, they have their own ideas about meditation,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.280
they do not develop themselves, they do not mature,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.760
they live in the past or in the future,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.800
and such people
are troublesome.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.840
A simple thing I’d requested you all, to put some ghee in the nose,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.600
which is a very
simple thing but is very important.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:20.800
You all suffer from a very bad Hamsa, and one of the things that is a symptom

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.880
in a AIDS case is a bad Hamsa.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:35.960
You’ll be vulnerable to AIDS – and a small thing like that is not observed.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:47.760
It has to be a religious obligation that you must listen to Me, whatever I say.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.720
Actually you must obey Me.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.960
My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My feet obey Me;

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:02.280
what about you, who are raised to the great dignity

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:16.480
and the great position of being the yogis in the body of the Adi Shakti,

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:24.000
and they are acting as cells in My body?

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:38.240
First and foremost thing is, to do this kind of a venture,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:50.840
to put all kinds of things in your body is a very daring thing,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.280
and the process is also very hazardous.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:12.160
This has to be achieved with great patience, love, compassion and above all, hard labor.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:26.200
This has to be regarded as the greatest thing, that Sahasrara was opened by Me.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:35.760
Of course I am the master of Sahasrara, I am the master of all the chakras,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:42.160
but also I’m beyond Sahasrara, much beyond it.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:48.880
If that is the situation, you should be careful about your Sahasrara – that is Me –

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.720
and looking after your own heart

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.560
which is the Brahmarandra peetha here,

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.640
which opens out ultimately when you get your realization.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:11.680
Sahaja Yoga is spreading everywhere horizontally; vertically it must also spread.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:18.360
And there, if you really have proper understanding of what I am,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.440
Sahasrara should be absolutely clearcut.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.440
And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you must listen to whatever I have told you,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:34.480
obey it as absolutely a ordained thing.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.880
To keep the Sahasrara clean is to open your heart.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.920
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill it up with My love?

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:57.960
Open your heart to your fellow yogis and yoginis.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.720
Don’t get worried about what has happened in the past,

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.640
don’t get worried about what has happened in your life

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.840
as far as your relationships are concerned.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:19.160
Such things won’t happen now in Sahaja Yoga, they cannot happen.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.880
It has been worked out that way, it cannot happen.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.320
If this hand is paining, the other hand is there to help it out.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:35.520
You’re not alone, you are in the body of the collective being.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.600
If there are stupid people, if there are idiotic people,

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.640
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such people.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.920
In Sanskrit language they are called as “mudhahs.”

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:56.640
Neither this is meant for people who are over-smart and trying to cheat themselves

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:07.040
– intelligence has that capacity – and to indulge into things which are not Sahaj.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.080
Slowly you will find your vibrations will disappear,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:21.880
you’ll become sick, you’ll have problems and you’ll be in trouble.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.720
This is not a kind of a warning but a request, because you are in My body,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:44.480
and whenever anybody tries to be troublesome in My body I have to bear it up, and suffer a lot.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.720
It’s a funny type of a crucifixion when every moment

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:59.520
you are hanged onto a cross by anyone who wants to do it.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:10.680
Sahaja yogis have all the laws in their hands to torture My life, to trouble Me

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:21.160
if they want to; but they have also such a capacity, such a caliber,

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:27.400
such a potential that they can reside in My heart forever.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.160
Open your hearts, that’s the thing I will say.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.760
Now we have to see what keeps our hearts closed.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:49.600
Firstly it keeps our heart in a binding, the fear of the past.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:55.080
In the past if you have done anything wrong, in the past

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:02.240
we have had bad experiences of
people, we are very frightened.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:09.400
I’ve seen, I’m surprised, I’ve seen it Myself that in England

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:15.800
when we were staying – it was that day unluckily or luckily

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:22.720
it was snowing for the first time, and we were shifting, so I had gone out.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:28.320
And when I came back I saw a lady and a little baby in a pram,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.960
standing at the door and talking
to some lady.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.440
The other lady was just talking through a little opening

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.000
in the door, because there
was a chain on.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.640
Then I went out and came back after half-an-hour, and I saw the same thing.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:55.800
The lady was still standing in the snow, and this lady was talking to her through a chink.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.280
I was surprised.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.920
What is this going like “Midsummer’s Night’s Dream,”

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.840
these people are talking to each other – horrible!

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.080
What was it that was frightening to this lady inside the room,

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.200
what this lady would have done with the child, who had come to her door?

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.560
What was there to be so frightened of?

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:27.320
Because of the ego within yourself: you have frightened others, you have tortured others,

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.080
you have dominated others, you have done all these things,

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:39.440
so there is fear in your mind that others may do the same thing to you.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.360
Or what is there to be so much frightened,

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.280
to lock your doors to everyone who comes to
your house?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.560
Secondly, maybe you might have been tortured by someone or troubled by someone,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.200
so your heart is closed, you can’t open heart to others.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.960
People just don’t talk, they just keep “mum.”

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.920
What has happened?

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.200
Just like a dead body moving about.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:21.720
Supposing I was like this, who would have told you the secrets of Sahaja Yoga and Sahasrara?

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:28.160
So this kind of a nature comes from people who are frightened in the past perhaps,

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:34.000
or they might have frightened people with their bad Vishuddhi.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:45.120
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in the West, and that also is inherited by you
people.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:51.200
As soon as you put them onto something, they become aggressive.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.920
I can’t bear it within Myself.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:02.480
Supposing I have some sort of a medicine that makes some cells very aggressive,

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:08.480
then what happens? Ultimately I become a patient of cancer.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:18.280
An aggressive cell is called as the malignant cell,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:24.320
and such a cell cannot give you proper attention, cannot give you proper depth,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.720
but you become nothing but a malignant cell,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.560
a cell which is creating a cancer.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:37.760
And such a person creates cancer among Sahaja yogis.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:47.080
I’ve heard horrible stories about how some women, some men have become aggressive.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.000
With a little position they get, immediately they become aggressive.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:59.560
Say somebody is a wife of a organizer, or a so-called leader’s,

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:07.080
then she thinks she is nothing but a prime minister or something

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.960
– or her husband becomes something.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:15.520
This aggressiveness adds to the aggressiveness of another person.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.720
So then reaction starts.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.720
One says something, the another says something; we become reactionaries.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:28.600
We haven’t got something of our own, that we should be reactionaries?

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.080
There should be no reaction to anything,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.440
because we have something of our own.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.480
Why should we react to something, whatever people are doing to us or have done to us?

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.800
– it’s finished.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.600
Open your hearts.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:52.560
That’s why when you came to India, I think you must have noticed that in the Indian heart

00:22:52.680 --> 00:23:00.800
there is nothing like an anger for say, for English or for Portuguese,

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.480
or for anybody
who has dominated them.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.080
They have so much love and affection and respect,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.640
and they see that what good you have done
to them.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:18.560
Like some barristers came to India and they visited some high courts,

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.480
and they had holiday for one day to celebrate

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:29.680
the visit of these British lawyers and barristers.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:38.080
But if you go to England they will beat you, throw you out.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:47.120
This aggressiveness has to go from your heart, it has to get out of it.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:53.360
There’s no place in My body for aggressive people, no place at all.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:01.760
I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn’t aggress Me.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.320
If you aggress any Sahaja yogi, you are aggressing Me.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.960
But when it comes to others, they won’t aggress others.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:20.280
Like a bad husband will aggress his wife, but not other people.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.200
So those who are non-Sahaja yogis, they do not aggress them.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:33.080
That’s a very important part of Sahasrara, because ego covers a great part of Sahasrara,

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:39.760
and if your Sahasrara is covered with this ego business,

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.520
how can I help you and how can I help Myself?

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:49.800
Now so many of you are in My body, just imagine, circulating fast;

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:56.520
and most of them are fighting

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.920
to be in My heart, but they are settling in My ego.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:09.840
Well, I am egoless, because I have no reactions.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.640
If you have no reaction you cannot develop ego.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:19.480
I’ve no reactions, I’m reactionless.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:33.560
I am in My own peace and glory, trying to work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:47.080
I do not react to anything, but your reactions trouble Me because you are within Me.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:53.960
Then the second part is the fear that comes from childhood.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:26:01.160
I do not know about Americans, but so many Americans who came to Me

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:06.560
were half-mad, cracked people, absolutely cracked in the head,

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.520
nothing normal about them. Either they will not talk

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.240
– if they talk they talk irrelevantly, you don’t know what they are talking about.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:24.720
Same with the French. French were mad much before anybody was mad in this world, I think;

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.280
very cracky people you see, very difficult, it’s absolutely

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.320
can’t understand, everything upside-down.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.000
When you blame our Indian telephone,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:45.320
you must know they were made by French.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:54.720
I always say that in Pune we have got the telephone just to see,

00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:00.480
because it is called as “Punya Patnam” – means the, is the “city of punyas” –

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:09.640
and only God can listen to this telephone, but even God cannot!

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:15.960
So this kind of a crackedness, or this what you call

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.520
this madness, aggressive madness,

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:30.280
comes from ego going to the level of super-ego;

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.960
and they get first of all “what’s wrong?”

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:43.760
When they talk you feel they are fighting, and these are love talks, “romantic” they

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.840
say, and we feel they are fighting.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:54.600
And then after some time the aggressiveness is very apparent,

00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:01.280
and then it becomes as if they are off their heads, absolutely off their heads.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.080
And it’s very common with Americans, very common.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:13.000
You can’t find Americans when they are talking, any good speaker,

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:18.280
who doesn’t have twitches on his faces, on his body, everywhere,

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:24.080
because so many nerves have been already strained

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.720
with this kind of “what’s wrong?” business.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.200
Going to the other extreme of deciding everything for yourself.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:50.800
And the thing behind is a ghost, I should say, a very big ghost,

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.800
and which is not in the past or the future, but in the present.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.280
And that ghost I call it as materialism.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:05.800
Materialism – it’s a ghost, it’s a horrible devil

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:15.280
that has come onto the heads of Americans, and from them to all of us.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:21.360
This materialism is a horrible stuff.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:33.120
It’s so ridiculous, shameful, doesn’t even suit a human person; even a dog

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:41.000
would hate such a materialism, to what level human beings have gone.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:52.040
This materialism makes a person absolutely shameless.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:30:00.000
A lady would not mind asking another lady:

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:05.320
“By the way, have you got my spoons with
you?”

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.480
There’s no shame in it.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:17.800
When we were small we were told in India – I mean, that’s our culture –

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:24.960
that if somebody’s pin is in your house you should preserve it and return it,

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.800
but even if your diamond is lost with somebody, never ask for it.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.760
Is not good manners.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:43.000
What is more valuable is not the diamond, is the relationship,

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:50.240
is the friendship, and the emotions of human beings to be respected.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.240
How can you ask?

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.480
If there was a diamond they would have found it and would have given it to you,

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:01.760
but if there is no asking for that or reporting like that

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.560
then it’s sure there’s no diamond; and even if it is there, doesn’t matter.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:12.760
After all, what is a diamond? – you are wearing or they are wearing, what does it
matter?

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:22.680
In My father’s house all the doors were open all the time, all the doors, day and
night.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.240
Never a thief came in, thought that doors are open so nothing is locked,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.200
there’s nothing precious.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.760
Only we had one theft, and the thief came

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.520
and took away a gramophone from us, and some
records.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.480
So My father said, “He’s a connoisseur.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.920
He took the right thing from this house, so let it be.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.120
What’s the use of informing the police?”

00:31:52.960 --> 00:32:02.200
So this materialism that comes in is a mad, mad, mad dog,

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:10.000
and gives you a disease which is worse than any disease that is possible.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:18.200
How people play on it, on this disease, as you must have known that doctors

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.280
when you
get some disease little bit, t

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.760
hey’ll take out your teeth, take out your eyes, take out your nose, take out

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.880
your purse and take out everything that you have,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.840
for a little thing like malaria or something.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:40.480
But this disease takes away everything that is beautiful within you,

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.720
that is good within
you.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.480
For example, it started a fashion.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.520
With this materialism they start fashions.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.600
Ladies are more vulnerable.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:01.760
Fashion starts, any sort of fashion starts, like the sleeves to be made long,

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.040
in India also they started – then make it short,

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.840
then make it half, then make it no sleeves.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.720
I said, “I am not running that race.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:17.320
I will have the sleeves all the time, same sleeves so I don’t have to bother.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.600
I can tell My tailor and he can make whatever way I want to have,

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:27.720
the tailor, because he knows I make one style” – finished with it.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.000
Why do people want to run with the fashion?

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:37.760
Just think of it, what is the need to run with the fashion?

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.840
Now new race has started, run with it.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.880
Then another race has started, run with it.
Then the third race has started, run with it.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.040
All the time running with the mad race of fashions.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:59.600
Now a new race has started of fashions not to put any oil in the head,

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.000
so you become
bald, then you buy wigs.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:09.000
It’s all entrepreneurs who are working out, it’s all enterprises.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:20.400
So you become absolutely bald-headed people, then you get your wigs from them,

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:26.640
then there
is a special charge for dressing the wigs, so you go for dressing the wigs.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.680
Goes on like mad.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:38.120
Then there’s another type: now a new fashion has started in London

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:43.200
because, you see, these
people want to make some money.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.800
People don’t even have so much of logic and intelligence left in their heads

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:53.040
to see
that what they were preaching one day, they are just the thing against it.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:35:00.120
Formerly it was you had to wear a tail coat, you had to have your hair absolutely done

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:07.200
with proper hair-grooming and all that, as you can see in the old pictures.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:12.760
Then it started striped three-piece suits.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:19.040
Now it is, I mean, few days earlier was tight clothes,

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.160
then they developed varicose veins, you see.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:27.800
So no, no – now it is the fashion to wear absolutely loose dresses.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:34.760
I saw the other day one lady making a dress out of a big blanket, going like this.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:39.680
I thought she was some priest or someone!

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.280
So that stupidity has started.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:54.560
Imagine – think of Sahasrara, think of Divine, in what world we are,

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:59.080
and in what world the stupid people are going.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:04.720
That’s another world, absolutely another stupid world

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.640
where people just go after nonsensical things,

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.680
changing from one to another, changing from everything:

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.000
ties are changed, everything
is changed, giving you such a headache.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.240
All the time you have to think, “Now what fashion is there?

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.280
Let’s find out in the newspaper.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.560
What is – this is the fashion now. All right, wear this dress.”

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:32.560
All this is befooling going on, because this ghost has entered into us.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.840
In Sahaja Yoga also when we enter, be careful,

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:42.400
materialism should not enter into your minds.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.560
It’s nothing important.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.440
Even when somebody dies you are supposed to wear something black,

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.280
or white or I don’t
know what else, but white or black.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:02.200
And somebody died in England who was a great friend of My husband,

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.400
and I had no black sari, completely black.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.920
I mean we don’t have such a sari.
I didn’t know what to do.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.880
I told My husband I don’t have a black sari. He said, “Then You don’t come.”

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Imagine how his wife would feel if I don’t go to the thing, how she would take it.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:25.760
All this is nothing, what is important is the black sari!

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:33.560
In every walk of life you are being befooled by this materialism.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:39.400
I don’t know how you got stuck into it first of all.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.920
And the other side is, the same people are befooling you.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:48.400
“All right, this is not good, this is too much” – so go to the anti-culture.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:55.520
What is anti-culture is another kind of materialism, another kind of nonsense.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:00.000
Nowadays they are having in this London an anti-culture movement

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.240
which is called as “punks.”

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:08.560
I think out of date now Me, but still what’s for the time being as I see is punks.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.960
It costs them forty pounds sometimes to make that hair.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:19.040
I mean, is it something that you are saving money on that?

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:26.840
So the whole thing works out just to take out your attention from reality,

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:33.560
from higher
values, to something nonsensical.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:44.520
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead a life of collectivity.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:51.760
It’s very important that we have to be collective.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:57.920
We shouldn’t talk of “This is mine, this is mine, and this I own.”

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:03.160
Even about children you should not do like that, “This is my own child, this is my

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.360
own baby.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:12.760
This is my brother, this is my sister.”

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:18.280
This “my, my” should go away; but that’s not possible, it’s not easy to forget about

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.880
it because left Nabhi and right Nabhi has to be all right.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.120
The only way to do it is that “Mother, it’s all Yours.”

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:36.480
It’s not dangerous to say that, because I’ll never take anything that is supposed

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.320
to be yours.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:45.040
Just to say, “Mother, it’s all Yours,” to start it – “It’s all Yours.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:53.080
I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all my things are Yours, my life is Yours.”

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:58.200
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrara.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:07.280
The deity of Sahasrara is a very simple person, extremely simple, and can be moved with very

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:12.960
little actions, can be pleased with very few little actions here and there.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.480
Not much is needed to please the deity of Sahasrara.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:26.800
It’s a very simple person; little things make Her happy.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:32.480
Yesterday you had brought the flowers, and I didn’t take them.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.240
You all must have thought, “What’s it, we couldn’t give flowers to Mother, holding

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.360
in our hand.”

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:42.560
But I wanted to show this miracle to you, that’s why I didn’t take.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:48.440
And I took it in the end, and see now they are the best among all of them; don’t they

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:54.360
look as if they have been plucked from the tree?

00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:00.480
Just I wanted to show this, so I said, “I’m tired,” I sat down and then I looked at

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:08.840
you with the flowers, you see, in the hands, you’re sitting all of you!

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:18.440
So She is Leela Vinodini.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:26.960
She plays around, makes little mischiefs here and there for you to learn lessons.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:33.640
Because if I tell you “Do this” then it’s not possible, but little circuitous way I

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.360
can show you that this is wrong, you should not do it.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:43.240
There’s nothing to feel bad, I would have taken all the flowers; but somebody must have

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.880
thought of it, why Mother has not taken the flowers today.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:55.200
I don’t know if you thought of it or not, but I knew it Myself that I have to take the

00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.640
flowers to show this miracle to them, that these flowers are going to last much longer

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:08.040
than any other flowers, because they are vibrated with the Brahmachaitanya.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.080
And the water was very, very, very cold, so even I opened a hot water tap.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:21.960
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, they didn’t die, despite that they are perfectly all right.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:28.760
So you have seen so many miracles of this Brahmachaitanya which is showing on your photographs,

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:36.400
on so many your lives, in so many changes that have taken place within yourself, within

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.600
your family, within every one of you.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.960
All this has happened because you are in Brahmachaitanya.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:51.240
All this you are receiving because you are blessed by Brahmachaitanya.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.520
But others are not, so your attitude should be towards them that they are in the other

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.920
world – what to do, how to help them?

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:05.960
We should try to help them if possible, but up to a point.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.440
We should not drag down ourselves for others’ sake.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:14.600
Up to a point only we can help them, and we have to be very happy that Sahaja Yoga is

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.120
spreading so much horizontally.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.800
But for vertical thing we must know our quality must improve.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.600
If some people rise higher, others will also start rising with them.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:34.800
It’s the absolute honesty of purpose should be there, absolutely understanding should

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.320
be there.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.560
Open your hearts to each other, so that you open your hearts to Me.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.920
Every cell must know another cell, otherwise it won’t work out.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:55.760
That is a great thing that has happened, when you are on this Earth, when you are the ones

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.200
who have to receive this great blessing.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:05.680
So many saints did not receive it, so many great people who came on this Earth, they

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.960
did not receive it.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:13.000
Even the incarnations who came on this Earth could not do it what you are doing.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:21.680
So have that satisfaction and glory of your own being and of your own standard, and of

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.680
your own caliber.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:27.920
The others are not of your caliber, all right, forget about it.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:34.240
That should not give you ego, but should give you a personality that does not react.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:42.360
We have something of our own, we do not react to things.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.360
We are not reactionaries.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:52.200
And things will disappear which are harmful.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.840
Everything will be perfectly all right, because we are standing

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.720
in our own perfection, in our own glory.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.360
What do we need?

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.560
Nothing, just enjoying ourselves.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.360
May God bless you all.
