00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:25.315
LIGNE 349 Sahasrara Puja – “The Ghost of Materialism” 3rd May 1987

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:26.746
Thredbo, Australia

00:00:31.643 --> 00:00:38.403
Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja yogis.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:01:03.124
It was a long time back that I desired Sahasrara should be opened out,

00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:14.836
but waiting for a right time. 
It was important to do it at the right time.

00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:31.704
A boy in Aurangabad, quite young, asked Me a question,

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:39.765
“Mother, this all-pervading Power of Brahmachaitanya

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:49.916
is beyond senses, you cannot feel it through senses.

00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:56.786
How is it we are now feeling it through our senses?”

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:05.263
This is the question he asked, and I ask you the same question.

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:19.313
Before this, those people who got realization
could not talk about it in the way you can tell people,

00:02:19.513 --> 00:02:24.643
that you can feel it on your senses.

00:02:24.906 --> 00:02:33.993
They could not explain, they could not put it into experience.

00:02:34.193 --> 00:02:41.893
Just what they did was to tell them in words,

00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:51.795
words which were telling about something,

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:57.500
like the taste of mango, unless and until you eat the mango

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.555
how will you know the taste? By just knowing
about “it’s wonderful, it’s great, it’s fantastic,”

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:10.450
still you have not tasted the mango.

00:03:11.372 --> 00:03:17.273
So what has happened now, was the question.

00:03:17.473 --> 00:03:20.493
Another thing was that these people got so fed up,

00:03:20.693 --> 00:03:26.083
like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-one, he took a samadhi.

00:03:26.284 --> 00:03:34.523
He went into a room and closed the doors
and settled down there, and he died there.

00:03:34.723 --> 00:03:42.185
All of them – even Christ got Himself crucified.

00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:51.330
Because they could tell a parable, they
could tell a simile, but what had happened

00:03:51.833 --> 00:04:03.773
to them that they could not explain,
and they felt so sad and so frustrated.

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:10.585
In a way they finished their life very early.

00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:15.690
This was the question.

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.399
So what was the secret, can any one of you tell Me?

00:04:56.338 --> 00:05:05.759
The answer is simple, but it’s difficult to digest.

00:05:11.968 --> 00:05:25.000
The answer is that all these incarnations who came on this Earth

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:36.434
were part of the Sahasrara, were part of the
Brahmachaitanya, were part of the Adi Shakti.

00:05:39.074 --> 00:05:48.235
They came on this Earth, gave realization to
some people who were excellent, good people

00:05:48.435 --> 00:05:54.815
who had no problems; as if they came out of the ocean of love

00:05:55.015 --> 00:06:00.485
and took all of them to the ocean of love, to enjoy that ocean.

00:06:00.685 --> 00:06:06.619
As Kabira has said that “When a drop
becomes the ocean, what can I say?”

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.435
(“Jub mast hue, phir kya bole?”)

00:06:14.085 --> 00:06:18.781
So many of them took to mauna, that is silence.

00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:26.752
They disappeared, they got dissolved
completely into the ocean of love.

00:06:30.481 --> 00:06:34.475
But you did not get dissolved.

00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:49.740
Something special has happened to you, that
the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole ocean

00:06:50.254 --> 00:07:04.487
has taken the form of a cloud – that’s
Adi Shakti – and has come on this Earth

00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:14.066
to shower the chaitanya on you people,

00:07:15.677 --> 00:07:23.415
enrich you, nurture you, develop you,

00:07:23.616 --> 00:07:39.558
by manifesting the love in such a manner that
you have entered into the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:39.925 --> 00:07:43.670
So like one pitcher which is in the River Ganges,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.765
you are like a cell in the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:54.280
Your entity, your personality is preserved.

00:07:54.487 --> 00:08:02.733
Despite that you feel the Brahmachaitanya through your senses

00:08:02.933 --> 00:08:09.017
and you can give realizations to others,
but you are in the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:08:09.218 --> 00:08:18.320
As long as you are in the body of Adi Shakti you can do all that.

00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:20.963
This is the greatest thing that has happened.

00:08:21.164 --> 00:08:28.611
The whole of the Sahasrara has opened
out with all the seven peethas of all the deities,

00:08:28.812 --> 00:08:31.117
who are just part and parcel of it.

00:08:31.286 --> 00:08:38.478
The whole of it has come in the form of a Mother who is humble,

00:08:38.678 --> 00:08:46.753
who is deceptive, illusive, who is Mahamaya.

00:08:50.057 --> 00:08:54.560
It’s the greatest thing that could happen to human beings and

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:04.173
to the whole universe, that now you can get
your realization, you can give realizations to others,

00:09:04.373 --> 00:09:14.189
you can understand through your senses,
through your logic what is vibrations, what it does.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:22.636
Just like the proof is here: all the flowers were dead last night,

00:09:22.836 --> 00:09:28.131
finished with the heat of the people who were carrying them.

00:09:28.332 --> 00:09:33.868
And then I just put some vibrated
water on them, and you see how they are.

00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:42.503
Brahmachaitanya has revived them, but
their personality is there, they are all vibrated,

00:09:42.704 --> 00:09:47.238
and they are looking so fresh and beautiful.

00:09:48.878 --> 00:09:57.452
Same thing with you, you all look so fresh and
beautiful, anybody can make out a Sahaja yogi.

00:09:57.572 --> 00:10:01.766
Under these circumstances one has to understand

00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:05.505
that there are certain limitations which you have to observe.

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:10.514
First of all, I have taken you in My body.

00:10:10.714 --> 00:10:19.599
A foreign thing has to go in the body
and it has to be looked after, nurtured.

00:10:20.893 --> 00:10:31.844
But if you become troublesome, then
you’ll be thrown out, I can’t bear you.

00:10:32.044 --> 00:10:36.424
Some people are extremely troublesome.

00:10:36.624 --> 00:10:45.283
They do not meditate, they have their own ideas about meditation,

00:10:45.483 --> 00:10:51.250
they do not develop themselves, they do not mature,

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:58.069
they live in the past or in the future,

00:10:58.269 --> 00:11:00.731
and such people are troublesome.

00:11:00.932 --> 00:11:07.403
A simple thing I’d requested you all, to put some ghee in the nose,

00:11:07.604 --> 00:11:10.493
which is a very simple thing but is very important.

00:11:10.694 --> 00:11:20.631
You all suffer from a very bad Hamsa,
and one of the things that is a symptom

00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:26.231
in a AIDS case is a bad Hamsa.

00:11:26.557 --> 00:11:38.234
You’ll be vulnerable to AIDS – and a
small thing like that is not observed.

00:11:38.434 --> 00:11:47.749
It has to be a religious obligation that
you must listen to Me, whatever I say.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.584
Actually you must obey Me.

00:11:50.784 --> 00:11:55.917
My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My feet obey Me;

00:11:56.117 --> 00:12:02.212
what about you, who are raised to the great dignity

00:12:02.412 --> 00:12:16.482
and the great position of being the
yogis in the body of the Adi Shakti,

00:12:16.683 --> 00:12:23.949
and they are acting as cells in My body?

00:12:30.896 --> 00:12:37.509
First and foremost thing is, to do this kind of a venture,

00:12:37.709 --> 00:12:43.234
to put all kinds of things in your body

00:12:43.434 --> 00:12:52.143
is a very daring thing,

00:12:52.343 --> 00:12:59.026
and the process is also very hazardous.

00:13:00.424 --> 00:13:13.451
This has to be achieved with great patience,
love, compassion and above all, hard labor.

00:13:17.124 --> 00:13:26.813
This has to be regarded as the greatest
thing, that Sahasrara was opened by Me.

00:13:27.013 --> 00:13:35.654
Of course I am the master of Sahasrara,
I am the master of all the chakras,

00:13:35.854 --> 00:13:42.046
but also I’m beyond Sahasrara, much beyond it.

00:13:42.259 --> 00:13:48.784
If that is the situation, you should be
careful about your Sahasrara – that is Me –

00:13:48.985 --> 00:13:57.495
and looking after your own heart
which is the Brahmarandra peetha here,

00:13:57.695 --> 00:14:03.500
which opens out ultimately when you get your realization.

00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:11.654
Sahaja Yoga is spreading everywhere
horizontally; vertically it must also spread.

00:14:11.854 --> 00:14:18.224
And there, if you really have proper understanding of what I am,

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:21.313
Sahasrara should be absolutely clearcut.

00:14:21.513 --> 00:14:26.473
And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you
must listen to whatever I have told you,

00:14:26.673 --> 00:14:34.467
obey it as absolutely a ordained thing.

00:14:39.343 --> 00:14:43.837
To keep the Sahasrara clean is to open your heart.

00:14:44.038 --> 00:14:50.895
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill it up with My love?

00:14:51.096 --> 00:14:56.357
Open your heart to your fellow yogis and yoginis.

00:14:58.132 --> 00:15:01.566
Don’t get worried about what has happened in the past,

00:15:01.766 --> 00:15:06.574
don’t get worried about what has happened in your life

00:15:06.774 --> 00:15:11.980
as far as your relationships are concerned.

00:15:12.181 --> 00:15:19.131
Such things won’t happen now in Sahaja Yoga, they cannot happen.

00:15:19.332 --> 00:15:22.893
It has been worked out that way, it cannot happen.

00:15:23.093 --> 00:15:28.304
If this hand is paining, the other hand is there to help it out.

00:15:28.505 --> 00:15:35.473
You’re not alone, you are in the body of the collective being.

00:15:35.674 --> 00:15:40.612
If there are stupid people, if there are idiotic people,

00:15:40.812 --> 00:15:45.833
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such people.

00:15:46.033 --> 00:15:48.904
In Sanskrit language they are called as “mudhahs.”

00:15:49.105 --> 00:15:53.906
Neither this is meant for people who are over-smart

00:15:54.106 --> 00:16:01.627
and trying to cheat themselves – intelligence has that capacity –

00:16:01.827 --> 00:16:07.914
and to indulge into things which are not Sahaj.

00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:13.045
Slowly you will find your vibrations will disappear,

00:16:13.245 --> 00:16:22.018
you’ll become sick, you’ll have problems and you’ll be in trouble.

00:16:22.218 --> 00:16:32.380
This is not a kind of a warning but a request,
because you are in My body, and whenever

00:16:34.224 --> 00:16:44.474
anybody tries to be troublesome in My
body I have to bear it up, and suffer a lot.

00:16:46.812 --> 00:16:52.647
It’s a funny type of a crucifixion when every moment

00:16:52.847 --> 00:17:00.604
you are hanged onto a cross by anyone who wants to do it.

00:17:03.577 --> 00:17:08.466
Sahaja yogis have all the laws in their hands to torture My life,

00:17:08.666 --> 00:17:12.879
to trouble Me if they want to;

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:21.229
but they have also such a capacity, such a caliber,

00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:27.955
such a potential that they can reside in My heart forever.

00:17:28.156 --> 00:17:34.324
Open your hearts, that’s the thing I will say.

00:17:34.524 --> 00:17:39.744
Now we have to see what keeps our hearts closed.

00:17:39.944 --> 00:17:49.604
Firstly it keeps our heart in a binding, the fear of the past.

00:17:49.804 --> 00:17:57.674
In the past if you have done anything wrong,
in the past we have had bad experiences of

00:17:57.874 --> 00:18:01.004
people, we are very frightened.

00:18:01.204 --> 00:18:10.314
I’ve seen, I’m surprised, I’ve seen it
Myself that in England when we were staying

00:18:10.514 --> 00:18:20.284
– it was that day unluckily or luckily it
was snowing for the first time, and we were

00:18:20.484 --> 00:18:22.724
shifting, so I had gone out.

00:18:22.931 --> 00:18:28.231
And when I came back I saw a lady and a little baby in a pram,

00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:32.830
standing at the door and talking to some lady.

00:18:32.951 --> 00:18:40.004
The other lady was just talking through
a little opening in the door, because there

00:18:40.204 --> 00:18:41.913
was a chain on.

00:18:42.113 --> 00:18:49.634
Then I went out and came back after
half-an-hour, and I saw the same thing.

00:18:49.834 --> 00:18:55.793
The lady was still standing in the snow, and
this lady was talking to her through a chink.

00:18:55.993 --> 00:18:58.264
I was surprised.

00:18:58.464 --> 00:19:03.564
What is this going like “Midsummer’s
Night’s Dream,” these people are talking to each

00:19:03.764 --> 00:19:06.814
other – horrible!

00:19:07.014 --> 00:19:12.844
What was it that was frightening to this lady
inside the room – what this lady would have

00:19:13.044 --> 00:19:16.024
done with the child, who had come to her door?

00:19:16.224 --> 00:19:19.774
What was there to be so frightened of?

00:19:19.974 --> 00:19:27.173
Because of the ego within yourself: you
have frightened others, you have tortured others,

00:19:27.373 --> 00:19:34.854
you have dominated others, you have done
all these things, so there is fear in your mind

00:19:35.054 --> 00:19:39.834
that others may do the same thing to you.

00:19:40.034 --> 00:19:44.094
Or what is there to be so much frightened,
to lock your doors to everyone who comes to

00:19:44.294 --> 00:19:49.244
your house?

00:19:49.444 --> 00:19:56.964
Secondly, maybe you might have been tortured
by someone or troubled by someone, so your

00:19:57.164 --> 00:20:00.704
heart is closed, you can’t open heart to others.

00:20:00.904 --> 00:20:04.934
People just don’t talk, they just keep “mum.”

00:20:05.134 --> 00:20:07.374
What has happened?

00:20:07.574 --> 00:20:11.634
Just like a dead body moving about.

00:20:11.834 --> 00:20:21.763
Supposing I was like this, who would have told
you the secrets of Sahaja Yoga and Sahasrara?

00:20:21.963 --> 00:20:28.304
So this kind of a nature comes from people
who are frightened in the past perhaps, or

00:20:28.504 --> 00:20:35.344
they might have frightened people with their bad Vishuddhi.

00:20:35.544 --> 00:20:39.674
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in the West,

00:20:39.794 --> 00:20:45.434
and that also is inherited by you people.

00:20:45.555 --> 00:20:49.814
As soon as you put them onto something, they become aggressive.

00:20:50.014 --> 00:20:53.494
I can’t bear it within Myself.

00:20:53.694 --> 00:21:03.403
Supposing I have some sort of a medicine that
makes some cells very aggressive, then what happens?

00:21:03.603 --> 00:21:07.033
Ultimately I become a patient of cancer.

00:21:07.233 --> 00:21:20.344
An aggressive cell is called as the malignant
cell, and such a cell cannot give you proper

00:21:20.544 --> 00:21:28.174
attention, cannot give you proper depth,
but you become nothing but a malignant cell, a

00:21:28.374 --> 00:21:32.544
cell which is creating a cancer.

00:21:32.744 --> 00:21:36.944
And such a person creates cancer among Sahaja yogis.

00:21:37.144 --> 00:21:47.084
I’ve heard horrible stories about how some
women, some men have become aggressive.

00:21:47.284 --> 00:21:51.554
With a little position they get, immediately they become aggressive.

00:21:51.754 --> 00:22:00.804
Say somebody is a wife of a organizer,
or a so-called leader’s, then she thinks she

00:22:01.004 --> 00:22:09.964
is nothing but a prime minister or something
– or her husband becomes something.

00:22:10.164 --> 00:22:15.524
This aggressiveness adds to the aggressiveness of another person.

00:22:15.724 --> 00:22:17.344
So then reaction starts.

00:22:17.544 --> 00:22:21.644
One says something, the another says
something; we become reactionaries.

00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:27.074
We haven’t got something of our own, that we should be reactionaries?

00:22:27.274 --> 00:22:35.184
There should be no reaction to anything,
because we have something of our own.

00:22:35.384 --> 00:22:41.363
Why should we react to something, whatever
people are doing to us or have done to us?

00:22:41.563 --> 00:22:42.793
– it’s finished.

00:22:42.993 --> 00:22:44.934
Open your hearts.

00:22:45.134 --> 00:22:51.594
That’s why when you came to India, I think
you must have noticed that in the Indian heart

00:22:51.794 --> 00:23:02.033
there is nothing like an anger for say, for
English or for Portuguese, or for anybody

00:23:02.233 --> 00:23:04.364
who has dominated them.

00:23:04.564 --> 00:23:12.634
They have so much love and affection and respect,
and they see that what good you have done to them.

00:23:12.834 --> 00:23:20.274
Like some barristers came to India and they
visited some high courts, and they had holiday

00:23:20.474 --> 00:23:31.614
for one day to celebrate the visit of
these British lawyers and barristers.

00:23:31.814 --> 00:23:40.174
But if you go to England they will beat you, throw you out.

00:23:40.374 --> 00:23:46.444
This aggressiveness has to go
from your heart, it has to get out of it.

00:23:46.644 --> 00:23:55.314
There’s no place in My body for aggressive people, no place at all.

00:23:55.514 --> 00:24:03.844
I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn’t aggress Me.

00:24:04.044 --> 00:24:08.254
If you aggress any Sahaja yogi, you are aggressing Me.

00:24:08.454 --> 00:24:12.034
But when it comes to others, they won’t aggress others.

00:24:12.234 --> 00:24:20.293
Like a bad husband will aggress his wife, but not other people.

00:24:20.493 --> 00:24:24.064
So those who are non-Sahaja yogis, they do not aggress them.

00:24:24.264 --> 00:24:32.663
That’s a very important part of Sahasrara,
because ego covers a great part of Sahasrara,

00:24:32.863 --> 00:24:41.413
and if your Sahasrara is covered with this
ego business, how can I help you and how can

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:43.324
I help Myself?

00:24:43.524 --> 00:24:56.814
Now so many of you are in My body, just
imagine, circulating fast; and most of them are fighting

00:24:57.014 --> 00:25:00.574
to be in My heart, but they are settling in My ego.

00:25:00.774 --> 00:25:09.844
Well, I am egoless, because I have no reactions.

00:25:10.044 --> 00:25:12.864
If you have no reaction you cannot develop ego.

00:25:13.064 --> 00:25:17.584
I’ve no reactions, I’m reactionless.

00:25:17.784 --> 00:25:33.564
I am in My own peace and glory, trying to work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:33.764 --> 00:25:47.074
I do not react to anything, but your reactions
trouble Me because you are within Me.

00:25:47.274 --> 00:25:53.934
Then the second part is the fear that comes from childhood.

00:25:54.134 --> 00:26:02.474
I do not know about Americans, but so many
Americans who came to Me were half-mad, cracked

00:26:02.674 --> 00:26:07.744
people, absolutely cracked in the head, nothing normal about them.

00:26:07.944 --> 00:26:12.444
Either they will not talk – if they talk
they talk irrelevantly, you don’t know what

00:26:12.644 --> 00:26:13.884
they are talking about.

00:26:14.084 --> 00:26:16.055
Same with the French.

00:26:16.255 --> 00:26:26.304
French were mad much before anybody was
mad in this world, I think; very cracky people

00:26:26.504 --> 00:26:34.104
you see, very difficult, it’s absolutely
can’t understand, everything upside-down.

00:26:34.304 --> 00:26:45.374
When you blame our Indian telephone,
you must know they were made by French.

00:26:45.574 --> 00:26:55.444
I always say that in Pune we have got the
telephone just to see, because it is called

00:26:55.644 --> 00:27:01.535
as “Punya Patnam” – means the, is
the “city of punyas” – and only God can

00:27:01.735 --> 00:27:09.624
listen to this telephone, but even God cannot!

00:27:09.824 --> 00:27:20.494
So this kind of a crackedness, or this what
you call this madness, aggressive madness,

00:27:20.694 --> 00:27:36.124
comes from ego going to the level of
super-ego; and they get first of all “what’s wrong?”

00:27:36.324 --> 00:27:42.923
When they talk you feel they are fighting,
and these are love talks, “romantic” they

00:27:43.123 --> 00:27:46.814
say, and we feel they are fighting.

00:27:47.014 --> 00:27:55.663
And then after some time the aggressiveness
is very apparent, and then it becomes as if

00:27:55.863 --> 00:28:00.354
they are off their heads, absolutely off their heads.

00:28:00.554 --> 00:28:04.614
And it’s very common with Americans, very common.

00:28:04.814 --> 00:28:14.284
You can’t find Americans when they are talking,
any good speaker, who doesn’t have twitches

00:28:14.484 --> 00:28:20.923
on his faces, on his body, everywhere, because
so many nerves have been already strained

00:28:21.123 --> 00:28:34.694
with this kind of “what’s wrong?” business
– going to the other extreme of deciding

00:28:34.894 --> 00:28:37.184
everything for yourself.

00:28:37.384 --> 00:28:52.293
And the thing behind is a ghost, I should
say, a very big ghost, and which is not in

00:28:52.493 --> 00:28:55.804
the past or the future, but in the present.

00:28:56.004 --> 00:28:57.923
And that ghost I call it as materialism.

00:28:58.123 --> 00:29:09.104
Materialism – it’s a ghost, it’s a horrible devil
that has come onto the heads of Americans,

00:29:09.304 --> 00:29:15.254
and from them to all of us.

00:29:15.454 --> 00:29:19.724
This materialism is a horrible stuff.

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:33.114
It’s so ridiculous, shameful, doesn’t even
suit a human person; even a dog would

00:29:33.314 --> 00:29:45.554
hate such a materialism, to what level human beings have gone.

00:29:45.754 --> 00:29:52.023
This materialism makes a person absolutely shameless.

00:29:52.223 --> 00:30:03.754
A lady would not mind asking another lady,
“By the way, have you got my spoons with you?”

00:30:03.954 --> 00:30:07.474
There’s no shame in it.

00:30:07.674 --> 00:30:18.214
When we were small we were told in India
– I mean, that’s our culture – that if somebody’s

00:30:18.414 --> 00:30:26.344
pin is in your house you should preserve
it and return it, but even if your diamond is

00:30:26.544 --> 00:30:29.793
lost with somebody, never ask for it.

00:30:29.993 --> 00:30:35.064
Is not good manners.

00:30:35.264 --> 00:30:45.684
What is more valuable is not the diamond,
is the relationship, is the friendship, and

00:30:45.884 --> 00:30:50.234
the emotions of human beings to be respected.

00:30:50.434 --> 00:30:51.880
How can you ask?

00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:56.567
If there was a diamond they would have
found it and would have given it to you, but if

00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:01.819
there is no asking for that or reporting like that

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.605
then it’s sure there’s no diamond;
and even if it is there, doesn’t matter.

00:31:05.726 --> 00:31:14.854
After all, what is a diamond? – you are
wearing or they are wearing, what does it matter?

00:31:15.054 --> 00:31:22.077
In My father’s house all the doors were
open all the time, all the doors, day and night.

00:31:22.277 --> 00:31:28.724
Never a thief came in, thought that doors are
open so nothing is locked, there’s nothing precious.

00:31:28.924 --> 00:31:38.523
Only we had one theft, and the thief came and
took away a gramophone from us, and some records.

00:31:38.723 --> 00:31:40.854
So My father said, “He’s a connoisseur.

00:31:41.054 --> 00:31:44.264
He took the right thing from this house, so let it be.

00:31:44.464 --> 00:31:52.844
What’s the use of informing the police?”

00:31:53.044 --> 00:32:05.304
So this materialism that comes in is a mad,
mad, mad dog, and gives you a disease which

00:32:05.504 --> 00:32:09.984
is worse than any disease that is possible.

00:32:10.184 --> 00:32:18.724
How people play on it, on this disease, as
you must have known that doctors when you

00:32:18.924 --> 00:32:23.624
get some disease little bit, they’ll take
out your teeth, take out your eyes, take out

00:32:23.824 --> 00:32:29.274
your nose, take out your purse and take
out everything that you have, for a little thing

00:32:29.474 --> 00:32:32.384
like malaria or something.

00:32:32.584 --> 00:32:41.364
But this disease takes away everything
that is beautiful within you, that is good within

00:32:41.564 --> 00:32:42.674
you.

00:32:42.874 --> 00:32:46.884
For example, it started a fashion.

00:32:47.084 --> 00:32:49.684
With this materialism they start fashions.

00:32:49.884 --> 00:32:54.194
Ladies are more vulnerable.

00:32:54.394 --> 00:33:02.074
Fashion starts, any sort of fashion starts,
like the sleeves to be made long – in India

00:33:02.274 --> 00:33:09.704
also they started – then make it short,
then make it half, then make it no sleeves.

00:33:09.825 --> 00:33:11.789
I said, “I am not running that race.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:16.643
I will have the sleeves all the time,
same sleeves so I don’t have to bother.

00:33:16.843 --> 00:33:22.444
I can tell My tailor and he can make whatever
way I want to have, the tailor, because he

00:33:22.644 --> 00:33:27.694
knows I make one style” – finished with it.

00:33:27.894 --> 00:33:30.994
Why do people want to run with the fashion?

00:33:31.194 --> 00:33:37.754
Just think of it, what is the need to run with the fashion?

00:33:37.954 --> 00:33:40.504
Now new race has started, run with it.

00:33:40.704 --> 00:33:43.344
Then another race has started, run with it.

00:33:43.544 --> 00:33:48.304
Then the third race has started, run with
it – all the time running with the mad race

00:33:48.504 --> 00:33:53.173
of fashions.

00:33:53.373 --> 00:34:00.224
Now a new race has started of fashions
not to put any oil in the head, so you become

00:34:00.424 --> 00:34:02.624
bald, then you buy wigs.

00:34:02.824 --> 00:34:08.814
It’s all entrepreneurs who are working out, it’s all enterprises.

00:34:09.014 --> 00:34:20.824
So you become absolutely bald-headed people,
then you get your wigs from them, then there

00:34:21.024 --> 00:34:25.364
is a special charge for dressing the
wigs, so you go for dressing the wigs.

00:34:25.564 --> 00:34:28.734
Goes on like mad.

00:34:28.934 --> 00:34:40.774
Then there’s another type: now a new fashion
has started in London because, you see, these

00:34:40.974 --> 00:34:42.794
people want to make some money.

00:34:42.994 --> 00:34:48.344
People don’t even have so much of logic
and intelligence left in their heads to see

00:34:48.544 --> 00:34:53.044
that what they were preaching one
day, they are just the thing against it.

00:34:53.244 --> 00:34:59.544
Formerly it was you had to wear a tail coat,
you had to have your hair absolutely done

00:34:59.744 --> 00:35:06.334
with proper hair-grooming and all
that, as you can see in the old pictures.

00:35:06.534 --> 00:35:11.544
Then it started striped three-piece suits.

00:35:11.744 --> 00:35:21.954
Now it is, I mean, few days earlier was tight
clothes, then they developed varicose veins, you see.

00:35:22.154 --> 00:35:27.634
So no, no – now it is the fashion to wear absolutely loose dresses.

00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:33.454
I saw the other day one lady making a
dress out of a big blanket, going like this.

00:35:33.654 --> 00:35:41.934
I thought she was some priest or someone!

00:35:42.134 --> 00:35:45.154
So that stupidity has started.

00:35:45.354 --> 00:35:55.254
Imagine – think of Sahasrara, think of Divine,
in what world we are, and in what world the

00:35:55.454 --> 00:35:59.214
stupid people are going.

00:35:59.414 --> 00:36:07.394
That’s another world, absolutely another
stupid world where people just go after nonsensical

00:36:07.594 --> 00:36:13.954
things, changing from one to another, changing
from everything: ties are changed, everything

00:36:14.154 --> 00:36:16.004
is changed, giving you such a headache.

00:36:16.125 --> 00:36:18.963
All the time you have to think, “Now what fashion is there?

00:36:19.084 --> 00:36:21.114
Let’s find out in the newspaper.

00:36:21.235 --> 00:36:25.554
What is – this is the fashion now. All right, wear this dress.”

00:36:25.754 --> 00:36:30.824
All this is befooling going on,
because this ghost has entered into us.

00:36:31.024 --> 00:36:41.614
In Sahaja Yoga also when we enter, be careful,
materialism should not enter into your minds.

00:36:41.814 --> 00:36:47.534
It’s nothing important.

00:36:47.734 --> 00:36:53.424
Even when somebody dies you are supposed
to wear something black, or white or I don’t

00:36:53.624 --> 00:36:55.854
know what else, but white or black.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:02.288
And somebody died in England who was a great friend of My husband,

00:37:02.408 --> 00:37:06.674
and I had no black sari, completely
black. I mean we don’t have such a sari.

00:37:06.874 --> 00:37:08.124
I didn’t know what to do.

00:37:08.324 --> 00:37:12.744
I told My husband I don’t have a black
sari. He said, “Then You don’t come.”

00:37:12.944 --> 00:37:18.484
Imagine how his wife would feel if I
don’t go to the thing, how she would take it.

00:37:18.684 --> 00:37:25.764
All this is nothing, what is important is the black sari!

00:37:25.964 --> 00:37:33.544
In every walk of life you are being befooled by this materialism.

00:37:33.744 --> 00:37:39.404
I don’t know how you got stuck into it first of all.

00:37:39.604 --> 00:37:42.274
And the other side is, the same people are befooling you.

00:37:42.474 --> 00:37:48.384
“All right, this is not good, this is
too much” – so go to the anti-culture.

00:37:48.584 --> 00:37:54.224
What is anti-culture is another kind of
materialism, another kind of nonsense.

00:37:54.424 --> 00:38:01.024
Nowadays they are having in this London an
anti-culture movement which is called as “punks.”

00:38:01.224 --> 00:38:07.654
I think out of date now Me, but still
what’s for the time being as I see is punks.

00:38:07.854 --> 00:38:11.164
It costs them forty pounds sometimes to make that hair.

00:38:11.364 --> 00:38:19.974
I mean, is it something that you are saving money on that?

00:38:20.174 --> 00:38:27.234
So the whole thing works out just to take
out your attention from reality, from higher

00:38:27.434 --> 00:38:35.744
values, to something nonsensical.

00:38:35.944 --> 00:38:45.967
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead a life of collectivity.

00:38:46.168 --> 00:38:51.754
It’s very important that we have to be collective.

00:38:51.954 --> 00:38:57.904
We shouldn’t talk of “This is mine, this is mine, and this I own.”

00:38:58.105 --> 00:39:01.046
Even about children you should not do like that,

00:39:01.246 --> 00:39:12.764
“This is my own child, this is my own
baby. This is my brother, this is my sister.”

00:39:12.964 --> 00:39:16.641
This “my, my” should go away; but that’s not possible,

00:39:16.841 --> 00:39:23.864
it’s not easy to forget about it because
left Nabhi and right Nabhi has to be all right.

00:39:24.064 --> 00:39:31.139
The only way to do it is that “Mother, it’s all Yours.”

00:39:31.339 --> 00:39:40.313
It’s not dangerous to say that, because I’ll
never take anything that is supposed to be yours.

00:39:40.514 --> 00:39:45.689
Just to say, “Mother, it’s all Yours,” to start it – “It’s all Yours.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:53.054
I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all
my things are Yours, my life is Yours.”

00:39:53.254 --> 00:39:58.184
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrara.

00:39:58.384 --> 00:40:04.042
The deity of Sahasrara is a very simple person,

00:40:04.242 --> 00:40:08.967
extremely simple, and can be moved with very little actions,

00:40:09.167 --> 00:40:12.973
can be pleased with very few little actions here and there.

00:40:13.174 --> 00:40:17.531
Not much is needed to please the deity of Sahasrara.

00:40:17.732 --> 00:40:26.804
It’s a very simple person; little things make Her happy.

00:40:27.618 --> 00:40:32.483
Yesterday you had brought the flowers, and I didn’t take them.

00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:34.058
You all must have thought,

00:40:34.258 --> 00:40:37.917
“What’s it, we couldn’t give flowers to Mother, holding in our hand.”

00:40:38.118 --> 00:40:42.905
But I wanted to show this miracle to you, that’s why I didn’t take.

00:40:43.106 --> 00:40:48.430
And I took it in the end, and see now
they are the best among all of them;

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:53.418
don’t they look as if they have been plucked from the tree?

00:40:54.554 --> 00:40:59.655
Just I wanted to show this, so I said, “I’m tired,” I sat down

00:40:59.855 --> 00:41:06.867
and then I looked at you with the flowers,
you see, in the hands, you’re sitting all of you!

00:41:15.966 --> 00:41:18.444
So She is Leela Vinodini.

00:41:18.644 --> 00:41:26.782
She plays around, makes little mischiefs
here and there for you to learn lessons.

00:41:26.976 --> 00:41:33.586
Because if I tell you “Do this” then
it’s not possible, but little circuitous way

00:41:33.787 --> 00:41:38.198
I can show you that this is wrong, you should not do it.

00:41:38.399 --> 00:41:42.069
There’s nothing to feel bad, I would have taken all the flowers;

00:41:42.269 --> 00:41:47.009
but somebody must have thought of it,
why Mother has not taken the flowers today.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:51.549
I don’t know if you thought of it or not,

00:41:51.749 --> 00:41:58.331
but I knew it Myself that I have to take
the flowers to show this miracle to them,

00:41:58.531 --> 00:42:02.875
that these flowers are going to last
much longer than any other flowers,

00:42:03.075 --> 00:42:07.846
because they are vibrated with the Brahmachaitanya.

00:42:08.046 --> 00:42:13.663
And the water was very, very, very
cold, so even I opened a hot water tap.

00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:21.736
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, they didn’t
die, despite that they are perfectly all right.

00:42:21.936 --> 00:42:25.852
So you have seen so many miracles of this Brahmachaitanya

00:42:26.052 --> 00:42:31.599
which is showing on your photographs, on so many your lives,

00:42:31.799 --> 00:42:36.153
in so many changes that have taken place within yourself,

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:40.396
within your family, within every one of you.

00:42:40.596 --> 00:42:45.305
All this has happened because you are in Brahmachaitanya.

00:42:45.506 --> 00:42:51.036
All this you are receiving because you are blessed by Brahmachaitanya.

00:42:51.491 --> 00:42:55.613
But others are not, so your attitude should be towards them

00:42:55.814 --> 00:42:59.983
that they are in the other world – what to do, how to help them?

00:43:00.184 --> 00:43:05.746
We should try to help them if possible, but up to a point.

00:43:06.196 --> 00:43:09.369
We should not drag down ourselves for others’ sake.

00:43:09.569 --> 00:43:11.990
Up to a point only we can help them,

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:17.896
and we have to be very happy that Sahaja
Yoga is spreading so much horizontally.

00:43:18.296 --> 00:43:22.736
But for vertical thing we must know our quality must improve.

00:43:22.937 --> 00:43:28.110
If some people rise higher, others will also start rising with them.

00:43:28.311 --> 00:43:33.586
It’s the absolute honesty of purpose should be there,

00:43:33.786 --> 00:43:37.116
absolutely understanding should be there.

00:43:37.316 --> 00:43:41.471
Open your hearts to each other, so that you open your hearts to Me.

00:43:41.672 --> 00:43:46.878
Every cell must know another cell, otherwise it won’t work out.

00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:52.789
That is a great thing that has happened, when you are on this Earth,

00:43:52.989 --> 00:43:59.171
when you are the ones who have to receive this great blessing.

00:43:59.372 --> 00:44:03.165
So many saints did not receive it,

00:44:03.365 --> 00:44:07.293
so many great people who came on this Earth, they did not receive it.

00:44:07.494 --> 00:44:13.473
Even the incarnations who came on this
Earth could not do it what you are doing.

00:44:13.674 --> 00:44:17.955
So have that satisfaction and glory

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:22.564
of your own being and of your own standard, and of your own caliber.

00:44:22.765 --> 00:44:27.726
The others are not of your caliber, all right, forget about it.

00:44:28.204 --> 00:44:36.113
That should not give you ego, but should
give you a personality that does not react.

00:44:36.314 --> 00:44:42.146
We have something of our own, we do not react to things.

00:44:44.023 --> 00:44:47.347
We are not reactionaries.

00:44:47.548 --> 00:44:51.986
And things will disappear which are harmful.

00:44:52.186 --> 00:44:55.357
Everything will be perfectly all right,

00:44:55.557 --> 00:45:00.528
because we are standing in our own perfection, in our own glory.

00:45:00.728 --> 00:45:02.161
What do we need?

00:45:02.361 --> 00:45:05.439
Nothing, just enjoying ourselves.

00:45:08.659 --> 00:45:11.252
May God bless you all.
