1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,561
The other day I was telling you

2
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:08,535
about our growth within, after Self-realisation.

3
00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:16,216
The germination takes place very easily;

4
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:21,871
the Kundalini rises very easily;

5
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:32,054
also pierces the fontanelle bone area very easily.

6
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:36,394
That is really, as you call it, ‘Sahaja’.

7
00:00:38,092 --> 00:00:40,526
It’s a tremendous happening.

8
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:45,682
It takes thousands of years for people to get realisation.

9
00:00:45,802 --> 00:00:47,956
That’s also a fact.

10
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:52,014
They had to be born again and again

11
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:57,924
and very few selected got realisation.

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:03,478
But today, as I said, the time has come

13
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:11,008
for many flowers to become fruits.

14
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:17,467
So this happening doesn’t take much time,

15
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,482
it’s just [a] split of a second in many people.

16
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:26,446
But about the growth I was talking last time,

17
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:32,022
I ended up at Self-realisation, what is Self-realisation is

18
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:37,327
and what do we expect from Self-realisation.

19
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:41,864
The first thing that happens to you, as you know,

20
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:44,607
when the Kundalini rises, [is]

21
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:52,574
that you start feeling physically better; your health improves.

22
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:59,350
Though the Kundalini rises from the centre most nadi,

23
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,093
called as Brahmanadi, inside the Sushumna, in the central part.

24
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:14,596
And first thing that happens is the physical being which is helped.

25
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:21,634
That is not the innermost core of every centre.

26
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:28,175
The innermost core of every centre is the Spiritual.

27
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:34,080
But how is it [that] first the physical being is helped?

28
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,480
Is very interesting to see.

29
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:47,033
The Kundalini rises through many centres, passes through Agya,

30
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:49,102
pierces through fontanelle,

31
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:53,749
and becomes one with the All-pervading Power.

32
00:02:56,737 --> 00:03:02,813
So, first thing that receives the information is the seat of Sadashiva,

33
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:08,343
is the seat of your Atma, your Spirit, on top of your head.

34
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:11,164
But the Spirit is in your heart.

35
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:15,596
So the first awakening takes place, or enlightenment takes place,

36
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:19,600
in your brain. It’s a very important point to be seen.

37
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,904
In your brain resides the conscious mind,

38
00:03:28,554 --> 00:03:30,931
that means the present,

39
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:40,258
and when it is enlightened that means your awareness is enlightened;

40
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:43,847
you get enlightenment in your awareness,

41
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:48,465
in your attention.

42
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:52,976
As I told you last time that attention is enlightened first.

43
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:55,458
So through your attention you can find out

44
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:58,422
what is the matter with other persons, you can find out

45
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,193
what centres are catching,

46
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:05,150
what your centres are catching. So, on the physical level,

47
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:12,422
you know what’s happening.

48
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:18,523
That’s the, we should say, the present.

49
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,520
We feel our gross (physical) being enlightened,

50
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,690
we can feel them on our fingers.

51
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:37,121
But when the Kundalini is rising in your being,

52
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:44,526
She goes straight on to the fontanelle bone area.

53
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:49,006
Of course, if there is a hurdle or anything then She stops

54
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:51,605
and tries to indicate.

55
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:58,043
At that time, if She is not successful,

56
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:01,360
for example you have got a liver problem,

57
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,530
then She will come and throb at liver problem,

58
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,548
informing you that there’s something wrong with the liver.

59
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:12,825
That’s why a Sahaja Yogi has to give vibrations from outside.

60
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:22,258
When the Kundalini rises above the Agya,

61
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:28,581
She goes up to this fontanelle and pierces.

62
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:33,832
But when She cannot go beyond Agya She spreads out here.

63
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:38,669
She can spread out here also.

64
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,526
And then She starts trickling down,

65
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,150
the grace on the…

66
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:54,157
or you can say She starts relaxing

67
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:58,709
this area which is called as murdha (brain)

68
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:05,072
and that’s how She makes more space in the Agya.

69
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,924
And this relaxation works out the outer side of the physical being.

70
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,461
Also when She pierces through

71
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:23,378
in anyone who has a simpler personality,

72
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:28,266
who is not so complicated, first thing that happens

73
00:06:28,386 --> 00:06:32,375
is that the grace starts falling through from the sides;

74
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:39,470
and the Grace starts falling into the Ida and Pingala

75
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:47,421
and then She comes down by which She supplies Ida and Pingala.

76
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,305
The Grace, not the Kundalini,

77
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:53,828
you should not confuse these two things.

78
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:57,581
Because of Her piercing, there’s an opening made

79
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:02,963
and the Grace starts coming down, and She,

80
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:11,520
I should say the Grace Itself, feeds all the centres from outside.

81
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:16,883
So, first the physical being is improves.

82
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:29,801
The second one, I’m now going from outside inside,

83
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:40,448
the second one is the mental being.

84
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:47,649
Now the mental being relates to our awareness as well,

85
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:53,937
also to our sense of understanding, intellect and all those things.

86
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:59,681
When the Grace starts flowing more and more within us,

87
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:04,051
then our mental being gets enlightened.

88
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,541
When the mental being gets enlightened

89
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:12,474
then you start feeling centres of other persons.

90
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:18,432
Some people you know just get cured.

91
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:22,890
They don’t feel any vibrations, nothing, just they feel cured.

92
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,935
They get cured of cancer, this, that, all sorts of things.

93
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:30,605
But they do not get vibrations, they do not get a feeling,

94
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:34,782
they cannot make out whether it is this chakra or that chakra,

95
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:37,192
they do not feel anything.

96
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:43,977
So the first thing that would happen to anyone is the physical gift,

97
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:48,949
the physical being improves – that’s the Grace of God.

98
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,047
Because if you are not well,

99
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:56,344
if you have some pains and some troubles and some diseases,

100
00:08:56,464 --> 00:09:00,628
how are you going to pay attention to God and Spirit?

101
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:03,973
That’s very important.

102
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:09,710
But before it comes to the mental self,

103
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:16,194
something else happens also,

104
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:21,715
that, when the Kundalini pierces,

105
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:29,657
the falling of Grace first comes down

106
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:36,722
to the lower centres starting from Nabhi downwards.

107
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:44,522
And Nabhi is a great sucker, Nabhi starts sucking the vibrations,

108
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:47,241
or you can say the Grace.

109
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:53,924
And Nabhi starts getting awakened first of all.

110
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:59,738
From Nabhi rises the Swadhishthana Chakra which goes round and round,

111
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:05,895
which is connected with Nabhi, so it flows to Swadhishthana

112
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:12,847
and then Swadhishthana also starts working out itself.

113
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,515
Swadhishthana sucks in as much as possible

114
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:23,270
and works out all the centres,

115
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,485
I mean all the organs, which are supplied by it.

116
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:38,974
But Nabhi, when it receives surplus Grace,

117
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:43,565
then it starts opening,

118
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:56,070
and its opening helps us in very gross material life also.

119
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:01,524
You are helped materially.

120
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:05,574
Supposing if you are materially absolutely hopeless,

121
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:09,609
then you are not going to pay attention to God also.

122
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:12,287
So it’s the responsibility of God

123
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:15,639
to first give you a little material well-being.

124
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,492
Like I received a letter and also on the tape

125
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:24,282
they have mentioned about somebody who wanted to come to India, from Australia.

126
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:28,529
She got her realisation, she felt very much better,

127
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:34,784
and she wanted to come to India but she had no money to come,

128
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:40,459
and that desire was there. Because of that desire in her

129
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:46,980
she may not have put full attention to her Spirit.

130
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:53,116
And that’s how our material desires get satisfied.

131
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,960
And her daughter discovered, she had a bracelet,

132
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,243
many bracelets and things she had, and she went to a jumble sale,

133
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:08,336
for selling them for some sort of a programme they had for children.

134
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,311
And they discovered that one of the bracelets that she had,

135
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:17,686
which she thought to be a junk, was of gold, surprisingly.

136
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:21,773
And she sold it for $1500.

137
00:12:21,893 --> 00:12:26,124
 She was going to sell it for 20c, you see,.

138
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:32,402
And that was exactly the amount needed for their travel, for both of them.

139
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:37,429
Now one would say that – how it works out?

140
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:45,114
It is miraculous, that’s all I can say, because the machinery is such.

141
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:57,014
The pouring of the Grace within you, informs the Lakshmi Principle in the Nabhi.

142
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:58,889
Nabhi just show them where is this.

143
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,161
Somebody has to get up and show them,

144
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:05,033
Douglas? Or someone. Douglas (Fry) come along.

145
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,534
This is the one. And this has the deity of Lakshmi,

146
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:16,736
She is the deity of your well-being.

147
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:21,257
And this is what Krishna has said, “Yoga Kshema vahamyam”

148
00:13:21,377 --> 00:13:22,712
“When the yoga takes place,

149
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:26,413
means when the Kundalini pierces through fontanelle bone area,

150
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:32,198
I look after your well-being.” How does he look after? Through Lakshmi.

151
00:13:32,682 --> 00:13:39,505
Now this is a universal Deity. She’s present in human beings

152
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:44,258
and also she is present in material things.

153
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:51,848
It is such a fantastic thing

154
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,827
that you cannot explain these things

155
00:13:56,947 --> 00:13:59,552
on human level, really it is difficult.

156
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,317
Only thing you can see for yourself how it works out.

157
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:07,211
It’s so tremendous. Like if you have to explain

158
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:10,976
about human civilisation to an ant it’s going to be difficult –

159
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:14,352
in the same way it is. It’s so difficult you see.

160
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:17,336
And human beings they are so proud of their rationality

161
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:21,023
and I find it impossible how to explain, but it does work that way.

162
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:23,931
You can only see the working of it.

163
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:27,902
But if you are proud of your rationality you go ahead with it,

164
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:32,962
what can you do? But you just see for yourself how it works.

165
00:14:34,427 --> 00:14:40,448
So the second layer that really is improved is your material being.

166
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:45,683
So many people have been helped, who are here, materially.

167
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:54,723
The well-being has come, actual well-being, apart from satisfaction.

168
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:57,544
But as I said, it does not cross the limit,

169
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:00,263
like you do not become Mr. Ford!

170
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:06,684
Because that’s some sort of a behaviour which is asahaja,

171
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:10,688
to be so rich, I mean it’s ridiculous, vulgar!

172
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:19,665
You become better than what you are, but not the best,

173
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:26,917
because you have to be in the centre at a satisfied point.

174
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:30,368
And everybody has to enjoy you

175
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:35,626
and you have to enjoy everybody.

176
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:40,856
But supposing if you are in dire necessities and problematic things

177
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:44,861
then you cannot pay attention to God and that’s what He understands –

178
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:46,138
that you cannot.

179
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:49,658
If you have physical problem, if you have cancer,

180
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:52,384
how can you say that, “You pay attention to your Spirit,”

181
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:54,441
when you have cancer? I mean, such a body!

182
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:57,452
After all if this whole house is going to collapse

183
00:15:57,572 --> 00:15:59,755
you cannot meditate here.

184
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:06,484
So, first the physical stability is established and second is the material one.

185
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:12,724
And there are many factors which work out material stability, automatically.

186
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:18,880
First of them is that, once you find your Spirit,

187
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,126
you just automatically give up your habits.

188
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:30,060
Most of these habits come from your Nabhi,

189
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,763
because from Nabhi Chakra you get your seeking.

190
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:38,259
And you think, when you have a habit [that] you are seeking your joy.

191
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:42,938
I mean, many people have said, “Mother, but I enjoy my glass of whiskey,”

192
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:45,164
they have said to me, many a times.

193
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:49,350
Or, “I enjoy a little ride here and there,”

194
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,279
somebody has said that, “Mother, I enjoy some Kensington ladies,”

195
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,343
you see, sort of thing.

196
00:16:55,772 --> 00:17:00,007
But once you start enjoying your Spirit, it drops out.

197
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:08,141
All your attention becomes enlightened and your priorities change.

198
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,955
You don’t enjoy these things that you have been enjoying before,

199
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:13,483
so you just don’t do it. I mean, I don’t have to tell you,

200
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:15,942
“Don’t drink!” you just don’t do it.

201
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:19,212
I don’t have to tell you that you don’t smoke, you just don’t do.

202
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,230
But there are some very weak people, extremely weak, I mean,

203
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,898
very, very weak people. They take time, I know.

204
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:32,972
They plod and they are very slow moving creatures, but not all.

205
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:44,090
I would say quite a small number and

206
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:51,005
most of the people, they just give up things. You just give up.

207
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:55,191
So you start saving money, automatically,

208
00:17:56,326 --> 00:18:00,989
because the money goes to the races or to the pubs

209
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:04,370
or to other habits which are useless, you know they are useless:

210
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,102
smoking, drugs,

211
00:18:07,222 --> 00:18:12,256
any such foolish things that you are wasting money on.

212
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:19,477
And you start channelizing this money for something better,

213
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:21,947
something that gives you more joy,

214
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:25,800
more happiness and of an eternal nature, not a temporary one,

215
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,547
that you take the drink [the] previous night

216
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,785
and in the morning you are finished!

217
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:37,052
You get a drink that never finishes, which you enjoy all the time.

218
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:42,138
You get drunk like that. Because in my own life I have seen,

219
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:50,556
it’s such a so-called sophisticated elite life.

220
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:54,476
People drink much more, you see, than normal people drink.

221
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:57,886
And they ask me, “Why don’t you drink?” I say, “I am already drunk!

222
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:00,269
The day I was born I was so drunk that, now,

223
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,049
if I have to drink more I’ll fall off, so better not ask me!”

224
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:06,751
They are quite frightened at my, this thing,

225
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:09,906
I said, “I am really fully drunk already!”

226
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,122
So they start looking at me!

227
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:19,707
And they never find me anyway less in spirits as they are.

228
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,689
Actually I’m always little more than they are,

229
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:25,280
so they never force me to do that.

230
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,243
But these things drop out automatically.

231
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:32,389
I don’t have to tell you that you have to drop out.

232
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,376
Because most of the things you have done

233
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:36,486
because you have been seeking something.

234
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:39,895
You know, there are people, I asked them, “Why do you do this?”

235
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:42,530
They said, “We are seeking love,” I said “How?

236
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,603
How can you find love like this?” Or somebody will say that,

237
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:48,503
“I am seeking God.” There are many people who are taking drugs,

238
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:51,283
I mean, genuinely, just for seeking.

239
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:54,239
But when they have found it, what they were seeking,

240
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,752
they don’t take drugs. But this is one of the side issues,

241
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:01,690
I was just trying to make it little lighter.

242
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:07,252
But mainly what happens is that, actually the principle of Lakshmi,

243
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:12,065
the principle of well-being within you is awakened.

244
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:19,234
And if you listen to one of my tapes where I have described

245
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:23,744
what a Lakshmi is, and how She is symbolised:

246
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:27,529
it’s a very beautiful picture of Lakshmi

247
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:32,786
that the great seers have put before us:

248
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:38,664
That, She is after all a Mother, She is a mother.

249
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:46,196
A person who is a rich man has to be a motherly person.

250
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:50,450
But here you find, in the whole world I have seen [that]

251
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,182
those who have even little money their nose goes up like that

252
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:58,837
and if you see them from down below they look like wolves

253
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,198
not like mothers – most surprising.

254
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:10,691
And this Lakshmi who is a Mother, wears a white sari,

255
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:16,237
very elegant, with a gold border.

256
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:23,420
That represents that he doesn’t put people into awe

257
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,868
by his pomp and show and this and that.

258
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:31,945
She’s standing on a lotus.

259
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:36,028
Imagine any human being standing on a lotus!

260
00:21:38,124 --> 00:21:48,596
That means that She’s so light in Her behaviour towards others.

261
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:55,157
She’s so delicate, She touches people with such delicacy,

262
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:58,755
that people don’t feel hurt,

263
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:07,433
they are not in any way pressurized by the riches of people.

264
00:22:07,822 --> 00:22:09,571
But you know it’s just the opposite,

265
00:22:09,691 --> 00:22:12,851
if your so-called ‘rich’ you see! Horrible!

266
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:17,996
If somebody’s coming in here I would like to get out of that door.

267
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:21,324
They try to pressurise because they have money.

268
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:25,978
You see, if somebody starts talking big, you just find out,

269
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:30,790
99% he must have won some horse race!

270
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:37,801
This pressurising is a sign that he is not a lakshmipati,

271
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:43,058
he has nothing to do with Lakshmi. So he’s so gracious.

272
00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:51,807
I have seen such people. I have seen some people like that.

273
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:57,403
I have seen one in England you will be surprised to know.

274
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:02,683
I have just seen him once. He was a gentleman

275
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:05,392
who was some lord and something

276
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:10,319
and later on he came to India and he was a Viceroy (Lord Mountbatten).

277
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:16,351
And there was a gentleman who was very well known to us,

278
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:21,681
he once met him in a train which was delayed or something happened

279
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,898
and they had to get down at another station

280
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:27,036
and somehow or other they were put together.

281
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:31,324
And he was so simple and so good and so helpful

282
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:37,475
that this gentleman was taken by him.

283
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:39,872
He said, “Now better you come to my house because

284
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:42,531
it’s not going to be any train, you come to my house.”

285
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:44,714
When he went to his house he was surprised

286
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:49,513
the house was like a palace! And then he told he who he was,

287
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:55,162
and he was amazed! And he even carried his bag with him.

288
00:23:55,282 --> 00:23:59,834
Such a simple man. And then, when this person told me

289
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:02,988
that such a person is there, then he re-visited India,

290
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,706
then he brought him to see me.

291
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:07,517
But he’s no more now he’s dead this gentleman.

292
00:24:07,637 --> 00:24:11,572
But he was a very big man in India and a very big person

293
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:15,941
but such a simple man! Such a simple person.

294
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:21,854
So that’s the significance of well-being.

295
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:26,629
So when a Sahaja Yogi becomes well-being, gets well-being

296
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:32,603
then he has all these qualities in him that,

297
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:37,950
he doesn’t impress on others that he has a property

298
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,873
or he has got money and he should pressurise others.

299
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:47,414
If he’s really a good Sahaja Yogi he would be the humblest of all

300
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:51,751
and he would be very generous because in Her hand,

301
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:53,953
one hand is like this.

302
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:57,626
The left hand is like this, means She’s generous, She’s giving.

303
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,530
All the time She’s giving. She’s not taking anything,

304
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:05,517
She’s giving. And that’s how such a person is all the time giving.

305
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:11,127
I have seen people who, after Sahaja Yoga,

306
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:17,247
receive a lot of blessings and are miserly or try to oppress others,

307
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:19,980
lose their properties and lose their money

308
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,635
and really suffer a little bit.

309
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:26,464
Because otherwise there’s no way of teaching them.

310
00:25:27,955 --> 00:25:31,419
So the generosity flows from Her hand

311
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:33,937
and another hand is like this,

312
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:41,241
which means that She gives protection to people.

313
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:48,198
There have to be some people who are ashritas, are dependents,

314
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:52,641
who just depend, from whom such a person doesn’t take any money,

315
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:58,549
they just live. These systems are still in India.

316
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:03,906
Those people who are well off always have about two, three people

317
00:26:04,026 --> 00:26:08,672
being supported by them. Is a system still working in India,

318
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:12,630
in many places. I mean, in my father’s house we always remember

319
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,362
we had people like that.

320
00:26:14,482 --> 00:26:18,072
They were educated and given higher education by my father free,

321
00:26:18,192 --> 00:26:22,543
just free. But never did they feel that they were anybody else,

322
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:27,120
treated with same respect and with same dignity as we were treated.

323
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,204
But that was a part of life, one had to do it.

324
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:33,174
This is the ashraya,

325
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:36,298
is that there should be some people depending on you.

326
00:26:36,418 --> 00:26:39,841
England also I’ve seen people have cats, dogs, things like that, you see,

327
00:26:39,961 --> 00:26:43,740
little bit they do spend on cats and dogs.

328
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:47,328
But better to spend on human beings.

329
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:49,448
What am I going to do with cats and dogs?

330
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:51,794
Can I give them realization? (laughter)

331
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,162
It’s better to look after human beings

332
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,932
than to look after cats and dogs so much!

333
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:02,930
But I have seen that when they are dealing with cats and dogs

334
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:04,273
they are very happy people,

335
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:07,454
but with human beings they are very unhappy, I don’t know why.

336
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:09,929
If you must have seen in the BBC and all that,

337
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:13,384
when they have these advertisements I have seen in television sometimes,

338
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:18,007
you see a person having a cat, she’ll always smile and joke and this.

339
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:22,332
And anybody having children, she looks so miserable! (laughter)

340
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:31,876
That should not be so. There should be somebody dependent.

341
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:36,957
It’s not important to measure every money, to ask for 2p (£0.02)

342
00:27:37,077 --> 00:27:40,988
– “I gave you yesterday, will you return 2p to me?”

343
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:45,058
It doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to be like that.

344
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:50,393
If it comes to that, alright, give some money – forget about it.

345
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:53,952
It helps you such a lot, it helps you such a lot.

346
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:59,371
To be meticulously so observant about how much money you lent

347
00:27:59,576 --> 00:28:03,557
it’s better to be more worried about how much you have taken

348
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:07,672
than to be how much you have given. It helps a lot.

349
00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:13,116
It’s a thing one has to realize in life, how much it helps.

350
00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:19,456
I have seen in my own life it has helped so many times.

351
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:24,555
I mean you really have people then, around you.

352
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:28,049
It’s a matter of 5 Rupees and 10 Rupees.

353
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:32,129
It’s so important then to some people at a [certain] point,

354
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:34,998
and it works wonders!

355
00:28:36,243 --> 00:28:43,517
I mean, you can have a human worth millions by paying sometimes 5 Rupees,

356
00:28:43,637 --> 00:28:47,215
it can work out that way. So try to be more giving

357
00:28:47,335 --> 00:28:49,750
and then you receive more as a Sahaja Yogi.

358
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,912
Remember that now you are connected with Lakshmi.

359
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:59,536
The more generous you are the more you get it.

360
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:04,325
When you are small-minded you do no receive Her blessings.

361
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:07,450
You have to give, you have to give.

362
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:12,412
Once you give, it starts flowing, the stagnation is over

363
00:29:12,532 --> 00:29:14,465
and the flow starts coming in.

364
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:17,484
Otherwise you are stagnated when your hand is, you see,

365
00:29:17,604 --> 00:29:20,145
tight fisted as you call it.

366
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,039
English language has so many good words,

367
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:27,581
though they are now losing their meaning!

368
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:32,643
They call it you are very, I don’t know there must be some new words

369
00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:35,495
for being very, very miserly, some good word, you know,

370
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:39,308
which doesn’t mean miserly but must be some ‘economical’

371
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:45,503
or something fantastic. But actually miserliness, is miserliness,

372
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:48,619
give it whatever name you like, it’s horrible.

373
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:51,606
And one should not take to miserliness,

374
00:29:51,726 --> 00:29:55,246
that is a curse I tell you, it’s a disease,

375
00:29:55,366 --> 00:30:03,365
it’s like leprosy, to be hated. Try to be generous.

376
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:12,644
Now the generosity of maybe, I don’t know, but maybe of money,

377
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:15,441
is not difficult for some people.

378
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:20,850
But generosity of saying something good to others is rare.

379
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,680
You see somebody in a good dress,

380
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,644
you should be generous enough to say,

381
00:30:27,764 --> 00:30:32,258
“Oh, it’s fantastic, it’s beautiful.” What’s wrong?

382
00:30:32,378 --> 00:30:38,339
But jealousy, that goes against Lakshmi completely.

383
00:30:38,926 --> 00:30:40,995
It’s better that others are wearing it;

384
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:44,699
you don’t pay for it and you enjoy it! (laughter)

385
00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:49,098
It’s very logical you just see.

386
00:30:49,318 --> 00:30:53,896
You see, if you own this hall, it will be a headache for you isn’t it,

387
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:57,400
to keep it alright. I mean imagine the people who own it,

388
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,371
and to put it right because everybody will come and criticise,

389
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,216
“This is not good, that’s not good.”

390
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:06,949
But it’s nice to be here, when it doesn’t belong to you, to enjoy it.

391
00:31:07,902 --> 00:31:12,734
It’s very simple. Just try to enjoy it, to be generous with people,

392
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:18,293
be kind to them. This generosity is lacking.

393
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:24,696
When this starts, then the inner core of emotional being starts

394
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,771
getting enlightened.

395
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,823
Go to the subtler side of material well-being

396
00:31:31,943 --> 00:31:35,712
and you start getting into emotional thing.

397
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:41,130
Small, small things work out, very small.

398
00:31:42,386 --> 00:31:44,305
It’s very sweet.

399
00:31:45,797 --> 00:31:51,317
We have so many examples of this kind of little sweetness

400
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:54,301
being expressed.

401
00:31:56,078 --> 00:32:01,468
And this generosity should come to all the Sahaja Yogis,

402
00:32:02,778 --> 00:32:04,336
of saying good things to others.

403
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:08,634
Doesn’t matter [that] it is exaggeration, doesn’t matter,

404
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,605
because it acts as a buffer.

405
00:32:15,405 --> 00:32:17,951
Then the fright of the strangers,

406
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:22,212
fright of the neighbours, fright of other human beings, you know.

407
00:32:22,332 --> 00:32:24,741
Every human being has become now [that] he sees

408
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:27,929
another human being coming, he recoils back. Imagine!

409
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:31,406
First, I mean, say about fifty years back it was like dogs;

410
00:32:31,526 --> 00:32:35,146
if any human being saw another human being they used to bark!

411
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:41,446
Now it is another way round. So, the fear of your brother,

412
00:32:41,566 --> 00:32:47,436
of your own kin and kith, of your part and parcel.

413
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:51,836
They are your own, you don’t know, they are part and parcel of your being,

414
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:54,532
you can feel it, after Sahaja Yoga you can feel it,

415
00:32:54,652 --> 00:32:56,509
I don’t have to tell you.

416
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:01,641
You can feel them within yourself, they are within you.

417
00:33:02,077 --> 00:33:08,267
And then the sweetness of saying something sweet,

418
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:16,195
of saying something sweet, is so nice,

419
00:33:16,315 --> 00:33:22,124
is so rewarding, itself, itself, so rewarding.

420
00:33:22,338 --> 00:33:26,662
The movement of Shakti is always this way.

421
00:33:26,932 --> 00:33:30,283
If I give you love, love comes back to me.

422
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:33,691
If I give you hatred, hatred comes back to me.

423
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:38,863
And double fold everything. If I give you love,

424
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:42,010
say 1 unit, I may get 7 units of love.

425
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,833
But if I give you hatred of 1, that too,

426
00:33:45,953 --> 00:33:48,666
7 units of hatred comes to you.

427
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:51,655
The mathematics is complete.

428
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:57,155
So try to understand that, emotionally,

429
00:33:57,781 --> 00:34:01,554
you have to understand your material well-being.

430
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:06,480
How to express emotionally your material well-being

431
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,706
is a very sweet thing.

432
00:34:10,388 --> 00:34:12,567
I would give you an example of Gavin

433
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:16,682
because I can’t forget that very sweet incident:

434
00:34:17,285 --> 00:34:21,749
One day we had called some people, you see,

435
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:24,596
I didn’t know there would be so many coming, in his house.

436
00:34:24,716 --> 00:34:28,641
And he has a house but, I mean, not so big like this.

437
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:31,818
So there were about fifty people, around. And I told him,

438
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:35,867
“Prepare some food for them.” But I thought for fifty people

439
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:38,754
he could not have prepared, at the most for ten people!

440
00:34:38,874 --> 00:34:42,397
So I was quite embarrassed  and I was waiting for people to go away,

441
00:34:42,518 --> 00:34:45,610
I didn’t say, “Stay on for dinner,” or anything, I thought,

442
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:48,947
“Poor Gavin, how could he have cooked for fifty people?”

443
00:34:49,068 --> 00:34:51,988
And when they disappeared, about five, six were remained.

444
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:55,320
I said, “Now let’s have dinner!” He was very unhappy

445
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:58,153
and he was looking this side and that side,

446
00:34:58,273 --> 00:35:00,761
I said, “What happened?” But he didn’t say anything.

447
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:03,827
So I slept that night in his house. Next morning I got up –

448
00:35:03,947 --> 00:35:07,838
still he was very uneasy. Next day I said,

449
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:10,222
“What’s the matter? What’s playing on your mind?”

450
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,931
He said, “Mother why did you ask all of them to go away?

451
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:15,106
I had prepared [dinner] for fifty of them?”

452
00:35:15,227 --> 00:35:17,896
This filled me with such joy you can’t imagine!

453
00:35:18,017 --> 00:35:20,000
Tremendous joy,

454
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:24,059
tremendous joy.

455
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:27,488
I mean, that I cannot get over such things you know.

456
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:30,185
And I have just seen so many Sahaja Yogis like that,

457
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:32,621
very very sweet persons. Another is Gregoire,

458
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:37,840
another very sweetie person, you know, the way he does things for others.

459
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:43,210
Sometimes the way he works it out is so sweet,

460
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,878
and how he really knows how to express himself sweetly

461
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:52,048
in small, little things.

462
00:35:53,103 --> 00:35:59,765
It’s so surprising, how people are very beautiful

463
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:05,348
and how they are working out these material things

464
00:36:05,468 --> 00:36:07,809
to express their emotions.

465
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:11,195
Material is for emotions only, you see.

466
00:36:11,315 --> 00:36:14,650
My mother had a principal that, if she had six sarees,

467
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,834
the seventh one she’ll present out.

468
00:36:16,954 --> 00:36:20,703
She had kept six; not more [are] needed, you see.

469
00:36:20,823 --> 00:36:23,389
And she was a woman of great principle, I must say,

470
00:36:23,509 --> 00:36:27,583
because she used to spin her own sarees. Can you imagine!

471
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:31,159
And that’s what she used to wear, herself.

472
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,420
And she was a wife of a very rich man, I mean,

473
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,229
she had no problem of money but this was her principle,

474
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,843
she used to live like that. And she said that,

475
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:42,051
“What? I need six, more than [that] I don’t need,”

476
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:44,863
because it’s cotton sarees, you see, so

477
00:36:44,983 --> 00:36:48,459
one saree you wash and next you wear and you can just press it.

478
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,410
We had people in the house who could do that for her.

479
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,891
She said, “There’s no need to have more than six.”

480
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:57,091
And one she would keep for some occasion, you see, expensive one,

481
00:36:57,211 --> 00:37:00,013
if she has to go for a wedding and all that, that’s all.

482
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:03,369
So the seventh was kept (to give away) and out of the six,

483
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:06,260
if she got one more she would donate that to somebody.

484
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,098
She would only keep up to six you see, that was her principle,

485
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:15,354
and she managed her life very well.

486
00:37:15,474 --> 00:37:22,308
And I was also bit too much of a generous person

487
00:37:22,482 --> 00:37:27,595
and she always supported my generosity, always she supported it.

488
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:30,984
And she was very happy when she found that I would just give away

489
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:34,099
lots of things to people who came to my house and she would say,

490
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,276
“Oh that’s very good, she should do that.”

491
00:37:36,397 --> 00:37:38,596
Everybody used to say that, “That should be done”.

492
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:41,383
Always used to encourage me for such things that I did.

493
00:37:41,503 --> 00:37:43,735
But I found [that] all things have only value

494
00:37:43,855 --> 00:37:47,302
if I can give them away otherwise they have no value.

495
00:37:47,422 --> 00:37:50,331
And I keep only the things that are being presented to me

496
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:53,795
all the rest pass out of my hands very easily into people.

497
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:56,698
Anybody who says, “I like this,” “Alright, have it!”

498
00:37:56,819 --> 00:38:00,104
You see, I feel so happy to give it to them and it’s really rewarding.

499
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:02,707
Now that person thinks, “What should I give you back?”

500
00:38:02,828 --> 00:38:04,792
I said, “Now please! That’s not to be done

501
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:07,690
because you know already, come and see, this house is filled

502
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:10,442
with things, and I don’t know how to get rid of them.”

503
00:38:10,563 --> 00:38:14,301
If I buy anything myself, of course I don’t earn anything

504
00:38:14,421 --> 00:38:20,203
so it’s from my husband’s money, I try to give it away.

505
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:23,606
It’s very nice, it’s really extremely nice.

506
00:38:23,726 --> 00:38:26,279
After all what’s the use of these things in the house?

507
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,539
What are you going to do [with them]?

508
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,703
I mean, if you have to have a personal archives, you can have!

509
00:38:32,823 --> 00:38:35,908
You see, something like that, putting up this thing bought there,

510
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:39,844
this thing bought there. But normally what do you do?

511
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:44,985
So this kind of a generosity is to be developed within us.

512
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:53,278
The aesthetics of generosity is to be seen.

513
00:38:53,993 --> 00:38:59,301
How you give things to others and how you express your emotional being.

514
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:04,379
For people who are emotionally dry because of ego orientation,

515
00:39:04,499 --> 00:39:08,596
should learn these things, is very important.

516
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:12,789
That will give them some emotional side also.

517
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:15,581
[It’s] very much necessary for people

518
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:20,152
who do not feel their feelings much, their joy much;

519
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:24,930
they should try to do it [then] they will start feeling it much more.

520
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:29,165
Then the emotional side is enlightened within us,

521
00:39:31,443 --> 00:39:35,267
the Grace starts flowing up to emotional side.

522
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:40,541
In emotional side, first of all the purification takes place.

523
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,654
That’s very important.

524
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:45,404
To lead a very beautiful emotional life

525
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:48,580
you must have pure ideas,

526
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:52,363
otherwise you can never be emotionally alright.

527
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:55,154
You see, like in a tree you have to have leaves

528
00:39:55,274 --> 00:39:58,617
you have to have roots, you have to have fruits,

529
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:02,452
you have to have flowers at it’s proper places.

530
00:40:02,572 --> 00:40:05,647
Like in your house you have to have a drawing room,

531
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:09,189
you have to have a bedroom, you have to have a bathroom;

532
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:13,596
everything separated. You do not put them into a complete,

533
00:40:13,716 --> 00:40:19,491
what do you call that? A mixer.

534
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,131
You do not make it like that, isn’t it?

535
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:25,388
You don’t put your bathroom in the drawing rooms do you?

536
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:28,482
I mean some people may start it with the kind of confusion

537
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:31,855
they have these days! But normally you do not do it.

538
00:40:31,975 --> 00:40:38,974
In our own emotional life we must have pure sense.

539
00:40:39,116 --> 00:40:45,213
Purity of a sisterly love, purity of a brotherly love,

540
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:47,327
purity of a wife’s love.

541
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:53,013
For example infidelity: infidelity is impurity,

542
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:56,678
infidelity comes when there is impurity.

543
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,402
Without fidelity the marriage life cannot be happy.

544
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:02,477
That’s the basis of married life.

545
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:07,895
You see, “I like…”  this “I like” business is impurity.

546
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:11,343
The impurity in you likes it.

547
00:41:12,025 --> 00:41:14,852
Gradually, after realisation, you start developing

548
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,304
that purity within you;

549
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:23,420
you start understanding these are your brothers and sisters.

550
00:41:24,444 --> 00:41:28,402
As soon as your emotional life starts improving

551
00:41:29,061 --> 00:41:31,404
your innocence starts awakening up.

552
00:41:31,524 --> 00:41:35,455
You see? It is connected with your innocence.

553
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:39,287
The left side is connected with your innocence.

554
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:45,307
And then it starts flowering and you really become innocent.

555
00:41:45,481 --> 00:41:50,016
Now see the practical side: you go to somebody’s house,

556
00:41:50,136 --> 00:41:54,157
the gentleman has a beautiful wife, now your bad eyes on the wife,

557
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:57,916
how can you enjoy? You cannot enjoy, the husband cannot enjoy,

558
00:41:58,036 --> 00:42:01,743
the wife cannot enjoy, all the time there’s a fear.

559
00:42:01,863 --> 00:42:05,265
Maybe the wife may run away with you or something may happen:

560
00:42:05,385 --> 00:42:08,839
the whole house will be finished, I mean, you are so destructive!

561
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:12,247
So-called ‘charming’ men and ‘charming’ women

562
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:14,343
are just destroying each others lives.

563
00:42:14,463 --> 00:42:17,971
Where do they land? All in the orphanages!

564
00:42:18,091 --> 00:42:21,549
A woman marries seven times, a husband marries eight times.

565
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:24,185
All these old people are in the orphanage

566
00:42:24,305 --> 00:42:26,566
and children are in another orphanage.

567
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:30,419
You see, you are just creating orphanages by this kind of impurity

568
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:33,421
in your mind. But by telling you, these things,

569
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:36,956
you are not going to believe me, nor you can do it,

570
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:39,667
but just when it happens.

571
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:45,211
When this happens, the innocence, the joy of pure love,

572
00:42:45,331 --> 00:42:51,775
when there is no other impurity but just pure love

573
00:42:51,895 --> 00:42:55,219
for brothers, sisters. I mean, here,

574
00:42:55,339 --> 00:43:00,721
I have seen people don’t even sort of embrace each other– men.

575
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:02,636
It’s most surprising,

576
00:43:02,756 --> 00:43:05,950
I mean, for us it’s something one can’t understand.

577
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:09,055
So much impurity has gone into our brain that every man,

578
00:43:09,175 --> 00:43:10,603
is he that way wrong?

579
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:13,256
When we came here my husband used to embrace every man;

580
00:43:13,377 --> 00:43:15,744
I told him, “Don’t do it, people will laugh at you!”

581
00:43:15,865 --> 00:43:16,983
He said, “Really?”

582
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:19,830
He said, “But everyone is not like that, maybe one person.”

583
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,499
I said, “No, they think everybody is like that.”

584
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:25,408
You see, whatever they found pathological in one person,

585
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:27,383
they think everybody is like that.

586
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:33,097
These psychologists, whatever they read in one abnormal person,

587
00:43:33,217 --> 00:43:36,560
they try to see in everyone! Everybody is not like that!

588
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,272
I mean there is no harm in understanding

589
00:43:40,392 --> 00:43:44,313
that there is only 1% people are pathological

590
00:43:44,433 --> 00:43:47,237
-who go to these psychologists!

591
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:50,751
The others who are spoilt are because of psychologists themselves!

592
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:53,975
They put ideas, “You have a guilt, you have a guilt, you have a guilt.”

593
00:43:54,096 --> 00:43:57,154
Even if you don’t have, you will have it! (laughter)

594
00:43:58,773 --> 00:44:01,745
They go on putting ideas into your heads.

595
00:44:01,865 --> 00:44:04,487
All this is supposed to be intellectual expansion,

596
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:07,012
whatever you may call it, it’s all nonsense you see.

597
00:44:07,132 --> 00:44:09,189
A person who doesn’t commit sin you say,

598
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:10,832
“Oh, he must have committed sin,”

599
00:44:10,953 --> 00:44:12,983
now he doesn’t know what to do he’ll come and say,

600
00:44:13,104 --> 00:44:15,370
“Alright baba, I have committed sin, now I have to confess.

601
00:44:15,491 --> 00:44:17,506
So I have to confess, yes I have committed sin.”

602
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:19,532
They play about like this.

603
00:44:19,652 --> 00:44:21,675
They just try to build you up and all that

604
00:44:21,796 --> 00:44:24,762
and then they break you, shatter you completely and then you think,

605
00:44:24,883 --> 00:44:28,700
“Oh I am the most sinful person [who] ever lived!”

606
00:44:30,565 --> 00:44:31,934
If you were that sinful,

607
00:44:32,054 --> 00:44:35,713
do you think you will get realisation first of all?

608
00:44:38,524 --> 00:44:42,897
First ask yourself the question, “How did I get realisation?

609
00:44:43,017 --> 00:44:44,742
How did I feel vibrations?

610
00:44:44,862 --> 00:44:48,047
If I was that sinful, how could I get it?”

611
00:44:48,643 --> 00:44:51,309
Throw away all these ideas of these psychologists

612
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:53,589
and tell them that we don’t believe you!

613
00:44:53,709 --> 00:44:57,784
You see, this is very few people who are really basically sinful.

614
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:03,057
I tell you, very, very rarely, I have not seen anyone so far,

615
00:45:03,177 --> 00:45:05,810
except for these horrible gurus who are well known!

616
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:08,962
After all they are the people who are rakshasas,

617
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:12,561
they are not human beings, you see, so that’s a different category.

618
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:15,327
But, otherwise, I have not seen basically a person

619
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:21,053
who has nothing good in him. Because everybody has the Spirit.

620
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:24,900
And definitely Spirit is superior much more dynamic

621
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,623
than all the sins put together.

622
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:30,870
What are these little, little sins here and there? What are you doing?

623
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,692
And there’s nothing to feel so diffident about it.

624
00:45:33,812 --> 00:45:37,235
After all you are realised people, you are saints.

625
00:45:37,355 --> 00:45:39,668
You are to be respected.

626
00:45:40,415 --> 00:45:43,808
You have to respect yourself first of all.

627
00:45:44,149 --> 00:45:47,629
You are all saints, do you realise that?

628
00:45:48,137 --> 00:45:52,062
Once you realise you are saints you will start acting as saints,

629
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,158
how the saints act.

630
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,698
You will put yourself onto that pedestal of understanding

631
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:00,758
that you are really saints, otherwise you won’t get vibrations.

632
00:46:00,879 --> 00:46:02,465
Go and ask anyone of these!

633
00:46:02,586 --> 00:46:06,723
They will tell you: the vibrations, only people who are saints get it.

634
00:46:06,844 --> 00:46:11,499
In India all the people are burnt when they die;

635
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:15,112
not the saints, realised souls are not,

636
00:46:17,678 --> 00:46:19,689
they are respected.

637
00:46:20,213 --> 00:46:22,263
They say when the saints come to your house,

638
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:25,744
that’s the day, is the day of festival.

639
00:46:27,197 --> 00:46:34,332
And all of you are that so don’t think that you cannot do this,

640
00:46:34,452 --> 00:46:36,962
and you have this guilt and you have these things –

641
00:46:37,082 --> 00:46:40,612
nothing of the kind! You are pure Spirit.

642
00:46:42,784 --> 00:46:45,914
Be very lavish about it!

643
00:46:46,906 --> 00:46:52,876
Of course, I mean, too much indulgences into these things,

644
00:46:53,154 --> 00:46:58,394
emotional life also, can lead you to a stagnation point.

645
00:46:58,514 --> 00:47:03,863
Like I hear people saying that, “There’s a lot of love between us.”

646
00:47:05,173 --> 00:47:09,335
But one has to be discreet in that also:

647
00:47:09,455 --> 00:47:15,341
does it make you universal or it makes you localised?

648
00:47:15,461 --> 00:47:20,752
You see, like Britishers for British, Indians for Indians, finished!

649
00:47:21,284 --> 00:47:27,362
If that love makes you universal, by which you say kindly things,

650
00:47:30,386 --> 00:47:37,478
by which you enjoy the love of other people, their vibrations.

651
00:47:37,598 --> 00:47:42,778
Whatever creed, race, it is, whatever part of the world they come from,

652
00:47:42,898 --> 00:47:45,552
they are Sahaja Yogis; if you start enjoying them,

653
00:47:45,672 --> 00:47:49,355
then know that that is love.

654
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:53,302
It should not be localised in any way.

655
00:47:53,676 --> 00:47:59,207
If there is any group forming, then must know that it is not love,

656
00:47:59,327 --> 00:48:04,105
it’s not Divinity, it’s not.

657
00:48:04,225 --> 00:48:10,504
Divinity is universal, it embraces everything, everything.

658
00:48:10,624 --> 00:48:14,442
It has no discrimination of any kind.

659
00:48:14,562 --> 00:48:20,046
It only discriminates between evil and good,

660
00:48:20,395 --> 00:48:23,943
unrighteous and righteous,

661
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,553
Christ and anti-Christ,

662
00:48:27,673 --> 00:48:30,673
God and anti-God

663
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:36,025
but it does not discriminate on these three levels

664
00:48:36,145 --> 00:48:43,180
that is physical appearances, mental approach

665
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,463
or mental development or emotional expressions.

666
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,834
Some people are emotionally very expressive.

667
00:48:50,954 --> 00:48:54,980
I would say English are less expressive by temperament maybe,

668
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,726
that’s their temperament. Indians are extremely expressive.

669
00:48:58,847 --> 00:49:00,702
If you go to India, to a village, say,

670
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:04,428
you go to Rahuri (Maharashtra), they will just take you

671
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:09,846
in their embrace and would start weeping and crying with joy.

672
00:49:09,966 --> 00:49:13,479
I mean, you will be amazed the way they will love you, I mean, imagine!

673
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,188
And for them it would be like, they wouldn’t mind

674
00:49:18,308 --> 00:49:22,120
even if they have to spread themselves on the ground

675
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,178
for you to walk smoothly

676
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:31,144
so that you don’t feel the horrible roads of India.

677
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:33,362
That kind of tremendous emotions,

678
00:49:33,482 --> 00:49:36,444
the expression you will be surprised.

679
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:38,759
You will be overwhelmed and sometimes shocked,

680
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,935
you know, the way they are.

681
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:45,465
But that doesn’t mean that English don’t love.

682
00:49:45,585 --> 00:49:50,231
They love in their own way; they understand that.

683
00:49:51,548 --> 00:49:54,905
So that’s how it should be that it is all embracing,

684
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:59,344
all shades, all types, all permutations, combinations.

685
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:03,506
Because this variety is created by God to create beauty

686
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,430
and all the varieties must be accepted.

687
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:07,986
Imagine you all looking just the same,

688
00:50:08,106 --> 00:50:12,395
how would it look? Horrible and boring!

689
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:16,505
Every leaf is different, then what about human beings?

690
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:19,617
But in that difference there’s the unity of Spirit

691
00:50:19,737 --> 00:50:22,025
and if you can feel that unity

692
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:27,967
then you are emotionally absolutely correct and you are a realised soul.

693
00:50:29,737 --> 00:50:34,953
And, last of all, the most important, is your Spirit,

694
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:39,146
Spirit that resides in your heart.

695
00:50:39,535 --> 00:50:45,683
All this beauty is only perceived when there is light in your Spirit

696
00:50:45,803 --> 00:50:50,364
otherwise you cannot see all this beauty, you cannot enjoy it.

697
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:57,965
Spirit is the one which is the diamond

698
00:50:59,521 --> 00:51:03,054
which shines on this beautiful ring of your body,

699
00:51:03,174 --> 00:51:08,890
mind and your emotions. That’s the most important thing.

700
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:16,653
That is to be achieved, to be absolutely absorbed into your being.

701
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:21,812
That state should be achieved by all of you.

702
00:51:21,932 --> 00:51:26,622
But the growth, if the outside is not alright,

703
00:51:26,742 --> 00:51:33,543
then the inside cannot be carried by that weak outside.

704
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:39,580
It’s such a strong thing spiritual life is a very strong thing;

705
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,457
it’s so dynamic, it’s so powerful.

706
00:51:44,203 --> 00:51:48,013
Sometimes, you know, it floods me completely.

707
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:51,210
I mean, I have to control myself;

708
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:54,833
the love just shoots off from the being

709
00:51:54,953 --> 00:52:01,263
and just I want to give it but I wonder

710
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:04,288
whether you’ll be able to bear it,

711
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:09,232
so I have to control it a little bit [because]

712
00:52:09,352 --> 00:52:12,337
that flood may not be borne.

713
00:52:12,457 --> 00:52:17,890
So you have to enrich your outside to bear that inside beauty.

714
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:22,490
And the more you enrich it, the more you make it strong,

715
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:25,360
the more it will shine.

716
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:33,297
It’s so simultaneous because one must understand that Spirit is love,

717
00:52:34,741 --> 00:52:39,257
is all intelligence, is all awareness,

718
00:52:39,377 --> 00:52:42,681
and it knows your problem. It slowly shines.

719
00:52:42,801 --> 00:52:47,577
It sees how far you can bear, how far you can go.

720
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:55,224
Then after realisation, when you start looking after your outside,

721
00:52:55,344 --> 00:52:59,334
the inside starts shining by itself.

722
00:53:00,731 --> 00:53:05,271
But attention should be towards your Spirit.

723
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:10,242
All these outside qualities are so joy-giving to the Spirit.

724
00:53:10,362 --> 00:53:13,857
You can’t imagine. Try them!

725
00:53:14,563 --> 00:53:16,160
You will enjoy yourself.

726
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,862
We have not been able to enjoy ourselves much.

727
00:53:18,982 --> 00:53:21,413
If we could we would not [even] shun the jails,

728
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:24,216
I mean I would be happy in a jail I tell you,

729
00:53:24,336 --> 00:53:27,227
because I can enjoy myself there better!

730
00:53:27,347 --> 00:53:30,311
But the one thing is there, you cannot enjoy yourself

731
00:53:30,431 --> 00:53:34,568
so much when you cannot share it with others also isn’t it?

732
00:53:34,688 --> 00:53:40,061
It becomes like that. Without sharing you cannot enjoy yourself.

733
00:53:40,663 --> 00:53:43,819
And that’s what should happen to all the Sahaja Yogis.

734
00:53:43,939 --> 00:53:48,259
At that level you should come. We should be at that level.

735
00:53:48,379 --> 00:53:52,000
Try to keep your level that high, is important.

736
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:57,225
Sometimes you come down, you start criticising others.

737
00:53:57,345 --> 00:53:59,820
Others are also not right, for example, somebody sees

738
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,377
somebody filthy, dirty, something like that.

739
00:54:02,497 --> 00:54:04,504
The person who’s filthy, dirty, of course

740
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:07,155
there’s something wrong with that person, no doubt,

741
00:54:07,276 --> 00:54:10,464
but that person should be pitied. At least he should be clean.

742
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:13,809
I mean, that’s the minimum of minimum.

743
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,322
But instead of that if you start criticising that person,

744
00:54:17,443 --> 00:54:19,283
you also become filthy in your language,

745
00:54:19,404 --> 00:54:22,310
filthy in your mind and everything, so why [do it]? Leave it!

746
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:24,058
Let that person improve by himself,

747
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,698
to see that he has to be clean, he has to be neat,

748
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:29,048
he has to be sensible.

749
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,714
This is to be seen by that person himself and not by you.

750
00:54:33,834 --> 00:54:36,429
Where is your attention?

751
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:40,800
It’s a habit in India, all the parents will ask the children

752
00:54:40,921 --> 00:54:43,203
when they are standing, “Where is your attention?”

753
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:46,496
“Where is my attention?” alright. Then again he’s standing there,

754
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,539
“Where is your attention?” Again he’ll be on the watch [out],

755
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:51,415
“Where is my attention gone?”

756
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:53,919
We have to look after our attention, that’s all.

757
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:59,741
“Where is my attention? Is it on the Spirit?”

758
00:54:59,884 --> 00:55:03,465
Next time I’ll tell you more about the Spirit part.

759
00:55:03,585 --> 00:55:06,095
I hope you have understood how necessary it is

760
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:10,209
to develop your inner being.

761
00:55:10,804 --> 00:55:16,248
In your mental being, egoistical nature is to be controlled very much.

762
00:55:16,368 --> 00:55:21,611
I have seen people who go from left to right, they become egoistical.

763
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:27,156
Those who go from right to left, they become frightened.

764
00:55:27,799 --> 00:55:34,712
All these side movements must be brought to the centre.

765
00:55:36,029 --> 00:55:41,625
You have to understand that from basics we have to rise higher.

766
00:55:41,745 --> 00:55:46,774
People have explanation for everything! No explanation is needed.

767
00:55:46,895 --> 00:55:49,562
Whom are you explaining? You are explaining to yourself,

768
00:55:49,682 --> 00:55:53,240
you are judging yourself. You have to judge yourself,

769
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,727
[to] whom are you explaining? Mataji?

770
00:55:56,967 --> 00:55:59,436
She doesn’t need any explanation.

771
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:03,454
I know, perhaps, everything, perhaps.

772
00:56:04,223 --> 00:56:06,128
But I don’t condemn you and in any way

773
00:56:06,249 --> 00:56:09,285
I do not want that you should be condemned by any chance at all,

774
00:56:09,406 --> 00:56:11,446
why should I? You are all saints after all.

775
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:15,334
For me it’s the greatest satisfaction.

776
00:56:15,454 --> 00:56:21,180
But for your own growth I want you to understand

777
00:56:21,591 --> 00:56:24,240
that you are saints and you have to come up to that point.

778
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,485
Saints have to be self-disciplined, nobody has to tell them.

779
00:56:27,605 --> 00:56:30,050
Discipline yourself,

780
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:34,675
tell yourself, “I am a saint now.”

781
00:56:34,795 --> 00:56:39,671
What an opportunity it is to grow! What an opportunity!

782
00:56:40,242 --> 00:56:42,714
And people are only going to believe in you

783
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:48,950
when you are really the saint within and saint without.

784
00:56:49,432 --> 00:56:52,097
In Sahaja Yoga, people become saints within

785
00:56:52,217 --> 00:56:54,022
and not saints without easily.

786
00:56:54,142 --> 00:56:57,142
But in other systems they are first made outside, you see,

787
00:56:57,262 --> 00:57:02,566
they are made to work for 25 years just washing the temple – finished!

788
00:57:03,145 --> 00:57:05,978
Then they are made to do something else for 25 years.

789
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:08,501
By the time they are about to [be] dead they’ll say,

790
00:57:08,622 --> 00:57:12,735
“Alright, next time we’ll give you realisation.”

791
00:57:12,856 --> 00:57:18,693
It’s like that. But here, from inside you have really achieved

792
00:57:19,424 --> 00:57:24,161
your realisation no doubt, and you have greater chances of improving.

793
00:57:24,281 --> 00:57:26,529
This is what I thought, that,

794
00:57:26,649 --> 00:57:29,913
“This lifetime I am just going to give realisation

795
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:33,560
to all the people who come to me – let’s see.”

796
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:40,109
And you are going to do full justice to my bold step

797
00:57:41,513 --> 00:57:46,653
because now you’ve got it. It is going to work out much faster.

798
00:57:46,773 --> 00:57:47,986
It has to work out.

799
00:57:48,106 --> 00:57:52,441
This was the only way it could have worked out faster than to make you,

800
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:58,665
first of all, wash yourself every day, get up at 4 o’clock and make you

801
00:57:58,785 --> 00:58:06,167
like military people . I said, “No, let’s try this way.”

802
00:58:06,287 --> 00:58:10,998
And it’s done, it’s happening, it’s so simple.

803
00:58:11,427 --> 00:58:14,573
Then the self-discipline must start.

804
00:58:15,247 --> 00:58:17,735
And you must try to improve your light,

805
00:58:17,855 --> 00:58:19,634
which is just kindled,

806
00:58:19,754 --> 00:58:25,345
to make it a beautiful light, clean light and generous,

807
00:58:25,465 --> 00:58:29,580
giving light, the light of love.

808
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:32,642
It will work out I am sure.

809
00:58:32,904 --> 00:58:37,771
Keep your standards high. Do not fall down.

810
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:41,419
Put your attention into proper gear.

811
00:58:41,665 --> 00:58:46,432
It’s all prophesised, as you know. Blake has prophesised it.

812
00:58:46,552 --> 00:58:49,887
The more I read the book the more I am convinced

813
00:58:50,007 --> 00:58:53,171
that England is going to be the Jerusalem.

814
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:58,507
Now think of that. No lethargy allowed.

815
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:04,428
While I find Australians are coming up much faster.

816
00:59:05,277 --> 00:59:09,527
You have to prove Blake’s prophesy.

817
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:13,157
May God bless you. All of you.

818
00:59:15,832 --> 00:59:18,625
Cooly, can you give me some water please?

819
00:59:21,149 --> 00:59:22,827
Look at the children!!

820
00:59:23,954 --> 00:59:26,896
All quiet! Thank you very much.

821
00:59:35,888 --> 00:59:41,551
If you could arrange a seminar Gavin, anytime,

822
00:59:41,671 --> 00:59:46,337
for three days, I can postpone my going to India.

823
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,875
As I would like to have a seminar sometime.

824
00:59:48,995 --> 00:59:53,433
Gavin: We can get a place in Sussex, from the,

825
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,946
I think it’s the twelfth, no the eleventh, to the thirteenth,

826
00:59:57,066 --> 01:00:02,504
that’s a mid-week time. We can have about 45-50 people.

827
01:00:03,439 --> 01:00:04,888
Shri Mataji: We have many more.

828
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:10,680
I would like to have it on a Saturday Sunday somewhere.

829
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,106
Gavin: We can find somewhere

830
01:00:12,226 --> 01:00:14,947
but it is difficult to get these places for a weekend.

831
01:00:15,067 --> 01:00:16,908
We’re still trying.

832
01:00:17,369 --> 01:00:23,512
Shri Mataji: I think in a, any place, like Brighton or something

833
01:00:23,632 --> 01:00:28,378
you might get it, or why not hire a boat?

834
01:00:37,892 --> 01:00:39,629
Isn’t it a good idea?

835
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:42,662
Gavin: We can see what we can do.

836
01:00:44,915 --> 01:00:46,839
Actually I was looking out for a ship.

837
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,382
If one of the Shipping Corporation ships had arrived,

838
01:00:49,502 --> 01:00:52,357
I thought we’ll go and stay in a ship, would be a good idea,

839
01:00:52,478 --> 01:00:55,690
because it always is there for about three four days.

840
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:59,010
But there’s no ship arriving in this month

841
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,855
otherwise, we could have done it.

842
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,498
Some sort of a boat for two days you can hire,

843
01:01:05,618 --> 01:01:09,855
a big boat where all of us could be there on a Saturday Sunday.

844
01:01:09,975 --> 01:01:11,766
We should be there, it’s important.

845
01:01:11,886 --> 01:01:16,539
Before I leave I would like to fix some certain screws.

846
01:01:19,871 --> 01:01:23,792
I mean, you can have it on Thames River if you want.

847
01:01:23,912 --> 01:01:29,877
Or Brighton, do you have boats or things? No? Just find out.

848
01:01:31,012 --> 01:01:32,657
So that should be resolved

849
01:01:32,777 --> 01:01:34,986
and then I will arrange my going accordingly.

850
01:01:35,106 --> 01:01:38,392
If there is any program like that I will postpone it.

851
01:01:38,512 --> 01:01:42,040
But I would like to know as soon as possible.

852
01:01:50,112 --> 01:01:54,696
As I have told you before that Sahaja Yoga has no technique;

853
01:01:54,816 --> 01:01:59,091
it’s a spontaneous happening which takes place.

854
01:02:00,694 --> 01:02:08,353
Now the flower becomes the fruit, it has no technique,

855
01:02:08,473 --> 01:02:12,819
but the sun has to come to do the job, you see,

856
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:16,711
and that technique is beyond our understanding.

857
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:21,772
In the same way it happens – just transformation.

858
01:02:23,217 --> 01:02:26,810
But later on you must know how to maintain

859
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:28,741
and how to keep it up, that’s all.

860
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:31,381
Once it is managed it can be worked out.

861
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:36,631
Many people have done it, and you should be able to do it also.

862
01:02:37,107 --> 01:02:40,907
But try not to see others. See yourself first.

863
01:02:41,027 --> 01:02:45,354
That’s very important. That is a very important part.

864
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:46,400
CLERCK

865
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:50,277
If you can put your hands towards me, like this just,

866
01:02:51,927 --> 01:02:55,527
and close your eyes, just close your eyes.

867
01:03:04,049 --> 01:03:08,215
If your hands are shaking or your body is shaking

868
01:03:08,335 --> 01:03:12,791
or your eyes are fluttering, I mean the eyelids,

869
01:03:12,911 --> 01:03:16,596
then you open your eyes and just watch me,

870
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:20,200
just watch me on my forehead.

871
01:03:23,811 --> 01:03:28,039
Have you been to some guru or someone? No one?

872
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:31,224
What do you do for your work?

873
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,647
Seeker: I’m a clerk.

874
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:37,460
Shri Mataji: Ah, that’s it.

875
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:41,838
Ah, the right side is too much used.

876
01:03:43,417 --> 01:03:45,190
Should work out. Are

877
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:51,669
you shaking also?

878
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:55,974
No? You are getting cool breeze? It’s great.

879
01:03:56,489 --> 01:04:03,861
Are you getting? Not yet. None of the fingers? Which one?

880
01:04:04,012 --> 01:04:09,744
Did you go to any guru or anyone? Did you to anyone? Guru or anyone?

881
01:04:09,864 --> 01:04:14,788
To spiritualist or anyone? No?

882
01:04:20,786 --> 01:04:24,417
Are you getting cool breeze? Good.

883
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:32,974
Put both the feet straight. Relax. You are getting? Good.

884
01:04:33,094 --> 01:04:36,161
Close your eyes and enjoy your Self.

885
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:43,442
Better now. Just do it like that, you see.

886
01:04:43,562 --> 01:04:45,903
It’s more on the right side, is a problem.

887
01:04:46,023 --> 01:04:49,221
It’s because too much thinking, thinking, you know.

888
01:04:49,341 --> 01:04:55,227
So the imbalance of…too much thinking also gives an imbalance, you see.

889
01:04:55,347 --> 01:04:58,071
All the time you’re thinking, thinking, thinking.

890
01:04:58,191 --> 01:05:02,020
That gives you a trouble. It should work out.

891
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:07,173
See, put your left hand on the stomach, the centre, yes.

892
01:05:07,293 --> 01:05:11,827
Put your right hand now towards me, like this.

893
01:05:11,947 --> 01:05:14,819
Now the shaking will be less.

894
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:20,102
Put it there so you will be comfortable.

895
01:05:20,222 --> 01:05:22,916
It will reduce gradually.

896
01:05:23,036 --> 01:05:23,749
1’05’30

897
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:28,808
You See? This is nothing but there’s nervousness inside,

898
01:05:28,928 --> 01:05:30,326
which has to go out.

899
01:05:30,446 --> 01:05:35,518
You see the nerves have been too much tortured by thinking.

900
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:41,770
Now it’s better, soothing down.

901
01:05:43,127 --> 01:05:44,653
Much better, see?

902
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:46,789
It will soothe down.

903
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:47,558
END CLERCK

904
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:50,890
Anne, there are some new people I see on the left hand side.

905
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:53,806
Just see them, if they are realised, all of them.

906
01:05:53,926 --> 01:05:58,524
Just see some of these people who are there.

907
01:06:00,443 --> 01:06:05,825
Yah, just see. Have you got cool breeze there?

908
01:06:06,134 --> 01:06:09,258
Have you got cool breeze in the hand?

909
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:15,934
What did you say? You have got it?

910
01:06:16,054 --> 01:06:17,957
Seeker: YesShri Mataji: Good. Good.

911
01:06:18,077 --> 01:06:20,490
They are from Brighton are they?

912
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:24,456
Have you come from Brighton? No. Good.

913
01:06:24,576 --> 01:06:30,650
Jason, just see if they are getting cool breeze on the head also.

914
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:34,745
This side, are there new people?

915
01:06:37,261 --> 01:06:39,307
You got the cool breeze?

916
01:06:39,427 --> 01:06:40,337
Seeker: Not sure

917
01:06:40,457 --> 01:06:44,214
Shri Mataji: All right, it comes so much that you’ll get sure of it,

918
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:49,528
all right? Just work it out.

919
01:06:52,873 --> 01:06:54,574
You can work out.

920
01:06:58,324 --> 01:06:59,929
There also.

921
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:05,293
Peter, in front of you there, just see, someone.

922
01:07:07,063 --> 01:07:09,392
Behind is there someone sitting?

923
01:07:09,512 --> 01:07:12,367
He’s come for the first time?

924
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:19,109
How are you, Anna? Better?

925
01:07:22,152 --> 01:07:24,647
She’s got it.

926
01:07:28,812 --> 01:07:31,781
Better now? It’s better.

927
01:07:31,901 --> 01:07:35,236
Still there? Less, but much less.

928
01:07:35,356 --> 01:07:39,329
Just do it like that.
Just throw it away. Throw it away.

929
01:07:39,449 --> 01:07:43,419
It has to go out. Now, let’s see.

930
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,995
Just imagine.

931
01:07:48,115 --> 01:07:51,467
Throw it away again, it’s horrible.

932
01:07:54,105 --> 01:07:56,391
Who’s there?
Left to the right, you just put him,

933
01:07:56,511 --> 01:07:59,142
left to the right for him. Come along. Good.

934
01:07:59,262 --> 01:08:04,973
Put it left to the right yes.
They will do it. You put your right hand, yes.

935
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:12,085
Are you better now? Are you feeling any cool breeze?

936
01:08:20,084 --> 01:08:22,553
How many years you have worked as a clerk?

937
01:08:22,673 --> 01:08:23,791
Clerk: Twelve.

938
01:08:30,227 --> 01:08:35,478
Shri Mataji: Look after his Vishuddhi
and centre heart. He’ll be all right.

939
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:38,714
Yah! Vishuddhi and centre heart.

940
01:08:42,836 --> 01:08:46,244
Terrific, they are terrific people.

941
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:52,593
All right, is she all right?

942
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:56,682
What? Put your left hand here.

943
01:08:56,802 --> 01:08:59,854
All right? A little bit and put both the feet straight

944
01:08:59,974 --> 01:09:04,153
like that on the ground would be better. Like this,

945
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:06,330
both the feet. Yes, let’s see.

946
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:10,091
She’s all right, I think, she’s got it.

947
01:09:12,924 --> 01:09:19,167
 She’s all right. What about this gentleman? Left to the right.

948
01:09:20,996 --> 01:09:23,952
It’s nice you came to see me.

949
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:28,562
Really, because anything could have happened, you know,

950
01:09:28,682 --> 01:09:33,081
with this kind of a tremendous pressure on your mind.

951
01:09:33,525 --> 01:09:36,925
It’s still there. It will be.

952
01:09:39,928 --> 01:09:43,474
That’s how people get all these troubles, like diabetes, you see.

953
01:09:43,594 --> 01:09:47,222
Then even if they don’t listen to that then they could get heart.

954
01:09:47,342 --> 01:09:50,973
Then you get other problems on the left hand side, you see.

955
01:09:51,093 --> 01:09:53,493
Even paralysis can be due to this.

956
01:09:53,613 --> 01:09:58,427
It’s a very bad thing to work like that, worrying about it.

957
01:09:58,547 --> 01:10:00,245
Are you all right?

958
01:10:03,444 --> 01:10:05,482
It will work out. What is it, John?

959
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:06,760
John Watkinson: Nabhi.

960
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,159
Shri Mataji: Nabhi? Nabhi.

961
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:14,014
Put your left hand on the stomach. Stomach, yes.

962
01:10:14,816 --> 01:10:16,610
What about him?

963
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:18,683
Yogini: Left Nabhi

964
01:10:18,975 --> 01:10:21,297
Shri Mataji: Are you married?Seeker: I’m not

965
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:23,292
You are not married?Seeker: No.

966
01:10:23,412 --> 01:10:27,924
Shri Mataji: You don’t want to marry?Seeker: I’m a widower.

967
01:10:29,157 --> 01:10:30,660
Shri Mataji: When was that?

968
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,500
Seeker: About eight years ago.
