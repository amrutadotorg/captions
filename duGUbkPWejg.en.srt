1
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:49,840
Today, we have decided to worship the Yogeshwara.
I think that is the greatest name of Shri

2
00:02:49,840 --> 00:03:04,010
Krishna for us. That means He is the Ishwara
of yoga. Yoga means the union ,as you know,

3
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:13,770
with the divine. But also yoga has another
meaning which means yukti. In English language

4
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:29,730
to translate it properly is not possible.
Yukti means the trick. but trick is always

5
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:36,170
connected with something funny and bad. But
this 'yukti' means the technique. But 'technique'

6
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:44,840
is mechanical. So I couldn't find any proper
word for 'yukti'. But one can say that: to

7
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:54,030
know the technique and the trick of the technique
is also another meaning of yoga - yukti.

8
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:05,770
So, even if you are connected, if you do not
know the trick of the union then it is useless,

9
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:17,660
it is of no avail. So what one has to learn,
after getting realization, is not only the

10
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:28,160
technique but the trick of the technique.
At Krishna's level when we reach - it is an

11
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:37,850
incarnation after Shri Rama's. So Shri Rama
came as a 'Maryada Purushottama', which means

12
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:54,660
a person who is a complete ideal of maryadas
and a benevolent king.

13
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:03,590
But in the case of Shri Krishna it was a different
phase because people had become extremely

14
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:16,390
serious, very disciplined, and were leading
a life which was, we can say, over-dharmic.

15
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:28,480
And this had put the people at a level, fixed,
and they thought that "If we are doing all

16
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:35,400
these things every day then it's alright.
We have reached the last." So Shri Krishna

17
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:47,310
had to come - Himself, Shri Vishnu, came as
Shri Krishna - to tell us about the ascent,

18
00:05:47,310 --> 00:06:00,400
and that - all this is just a play. But only
a person who is a master of the play can do

19
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,480
the play.

20
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:12,780
So to know the play. Supposing you have communication,
you have electrical communications. Now you

21
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:23,200
don't know how to play with it - play. Not
how to know or how to connect but to play.

22
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:33,060
Supposing only you know all the technique,
then it becomes quite a headache, because

23
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,720
all the time you think you are doing it. You
have to do this and, this is to be done, that

24
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,900
has to be done, and this connection is not
all right; that should be properly connected.

25
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:55,200
You get tired and bored. But if it's a play
for you, just a play. For any master it's

26
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,460
a play.

27
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:05,590
If it's just a play for you, then you don't
feel tired - it's fun, it's fun. And that

28
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:11,980
is what is Leela, that's why He is called
'Leeladhara' - because He is a master. He

29
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:29,230
came as a master, master not as a guru, but
master of all the arts of this yoga, yukti.

30
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:43,780
So He is so deft, He's so capable, that for
Him it's a play. All this is a play for Him.

31
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:51,919
And this is what one has to know, that, in
yoga, everything that you do should be just

32
00:07:51,919 --> 00:08:03,520
a play. Say, getting up at 5 o'clock in the
morning, should be a play.

33
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:12,860
In the morning you get up. The sun has not
yet come, to suggest what you have to do,

34
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:24,120
and the moon has departed, and in that twilight
or a little darkness if you get up, it's very

35
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:34,110
beautiful. And at that time you sit down for
your dhyaan. But it's not a serious thing,

36
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:44,779
it's not something that is boring, it's a
play. But for that you have to be a master.

37
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:52,710
If you are the master of yoga, then it's a
play. So first Shri Rama's state has to be

38
00:08:52,710 --> 00:09:07,220
there where you become really a Vishwa Nirmala
Dharmi - so that it becomes your play.

39
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:17,960
Now communication with the Divine has to go
to the whole world. The whole world has to

40
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:29,070
get this communication that you have received.
For this part Shri Krishna arranged something

41
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:42,670
in His lifetime in a very simple way, as a
child. It looks, very childlike. Like when

42
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:49,380
the Gopi's were taking their baths He hid
their clothes - I mean, Indian women are never

43
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:57,510
fully nude, never - He hid their saris and
all that and He could see their back, this

44
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:06,200
little boy. What is for a little boy? He's
sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their

45
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:15,420
Kundalini. They're coming out of the river
Jamuna which is being vibrated by Radha. Already

46
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:21,050
there are vibrations, you see - raising their
Kundalini.

47
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:30,810
Then they are taking the water and He breaks
their pitchers, from the back, which have

48
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:40,360
also got vibrated water in. So the vibrated
water falls on the backs of these ladies and

49
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:53,080
He tries to awaken their Kundalini. See the
play of a child, how He tried to play in His

50
00:10:53,080 --> 00:11:04,029
childhood, just like a child. And then He
shows, later on, His child-like expertise

51
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:14,839
in dealing with politics, dealing with people,
with communication and everything. And His

52
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:21,840
power was Radha, Radha 'Ra' 'dha' . 'Ra' means
energy, 'Dha' means the one which sustains

53
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,319
- 'Ra-dha'. So the "Dha Re Di Dha Sa Ma" (???) as
they say. In the same way Radha 'Ra' 'Dha'

54
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:32,180
- the one who sustains the energy.

55
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:40,160
So the first quality that He got from Her
is - She's the 'Alaahda Dayini'. I couldn't

56
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:48,440
find a word in English for 'Alaahd'. 'Alaahd'
is when you suddenly see something nice and

57
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:59,020
joy starts. Just feel very happy. I mean,
there are very few words in English, as you

58
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:09,640
know, for joy or at the most happiness. But
'Alaahd' is a kind of a joy which, as you

59
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:16,860
get the fresh air - then how you feel. That
is Alaahd. So She is 'Alaahda Dayini'. She's

60
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,459
the one who is the giver of Alaahd.

61
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:30,680
And so with Her powers, He could work out
this Alaahd to all the people with whom He

62
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:38,630
was connected. So all the Gopas and Gopis
who were with Him had to do Rasa. 'Ra' is

63
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:45,890
'energy', 'Sa' means 'with'. To dance with
the energy that is Radhaji. He used to just

64
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:53,910
play the flute and She used to dance, the
energy used to pass through Her hands to all

65
00:12:53,910 --> 00:13:03,440
the other people and the Kundalini would be
awakened. So this was another play that He

66
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:15,480
had. So in the play only He raised the Kundalini.
But in modern times it's very difficult, it

67
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:27,660
is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern
times in that way. I mean, nobody will understand

68
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,120
also.

69
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,680
So in modern times when Sahaja Yoga is not
just raising the Kundalini but giving the

70
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:49,880
complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga and also
empowering the person with the power to give

71
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:56,769
others realization, it was tremendous task.
And that's why we had to find out these methods

72
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:06,790
by which we could give realization to people.
In those days Kundalinis were awakened but

73
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:13,890
the Sahasrara was not broken. So Kundalini
must be somewhere hanging in the agnya, maybe

74
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:23,600
at heart, maybe somewhere. And such people
became the seekers and that's how we find,

75
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,959
today, people are here as Sahaja Yogis whose
Sahasrara's are open and they know all the

76
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,890
yukti of Sahaja Yoga.

77
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:44,000
But there are subtler and subtler yuktis of
Sahaja Yoga which you have to master. The

78
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:55,800
first is that His character was 'madhuriya',
meaning the sweetness. Sweetness. We always

79
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:09,970
say, "He's sweet like honey". So when He talked
to anyone or He communicated with anyone,

80
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:23,050
it was through sweetness; and this communication,
if you have not developed, then you are nowhere

81
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:42,890
near Yoga. To talk to someone sweetly, automatically.
Everything is madhuriya for Him, His talking,

82
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:49,649
His actions, His face. Everything is madhuriya.

83
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:55,950
So when we talk of communications first of
all the greatest thing is the communication

84
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:04,670
between human beings and when we have to think
of the communication with the human beings

85
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:14,680
many people think that by aggression you will
communicate better, which is not true. I mean

86
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:23,500
if somebody wants to get something out of
someone, say; so you go there and just talk,

87
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:32,769
"I have to have! How can you do it? This,
that!" As it is - it's no good. But if you

88
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:46,640
are sweet and start talking sweetly then 99%
will definitely dissolve. So to dissolve people

89
00:16:46,640 --> 00:17:00,820
with sweetness - how to do it - that trick
one has to learn: how, with sweetness, you

90
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:12,220
can dissolve people. This is one of His special
qualities, that you talk to someone in such

91
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:26,269
a manner, genuinely, in a very sweet manner,
and the problem between you and that person

92
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:30,639
will be dissolved, absolutely.

93
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:38,039
Now there are many tricks and how to talk
to someone is one of the biggest things one

94
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:44,869
has to learn. First of all you must always
show that you are less intelligent than another

95
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:58,509
person. Like if I'm talking to a scientist
I will say, "I'm sorry I don't know any science

96
00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:15,720
you know. I'm no good for a scientist." So
they feel "ahhhh, very good." If you have

97
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:25,389
to talk to some musician, you must say "I
don't know any music. No, I just have learned

98
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:31,869
a little bit, but not much." Musician feels
very happy. You may call it a pampering of

99
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:40,049
the ego. You may call it [that]. But there's
no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared

100
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:44,950
to you".

101
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:53,230
So the first trick is complete humility when
you talk to another person. It's the sign

102
00:18:53,230 --> 00:19:01,429
of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits

103
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:13,210
they bend down. So, first of all, if you say
"I am no one. I don't understand anything

104
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:23,789
but I would like to hear" this is first. The
first quality of communication is to be extremely

105
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:34,519
humble about yourself. The other person should
not know who you are. And there's a lot of

106
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:45,519
fun in it. Say for example now - I can say
about Myself that My husband was very highly

107
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:55,749
placed in India. But I met a friend in Delhi
- she was studying with Me in school and in

108
00:19:55,749 --> 00:20:00,159
college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was

109
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:06,259
just a useless, small, little place meant
for very ordinary officers because they had

110
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:11,359
not allotted us any house or anything so,
temporarily, we were there. She said "what?

111
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,869
What is your husband doing?" I said "He's
some governments servant." I didn't tell her

112
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:26,330
[his position]! He came down, so he just looked
at Me and he smiled. She said "do you know

113
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:32,710
him?" I said "He's My husband". She was shocked,
"He's your husband? Oh my God! Why didn't

114
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:38,799
you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing
changed and she felt so ashamed of herself.

115
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:49,129
She had started looking down upon Me, "Ah,
Married to some clerk or someone."

116
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:59,960
So the best thing is to play down. Play down
everything. Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis

117
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,830
they say, "oh Mother has giving me such powers.
I can do this, I can do that." This boastfullness

118
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:13,210
is of no use. "I haven't got any powers you
see. I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all. But

119
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:33,070
if you want I can try." So play down as much
as you can. Practice this at home, first practice

120
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:41,899
and then do it. So that is one of the greatest
qualities of communication with others.

121
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:48,749
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita,
if you read it, there's one is very important

122
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:50,269
thing. He says " "krodho'bhijaayate sammohah"
[ The actual Gita quote is - "kaamaat krodho'bhijaayate,

123
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:52,229
Krodhaad bhavati sammohah" - from desire comes
anger, from anger comes delusion (Gita 2:61)].

124
00:21:52,229 --> 00:22:04,729
You see among all the worst things that we
have - according to Him we have six enemies.

125
00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:14,899
But in Gita He started with 'Krodha'. He said
- it starts with Krodha, means anger.

126
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:22,259
If you have anger within you then you are
not a master at all. There's no need for a

127
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:32,289
master to get angry because he can play about.
He can make you dance like this. What is the

128
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:40,330
need to lose your temper? But that mastery
if you don't have, of handling people, then

129
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:48,269
after five/six minutes of talk your voice
starts raising and something starts barking

130
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:55,590
- because that temper is still inside you,
burning.

131
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:07,379
But for a master there should be no temper
- no need. He has started with Krodha, that:

132
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:13,229
with the Krodha all problems start - from
one to another to another to another.

133
00:23:13,229 --> 00:23:27,999
So we should watch out if we are angry people.
Anger comes from Vishuddhi. Starts from liver

134
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:35,609
- Vishnu - but is expressed through Vishuddhi.
The face becomes red, eyes become red. From

135
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:42,330
the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible
things and the whole expression becomes so

136
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,159
different when you are angry.

137
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:53,239
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it
within us? Where is it this anger? Liver?

138
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:55,419
alright, I'll put it right."

139
00:23:55,419 --> 00:24:02,799
So to master it you have to face yourself
clearly. Many people I have seen people say

140
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,929
"Mother you know this lady is such a hot tempered
women, she is so dominating. She does this,

141
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:13,649
she does that." But if you tell her she says,
"No no, I don't do that way. No, no I'm very

142
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:20,639
good." "But how other's saying that?", "I
don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

143
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:29,450
If somebody is saying that then you watch
yourself - do you get into tempers or not?

144
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:35,479
Are you loosing your temper? It's very easy
to make it out then face it. So the trick

145
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:44,669
of the trade is to face yourself and see for
yourself how much you are lacking. So first

146
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:57,149
is humility, which should be genuine, and
secondly is equanimity - no temper. There

147
00:24:57,149 --> 00:25:03,369
is no need to take to temper. At the most
you can say "What are you doing? Why are you

148
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:07,899
doing that way?" Now if you do something,
you know, maybe something I might say which

149
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:16,080
I would not like, so I don't want to say."
Like that - at the most! Up to that point

150
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:25,669
is alright; that you should say that, "I dislike
it", but not to go further with it.

151
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:36,549
If you just stop at a point, then this habit
of getting into temper will go away. This

152
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:43,289
arrogance will go away, which has to go. This
arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

153
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:49,509
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel
very much relieved. Because this anger, once

154
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:57,029
it comes in, reacts, and catches your left
Vishuddi, and you become guilty, you feel

155
00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:05,330
very bad - "Why I said so, I should not have
said this." So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi,

156
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:13,749
means - it's a headache. It goes on accumulating
like a store house there - all your anger,

157
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:21,190
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi
catches, and you know the problems of left

158
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,950
Vishuddhi.

159
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:32,440
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel
guilty but go before the mirror and slap yourself

160
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,909
nicely, twice. Now you get angry with yourself,
"let me get angry!" Then stand before the

161
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:44,909
mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" [Mother pretends
to punch herself! Everybody laughs], like

162
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:53,179
that. In the same manner as you get angry
try to act, you'll never feel guilty. Or maybe

163
00:26:53,179 --> 00:27:02,989
more angry - would be better. So you empty
out your left Vishuddhi. Next time you won't

164
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:09,159
do it. But feeling guilty means you will repeat
and repeat and repeat the same thing.

165
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:17,889
So this temper is expressed by men and women
differently. And I'm very much worried about

166
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:24,960
the women sometimes because they take to water
power - then I'm lost. But those who have

167
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:32,159
ego too much, cry much more. That's the sign,
I've seen. If you say anything to them immediately

168
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:41,359
they start crying, because already the left
Vishuddhi is there, full, like a full balloon

169
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:47,029
and when you touch them it becomes water.

170
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:53,309
But men, their temper is a different style,
as you know very well, that: when they get

171
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:59,999
angry they might fight with each other, box
everyone and then settle down nicely and have

172
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:09,249
something to drink. "Let us have it out!"
you see, they'll say. Take out. But women

173
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:14,549
don't, they keep it there and once they keep
it then it becomes tears, it starts coming

174
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:22,830
down. So, if these are just tears out of joy,
happiness, that's different, or out of feelings

175
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:28,729
for others - but it is not that, but it's
tears just to impress another person that

176
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:42,469
you are very sad or something.

177
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:52,849
So the second trick is how to master your
own temper and the third one is how to master

178
00:28:52,849 --> 00:29:03,969
the temper of others - that's even better.
I don't know if I have told you the trick

179
00:29:03,969 --> 00:29:10,599
of Gagangan Maharaj, when I went to him. He
is a very hot tempered avadhuta, sitting on

180
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:14,960
a tiger, and he's lost his legs, because he
was feeling hot so he was sitting in the water

181
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,309
all the time, so his feet are useless and
he goes on a tiger, they say. I never saw

182
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:26,539
the tiger, of course. But he knows about Me
and all that and he told everyone about Me

183
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:33,139
so I went to see him. And he's supposed to
control the rain. It was quite a steep climb

184
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:40,649
for about one and a half hours. And as soon
as I stepped in, it started raining, raining,

185
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:47,559
raining heavily throughout and he couldn't
stop it, so he felt very challenged! When

186
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:51,979
I went up he was sitting on his own stone
outside the cave, and he was doing like this

187
00:29:51,979 --> 00:29:57,899
[twisting his head], with anger. He didn't
know what to do. I looked at him then I walked

188
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:04,779
into his cave and sat down nicely, then he
came, they brought him. He touched my feet,

189
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:10,509
everything he did and then he said, "You tell
me now - why did you not allow me to stop

190
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:17,559
the water? You got completely drenched. I'm
very angry with this rain I know. But why

191
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:24,509
did you do that? Is it to control my ego?"
I said "No, not at all I never knew you had

192
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:35,369
ego or anything," "Then why?" So - because
I'm a master as you know - I said "You see

193
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:42,340
you are a sanyasi and you brought a sari for
Me, that too of an orange colour, and I would

194
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,710
not take the orange colour sari from you.
Any sari I wouldn't take, because you're a

195
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:54,729
sanyasi. But I had to get drenched to get
the sari, isn't it?" Immediately - he melted

196
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:55,469
away.

197
00:30:55,469 --> 00:31:10,009
But I had to be the master. First of all how
to melt him and secondly the master of his

198
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:20,190
mind. This is the subtler part of it. You
can be a master of a person. Like that you

199
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:27,909
can know what he has done for you, what he
has prepared for you, what is coming for you.

200
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:34,139
I wouldn't say that you'd know all the whole
future. But if you try just to know about

201
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:42,149
a person - you can know everything about that
person, very simple. So first try to understand

202
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:46,309
a person.

203
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:55,269
My father had lots of tricks with him, I know,
and a very humorous person. And one day My

204
00:31:55,269 --> 00:32:02,639
brother told me, Babamama, that he has a friend
who sings very well. So I asked my father

205
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:08,679
"How does he sing?" "Oh, he is very courageous,"
he said. I said "Why?" "He sings whether he

206
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:15,889
knows or not - that's the trouble!" What an
exact description he gave Me of this gentleman!

207
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:21,749
"He's very courageous you see. He doesn't
know but he sings - quite alright, so he's

208
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:27,659
very courageous." I mean, he didn't say anything
against him - he said "He's courageous" - but

209
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:31,149
he gave Me the complete picture of the gentleman
that: "You have to be careful you see, he

210
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:36,269
might start singing in a funny way, you shouldn't
laugh." And, all that came in that 'courageous'

211
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:37,479
word.

212
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:50,159
In the same way, if you study someone then
you will just describe that person in an interesting

213
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,119
way, and you will not feel that this person
has these bad habits or those bad habits or

214
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:02,429
this is wrong with him, that is wrong, but
you'll describe - it's part of that person.

215
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:11,369
It's a way of knowing a person in totality
with all his defects, with all his qualities,

216
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:17,080
with everything and accepting that person
as he is.

217
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:25,369
If that mastery you can have. Now how will
you have? If your attention is not on his

218
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:34,960
qualities you'll only know his bad things.
And if you know his qualities then bad things

219
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,710
will be there, a little bit, but they'll just
be adding a little masala to his character.

220
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:51,489
You'll feel "ahhhh, that's it, you see, he
is a little bit like that." Little additional

221
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:58,200
swara (musical note) is added to his character.
And you wouldn't mind it so much, such a person.

222
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,379
You'll really enjoy.

223
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:06,719
Like my son-in-law is very fond of dogs and
his wife says, "no dog in the house," it's

224
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:12,090
a flat. So there is a fight between them for
the dog. So Prabhat said "You never meet me,"

225
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:19,560
I said "This is not proper but next time I
have decided to be a dog," Immediately he

226
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,780
took the point, you see.

227
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:29,880
So the way you talk to a person you can suggest
to him what is so special about that person

228
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:40,370
or the defects of that person. But you need
not say directly something to him. If you

229
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:52,919
say indirectly, in such a humorous manner
that the person will understand. So in communication

230
00:34:52,919 --> 00:35:02,270
with others you have to be a very humorous
person. But mostly I've seen people have humour

231
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:08,570
if somebody cannot walk straight. If a physical
problem is there they'll laugh. If he has

232
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:15,520
not properly made his hair then they will
laugh. On some sort of a very superficial

233
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,770
thing they laugh. This is not humorous. This
is some sort of a criticism in laughter. Or

234
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:32,380
some people have a humour like this that they
say sarcastic things, that's no good. You

235
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:38,230
say one word to somebody, sarcastic; you think
you are brilliant, but you are lost forever

236
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:43,400
for that person. That person will remember
"He said such a such things to me."

237
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:50,410
So sarcasm is against you completely; against
Sahaja Yoga. If you have to say something,

238
00:35:50,410 --> 00:36:02,460
say it in such a manner that it doesn't hurt
the person, and the person enjoys that subtle

239
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:16,100
humour and understands also that "This is
the problem with me". Now in a humorous way,

240
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:22,880
if I have to tell something to you - I need
not tell you directly, "You are like this,

241
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:31,360
you are like that," but I'll say, "There was
one crow which came to my house..." and, like

242
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,290
that, I can transfer all your qualities to
that crow and describe to you and say that,

243
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:43,400
"This crow did like this and did that." Immediately
you'll start thinking, "Is it about me Mother

244
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,860
was saying or about the crow?"

245
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:55,140
So transfer it to somebody else. Transfer
it to somebody else, that's the best way.

246
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:00,010
For example, if you want to say that: all
the names of the people who are coming to

247
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:07,130
the puja should be there at the right time.
So now, this time, Americans [are hosting].

248
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,040
Alright, "Americans have sent the word..."
- they have not - "...have sent the word that

249
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:19,080
all the names should be there." No harm telling
such lies, no harm. So that people will not

250
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,490
put it on you, they'll not be angry with you.
At the most they'll be angry with the Americans

251
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:33,710
- doesn't matter, for the time being. So transfer
it. And this transference is 'astantar' as

252
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:42,240
they call it. To transfer from one hand to
another hand, Shri Krishna was an expert.

253
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:52,250
There is a story about Him. He is called as
Ranchordas, means He ran away from the battlefield.

254
00:37:52,250 --> 00:38:01,400
He doesn't mind "I ran away, so what?" The
reason was like this: there was a very bad

255
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:10,610
rakshasa who had all kinds of boons from Brahmadeva
and Shri Krishna didn't know how to overcome

256
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:16,510
that, nobody knew, and He was killing so many
people. So He thought of a trick, transfer

257
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:26,760
it to somebody else. He knew of another great
yogi you see, special type, who has meditated

258
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:36,980
and taken a boon from the same Brahmadeva
that: "If I'm sleeping and anybody disturbs

259
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:44,260
my sleep and, if I open my eyes and look at
that person, that person should become ashes

260
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,010
- bhasma (ashes)."

261
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:54,210
So Shri Krishna thought of Him, "Better transfer
the job from me to Him." So He started running

262
00:38:54,210 --> 00:39:02,960
away from the field. So this Rakshasa also
followed Him. Then Shri Krishna stealthily

263
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:16,100
went into the cave of this avadhuta, and put
His own shawl on top of Him, covered Him,

264
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:23,450
and hid himself in the cave. Now this Rakshasa
came here, he thought this was Shri Krishna

265
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:28,730
who was sleeping, "Ahhh now you are tired,
you are sleeping. Now I'm going to see how

266
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:35,640
you can save yourself." And he started waking
[him] up. This avadhuta got up and looked

267
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,520
at him and he became bhasma.

268
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:52,530
So transfer your jobs to a more capable (Shri
Mataji laughs) person who can do this better,

269
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:57,430
than taking upon yourself straight-forward,
going, "Alright,come long, I'll fight with

270
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:06,750
you" - you cannot win. It's a guerrilla warfare
as you call it. Transfer it, and you can transfer

271
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:14,080
it to somebody, you can make friends with
that person, pamper his ego; do what you like.

272
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:22,200
But the main point is that you should get
rid of the ills, the bad, the rakshasas. So

273
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,960
you can transfer it to anyone.

274
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:46,890
And so many tricks He played. In the Mahabharata,
Bhishma had a blessing that, unless and until

275
00:40:46,890 --> 00:41:04,760
he wants to die, nobody can kill him. So Shri
Krishna decided that He should use some tricks.

276
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:14,730
So He told Arjuna that you put him...He told
Arjuna not himself; He was just doing the

277
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:27,150
chariot drivers job - Sarathi. So Krishna
told him that you just make him sleep on the

278
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:38,130
arrows, let His body be on the arrows and
he has to decide that he will die. But Dronacharya

279
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:47,740
was a great guru, also of Arjuna, who was
siding with Kauravas. Now how can you kill

280
00:41:47,740 --> 00:42:02,830
this Dhronacharya, big problem. Because you
see, he knew all the tricks of archery. How

281
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:12,260
are you going to save them? Because archery
is such a thing that he was the master of

282
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:17,700
archery, while Arjuna was his disciple.

283
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:46,520
So how to stop him, answering back the arrows
of Arjuna? How to do that, that he doesn't

284
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:57,390
answer back? Because he was a master. So Krishna
organized it, in a very special way. He got

285
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:05,350
a Shikhandi, a eunuch. What is the advantage
of having a eunuch? Of course it's a big story

286
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:15,220
how they became Shikhandi. But He got him
in front of Arjuna. A eunuch in India is regarded

287
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:31,170
as a woman, so Dhronacharya said, "I cannot
kill a woman," and that's how He killed Dhronacharya.

288
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:40,380
So [He played] these tricks, because to get
rid of ill is the main thing. To get rid of

289
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:45,810
the ill - if you are not capable - you better
tell somebody else to get rid. Because that

290
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:53,430
is very important - to get rid of the evil
- and if you can transfer this to somebody

291
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:58,270
else who is more capable, in your own humility,
you'll do much better than to directly attack

292
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:05,530
that person. That's Tomfoolery. No use.

293
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:13,430
So this was the trick of Shri Krishna throughout,
if you have seen Mahabharata. Shri Krishna

294
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:21,530
told Arjuna that, "Either you can the have
all of My army or you can have Me." Same He

295
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:28,930
told to the Kauravas. The Kauravas said, "We'll
have your army." But he (Arjuna) said, "You

296
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,700
will be mine, Krishna." He said "You'll be
on our side." But He said, "No, I'll be just

297
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:41,000
on the chariot. I'll not hold any weapon."
But He is a master of tricks. He does not

298
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,350
need any weapons with Him. Without weapons
also He can do everything. So Arjuna said,

299
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:53,680
"alright, You be my chariot driver," and He
was there.

300
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:01,650
Because Shri Krishna knew about each and every
thing, mostly He used to smile. Now, if somebody's

301
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:09,910
telling Me something, sometimes you will find
I also smile, but I try to control because

302
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:16,210
I don't want them to see. But I know what
they are doing, what they're up to, what is

303
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:22,050
their trick. Because you are such a trick
master you know all the tricks and you know

304
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:28,870
what they are playing with you. So you just
smile about it, just to smile in a very sweet

305
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:36,100
way, "ahhh, that's it. ahh ,of course, of
course, what you say is true, no doubt." But,

306
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:43,860
by this kind of thing, you'll be surprised,
your communications will improve very much

307
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,250
with others.

308
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:51,700
Now some people I've seen in Sahaja Yoga - very
common, very common, "Mother, they came and

309
00:45:51,700 --> 00:46:00,590
told me, our leader told me, that you are
bhootish. What is bhootish?" Another one says,

310
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:06,390
"But he told me that you are a bhoot," - alright.
And somebody says, "Mother no he told me that

311
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:14,470
you have got a bhoot in you. Now what are
these three categories? Tell us." Why to tell

312
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:21,010
anybody you are bhootish or anything? There's
no need. If you know how to correct it, just

313
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:28,300
say "left Swadisthana" and correct it. Take
it out. Ask him, if he had any guru or anything.

314
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:33,990
Alright, if the person is good natured and
a good person then it's even more important.

315
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:38,490
You should say "It's nothing, you see, it's
just a badha from outside. We'll have to take

316
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:47,390
it out." But a person who has got agnya and
all these things, plus that he has got this

317
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:52,630
left Swadisthana, then, of course, you should
say, "Baba, we cannot help you," because you

318
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:57,390
know he is cunning. What's the use of playing
with that?

319
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:05,460
But in Sahaja Yoga we forget. Anybody who
comes "Alright, come along, come along, come

320
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:13,890
along." Everybody is not capable of Sahaja
Yoga, one has to know that. Not the whole

321
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:24,990
world. Sahaja Yoga can only be given to people
who are deserving, who are seekers and who

322
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:32,980
are courageous - viras. It's not meant for
ordinary people. So we open our door to everyone

323
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:38,820
and all such people walk in and then we work
very hard on them, do all kinds of things,

324
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:49,110
and we find that they create problems for
us. So first, only deal with people who are

325
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:56,000
simple, as Shri Krishna dealt with Gopas and
Gopis; and then we can see, in a collective

326
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:04,750
way, if we can face somebody who's complicated.
But no use transforming Hitler or Rajneesh,

327
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,840
not possible.

328
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:12,870
So one should not try to do impossible tasks
in Sahaja Yoga, which Shri Krishna has shown

329
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:23,610
in His own character by avoiding things which
He didn't want to do - no. And He did it because

330
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:31,210
He was such a master. Of course, for Him,
it was not necessary to face himself to master

331
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:39,050
himself, because He knew himself, He is the
Ishwara of yoga, He knew everything. When

332
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:44,080
you know everything there is no need for you
to master, what are you going to master? On

333
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:50,630
the contrary you sometimes get frightened
of yourself, that you know so much.

334
00:48:50,630 --> 00:49:00,550
So, best is that, when we are dealing as human
beings in Sahaja Yoga, we have to know ourselves

335
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:07,680
very well - "Now oh that's my speciality."
In that you have to see: "How I face myself

336
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:19,940
all the time? Why do I say such a thing? What
is lurking in my mind?" Negativity is something

337
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,410
to be seen very clearly within yourself.

338
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:28,500
As I must have told you so many examples that
the western negativity is like this that,

339
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:39,290
their minds are all the time labor saving
devices. They don't like to work anyway. For

340
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:49,380
example, you tell them "You go and telephone
to someone." Immediately they will tell you

341
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:54,370
ten explanations: he may not be there, his
wife will shout, he might have gone to work,

342
00:49:54,370 --> 00:50:07,050
it's ten o'clock, this, that. But if you telephone
he's there, but they won't telephone. Hundred

343
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:15,260
excuses. Now new excuses have started: "the
computer was not working, fax was not working."

344
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:23,510
Except for your brain everything works. But
the other way around it is: your brain is

345
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:29,670
not working and everything is not working.
"The lights were not working." I mean, whatever

346
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:41,260
it is. But you must learn, "Why can't I find
the solution? I must do something."

347
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:48,980
Like I have told you, the tip of a root - how
it manages to go round and round and seek

348
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:54,460
the source of water. In the same way, are
we doing something about it? Alright, if this

349
00:50:54,460 --> 00:51:00,350
is not available, do that, if that is not
available do this. Out of nothing you can

350
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:06,520
do so many things. But if you want to find
out all the time "That cannot be done, that

351
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:15,390
cannot be done". [That was] not [the case]
with Shri Krishna! After all He was the incarnation

352
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:19,450
of Virata, the Master of Masters we should
say.

353
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:25,660
Like when Draupadi was in trouble - Draupadi
was actually Vishnumaya His sister - She thought

354
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:32,750
of Shri Krishna. She was holding onto her
sari, when it was pulled out by Duryodhana.

355
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:39,140
And She was holding it like this (with Her
teeth). "Kri", She wanted to say "Krishna"

356
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:48,820
but She thought, "If I say 'shna' it will
fall down." So She was holding on. As soon

357
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:59,900
as She dropped it, "shna", sari dropped out
(of Her mouth), then it's described, about

358
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:10,240
Shri Krishna, "Dwarika me shora bhayo, shor
bhayo bhare. Shankha chakra gadaa padma, Garuda

359
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,580
laysidhare." [Meaning:] that sound went into
Dwarika. Now where is Dwarika and where is

360
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:25,980
Hastinapur - at least a distance of two thousands
miles [apart]. But the sound went through

361
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:35,060
Chaitanya and made a big sound there; and
"Shankha Chakra Gadaa Padma". Shankha, Chakra

362
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:43,590
Gadaa, Padma are the weapons (of Vishnu) as
you know. All of them He took and came on

363
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:50,390
His Garuda to save the chastity of His sister
- immediately, spontaneously, that moment.

364
00:52:50,390 --> 00:53:00,170
He could have said, "Alright let it be, let
one sari come out then I'll go later."

365
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:08,230
I'm sure He must have stolen My saris which
you give for My Pujas, which are too many!

366
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:16,540
That's what I feel, that, from where did He
get all these saris to give to Her? Must be

367
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:22,470
from My own storage I'm sure, and that's why
you are giving Me so many saris, so that He

368
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:34,970
can save the chastity of many women. All this
is so related, so connected, so one, so united.

369
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:41,840
There's such a big drama going on but you
can't see it.

370
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:53,100
But if you believe in yourself and if you
really believe that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

371
00:53:53,100 --> 00:54:07,050
that: what are your qualities, what you are,
what's your value is, then I'm sure you can

372
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:13,950
become masters. But first of all we have no
value of our realization. We do not know what

373
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:19,610
we are capable of, what we can do. You still
think, "oh, I was such an ordinary person,

374
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:27,610
Mother has given me realization. I have never
been to university." Nobody has been to university.

375
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:35,230
I mean, if you see, Rama never went to any
university, Krishna never went into university,

376
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:41,960
Christ never went to any university - an ordinary
man, a son of a carpenter.

377
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:47,490
But you are realized souls but you don't realize
your worth and value. Once you realize it,

378
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:53,340
you will just smile at everything. Because
you don't know you are sitting on top of the

379
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:59,150
world. Once you know that - only then your
mastery will work. Otherwise imagine a master

380
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:07,640
sitting under the foot of a disciple, what
will it look like? But it's not that you dominate

381
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:19,670
but you are in charge, absolutely in charge.
You know everything, you know how to handle,

382
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:23,730
you know how to manage. This is the mastery
you have to get. This is possible, absolutely

383
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:28,270
possible, for all of you to do it. But the
first and foremost thing you have to know

384
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:31,820
is that we have to master ourselves.

385
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:45,090
But then immediately people say "Mother it's
the most difficult to master yourself." I

386
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:48,760
can't understand this. Why not? You try to
master everyone, why can't you master yourself?

387
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:59,810
Yourself is with you, you are with yourself,
it's your own, it's your own property. You

388
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:05,820
can correct the property of others, why can't
you correct your own property? It should be

389
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:11,300
the easiest thing to do but you're not sure
that this is your own, you do not know that

390
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:19,880
you are capable, but you are and now you have
Self-knowledge, so why should you not do it?

391
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,540
Why should you not try to watch yourself and
see for yourself? And then you will know that

392
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:35,470
you know all the tricks, the yukti. I don't
have to tell you "do this, do that," nothing!

393
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,970
You yourself will know "ha, come along!"

394
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:45,640
We know so many things, little little things,
about ordinary material things: something's

395
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:54,520
falling? Alright - put some support to it.
This is happening? Put it that way. But in

396
00:56:54,520 --> 00:57:05,570
spiritual life it's the easiest thing because
you are in the ocean of knowledge. But if

397
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:11,540
you do not know that you are, in the ocean
of knowledge, you will not know the tricks,

398
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:17,510
of dealing with others. Because the main purpose
of our communication is to emancipate the

399
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:23,660
whole world, to emancipate them. To bring
them out of their ignorance.

400
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:32,730
So for that we have to develop this mastery
and not to get lost into nonsensical things

401
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:39,280
but this mastery has to be developed. For
that, meditation early in the morning is required

402
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:48,810
- to begin with. And then facing yourself
all the time, "Why did I say such a thing?"

403
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:57,510
"Aahhhh must be this. This is the word I picked
up from that person." So when you start facing

404
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:05,200
yourself, you will be surprised that you are
trying to avoid the reality and just using

405
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:15,690
your mind. See there, as I say, that this
mind cheats you and tells you, "all right,

406
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,710
forget it".

407
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:30,580
And the last, but not the least, is that Shri
Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama.

408
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:42,010
He creates drama, He acts in the drama, and
He's the spectator also. In these three forms

409
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:50,960
you should see yourself. You create the drama
of yourself, "aha this one now, see now, how

410
00:58:50,960 --> 00:59:00,810
I'm acting here!" Then you become the spectator
also. Become the spectator of your own dramas,

411
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:09,780
then you will realize what you are doing,
how you are working out everything. Then the

412
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:18,560
deception that we have, all the time, against
ourselves, will just run away. Because if

413
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:25,790
an artist knows he's the spectator, if the
one who is acting knows he is the spectator,

414
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:35,619
he can never deceive himself, because He knows
this is acting. So this self-deception is

415
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:37,320
the one [that] one should try to avoid - "let
me face it."

416
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,570
But also there is another way out, people
find out. I mean, there are ways and ways.

417
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:47,890
Like you tell somebody, "why didn't you write
a letter?" "I know!" 'I know' means what?

418
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:57,760
"But don't you think you should have written
a letter to that person, who has done so much

419
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:04,390
for you?" "I know." "But don't you think it's
very bad and cruel on your part not to have

420
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:12,380
written the letter?" "I know." 'I know' means
what? "I know I'm bad. I know I have been

421
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:19,740
stupid. I know I should not have done it.
But I know also that." So what next? Because

422
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:25,140
they think that if they have confessed that
"I know," [it's] finished!

423
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:31,040
So this is a new escape which was not [there]
at the time of Shri Krishna, it's a new modern

424
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:37,660
one, where people say "I know, alright so
what?" "Ohhh alright I'm a sinner so what?"

425
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:44,270
This is the second side of it. First of all
"I know that I'm a sinner" and second is a

426
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:48,760
higher state is that: "so what, what's wrong?"

427
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:57,140
So this is how the derailment starts and one
goes from one to another. If I know something

428
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:07,720
then why shouldn't I correct myself? That's
what it should be. "I know I'm like that I

429
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:15,000
know it." If you know then you should also
know the trick - how to get rid of it. Because

430
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:22,560
you are detached from that personality about
which you know, you can correct yourself.

431
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:29,880
This is what yoga is, where all your attention
is one with the Divine and you are so detached

432
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:42,590
that you can see it. The attachment to all
the things are finished and now the force

433
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:50,290
that is coming to you is acting through you
and acting on these attachments also.

434
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:59,369
The situation changes, absolutely, in Sahaja
Yoga in a very different way, and if there

435
01:01:59,369 --> 01:02:05,160
is one bad Sahaja Yogi who comes in, either
he's thrown out or he has to be alright. It's

436
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:11,170
the other way around. Anyone who is a bad
Sahaja Yogi, if he comes in Sahaja Yoga, then

437
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:14,369
he has to be corrected, otherwise thrown out.

438
01:02:14,369 --> 01:02:21,780
It is a I think a more evolved state now than
it was at the time of Shri Krishna, because

439
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:31,760
He talked only to one - Arjuna. Now I'm talking
to thousands - this knowledge. That time He

440
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:38,109
just talked about it at the time of war. I'm
talking at the time of peace. And it's much

441
01:02:38,109 --> 01:02:41,859
more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give
him realization. But you have got the realization,

442
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:50,400
you've got the knowledge, you know everything.
You have all the subtle ideas.

443
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:56,790
So this is what it is today, as it is, the
situation, that: you have become part and

444
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:01,990
parcel of Virata already. You have not seen
the Virata (as Arjuna did), but you are part

445
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:12,140
and parcel of it. You are not watching it,
you are inside it. So that anymore of not

446
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:17,859
watching yourself, only thing will be that,
you'll be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga. Or else

447
01:03:17,859 --> 01:03:26,790
you better watch yourself and correct yourself
and be one with the body of the Virata.

448
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:38,859
This is the sign of a Yogeshwara, and that's
how you have to be, in a mood which is very

449
01:03:38,859 --> 01:03:47,640
smiling, knowing everything and not sarcastic,
but [with a] very paternal smile, very loving,

450
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:54,130
affectionate smile, that you should have for
all the other people and immediately they'll

451
01:03:54,130 --> 01:04:00,520
recognize. I have seen small children are
like that. They are extremely patronising

452
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,200
sometimes, you know. They see their parents
and

453
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:08,640
this and that. So they come and tell you that,
"don't worry everything will be all right,

454
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:17,440
after all God is there to look after you."
And they can be extremely, extremely loving

455
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,740
and kind and

456
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:21,420
the way they talk they will neutralize the
whole thing.

457
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,400
So we have to learn a lot

458
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,600
from our children, from all the little babies
that we have

459
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:36,080
and 
that we ourselves should have that Ganesha
principal within us, with innocence we should

460
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:42,640
work it out. Innocence is the most intelligent
thing and most effective thing. So I would

461
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:49,600
request you, all of you, to face yourself
and don't hate yourself but correct yourself,

462
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,940
respect yourself and try to evolve your own
glory.

463
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:57,600
May God bless you.
