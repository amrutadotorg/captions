00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:10.660
He was son of God and He came on this Earth
with a very great message that you are to

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.479
be resurrected.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:24.070
It is not only that you have to maintain yourself,
and you don’t eat this and don’t do that

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:32.999
and all those Ten Commandments, but He came
to give us a message of our rebirth.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:40.030
We are to be born again; not by any just a
ritual or some sort of a ceremony we go through,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:49.370
but there has to be something living that
has to take place.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.810
He has always talked about [the] living God.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.940
So something living must happen and what happens
when it is something living?

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.299
When it is something living we start finding
the transformation taking place.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.839
For example: you sow a seed and the living
process starts; the tree starts transforming

00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:22.460
into the root and a shoot; and then the shoot
start transforming itself into leaves and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.669
then into fruits.

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:34.210
It’s not static: not that we take one piece
from here and keep it there and it is transformed,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:46.019
but there is something that happens within,
something very spontaneous which brings forth

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:52.509
this transformation and you see it with your
own eyes.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.780
And this transformation has to take place
within you.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:05.829
Now, in a case as I told you of Cathy or someone
like that one can say all right you must have

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.050
consoled or you give her love and this and
that she be consoled, but that’s not the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.050
point.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:21.260
As I told you there are many people who have
got everything, still they are unhappy.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.360
And if you ask them they will say, “No,
we don’t know.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.450
We are not happy.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.450
We don’t feel happy.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.590
There’s no joy in our lives.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.660
We have lost our heart."

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.060
They can’t explain but it is there.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.480
What have they lost?

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:53.640
The time has come for the whole world to know
their Spirit.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.029
This is the time which is prophesised even
by William Blake where he describes England

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.370
is the Jerusalem.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.870
The time has come for you to know your Spirit.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.500
That has to happen.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.740
It’s not a thing by which I tell you, you
stand on your heads or hold your nose or start

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.980
taking some names, like a one track mind going
on chanting some names like madcaps.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:32.590
It’s not that, but something that must happen
within yourself and that must transform you.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:41.110
Of course, one must understand [that] if it
is a living process, you cannot pay for it.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.912
How can you pay for a seed to sprout?

00:03:45.912 --> 00:03:51.060
The seed doesn’t understand; the living
process doesn’t understand money.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.230
It’s the dead work of human beings.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.240
How can you organise it also?

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.240
You cannot! It’s spontaneous.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.240
There is no technique.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240
It’s all built-in.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.550
The technique is built: in the little seed
that you see, the whole technique of its growth

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.550
is built-in.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.480
The technique is built-in and all its maps,
how it is going to be, what tree it is going

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:23.060
to be, how the tree is going to grow, in what
height, in what thickness, everything is inside

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.419
that seed.

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:34.250
In the same way it is a spontaneous thing,
which has to happen within you and if it is

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.429
so we have to find out.

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:41.750
That’s how the search started: people went
to India, went all over the places to find

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.750
out.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.130
They thought we cannot find the solution here
let us go up there.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:54.530
It has to be that way, because if you grow
too much outside you have to find out your

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.910
roots.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:04.130
Because you develop that fear that you may
not be able to sustain this outward growth

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:13.290
unless and until you find out the depth or
the source on which this is to be sustained.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.850
So people started searching and searching.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:24.840
I have met many of them, many thousands, and
I find they were misled many a times.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.949
They were really misled.

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:34.560
They were so anxious to get to it that whatever
somebody said they just accepted blindfolded.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.000
People asked for money, all right take money.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.459
They starved themselves, collected money and
gave this to these swindlers and these cheats

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:49.679
and thugs.

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:57.269
How can anybody exchange money for the Spirit?

00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:00.989
It’s absurd! It’s illogical.

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:08.870
But we understand money to such a great extent,
I was amazed, that we think that Spirit can

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:16.679
be bought by giving some money to someone,
or some sort of a material thing.

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:25.110
Logically all these things have to be understood.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:34.259
Now to say that logically you cannot understand
God, is wrong.

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.010
You can, logically; not rationally but logically.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.679
There’s a difference between the two.

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:43.525
For example, if you have not come to London,
you have not seen London, I have not been

00:06:43.525 --> 00:06:45.980
to Newbury, I did not know it’s a beautiful
place like this, then I cannot understand

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.980
it.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:58.039
But if I have come here, then I see with my
own eyes, “Yes it is so."

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:03.370
Then I have to say, “Yes I have seen it.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.549
It’s so."

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:09.289
I have seen it, I have felt it.

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:11.160
I know it is so.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.829
Then it becomes, the whole thing becomes logical.

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:17.359
But rationally if I sit in India somewhere
in the corner and think of Newbury, “Now

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:21.660
I am going to Newbury."

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:30.759
Just putting my wings of imagination outside:
will I come to Newbury?

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:40.889
But if I come, this is very important to understand,
if I come here, actually I come here, in person,

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:48.159
then I know the place and I know the people
of Newbury and I know it.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:53.570
That means it has to be an actualisation.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:08:00.129
If it is not an actualisation then whatever
you decide about it, this way or that, way

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:03.660
is absolutely illogical, because you have
not been there; very simple as that.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.940
Some people say, “We believe in God."

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.549
Some people say, “We don’t believe in
God."

00:08:08.549 --> 00:08:14.479
Both ways, whatever they are saying, they
are doing it I don’t know how.

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:21.440
If they believe in God, maybe it’s innately
built in us to believe in God.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:29.940
But even they don’t believe in God, it’s
all right, because they don’t understand;

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.970
they have not been there.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:46.670
But you must keep yourself open: open to understand
that if something has to happen to us, which

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:54.290
is a living process, some transformation has
to take place within us.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:09:01.640
It has to be an actualisation, not a lecture
to you or a sermon to you, or some sort of

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.370
a service and then you disperse.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:14.080
You must start feeling some transformation
coming within.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:21.150
In the Bible itself, it is written: “I will
appear before you like tongues of flames."

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:28.940
Nobody can explain what it is like; they cannot.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:41.590
It is written that: “The Tree of Life will
be fed by the water of life."

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.590
It’s a prophecy.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.920
Now what is Tree of Life?

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.450
Where is it?

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.990
Where does it exist within us?

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.500
Nobody has tried to find out.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.040
They say, “You must have faith."

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.170
“Yes, whatever is said is true.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.170
You must have faith."

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:08.930
But if you have faith, after some time you
will be disillusioned.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.620
That’s blind, absolutely blind.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:19.450
Because where is that Tree of Life, you have
not seen, felt or it has not manifested.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:28.360
For this we can refer to other scriptures
also, specially in India where people have

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.750
been more meditative.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:39.770
As you have been more outward and seeking
[the] overpowering of matter, in India people

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:44.760
tried to find out what’s happening within.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.760
I mean there are genuine people also, not
all are thugs.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.460
They are not in the market.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.600
They are hiding themselves somewhere in Himalayas
and all these places.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:04.670
But in the sixth century only, we have the
description of The Tree of Life.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.810
And the Tree of Life is shown here as you
see.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:17.890
Now you are not to have blind faith in what
I am saying, there’s no need.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.880
But you should not also deny me.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:30.060
You should try to understand what I am saying
and see for yourself [if] it works out or

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.060
not.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.680
If it does not work out we give another chance
to you.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:45.930
Because you must know that I have come here
to give you something, not take anything from

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:46.930
you.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.050
I cannot take, that’s my nature.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.620
That’s how God has made me.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.870
It’s something funny, but I cannot take
anything.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:07.300
If I have come to give you then there’s
nothing selling, there’s no shop.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:15.150
Try! If you should be open it would help you
better to understand what I am trying to tell

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.150
you.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:27.200
Here now, you see the Tree of Life (chakra
chart) and when this Tree of Life is given

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.640
the water of life then what happens?

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.890
How the nourishment reaches?

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.370
And how it starts activating?

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:43.960
It is as simple as connecting this machine
to the mains.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:53.060
Any machine, say a television is there, once
it is connected to the mains you can see the

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.700
manifestation of the machine very clearly.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:02.010
And you are amazed [that] for a villager,
if you show, that he is surprised, and he

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.740
cannot understand how this is happening, how
are these pictures coming, from where these

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.770
music is coming, how these colours have been
shown.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.960
He can’t understand it.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:28.610
In the same way, once your machine becomes
connected, connected, with the Divine you

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:34.690
start finding Its manifestation.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:45.460
Now in this picture we have shown you here
the subtle being that exists within us: just

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.150
like a structure of a seed you can say.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:55.780
As in the seed there is a primule of the germinating
power.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:12.130
In the same way, in that triangular bone is
the power which is going to give us rebirth.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.920
This is your own.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:20.940
This is your Mother who is going to give you
your rebirth.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.220
She exists in all of us.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.280
She is dormant, but She knows everything about
you.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.060
She is like a tape recorder.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.990
She knows all your past and She knows your
seeking and She knows you value.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:42.500
She knows your defects and She knows what
mistakes you have committed, who has troubled

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.760
you and who has looted you, and who has deceived
you.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.030
She knows everything.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.730
But She is dormant.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:57.390
She lies there in a dormant stage and She
is called as ‘Kundalini’ in the Sanskrit

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:58.390
language.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:04.270
Kundalini is the word [which] comes from the
coiled.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.570
The word ‘Kundalini’ means ‘the coil’.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:15.300
And She is in three and a half coils, coiled
together, and just like, they call it like

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.050
a serpent, She is lying down there.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:29.170
But you have seen mostly, most of the energies
are kept in a coil, because if any chord has

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.690
to be used we put it in a coil always.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.510
The one end has to come out so it is kept
coiled up there.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:44.200
Why this three and half is also a big mathematics
which, of course later on, you can find out

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.650
what is the meaning of this three and half
coils.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:59.200
Just now, I will just give you a very, very
short description, an outline, about this

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.980
power that resides within us.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.970
It resides in the triangular bone called as
sacrum.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:13.760
That is at the back of us, our backbone, at
the lowest point.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.370
You can see there is a triangular bone behind.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.820
Now see this is called as sacrum.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.930
Sacrum means ‘sacred bone’.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:28.310
It has been found out that when the human
body burns this bone does not burn.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.010
That is why they call it sacrum long time
back.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.490
But the reason is the Kundalini is inside
that bone.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:46.590
Now above that, you find there are six centres:
one, two, three, four, five and six.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:51.150
And the lowest one is below that.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:17:01.190
All these centres are subtle centres which
manifest outside our plexuses, the physical

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.620
plexuses that we know of.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:17.010
These centres exist as energy pockets and
they supply the two lines: you see the blue

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.860
and the yellow line.

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:31.270
They try to balance and arrange the power
to flow into these two channels.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:41.650
These two channels represent within us, on
the left hand side, the one which comes as

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:54.110
the blue line which you see comes actually
from the right side on top and comes down

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:58.070
and meets the first centre there.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:05.400
This is the line of Ida channel which controls
our emotional line.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:12.590
It controls our past and is also called as
moon line.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:18.900
It is, it represents our desiring power, our
desiring power.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:30.670
The another line you see is the yellow line
which represents our power of action, through

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.010
which we act.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:37.820
First we desire, we want to have something
and then we act.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:48.040
So this line represents your physical and
mental being which goes in the front side

00:18:48.040 --> 00:19:01.560
and the left side of the brain and forms the
ego, which is a by-product of our activities

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.020
for our actions.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:13.990
The first power of desire or the emotional
power, when it acts, for example say Cathy

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:20.750
was emotionally disturbed: her this power
was acting too much and was using all the

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:27.980
power from all the body and was creating a
superego there.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:38.690
So actually on the left hand side and in the
front is the ego and on the right hand side

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:48.020
and the back is the superego, covering our
limbic area which is in the brain above this

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.020
centre.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:56.370
This centre, Agnya, is the centre of Christ.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:57.940
Christ resides there.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.130
People say Christ is within us.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.540
Where is He?

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.700
Which part?

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.280
Where is He placed?

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.140
He is placed in this centre.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.890
Now when I say that He is placed in there,
we can prove it.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:16.480
It can easily proved, because when the Kundalini
rises and if She stops at that centre — which

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:23.430
you can see and feel it, that it has stopped
there — you have to take the name of Christ

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.650
and request Him that, “Please allow the
Kundalini to pass."

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:34.100
If He is awakened, of course, that can only
be done by a person who is a realised-soul.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:41.660
Any Dick, Tom, Harry cannot do it: you cannot
call Christ or anyone because what is the

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.790
right you have got?

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:49.560
There has to be a protocol, a connection by
which you can call Him.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:58.130
Any such person when he calls Christ, He can
be awakened and the Kundalini rises from there:

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:04.990
that’s how you know this is the centre of
Christ.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:09.260
What is the mantra of this centre?

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.500
Surprisingly, it is our, Lord’s prayer.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.670
It’s the mantra.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:20.950
It’s not only the Lord’s prayer, it’s
a mantra for this centre.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:25.390
And the weapon of Christ is forgiveness.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:30.760
When the Kundalini stops here, that means
you think too much.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:39.490
Imagine all the Christians, or I can say the
Christian nations, think too much.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.260
It’s surprising! We should not think at
all.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.480
I mean Christ has done that for us.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.700
We are not supposed to think.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.290
But we think about everything, we plan about
everything.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.050
We are mad with thinking.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.860
I mean, it grows like a mad weed.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:22:01.220
I was in Switzerland, there was a doctor who
came to see me and he said, “Mother, you

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:08.530
can cut my neck or you can break my teeth,
do what you like but stop my thinking!”

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:12.450
He just could not stop thinking.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:19.580
What is the solution for this thinking in
Sahaja Yoga is you have to forgive.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.060
You have to forgive.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:26.710
If you forgive, then this centre can be resolved.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:34.450
But forgiveness is just a myth, because what
are you doing?

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:41.910
If you are troubled by another person, if
you do not forgive that person, that person

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:42.910
is successful.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:49.390
Because you go on worrying about it, crying
about it, weeping about it, and whatever he

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:55.760
wanted to trouble you for, you are just a
complete proof of it.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.460
So forgiveness means what?

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:03.270
What you are doing is to get rid of his power
over you.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:09.670
And this is what Christ has said that, “Forgive”
and the greatest thing He did on the cross

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.520
was to say that, “Forgive."

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:20.920
Because these people really committed the
real crime of crucifying the Son of God.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.480
But still He said, “Forgive for they do
not know what they are doing”.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:31.790
They do not know what they are doing, that
He was the Son of God.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:37.470
It was impossible for people to believe Son
of God.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.590
Imagine! Is He Son of God?

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:44.530
What makes Him that?

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.460
His resurrection proved it.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:53.380
Till then nobody believed Him.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.200
His disciples never believed Him.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:05.960
He looked like a very ordinary person, carpenter’s
son, having hardly two robes to wear, living

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.310
in a very poor condition.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:16.530
What made Him feel that He was the Son of
God?

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:21.819
His own knowledge about Himself.

00:24:21.819 --> 00:24:28.760
Now supposing, somebody is the Son of God,
what should He do to prove it to human beings

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.760
are just like walls?

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:36.780
Sometimes I find I am talking to walls, absolutely,
or to some people are looking this side, that

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.770
side, and they are not understanding what
I am talking.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:46.620
How are we to prove that He was the Son of
God?

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.689
It’s an impossibility.

00:24:47.689 --> 00:24:56.120
And if He was born in modern times He would
have been crucified only when He was five

00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:01.300
years of age I can tell you! Because now we
are so ego-oriented.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:06.160
That time people were stupid but now we think
we are very intelligent: “We know everything!

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.440
We know God.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:14.910
We can organise Him!” There are many who
say that, “We don’t believe in God.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:17.090
We have created this world.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.700
We are the scientists.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.300
We are this."

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:29.450
Oh God! In this mad world, thank God He was
not born, otherwise He would have been crucified

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.470
much earlier.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:47.600
So, was is impossible to convince at the time
that He was Son of God, but today we can prove

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.850
it! Because at that time human beings had
not reached that stage that they could be

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.850
given Realisation.

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.090
Today, Realisation is working en-masse.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:08.720
Even in England we have now quite a lot of
people: “Even in England,” and I say.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.110
England itself is really a great country.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.630
It’s the heart of the universe.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:20.800
It’s the greatest country, as far as the
articulation is concerned.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:30.439
And the source of all that is good comes from
this country.

00:26:30.439 --> 00:26:37.370
But the people, English people, have lost
their self-esteem completely I feel sometimes,

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:43.050
the way they copy French and Americans and
things like that.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:51.450
If they could have their self-esteem, I still
say that the English youth are the best in

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.710
the whole world.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:59.300
Surprisingly in my own experience I found
that they are the best.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:06.730
But rather difficult nuts to be cracked! If
they are cracked they are the best.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:12.850
And once they are there they sort it out because
they understand.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:14.730
They are very scholarly.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:23.310
I think by temperament that they understand
when I say, “You cannot pay money for that."

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:28.420
You cannot organise God, and something has
to happen within you.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.630
Some actualisation has to take place.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:36.780
This is what you should understand if you
are really an Englishman.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:47.150
Because anything stupid and illogical should
be shunned completely.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:52.679
Now what is the transformation takes place
[is] that, when this Kundalini rises, She

00:27:52.679 --> 00:27:58.450
passes through these different centres which
are already exhausted within us.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:12.450
For example the second centre that is within
us is the centre for our activity.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:21.460
Supposing, you think too much, your brains
cells are to be replaced.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:33.220
This poor little centre has to work very hard
to replace those cells in your brain.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:39.710
It starts working a bit too hard and neglects
all other duties it has to do.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:48.670
For example, it has to look after the liver,
the spleen, the pancreas, the kidneys and

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:52.400
the uterus.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:29:00.490
But when people indiscriminately just go on
thinking like mad — even thinking about

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:04.480
God — what is it?

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.770
It’s like, as I told you, not coming to
Newbury and just thinking about it.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.350
It’s that mad.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:25.790
Then this centre it gets so tired, and so
tired, it’s so exhausted that diseases like

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:38.000
diabetes, liver and other complications, even
[the] blood centre of this spleen can be so

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.810
crazy with this kind of activity that one
can develop blood cancer.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:49.140
For example, now we are supposed to be running
a rat race.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.470
I mean we are supposed to be.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.620
We are in a race somehow.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.400
Everybody is in a race.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:01.580
Whether it is in the modern race or in any
other race: we have to belong to a cult or

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.850
some sort of a group where everybody is running
a race, you see.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:15.130
In that racing we forget about the way we
eat our food, then we rush about.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:25.270
We don’t even give rest to our different
organs as it is required to balance its activities,

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:37.850
[so] what happens that a thing like spleen
get so upset, it’s so upset, that it does

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.950
not know when to create more blood cells and
when not to create.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:46.309
You are eating your food suddenly a telephone
call comes in, you have to get the telephone.

00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:48.800
There’s a little child crying, you are looking
after the child.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:54.429
Now you have to go to the office just leave
your food halfway or whatever you have eaten

00:30:54.429 --> 00:30:55.819
and you just rush out.

00:30:55.819 --> 00:30:59.950
You run to the bus and the bus is missing
so you run to another bus.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:08.190
All this madness make this poor spleen really
mad because it does not understand what to

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:17.840
do, how to supply the new blood cells, and
the result is you develop blood cancer.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:22.559
It’s a very simple reason why people develop
blood cancer.

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:28.660
And then blood cancer we say is curable through
Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.650
It is.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:37.270
Actually cancer does not settle in to people
who are realised.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:42.380
But it’s absolutely curable through Sahaj
Yoga.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:47.411
All kinds of cancers can be cured through
Sahaj Yoga, no doubt, but we are not here

00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:49.740
to cure people.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:58.680
Only those who are seekers the Divine is interested
in.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:07.830
You will be surprised, a very rich man, I
would say one of the wealthiest men from India,

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:16.340
brought somebody to be cured and I said, “I
am sorry Sir, I cannot cure this person."

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.260
And he said, “Why not?

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.510
If you cure I’ll build a hospital for you,
I can give an Ashram for you."

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:31.900
I said, “You may do whatever you like, but
I am sorry he cannot be cured."

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:37.420
I did not tell him the reason for that, but
the reason is this: this man has exploited

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.890
many people, he’s tortured his wife, he’s
tortured his children.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:43.250
He’s a horrible fellow.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:50.990
He has never sought anything good.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.150
He has no compassion.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.720
He has no love.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.620
He’s for himself, a very selfish and a tyrannical
person.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:02.710
Tomorrow if Hitler comes and say, “Mother,
you give me Realisation."

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:08.110
Do you think Divine is supposed to give him
Realisation, because he thinks no end of himself?

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:15.110
It is for the Divine to decide for you.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:19.429
It is not for you to decide for the Divine.

00:33:19.429 --> 00:33:22.569
The Divine has to say that you are all right.

00:33:22.569 --> 00:33:25.990
It’s just the other way round.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.460
Because you may do whatever you like.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:37.870
You may think that you must get all the blessings
from God, but God has to know that whether

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:42.210
He is going to be gracious on you or not.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:43.850
Even His anger is His graciousness.

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:51.420
Because that is what you deserve and through
His anger and wrath He is going to cure you

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.990
and improve you.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:58.880
Sometimes we have wrong ideas also about our
seeking.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:05.510
The seeking comes to us from the third centre
which is in the navel.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.889
We call as ‘Nabhi Chakra’.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:11.439
Is the navel point.

00:34:11.439 --> 00:34:14.890
But it’s all in the spinal cord.

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:23.540
Now this third centre is the centre which
gives us seeking from the very beginning when

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.960
we were amoeba.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:33.889
We started seeking food then, as we became
higher and higher and higher in our seeking

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:43.929
of food, we became human beings, then we started
seeking say, money, position, power, fame.

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:54.750
Then the spiritual seeking came: we started
seeking in religions outside us, organising

00:34:54.750 --> 00:35:02.869
religions, calling God, devotion, dedication,
but nothing worked out.

00:35:02.869 --> 00:35:06.870
So we started a deeper seeking, meditating.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:15.170
At this time also, people came down from all
over the world to teach you meditation.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:24.320
Now meditation cannot be taught, it’s a
happening, when you are in meditation.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:33.180
You cannot go to meditation: it’s not like
a small little house or a temple or a building

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.060
where you can enter into.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.010
It’s a happening.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:41.560
You are pushed into it.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.050
You just become in meditation.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:54.840
And this happening take place only when this
Kundalini pierces this fontanel bone area

00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:00.119
and you get an actual baptism — actual,
not artificial.

00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:10.869
You can see with your naked eyes, the pulsation
of this Kundalini, the rising of this Kundalini

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:19.109
and also the pulsation on the head here, till
it stops and you start feeling the cool breeze

00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:22.140
coming simultaneously.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:30.240
That should happen to you; otherwise don’t
believe in any tall stories.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.530
For which you cannot pay.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:40.560
For which you cannot think.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:45.090
For which you cannot organise.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.070
You cannot put in any effort.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:51.310
It has to happen spontaneously.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:54.050
So the question comes in: how?

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:56.460
How it happens?

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:01.070
It’s all in, in there.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:05.180
It’s your own, within yourself.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:14.280
But say there’s a light, say this is a candle
which has got a wick which has got a wax,

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.970
it’s just ready to be enlightened.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:19.510
Then what you do?

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:27.500
You take one enlightened candle and bring
it nearer the other and you get the results,

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.500
finished.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.290
What do you do?

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:41.380
The enlightened candle just acts as a catalytic
agent, and enlightens the another candle without

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.460
any effort, without any trouble.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:51.690
In the same way an enlightened person can
enlighten another person.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.140
It’s very simple.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.730
But that person has to be enlightened.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:11.140
And the enlightened person must know how to
maintain your enlightenment for the time being.

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:19.820
Like a seed you sprout: now the children may
sprout the seeds and they would not know what

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:20.820
do with it.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:30.410
But a gardener knows: which sprouts the seed,
then it takes all the saplings separately,

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:40.950
looks after it, allows it to grow, then again
puts it in the soil properly, watches for

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:45.460
its growth till it comes to its maturity.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.690
He looks after it.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:53.230
In the same way the person who enlightened
should be able to guide you up to that point.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:39:01.490
Such a person is called as ‘guru’ in Sanskrit
language but he has to be a guru who should

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:03.490
be able to raise your Kundalini.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:09.010
Because these days if you say the name of
‘guru’, horrible names and horrible faces

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:14.220
start coming before me and they are not gurus
they are just like satanic forces.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.340
They are horrible people.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:25.410
How can they be a guru, those who live on
your money: parasites of the worst type! You

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:26.460
should see that.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:31.950
I mean, if I ask you come and live with me,
for no money at all, will you accept such

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.380
a situation?

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.400
And these are even worse.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.970
And much worse than any dog, I would say.

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:49.180
Even the dog eats food at your house at least
looks after your house! This is only one way

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.180
traffic.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:58.280
You have to go on giving them money, money,
money, money, becoming poorer and poorer and

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.810
what do you get?

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:05.620
Nothing! You must see their lifestyle, it’s
absurd.

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:14.480
They live on your money, they have all the
weaknesses that a scoundrel can have and after

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.530
few years you find they’ll land up in the
prison.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:19.840
Already we have problems with the prison.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.850
So don’t allow any of those gurus come down
here.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.540
Where will you put them?

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:32.340
Like in Switzerland I went and saw one gentleman
there.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.950
He told me that, “There’s a horrible guru
who lives here.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:38.970
Mother please come and just pay attention
to his ashram."

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.420
I said, “All right."

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:46.970
I went with him in his car, and looked at
the place: a huge lavish place he has created

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:57.610
for himself, with very tall walls like a big
palace! And you could see from outside the

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:02.629
amount of money this fellow must have gathered.

00:41:02.629 --> 00:41:12.350
And within eight days a nurse fell in love
with a policeman, and this nurse was the private

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:24.490
secretary of this guru who had used that nurse
to poison some oranges to kill some people.

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:32.420
And so the guru, the great, now is in jail
for 14 years.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:41.420
All such horrid people what have they got
to do with Divine?

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:48.140
But they mesmerise, and once you are mesmerised
your seeking becomes absolutely stupid and

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.140
foolish.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:53.050
You cannot see you are mesmerised.

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:56.480
You cannot understand how you are mesmerised.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.050
You don’t want anything for yourself.

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:04.750
There’s another one who was coming here
the other day, and he said that, “If you

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:07.740
give me a Rolls Royce I’ll come."

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.109
Imagine! He was to come from America.

00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:18.950
He had already got 58 Rolls Royce from you
people, from you, the English, very wise.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:25.670
I must say the wisest people in the whole
world, have given 58 Rolls Royces to this

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:32.970
14 year old fellow! Now he has become yankee
in America, taken away all your money, befooling

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:33.970
you.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.119
He has 58 Rolls Royces, he wants 59th.

00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:38.940
I don’t know why he wants one more.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:44.310
Poor boys and girls, they don’t have so
much money now.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.369
Here the young people don’t have much money.

00:42:47.369 --> 00:42:52.830
Like in our country maybe rich people’s
children get a lot of money, but here I find

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.280
that the young people have to find their own
way.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:02.040
They starved themselves, ate only potatoes
and fasted, did all kinds of things to save

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:11.359
money to buy a Rolls Royce for this scoundrel,
just think of it! These are all seekers who

00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:12.359
did it.

00:43:12.359 --> 00:43:21.320
So foolish and stupid! And when he came they
presented him with this Rolls Royce.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.740
My heart really weeps and I really don’t
know what to say to this kind of foolishness

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.740
people are doing.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:35.530
Naturally your parents do not believe in you!
They think: what stupidity you are doing?

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.320
I can understand.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:42.170
Even if they doubt me, I wouldn’t mind,
because really this kind of stupidity you

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:43.540
have done.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.780
And how can you believe such stupid fellow
who asked for a Rolls Royce?

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:53.050
You should have really given him a toy Rolls
Royce and 3, 4 slaps on the face and he would

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:54.050
gone back.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.870
That’s what he deserves.

00:43:55.870 --> 00:44:01.700
Now he got this Rolls Royce very nicely, he
cheated you all and went back.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:09.660
And he’ll come back next year and you will
be again doing the same thing for him!

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:13.550
Now when some of the Sahaja Yogis went and
asked these people that, “Why did you do

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.940
it?” They said, “He has given us something
so great.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.230
This is metal.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:26.580
If we give him the metal and if he gives us
the Spirit why not do it?” It’s foolishness!

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:30.441
Can you get Spirit for giving some metal?

00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:31.441
Can you?

00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:38.310
Spirit, can you purchase it or could exchange
it?

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:47.730
But
from where this kind of stupidity walks into

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:48.730
your heads?

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.270
I mean you are not such stupid people.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:52.320
Most of them are educated in university: Oxford,
Cambridge.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.330
Did you learn all these stupidity there?

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:01.650
No! It’s some sort of a mesmerism I feel.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.950
Some stupid spirits have entered into their
minds.

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.630
That’s the only solution I can get.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:16.140
I cannot understand what is the reason for
these people to go about buying Rolls Royces

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.860
for their gurus.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:23.369
Then another guru comes up here and tells
you, “I will make you fly."

00:45:23.369 --> 00:45:26.450
Very big, big people are out to fly.

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:28.620
But why do you want to fly?

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:32.840
Do you want to become birds?

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:37.090
Have you to become birds now?

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:43.740
You have to become a superior human being,
with superior value systems, built within

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.740
you.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:46.140
You want to fly.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.550
I mean it is stupidity.

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:54.440
Even if somebody gives you ideas like that,
better ask him to fly himself, drop him from

00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:00.950
this leaning tower of Pisa and see where does
he lie, which part.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:04.730
Why do you believe such stupid things, I can’t
understand.

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.390
You are supposed to be English.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:10.390
I mean at least Indians have great ideas about
your brains.

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:11.390
H.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:12.390
G.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:15.850
Wells has said that English will have one
day having only heads and no bodies.

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:20.359
But I don’t think that’s going to happen
with the advent of all these stupid gurus

00:46:20.359 --> 00:46:24.859
coming here and you people passing out all
your money to them.

00:46:24.859 --> 00:46:26.480
I don’t know what is going to happen.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:32.500
As it is we are suffering from so many other
things, plus this kind of a nonsense coming

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.590
all the spirits coming down.

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:40.770
All this negativity working into us I don’t
know what is going to happen to this country

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:41.770
of ours.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:42.770
I don’t know.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:44.030
I can’t understand.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:49.910
Now everybody is meditating in this country,
trying to fly.

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:58.590
Imagine! Doing nothing, sitting at home, meditating:
lethargy of the worst type! Trying to fly.

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:00.470
This is what it is.

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:05.820
That’s what has happened to our seeking
in various ways, in this way or that way or

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.820
that way.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.180
No, this is not to happen anymore, enough
of it.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.550
You must get your Realisation.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:13.700
That’s what you have to have.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:21.210
The Kundalini has to rise and you have to
get it because you are seekers of ages, ancient

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:22.210
times.

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:25.020
You are born today, here, to get your Realisation.

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:31.260
That’s your right to have it, and not to
be befooled by these people who just come

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:36.140
here and exploit you and have floated a market
and enterprises.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:41.340
Now this Kundalinis thing comes to you through
that centre.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:50.890
When it comes to awakening centre, that centre
of your seeking.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:58.820
Then you start seeing what you are seeking.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:06.950
You are seeking the joy of your Spirit, the
bliss of peace within yourself.

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:19.890
When the Kundalini rises and shoots off, the
seeking is complete because you have found

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:25.570
it: you are just there, no questions.

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:30.610
Supposing you enlighten the light then what
does the light do?

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:33.160
First, she is asking for the light, all right,
“I must have the light.

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:38.170
I must have the light,” [then] she gives
light — finished.

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:43.700
Then you don’t sit there, you sit here with
me and you give vibrations to people, you

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:46.590
raise their Kundalinis, you awaken them and
give them Realisation.

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:47.760
Yes, it happens.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.000
You all have those powers.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.790
In a split of a second you get that and you
become that.

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:04.020
That’s your style [because] you are human
beings, you are not worms.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:16.510
You are created out of the billions and billions
of creatures, special ones, the chosen ones,

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:25.190
to bestow this bliss upon you so that you
enter into the Kingdom of your Father, the

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:31.810
God Almighty, and enjoy your being and that’s
what you are.

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:35.440
Why are you wasting and frittering away your
energy on these nonsensical people?

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.049
Pay attention to yourself.

00:49:39.049 --> 00:49:40.540
Just find out what you are.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:45.550
It’s a very easy thing: it should happen
to you.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:51.080
It has happened to so many in this country
and should happen to people in Newbury.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:54.589
It is Cathy who has brought me here.

00:49:54.589 --> 00:50:04.780
Actually now I am on my way to India and you
had this idea not to go out of London, because

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:05.980
I have really travelling too much in Europe.

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.379
Of course, I must say Europeans are also very
sensible people: they can see through now.

00:50:08.379 --> 00:50:14.430
But I think you have to go through all that
otherwise you would have never understood

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:16.750
the value of Sahaj Yoga.

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:23.240
Perhaps that was necessary for them to spend
a lot of money on these gurus and to suffer

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.430
from all kinds of diseases.

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:30.290
There are some here sitting, from there only
suffering from epilepsy and all kinds of horrible

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:31.290
diseases like blood cancer.

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:32.290
They are here, some of them sitting.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:40.510
Then you will realise the value of Sahaja
Yoga which gives you bliss, joy and happiness.

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:45.800
First of all it gives you the physical well
being.

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:49.109
It just gives you the physical well being.

00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:55.820
Like any place where God has to be brought
in, you clean that place.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:00.150
So the Kundalini cleanses your physical being.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:03.950
That’s how you get your diseases cured.

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:10.150
Cancer is very simple, extremely simple, to
be cured, very simple to be cured.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:16.741
But for doctors it is impossible to accept
that there is God, in the real sense of the

00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:17.741
word.

00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:19.359
Ah, they will have a photograph of Christ
in the house.

00:51:19.359 --> 00:51:23.080
They might wear a cross, you see, that’s
at the most.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:34.680
But to believe that you can cure cancer through
Divine power is an impossibility for them.

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:37.230
But we have some doctors also here.

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:39.160
But if they come to me they think they are
all mad.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.410
Cancer is a simple disease.

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:47.700
Now they have reached a point where they are
coming nearer to Sahaj Yoga.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:56.530
On the left hand side and the right hand side
we have certain areas, and now they are talking

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:02.220
about these areas which exist within us and
they say there is an attack from these areas

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:13.040
which are built within us from the time of
our creation, and these areas have those deposits

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:21.600
and they send forth some protein matter, which
we cannot identify otherwise, which might

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:25.379
have gone out of circulation of evolution.

00:52:25.379 --> 00:52:28.619
When they attack us cancer is triggered.

00:52:28.619 --> 00:52:31.580
And now this I have said at least ten years
back.

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:37.410
I have been saying that there are entities
who enter into us.

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:44.180
’Us’ meaning the central path, the middle
path, the middle road.

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:48.520
They come from the sides and attack us.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:54.170
But actually when we go to the extremes of
the left or to the right, we ourselves become

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:59.240
vulnerable and we are attacked and that’s
how cancer is set in.

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:06.609
So down below is the hell, the left side is
the collective subconscious, the right side

00:53:06.609 --> 00:53:11.730
is the collective supraconscious, which is
the future side of it.

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:20.089
In the top is the Divine Power, which is the
superconsciousness we can call it, or the

00:53:20.089 --> 00:53:26.869
collective unconscious as they call it, which
becomes conscious as soon as the Kundalini

00:53:26.869 --> 00:53:28.160
touches it.

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:34.550
Your attention goes there and the whole thing
is lifted just like the tent being lifted

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:43.510
up, and you find that nothing can enter into
your attention anymore.

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:45.645
You are in that area where you cannot get
attacked.

00:53:45.645 --> 00:53:56.629
And this is what has happened to you, to many
of you, and is going to happen to the rest

00:53:56.629 --> 00:54:00.680
of the people who have come here for the first
time.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:07.960
I must say, Newbury, I must find out about
it much more, because I find this place has

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.740
tremendous vibrations.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:15.330
Only when our car arrived here I asked them,
“Where is the water somewhere here?” I

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:19.740
was not dousing but I can feel vibrations
of the water somewhere.

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.660
And the place has tremendous vibrations.

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:30.320
Actually I was thinking, “How am I going
to speak?” because as soon as I reached

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:36.290
this place my whole body started emitting
all kinds of energies from the body and I

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:40.960
was really very much worried as to, “What’s
going to happen now?

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:48.240
What am I going to speak?” But this has
worked out and I hope you have been able to

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.800
understand it.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:57.270
Now for the rest of the details you just don’t
worry.

00:54:57.270 --> 00:55:02.310
We have all the books and everything for your
information which you can read later on.

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:09.340
It’s is a simple thing, like coming in the
room, you ask me how to put on the lights.

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:14.790
I have to just tell you, “Just press the
switch and it will be on."

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:19.230
In the same way everything is built within
you, you don’t have to do anything about

00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:20.230
it.

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:23.629
It will work out in no time.

00:55:23.629 --> 00:55:28.510
But once it is worked out then you [should]
try to understand it, what it is, and try

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:30.829
to maintain it for a while.

00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:38.720
And you will be amazed that, here in Newbury,
you can start a centre of your own of Sahaj

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.830
Yoga, giving Realisation to many people.

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:44.940
May God bless you! Thank you.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:51.650
If you have any questions you can ask me.

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:54.550
Yes, please.

00:55:54.550 --> 00:56:03.250
Man: Yeah I have got a question okay.

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:07.110
Earlier on you were going on about if you
have family, children, and such as, who interrupt

00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:08.480
you and the telephone.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.329
What were you trying to say?

00:56:12.329 --> 00:56:13.869
Do you want us just ignore this?

00:56:13.869 --> 00:56:17.150
Shri Mataji: Oh, not at all! If you are not
married you cannot get Realisation.

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:18.910
Man: Then what do you mean by this?

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:24.879
I tend to think you are you trying to say
that you must try and ignore household attractions

00:56:24.879 --> 00:56:25.879
and this…

00:56:25.879 --> 00:56:29.760
Shri Mataji: When did I say that?

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.330
Man: I don’t quite know.

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:38.790
I had a job to hear everything you say but…

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:43.490
Shri Mataji: No, no, no! Who said that?

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:45.250
Not at all!

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:51.690
Man: What did you mean when you say, “The
telephone rings.."

00:56:51.690 --> 00:57:01.310
What do you mean, “You must suddenly stop
and answer the telephone,” but what do you

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:02.310
mean?

00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:04.970
Yogini: Mother, it’s when you were talking
about the spleen.

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:08.210
You said that the trouble is that there are
so many distractions that the spleen can’t

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:09.450
handle it, and I think he’s misunderstood
you.

00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:10.450
Man: Yeah, that’s right.

00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:13.900
Shri Mataji: Ah! No, no, no, you should only
look after your child and not the telephone,

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:14.900
I was meaning.

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:15.900
You must have your priorities properly built
up.

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:16.900
Ours are not.

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.780
What I was trying to say a child is lying
there, you are eating your food, a telephone

00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:25.810
is coming, now you have to rush out, the child
is neglected, you run away, you are worried

00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:28.160
about the child — never that [what you were
suggesting].

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.390
You don’t know in Sahaja Yoga you have to
be married.

00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:32.270
There’s a centre of marriage.

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:33.660
You will be amazed.

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:36.680
If you are a so called ascetic, I can’t
give you Realisation.

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.560
Another man: You can’t what?

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:44.109
Shri Mataji: You can’t get your Realisation
if you are an ascetic.

00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:45.410
So called.

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:47.440
Asceticism is within yourself.

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:53.129
A person like Guru Nanaka and all these great
people they were all married people.

00:57:53.129 --> 00:57:56.650
It doesn’t mean that you have to give up
your family at all.

00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:02.430
On the contrary, we have to have families,
beautiful families and beautiful children

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:04.530
and we are having Sahaja Yoga marriages.

00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:09.410
Do you know there are three or four couples
here who were married through Sahaj Yoga.

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:12.530
And they are beautiful people, they have beautiful
children.

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:19.940
And moreover I must tell you a greater news:
that there are lots of realised-souls who

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.530
are born in this country.

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:26.020
And you have to be married so that they are
born to you also.

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:31.310
Now this child is a realised-soul, she is
sitting, towards me.

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:37.400
To be sitting that quietly is not possible
unless and until they are realised.

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.400
This Alison is born-realised.

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:39.970
Man: My children, my three children: They
are not realised and they are sitting here

00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:40.970
all quiet!

00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:41.970
Shri Mataji: Who?

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:43.129
Man: My children, my 3 children, they are
not realised so you are taking…

00:58:43.129 --> 00:58:44.129
Shri Mataji: How do you know?

00:58:44.129 --> 00:58:45.129
Let me see where are they?

00:58:45.129 --> 00:58:46.129
Man: One, two, three.

00:58:46.129 --> 00:58:47.240
Shri Mataji: They must be born-realised, I
am sure.

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.240
Man: They are not! They are not!

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.540
Shri Mataji: How do you know?

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:53.250
How do you know?

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:55.290
We’ll tell them.

00:58:55.290 --> 00:58:58.020
How do you know?

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:05.540
You don’t know, you are not yet realised
but they are, must be I am sure, 100%.

00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:10.849
Man: Well it seems that anything you say,
goes.

00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:12.320
Shri Mataji: We’ll teach you how to know.

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.320
We’ll teach you how to know.

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.320
You should get your Realisation.

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.320
Where are they?

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.320
I would love to see them.

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.320
I can’t see them.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.510
Man: But they are quiet all the time.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:19.750
I say it’s instinct.

00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:21.940
Shri Mataji: Come along, come, come.

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:24.020
They must be born-realised to be quiet like
that.

00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.020
I would like to see them.

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.020
I am sure.

00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:27.020
How would you know their value?

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.180
I would love to see them.

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:33.210
Oh that, she is realised 100%.

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:38.000
Are you doubting her Realisation?

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.629
She is born-realised.

00:59:40.629 --> 00:59:41.879
She is born as a realised-soul.

00:59:41.879 --> 00:59:43.740
She is born-realised, no doubt.

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:47.830
I mean I knew, I was going to ask about her.

00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:49.320
How do you know?

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:52.910
You are a great person to have three children
born-realised, I must say.

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:57.040
For example, the little one there is a born-realised
and the little in that corner is a born-realised.

00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.510
And there are many born-realised people, also
there are people who are there.

00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:00.930
Where is Alan is he there?

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:04.950
Man: It’s just natural it doesn’t need
a big word for it, does it!

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:08.830
Shri Mataji: They are born-realised because
they got their Realisation in their previous

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:09.830
lives.

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:12.610
It is a very big thing for people who are
not realised.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:15.190
Man: What do they know about previous lives?

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:17.440
They don’t know anything about previous
lives.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.820
Shri Mataji: That’s what I am going to tell
them.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.590
That’s why I am here.

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:24.060
They are born because I am here.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:25.480
Do you know that?

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:27.410
I am going to tell them what it is.

01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:32.090
See these, these are all born-realised [those]
two people [who] are coming.

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.430
Ask them about it.

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:38.670
I never gave them Realisation they are born-realised
but I gave them the knowledge about what they

01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:39.670
are.

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:43.800
(Sit down my child, sit down.) They are all
realised-souls, no doubt about it! Not [just]

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:50.329
realised-souls but they could be very great
souls born on this Earth.

01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:53.250
It is not [that] they are quiet because they
are told to be.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.250
If they were not realised-souls they would
have run away.

01:00:57.250 --> 01:01:00.800
They would not have been sitting because they
are enjoying it.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.129
Their Spirit is enjoying it.

01:01:03.129 --> 01:01:04.520
You will know it very soon.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.010
Man: They will sit quietly anywhere!

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:09.080
Shri Mataji: No, no, they might because they
are realised-souls.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:13.090
Man: No, it doesn’t mean they are realised-souls,
it just means they are children.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:17.110
Shri Mataji: They are very different types
of children, very different type, something

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:18.110
so unique.

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:21.880
Once you get your Realisation you will start
seeing their beauty much better.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.340
Oh! They know such a lot you can’t imagine.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.640
My four grandchildren are born-realised but
my own daughters were not.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.810
What am I to do?

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:37.300
And four of them are great people, but my
own daughters were not.

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:41.540
What to do?

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:43.980
They are born-realised.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.370
You will see that.

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:46.370
They are that.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.060
You should be a proud man.

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:52.130
But you better get your Realisation, all right.

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:55.040
I am happy you are so concerned about your
children.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.340
I am very happy.

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:57.640
May God bless you.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.640
Any other questions?

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:05.170
Seeker: I am very impressed with what you
said about Christ having done thinking for

01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:10.970
us and we ourselves are trying to think too
much.

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:26.770
Isn’t there a danger, if we all become child-like
trusters, that we could be exploited?

01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:31.400
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is a danger, of course.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.950
I mean you are already exploited 100%.

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.570
There is a danger, no doubt.

01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:38.480
I have already told you about the danger.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.599
But to become child-like is not easy.

01:02:40.599 --> 01:02:45.119
You can be befooled but to be child-like is
the best thing.

01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:47.110
Innocence is the most powerful thing.

01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:53.520
If you are innocent nobody can touch you.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.510
But very difficult to be innocent.

01:02:56.510 --> 01:03:02.700
The centre of innocence has to be awakened
within us, then you will be like children.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:10.379
Now would you say that Christ was exploited,
many people feel that way that He was exploited:

01:03:10.379 --> 01:03:13.310
no! It was all planned very well.

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:14.900
He just played a drama.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.420
Such people do not suffer.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:18.810
I do not suffer, never.

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:22.990
Even if I say that I am suffering it’s just
a joke.

01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:25.070
Never take that seriously.

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:26.900
It’s a drama.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:29.339
Such people don’t suffer.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:33.930
He never suffered, in the sense you understand
suffering.

01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:38.329
Of course, with the physical body you do feel
little pain here and there.

01:03:38.329 --> 01:03:46.129
But you just see it as a witness.

01:03:46.129 --> 01:03:48.250
You are not really in it.

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:54.359
And when you become that, yourself, a witness,
nobody can exploit you.

01:03:54.359 --> 01:04:01.040
Because what happens you develop a new type
of a dimension, an awareness, which is called

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.040
as vibratory awareness.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.830
By this enlightenment of your fingers you
become collectively conscious.

01:04:06.830 --> 01:04:13.879
Immediately you know who is who, what is what.

01:04:13.879 --> 01:04:16.710
Children know it, those who are realised-souls
specially know it.

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:19.910
Any funny man comes in they start crying and
weeping.

01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:23.440
Like this girl’s father and mother were
involved in a nonsense.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.750
They are here now.

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:31.520
Both suffered a lot the mother became epileptic
and all that.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:39.129
And this child used to scream whenever she
saw their revered guru, and she used to shout

01:04:39.129 --> 01:04:43.140
and resist and she used to kick him.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.580
She is just a child but she knew how to protect.

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:53.080
And these people with all their intelligence
and education and this and that, were absolutely

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:58.230
useless! Because you develop that new awareness
within you by which you can feel a person,

01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:59.230
you know.

01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:00.230
You cannot be exploited.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:01.230
All right.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:08.510
That has to happen to you.

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:11.210
That’s a happening.

01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:16.710
Such a powerful personality develops, such
a powerful personality.

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:23.200
That way, many of our Sahaj Yogis also think
that I am a quite an innocent person, I mean

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.200
they think so, but now they know I know everything.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:32.349
I may look such a fool, but I am not.

01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:41.130
And the powerfulness is such, that first the
compassion, the compassion itself is so powerful,

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:43.580
so engulfing, it’s so rewarding.

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.720
Then you are not bothered about anyone.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:49.400
What are they going to do to you?

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:55.410
Like in India when I started, right and left
criticising, all these gurus, taking their

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:56.410
names.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:59.510
I started saying, “Now these people are
like this.

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:02.800
These people, they are making money and befooling
you."

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:08.629
Some of the guru’s people, who were [become]
Sahaja Yogis, one of them was some Raja or

01:06:08.629 --> 01:06:12.619
some place, he came to me and said, “Mother,
what are you doing?

01:06:12.619 --> 01:06:13.619
They will kill You."

01:06:13.619 --> 01:06:18.700
I said, “This time let them try killing
me! Who is going to kill me, I’ll see?

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:21.210
That was done once for all.

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:24.730
Now let me see who is going to kill me."

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:29.330
I said, “Let them lift their hands towards
me, if they can they’ll shake.

01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:31.000
They cannot kill me."

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:38.790
It’s the most powerful thing is your innocence
which we have lost sometimes foolishly.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:44.074
It is the highest thing.

01:06:44.074 --> 01:06:49.784
And nobody can exploit an innocent person,
nobody can befool.

01:06:49.784 --> 01:06:55.324
You have seen simple village folk, how do
they exist with all the cunning of the very

01:06:55.324 --> 01:07:00.276
well educated and sophisticated people, how
do they exist?

01:07:00.386 --> 01:07:10.326
They can manage them just like this (clicks
Her fingers) And you must see the intentions

01:07:10.386 --> 01:07:21.466
of the person: why a person should exploit,
what is the need of the person.

01:07:21.506 --> 01:07:25.586
People don’t even see the credibility of
a personality who comes here.

01:07:25.586 --> 01:07:26.616
It’s very surprising.

01:07:26.616 --> 01:07:28.336
Like one guru came here.

01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:36.656
I would say, it’s something, another foolishness
who was living in a tin shed, that is what

01:07:36.656 --> 01:07:44.119
Peter told me in South Africa, and thousands
and thousands of people are his disciples.

01:07:44.146 --> 01:07:46.869
To such an extent you will be surprised.

01:07:46.926 --> 01:07:53.279
I mean, I don’t know what to say, this is
complete blindness.

01:07:54.039 --> 01:07:57.032
I went to Norwich, so far away.

01:07:57.062 --> 01:07:59.632
This fellow has come to London only.

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:08.345
And I met three elderly ladies who were his
disciples and this gentleman was later on

01:08:08.345 --> 01:08:16.785
found to be having whisky every night and
using women, and he had all kinds of things.

01:08:16.785 --> 01:08:23.245
And his private secretary herself disclosed
everything about him.

01:08:23.245 --> 01:08:26.206
And then they found it out and they verified
it.

01:08:26.246 --> 01:08:32.116
But these three foolish women still said,
“Whatever it is Mother we cannot give him

01:08:32.127 --> 01:08:33.426
up, we love him."

01:08:33.927 --> 01:08:36.398
Now what to do to with such stupid women?

01:08:36.398 --> 01:08:38.348
You just tell me.

01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:46.878
I mean the question of you also wanting to
get exploited! I mean he is exposed, everybody

01:08:46.943 --> 01:08:54.983
knows about it, this gentleman about whom
I told you who was asking for a Rolls Royce,

01:08:54.983 --> 01:08:58.263
was caught for smuggling three hundred watches
in India.

01:08:58.263 --> 01:09:02.782
I mean how can a man like that be interested
in smuggling?

01:09:02.782 --> 01:09:09.330
Just think of that! But all these people who
carried those watches went to the police and

01:09:09.313 --> 01:09:11.750
said, “We brought it for ourselves."

01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:20.190
Three hundred watches this fellow was carrying!
And they would not give in.

01:09:21.013 --> 01:09:28.403
And when he went to jail, they put a big show,
and the Indian government did not know what

01:09:28.403 --> 01:09:31.963
to do so they said, “All right you take
him away.

01:09:31.963 --> 01:09:36.555
We don’t want to keep him in jail that otherwise
your government will come and say why our

01:09:36.601 --> 01:09:42.971
three hundred Britishers are arrested,”
imagine! So they sent all the bad lock, stock

01:09:42.971 --> 01:09:45.365
and barrel back.

01:09:46.085 --> 01:09:48.275
So he came back here.

01:09:48.275 --> 01:09:51.355
From here he has gone to America.

01:09:51.355 --> 01:09:57.465
Now if you don’t want to see: I mean, isn’t
it clear cut what I said?

01:09:57.465 --> 01:09:58.965
So clear cut.

01:09:58.965 --> 01:10:01.826
If you don’t want to see it what can you
do?

01:10:01.826 --> 01:10:06.456
I mean I tell you, sometimes I feel it is
the people who want to get exploited or they

01:10:06.456 --> 01:10:08.836
don’t want to see it.

01:10:08.836 --> 01:10:13.606
Now I would like one of them to speak to you
it would be a good idea.

01:10:13.606 --> 01:10:18.506
Because you will know how he was caught and
how he was disillusioned.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:19.506
Peter (Pierce)?

01:10:19.506 --> 01:10:22.156
Is he there, just tell him.

01:10:22.156 --> 01:10:25.496
So you will know how he was befooled.

01:10:25.496 --> 01:10:34.846
He was supposed to be a great, he is, he was,
a great diamond merchant from South Africa;

01:10:34.846 --> 01:10:41.726
married a granddaughter of a Duke of your
country, and that the granddaughter is also

01:10:41.726 --> 01:10:42.726
here.

01:10:42.726 --> 01:10:43.726
Peter?

01:10:43.726 --> 01:10:44.856
Where is he?

01:10:44.856 --> 01:10:45.936
Peter?

01:10:45.936 --> 01:10:51.221
I would like you to tell them what happened
with you and how you got exploited.

01:10:51.552 --> 01:10:53.501
That would be a better idea.

01:10:53.496 --> 01:10:56.261
You have it from your own kith and kin.

01:10:56.756 --> 01:10:57.756
Just tell them.
