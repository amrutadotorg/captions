1
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:13,560
It is “sahaja”, it means born with you.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,980
It also means: it is spontaneous.

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,314
So the right to become one with
the Divine is born with us.

4
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:28,196
It is built in within our being,
the way it is shown here in a subtleway.

5
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,900
All these centres are created within

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,080
us in the different stages of our evolution,

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:42,780
which are being strengthened by the different
Incarnations of the Prophets and of the other

8
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,200
Incarnations that they have made this
part available to us for our ascent.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,109
Now, the problem is that in this world,

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,738
they are many people who are not yet
feeling this urge to be the Spirit.

11
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,848
But there are still millions

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:15,000
who are feeling that there is something beyond,
they are the special category of the people.

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,620
So as William Blake has said that:
“Men of God have to become prophets,

14
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,960
and they will have the power to make
other prophets”, that is The Time today.

15
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,420
All of them have prophesized
about these special times,

16
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,560
even Mahomet sahib has said it very clearly: “at
the time of Resurrection, your hands will speak”.

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,106
But people don’t talk of resurrection,
they just talk of the Doomsday.

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:53,400
He was the same principal as other
Prophets were like Abraham, Moses,

19
00:01:53,697 --> 00:02:00,759
Nanaka, Janaka, all of them are the
same principal of Primordial Master.

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,080
They tried to teach you the balance
of life which is called as dharma.

21
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:15,660
If you do not have the dharma within you - dharma
is the valency of man, is ten valences he has got,

22
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,680
while the matter has got only eight, animals
nine, and the human beings have ten valences.

23
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,600
So there has been principal
ten Incarnations and those

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,221
who came on this earth to teach us the balance.
