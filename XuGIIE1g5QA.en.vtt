WEBVTT

00:07.840 --> 00:12.640
We have to meditate every day,

00:12.800 --> 00:16.640
just like washing our hands

00:16.880 --> 00:19.320
or just like cleaning our teeth,

00:19.440 --> 00:21.920
we have to in the morning-time meditate

00:21.999 --> 00:24.880
and also in the evening we have to meditate.

00:24.999 --> 00:27.160
We have to meditate both the times

00:27.440 --> 00:30.320
otherwise we cannot rise, we cannot grow.

00:30.440 --> 00:34.560
Just to think that "We are realized souls"
des âmes réalisées, vousyou do not become.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.999
This cleansing has to be done every day,

00:38.160 --> 00:40.880
every day in an hour.

00:41.840 --> 00:45.560
And this is why none of the experiences which are described

00:45.840 --> 00:48.680
are felt sometimes in Sahaja Yoga

00:48.920 --> 00:50.120
and people ask

00:50.400 --> 00:53.040
"Mother, how it is that we don't feel the khechari?"

00:53.360 --> 00:55.999
Because your attention is not also

00:56.160 --> 00:58.360
there where it should have been.

00:58.840 --> 01:04.280
So one has to try to meditate in such a manner

01:04.560 --> 01:09.080
that it is working of the Kundalini is facilitated.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.120
The chakras are cleansed out

01:13.440 --> 01:18.360
and ultimately you are in a state of meditation.

01:19.160 --> 01:23.400
It's not a question of how to go into meditation,

01:28.360 --> 01:30.440
but is the question

01:31.999 --> 01:36.120
how to be in meditation all the time.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.800
So as you know that Kundalini, when she reaches

01:41.800 --> 01:43.800
the Agnya Chakra

01:43.999 --> 01:46.640
and when She opens Agnya chakra,

01:48.040 --> 01:52.360
then you can be in thoughtless awareness,

01:52.999 --> 01:56.120
then you don't think - thinking just stops.

01:56.360 --> 02:01.200
You watch everything, just watch,

02:01.999 --> 02:04.999
but you do not get involved into what you are watching,

02:05.040 --> 02:10.680
but you just watch and that watching itself

02:11.999 --> 02:14.999
gives you the growth within.

02:15.440 --> 02:20.040
Think of the tree which is, say, in a turmoil or

02:20.280 --> 02:24.280
during earthquake: it won't grow.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.800
When the earthquake stops,

02:27.999 --> 02:30.160
everything becomes quiet,

02:30.320 --> 02:33.999
everything is peaceful, then only the tree can grow.

02:34.080 --> 02:37.080
In the same way, our growth can only take place

02:37.360 --> 02:39.999
if we are peaceful within ourselves.

02:40.920 --> 02:46.040
So for a Kundalini growing wider and wider

02:46.320 --> 02:48.640
and rising higher and higher,

02:48.880 --> 02:52.999
first thing is we must have peace within ourselves,

02:54.120 --> 02:57.160
but this peace is possible if you can make really

02:57.440 --> 02:58.999
peace with others.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.999
If you cannot make peace with others

03:02.200 --> 03:04.680
who are in Sahaja Yoga,

03:04.999 --> 03:06.800
who are in the collective,

03:06.999 --> 03:11.120
if you are in a turmoil, this Kundalini can never rise.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.320
That is why collectivity is so important.

03:15.999 --> 03:19.640
Without collectivity your Vishuddhi cannot open,

03:20.320 --> 03:22.120
and without collectivity

03:22.400 --> 03:26.999
you cannot have the growth of your spirituality.

03:28.999 --> 03:30.999
It's the growth of the spirituality

03:31.120 --> 03:35.080
as they say the Tree of Life is upside down

03:35.320 --> 03:38.080
and the roots are in the brain,

03:38.440 --> 03:42.840
and this Kundalini has to go and water that brain,

03:44.400 --> 03:46.999
as we water the roots.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.840
Then it starts growing downward

03:49.999 --> 03:52.600
and that's how you start expanding.

03:52.999 --> 03:56.400
So this power of Gauri has to be respected

03:56.640 --> 03:58.480
because she's our mother,

03:58.800 --> 04:00.680
she's our individual mother.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.200
She has given us second birth.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.760
She is the one who knows all about us;

04:06.999 --> 04:09.320
she's so gentle, so kind.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.680
How she slowly rises.

04:11.800 --> 04:15.800
She doesn't give us trouble, she takes all the trouble of penetrating

04:15.960 --> 04:19.720
through these centers and she gives us this second birth.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.440
Because she understands everything,

04:24.640 --> 04:27.680
she knows everything, she organizes everything,

04:27.960 --> 04:32.760
she brings forth all the beauty that you are.

04:32.999 --> 04:36.200
Once you start developing that beauty within yourself,

04:36.680 --> 04:39.400
then you'll be surprised how powerful you are;

04:39.640 --> 04:43.480
that all these things are of the same nature

04:43.680 --> 04:45.640
is the truth that you discover,

04:45.960 --> 04:51.720
is the same as the beauty, is the same as the joy.

04:51.999 --> 04:54.880
You don't have to think that joy is separate,

04:54.999 --> 04:57.400
truth is different, beauty is different.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.160
Because we are not yet at that point

05:00.400 --> 05:02.999
we just take one facet,

05:03.280 --> 05:06.320
but once we reach that point then

05:06.920 --> 05:10.000
the whole thing seems to be one.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.720
There is no differentiation at all.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.480
It's all one.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.160
Many facets of a diamond

05:19.440 --> 05:20.880
but it's one diamond

05:21.000 --> 05:24.760
and that diamond is your self, your spirit.

05:25.999 --> 05:27.640
So today is a very great day,

05:27.760 --> 05:30.200
we have to thank our, our Kundalini,

05:30.320 --> 05:33.000
the Gauri for giving us realization

05:33.280 --> 05:36.520
and to know that we have to every time awaken Her,

05:36.880 --> 05:39.160
every time we have to expand Her,

05:39.440 --> 05:41.880
and every time to worship Her

05:42.000 --> 05:47.160
so that we always keep our realization intact

05:47.440 --> 05:50.200
and keep our ascent intact.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.680
It is this ascent

05:52.960 --> 05:56.480
which is going to transform all the human beings.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.680
So you have to pray to Her that "keep us pure,

05:59.960 --> 06:02.240
make us pure." She purifies you,

06:02.480 --> 06:04.880
Her job is to purify your chakras,

06:04.999 --> 06:08.999
so "Please purify us, make our hearts clean,

06:09.200 --> 06:11.999
our minds clean, everything clean;

06:12.200 --> 06:13.920
and ultimately

06:14.000 --> 06:19.320
keep our connection forever and everlasting,

06:19.520 --> 06:23.560
so that we feel this beautiful power of God's love

06:23.800 --> 06:25.720
flowing through us."

06:25.999 --> 06:28.520
For that, whatever is necessary you will do.

06:28.880 --> 06:32.560
You will be very much in the collective, will sacrifice anything

06:32.880 --> 06:36.920
and also will try to be very sensible,

06:36.999 --> 06:38.999
will try to spread Sahaja Yoga,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.760
because when you spread Sahaja Yoga like a tree,

06:41.999 --> 06:44.480
then the depth will grow also.

06:44.960 --> 06:48.240
But it has to be done with the same beauty

06:48.480 --> 06:51.440
as the awakening of the Kundalini.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.440
She has not troubled you,

07:01.680 --> 07:05.320
she has not given any problems to you,

07:06.760 --> 07:10.000
so from that one has to learn

07:11.480 --> 07:17.040
that we have to behave in a manner

07:20.080 --> 07:23.480
the way Kundalini is so gentle,

07:23.999 --> 07:27.160
so sweet, so nice, so effective

07:27.400 --> 07:33.720
and she brings our life to some meaning.

07:34.040 --> 07:42.200
She completes the meaning of our life,

07:43.080 --> 07:46.400
she completes our desires

07:46.680 --> 07:48.440
and she takes us to a point

07:48.640 --> 07:50.720
where we start seeing the whole thing,

07:50.999 --> 07:53.640
the whole universe as one,

07:53.880 --> 07:55.680
all human beings as one.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.160
She gives us collective consciousness.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.480
All this work is done by Kundalini alone.

08:02.720 --> 08:07.400
Of course, if she does not go to any chakras

08:07.560 --> 08:09.680
and does not awaken any deity,

08:09.800 --> 08:13.880
we cannot even have the fruits of those chakras being awakened.

08:13.999 --> 08:17.320
So it is all her work, all her ascent,

08:17.520 --> 08:22.160
all her understanding and wisdom

08:22.400 --> 08:26.520
which has given us this beautiful state

08:26.800 --> 08:29.320
that we call ourselves as yogis.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.240
So I would request you all

08:32.480 --> 08:35.160
to pay attention to your Kundalini,

08:35.400 --> 08:37.000
try to raise her all the time,

08:37.240 --> 08:39.320
see that you get your vibrations.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.320
Also see that,

08:41.520 --> 08:43.999
not only that you get your vibrations all right,

08:44.240 --> 08:47.960
but also for others you have a different attitude.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.800
Do not criticize others,

08:49.999 --> 08:53.560
do not say anything about how wrong they are,

08:53.800 --> 08:55.920
but just see how right they are

08:55.999 --> 08:59.080
and what good they are capable of.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.999
She is a virgin and still so wise.

09:05.920 --> 09:12.560
In the same way we have to be very wise, very sensible.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.640
We cannot afford to waste our time now

09:15.800 --> 09:21.999
because we have to save the whole world, is our responsibility.

09:21.999 --> 09:25.240
If we do not now work out even our own chakras,

09:25.400 --> 09:27.560
we cannot help anyone.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.640
So first of all we must work out our own chakras,

09:31.800 --> 09:34.560
and then we can help the whole world.

09:34.680 --> 09:41.320
It's not something like a cult or an organization

09:41.480 --> 09:44.960
where you just say: "I belong to this cult or this organization.

09:44.999 --> 09:46.920
So it's all right, I'll be saved by God."

09:46.999 --> 09:49.999
That's not promised in Sahaja Yoga.

09:50.080 --> 09:53.680
There's nothing like a ticket to Heaven.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.840
It has to be worked out.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.760
You have to work it out, and work it out

09:58.999 --> 10:02.160
with full understanding as to what is

10:02.840 --> 10:06.999
this Kundalini is and how she works.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.120
May God bless you.
