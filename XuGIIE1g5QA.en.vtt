00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.640
We have to meditate every day,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.640
just like washing our hands

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.320
or just like cleaning our teeth,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.920
we have to in the morning-time meditate

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.880
and also in the evening we have to meditate.

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.160
We have to meditate both the times

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.320
otherwise we cannot rise, we cannot grow.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.560
Just to think that "We are realized souls"
you do not become.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.999
This cleansing has to be done every day,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.880
every day in and out.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.560
And this is why none of the experiences which are described

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.680
are felt sometimes in Sahaja Yoga

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.120
and people ask

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.040
"Mother, how it is that we don't feel the khechari?"

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.999
Because your attention is not also

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.360
there where it should have been.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.280
So one has to try to meditate in such a manner

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.080
that it is working of the Kundalini is facilitated.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.120
The chakras are cleansed out

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.360
and ultimately you are in a state of meditation.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.400
It's not a question of how to go into meditation,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.440
but is the question

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:36.120
how to be in meditation all the time.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.800
So as you know that Kundalini, when she reaches

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.800
the Agnya Chakra

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.640
and when She opens Agnya chakra,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.360
then you can be in thoughtless awareness,

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.120
then you don't think - thinking just stops.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.200
You watch everything, just watch,

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.999
but you do not get involved into what you are watching,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.680
but you just watch and that watching itself

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.999
gives you the growth within.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.040
Think of the tree which is, say, in a turmoil or

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.280
during earthquake: it won't grow.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.800
When the earthquake stops,

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.160
everything becomes quiet,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.999
everything is peaceful, then only the tree can grow.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.080
In the same way, our growth can only take place

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.999
if we are peaceful within ourselves.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.040
So for a Kundalini growing wider and wider

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.640
and rising higher and higher,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.999
first thing is we must have peace within ourselves,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.160
but this peace is possible if you can make really

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.999
peace with others.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.999
If you cannot make peace with others

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.680
who are in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:06.800
who are in the collective,

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:11.120
if you are in a turmoil, this Kundalini can never rise.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.320
That is why collectivity is so important.

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.640
Without collectivity your Vishuddhi cannot open,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.120
and without collectivity

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.999
you cannot have the growth of your spirituality.

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:30.999
It's the growth of the spirituality

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.080
as they say the Tree of Life is upside down

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.080
and the roots are in the brain,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.840
and this Kundalini has to go and water that brain,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.999
as we water the roots.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.840
Then it starts growing downward

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.600
and that's how you start expanding.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.400
So this power of Gauri has to be respected

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.480
because she's our mother,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.680
she's our individual mother.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.200
She has given us second birth.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.760
She is the one who knows all about us;

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.320
she's so gentle, so kind.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.680
How she slowly rises.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.800
She doesn't give us trouble, she takes all the trouble of penetrating

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.720
through these centers and she gives us this second birth.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.440
Because she understands everything,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.680
she knows everything, she organizes everything,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.760
she brings forth all the beauty that you are.

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.200
Once you start developing that beauty within yourself,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.400
then you'll be surprised how powerful you are;

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.480
that all these things are of the same nature

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.640
is the truth that you discover,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.720
is the same as the beauty, is the same as the joy.

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:54.880
You don't have to think that joy is separate,

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.400
truth is different, beauty is different.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.160
Because we are not yet at that point

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.999
we just take one facet,

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.320
but once we reach that point then

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.000
the whole thing seems to be one.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.720
There is no differentiation at all.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.480
It's all one.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.160
Many facets of a diamond

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.880
but it's one diamond

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.760
and that diamond is your self, your spirit.

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:27.640
So today is a very great day,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.200
we have to thank our, our Kundalini,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.000
the Gauri for giving us realization

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.520
and to know that we have to every time awaken Her,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.160
every time we have to expand Her,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.880
and every time to worship Her

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.160
so that we always keep our realization intact

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.200
and keep our ascent intact.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.680
It is this ascent

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.480
which is going to transform all the human beings.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.680
So you have to pray to Her that "keep us pure,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.240
make us pure." She purifies you,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.880
Her job is to purify your chakras,

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:08.999
so "Please purify us, make our hearts clean,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.999
our minds clean, everything clean;

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.920
and ultimately

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.320
keep our connection forever and everlasting,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.560
so that we feel this beautiful power of God's love

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.720
flowing through us."

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:28.520
For that, whatever is necessary you will do.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.560
You will be very much in the collective, will sacrifice anything

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.920
and also will try to be very sensible,

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:38.999
will try to spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.760
because when you spread Sahaja Yoga like a tree,

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:44.480
then the depth will grow also.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.240
But it has to be done with the same beauty

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.440
as the awakening of the Kundalini.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.440
She has not troubled you,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.320
she has not given any problems to you,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.000
so from that one has to learn

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.040
that we have to behave in a manner

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.480
the way Kundalini is so gentle,

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:27.160
so sweet, so nice, so effective

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:33.720
and she brings our life to some meaning.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:42.200
She completes the meaning of our life,

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.400
she completes our desires

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.440
and she takes us to a point

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.720
where we start seeing the whole thing,

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:53.640
the whole universe as one,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.680
all human beings as one.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.160
She gives us collective consciousness.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.480
All this work is done by Kundalini alone.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.400
Of course, if she does not go to any chakras

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.680
and does not awaken any deity,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.880
we cannot even have the fruits of those chakras being awakened.

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:17.320
So it is all her work, all her ascent,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.160
all her understanding and wisdom

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.520
which has given us this beautiful state

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.320
that we call ourselves as yogis.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.240
So I would request you all

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.160
to pay attention to your Kundalini,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.000
try to raise her all the time,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.320
see that you get your vibrations.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.320
Also see that,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.999
not only that you get your vibrations all right,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.960
but also for others you have a different attitude.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.800
Do not criticize others,

00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:53.560
do not say anything about how wrong they are,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.920
but just see how right they are

00:08:55.999 --> 00:08:59.080
and what good they are capable of.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.999
She is a virgin and still so wise.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:12.560
In the same way we have to be very wise, very sensible.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.640
We cannot afford to waste our time now

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.999
because we have to save the whole world, is our responsibility.

00:09:21.999 --> 00:09:25.240
If we do not now work out even our own chakras,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.560
we cannot help anyone.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.640
So first of all we must work out our own chakras,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.560
and then we can help the whole world.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:41.320
It's not something like a cult or an organization

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.960
where you just say: "I belong to this cult or this organization.

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:46.920
So it's all right, I'll be saved by God."

00:09:46.999 --> 00:09:49.999
That's not promised in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.680
There's nothing like a ticket to Heaven.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.840
It has to be worked out.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.760
You have to work it out, and work it out

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:02.160
with full understanding as to what is

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.999
this Kundalini is and how she works.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.120
May God bless you.
