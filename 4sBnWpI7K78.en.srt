1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:05,709
hello! It’s good! How are you?

2
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:06,709
It’s a good day.

3
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:08,890
Today is an auspicious day because 21st is 
an auspicious day for us and today is Monday

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,890
and the 7th month.

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:39,860
All things combined together and it’s a 
very auspicious evening.

6
00:00:39,860 --> 00:01:20,990
So today I’ll talk to you about auspiciousness 
because most of you are Sahaj Yogis.

7
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:34,759
Who has come for the first time?

8
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,980
One, two, three, four, five…So we have for 
the first time! All right.

9
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,980
(laughing)

10
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:51,620
I am sure somebody has talked to them about 
introduction to Sahaja Yoga or something?

11
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:58,010
And to make it short, the whole thing I don’t 
want to repeat as I was thinking of talking

12
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,570
on a new subject to the Sahaja Yogis.

13
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,970
As you know all of you, and you can see around 
also that there’s a very big en masse search

14
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,979
for the Truth — there is.

15
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:15,170
I mean, even in this hall you will be amazed 
there might be five [or] six halls like this

16
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,810
where everybody is sitting in some hall and 
doing and something about it.

17
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:29,780
I mean there is no doubt a very big urge to 
seek the Truth.

18
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:39,000
This urge has come through our own evolutionary 
understanding.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:51,209
When human beings have reached a certain stage 
of sagacity, you can call it, or a satisfaction,

20
00:02:51,209 --> 00:03:02,379
like when you have achieved a certain amount 
of material well-being or have seen something

21
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:23,219
which doesn’t give you a complete answer; 
like Buddha, when he saw an old man and then

22
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:33,209
a dead man, he was puzzled at it; he was very 
much puzzled and he started wondering what

23
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:40,309
is this death and why a human being becomes 
an old man.

24
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:53,059
There was a prophecy about him when he was 
a child that he may become an ascetic or that

25
00:03:53,059 --> 00:04:02,999
he may give up his family life to find the 
Truth — he might do that.

26
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:07,810
And the parents were worried and [his] father 
arranged for him a very big palace with all

27
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,449
the things available and a very beautiful 
wife and a child.

28
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:22,760
But still from inside he had a feeling of 
some incompleteness, of meaningless[ness]

29
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:34,300
of life; and with that meaningless feeling, 
once he saw a very, very old man and then

30
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,780
a dead man, and this just went into his head.

31
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,669
This was two thousand years back, more than 
that.

32
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:48,380
But today there was many buddhas living.

33
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,550
I mean his first name was Siddharth.

34
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:58,590
Siddharth itself is very beautiful [name] 
– Siddh, Arth: the one who has mastered

35
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,659
his meaning.

36
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:03,349
The beginning of the name itself was very 
suggestive.

37
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:08,080
But then he became The Buddha, the enlightened 
one.

38
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,460
But you are all siddharthas who are seeking 
the Truth.

39
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:21,889
he also went to Upanishadas and he also went 
to many people, he went to Benares and was

40
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,740
so disillusioned the way the people were in 
Benares.

41
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:32,680
he found there was no religion in them, there 
was no God in them, there was no goodness

42
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
in them.

43
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,060
And they were making money out of all this.

44
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,150
Then he went to some gurus, and this and that, 
and everywhere he found that they did not

45
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:48,879
know the Truth, and he got tired, very tired.

46
00:05:48,879 --> 00:06:00,760
he had given up everything just in the search 
of Truth.

47
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,430
And he was so tired, absolutely tired, and 
lay down under a tree, a banyan tree, we call

48
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,430
it the ashwatha: and then Sahaja Yoga itself, 
[which] is the spontaneous awakening of the

49
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,449
Kundalini, took place, and he got his Realisation.

50
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:24,940
But that time there was no Mataji Nirmala 
Devi to tell him how he got it, where was

51
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,770
his Kundalini.

52
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:38,169
he just felt the cool breeze coming in him 
and he felt his Self and he started talking

53
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:41,190
about it and telling people.

54
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:52,740
he felt that, “Because I gave up everything, 
that is why it has worked so."

55
00:06:52,740 --> 00:07:11,819
It was a mistake, I would say, or a misunderstanding, 
because what do you give up?

56
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,820
Whatever you hold on to.

57
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,190
What is there to give up?

58
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,819
All these stones?

59
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:19,819
What?

60
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,539
What is their value?

61
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:29,590
And this giving up is also a mental idea, 
just a mental idea: if you are not holding

62
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,349
on to anything what are you going to give 
up?

63
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:42,990
So this idea of giving up came to him because 
he thought that this must be the reason.

64
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:51,860
Supposing I have to come to Caxton Hall, I 
go all the way to Tottenham Court Road and

65
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,160
then I go to East End and then come down here.

66
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,990
So if anybody comes to ask me the way I will 
say, “All right, go to Tottenham Court Road,

67
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:07,509
then to East End and then through the traffic 
you can land up here!” But it’s only two

68
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:15,840
minutes drive from my house! So it was that 
kind of a misunderstanding which led him to

69
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,139
think that there is no God.

70
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:23,120
In a way it was a mid-step because if you 
talk of God suddenly…Even today if I say,

71
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,110
“There is a God,” how are you to believe 
me?

72
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,199
You can believe your vibrations, you can believe 
there’s a cool breeze coming in, you can

73
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,880
see the Kundalini rising, you can see the 
pulsation of that, but how can you say that

74
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,180
there is God?

75
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,519
Because I say there is.

76
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,649
Because it is pervading.

77
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:52,820
And whatever I say, now you can test it on 
your vibrations!

78
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,269
Now how will you know that these vibrations 
are telling you the Truth?

79
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:04,020
It is very simple if you understand the common 
sense of relativity.

80
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:13,560
Like, bring two mad people from lunatic asylum 
absolutely certified as mad — all right?

81
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:22,050
And then – Paul is laughing – and then 
get two sane people sitting down.

82
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:27,440
Now you put your hands towards the people 
who are mad and you will get horrible burning

83
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:35,560
in here, maybe in here, maybe in the whole 
hand — on the left side.

84
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,459
And they themselves, before my photograph 
will be going on like this (shaking).

85
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:46,870
Many go, even they look sane but there are 
many like that: all fanatics, all extremists,

86
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:59,350
all sorts of people, they go on like this, 
spiritualists again, druggists, chemists (laughing),

87
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,350
cancer patients.

88
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:09,490
It’s a different frequency, different style 
in every way.

89
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,399
So you get ten cases like that.

90
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:27,720
Now you ask the question, “Is there God?” 
And you start getting cool breeze flowing

91
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,810
into you.

92
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:35,889
“Is His power all-pervading?” You start 
getting a cool breeze flowing into you.

93
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:45,050
That is how you find out which is the Truth, 
where what I am saying, what vibrations are

94
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,100
telling, is the Truth or not.

95
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,220
That is how you can test your vibrations.

96
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,290
This search is on, and there are many shops 
people have opened.

97
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,220
This is not a shop, this is a temple.

98
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:14,269
And a temple in the market place has a very 
little value.

99
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:20,699
If you have to climb up seven mountains to 
go to a temple it has much more value but

100
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:29,940
only a few can reach there alive! So the temple 
had to come down to London, to Caxton Hall,

101
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,820
to talk to people.

102
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:40,009
But in the market place if you have a temple, 
you can notice that people just go in the

103
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:45,089
marketplace, purchase something before going 
they may throw 1 anna (1/16 old Indian Rupee)

104
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:49,171
there thinking, “Oh Lord, give me some profit 
when I am going there!” And while coming

105
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:53,920
back they will throw another 5 annas there 
saying that, “Oh all right, You have helped

106
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
me.

107
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,170
All right 5p is all right for your sake because 
I have got some profit I am giving You!”

108
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:06,019
Because they have a mentality of marketing: 
even with God they bargain.

109
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:13,130
The mentality is of marketing, of most of 
the people, must be.

110
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,759
But among them are real people also.

111
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,700
Many, many real people are there who are misled.

112
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:31,009
Because they see the crowds going, thousands 
of people going there, they are also misled.

113
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:37,620
Ultimately all those who are true seekers 
will receive their Realisation.

114
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,440
Even those who are not will receive it.

115
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,370
But first those who are seeking are the foundation 
stones.

116
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:52,519
They have to build up themselves in such a 
way that this big edifice could be raised

117
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,660
on its back, on its foundation stone.

118
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:10,649
You people have to be such strong Sahaja Yogis, 
such strong Sahaja Yogis, that from your own

119
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:20,000
life others would take the lessons and understand 
that this is something that has really transformed

120
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
people.

121
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,990
Because the time of judgment has come and 
of transformation.

122
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:32,790
The Last Judgement is not direct but through 
transformation.

123
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,529
It does not fail much.

124
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:43,010
If you do not fail it, it is not going to 
fail: it is going to work out.

125
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:49,779
All sorts of permutations and combinations 
it has worked out — all sorts.

126
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:53,910
Now there’s no horrible guru I have not 
tried.

127
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,680
Of course, sometimes I hear some new names 
from somebody.

128
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,379
The other day I heard something new, some 
other name.

129
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:05,139
And he’s another funny thing! He’s teaching 
people, I don’t know.

130
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:07,769
Something very horrid he’s teaching people.

131
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:14,470
And maybe he may be successful for a short 
time but ultimately those who are true seekers

132
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,740
will definitely come.

133
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,100
Those who are supporting these wrong organisations 
will also come to Sahaja Yoga because they

134
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,940
will recognise that, “By supporting these 
people what are we going to gain?

135
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,380
We are going to go to hell!” They will see 
their gurus how they are behaving: ultimately

136
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,380
they will come of course.

137
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,970
For the time being they do not.

138
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,899
Sometimes it’s quite frustrating.

139
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:41,850
For example, in Norwich we met two ladies 
— elderly, quite elderly — but without

140
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:48,050
any common sense and they said, “No, we 
have a guru who has given us a name."

141
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,009
I said, “Why do you need a guru for that?

142
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:53,300
You can pick up on the streets.

143
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,829
A donkey can give you a name!”And what is 
the name they have been given?

144
00:14:55,829 --> 00:15:00,589
One of the disciples of this guru told me 
a name has been given called as ‘tinga’

145
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:05,079
[which] means ‘a thumb’ — [in India 
if] you show somebody a thumb, it is ‘tinga’.

146
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:11,540
Just imagine! It is not even Sanskrit! I said, 
“He doesn’t even know Sanskrit! Now he

147
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:17,850
has been found out with six women around him 
and he’s got keeps and he’s taking all

148
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,100
Scotch whisky, all that, he’s busy here."

149
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,750
They said, “Still…” I said, “Still?

150
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:36,079
How long will you go on like that?” Of course 
some common sense will come into them.

151
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:42,399
So these things are there, existing, but the 
true ones will understand the true nature

152
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,889
of Sahaja Yoga.

153
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:51,110
It is so nice to see all of you here because 
we are going to have a very nice 27th.

154
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:57,410
Is the day we are initiating you as gurus; 
that’s the day you will be initiated as

155
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,410
gurus.

156
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:03,560
And special powers will be given to you on 
that day.

157
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:19,339
But our intellect is to be a little bit brought 
low and our heart is to be a little bit raised

158
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:20,339
higher.

159
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:27,379
If we could do that then we’ll be able to 
create auspiciousness about us.

160
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:30,269
Now I must tell you about auspiciousness.

161
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,759
What is auspicious?

162
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:39,569
This word people know: this is not auspicious, 
that is not auspicious.

163
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:44,350
If you find the horse’s horseshoe, it is 
auspicious.

164
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:54,730
Now do you know in modern times the symbol 
of Sahaja Yoga is horseshoe-shaped: can you

165
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,730
imagine?

166
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,440
It has many meanings but why that shape is 
auspicious, people did not know.

167
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,430
People do not know why a thing is auspicious 
and a thing is not auspicious.

168
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:14,270
Now this has been in England; for years people 
were using horseshoe as an auspicious thing

169
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,100
and it is, hundred percent.

170
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,280
The shape of a horseshoe emits vibrations.

171
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
You can see for yourself.

172
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:32,130
The shape of that horseshoe is the shape [of] 
how The Shakti moves, how the power moves:

173
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,110
always like this, elliptical, like that.

174
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:45,301
It goes to a person, say if I love this person 
the vibrations will go like this and embrace

175
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:46,560
her and then come back.

176
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,650
The first movement is this way, the first 
dimension is like that.

177
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,910
But this can be [in] three-hundred and sixty 
degrees (3600) it moves.

178
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,300
The whole Creation took place by the movement 
of the Shakti like this.

179
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,710
That’s why they sometimes see it parabolic.

180
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,240
You see, like Einstein has been talking about 
it.

181
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,450
But they see partial truth, not the whole.

182
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:26,060
Now, when you have a shape or a form, or a 
kind of an assemblage of certain factors in

183
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:37,300
a particular material could be, could be a 
particular tree, could be a human being, then

184
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:47,240
you find, from that person — only the realised-souls 
can feel — vibrations coming.

185
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:56,370
Because, whatever emits vibration is auspicious 
and auspiciousness is the quality by which

186
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,180
we emit vibrations.

187
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:07,310
Now purity is 
a very relative word in the modern times.

188
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,610
People don’t understand what is purity.

189
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,250
I mean they don’t understand even what is 
normal, leave only purity.

190
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,160
Everybody seems to be abnormal or subnormal 
in modern times.

191
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,210
Nobody seems to be normal.

192
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,912
Even the psychologists can’t define what 
normal is.

193
00:19:19,912 --> 00:19:22,770
Normal is that which is auspicious.

194
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:30,760
Now this is the knowledge of the beyond.

195
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,790
With whatever senses you have, you cannot 
feel it.

196
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,510
For example, I went to Stonehenge.

197
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,730
Now you all know that there’s something 
about Stonehenge, you know that there’s

198
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,750
something about them.

199
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,810
But what about them?

200
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:54,520
These are the stones which have come out of 
Mother Earth, which are emitting vibrations.

201
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,820
And the covering of that has been done later 
on, some people must have [done that].

202
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,370
They did not understand how these stones have 
come out, one after another so they must have

203
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,520
used [other stones] to cover it.

204
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:12,360
But if they were saints they would have said 
that, this is a stone which has got vibrations.

205
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:22,020
For example, when we say that we should not 
worship any statues in The Bible, it’s very

206
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:29,080
correct because it is said that, whatever 
is created by Mother Earth or by the sky should

207
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,410
not be reproduced.

208
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,280
So Mother Earth is producing something.

209
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,120
Now ask the Christians what are they producing.

210
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,830
What is the element that is the earth is producing, 
what is the sky is producing?

211
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:50,130
They will not be able to tell you! What is 
this Mother Earth producing which should not

212
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,250
be reproduced?

213
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,900
Which should not be worshipped?

214
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,150
Means something She is producing which should 
be worshipped and that should not be reproduced.

215
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:08,771
This auspiciousness can only be felt by people 
who are realised-souls or people who are sensitive

216
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:11,030
to spirituality.

217
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,920
Those who are not sensitive to spirituality 
cannot feel it.

218
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,020
They do not understand.

219
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:24,090
They may like a person very much, “Because 
I like!” But why?

220
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:29,820
Why do you like a person very much and you 
do not like another person?

221
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:36,300
That person may be any type, they will say, 
“No we like him!” But children — not

222
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,710
all, but many children — can feel the auspiciousness.

223
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:48,980
Dogs can feel it, rats can feel it, snakes 
can feel it, tigers can feel it, lions can

224
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:56,150
feel it, but human beings are rather difficult! 
Horses can feel it.

225
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,910
Horses feel it very much.

226
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:10,620
If you take them near a place where there 
are [dead] spirits or, we can say, some sort

227
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,640
of a burial ground, they would not like to 
go down there much.

228
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:23,560
First they would resist, but gradually they 
also get used to it; same with dogs.

229
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,780
They can feel it, a man who is a realised-soul, 
who is not a realised-soul.

230
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,930
They can even feel an evil person.

231
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,850
They are very sensitive.

232
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,410
A dog can always feel a saint.

233
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,920
Even a mad dog can be controlled by a saint.

234
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:53,720
This auspiciousness, the feeling of auspiciousness, 
can be felt through heart: it’s the feeling

235
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:02,970
from the heart, not from the brain, not from 
the ego or superego: means either we get ideas

236
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,960
from our ego or from our superego, from our 
conditioning.

237
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:17,370
But if our heart is alive, which is a very 
rare thing nowadays: most of us have got hearts

238
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:25,700
like, ‘frozen’ I would not say [but], 
like Rock of Gibraltar.

239
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,510
Because frozen can be defrosted.

240
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:34,550
So such a heart, Rock of Gibraltar, is living 
here, you see.

241
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:43,990
And you meet another person and you feel the 
other is just going to bang on you with that

242
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,990
Rock of Gibraltar.

243
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,660
I don’t know if you have visited Rock of 
Gibraltar any time.

244
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,660
I have.

245
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:56,590
One day we were plying on a ship and suddenly 
our ship stopped and what I found is a huge

246
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,220
big promontory.

247
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:04,060
I said, “What sort of a thing it is?” 
Because no ship can go near any rock, that

248
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:12,160
near, because no rock is that steep to give 
that much draft for the ship.

249
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,800
And this was just like this in front.

250
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:19,490
I said, “What sort of a rock is this?” 
They said, “This is Rock of Gibraltar!”

251
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:25,620
I was looking at it absolutely a solid piece 
and you thought it is going to hit you on

252
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,680
your head.

253
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:33,600
Something like that [when] human beings become, 
how can you feel the auspiciousness?

254
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,660
It’s a very sensitive thing: extremely sensitive 
and delicate.

255
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:45,600
All the delicacy of the heart, I don’t know 
where it is gone.

256
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,880
Like Lord Byron’s style! Look at him: what 
a life he had! He made everyone miserable

257
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,570
in his private life and in his poetry he made 
everybody cry; took out their eyes, washed

258
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:13,500
them, again put them back in the sockets! 
(laughing) I mean, he was a very great sadist,

259
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
I felt.

260
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,830
Horrible! He could not write anything beautiful, 
he could not see anything beautiful, he could

261
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,710
not say anything that was pleasant.

262
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:30,830
And people, I have seen, have wept and wept 
and wept and this fellow was enjoying having

263
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,420
a nice time somewhere! (laughing)

264
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:40,130
It’s nice to laugh it out because we had 
two patients who read only Lord Byron and

265
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:49,870
were gone cases! You don’t know in England 
I get such cases, some samples! He is no more

266
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,210
here so I can tell you about him.

267
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,690
He used to just weep and weep and weep.

268
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,110
And then we didn’t do anything with him 
here, we couldn’t do much.

269
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:04,290
I told him, “Why are you weeping?” And 
then I discovered he was a patient created

270
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:13,600
by Lord Byron! I told him not to take this 
poet very seriously, and forget about it!

271
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,640
(laughing) He was just doing it to sell his 
books! But the fellow couldn’t get rid of

272
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,180
it, always he used to get into that mood, 
and very serious mood and this and that.

273
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,520
Then we sent him home.

274
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,760
I sent some Sahaja Yogis to his mother, father: 
very nice people, I must say.

275
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,900
They talked to me on the phone: very good 
people.

276
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,130
They said, “Mother, if you say, we’ll 
keep him in the house."

277
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:38,830
He’s a big man, he’s a big man about thirty 
years of age, you know.

278
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,430
And third day the mother said, “Better chuck 
him out of the house, Mother!” I said, “Why,

279
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,960
where will he go?” She said, “He is still 
doing the same thing.

280
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,020
He is in the room.

281
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,760
I have to serve him food.

282
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:59,500
I have to wash his things and he is just sitting 
and weeping there!” So because the sensitivity

283
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
is lost.

284
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Whom are you giving your heart?

285
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:08,650
To this Lord Byron, of all the persons?

286
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,610
This is the problem with us: we do not know 
who is auspicious.

287
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,450
For example, Blake people won’t like.

288
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:22,820
I mean the one who is the poet you have really, 
I would say, after Shakespeare.

289
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,190
I wonder if Shakespeare was one man or many 
people put together.

290
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,860
But Blake was the poet you had, the greatest 
of all I would say.

291
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,110
There were so many, also others.

292
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,290
Wordsworth was another.

293
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:40,360
You can see [that] those who talk of charming 
things or pleasant things and beautiful things

294
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,860
are the poets, not these garbage cleaners.

295
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:57,730
What is wrong with us that we cannot make 
out between the stink and the fragrance?

296
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,910
Auspiciousness is the way we emit our fragrance 
to others.

297
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:07,750
For example the other day two boys got Realisation 
and all the Sahaja Yogis ran just to feel

298
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,980
their vibrations and the rest were left behind.

299
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,510
Because they were enjoying the person, the 
vibrations of that person.

300
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,460
Then I shouted at them, I said, “Now, all 
right, now you have enjoyed, now go and see

301
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,100
others also there!” And they would not go 
near somebody who was thinking he was a great

302
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,960
man sitting down there.

303
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,130
Nobody would go near them.

304
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,160
They were holding their ears sitting here.

305
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,540
Then everybody avoiding to go to that man 
and the fellow must be feeling miserable,

306
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,460
I know that, but I went to him and worked 
it out.

307
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,960
But then I found that he was doing something 
very, very wrong himself.

308
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,750
And he said, “Mother, I am not evil."

309
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:47,530
I said, “No, it’s not evil but whatever 
you have done is evil, is to play into the

310
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,200
spirits, call them down, put on people and 
this.

311
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,730
Is an evil thing to do."

312
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,790
“I did not know, Mother."

313
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,960
I said, “All right.

314
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,450
It’s all right, if you did not know, it 
can be forgiven."

315
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:03,980
But this is what auspiciousness is: that you 
to feel it from your heart which is awakened.

316
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,030
The heart must be awakened.

317
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:18,850
In the heart resides the Spirit, which is 
not yet flowing in our consciousness, in our

318
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,420
central nervous system.

319
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:27,810
It resides there, the joy itself.

320
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:33,730
I don’t know if you have ever seen phosphorus 
taken out of the water and how it just gets

321
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,540
ignited, it is like that.

322
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:46,510
Inside the maya, the illusion, that spark 
is sitting down, and when this Kundalini rises

323
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:52,870
and touches that spark, it starts emitting 
its joy, its auspiciousness.

324
00:29:52,870 --> 00:30:00,570
Unless and until you have that within you, 
you cannot feel the auspiciousness of others.

325
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:09,240
Take a coconut, for example: put it the other 
way round, you won’t get vibrations.

326
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:15,610
If you put it this way [with] the coconut 
coming up you will get more vibrations.

327
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:24,600
There are certain coconuts who give you very 
good vibrations, some give horrible ones.

328
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:34,040
And you know human beings also have coconuts! 
(laughter) Some of the coconuts give such

329
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,820
beautiful vibrations and some of them do not.

330
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,200
Some of them are tired.

331
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,310
Some of them are nothing but like a balloon 
of Mr.

332
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,020
Ego.

333
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,830
Or some of them have nothing but superego 
in them.

334
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:58,320
So this coconut is to be made auspicious.

335
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:09,130
Now, how it is connected to the Spirit, that 
is a very important point: how our brain is

336
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,800
connected with Spirit.

337
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:17,960
Whatever I am telling you, you need not believe 
me but, you will find it out for yourself

338
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,920
that, whatever I am saying is the Truth.

339
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:34,530
Your heart has the Spirit, the light, and 
the heart has got seven auras around it.

340
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:46,610
And these seven auras get enlightened by the 
Spirit.

341
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:54,430
But before that it’s a very instantaneous 
or you can say a simultaneous happening.

342
00:31:54,430 --> 00:32:02,501
When the Kundalini rises there are seven centres 
also in our brain, in the sense [that] there

343
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,740
are the seats of the centres.

344
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,750
These seven centres are represented again 
on the seat, you know that very well.

345
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:14,660
All the Sahaja Yogis know where they are.

346
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:26,630
So when these centres are enlightened, the 
auras start shining in the heart.

347
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:32,230
And this centre (brahmarandhra) is actually 
the seat of the Spirit.

348
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,490
The Spirit has moved from there and has gone 
to the heart: that’s why in childhood you

349
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,000
will find there’s an opening here.

350
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,150
It’s a very soft bone, called as fontanelle 
bone, talu, is here.

351
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,060
Because the Spirit comes out from there and 
is settled on the heart.

352
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:57,810
You know, Spirit also comes out in the night 
sometimes, goes round and sees.

353
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,080
It’s so.

354
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:09,370
When these centres in our brain get enlightened 
by Kundalini, one by one, first they are enlightened

355
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:16,140
here, then in the brain, then the auras in 
the heart start getting enlightened.

356
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:26,110
Ultimately when this centre — which is the 
centre of the heart here, Sahastrara, in this

357
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:40,750
point — when this one gets enlightened, 
then the Spirit also gets enlightened, fully;

358
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:48,350
and then these auras become doubly shining.

359
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:55,740
Then the auspiciousness is in many dimensions 
starts expressing itself.

360
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:04,370
But to keep that light on, one has to keep 
the Kundalini over here.

361
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:09,109
Then what happens?

362
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:14,210
Then we are ruled by our heart’s indication 
[rather] than by our brain.

363
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,210
How?

364
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:24,759
Because the heart has the Spirit, which emits 
vibrations, it’s not the brain.

365
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:28,609
And you depend on your vibratory awareness 
after Realisation.

366
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:34,409
The more you depend on your vibratory awareness, 
the more you use your heart, your Spirit,

367
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:37,669
not your brain.

368
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:41,020
The more you use your brain: again you go 
down.

369
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:47,240
Because it is taken over now by the Spirit.

370
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,429
For example: after Realisation when you start 
thinking about it…I mean people can think

371
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:54,799
of anything! I mean I can tell you, I have 
had such experiences that they would think

372
00:34:54,799 --> 00:35:00,920
that, “Why Mataji is wearing a sari like 
this?” Even to this extent they can go to!

373
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,140
But if you can just leave your heart to work 
it out and don’t think, because you are

374
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
in thoughtless awareness after Realisation.

375
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:13,809
If you try to maintain that state, pay attention 
to your heart and let your Spirit emit itself

376
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:20,880
so that it clears out completely the confusion 
of the brain and everything; then you will

377
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,539
be amazed that you cannot lose your vibrations.

378
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:26,539
You cannot lose your Realisation.

379
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:36,420
The simplest way is — we have found like 
this — that after Realisation if you go

380
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,299
for seven days treatment with soaking feet 
before my photograph it works out.

381
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:48,160
But immediately when I say, “My photograph,”: 
finished! The ego comes up: “Why her photograph?”

382
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,490
First thing comes up: “Who is She?” I 
may be nothing — all right agreed, I am

383
00:35:54,490 --> 00:36:01,779
nothing — but I have raised your Kundalini!I 
have given you Realisation! I must be something

384
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:06,859
after all.

385
00:36:06,859 --> 00:36:07,859
So why worry?

386
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:12,789
I am not taking away anything from you.

387
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:18,940
Then you start establishing your auspiciousness, 
the sense of auspiciousness.

388
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:25,210
Once you have established it, then you do 
not lose it very easily.

389
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,210
You don’t like then inauspicious things, 
normally.

390
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:34,359
If there is somebody inauspicious you say, 
“Mother, no! We can’t do anything about

391
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:40,069
this gentleman!” Afterwards when you become 
very strong you don’t mind working on anyone

392
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:42,059
whatsoever.

393
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:43,869
But gradually you have to grow up to it.

394
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,070
I understand that.

395
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:50,019
But I can’t understand people using their 
rationality to understand Sahaja Yoga.

396
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:59,900
How can you understand this Great Power with 
your limited rationality?

397
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:13,510
I can explain to an ant about your politics 
but I cannot tell you how this Divine Power

398
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,779
works.

399
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:27,990
One day Djamel asked me, numerically: to what 
extent it goes, to what dimension?

400
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,099
And when I told him he said, “It is incalculable."

401
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:34,450
I said, “It is infinite! You cannot calculate."

402
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:42,630
If you put two mirrors facing each other and 
put some object in between, you cannot calculate

403
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:50,500
how many reflections you will get.

404
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,770
Even that you see but you cannot calculate.

405
00:37:52,770 --> 00:38:02,580
But here I am talking about something that 
does that, which creates this.

406
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:10,099
You cannot calculate all the molecules and 
the atoms of one element, but I am talking

407
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:20,309
about Somebody who has created them and who, 
in every molecule, pulsates.

408
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:24,519
How can you understand with this brain?

409
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,660
You can only become one with It and enjoy 
yourself! Why worry?

410
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:32,230
Why do you want to count the molecules?

411
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:39,730
Why this madness?

412
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:49,789
It would be like a madman going to the seashore 
to have a nice bath, starts counting the small

413
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:55,650
little pebbles and the grains of the sand.

414
00:38:55,650 --> 00:39:01,970
Get in! Enjoy! You become that.

415
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,089
This is advaita, were you become one.

416
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:08,210
All religions teach advaita.

417
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:16,059
Advait means were there is not the other, 
ananya.

418
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:17,900
You become one with that.

419
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,930
With the whole Ocean you become one.

420
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:23,269
[When] a drop becomes the ocean, all the powers 
of the oceans are there for the drop — that’s

421
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:24,269
what it is.

422
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:32,200
But there are some people, who say, “We 
believe in dwaita, No, we don’t want to

423
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
get lost."

424
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,630
You are not lost! You become the whole.

425
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,490
But they want to keep their small limitations, 
you see.

426
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:47,480
Now what is that small limitation they want 
to keep?

427
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:53,359
It’s called as Mr.

428
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:02,970
E G O, which is a myth, which is a myth.

429
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:09,240
It’s such a big myth is ego: because what 
do you do, human beings?

430
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,589
Let’s see now.

431
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:12,570
What do you do?

432
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,760
You make a chair all right.

433
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,730
You see, people are even proud if they can 
make a chair these days because nobody can

434
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:23,069
use their hands these days, you know that, 
with everything done by machines.

435
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:28,100
I don’t know they cannot create human beings 
otherwise they may try that also.

436
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,799
So what do you do?

437
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:35,950
You create something dead out of dead.

438
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,339
Everything is dead.

439
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:42,269
Whatever you have created is dead.

440
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:43,289
Have you done any living work?

441
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:45,130
So one lady got very angry with me.

442
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,930
She said, “Yes, we have created a tube baby!” 
I said, “You have not created, it was all

443
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,930
there.

444
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,930
The life was there.

445
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,539
You just brought it together and it worked 
out that way.

446
00:40:54,539 --> 00:41:04,279
It’s nothing!” It’s just like an egg 
being put it in the incubator.

447
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:05,529
It is that, simple thing.

448
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:10,569
You have done nothing! You have put life into 
it, have you?

449
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:11,769
Let us confess it now.

450
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:18,020
We cannot convert even one flower, transform 
one flower into a fruit.

451
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,310
Let us admit it.

452
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,589
So what is this ego, then?

453
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:27,859
“I do this and I do this,” “I would 
like that and I would have this” and “I,

454
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:28,859
I, I."

455
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:29,859
Who is this ‘Mr.

456
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:34,460
I’ who cannot do one living thing?

457
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:40,359
Just ask yourself! It’s a very simple question.

458
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:44,089
So you reach a conclusion: it’s a myth.

459
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:46,410
We do not do anything.

460
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:51,329
As many times I have told you that, some people 
going by train put all their luggage on their

461
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:52,329
heads.

462
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:55,499
So they said, “Why are you carrying so much 
luggage on your head?” They said, “Because

463
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:58,769
they want to reduce the weight of the train."

464
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:07,580
(laughter) This is just like that: put it 
on your head! “I do it! I do it! I do it!”

465
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,930
But by brainwashing you I cannot reduce it.

466
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,930
How [then]?

467
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:15,109
The myth has to be broken.

468
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:19,480
The myth breaks when Kundalini rises.

469
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,869
Then how you talk is a very different language: 
“It is not coming."

470
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:26,869
“It is not going."

471
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:27,869
It is ‘it’.

472
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:29,730
It becomes a third person.

473
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,190
Then your power which is flowing through your 
hands, you see that going through your hands,

474
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,190
which you are manoeuvring.

475
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:40,200
You don’t say, “I am giving you Realisation!” 
You just say, “It is going."

476
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,509
“It is rising."

477
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:43,269
“It is not coming."

478
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:48,349
Even if it is your son you will say, “I 
cannot give, now what to do?” Like a lady

479
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:53,619
came with me to America once and she was very 
anxious that I must give Realisation to her

480
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:54,619
son and all that.

481
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:56,809
So I told her, “Look at this.

482
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:59,460
Now you have come all the way, I know, for 
this purpose.

483
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:05,039
But now if the Kundalini doesn’t rise, should 
you want me to say that he is realised?”

484
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:06,809
“No, no, no, Mataji, I know it doesn’t 
rise."

485
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:08,589
Then I said, “You give him a Realisation.

486
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:09,690
I cannot give him, all right, you try."

487
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,089
Then, “But it doesn’t rise!” I said, 
“Then what to do?

488
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:17,980
If the Kundalini is not coming up, what can 
we do about it?”

489
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,749
So, the Kundalini has to come spontaneously.

490
00:43:20,749 --> 00:43:28,240
It’s a living process but after Realisation 
you start doing living things.

491
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,660
You can raise the Kundalini.

492
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,990
You can pulsate the Kundalini.

493
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:35,790
I don’t know about pulsation: so far I have 
not seen any Sahaja Yogi doing it.

494
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,920
But you can raise it all right.

495
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:45,900
You can give Realisation: with my photograph 
it works better.

496
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:54,140
You can give vibrations now to the plants, 
to the fruit, or to any, any flower like this.

497
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:59,480
If it is dying it will come to life.

498
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:07,680
If you give vibrations say, to a field of, 
or seeds of, wheat, they can be multiplied:

499
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,480
they can be ten times more than what they 
were.

500
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:18,769
Now you have started giving vibrations to 
the trees, to the people, you are doing the

501
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:19,769
living work.

502
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:22,869
Now you have become the ocean of life.

503
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:31,509
So far you were not because the power of life 
[which] is to give life has come in you!

504
00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:46,700
Now you are living, before this you were dead, 
in the sense that you were worshipping a dead

505
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,150
God called ‘ego’, now it’s the living 
God within you — is the Spirit.

506
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:58,660
Once you start accepting your Spirit all your 
priorities change just like that, because

507
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,020
Spirit is joy and happiness.

508
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:08,829
Spirit is the everything, so you start losing 
all your interest into other things.

509
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:15,509
This is what is, when your auspiciousness 
is of the greatest height that even your name

510
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:22,569
can create something great, and photograph 
can do wonders.

511
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:29,670
If you become auspiciousness, you are the 
holiest of the holy.

512
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:38,279
For that we have to get rid of some of the 
dirt and the dust, we have get rid of some

513
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:44,440
of the false notions that we have and myths 
of things: some people have the myth that

514
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:55,480
they are guilty and some people, as I told 
you, have so many myths.

515
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,510
But for giving up, this Kundalini works out.

516
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,579
You allow Her to work it out, that’s all.

517
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:01,579
It works.

518
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:03,390
It has worked with so many from England and 
I am very proud of my Sahaja Yogis of England.

519
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:13,310
If anybody asks me, “Where do you find the 
best young people?” I said, “It’s in

520
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,450
England,” and they are surprised.

521
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:37,049
They are not racialists, they are not all 
this nonsense of being fanatics, nothing.

522
00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:44,670
Except for druggists and chemists they are.

523
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:49,349
(laughter) That also due to mistakes.

524
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,849
But that I can correct.

525
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:55,480
But most of them are beautiful people, very 
sincere, very honest and very good.

526
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:10,819
Because England is the heart, is the heart 
of the universe, of the world.

527
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:14,059
Whatever happens in England gets known all 
over the world.

528
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:19,130
Do you know these people had this siege (at 
the Iranian Embassy in Kensington on 30/4/1980);

529
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,359
today I read in the paper they were giving 
an explanation about it, that, “We did it

530
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:26,710
in England, not because we wanted to kill 
anybody or anything, but we wanted to talk

531
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:30,650
to British government, so that if anything 
happens in London it will be known all over

532
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,650
the world."

533
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:36,220
People still think that British are still 
the sanest people in the West.

534
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,119
Still they think like that, which is the truth.

535
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:47,869
So, we have a very good group of people here, 
which has to expand.

536
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:53,170
You have to find out more and more who are 
seekers.

537
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,640
But don’t tell them just now that you have 
to give up any one of their druggists chemists

538
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,440
business, because if you tell them then they 
will run away.

539
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,930
We made a mistake like this, I know that.

540
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:07,420
No, they will just give up, you don’t worry.

541
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,910
Let them come.

542
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:18,190
Because once they have found it, even if we 
tell them [to], they will not go back.

543
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,940
Let them join.

544
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,700
Let them come.

545
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:26,910
By your auspiciousness, by your vibrations 
and the fragrance of the flowers let all the

546
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:34,140
bees start hovering, knowing that there is 
the scent of the beautiful nectar hidden under

547
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,320
these petals.

548
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,599
I am sure all of them will come and one day 
from England we’ll have the real spiritual

549
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,740
upsurge for the whole world.

550
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:49,130
May God bless you.
