00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.700
Please be seated.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.760
He's finished it? What happened?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.140
He's finished now?

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.840
[UNCLEAR] Have you finished or ...

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.700
I have finished. Mother, I meant that I just mentioned realization..

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.660
[UNCLEAR] All right, thank you.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.840
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.180
Yesterday, I explained to you, that

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.180
this power lies within you, is your own power

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.320
and once it is manifested, you will know how great you are.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.680
Just now, you are just thinking that you are an ordinary human-being

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.800
but once you are connected to the mains,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.940
then you realize what you are. Like this instrument is

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.840
without it is connected to the mains, it has no meaning - and then you understand your meaning.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.260
From human level to a higher level you have to move

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.200
to know what is Divinity is.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.160
This is a happening, this is  a becoming.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.160
Like a seed becomes a tree through a living process, you have to become the Spirit.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.320
Yesterday I told you,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.460
that I will be able to tell you today about the nature of the Spirit; What is the Spirit?

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.880
Of course, English language as you know, has it's limitations. Spirit means Atman -

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.260
the Spirit which is the reflection of God. Also spirit means alcohol,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.460
also it means the spirit which is a dead thing.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.700
So, we have to now know, only about the Atman, the One

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.760
which is the Self within ourselves.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.020
When you are enlightened by the awakening of this power within you

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:12.840
then, the light of the Spirit comes into your attention

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.720
and then your attention becomes enlightened.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.560
Through our Central Nervous System we express our attention

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.020
but in this nervous system

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.360
we have limitations. Firstly, we do not know the Absolute, the Absolute Truth -

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.980
we live in a relative world.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:48.180
But once the Spirit shines your attention, you see everything clearly.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.920
For example, we are all sitting here, there is light, we can see each other, we know how to relate to each other

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.260
and if we have to walk or to sit down,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.380
we know where to sit because we can see everything clearly but when

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.240
we're not enlightened, whatever ideas we have are mostly mental or emotional

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.840
or sometimes coming from our conditioning or from our ego.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.660
They do not relate to the Absolute and sometimes not at all to the reality.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.960
So you have to reach the point where you get the Absolute knowledge.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.840
Like, just now, I'm sitting before you, you all can see it - it's an Absolute knowledge, you know that I'm sitting here.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.380
But you will not know whether

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.880
you should have divorce or not,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.320
whether this person is suffering from some madness,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.080
or the other person who call himself a guru, is a real guru or false guru - you will not know.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.920
By reasoning you will not know, by rationality you will not know - you cannot find out about a person through rationality

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.420
so, there must be some method by which we can get the proof of what

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.160
is there really existing. So when the attention gets enlightened -

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:35.860
you have felt the other day the cool breeze on your finger-tips and you felt the cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.960
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, I said and the Holy Ghost is this All-Pervading power

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.740
which is reflected in us as this Kundalini.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:55.160
So when you know the Absolute, then you can feel it on your finger-tips,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.800
your own centers and centers of another person,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:08.300
so that you become collectively conscious. Means your consciousness develops a new awareness

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.540
where you are collectively conscious - you know about yourself and you know about others.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.080
Now you have to only know, how to correct

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:28.180
the centers, which you have found out to be out of place or something wrong with them or constricted.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.520
If you know how to do it, then you can get cured

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:40.540
and you can cure other people, not on physical but also mental, emotional and spiritual level.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.820
All this could be done, very easily, by you, once you get your Self-realization.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.560
Without that you cannot do it

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.540
because you do not have the idea of the inner problem that exists.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.480
Supposing there's a tree which is sick and you want to treat it.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:14.380
No use treating that tree through the leaves, through the branches, through the fruits or through the flowers.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.740
Best thing is to go to the roots and this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:26.540
We have the knowledge of the tree. This great civilization has grown so big

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.960
but it has not found out it's roots as yet. But as the tree was growing so big,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:41.880
also the roots were growing inside and this is the knowledge of the roots, which one has to

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.180
just now, listen to it with an open mind as a hypothesis.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.260
So, when these roots are within us -

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:57.440
is described in the Bible as the tree of life. I mean, I'm not telling something which was not described.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:05.020
Also, this is said that, "I'll appear before you like tongues of flames,"

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.640
and that's how all these chakras look like tongues of flames, specially

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:16.780
the Sahastrara, the last chakra looks like beautiful flames of seven colors

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:25.060
and they're burning so smoothly, as if there's no heat in it but some sort of a peace.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:33.700
All this, whatever I'm saying, has to have a proof and that proof you can only get

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.680
when you transcend this human awareness into your spiritual awareness.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.920
So the first thing that happens to you, that you become collectively conscious.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:54.860
The second thing, I told you, that you become thoughtlessly aware - to begin with - means you can remain in the present

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.020
without thinking. Whenever you want you can think, whenever you don't want you need not think.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.220
As a result of that you become a very peaceful personality.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:13.200
If there's a crisis, suddenly you jump into that position where you're thoughtlessly aware.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:20.740
Like, as I told you yesterday, that if you're standing in the sea water, you're afraid of the waves

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.800
but if you get to the boat you can see all that. In the same way,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.440
you just jump on to that state of mind -

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:38.260
mind is a wrong word, I should say, because you go beyond mind also - but you go into that state of being

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.420
where you just see the whole thing as a play - you become a witness.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:50.860
You become a witness of the whole play and because you're outside the problem, you can solve it much better.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:58.320
Also you have a Divine help by which you can solve your problems and the problems of others.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:05.860
So the third thing which is very important for the Spirit, is that you know the truth.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:15.380
Put ten children together who are realized souls and tie their eyes and ask somebody to face.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:24.560
The children will immediately show the same finger, all of them. Supposing they show this finger, you go and ask the person,

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:31.600
"Have you got some trouble with your throat?" "Yes I have, I have a throat cancer but how do you know?"

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:38.480
"Because these children have told us. These children what have they told us - just the finger which was burning very badly.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:46.880
So, must be the cancer or could be some serious because it's burning so badly." And they start, children will start rubbing them and clearing them.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:54.780
When you know gradually through experience

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:01.380
that whatever you are recording on your hands is the truth,

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.260
then you start accepting it as the truth,

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:12.660
then your awareness that is human awareness goes to a new awareness called as vibratory awareness.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:19.900
When your hands are vibrating, you're feeling this cool breeze in your hand and you can feel

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:27.960
your own centers and the centers of others - sometimes they burn, sometimes you get a kind of a tingling,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:33.500
sometimes you get pins and needles or sometimes you also get little burning.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:40.500
If it's a very horrid person, then might get a little blister for a while just to indicate - you become like a barometer.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:46.060
But you don't feel bad about it because you just feel it like a barometer and you know what's the problem

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.540
with the other person is and also your own problem.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:55.140
So, you know the truth about everything. You want to find out about anyone,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:02.780
you want to know about any book, you want to know about any kind of a knowledge

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:10.840
if it is true or not - you have to just put your hands and ask, "Is this the truth?"

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:19.800
"Is there God?" Many people say, "We don't believe in God." I think, is very unscientific to say like that, "We don't believe in God."

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:25.180
Because you have not yet found it out. Unless and until you found out there is God or not,

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.780
how can you say that, "I don't believe in God," - it is great arrogance, I think.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.880
So is best is, to find out. If you ask a question, "Is there God," -

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.220
if you are realized soul,  immediately you'll start getting tremendous vibrations.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.060
That is how it works and gradually, you don't have to

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:52.740
see on your vibrations but you just know the truth - you just know it what is the truth.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:59.720
Immediately as soon as you see the person, you know about him, as soon as you listen to someone, you know about him -

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.960
it's becomes very clear and vivid. There's no problem then how to find out

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:12.880
what is the truth - so you get all the proofs of it, all the proofs of it.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.680
Now the third thing,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.200
which I've told you, is the spiritual part of it.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.920
Of course, you become a witness, you become absolutely peaceful

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.620
and the most important thing that you get is the joy.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.060
Joy is not like happiness and unhappiness.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.140
Unhappiness comes when your ego is hurt

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.440
or your conditionings are hurt, your emotions are hurt

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:57.000
and you feel happy when ego is pampered or your emotions are substantiated.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.460
But joy is something which doesn't have this double face - joy is Absolute.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.880
So, you start enjoying everything. For example, now see there's a beautiful carpet here,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.200
I watch it without thinking

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:19.340
and whatever the artist has put the joy in it, starts pouring on My head

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.480
just like a soothing river Ganges, as they say

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.860
because I don't think about it, I'm just watching it.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:37.660
Artist must have involved himself with great joy to do it in an abstract way but that all abstract,

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.140
just reflects on Me and starts flowing down.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:52.340
This joy becomes then the main nourishing factor in your life.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.960
Your family life changes, husband wife's relations change,

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.680
children's relations change, relation of the whole

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.780
sahaja yoga brotherhood comes absolutely spontaneously.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:14.940
I don't have to tell you to 'Love thy neighbor' - you just love, you enjoy.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.600
The first time you enjoy another personality.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:26.620
For example now, they must have told you, we are working in fifty-five nations, it's more than that, I think, but still fifty-five

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.180
is all right to make it look all right.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:36.700
These fifty-five nations have got people of different nature,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.780
different temperament, different culture, different

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.640
uh.. races, different religions and when they meet

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:55.680
they look so beautiful, they never fight, they never argue,

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:04.500
they never think of jealousies, there's no hatred of any kind,

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:10.340
they do not value you what your skin is or what your position is

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.120
everyone feels that they are part and parcel of the whole

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.820
and enjoy each other. If there's a problem -

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.780
first when I went to Russia first, who came there you'll be surprised

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.340
were the Germans, just came rushing to help Me.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.260
I said, "How are you here?" "Mother, don't you think, is our responsibility?"

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:45.380
Really, I was filled with joy and tears. I said look at these Germans and they became so gentle with them,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:52.940
so gentle with the Russians that Russians were amazed how these Germans could be so gentle!

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.960
But the feeling that they had that these Russians must be brought

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:06.860
to reality, so that they'll have better life, like we are enjoying, they should also enjoy.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.140
This joy is so great that people want to spread it.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:21.540
As you know that I'm a housewife, I have children, I have grandchildren and I'm very busy otherwise also

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:28.720
but I can't help it, I have to travel for this joy because I cannot enjoy it Myself,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.440
I must enjoy it with all of you and it's very simple that you can achieve the state

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.800
of your Spirit because it's very important.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:47.860
This is for the emancipation for the whole world because all our problems come from us only, from human-beings.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:54.820
Once they're transformed, you'll be amazed how things work out.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.400
Also materially, I've seen, all of them are very much helped

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:07.800
because they become so smart, so intelligent, so compassionate, so good, that somehow or the other, everything works out.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:14.420
I was asking them, "Is there anybody unemployed in sahaja yoga?"

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:21.280
They said, "None." In Australia, can you imagine? But in England, which is much worse,

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:26.100
there's nobody unemployed in sahaja yoga - everybody is doing very well.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.880
You ask them, "How are you?" "Oh Mother, we're swimming in the ocean of joy."

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.920
All those complaints, all those aggressions, everything has disappeared

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:44.580
and they have become such beautiful people like angels, absolutely like angels

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:52.500
and you all are capable of becoming that. You all have those powers, just you have to get them

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.940
and you have to desire, you have to desire and that's how it is going to work out.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:10.580
It is such a big subject and I must have given at least four to five thousand lectures, in only in English language

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:15.260
and many in other languages. So you can imagine that

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:22.440
this subject cannot be covered in one or two days but I'm sorry I cannot uh.. spend more time

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:29.460
in Melbourne or in Australia also. That's My life is but whatever it is,

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.900
what you have to get is your Self-realization.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.160
After getting the Self-realization, though the Kundalini has

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:47.000
got out of your fontanel bone area, has touched the mains, everything is there, but still there's [UNCLEAR - I MEAN?] a very

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:53.700
small part of Kundalini is, few threads of Kundalini have done that

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.300
and also there are problems with your physical side or mental side, emotional side - whatever it is -

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:04.420
so it has to go back to correct you. It goes back to correct you again and again

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:10.900
so you have to only learn how to make this connection perfect and whole being to be purified.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:17.480
Now for that you don't have to go to Himalayas or do any kind of penance, sacrifice, fasting - nothing,

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.040
it's not needed at all. Only thing, you have to come to the collective.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:29.740
We have very simple type of collective because we don't take money or anything - you can't pay for it - it's so invaluable that you can't pay.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.340
How much will you pay? How much do we pay to Mother Earth for these beautiful flowers?

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.660
You can't pay for it. So people, who are sahaja yogies,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:45.960
have, somehow or the other, gathered a little money and they have a little place where they're having meditation forum - it's a humble place.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:51.560
You should humble down and come there and join the collective.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:57.420
Once you join the collective, you'll be amazed that you'll be cleansed automatically.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.600
Automatically you'll be cleansed, also they'll tell you how to meditate at home.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.120
Just try and you'll be amazed that

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.300
you are really glorious, you are really beautiful

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.660
and there is a purpose to our life. We are not born

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.700
just by chance - there's a very big purpose

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:24.240
and when you discover that you'll know your value and your identity.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:33.540
So, May God bless you! I'm very happy today you're all here, we should uh..

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.900
now have the session for meditation by which

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.880
I'm sure, you all can get your realization - I have no doubts about it.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.160
You see, I can go on talking for hours but, I think, talking is not going to help.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:01.100
But some people have questions, I don't mind answering the questions.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:07.160
But the questions should be relevant, please and should be

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.760
such that you really desire to have your Self-realization

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:20.580
because I'm not here to take anything from you, it's your own property, everything, I may just give you the key.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:29.740
And if you ask Me any questions - of course, I'm quite an expert now because I've be doing this for the last

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:37.580
twenty-one years, so, I'm quite an expert but even if I answer your question, that doesn't guarantee that you'll get your realization,

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:44.260
doesn't guarantee - it's just a mental feat. So, what you have to think of is your Self-realization

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.200
that you should all get it - that is to be desired.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.580
- Doesn't appear to be any questions, Shri Mataji
- Umm?
- There are no questions.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:10.420
Are you sure? [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] All right. They're wonderful people, really.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:16.960
This time I'm really meeting very beautiful people in Australia, really, I must tell you.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.460
Even in Perth, there were such nice people - all of them got realization.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:28.320
And yesterday also you saw, how everybody got realization. But now the connection

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.780
has to be established permanently. For that you have to give some time -

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.380
that's the main thing, we don't give any time to ourselves.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:46.360
After all, we have these watches all the time to save the time but to save the time, to waste it.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.860
We have to give little time to ourselves, to our realization

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:58.800
and morning and evening, say five minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening, if you do meditation at home, is all right.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:05.980
Once a week they meet where you can go - they'll give you all the necessary information that you want, whatever you want

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:14.420
and you don't have to pay anything. If they ask any money, you let Me know - they will never ask.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:25.080
Wonderful!

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:43.220
So at the very outset, I have to tell you, that I respect your freedom.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:51.300
Human-beings have been given freedom to choose and I cannot force on you

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:56.340
Self-realization - no, I cannot. It cannot be done.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.540
So, you have to have that desire within you

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:06.620
and Kundalini is the power of pure desire within you because all other desires

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.940
are never satiable, in general.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:16.120
So you have to have desire within you  that you want to have your realization.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:24.420
Now the first condition is, that you have to be absolutely self-confident.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.060
You shouldn't have diffidence about yourself - how can I get it,

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.980
how will it work it out?

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.900
We have so many ideas about ourselves and we start judging ourselves

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.020
Please don't judge yourself. Your Kundalini will judge

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.080
and She will tell you what is wrong with you and She will manage you.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.420
She has been waiting all these years to give you this second birth - She's your mother.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.580
She will find Her way and She'll manage everything. You don't have to

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:03.060
trouble yourself and tell yourself that this is wrong with me, that is wrong with me.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:11.240
So first of all, you must have full self-confidence that we are going to get Self-realization

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:18.840
and that we are going to grow completely into our spiritual awareness. You have please, that self-confidence in yourself.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:24.640
Whatever you might have done, forget it at this moment. You have to be in the present and here

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.740
you're perfectly all right and suitable for your ascent.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:34.460
The another thing is that, you don't have to think you're guilty

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.860
This is also another, I think, like a fashion, everybody feels guilty.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.780
What is there to feel guilty, what wrong have you done. After all you are human-beings. If the human-beings

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:52.660
make mistakes, what's wrong with that? You're not gods - if you've done mistakes, it's all right.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:28:00.080
Forget about it but don't feel guilty. If you feel guilty, then this center here, on the left side, catches

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.960
which is a terrible center because it gives you horrible diseases like Angina,

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:13.640
it gives you Spondylitis, also it gives you lethargic organs - so please, don't feel guilty.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:19.100
I don't know how this idea came into the people who were in charge of

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:25.000
religion and God, that you all should feel guilty - is wrong.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:32.980
Absolutely wrong that you should suffer - this is another wrong. Christ has suffered for us -

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:38.120
are we going to suffer more than Him? We don't have to suffer.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:45.220
All these ideas must be that you suffer, you fast and give us the money - must be that.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:52.720
I just can't understand, why to tell somebody to suffer - because God Almighty is your Father.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.720
and He is the essence of fatherhood.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:06.600
He's the greatest father you could think of and how can any loving father want his children to suffer?

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.580
Logically you must understand this -

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:16.360
why should you suffer? He's created all this beautiful world for you

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.420
You should not suffer at all - so the idea of suffering should go away.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:27.200
It's becoming too much these days, the way people are taking to sufferings, for nothing at all.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:36.160
There are so many such principles, uh.. which are being sold in the market, that you have to suffer.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:41.220
And there was one in England which came to say, that you must go to Gobi desert.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:48.980
And now, Gobi desert if you go, you'll get Nirvana according to them. Of course you'll die, that's the Nirvana you'll get, no doubt.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:53.440
The simple thing is to go to Gobi desert without any water -

00:29:53.580 --> 00:30:00.580
within say, five, six minutes, you will die - there's nothing will be left out of you, so there's nothing to uh..

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.860
suffer but it's a straight forward march to your death, that's all.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:13.100
So all these nonsensical ideas are to be given up. Nobody has to suffer,

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:21.080
nobody has to think that they have to fast - of course, if you want to fast for your health, [UNCLEAR] that's different - but not for God.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:27.800
Is something uh... so absurd

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:37.980
and ridiculous to make someone suffer, to tell somebody that you're a sinner - is all absurdly very cruel also,

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.880
extremely cruel, while this All-Pervading power is the love of God.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.340
He loves us. This is what

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.900
we should see in any person who talks of God or talks of religion.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.880
That's what they all said but the religions have gone, you know where they have gone to

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.120
because they didn't seek the truth, they didn't seek the Spirit.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:16.780
If they had deviated, they are responsible for such a thing.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.080
They need not have done all this; They should have, really, found out what is reality.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.600
But they were very much against people who found out

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:31.480
and tortured them, troubled them, killed them - did all kinds of things.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:41.000
But now, they cannot do anything because now this All-Pervading power has become dynamic.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:47.400
It looks after you, it protects, it worries about you - no one can touch you.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.140
Those days are gone when saints had to suffer.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:03.760
So just now, in short, you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:11.240
not to be angry with yourself or anything. Just to be very pleasantly placed that you are a human-being

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:19.940
and the epitome of evolution and that you have to just travel a little more to reach there.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:31.760
All right. The third condition which is also another very simple one is this

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.540
that you have to forgive everyone.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.820
As I told you the other day, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - actually you don't do anything.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.560
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:57.180
But always I've seen people say, it's very difficult to forgive. What is difficult - just to say, "I forgive everyone," - finished.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:05.200
In general you forgive. Don't think of those people because by thinking about them also you play into wrong hands.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:13.180
So just forgive all of them. Just try, it's very simple, just to say - it's a mantra you can call it.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:20.020
"I forgive all of them, in general," just say that and you'll feel much lighter within yourself,

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:25.860
much better, just forgive. Why to carry this load on your head for nothing at all.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:39.680
I hope, you'll fulfill these three conditions which are very simple. One is the self-confidence,

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:45.900
second is no guilt and the third one is forgiving everyone.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.260
All right, so now we are placed very pleasantly towards ourselves

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:59.260
and we're sure we're going to get our Self-realization. We have to enter into the Kingdom of God - how can you be guilty?

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.520
All right, so now

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:16.220
there's one request is to take out your shoes because that helps you a lot to clear out your

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:24.160
problems by the Mother Earth. She's very kind, She's the kindest thing that you can think of.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:52.760
Now, please put both the feet apart from each other

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.580
because the left side

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:03.100
is for your power of desire, ordinary desire.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:10.100
Kundalini is for pure desire and the right side is for your action.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.860
Now we'll tell you in the beginning, how we're going to proceed

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.880
and then you can close your eyes. I hope you're pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:36.600
Now, please put your left hand towards Me, like this, on your lap, on your lap very comfortably. You don't have to do anything

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:43.220
uh.. which is troublesome or painful, just like this and the right hand on your heart.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:50.180
Left hand on your lap and right hand on your heart.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:56.620
In the heart resides the Spirit

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:04.980
and if this Spirit comes into your attention, then you have

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:12.360
the light of the Spirit and in that light you become your own guide,

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:21.120
you become your own master, you become your own guru. So please,

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:29.440
now take your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now, this is the center of

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:37.240
your mastery which is created by great masters for you.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:49.460
Now, please take your right hand the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:37:00.180
This is the center for pure knowledge. Whatever knowledge we have, is not pure knowledge

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:05.100
but this is pure knowledge because it gives you the knowledge about

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.920
the laws of the Divine.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:14.220
It makes you capable of working it out.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:22.320
This is the pure knowledge you should have. Of course, we have another kind of knowledge, as you know, is black magic, this and that

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.640
but this is pure knowledge of the Divine.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.940
Now, you raise your right hand, in the upper portion of the abdomen again, and push it down.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.840
This is the center again of, as I told you, of your mastery.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:43.600
Then you put your hand on your heart where resides the Spirit.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:51.940
Now you raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your face to your right.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:59.700
Now this is the center, I've already told you, when it is out of gear, you get diseases like Angina -

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:05.980
so, don't feel guilty. Just now, I feel, all of you have this one the worst.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.640
What is there to feel guilty, I don't know.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:19.360
Please don't feel guilty. All right, now you have to take your right hand on your forehead across -

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:25.500
you can put it this way that on one side your fingers, another side your

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:33.740
thumb and you can press it. Now, bend your head slowly forward, as far as possible.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:39.320
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:47.320
Now, please take this right hand on the back side of your head, back side of your head, on the optic lobe

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.460
and hold it tight. Now, push back your head as far as possible.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:39:00.300
Now, this is the center where, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:07.220
just for your own satisfaction, you have to ask for forgiveness from

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.400
this All-Pervading power of love.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:17.360
Now, the last center is the most important. Stretch your hands, stretch your palm, push back your fingers.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:23.520
Put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area,

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:29.800
which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now, put down your head as far as possible,

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:36.780
press it hard, by pushing out your fingers only, that's important. Now, push the scalp

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.200
and move it seven times clockwise, slowly, move it seven times clockwise.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.880
Please put down your head, put down your head.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.420
That's all is to be done, that's all. Now

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:10.800
again, please take out your shoes, put your feet apart from each other, please put left hand towards Me.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:16.040
You can take out your spectacles, also if there's something

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:21.240
tight on your neck or on your waist, you may take it out

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:31.800
or say, loosen it I mean to say, if there's something, just take out the pressure, if there is any. That's all.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.820
Now, please put the left hand towards Me on your lap

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.920
comfortably and the right hand on your heart.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:53.260
Close the eyes, please close the eyes and don't open them till I tell you.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.180
Please close the eyes, you can remove your spectacles also.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:06.940
Now here, you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself,

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:14.940
three times in your heart - you can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:23.080
Now the question is, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:45.520
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your master.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:53.980
So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it little hard.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.760
Here you have to ask another fundamental question in your heart,

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.920
"Mother, am I my own master?"

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:18.120
I have already told you that I respect your freedom

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.340
so I cannot force

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.600
pure knowledge on you.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:37.180
So now, take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side,

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:53.280
press it hard. Here you have to say, I mean you have to ask -

00:42:53.540 --> 00:43:00.580
because I cannot force pure knowledge on you - six times because this center has got six petals,

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.900
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:42.480
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising upward, so we have

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:47.200
to nourish the upper centers with our self-confidence.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:54.220
So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it and here

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:59.500
you have to say with full confidence, ten times,

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:07.940
"Mother, I am my own master, Mother, I am my own master,"

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:12.660
or, "Mother, I am my own guru."

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:32.080
The fundamental truth about you is that you're not this body, this mind,

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:40.080
this ego, these conditionings, these emotions but you are pure Spirit.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:47.500
So now, raise your hand on top of your heart and here

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:52.100
you have to say with full confidence again, twelve times,

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.240
"Mother, I am pure Spirit."

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:04.980
Twelve times, "Mother, I am pure Spirit."

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.240
This All-Pervading power

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:30.260
of love is the ocean of knowledge,

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:36.240
is the ocean of compassion and blisses

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:42.900
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:49.360
and whatever you may do - mistakes as they call them

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:57.920
can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:11.140
So now, raise your right hand

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:21.040
into the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put your head to your right.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.400
Here you have to say with full confidence,

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:37.580
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please say it sixteen times because this has sixteen petals.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:45.840
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please say it with full confidence, sixteen times.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:05.000
I've already told you, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:12.840
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and suffer,

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:20.620
torture yourself, while the person who has tortured you or troubled you, is quite happy.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:30.960
So please, you have to forgive all those, in general,

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:35.540
who have given you trouble.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:43.240
So now, please take your right hand on top of your forehead, put it across

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:50.380
with fingers on one side and the thumb on the other and now, put it down your head.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:56.160
Press it and put it down. Here you have to say,

00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:00.560
not how many times but from your heart,

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:06.380
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:14.120
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general." This you have to say

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:26.420
with full confidence, with your heart, from your heart -

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:36.960
not how many times. It's very important because this is a very constricted

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:44.680
center and if you don't say this and you don't forgive all of them, Kundalini won't rise, so please,

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:53.200
you have to say it from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:03.260
Now, take back your right hand on the back side of your head

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:06.580
and push back your head as far as possible.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:17.780
Here again, you have to say it from your heart, not how many times, without counting your mistakes,

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:23.140
without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction,

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:28.840
you have to say from your heart, not how many times, again I say,

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:36.660
"Oh Divine power, if I have done

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.120
anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:48.000
"Oh Divine power, if I have done anything wrong

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:52.120
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:07.880
Now, stretch your hand fully

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:17.540
and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:26.320
and here you have to push back your fingers and put down your head.

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:34.040
Now again, I respect your freedom and I cannot force Self-realization on you.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:41.640
So, you have to move your scalp with a pressure, seven times, very slowly,

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:47.300
saying seven times, "Mother, please give me Self-realization.

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:54.720
Mother, please give me Self-realization." You have to say this seven times.

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.940

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:29.800
Now please take down your hands, please open your eyes slowly.

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:36.060
Please put both the hands, like this, towards Me, little higher.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.980
Now watch Me without thinking.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:53.680
Now, put the right hand towards Me like this, and

00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.620
put the left hand on top of the fontanel bone area.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:05.780
The fontanel bone area doesn't mean that you touch it but away from it

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:14.000
just hold it, bend your head and just hold it and see for yourself if there's a cool or a warm

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:20.040
breeze like waves are coming out of your fontanel bone area.

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:25.840
You have to certify, please try to put it little away from your head.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:32.960
Sometimes it can be quite far away so be careful, move your hand up and down and see for yourself,

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.520
if there's a cool or a warm breeze coming out of your head.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:45.940
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, it can be warm - if you've not forgiven it would be quite warm - so please forgive even now.

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:54.460
Now try with the left hand. Put down your right, head again and see with your right hand,

00:52:54.720 --> 00:53:02.480
if there's a cool breeze or a warm breeze like waves coming through your fontanel bone area.

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:11.880
Now again with the right hand, again put down your head and see for yourself

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:18.240
if there's a cool breeze or a warm breeze like waves

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.040
are coming out of your fontanel bone area.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.740
Now, raise both your hands towards the sky, push back your head

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:39.580
and now here you have to ask one of these following questions, one of them,

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:44.220
three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:53.660
or, "Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of God's love?" or "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya,

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:59.420
is this the Brahma Chaitanya?" Ask one of these questions three times in your heart.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.440
Now please take down your hands.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:18.700
You'll feel very relaxed.

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:27.480
All those who have felt cool or warm breeze out of their fontanel bone area

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:35.140
or on their finger-tips or on their hands, please raise both your hands, please raise both your hands.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:44.040
[UNCLEAR] You didn't feel it? All right, let's see.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.560
You feel it here. She's got it but she's not feeling, maybe.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:56.620
Practically all of you. May God bless you! I bow to you all saints, really, I bow to you.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:05.280
Most of you have felt it. There's only one or two exceptions. May God bless you! So beautiful it is!

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:11.200
She's got it but it's all right, she's not feeling, it's all right.

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:16.640
She has to feel, she has to certify - it will work out.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.820
Now, we have a follow on. I don't know...

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:31.420
Also I would like to meet you all today, as I told you yesterday. Those who want to meet Me can come up  and I would like to meet them.
