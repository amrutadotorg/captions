00:01.700 --> 00:04.700
Please be seated.

00:11.420 --> 00:15.760
He's finished it? What happened?

00:18.140 --> 00:21.140
He's finished now?

00:44.660 --> 00:49.840
[UNCLEAR] Have you finished or ...

00:50.080 --> 00:53.700
I have finished. Mother, I meant that I just mentioned realization..

01:38.600 --> 01:42.660
[UNCLEAR] All right, thank you.

01:49.300 --> 01:52.840
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:59.360 --> 02:05.180
Yesterday, I explained to you, that

02:05.760 --> 02:11.180
this power lies within you, is your own power

02:11.920 --> 02:18.320
and once it is manifested, you will know how great you are.

02:18.700 --> 02:25.680
Just now, you are just thinking that you are an ordinary human-being

02:26.760 --> 02:29.800
but once you are connected to the mains,

02:30.940 --> 02:36.940
then you realize what you are. Like this instrument is

02:37.180 --> 02:43.840
without it is connected to the mains, it has no meaning - and then you understand your meaning.

02:45.080 --> 02:50.260
From human level to a higher level you have to move

02:50.740 --> 02:55.200
to know what is Divinity is.

02:58.280 --> 03:04.160
This is a happening, this is  a becoming.

03:04.440 --> 03:11.160
Like a seed becomes a tree through a living process, you have to become the Spirit.

03:11.380 --> 03:14.320
Yesterday I told you,

03:14.600 --> 03:21.460
that I will be able to tell you today about the nature of the Spirit; What is the Spirit?

03:22.420 --> 03:29.880
Of course, English language as you know, has it's limitations. Spirit means Atman -

03:30.780 --> 03:38.260
the Spirit which is the reflection of God. Also spirit means alcohol,

03:38.580 --> 03:43.460
also it means the spirit which is a dead thing.

03:44.560 --> 03:50.700
So, we have to now know, only about the Atman, the One

03:50.980 --> 03:54.760
which is the Self within ourselves.

03:58.320 --> 04:04.020
When you are enlightened by the awakening of this power within you

04:05.380 --> 04:12.840
then, the light of the Spirit comes into your attention

04:13.480 --> 04:17.720
and then your attention becomes enlightened.

04:18.980 --> 04:24.560
Through our Central Nervous System we express our attention

04:25.000 --> 04:29.020
but in this nervous system

04:30.080 --> 04:36.360
we have limitations. Firstly, we do not know the Absolute, the Absolute Truth -

04:36.900 --> 04:39.980
we live in a relative world.

04:40.760 --> 04:48.180
But once the Spirit shines your attention, you see everything clearly.

04:48.580 --> 04:55.920
For example, we are all sitting here, there is light, we can see each other, we know how to relate to each other

04:56.480 --> 05:00.260
and if we have to walk or to sit down,

05:00.640 --> 05:06.380
we know where to sit because we can see everything clearly but when

05:06.760 --> 05:13.240
we're not enlightened, whatever ideas we have are mostly mental or emotional

05:14.260 --> 05:19.840
or sometimes coming from our conditioning or from our ego.

05:20.780 --> 05:27.660
They do not relate to the Absolute and sometimes not at all to the reality.

05:28.820 --> 05:33.960
So you have to reach the point where you get the Absolute knowledge.

05:34.240 --> 05:39.840
Like, just now, I'm sitting before you, you all can see it - it's an Absolute knowledge, you know that I'm sitting here.

05:41.980 --> 05:46.380
But you will not know whether

05:47.600 --> 05:50.880
you should have divorce or not,

05:52.160 --> 05:56.320
whether this person is suffering from some madness,

05:56.800 --> 06:03.080
or the other person who call himself a guru, is a real guru or false guru - you will not know.

06:03.460 --> 06:10.920
By reasoning you will not know, by rationality you will not know - you cannot find out about a person through rationality

06:11.760 --> 06:18.420
so, there must be some method by which we can get the proof of what

06:19.000 --> 06:26.160
is there really existing. So when the attention gets enlightened -

06:27.880 --> 06:35.860
you have felt the other day the cool breeze on your finger-tips and you felt the cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area.

06:36.720 --> 06:42.960
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, I said and the Holy Ghost is this All-Pervading power

06:43.420 --> 06:46.740
which is reflected in us as this Kundalini.

06:48.140 --> 06:55.160
So when you know the Absolute, then you can feel it on your finger-tips,

06:55.520 --> 06:59.800
your own centers and centers of another person,

07:00.320 --> 07:08.300
so that you become collectively conscious. Means your consciousness develops a new awareness

07:09.320 --> 07:15.540
where you are collectively conscious - you know about yourself and you know about others.

07:16.020 --> 07:19.080
Now you have to only know, how to correct

07:20.700 --> 07:28.180
the centers, which you have found out to be out of place or something wrong with them or constricted.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.520
If you know how to do it, then you can get cured

07:33.900 --> 07:40.540
and you can cure other people, not on physical but also mental, emotional and spiritual level.

07:41.100 --> 07:45.820
All this could be done, very easily, by you, once you get your Self-realization.

07:46.480 --> 07:50.560
Without that you cannot do it

07:51.560 --> 07:57.540
because you do not have the idea of the inner problem that exists.

08:01.500 --> 08:06.480
Supposing there's a tree which is sick and you want to treat it.

08:07.220 --> 08:14.380
No use treating that tree through the leaves, through the branches, through the fruits or through the flowers.

08:14.740 --> 08:19.740
Best thing is to go to the roots and this is the knowledge of the roots.

08:20.280 --> 08:26.540
We have the knowledge of the tree. This great civilization has grown so big

08:28.280 --> 08:33.960
but it has not found out it's roots as yet. But as the tree was growing so big,

08:34.500 --> 08:41.880
also the roots were growing inside and this is the knowledge of the roots, which one has to

08:42.380 --> 08:47.180
just now, listen to it with an open mind as a hypothesis.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.260
So, when these roots are within us -

08:51.580 --> 08:57.440
is described in the Bible as the tree of life. I mean, I'm not telling something which was not described.

08:59.540 --> 09:05.020
Also, this is said that, "I'll appear before you like tongues of flames,"

09:05.260 --> 09:09.640
and that's how all these chakras look like tongues of flames, specially

09:09.880 --> 09:16.780
the Sahastrara, the last chakra looks like beautiful flames of seven colors

09:17.180 --> 09:25.060
and they're burning so smoothly, as if there's no heat in it but some sort of a peace.

09:27.760 --> 09:33.700
All this, whatever I'm saying, has to have a proof and that proof you can only get

09:34.000 --> 09:40.680
when you transcend this human awareness into your spiritual awareness.

09:41.480 --> 09:46.920
So the first thing that happens to you, that you become collectively conscious.

09:47.620 --> 09:54.860
The second thing, I told you, that you become thoughtlessly aware - to begin with - means you can remain in the present

09:55.080 --> 10:00.020
without thinking. Whenever you want you can think, whenever you don't want you need not think.

10:01.060 --> 10:05.220
As a result of that you become a very peaceful personality.

10:06.200 --> 10:13.200
If there's a crisis, suddenly you jump into that position where you're thoughtlessly aware.

10:13.940 --> 10:20.740
Like, as I told you yesterday, that if you're standing in the sea water, you're afraid of the waves

10:21.040 --> 10:26.800
but if you get to the boat you can see all that. In the same way,

10:27.280 --> 10:31.440
you just jump on to that state of mind -

10:31.780 --> 10:38.260
mind is a wrong word, I should say, because you go beyond mind also - but you go into that state of being

10:38.780 --> 10:43.420
where you just see the whole thing as a play - you become a witness.

10:43.860 --> 10:50.860
You become a witness of the whole play and because you're outside the problem, you can solve it much better.

10:51.220 --> 10:58.320
Also you have a Divine help by which you can solve your problems and the problems of others.

10:59.400 --> 11:05.860
So the third thing which is very important for the Spirit, is that you know the truth.

11:07.360 --> 11:15.380
Put ten children together who are realized souls and tie their eyes and ask somebody to face.

11:17.380 --> 11:24.560
The children will immediately show the same finger, all of them. Supposing they show this finger, you go and ask the person,

11:24.700 --> 11:31.600
"Have you got some trouble with your throat?" "Yes I have, I have a throat cancer but how do you know?"

11:31.980 --> 11:38.480
"Because these children have told us. These children what have they told us - just the finger which was burning very badly.

11:38.840 --> 11:46.880
So, must be the cancer or could be some serious because it's burning so badly." And they start, children will start rubbing them and clearing them.

11:48.780 --> 11:54.780
When you know gradually through experience

11:55.240 --> 12:01.380
that whatever you are recording on your hands is the truth,

12:02.080 --> 12:06.260
then you start accepting it as the truth,

12:07.140 --> 12:12.660
then your awareness that is human awareness goes to a new awareness called as vibratory awareness.

12:13.040 --> 12:19.900
When your hands are vibrating, you're feeling this cool breeze in your hand and you can feel

12:20.760 --> 12:27.960
your own centers and the centers of others - sometimes they burn, sometimes you get a kind of a tingling,

12:28.180 --> 12:33.500
sometimes you get pins and needles or sometimes you also get little burning.

12:34.200 --> 12:40.500
If it's a very horrid person, then might get a little blister for a while just to indicate - you become like a barometer.

12:40.740 --> 12:46.060
But you don't feel bad about it because you just feel it like a barometer and you know what's the problem

12:46.300 --> 12:49.540
with the other person is and also your own problem.

12:49.940 --> 12:55.140
So, you know the truth about everything. You want to find out about anyone,

12:55.500 --> 13:02.780
you want to know about any book, you want to know about any kind of a knowledge

13:03.120 --> 13:10.840
if it is true or not - you have to just put your hands and ask, "Is this the truth?"

13:12.400 --> 13:19.800
"Is there God?" Many people say, "We don't believe in God." I think, is very unscientific to say like that, "We don't believe in God."

13:20.300 --> 13:25.180
Because you have not yet found it out. Unless and until you found out there is God or not,

13:25.380 --> 13:29.780
how can you say that, "I don't believe in God," - it is great arrogance, I think.

13:30.260 --> 13:34.880
So is best is, to find out. If you ask a question, "Is there God," -

13:35.080 --> 13:39.220
if you are realized soul,  immediately you'll start getting tremendous vibrations.

13:40.800 --> 13:46.060
That is how it works and gradually, you don't have to

13:46.380 --> 13:52.740
see on your vibrations but you just know the truth - you just know it what is the truth.

13:53.080 --> 13:59.720
Immediately as soon as you see the person, you know about him, as soon as you listen to someone, you know about him -

14:00.240 --> 14:06.960
it's becomes very clear and vivid. There's no problem then how to find out

14:07.300 --> 14:12.880
what is the truth - so you get all the proofs of it, all the proofs of it.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.680
Now the third thing,

14:17.960 --> 14:23.200
which I've told you, is the spiritual part of it.

14:23.500 --> 14:28.920
Of course, you become a witness, you become absolutely peaceful

14:29.480 --> 14:34.620
and the most important thing that you get is the joy.

14:35.600 --> 14:40.060
Joy is not like happiness and unhappiness.

14:40.780 --> 14:44.140
Unhappiness comes when your ego is hurt

14:44.480 --> 14:49.440
or your conditionings are hurt, your emotions are hurt

14:50.340 --> 14:57.000
and you feel happy when ego is pampered or your emotions are substantiated.

14:57.740 --> 15:02.460
But joy is something which doesn't have this double face - joy is Absolute.

15:03.440 --> 15:08.880
So, you start enjoying everything. For example, now see there's a beautiful carpet here,

15:09.680 --> 15:13.200
I watch it without thinking

15:14.020 --> 15:19.340
and whatever the artist has put the joy in it, starts pouring on My head

15:20.320 --> 15:24.480
just like a soothing river Ganges, as they say

15:25.400 --> 15:29.860
because I don't think about it, I'm just watching it.

15:30.420 --> 15:37.660
Artist must have involved himself with great joy to do it in an abstract way but that all abstract,

15:37.960 --> 15:42.140
just reflects on Me and starts flowing down.

15:45.660 --> 15:52.340
This joy becomes then the main nourishing factor in your life.

15:53.120 --> 15:57.960
Your family life changes, husband wife's relations change,

15:58.520 --> 16:02.680
children's relations change, relation of the whole

16:02.920 --> 16:07.780
sahaja yoga brotherhood comes absolutely spontaneously.

16:08.460 --> 16:14.940
I don't have to tell you to 'Love thy neighbor' - you just love, you enjoy.

16:15.220 --> 16:18.600
The first time you enjoy another personality.

16:19.080 --> 16:26.620
For example now, they must have told you, we are working in fifty-five nations, it's more than that, I think, but still fifty-five

16:26.880 --> 16:30.180
is all right to make it look all right.

16:30.660 --> 16:36.700
These fifty-five nations have got people of different nature,

16:37.200 --> 16:41.780
different temperament, different culture, different

16:41.800 --> 16:47.640
uh.. races, different religions and when they meet

16:48.720 --> 16:55.680
they look so beautiful, they never fight, they never argue,

16:56.820 --> 17:04.500
they never think of jealousies, there's no hatred of any kind,

17:04.940 --> 17:10.340
they do not value you what your skin is or what your position is

17:10.760 --> 17:16.120
everyone feels that they are part and parcel of the whole

17:16.720 --> 17:20.820
and enjoy each other. If there's a problem -

17:22.320 --> 17:27.780
first when I went to Russia first, who came there you'll be surprised

17:28.160 --> 17:32.340
were the Germans, just came rushing to help Me.

17:32.680 --> 17:37.260
I said, "How are you here?" "Mother, don't you think, is our responsibility?"

17:37.620 --> 17:45.380
Really, I was filled with joy and tears. I said look at these Germans and they became so gentle with them,

17:45.720 --> 17:52.940
so gentle with the Russians that Russians were amazed how these Germans could be so gentle!

17:53.580 --> 17:58.960
But the feeling that they had that these Russians must be brought

17:59.800 --> 18:06.860
to reality, so that they'll have better life, like we are enjoying, they should also enjoy.

18:08.860 --> 18:13.140
This joy is so great that people want to spread it.

18:14.560 --> 18:21.540
As you know that I'm a housewife, I have children, I have grandchildren and I'm very busy otherwise also

18:21.980 --> 18:28.720
but I can't help it, I have to travel for this joy because I cannot enjoy it Myself,

18:29.000 --> 18:35.440
I must enjoy it with all of you and it's very simple that you can achieve the state

18:35.760 --> 18:39.800
of your Spirit because it's very important.

18:40.380 --> 18:47.860
This is for the emancipation for the whole world because all our problems come from us only, from human-beings.

18:48.160 --> 18:54.820
Once they're transformed, you'll be amazed how things work out.

18:55.340 --> 18:59.400
Also materially, I've seen, all of them are very much helped

18:59.880 --> 19:07.800
because they become so smart, so intelligent, so compassionate, so good, that somehow or the other, everything works out.

19:08.900 --> 19:14.420
I was asking them, "Is there anybody unemployed in sahaja yoga?"

19:14.980 --> 19:21.280
They said, "None." In Australia, can you imagine? But in England, which is much worse,

19:21.480 --> 19:26.100
there's nobody unemployed in sahaja yoga - everybody is doing very well.

19:26.400 --> 19:31.880
You ask them, "How are you?" "Oh Mother, we're swimming in the ocean of joy."

19:33.400 --> 19:38.920
All those complaints, all those aggressions, everything has disappeared

19:39.180 --> 19:44.580
and they have become such beautiful people like angels, absolutely like angels

19:44.860 --> 19:52.500
and you all are capable of becoming that. You all have those powers, just you have to get them

19:55.280 --> 20:00.940
and you have to desire, you have to desire and that's how it is going to work out.

20:03.100 --> 20:10.580
It is such a big subject and I must have given at least four to five thousand lectures, in only in English language

20:10.860 --> 20:15.260
and many in other languages. So you can imagine that

20:15.560 --> 20:22.440
this subject cannot be covered in one or two days but I'm sorry I cannot uh.. spend more time

20:23.480 --> 20:29.460
in Melbourne or in Australia also. That's My life is but whatever it is,

20:29.760 --> 20:32.900
what you have to get is your Self-realization.

20:33.460 --> 20:38.160
After getting the Self-realization, though the Kundalini has

20:39.060 --> 20:47.000
got out of your fontanel bone area, has touched the mains, everything is there, but still there's [UNCLEAR - I MEAN?] a very

20:48.180 --> 20:53.700
small part of Kundalini is, few threads of Kundalini have done that

20:54.080 --> 20:59.300
and also there are problems with your physical side or mental side, emotional side - whatever it is -

20:59.560 --> 21:04.420
so it has to go back to correct you. It goes back to correct you again and again

21:04.700 --> 21:10.900
so you have to only learn how to make this connection perfect and whole being to be purified.

21:11.200 --> 21:17.480
Now for that you don't have to go to Himalayas or do any kind of penance, sacrifice, fasting - nothing,

21:17.840 --> 21:22.040
it's not needed at all. Only thing, you have to come to the collective.

21:22.380 --> 21:29.740
We have very simple type of collective because we don't take money or anything - you can't pay for it - it's so invaluable that you can't pay.

21:30.020 --> 21:34.340
How much will you pay? How much do we pay to Mother Earth for these beautiful flowers?

21:34.760 --> 21:38.660
You can't pay for it. So people, who are sahaja yogies,

21:38.920 --> 21:45.960
have, somehow or the other, gathered a little money and they have a little place where they're having meditation forum - it's a humble place.

21:46.360 --> 21:51.560
You should humble down and come there and join the collective.

21:51.940 --> 21:57.420
Once you join the collective, you'll be amazed that you'll be cleansed automatically.

21:57.800 --> 22:02.600
Automatically you'll be cleansed, also they'll tell you how to meditate at home.

22:02.980 --> 22:07.120
Just try and you'll be amazed that

22:07.720 --> 22:11.300
you are really glorious, you are really beautiful

22:11.660 --> 22:15.660
and there is a purpose to our life. We are not born

22:16.300 --> 22:19.700
just by chance - there's a very big purpose

22:19.940 --> 22:24.240
and when you discover that you'll know your value and your identity.

22:26.960 --> 22:33.540
So, May God bless you! I'm very happy today you're all here, we should uh..

22:34.200 --> 22:37.900
now have the session for meditation by which

22:38.160 --> 22:41.880
I'm sure, you all can get your realization - I have no doubts about it.

22:48.800 --> 22:54.160
You see, I can go on talking for hours but, I think, talking is not going to help.

22:56.040 --> 23:01.100
But some people have questions, I don't mind answering the questions.

23:01.440 --> 23:07.160
But the questions should be relevant, please and should be

23:07.960 --> 23:12.760
such that you really desire to have your Self-realization

23:13.580 --> 23:20.580
because I'm not here to take anything from you, it's your own property, everything, I may just give you the key.

23:23.880 --> 23:29.740
And if you ask Me any questions - of course, I'm quite an expert now because I've be doing this for the last

23:29.740 --> 23:37.580
twenty-one years, so, I'm quite an expert but even if I answer your question, that doesn't guarantee that you'll get your realization,

23:37.820 --> 23:44.260
doesn't guarantee - it's just a mental feat. So, what you have to think of is your Self-realization

23:44.600 --> 23:48.200
that you should all get it - that is to be desired.

23:59.640 --> 24:04.580
- Doesn't appear to be any questions, Shri Mataji
- Umm?
- There are no questions.

24:04.780 --> 24:10.420
Are you sure? [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] All right. They're wonderful people, really.

24:10.620 --> 24:16.960
This time I'm really meeting very beautiful people in Australia, really, I must tell you.

24:17.880 --> 24:22.460
Even in Perth, there were such nice people - all of them got realization.

24:22.720 --> 24:28.320
And yesterday also you saw, how everybody got realization. But now the connection

24:28.500 --> 24:32.780
has to be established permanently. For that you have to give some time -

24:33.240 --> 24:37.380
that's the main thing, we don't give any time to ourselves.

24:38.380 --> 24:46.360
After all, we have these watches all the time to save the time but to save the time, to waste it.

24:47.860 --> 24:51.860
We have to give little time to ourselves, to our realization

24:52.440 --> 24:58.800
and morning and evening, say five minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening, if you do meditation at home, is all right.

24:58.980 --> 25:05.980
Once a week they meet where you can go - they'll give you all the necessary information that you want, whatever you want

25:06.580 --> 25:14.420
and you don't have to pay anything. If they ask any money, you let Me know - they will never ask.

25:18.020 --> 25:21.000
[INAUDIBLE]

25:21.740 --> 25:25.080
Wonderful!

25:36.060 --> 25:43.220
So at the very outset, I have to tell you, that I respect your freedom.

25:44.620 --> 25:51.300
Human-beings have been given freedom to choose and I cannot force on you

25:51.940 --> 25:56.340
Self-realization - no, I cannot. It cannot be done.

25:57.220 --> 26:00.540
So, you have to have that desire within you

26:00.860 --> 26:06.620
and Kundalini is the power of pure desire within you because all other desires

26:06.940 --> 26:09.940
are never satiable, in general.

26:10.580 --> 26:16.120
So you have to have desire within you  that you want to have your realization.

26:18.620 --> 26:24.420
Now the first condition is, that you have to be absolutely self-confident.

26:24.900 --> 26:29.060
You shouldn't have diffidence about yourself - how can I get it,

26:29.900 --> 26:32.980
how will it work it out?

26:33.800 --> 26:38.900
We have so many ideas about ourselves and we start judging ourselves

26:39.140 --> 26:43.020
Please don't judge yourself. Your Kundalini will judge

26:43.200 --> 26:47.080
and She will tell you what is wrong with you and She will manage you.

26:47.360 --> 26:51.420
She has been waiting all these years to give you this second birth - She's your mother.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.580
She will find Her way and She'll manage everything. You don't have to

26:58.060 --> 27:03.060
trouble yourself and tell yourself that this is wrong with me, that is wrong with me.

27:04.600 --> 27:11.240
So first of all, you must have full self-confidence that we are going to get Self-realization

27:11.460 --> 27:18.840
and that we are going to grow completely into our spiritual awareness. You have please, that self-confidence in yourself.

27:19.300 --> 27:24.640
Whatever you might have done, forget it at this moment. You have to be in the present and here

27:24.900 --> 27:28.740
you're perfectly all right and suitable for your ascent.

27:30.140 --> 27:34.460
The another thing is that, you don't have to think you're guilty

27:34.740 --> 27:38.860
This is also another, I think, like a fashion, everybody feels guilty.

27:39.200 --> 27:45.780
What is there to feel guilty, what wrong have you done. After all you are human-beings. If the human-beings

27:46.900 --> 27:52.660
make mistakes, what's wrong with that? You're not gods - if you've done mistakes, it's all right.

27:53.020 --> 28:00.080
Forget about it but don't feel guilty. If you feel guilty, then this center here, on the left side, catches

28:00.400 --> 28:05.960
which is a terrible center because it gives you horrible diseases like Angina,

28:06.160 --> 28:13.640
it gives you Spondylitis, also it gives you lethargic organs - so please, don't feel guilty.

28:14.040 --> 28:19.100
I don't know how this idea came into the people who were in charge of

28:19.400 --> 28:25.000
religion and God, that you all should feel guilty - is wrong.

28:26.580 --> 28:32.980
Absolutely wrong that you should suffer - this is another wrong. Christ has suffered for us -

28:33.460 --> 28:38.120
are we going to suffer more than Him? We don't have to suffer.

28:38.480 --> 28:45.220
All these ideas must be that you suffer, you fast and give us the money - must be that.

28:45.700 --> 28:52.720
I just can't understand, why to tell somebody to suffer - because God Almighty is your Father.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.720
and He is the essence of fatherhood.

28:59.120 --> 29:06.600
He's the greatest father you could think of and how can any loving father want his children to suffer?

29:07.400 --> 29:10.580
Logically you must understand this -

29:11.360 --> 29:16.360
why should you suffer? He's created all this beautiful world for you

29:17.000 --> 29:21.420
You should not suffer at all - so the idea of suffering should go away.

29:21.640 --> 29:27.200
It's becoming too much these days, the way people are taking to sufferings, for nothing at all.

29:29.460 --> 29:36.160
There are so many such principles, uh.. which are being sold in the market, that you have to suffer.

29:36.340 --> 29:41.220
And there was one in England which came to say, that you must go to Gobi desert.

29:41.980 --> 29:48.980
And now, Gobi desert if you go, you'll get Nirvana according to them. Of course you'll die, that's the Nirvana you'll get, no doubt.

29:49.200 --> 29:53.440
The simple thing is to go to Gobi desert without any water -

29:53.580 --> 30:00.580
within say, five, six minutes, you will die - there's nothing will be left out of you, so there's nothing to uh..

30:01.380 --> 30:05.860
suffer but it's a straight forward march to your death, that's all.

30:06.420 --> 30:13.100
So all these nonsensical ideas are to be given up. Nobody has to suffer,

30:13.520 --> 30:21.080
nobody has to think that they have to fast - of course, if you want to fast for your health, [UNCLEAR] that's different - but not for God.

30:22.980 --> 30:27.800
Is something uh... so absurd

30:29.980 --> 30:37.980
and ridiculous to make someone suffer, to tell somebody that you're a sinner - is all absurdly very cruel also,

30:38.480 --> 30:43.880
extremely cruel, while this All-Pervading power is the love of God.

30:45.840 --> 30:50.340
He loves us. This is what

30:51.360 --> 30:55.900
we should see in any person who talks of God or talks of religion.

30:56.120 --> 31:01.880
That's what they all said but the religions have gone, you know where they have gone to

31:04.000 --> 31:09.120
because they didn't seek the truth, they didn't seek the Spirit.

31:09.820 --> 31:16.780
If they had deviated, they are responsible for such a thing.

31:17.400 --> 31:22.080
They need not have done all this; They should have, really, found out what is reality.

31:22.820 --> 31:26.600
But they were very much against people who found out

31:26.920 --> 31:31.480
and tortured them, troubled them, killed them - did all kinds of things.

31:33.280 --> 31:41.000
But now, they cannot do anything because now this All-Pervading power has become dynamic.

31:41.540 --> 31:47.400
It looks after you, it protects, it worries about you - no one can touch you.

31:49.700 --> 31:53.140
Those days are gone when saints had to suffer.

31:56.960 --> 32:03.760
So just now, in short, you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

32:04.220 --> 32:11.240
not to be angry with yourself or anything. Just to be very pleasantly placed that you are a human-being

32:11.920 --> 32:19.940
and the epitome of evolution and that you have to just travel a little more to reach there.

32:24.480 --> 32:31.760
All right. The third condition which is also another very simple one is this

32:32.500 --> 32:35.540
that you have to forgive everyone.

32:37.000 --> 32:42.820
As I told you the other day, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - actually you don't do anything.

32:43.480 --> 32:47.560
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

32:50.080 --> 32:57.180
But always I've seen people say, it's very difficult to forgive. What is difficult - just to say, "I forgive everyone," - finished.

32:58.200 --> 33:05.200
In general you forgive. Don't think of those people because by thinking about them also you play into wrong hands.

33:06.220 --> 33:13.180
So just forgive all of them. Just try, it's very simple, just to say - it's a mantra you can call it.

33:13.560 --> 33:20.020
"I forgive all of them, in general," just say that and you'll feel much lighter within yourself,

33:20.340 --> 33:25.860
much better, just forgive. Why to carry this load on your head for nothing at all.

33:33.200 --> 33:39.680
I hope, you'll fulfill these three conditions which are very simple. One is the self-confidence,

33:40.220 --> 33:45.900
second is no guilt and the third one is forgiving everyone.

33:47.860 --> 33:52.260
All right, so now we are placed very pleasantly towards ourselves

33:52.620 --> 33:59.260
and we're sure we're going to get our Self-realization. We have to enter into the Kingdom of God - how can you be guilty?

34:03.500 --> 34:06.520
All right, so now

34:08.400 --> 34:16.220
there's one request is to take out your shoes because that helps you a lot to clear out your

34:17.500 --> 34:24.160
problems by the Mother Earth. She's very kind, She's the kindest thing that you can think of.

34:46.900 --> 34:52.760
Now, please put both the feet apart from each other

34:53.580 --> 34:56.580
because the left side

34:57.320 --> 35:03.100
is for your power of desire, ordinary desire.

35:03.640 --> 35:10.100
Kundalini is for pure desire and the right side is for your action.

35:16.200 --> 35:20.860
Now we'll tell you in the beginning, how we're going to proceed

35:21.100 --> 35:25.880
and then you can close your eyes. I hope you're pleasantly placed towards yourself.

35:28.760 --> 35:36.600
Now, please put your left hand towards Me, like this, on your lap, on your lap very comfortably. You don't have to do anything

35:36.920 --> 35:43.220
uh.. which is troublesome or painful, just like this and the right hand on your heart.

35:45.640 --> 35:50.180
Left hand on your lap and right hand on your heart.

35:51.580 --> 35:56.620
In the heart resides the Spirit

35:58.840 --> 36:04.980
and if this Spirit comes into your attention, then you have

36:06.620 --> 36:12.360
the light of the Spirit and in that light you become your own guide,

36:14.500 --> 36:21.120
you become your own master, you become your own guru. So please,

36:21.520 --> 36:29.440
now take your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now, this is the center of

36:30.760 --> 36:37.240
your mastery which is created by great masters for you.

36:43.620 --> 36:49.460
Now, please take your right hand the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side.

36:52.340 --> 37:00.180
This is the center for pure knowledge. Whatever knowledge we have, is not pure knowledge

37:00.460 --> 37:05.100
but this is pure knowledge because it gives you the knowledge about

37:05.500 --> 37:08.920
the laws of the Divine.

37:09.620 --> 37:14.220
It makes you capable of working it out.

37:15.320 --> 37:22.320
This is the pure knowledge you should have. Of course, we have another kind of knowledge, as you know, is black magic, this and that

37:22.640 --> 37:25.640
but this is pure knowledge of the Divine.

37:26.760 --> 37:31.940
Now, you raise your right hand, in the upper portion of the abdomen again, and push it down.

37:32.320 --> 37:36.840
This is the center again of, as I told you, of your mastery.

37:37.220 --> 37:43.600
Then you put your hand on your heart where resides the Spirit.

37:45.380 --> 37:51.940
Now you raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your face to your right.

37:52.900 --> 37:59.700
Now this is the center, I've already told you, when it is out of gear, you get diseases like Angina -

38:00.380 --> 38:05.980
so, don't feel guilty. Just now, I feel, all of you have this one the worst.

38:06.260 --> 38:09.640
What is there to feel guilty, I don't know.

38:11.420 --> 38:19.360
Please don't feel guilty. All right, now you have to take your right hand on your forehead across -

38:19.620 --> 38:25.500
you can put it this way that on one side your fingers, another side your

38:26.300 --> 38:33.740
thumb and you can press it. Now, bend your head slowly forward, as far as possible.

38:35.380 --> 38:39.320
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone.

38:41.060 --> 38:47.320
Now, please take this right hand on the back side of your head, back side of your head, on the optic lobe

38:47.540 --> 38:51.460
and hold it tight. Now, push back your head as far as possible.

38:53.140 --> 39:00.300
Now, this is the center where, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

39:00.540 --> 39:07.220
just for your own satisfaction, you have to ask for forgiveness from

39:07.280 --> 39:10.400
this All-Pervading power of love.

39:10.860 --> 39:17.360
Now, the last center is the most important. Stretch your hands, stretch your palm, push back your fingers.

39:17.760 --> 39:23.520
Put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area,

39:23.800 --> 39:29.800
which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now, put down your head as far as possible,

39:30.440 --> 39:36.780
press it hard, by pushing out your fingers only, that's important. Now, push the scalp

39:37.000 --> 39:43.200
and move it seven times clockwise, slowly, move it seven times clockwise.

39:44.340 --> 39:47.880
Please put down your head, put down your head.

39:56.960 --> 40:01.420
That's all is to be done, that's all. Now

40:03.920 --> 40:10.800
again, please take out your shoes, put your feet apart from each other, please put left hand towards Me.

40:12.040 --> 40:16.040
You can take out your spectacles, also if there's something

40:16.420 --> 40:21.240
tight on your neck or on your waist, you may take it out

40:23.860 --> 40:31.800
or say, loosen it I mean to say, if there's something, just take out the pressure, if there is any. That's all.

40:35.340 --> 40:39.820
Now, please put the left hand towards Me on your lap

40:40.340 --> 40:43.920
comfortably and the right hand on your heart.

40:47.980 --> 40:53.260
Close the eyes, please close the eyes and don't open them till I tell you.

40:53.500 --> 40:57.180
Please close the eyes, you can remove your spectacles also.

40:59.820 --> 41:06.940
Now here, you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself,

41:08.620 --> 41:14.940
three times in your heart - you can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

41:15.700 --> 41:23.080
Now the question is, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times.

41:40.080 --> 41:45.520
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your master.

41:46.260 --> 41:53.980
So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it little hard.

41:54.920 --> 41:59.760
Here you have to ask another fundamental question in your heart,

42:00.760 --> 42:04.920
"Mother, am I my own master?"

42:12.020 --> 42:18.120
I have already told you that I respect your freedom

42:18.740 --> 42:22.340
so I cannot force

42:25.120 --> 42:28.600
pure knowledge on you.

42:31.100 --> 42:37.180
So now, take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side,

42:47.660 --> 42:53.280
press it hard. Here you have to say, I mean you have to ask -

42:53.540 --> 43:00.580
because I cannot force pure knowledge on you - six times because this center has got six petals,

43:01.240 --> 43:04.900
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

43:36.420 --> 43:42.480
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising upward, so we have

43:42.740 --> 43:47.200
to nourish the upper centers with our self-confidence.

43:47.520 --> 43:54.220
So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it and here

43:54.500 --> 43:59.500
you have to say with full confidence, ten times,

44:00.380 --> 44:07.940
"Mother, I am my own master, Mother, I am my own master,"

44:08.840 --> 44:12.660
or, "Mother, I am my own guru."

44:25.320 --> 44:32.080
The fundamental truth about you is that you're not this body, this mind,

44:32.580 --> 44:40.080
this ego, these conditionings, these emotions but you are pure Spirit.

44:42.040 --> 44:47.500
So now, raise your hand on top of your heart and here

44:47.780 --> 44:52.100
you have to say with full confidence again, twelve times,

44:55.380 --> 44:59.240
"Mother, I am pure Spirit."

45:00.420 --> 45:04.980
Twelve times, "Mother, I am pure Spirit."

45:19.240 --> 45:22.240
This All-Pervading power

45:25.080 --> 45:30.260
of love is the ocean of knowledge,

45:30.600 --> 45:36.240
is the ocean of compassion and blisses

45:36.880 --> 45:42.900
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

45:43.800 --> 45:49.360
and whatever you may do - mistakes as they call them

45:50.740 --> 45:57.920
can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

46:08.100 --> 46:11.140
So now, raise your right hand

46:13.280 --> 46:21.040
into the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put your head to your right.

46:25.260 --> 46:28.400
Here you have to say with full confidence,

46:29.860 --> 46:37.580
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please say it sixteen times because this has sixteen petals.

46:37.940 --> 46:45.840
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please say it with full confidence, sixteen times.

46:57.720 --> 47:05.000
I've already told you, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

47:06.540 --> 47:12.840
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and suffer,

47:13.700 --> 47:20.620
torture yourself, while the person who has tortured you or troubled you, is quite happy.

47:23.060 --> 47:30.960
So please, you have to forgive all those, in general,

47:31.700 --> 47:35.540
who have given you trouble.

47:36.740 --> 47:43.240
So now, please take your right hand on top of your forehead, put it across

47:43.540 --> 47:50.380
with fingers on one side and the thumb on the other and now, put it down your head.

47:51.220 --> 47:56.160
Press it and put it down. Here you have to say,

47:56.460 --> 48:00.560
not how many times but from your heart,

48:01.240 --> 48:06.380
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

48:07.600 --> 48:14.120
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general." This you have to say

48:18.420 --> 48:26.420
with full confidence, with your heart, from your heart -

48:29.640 --> 48:36.960
not how many times. It's very important because this is a very constricted

48:37.340 --> 48:44.680
center and if you don't say this and you don't forgive all of them, Kundalini won't rise, so please,

48:46.020 --> 48:53.200
you have to say it from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

48:56.580 --> 49:03.260
Now, take back your right hand on the back side of your head

49:03.520 --> 49:06.580
and push back your head as far as possible.

49:09.720 --> 49:17.780
Here again, you have to say it from your heart, not how many times, without counting your mistakes,

49:18.460 --> 49:23.140
without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction,

49:23.460 --> 49:28.840
you have to say from your heart, not how many times, again I say,

49:32.700 --> 49:36.660
"Oh Divine power, if I have done

49:36.880 --> 49:41.120
anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

49:42.240 --> 49:48.000
"Oh Divine power, if I have done anything wrong

49:48.420 --> 49:52.120
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

50:03.700 --> 50:07.880
Now, stretch your hand fully

50:09.940 --> 50:17.540
and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

50:19.240 --> 50:26.320
and here you have to push back your fingers and put down your head.

50:27.920 --> 50:34.040
Now again, I respect your freedom and I cannot force Self-realization on you.

50:34.800 --> 50:41.640
So, you have to move your scalp with a pressure, seven times, very slowly,

50:41.920 --> 50:47.300
saying seven times, "Mother, please give me Self-realization.

50:48.060 --> 50:54.720
Mother, please give me Self-realization." You have to say this seven times.

50:56.500 --> 50:59.940

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

51:23.700 --> 51:29.800
Now please take down your hands, please open your eyes slowly.

51:30.520 --> 51:36.060
Please put both the hands, like this, towards Me, little higher.

51:36.760 --> 51:40.980
Now watch Me without thinking.

51:48.680 --> 51:53.680
Now, put the right hand towards Me like this, and

51:56.100 --> 52:00.620
put the left hand on top of the fontanel bone area.

52:00.800 --> 52:05.780
The fontanel bone area doesn't mean that you touch it but away from it

52:06.200 --> 52:14.000
just hold it, bend your head and just hold it and see for yourself if there's a cool or a warm

52:14.620 --> 52:20.040
breeze like waves are coming out of your fontanel bone area.

52:20.260 --> 52:25.840
You have to certify, please try to put it little away from your head.

52:26.040 --> 52:32.960
Sometimes it can be quite far away so be careful, move your hand up and down and see for yourself,

52:33.200 --> 52:37.520
if there's a cool or a warm breeze coming out of your head.

52:38.120 --> 52:45.940
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, it can be warm - if you've not forgiven it would be quite warm - so please forgive even now.

52:47.660 --> 52:54.460
Now try with the left hand. Put down your right, head again and see with your right hand,

52:54.720 --> 53:02.480
if there's a cool breeze or a warm breeze like waves coming through your fontanel bone area.

53:03.920 --> 53:11.880
Now again with the right hand, again put down your head and see for yourself

53:12.380 --> 53:18.240
if there's a cool breeze or a warm breeze like waves

53:18.500 --> 53:22.040
are coming out of your fontanel bone area.

53:28.000 --> 53:33.740
Now, raise both your hands towards the sky, push back your head

53:34.060 --> 53:39.580
and now here you have to ask one of these following questions, one of them,

53:39.760 --> 53:44.220
three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

53:46.180 --> 53:53.660
or, "Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of God's love?" or "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya,

53:54.080 --> 53:59.420
is this the Brahma Chaitanya?" Ask one of these questions three times in your heart.

54:08.960 --> 54:12.440
Now please take down your hands.

54:15.700 --> 54:18.700
You'll feel very relaxed.

54:20.600 --> 54:27.480
All those who have felt cool or warm breeze out of their fontanel bone area

54:27.760 --> 54:35.140
or on their finger-tips or on their hands, please raise both your hands, please raise both your hands.

54:38.740 --> 54:44.040

Practically all of you. May God bless you! I bow to you all saints, really, I bow to you.

54:57.060 --> 55:05.280

She's got it but it's all right, she's not feeling, it's all right.

55:11.660 --> 55:16.640
She has to feel, she has to certify - it will work out.

55:18.560 --> 55:21.820
Now, we have a follow on. I don't know...

55:23.460 --> 55:31.420
Also I would like to meet you all today, as I told you yesterday. Those who want to meet Me can come up  and I would like to meet them.
