00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:04.301
Professor Voronov’s talk and Shri Mataji’s acceptance of the award, Turkey, 1994

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:07.658
Simultaneous translation of professor Voronov from a Russian Sahaja Yogi.

00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:16.362
Our scientist, by my initiative,

00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:21.352
 unanimously elected our holy Mother, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.259
an honorary member of our Academy.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.530
The last time, in Moscow,

00:01:18.555 --> 00:01:22.104
we hand it over to our holy Mother a diploma

00:01:22.128 --> 00:01:25.154
made by Sahaja Yogis, loving Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:29.254
Now, this is a diploma of the Government of Russia.

00:02:12.788 --> 00:02:18.415
I would like to say a few words about what is actually this Academy, and who is a member of it.

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:32.000
There are members, among the members we have painters, scientists,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.028
musicians of different directions.

00:02:41.883 --> 00:02:44.216
But we have also honorary members of our Academy,

00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:46.668
but they are very few in number.

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:54.598
One is Antonio Juan Samaranch

00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:55.615
who is the president of the Olympic Committee of the world.

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.232
Two or three Ministers who, in their own countries,

00:03:08.257 --> 00:03:11.624
liquidated the illiteracy in the population of their country.

00:03:34.196 --> 00:03:36.985
Shri Mataji is the only lady on the world

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.830
who has been elected an honorary member of this Academy.

00:04:01.193 --> 00:04:02.605
I have to say a lot.

00:04:02.622 --> 00:04:08.396
I know that here we have the best representatives of the nations of the world.

00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:12.105
 But there are some exceptions.

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:32.032
We have to put our love first to our self-perfection, self-cognition,

00:04:32.057 --> 00:04:36.510
to put our, first, the love to our countries.

00:04:51.953 --> 00:04:55.311
We need that only to do helping that victorious

00:04:55.338 --> 00:05:00.308
victorious ideals of our holy Mother should not have any hindrance at all

00:05:00.316 --> 00:05:03.509
into that, we should self-perfect ourselves.

00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:11.127
Yes, we do have something negative besides the positive things.

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:23.601
For example, me and also our Sahaja Yogis from Turkey,

00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:27.716
they can see how the pieces of bread are spread on the floor.

00:05:29.673 --> 00:05:32.625
It’s very bad, I consider it very bad.

00:05:37.347 --> 00:05:41.404
My daughter by name Svetlana, she is also Sahaja Yogi,

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:42.249
she said,

00:05:50.244 --> 00:05:55.810
“I’ve been living for a long time among the Muslims and I know their attitude towards bread.

00:06:04.512 --> 00:06:07.298
If a piece of bread has been falling on earth,

00:06:07.323 --> 00:06:09.288
then they pick it up, they kiss it and put

00:06:09.312 --> 00:06:13.198
it somewhere for the birds to pick it up”.

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:25.554
We also have to feel respect

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:30.811
to the laborious people who are producing this bread, to peasants.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.660
I address to all the Sahaja Yogis who are working in the press media,

00:06:52.685 --> 00:06:56.367
who are journalists: we need to disseminate

00:06:56.392 --> 00:07:01.856
the ideas of our holy Mother everywhere, on press, television and magazines.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.416
If we do so and behave properly, we can be a real example,

00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:15.935
we can make real examples for the nations of the whole world.

00:07:24.916 --> 00:07:28.639
 But maybe, today, they started to call Sahaja Yogis

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:31.231
who were not perhaps quite satisfied with it.

00:07:31.256 --> 00:07:33.389
Still, we have to make it better.

00:07:38.042 --> 00:07:43.850
Taking into account an energetic activity of Shri Mataji,

00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:10.793
 it gives us an idea to propose to elect Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:08:10.818 --> 00:08:14.916
a laureate of the Noble Price winner for peace.

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:11.534
For that purpose, we have to work hard in our own countries

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.893
for Shri Mataji’s ideas to be really realized,

00:09:14.896 --> 00:09:20.414
understood beyond the level of consciousness.

00:09:45.129 --> 00:09:48.470
To reach that level for the Noble Price,

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.976
we need to make an example, we need to make the society,

00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:58.821
the publicity, press, to realize the ideas of Shri Mataji,

00:09:58.846 --> 00:10:02.611
how beneficial they are for the whole humanity.

00:10:16.804 --> 00:10:19.392
In Petroski Academy of Arts and Science,

00:10:19.417 --> 00:10:21.728
we have many outstanding people and perhaps

00:10:21.753 --> 00:10:26.398
we shall publish a special article for that in Nirmala Yoga magazine.

00:10:32.496 --> 00:10:36.422
But, with all my heart and in the name of all members of

00:10:36.447 --> 00:10:38.595
 the Academy of Arts and Science,

00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:50.701
I would like to make a sort of present to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:10:50.726 --> 00:10:56.929
This is a reproduction of Dona Latte,

00:10:56.945 --> 00:11:03.943
it’s a – [aside] sorry, sorry, no, no, Mona Lisa is different.

00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:06.731
It’s Dona Latte,

00:11:07.803 --> 00:11:10.003
Madonna, from Leonardo Da Vinci,

00:11:10.424 --> 00:11:13.371
which you can find in State Hermitage by Leonardo.

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:15.846
 (Madonna del Latte) It’s different.

00:11:26.755 --> 00:11:28.612
And the last.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.859
We have really to watch our own behaviour, not to do any negative things.

00:11:44.718 --> 00:11:48.059
For our compatriots in all our countries would say

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:01.281
that, “Sahaja Yogi is really the best representative of humanity in all the countries”.

00:12:01.289 --> 00:12:02.969
That is our purpose.

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:42.557
I don't know, but

00:12:42.582 --> 00:12:45.207
how to say

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:53.139
as to the Russian scholars and scientists.

00:12:53.164 --> 00:12:59.973
Scientists are amoral people because science is immoral.

00:12:59.998 --> 00:13:06.974
 But I was surprised that in Leningrad [St Petersburg],

00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:12.674
thanks to professor, we had about two thousand scientists –

00:13:12.699 --> 00:13:15.885
I don’t know, ten thousand probably –

00:13:17.484 --> 00:13:21.935
who honoured Me so much.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:29.158
And I told about one centre only there, that is Swadishthan.

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:35.515
How Swadishthan they are ruing your life.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:42.848
And they were listening to Me, absolutely, with the right attention.

00:13:43.716 --> 00:13:45.166
All right.

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:50.664
Very surprisingly, I’ve never seen such scientists,

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.097
because they cannot see something beyond science

00:13:54.106 --> 00:13:57.417
and Sahaja Yoga is meta science,

00:13:57.434 --> 00:14:00.047
it is beyond science.

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:02.582
And when I told them how so many diseases

00:14:02.607 --> 00:14:05.204
are caused by one centre,

00:14:05.229 --> 00:14:08.271
they were really amazed at it.

00:14:08.296 --> 00:14:11.814
But they were open, open-minded people

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:16.703
and a scientist means an open-minded person.

00:14:16.728 --> 00:14:22.933
I was amazed also, the way they gave Me awards.

00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.398
The first award when they gave Me,

00:14:26.422 --> 00:14:28.321
I said, “What is this?

00:14:28.346 --> 00:14:32.316
I’m the tenth member of such an old university where

00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:35.917
very, very great scientists have got this award.

00:14:35.942 --> 00:14:42.271
So, how can you give Me such a honour?”

00:14:42.296 --> 00:14:47.774
So, professor Voronov told Me that, “Mother

00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:51.392
these scientists have only worked with matter.

00:14:51.409 --> 00:14:55.761
But you have worked with human beings and transformed them”.

00:14:55.786 --> 00:15:00.561
I was surprised the way he saw the point.

00:15:00.586 --> 00:15:03.914
It’s not easy to see this point

00:15:03.939 --> 00:15:10.270
that transformation of human beings is most important today.

00:15:10.295 --> 00:15:13.902
If I have achieved it, it’s nothing great, I think,

00:15:13.927 --> 00:15:16.879
because I knew how to do it. So, it’s nothing great.

00:15:16.898 --> 00:15:20.923
But I really feel very proud of you

00:15:20.926 --> 00:15:23.626
that you have achieved it. I have not achieved anything.

00:15:23.634 --> 00:15:25.477
I was born like this.

00:15:25.511 --> 00:15:27.478
But you have achieved it.

00:15:27.503 --> 00:15:30.695
So many nations here sitting,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:37.424
enjoying the same beautiful feeling of your Spirit.

00:15:37.449 --> 00:15:43.234
And they are from different nations, different places, different religions,

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:48.492
and genuinely they are feeling the joy of their Spirit.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:53.181
And this is something, was my dream and vision.

00:15:53.206 --> 00:15:58.067
But I never thought of Noble Price or anything like that.

00:15:58.092 --> 00:16:04.995
Because, my husband has got all kind of prizes

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.459
and he always, says, “All due to my wife”.

00:16:08.484 --> 00:16:12.558
But what I really treasure is this,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.315
that in a great country like Russia where

00:16:16.317 --> 00:16:20.334
science has reached its heights,

00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:22.482
 that they should accept Me

00:16:22.506 --> 00:16:25.650
as a great scientist and academician,

00:16:25.675 --> 00:16:28.488
is something really very remarkable,

00:16:28.504 --> 00:16:31.450
though I don’t know if I deserve it or not.

00:16:31.475 --> 00:16:33.692
But that’s what they feel about it.

00:16:33.717 --> 00:16:36.552
Professor Voronov: There’s no doubt about it.

00:16:42.746 --> 00:16:47.905
Moreover, all the false gurus are banned in Russia.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:52.972
But I was surprised also that they did not ban us.

00:16:52.997 --> 00:16:56.169
Apart from that, the patriarch,

00:16:56.194 --> 00:17:01.252
who is like a pope of Leningrad of the white order,

00:17:01.277 --> 00:17:04.018
he himself invited me to be there.

00:17:04.043 --> 00:17:08.125
So, we are entering into the realm of religion also.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.008
It’s something – not only science,

00:17:11.033 --> 00:17:13.703
but also religion which is,

00:17:13.728 --> 00:17:16.863
which has to open eyes and see

00:17:16.888 --> 00:17:19.217
what have they missed,

00:17:19.226 --> 00:17:22.823
all the promises that the Prophets gave,

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.430
that the incarnations gave are to be fulfilled.

00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:29.385
If they can just see this point,

00:17:29.387 --> 00:17:32.515
it will be so great. I was surprised also

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:39.205
that patriarch himself invites Me to this conference.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.963
So, two great things, I feel,

00:17:42.988 --> 00:17:48.590
that not only in science but also in religion,

00:17:48.615 --> 00:17:55.057
Sahaja Yoga is entering and will remove the darkness of ignorance.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:18:01.049
Another thing I must tell you that when I went to Brasilia

00:18:01.074 --> 00:18:06.299
which is the capital of Brazil, the Mayor of Brasilia

00:18:06.315 --> 00:18:11.074
came to receive Me and he gave Me the keys of Brasilia

00:18:11.098 --> 00:18:16.810
saying, “Mother, please look after Brazil”. I was really amazed.

00:18:16.835 --> 00:18:21.116
So, on the political side also, if we start entering into,

00:18:21.141 --> 00:18:23.851
our problems should be solved.

00:18:23.876 --> 00:18:25.996
We should have no problems,

00:18:26.036 --> 00:18:29.426
we should have no quarrels, no fights, nothing.

00:18:29.435 --> 00:18:34.385
But let us live with happiness and joy.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.390
I’m sure with this [award],

00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:41.455
I can see that vision coming through.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.490
This vision of mine

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:49.945
of seeing the whole world in peace and joy enjoying themselves.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.667
All of you, as he said, have to help Me,

00:18:53.683 --> 00:18:57.989
have to come up as real great Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:58.014 --> 00:19:00.105
I don’t know Sir, how to thank you very much

00:19:00.113 --> 00:19:01.860
because I have no words.

00:19:01.885 --> 00:19:05.250
But he has been meeting Me for three, four years and

00:19:05.275 --> 00:19:08.011
I was surprised, he is such a learned man,

00:19:08.036 --> 00:19:10.979
such an educated person,

00:19:11.004 --> 00:19:16.078
and how he could see the subtle side of life!

00:19:16.103 --> 00:19:19.773
And that they discussed about morality!

00:19:19.798 --> 00:19:23.516
All the time, all the subject was that of morality.

00:19:23.541 --> 00:19:27.658
There was a gentleman who was a surgeon  who is –

00:19:27.683 --> 00:19:29.373
How old is he? Eighty years.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.255
Sahaja Yogi: Ninety-three.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.866
Sahaja Yogi: Ninety-three.

00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:34.759
Very old,

00:19:34.784 --> 00:19:37.443
but he is still doing operations.

00:19:37.468 --> 00:19:38.865
 He is still doing operations

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.648
and he is the one who wrote against alcohol.

00:19:42.673 --> 00:19:44.532
And I was really surprised.

00:19:44.542 --> 00:19:45.753
Professor Voronov:  Fyodor Uglov.

00:19:45.777 --> 00:19:47.756
Professor Voronov: Academician Uglov.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.438
He wrote a book against alcohol

00:19:54.463 --> 00:19:58.691
in a country where Vodka is so common.

00:19:58.716 --> 00:20:00.530
But just imagine!

00:20:00.555 --> 00:20:05.592
And these people listen to their elders.

00:20:05.767 --> 00:20:07.912
They are not like Western people

00:20:07.937 --> 00:20:09.754
who do not care for their elders.

00:20:09.779 --> 00:20:12.859
They listen to their elders who are very wise.

00:20:12.884 --> 00:20:16.133
One day, I’m sure, Russia will be

00:20:16.144 --> 00:20:23.724
one of the most important religious country.

00:20:23.749 --> 00:20:26.724
It will have such a big name one day

00:20:26.732 --> 00:20:31.101
 because they have taken to truth and not to some nonsensical things.

00:20:31.117 --> 00:20:34.550
And I am sure this will prove to the whole world

00:20:34.575 --> 00:20:37.911
that truth is what we should ask for.

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:40.364
We should not get

00:20:40.382 --> 00:20:43.495
in anyway dominated by untruth

00:20:43.504 --> 00:20:49.041
because untruth will never bring joy or peace.

00:20:50.671 --> 00:20:54.602
Actually, I am overwhelmed by what he has said

00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:58.241
and I’m happy he has made you so happy also

00:20:58.266 --> 00:21:01.061
by saying these beautiful things about Me.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.422
But I must tell you, I’m a very humble housewife.

00:21:04.447 --> 00:21:05.739
That’s all I am.

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:11.819
But if you think I’m more than that, I’m not going to challenge it.

00:21:11.851 --> 00:21:17.597
Now we have to thank the Turkish people, the French people,

00:21:17.622 --> 00:21:21.218
for organizing this beautiful program

00:21:21.227 --> 00:21:25.128
and these weddings, despite all the problems.

00:21:25.144 --> 00:21:29.107
 And also, to every way,

00:21:29.132 --> 00:21:33.452
work so hard because there were only forty Sahaja Yogis in Turkey

00:21:33.471 --> 00:21:36.592
and they have done such a dedicated work.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.635
And so capable they are!

00:21:39.652 --> 00:21:44.498
I’m amazed to see this kind of industrious,

00:21:44.507 --> 00:21:50.860
I should say, or very hard-working people, very hard working.

00:21:50.885 --> 00:21:55.636
And all the problems are solved here,

00:21:55.661 --> 00:21:58.440
they say, “Mother, you have solved all of the problems.”

00:21:58.465 --> 00:22:02.952
Now I would say the marriages have been done very gracefully.

00:22:02.977 --> 00:22:06.806
Now, don’t spoil your marriages and create problems for Me.

00:22:06.815 --> 00:22:11.017
That’s all I want to know that you’ll have very nice children,

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.434
and that you create a society and help the society

00:22:15.436 --> 00:22:19.755
of great peacemakers.

00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:21.466
Thank you very much.

00:22:21.474 --> 00:22:22.474
Thank you
