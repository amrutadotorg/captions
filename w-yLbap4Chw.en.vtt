00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.644
Today is the eighth day of Navaratri,

00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:15.168
and it is great day for Sahaja Yogis

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:25.684
because it is the most important time period.

00:00:27.748 --> 00:00:36.458
That is, the seventh centre we have crossed
and we are on the eighth centre.

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:44.561
We need not think of the Goddess what She did on the eighth day,

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:48.819
we have to think today what we have to do within ourserlves.

00:00:49.813 --> 00:00:52.676
After crossing the seventh day,

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:57.081
after crossing the seventh chakra

00:00:57.617 --> 00:01:03.946
-that is the real ascent in your spiritual ascent.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.617
What are we to do on the eighth one?

00:01:09.412 --> 00:01:14.046
It’s so Sahaja that today should be Ashtami,

00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:21.229
because that is the day the Goddess killed so may evil doers,

00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:29.319
and devils and Rakshasas. She did it on Her own, alone.

00:01:29.518 --> 00:01:35.649
Now these evil forces are manifesting in human beings.

00:01:35.947 --> 00:01:39.498
They have spread out. They are within us.

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:45.430
So we all have to fight those forces within us.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.509
The war is within ourselves, is not without.

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:57.152
First when you ascend the seventh chakra,

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.160
when you are on the eighth step,

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:06.829
you have to remember first
you have to fight those forces within ourselves.

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:12.386
You are all very intelligent people; bit too intelligent sometimes.

00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:17.109
So whatever I say you may twist it,

00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:22.505
and may try to use it in your own intelligence.

00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:28.378
But it is not in your well-being.
It is not for your ‘hita’, for your good.

00:02:28.557 --> 00:02:33.664
You want to use it because you think you are intelligent,

00:02:34.061 --> 00:02:38.993
or maybe that you do not know that you are using it that way.

00:02:40.323 --> 00:02:42.704
And that is what one has to know

00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:45.550
that these forces are acting within us.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.034
They act through our intelligence,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.307
they act through our emotions,

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:55.144
and they act through our physical being.

00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:57.621
So we have to be very careful.

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:01.549
When you ascend into Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.155
we have to be very careful with our intelligence,

00:03:05.374 --> 00:03:08.774
because intelligence has capacity to cheat itself.

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:16.437
And it will cheat us, nobody else.
It is against us, against our own power.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.663
So we have to be alert and see for ourselves.

00:03:20.923 --> 00:03:24.415
So as soon as you enter onto the eighth step

00:03:24.593 --> 00:03:27.271
you should start seeing at yourself.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.819
Now, for example, when I say the mantra is “I am my own Guru”,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.502
immediately the intelligence comes
forward to render its services-freely.

00:03:40.636 --> 00:03:43.815
“Oh! I am my own Guru, why should I listen to anyone?

00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:48.082
Why should I listen to any leader?
Why should I listen to anyone else who is elder,

00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:50.011
who understands Sahaja Yoga better?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.563
I am my own Guru!” It is the other way.

00:03:53.773 --> 00:03:59.494
Straightforward thing is that:
I am My own Guru. I have to correct myself.

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:05.909
I have to use this instrument of light to correct myself.

00:04:06.127 --> 00:04:09.710
Now the intelligence cheats again:

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:14.291
“Mother said that if your feel vibrations, then it’s alright;

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.869
and I am feeling the vibrations, I am alright”. – Again cheating.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:23.465
You are cheating yourself! What is the reason?

00:04:25.549 --> 00:04:29.695
The reason is very interesting.

00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:35.291
I’ve seen that ordinary human being

00:04:36.204 --> 00:04:42.390
– in the West specially – are very much against themselves.

00:04:43.184 --> 00:04:47.125
Like, I’ll give you an example:

00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:53.395
You tell somebody that if you have to go to the station,

00:04:54.248 --> 00:04:57.848
take this road and you’ll go straight to the station.

00:04:58.078 --> 00:04:59.868
But immediately he’ll say,

00:05:00.027 --> 00:05:04.769
“But the problem is that
how can I go straight? My back is towards the station.

00:05:04.928 --> 00:05:09.570
If I walk straight I’ll go in the opposite direction”.

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.182
Such stupid things! But they say it, all the time.

00:05:13.528 --> 00:05:22.101
Now if you tell them that you can sell
your car better if you go to Germany, for example;

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.595
but they say, “There’s a problem, may be

00:05:25.753 --> 00:05:29.761
the Germans may start their war again.

00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:32.658
May be there is Hitler waiting for me, to kill me”

00:05:32.837 --> 00:05:37.877
— Any fantastic problem, that you can’t think of,
can come out of this modern brain.

00:05:38.056 --> 00:05:42.323
And you are amazed how this man is against himself all the time!

00:05:44.438 --> 00:05:52.156
The whole built-up is like that because
before realization you are absolutely disintegrated.

00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:56.819
Your heart is against your brain,

00:05:57.167 --> 00:05:59.700
and your brain is against your liver.

00:06:00.113 --> 00:06:06.561
This is the reason they have three types of wives;
one is a love affair,

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.724
one is a physical life and one a wife.

00:06:12.677 --> 00:06:18.210
They are so disintegrated
that every cell can have a wife or can have a husband.

00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:22.021
The nose will want another thing,

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:27.332
and the hands will do something else
and tongue will say something else.

00:06:27.557 --> 00:06:29.624
When I met the western people,

00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:33.225
I had to consult many dictionaries to understand

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.806
don’t understand why they behave in such a funny manner.

00:06:37.985 --> 00:06:40.346
They are all the time against themselves.

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:44.645
So after realization this habit becomes even subtler.

00:06:44.824 --> 00:06:49.024
So now they use Sahaja Yoga to act against Sahaja Yoga itself.

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:53.712
Sahaja is simple, is straightforward.

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:58.333
But they don’t want to have it in that way.

00:06:59.028 --> 00:07:04.226
They must always do it in such a way that it is absolutely Asahaja.

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:09.775
There was a fellow in my house
who was suffering from left side problems.

00:07:09.938 --> 00:07:14.125
So I told him that you have to light a lamp

00:07:15.454 --> 00:07:19.680
and then take out all your badhas every night.

00:07:20.474 --> 00:07:23.668
And we had a big drum of oil in the house.

00:07:24.025 --> 00:07:27.025
– He did not eat any food, he did not sleep.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.040
He burnt all that oil in one week’s time.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:37.402
He made all the blankets black, all the wall black,

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:40.976
he any burnt all the curtains!

00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:47.643
When I came back after eight days,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.200
I said what have you been doing?

00:07:51.511 --> 00:07:53.644
–And he looked like a real bhoot!

00:07:53.804 --> 00:07:59.637
He said “I was driving out the bhoots.”
I said now this is the limit!

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:02.354
So he said, “Mother you told me”,

00:08:02.554 --> 00:08:06.899
I said, “thank god you did not take
beacon light to burn the whole house!”

00:08:07.335 --> 00:08:10.133
So I have to be very careful when I talk with you.

00:08:10.293 --> 00:08:13.146
Whenever I tell you one thing, I tell you that

00:08:13.264 --> 00:08:15.401
the other side of it also immediately,

00:08:15.527 --> 00:08:19.594
because I don’t want – if I tell you this side,
you go to the other side, to the other extreme.

00:08:19.732 --> 00:08:23.799
So all this kind of this crazy madness, stupidness I’ve seen.

00:08:24.031 --> 00:08:26.848
And today when I’m going to talk to you about discipline,

00:08:27.054 --> 00:08:31.005
I must tell you “Discipline has to be Sahaja”.

00:08:32.335 --> 00:08:34.339
Now what does that mean?

00:08:35.173 --> 00:08:39.319
– That is first of all “face yourself”.

00:08:39.994 --> 00:08:44.021
What I find, the western mind,

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.220
because of its ego cannot discipline itself.

00:08:47.435 --> 00:08:51.449
If you tell them you have to discipline
they think I’m creating a military out of you.

00:08:51.608 --> 00:08:54.068
In a way it ‘is’ a fight.

00:08:54.211 --> 00:08:57.255
It is a fight with yourself.

00:08:57.454 --> 00:09:00.072
But how will you fight if you have no discipline?

00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:04.060
Now if I say, you have to get up in the morning, take your bath,

00:09:04.257 --> 00:09:05.993
and sit down for meditation;

00:09:06.144 --> 00:09:11.729
in a Sahaja way you have to tell yourself plainly,
“Come along, now you have to get up in the morning”.

00:09:11.928 --> 00:09:15.795
In a Sahaja way; the way you turn your wheels in your car.

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:20.870
So what you do, is to, I think, the whole night you don’t sleep.

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:24.678
May be this could be one extreme,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.133
is not to sleep.

00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:28.212
And get up at 2 O’clock,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.216
disturb the whole house-hold,

00:09:30.432 --> 00:09:32.907
fill your tub, and fill the whole house with water!

00:09:33.046 --> 00:09:37.708
And sit down in the water, and you get cold and sick.

00:09:38.364 --> 00:09:43.832
It is absurd! Why?

00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:46.987
– Because you want to show-off.

00:09:47.205 --> 00:09:51.205
Or may be you want to hurt yourself. Both things are wrong.

00:09:51.928 --> 00:09:56.461
Whatever has to be done has to be done in the most pleasurable way.

00:09:57.007 --> 00:09:59.927
Either you will not wash the dirt,

00:10:00.107 --> 00:10:03.907
or you will wash it such that all the cloth will be torn.

00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:06.107
But today as I see the people

00:10:07.466 --> 00:10:10.666
—of France, specially, the French Sahaja Yogis,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.280
–I think the discipline is lacking.

00:10:13.936 --> 00:10:15.736
I’m quite surprised at it.

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:22.620
The first thing it hits at is that you cannot manage within

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.251
a limited amount,–I mean money-wise.
It hits you at the money point.

00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:28.524
Like in the room there’s light,

00:10:28.672 --> 00:10:30.693
nobody will see that it is put off;

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:33.035
there’s also a switch to be put off;

00:10:33.154 --> 00:10:35.416
–is a practical thing. I mean one must know.

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:37.916
And the bill is going up for nothing at all.

00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:42.420
Is an irresponsibility, complete irresponsibility.

00:10:42.607 --> 00:10:46.328
That it is the money that will be spent,

00:10:46.467 --> 00:10:48.788
is just a waste; and for us

00:10:48.908 --> 00:10:52.375
it is important that we live within sensible means.

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:55.519
First I’ll be dealing with gross discipline.

00:10:55.724 --> 00:11:01.172
Now what happens,that if somebody says

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:03.057
why the light is on,

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:07.768
immediately they become very abstract, they say “I’m the light”.

00:11:08.057 --> 00:11:11.901
Then you should not have lights at all,
there’s no need to have light!

00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:14.103
Save all the electricity, all the light.

00:11:14.262 --> 00:11:17.636
You are the Sun, so you need not have any heating!

00:11:18.072 --> 00:11:21.499
That is the way things are funny.

00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:27.822
One must understand that
on the gross points we have to disciplined first…

00:11:28.742 --> 00:11:33.563
We are living in ‘France, not on Himalayas.

00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:36.787
So when you live in France,

00:11:37.006 --> 00:11:40.537
we have to correct ourselves living in France.

00:11:41.698 --> 00:11:46.894
Now the second gross point is
that there are many who are not working at all.

00:11:47.053 --> 00:11:52.013
Is a hippy style life. Or they work for two days or three days,

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.513
and the rest of the time what do they do?

00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:59.267
They say we meditate. Means what?
—they sleep and snore, that’s all.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.325
You don’t need 24 hours to meditate.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.321
You ‘must’ have jobs, all of you.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.107
Regular jobs.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:14.853
So many ladies I’m told don’t take jobs once they marry.
They say “let the husband do job”.

00:12:15.032 --> 00:12:16.472
It’s very wrong.

00:12:16.729 --> 00:12:19.110
If you have the child, it’s alright,

00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:24.527
for the time being. You all must work every day.

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:29.607
There is no day for when we can rest, really.

00:12:29.885 --> 00:12:35.400
God created this world in six days and seventh day He rested.

00:12:36.935 --> 00:12:39.335
But the eighth day what did He do? –

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.653
He started giving realization; relentlessly. Working hard.

00:12:45.447 --> 00:12:48.047
Could you believe at this age of mine,

00:12:48.304 --> 00:12:51.459
within last 2 months how much I have traveled?

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:56.067
Every night sleeping at about 2 O’clock, getting up at 5 O’clock:

00:12:56.519 --> 00:13:02.295
I went to America, came back from there, then throughout England,

00:13:02.434 --> 00:13:06.632
the whole month I was traveling—from north to south,

00:13:06.772 --> 00:13:11.811
east to west. Next month out to Switzerland, to Zermatt.

00:13:12.188 --> 00:13:20.541
Then to Austria, Munich. Then back to London.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.310
then to Italy back to London, had a Puja there.

00:13:24.442 --> 00:13:28.596
Again back to France. Again back to London.
I’ve to change my house,

00:13:28.775 --> 00:13:35.798
pack up all the things, go back to India,
go to Hong Kong, go to China, come back.

00:13:35.878 --> 00:13:41.041
Then look after your Ashrams in India. Six days. Again come back.

00:13:41.194 --> 00:13:43.164
And then to America…

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.669
That’s the thing your Mother is doing at this age.
Last night we slept at 3.30.

00:13:46.833 --> 00:13:49.603
But then they told us it’s one hour earlier.

00:13:49.821 --> 00:13:53.622
So we said alright one hour earlier. So we slept at 2.30!

00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:56.934
You have to make your body like that,

00:13:57.146 --> 00:14:00.848
you see that it can stand all kinds of discomforts.

00:14:00.987 --> 00:14:04.200
You know in Sahaja Yoga unemployment is not allowed;

00:14:04.348 --> 00:14:07.436
to take this money from the Government is not allowed.

00:14:07.595 --> 00:14:12.995
You’ll be surprised; in England
we have maximum unemployment in the whole world,

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.206
but there is no Sahaja Yogi is unemployed.

00:14:16.464 --> 00:14:20.729
Now you must all earn sufficiently to pay for your stay.

00:14:21.265 --> 00:14:23.368
Nobody should be parasite.

00:14:23.626 --> 00:14:28.031
Now the young people who are no educated,

00:14:28.428 --> 00:14:46.339
who have no other job than that of a labour class
—or we call it as the garbage cleaners

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:49.277
—must take some sort of specialization,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:55.633
to some kind of a mastery, otherwise people think
that Sahaja Yoga is a group of beggars.

00:14:55.823 --> 00:14:59.434
Beggars and unemployed and miserable people.

00:15:00.506 --> 00:15:03.439
But you see, when you become your own Guru,

00:15:05.089 --> 00:15:10.757
you think that all the Gurus don’t work;
their disciples have to look after them.

00:15:11.671 --> 00:15:17.087
The Guru sits down in one place,
you see, and the disciples look after.

00:15:17.266 --> 00:15:20.799
—But not your Guru! Your Guru has to work very hard.

00:15:21.432 --> 00:15:25.032
So you have to be in the same pattern as your Guru is.

00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:28.208
And to hear that “nobody listens,

00:15:28.407 --> 00:15:33.874
you tell them anything they don’t do any work,
they are lazy-lumps”—is very sad.

00:15:34.182 --> 00:15:39.110
Some people sometimes say that these are the set of lotus-eaters

00:15:39.467 --> 00:15:45.334
or some sort of a set of beggars
or lepers who are suffering from horrible diseases.

00:15:46.352 --> 00:15:49.875
Then I feel extremely insulted, you know.

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.197
You are my children.

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:55.601
How people are going to have respect for you,

00:15:56.007 --> 00:15:59.379
or for me, if you have no discipline?

00:15:59.618 --> 00:16:04.153
For French I should say, they should take to “Mauna” means silence.

00:16:04.372 --> 00:16:11.305
Once they open out their lips, they just go on like a bird,
I’ve seen: all the time chuck chuck chuck…

00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:15.700
You should exchange with English, who never talk,

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.453
they need a bump on the head to talk.

00:16:19.352 --> 00:16:24.454
You ask them ten questions, and they would not say anything,
they’ll just stare.

00:16:24.871 --> 00:16:27.529
These two extremes I can’t understand.

00:16:28.164 --> 00:16:34.664
Now it’s better to keep quiet, or it is difficult

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:38.213
for us to say something pleasant to others.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:40.987
So the first mantra should be,

00:16:41.207 --> 00:16:46.650
“mother teach us some nice things that we can say to others”.

00:16:47.028 --> 00:16:52.305
“what should I say nice tomorrow, or today—let’s say, today

00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:58.178
—when I get up. What should I say?
What would give peace to others?”

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.270
—But not so.

00:17:01.929 --> 00:17:07.039
It’s not never the mind thinks,
now, in the morning I’m going to start

00:17:07.667 --> 00:17:12.793
with a big spoon, hitting everyone, “Get up, get up, get up”.

00:17:13.111 --> 00:17:16.714
The discipline has to come from ‘within’ yourself.

00:17:16.933 --> 00:17:18.936
Nobody has to tell you.

00:17:19.393 --> 00:17:22.060
And when somebody tells, you feel hurt.

00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:29.531
So I don’t know how to tell all this that it goes in the heart

00:17:29.671 --> 00:17:32.404
and doesn’t remain somewhere in the air.

00:17:32.607 --> 00:17:37.599
The discipline of within is like fragrance of flower.

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:41.864
It gives you complete freedom,
and it gives complete freedom to others.

00:17:42.064 --> 00:17:47.115
See, I would say, I have certain bad habits or good habits.

00:17:47.372 --> 00:17:50.785
Supposing I have a key, which is very gross thing: key.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.170
At any cost I will not put it here and there.
I’ll put it at the right place.

00:17:56.785 --> 00:18:01.804
So, if the key is missing
I’m sure it is lost by somebody else and not by me.

00:18:01.964 --> 00:18:06.816
I’m sure about it, because I know myself very well,
I cannot put it anywhere else.

00:18:07.134 --> 00:18:12.193
Are you sure about yourself?
Because you are not disciplined, you are not sure.

00:18:12.372 --> 00:18:14.931
Like I asked somebody “How are you”?

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:22.681
The person says, "mmmmm" french style. And Italian style...

00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:32.264
Confused, I'm confused - Engilsh. Now, what is that?

00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:37.562
Are you realized or not?

00:18:43.157 --> 00:18:47.674
They’ve been very kind, you see, to me, they think.

00:18:48.626 --> 00:18:54.181
Now the time is so short and you are going like this.

00:18:57.515 --> 00:19:03.963
What should I feel? So, today is the day when

00:19:05.283 --> 00:19:11.545
your Mother took out the sword to kill all the enemies,

00:19:11.823 --> 00:19:18.322
and you have to kill the greatest enemy
within your is indiscipline and irresponsibility.

00:19:19.434 --> 00:19:25.857
Funny ideas people use to justify
their stupidity and their indiscipline.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:32.127
I know of a Sahaja Yogi who
would never take a bath, –for a year at least.

00:19:32.456 --> 00:19:34.432
And he was reported to me.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.690
And when I asked him, "Why don’t you take bath?",
he said, “I’m detached”.

00:19:41.321 --> 00:19:46.928
So I said you go and live in Himalayas with this detachment,
you see others are feeling attached.

00:19:47.602 --> 00:19:50.836
Other are feeling impossible to live with you.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.756
You have to be kind to others.

00:19:53.993 --> 00:20:00.006
You have to neat and clean, is a very
simple thing that I have to tell you now.

00:20:00.304 --> 00:20:04.252
All these are the signs of inner cleanliness.

00:20:05.026 --> 00:20:08.756
So we come to the subtler side.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:14.487
And the subtler side of Sahaja Yoga is extremely simple.

00:20:15.293 --> 00:20:17.344
Is Compassion.

00:20:18.436 --> 00:20:20.551
Is Forgiveness.

00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:21.869
Is Love.

00:20:25.678 --> 00:20:31.563
But the greatest of all is the Service to God.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.223
We are doing the work of God.

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:39.941
How can we be tired?

00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:43.770
How can we be unhappy?

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.243
The dynamic is flowing through us,

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:51.013
that Compassion is so fulfilling, that love is so beautifying

00:20:51.172 --> 00:20:55.715
that how can we not do it?

00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:59.120
We should run to do it. But we

00:20:59.497 --> 00:21:05.441
have to know that this love has a “tremendous” urge within itself.

00:21:05.739 --> 00:21:08.437
For example, if you love someone,

00:21:08.874 --> 00:21:12.128
if you have a child, how

00:21:12.783 --> 00:21:17.405
worried you are about that child, how much you work for that child.

00:21:17.941 --> 00:21:20.937
If the compassion is manifested,

00:21:21.493 --> 00:21:25.064
you will see the whole world is created out of that.

00:21:25.352 --> 00:21:27.822
God has created this universe,

00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:31.346
this world and you people out of

00:21:31.525 --> 00:21:35.215
this Compassion only, just His compassion.

00:21:35.433 --> 00:21:40.136
Somebody asked me one day,
“why did you take this headache upon yourself?”

00:21:40.373 --> 00:21:42.409
This headache is so nice,

00:21:42.568 --> 00:21:44.750
is such a beautiful burden,

00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:48.242
because there are so many possibilities.

00:21:48.441 --> 00:21:49.948
So one has to be optimistic.

00:21:50.107 --> 00:21:52.689
But you will realize when you are optimistic,

00:21:52.828 --> 00:21:56.093
you give lectures to others but not to yourself that,

00:21:56.252 --> 00:22:00.478
“ ‘I’ have to optimistic of improving myself.

00:22:00.995 --> 00:22:03.236
Optimistic in my own love.

00:22:03.752 --> 00:22:07.291
It’s so rewarding, it’s so joy giving”.

00:22:09.752 --> 00:22:16.617
Such people come up very fast, their Kundalini rises very fast.

00:22:17.232 --> 00:22:20.656
They don’t use Sahaja Yoga for fulfilling their ego,

00:22:20.895 --> 00:22:28.513
but they use Sahaja Yoga for fulfilling their spirituel accent.
It depends on how you want to use it.

00:22:29.169 --> 00:22:34.131
So today on this day of Ashtami, which is a very powerful day,

00:22:34.449 --> 00:22:41.127
you assume that power within yourself
that I can fight all these horrible diseases within myself.

00:22:41.591 --> 00:22:47.603
And for others I'll have
Compassion and Love— I will have not others.

00:22:48.071 --> 00:22:53.646
This is the point we miss always.
They think “Mother is giving lectures to others not to me.”

00:22:54.004 --> 00:23:00.165
And that Compassion will bring forth the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:00.667 --> 00:23:04.015
There are certain divine laws.

00:23:04.667 --> 00:23:10.491
And you cannot cross them.
If you cross them, I cannot help you at all.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.248
Now if you say,

00:23:12.446 --> 00:23:15.502
“That I put chillies in my eyes, they should not burn”,

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.902
I can’t help.

00:23:17.378 --> 00:23:20.445
Whatever are divine laws you must follow them.

00:23:20.633 --> 00:23:23.546
Like in France if you drive on the right side, you’ll

00:23:23.724 --> 00:23:25.639
jump in the river (gauche-french left)

00:23:25.866 --> 00:23:31.634
Yogi: Gauche is left.
Shri Mataji: No, right.  Yogi: We drive right.

00:23:31.892 --> 00:23:34.215
You drive right?
Yogi: English drive left.

00:23:34.435 --> 00:23:38.137
So, I was saying that if you in France you drive right.

00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:40.563
Then you are in trouble.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.273
Yogi: do you drive right?
Shri Mataji: You drive right?

00:23:44.713 --> 00:23:54.710
I see. So here if you drive left, I will be in trouble I must say!

00:23:56.253 --> 00:23:59.447
Because I don’t understand human laws so well!

00:23:59.995 --> 00:24:05.845
Like in England different law, in France another law,

00:24:06.203 --> 00:24:10.718
in America another law. Funny people.

00:24:11.096 --> 00:24:14.096
But in God’s realm, everywhere the same law.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.400
Whether you are in France, or England, or India, same law.

00:24:18.599 --> 00:24:28.722
Whether on this earth or on the moon, or on the Jupiter, same laws.

00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:32.768
Whether in human beings, animals or nature, same law.

00:24:33.007 --> 00:24:34.990
But you know the law.

00:24:35.685 --> 00:24:39.931
You are the driver, so you have to be careful.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:44.223
If the driver does not know driving laws, God save passengers.

00:24:44.475 --> 00:24:50.387
So one must know that these are the laws of the divine,

00:24:51.062 --> 00:24:53.494
that we have to live with self-respect,

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:57.953
that we have to be chaste, that we have to have dignity,

00:24:58.252 --> 00:25:04.003
that we cannot steal money and steal things and be parasites.

00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:10.284
That we cannot kill others and we cannot beat others
and say harsh things, they are just the same.

00:25:11.276 --> 00:25:15.701
And that we have respect,

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.356
the respect for all that is sublime.

00:25:20.733 --> 00:25:24.067
Respect for all the saints that are Sahaja Yogis.

00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:30.653
And the respect for the leaders who represent you Mother.

00:25:32.003 --> 00:25:37.153
With all this, we are very different people.

00:25:37.709 --> 00:25:43.899
We are different race. We are virtuous,
we are righteous and we are proud to be that way.

00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:47.767
We are sure of everything. We know about every thing.

00:25:48.167 --> 00:25:52.424
And we are personified

00:25:53.238 --> 00:25:58.448
or we are personification of Compassion, of Love of God.

00:25:58.786 --> 00:26:02.773
That’s what we are. We are not ordinary people.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:07.071
I asked a child, “Who is our friend?”

00:26:07.627 --> 00:26:09.472
She said, “Only one”.

00:26:10.147 --> 00:26:14.075
I said, “Why?” “Because she is a Sahaja Yogini,

00:26:14.333 --> 00:26:16.667
the rest are all ordinary people”.

00:26:17.766 --> 00:26:20.801
What about the teacher?  “Very ordinary”.

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:23.638
And what about your Headmistress?

00:26:24.036 --> 00:26:29.769
“She is absolutely ordinary!”
Then I showed her the photograph of the Prime Minister.

00:26:30.653 --> 00:26:34.382
She looked at it and she was quite surprised.

00:26:34.661 --> 00:26:39.454
She said, “this is even more ordinary than my head mistress”.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:43.613
She said with great disgust,

00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:47.393
“Mother why do you keep such photographs with you?”

00:26:48.574 --> 00:26:55.117
That’s what we are. The children understand more than us, isn’t it?

00:26:55.297 --> 00:26:58.540
Because our brain is against us perhaps sometimes;

00:26:58.739 --> 00:27:05.187
over developed brain. So yesterday
I saw many people having Ekadasha, I was surprised.

00:27:05.445 --> 00:27:08.758
So I told them just say, “Mother You be in my head”.

00:27:08.918 --> 00:27:13.036
Because I have no intelligence. I’m too simple.

00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:18.235
You should all become simple like me. Absolutely simple person.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.342
That’s very effective!
