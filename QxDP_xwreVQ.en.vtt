00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:09.464
1997-1004 EP Navaratri Puja P2,
Cabella

01:29:04.591 --> 01:29:09.812
“Litany for the doom of Materasura”

01:29:10.013 --> 01:29:16.622
This is the world that feeds the Swiss
Banks’ Octopus.

01:29:16.873 --> 01:29:23.146
This is the world where too much
is not enough.

01:29:23.347 --> 01:29:28.343
This is the world where negativity
is a plus.

01:29:28.544 --> 01:29:36.267
This is the world where the saints
say: “Enough”.

01:29:52.426 --> 01:29:57.288
1. This is a world where 1.3 billion
people

01:29:57.489 --> 01:30:01.507
live on an income of less
than $1 a day

01:30:01.708 --> 01:30:06.553
and where the planet does not have
enough natural resources

01:30:06.754 --> 01:30:11.546
to sustain, at a worldwide scale,
the consumption pattern

01:30:11.747 --> 01:30:15.483
of Malaysia, leave alone America.

01:30:15.684 --> 01:30:17.497
PLEASE SHRI DURGA,

01:30:17.698 --> 01:30:22.322
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:30:22.523 --> 01:30:27.156
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:30:27.357 --> 01:30:34.905
Shri Durga Namoh Namaha.

01:30:35.106 --> 01:30:38.625
2. This is a world where ten per cent
of world trade

01:30:38.826 --> 01:30:44.007
is generated by drugs and narco-traffics,
or US$100 billion

01:30:44.208 --> 01:30:48.164
represents the amount that yearly
poisons mankind,

01:30:48.365 --> 01:30:51.328
while money laundering in Switzerland
and elsewhere

01:30:51.536 --> 01:30:53.960
has become a most prosperous
activity,

01:30:54.161 --> 01:30:57.788
reaching all levels of society.

01:30:57.989 --> 01:31:01.148
PLEASE SHRI RAKTABIJA VINASHINI,

01:31:01.349 --> 01:31:05.533
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:31:05.734 --> 01:31:10.653
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:31:10.854 --> 01:31:20.445
Shri Raktabija Vinashini
Namoh Namaha.

01:31:20.646 --> 01:31:24.513
3. This is a world where Wall Street
sucks the wealth

01:31:24.714 --> 01:31:28.130
from the working middle class
to bestow it upon the rich

01:31:28.331 --> 01:31:32.568
and where Walt Disney makes you
forget all about it.

01:31:32.769 --> 01:31:35.349
PLEASE SHRI KATYAYANI,

01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:39.737
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:31:39.938 --> 01:31:44.675
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:31:44.876 --> 01:31:54.464
Shri Katyayani Namoh Namaha.

01:31:54.665 --> 01:32:00.402
4. This is a world where an Egyptian
eats at MacDonalds in Cairo

01:32:00.603 --> 01:32:06.054
and a Chinese at Pizza Hut in Beijing,
because modern consumerism

01:32:06.255 --> 01:32:10.969
expresses the lowest common
denominator of world culture

01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:16.742
and erases the meaning of national
values and traditions.

01:32:16.943 --> 01:32:19.772
PLEASE SHRI SHAKAMBARI,

01:32:19.973 --> 01:32:24.085
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:32:24.286 --> 01:32:28.741
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:32:28.942 --> 01:32:36.571
Shri Shakambari Namoh Namaha.

01:32:36.772 --> 01:32:40.981
5. The new multinational entities are
experimenting with new forms

01:32:41.182 --> 01:32:46.030
of dictatorship, setting their production
sites in the developing world,

01:32:46.231 --> 01:32:49.468
reducing to slavery a subdued
working class

01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:54.022
and exploiting children on the altar
of productivity gains.

01:32:54.223 --> 01:32:56.350
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHAKARI,

01:32:56.551 --> 01:33:00.608
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:33:00.809 --> 01:33:05.163
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:33:05.364 --> 01:33:13.218
Shri Rakshakari Namoh Namaha.

01:33:13.489 --> 01:33:18.585
6. The globalization of production and
services allow a few global players

01:33:18.816 --> 01:33:22.639
to befool us and impose the rules
of their game

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.077
to the mass of unsuspecting
consumers.

01:33:26.278 --> 01:33:28.241
PLEASE SHRI BHIMADEVI,

01:33:28.442 --> 01:33:32.327
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:33:32.528 --> 01:33:36.836
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:33:37.037 --> 01:33:46.352
Shri Bhimadevi Namoh Namaha.

01:33:46.553 --> 01:33:51.008
7. Vast restructuration endeavours
are progressively leading

01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:55.362
to the eradication of small and
medium-sized enterprises

01:33:55.563 --> 01:34:01.972
for the benefit of gigantic corporations
operating on a worldwide scale.

01:34:02.173 --> 01:34:03.736
PLEASE SHRI CHANDIKA,

01:34:03.937 --> 01:34:08.739
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:13.626
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:34:13.827 --> 01:34:21.781
Shri Chandika Namoh Namaha.

01:34:21.982 --> 01:34:27.222
8. The gradual concentration of liquid
wealth in the hands of the super rich

01:34:27.423 --> 01:34:32.165
is marginalizing national sovereignty
and its elected officials,

01:34:32.366 --> 01:34:37.011
and is imposing a titanic dimension
to the ruler-ship of money.

01:34:37.212 --> 01:34:38.999
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHASAGNI,

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:42.824
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:34:43.025 --> 01:34:47.918
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:34:48.119 --> 01:34:56.276
Shri Rakshasagni Namoh Namaha.

01:34:56.477 --> 01:34:59.636
9. Greed raised to the power 108

01:34:59.837 --> 01:35:03.251
means the pauperization of the world’s
middle class

01:35:03.467 --> 01:35:07.489
and outrageous wealth for
the remaining 10%.

01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:10.327
PLEASE SHRI DAITYENDRA MARDINI,

01:35:10.528 --> 01:35:14.917
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:35:15.118 --> 01:35:19.541
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:35:19.742 --> 01:35:30.671
Shri Daityendra Mardini Namoh Namaha.

01:35:30.872 --> 01:35:35.741
10. The systematic elimination
of alternative economic solutions,

01:35:35.949 --> 01:35:41.902
unequal trade and financial manipulations
are challenging

01:35:42.104 --> 01:35:46.491
the equitable distribution of wealth
among the population of the world.

01:35:46.692 --> 01:35:48.478
PLEASE SHRI VAJRINI,

01:35:48.679 --> 01:35:51.968
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:35:52.169 --> 01:35:57.201
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:35:57.402 --> 01:36:04.510
Shri Vajrini Namoh Namaha.

01:36:04.711 --> 01:36:09.236
11. The deregulation of the financial
markets has opened wide the gates

01:36:09.437 --> 01:36:14.897
of Jurassic Park for the large financial
predators to roam about

01:36:15.098 --> 01:36:20.098
and thousands of billions of dollars are
created from nothing by speculators

01:36:20.299 --> 01:36:23.653
to feed their unlimited thirst for money
and power.

01:36:23.854 --> 01:36:26.148
PLEASE SHRI UGRACHANDESHWARI,

01:36:26.349 --> 01:36:30.843
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:36:31.044 --> 01:36:35.253
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:36:35.454 --> 01:36:44.778
Shri Ugrachandeshwari Namoh Namaha.

01:36:44.979 --> 01:36:49.736
12. The Swiss financial centre works
as a haven for rich tax-dodgers

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:53.796
from developing countries, and diverts
needed capital

01:36:53.997 --> 01:36:58.022
from national investment programmes,
industrial infrastructures

01:36:58.223 --> 01:37:04.647
and social expenditure to inflate the stock
exchange of the developed countries.

01:37:04.848 --> 01:37:07.230
PLEASE SHRI UGRAPRABHA,

01:37:07.431 --> 01:37:11.472
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:37:11.673 --> 01:37:16.238
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:37:16.439 --> 01:37:25.684
Shri Ugraprabha Namoh Namaha.

01:37:25.885 --> 01:37:30.904
13. The trend of today’s mega mergers
is to marginalize the State,

01:37:31.105 --> 01:37:35.608
bypass national legislation, manipulate
the market,

01:37:35.809 --> 01:37:40.200
control the economy and, for all
practical purposes,

01:37:40.401 --> 01:37:45.619
finish off the social foundations
of real democracy.

01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:47.646
PLEASE SHRI MAHAKALI,

01:37:47.847 --> 01:37:52.532
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:37:52.733 --> 01:37:57.578
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:37:57.779 --> 01:38:06.907
Shri Mahakali Namoh Namaha.

01:38:07.108 --> 01:38:10.777
14. The lure and mirage of such a radical
concentration of wealth

01:38:10.978 --> 01:38:15.480
and power threatens to neutralize
all seeking of the Spirit,

01:38:15.681 --> 01:38:19.517
and the deafening roar of the triumph
of asuric materialism

01:38:19.718 --> 01:38:22.790
destroys the hope of millions
of seekers.

01:38:22.991 --> 01:38:24.736
PLEASE SHRI MAHAMAYA,

01:38:24.937 --> 01:38:29.233
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:38:29.434 --> 01:38:34.175
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:38:34.376 --> 01:38:42.867
Shri Mahamaya Namoh Namaha.

01:38:43.068 --> 01:38:47.576
15. The alliance of mafia, secretive
bankers and corrupt managers

01:38:47.777 --> 01:38:52.947
has infiltrated the world economy and
is threatening the ethics of collectivity

01:38:53.148 --> 01:38:59.563
which provides the foundation for the value
system of our entire civilization.

01:38:59.764 --> 01:39:01.830
PLEASE SHRI VIRATANGANA,

01:39:02.031 --> 01:39:06.748
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:39:06.949 --> 01:39:11.421
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:39:11.622 --> 01:39:21.534
Shri Viratangana Namoh Namaha.

01:39:21.735 --> 01:39:27.068
16. The enormous increase of financial
assets has siphoned cash money

01:39:27.269 --> 01:39:32.026
out of the real economy and channeled it
into the financial markets,

01:39:32.227 --> 01:39:35.424
building up a planetary gambling
casino

01:39:35.625 --> 01:39:39.723
where arbitrary currency speculation
can mount

01:39:39.924 --> 01:39:47.097
huge attacks against any country which
tries to follow socially-minded policies.

01:39:47.298 --> 01:39:49.806
PLEASE SHRI KHADGAPALINI,

01:39:50.007 --> 01:39:54.257
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:39:54.458 --> 01:39:58.679
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:07.027
Shri Khadgapalini Namoh Namaha.

01:40:07.228 --> 01:40:13.100
17. The etheric sophistication of financial
electronic circuits has created

01:40:13.301 --> 01:40:19.535
a virtual world where the immateriality
of money has become the sole reality.

01:40:19.736 --> 01:40:21.343
PLEASE SHRI VISHNUMAYA,

01:40:21.544 --> 01:40:26.110
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:40:26.311 --> 01:40:30.551
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:40:30.752 --> 01:40:38.947
Shri Vishnumaya Namoh Namaha.

01:40:39.148 --> 01:40:42.131
18. The progressive domination
of technology

01:40:42.332 --> 01:40:46.153
is sucking the blood of the farmer,
the artist and the potter,

01:40:46.361 --> 01:40:52.092
turning the man who works with his hands
into a permanently handicapped person.

01:40:52.293 --> 01:40:55.120
PLEASE SHRI DEVA KARYA SAMUDYATA,

01:40:55.321 --> 01:40:59.457
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:40:59.658 --> 01:41:04.097
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:41:04.298 --> 01:41:14.107
Shri Deva Karya Samudyata Namoh Namaha.

01:41:14.308 --> 01:41:19.405
19. The information highway leads
to the maya web of a virtual world

01:41:19.606 --> 01:41:24.346
where human attention is scattered,
desire is confused,

01:41:24.547 --> 01:41:30.018
truth is atomized and the soul
is thereby reduced to slavery.

01:41:30.219 --> 01:41:31.965
PLEASE SHRI RADHA,

01:41:32.166 --> 01:41:36.732
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:41:36.933 --> 01:41:41.168
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:41:41.369 --> 01:41:49.289
Shri Radha Namoh Namaha.

01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:53.269
20. Modern communication can become
a domestic [may that mean “demonic”] tool

01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:57.988
in the hands of a few media moguls
and opinion-making tycoons

01:41:58.189 --> 01:42:05.312
which are spreading their hedonistic
world views of power, money and sex.

01:42:05.513 --> 01:42:07.633
PLEASE SHRI SHUKRATMIKA,

01:42:07.817 --> 01:42:12.287
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:42:12.488 --> 01:42:16.927
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:42:17.128 --> 01:42:25.183
Shri Shukratmika Namoh Namaha.

01:42:25.384 --> 01:42:30.258
21. The Mlechas of Satan have infiltrated
the Internet global village

01:42:30.459 --> 01:42:34.228
to pour pornographic dirt and filth
within the nest

01:42:34.429 --> 01:42:40.231
of the family and to spread hell’s shadows
in the minds of helpless people.

01:42:40.432 --> 01:42:42.462
PLEASE SHRI NIRMALA KUMARI,

01:42:42.663 --> 01:42:47.078
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:42:47.286 --> 01:42:52.219
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:42:52.420 --> 01:43:02.906
Shri Nirmala Kumari Namoh Namaha.

01:43:03.107 --> 01:43:08.119
Hail, salutations to the great Devi!
Aum, Amen.

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:12.371
May there be Auspiciousness,
Joy and Peace.

01:43:12.572 --> 01:43:15.612
May Thy Divine grace penetrate
the waters

01:43:15.813 --> 01:43:19.626
flowing from our mountains to the four
corners of Europe

01:43:19.827 --> 01:43:25.003
and spread the pure vibrations
of the Aquarian Age.

01:43:25.204 --> 01:43:28.920
Salutations to Thee Shri Mataji
Nirmala Devi Ji,

01:43:29.121 --> 01:43:32.944
the Resplendent One, O formidable
Avatar!

01:43:33.145 --> 01:43:37.543
We bow to Thee, most pleasing
yet most frightful,

01:43:37.744 --> 01:43:43.701
who has been approached by the Trimurtis
for the sake of protecting the universe.

01:43:43.902 --> 01:43:47.081
Today, in this festival of Navaratri,

01:43:47.282 --> 01:43:50.767
we chant the litany of Thy children
in Switzerland

01:43:50.968 --> 01:43:53.351
for the defeat of the foes
of the Spirit,

01:43:53.552 --> 01:44:01.417
and we offer to Thy glittering teeth
the new asuric forms of materialism.

01:44:01.618 --> 01:44:03.900
PLEASE SHRI RAKTADANTIKA,

01:44:04.101 --> 01:44:10.540
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:44:10.741 --> 01:44:18.628
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:44:18.829 --> 01:44:25.485
Shri Kalki Sakshat

01:44:25.686 --> 01:44:33.685
Shri Sahastrara Swamini

01:44:33.886 --> 01:44:46.527
Moksha Pradayini Mataji

01:44:46.736 --> 01:45:01.027
Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha.

01:45:08.721 --> 01:45:19.106
It has been such a great treat for us,
not only entertainment,

01:45:20.696 --> 01:45:29.355
but the way for our future – how to move
and what to do.

01:45:29.556 --> 01:45:38.637
It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank
business

01:45:38.838 --> 01:45:45.372
has been attracting My attention
all the time.

01:45:45.993 --> 01:45:52.333
I don’t know much, how they can digest
everything so well.

01:45:55.069 --> 01:46:02.120
In these modern times, when people are
talking of democracy,

01:46:02.321 --> 01:46:05.751
talking of very big ideal things and
all that,

01:46:05.952 --> 01:46:15.339
at the same time how can such a illegal
system exist openly?

01:46:16.319 --> 01:46:20.659
And for that I have a plan.

01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:27.662
As Arneau has said I have to expose, I have
a plan to do something about it.

01:46:27.863 --> 01:46:33.812
As far as the materialism is concerned,
it’s working out.

01:46:34.013 --> 01:46:40.819
All these countries who were supposed to
be very advanced, developed are suffering;

01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:45.776
first from recession – and a terrible
recession.

01:46:45.977 --> 01:46:49.776
That recession is going to give them
a lesson

01:46:49.999 --> 01:46:58.165
about overproduction of nonsensical goods.

01:46:58.452 --> 01:47:06.262
Materialism comes because people have
gone mad with their greed.

01:47:06.904 --> 01:47:15.801
I was searching a house in England – went
round to see houses, and I was surprised

01:47:16.002 --> 01:47:21.393
that all kinds of plastic things and mixed
things and all that,

01:47:21.594 --> 01:47:25.537
were piled up in mountains in every house,
mountains!

01:47:25.738 --> 01:47:33.692
And you pass through a door you will find
two legs of a pant falling on you.

01:47:33.893 --> 01:47:37.507
But not only in England, same in Paris:

01:47:37.708 --> 01:47:42.719
I’ve seen people accumulating so much
of nonsense

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:47.296
that they don’t know where to put it and
what to do.

01:47:47.979 --> 01:47:52.125
This madness is on and on and on.

01:47:52.326 --> 01:47:58.806
Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja
Yogis, what they should do.

01:47:59.007 --> 01:48:03.662
They should try to encourage handicrafts.

01:48:04.525 --> 01:48:09.200
Every country I went to, I bought
handicrafts,

01:48:09.401 --> 01:48:17.223
whether it was Czechoslovakia or England
or anywhere.

01:48:17.424 --> 01:48:23.796
I cannot understand – how can you go
and buy this rubbish of plastic,

01:48:23.997 --> 01:48:26.497
of these useless things?

01:48:26.673 --> 01:48:30.099
And these handicrafts, when I bought,
I was surprised –

01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:37.364
I must tell you about Czechoslovakia that
there were small, small, very small shops

01:48:37.565 --> 01:48:41.774
and they all came, one by one, “Mother,
buy something from us also,

01:48:41.974 --> 01:48:46.915
Mother buy something from us”. You know,
I was surprised, such beautiful things.

01:48:47.116 --> 01:48:54.583
They said, “We cannot sell them.” But all
nonsensical things people are buying.

01:48:54.784 --> 01:48:57.392
So for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow

01:48:57.593 --> 01:49:01.309
that “we’ll only take things which are
handmade”.

01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:09.483
You need not have many things, you can
have few, but something handmade.

01:49:09.684 --> 01:49:16.071
Now, supposing you get a dress, there
should be some handmade embroidery

01:49:16.272 --> 01:49:22.484
or something put it on that, so some labor
is put in into that.

01:49:24.559 --> 01:49:33.050
It is very difficult to see how people
go in for things

01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:41.192
which are very cheap and extremely
troublesome.

01:49:41.393 --> 01:49:44.633
I must tell you one thing, I can’t wear
nylon,

01:49:44.834 --> 01:49:48.954
I can’t wear anything artificial, really,
I can’t.

01:49:49.155 --> 01:49:54.468
For a while, if I even wear socks also,
My whole body starts paining.

01:49:54.669 --> 01:49:57.405
So, it is against you.

01:49:57.606 --> 01:50:06.780
Handmade things are few, I agree, but use
as far as possible handmade things.

01:50:06.981 --> 01:50:12.574
From the Mother Earth they make very nice,
say, terracotta.

01:50:12.775 --> 01:50:16.435
So, I’m a socialist by temperament,
I think.

01:50:16.636 --> 01:50:27.172
So, I felt a great urge that I should
really export nothing but terracotta.

01:50:27.689 --> 01:50:31.467
And terracotta is such a beautiful thing.

01:50:31.668 --> 01:50:36.408
It’s so soothing, it’s so good – it smells
so well.

01:50:36.609 --> 01:50:40.759
But people think, “No, we should buy
something that is made

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:48.812
from America in some machinery thing.”
They go on buying like that.

01:50:50.006 --> 01:50:55.643
In America also I was surprised that
beautiful things are selling

01:50:55.844 --> 01:51:00.554
in shops which they call them as outlets,
very good,

01:51:00.832 --> 01:51:10.300
mostly of silk, or of cotton, and leather –
pure leather.

01:51:10.501 --> 01:51:13.972
But people will go to big, big markets
and buy all nonsense

01:51:14.173 --> 01:51:19.335
at a very high price and not from there –
means they have no wisdom.

01:51:19.514 --> 01:51:25.338
And this is what happens, that the wisdom,
if it is lacking in your sense,

01:51:25.538 --> 01:51:31.134
then this wisdom corrodes the society.

01:51:31.335 --> 01:51:36.467
Because wisdom itself shows

01:51:36.668 --> 01:51:42.732
how dangerous it is to go on buying all
these nonsensical things.

01:51:43.297 --> 01:51:48.266
Also now you are seeing that people
are taking now more

01:51:48.467 --> 01:51:52.443
to Ayurveda and to homeopathy.

01:51:52.644 --> 01:51:58.557
They don’t want to use these horrible
medicines produced by your great country.

01:51:58.758 --> 01:52:07.791
You know what they do, Swiss? They send
very big offers

01:52:07.992 --> 01:52:11.842
to doctors from India to come to work
for them.

01:52:12.043 --> 01:52:16.607
And supposing they have produced one “A”
sample as you’ve shown,

01:52:16.808 --> 01:52:20.748
then the same one they change a little bit
(and) say “It’s better”.

01:52:20.949 --> 01:52:26.537
And you know these medicines, most of them
are very dangerous and troublesome.

01:52:26.738 --> 01:52:30.761
By mistake, My family gave Me these
antibiotics.

01:52:30.962 --> 01:52:36.712
Since then My legs are very weak and
troublesome – I’ve improved, no doubt.

01:52:36.913 --> 01:52:40.542
So, you see, why we are now taking
to this -

01:52:40.743 --> 01:52:46.130
because pollution is there another thing,
which is created by this machinery.

01:52:46.331 --> 01:52:51.028
Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need
to use so much machinery.”

01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:57.329
Now, motor cars – we can walk, we can
use trains,

01:52:57.530 --> 01:53:03.617
but people want to go anywhere by motor
car, even if it is about, say,

01:53:03.818 --> 01:53:09.354
ten meters, they don’t want to walk.
That’s how our health has gone down.

01:53:09.555 --> 01:53:15.313
I must tell you when I was studying in the
school, My school was about five miles.

01:53:15.477 --> 01:53:23.058
And we had a car, and we had also horses,
and what we call is a buggy in our house.

01:53:23.259 --> 01:53:28.492
But it was compulsory for us to walk
five miles in the morning.

01:53:28.693 --> 01:53:31.278
Evening time the car used to come,

01:53:31.479 --> 01:53:37.863
but morning time we all had to walk
five miles to go to our school.

01:53:38.064 --> 01:53:43.921
And in between there was a small, little
mountain which we had to climb.

01:53:44.122 --> 01:53:51.214
That is how we learnt about nature. If you
don’t walk, from the car what do you know?

01:53:51.415 --> 01:53:55.445
At the most you can see some lamppost.

01:53:55.646 --> 01:54:01.427
What do you see from the car? Nothing,
you cannot see the nature.

01:54:01.627 --> 01:54:08.491
And this walking system is very much out
of date now for people. People don’t walk.

01:54:09.506 --> 01:54:16.311
I’m not saying that today we are very
changed, and we are very advanced people.

01:54:16.494 --> 01:54:21.573
In a way we have gone down because
we cannot walk.

01:54:21.774 --> 01:54:25.843
God has given these legs to walk, but
we cannot walk.

01:54:26.044 --> 01:54:32.356
We avoid walking. Now, because of that
so many cars.

01:54:33.250 --> 01:54:38.894
I know that in some families they have
five cars because 5 family members.

01:54:39.095 --> 01:54:43.561
Especially in Spain, I was surprised,
so many cars, so many cars

01:54:43.762 --> 01:54:48.563
and every car has only one person in it
sitting.

01:54:49.408 --> 01:54:54.041
Now, problem has started with the pollution
and all these things,

01:54:54.242 --> 01:55:00.688
because we have lost the habits
of depending upon ourselves.

01:55:01.429 --> 01:55:09.989
Now see what has happened in, say,

01:55:10.190 --> 01:55:16.486
this Kuala Lumpur and all these places
suffering from what you call, the smoke.

01:55:16.696 --> 01:55:21.478
Now I have not done it, if you think that
way. And they are praying to Allah,

01:55:21.679 --> 01:55:24.732
“Give us water”. Why should God give
them water

01:55:24.933 --> 01:55:29.790
when they are doing all kinds of
nonsensical things?

01:55:30.512 --> 01:55:35.273
Now, there is smoke going on, why? Because
they have cut the trees.

01:55:35.474 --> 01:55:43.748
So, why do they want to cut the trees?
Because they want to make money, that’s all.

01:55:43.949 --> 01:55:49.753
Their wood is coming to India, because in
India also they have cut the trees.

01:55:49.954 --> 01:55:54.159
If you go on like this – mad, you will have
pollution, means what?

01:55:54.360 --> 01:56:00.030
Is that, destructive forces will act
and stop it.

01:56:01.827 --> 01:56:05.799
For that you don’t have to pray to
the Goddess, it will work out.

01:56:05.976 --> 01:56:08.711
And it’s all working out everywhere.

01:56:08.912 --> 01:56:14.220
So, whatever you have to have, try to have
something which is handmade.

01:56:14.421 --> 01:56:21.488
Even your clothes - need not be many,
try to have it which are handmade -

01:56:22.921 --> 01:56:26.230
is one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do.

01:56:26.431 --> 01:56:32.119
There need not be to send money to this
Swiss Bank also.

01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:34.871
This Swiss Bank will be very badly exposed
now,

01:56:35.048 --> 01:56:38.826
I’m angry with them for one more thing,
that they had promised that they’ll give

01:56:39.027 --> 01:56:43.553
the money to the Jews and now they are
going like this, they don’t want to give.

01:56:43.754 --> 01:56:48.454
When they will die are they going
to take it with them?

01:56:51.802 --> 01:56:56.667
All these sins will be punished and that is
why I’m very happy

01:56:56.868 --> 01:56:59.718
this he has brought in, because I’ve been
talking about it –

01:56:59.919 --> 01:57:05.733
even in that conference I went to in China,
I talked openly about this Swiss Bank.

01:57:05.934 --> 01:57:12.342
I have talked to many magistrates and
to many, what you call them,

01:57:12.543 --> 01:57:17.062
the head of the law ministry and all that,
and I’ve told them,

01:57:17.263 --> 01:57:24.122
“Why not we have a conference and say
that this banking is nonsense”.

01:57:24.323 --> 01:57:34.445
Now, all types of bad people are taking
advantage of this system

01:57:34.646 --> 01:57:40.157
and are trying to make money, look very
nice or so, I don’t know.

01:57:40.358 --> 01:57:42.704
So many have lost their money there,

01:57:42.881 --> 01:57:45.436
I don’t know what was the need to put
all this money there.

01:57:45.637 --> 01:57:49.857
That when they die, their children do not
get anything.

01:57:50.058 --> 01:57:58.902
But the problem is this greed, is some sort
of a inner defect in a human being.

01:57:59.799 --> 01:58:10.811
He becomes greedy, greedy because he has
deviated from dharma.

01:58:12.571 --> 01:58:18.239
He thinks he can get pleasure out
of things, he cannot.

01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:23.862
And he goes on accumulating and buying
and this and that.

01:58:24.063 --> 01:58:31.125
I would say your Mother also does that.
I buy, but I buy things which are handmade.

01:58:31.331 --> 01:58:37.345
So that tomorrow, if I have to give it
presents, or if I have to sell off things,

01:58:37.546 --> 01:58:42.631
even the ornaments you have given Me,
I didn’t know what to do, I’m selling them.

01:58:42.832 --> 01:58:52.217
What will I do with the ornaments – I have
to buy so many ashrams, this, that.

01:58:52.418 --> 01:58:55.368
My family ornaments also I’m selling,

01:58:55.569 --> 01:58:59.962
because I spent money on My family things
also.

01:59:00.163 --> 01:59:07.174
Just think of it, what is all this for,
what pleasure does it give us?

01:59:07.357 --> 01:59:11.259
I can understand, if you want to give
somebody a present,

01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:18.093
or somebody you want to give some
happiness, joy – you should do it,

01:59:18.294 --> 01:59:25.412
but just for yourself go on, go on, how
much can you digest it? You cannot.

01:59:25.613 --> 01:59:29.240
Joy is much more in giving to others.

01:59:29.441 --> 01:59:37.729
It’s not, it’s not a thing that gives you
any understanding of the fundamentals,

01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:43.645
and the fundamentals is that you are
dharma.

01:59:43.846 --> 01:59:51.613
Within you is that, that is your valency,
and this materialism absolutely against it,

01:59:51.814 --> 02:00:04.261
because it creates all kinds of people:
mafias, this Swiss bank, cheats -

02:00:04.462 --> 02:00:09.284
we have communities after communities
who are known to be cheats,

02:00:09.485 --> 02:00:13.693
who are very materialistic, they have
no spiritual sense.

02:00:13.894 --> 02:00:18.477
So for Sahaja Yogis, I would say -
of course you have said all the mantras

02:00:18.678 --> 02:00:22.583
so I’m supposed to do all that.
But what you have to do

02:00:22.784 --> 02:00:28.139
is not to buy any more anything which is
not handmade. Try it.

02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:30.740
At least, there should be some embroidery,

02:00:30.941 --> 02:00:35.345
at least, there should be some work
done on it.

02:00:35.551 --> 02:00:39.943
I’m surprised that these things are
not very good for us,

02:00:40.144 --> 02:00:42.904
they are injurious to our health.

02:00:43.105 --> 02:00:48.244
So Sahaja Yogis must learn that they
have to walk.

02:00:48.445 --> 02:00:53.252
They must walk and they must see
the nature, what is in the nature.

02:00:53.453 --> 02:00:58.998
Many of you don’t know what - say, I ask
the name of this flower,

02:00:59.199 --> 02:01:02.382
how many of you know?

02:01:06.970 --> 02:01:15.285
It’s a very sweet name, “Kiss Me Quick”,
apart from its botanical name.

02:01:15.486 --> 02:01:19.575
But it is, you see, what I’m saying,
everything you should know -

02:01:19.776 --> 02:01:26.655
you should know about small, small things,
from where do this embroidery comes?

02:01:26.856 --> 02:01:29.939
From where does this sari comes?

02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:35.921
Our Indian men are the worst, I would say,
they don’t know anything whatsoever.

02:01:36.122 --> 02:01:40.188
But even western men also have the same
problem.

02:01:40.389 --> 02:01:44.447
You must take interest in things in which
you have not taken interest.

02:01:44.643 --> 02:01:48.924
For example, Indians don’t know how
to cook, they don’t know!

02:01:49.125 --> 02:01:52.371
Once My husband told Me that he knows
how to cook.

02:01:52.572 --> 02:01:56.746
I said, “What? He said, “I’ll make
chapatis, rotis.”

02:01:56.947 --> 02:02:03.142
And what he made was nothing –
Australia, America, this, that.

02:02:04.806 --> 02:02:10.891
But he said, “I give up because I was doing
shipping, but shipping means shipping.”

02:02:12.784 --> 02:02:20.078
But minute things you can see, what we
call is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

02:02:20.279 --> 02:02:26.201
If you walk, look at the nature, love
the trees, love the animals.

02:02:26.402 --> 02:02:30.127
You’ll be amazed, there are so many
things to be known

02:02:30.328 --> 02:02:34.058
than reading newspaper, what is there
to read in the newspaper?

02:02:34.259 --> 02:02:39.514
For hours together you go on reading
newspaper, next day you forget it.

02:02:39.715 --> 02:02:46.982
You’ll be amazed that they say that
for Goddess it is said that

02:02:47.183 --> 02:02:53.893
“Kataksha Kataksha Nirikshana” – every
glance, She knows everything.

02:02:54.094 --> 02:03:00.961
Any glance She puts on any man, woman
or anything, She knows where it is.

02:03:01.162 --> 02:03:04.233
And if you are My children you should
also try that,

02:03:04.394 --> 02:03:08.245
because I always used to run out
into jungles, in the forest,

02:03:08.446 --> 02:03:14.963
I used to go to all such places and really
enjoy the beautiful Mother,

02:03:15.164 --> 02:03:20.191
this Mother Earth who has created such
a beautiful thing.

02:03:20.392 --> 02:03:25.535
Have you noticed just now that the colors
of the background

02:03:25.736 --> 02:03:32.569
which were made by the Russians and
the colors of this facing thing

02:03:32.770 --> 02:03:39.051
are just the same, they have used the same
colors. It’s true collectivity.

02:03:39.252 --> 02:03:44.559
Now, you notice in the nature it’s so
matching, you know.

02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:47.438
Nothing gross, nothing loud – it’s
so beautiful,

02:03:47.639 --> 02:03:51.701
this is red but it has green to match it.

02:03:51.902 --> 02:03:55.400
This Mother Earth knows everything,
She understands everything,

02:03:55.601 --> 02:04:00.631
She does everything, but what do we do
for Mother Earth? –

02:04:00.832 --> 02:04:05.219
Is to run after artificial things,
machinery, this thing –

02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:09.206
and now a new thing has come, is computer.

02:04:10.650 --> 02:04:12.917
It’s all right if you want to write letters
to someone,

02:04:13.118 --> 02:04:16.131
but otherwise it’s quite maddening,
you know.

02:04:16.332 --> 02:04:20.250
And this computer will make our brain
absolutely zero.

02:04:20.451 --> 02:04:24.561
We’ll be paralyzed, we won’t be able
to think 2 + 2.

02:04:24.762 --> 02:04:29.922
So, anything that you want to use also,
should have its maryadas,

02:04:30.123 --> 02:04:33.741
don’t go beyond it. If you take
to swimming,

02:04:33.942 --> 02:04:37.218
you’ll go on swimming till you get sick.

02:04:37.432 --> 02:04:42.782
If you are horse-riding, you’ll go on
horse-riding till you fall down.

02:04:42.983 --> 02:04:49.645
You see, this is also a kind of a life
which has no maryadas –

02:04:49.846 --> 02:04:56.779
like greed has no maryadas, that’s how
also this kind of nonsense,

02:04:56.980 --> 02:05:00.383
“I am only fond of this, I am only
fond of this.”

02:05:00.584 --> 02:05:04.000
You are a human being, you should never
say like that.

02:05:04.201 --> 02:05:08.269
On the contrary you should say, “I must
learn this, I must know this,

02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:12.651
what is this all about?”. It is very
important,

02:05:12.852 --> 02:05:17.970
otherwise your personality will be a dwarf
personality –

02:05:18.171 --> 02:05:23.394
and ultimately people end up in money.
I don’t understand.

02:05:23.595 --> 02:05:27.640
I can’t even count 200 notes, can’t even.

02:05:27.841 --> 02:05:31.599
I don’t know about money, I should say.
But I’m good at mathematics -

02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:35.613
but I don’t know, whatever money you are
giving goes direct to them

02:05:35.814 --> 02:05:38.592
and they do it what they like. Now,
if somebody says,

02:05:38.793 --> 02:05:41.668
“How much You got for this?”
“I don’t know”.

02:05:41.869 --> 02:05:48.013
“How much for royalties?” “I don’t know”,
because I’m not interested.

02:05:48.214 --> 02:05:52.694
I’m not interested. What is there to be
so much interested in money?

02:05:52.895 --> 02:05:58.812
But I get money, all right, no problem,
never a problem.

02:05:59.013 --> 02:06:01.830
I sold one of My ornaments

02:06:02.031 --> 02:06:06.726
and I got at least 100 times more
than what I have spent.

02:06:06.926 --> 02:06:11.235
Maybe you might say it’s vibrations,
whatever you may say.

02:06:11.436 --> 02:06:22.180
So to get after money means you get
very much in the clutches of money.

02:06:22.807 --> 02:06:28.290
So what is the solution, to get rid
of this greed?

02:06:28.504 --> 02:06:33.946
Is to try and give it to others and see
the joy.

02:06:35.234 --> 02:06:43.369
Give something to others, share and see
the joy you feel by giving something.

02:06:45.676 --> 02:06:48.890
I must tell you, Gregoire is not her
but I am missing him

02:06:49.091 --> 02:06:54.395
because once I went to a sari shop
and wanted to buy one sari

02:06:54.596 --> 02:06:57.075
but I thought “It’s rather expensive,

02:06:57.276 --> 02:07:02.899
why should I buy such an expensive sari”,
came away.

02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:09.077
And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same
sari on My birthday

02:07:09.278 --> 02:07:13.789
and I was so filled with joy, because
he bought it next day,

02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:20.241
went and bought it from that shop, kept it
with him and on My birthday he gave Me.

02:07:22.642 --> 02:07:26.314
These small, small things can give you
great joy

02:07:26.515 --> 02:07:32.395
in giving people, other people,
not yourself.

02:07:32.596 --> 02:07:37.178
I don’t know if I have bought anything
much for Myself in My lifetime, never.

02:07:37.379 --> 02:07:39.660
Even if I go out shopping, even if
I am thirsty,

02:07:39.861 --> 02:07:43.978
I won’t even buy one Coca-Cola for Myself.

02:07:44.179 --> 02:07:48.321
People know that I don’t buy anything
for Myself,

02:07:48.522 --> 02:07:51.796
practically nothing, but you all give Me
so much, what to do.

02:07:51.997 --> 02:07:59.180
Now, I have decided that after these
75 years of age,

02:07:59.381 --> 02:08:03.110
I shouldn’t take anything from you
whatsoever.

02:08:03.311 --> 02:08:06.014
But to please you maybe, they are asking
that,

02:08:06.215 --> 02:08:10.886
“Only take a national, international”,
all right. But no more,

02:08:11.087 --> 02:08:15.816
every country shouldn’t bring. What
after all this national, international –

02:08:16.017 --> 02:08:21.369
you are all international people, what is
the need to bring any present for Me?

02:08:21.570 --> 02:08:25.731
I don’t even have time to see them.

02:08:26.638 --> 02:08:33.287
I’m so very busy with other things, because
there are so many problems in this world.

02:08:33.509 --> 02:08:37.214
So, I would suggest that, to get over
all these things

02:08:37.415 --> 02:08:41.396
we should see ourselves, what we are
doing about it.

02:08:41.605 --> 02:08:45.982
I’m sure none of you have money
in the Swiss Bank, thank God.

02:08:46.183 --> 02:08:52.284
But never earn more than what you can –
you have, there’s no need.

02:08:52.485 --> 02:08:57.158
Whatever comes your way is all right.
Of course if you are doing some work

02:08:57.359 --> 02:09:04.557
of creativity, of creating some designs,
creating something is all right.

02:09:05.448 --> 02:09:09.205
But don’t buy things, go on buying things
for yourself

02:09:09.406 --> 02:09:17.349
or putting then money here, hiding, hiding
there, there’s no need.

02:09:17.739 --> 02:09:23.252
You see, you’ll feel so satisfied and
so happy being honest,

02:09:23.453 --> 02:09:31.117
being absolutely beyond any problem.

02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:37.003
Now this mafia business is there, I agree
with you. Now this mafia can be controlled

02:09:37.204 --> 02:09:43.010
only by the government because they give
such a big tax.

02:09:43.211 --> 02:09:46.918
Now I mean, for example, an artisan
in this poor country -

02:09:47.119 --> 02:09:51.840
I will say poor because most of the people
are suffering from tax –

02:09:52.041 --> 02:09:58.296
you see, he has to pay 265 types of taxes.

02:09:59.414 --> 02:10:04.241
Italians are known for their art, they make
beautiful things,

02:10:04.442 --> 02:10:08.644
but they cannot because they have to pay
so much taxation.

02:10:08.845 --> 02:10:11.983
Only the designers they make the money.

02:10:12.183 --> 02:10:17.047
Designers make the money befooling
everybody.

02:10:18.598 --> 02:10:26.470
They befool people so much. Once My husband
went to Cairo and bought one scarf for Me.

02:10:27.718 --> 02:10:30.324
So, he said, “This is designer’s.”

02:10:30.525 --> 02:10:35.618
I said, “This looks Indian to me, this is
an Indian thing.”

02:10:35.819 --> 02:10:41.049
And surprisingly in the corner it was
written “Made in India”.

02:10:42.129 --> 02:10:49.145
He paid £25 for that, in India you can
get it for £2.

02:10:50.592 --> 02:10:54.603
So, this is another thing is to run a race
of eliteness.

02:10:54.804 --> 02:10:58.795
You see this one was bought by
My son-in-law.

02:10:58.996 --> 02:11:03.986
I said: “What is so special?”
He said, “It’s very great, you know.”

02:11:04.194 --> 02:11:07.956
I didn’t know what was so special about
those spectacles.

02:11:08.157 --> 02:11:14.381
So, I went to one shop in America

02:11:14.582 --> 02:11:17.566
and they all started saying, “Madam,
Madam, Madam …”.

02:11:17.767 --> 02:11:22.344
I said, “What is so Madam about Me?.
Why are they calling Me ‘Madam’?”

02:11:22.545 --> 02:11:29.081
“Oh, You don’t know?” - they said - “This
is Cartier.” I said, “Who is this Cartier?”

02:11:29.282 --> 02:11:33.795
So I’m going to put Kartikeya against him!

02:11:35.957 --> 02:11:43.952
All such stupid ideas, you see, and then
they bought Me a…

02:11:44.153 --> 02:11:52.661
[Aside: “What you call that? The watch was…
what was that watch? Ah, Patek Philippe!] -

02:11:52.862 --> 02:11:57.519
Patek Philippe, that watch they brought
for Me

02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:02.349
and it would not run in time. I said,
“What is this?

02:12:02.984 --> 02:12:07.404
Never keeps the time, it’s always
out of time.

02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:11.136
My vibrations must be trying some tricks”.

02:12:11.337 --> 02:12:15.102
So I gave it to one of them, I said, “Baba,
show this to the Patek Phillips.”

02:12:15.388 --> 02:12:19.383
Ah, that day Mathias was here. “This
will hit their ego, Mother, very much”.

02:12:19.584 --> 02:12:23.529
I said, “Why?” “Because they think
they are the best.”

02:12:24.196 --> 02:12:28.358
I said, “Whatever it is, tell them you
change it, it doesn’t keep to time.”

02:12:28.559 --> 02:12:32.079
Then I asked My daughter to have it,
I said, “Baba, I can’t make …

02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:36.645
I don’t know why, maybe I will have
something simple, it’s better.”

02:12:36.846 --> 02:12:43.009
That too again turned out to be a,
what you call? ‘Designers’.

02:12:43.210 --> 02:12:47.880
They are now all - most of these designers
are in jail.

02:12:48.081 --> 02:12:53.153
And some of them met Me when I was
coming from Russia.

02:12:53.354 --> 02:12:57.841
They are absolutely useless people,
you know.

02:12:58.042 --> 02:13:00.762
They take out some idea and sell it
for a high price

02:13:00.971 --> 02:13:09.625
and if you are a fool you go and buy that.
Did you notice that this is Cartier?

02:13:12.058 --> 02:13:17.856
For Sahaja Yogis are simple people. Now
this is the thing is that there are,

02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:21.314
these are also mafias, I tell you, these
are also mafias.

02:13:21.515 --> 02:13:25.460
And these mafias are exploiting you,
I’ve written it in My book also,

02:13:25.661 --> 02:13:30.074
if you read it, how these entrepreneurs
are trying to befool you.

02:13:30.275 --> 02:13:37.113
You wear simple dress, simple from
handmade – will be much better

02:13:37.314 --> 02:13:43.543
than to wear something that makes you
look like something out of the blue.

02:13:44.309 --> 02:13:49.714
And there is no need because it is just
satisfying your ego.

02:13:49.915 --> 02:13:59.469
Some people have a habit – as soon as –
say, I have, supposing some dinner set,

02:13:59.670 --> 02:14:04.235
may not be good or… - they’ll come and see
the back of the dinner plate.

02:14:04.436 --> 02:14:09.149
“Ah, from where did You get it?” –
“I don’t know.” “You don’t know?”

02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:13.321
“No, no, this was, I think, I think somebody
gave Me, I don’t know, I don’t know.”

02:14:13.535 --> 02:14:16.278
“No, no, You better find out, because
very nice.”

02:14:16.446 --> 02:14:19.567
Next day they’ll go round the whole place
to find out

02:14:19.768 --> 02:14:23.548
if they can get the same dinner set.

02:14:23.749 --> 02:14:28.171
And Sahaja Yoga is just the opposite.
I tell you, you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

02:14:28.372 --> 02:14:37.933
Once My husband liked one tea set. So
you know London has huge, big stores.

02:14:38.134 --> 02:14:41.985
Some of them are really horrid.
I went there –

02:14:42.186 --> 02:14:46.221
baarpre baap - we walked and walked
and walked through so many.

02:14:46.422 --> 02:14:50.207
They said, “All right, we promise after
6 months.” Another said, “7 months”,

02:14:50.408 --> 02:14:57.803
another said, “8 months, you give us
the order.” So I gave up the idea.

02:14:58.091 --> 02:15:00.792
Then C.P. said, “What has happened
to their factories?”

02:15:01.022 --> 02:15:03.825
I said, “They don’t have anything, they
are exporting.”

02:15:04.026 --> 02:15:10.989
Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed
- and there for a special price,

02:15:11.190 --> 02:15:17.111
just for propagating, they had put
these tea sets there.

02:15:17.833 --> 02:15:23.379
Imagine, in Australia, and I got it
for the half price.

02:15:23.996 --> 02:15:30.100
So, if you don’t have greed you get
what you want just there.

02:15:32.427 --> 02:15:35.788
Just there you get it.

02:15:36.742 --> 02:15:42.222
But if you have greed, then God makes
you dance. All right?

02:15:42.432 --> 02:15:46.904
That is what is so simple as that -
whatever you want you can get it,

02:15:47.105 --> 02:15:50.621
if you don’t have greed about it.

02:15:50.828 --> 02:15:56.610
That’s such an enslaving thing within us,
that we have greed.

02:15:56.811 --> 02:16:03.316
I mean I can give you 1,001 examples
of that, 1,001.

02:16:03.517 --> 02:16:09.474
That if you don’t ask for anything, if you
don’t desire for anything,

02:16:09.675 --> 02:16:15.768
you get what you need, whatever you need
you get.

02:16:16.427 --> 02:16:23.682
But if you go on desiring, then go mad
after it. Go there, get this and get lost.

02:16:24.054 --> 02:16:27.523
And then the thing also gets lost.

02:16:27.724 --> 02:16:34.971
That’s why it is said, better try
to develop a detachment.

02:16:35.309 --> 02:16:40.334
It’s all right, if it is there well and
good, if it is not there, doesn’t matter.

02:16:41.587 --> 02:16:45.298
Then you’ll be surprised your attention
will be so subtle.

02:16:45.499 --> 02:16:51.471
Now none of you I think have seen these
beautiful flowers, what are there.

02:16:51.672 --> 02:16:57.271
The beautiful embroidery that is there.
The way they have done this.

02:16:57.472 --> 02:17:02.571
Now can you tell Me how many there are,
hands in this work –

02:17:05.052 --> 02:17:14.418
14, 28. This side 14, this side 14.

02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:26.143
I mean, inclusive of all these other
things.

02:17:27.608 --> 02:17:33.460
So you don’t notice anything and your
attention becomes…

02:17:33.661 --> 02:17:38.281
“Mahamaya” - they say has been - “it has
been the Mahamaya”. This is no explanation.

02:17:38.482 --> 02:17:45.284
Your attention if it is clear, is simple,
you can see the thing clearly.

02:17:46.926 --> 02:17:52.251
And with that attention only, that
attention yourself

02:17:53.135 --> 02:17:55.724
takes you to the right place where you
have to go,

02:17:55.925 --> 02:17:59.823
you get the right thing what you want
to buy.

02:18:03.129 --> 02:18:07.624
Can you tell Me you see these carpets
are from where?

02:18:13.804 --> 02:18:17.150
They are mostly from Russia.

02:18:18.862 --> 02:18:27.603
I went to Russia and I saw this carpet
factory. They have no sense of export also.

02:18:27.804 --> 02:18:32.848
So I told them that, “How much will
a carpet cost?” - Doctor knows -

02:18:33.049 --> 02:18:38.472
They said, “Only $20.” I said, “Baba,
$20 for a carpet?”

02:18:38.673 --> 02:18:42.556
So, I told Doctor, “Now what to do,
we have to buy many”.

02:18:42.757 --> 02:18:47.905
I said, “How much for export?” “$200.”

02:18:48.483 --> 02:18:52.611
I said, “In India the other way round.
If you have to export something,

02:18:52.812 --> 02:18:58.127
then the price is less.” I said,
“All right,

02:18:58.328 --> 02:19:02.262
so I guess we must think of the solution
because I need it.”

02:19:02.463 --> 02:19:06.700
So I asked about 20 Sahaja Yogis to go
and buy each one.

02:19:06.908 --> 02:19:12.143
To Russians they give for $20.
I said, “All right, you bring these.”

02:19:13.319 --> 02:19:19.471
So, you should go in for solutions and not
for problems.

02:19:19.672 --> 02:19:24.705
Greed is a problem, greed is a problem.

02:19:24.906 --> 02:19:27.802
How to get rid of the greed is the point.

02:19:28.003 --> 02:19:31.652
And to get rid of the greed is that
if I buy something –

02:19:31.853 --> 02:19:37.162
for whom should I buy this one, for whom
should I buy?

02:19:37.363 --> 02:19:42.973
Ah, this will be all right for another
friend of mine, like that.

02:19:43.174 --> 02:19:49.979
If you train your mind on these lines,
not for yourself, but for others,

02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:56.184
then you’ll be amazed this greed will run
away and you’ll have joy.

02:19:56.978 --> 02:20:01.571
As you want to give Me things, I understand
that, I also want to give you.

02:20:01.772 --> 02:20:07.585
In the same way, think of all others,
they are all brothers and sisters.

02:20:08.477 --> 02:20:12.837
From other countries, make friends
with other countries.

02:20:13.038 --> 02:20:17.008
If giving is there, then this greed goes
away (indistinct)

02:20:17.209 --> 02:20:22.862
and you get what you want. It’s a very
simple mantra.

02:20:24.599 --> 02:20:34.438
It’s surprising, so far, with all
the miracles,

02:20:34.639 --> 02:20:39.524
we don’t understand that whatever
we need also be provided for.

02:20:39.725 --> 02:20:46.823
But you must need it, not for stupid
collection of things.

02:20:48.154 --> 02:20:53.481
This was a very, very good thing, acted
very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly,

02:20:53.682 --> 02:20:59.712
this Swiss Bank laundering. I know
My country suffers from it.

02:21:00.354 --> 02:21:05.404
Now, the another drama, which was done
by the English,

02:21:05.605 --> 02:21:11.610
shows – it’s a – “Pilgrim’s Progress” is
an old, quite an old drama,

02:21:11.811 --> 02:21:16.947
which I have read long time back. But this
is the real pilgrims they have shown,

02:21:17.148 --> 02:21:21.836
how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods,

02:21:22.037 --> 02:21:26.474
and throughout they have very nicely
brought in how even a Sahaja Yogi,

02:21:26.675 --> 02:21:32.455
while rising, falls into different pits.
So it’s a very good thing for you to know

02:21:32.656 --> 02:21:38.069
that if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be
very careful, and you should see that

02:21:38.270 --> 02:21:45.307
you don’t fall into these pits and
ultimately the ego and superego.

02:21:46.097 --> 02:21:53.798
In the west the problem is more of ego,
not of superego. And for ego,

02:21:58.616 --> 02:22:06.171
to accept that you have ego is the only
way; and then it will drop out.

02:22:06.372 --> 02:22:10.706
If you know there is ego, ego will
drop out.

02:22:11.651 --> 02:22:16.790
The simple thing is to know that you have
ego. Ego of something.

02:22:16.991 --> 02:22:20.239
People have ego of any nonsense, you know.

02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:23.619
There was one lady very proud
and egoistical.

02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:29.924
So I asked about her, “What is the matter
with her?”

02:22:30.125 --> 02:22:33.245
“Because she knows how to make dolls” –
Why?

02:22:33.446 --> 02:22:37.078
That should give you ego or what?
I didn’t understand that part.

02:22:37.279 --> 02:22:41.025
But this is what it is, even for small
things people have ego,

02:22:41.226 --> 02:22:49.274
and all this designing and all that
is based on your stupid ego

02:22:49.475 --> 02:22:53.882
which makes you buy all these things
to show off your ego.

02:22:54.083 --> 02:23:01.544
So try to be humble – humble and try
to understand

02:23:01.745 --> 02:23:06.701
that all these worldly things we are not
going to take them with us.

02:23:06.902 --> 02:23:09.588
They are going to lie down here. I am not
saying you renounce.

02:23:09.802 --> 02:23:13.734
I’m not saying you take sanyasa, but you
should know that

02:23:13.935 --> 02:23:17.742
the value of these things is nothing
compared to you.

02:23:17.943 --> 02:23:20.408
When ego comes, this idiocity comes in.

02:23:20.609 --> 02:23:27.093
You think by wearing something great
you are very much influencing others.

02:23:27.294 --> 02:23:34.427
You may, but those who are influenced
are another set of fools, I must say.

02:23:34.628 --> 02:23:41.630
Once I was wearing a ring and I went
to shopping in one of the places

02:23:41.831 --> 02:23:45.256
and they were so respectful to Me.
I said, “Suddenly the shopkeepers,

02:23:45.457 --> 02:23:50.247
they never respect Me because I’m
an Indian – what has happened?”

02:23:50.409 --> 02:23:54.497
So I had gone to a shop where the lady
was known to Me.

02:23:54.698 --> 02:24:00.526
She said, “May I ask You, is this real?”
I said, “What do you mean, real?”

02:24:00.727 --> 02:24:06.182
“Is it a real emerald?” “Yes, yes, very old
from My family.”

02:24:06.407 --> 02:24:10.111
“Ah, so Your family very rich?”

02:24:10.312 --> 02:24:16.446
“No, no, it was from My forefathers,
I’m just wearing that.”

02:24:16.647 --> 02:24:21.702
“Oh my God, if it is real, what will be
the price?” I said, “How will I know,

02:24:21.903 --> 02:24:26.192
it was bought long time back, I don’t know
the price.” “No, can you get me one?”

02:24:26.393 --> 02:24:30.637
I said, “Why do you want to have it,
you can have this one if you like.”

02:24:30.838 --> 02:24:38.296
Like that, you know, a small thing makes
them so…, that you are so great. It’s not.

02:24:38.497 --> 02:24:42.267
What is the greatest thing in us is
our Spirit,

02:24:42.468 --> 02:24:47.181
is the Spirit that we have and we should
know that we should be proud of it,

02:24:47.382 --> 02:24:50.125
that we have got the Spirit within us.

02:24:50.326 --> 02:24:55.856
And if you become proud, then you will not
do nonsensical things.

02:24:56.057 --> 02:24:59.547
You are people who are all realized souls.

02:24:59.748 --> 02:25:04.617
And already, you have crossed over this
pilgrims stage, you are much above that.

02:25:04.818 --> 02:25:09.189
Now the greatest thing is to know that
we are spiritual people

02:25:09.390 --> 02:25:17.006
and as spiritual people – you even
dominate Me, in a way.

02:25:17.207 --> 02:25:21.113
If you all desire for something, I can’t
get over it.

02:25:21.313 --> 02:25:28.304
I have to accept. I have to keep you
pleased.

02:25:28.505 --> 02:25:33.168
Many things I’m doing just because
you want it;

02:25:33.369 --> 02:25:38.452
doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter to Me
because nothing comes over My head.

02:25:38.653 --> 02:25:41.857
So it’s all right, whatever children want,
let them do.

02:25:42.058 --> 02:25:49.095
But the one point is this ego has to be
really under control.

02:25:50.101 --> 02:25:53.706
There’s one little more point I want
to tell you,

02:25:53.907 --> 02:25:55.947
because tomorrow I may not be able to say,

02:25:56.148 --> 02:26:00.638
in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other
things, is this –

02:26:00.839 --> 02:26:06.986
I wanted to talk to people who are married
in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies.

02:26:07.187 --> 02:26:14.196
I think some of them are extremely
dominating and stupid.

02:26:14.529 --> 02:26:20.708
What is marriage? Marriage is honeymoon
as they call it.

02:26:20.909 --> 02:26:25.904
Honey is the essence and moon is the peace.

02:26:26.105 --> 02:26:32.237
Now if the women are quarrelsome,
fighting, sarcastic,

02:26:32.438 --> 02:26:36.867
it is absolutely a hell for man.

02:26:38.193 --> 02:26:44.114
Instead of that, if woman knows
the essence, the honey,

02:26:44.315 --> 02:26:50.304
she should know how to please the husband,
to bring peace in the family.

02:26:50.505 --> 02:26:55.376
Now some of the husbands are drunkards
or anything – not in Sahaja Yoga.

02:26:55.521 --> 02:26:58.862
What pleases the husband?

02:27:00.374 --> 02:27:03.761
You see, in a way, it’s a trick.

02:27:03.962 --> 02:27:09.656
It’s a trick of a realized soul, how
to please others.

02:27:09.857 --> 02:27:14.720
What do we do to our husbands?
Do we try to please?

02:27:14.921 --> 02:27:18.581
First of all find out what he likes.

02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:23.276
My husband, I would say - he’s gone away,
thank God -

02:27:23.477 --> 02:27:26.342
he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear
any flower in your head.”

02:27:26.543 --> 02:27:31.085
But in Maharashtra all the married women
are supposed to wear flowers.

02:27:31.286 --> 02:27:36.781
Since that day I have never worn any flower
in My head.

02:27:36.982 --> 02:27:42.653
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, he didn’t
know what I was,

02:27:42.854 --> 02:27:46.209
so he said, “Don’t wear any flowers,
I don’t like.” Then he said,

02:27:46.410 --> 02:27:49.838
“You must wear bangles” because he comes
from a very traditional family.

02:27:50.039 --> 02:27:56.921
All My life I have worn bangles. It pleases
him, what’s the matter?

02:27:57.122 --> 02:28:00.611
Little, little things you do just to please
him,

02:28:00.788 --> 02:28:04.899
then he also starts thinking, “See, what
should I do for My wife?”.

02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:09.674
But first it must start from woman,
not from man,

02:28:09.875 --> 02:28:13.307
because women are responsible
for the society.

02:28:13.508 --> 02:28:19.786
In the western culture they had not told
what is their job is.

02:28:19.987 --> 02:28:24.602
Man’s job is economics, politics,
money earning.

02:28:24.803 --> 02:28:30.278
They have made a mess out of it, I agree
with you. It’s quite a big mess.

02:28:30.479 --> 02:28:34.898
But your job is to make the society.

02:28:35.099 --> 02:28:39.658
And to make the society, first you must
know how to keep children pleased,

02:28:39.859 --> 02:28:44.242
how to keep your husband pleased, how
to help and be close to them (Unclear).

02:28:44.443 --> 02:28:49.875
On the contrary, if you try all the time
to dominate,

02:28:50.076 --> 02:28:52.679
that’s not your job to dominate at all.

02:28:52.880 --> 02:29:01.739
Your job is to make neutralize his
domination by simple, simple things.

02:29:02.596 --> 02:29:08.292
I’ll give you an example. Thank God
he is not here!

02:29:10.002 --> 02:29:16.401
He knows, he knows I’m very, I am very
clever in certain things.

02:29:16.602 --> 02:29:22.189
In his office he had a gentleman. I never
used to interfere with his office.

02:29:22.390 --> 02:29:25.365
But there was one gentleman, good one,

02:29:25.566 --> 02:29:29.536
who gave up his organization and joined
another one

02:29:29.737 --> 02:29:33.587
because it was a private one, he was
getting more money, so he joined that.

02:29:33.788 --> 02:29:40.683
But there he found it was horrible, so he
wanted to come back to Shipping Corporation.

02:29:41.457 --> 02:29:44.420
But My husband is very particular about
rules and regulations.

02:29:44.621 --> 02:29:47.445
He said, “No, no, no, now I won’t have you,
I don’t want to see your face, get out”,

02:29:47.646 --> 02:29:54.473
this thing, that (thing). So he came to Me.
Normally, I never interfere.

02:29:54.674 --> 02:29:58.871
He came to Me and he said, “If You tell
him he might listen.”

02:29:59.072 --> 02:30:04.445
I said, “No, if I tell him he will never
listen. But I know how to do it.”

02:30:04.646 --> 02:30:09.152
So I told him that this gentleman came
to see Me.

02:30:09.353 --> 02:30:13.951
“Ha, so he’s come to the right person, now
are you going to trouble me about it?”

02:30:14.152 --> 02:30:18.905
I said, “No, no, no, not Me, but just think
why he came to Me.”

02:30:19.106 --> 02:30:23.031
He said, “Why?” “Because he thinks I’m more
generous than you are.”

02:30:23.232 --> 02:30:27.097
Immediately this competition.

02:30:32.532 --> 02:30:35.633
And that fellow got the job, he was
a great friend of his,

02:30:35.834 --> 02:30:38.799
even in London he was helping him a lot.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:44.951
So, when we think that we have to control
our husband,

02:30:45.152 --> 02:30:49.653
it’s better to do it in a very simple way.

02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:55.356
Only on fundamentals you can put down
your foot.

02:30:55.557 --> 02:30:59.037
Otherwise for small, small things,

02:30:59.238 --> 02:31:03.821
if you go on dominating your husband
I tell you, you will miss the point.

02:31:04.022 --> 02:31:10.454
You have married for stupidity or
for honeymoon?

02:31:11.899 --> 02:31:16.676
And in the West, especially in Italy, we
have had very bad experiences of women.

02:31:16.877 --> 02:31:21.618
English also, I must say. English girls
also have given Me lot of trouble.

02:31:21.819 --> 02:31:27.359
I mean, they are banned now, because
I can’t help it.

02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:33.195
One girl from Sri Lanka she was married
to somebody in…

02:31:33.396 --> 02:31:35.767
[Aside, maybe to a child: “Sit down,
sit down”] -

02:31:35.968 --> 02:31:40.543
she was married to somebody in USA.

02:31:40.744 --> 02:31:48.098
Imagine from that horrible Sri Lanka where
there’s everyday at least 30 murders,

02:31:48.299 --> 02:31:51.776
she got such a good chance to go to USA.

02:31:51.977 --> 02:31:59.042
Of course, USA’s also not a very great
place - but she started behaving

02:31:59.243 --> 02:32:05.574
as if she is a childish person and talking
to him in such a manner.

02:32:05.775 --> 02:32:11.214
He told Me “Mother, she is a sadist.
Whenever I telephone to her she talks to me

02:32:11.415 --> 02:32:16.800
in such a sarcastic manner and this
and that, that I’m surprised.”

02:32:17.001 --> 02:32:20.712
I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I can’t
believe it!”

02:32:20.913 --> 02:32:25.987
Then he told Me what she talked to him and
how she talked to him. I was amazed.

02:32:26.188 --> 02:32:29.754
I mean, no man would be happy to hear
all these things.

02:32:29.938 --> 02:32:36.472
But she thought she was very friendly, and
she was joking or something like that.

02:32:36.673 --> 02:32:40.612
This doesn’t work out in marriage.

02:32:41.545 --> 02:32:51.178
Man doesn’t want a wife to be on the horse
and beating with a whip.

02:32:51.379 --> 02:32:54.307
Why has he married?

02:32:54.508 --> 02:33:01.493
For the happiness, for the joy, for
the sweetness of a woman.

02:33:05.092 --> 02:33:07.484
It’s a very important thing I wanted
to talk

02:33:07.685 --> 02:33:12.653
because so many of women are thinking
that they are something great.

02:33:12.854 --> 02:33:16.104
Some of them have some money, some of them
have some jobs,

02:33:16.305 --> 02:33:21.216
but first job is to keep the society
very happy

02:33:21.417 --> 02:33:25.708
and to keep your husband happy –
is the first job.

02:33:26.190 --> 02:33:31.734
If a woman cannot keep the husband happy,
she is no good for us.

02:33:31.901 --> 02:33:36.972
She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is
a place, like a man

02:33:37.173 --> 02:33:40.317
who is working in the office, he has
to keep his boss pleased.

02:33:40.518 --> 02:33:44.451
If he doesn’t please his boss, he is
useless, he’s thrown out of.

02:33:44.652 --> 02:33:51.038
In the same way a woman has to think about
the husband, in a very kindly manner,

02:33:51.239 --> 02:33:56.662
because this is her job, this is why
she is marrying.

02:33:56.863 --> 02:34:01.158
Otherwise she should not marry, she can do
what she likes.

02:34:02.319 --> 02:34:07.667
It’s a difficult thing to convince anyone

02:34:07.844 --> 02:34:11.827
because, you see, men are right-sided,
they are hot-tempered.

02:34:12.028 --> 02:34:19.361
But I have told you just now how to capture
their anger.

02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:25.490
I’ve seen also in the films, you see
all romantic scenes going on –

02:34:25.691 --> 02:34:28.363
it never happens, there’s nobody is
like that,

02:34:28.564 --> 02:34:31.381
you see, it’s all absurd things you see,

02:34:31.582 --> 02:34:36.918
so you expect them to be Clark Gable
or somebody, it’s not so.

02:34:39.097 --> 02:34:45.086
You have to love, you have to take
your husband into your heart first.

02:34:45.287 --> 02:34:50.147
This is your duty, otherwise what else
are you doing?

02:34:54.358 --> 02:34:57.496
I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka -
and this boy has said,

02:34:57.697 --> 02:35:01.444
“Mother, you can kill me, but I will not
have that girl here,

02:35:01.645 --> 02:35:05.941
because she is not joy-giving.”
It’s a fact.

02:35:06.142 --> 02:35:11.375
So if your wife is like that supposing -
now I am telling men.

02:35:13.013 --> 02:35:16.406
The trick of the trade is, if your wife
is like that,

02:35:16.607 --> 02:35:20.088
try to understand why she does it.

02:35:20.289 --> 02:35:25.093
What is her problem, why is she
dominating you?

02:35:25.294 --> 02:35:30.881
Or you think she is dominating you. Most
of the times, most of the men who talk,

02:35:31.082 --> 02:35:35.994
“Oh, wives are like this, wives”… they are
very dominating.

02:35:36.195 --> 02:35:41.675
Why is she dominating you, what’s wrong
with you, that she is dominating?

02:35:41.876 --> 02:35:47.855
If you introspect, you’ll find that you
give very little time to her.

02:35:48.056 --> 02:35:52.308
Now, the other part is, there was one lady,
she wanted to have a divorce.

02:35:52.509 --> 02:35:56.467
I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work
all the time

02:35:56.668 --> 02:36:01.122
and he is not there and this and that.”

02:36:01.438 --> 02:36:04.779
But I said, “If you divorce, then you will
never be with him.

02:36:04.980 --> 02:36:10.385
So why do you want to have a divorce?
At least, at least he gives you some time,

02:36:10.586 --> 02:36:14.614
but if you divorce, then he’ll never be
with you, so why do you ask for divorce?”

02:36:14.815 --> 02:36:17.605
I can’t understand the logic.

02:36:17.806 --> 02:36:22.303
I mean women should not be brainless,
isn’t it - to say such a thing.

02:36:22.504 --> 02:36:28.015
If you want to divorce your husband
for this – it’s absurd.

02:36:28.681 --> 02:36:37.285
Now, for men it is important that they
should give some time,

02:36:37.486 --> 02:36:43.635
pay some attention and get some things
that they like.

02:36:45.242 --> 02:36:47.828
Now, I’ll give you again My own example.

02:36:48.029 --> 02:36:52.844
My husband never brought any flowers
for Me, you all bring flowers for Me,

02:36:53.045 --> 02:36:58.393
but he never brought any flowers for Me,
whether it was birthday or anything.

02:36:58.594 --> 02:37:03.138
Then I realized that this man has no sense
of flowers.

02:37:03.339 --> 02:37:08.603
He doesn’t know what is a rose or what is
any other flower.

02:37:08.804 --> 02:37:12.967
And he might bring something which is
horrible, you know.

02:37:13.168 --> 02:37:16.423
Maybe (a) cactus he might bring.

02:37:17.074 --> 02:37:23.077
It’s better he doesn’t bring anything,
because that would be insulting, isn’t it?

02:37:23.278 --> 02:37:26.908
And then one day he admitted, “I don’t know
anything about flowers,

02:37:27.109 --> 02:37:32.178
now will you tell me – except for roses,
I don’t know anything.”

02:37:32.363 --> 02:37:36.147
And you’ll be amazed, even roses, he misses
out (for that? Indistinct).

02:37:36.348 --> 02:37:38.955
So, with such an ignorance of things,

02:37:39.156 --> 02:37:44.071
if your husband doesn’t do, it shows
consideration.

02:37:45.591 --> 02:37:52.928
But men should try to know what a woman
likes, what she wants.

02:37:53.129 --> 02:37:57.709
Moreover, men have their own style
of thinking.

02:37:57.917 --> 02:38:06.145
Now, to give My own example again,
better (it) is.

02:38:06.408 --> 02:38:09.257
He buys always very expensive things.

02:38:09.458 --> 02:38:13.693
So, I’ve told him, “Don’t buy anything
for Me.” So, “You don’t like?”

02:38:13.894 --> 02:38:18.945
“No, no, I like it, but too much of these
too expensive things, why should you buy?”

02:38:19.146 --> 02:38:24.528
So, he is very fond of buying these kind
of sweaters from that Scotch House,

02:38:24.729 --> 02:38:29.671
very expensive they are, £250 each,
you know.

02:38:29.872 --> 02:38:34.976
I don’t know how many I have, how many
in black, how many, you see.

02:38:35.177 --> 02:38:40.940
I told him, “I’ll get it from Switzerland,
they are much cheaper there” and all that.

02:38:41.141 --> 02:38:45.291
Then another is he wants to buy a cashmere
coat for Me, always.

02:38:45.468 --> 02:38:49.110
I must be having at least 10 of them
hanging,

02:38:49.311 --> 02:38:53.033
but he likes to give that only – all right.

02:38:53.234 --> 02:38:57.889
So, I’m passing out them to My daughters,
granddaughters and all that.

02:38:58.090 --> 02:39:02.043
Then what to do now? You see, men –
he doesn’t mean anything bad,

02:39:02.244 --> 02:39:07.864
but because he doesn’t know, doesn’t know.

02:39:08.065 --> 02:39:12.897
First thing he did was to, when in India,
before going to the Puja,

02:39:13.098 --> 02:39:19.765
he went to buy a sari for Me. The one
of My nephews went with him.

02:39:19.966 --> 02:39:26.503
So he says, “Give me the most expensive
sari that you have.”

02:39:26.704 --> 02:39:29.637
So these people thought there’s somebody
has come now.

02:39:29.838 --> 02:39:34.507
The shopkeepers could understand this
gentleman doesn’t know anything of it.

02:39:34.708 --> 02:39:38.282
So they brought out a sari, said,
“This is the most expensive,

02:39:38.483 --> 02:39:42.392
the price is 45,000 rupees” – in those
days this was.

02:39:42.593 --> 02:39:45.644
“All right, all right, you give me. I have
a card, will you take the card?”

02:39:45.845 --> 02:39:49.216
“Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought
the sari for Me.

02:39:49.417 --> 02:39:55.198
It is so heavy, it is so heavy that it was
something…

02:39:55.399 --> 02:40:00.570
[Hindi aside]

02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:04.010
That… what do you call that, arm.. – you
wear… Some yogis: Armor.

02:40:04.224 --> 02:40:08.146
Shri Mataji: Eh? Some yogis: Armor.
Shri Mataji: Very heavy, you know.

02:40:08.347 --> 02:40:12.238
I said, “Now what?”
He said, “You must wear for the Puja."

02:40:12.439 --> 02:40:16.760
I was walking like a giant, you know.

02:40:22.989 --> 02:40:27.312
There’s a description of your Mother is
“Ati saumya Ati raudra” –

02:40:27.513 --> 02:40:31.548
She is extremely soft and extremely
terrible.

02:40:31.749 --> 02:40:34.825
But, I don’t know with that sari,
how I sat!

02:40:35.026 --> 02:40:39.257
I sat in one place glued down into that.

02:40:39.458 --> 02:40:44.717
Now to get up I didn’t know how to get up
with that weight on My body. You see?

02:40:44.918 --> 02:40:50.429
And then I brought it and put it properly
in a box and this and that.

02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:54.017
So he said, “When are you wearing that
next?” “Now,” I said, “Please,

02:40:54.218 --> 02:40:58.151
I’ve kept it nicely for one wedding,
I’ll wear sometime.”

02:40:58.352 --> 02:41:04.247
I promised him and kept it there, because
he doesn’t understand about saris.

02:41:05.001 --> 02:41:07.525
I know he doesn’t understand about saris.

02:41:07.690 --> 02:41:12.571
So if he doesn’t understand, whatever
he buys, I say “All right”.

02:41:12.772 --> 02:41:15.455
And he spends so much money on those
things, you know,

02:41:15.656 --> 02:41:21.984
45,000 rupees for such a sari...
[Hindi words]

02:41:22.208 --> 02:41:28.737
So he doesn’t understand what is real,
what is unreal, nothing – doesn’t matter.

02:41:28.938 --> 02:41:33.811
You have to just see his heart, how he
is giving you,

02:41:34.012 --> 02:41:37.251
with what love he is giving you. He doesn’t
understand.

02:41:37.452 --> 02:41:40.549
So what can you do, poor man, you know.

02:41:40.749 --> 02:41:46.241
I always buy suit lengths for him or suits
for him, I always – Myself.

02:41:46.442 --> 02:41:49.387
Once he said, “All right, I’m going to buy
this time.” I said, “Better buy.”

02:41:49.588 --> 02:41:53.075
He bought such a horrible one and he went
to the office

02:41:53.276 --> 02:41:58.232
and everybody said, “Sir, this is not
your taste.”

02:42:01.228 --> 02:42:03.420
So he threw it away, he said, “I will never
buy now,

02:42:03.621 --> 02:42:06.365
can you, better go and buy for myself.”

02:42:06.566 --> 02:42:11.681
See, it’s - but the trouble is if women
take interest and know

02:42:11.882 --> 02:42:14.581
what sort of color he will like and this
and that.

02:42:14.782 --> 02:42:20.733
And also public opinion is very important
for men, for example what the public says.

02:42:20.934 --> 02:42:25.619
Like once I painted My drawing room
with a very nice color,

02:42:25.820 --> 02:42:31.457
pink and black film mixed – very nice.
Because it’s a sign of warmth.

02:42:31.643 --> 02:42:33.255
He said, “What is this color you have
put it?

02:42:33.456 --> 02:42:36.545
You should have done this and that”,
he started shouting.

02:42:36.746 --> 02:42:40.516
I said, “All right, tomorrow we are having
a party, after that I’ll change it.”

02:42:40.717 --> 02:42:44.923
Next day the people came in, they said,
“Oh, what a color, what a color,

02:42:45.124 --> 02:42:49.701
how have you made this color, how did…?”
He started looking at Me.

02:42:49.902 --> 02:42:54.832
I said, “Should I remove it?”
“No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.”

02:42:56.986 --> 02:43:01.261
Men care for public opinion very much
and you should see

02:43:01.446 --> 02:43:07.394
that you create a good public opinion
in his presence,

02:43:07.595 --> 02:43:11.530
so that he’ll appreciate you. All these
are tricks, you see?

02:43:11.731 --> 02:43:17.718
I tell you, men are very simple, but you
have to understand them.

02:43:17.919 --> 02:43:20.304
Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter.

02:43:20.505 --> 02:43:25.185
Actually, if they are angry with somebody
else, they will come and put it on you.

02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:29.550
It’s better, because if they do anything
to others, they’ll beat them.

02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:32.655
You are not going to beat (them).

02:43:33.733 --> 02:43:38.972
If you understand few things about men,
it can work out.

02:43:39.173 --> 02:43:42.100
Of course, some are very miserable
husbands, I know,

02:43:42.301 --> 02:43:46.074
and some miserable wives – for them we have
divorce allowed

02:43:46.275 --> 02:43:50.084
in our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce
for them.

02:43:50.285 --> 02:43:53.943
So that is the thing I wanted to tell you,

02:43:54.144 --> 02:43:58.867
that you should make a very good housewife,
a very good Gruha Lakshmi.

02:43:59.068 --> 02:44:06.085
Now, why I am telling you this, that I am
suffering from Gruha Lakshmi’s chakra,

02:44:06.286 --> 02:44:10.760
and all the doctors have told Me it is
because in the collective

02:44:10.968 --> 02:44:19.210
Gruha Lakshmis are not all right, because
they are not good housewives.

02:44:19.411 --> 02:44:24.791
Like I’ll tell you now we have Swiss women.
They are very good, agreed about that,

02:44:24.992 --> 02:44:31.414
but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are
mad after cleanliness, women, women.

02:44:31.621 --> 02:44:35.104
You can’t talk to them even for five
minutes. If you are sitting there

02:44:35.305 --> 02:44:37.871
they are picking up this, picking up that,
picking up that, picking all the…,

02:44:38.072 --> 02:44:43.145
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. It’s very
difficult, Swiss women.

02:44:43.346 --> 02:44:45.889
Now, I was… - Eritrea,

02:44:46.090 --> 02:44:51.294
Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea
are known to be Swiss women.

02:44:51.495 --> 02:44:58.105
So, doesn’t matter if the house is little
untidy, if there’s something fallen off.

02:44:58.306 --> 02:45:01.127
In India no woman will do that.

02:45:01.328 --> 02:45:05.687
Now, the guests are sitting and she’s
with the Hoover.

02:45:11.337 --> 02:45:17.315
Like another thing is, like anything
breaks, say,

02:45:17.516 --> 02:45:20.748
supposing the thermometer breaks –
in India they’ll say, “Very good,

02:45:20.949 --> 02:45:25.138
now there will be no temperature,
thermometer’s broken.”

02:45:25.339 --> 02:45:28.237
But I’ve seen in the West, it’s very
surprising,

02:45:28.438 --> 02:45:34.723
supposing some coffee spills, I’m a guest,
immediately they’ll bring the Hoover,

02:45:34.924 --> 02:45:38.315
bring something to clean it –
in the presence of the person.

02:45:38.516 --> 02:45:41.336
Now, if a glass breaks, finished.

02:45:41.537 --> 02:45:45.397
It’s not important. This is a very subtle
type of materialism, I think,

02:45:45.598 --> 02:45:49.408
that the person is sitting there, who is
a guest,

02:45:49.609 --> 02:45:56.754
and why are you trying to do all these
things in her presence or in his presence?

02:45:56.955 --> 02:46:01.008
But this Western women never understand.

02:46:01.209 --> 02:46:07.223
Another thing is, now, you go to an Indian
house. Their color scheme is different.

02:46:07.423 --> 02:46:12.874
If you go to south Indians theirs is
different. Everybody has their own taste.

02:46:13.075 --> 02:46:16.586
As soon as they will enter –
Western women –

02:46:16.787 --> 02:46:20.898
“What a color scheme! What a thing you
have bought! Oh my God, this is horrible.”

02:46:21.099 --> 02:46:25.753
Immediately they will criticize
on the face.

02:46:25.954 --> 02:46:31.154
So another point is that you must always
consider the feelings of others.

02:46:31.355 --> 02:46:39.735
Woman is there to give proper understanding
of feelings of others, what they think.

02:46:39.936 --> 02:46:47.369
Or they go to an Indian house which
will be smelling of their food, “Huh”.

02:46:47.570 --> 02:46:50.783
They’ll eat the same food, they’ll enjoy
the food,

02:46:50.984 --> 02:46:56.791
but they’ll try to show, to show that it is
something lower.

02:46:56.992 --> 02:46:59.645
This is very Western, I must say.

02:46:59.846 --> 02:47:06.685
If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately
they’ll pass a remark.

02:47:06.963 --> 02:47:12.582
Very Western idea. You will not find
good Indians doing that,

02:47:12.783 --> 02:47:16.554
I don’t know about the modern Indians
what sort of things they are.

02:47:16.755 --> 02:47:20.834
But immediately they’ll say things which
will hurt.

02:47:21.035 --> 02:47:24.567
This is not the way a woman should look.

02:47:24.768 --> 02:47:29.478
On the contrary, always praise -
what’s the harm?

02:47:29.679 --> 02:47:35.905
By praising something you are not losing
your business.

02:47:36.106 --> 02:47:43.619
By saying, “What a nice thing, what a nice
sari, what nice clothes” – what’s the harm?

02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:48.449
You’ll enjoy your sweetness, you know?
Really enjoy your sweetness.

02:47:48.650 --> 02:47:52.770
It’s not telling lies, not to be that
honest also necessary.

02:47:52.971 --> 02:47:56.015
Because you don’t like something you must
say, “I don’t like it.”

02:47:56.216 --> 02:48:06.419
This word has to go from Sahaja Yoga.
“I like this and I don’t like that."

02:48:06.620 --> 02:48:14.225
If I, say, saying that, how many will
remain in Sahaja Yoga?

02:48:18.628 --> 02:48:23.831
So it’s very important to drop this
“I like it, I don’t like it.”

02:48:24.016 --> 02:48:26.443
Who are you to like or not like?

02:48:26.644 --> 02:48:31.581
What about your Spirit? What about
your heart?

02:48:31.782 --> 02:48:37.972
So again the same thing comes to,
that women have to have a heart,

02:48:38.181 --> 02:48:45.976
very large heart, beautiful heart.
And your Guru is a Mother,

02:48:46.177 --> 02:48:50.762
so you have to be wonderful mothers
and wonderful wives

02:48:50.963 --> 02:48:55.472
and should have very, very large hearts.

02:48:59.072 --> 02:49:07.683
So that all this selfishness, even this
bank will collapse if you do that.

02:49:07.884 --> 02:49:11.088
It is existing because we have small
hearts.

02:49:11.289 --> 02:49:17.103
If you have large hearts this will
collapse – isn’t it?

02:49:19.620 --> 02:49:24.801
I have said it, especially because I’ve had
many complaints about the women

02:49:25.002 --> 02:49:32.015
who are married here, some Indian women
also. That’s why I’m telling you.

02:49:32.216 --> 02:49:37.072
Best reports are about Russian women
I must say,

02:49:37.273 --> 02:49:40.379
very, very good reports about them.

02:49:40.580 --> 02:49:45.483
They are very satisfied souls, they want
very little, they are not greedy.

02:49:45.684 --> 02:49:48.843
It’s surprising, communism has done
so much good to them.

02:49:49.044 --> 02:49:55.015
It’s not communism, but the extremities
of communism has thrown them

02:49:55.216 --> 02:50:02.814
into that area where they don’t have any
sense of possession, they don’t have.

02:50:03.015 --> 02:50:05.866
Their government said, “All right, you can
have your flats and look after them.”

02:50:06.067 --> 02:50:09.632
Said, “We don’t want to have, you have it.”

02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:12.915
Government servants were told that
“you can have your cars”.

02:50:13.116 --> 02:50:16.802
Said, “No, no, we don’t want, you’d
better have.”

02:50:17.003 --> 02:50:21.794
Because just to own the car is such
a headache – they know.

02:50:21.995 --> 02:50:25.742
Let the government have the headache.
They are not, you know,

02:50:25.943 --> 02:50:30.212
sort of people who are even conscious
of possessiveness.

02:50:30.413 --> 02:50:33.643
Of course, now, they had some funny people.

02:50:33.844 --> 02:50:38.244
I’m forgetting his name, who was finance
minister you had,

02:50:38.476 --> 02:50:44.757
and he was in Geneva, where he learned
all the tricks of the trade

02:50:44.927 --> 02:50:48.071
and he brought forth lots of reforms,
so-called.

02:50:48.272 --> 02:50:53.777
So now Leningrad and Moscow have become
very expensive places –

02:50:53.978 --> 02:50:56.498
thanks to Swiss influence.

02:50:56.699 --> 02:51:01.673
So this has happened there also, but still
the people are very good,

02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:07.357
and the ladies who come from there, even
Romanian girls are very much respected,

02:51:07.558 --> 02:51:12.140
now everybody wants Romanian or Russians,

02:51:17.378 --> 02:51:21.393
or from Kiev. But this time they didn’t
come,

02:51:21.594 --> 02:51:26.919
we are sorry they are not here, I’m missing
them all.

02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:34.021
Lastly, I have to tell you that there’s
a very good book, Arun Apte has written.

02:51:35.337 --> 02:51:38.499
This is the book. You all should buy it.

02:51:38.700 --> 02:51:42.114
I don’t know, what is the price you have
put it?

02:51:42.315 --> 02:51:45.633
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi about
the book and its price]

02:52:08.053 --> 02:52:11.319
Alright. So, those who want to have
this book should apply.

02:52:11.520 --> 02:52:15.100
There are only five, are here,
very good book.

02:52:15.301 --> 02:52:20.150
So, you will understand about Indian music.

02:52:20.351 --> 02:52:26.549
It is said that this music has come
from Omkara.

02:52:26.983 --> 02:52:33.864
And it is very sort of – sensible music.

02:52:34.065 --> 02:52:40.316
Now, I think all those musicians who sang
before Me,

02:52:40.517 --> 02:52:45.253
who were singing western song, was alright.

02:52:45.454 --> 02:52:50.588
But what is missing in that: melody.
It’s not melodious.

02:52:50.789 --> 02:52:54.031
You see, is like little bit you sing,
then you sing this,

02:52:54.232 --> 02:52:57.829
then you shout, then you bring it down,
then do like this.

02:52:58.030 --> 02:53:02.098
And they think that they have to sing
through their heart.

02:53:02.299 --> 02:53:05.746
They have to express the feeling
of their heart.

02:53:05.947 --> 02:53:10.187
Now, supposing somebody is dejected,
so he sings the song of dejection.

02:53:10.388 --> 02:53:14.497
Then another one who is talking about love,
he starts to sing a song.

02:53:14.674 --> 02:53:20.195
He may not be, but artificially they want
to produce that effect.

02:53:20.396 --> 02:53:28.258
There is no need; to sing in parts,
like one word, then one word,

02:53:28.459 --> 02:53:32.095
there’s no melody in it, there’s no flow
in it.

02:53:32.296 --> 02:53:38.695
And, while, Russian songs, though they
were folk songs, were very melodious.

02:53:38.896 --> 02:53:43.065
But don’t worry, Americans are invading
that part also.

02:53:43.266 --> 02:53:45.824
They are having all this horrible music
there.

02:53:46.025 --> 02:53:51.445
Now, the music means, it should please you.
It should give you more entertainment;

02:53:51.646 --> 02:53:55.831
not to make you unhappy, not to make
you sad.

02:53:56.012 --> 02:54:03.154
If you have all these feelings within you,
then you should try to say like this:

02:54:03.322 --> 02:54:07.661
“Yes, there is problem, but I’ll get
over it.”

02:54:07.862 --> 02:54:11.761
Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
to show the victory;

02:54:11.962 --> 02:54:14.592
the victorious nature of yours,
in your music.

02:54:14.793 --> 02:54:19.750
I’m not talking about others; they go on
crying, weeping and singing.

02:54:19.950 --> 02:54:24.731
But there is no melody first of all, it is
just part, part, part, part.

02:54:24.956 --> 02:54:28.391
Even the orchestra, which I was surprised:
it all goes like this

02:54:28.592 --> 02:54:33.086
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”, then it goes
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”.

02:54:33.287 --> 02:54:42.963
But Indian orchestra, you will see,
is melodious. It flows like a river.

02:54:43.164 --> 02:54:49.608
So, this difference is very bad. So, I would
request all the musicians who are singing,

02:54:49.809 --> 02:55:00.637
the singing doesn’t mean that you use words
which nobody can understand.

02:55:00.838 --> 02:55:05.384
Words must be clear-cut and the melody
must be there.

02:55:05.585 --> 02:55:11.571
Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody
but words are not important.

02:55:11.771 --> 02:55:13.712
So, you enjoy the tune and everything,

02:55:13.913 --> 02:55:17.822
whether you know the language or not,
doesn’t matter.

02:55:18.023 --> 02:55:22.196
So, when you can combine melody
with western music,

02:55:22.397 --> 02:55:25.841
you will see how different it will be.

02:55:27.978 --> 02:55:31.562
And this book will teach you. This is
a very good book,

02:55:31.763 --> 02:55:34.407
which you should have, and which you should
understand

02:55:34.608 --> 02:55:43.843
that how the music can cure you,
music can give you joy,

02:55:44.044 --> 02:55:50.341
what is the basic, the essence of music.
And then you can flower it out.

02:55:50.542 --> 02:55:55.779
I am sure, if Indian musicians take
to western music,

02:55:55.940 --> 02:56:01.983
will be much better than to western music
as it is.

02:56:03.432 --> 02:56:07.061
I can’t understand, these people are
so famous

02:56:07.262 --> 02:56:11.244
and people think they are very well-earning
and all that.

02:56:11.445 --> 02:56:16.839
In America, anybody can earn like that,
but to make it a proper music,

02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:19.788
I think you must have the basis
of Indian music.

02:56:19.989 --> 02:56:23.681
Then you can expand it as you like.

02:56:23.882 --> 02:56:30.006
Now, please try to buy this book,
to understand Indian music.

02:56:30.207 --> 02:56:34.471
There’s no price yet given, but it won’t be
much more than normal,

02:56:34.672 --> 02:56:40.950
so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they
might bring more. Eh? Ganapatipule.

02:56:41.238 --> 02:56:47.802
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi to know
when the book will be available]

02:56:48.334 --> 02:56:50.673
Accha.

02:56:50.874 --> 02:56:55.641
I will try to get more of these, but this
you must really read,

02:56:55.842 --> 02:57:02.215
because you will know what is the essence
of music, alright?

02:57:02.416 --> 02:57:12.137
And, lastly, today is the 4th day
of Navaratri

02:57:12.564 --> 02:57:20.700
and they have given Me - some of them
are names which are really horrid,

02:57:24.738 --> 02:57:29.641
but they must be people who have suffered
so much

02:57:29.842 --> 02:57:36.931
and they asked Mother to kill those
horrible rakshasas.

02:57:37.132 --> 02:57:45.381
Now in a way, it all will kill in its
natural course, I know that.

02:57:45.582 --> 02:57:52.318
If you people take to sense, because you
are the ones who can do it.

02:57:52.519 --> 02:58:00.839
If you do not try to acquire things which
you don’t want, unnecessary things.

02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:09.106
If you try to reduce all these things
and take to something natural

02:58:09.307 --> 02:58:14.214
and love the Mother Earth, I am sure
it will work out.

02:58:14.389 --> 02:58:18.505
The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

02:58:18.706 --> 02:58:25.330
You know this earthquake. Now nobody
is going in the church.

02:58:25.531 --> 02:58:30.887
But I didn’t do anything. It’s the Mother
Earth.

02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:38.059
Now nobody goes in the church. What -
I didn’t do anything, I would not.

02:58:38.260 --> 02:58:45.836
I was sorry for the art-pieces gone, but
see now how the nature is working out.

02:58:46.037 --> 02:58:52.542
Now Islamic people, these Islamic people
from Indonesia onward,

02:58:52.743 --> 02:58:58.532
all these people are suffering from
the smoke – I didn’t do that.

02:58:58.733 --> 02:59:02.039
Because when you try to do something wrong

02:59:02.240 --> 02:59:06.336
it comes back to you. Action has
a reaction.

02:59:09.018 --> 02:59:13.305
So, your faces should be Sahaj. You should
be Sahaj.

02:59:13.506 --> 02:59:19.390
You shouldn’t look like strained people.
I can’t understand.

02:59:19.591 --> 02:59:25.455
You are Sahaj and be in that Sahaj mood.
I’m sorry I’ve taken so much time,

02:59:25.656 --> 02:59:29.312
but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak
all these things to you.

02:59:29.513 --> 02:59:34.374
And you should try to think about it,
that “Our Mother loves me,

02:59:34.575 --> 02:59:38.759
She wants us to have a good family, She
wants us to look after our children.”

02:59:38.960 --> 02:59:43.898
So, I have advised all the men, as well
as the women.

02:59:44.099 --> 02:59:47.539
It’s better to be hen-pecked, there’s
no harm.

02:59:47.740 --> 02:59:51.227
But hen-pecked doesn’t mean they are
hen-pecked.

02:59:51.428 --> 02:59:56.993
See, they are – just to please your wife,
what’s the harm?

02:59:58.767 --> 03:00:04.841
But that doesn’t mean if she dominates you.
That’s not the thing.

03:00:05.042 --> 03:00:09.386
Like, “Come to my father’s house, I must
go to my mother’s house”.

03:00:09.586 --> 03:00:13.293
All these kind of things you should not
permit.

03:00:13.494 --> 03:00:18.577
But women should also understand,
her family is more important

03:00:18.778 --> 03:00:23.361
than father, mother, even Mataji.

03:00:24.662 --> 03:00:29.591
Because I’ll be only happy to see a happy
family.

03:00:30.531 --> 03:00:32.804
So, thank you very much.
