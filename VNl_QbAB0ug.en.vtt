00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(Sahaja Yogi talks in German)

00:49:42.999 --> 00:49:45.918
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:49:51.083 --> 00:49:58.417
It is important for all of us to know that we do not know absolute truth.

00:50:05.209 --> 00:50:11.999
One person says something, another person says something, and we don't know where to look.

00:50:19.334 --> 00:50:22.918
We don't know whom to believe and whom to understand.

00:50:28.918 --> 00:50:33.375
Also, whatever I'm telling you, you need not take Me for granted.

00:50:40.292 --> 00:50:44.083
But keep your minds open, as scientists.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:57.918
In case what I say is proved, then you have to accept it as law, not because I say this is so, this is so.

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:19.250
Now, you have heard about the chakras that are within us and the centers that govern us.

00:51:26.042 --> 00:51:29.792
Now, this knowledge is the knowledge of the roots.

00:51:34.417 --> 00:51:38.292
This instrument has come out of the knowledge of the tree.

00:51:45.959 --> 00:51:50.667
But there is another instrument within us about which you have already heard.

00:51:55.959 --> 00:52:04.250
Then one may ask: If there is such an instrument within us, why do we commit mistakes, why do we have collective mistakes also?

00:52:11.959 --> 00:52:17.375
And why it is that we all do not have understand absolute truth?

00:52:22.292 --> 00:52:26.584
And why there are so many different ideas and theories in this world?

00:52:31.209 --> 00:52:34.501
And why do we have this instrument within all of us?

00:52:40.626 --> 00:52:46.167
But this instrument, which is within us, is not connected to the mains.

00:52:51.999 --> 00:52:54.125
That's why it is not working out.

00:52:56.999 --> 00:52:59.292
It has to be connected to the mains.

00:53:02.834 --> 00:53:12.626
And to connect it to the mains is possible today, may not have been few years back.

00:53:21.334 --> 00:53:25.083
So we have to get this instrument working all right.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:50.125
As you can see on both the sides, we have left and right side of energy flowing, which gives rise to imbalances within ourselves.

00:53:56.501 --> 00:54:03.667
These two energies of left and right side give rise to two sympathetic nervous systems: of left side and right side.

00:54:12.709 --> 00:54:19.792
But the central energy, which is looking after our balance, is the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:54:27.918 --> 00:54:35.667
For example, if you run fast, you can increase… you… you can increase the beat of you heart.

00:54:42.751 --> 00:54:46.417
But you cannot reduce and bring it to normal.

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:59.751
So the first one, when we increase it, the sympathetic works; and second one, when it decreases automatically, is the parasympathetic.

00:55:10.125 --> 00:55:13.042
Now, this parasympathetic is beyond our control.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.667
Now, due to these imbalances within ourselves, we develop so many problems.

00:55:31.167 --> 00:55:34.000
The first problem we have is of physical being.

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:44.209
When there is imbalance within us, [a center gets] blocked.

00:55:50.959 --> 00:56:01.959
Now, how the cancer is caused is when… this is the center in the… in here, in the centre, then it's the left side and the right side sympathetic working.

00:56:10.999 --> 00:56:17.999
And who are in contact with the central nervous system, with the main brain.

00:56:23.834 --> 00:56:33.250
But when you start going too much to the right or to the left, these become smaller; [UNCLEAR] become smaller and smaller, till they break.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.417
As a result of that, you become on your own on your left side or on your right side.

00:56:56.083 --> 00:57:03.209
In the sense that your cells become arbitrary, start growing more than normal, so we call them malignant.

00:57:07.709 --> 00:57:08.999
YOGINI: Excuse me, Mother?

00:57:09.751 --> 00:57:11.125
SHRI MATAJI: What we call it — malignant.

00:57:12.459 --> 00:57:15.125
They… they start becoming bigger and bigger.

00:57:15.125 --> 00:57:19.709
When one cell starts overpowering other cells, they start becoming bigger and bigger.

00:57:20.083 --> 00:57:23.667
One part. Say, nose becomes bigger, eyes become bigger…

00:57:33.375 --> 00:57:35.501
And thus we say cancer is caused.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.751
There are so many physical troubles which are cause by imbalances.

00:57:49.209 --> 00:57:54.999
Even AIDS, AIDS and many other diseases are caused by this imbalance within us.

00:58:01.542 --> 00:58:02.959
Now, there is a solution.

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:25.459
And the solution has been worked out now in Delhi University, people have… two doctors have passed PhD in their medical courses, which they call as [MD], with the subject as Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:35.959 --> 00:58:40.334
Now, they have worked on psychosomatic and as well as physical side.

00:58:47.042 --> 00:58:54.000
So, actually, what happens is that within ourselves lies the power to solve the problem.

00:59:02.792 --> 00:59:23.250
And when this power rises within us and passes through all the centres, opens this fontanelle bone area and becomes one with the all-pervading Power, the subtle Power, all of them get nourished and in balance.

00:59:43.083 --> 00:59:48.667
This power lies within all of us in the sacred bone called as sacrum.

00:59:56.667 --> 01:00:01.167
Now, the Greeks knew about it because they called it sacrum, means sacred.

01:00:07.751 --> 01:00:14.584
When this power rises, she passes through six centres within ourselves,

01:00:22.876 --> 01:00:26.542
who represent our physical, mental, emotional, spiritual beings.

01:00:32.876 --> 01:00:39.250
And she corrects, and she nourishes, and she balances all these centres.

01:00:45.626 --> 01:01:04.000
But that's not the only side — is the physical, or the emotional, or the spiritual, or the mental side — but the greater than that is that you become collectively conscious on your nervous system.

01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:20.626
That means you become empowered.

01:01:22.584 --> 01:01:31.709
You get the power to feel the centres of other people and your own centres.

01:01:38.667 --> 01:01:45.584
You can easily discern and find out what's wrong with other people and what's wrong with yourself.

01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:59.417
It may be physical, it may be emotional, it could be mental, or could be spiritual.

01:02:06.542 --> 01:02:11.417
I call it the blossom time, for modern times.

01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:20.626
As if you all are ready to achieve that stage,

01:02:27.083 --> 01:02:30.834
the state of Self-realization, of your second birth.

01:02:36.042 --> 01:02:43.999
This have been described in all the religions, in all the… big books, or prophets, or saints.

01:02:53.042 --> 01:02:55.417
After all, they would not be telling us lies.

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:01.125
We have to be born again.

01:03:03.334 --> 01:03:09.834
But it's not like certifying yourself "I am born again" and doing all kinds of things which are absolutely destructive.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:24.751
But when this Kundalini rises — this power within you — you become absolutely a peaceful person within.

01:03:33.584 --> 01:03:40.250
I've known many people who form peace foundations, peace this, peace that — and they have no peace within.

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:55.417
There are [UNCLEAR] [who won] Peace Nobel Prize, are such hot-tempered that you have to [UNCLEAR] [at] them with a barge pole.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:56.751
YOGINI: Excuse me?

01:03:56.751 --> 01:04:01.792
SHRI MATAJI: With a barge pole. You see, barge is a ship, a little ship, you see, you have to push it with a barge pole.

01:04:13.542 --> 01:04:17.918
You've got [UNCLEAR] at them, they are supposed to be Nobel Prize winners of peace.

01:04:25.918 --> 01:04:29.834
So all these artificial foundations are not going to help us.

01:04:35.083 --> 01:04:39.584
We have within ourselves this… innately placed, this power.

01:04:44.667 --> 01:04:50.334
And that power is… has been there all through your lives.

01:04:55.999 --> 01:05:00.042
You do not have to do anything about it.

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:06.209
It is a spontaneous happening.

01:05:09.125 --> 01:05:11.125
Because it's a living process.

01:05:14.209 --> 01:05:17.459
It is a living process, like a seed can sprout.

01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:30.542
And once it sprouts… when you get your realization, you are amazed at your own capacities.

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:42.125
You become dynamic but absolutely relaxed.

01:05:46.083 --> 01:05:47.459
There are no tensions.

01:05:50.375 --> 01:05:51.999
There are no pressures.

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:58.626
And you are amazed at yourself how many things you are capable of.

01:06:04.417 --> 01:06:07.334
Then you realize that the knowledge you've had was so limited

01:06:12.959 --> 01:06:14.709
and was a relative knowledge.

01:06:17.209 --> 01:06:18.501
It was not absolute.

01:06:20.792 --> 01:06:31.292
So, actually, what happens that when you are born again, your spirit starts manifesting in your attention.

01:06:43.501 --> 01:06:48.250
In the light of the spirit you just see the real truth, the absolute truth.

01:06:54.876 --> 01:07:01.667
But this cannot be, this absolute truth cannot be forced on you in any way.

01:07:06.751 --> 01:07:13.792
This happening cannot take place if somebody tries to force you or tries to discipline you.

01:07:19.999 --> 01:07:21.876
Also you can't pay for it.

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:28.584
Like the Mother Earth, Kundalini doesn't understand money.

01:07:34.501 --> 01:07:42.042
It's an actualization, is a genuine thing, and the innate thing within you.

01:07:50.083 --> 01:07:55.792
Even if you say, "Mother, give me my realization," I may not be able to do it.

01:07:56.083 --> 01:07:59.167
May be, may not be, there's no guarantee.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:16.542
You cannot become a member of a club of realized souls or cannot form a kind of an organization out of it.

01:08:24.626 --> 01:08:34.250
It is a happening within you, which you have to certify that you have felt the all-pervading Power on your fingertips.

01:08:43.959 --> 01:08:49.709
If you are honest and genuine in your seeking, I am sure you all should have it.

01:08:55.751 --> 01:08:58.918
As it is, we have two problems within us.

01:09:02.999 --> 01:09:04.417
Only two problems.

01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:10.125
One is that we have got certain conditionings.

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:17.584
All kinds of conditionings we have got.

01:09:20.959 --> 01:09:26.834
Like, I can say I'm an Indian, and you are German, and you are English, and you are this, and you are that.

01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:40.667
Or I could say that I belong to this community, and that community, and that community.

01:09:46.125 --> 01:09:49.709
Or I may say I have read this book, and that book, and that book.

01:09:53.834 --> 01:09:55.918
All this is conditioning within us.

01:09:59.125 --> 01:10:01.209
You were born as a human being.

01:10:04.918 --> 01:10:11.250
And you have every right to get this union with the Divine, which we call as yoga.

01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:22.959
This is the real yoga.

01:10:26.417 --> 01:10:30.876
Because with that nourishment you just start getting transformed.

01:10:38.584 --> 01:10:40.459
You start seeing what's wrong with you.

01:10:44.999 --> 01:10:47.292
And you start seeing what's wrong with others.

01:10:50.834 --> 01:10:57.417
You develop a divine discretion by which you can see that this is wrong and this is right.

01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:15.459
It's not the mental analysis, but if you have realization, on your fingertips you can feel it what's the truth is.

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:29.375
In these modern times, I would say your computer starts working.

01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:36.918
It's already programmed.

01:11:39.626 --> 01:11:40.751
It's all built-in.

01:11:43.125 --> 01:11:45.417
Only thing, it has to be connected to the mains.

01:11:47.459 --> 01:11:48.959
And then it starts working.

01:11:51.459 --> 01:11:56.250
And the programming is done with the absolute knowledge.

01:12:01.999 --> 01:12:03.667
So you make no mistakes.

01:12:08.501 --> 01:12:13.792
These are the minimum of minimum things that have to happen to human beings.

01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:27.999
If we have to save this world from further calamities, we have to get human beings transformed.

01:12:38.918 --> 01:12:49.459
We are so much worried of ecological imbalances — but not about human imbalances.

01:12:53.584 --> 01:12:59.626
And the second imbalance that we have is what we call as ego.

01:13:05.125 --> 01:13:11.167
That we think we have done this work, we have done that work… Is a feeling that we are very great.

01:13:19.918 --> 01:13:23.834
Now, for example, now we have very beautiful stage here.

01:13:24.334 --> 01:13:28.751
Out of the tree that falls dead, we have created another dead thing.

01:13:40.667 --> 01:13:43.999
Something from the dead do another dead.

01:13:48.626 --> 01:13:51.751
Have you ever done anything that is living?

01:13:56.918 --> 01:14:00.417
You can't even make an atom of your own.

01:14:04.459 --> 01:14:06.375
You cannot create anything.

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:16.334
Whatever is created, you may try to change it, but you cannot create any element on your own.

01:14:25.999 --> 01:14:39.292
I'll tell you a joke, that sometimes some village people from India were asked to go by plane and were told not to carry too much luggage, because it won't be all right

01:14:50.792 --> 01:14:59.042
and the plane will feel the overloading, so it is better to take little things, few things with you.

01:15:06.459 --> 01:15:11.834
So these villagers sat in the plane and put all their luggage on their heads.

01:15:18.959 --> 01:15:20.626
They did it in their ignorance.

01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:26.542
So people asked them, "What are you doing?"

01:15:27.375 --> 01:15:30.417
They said, "We are trying to reduce the weight of the aeroplane."

01:15:37.999 --> 01:15:45.209
In the same way, we human beings feel that we are trying to reduce [the work] of the Creator.

01:15:53.501 --> 01:16:03.751
So this… this Mr. Ego from one side, and from the other side the conditioning creating superego; both of them meet and make a very hard nut here.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.626
And you become like a shell of a… of an egg, I should say.

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:35.042
Now, in India, a realized soul is called as dvija, and… as well as the bird is called, called as dvija.

01:16:35.501 --> 01:16:37.417
Dvi-ja — means twice-born.

01:16:48.292 --> 01:16:55.584
Like the… like the bird is first born as an egg and then it becomes a bird.

01:17:03.459 --> 01:17:20.042
In the same way, a human being has to become a bird, in the sense he has to achieve his ultimate status, his ultimate destination.

01:17:29.667 --> 01:17:33.292
This is the epitome of evolution.

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:44.999
At human level, we live relatively, but at this state we live in the absolute truth.

01:17:55.834 --> 01:18:04.999
When you achieve that state, then there is no question of understanding how we are related to each other.

01:18:13.334 --> 01:18:24.667
And the enjoyment that we get before realization looks like something artificial injections.

01:18:37.375 --> 01:18:44.792
Actually, in modern times, people are seeking joy, and when they don't get it, they want to have some sort of a sensation all the time.

01:18:54.792 --> 01:18:58.417
Whatever they are doing is in the search of joy.

01:19:03.167 --> 01:19:10.834
But the joy is within yourself, in your heart, resides as the embodiment of spirit.

01:19:19.584 --> 01:19:25.375
Joy is not double-faced like a coin, happiness and unhappiness. Joy is absolute.

01:19:33.334 --> 01:19:39.959
So one has to achieve that state, but for that you don't have to put in any efforts.

01:19:47.417 --> 01:19:52.667
It is like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten another candle very easily.

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:04.459
In the same way, those who get realization can give realizations to others,

01:20:11.542 --> 01:20:18.375
transforming them into beautiful, wonderful universal human beings.

01:20:25.167 --> 01:20:32.959
There is complete freedom because no temptation can touch you.

01:20:39.292 --> 01:20:40.918
No one can deceive you.

01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:49.459
You understand each and every person inside out.

01:20:54.876 --> 01:21:01.667
In that state, you enjoy yourself and enjoy others who are like you.

01:21:08.667 --> 01:21:17.334
Unfortunately, in Germany, somehow, I don't know why, but Sahaja Yoga has not taken its roots.

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:35.542
There are fifty another countries who have got people who have taken Sahaja Yoga very easily.

01:21:42.918 --> 01:21:52.542
They were all attacked by fake gurus, by… man-made religions — all kinds of things.

01:21:53.083 --> 01:21:58.125
But they could see with their pure intelligence that this is the truth.

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:18.042
So I have to request you to have a look at it as a scientist.

01:22:18.999 --> 01:22:29.167
Keep your minds open, and if you receive your realization, then you will realize that what I'm saying is the absolute truth.

01:22:42.584 --> 01:22:43.876
May God bless you all!

01:23:04.083 --> 01:23:09.375
For about fifteen minutes, you can ask Me some questions.

01:23:16.334 --> 01:23:21.375
But I have not come here to take anything from you.

01:23:27.834 --> 01:23:33.167
I have just come here to give you what you have, your own, give.

01:23:39.834 --> 01:23:43.417
So there is no need to be offensive with Me for nothing at all.

01:23:49.292 --> 01:23:54.584
It's just what you have. I have come here to hand over your keys to you, for example.

01:24:01.459 --> 01:24:07.751
So, please ask Me questions, no doubt, but don't be unnecessarily aggressive.

01:24:15.334 --> 01:24:19.959
Because we should not waste the time so much on unnecessarily quarreling.

01:24:25.792 --> 01:24:28.250
Actually, I don't know how to quarrel, so it's a waste.

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:36.626
All right. So, would we have your questions?

01:24:45.334 --> 01:24:46.000
Yes, please.

01:24:46.834 --> 01:24:50.709
SEEKER: Do You have any previous [UNCLEAR]?

01:25:10.459 --> 01:25:17.876
SHRI MATAJI: All right. We have, we have, in so many languages, and in America we have lots of people.

01:25:35.459 --> 01:25:39.626
(A seeker asks a question in German)

01:25:41.417 --> 01:25:44.751
YOGINI: He asked why do we need Your photograph to meditate.

01:25:45.459 --> 01:25:50.042
SHRI MATAJI: That you will know yourself. That My photograph has got vibrations.

01:25:50.792 --> 01:25:55.709
And when you start using the photograph, you get the vibrations from Me.

01:25:56.125 --> 01:26:00.918
Because in the beginning you have to depend on something to get to the vibrations.

01:26:01.209 --> 01:26:05.292
But if you have something else which can work it out, I have no objection.

01:26:06.167 --> 01:26:07.792
But I haven't seen anything like that.

01:26:30.751 --> 01:26:33.125
Is very big blessing, I should say.

01:26:36.083 --> 01:26:37.959
I should say, so it's a big blessing.

01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:46.083
Because now there are people who are meditating in [Sierra de] [UNCLEAR], if you must have heard the name of that African country.

01:26:46.459 --> 01:26:50.375
And they… I can't go there just now, so they can manage with My photograph.

01:26:50.375 --> 01:26:52.501
It's something a very big blessing, I should say.

01:27:03.209 --> 01:27:10.375
But in the beginning, you need not if don't want to. If you want, you can, it's your… your lookout.

01:27:20.334 --> 01:27:30.209
SEEKER: Speaking of Your photograph, do You believe that stones and woods, different types of [UNCLEAR] from the Earth…

01:27:32.751 --> 01:27:42.125
Do You believe that stones, crystals and woods, things that come from the Earth and such, do they have healing powers in them that we can use?

01:27:56.250 --> 01:28:01.751
SHRI MATAJI: All right. Now supposing I say I believe, or if I say I don't believe. You should not take Me for granted.

01:28:03.501 --> 01:28:05.667
You can find out from [your] Self-realization.

01:28:07.584 --> 01:28:12.292
I would not say anything I believe, because whatever I believe may not be the truth.

01:28:14.083 --> 01:28:17.083
So keep it open. So simple.

01:28:46.125 --> 01:28:49.834
It's only the politicians say, "I believe, I believe." Who are you?

01:28:56.959 --> 01:29:01.042
You see, I shouldn't say such a thing. I would like you to find out yourself.

01:29:07.334 --> 01:29:13.959
SEEKER: What are… what are the real benefits of Sahaja Yoga? But the real benefits, and not [UNCLEAR]?

01:29:14.334 --> 01:29:16.626
SHRI MATAJI: What I told you are unreal according to you?

01:29:17.417 --> 01:29:24.959
SEEKER: A real benefit [UNCLEAR] of Sahaja Yoga, but what I mean, what is the real benefit [UNCLEAR]?

01:29:26.083 --> 01:29:28.000
YOGINI: What is the benefits of Sahaja Yoga.
SHRI MATAJI: Eh?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.667
YOGINI: He is asking what is the benefit of Sahaja Yoga.

01:29:30.667 --> 01:29:32.999
SHRI MATAJI: All this I have told you. Are you an Indian?

01:29:34.042 --> 01:29:35.209
Do you understand Hindi?

01:29:36.459 --> 01:29:38.167
Should I tell you in Hindi language?

01:29:38.959 --> 01:29:43.375
(Speaks in Hindi)

01:29:47.083 --> 01:29:48.167
Have you understood now?

01:29:49.542 --> 01:29:57.834
(Repeats in English) When you tell the whole Ramayana, the question is asked who is… who… what was the relationship between Rama and Sita.

01:30:11.834 --> 01:30:15.125
YOGINI: Sorry, what…
SHRI MATAJI: What was the relationship between Rama and Sita.

01:30:19.334 --> 01:30:30.918
SEEKER: [UNCLEAR] all sane people who are doing at this time Hatha Yoga in Germany and the world and trying to find themselves… to reach the place…

01:30:30.999 --> 01:30:32.542
SHRI MATAJI: I can't hear you.
YOGI: Can you say it again?

01:30:33.999 --> 01:30:34.876
SEEKER: When you start going…

01:30:34.876 --> 01:30:36.584
SHRI MATAJI: You see, this is your heritage.

01:30:37.083 --> 01:30:40.250
You all Indians should know this is your heritage.

01:30:40.999 --> 01:30:43.375
And all the saints have described it.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:52.209
And now you are in the German country; you should understand that here it is you have to show them what we have in the [UNCLEAR].

01:30:52.209 --> 01:30:53.042
SEEKER: No, but we have… (continues in German)

01:30:55.209 --> 01:30:55.792
SHRI MATAJI: What he's saying?

01:31:12.334 --> 01:31:12.834
What's it?

01:31:21.292 --> 01:31:21.876
What's he said?

01:31:22.959 --> 01:31:25.334
Have you written there that My photograph should be used?

01:31:28.751 --> 01:31:29.876
You shouldn't have, I think.

01:31:30.375 --> 01:31:33.209
You see, they are the people who just get stuck on these points.

01:31:34.292 --> 01:31:35.167
What does he say?

01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:49.417
Oh, I see, that's what.

01:31:49.709 --> 01:31:56.375
Now, Hatha Yoga was a time… it was practiced at the time of Patanjali.

01:31:56.918 --> 01:31:59.417
Patanjali lived thousands of years back.

01:31:59.751 --> 01:32:06.501
At that time, if you are an Indian, you will know that we had a system of four ashramas.

01:32:07.042 --> 01:32:10.209
At that time, when the students were children…

01:32:10.209 --> 01:32:14.876
Please that… I mean, if [UNCLEAR]. German you translate this.

01:32:36.834 --> 01:32:43.250
And the first one was of a brahmacharya, meaning celibate… celibacy, complete celibacy of the students.

01:32:50.292 --> 01:32:54.250
About twenty-five years for boys or twenty years for girls.

01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:06.167
So much so that belonging to the same university you could not marry. The universities were the gotras [families].

01:33:12.999 --> 01:33:15.959
Even take today, we cannot marry in the same gotra.

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:17.999
Till today.

01:33:24.501 --> 01:33:32.876
So, at that time, they used to teach boys at an younger age how to get their physical being all right, Hatha Yoga.

01:33:33.083 --> 01:33:36.417
And they were very great realized souls.

01:33:50.125 --> 01:34:00.167
And tell them what… what asana, what style of exercises they get for a particular personality.

01:34:11.792 --> 01:34:16.834
In Sahaja Yoga also we have asanas. We use.

01:34:22.417 --> 01:34:27.918
But when the Kundalini rises, we know where it is obstructed.

01:34:34.042 --> 01:34:42.209
Then we correct that particular chakra, that centre by… may be by asana if it's a physical obstruction.

01:34:50.375 --> 01:34:57.959
It is not just by blindly following every kind of asana, because it's like taking the whole of the medicines out of the medicine box.

01:35:07.918 --> 01:35:18.292
Now, ha and tha means the right side and the left side, is the Surya Nadi and the Chandra Nadi, is the Sun and the Moon channels.

01:35:25.417 --> 01:35:34.999
And these were meant to give a balance to a personality by giving them precise asanas.

01:35:45.292 --> 01:35:47.209
But this balance for what?

01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:55.667
The balance was for the ascent.

01:36:00.334 --> 01:36:04.751
Like, when making aeroplane, we have to see its balance.

01:36:05.959 --> 01:36:11.334
In the same way, a human being was balanced, and the ascent was given.

01:36:24.834 --> 01:36:33.626
But in Sahaja Yoga, we have discovered a method by which, even there is no balance, you can ascent.

01:36:42.501 --> 01:36:43.999
Right is the speciality.

01:36:50.042 --> 01:36:50.792
SEEKER: Thank You very much.

01:36:51.501 --> 01:36:58.709
We have people… there was one gentleman who came to My program, who was a drug addict. He came in a coma condition.

01:37:05.834 --> 01:37:07.459
And he got his realization.

01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:15.959
And next day you could not recognize him; he had given up everything, he said, "Now I'm different."

01:37:24.751 --> 01:37:33.417
So many things we have noticed, that it's amazing how the desire to become one with the Divine is strong in people.

01:37:45.167 --> 01:37:50.667
That it works wonders. Whatever may be the condition of the seeker, it just works.

01:37:56.918 --> 01:38:08.918
Only problem is that, after getting the first breakthrough, you have to slowly try to balance it and make it a permanent thing.

01:38:20.042 --> 01:38:22.250
Because, supposing you have some disease.

01:38:22.999 --> 01:38:26.334
Then the Kundalini goes back to that part and looks after.

01:38:26.334 --> 01:38:29.292
You can see with your naked eyes the Kundalini pulsating there.

01:38:41.792 --> 01:38:49.083
So you have to understand how to raise your Kundalini, how to fix [UNCLEAR], and how to raise the Kundalini of others.

01:39:01.375 --> 01:39:07.584
Also, you have to know how to decode, on your fingertips whatever you feel, what is the centre.

01:39:07.834 --> 01:39:13.501
Now what is this centre, what is this centre, what is this centre — you have to understand it.

01:39:24.334 --> 01:39:36.083
But one thing has to be understood that if you are superficially seeking something and mentally trying to understand, this is beyond your mental ability.

01:39:45.999 --> 01:39:47.959
It doesn't work out for such people.

01:39:53.584 --> 01:39:55.667
All right. Let's have another.

01:39:56.334 --> 01:40:01.834
SEEKER: How old one has to be to get realization?

01:40:13.459 --> 01:40:18.501
SHRI MATAJI: Aah, you are a real seeker I was telling. That's what we are going to do now. We have to permit you.

01:40:19.584 --> 01:40:20.584
So may God bless you!

01:40:21.167 --> 01:40:22.542
That's the question.

01:40:24.209 --> 01:40:24.959
All right?

01:40:25.709 --> 01:40:29.584
So, are you… all of you would like to have your realization?

01:40:39.250 --> 01:40:42.083
Let's see how far it works out.

01:40:53.292 --> 01:41:02.000
You have to do few things because I would like also you to know how to raise your own Kundalini.

01:41:11.918 --> 01:41:13.626
Which is a very simple thing.

01:41:16.459 --> 01:41:18.999
And which can be achieved without [UNCLEAR].

01:41:23.542 --> 01:41:29.083
But those who do not want to have Self-realization should please leave the hall.

01:41:36.292 --> 01:41:44.542
Because all of you should get your realization, but by your not doing it, you could be obstructing others.

01:41:52.834 --> 01:42:00.834
And it is not civil to disturb other people by your presence.

01:42:04.584 --> 01:42:11.999
Now, one humble request is that you have to take out your shoes, which is, I think, is not very difficult.

01:42:16.918 --> 01:42:18.876
And put your feet on the Mother Earth.

01:42:25.792 --> 01:42:31.626
Because that will give you help from the Mother Earth, who sucks in our problems.

01:42:38.876 --> 01:42:51.792
Better sit with parallel posture of both the legs, in this manner, because these are two different energies which are to be cleansed by the Mother Earth.

01:43:07.918 --> 01:43:14.209
Before you close your eyes, I have to make another humble request.

01:43:20.167 --> 01:43:24.667
Firstly, you have to know you are the temple of the Divine.

01:43:31.792 --> 01:43:36.792
And also that you are not to feel guilty about anything.

01:43:41.501 --> 01:43:46.292
I can feel from the chakras that you feel guilty for nothing at all.

01:43:52.292 --> 01:43:54.334
So, you should not feel guilty at all.

01:43:58.042 --> 01:44:01.709
On the contrary, you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:44:08.334 --> 01:44:17.542
And understand that you are about to enter into the kingdom of your own glory and beauty.

01:44:28.375 --> 01:44:34.209
So please don't count your mistakes and don't blame yourself for anything.

01:44:42.334 --> 01:44:51.999
So with all confidence we'll have to close our eyes, but before that I'll tell you how to use your left hand and right hand.

01:45:03.250 --> 01:45:10.375
You have to put your left hand towards Me, expressing the desire to get your Self-realization.

01:45:11.292 --> 01:45:16.918
This way. You [can put it] on your lap or on your table, is better; if you have a table, it's good idea.

01:45:21.250 --> 01:45:22.501
Open like this.

01:45:27.334 --> 01:45:31.999
[UNCLEAR] should not be tense or anything, but should not be like that, should be like that.

01:45:37.375 --> 01:45:46.167
These are… are the ends of sympathetic nervous system and are represented in all of your centres within you, chakras.

01:45:54.999 --> 01:45:57.959
The another thing is, you'll use your right hand.

01:46:02.792 --> 01:46:05.501
Right hand has to be first put on your heart.

01:46:09.834 --> 01:46:12.292
Please all of you put your… on your heart, it's simple.

01:46:17.999 --> 01:46:21.125
Now, this is the place where resides the spirit.

01:46:28.501 --> 01:46:34.209
Then you have to put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:46:41.584 --> 01:46:44.334
We are working on the chakras on the left-hand side.

01:46:49.667 --> 01:46:52.459
Now, this is the centre of your mastery.

01:46:56.083 --> 01:46:59.959
Because if you are the spirit, also you become your own master.

01:47:07.417 --> 01:47:10.751
Now you put your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen.

01:47:15.959 --> 01:47:20.876
Now, this is the centre by which the divine laws work.

01:47:27.125 --> 01:47:32.751
So this is the centre which represents the pure knowledge.

01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:45.918
Now you'll go back again and put your hand on the left-hand side of your abdomen, in the upper part.

01:47:52.834 --> 01:47:56.042
Then you put your right hand on your heart again.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:07.501
Now you put your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put it to the right.

01:48:08.834 --> 01:48:09.501
[UNCLEAR]

01:48:12.999 --> 01:48:14.626
And put your head to the right.

01:48:17.542 --> 01:48:23.667
Now, this is the centre usually is catching today much more because this is the centre you catch when you feel guilty.

01:48:23.999 --> 01:48:25.542
Put your head to the right please.

01:48:33.292 --> 01:48:44.000
All right. Now, please take your hand on your forehead across like this and press it on both the sides.

01:48:44.167 --> 01:48:48.000
Press it on both the sides here. Press it on both the sides.

01:48:48.375 --> 01:48:53.167
Like that, on both the sides, with finger and this side, just press it like that.

01:49:00.250 --> 01:49:02.417
This is the centre of forgiveness.

01:49:06.292 --> 01:49:13.999
Now, you take back your hand and put it on the back side of your head, and put all the… whole of your head on your hand.

01:49:22.417 --> 01:49:24.834
Now, stretch your hand. Fully.

01:49:25.584 --> 01:49:37.918
Stretch your hand fully with the fingers backwards, and the centre of your palm you have to put it on your fontanelle bone, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:49:49.209 --> 01:49:50.292
And press it hard.

01:49:51.334 --> 01:49:53.959
Move it seven times, your scalp.

01:49:58.167 --> 01:49:58.876
Clockwise.

01:50:01.999 --> 01:50:03.125
That's all you have to do.

01:50:11.584 --> 01:50:14.167
Now we will have to close the eyes.

01:50:14.626 --> 01:50:19.834
You can take your spectacles if it is disturbing you. Also helps your eyesight.

01:50:20.167 --> 01:50:26.626
Also, you can… if there's something tight on your body, you can loosen it.

01:50:27.042 --> 01:50:30.584
You have to be comfortable. You have to be comfortable…

01:50:43.918 --> 01:50:44.667
Now.

01:50:46.167 --> 01:50:48.459
Comfortable doesn't mean you should slump.

01:50:48.459 --> 01:50:53.334
But you should be straight, not pushing your head backwards or forwards but just straight.

01:51:01.667 --> 01:51:04.250
All right. Now close your eyes.

01:51:07.999 --> 01:51:10.125
This is how you take off, we can say.

01:51:14.042 --> 01:51:15.792
All right. Please close your eyes.

01:51:18.167 --> 01:51:21.959
I want you to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:51:26.250 --> 01:51:29.751
Not to allow ill feeling towards yourself or anyone.

01:51:35.999 --> 01:51:40.125
Now please close your eyes, don't keep them open.

01:51:40.125 --> 01:51:42.834
Please close your eyes, all of you close you eyes.

01:51:47.542 --> 01:51:55.417
Now. Put your hand, right hand on the heart and left hand towards Me.

01:52:04.542 --> 01:52:17.709
Here you have to say, or ask a question which is very fundamental — you can call Me Shri Mataji or you can call Me Mother, whatever you like — "Mother, am I the spirit?"

01:52:17.709 --> 01:52:21.083
Ask this fundamental question three times. Please.

01:52:48.209 --> 01:52:55.000
This question takes you to an another question, because if you are the spirit you are also your master.

01:53:05.792 --> 01:53:12.959
So now take your hand down onto the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it.

01:53:20.334 --> 01:53:26.876
Now, here you ask Me another fundamental question: "Mother, am I my own master?"

01:53:52.542 --> 01:53:53.709
Three times please.

01:53:59.999 --> 01:54:10.167
Now take your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.709
Here is the centre of pure knowledge.

01:54:24.999 --> 01:54:28.417
But I cannot force on you, so you have to ask for it.

01:54:28.751 --> 01:54:36.999
You have to say, "Mother, please, may I have the pure knowledge?"

01:54:40.667 --> 01:54:42.959
Or: "Mother, please give me the pure knowledge."

01:54:43.876 --> 01:54:49.167
All of you should put your left hand like this, not… some of you are just holding like that, that's not correct.

01:54:56.792 --> 01:54:59.792
Don't open your eyes, but she… somebody will come and correct you.

01:55:38.792 --> 01:55:42.417
Now… please don't open your eyes, please don't open your eyes.

01:55:45.042 --> 01:55:52.999
Ask this question, ask Me six times: "Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?" — because there are six petals.

01:56:07.584 --> 01:56:08.292
Now.

01:56:10.083 --> 01:56:13.334
When you say that, your Kundalini starts rising.

01:56:20.042 --> 01:56:40.125
To clear the way for the Kundalini, please try to put your right hand in the lower part of your ab— upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it, that centre of mastery.

01:57:00.876 --> 01:57:16.999
Here, with full confidence, you have to say, to open the centre you have to say, "Mother, I am my own master."

01:57:35.626 --> 01:57:40.542
Please say it with full confidence: "Mother, I am my own master."

01:57:48.501 --> 01:57:50.167
You have to say it ten times.

01:57:55.542 --> 01:57:57.083
Because there are ten petals.

01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:14.000
Now raise your right hand and put it on your heart.

01:58:21.042 --> 01:58:31.584
Here you have to say, again with full confidence, twelve times: "Mother, I am the spirit."

01:58:31.584 --> 01:58:33.250
This is the greatest truth.

01:59:04.250 --> 01:59:12.876
You have to know that the Divine is the ocean of love, grace and bliss.

01:59:14.292 --> 01:59:19.042
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:59:33.042 --> 01:59:40.959
And whatever mistakes you must have committed — or you think you have committed — can be easily resolved by that ocean.

01:59:56.209 --> 02:00:06.792
So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right side.

02:00:08.542 --> 02:00:13.709
From the… from the front side put the hand, not from the back side but from the front across.

02:00:23.042 --> 02:00:23.709
Here…

02:00:24.876 --> 02:00:29.125
Not from the back side please, put it from the front side.

02:00:35.334 --> 02:00:42.459
Here you have to say sixteen times with full confidence: "Mother, I am not guilty at all."

02:01:04.417 --> 02:01:07.751
"I am not guilty at all." Say it sixteen times.

02:01:13.459 --> 02:01:18.375
And if you feel even then guilty, then better punish yourself by saying hundred and eight times.

02:01:28.542 --> 02:01:31.167
You have to be pleasantly placed, as I have told you.

02:01:58.667 --> 02:02:06.209
Now please put your hand across over your forehead and press it on both the sides.

02:02:17.999 --> 02:02:26.417
At this point, you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

02:02:35.584 --> 02:02:40.542
Sometimes you feel it is very difficult to say.

02:02:47.542 --> 02:02:52.417
But whether you forgive or you don't forgive, it's a myth, you don't do anything.

02:03:00.542 --> 02:03:03.999
But if you do not forgive, you play into wrong hands.

02:03:10.292 --> 02:03:12.209
And you get emotionally disturbed.

02:03:15.792 --> 02:03:19.209
So say it from your heart, not how many times, say it from your heart.

02:03:28.375 --> 02:03:40.000
Now. Please take your hand back on the backside of your head and push it back, your head, on it.

02:03:49.876 --> 02:04:02.999
Just for your satisfaction — not to feel guilty, not to count your mistakes — you have to just say that "O Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me."

02:04:03.250 --> 02:04:05.292
But not to feel guilty at all.

02:04:31.209 --> 02:04:35.501
Now stretch your hand. Stretch your hand fully.

02:04:35.959 --> 02:04:44.709
Push back your fingers and put the centre of your palm on top of your head where there is a soft bone.

02:04:47.542 --> 02:04:50.167
Press it hard. Push back your fingers.

02:04:51.542 --> 02:04:53.000
Push back your fingers.

02:04:56.125 --> 02:04:59.375
Press it hard and move it seven times.

02:04:59.751 --> 02:05:10.834
At this time, you have to again ask for Self-realization because I cannot take your freedom.

02:05:12.459 --> 02:05:22.834
So you have to say it seven times: "Mother, please give me my realization," and move your hand with the pressure seven times.

02:05:22.834 --> 02:05:25.083
With the pressure. Move your scalp.

02:05:36.417 --> 02:05:38.542
Move it seven times with the pressure.

02:06:48.334 --> 02:06:49.584
(Aside) It's a [UNCLEAR] is coming out.

02:06:50.876 --> 02:06:54.167
May God bless you! Please take down your hands.

02:06:59.918 --> 02:07:02.667
Now open your eyes very slowly.

02:07:07.792 --> 02:07:14.876
Now put your right hand towards Me like this.

02:07:16.834 --> 02:07:20.250
Like this. Right hand.

02:07:24.959 --> 02:07:34.083
And bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area.

02:07:34.083 --> 02:07:36.125
Maybe some people get it very high.

02:07:42.167 --> 02:07:44.501
Not right. Right hand towards Me, right hand.

02:07:44.876 --> 02:07:47.459
Now with the left hand you see. Bend your head, you see?

02:07:47.918 --> 02:07:52.000
Bend your head a little, then you'll see better. Little higher, bend your head.

02:08:00.250 --> 02:08:02.292
With the left hand, see it with the left hand.

02:08:02.918 --> 02:08:03.542
Ah.

02:08:04.834 --> 02:08:08.250
Bend your head, it's better to see it with bent head, you can see it better.

02:08:09.209 --> 02:08:10.501
Put attention here, you see?

02:08:10.792 --> 02:08:12.542
Now put you left hand towards Me.

02:08:19.250 --> 02:08:19.918
Left hand.

02:08:20.834 --> 02:08:24.417
And now see it, bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze.

02:08:27.501 --> 02:08:28.167
Bend your head.

02:08:39.250 --> 02:08:42.792
Now again, put your right hand again, once more.

02:08:43.959 --> 02:08:47.167
And see it for left hand. Bend your head again to see it.

02:08:53.542 --> 02:08:54.083
See higher.

02:08:59.375 --> 02:09:02.167
Now raise your both the hands towards the sky.

02:09:06.334 --> 02:09:10.375
Push back your head and ask a question to Me:

02:09:14.125 --> 02:09:17.209
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

02:09:23.167 --> 02:09:25.501
Mother, is this the Chaitanya?

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:34.876
Is this the Power of Divine Love?"

02:09:39.584 --> 02:09:41.417
Ask this three times please.

02:09:49.876 --> 02:09:51.209
Now bring down your hands.

02:09:57.999 --> 02:10:12.709
Now those who have felt the cool breeze in the hands or on your forehead or on your top of your head, please raise both your hands.

02:10:13.751 --> 02:10:15.501
[UNCLEAR]

02:10:26.292 --> 02:10:27.167
Should?

02:10:27.667 --> 02:10:29.000
SEEKER: I know it's where it should be.

02:10:29.501 --> 02:10:34.125
SHRI MATAJI: Should [UNCLEAR] here. It's there, I can see it. May not be in the hands, but it's there.

02:10:35.999 --> 02:10:39.000
So, may God bless you!

02:10:39.999 --> 02:10:42.000
All of you [have got it]. Most of you.

02:10:46.626 --> 02:10:47.834
I bow to you.

02:10:55.167 --> 02:10:56.501
May God bless you all!

02:10:58.125 --> 02:11:08.667
And that you develop your realization and settle it once for all, become the masters yourselves.

02:11:19.417 --> 02:11:28.375
Tomorrow I'll be again here and explain to you all the details about the left and right side problems that we have.

02:11:38.334 --> 02:11:39.417
Please come back,

02:11:41.999 --> 02:11:43.999
and I'll meet you all individually.

02:11:47.626 --> 02:11:49.292
Also bring your friends.

02:11:52.125 --> 02:11:53.209
Tell them about it.

02:11:55.959 --> 02:11:58.918
Those who haven't got it will feel it tomorrow.

02:12:03.167 --> 02:12:06.876
And those who have got it will fix it properly.

02:12:12.292 --> 02:12:17.542
But there's one thing that whatever you've got is beyond thinking.

02:12:25.959 --> 02:12:32.292
So don't start thinking about it, because if you start thinking about it, tomorrow you'll come and say, "Mother, I'm lost."

02:12:44.417 --> 02:12:51.417
So when you come tomorrow, you'll be again fresh and you'll feel your oneness with the Divine.

02:12:59.167 --> 02:13:06.626
Also, if you have any questions, please give them at the beginning of the program, so I'll try to come earlier.

02:13:18.167 --> 02:13:19.250
Thank you very much.

02:13:24.667 --> 02:13:29.417
You got it. She got it, [UNCLEAR] got it. May Gob bless you!

02:13:30.292 --> 02:13:31.292
Enjoy yourself.

02:13:32.209 --> 02:13:34.334
What's the matter?

02:13:35.542 --> 02:13:36.083
You've got it.

02:13:37.959 --> 02:13:43.751
She's got it too, but she… she is… her Vishuddhi is… this is not all right? She smokes?

02:13:44.959 --> 02:13:45.709
Aah.

02:13:47.209 --> 02:13:50.417
That's why she can't feel. But it's all right, [UNCLEAR].
