00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:44.441
At the very outset, we have to know that the truth is what it is.

00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:54.311
You cannot change it

00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:57.901
You cannot transform it

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:03.661
And at this human awareness you cannot know it

00:12:13.521 --> 00:12:22.421
That means in our evolutionary process we have reached this state of a human being

00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:26.401
but it is not the end of our evolution

00:12:40.869 --> 00:12:46.969
because we don´t know what is Absolute truth.

00:12:49.809 --> 00:12:53.989
Whatever I´m going to tell you today

00:12:55.789 --> 00:12:59.909
you have to take it

00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:08.049
with an open mind like a scientist.

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:20.189
If it is proved

00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:23.669
than you have to accept it as

00:13:24.209 --> 00:13:26.649
honest people.

00:13:30.989 --> 00:13:36.729
Because it is for your benevolence,

00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:41.189
it is for the benevolence of your country,

00:13:41.689 --> 00:13:44.649
it is for the benevolence of the whole world.

00:14:00.969 --> 00:14:07.329
So please listen to me carefully what I have to tell you.

00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:25.969
There is within us

00:14:26.969 --> 00:14:28.889
a power,

00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:33.069
which is placed in the triangular bone,

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.629
for our ascend.

00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:55.329
It is for our last breakthrough.

00:14:57.949 --> 00:15:03.109
And this breakthrough has to happen

00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:08.269
as a process of our evolution.

00:15:13.589 --> 00:15:18.129
So the truth is that

00:15:18.529 --> 00:15:21.569
you are not this body,

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:26.209
this mind, this ego, these conditionings.

00:15:26.609 --> 00:15:30.069
But you are the Pure Spirit.

00:15:41.349 --> 00:15:46.369
And the second truth is that there is

00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:52.149
a very subtle power of Divine Love

00:15:53.249 --> 00:16:03.169
that does all the living work.

00:16:12.649 --> 00:16:15.669
We see all these beautiful flowers all around us.

00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:23.689
But we don´t even think whatever a miracle it is.

00:16:29.729 --> 00:16:36.369
That out of one seed such beautiful flowers come out.

00:16:42.329 --> 00:16:44.409
Who runs your heart?

00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:50.249
The doctors may say it is the autonomous nervous system.

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:52.209
Who is this auto?

00:17:04.629 --> 00:17:09.089
We go to science and we find that there

00:17:09.269 --> 00:17:12.389
are many questions which cannot be answered.

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:23.829
Science cannot tell us why are we on this Earth.

00:17:29.449 --> 00:17:31.729
What is the purpose of life?

00:17:34.289 --> 00:17:38.549
What is our identity?

00:17:41.509 --> 00:17:44.869
So we take to religions.

00:17:48.689 --> 00:17:52.529
But religions have created nothing but fundamentalism.

00:17:55.969 --> 00:17:57.929
It is a blind faith.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:04.089
And all kinds of problems have brought up in the name of God.

00:18:12.729 --> 00:18:16.909
They are only money-oriented or power-oriented.

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:26.989
They are not spirit-oriented.

00:18:30.929 --> 00:18:36.529
But in these modern times there are a lot of false gurus also

00:18:36.869 --> 00:18:40.489
who have come out to make money out of your simplicity.

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:57.889
If it is a living process, how can you pay for it?

00:19:02.329 --> 00:19:04.289
Like this Mother Earth.

00:19:05.389 --> 00:19:08.909
How are we to pay Her for these flowers?

00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:18.949
Also some people say we have to suffer.

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:27.989
There is no need to suffer at all.

00:19:32.969 --> 00:19:39.569
Imagine if God Almighty is the father of all the fathers,

00:19:39.569 --> 00:19:41.569
how can He want you to suffer or Him?

00:19:55.389 --> 00:19:57.409
He is your father,

00:19:57.649 --> 00:20:01.009
full of compassion,

00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:04.989
full of joy for you.

00:20:12.709 --> 00:20:16.189
I have seen there are some false people coming

00:20:16.509 --> 00:20:18.909
and teaching some mantras

00:20:19.289 --> 00:20:20.649
and things like that

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:22.449
and some boys, I was surprised

00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:25.469
poor things were just going on saying some mantras.

00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:44.449
If it is coming from India,

00:20:45.449 --> 00:20:51.349
You should not believe that all that comems from India is good. Not at all.

00:20:55.929 --> 00:20:58.729
Be very careful.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:04.609
It is people who are trying to mesmerize your younger generation.

00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:20.009
As I have told you that

00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:25.089
you have to be the Spirit.

00:21:26.749 --> 00:21:30.789
That means it is an actualization.

00:21:31.729 --> 00:21:34.349
It is a happening

00:21:34.729 --> 00:21:37.489
of becoming.

00:21:48.209 --> 00:21:51.509
So it is not just a lecture or

00:21:51.849 --> 00:21:55.389
or a sermon or a mental process.

00:22:05.729 --> 00:22:08.269
But a happening within you.

00:22:08.529 --> 00:22:11.709
That you become something different.

00:22:20.129 --> 00:22:23.889
We see so many problems in this world these days

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:27.609
You have no idea how much problematic it is

00:22:28.229 --> 00:22:31.569
in democratic countries.

00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:45.249
But it is happening in America which is supposed to be the greatest democratic country

00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:49.809
It is just full of idiotic and stupid people.

00:22:55.089 --> 00:23:01.129
It is surprising how they are taking life, for example

00:23:01.689 --> 00:23:05.209
they spend all their time in absolute, stupid, nonsencial

00:23:05.749 --> 00:23:09.369
idiotic things.

00:23:17.369 --> 00:23:21.689
I sometimes don´t understand how come

00:23:21.989 --> 00:23:26.089
human beings can become like that.

00:23:30.769 --> 00:23:32.889
Also tremendous level of

00:23:33.869 --> 00:23:38.649
an enterpreneour starts say a fashion.

00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:41.329
Say for example narrow pants.

00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:57.749
So they are all dressed up like that.

00:23:58.689 --> 00:24:02.849
Nobody has freedom to keep to their own dress.

00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:13.569
They all wear it and they get varicose veins.

00:24:20.749 --> 00:24:25.529
They wear it even then they get varicose veins.

00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:30.869
Then they develop some other nonsense.

00:24:35.949 --> 00:24:39.949
Like six-inches of a skirt for ladies.

00:24:46.389 --> 00:24:51.669
Even in the cold of England they are wearing that kind of a dress.

00:24:59.009 --> 00:25:00.929
They talk of individuality.

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:06.269
Where is the individuality?

00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:17.569
They do really very stupid things please thank God you have escaped.

00:25:25.409 --> 00:25:30.049
They have got the freedom, alright, but no wisdom.

00:25:36.329 --> 00:25:46.289
And now it´s full of AIDS, full of schizofrenia, madness, lunacy, all kinds of funny diseases.

00:25:59.849 --> 00:26:03.529
Drugs of all kinds they are taking.

00:26:07.069 --> 00:26:10.929
It´s not only the children but even grown-ups in parties.

00:26:11.349 --> 00:26:14.069
They talk of drugs.

00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:25.429
They have not matured at all.

00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:31.949
I don´t say communism was the solution.

00:26:36.209 --> 00:26:38.669
But nor is democracy.

00:26:45.209 --> 00:26:47.709
Unless and until you have wisdom,

00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:51.029
both things can be very dangerous.

00:26:57.689 --> 00:27:04.369
Now they are selling all their junk which was not sold in their countries to you people here.

00:27:15.009 --> 00:27:24.289
Due to recession now they are going to Russia and all these places, even to India, to sell all their junk.

00:27:34.329 --> 00:27:36.409
But there is a solution

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:39.469
to all these problems.

00:27:45.969 --> 00:27:49.549
This solution lies within yourself.

00:27:52.869 --> 00:27:56.629
You don´t have to go Moon,

00:27:58.229 --> 00:28:02.989
You don´t have to go to Jupiter to discover it.

00:28:12.589 --> 00:28:17.929
Most of the problems that are visible are due to human beings.

00:28:23.329 --> 00:28:27.769
Most of the human problems are beacuse of the subtle centers,

00:28:28.309 --> 00:28:31.469
within them are in trouble.

00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:47.169
When this Kundalini rises,

00:28:47.569 --> 00:28:50.349
She nourishes all these centers,

00:28:50.649 --> 00:28:53.629
interates them and connects you to this

00:28:54.189 --> 00:28:56.749
All-pervading Power.

00:29:14.449 --> 00:29:16.849
Because of these centers we suffer,

00:29:16.849 --> 00:29:21.329
physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

00:29:32.869 --> 00:29:37.169
No doubt, with the ascend of Kundalini

00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:42.409
people have cured of their many incurable diseases.

00:29:55.329 --> 00:29:57.489
When the Kundalini comes

00:29:57.989 --> 00:30:00.149
out of your fontanel bone area,

00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:05.129
you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:20.849
This Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

00:30:33.089 --> 00:30:38.649
...described about God Almighty and His son.

00:30:41.709 --> 00:30:45.129
but nothing about the Mother.

00:30:47.169 --> 00:30:51.709
The third one is the Holy Ghost which is a dove.

00:30:58.049 --> 00:31:02.569
Symbolically it is alright, it is pure and it ascends.

00:31:08.129 --> 00:31:14.369
But in all other religions they have described  a Primordial Mother.

00:31:21.369 --> 00:31:25.569
This has happened because of Paul.

00:31:26.829 --> 00:31:29.069
He was a hater of women.

00:31:31.349 --> 00:31:34.389
And he never met Christ, all stories are told.

00:31:40.049 --> 00:31:45.909
He had killed so many christians and then he wanted to jump on the platform.

00:31:51.869 --> 00:31:53.949
And he chose Peter.

00:31:54.649 --> 00:32:00.549
as the person who will be anointed with the highest position

00:32:00.809 --> 00:32:05.049
in christian religion.

00:32:13.329 --> 00:32:16.689
Peter was the worst disciple of Christ.

00:32:22.249 --> 00:32:25.209
So Christ also said to Peter

00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:27.889
that a Satan will take you over.

00:32:34.769 --> 00:32:38.169
I was myself born in a christian family.

00:32:39.689 --> 00:32:42.409
And I asked my father: "Who is this Paul?"

00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:49.709
He was a realized soul my father,

00:32:50.249 --> 00:32:55.489
and he said: "He is a squatter."

00:32:58.209 --> 00:33:01.809
He has done a great harm to the West.

00:33:02.429 --> 00:33:04.729
by not respecting women.

00:33:13.609 --> 00:33:17.289
He did not respect the Mother of Christ.

00:33:19.989 --> 00:33:21.869
He calls her a woman.

00:33:25.309 --> 00:33:28.769
In Quran  Mohammed respects her very much.

00:33:34.569 --> 00:33:38.809
And said nobody should take any objection about her morality.

00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:58.349
This Paul´s turning of Christ´s life has really ruined the message of Christ.

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:16.409
You find all these churches

00:34:16.649 --> 00:34:21.169
have become very money-oriented and power-oriented.

00:34:31.769 --> 00:34:37.509
So now after giving up communism you might jump onto these, any of them

00:34:38.169 --> 00:34:41.549
it´s very dangerous again.

00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:57.209
Even the Madonna was never a name given in the Bible to the mother of Christ.

00:35:06.169 --> 00:35:09.929
It came from the father religion.

00:35:10.769 --> 00:35:13.329
Which was before Christ.

00:35:24.249 --> 00:35:28.869
As a result the women in the West are extremely insecure.

00:35:36.329 --> 00:35:43.109
I was surprised, how they have to all the time please the men and please the children.

00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:55.349
And are really going into the complete waste of immorality.

00:36:02.389 --> 00:36:07.049
India politically and economically is a hopeless case. I agree.

00:36:14.989 --> 00:36:18.669
But the society is very well named.

00:36:26.969 --> 00:36:31.629
And women don´t have to be insecure in that society.

00:36:33.909 --> 00:36:37.289
For them their power is their chastity.

00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:46.069
Even in modern times.

00:36:50.229 --> 00:36:55.669
So to achieve that sense of security also we have to be the Spirit.

00:37:03.469 --> 00:37:05.629
First thing that happens to you

00:37:05.909 --> 00:37:09.129
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:37:19.269 --> 00:37:22.649
It´s a new dimension in your awareness.

00:37:28.249 --> 00:37:36.029
There are thoughts which come to us from the past and the future.

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:41.789
But we cannot be in the present.

00:37:44.269 --> 00:37:49.909
When the Kundalini rises she separates the thoughts.

00:37:52.149 --> 00:37:57.329
So we become thoughtless but fully aware.

00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:06.229
We jump into the present.

00:38:09.729 --> 00:38:12.609
Which is the reality.

00:38:14.989 --> 00:38:19.429
The past is finished and the future doesn´t exist.

00:38:23.529 --> 00:38:27.409
In that state you start growing spiritually.

00:38:34.889 --> 00:38:38.589
The Spirit is a universal being within you.

00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:46.889
It transcends

00:38:47.249 --> 00:38:52.109
all barriers that we have created by our mental activity.

00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:04.809
Of ritualism, fundamentalism, all kinds of isms.

00:39:13.709 --> 00:39:18.829
You realize that all these religions were born on the same tree of spirituality.

00:39:19.209 --> 00:39:23.969
These people have cut them and are fighting with the dead flowers.

00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:44.069
In the state of thoughtless awareness

00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:46.289
you feel your peace within yourself.

00:39:50.789 --> 00:39:52.949
This is the peace we are seeking.

00:39:55.049 --> 00:39:57.049
People talk of peace,

00:40:00.689 --> 00:40:05.169
have big arguments and conferences but there is no peace within themselves.

00:40:16.389 --> 00:40:19.269
They have been given awards and this, that.

00:40:19.729 --> 00:40:25.189
But I have seen they are very hot-tempered people.

00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:34.449
So by your ascend

00:40:35.809 --> 00:40:38.209
you become a peaceful personality,

00:40:38.449 --> 00:40:41.649
relaxed personality, satisfied personality.

00:40:52.509 --> 00:40:55.289
And you become wise nad discreet.

00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:07.149
Because you see the reality.

00:41:10.769 --> 00:41:13.369
And you feel the totality.

00:41:16.289 --> 00:41:20.369
When this Kundalini pierces thought the fontanel bone area,

00:41:20.369 --> 00:41:23.549
you start feeling cool breeze on your fingertips.

00:41:33.709 --> 00:41:36.249
This is the All-pervading power.

00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:48.249
Which in Quran is called as Ruh.

00:41:50.429 --> 00:41:52.669
In sanskrit as Paramachaitanya.

00:41:55.949 --> 00:42:02.269
Your attention becomes enlightened and innocent.

00:42:04.869 --> 00:42:08.569
You innocence is never lost.

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:15.129
It is always there.

00:42:16.429 --> 00:42:22.289
Only thing, because of your so called freedom there are some clouds.

00:42:27.129 --> 00:42:33.289
But when Kundalini rises and connects you to the All-pervading power

00:42:34.989 --> 00:42:38.189
you become innocent, your eyes ecome innocent.

00:42:48.509 --> 00:42:52.169
You know the Absolute truth on your finger tips,

00:42:57.489 --> 00:42:59.329
even the realized children can tell you

00:43:00.649 --> 00:43:02.809
what´s wrong with your centers.

00:43:08.949 --> 00:43:12.949
Not that you can feel your own centers, that´s self-knowledge,

00:43:12.949 --> 00:43:14.989
but also the centers of others.

00:43:23.629 --> 00:43:25.629
So you develop a new dimension

00:43:25.929 --> 00:43:29.969
in your awareness of collective consciousness.

00:43:37.989 --> 00:43:42.849
Ultimately you develop the powers to raise the Kundalini of others.

00:43:54.689 --> 00:43:58.549
As one enlightened candle can enlighten many candles.

00:43:59.969 --> 00:44:04.069
The life becomes absolutely blissful.

00:44:07.649 --> 00:44:10.749
And you jump into the ocean of joy.

00:44:14.289 --> 00:44:15.569
Joy has no duality.

00:44:16.989 --> 00:44:19.069
of happiness and unhappiness.

00:44:28.329 --> 00:44:31.329
It is the experience of joy, you feel it.

00:44:40.669 --> 00:44:43.309
Sahajayoga is working in 55 nations,

00:44:49.989 --> 00:44:53.169
so many have been cured.

00:44:54.009 --> 00:44:57.549
so many have now the powers,

00:44:57.949 --> 00:45:03.489
but I have never seen them fighting, quarreling,

00:45:11.369 --> 00:45:16.609
All full of humour and enjoyment.

00:45:23.789 --> 00:45:26.829
What a different type of life.

00:45:32.009 --> 00:45:34.409
That´s what is for you.

00:45:39.929 --> 00:45:46.589
You have to achieve it without any difficulties.

00:45:49.869 --> 00:45:52.289
It is very, very simple.

00:45:54.449 --> 00:45:57.049
Sahaja means "born with you,"

00:45:59.809 --> 00:46:04.609
is the right to be united, that is yoga, with this All-pervading power.

00:46:13.929 --> 00:46:16.789
For which you don´t pay.

00:46:18.949 --> 00:46:21.109
But it is a collective happening

00:46:21.809 --> 00:46:23.729
it´s a collective organism,

00:46:29.989 --> 00:46:31.909
so you have to be collective.

00:46:32.869 --> 00:46:36.129
If one nail is cut out, it doesn´t grow.

00:46:42.909 --> 00:46:50.009
Now see how Germans and Austrians have come to your town

00:46:50.369 --> 00:46:52.769
and arranged this program.

00:47:03.689 --> 00:47:06.689
How so many English going to Russia.

00:47:10.889 --> 00:47:14.809
Like there is one finger which has some pain, the whole body

00:47:16.169 --> 00:47:21.089
goes to it to get it alright.

00:47:33.429 --> 00:47:36.229
So it will take hardly about ten minutes from you

00:47:37.289 --> 00:47:38.969
to get your realization.

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:47.889
But there are three conditions.

00:47:51.229 --> 00:47:52.749
Which are very simple.

00:47:57.149 --> 00:48:01.209
The first one is that

00:48:01.929 --> 00:48:06.409
you should not feel guilty at all.

00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:14.189
It´s a fashion nowadays to feel guilty.

00:48:18.169 --> 00:48:22.409
After all, you are human beings and human beings all make mistakes.

00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:26.289
You are not God.

00:48:32.289 --> 00:48:36.149
If you make mistakes, let´s face it, why feel guilty?

00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:48.609
By feeling guilty, this centre here on the left side

00:48:48.989 --> 00:48:51.129
goes out of order.

00:48:56.649 --> 00:48:59.849
And physically also you may suffer from angina,

00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:05.849
or from spondylitis or from lethargic organs all over the body.

00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:23.589
Don´t believe people who tell you you are sinners.

00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:29.369
They are the greatest sinners who tell you like that.

00:49:33.209 --> 00:49:37.689
After all you are human beings, you are at the epitomy of evolution.

00:49:47.269 --> 00:49:48.869
The second condition is

00:49:49.909 --> 00:49:54.089
that you have to forgive evryone in general.

00:50:03.049 --> 00:50:07.689
Logically whether you forgive or you don´t forgive, you don´t do anything.

00:50:10.989 --> 00:50:12.669
But if you don´t forgive,

00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:16.669
than you play into wrong hands and torture yourself.

00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:29.129
So you don´t even have to think about them, you have to just

00:50:30.249 --> 00:50:35.289
in general, say " I forgive everyone," it´s nonsense.

00:50:40.649 --> 00:50:43.289
Also it is a myth.

00:50:49.949 --> 00:50:53.529
Now there is a center within us on the optic chiasm which is like this.

00:50:54.669 --> 00:50:56.669
Closed.

00:51:05.969 --> 00:51:08.849
And if you don´t forgive,

00:51:09.089 --> 00:51:11.549
then it doesn´t open.

00:51:12.029 --> 00:51:14.589
But if you forgive, it opens like this.

00:51:18.669 --> 00:51:22.069
You feel much lighter and

00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:25.229
Kundalini may pass through.

00:51:35.269 --> 00:51:38.789
All your life you tortured yourself by not forgiving.

00:51:39.769 --> 00:51:42.649
And at this moment you will miss the great point

00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:45.509
of achieving your realization.

00:51:59.589 --> 00:52:01.349
Now the third condition is

00:52:02.049 --> 00:52:06.329
that you have to have full faith in yourself,

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:11.029
full confidence that you will all get your realization tonight.

00:52:23.489 --> 00:52:29.609
It sounds fantastic but you are fantastic.

00:52:30.029 --> 00:52:36.769
You don´t know yourself. Once you know yourself, you will be amazed,

00:52:37.029 --> 00:52:39.729
how many powers you have.

00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:45.729
What you can do to yourself and to  the whole world.

00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:58.249
Unless and until this microphone is connected to the mains, it has no identity, it has no meaning.

00:53:10.729 --> 00:53:13.689
But as soon as you are connected to the mains,

00:53:14.629 --> 00:53:16.989
you know what you are.

00:53:23.029 --> 00:53:25.549
These are the three conditions

00:53:26.169 --> 00:53:28.009
I hope you will fulfill.

00:53:39.629 --> 00:53:42.589
As it is I think you are very sensible people,

00:53:43.669 --> 00:53:47.009
the way you have elected your president,

00:53:56.809 --> 00:53:58.649
the whole  world knows that.

00:54:03.469 --> 00:54:07.069
So now those who do not want to have their realization,

00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:13.809
should know that I cannot force it on you.

00:54:21.509 --> 00:54:23.669
Because I respect your freedom.

00:54:27.689 --> 00:54:29.209
It´s a last judgement,

00:54:29.489 --> 00:54:32.429
you have to judge yourself.

00:54:36.609 --> 00:54:39.969
In Quran it is said that at the time of resurrection

00:54:40.769 --> 00:54:42.289
your hands will speak.

00:54:42.729 --> 00:54:46.109
They give a witness against you.

00:54:56.049 --> 00:54:59.489
And these hands will tell you what´s wrong with you and

00:54:59.689 --> 00:55:02.329
what´s wrong with others.

00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:09.029
And if you know how to correct your centers,

00:55:09.029 --> 00:55:11.029
you can correct yourself

00:55:11.869 --> 00:55:13.709
and you can correct others.

00:55:23.669 --> 00:55:27.989
Those who do not want to have realization, should leave the hall.

00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:38.589
Of course, Sahajayoga is not meant for idiots and stupid people.

00:55:43.429 --> 00:55:46.549
And it´s not meant for  arrogant people either.

00:55:47.069 --> 00:55:55.149
Also for people who are involved in some sort of an ideology or

00:55:58.909 --> 00:56:01.669
some sort of blind faith.

00:56:14.609 --> 00:56:18.849
Again I request those who do not want to have their self-realization,

00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:21.189
they should leave the hall.

00:56:44.729 --> 00:56:47.769
You have to be pleasently placed to yourself,

00:56:53.909 --> 00:56:54.629
now please

00:56:55.329 --> 00:57:00.049
you have to remove your shoes,

00:57:00.729 --> 00:57:02.809
because this Mother Earth also

00:57:03.189 --> 00:57:05.349
helps us to suck in our problems.

00:57:30.129 --> 00:57:34.049
Now the left and the right are two powers,

00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:36.029
one is for your desire

00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:37.949
and another for action.

00:57:48.649 --> 00:57:52.169
So you have to put both your feet apart from each other

00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:54.729
and sit comfortably.

00:58:00.569 --> 00:58:04.329
You don´t have to go to the Himalayas and stand on your head.

00:58:10.229 --> 00:58:13.749
You will get your realization in your seats tonight.

00:58:19.709 --> 00:58:24.169
So now please put your left hand

00:58:24.769 --> 00:58:29.389
towards Me on your left hip or left.

00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:43.549
Beacuse this is suggestive or symbolic that you

00:58:43.629 --> 00:58:47.269
desire to have your self-realization.

00:58:54.209 --> 00:58:58.229
You have to have Pure desire.

00:59:00.569 --> 00:59:06.089
The right hand we use for nourishing our centers on the lefthand side of ourselves.

00:59:12.869 --> 00:59:15.549
This we do it only

00:59:15.909 --> 00:59:18.629
for tonight you don´t have to do it later.

00:59:23.529 --> 00:59:29.189
So now please put your right hand on your heart.

00:59:29.189 --> 00:59:31.189
Somebody will show it.

00:59:43.009 --> 00:59:45.709
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:59:49.189 --> 00:59:52.429
If you become the Spirit, in the light of your Spirit,

00:59:52.729 --> 00:59:55.269
you become your own master.

01:00:03.649 --> 01:00:07.069
So you have to take your right hand

01:00:07.389 --> 01:00:12.329
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:24.549
This is the center of your mastery.

01:00:27.769 --> 01:00:33.109
Which is created by all the great Prophets.

01:00:41.509 --> 01:00:44.529
It has to be enlightened.

01:00:45.569 --> 01:00:52.189
So now you have to take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the lefthand side.

01:00:57.449 --> 01:01:04.109
This is the center of Pure divine knowledge.

01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:15.689
We will know about it later on,

01:01:16.129 --> 01:01:20.909
how it caters to the Divine knowledge.

01:01:38.869 --> 01:01:44.769
Now please raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen,

01:01:53.469 --> 01:01:55.489
now on your heart.

01:01:57.289 --> 01:02:06.049
Now in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right.

01:02:14.229 --> 01:02:20.889
I have already told you what happens to you when this center is out of care.

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:33.129
Now take your right hand on your forehead across and put out your head.

01:02:40.649 --> 01:02:46.169
This is the center for forgiving everyone in general.

01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:55.529
Now please take back your right hand

01:02:55.529 --> 01:02:58.709
on the backside of your head and push back.

01:02:59.049 --> 01:03:01.149
as far as possible.

01:03:09.569 --> 01:03:18.769
This center, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction.

01:03:31.429 --> 01:03:33.589
You have to ask for forgiveness.

01:03:33.909 --> 01:03:36.229
From this Divine power.

01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:45.669
Now the last center is important.

01:03:48.249 --> 01:03:50.809
Please stretch your palm fully.

01:03:55.669 --> 01:04:01.769
Put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area

01:04:02.009 --> 01:04:06.089
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:04:15.909 --> 01:04:19.529
Push back your fingers as far as possible.

01:04:23.609 --> 01:04:25.529
Press it hard,

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:31.989
move your scalp and move it seven times slowly, clockwise.

01:04:46.389 --> 01:04:48.949
That´s all you have to do.

01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:58.149
Now we have to close our eyes,

01:05:01.229 --> 01:05:05.709
before that please see that both your feet are apart from each other

01:05:13.289 --> 01:05:16.729
Put the left hand toward Me like this.

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.649
Right hand on the heart.

01:05:27.649 --> 01:05:30.929
Do not concentrate, do not pressurize your mind.

01:05:36.989 --> 01:05:39.789
Everything will work out spontaneously.

01:05:45.329 --> 01:05:46.689
Now close your eyes.

01:05:46.689 --> 01:05:49.349
And please don´t open them till I tell you.

01:06:00.409 --> 01:06:03.529
Here you have to ask Me a fundamental question

01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:05.709
about yourself three times.

01:06:06.649 --> 01:06:09.129
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.

01:06:20.229 --> 01:06:22.709
Please ask three times in your heart.

01:06:26.409 --> 01:06:28.009
Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:06:35.949 --> 01:06:38.829
I have told you, when you become the Spirit,

01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:42.629
you become your own master.

01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:58.069
So take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.949
press it hard

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:07.189
and here ask another fundamental question about yourself to Me.

01:07:15.089 --> 01:07:19.569
Ask a question: "Mother, am I my own master?"

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.069
Three times.

01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:37.229
I have already told you that I respect your freedom.

01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:41.129
I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

01:07:56.989 --> 01:07:59.049
Take out your hand

01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:06.429
on the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:08:15.189 --> 01:08:19.369
Here you have to ask for Pure knowledge.

01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:29.569
Here ask 6 times because this center has got 6 petals.

01:08:29.949 --> 01:08:34.209
Mother please give me Pure knowledge.

01:08:59.889 --> 01:09:02.449
As soon as you ask for Pure knowledge,

01:09:02.589 --> 01:09:07.149
the Kundalini starts rising and we have to nourish the upper centers

01:09:07.809 --> 01:09:09.569
with our full confidence.

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:26.829
So now raise your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen

01:09:27.389 --> 01:09:30.289
on the left hand side and press it hard

01:09:30.409 --> 01:09:34.889
here you ahve to say with full confidence 10 times,

01:09:35.629 --> 01:09:39.109
Mother, I am my own master.

01:10:12.449 --> 01:10:17.249
I alreday told you that you are not this body, this mind, this ego

01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:19.269
these conditionings but

01:10:19.469 --> 01:10:21.389
you are the Pure Spirit.

01:10:32.509 --> 01:10:35.709
So now raise your right hand on your heart and say

01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:37.549
with full confidence 12 times

01:10:38.049 --> 01:10:40.869
Mother, I am the Pure Spirit.

01:10:58.709 --> 01:11:00.869
This All-pervading power is the

01:11:01.349 --> 01:11:04.749
ocean of knowledge.

01:11:10.629 --> 01:11:16.209
It is the ocean of joy and blessings.

01:11:19.649 --> 01:11:27.009
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:11:28.489 --> 01:11:31.609
Whatever misteakes you might have committed,

01:11:36.689 --> 01:11:42.529
it can be easily dissolved by this power of forgiveness.

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:58.109
So now forgive yourself and raise your hand to the border of your neck and turn your head to the right.

01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:15.329
Here you have to say with full confidence 16 times

01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:19.609
Mother I am not guilty at all.

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:36.109
I have already told you that logically

01:12:36.109 --> 01:12:38.489
whether you forgive or you don´t forgive

01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:40.209
you don´t do anything.

01:12:48.049 --> 01:12:50.669
But you torture yourself.

01:12:56.009 --> 01:13:04.969
At this junction if you don´t forgive, the center won´t open and Kundalini won´t pass.

01:13:21.989 --> 01:13:27.229
So please forgive all of them in general, not thinking about them.

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:40.929
Now raise your right hand on the forehead across and put your head down

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:45.089
and here you have to say from your heart, not how many times

01:13:45.409 --> 01:13:50.569
Mother, I forgive everyone in general.

01:14:08.349 --> 01:14:11.229
Now without feeling guilty

01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:12.989
without counting your mistakes

01:14:13.789 --> 01:14:15.709
just for your satisfaction,

01:14:16.789 --> 01:14:21.529
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

01:14:40.789 --> 01:14:43.589
Take your hand on the backside of your head

01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:46.449
and push back your head

01:14:46.609 --> 01:14:49.029
and here with full confidence from your heart, not how many times -

01:14:51.289 --> 01:14:56.429
you have to say - Divine Power if I have done wrong,

01:14:56.849 --> 01:15:00.049
knowingly or unknowingly, please forogive me.

01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:24.009
The last center is important.

01:15:24.309 --> 01:15:26.909
Where you have to stretch your palm fully

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:29.289
and put the center of your palm

01:15:29.289 --> 01:15:31.229
on top of the fontanel bone area

01:15:31.489 --> 01:15:33.969
which is a soft bone in your childhood

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:56.729
Put down your head and push back your fingers so there is sufficient pressure on your scalp.

01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:13.509
Here again I cannot force self-realization on you

01:16:13.509 --> 01:16:14.949
you have to ask for it.

01:16:15.609 --> 01:16:20.449
So move your hand seven times clockwise

01:16:20.449 --> 01:16:26.109
say from your heart - Mother please give me my self-realization.

01:16:55.549 --> 01:16:58.209
Please bend your head.

01:17:00.289 --> 01:17:01.889
Push back your fingers.

01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:46.789
Take down your hands please and open your eyes.

01:17:54.949 --> 01:17:57.749
Now please put both your hands towards Me.

01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:10.789
And don´t think.

01:18:15.769 --> 01:18:18.649
Now put the right hand towards Me like this.

01:18:26.029 --> 01:18:28.509
Put out your head and see for yourself

01:18:29.069 --> 01:18:35.229
if there si cool or hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:18:52.409 --> 01:18:59.329
You shouldn´t put your hand on top of your head, but away from it.

01:19:08.949 --> 01:19:10.869
Put your left hand towards Me...

01:19:12.849 --> 01:19:16.129
not on top, a bit away or you cannot feel it at all.

01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:24.669
Please put your left hand towards Me.

01:19:24.669 --> 01:19:26.849
Bend your head and see for yourself

01:19:26.969 --> 01:19:31.689
if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:19:47.789 --> 01:19:53.249
If you have not forgiven yourself or others, it will be hot.

01:19:58.469 --> 01:20:00.569
Now forgive.

01:20:02.309 --> 01:20:07.909
Lastly again, put right hand towards me, put down your head and see for yourself

01:20:08.129 --> 01:20:13.049
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:35.349
Please bend your heads.

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:44.689
Now please raise your both your hands towards the sky like this.

01:20:52.749 --> 01:20:56.389
Push back your head upward.

01:21:03.489 --> 01:21:06.609
Ask any out of these three questions three times.

01:21:17.449 --> 01:21:20.309
Please ask

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:24.709
Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:21:28.969 --> 01:21:36.289
Mother is this the All-pervading power of God´s Love?

01:21:37.689 --> 01:21:50.569
Mother, is this the Paramachaytanya? Or Ruh?

01:21:50.569 --> 01:21:55.409
Any of these questions you can ask three times.

01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:07.229
Now please take down your hands.

01:22:13.769 --> 01:22:16.169
Put your hands like this towards Me.

01:22:20.089 --> 01:22:22.809
And don´t think.

01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:28.179
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their fingertips,

01:22:29.139 --> 01:22:32.339
or on their heads, palms,

01:22:32.419 --> 01:22:36.099
or out of the fontanel bone area,

01:22:36.309 --> 01:22:39.909
please raise your hands.

01:22:58.859 --> 01:23:02.419
All of you. All of you.

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:06.879
May God bless you.

01:23:08.679 --> 01:23:10.519
Except for one or two people.
