1
00:01:20,404 --> 00:01:24,180
﻿I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:38,460
It was such a great joy for me,

3
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,735
to come to Venice to meet you again.

4
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:53,950
And I know there are many seekers in this place

5
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,770
and they are trying to seek the truth.

6
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:08,280
Without finding the truth

7
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:13,821
and without becoming that,

8
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:17,405
we cannot talk of peace.

9
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:26,308
The peace resides within us,

10
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:33,580
and the human beings who talk of peace themselves are not peaceful

11
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:41,820
and how can they bring peace,

12
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,168
when they are not in that state themselves?

13
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:55,684
To find the truth

14
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,409
we feel we have to put in some efforts,

15
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:11,568
because you are seekers and

16
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,960
you are frantically trying to find the truth

17
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,782
you go to all kinds of extremes.

18
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:32,460
You’ve been to drugs,

19
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:35,642
you’ve been to fake gurus,

20
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:40,900
you have done that whatever a human being can do.

21
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,970
But I have come to tell you,

22
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,780
you don’t have to do anything of that kind.

23
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:04,220
As you have become a human being

24
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:06,994
from the amoeba stage,

25
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:10,540
spontaneously, in the same way,

26
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,420
you become the Spirit spontaneously.

27
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:31,460
It is nothing artificial that can work it out,

28
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:37,860
or human endeavour that can bring forth the result.

29
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:51,340
The one who has created us,

30
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:57,405
has already made all the arrangements for our ascent.

31
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:09,254
With all His love and attention,

32
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:14,940
He has very delicately made all these beautiful chakras within us.

33
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:26,394
At human awareness,

34
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:29,860
we do not know what lies within us,

35
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:40,700
we do not know what organs there are in our being.

36
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:51,500
Unless and until there is pain, we do not know that they exist.

37
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:01,380
In the same way, we are not aware of these centres within us,

38
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:12,219
nor can we feel the pain of the centres within us,

39
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:20,479
because they are subtle

40
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,660
and we have to become subtler.

41
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:32,460
But by mental projection we cannot become subtler,

42
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:41,151
by projecting outside we cannot become subtler.

43
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:49,267
It’s the projection inside which will work it out.

44
00:06:55,078 --> 00:06:58,918
Now, you all are paying attention to me, but if I say,

45
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:04,259
but pay attention to yourself inside, you cannot do it.

46
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:16,643
This happening of the awakening,

47
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:19,620
of the Kundalini has to take place.

48
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:32,321
Now, this Kundalini is actually a name given to the power,

49
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:37,900
which is going to give us our Self-Realisation.

50
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,823
This is everybody’s individual mother,

51
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:54,820
because it is she that gives you your second birth.

52
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:07,020
She knows everything about you

53
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,387
and she’s anxiously waiting to sprout out

54
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:17,740
and emerge out of the last,

55
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:20,610
chakra called as Sahasrara.

56
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:34,820
This happening is real baptism, real,

57
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,720
it is not artificial.

58
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:47,014
You cannot baptise someone by just putting your hand on that person.

59
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,660
The authority has to come from the Divine,

60
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,700
for a person to baptise.

61
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:08,460
Such a person is the one who is

62
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,380
already united with the Divine.

63
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,340
Now this Divine power,

64
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,700
the power of love of God,

65
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,091
is all-pervading and everywhere.

66
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:38,540
It is described in all the great scriptures and by the great saints,

67
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,747
but we cannot feel it.

68
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:54,020
We see these flowers appearing spontaneously on a tree,

69
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,250
becoming fruits; who does that work?

70
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:07,620
Who pumps our heart?

71
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,892
Who runs our digestion?

72
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:21,940
The doctors call it “auto”: who is this “auto”?

73
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:31,361
If you call a car as “automobile”,

74
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:36,701
then who is the “auto” in the “automobile”?

75
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:43,233
Who is the driver?

76
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:50,140
The driver is the Spirit,

77
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:57,885
which watches and witnesses whatever we are doing.

78
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:06,540
And Kundalini is the one which rises

79
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,340
through the six chakras, pierces through the last one here

80
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,460
and then connects you to your Spirit,

81
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,180
to your “auto”.

82
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:34,895
She is the power of pure desire.

83
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:40,627
Now, what is our pure desire?

84
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:46,620
Some people want to have a nice house,

85
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:49,665
then they want to have a nice car,

86
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:54,544
then they want to have a helicopter, it goes on and on and on.

87
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:06,020
In general, our desires are not satiable,

88
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:17,491
so the desires so-called we have, are not the pure desires.

89
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:27,225
Unless and until when our desire is fulfilled

90
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:31,540
and we do not want anything more, that is the pure desire.

91
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:44,871
Now, this pure desire is the Kundalini

92
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:49,890
and the desire is only one: to know the Truth,

93
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:54,060
by the union with the Divine.

94
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:08,843
In the heart is reflected the God Almighty

95
00:13:09,044 --> 00:13:13,519
and Kundalini is the reflection,

96
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,125
of the Holy Ghost, the power of God,

97
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:31,500
that is the Primordial Mother reflected within us.

98
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:38,700
It’s a funny concept, to have a Father God

99
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,220
and a Son God and not a Mother God.

100
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,421
How can you have a son without a mother?

101
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:58,860
Mother is so important.

102
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:05,225
So when we say that there is a Holy Ghost,

103
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:08,131
the third thing, that is the Mother,

104
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:19,500
that is the Primordial Mother which is reflected within us as Kundalini

105
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,582
and She is the one gives us our Self-Realisation.

106
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:33,054
Now, when we are seeking the Truth,

107
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:37,000
we go with some concepts in our mind,

108
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:49,495
some concepts which have come to us from generations to generations,

109
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:59,775
and some concepts are such that we ourselves have envisaged,

110
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:02,879
we ourselves have visualised.

111
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:15,260
But concepts are all artificial.

112
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:20,998
Supposing sitting down in India,

113
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,911
I start conceiving “I am in Venice” – will I be there?

114
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:35,099
It cannot be reality.

115
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,460
It has to be a reality.

116
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:45,940
So the truth has to be known in reality.

117
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:55,053
And how do we human beings know the reality,

118
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:59,605
is through our central nervous system, through our nerves,

119
00:16:07,496 --> 00:16:10,342
not through our brains.

120
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:19,323
Now, supposing somebody says this is 
marble and somebody says this is no marble.

121
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:26,313
Looking at it, I can say it is marble

122
00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:29,744
because I come from a country of marble myself.

123
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:38,400
But ordinarily, you just place your hands and see:

124
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,593
if it is marble it will be cold, if it is plastic it won’t be cold.

125
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:55,620
So you can feel it on your central nervous system.

126
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,926
So when you get your Realisation, when you get your Kundalini,

127
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,580
pierce through your fontanel bone area,

128
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,140
then you do feel the cool breeze on your nervous system,

129
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:32,851
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,

130
00:17:36,148 --> 00:17:39,700
as we say, the cool breeze of the Adi Shakti.

131
00:17:43,838 --> 00:17:46,504
Now, the saints who talked about it

132
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:49,540
were not dishonest people.

133
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:59,627
Same about the incarnations.

134
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:07,369
But when you moulded these great saints

135
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:12,337
and incarnations into concepts, they became dead

136
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:17,035
and that’s how you find somebody’s talking about truth in the church,

137
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:22,540
another in the temple and another in the mosque.

138
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:45,820
Now, Truth cannot be many, it has to be One.

139
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:55,460
Now, in modern times,

140
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,019
thanks to Sahaja Yoga, it has evolved to such an extent,

141
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,875
that you can feel on your fingertips,

142
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:08,180
those different chakras.

143
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:21,980
There are many things which cannot
be explained in the Bible, in the Koran,

144
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,060
or in many of the Indian books.

145
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:35,379
Unless and until you are a realised soul, you cannot understand them.

146
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:45,623
Mohammed Sahib has said that at the time of resurrection,

147
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:48,340
your hands will speak.

148
00:19:55,245 --> 00:20:00,815
He has talked of resurrection much more than the doomsday,

149
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:17,378
but the people who are in charge of the religion

150
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:19,579
want to talk of the resurrection,

151
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,159
they want to talk of the doomsday
because then they can frighten people

152
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,780
and make some money out of it.

153
00:20:38,877 --> 00:20:42,315
But logically we can see that how,

154
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:45,860
the God Almighty, who is Love has created us,

155
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:50,940
would first give us doomsday and never the resurrection?

156
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:08,540
So the concept about things must be given up

157
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,060
and must be prepared like a scientist with an open mind,

158
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,340
to see the reality.

159
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:32,967
You may read any number of books,

160
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,892
you may know all the scriptures by heart,

161
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:39,884
but unless and until you are a realised soul,

162
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:43,652
you cannot catch the essence of it.

163
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:58,898
If you talk about the flower and if you talk about the honey,

164
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:03,725
one about the form, another about the formless,

165
00:22:03,926 --> 00:22:07,300
you are just talking, talking, talking.

166
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:21,460
You have to become the bee to taste the honey.

167
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:31,620
It’s all built-in within you, it’s within you, it is there.

168
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:40,051
Like a seed has all the maps,

169
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:43,380
of all its trees that are going to come out of it,

170
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,500
in a microscopic way, you too have the same thing,

171
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,578
which has to just sprout you.

172
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:07,940
But we live within two boundaries of concepts, with ego

173
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,740
and with our conditionings that we have.

174
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,312
It’s like an egg which is formed.

175
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:33,940
And for resurrection, that egg has to become, the bird.

176
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:45,820
Today the time is such that many are just ready to get it.

177
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:59,660
This is what is the second birth,

178
00:24:05,249 --> 00:24:08,859
and it works out very easily.

179
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:16,219
You don’t have to do anything about it.

180
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,140
How can you pay for it?

181
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:28,700
How much do we pay to the Mother Earth for sprouting a seed?

182
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:36,418
You cannot pay for God’s love, can you?

183
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:39,068
He doesn’t understand money.

184
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:47,907
What you have to just do is to get your Realisation,

185
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:51,195
which is “sahaja”, which is spontaneous, Sahaja,

186
00:24:51,396 --> 00:24:54,016
born with you. It’s spontaneous.

187
00:25:04,224 --> 00:25:06,427
It’s the Yoga which is,

188
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:12,092
meaning is the union with the Divine – it’s your right to have it.

189
00:25:19,157 --> 00:25:21,820
There is no other way you can have it.

190
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:27,891
Many people feel that if you do physical exercises

191
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:31,180
or something like that it is yoga: it’s a misnomer.

192
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,819
If you read Patanjali, it’s such a big book,

193
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,838
out of which only a wee bit is one part of the Ashtanga,

194
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,782
is Yama Niyama, out which a wee bit is the exercises.

195
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:10,081
Rest of it is all Samadhi yoga.

196
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,377
So the first stage you achieve is thoughtless awareness,

197
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:22,198
called as Nirvichara samadhi, when
you are aware but beyond the thought.

198
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:37,174
And when you establish it, then you go to the second stage

199
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:41,006
called as Nirvikalpa Samadhi, meaning the doubtless awareness.

200
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:43,780
Then your hands work miracles.

201
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:01,660
At that stage, you are absolutely in 
peace with yourself and with others,

202
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,700
but you emit peace,

203
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:14,540
you emit auspiciousness.

204
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:25,140
Even a glance of such an innocent personality

205
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,820
can resurrect another personality.

206
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:40,540
And in modern times it’s not difficult to achieve,

207
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:50,219
but many people do not want to believe that it is spontaneous,

208
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,860
that you don’t have to do anything about it,

209
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:05,926
It's as simple as one enlightened candle can enlighten another candle.

210
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:17,812
Only you have to work it out when
you have to maintain the candle burning.

211
00:28:23,898 --> 00:28:27,843
That also you can learn in a month’s time at the most,

212
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:34,708
and you can master it so well,

213
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:37,596
that you yourself

214
00:28:37,797 --> 00:28:41,100
can do miracles on physical,

215
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,243
mental, emotional and spiritual levels.

216
00:28:55,223 --> 00:28:58,955
You can comfort people by your touch

217
00:28:59,163 --> 00:29:02,105
in their sickness, illness,

218
00:29:03,513 --> 00:29:09,044
you can counsel them like great, knowledgeable saints.

219
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:26,420
We had so many great saints in the
whole world, they never went to any university,

220
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:34,540
but what knowledge!

221
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:40,500
So you get complete knowledge,

222
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,540
which is the knowledge of reality, pouring out of you.

223
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:58,180
You become dynamic

224
00:30:00,129 --> 00:30:05,838
and all your problems are looked after by these great angels.

225
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:11,860
All your problems are looked after by these great angels.

226
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,939
But in this country, or in the West,

227
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:28,062
people are naïve about it.

228
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:39,380
Their knowledge is that of the tree, but not of the roots.

229
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:48,350
I think the saints know more about Christ,

230
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,980
much more about Christ than who talk about Christ.

231
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:10,380
So you become the knowledge,

232
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:15,980
you become the joy and peace,

233
00:31:18,189 --> 00:31:21,100
but you become the redeemer of others.

234
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:27,812
You redeem others and evolve them.

235
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:34,694
As in the evolutionary process one fish came out,

236
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:38,820
and few came out, and then shoals of them came out,

237
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,042
in the same way, in Sahaja Yoga today,

238
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:44,757
thousands and thousands people are getting Realisation.

239
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:03,300
So only thing I have to request you just to receive

240
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:06,324
your awakening

241
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,533
and establish yourself.

242
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,018
I must say I’m very thankful to the Giunta

243
00:32:23,218 --> 00:32:26,500
which has given this hall free to us,

244
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,178
because the last time we didn’t have any proper hall,

245
00:32:30,378 --> 00:32:34,765
and I didn’t know what happened, I just could not relate myself to,

246
00:32:34,965 --> 00:32:38,152
the crowds that were there properly.

247
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:56,100
Now there is no need to ask about other people,

248
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,634
other gurus and this and that, it’s all useless just now.

249
00:33:08,581 --> 00:33:11,094
You first become your own master.

250
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:16,330
I’m not a guru, I’m a Mother

251
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:22,100
and I have come here to give what you have.

252
00:33:25,557 --> 00:33:27,780
This is all your own.

253
00:33:29,722 --> 00:33:32,780
Maybe I have to just hand over the keys to you,

254
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:39,064
so that you become your own gurus

255
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:44,706
and gurus of billions,

256
00:33:48,215 --> 00:33:51,500
but real gurus, Sat Gurus.

257
00:33:55,206 --> 00:33:57,206
May God bless you all.

258
00:33:58,612 --> 00:34:00,700
Thank you very much.

259
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:55,260
I wish we had more time,

260
00:34:55,621 --> 00:35:00,060
but today is the only day we have together

261
00:35:00,353 --> 00:35:05,820
and in this short time whatever was possible I’ve said to you.

262
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:19,870
Now, you must be having,

263
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:23,101
some of you, some problems,

264
00:35:23,302 --> 00:35:27,820
and some questions, I appreciate that.

265
00:35:34,206 --> 00:35:39,659
Now if you have any such problems
or questions, you can write them down

266
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,818
and hand them over to Jeremy here,

267
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,340
which will send it over to me.

268
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:52,113
And I’ll try to see if I can answer them or satisfy you.

269
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:11,580
But please, do not – just now I do not want to waste time in that.

270
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:19,860
Let us have our Realisation because

271
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:25,190
after the experience it’s better, to understand.

272
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:37,729
If our eyes are not open we cannot see anything,

273
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,860
and then what’s the use of argument?

274
00:36:47,511 --> 00:36:50,878
Better to open our eyes,

275
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:55,300
and then see for ourselves.

276
00:36:57,537 --> 00:37:01,620
It will take about fifteen minutes at the most.

277
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,340
I would request you that please do not leave,

278
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,900
before it is over, to disturb others,

279
00:37:13,412 --> 00:37:16,636
but if you have to leave, you can leave before that.

280
00:37:16,837 --> 00:37:22,220
It’s going to be extremely simple and easy for you.

281
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,416
There have been some funny books,

282
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:39,789
which say that Kundalini awakening is dangerous

283
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,940
and I can’t understand that.

284
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:56,713
When you were born, your mother took,

285
00:37:56,913 --> 00:38:00,719
all the responsibility and the pain upon herself.

286
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:12,059
In the same way, the Kundalini, who is your Mother

287
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:15,580
from such a long time,

288
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,132
is not going to give you any trouble whatsoever.

289
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:31,306
But you have to know that you must respect your Realisation.

290
00:38:31,506 --> 00:38:34,180
I don’t want that – please, water.

291
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:42,209
You must respect your Self.

292
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:48,145
There is no time left now to waste,

293
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:55,640
you have to enter into the Kingdom of God to enjoy life.

294
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,657
May God Bless you all.

295
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:14,497
We have to take out our shoes
because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

296
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:17,540
So just take out your shoes, not your socks.

297
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:40,739
Sit very comfortably without any asana.

298
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,420
Sit comfortably in a Sahaj asana,

299
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,780
Sahaj Asana is a spread out legs, spread out legs.

300
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,940
Not any tightening, nothing, just spread out.

301
00:39:51,324 --> 00:39:53,324
Stand up.

302
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:01,220
Sahaj asana, not to tighten.

303
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,089
Sahaj asana: Sahaj asana is spread out. Spread out.

304
00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:11,393
No restriction of the feet at all. Sahaj asana.

305
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:16,660
Ya. Be comfortable.

306
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,780
You come forward, the people who are there can come forward?

307
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,180
Yes, please, come.

308
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,500
Come along.

309
00:40:26,274 --> 00:40:27,951
Good idea.

310
00:40:28,152 --> 00:40:31,860
It’s all right, the baby will also sit down, nicely.

311
00:40:32,237 --> 00:40:34,540
Yes, sit down, sit down.

312
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:39,300
It’s all right, for her it doesn’t matter shoes or anything.

313
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:41,644
She is all right.

314
00:40:42,097 --> 00:40:44,180
She wants to take out, see?

315
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:50,088
Children understand it better.

316
00:40:50,288 --> 00:40:52,580
They are not complicated.

317
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:06,180
Now, as he has told you about the chakras,

318
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:10,895
I am going to tell you how

319
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,980
to awaken your own Kundalini.

320
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:28,180
Of course, there is no effort in it,

321
00:41:31,537 --> 00:41:35,303
but as we have to

322
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:40,140
open different centres with our own will,

323
00:41:46,064 --> 00:41:49,381
we’ll have to just put our hands

324
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:52,600
on the different centres, that’s all.

325
00:41:56,399 --> 00:42:01,380
On the left-hand we’ll work the whole thing, on the left side.

326
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:10,779
As you will learn about Sahaja
Yoga, you will know that the left hand,

327
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,288
the left hand represents

328
00:42:14,923 --> 00:42:20,419
the desire, the power of desire, not
the pure desire, but the desire power,

329
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:24,346
and the right hand represents

330
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:27,747
the power of action.

331
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:49,220
So we put our left hand like this

332
00:42:49,698 --> 00:42:52,180
on the lap, comfortably,

333
00:42:59,022 --> 00:43:01,559
and also you can,

334
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:06,260
if there is any pressure on your neck or on your waist.

335
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,856
Or if you are wearing spectacles also
you can take it out later on when I tell you.

336
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,890
Later on you will have to close your eyes completely,

337
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:33,780
because the attention has to be sucked in by the Kundalini.

338
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,260
Like my sari, you see: now, when the Kundalini rises,

339
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,300
the attention gets sucked in inside.

340
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,780
It’s spread out: it gets sucked in.

341
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:07,915
So you have to keep your eyes shut all the 
time, there’s no mesmerism here to keep eyes open.

342
00:44:15,725 --> 00:44:19,579
But before that I will tell you about the chakras.

343
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:27,780
First of all, you’ll have to put your right hand on your heart.

344
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,281
Heart.

345
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:35,723
Now, here resides your Spirit.

346
00:44:37,406 --> 00:44:42,340
Then you have to put your hand on the upper part of the abdomen,

347
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:45,100
on the left-hand side.

348
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:54,785
Then you have to put your hand in the lower part,

349
00:44:54,985 --> 00:45:00,140
of your abdomen, pressing it hard, on the left-hand side again.

350
00:45:05,793 --> 00:45:09,260
Now you have to put it back again,

351
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,086
on the upper part of your abdomen,

352
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:18,380
then on your heart.

353
00:45:20,022 --> 00:45:25,514
Then in between your left arm,

354
00:45:25,714 --> 00:45:29,820
and your neck or the shoulder, like this,

355
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,272
and turn your head to your right.

356
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:47,180
Then put your hand on your forehead like this,

357
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,780
pressing on both the sides.

358
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:00,346
Then, on the back, you have to put your head,

359
00:46:00,546 --> 00:46:04,859
resting on your hand like this, just for a short time.

360
00:46:11,806 --> 00:46:14,220
Then you have to stretch your hand

361
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,060
and put your palm, the centre of your palm,

362
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,770
on top of the fontanel bone area,

363
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:24,100
stretching your fingers tight.

364
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,420
You have to move your scalp,

365
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,274
in such a way, slowly and slowly.

366
00:46:30,474 --> 00:46:34,340
This hand, like that, spread it, the centre of it here,

367
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:39,572
and try to move your scalp slowly, slowly, seven times.

368
00:46:56,254 --> 00:47:00,500
That’s all, it’s very simple.

369
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:05,358
So, now, all of you should just remember one thing,

370
00:47:05,558 --> 00:47:09,860
that we are all going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

371
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:20,705
And this is what we have been working out for ages

372
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:24,614
and the time has come this moment to do that.

373
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:38,219
We should have no guilt about ourselves,

374
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:44,620
we have done nothing wrong whatsoever.

375
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:56,380
On the contrary, we should be very pleasantly placed towards us.

376
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:06,300
Not to be frivolous, but not to be serious either

377
00:48:14,372 --> 00:48:16,683
– in a very joyous mood.

378
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,379
Now, please put the left hand towards me

379
00:48:23,835 --> 00:48:26,540
and please close your eyes.

380
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,580
Close your eyes please,

381
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,818
and put the right hand on your heart.

382
00:48:45,545 --> 00:48:47,900
Now keep your eyes shut

383
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,620
and do not open till I tell you.

384
00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:01,386
Now, at this point you have to ask me a very,

385
00:49:01,586 --> 00:49:03,771
fundamental question.

386
00:49:03,972 --> 00:49:08,202
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji,

387
00:49:08,402 --> 00:49:10,420
whatever is convenient.

388
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,495
Say, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

389
00:49:14,695 --> 00:49:17,540
Ask this fundamental question three times.

390
00:49:35,212 --> 00:49:37,060
Three times, please.

391
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:46,893
Now the second question comes in.

392
00:49:47,093 --> 00:49:50,380
If you are the Spirit you are your master too,

393
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,260
so now put the right hand on,

394
00:49:53,628 --> 00:49:57,740
the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

395
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:18,220
Left hand towards me, on the lap.

396
00:50:21,128 --> 00:50:24,740
Now here you ask me again a question three times:

397
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,780
“Mother, am I my own master?

398
00:50:29,713 --> 00:50:32,540
Mother, am I my own guru?

399
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,740
Mother, am I my own guide?”

400
00:50:57,864 --> 00:50:59,457
Now,

401
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:06,980
please, put this right hand,

402
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,300
in the lower part of your abdomen

403
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:15,934
on the left-hand side and press it hard.

404
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:22,420
Here you ask,

405
00:51:25,044 --> 00:51:28,540
for the knowledge,

406
00:51:29,206 --> 00:51:33,340
because I cannot force you,

407
00:51:34,632 --> 00:51:36,632
it is,

408
00:51:37,964 --> 00:51:40,940
your freedom which I respect,

409
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,980
so you have to ask:

410
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,380
“Mother, give me the true knowledge,

411
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,820
of Divine laws,

412
00:51:50,056 --> 00:51:53,340
Mother, give me the pure knowledge.”

413
00:51:55,205 --> 00:51:59,972
This you have to say six times: “Mother, give me the pure knowledge”.

414
00:52:00,172 --> 00:52:03,940
You have to say, I cannot force on you.

415
00:52:32,551 --> 00:52:34,263
Six times.

416
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:46,100
Goes up in the Swadishthana, you see.

417
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:53,839
When you say that, now the Kundalini has started moving.

418
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,540
But you do not feel guilty or diffident at all.

419
00:53:08,907 --> 00:53:10,907
With confidence,

420
00:53:11,611 --> 00:53:14,192
you now put your right hand,

421
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,020
in the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side, please.

422
00:53:29,341 --> 00:53:32,260
Now here, with full confidence,

423
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,264
to open this centre of this,

424
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:41,257
Master principle or Guru principle you have to say,

425
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:46,340
with full confidence, ten times:

426
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,371
“Mother, I am my own master.”

427
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,980
Right Swadishthana.

428
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:18,264
Good. Good.

429
00:54:18,973 --> 00:54:21,140
Better? Warren: … Better.

430
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:36,010
Shri Mataji: Better, too.

431
00:54:41,438 --> 00:54:45,300
Now, please, raise,

432
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:50,027
your right hand again onto your heart.

433
00:54:50,256 --> 00:54:52,901
It seems like this Swadishthana is better.

434
00:55:08,324 --> 00:55:13,539
Here you have to say, again with full confidence,

435
00:55:13,747 --> 00:55:17,100
the greatest truth about yourself:

436
00:55:18,247 --> 00:55:22,484
“Mother, I am the Spirit”.

437
00:55:22,684 --> 00:55:27,860
Say it twelve times, because there
are twelve petals to the heart centre.

438
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:32,140
“Mother, I am the Spirit”.

439
00:55:52,107 --> 00:55:53,580
Better.

440
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:22,060
Now. Twelve times, please.

441
00:56:34,984 --> 00:56:37,205
The doors must be open here.

442
00:56:37,405 --> 00:56:41,900
Ah, done. Good. Yes.

443
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:51,954
Now I have to tell you that

444
00:56:52,154 --> 00:56:57,660
God Almighty is the ocean of love

445
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,215
and ocean of compassion.

446
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:06,593
But above all, He is the ocean of forgiveness.

447
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:25,171
And you cannot do anything that cannot be engulfed

448
00:57:25,372 --> 00:57:28,206
by this ocean of forgiveness.

449
00:57:36,714 --> 00:57:39,406
So now please forgive yourself

450
00:57:43,995 --> 00:57:46,780
and forget about the past things.

451
00:57:50,399 --> 00:57:52,251
Be cheerful.

452
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:57,096
Now put your right hand,

453
00:57:57,297 --> 00:57:59,980
in the corner,

454
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:04,300
made by your neck and the left shoulder,

455
00:58:04,658 --> 00:58:08,923
from the front side, not from the back. Don’t take the hand to the back.

456
00:58:17,397 --> 00:58:20,278
From the front side, don’t take it backwards side.

457
00:58:20,478 --> 00:58:23,252
No, no, from the front side, you see, across,

458
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,340
take it across, right hand across.

459
00:58:32,521 --> 00:58:35,402
Take it on the back

460
00:58:35,602 --> 00:58:40,437
and now put your head towards the right,

461
00:58:41,062 --> 00:58:43,340
turn your neck towards the right.

462
00:58:46,642 --> 00:58:50,315
Hold it tight. This is the centre catching today mostly,

463
00:58:50,515 --> 00:58:53,852
because we feel guilty for nothing at all.

464
00:58:59,665 --> 00:59:03,374
So please sixteen times, please say:

465
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:06,220
“Mother, I am not guilty”.

466
00:59:30,061 --> 00:59:31,944
Better.

467
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:40,740
Sixteen times and, even now if you are feeling guilty,

468
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:45,020
then you’d better punish yourselves
by saying hundred and eight times!

469
00:59:46,055 --> 00:59:48,740
There’s nothing to feel guilty at all.

470
01:00:04,007 --> 01:00:05,592
Better.

471
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:11,180
It’s yours Warren, left Nabhi is yours.

472
01:00:11,613 --> 01:00:13,700
It’s not there anymore.

473
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,907
Gone up.

474
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:22,976
Better?

475
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,390
Now,

476
01:00:32,959 --> 01:00:37,420
put your hand on top of your forehead across.

477
01:00:42,979 --> 01:00:46,380
Now here, not how many times

478
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:52,060
but from the heart you have to say: “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

479
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:54,860
This is the centre of Christ.

480
01:01:03,925 --> 01:01:07,362
Now we think that it’s very difficult,

481
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,201
but it’s a myth.

482
01:01:09,402 --> 01:01:13,271
We do not do anything when we forgive and when we don’t forgive,

483
01:01:13,472 --> 01:01:18,805
but when we forgive at least we 
don’t play into the hands of wrong people.

484
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:51,220
Now put your hand on the back of your head

485
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,726
and push your head backwards.

486
01:01:53,926 --> 01:01:57,660
Now here, for your own satisfaction you can say:

487
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:01,395
“Oh Divine, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong”:

488
01:02:01,595 --> 01:02:04,380
for your satisfaction, but don’t feel guilty.

489
01:02:26,621 --> 01:02:29,948
Now put your hand,

490
01:02:30,186 --> 01:02:33,091
stretch your palm,

491
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:37,900
right hand, on top your head, by stretching your hand,

492
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:42,900
the centre of it falling on the centre of the fontanel bone area.

493
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:46,860
Press it hard and move it seven times.

494
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:09,732
And here you have to say seven times,

495
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:15,257
because I respect your freedom, that you want your Self-Realisation:

496
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:19,129
“Mother, please grant us Self-Realisation”.

497
01:03:19,336 --> 01:03:24,707
I cannot force it on you, I’m sorry, 
so you have to ask for it seven times.

498
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:16,978
Now, take down your hands please.

499
01:04:20,522 --> 01:04:23,860
Please open your eyes slowly.

500
01:04:27,013 --> 01:04:29,251
Put both the hands like this.

501
01:04:33,312 --> 01:04:36,220
Now watch me without thinking.

502
01:04:41,134 --> 01:04:45,155
Put your left hand on top of your head,

503
01:04:45,355 --> 01:04:48,820
about two – three inches above.

504
01:04:50,267 --> 01:04:52,128
Left hand, left hand.

505
01:04:54,521 --> 01:04:56,780
Right hand towards me like this.

506
01:04:59,892 --> 01:05:01,700
Little higher,

507
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:06,140
Little higher. Sometimes it can be very high also with some people.

508
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:13,555
Like this, like this. The other should be like this.

509
01:05:17,562 --> 01:05:19,916
Do you feel the cool breeze?

510
01:05:24,705 --> 01:05:29,165
Now put the left hand towards me, and put the right hand and see,

511
01:05:29,366 --> 01:05:31,406
on top of your head.

512
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:41,020
On top of your head.

513
01:05:45,014 --> 01:05:47,260
Again put the right hand towards me please,

514
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:51,435
and see on the left-hand side. This is just to balance.

515
01:05:55,947 --> 01:05:58,460
Good. It’s better.

516
01:06:02,055 --> 01:06:05,777
Now you put both your hands to the sky, and push back your head

517
01:06:05,977 --> 01:06:09,663
and ask a question: “Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”,

518
01:06:15,249 --> 01:06:19,407
“Is this the all-pervading Power of God?”,

519
01:06:22,621 --> 01:06:24,980
“Is this the Brahma?”

520
01:06:26,098 --> 01:06:29,858
Ask the question three times. Push back your head.

521
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:35,011
Push back your heads.

522
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:40,297
Now bring down your hands. Please bring down your hands.

523
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:46,412
Now see, in your hands do you feel the cool breeze?

524
01:06:47,866 --> 01:06:51,620
Be patient with yourself, it would be there. Just feel it.

525
01:06:55,635 --> 01:06:57,973
Feel the silence within.

526
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:06,840
You’ll feel like laughing, some of you.

527
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:18,288
Those who have felt the cool breeze on their head

528
01:07:18,488 --> 01:07:22,260
or in their hands please raise both your hands.

529
01:07:31,943 --> 01:07:34,060
Or on your head either.

530
01:07:35,845 --> 01:07:40,300
It’s quite a lot of people have felt on
 the first day. And everybody can feel it.

531
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,291
It’s very simple, Everybody can feel it.

532
01:07:44,491 --> 01:07:49,273
Those who have not felt can sit for 
one minute like that, let’s see. Just see.

533
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:53,413
Without thinking. Just watch me without thinking.

534
01:08:03,259 --> 01:08:06,153
I think you all have not forgiven.

535
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:12,803
Just forgive and it will work out.
Just forgive, the pressure is of not forgiving.

536
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:36,080
Now let us see how many have felt it in 
their head or in the hands, both the hands up.

537
01:08:46,245 --> 01:08:50,740
Yes. Some of you who didn’t feel are feeling now.

538
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,604
It’s good!

539
01:08:55,142 --> 01:08:58,540
Now don’t discuss about it, don’t talk about it.

540
01:09:04,582 --> 01:09:06,897
They are going to have follow-on?

541
01:09:17,813 --> 01:09:20,531
All those who have not felt it should also come,

542
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:25,940
they are more there, and those who 
have felt should also come and get it up,

543
01:09:37,851 --> 01:09:39,580
because,

544
01:09:47,536 --> 01:09:50,909
because you have been seeking for ages now.

545
01:09:56,748 --> 01:09:58,970
Thank you very much.

546
01:11:01,996 --> 01:11:04,863
If they want to shake hands, they can come.

547
01:11:06,202 --> 01:11:09,069
If they want to shake hands, they can come.

548
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:21,683
Oh, you are all right, you are all right.

549
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,643
Keep it up, keep it up.

550
01:11:38,667 --> 01:11:40,723
You’re from where?
