00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.080
The music was very fine and elevating to all of you.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.760
The effect of music in Sahaja Yoga is tremendous,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.680
and if a Sahaja Yogi sings the song

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.760
it's so great that it acts like a mantra upon My being.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.000
So I'm very thankful to Mrs. Venogopalan

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.280
for singing such a beautiful song today. It stirred Me completely.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.320
Then Gavin Brown was very sweet. He's an Englishman, very gentle

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.160
and a very steady Sahaja Yogi.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.920
He's one of the first Western Sahaja Yogis I met.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.560
Today I will tell you about the Nabhi Chakra which deals

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.400
with this honesty of seeking.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.040
Nabhi Chakra is the center which controls

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.720
or manifests outside in the gross as

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.200
Solar Plexus. Nabhi Chakra has two sides: one is the left,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.720
another the right, and one in the center.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.520
So on the left hand side is the Gruha Lakshmi,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.440
on the right hand side is the Raja Lakshmi or Gaja Lakshmi

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.960
and in the center is the Lakshmi which ascends into Mahalakshmi.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.480
When the seeking starts,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.440
a human being first starts seeking food.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.800
Food is very important for all the animals.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.880
If they have no food

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.440
then they cannot exist.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.640
So the seeking starts with food,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.560
and when the shelter is sought, they try to find the water.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.960
So this center is made of water

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:18.320
and in this center resides the Deity of Shri Vishnu or Narayana;

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.680
and His power, as I told you, is Lakshmi and then Mahalakshmi.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.120
You will find out in Sahaja Yoga

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.960
that gradually you start developing one power and then the other.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.000
Everyone who comes to Sahaja Yoga, if they are truthful

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.520
and not involved with any wrong things,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.200
then definitely they are helped in Lakshmi Tattwa,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.320
means their well-being is looked after.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.480
As Krishna has said, "yogakshema vahaamya."

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.440
So He looks after the kshema part of it.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.560
Everyone who has been to Sahaja Yoga

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.720
has been helped miraculously

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.400
also in the Lakshmi Tattwa, that means materially.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.640
In so many ways they are helped,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.120
that one has to just see for themselves

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.520
how these miracles take place.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:38.720
An example is of a villager who had a small little holding of land

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.560
and he was living hand to mouth every day.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.960
When he came to Me, after some time I found

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.960
he would bring one garland,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.640
big garland, for Me every evening.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.040
And he was away in the village every day he would attend My program.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.840
I was quite surprised that how could he afford it, and I asked him,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.680
"How can you afford a garland for Me every day?

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.560
You shouldn't bring it, it's not proper."

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.520
So he said, "Mother, You know everything."

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.160
I said, "Why, what happened?"

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.120
He said, "I have a plot of land next to mine

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.760
which we never used because it was absolutely a barren land -

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.840
little bit, not much big land, but a small land, piece of land.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.800
And after Realization I used to always go

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.240
walk over it bare feet to plough this little

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.680
piece of land that I had.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.080
After some time when I was coming here after that,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.720
one gentleman came to see me and he said that

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.080
“This piece of land that you have is very precious.“

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.320
I said, “What's the problem?” He said that

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:05.960
“I have a kiln of bricks, and I have seen that even

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:14.200
by chance – Sahaja - we mixed a little clay from this soil,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.320
from this part of the land that you have,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.480
and we found that our bricks have become so good and so strong

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.480
that we would like to purchase this clay from you

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.200
at the price of seers."

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.520
And that's how he started getting money sufficient for him

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.960
and he became much better off.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.320
But in Sahaja Yoga one has to remember you don't go to extremes,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.000
in any principle.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.640
That is one thing people should know, that you don't go to extremes.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.360
You don't become extremely rich.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.880
I've seen those people who are extremely rich,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.520
when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they are a big headache,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.280
very big headache.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.440
If they are sick, if you cure them of their heart trouble,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.520
then they try to possess you.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.960
They will get all the heart patients, they will get

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.800
all kinds of patients to you,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.760
you go on tolerating it, they try to possess you.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.120
They immediately start talking about their cures

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.040
to everyone, they publish in papers, this thing, that thing,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.880
it's impossible. And they just try to overpower you.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.880
Without any appointment they'll arrive

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.840
and they would expect you to attend to them immediately,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.800
it's terrible.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.080
And then they’ll send all their relations for cure

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.960
and you have to show all patience,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.120
all their friends, they become like agents.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.720
All their patients, all their relations, all their friends,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.360
they want to oblige them and spare

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.480
no love, no affection, nothing further.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.280
The Sahaja Yogis, if they try

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.240
to say that “No, you shouldn't do like that and all that,"

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.200
they feel insulted.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.920
And they all try curing much faster

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.480
than anybody else does.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.680
They themselves are weak, they are sick people themselves,

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.800
heart patient, this patient, that,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.400
but if you tell them, “Don't cure,” they'll feel bad.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.080
If you don't tell them, they'll get sick

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.120
and you'll have another problem.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.480
They never try to understand Sahaja Yoga in it's big way.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:41.080
They just want to see it according to their own way of ego

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.360
that they have accumulated with their money,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.320
and they never know how they go on hurting

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.320
everyone by overpowering Me all the time.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.520
It's very amazing, whenever I cure a rich man,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.640
I've been wanting to run away from that person.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.120
I would never go to their house, I would not like to eat in their house.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.360
It's a very bad thing.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.520
So too much of riches is also not okay

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.920
because it gives you a tremendous

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.680
ego that you don't see yourself,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.440
and anybody tries to say anything protect oneself,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.720
then such a person feels insulted or humiliated.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.680
Not only that, but they try to hold Me and hold the whole thing

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.600
according to their business ways which is impossible.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.200
See, they have to gain money,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.680
they have another attitude because they are miserly.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.960
I don't have to earn money or anything.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:50.320
If I am doing anything, I’m, really, in a way, I'm obliging. Isn't it?

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.760
But they will force on Me all their rules and regulations, everything,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.480
without having their own discipline.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.320
So very rich people in Sahaja Yoga

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.640
so far have been extremely troublesome,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.120
I should say, to Me and to the whole organization.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.640
They are very narrow-minded.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:15.280
They cannot see the big vision that I have before Me.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.560
Whatever little ideas they have about themselves and about their

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.200
own thinking, reading, they will try to push onto Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.040
It's not My experience once, but many a times.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.920
Then somehow or other it so happens that they drop out.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.720
So, too much richness gives you a tremendous ego, worse than

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.560
even, I would say, a bulldog.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.040
It’s impossible for a rich man to see

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.160
that all these riches are outside him. They are not inside him.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.360
He has to be rich in heart to understand compassion.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.840
Compassion doesn't mean that you give alms to others,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.600
or if you give money to others, it's not that.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.680
On the contrary, you just have beggars by doing that.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.640
Compassion is that works,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.920
compassion is that flows,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.200
compassion is that manifests.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.960
It is not in compassion where you can make it materialize it,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.320
“All right, come along I'll give you a hundred rupees.”

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.160
On the contrary, giving somebody a hundred rupees is the worst thing.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.960
I have tried this with some Sahaja Yogis who were with Me.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.600
I tried to give them some money some time as they were very poor.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.280
They became horrid.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.720
Some of them started drinking,

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.200
some of them took to some other ways and they became

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.880
sort of addicted to money. It was impossible.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.960
And they tried to spoil as many Sahaj Yogis as they could.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.400
So such people if they come, it's impossible to manage them.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.840
They are not Sahaja Yogis because they are asahaja.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.440
They are still sticking to the idea that they have so much money,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.080
that they are so rich and they can overpower everyone with money.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.360
Not Me, I'm sorry.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.160
But only thing I feel sorry for them

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.400
that they cannot get to God.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.600
There is no honesty of seeking in them,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.640
there is no honesty of seeking.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.760
The elite people whom I have addressed

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.360
so many places like this, because

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.480
some people whom I have cured wanted Me to address the elite,

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.160
so-called. I think they are elated, to Me what they are.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.320
They don't want to be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.760
They are already eliminated, I sometimes feel.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.880
Thousands of them I've addressed, I've wasted My time with them.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.080
They are good for nothing, absolutely empty people.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.760
They are very happy because they have a few cars,

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.640
or some houses or something like that.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.600
I too have all these things, I would say so-called riches.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.960
I have always seen from My father's side

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.120
and from My husband's side.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.360
I don't understand what is there to be proud of this emptiness.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.760
But human beings are such,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.600
a empty vessel makes a big sound,

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.200
in the same way, an empty rich man makes a very big sound.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.920
Not that the very poor are also good,

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.200
because those who are extremely poor

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.680
are busy with their food problems.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.920
They have little, little problems and their values are still have to

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.600
come up to a point.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.240
It's only in the middle you can work out Sahaja Yoga better.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.840
Those who are extremely rich and proud

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.880
cannot come to Sahaja Yoga easily.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.480
Those who are very poor also cannot come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:16.760
But when this middle part of the river is enriched

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.480
and starts flowing well, then it spreads on the sides

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.280
and then it can engulf.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.320
But you cannot  start it the other way round. I have tried.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.360
I have tried both ways and I have told you what happened.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.200
Whom I gave money,

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.880
whom I tried to help through giving money

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.680
became wayward, useless, frivolous people,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.560
got lost to Sahaja Yoga. And those whom

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.560
I thought were moneyed and satisfied people

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.920
had another role to play is to possess Me all the time,

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.720
to use Me all the time whenever they wanted,

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.280
for whatever purpose they wanted to use Me.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.760
And they must know, you cannot possess Me, you cannot possess Me,

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.600
but this kind of an ignorance still in their minds

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.680
is that they can possess God, they can possess everyone.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:16.920
For such people there are no reasons

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.240
to come to Sahaja Yoga, to be very frank.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.200
And even if they come to Sahaja Yog

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.080
they have to know that for Mother richness of heart,

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.680
understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.440
humility, non-possessiveness are very important.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.760
In this ascent of yours,

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.960
money is not important at all.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.520
Even if you are poor or rich, you get your Realization.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:59.280
For example, I went to Maharashtra, most of them are,

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.480
I would say, very poor people in the sense that

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.160
they are not middle class at all. They are not educated,

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.720
they are sometimes factory workers

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:17.480
or they have small holdings. Not very rich.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.800
But they are very good Sahaja Yogis, excellent Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.960
They have such beautiful eyes

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.640
and such beautiful feeling and such compassion

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:37.160
that Lakshmi Tattwa is absolutely balanced in them.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.360
You know that Lakshmi is shown to be a lady,

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.560
and lady who is a mother.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.400
Mother doesn't care whether you are rich or poor.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.960
If her one son is rich and another is poor,

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.680
she'll pay more attention to the poor and ask the rich

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.720
to give his money to the poor also.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.280
She is not bothered. If somebody is in need,

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.760
she will be the first to help the person who needs.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.440
Now this is a spiritual thing in the spiritual life.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.520
The person who is a real seeker,

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:20.080
who is a truthful seeker, the Mother will go out of the way

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.480
to be with that person. And those who are not honest about it,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.640
Mother will try somehow or other cut them short.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:39.520
The problem that lies with human beings is

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.600
that they do not know what they want.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.000
They think they want first of all money.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.840
But those who have money,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.480
they think they must have power.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.760
If they have too much money, they think that they must go into politics

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.760
because they have had no power.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.480
Then they fail in politics,

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.720
or say they become too much in politics, whatever it is,

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.560
then they want love from their children which they can't get,

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.520
because they are too busy or something like that.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.920
So they don't know what they want.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.440
Those who believe that by having money will be better off,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.280
should listen to all these people who have come from affluent countries

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.400
and they will tell you how things have gone wrong there,

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.920
how people are ruined, what's going wrong with them,

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.760
absolutely they are in a bad shape.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.320
You cannot call them human beings

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.760
because they are so cruel, they kill even their own children,

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.640
and that society tolerates such people.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.520
In India if you hear somebody killing a child,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.880
I have never heard so far in the sixty years of My life,

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.120
but supposing you hear someone has killed his daughter or son,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.560
nobody will ever look at that person.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.680
He will not be allowed in the society, nobody will even

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.720
give any girl in the marriage to

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.840
his daughter or a son. He'll be absolutely barred from the society.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:11.080
No one can think of such a relationship between children and parents.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.600
And then there are funny relationships also,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.240
it's something so absurd,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.840
on both the sides on cruelty and on morality,

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.800
they are so absurd, it's impossible to understand.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.640
So money has given this ego and they say, “What's wrong?

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.840
What’s wrong?” It's absolutely malignant attitude.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.880
When you say, “What's wrong?” that means

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.800
you do not want to keep your relationship with the whole.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.240
You do not want to keep your relationship

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:48.960
with the Primordial One, the One who has you,

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.600
everyone within Himself. You are part and parcel of the whole,

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.680
and how can you say, “What's wrong? I do what I like.”

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.840
You just become like a malignant cell.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.320
So at the Nabhi Chakra one has to know

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.360
that one should not hanker after money too much.
