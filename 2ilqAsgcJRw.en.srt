1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It is really gratifying

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
to come to Melbourne

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,679
I came here

4
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:11,602
because somebody who had come to Sydney

5
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:16,896
and said that "Mother, you must come to Melbourne.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,026
We need you."

7
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:24,623
When I came here for some other purpose,

8
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:31,103
I felt vibrations of Melbourne

9
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:33,917
are really very good,

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,440
and here it is quite possible

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,790
that there maybe many seekers.

12
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,012
It is really gratifying as I said

13
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:49,706
to be here among you.

14
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:55,844
It's a fact that the time has come

15
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:58,690
for thousands and thousands and thousands

16
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,976
and millions of them

17
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:05,103
who are born as seekers on this earth,

18
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:09,425
have to get their Realisation.

19
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:13,699
They have to know their meaning.

20
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,370
They have to know why

21
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:21,628
why the nature has made them a human being from amoeba.

22
00:01:22,962 --> 00:01:24,962
What is the purpose of their life?

23
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:28,595
Unless and until you find the purpose of your life

24
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,988
you are not going to be happy.

25
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,830
You are not going to be satisfied.

26
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:35,666
You may try anything else.

27
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:38,317
You may have one of those ego trips;

28
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:43,190
you may have other trips like seeking money.

29
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:49,028
You may have other things like going to drugs,

30
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,510
alcoholism,

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,923
livercation, all kinds of things.

32
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,723
But these things have not given any satisfaction,

33
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:00,885
to anyone.

34
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:05,693
You have to find out that Absolute,

35
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,241
without which we are in confusion.

36
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:13,835
That Absolute is within you.

37
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:18,081
That's why Sahaja Yoga

38
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:21,491
is as spontaneous thing, is a living thing.

39
00:02:22,354 --> 00:02:24,657
"Saha" means with, "Ja" means born.

40
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:26,577
It is born with you,

41
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:28,564
as in a seed

42
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:32,240
all the maps of the seed that is going to manifest

43
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:36,157
are built-in.

44
00:02:36,315 --> 00:02:38,315
In the same way within you,

45
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:44,280
your Spirit and your Kundalini

46
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:49,035
are all already existing there

47
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:52,028
and they are just waiting for a chance

48
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:55,618
to give you your Self-Realisation.

49
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:04,388
Before telling you about the benefits of Self-Realisation,

50
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:09,569
I have to tell you that you must keep your minds open

51
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,191
as you would for any science lecture or any other lecture.

52
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,447
There's no jugglery

53
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:25,107
or there is no shopping, guru shopping in Sahaja Yoga.

54
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:28,971
It is a happening, it’s an actualisation.

55
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,108
It is within you. It’s a living force,

56
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:38,348
like a flower becomes a fruit

57
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:42,720
or an egg becomes a chick,

58
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:47,619
you get your Realisation and you become a different personality,

59
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:51,362
a new dimension of awareness grows into you

60
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:55,223
and this new dimension of awareness

61
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:56,695
is an actualisation,

62
00:03:57,024 --> 00:04:00,645
it's not just a mere words

63
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:04,717
or any kind of a brainwashing.

64
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,225
It is an actualisation within you,

65
00:04:10,178 --> 00:04:12,801
which happens by which

66
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,301
you start feeling

67
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,801
the collective consciousness.

68
00:04:18,835 --> 00:04:22,341
You are a part and parcel of the whole,

69
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,655
so many have said it.

70
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:26,376
We also believe in it

71
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:28,753
that we are the part and parcel of the whole,

72
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:31,682
but so far in our awareness,

73
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:35,269
in our central nervous system, we have not felt that.

74
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:40,827
So this is actually should happen to you.

75
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:48,222
In this we have to accept,

76
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:54,025
whatever is nourishing for our growth, after Realisation.

77
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,082
Gradually you started accepting it

78
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:00,582
and I'll tell you why it happens

79
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:04,947
but the thing is in Sydney I found

80
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:08,567
that people are extremely honest about their seeking

81
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,983
and they really appreciated my honesty.

82
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,667
This is a process

83
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,275
which was built in since long within us.

84
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:23,871
Here that you see different chakras.

85
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,471
Are placed.

86
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,385
Can you see? All right.

87
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:37,130
These centres are placed within

88
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:40,109
the human beings

89
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:44,108
and they exist at subtle centers

90
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,742
in the spinal cord and in the brain.

91
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:53,970
These are called in Sanskrit language as chakras.

92
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:58,523
These centres exist within us

93
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,677
as milestones of our evolution.

94
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:04,615
For example, the lowest chakra

95
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,115
called as the Mooladdhara chakra,

96
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,615
is the center,

97
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:15,643
at that point we were carbon atoms. We were matter.

98
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:22,424
At that point we were innocent. Matter is innocent.

99
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,586
So the first thing that was created within us was innocence.

100
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:31,515
This whole universe was created

101
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:35,037
after innocence was created.

102
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
This chakra is placed

103
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,034
below the Kundalini, if you see it clearly.

104
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:47,468
Kundalini is the pure power of desire.

105
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:50,315
Pure power of desire.

106
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:53,017
Whatever is pure we call it Holy.

107
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:57,605
Is the Holy power of desire,

108
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:00,963
which remains

109
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,850
dormant.

110
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:12,022
This power is the desire

111
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:15,455
to be one with the Spirit.

112
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:20,238
Without knowing the Spirit, you cannot know God.

113
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,346
You are to be input to the mains.

114
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:27,229
You are not yet put to the mains.

115
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:29,437
For example, this instrument that we have made

116
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:32,876
if it is not put to the mains, it has no meaning.

117
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,288
So that has to happen.

118
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:38,788
It's like the primule in the seed,

119
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,905
a germinating power

120
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:42,473
in the seed,

121
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:46,087
that you have got this power, residual power

122
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,899
sleeping

123
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,581
waiting for a moment

124
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:52,246
when somebody

125
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:55,259
who is authorised by the Divine

126
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:56,354
and not

127
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:59,164
by any organization or certificates

128
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,869
that human beings give.

129
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:05,618
But somebody, who himself is a Realised soul,

130
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:07,954
as an enlightened person

131
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,454
and he knows

132
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:13,652
what is this power is,

133
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:18,506
it waits for such a personality

134
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,900
and then it awakens itself

135
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,035
and you get your Self-Realisation.

136
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
It has to be spontaneous

137
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,132
everything vital in life has to be spontaneous.

138
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:39,345
The breathing that we have

139
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:43,609
is so spontaneously going on

140
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:48,196
that we take it for granted till it stops, or till we feel

141
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:51,051
that we cannot breathe.

142
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,157
If you have to go and read books,

143
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:58,881
or putting some efforts to breathe,

144
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:03,598
then how many of us could

145
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:06,616
even exist for more than

146
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,481
say five minutes?

147
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:13,404
It is so vital

148
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:16,256
is the culmination of our evolution

149
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:22,296
and as the whole creation was created by the Divine,

150
00:09:23,453 --> 00:09:26,509
as you are also created by the Divine,

151
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:31,428
this great happening is to be done by the Divine.

152
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:37,213
Now some people asked me

153
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:40,433
that can it not happen by itself to us.

154
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:46,198
We do not know that at every stage of our evolution

155
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:50,167
some aspect of God had to incarnate

156
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:53,893
or some guidance had to come from the Divine,

157
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:59,824
to give us a higher awareness.

158
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,350
But specially at this time

159
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,080
it is very important

160
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:07,409
that somebody has to do it

161
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:11,130
because you have reached a stage where,

162
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:15,984
you have to know it in words,

163
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:19,045
and Divine had to speak.

164
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:26,456
It's a very common question that in,

165
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:28,465
I think people are ego orientated,

166
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:31,574
they said, "Why you Mother?" I said you better be there!

167
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:35,043
I’ll be very happy if you could do it

168
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:39,180
because I am a happily married woman,

169
00:10:39,894 --> 00:10:41,894
I don't need anything from anyone,

170
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:44,394
I have to just give

171
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:50,447
but if you can do my work, I will be very happy to retire.

172
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:55,744
It's very easy to say, "why you?" I mean you should ask

173
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:58,271
God why He gave me these powers?

174
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,160
But they are there,

175
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:05,331
but one need not feel hurt about it so much also.

176
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,282
After all you have some many powers which I don't have.

177
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:10,782
For example, I don't know how to drive,

178
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:12,364
really I don't know.

179
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:13,870
I don’t know many things,

180
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:16,626
even I don't know how to open ordinary cans

181
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:19,965
but if I know how to open the Kundalini

182
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:22,684
why should it hurt your ego?

183
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:25,574
And why should you feel bad

184
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,485
because I have to really work day in day out.

185
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:32,396
To do this work,

186
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,529
it’s something just a gift to you.

187
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,810
There is no shopping;

188
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:40,091
you can't pay for it.

189
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:41,831
It is beyond,

190
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:44,818
your control.

191
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:50,459
To conceive God, you have to see, as the reality is.

192
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:53,640
You have to give up your conceptions.

193
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:56,819
Supposing I had conceived a hall

194
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,319
before seeing this,

195
00:11:59,478 --> 00:12:01,478
I would have had funny ideas

196
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:03,642
but after seeing it

197
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,570
only I really know what it is.

198
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:08,559
In the same way

199
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:10,363
people have written books,

200
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:13,033
thousands of books they have written

201
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,163
or even millions of books they have written, so what to do?

202
00:12:17,223 --> 00:12:18,544
If they have written the books,

203
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:21,309
have they given you any Self-Realisation?

204
00:12:23,852 --> 00:12:26,445
Have they given you that experience

205
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:29,490
of the absolute by which you know yourself,

206
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,985
you know your centres and you know the centre of others

207
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:36,217
and you start manifesting your own powers.

208
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:39,911
You become the master of your powers.

209
00:12:42,698 --> 00:12:47,110
This is what should be the criteria of your seeking.

210
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:52,825
Why should you be identified with anything else but yourself?

211
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:55,633
Because I get people

212
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:57,940
belonging to this cult or this group

213
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:00,002
or this religion or this and that.

214
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,184
But you must understand

215
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,684
that you are not here

216
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,916
to be pleader for any one of them.

217
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:13,102
I mean you pay them to be their pleader

218
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,411
or to be their lawyers or solicitors, whatever you may call it.

219
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:24,442
But you should really try to honestly seek the truth

220
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:26,653
and ask for this truth

221
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:29,028
and then only you will get the truth.

222
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
So first thing one should understand

223
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:34,952
that you cannot purchase Divine.

224
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:38,058
You cannot pay for it, it is an insult,

225
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,796
it is an insult.

226
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:46,048
And secondly you cannot put in effort for that.

227
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:48,352
When you have to sprout a seed

228
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:50,365
what do you do? You put it in the Mother Earth,

229
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,381
and she sprouts by itself spontaneously.

230
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,598
It has got that force in it,

231
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,859
only you have to put it to the Mother Earth.

232
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:01,410
And the Mother Earth by her warmth

233
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,910
germinates the seed.

234
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:07,240
Do you get angry with the Mother Earth for that,

235
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:08,885
that, why must you do that?

236
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:13,357
If she has to do it, she has to do it.

237
00:14:13,857 --> 00:14:16,077
Whatever the sun has to do has to do,

238
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:18,577
and whatever you have to do, you can do

239
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:20,907
and whatever the animals have to do, they do.

240
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:25,676
If we understand that

241
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:28,282
we have not yet achieved what we wanted to,

242
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:33,969
then you will realise

243
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:36,761
that there is a very little gap.

244
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:40,453
The Kundalini awakening takes

245
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:42,981
split of a second,

246
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:49,467
but its rising may take more time in certain people

247
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:55,131
because of blockages in the centre

248
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:59,432
or maybe some imbalances within us.

249
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,303
In short I will try to tell you

250
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,286
what is the Kundalini and what is this picture about.

251
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:11,002
I hope you have got some books with you,

252
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,546
you can also open and see for yourself.

253
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,562
Those who haven't got books can also get from them,

254
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:22,181
it will be easier to understand it.

255
00:15:24,554 --> 00:15:28,237
At the back of the book you will find a nice chart.

256
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:42,849
Firstly you have to be honest about your seeking,

257
00:15:44,054 --> 00:15:47,271
absolutely honest about it then everything will work out.

258
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:54,064
Now here you see this chart

259
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:56,564
is the first center

260
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:59,209
called as the Mooladhara chakra, as I said,

261
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,691
and the sacrum.

262
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:04,847
See the meaning of the word sacrum means sacred.

263
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:09,224
Sacrum is the bone in which the Kundalini is there.

264
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:14,282
I would like you to see from the top

265
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:19,512
this blue color balloon like structure

266
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:21,866
comes down up to the first chakra.

267
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:27,728
Now this,

268
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:36,686
represents a subtle force within us,

269
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:41,226
which is the power of desire.

270
00:16:43,623 --> 00:16:45,623
It manifests outside

271
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:48,123
the left sympathetic nervous system.

272
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:53,012
This is the emotional side of a human being.

273
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,841
It is not only emotional.

274
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:02,323
This is the one that

275
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:04,823
takes conditionings

276
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,411
within itself

277
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:11,495
when we say "Don't do that, don't do that, don't do that"

278
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:19,259
and creates by its activity

279
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:24,107
a balloon like structure called as superego

280
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:26,607
which is in Sanskrit called as mana.

281
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:33,007
So this is the power of mana, of manashakti.

282
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,101
English language is a little

283
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:37,236
confused, when you say mental cases

284
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:40,014
you do not mean, the mental cases

285
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:42,597
that has something to do with the

286
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:44,357
mind which thinks.

287
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,471
But when you say mental cases,

288
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:50,060
you mean to say that they are the people who suffer

289
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:52,292
from emotional problems.

290
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,175
It's a little confused thing

291
00:17:55,894 --> 00:17:57,894
but in psychology

292
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:01,274
it is very nicely described by Jung,

293
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,065
who was a realised soul himself,

294
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,238
the superego

295
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:09,202
and the ID part is this

296
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,430
power by which we

297
00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:17,972
get all our conditionings within us

298
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:20,326
and we pass it to our past.

299
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:23,317
Beyond this area on the left-hand side

300
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:26,206
lies beyond the subconscious,

301
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,085
the collective sub-conscious, all that is dead,

302
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:34,580
since creation lies this side on the left-hand side.

303
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:37,786
This manifests as I told you,

304
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:40,286
the left sympathetic nervous system.

305
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,407
Now in the medical science,

306
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:46,100
there is no difference between the left and right.

307
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:48,153
But you will find out

308
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:51,752
they have entirely two different functions.

309
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:55,543
The left sympathetic nervous caters

310
00:18:55,808 --> 00:19:00,039
to our emotional side which can be proved in Sahaja Yoga practice.

311
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,166
Now on the right hand side,

312
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:07,725
there is another power

313
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:10,353
which is the power of action.

314
00:19:11,494 --> 00:19:15,660
When we desire, the desire has to be put into action.

315
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:19,605
And this power of desire

316
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:23,233
is called the prana Shakti,

317
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:26,314
or the power of action

318
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:29,241
the kriya Shakti, some people call it

319
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,869
and it looks after

320
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:34,369
our intellectual side,

321
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,869
our intelligence

322
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,535
and the mind with which we think about the mental side

323
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,633
and our physical side,

324
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:46,133
through which we go into action.

325
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:55,258
This as a result of it’s activity creates

326
00:19:55,288 --> 00:19:57,416
another balloon you can see there,

327
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,971
a yellow color balloon

328
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:02,004
which we call as ego.

329
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:04,504
EGO, ego.

330
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,141
And this two powers meet at a point,

331
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,876
when a child is about say

332
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:16,416
12 years of age, he is completely

333
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,174
calcified here.

334
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:20,310
But in childhood only you see at

335
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,769
the age of say one year or one and the half year,

336
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:25,524
you start feeling the calcification,

337
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,354
of this soft bone called as fontanel bone.

338
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:32,939
In the center is the third power,

339
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:42,101
called as the power of evolution.

340
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:46,716
The power of sustenance.

341
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:50,285
The power of religion

342
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:51,930
which is innate within us.

343
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,430
Now "religo" means a

344
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:58,404
capacity, you can say a quality

345
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:00,809
like

346
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,590
gold is untarnishable,

347
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:06,284
that is the quality of gold.

348
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,549
Carbon has four valencies

349
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,188
that is the quality of carbon.

350
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:11,793
In the same way,

351
00:21:11,866 --> 00:21:15,009
human beings also have got ten sustenance

352
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:18,198
and these ten sustenance are

353
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:19,603
the dharma

354
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:22,489
or the religions of a human being.

355
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:26,131
It has nothing to do with outside religions, whatever you believe into

356
00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:29,016
or whatever you have fallen into or you are born into.

357
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:32,078
But there are ten sustanances within us,

358
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,920
which are in this area,

359
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,826
call as, we call it as Void, but it's not the same void as Zen says,

360
00:21:40,903 --> 00:21:43,608
but is the visceral cavity

361
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:46,410
in this area,

362
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:51,823
we develop our sustenance.

363
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:58,137
By developing our sustanance only we evolve.

364
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,617
For example, first a fish

365
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:04,574
came out of the water

366
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:10,023
and developed a sustenance by it started crawling

367
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:12,074
and it became a reptile.

368
00:22:12,574 --> 00:22:15,168
Firstly only one fish came

369
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:17,069
and then

370
00:22:17,996 --> 00:22:20,546
shoals and shoals of fishes started

371
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,237
coming out of the water.

372
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:24,705
So

373
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:30,550
the evolution went on like this till we became human beings.

374
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:32,643
In this process,

375
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:34,865
as you know very well

376
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:38,910
the left sided and the right sided animals,

377
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,106
the right sided are the more ambitious, the dominating type.

378
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
The left sided are the sly.

379
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:46,700
As you have many nocturnal animals

380
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,051
they are all left sided,

381
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:51,491
they're frightened and live in the left

382
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:54,674
and those who are aggressive are on the right hand side.

383
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:58,974
They were discarded even some vegetables and what you

384
00:22:59,025 --> 00:23:03,313
call the plants were discarded in the process of evolution.

385
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,837
And they were thrown on the right and left side.

386
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:13,234
And God created man in His own image.

387
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:15,561
That means

388
00:23:18,027 --> 00:23:19,068
man has

389
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,018
everything that God has.

390
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:25,518
If He is the primordial being,

391
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,547
He is the macrocosm then you are the microcosm,

392
00:23:29,132 --> 00:23:31,132
you are a cell in His body

393
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:34,764
but you are not aware of that.

394
00:23:35,264 --> 00:23:38,223
There's a difference between awareness

395
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:40,723
and just consciousness.

396
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:43,698
Awareness is an actualization,

397
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:46,638
while just to be conscious

398
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:50,032
means mentally you believe, rationally you are a conscious, I know that,

399
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:52,874
we think we are brothers and sisters.

400
00:23:56,323 --> 00:23:58,323
Now the centres that are

401
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,536
placed within. The first one, as I told you,

402
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:06,035
is the Mooladhara chakra.

403
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:10,268
You will be happy to know that

404
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:13,740
in the universe Australia is the Mooladhara chakra.

405
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,760
It's a fact you will know that

406
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,586
on vibrations if you ask a question you will know.

407
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,918
Basically you are innocent people.

408
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:37,070
You don't know also when you commit sins that this is sin,

409
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,143
you just do it very innocently.

410
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:43,652
You don't do it knowingly, innocently you do it.

411
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:50,640
And the center second center,

412
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:54,147
is the center called as Swadisthana chakra.

413
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:59,182
The first center manifests your pelvic plexus.

414
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:09,411
The right side, as I told you manifests the right sympathetic nervous system.

415
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:13,568
The centre one manifests your

416
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:17,172
parasympathetic which is broken, which is not yet complete.

417
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:20,566
Whatever you have achieved

418
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,908
in your awareness as a human being

419
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,055
is there and there is little gap,

420
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:27,928
where you have to just

421
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,791
break through into that, and become

422
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:34,653
united with that force.

423
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:40,550
Now this second chakra

424
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,656
is the chakra called as Swadisthana chakra,

425
00:25:44,702 --> 00:25:46,237
you need not worry about the names,

426
00:25:46,737 --> 00:25:49,931
but is the centre for action,

427
00:25:50,913 --> 00:25:54,181
by which you think, think for the future.

428
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:57,670
And this center looks after

429
00:25:58,572 --> 00:25:59,549
many other

430
00:26:02,892 --> 00:26:05,038
visras or you can say organs within us.

431
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:07,698
It looks after your liver.

432
00:26:08,824 --> 00:26:11,801
All attention is looked after by this centre.

433
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:15,571
Liver, then it looks after

434
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,589
your pancreas, your spleen,

435
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,046
your kidneys

436
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:23,868
and uterus in the women.

437
00:26:26,697 --> 00:26:28,778
The most important function of

438
00:26:28,828 --> 00:26:31,720
this centre is to manifest the aortic plexus,

439
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:36,979
in the gross and to convert

440
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:40,154
the fat cells of the stomach

441
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,703
to replace the fat cells of the brain

442
00:26:45,263 --> 00:26:47,263
because after all the fat cells

443
00:26:48,582 --> 00:26:52,785
of the brain are to be replaced because you think, think, think, think

444
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,297
and go mad with thinking.

445
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,394
You think so much

446
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,590
that as if two horns

447
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,142
are coming out of your thinking.

448
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,985
You may say the other day that "Mother,

449
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:08,018
mind is very important because

450
00:27:08,437 --> 00:27:09,788
mind is the problem."

451
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:15,002
Don't you know that this mind is limited?

452
00:27:15,663 --> 00:27:17,359
This rationality is limited.

453
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:19,890
You have to go to unlimited.

454
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:22,918
When I have to come to this hall,

455
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,559
we had to leave the car outside.

456
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,869
This mind can go up to a point and if you

457
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,373
try to go beyond that,

458
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,616
then you really go crazy.

459
00:27:34,224 --> 00:27:36,224
We don't bring the cars inside,

460
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:39,961
in the same way this mind

461
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:42,478
cannot take you to the unlimited.

462
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,585
It’s a limited thing, you have to go beyond the mind.

463
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:54,734
This centre is doing this work

464
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:58,733
of supplying the fat cells and when you think too much,

465
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:03,477
all other visaras or all other organs are

466
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:08,489
not looked after, are neglected by which

467
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,687
the person who thinks too much

468
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:18,110
who lives in the future, who plans too much,

469
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:23,443
also then drinks, in addition to that, supposing,

470
00:28:24,457 --> 00:28:26,024
and in addition to that

471
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:28,541
he does other things like

472
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:31,266
drug taking in the stomach and eats lots of fat food

473
00:28:31,284 --> 00:28:34,276
and all that, so he really finishes that poor liver.

474
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:39,461
And that liver is the one that sorts out

475
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:42,946
all your poisons in the body, all kinds of poison.

476
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:48,193
But this liver gets out of order

477
00:28:48,564 --> 00:28:51,585
and you don't feel it, only the heat starts accumulating,

478
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:54,261
you feel always nauseating

479
00:28:54,311 --> 00:28:57,628
and you feel so unhappy, you don't want to face the present,

480
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:58,982
you want to run away.

481
00:28:59,193 --> 00:29:01,193
You feel extremely horrid

482
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,532
you don't know what to do with yourself.

483
00:29:03,598 --> 00:29:05,598
All that comes from a bad liver.

484
00:29:08,636 --> 00:29:11,182
Also apart from liver

485
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:12,870
your

486
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,428
pancreas goes

487
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,802
out and you develop a disease called diabetes.

488
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,402
With that you also try some coffee and all those things,

489
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:25,769
which add up.

490
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:28,269
I mean coffee, the amount of coffee

491
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,769
people consumes, sometimes I can't understand.

492
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:36,031
And that coffee can really spoil the pancreas

493
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:37,163
to such an extent

494
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,447
that you can develop

495
00:29:40,118 --> 00:29:42,627
even more serious diseases

496
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,816
than diabetes of the pancreas.

497
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,538
Beyond the pancreas lies the spleen.

498
00:29:49,675 --> 00:29:53,351
Spleen is the real victim of modern people,

499
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:56,531
real victim is poor spleen.

500
00:29:57,264 --> 00:30:01,202
Spleen is the one which is the speedometer within us,

501
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:03,702
it regulates your speed.

502
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:08,268
When you are eating your food,

503
00:30:09,156 --> 00:30:10,830
you suddenly open the news

504
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,926
on the TV or something, horrible things happen.

505
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:17,003
You get so shocked and emergencies built-in,

506
00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:20,702
the spleen is already the busy producing RBC’s,

507
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:24,184
red corpuscles for the digestion of the food,

508
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,655
and suddenly it has another emergency, and

509
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:30,174
a third emergency. The way we take our breakfast,

510
00:30:31,094 --> 00:30:33,768
half sandwich in the mouth and half

511
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:35,995
outside

512
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:40,012
stepping into the car, telling your wife that do this, do that

513
00:30:40,512 --> 00:30:43,966
and then rush through the rat race,

514
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,998
ending up yourself

515
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:50,428
into a very crazy spleen.

516
00:30:50,617 --> 00:30:52,255
The spleen does not know

517
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:56,242
how to carry on with your telescopic behavior

518
00:30:57,162 --> 00:30:59,162
and it go so very crazy

519
00:30:59,662 --> 00:31:03,004
that it starts producing crazy cells

520
00:31:03,504 --> 00:31:05,504
and these are the crazy cells

521
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:07,879
which create ultimately

522
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:10,756
a very serious disease called blood cancer.

523
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:14,986
The other day somebody asked me a question,

524
00:31:14,995 --> 00:31:17,672
"Mother, how the children get blood cancer?"

525
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:21,355
I said if I tell you you shouldn’t be angry with me,

526
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:24,668
but when we are after the life of our children,

527
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:26,439
poor things, they are small children.

528
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:29,457
We are trying to make them good citizens.

529
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,142
So this crazy spleen, becomes

530
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,860
absolutely uncontrollable

531
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,768
it start producing blood cells

532
00:32:06,118 --> 00:32:09,765
which become malignant. They go at random,

533
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:13,290
any time and the malignancy starts

534
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:15,619
where one cell becomes very big,

535
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:18,968
unique as we are also malignant people sometimes.

536
00:32:19,254 --> 00:32:21,537
You want to be unique people in the society,

537
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:24,303
engulfing everybody, encroaching on other people,

538
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:27,466
in this competition we want to have everything to ourselves,

539
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:29,339
and by the time

540
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,477
you are old, you find your hands are shaking,

541
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:35,977
feet are shaking, you can't walk properly

542
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:38,761
or you develop diseases like say,

543
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,560
heart attack, or a stroke.

544
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:47,769
This rat race is

545
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,480
very competitive. Competition for what?

546
00:32:53,646 --> 00:32:55,951
Everybody should be able to grow

547
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,750
in relation to others.

548
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,406
For example, if your nose only starts growing like that,

549
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:05,547
not in relation to your body or face,

550
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:07,556
what is going to happen to the rest of it?

551
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:12,303
To be on your own, I’m on my own,

552
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:17,025
and then you start growing

553
00:33:17,354 --> 00:33:20,505
without any relationship or co-ordination with the other

554
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:22,172
parts of the society,

555
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:24,434
other parts of the world,

556
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:27,123
then you become malignant.

557
00:33:28,478 --> 00:33:32,085
You lose all balance, you don't know what you are doing.

558
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:38,239
This is the tragedy

559
00:33:38,739 --> 00:33:41,080
that when this happens to us

560
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,211
we are so ego-orientated

561
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:45,472
that the pangs are not felt

562
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,314
till you reach a stage, that suddenly you find

563
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:51,729
a person goes they you call it in English - "ga-ga",

564
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:54,229
American English.

565
00:33:56,844 --> 00:33:59,695
You find them, they can't talk, I have seen it

566
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,772
in Paris. Some people,

567
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:04,909
not very old, younger to me in age,

568
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:07,409
walk into a bus

569
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,080
and they are talking loudly,

570
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:11,366
all sorts of French words

571
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:13,866
and I asked what are they doing?

572
00:34:14,366 --> 00:34:17,445
They said, "Mother they are talking about last war. I said why?

573
00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:20,354
They said they just go on talking like this, they're gone.

574
00:34:20,854 --> 00:34:24,253
They are, what did you say, out of the deck.

575
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:32,176
Because you are having such a running jump towards the hell,

576
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:36,730
that the progress, so called,

577
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:42,704
will make our society into very funny people

578
00:34:43,095 --> 00:34:45,204
who are jittery,

579
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,376
who are twitching their heads, necks and everything

580
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:54,045
and their children are so aggressive,

581
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:59,959
that it is impossible to understand why they're behaving like this.

582
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,099
We have to understand

583
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,322
that we are part and parcel of the whole.

584
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:14,108
And anything that is done

585
00:35:14,536 --> 00:35:16,608
without the relationship of other

586
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:18,869
can create

587
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:25,063
tremendous problems for the whole world as it is and it is creating.

588
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:31,901
The second centre is very important

589
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,930
for modern people as I told you,

590
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:38,656
because when you start thinking too much also,

591
00:35:39,029 --> 00:35:41,029
what you do is use your right side,

592
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:44,163
and the left side gets frozen.

593
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,466
By improving

594
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:49,636
on your thinking processes,

595
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:51,938
thinking too much of the future and

596
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,438
planning and of course most of the plans go waste.

597
00:35:55,246 --> 00:35:57,924
Such a lost of energy we waste in thinking

598
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:02,886
that we find that if we had not thought so much,

599
00:36:03,006 --> 00:36:05,006
we would not have been that much frustrated.

600
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,156
The planning also to such an extent

601
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:11,855
doesn't help in any way.

602
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,754
Supposing I have to come to this hall

603
00:36:14,946 --> 00:36:16,346
and I do not know the way.

604
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:18,411
What planning can I have?

605
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,193
I have just to ask somebody how do you go there

606
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:22,932
and face as it is.

607
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:27,490
Supposing a seed has to grow into a root -

608
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:30,117
does it have any planning before hand?

609
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:33,861
It does not. What it does is that it faces.

610
00:36:34,035 --> 00:36:36,035
It's a little cell, and so wise,

611
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:38,755
and it knows that there is an obstruction, no use

612
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,656
fighting with this rock,

613
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:42,466
so it goes around,

614
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:45,957
all soft places it pierces

615
00:36:46,457 --> 00:36:49,693
and gets itself embedded sensibly and wisely

616
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:51,152
and uses that rock,

617
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:54,995
uses that rock for the strengthening of the tree.

618
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:59,924
So when we try to dominate others,

619
00:37:00,424 --> 00:37:04,679
I mean the sophisticated, the more sophisticated you get,

620
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:08,888
the more sophisticated this ego gets

621
00:37:10,113 --> 00:37:13,809
and with that sophistication you are very pleased, sorry,

622
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:17,347
yes and all those things are there,

623
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,540
but inside a big Mr. ego is developing,

624
00:37:21,348 --> 00:37:24,226
like a balloon. And it presses down

625
00:37:25,088 --> 00:37:26,761
your superego,

626
00:37:29,054 --> 00:37:30,676
and it comes down.

627
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,791
Now the gap that is between the two

628
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,984
or the place where it should be is not there

629
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:39,371
and ego presses down the superego,

630
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:42,753
till superego starts seeing

631
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:46,176
the colossal ego.

632
00:37:47,654 --> 00:37:51,381
And then such a person takes to escapes,

633
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,247
it takes to alcohol,

634
00:37:53,403 --> 00:37:55,403
which gives rise to superego

635
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:58,048
or it takes to drugs

636
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:00,947
and all kinds of escapes in life

637
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:04,344
to run away from his own ego because he can't bear it.

638
00:38:06,474 --> 00:38:08,744
Now the wobbling starts,

639
00:38:09,769 --> 00:38:11,769
the ego and superego starts wobbling

640
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,678
and that's how you get people who are absolutely confused.

641
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,588
Moreover, to add up to the whole problem

642
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:27,892
the modern times are the ones

643
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,079
that in this confusion,

644
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,526
last judgment has already started.

645
00:38:36,968 --> 00:38:39,202
Through your Kundalini awakening only

646
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,358
you will judge yourself

647
00:38:41,858 --> 00:38:43,100
and correct yourself

648
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:46,378
and you will enter into the kingdom of God.

649
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,286
These confusions

650
00:38:53,163 --> 00:38:57,671
actually have led human beings to such frantic

651
00:38:58,225 --> 00:39:00,225
precarious ages

652
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:02,725
that Sahaja Yoga

653
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:04,784
had to come on this earth,

654
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:09,076
to solve the problems once for all.

655
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,389
After getting Realisation,

656
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:14,941
it's so remarkable when you find your absolute

657
00:39:15,006 --> 00:39:17,006
through Kundalini awakening

658
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:20,635
I have seen people overnight they give up so many things.

659
00:39:21,135 --> 00:39:23,135
Like I know of an old man,

660
00:39:24,722 --> 00:39:26,866
very old man, in Singapore

661
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,131
who is very well known, very rich man

662
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:31,196
and a very well known personality,

663
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:36,147
and he got his Realisation

664
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,705
and he told me that overnight,

665
00:39:38,825 --> 00:39:40,516
"I gave up my gambling,

666
00:39:40,762 --> 00:39:42,485
I gave up my drinking

667
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:45,370
and I gave up my racing".

668
00:39:47,374 --> 00:39:49,374
These are also escapes in life,

669
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,620
these are all escapes

670
00:39:52,718 --> 00:39:54,718
because we are so bored of ourselves.

671
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:56,509
Imagine a person is imprisoned.

672
00:39:58,153 --> 00:40:00,428
If he is just imprisoned in a nice place,

673
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:02,805
he should not feel upset. After all

674
00:40:02,852 --> 00:40:04,554
it's a very good thing to face yourself,

675
00:40:04,565 --> 00:40:06,565
that's the most beautiful thing we have.

676
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:11,056
But because we are so frightened of ourselves only,

677
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:14,373
that we don't want to be left alone, we think that we are lonely.

678
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:18,105
We want to run away from ourselves.

679
00:40:19,004 --> 00:40:20,385
We want to have somebody else is

680
00:40:20,414 --> 00:40:23,313
better to have somebody else, and even when somebody else comes in,

681
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:25,433
we do not want to face him squarely

682
00:40:26,205 --> 00:40:28,205
but we want to have something in between,

683
00:40:28,306 --> 00:40:30,306
like a bottle of beer or something.

684
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,708
After Realisation you first time start enjoying each other.

685
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:40,783
You first time start feeling the vibrations on another person

686
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:44,501
and you really enjoy the beauty of another person's

687
00:40:44,838 --> 00:40:47,038
through this cool breeze that is coming

688
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:49,158
out of the being of that person.

689
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:52,999
And this should happen to all of you.

690
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,770
You all should achieve it,

691
00:40:56,198 --> 00:40:59,353
it's very important because you are out and out seekers.

692
00:40:59,726 --> 00:41:01,799
But first you must have your self-estimation.

693
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:04,842
You must know that you are not here to play

694
00:41:05,342 --> 00:41:07,342
these games with yourself.

695
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:09,842
All kinds of games are available.

696
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:11,617
The industries have provided,

697
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:13,881
the Industrial Revolution has provided,

698
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:17,531
all modern thinkers and the books and all that have got it

699
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:21,408
and to add it gurus have come from India to supply

700
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,872
this demand market.

701
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,650
So the picture is complete.

702
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,172
This should not upset,

703
00:41:32,614 --> 00:41:37,264
because behind all fakeness and falsehood there has to be the reality.

704
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,650
If you see thousands of

705
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,957
artificial flowers you must know there has to be one real rose.

706
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:50,373
And in the same way behind all this falsehood

707
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:55,425
and confusion there is reality

708
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,599
which is so beautiful within yourself

709
00:41:58,298 --> 00:42:00,759
which you have to achieve through Kundalini awakening.

710
00:42:01,476 --> 00:42:04,302
In short now I will tell you about the other centres

711
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:06,621
because if you go through this book

712
00:42:07,266 --> 00:42:08,165
you will know

713
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:11,117
about the names and things but in short I can tell you.

714
00:42:11,726 --> 00:42:13,028
That the third centre

715
00:42:13,184 --> 00:42:14,822
is the centre of our seeking

716
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,658
is the center by which we are seeking,

717
00:42:19,012 --> 00:42:21,012
is the navel centre is

718
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:24,886
by which amoeba, an amoeba felt hungry,

719
00:42:25,386 --> 00:42:28,704
he was seeking food. In seeking food only

720
00:42:29,204 --> 00:42:31,478
we went up to the stage of

721
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:34,765
say mammoth and all these big animals.

722
00:42:34,882 --> 00:42:36,882
But they were such unwieldly big things

723
00:42:37,528 --> 00:42:39,528
that they could not maintain themselves.

724
00:42:39,882 --> 00:42:42,153
So then the intelligent animals came in.

725
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,522
In that also

726
00:42:43,712 --> 00:42:45,712
some of them were very horrid ones

727
00:42:45,884 --> 00:42:47,392
like foxes and all that.

728
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,373
Then very powerful animals came up

729
00:42:51,509 --> 00:42:53,509
who had more physical power

730
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:55,718
than their big body.

731
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:57,908
Like that we develop

732
00:42:57,971 --> 00:43:01,339
with this seeking up to a point when we became really human beings

733
00:43:01,985 --> 00:43:04,224
and when we became human beings

734
00:43:04,378 --> 00:43:08,101
we started seeking things like possessions;

735
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:11,852
if not possession, like power,

736
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:18,215
in politics, economics, social work, social things

737
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:20,897
and lastly, the Spirit.

738
00:43:22,326 --> 00:43:25,162
Spirit is the solution for all of them.

739
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:31,104
Without the light you cannot see anything in this world.

740
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:35,308
I cannot see you without any light in there.

741
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:41,332
To me, in darkness you are nothing but darkness. I don't see it.

742
00:43:42,597 --> 00:43:44,597
I cannot relate one to another.

743
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:48,792
I do not know who are sitting here and listening to me,

744
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:53,342
but once there is light you can see everything clearly,

745
00:43:53,842 --> 00:43:55,622
and that's what it is, happens.

746
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,758
That when you get your enlightenment

747
00:43:58,258 --> 00:44:00,929
you become the master of yourself.

748
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,899
This is the end of the seeking which starts.

749
00:44:06,399 --> 00:44:09,102
In this seeking only, around the seeking

750
00:44:09,602 --> 00:44:13,173
are our sustenance’s are developed gradually

751
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:15,563
and ultimately we become human beings.

752
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:18,376
And for human beings there are ten sustenance’s

753
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:20,767
described in the Ten Commandments.

754
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:22,921
When I talk about Ten Commandments,

755
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:25,348
a one gentleman got very angry and said "You are

756
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:27,374
a Christian, you are a Christian, you are a Christian!"

757
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:31,295
But Ten Commandments were written

758
00:44:31,522 --> 00:44:34,036
when there were Jews, they were not written,

759
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:36,406
Moses was not a Christian, he was a Jew

760
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:38,177
and the Jew got angry with me

761
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:39,857
that I was a Christian.

762
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,560
Moses, Abraham,

763
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:46,299
Confucius, Socrates,

764
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,340
Mohammed, Nanak, Janak,

765
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:54,645
Lao Tse, these are the

766
00:44:55,837 --> 00:44:57,837
Primordial masters.

767
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:01,717
The principle of primordial masters, the Adi-Gurus

768
00:45:02,181 --> 00:45:03,783
who incarnated on this earth

769
00:45:04,356 --> 00:45:07,890
to teach us how to keep our sustenance.

770
00:45:08,736 --> 00:45:12,936
They taught against all strong alcohols and strong things.

771
00:45:13,254 --> 00:45:15,254
Christ did not talk

772
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:17,617
but it does not mean that when He said

773
00:45:17,643 --> 00:45:19,643
He converted into wine, means He

774
00:45:19,706 --> 00:45:20,900
fermented the wine.

775
00:45:20,948 --> 00:45:23,400
You cannot ferment the wine in a minute, you understand that.

776
00:45:24,902 --> 00:45:27,899
Wine is a very common word, even today if you go

777
00:45:28,399 --> 00:45:30,783
will find that wine means

778
00:45:31,848 --> 00:45:33,515
grapes. I mean even

779
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:36,015
a creeper of the grape is called a wine,

780
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,260
even the juice of he thing is called wine.

781
00:45:38,596 --> 00:45:40,606
Now to differentiate we are starting to call it

782
00:45:40,632 --> 00:45:42,632
grape juice. But it is very, very

783
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,064
loose, but you will be surprised it is a very

784
00:45:44,218 --> 00:45:47,607
... About fifty years back people must have started or something like that

785
00:45:47,852 --> 00:45:50,806
in India, but may be abroad, I don't know.

786
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:55,098
Even today many people call it a wine "raksasia",

787
00:45:55,397 --> 00:45:58,253
even in Indian language it is called as the wine.

788
00:45:58,534 --> 00:46:01,070
Any grape juice is called as a wine.

789
00:46:02,795 --> 00:46:05,308
So there are many other things

790
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:06,971
which these people told us

791
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:09,958
that you should not do, to keep yourself in the centre.

792
00:46:11,427 --> 00:46:15,732
Now I divide our mistakes into categories.

793
00:46:18,298 --> 00:46:21,440
The first mistake we have is not to believe

794
00:46:21,702 --> 00:46:23,259
that God Almighty

795
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:25,759
is going to look after our well-being.

796
00:46:26,844 --> 00:46:28,844
Krishna has said very clearly

797
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:31,361
that Yoga kshemam Vahaamyaham. Meaning

798
00:46:31,386 --> 00:46:34,224
after Yoga, after union with God,

799
00:46:34,724 --> 00:46:36,724
I will look after your well being.

800
00:46:38,942 --> 00:46:40,942
That means you should get connected.

801
00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:43,442
Supposing I am not an Australian citizen

802
00:46:43,558 --> 00:46:45,906
why will Australian Government look after me?

803
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:50,249
In the same way if you are not the members

804
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:52,231
of God's community

805
00:46:52,495 --> 00:46:55,487
or if you are not entered into the Kingdom of God

806
00:46:55,805 --> 00:46:57,987
or if you are not a citizen of His Kingdom,

807
00:46:58,834 --> 00:47:01,855
it is not His responsibility to look after your well being.

808
00:47:02,721 --> 00:47:06,083
I mean of course He has created you, so He looks after you.

809
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:12,231
But otherwise it's not certain that He'll look after you.

810
00:47:15,857 --> 00:47:18,931
People demand so much from God,

811
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:21,063
they think they are already connected.

812
00:47:21,746 --> 00:47:25,519
They treat Him as if you can find Him somewhere under the stone.

813
00:47:26,951 --> 00:47:29,336
They go on demanding please look after my son,

814
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,379
please do this, praying morning till evening,

815
00:47:31,879 --> 00:47:32,986
I mean it's pestering.

816
00:47:34,327 --> 00:47:36,086
When you are not connected with God,

817
00:47:36,879 --> 00:47:38,154
if you go on

818
00:47:38,654 --> 00:47:40,965
doing like this to any human being also,

819
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:42,330
you'll get arrested.

820
00:47:45,591 --> 00:47:48,366
And that's what happens, that we live under myths:

821
00:47:48,372 --> 00:47:51,909
"Oh I have been praying and God has given me this,

822
00:47:53,341 --> 00:47:55,341
and I have been doing this."

823
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,439
But we don't see, do we deserve it?

824
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:02,500
Are we the Spirit? Have we tried to be the Spirit?

825
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,498
We have done all kinds of things but to be the Spirit.

826
00:48:07,272 --> 00:48:10,644
When you are the Spirit then you are really blessed -

827
00:48:11,144 --> 00:48:12,031
really blessed,

828
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:15,409
not only by His powers

829
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,708
but you become the master of your being,

830
00:48:18,117 --> 00:48:21,001
and you start manifesting your own powers.

831
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:26,438
This seeking and the surrounding dharma

832
00:48:27,176 --> 00:48:29,376
which is looked after by the Primordial masters

833
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:34,085
is another centre here, above that is the centre

834
00:48:34,804 --> 00:48:36,804
of the Mother of the Universe,

835
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:38,530
who gives us the security.

836
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,466
This one when spoiled

837
00:48:43,643 --> 00:48:45,966
the security, the sense of security spoiled

838
00:48:46,252 --> 00:48:47,505
especially among women,

839
00:48:48,005 --> 00:48:51,183
when they feel that their husband are negligent or they are

840
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:54,810
flirting with other women and all sorts of things.

841
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:57,633
Then this centre goes but of order.

842
00:48:58,667 --> 00:49:00,667
When this centre goes out of order,

843
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:05,127
then they develop diseases like breast cancer.

844
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,503
Breast cancer

845
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:12,911
is more common in societies where they have divorces.

846
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:16,439
I have given a regular speech on this

847
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:19,227
which you should get from Sydney and you will know all about it.

848
00:49:20,176 --> 00:49:22,475
Now the right side heart which you see here

849
00:49:22,825 --> 00:49:24,825
is the centre of a Father,

850
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:27,737
the left one is the centre of the Mother.

851
00:49:30,438 --> 00:49:34,257
The right side heart centre catches when as a father

852
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:36,162
you have not done your duties

853
00:49:36,769 --> 00:49:39,109
or if your father has died very early,

854
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:42,795
you were shocked, then also it can happen.

855
00:49:43,658 --> 00:49:46,515
Anorexia and all these diseases can also be

856
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:49,020
caused by this kind of happenings

857
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,498
or also asthma.

858
00:49:51,763 --> 00:49:54,387
Asthma is invariably is caused

859
00:49:54,887 --> 00:49:56,887
by this centre going out of order.

860
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:01,763
The left side is the centre of the Mother,

861
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,927
our father and mother we chose.

862
00:50:06,153 --> 00:50:08,153
Before our birth we chose them.

863
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:11,389
It was foolish to choose horrible parents.

864
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:13,362
But you better pay for it.

865
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:16,887
In one lifetime

866
00:50:17,195 --> 00:50:19,519
it is better to pay for the horrible ones

867
00:50:19,741 --> 00:50:21,741
so that next time you won't have them again.

868
00:50:24,634 --> 00:50:27,376
But we are not to judge them.

869
00:50:27,876 --> 00:50:29,609
If they are not seekers

870
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,852
it's a very difficult thing to live with them, I know.

871
00:50:32,673 --> 00:50:34,673
It's very difficult to live with parents

872
00:50:34,767 --> 00:50:36,507
who are morning till evening

873
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,070
counting every penny, counting every tin which are emptied,

874
00:50:40,314 --> 00:50:43,867
every tube that is emptied, they store up,

875
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:45,614
they are so materialistic

876
00:50:46,114 --> 00:50:49,550
and you just can't bear such people, I can quite understand.

877
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,685
Even a wife could be like that, and a husband could be like that,

878
00:50:52,843 --> 00:50:54,843
extremely materialistic, you will be fed up.

879
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:59,064
They write down everything, every lamp post they must know,

880
00:51:00,312 --> 00:51:02,569
count everything.

881
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:04,985
Today a lady who interviewed me asked me,

882
00:51:05,164 --> 00:51:08,161
"How many people, Mother, have you given Realisation

883
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,555
and how many people you have cured."

884
00:51:10,649 --> 00:51:13,018
I said "You better ask the sun first of all

885
00:51:13,091 --> 00:51:15,894
how many leaves it has made green, then talk to me."

886
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:21,480
I never write any accounts,

887
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:24,514
leave alone of human beings, even of money.

888
00:51:25,014 --> 00:51:26,647
I never write, I have no time,

889
00:51:26,677 --> 00:51:29,250
I have no understanding as how to write accounts.

890
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,388
Next life maybe I will be an accountant, for your information.

891
00:51:36,435 --> 00:51:40,726
So this happens to us when we become

892
00:51:42,252 --> 00:51:44,762
against our parents.

893
00:51:45,262 --> 00:51:48,034
I don't say that you should carry on

894
00:51:48,299 --> 00:51:50,351
with mad people, there's no use

895
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:53,516
asking the bull to come and hit you, is correct.

896
00:51:54,016 --> 00:51:55,738
But you need not judge them,

897
00:51:55,832 --> 00:51:57,255
you can leave them, stay away

898
00:51:57,328 --> 00:51:59,328
and do not have them in your life, it's alright.

899
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,509
But if you are taking

900
00:52:02,774 --> 00:52:05,896
interest in them as well as fighting with them morning till evening,

901
00:52:06,033 --> 00:52:07,712
then you catch on this heart chakra.

902
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:13,066
I would say that in this respect Indians are sensible people.

903
00:52:14,143 --> 00:52:17,619
They are very sensible that they keep their parents all right.

904
00:52:18,226 --> 00:52:19,841
And the parents are also yet

905
00:52:19,985 --> 00:52:22,469
very sensible people. They love their children, they give

906
00:52:22,478 --> 00:52:24,478
everything that they have to the children,

907
00:52:24,615 --> 00:52:30,271
and children start really loving their parents,

908
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:32,429
till they die they look after them.

909
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:36,387
The result of that is of course very bad,

910
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:40,274
because here in all the western countries the parents

911
00:52:40,475 --> 00:52:43,299
are still in a bridal mood, I mean they are brides

912
00:52:43,991 --> 00:52:45,991
and the bridegrooms you see

913
00:52:46,491 --> 00:52:49,709
they never become old enough to be parents.

914
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,587
Seen even an eighty year old man you will find

915
00:52:51,595 --> 00:52:53,765
marry an eighteen year old girl. I mean

916
00:52:53,816 --> 00:52:55,816
it's a thing going on all the time. God knows

917
00:52:56,316 --> 00:52:58,316
what sort of intelligence is that?

918
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:01,500
But with all that happening

919
00:53:01,658 --> 00:53:03,658
poor children do not know

920
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:05,605
which parents to be chosen.

921
00:53:06,105 --> 00:53:08,427
And the last judgement has started, now what to do?

922
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,269
Now you place yourself in their places

923
00:53:11,342 --> 00:53:12,674
and think what would you do

924
00:53:12,768 --> 00:53:14,938
when you know such crazy parents that today

925
00:53:14,947 --> 00:53:16,712
they are together, tomorrow they are divorced.

926
00:53:17,212 --> 00:53:19,082
On the streets they will be kissing,

927
00:53:19,347 --> 00:53:20,647
hugging each other,

928
00:53:21,147 --> 00:53:24,459
doing all kind of nonsensical thing. Very embarrassing also,

929
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:26,745
and if you ask them where are you

930
00:53:26,796 --> 00:53:28,796
going they say they are going to the divorce case.

931
00:53:32,672 --> 00:53:36,248
These kinds of absurdities are taking place and because of that

932
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:38,748
children don't want to get birth

933
00:53:39,974 --> 00:53:41,824
in all these places; England,

934
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,452
Germany, Switzerland, everywhere.

935
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:49,441
The birth rate is towards the minus side.

936
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:51,941
In Germany especially, West Germany

937
00:53:52,227 --> 00:53:54,468
and East Germany of all the things

938
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:57,707
people give so much money that a woman if she produces

939
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,062
three children she earns more money than their Prime Minister.

940
00:54:01,562 --> 00:54:03,562
But still women don't want to produce.

941
00:54:04,062 --> 00:54:06,839
They want to be free, independent, they don't want to be mothers.

942
00:54:07,617 --> 00:54:09,940
As a result this poor India

943
00:54:09,991 --> 00:54:12,856
has to accommodate for all the children born today

944
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:17,582
and we are blamed for over population,

945
00:54:18,082 --> 00:54:20,718
now what to do? We have to bear the load.

946
00:54:24,017 --> 00:54:26,622
So also it is your responsibility

947
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:29,299
to see if you do not produce children

948
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:31,437
at least those who are producing children

949
00:54:31,638 --> 00:54:35,229
have some compassion for them

950
00:54:35,387 --> 00:54:37,474
and have some understanding.

951
00:54:37,504 --> 00:54:39,976
Do not blame them. Oh everybody tells me,

952
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:42,802
what about your problem of population.

953
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:47,295
I tell them now who is responsible for our population

954
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:52,391
because in that country even if you have fourteen children,

955
00:54:52,891 --> 00:54:54,891
they love all their children that are there.

956
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:59,429
They are not so ego-orientated that their hearts are not closed,

957
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,420
they are not so unemotional,

958
00:55:03,198 --> 00:55:07,317
anybody who has no child will go to

959
00:55:07,368 --> 00:55:08,916
all the holy places

960
00:55:09,587 --> 00:55:12,084
and ask for blessings that they should get children,

961
00:55:13,161 --> 00:55:14,222
to get a child

962
00:55:14,231 --> 00:55:17,785
is such a blessing in India and child is such an important thing.

963
00:55:20,123 --> 00:55:22,530
But the mistake they are committing

964
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:25,577
is just the other than yours.

965
00:55:26,376 --> 00:55:28,676
The mistake in those developing countries

966
00:55:28,706 --> 00:55:31,559
is that they do not believe that God Almighty

967
00:55:31,653 --> 00:55:34,438
is the One who is going to look after your well being.

968
00:55:35,152 --> 00:55:37,354
They don't believe in the power of their Father,

969
00:55:37,427 --> 00:55:39,588
so they do the crime against the Father or

970
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:41,047
you can say the sin against the Father.

971
00:55:41,782 --> 00:55:44,314
When you don't believe in the capacity of your Father,

972
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,579
so there is bribery, corruption, all sorts of things going on, you know

973
00:55:49,844 --> 00:55:52,941
cutting corners and money and all those things go on.

974
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,866
Still in India I would not say that

975
00:55:56,772 --> 00:56:00,529
ordinary people are dishonest. I mean our bureaucrats may be, our

976
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:03,666
politicians may be and business people may be. But

977
00:56:03,781 --> 00:56:05,781
ordinary people are very honest in India.

978
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:09,047
But this is what happens.

979
00:56:10,055 --> 00:56:12,688
On the other side, you see supposing

980
00:56:13,188 --> 00:56:15,589
an Indian comes to your house, be careful

981
00:56:16,635 --> 00:56:20,108
he may run away with anything that you have in the house, anything,

982
00:56:20,608 --> 00:56:22,907
see, but

983
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:25,842
if an American comes to your house, be careful about your wife.

984
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:30,063
He may run away with your wife or with your daughter.

985
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:34,990
Or say an Englishman comes he'll do it in a subtler way

986
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:36,583
because he's a scholar.

987
00:56:37,893 --> 00:56:40,659
So he reads some poetry to your wife

988
00:56:40,971 --> 00:56:42,722
and in the night you find she is missing.

989
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:50,042
This is fundamental, I mean the wife

990
00:56:50,467 --> 00:56:52,599
who runs away like this creates problem

991
00:56:53,965 --> 00:56:55,965
fundamentally for the household.

992
00:56:56,653 --> 00:56:58,653
Just think in a house,

993
00:56:59,022 --> 00:57:02,989
where there are children, there is husband, kitchen

994
00:57:03,489 --> 00:57:06,271
and all the places, everybody sleeping nicely,

995
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:08,257
early in the morning they find

996
00:57:08,286 --> 00:57:11,505
that the main pole of the house is missing and the whole thing is collapsed.

997
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,595
What will happen to the children, nobody thinks.

998
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,604
Nobody understands

999
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:21,707
or they think they are being in love

1000
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:23,503
so they must go.

1001
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:27,457
Men do the same. I mean there is no difference between men and women.

1002
00:57:29,577 --> 00:57:32,990
But this is the sin against the Mother

1003
00:57:36,089 --> 00:57:39,453
that the women have to be respectable and respected.

1004
00:57:41,874 --> 00:57:45,365
Housewives’ position is within us

1005
00:57:45,413 --> 00:57:47,413
here on the left hand side, nabhi

1006
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,171
and if a housewife,

1007
00:57:50,332 --> 00:57:52,654
the deity of housewife, is not in our house,

1008
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,027
not that the woman but the housewife,

1009
00:57:57,335 --> 00:57:59,335
then our spleen goes out.

1010
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:04,606
We get, children get crazy,

1011
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,903
why is there in-disciplined. Somebody asked me today

1012
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:12,632
what happens to the people like who try to kill Reagan?

1013
00:58:13,149 --> 00:58:15,149
I said, ask his mother.

1014
00:58:17,043 --> 00:58:20,126
She must be after the life of the child, morning till evening

1015
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:23,910
and that's why he's taking action,

1016
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,448
or is a reaction of what has happened to him.

1017
00:58:27,664 --> 00:58:31,052
How do these complications arise

1018
00:58:31,552 --> 00:58:33,552
has a basis in the family

1019
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:37,468
in the nest, that is your house.

1020
00:58:39,437 --> 00:58:41,437
You have to live in the nest

1021
00:58:42,427 --> 00:58:44,427
as a father and a mother

1022
00:58:44,927 --> 00:58:46,390
looking after your children.

1023
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:49,970
Children are the most important things

1024
00:58:51,091 --> 00:58:53,821
in the whole world for human beings.

1025
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:59,731
Let the politics go to hell,

1026
00:58:59,817 --> 00:59:02,328
and let the economics take its own course,

1027
00:59:02,828 --> 00:59:04,086
but children

1028
00:59:04,812 --> 00:59:07,618
are to be looked after, that's your primary duty.

1029
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,380
But in India we go to the other end,

1030
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,901
when we start look after our children we don't mind

1031
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,930
selling our countries also in the name of children.

1032
00:59:18,897 --> 00:59:20,897
But we live with two extremes I feel,

1033
00:59:20,926 --> 00:59:22,604
the sin against the Mother

1034
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:24,727
and the sin against the Father.

1035
00:59:27,204 --> 00:59:29,204
When we sin against the Mother

1036
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:32,974
as Australians, as I am now an Australian,

1037
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:35,079
let us face what happens to us.

1038
00:59:39,364 --> 00:59:42,538
Absolutely we are emotionally blackmailed by ourselves.

1039
00:59:44,142 --> 00:59:47,267
We torture ourselves, we live with artificial things.

1040
00:59:48,407 --> 00:59:51,312
Like if a wife

1041
00:59:51,812 --> 00:59:54,416
wants to run away with another man

1042
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:58,770
we will even go to get a honeymoon ticket for her

1043
00:59:59,025 --> 01:00:01,982
because we are very considerate good husbands.

1044
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:06,332
Same thing with the wives if she finds that the husband

1045
01:00:06,381 --> 01:00:08,381
is interested in another woman,

1046
01:00:08,448 --> 01:00:10,448
she should not be jealous.

1047
01:00:10,948 --> 01:00:16,842
In Sahaja Yoga this is not very much appreciated.

1048
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:20,465
Husband has to behave, like a husband. He should make his wife

1049
01:00:20,532 --> 01:00:21,371
run the house.

1050
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:24,022
And the woman has to be a woman.

1051
01:00:25,897 --> 01:00:27,897
She must see to it that

1052
01:00:28,246 --> 01:00:30,246
no danger is brought to the children.

1053
01:00:31,254 --> 01:00:34,409
We have no business to hurt anyone like this

1054
01:00:34,721 --> 01:00:36,721
and we do not know how much we hurt,

1055
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:39,221
we give cancers to our wives and husbands.

1056
01:00:40,324 --> 01:00:42,324
We give all kinds of horrible diseases,

1057
01:00:42,692 --> 01:00:45,642
mental tortures we make them mad, by our

1058
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:48,330
mad, capricious,

1059
01:00:50,111 --> 01:00:54,674
very shallow, understanding of our emotions.

1060
01:00:56,812 --> 01:00:59,661
A one man starts going to another woman,

1061
01:01:00,161 --> 01:01:01,567
then he goes to another woman,

1062
01:01:01,747 --> 01:01:03,306
then to ten women he goes

1063
01:01:03,392 --> 01:01:05,106
and then ten men go to ten women

1064
01:01:05,192 --> 01:01:08,543
and end up in a lunatic asylum or

1065
01:01:08,779 --> 01:01:12,547
in the orphanage. I have seen in England we had a neighbor

1066
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:16,116
who had a very huge house, he died, he was an old man

1067
01:01:16,258 --> 01:01:17,315
and you'd be surprised

1068
01:01:17,815 --> 01:01:20,556
they did not discover his body for one month.

1069
01:01:20,905 --> 01:01:23,355
Because there's no family feeling, nothing,

1070
01:01:24,326 --> 01:01:27,074
even a rat doesn't enter that house. Can you imagine!

1071
01:01:30,418 --> 01:01:32,663
This is what has happened in thinking,

1072
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,408
“I am separated, I am individualistic.

1073
01:01:35,475 --> 01:01:38,602
I am exclusive”. If you are really individualistic,

1074
01:01:39,046 --> 01:01:41,046
if you are really mature, individually,

1075
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:45,339
then you know the unity much better.

1076
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:49,271
Then you understand that you are the support

1077
01:01:50,148 --> 01:01:54,631
of the whole because you are so matured.

1078
01:01:56,638 --> 01:01:58,638
No wonder our children are not maturing.

1079
01:01:59,345 --> 01:02:01,345
They are behaving in such a manner.

1080
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:05,501
We are responsible, we must accept that in our own

1081
01:02:06,867 --> 01:02:09,913
ideas about compatibility and all this nonsense,

1082
01:02:09,923 --> 01:02:11,711
we don’t have in India, we are quite comfortable,

1083
01:02:11,721 --> 01:02:13,606
we are producing children quite all right.

1084
01:02:15,085 --> 01:02:21,662
We have no problems. Why do you run after these capricious,

1085
01:02:22,444 --> 01:02:24,444
these shallow ideas?

1086
01:02:26,432 --> 01:02:28,432
You will be held responsible

1087
01:02:29,874 --> 01:02:33,861
for all these horrible diseases that men and women have got,

1088
01:02:34,361 --> 01:02:36,361
and the children that are going to suffer,

1089
01:02:36,861 --> 01:02:41,388
if you have charity, better start it at home.

1090
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,447
Better be charitable

1091
01:02:44,571 --> 01:02:46,947
to your own wife and to your own husband.

1092
01:02:47,447 --> 01:02:49,926
Be charitable to your children.

1093
01:02:50,012 --> 01:02:52,460
Don't go by concept of falling in love,

1094
01:02:52,678 --> 01:02:54,678
you'll fall, really and make others fall too.

1095
01:02:56,176 --> 01:02:59,293
It's a concept, just a concept.

1096
01:02:59,793 --> 01:03:03,235
I think some of these horrible people must have given you this concept.

1097
01:03:04,526 --> 01:03:05,996
If you really fall in love

1098
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,082
how do you get up to marry another person?

1099
01:03:09,147 --> 01:03:11,598
You fall, marry another person,

1100
01:03:12,249 --> 01:03:14,249
again ready to marry another person.

1101
01:03:14,316 --> 01:03:15,886
You are holding the hand of a person

1102
01:03:15,952 --> 01:03:17,953
who is suppose to be your beloved or whatever it is,

1103
01:03:17,979 --> 01:03:19,979
and looking at another one.

1104
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:24,788
This concept is absolutely wrong. You have to grow in love.

1105
01:03:27,567 --> 01:03:29,567
As your own child is

1106
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:32,834
in the same way is your companion. They are two parts

1107
01:03:33,503 --> 01:03:34,641
of one chariot.

1108
01:03:35,273 --> 01:03:37,922
One is the left and other is the right. They're not

1109
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,930
unequal, they're equal

1110
01:03:40,997 --> 01:03:44,212
but they are not similar, they have their own role.

1111
01:03:44,505 --> 01:03:47,040
And women have to take their role courageously,

1112
01:03:48,011 --> 01:03:50,647
to be the mother, as I always say, look at me.

1113
01:03:51,448 --> 01:03:55,506
I am a Mother and in no way,

1114
01:03:56,797 --> 01:03:58,797
in any way, I cannot think

1115
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:01,128
I could be anything better than this.

1116
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:06,509
Now if I start thinking, Oh God,

1117
01:04:06,651 --> 01:04:08,840
I am a Mother all right, but

1118
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,340
I must know how to drive,

1119
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:15,663
then I'm finished. I must know how to drive a bus,

1120
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:18,370
I must know how to drive a train!

1121
01:04:18,908 --> 01:04:20,022
What is the need?

1122
01:04:21,351 --> 01:04:23,598
I saw one photographer who came to see me.

1123
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,332
He was supposed to take my photograph

1124
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,380
and whole hands were fill with blisters.

1125
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,921
I said first let me cure your blisters.

1126
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,457
How you are going to take my photograph?

1127
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:34,660
I said what have you been doing with your, photography?

1128
01:04:34,727 --> 01:04:37,434
No, he said, this, I went to a forest

1129
01:04:37,633 --> 01:04:39,633
and I cut some trees. I said, for what?

1130
01:04:39,982 --> 01:04:43,086
You are a photographer, your hands are soft and deft

1131
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:45,792
why do you want to kill the deftness of your fingers?

1132
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:49,222
He said, no we must do other things also. I said, why must you?

1133
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,852
You see the nose doesn’t do the work of the eyes

1134
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,900
and the eyes do not do the work of the ears.

1135
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,730
Why must you do, your hands are all finished! And this is what it is.

1136
01:05:00,548 --> 01:05:03,047
To us we feel that men are great

1137
01:05:03,152 --> 01:05:06,001
so we start saying, "let's do the man's work."

1138
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:10,914
The man thinks, why "should women be like this?"

1139
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:12,214
You are companions -

1140
01:05:12,883 --> 01:05:16,376
you are eternal companions. You are two

1141
01:05:18,383 --> 01:05:20,910
beautiful wheels of a chariot.

1142
01:05:22,201 --> 01:05:24,201
This is to be grown

1143
01:05:24,419 --> 01:05:25,912
and to be matured within you.

1144
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,862
And when this centre is out,

1145
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:31,285
you get the problems of this centre

1146
01:05:31,371 --> 01:05:34,076
by which you get asthma, tuberculosis,

1147
01:05:35,593 --> 01:05:37,593
and the breast troubles.

1148
01:05:37,622 --> 01:05:41,228
Men get asthma, very serious asthma and

1149
01:05:41,257 --> 01:05:42,934
other problems of the lungs

1150
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:46,515
and ultimately, also lung cancer can develop.

1151
01:05:48,748 --> 01:05:51,087
When you work too hard with the right hand side,

1152
01:05:51,135 --> 01:05:54,406
you are ego orientated, that is ego develops too much,

1153
01:05:54,473 --> 01:05:56,473
then your left side is neglected,

1154
01:05:56,502 --> 01:05:59,286
you become unemotional, that time

1155
01:05:59,409 --> 01:06:01,409
your heart gives a signal, you get a heart attack.

1156
01:06:02,982 --> 01:06:04,982
When you do too much sometimes

1157
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:07,846
you may escape the heart attack, but you may get

1158
01:06:07,951 --> 01:06:09,247
a  brain paralysis.

1159
01:06:13,174 --> 01:06:16,115
We are bent upon destroying ourselves.

1160
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:19,751
The destruction is going to come from within, not from without.

1161
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,533
Those people who are try to shock you, this will happen,

1162
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:27,168
that the sun is doing this, this is nothing.

1163
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:30,184
It's all within you, the destruction has started.

1164
01:06:30,684 --> 01:06:33,976
You are facing it because

1165
01:06:34,476 --> 01:06:37,838
you cannot accept it.

1166
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:40,429
You have to accept

1167
01:06:41,682 --> 01:06:43,708
that this is a challenge, I am not

1168
01:06:43,737 --> 01:06:46,336
going to allow myself to be destroyed by foolish and stupid

1169
01:06:46,365 --> 01:06:47,631
ideas that are around.

1170
01:06:49,299 --> 01:06:52,097
And then in your own estimation and glory

1171
01:06:52,597 --> 01:06:55,472
you will be surprised. After realisation

1172
01:06:55,482 --> 01:06:57,673
you will be enriched but

1173
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:59,626
without Realisation, I don't know,

1174
01:06:59,712 --> 01:07:02,768
it becomes a lecture and a lecture, just a brainwash.

1175
01:07:03,626 --> 01:07:05,626
That beautiful thing should happen to you,

1176
01:07:05,975 --> 01:07:09,472
and once you find your beauty within yourself,

1177
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,878
overnight I have seen people changed.

1178
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,529
Overnight it happens

1179
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:18,388
and I hope that will happen to you tonight.

1180
01:07:18,888 --> 01:07:22,133
Today I have talked to you about this centre

1181
01:07:22,633 --> 01:07:25,276
and later on I will be talking to you about

1182
01:07:25,682 --> 01:07:28,099
two other centres which are here and here.

1183
01:07:28,317 --> 01:07:30,317
And the Realisation that takes place,

1184
01:07:30,817 --> 01:07:32,817
out of the limbic area,

1185
01:07:33,034 --> 01:07:35,634
in the fontanel membrane,

1186
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:38,491
which is called as the Brahmarandra in Sanskrit language.

1187
01:07:38,991 --> 01:07:40,991
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

1188
01:07:42,546 --> 01:07:45,086
If you have any questions you please ask me.

1189
01:07:47,488 --> 01:07:50,351
But questions should be something

1190
01:07:50,822 --> 01:07:52,989
which are helpful, not some sort of

1191
01:07:53,026 --> 01:07:54,883
quarrel. I am not here to quarrel with you.

1192
01:07:55,214 --> 01:07:57,927
If you don't want your Realisation I am not going to force you.

1193
01:07:58,427 --> 01:08:02,766
Please do not plead for any other organisation or any other guru,

1194
01:08:03,266 --> 01:08:06,393
because I am not interested. I am only interested in you,

1195
01:08:06,743 --> 01:08:08,743
I see that sparkle in you,

1196
01:08:08,816 --> 01:08:11,684
that's why I am only interested in you, I'm not bothered about others.

1197
01:08:12,184 --> 01:08:14,636
So you do not try to bring others ideas

1198
01:08:14,837 --> 01:08:16,663
that this guru has said this or this

1199
01:08:16,683 --> 01:08:18,446
one has said that and this is in the book.

1200
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:21,910
The proof of the pudding is that you haven't got your Realisation.

1201
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,940
If you have got it then you can go out.

1202
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:28,609
If you are sure you have got it, I don't want to force it on you.

1203
01:08:28,724 --> 01:08:30,445
There's no quarrel about anything.

1204
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:32,731
There's no election on, nothing.

1205
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:34,184
You cannot give me anything.

1206
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:37,299
There's no shopping. It's a temple, you have come for a blessing.

1207
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:40,752
All right? Now you can ask the questions. Thank you very much.
