00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,496
﻿Adi Shakti Puja, Detachment, Rahuri (India), 11 December 1988.

2
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:17,775
Puja has to start at the time, when it has to start

3
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,486
I’ve been waiting and waiting and waiting,

4
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,693
then I realised that today is a very good time

5
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:37,222
according to the calendar; but it is not in the morning,

6
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:40,822
so it had to be the third day of the moon

7
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:46,094
and as the moon is changing its phases in the day time,

8
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:48,893
we had to wait till it started. I think,

9
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:56,293
all these things have happened, of the theft and everything has happened, perhaps,

10
00:01:57,023 --> 00:02:01,372
to delay the Puja up to the point where it should start.

11
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:04,751
So in Sahaja Yoga we all go beyond time

12
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:07,643
and we don't have to worry about the timing;

13
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:10,347
only when it's a formal function or something,

14
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,995
because the people are formal and they don't understand our styles.

15
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:18,489
So we have to be present there at right time,

16
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,232
otherwise we should just allow the time to take its own course

17
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:27,237
and we should move in our own way.

18
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:41,491
Now for our travel and this tour, we have to realise

19
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:47,443
that we are here to achieve

20
00:02:47,644 --> 00:02:52,889
a certain amount of height in our detachment,

21
00:02:53,694 --> 00:03:05,237
we have to rise into the realm of our state,

22
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:08,575
while the circumstances around us,

23
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:16,239
they're surrounding us and they should not make us unhappy,

24
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:22,124
or biased, or we should not react to them,

25
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:29,445
on the contrary we should try to rise above that

26
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:36,553
if there are no events of mishaps.

27
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:42,633
Then you cannot see the surmounting quality of the Divine.

28
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:49,610
If the surmounting quality of The Divine has to be seen,

29
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:53,259
we have to see the obstructions.

30
00:03:53,284 --> 00:04:01,564
For example, if there is the flow of the water going on

31
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:05,362
and it is smoothly moving,

32
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:10,347
there's no happening as you call the gatarna,

33
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:15,458
there is no happening, but if there is a stone,

34
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,042
then the water splashes against it,

35
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:24,284
creates a beauty and surpasses it,

36
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:32,875
this is the sign of Divine surmounting all the difficulties

37
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:37,107
that are supposed to be there.

38
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,664
Now we are proceeding to Puna

39
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:45,010
and where we will be having a proper session

40
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,518
also for marriages and all that,

41
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:50,815
we will have to take a firm decision,

42
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:55,240
I must speak about it today,

43
00:04:55,441 --> 00:05:00,616
that the steadiness of the mind is very important for the marriages.

44
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:05,528
If you have certain concepts

45
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:12,814
and if you are whimsical, it's better you don't get married,

46
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:17,607
because that's not found in Indian character,

47
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:21,540
once they decide for marriage they are married forever.

48
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,092
But if the mind is still wavering, going up and down,

49
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:31,834
it's a trick of the mind that wants to play tricks with others and enjoys,

50
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:35,150
it is a sign of ego.

51
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:41,667
Absolutely a sign of ego and then you start playing games,

52
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:45,461
you enjoy it, "yes, no, yes, no",

53
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:48,806
you go on enjoying those games

54
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:51,612
and later on you play into it so much that your marriages

55
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:54,323
can never be happy or successful,

56
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:57,820
that means you are not yet matured for marriage.

57
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:00,313
For marriage you are to be matured.

58
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:03,329
But one of the reasons for this I find in the west is,

59
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,224
that you have had no training at all,

60
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:11,500
parents have never told you how to behave

61
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:14,642
towards your husband, towards your wife,

62
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:17,197
how to make a marriage successful,

63
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:20,330
that is a very important event

64
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:26,874
and that we should try to establish ourselves in the marriage system,

65
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:34,124
instead of that, we use it as a nice trick playing ground,

66
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:38,281
we miss the point, who is the loser?

67
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,047
If you go on playing tricks like this

68
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:46,386
and playing with your ego, whatever you may do,

69
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:50,324
whatever type of marriages you'll have,

70
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:53,421
you can never be happy. Now in the west, as you know,

71
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:59,153
I lead another life also and every person I have met,

72
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:01,933
every person whatever country they may come,

73
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:07,230
nobody seems to be happy in their marriage, is very surprising.

74
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,691
it seems every wife finds something wrong with the husband,

75
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,674
the husband finds something wrong with the wife

76
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:18,947
and they have funny miserable faces,

77
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:24,374
they don't look like married people, but as if like criminals,

78
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:27,491
or something has really gone wrong with them.

79
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:30,783
There's no smile on their face, they look horrid,

80
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:33,514
because they have missed the point,

81
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:37,228
marriage is to be enjoyed, is for your enjoyment.

82
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:47,855
Supposing one gives you ambrosia, Amrut as they call it

83
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:53,594
and then you start playing trick with it. Who is the loser?

84
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,447
So must know that we have to achieved that maturity

85
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:07,629
and enjoy that love, basically if something is very wrong,

86
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:13,735
or if there's no possibility of a proper marriage,

87
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,831
in Sahaja Yoga we have arrangement, to give it up,

88
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,066
you can change your wife, change your husband,

89
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:24,233
no problem, but there must be some reason behind it,

90
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:30,146
just for fun's sake, if you want to spoil your life.

91
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:32,286
I'll try my level best to tell you,

92
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:35,752
that don't spoil your life and of the other person.

93
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:40,455
But people enjoy sometimes, spoiling somebody lives

94
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:42,599
when it comes to the ego part,

95
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,541
they themselves cannot enjoy, dog in the manger policy,

96
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:50,380
dog in the manger cannot eat the grass,

97
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:55,096
but barks at any bull that comes to eat it, it's like this,

98
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:59,765
neither they will enjoy, nor they will allow others to enjoy

99
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:03,076
and when such stupid couples are there,

100
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,087
I have such a headache all the time, reconciling them,

101
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,901
talking to them, asking them,

102
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:12,506
I mean it becomes a marriage bureau for me.

103
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:15,306
And sometimes I reach such a conclusion:

104
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:18,949
no more marriages in Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it!

105
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,905
Actually what have I to gain out of it? This nobody tries to understand,

106
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:26,360
what I am trying is to make you happy

107
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,587
to get you good husbands and good wives,

108
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:30,884
that you should have good relationships,

109
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:34,830
you should have great people on this Earth, to be born,

110
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:37,652
that we should have a society

111
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:41,628
which is beyond all these nonsensical societies

112
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:46,199
which is so great that we can create a homogenous family

113
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,564
among ourselves of purity and of holiness,

114
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:53,370
instead of that, for petty nonsensical things

115
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,772
if there's a fight going on, one gets really fed up.

116
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:02,187
Of course one has to try.

117
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:06,488
But if you are bent upon cutting your noses,

118
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:11,400
how can I go on clipping them back?

119
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:16,932
It's an eternal problem, if you marry your say, 75 people,

120
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:21,242
you have the enjoyment of it. Now if it's a, say,

121
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:27,499
a ocean of, Indian Ocean say for example,

122
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,159
but then you get the Pacific Ocean back on your head

123
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:37,806
with all the cries and weeping and shouting and screaming

124
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:42,338
and all sorts of nonsense that going on.

125
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:47,884
So I again say that, now we are going to Puna

126
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:52,019
where all the marriages are going to be confirmed,

127
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,954
if you go on like this there's no end to it,

128
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,951
also those people who come for marriages

129
00:10:58,151 --> 00:11:02,525
and deny it twice, third time I don't ask them,

130
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:07,157
because it's a joke going on.

131
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,954
You do not know how many nights I have spent selecting people,

132
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:16,519
as it is you are from twenty five, thirty countries.

133
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:21,503
Yesterday you saw that, you have different conditionings,

134
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:25,086
different styles, different everything,

135
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:28,939
heights different, ages different, faces different,

136
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:32,302
aptitudes different.

137
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:36,912
So combine all these things, so very difficult,

138
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:40,115
sometimes I think if you are overeducated,

139
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:42,655
them better to give you a simple woman,

140
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:46,060
so that your little pressure is reduced, you can share

141
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:50,183
with her but if you are equally educated people,

142
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:55,215
then both the heads may be...

143
00:12:01,756 --> 00:12:06,540
So I have to think of many things and of vibrations,

144
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,404
but somehow or other you can defy

145
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,185
and you try to defy it, alright doesnt matter,

146
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:15,777
but who is the loser is the point,

147
00:12:15,978 --> 00:12:18,886
today I had to speak to you about this, because in Sahaj

148
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:22,918
we have to take the way it comes as it comes,

149
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:27,094
whatever comes in our way we should take it.

150
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:29,705
We should not sort of say, I have fallen in love.

151
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:35,311
There's nobody falls in love, it rises in love in Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,675
That is some funny idea, that one must fall in love;

153
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:53,666
because you see that means you must do something sinful,

154
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,724
or something absurd. So many people have told me,

155
00:12:56,924 --> 00:12:59,247
"Mother I have not fallen in love with her."

156
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:02,101
How can you fall in love, you fall into some ditch,

157
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:09,294
or you may fall into some river of something like that.

158
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:14,674
I didn't understand how do you fall in love, it's a solid stuff.

159
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,127
So this absurd idea of falling in love has to be given up,

160
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:32,143
if it means that you have felt the love,

161
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:40,641
or if it means you have the sensitivity of feeling the love

162
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,653
or something I can understand, I'm a little explanatory,

163
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:48,352
but this falling in love business has been going on and on and on.

164
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:50,491
Now I would request you that in Sahaja Yoga

165
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:55,675
we cancel this terminology.

166
00:13:57,197 --> 00:14:03,552
So problems of marriages should not arise in Sahaja Yoga,

167
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:07,569
you have chance for one month to decide for yourself

168
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:12,996
and to find out for yourself. Little bit adjustments and understanding

169
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:18,231
can create such a beautiful world for you.

170
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:23,701
It's just waiting there, but suddenly you decide on some spot,

171
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:28,118
suddenly you're alright I find, at the spur of the moment

172
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:32,322
I find suddenly you say: "No", I say: "What's this?"

173
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:34,916
The horse was going alright suddenly what has happened?

174
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:39,045
it has turned round? One can understand a horse,

175
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:42,248
but I can't understand human beings.

176
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:48,387
So this whimsical behaviour suddenly,

177
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:53,238
can be very injurious to the growth of Sahaja Yoga.

178
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:56,568
Whenever I go to England there's a list of people

179
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:59,010
from all over the country,

180
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:02,291
this marriage has gone rotten, that has gone rotten,

181
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:05,932
that has gone rotten, while I'm boasting to everyone

182
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:08,610
that Sahaja Yoga marriages never fail.

183
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:11,401
I know it's not true,

184
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:15,976
but whatever I say is a Mantra, ultimately it becomes the truth.

185
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:20,908
So time will come when no marriages will fail,

186
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:25,052
but you have to join hands with me and co-operate

187
00:15:25,253 --> 00:15:29,143
and should understand, how much I have worked hard

188
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:33,955
to bring about these events.

189
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:37,770
And marriages should not make you happy or unhappy,

190
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,189
because to marry is not the ultimate in life.

191
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,454
But it happens after marriage people get lost,

192
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,829
they don't come to Sahaja Yoga, after that, we are

193
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:53,045
enjoying our honeymoon for the last three years.

194
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:56,876
Wonderful Sahaja Yogis who are leaders suddenly get lost,

195
00:15:57,076 --> 00:16:00,524
that also may be a fall in love maybe, I don't know,

196
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:04,235
but this kind of nonsense, even if it is one or two

197
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:08,443
its such a headache.

198
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:14,040
And I really don't know how to solve these problems,

199
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:18,183
because I think there's no problem at all,

200
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:23,021
only thing you have decided not to enjoy the game.

201
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:27,638
Supposing you don't want to enjoy the food

202
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:30,327
you can put some quinine on your tongue

203
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:36,337
and then say I don't like the food, something like that. It's absurd.

204
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,840
So try to help me in this,

205
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,389
otherwise I'll give up this marriage business I tell you

206
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:44,921
because it doesn't give me any joy or pleasure.

207
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:50,401
Even one person plays like that I just don't understand.

208
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,373
And for no rhyme and reason you should not say 'no'.

209
00:16:56,574 --> 00:17:00,877
First of all your must look at yourself in the mirror.

210
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,370
What are you?

211
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,950
What is your education? What is your intellect?

212
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,803
What do you expect from another person?

213
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:14,342
How much money you have got? How much money the other person has got?

214
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,669
Whatever you want to see, you can see for yourself,

215
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,361
to begin with, then compare.

216
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:28,106
But the greatest thing you have to think about, how many vibrations you have?

217
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:32,721
How much Sahaja Yoga the other one knows?

218
00:17:32,922 --> 00:17:35,230
You are married for your ascent.

219
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:41,880
If the other person has vibrations much more than yours,

220
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,680
then your should not unnecessarily boast

221
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,573
of nonsensical gross things;

222
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:53,011
the person is much subtler, make yourself that,

223
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:57,270
whether it's a woman or a man I don't say,

224
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:02,345
but I just say that see for yourself: where are you?

225
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:05,595
Specially for beginners who are beginning to take to Sahaja Yoga,

226
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:08,080
is better to marry some mature Sahaja Yogi

227
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,261
so that they can ascend very well, much faster.

228
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:16,020
And also if the other party is not so good, maybe,

229
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,622
we have to work, we have to save that person,

230
00:18:19,822 --> 00:18:24,919
after all, they are not yet matured but they are Sahaja Yogis,

231
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:31,144
they want to do, so try to work it out in that way.

232
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:35,018
I think you will understand the seriousness,

233
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:37,510
this is the most important work

234
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,260
that ever happened on this Earth so far,

235
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,031
your marriages are very important

236
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:50,290
and you have seen the photographs with the Gods themselves have blessed you.

237
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,728
Because of my consent, because of my selection,

238
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:56,073
they all were present in your marriage

239
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:59,312
and how they were giving you tributes

240
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,974
and how they were putting flowers on the brides.

241
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:08,436
You have seen the photographs. If you have not seen I will show you.

242
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:11,557
But if you are not a seeker and if you are not seeking

243
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:14,688
your higher ascent, then you go into

244
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:18,537
nonsensical things and nonsensical ideas.

245
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:22,018
So better be careful not to do such a thing,

246
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:26,861
don't think too much of yourself, another note of caution,

247
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:31,963
that you see the way Indians pamper their son-in-laws,

248
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:34,667
so don't get mad.

249
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:38,136
Also they pamper their daughter-in-laws very much.

250
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:41,588
It's done in India to create better relationships,

251
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:44,572
because we don't have the balloon of ego so much here.

252
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:50,389
But here as soon as somebody pays attention to you, you go off,

253
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,410
so better be careful. It's a custom here

254
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:58,791
to look after the son-in-law, to look after the daughter, there is a custom.

255
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:04,688
Now it is ingrained from ages, it doesn't mean that you are God,

256
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:08,500
or you are in some superlative condition.

257
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:14,350
It's just that, that is how they pamper,

258
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:20,339
they look after the daughter-in-law, or the son-in-law, normally.

259
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,051
And you should not carry away ideas,

260
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,626
which I must tell you because it doesn't happen in the west,

261
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:31,000
I have seen, they don't care. Once that they are married,

262
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:34,683
they are finished, it's not so, so please be careful.

263
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,489
When you are marrying Indians, you will find the parents

264
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:39,851
will quite pamper you, look after you,

265
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:43,533
they'll call you to their house, do this, give you money,

266
00:20:43,733 --> 00:20:49,034
give you ornaments, all kinds of things they'll do.

267
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:55,089
But still one has to understand that is just a custom

268
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:57,238
and should not get pampered, on the contrary should feel

269
00:20:57,438 --> 00:21:01,062
blissful about it, but when it is done I have seen suddenly

270
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:05,087
they go off and they think no end of themselves,

271
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:08,057
their value system goes off.

272
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:11,799
It's because, so far we have had no education,

273
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:15,449
no training about marriages.

274
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:19,799
I am sorry I have to say this in the presence of many Indians.

275
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:23,320
Indians also you see, expect you to understand

276
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:25,481
their customs sometimes too much,

277
00:21:25,682 --> 00:21:27,935
for example yesterday the garlands were given,

278
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:30,530
at the time when the garlands were given,

279
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,428
you are not supposed to garland yourself,

280
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:36,429
but some of you took the garland put it you,

281
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,328
they regarded it as absolutely unmannerly,

282
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:43,609
but it is so, so when we are in India

283
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:46,307
we have to understand Indians,

284
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:50,898
but when we are in the west we have to understand the western people.

285
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:53,413
For example in the west you just go on saying, thank you,

286
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:57,193
thank, thank you, sorry, sorry sorry, sorry sorry sorry,

287
00:21:57,393 --> 00:21:59,585
it is so confusing sometimes.

288
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:02,559
We have to go on shaking hands with so many people,

289
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,779
I mean, I sometimes shake with nine hundred people at a time,

290
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:11,112
and while they are going back again nine hundred people.

291
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:14,114
I think namaste is a better idea.

292
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:17,192
See to shake hands with every sort of a person,

293
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:21,007
you'll catch from every one, but is a custom,

294
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,211
it's custom so we have to understand this is a custom

295
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:29,016
and which is not to be resented, is not such a bad custom.

296
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:33,453
There's nothing wrong in it and maybe there is no logic.

297
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:36,149
For example garlanding yourself there is little logic,

298
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:39,936
you don't garland yourself, somebody else has to garland

299
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:42,707
and the ladies don't take garlands on their,

300
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:45,605
you see, because any man cannot garland a lady,

301
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:48,652
because is only husband has the right,

302
00:22:48,852 --> 00:22:51,250
see, so anyone won't garland,

303
00:22:51,451 --> 00:22:55,295
or a son can garland the mother, but any man

304
00:22:55,496 --> 00:23:00,806
cannot garland any lady who is of a younger age,

305
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:04,497
or who is not yet married and even if married,

306
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:08,245
she has to be an old woman like me, then it's alright,

307
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:12,366
so these are customs very much ingrained and it's best or logic

308
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:16,767
that you cannot garland yourself and walk on the street,

309
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:21,124
even if the leaders here are garlanded

310
00:23:21,324 --> 00:23:24,417
immediately they take out their garland, except for the Gods,

311
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:29,618
I mean I can carry with my garland but I also take it out,

312
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:34,064
so these are few customs which must be understood

313
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:36,765
and there's nothing wrong in it, there's logic,

314
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:39,883
whatever is illogical we can give up,

315
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:44,342
whatever is logical we have to lake it and understand it.

316
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,711
So I am just telling you, that yesterday they started laughing,

317
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,862
children also started laughing, because they thought

318
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:52,394
they are garlanding themselves.

319
00:23:52,595 --> 00:23:57,380
it's like doing Aarti to yourself, you know,

320
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,762
amounts to that.

321
00:23:59,962 --> 00:24:03,033
So you can understand why they were laughing.

322
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:08,635
They didn't mean to hurt you in any way, but this is the system.

323
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:12,511
Now coming to Sahaja Yoga,

324
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:16,417
yesterday was, Left Vishuddhi was too much.

325
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:20,580
Perhaps in the morning I said you were allvery late

326
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:23,765
for the formal programme, I don't know,

327
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:27,768
whatever I say has to be just listened to, that's all.

328
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:30,137
Only thing is next time we should not be late,

329
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:33,270
in any formal programme, but it seems such a

330
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,652
Left Vishuddhi was there that I got a lump here

331
00:24:36,853 --> 00:24:38,932
and I just knew what it was.

332
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:43,297
So Mother says to you things which should not hurt you in any way

333
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:46,774
and you should not take it that seriously but should understand that

334
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:49,084
next time we should not do so, otherwise

335
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:53,050
you are all wonderful people. You are beautiful people,

336
00:24:53,344 --> 00:24:55,266
I love you, I adore you, not only that,

337
00:24:55,442 --> 00:24:59,153
but I am very proud of you. I'm extremely proud of you,

338
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:01,428
but I have to tell you something sometimes.

339
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:05,276
But if I tell you even wee bit then if you, get that upset,

340
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:09,039
I don't know what should I do.

341
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,024
So not to take things that seriously.

342
00:25:13,225 --> 00:25:16,579
There's nothing so much wrong.

343
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:20,072
In general I have to tell you things which you should understand

344
00:25:20,272 --> 00:25:23,068
it's for our good, for our enjoyment,

345
00:25:23,093 --> 00:25:26,123
everything to increase your enjoyment.

346
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:30,516
Even your ascent in Sahaja Yoga is to increase your enjoyment,

347
00:25:30,632 --> 00:25:35,186
your sensitivity to joy to increase it more and more,

348
00:25:35,504 --> 00:25:38,504
all this is done.

349
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:43,298
