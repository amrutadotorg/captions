WEBVTT

00:00.089 --> 00:16.630
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri
Krishna’s incarnation.

00:16.630 --> 00:26.650
As you know that Shri Krishna is the incarnation
of Narayana, of Shri Vishnu.

00:26.650 --> 00:36.620
So in every incarnation they carry all their
qualities, all their powers and all their

00:36.620 --> 00:41.280
nature with them.

00:41.280 --> 00:55.680
So when He incarnated He had all the qualities
of Narayana and then that of Rama, but every

00:55.680 --> 01:09.200
incarnation tries to rectify whatever in their
previous life has been misunderstood and have

01:09.200 --> 01:14.539
been carried to the extremes.

01:14.539 --> 01:32.719
That’s why they have to come back again
and again.

01:32.719 --> 01:45.630
So as Shri Vishnu, when He thought of taking
His incarnation, because He is the one who

01:45.630 --> 01:47.590
is the preserver.

01:47.590 --> 02:03.859
He’s the preserver of this creation and
also the preserver of dharma.

02:03.859 --> 02:14.410
So when He took His incarnation He had to
see that people keep to their dharma.

02:14.410 --> 02:24.910
By keeping the dharma all right only, you
could get your realization.

02:24.910 --> 02:33.849
So the job was quite difficult one, I should
say, to keep people in the central path of

02:33.849 --> 02:37.989
Mahalakshmi.

02:37.989 --> 02:52.890
So by first incarnation, you can say that,
He tried to create a benevolent king, as Shri

02:52.890 --> 02:53.890
Rama.

02:53.890 --> 02:57.060
Socrates has described a benevolent king.

02:57.060 --> 03:05.890
But as a result of that, people started thinking
if they have become queen and king, born in

03:05.890 --> 03:16.079
the family of royalty, then they are gods.

03:16.079 --> 03:22.780
Shri Rama was the Purushottama – means He
was the best among all the human beings.

03:22.780 --> 03:31.269
That means He incarnated as a human being,
total human being, showing all the qualities

03:31.269 --> 03:33.400
of human beings.

03:33.400 --> 03:46.329
Like He was, He married the Lakshmi principle
that was Sita, and then also He lived a normal

03:46.329 --> 03:47.329
married life.

03:47.329 --> 03:57.900
When He gave Her up He lived like an ascetic
to show how a man should lead his life in

03:57.900 --> 04:02.110
a proper dharma as a married man.

04:02.110 --> 04:11.529
And even when the wife has gone away, how
He was leading a life of complete chastity.

04:11.529 --> 04:16.530
And He never had another marriage, though
many people said that “You should have another

04:16.530 --> 04:19.130
marriage.”

04:19.130 --> 04:31.840
So the system that was the best, to have a
monogamy, He followed it.

04:31.840 --> 04:39.790
By His life, He showed how a husband should
be with his wife.

04:39.790 --> 04:44.530
But then later on He had another role as the
king.

04:44.530 --> 04:52.870
When He became the king then He found out
that people were criticizing Him because He

04:52.870 --> 04:57.520
brought Sita back from Ravana.

04:57.520 --> 05:04.580
So Shri Rama decided to send Her away from
Him.

05:04.580 --> 05:13.270
How many people in this world, who are in
power, would be that sensible about that power

05:13.270 --> 05:21.250
that they have, that they have to behave in
a manner that they should be ideals, for all

05:21.250 --> 05:26.780
other people who are working under them, for
the administration, for looking after the

05:26.780 --> 05:28.560
country?

05:28.560 --> 05:40.520
But Sitaji also, because She was also Mahalakshmi,
She understood everything, the whole play,

05:40.520 --> 05:49.479
and She went away and then Shri Rama also
taught how to rule the people.

05:49.479 --> 05:53.729
So they say the most ideal kingdom was Ramaraj.

05:53.729 --> 06:04.379
When Rama ruled this world there was peace,
no competitions, everyone was joyous and happy

06:04.379 --> 06:17.449
because He was the one who was emitting fair
play and dharma, joy, bliss and peace.

06:17.449 --> 06:24.990
So there was no need to have any struggle,
no competition, no fighting, nothing.

06:24.990 --> 06:34.259
So this Benevolent King came as a incarnation
to show us how a king should be, and He lead

06:34.259 --> 06:43.360
a life of a serious type, very dedicated and
serious type of life, how a benevolent king

06:43.360 --> 06:45.080
should be.

06:45.080 --> 06:55.050
As a result of His incarnation – always
people take to something, something which

06:55.050 --> 06:58.290
is not normal.

06:58.290 --> 07:07.690
So because He lived as an ascetic people started
following asceticism.

07:07.690 --> 07:14.740
“We’ll not marry, we’ll not have our
wives, we’ll live like Rama,” all these

07:14.740 --> 07:18.379
things they started, so asceticism grew up.

07:18.379 --> 07:25.210
Before that, before Shri Rama all the saints
used to marry, they used to have wives they

07:25.210 --> 07:28.440
used to have children, they lived a very normal
life.

07:28.440 --> 07:34.169
Only they were saints because they were very
highly evolved people and they lived in ashrams

07:34.169 --> 07:44.310
doing the work of realization and also other
corrections in human beings.

07:44.310 --> 07:55.300
Now when Shri Rama came, people thought that
“He was Shri Rama, so let us be like Him.

07:55.300 --> 07:59.810
Because He lived like an ascetic let us also
live like an ascetic.”

07:59.810 --> 08:10.180
So this foolish idea of asceticism crawled
in and then people became very austere type,

08:10.180 --> 08:12.849
very austere.

08:12.849 --> 08:19.800
Nobody would laugh, nobody would smile, everything
was very serious, absolutely, and everything

08:19.800 --> 08:24.610
was done in a very dry manner.

08:24.610 --> 08:32.380
So many seekers did not marry but apart from
seekers many seers and saints also did not

08:32.380 --> 08:39.010
marry and because they had no balance, because
marriage gives you a balance, they became

08:39.010 --> 08:46.650
very dry people, very hot tempered people,
and we have some examples of some rishis who

08:46.650 --> 08:55.750
are known for their hot temper and their ascetic
qualities by which they could destroy anyone,

08:55.750 --> 09:01.580
make them into ashes – in Sanskrit it’s
called as Bhasma Karoti.

09:01.580 --> 09:13.030
So these qualities developed, that is the
time Shri Krishna came back, from Shri Rama’s

09:13.030 --> 09:16.720
incarnation He came back as Shri Krishna.

09:16.720 --> 09:29.020
Sri Krishna’s incarnation came to show that
this whole Creation is fun, is Leela.

09:29.020 --> 09:32.760
That’s why He’s Leeladhar, He’s called
as Leeladhara.

09:32.760 --> 09:44.351
He was the one who showed that everything
is fun, there’s nothing to be serious, nothing

09:44.351 --> 09:49.340
to be dry, nothing to be ascetic but the whole
life is a fun.

09:49.340 --> 09:57.010
He gave this idea because people had become
so austere.

09:57.010 --> 10:05.470
And then also a kind of a funny Brahminism
started, like they would not eat, they created

10:05.470 --> 10:09.100
a caste system which started developing.

10:09.100 --> 10:15.880
The caste was determined by birth, which was
wrong, and they could not eat food.

10:15.880 --> 10:22.890
Then the Brahminism started growing up, quite
strong, and these Brahmins started dominating

10:22.890 --> 10:24.410
others.

10:24.410 --> 10:43.780
So Shri Krishna came and He came as a son
of a milkman (gwale ki ladke).

10:43.780 --> 10:53.950
But they were rich milkmen, very rich milkmen.

10:53.950 --> 11:03.800
Now that is the time, you see, the whole play
was brought forth, and the play was quite

11:03.800 --> 11:17.790
cruel I should say, because one horrible devil,
rakshasa, somehow or other used a lady who

11:17.790 --> 11:34.690
was mother of Kamsa, and she is the mother
also of, you can say grandmother of Shri Krishna.

11:34.690 --> 11:42.080
So she had a son who was also a rakshasa,
so it’s all a play of the same.

11:42.080 --> 11:51.630
So He had an uncle who was a devil, who was
a rakshasa and He was supposed to kill this

11:51.630 --> 11:57.170
uncle – see the play, this is a drama all,
just see the drama as it worked out.

11:57.170 --> 12:05.080
He was supposed to kill this uncle who was
very powerful and who was a devil.

12:05.080 --> 12:20.680
So in His childhood He used to play, He used
to play with milkmaids and with other ladies.

12:20.680 --> 12:24.340
He was very young, He was about five years
of age.

12:24.340 --> 12:32.670
And He did all kinds of pranks and He did
all kinds of leelas, like He killed one snake,

12:32.670 --> 12:38.170
very big snake – a cobra – very well known
cobra.

12:38.170 --> 12:47.880
And also He killed many rakshasas and rakshasinis
with His power – in a play.

12:47.880 --> 12:53.140
Just in a play, He used to do it, and you
must have read the stories about Him – how

12:53.140 --> 12:59.890
He showed that there is no need to have a
big army of people as Shri Rama had – He

12:59.890 --> 13:07.910
didn’t use any monkeys or anyone, though
Hanumana was always, was sitting on His chariot.

13:07.910 --> 13:12.460
But He never used all these outside powers.

13:12.460 --> 13:22.250
Only whatever He had the weapons that He used,
to show that there is no need to use any army

13:22.250 --> 13:29.750
or other people to kill a rakshasa.

13:29.750 --> 13:33.040
And all was in a very playful manner.

13:33.040 --> 13:44.370
At the time of Shri Rama He was not supposed
to know that He was an incarnation but it

13:44.370 --> 13:53.500
was reflected to Him by various methods that
He was an incarnation and still He would not

13:53.500 --> 13:56.740
accept it because He was not supposed to know.

13:56.740 --> 14:01.880
It’s something like Mahamaya.

14:01.880 --> 14:12.930
But say all the cameras are now giving you
all the evidence of the real Mahamaya, what

14:12.930 --> 14:15.930
She is like.

14:15.930 --> 14:23.040
But one may try to show that you don’t remember,
you don’t have, you have no memory of it.

14:23.040 --> 14:29.760
Because if you remember it then your action
would not be human, they would become divine

14:29.760 --> 14:36.250
actions, and that may be not all right for
human beings because they won’t be able

14:36.250 --> 14:42.990
to stand, or they’ll be frightened, they’ll
be such an awe.

14:42.990 --> 14:50.380
So Shri Krishna normally behaved like a very
ordinary person.

14:50.380 --> 14:57.310
Like in His childhood, He was very fond of
butter.

14:57.310 --> 14:59.950
And as you know butter is very good for the
throat.

14:59.950 --> 15:05.500
For Vishuddhi I’ve told you many-a-times
that on your tea you put some butter and take

15:05.500 --> 15:10.320
it so that your throat which is dried out
will feel better.

15:10.320 --> 15:19.760
So He was very fond of butter and He would
go and make His friends help Him, and made

15:19.760 --> 15:26.560
a pyramid out of them, would climb up and
break the butter container and would eat all

15:26.560 --> 15:28.530
that butter like a little baby.

15:28.530 --> 15:32.330
So one day His mother said, “All right,
why did you eat butter?”

15:32.330 --> 15:33.690
He said, “I never ate.”

15:33.690 --> 15:35.950
She said, “Then what is this on your mouth?”

15:35.950 --> 15:39.440
He said, “This is, all these boys have put
it on my mouth.”

15:39.440 --> 15:44.550
You see, to Him, even telling such little,
little lies also was a fun, with the mother

15:44.550 --> 15:45.550
to that extent.

15:45.550 --> 15:47.100
Like “don’t tell lies!

15:47.100 --> 15:48.140
You must not!”

15:48.140 --> 15:50.720
No, there was no fun in this kind of thing.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.790
So He told her a lie.

15:52.790 --> 15:55.820
“See now, these people have put it on my
mouth.

15:55.820 --> 16:02.690
They have eaten all the butter and now I am
the one you are catching!” you see.

16:02.690 --> 16:05.030
So she said, “Really?

16:05.030 --> 16:07.370
Open your mouth!”

16:07.370 --> 16:14.120
So He opened His mouth and there She saw all
this [universe] (Mother points to the solar

16:14.120 --> 16:16.680
system which is part of the puja decoration
backdrop) in the mouth.

16:16.680 --> 16:20.880
The whole universe moving in the Vishuddhi,
the complete Vishuddhi chakra she saw, and

16:20.880 --> 16:22.270
she just bowed to Him.

16:22.270 --> 16:29.830
Then He says, “Why are you bowing to Me?”
as if nothing has happened.

16:29.830 --> 16:43.220
So, you see, all His pranks and all His childish,
sweet lies, were just to create a feeling

16:43.220 --> 16:52.630
of understanding, and it’s regarded as something
very sweet, according to the Indians, or we

16:52.630 --> 16:57.770
can say according to the eastern ideas, that
children are naughty like that with the mother.

16:57.770 --> 17:03.980
They all enjoy the naughtiness of the children,
little naughtiness here, naughtiness there.

17:03.980 --> 17:16.360
And the strictness of children to a great
extent, also is there because, I think, people

17:16.360 --> 17:17.421
are not attached to their children.

17:17.421 --> 17:19.019
They don’t love their children.

17:19.019 --> 17:24.790
They love their carpets, love everything else
because they can sell it, but they can’t

17:24.790 --> 17:27.250
sell their children.

17:27.250 --> 17:30.679
And that kills the joy.

17:30.679 --> 17:39.669
So the children and the parents are separated
by materialistic ideas that this material

17:39.669 --> 17:43.529
is more important than their own children.

17:43.529 --> 17:48.340
So in His childhood He has shown lots of pranks
and lot of things, and the way He used to

17:48.340 --> 17:49.980
steal also.

17:49.980 --> 17:52.220
Now stealing is supposed to be bad.

17:52.220 --> 17:57.019
Some, belongs to somebody else, if you steal,
is bad.

17:57.019 --> 18:01.080
But He was stealing only the butter of His
mother that He had made them.

18:01.080 --> 18:06.950
And He used to steal the butter of all the
ladies who used to take down to Mathura, where

18:06.950 --> 18:14.500
Kamsa was ruling, and this butter was eaten
by all the rakshasas there and they were becoming

18:14.500 --> 18:16.240
very powerful.

18:16.240 --> 18:21.370
So He thought best thing is to go and eat
all the butter so that these ladies won’t

18:21.370 --> 18:23.639
be able to go and sell it.

18:23.639 --> 18:31.899
Also if you see it significantly is this that
we starve our children, we starve our families,

18:31.899 --> 18:32.899
just to have some money.

18:32.899 --> 18:39.970
Money orientation is there, that you can go
and sell your butter to somebody.

18:39.970 --> 18:45.600
With this idea – everything to be sold out,
we have to sell out this, we have to sell

18:45.600 --> 18:47.090
out that.

18:47.090 --> 18:50.889
Nothing is going to be kept with ourselves.

18:50.889 --> 18:58.980
So the children are the only permanent liabilities,
so the children are treated as if they are

18:58.980 --> 19:04.090
just burdens while all other things are good
because you can sell it.

19:04.090 --> 19:10.080
So the whole value system, if it runs down
to money, then children have no place in the

19:10.080 --> 19:11.710
family.

19:11.710 --> 19:22.789
According to Sahaja Yoga, children are more
important than all the wealth of the world

19:22.789 --> 19:25.519
and they are to be looked after that way.

19:25.519 --> 19:30.730
Of course they should be told what is dignity
is, how to behave themselves.

19:30.730 --> 19:35.769
But their little, little pranks are to be
understood and enjoyed because only as children

19:35.769 --> 19:41.450
they can do pranks, not as grown ups, so they
should have that much freedom to play pranks

19:41.450 --> 19:45.029
and to play some tricks on you.

19:45.029 --> 19:51.710
Otherwise, they’ll become very serious people
and might become ascetic.

19:51.710 --> 19:58.279
Those parents who are very strict, their children
are never normal; they either are extremely

19:58.279 --> 20:08.100
perverse, rebellious or they are quiet down
and they cannot face life.

20:08.100 --> 20:16.470
So both are of the same style because one
cannot face life another cannot be faced by

20:16.470 --> 20:17.470
life.

20:17.470 --> 20:18.470
It’s like this.

20:18.470 --> 20:19.470
Nobody can face such people.

20:19.470 --> 20:23.610
So you have to treat you children with great
love and understanding but they should know

20:23.610 --> 20:27.549
if they misbehave then this love will be finished.

20:27.549 --> 20:29.340
So children only care for love.

20:29.340 --> 20:30.549
They don’t know money.

20:30.549 --> 20:31.760
They don’t know anything.

20:31.760 --> 20:37.499
So the love that is you establish in your
child becomes very precious thing.

20:37.499 --> 20:45.380
So the system of Sahaja Yoga is based on divine
love and it can only work when people are

20:45.380 --> 20:46.380
loving.

20:46.380 --> 20:51.779
If they love money, if they love power, if
they love their reputation, they love this,

20:51.779 --> 20:58.519
love that, and not their own children or their
families then they are absolutely losing a

20:58.519 --> 21:05.299
very big part of the society and God knows
what’s going to happen to these children

21:05.299 --> 21:07.659
if you do not have love for your children.

21:07.659 --> 21:12.379
In Shri Krishna’s life, you can see various
things He has shown.

21:12.379 --> 21:22.559
In His, you can say in His epic or in His
biography if you see, you will find how many

21:22.559 --> 21:27.419
facets of life He has handled with such beauty.

21:27.419 --> 21:36.190
Then in His childhood, then He goes and kills
the devil of Kamsa.

21:36.190 --> 21:40.330
That too, how beautifully He does it.

21:40.330 --> 21:43.509
How He kills the people who are surrounding
Him.

21:43.509 --> 21:53.120
How He knows their secrets, how they can be
killed, it shows complete brilliance and very

21:53.120 --> 21:57.600
beautiful organizing the whole thing.

21:57.600 --> 22:07.720
Now imagine one Krishna fought, one Krishna
fought the whole army of that Kamsa, how He

22:07.720 --> 22:11.899
must have done it, because after all He’s
Viraat.

22:11.899 --> 22:19.750
And the, all the powers that are of this all-pervading
Power are in His hands.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.309
He can do whatever He likes.

22:21.309 --> 22:24.740
He can play around as He likes.

22:24.740 --> 22:33.990
He can finish off anybody He wants, and it
is so easy for Him to manage all these things

22:33.990 --> 22:35.270
simultaneously.

22:35.270 --> 22:39.140
Then came His life when He became the king.

22:39.140 --> 22:48.169
When He became the king He wanted, I should
say in a way that, He wanted to establish

22:48.169 --> 22:53.879
people in dharma and He needed the help of
the five elements.

22:53.879 --> 23:00.910
So He made them into five ladies whom He married;
so He has five wives but they are five elements,

23:00.910 --> 23:03.279
part and parcel of His being.

23:03.279 --> 23:11.470
But He was Yogeshwara, absolutely detached
in His yoga, but He had, for practical purposes

23:11.470 --> 23:13.570
we can say, five wives.

23:13.570 --> 23:18.899
And they were sixteen thousand women who became
His wives.

23:18.899 --> 23:24.090
These sixteen thousand women are nothing but
His sixteen thousand powers because you know

23:24.090 --> 23:34.390
His chakras they have got sixteen petals and
these sixteen petals multiplied by the Virata’s

23:34.390 --> 23:40.379
one thousand petals each – so it comes to
sixteen thousand powers.

23:40.379 --> 23:47.320
So these sixteen thousand powers were incarnated
as women, were taken away by some horrible

23:47.320 --> 23:52.619
king and He went there, fought that king and
brought these ladies.

23:52.619 --> 24:00.870
Now, even now it is so that even an old man,
has a young lady with Him, people will never

24:00.870 --> 24:01.960
think that there is good relationship.

24:01.960 --> 24:05.179
They’ll always think there must be something
wrong.

24:05.179 --> 24:09.940
So He had to marry them, because He had to
keep these ladies, so He married them.

24:09.940 --> 24:14.799
But mother’s position is different because
mother can have thousand children.

24:14.799 --> 24:20.970
But poor man, even if he has one woman around
him, everybody will say he’s a bad person.

24:20.970 --> 24:26.700
So He had to marry all of them, so-called
marriage, and these sixteen thousand powers

24:26.700 --> 24:34.679
stayed with Him by which He established our
Vishuddhi Chakra.

24:34.679 --> 24:40.320
Now when we have our Vishuddhi problems we
have to know what are the deities on both

24:40.320 --> 24:44.940
the sides and what were their qualities which
are lacking in us – that’s why we are

24:44.940 --> 24:45.940
suffering.

24:45.940 --> 24:55.419
Let’s see the right side Vishuddhi when
we catch.

24:55.419 --> 25:05.259
Shri Krishna’s essence is sweetness – madhuriya,
madhuriya.

25:05.259 --> 25:06.529
And His power was Radha.

25:06.529 --> 25:11.389
“Ra” is energy “dha,” means the one
who has sustained the energy.

25:11.389 --> 25:14.450
And Her power was, She was called as Ahlada.

25:14.450 --> 25:17.929
“Ahlada” means joy giving qualities She
had.

25:17.929 --> 25:26.690
So Shri Krishna’s qualities were that He
was Yogeshwara, so He was the witness and

25:26.690 --> 25:27.789
sweetness.

25:27.789 --> 25:39.710
Now a person who shouts and screams and talks
loudly and loses his temper in a very loud

25:39.710 --> 25:48.830
voice, or who speaks very loudly all the time,
they all suffer from the right Vishuddhi..

25:48.830 --> 25:54.799
So one should understand that even when you
have to scold somebody, you have to just say,

25:54.799 --> 25:55.799
“What are you doing?

25:55.799 --> 25:56.799
Why are you doing like this?”

25:56.799 --> 26:01.350
Otherwise “I give you, oh do like this?”

26:01.350 --> 26:02.350
Finished!

26:02.350 --> 26:03.730
Right Vishuddhi over.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.519
It’s finished now.

26:05.519 --> 26:11.100
So for the right Vishuddhi we use the mantra
of Vitthala and Rukmini, these two persons.

26:11.100 --> 26:16.820
You see it is very significant that also,
because they say that there was a pundalikaksh,

26:16.820 --> 26:21.100
one boy who was serving his parents.

26:21.100 --> 26:29.970
And his parents were sleeping, he was pressing
their feet when Vitthala and His power Rukmini,

26:29.970 --> 26:32.360
they appeared in the door.

26:32.360 --> 26:35.059
But he said, “Now keep quiet.

26:35.059 --> 26:38.590
My parents are sleeping so you stay there!”

26:38.590 --> 26:44.789
So he had one brick near him which he threw
and asked them, “You stay on that.”

26:44.789 --> 26:50.539
So They kept quiet, They kept quiet because
they are sleeping.

26:50.539 --> 26:52.960
Now this is the thing is.

26:52.960 --> 27:04.640
On the right side if you are talking loudly,
if you talk too much, if you intimidate people

27:04.640 --> 27:09.799
with your talking then you catch on right
Vishuddhi.

27:09.799 --> 27:16.369
So for that best is to take some rest and
give some rest to your right Vishuddhi by

27:16.369 --> 27:18.649
stopping your talk.

27:18.649 --> 27:21.539
Go into mauna they say, just don’t talk.

27:21.539 --> 27:26.389
For some time if you don’t talk you will
see that your Vishuddhi will be improved,

27:26.389 --> 27:28.820
your problems will be improved.

27:28.820 --> 27:35.129
So as it happens, the right side, what happens
is that the heat starts coming from the stomach.

27:35.129 --> 27:37.879
It’s all in one play.

27:37.879 --> 27:44.690
From the, we can say, not from the stomach
but actually from the liver, the heat starts

27:44.690 --> 27:45.690
rising.

27:45.690 --> 27:51.659
It first goes into right heart, as a result
you might become a very hot-tempered husband

27:51.659 --> 27:53.299
or a father or something.

27:53.299 --> 27:56.360
You might get asthma, anything, with that
right heart.

27:56.360 --> 27:59.429
Then it passes on to your right Vishuddhi.

27:59.429 --> 28:05.149
When it goes to your right Vishuddhi then
you become a very irritable, hot-tempered

28:05.149 --> 28:06.149
person.

28:06.149 --> 28:08.249
All the time you shout at someone.

28:08.249 --> 28:09.610
Nobody can talk to you.

28:09.610 --> 28:12.590
If somebody has to talk to you, he has to
use a barge pole in between.

28:12.590 --> 28:14.700
God knows what time he’ll shout at you.

28:14.700 --> 28:20.539
Or maybe, I’ve seen many women lose their
hearing or men lose their hearing when there

28:20.539 --> 28:22.879
is somebody who is shouting at them.

28:22.879 --> 28:29.350
So shouting is a very bad thing for others
and also for yourself because, of course,

28:29.350 --> 28:34.780
your Vishuddhi goes out, after some time you
voice goes out, after some time you cannot

28:34.780 --> 28:39.029
talk, and sometimes they have to just keep
quiet.

28:39.029 --> 28:47.499
But for others it’s even worse because if
you use your anger in that manner then that

28:47.499 --> 28:53.259
person might be just frightened of you, might
develop inferiority complex, might become

28:53.259 --> 28:59.460
a left sided person, might catch some bhoots
or God knows what can happen to a person who

28:59.460 --> 29:03.279
has somebody all the time shouting at him.

29:03.279 --> 29:07.190
But the worst physical thing could be that
he could become deaf.

29:07.190 --> 29:16.200
So from Shri Krishna’s life one has to learn
that how He would just play His flute and

29:16.200 --> 29:27.759
the whole atmosphere used to become absolutely
quiet, without any ripple of any trouble,

29:27.759 --> 29:35.919
any idea of disturbance, just peaceful.

29:35.919 --> 29:39.419
But in modern times the other way round.

29:39.419 --> 29:43.730
They have the music where the right Vishuddhi
is about to break or burst.

29:43.730 --> 29:46.769
I don’t know what sort of a music it is.

29:46.769 --> 29:54.580
When they listen to this music, you see, then
it excites, then it excites you.

29:54.580 --> 29:57.230
It doesn’t make you peaceful.

29:57.230 --> 30:00.789
It excites you, excites you more and more.

30:00.789 --> 30:09.379
But, as Shri Krishna becomes Virata, your
limbic area also gets numbed with it.

30:09.379 --> 30:16.370
And when this shouting music is too much then
they have to use loud speakers and shout much

30:16.370 --> 30:17.370
more.

30:17.370 --> 30:22.509
Then they have to put something near the ear
to hear something otherwise they have no excitement.

30:22.509 --> 30:31.710
All the exciting, we can say all the exciting
cells become numbed.

30:31.710 --> 30:40.200
And you have to really go in for tremendous
effort to create that excitement in those

30:40.200 --> 30:42.320
numbed cells.

30:42.320 --> 30:47.929
So it’s very dangerous throughout, if you
see that it starts from the liver, goes to

30:47.929 --> 30:53.929
the right heart, then to Vishuddhi and then
in the brain.

30:53.929 --> 30:59.309
So then you take to drugs because your brain
is numbed out.

30:59.309 --> 31:05.200
So you take to drugs and when you take to
drugs then you feel that you are all right.

31:05.200 --> 31:10.049
Then again you feel that this drug is not
sufficient then you take stronger drugs.

31:10.049 --> 31:11.330
Then you take more drugs.

31:11.330 --> 31:13.220
It goes on one after another.

31:13.220 --> 31:18.019
Ultimately, it reaches a stage when you are
nowhere.

31:18.019 --> 31:25.320
So it is all self-destructive.

31:25.320 --> 31:42.830
(Shri Mataji coughs) I am also using My right
Vishuddhi too much.

31:42.830 --> 31:55.340
For right Visuddhi you have to learn to have
mauna, means silence.

31:55.340 --> 32:00.450
Those who think, who are very dominating,
who are talking in a very dominating manner,

32:00.450 --> 32:07.700
whose right Vishuddhi is catching, should
become silent and should, at least for some

32:07.700 --> 32:10.669
time, should not talk at all.

32:10.669 --> 32:17.149
Maybe you might fix one day, say you can do
it on a … say “I’ll not talk on Monday.”

32:17.149 --> 32:22.080
But supposing Monday you have to work, so
you should say “I’ll not talk on Sunday.”

32:22.080 --> 32:26.132
But human beings are such that if they decide
that they will not talk on Sunday, then Sunday

32:26.132 --> 32:35.200
they will talk the most!

32:35.200 --> 32:41.120
And this shouting and then intimidating people
– you have no right.

32:41.120 --> 32:45.919
You have no business to shout at anyone whatsoever.

32:45.919 --> 32:48.059
What is the need to shout?

32:48.059 --> 32:52.169
After all, you are a human being, another
one is a human being.

32:52.169 --> 32:58.139
God has not given anybody whether it is a
husband, wife, children or anyone.

32:58.139 --> 33:03.330
But I find even these days children shout,
the mother shouts, the father shouts.

33:03.330 --> 33:08.340
If you go in the house, you feel like running
back because you’ll find, hear, nothing

33:08.340 --> 33:11.559
but shouts.

33:11.559 --> 33:17.739
So this kind of a family system will rock,
completely finish that family and there will

33:17.739 --> 33:24.909
be no beautiful relationship between each
other and between the other people.

33:24.909 --> 33:30.049
Sometimes who can say, the whole country is
having nothing but shouting at one and shouting

33:30.049 --> 33:31.049
at another.

33:31.049 --> 33:33.830
All over you go you find nothing but shouting.

33:33.830 --> 33:39.590
Even if you take your car little bit this
side there will be a shouting, I mean.

33:39.590 --> 33:44.519
For the slightest excuse, they start shouting
and spoiling their right Vishuddhi.

33:44.519 --> 33:50.539
Now, for politicians, they think it’s the
best way to shout because they can really

33:50.539 --> 33:53.960
impress people by their shouts you see.

33:53.960 --> 33:57.700
So they shout a lot, tell people this that.

33:57.700 --> 34:01.470
When they speak, you should hear there’s
no sweetness in their tongue, nothing of the

34:01.470 --> 34:02.470
kind.

34:02.470 --> 34:05.429
But they shout and by shouting a person gets
frightened.

34:05.429 --> 34:06.679
“All right, you want the vote?

34:06.679 --> 34:08.190
We’ll give you but don’t shout.”

34:08.190 --> 34:14.060
That’s how many people get elected and become
big and think that they are very successful

34:14.060 --> 34:15.520
because they have been shouting (laughter).

34:15.520 --> 34:22.130
Then they have training for shouting and they
go in for higher and higher education in shouting,

34:22.130 --> 34:29.190
how to shout, how to intimidate people by
the loud voices.

34:29.190 --> 34:33.890
For Sahaja Yogis it doesn’t behove.

34:33.890 --> 34:40.429
Sahaja Yogi has to be a very sweet person
to talk, extremely sweet.

34:40.429 --> 34:51.850
Now when you are thinking of, say, Shri Rama
as a person who was a king, and then you have

34:51.850 --> 34:55.620
got Shri Krishna who was a diplomat.

34:55.620 --> 34:59.280
So what is the divine diplomacy?

34:59.280 --> 35:03.160
You don’t have to shout, but you change
the subject.

35:03.160 --> 35:14.200
If you want to bring somebody to a, some,
conclusion – then best thing is first you

35:14.200 --> 35:20.490
change the subject and gradually, if you are
clever enough, then you go on changing, changing

35:20.490 --> 35:24.970
and you bring it back to the right thing.

35:24.970 --> 35:27.810
That’s the clever thing to do.

35:27.810 --> 35:32.600
Otherwise, just by shouting if somebody may
say, “Yes, all right, I’ll do it,” by

35:32.600 --> 35:36.850
the time you are gone they’ll say, “Yah,
I’ll do it.”

35:36.850 --> 35:39.300
That means something else.

35:39.300 --> 35:45.340
So you see, he might say, “yes” and “yah”
anytime.

35:45.340 --> 35:51.450
So to have a complete rapport with another
person is to play with that person.

35:51.450 --> 35:54.310
That’s what I did also in Russia.

35:54.310 --> 35:58.430
I went round and round and round and round
and brought him to the point that we have

35:58.430 --> 36:02.240
to be very independent thing, and I managed
it.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.830
That is Shri Krishna’s style.

36:03.830 --> 36:05.670
You see, because to face it.

36:05.670 --> 36:12.410
Supposing somebody says, “Oh this is my
idea; I’ve decided to do this and that and

36:12.410 --> 36:17.690
everything,” then you should say slowly,
“All right, now I would say what you are

36:17.690 --> 36:19.900
saying is correct, absolutely correct.

36:19.900 --> 36:25.070
I agree with you and what do you think about
the other thing?”

36:25.070 --> 36:26.350
something like that.

36:26.350 --> 36:30.420
And then you should say, “Now, I can suggest.

36:30.420 --> 36:35.940
But I would like to suggest,” like this,
“if you can agree to it.”

36:35.940 --> 36:41.300
You see, gradually if you go and talk like
this things can work out and people can feel

36:41.300 --> 36:50.910
really that you have taken time and you have
spent that much time and have accepted their

36:50.910 --> 36:52.710
proposal and things.

36:52.710 --> 36:56.420
And they don’t feel bad.

36:56.420 --> 37:06.050
So one has to know that what is the essence
of all this diplomacy.

37:06.050 --> 37:14.720
Can you tell me?

37:14.720 --> 37:25.420
What is the essence of this diplomacy?

37:25.420 --> 37:28.230
Is benevolence.

37:28.230 --> 37:34.420
You have to achieve the benevolence of the
whole humanity.

37:34.420 --> 37:35.960
This is the essence of it.

37:35.960 --> 37:39.220
If you are doing it, you are not doing for
yourself, for your gain.

37:39.220 --> 37:42.300
You are not doing for the gain of any particular
person.

37:42.300 --> 37:48.640
But you are doing it for the benevolence of
the whole humanity.

37:48.640 --> 37:53.310
So once, you know this is the essence, so
what is the need to shout?

37:53.310 --> 37:56.720
By shouting you are not going to achieve anything.

37:56.720 --> 38:01.030
So to play around with it and bring it to
that point which is benevolence.

38:01.030 --> 38:08.180
Like Krishna was asked that “You said that
you have to tell the truth and it has to be

38:08.180 --> 38:09.390
also very pleasing.

38:09.390 --> 38:11.000
Satyam vadet, priyam vadet.”

38:11.000 --> 38:15.880
He said, “how can it be?

38:15.880 --> 38:18.150
These two things cannot be.

38:18.150 --> 38:22.260
Supposing you tell the truth people may not
like it, may not please that person.

38:22.260 --> 38:23.430
So He said, “No.

38:23.430 --> 38:28.690
It should be ‘Satyam vadet, hitam vadet,
priyam vadet.'”

38:28.690 --> 38:37.410
That “Tell the truth, tell for the benevolence
and tell the pleasing thing.”

38:37.410 --> 38:42.540
Supposing you tell somebody the truth, he
may not like that at that time.

38:42.540 --> 38:45.500
Supposing you tell that person, “Now don’t
go today by plane.”

38:45.500 --> 38:48.480
He will not like it, “What do you mean?

38:48.480 --> 38:49.710
I’m going to go.”

38:49.710 --> 38:51.130
“No please don’t go.

38:51.130 --> 38:52.349
I request you.”

38:52.349 --> 38:57.770
Then he finds out that day the plane went
and had a crash.

38:57.770 --> 39:01.710
So he thinks, “This was good because for
my benevolence this has worked out.

39:01.710 --> 39:03.960
So this is something so good.”

39:03.960 --> 39:08.610
So immediately, he feels obliged to you and
he feels that you have told him the truth

39:08.610 --> 39:12.730
by which it was his benevolence and that’s
why he’s pleased.

39:12.730 --> 39:18.740
So in the long run if you talk something for
the benevolence of a person, for the benevolence

39:18.740 --> 39:26.800
of the spirit, then such a person immediately
thinks that we have really done such a great

39:26.800 --> 39:36.120
obligation on him, that you have saved him.

39:36.120 --> 39:43.900
If even you have to tell some lies for the
benevolence, it does not matter.

39:43.900 --> 39:48.230
It will not have any effect because Shri Krishna,
which is the deity, knows it.

39:48.230 --> 39:53.410
For example, a man is coming to kill somebody
and you know where that man is hiding.

39:53.410 --> 39:56.000
He comes and asks you “Where is that man?”

39:56.000 --> 40:00.230
Are you supposed to tell him the truth “All
right, he’s there.

40:00.230 --> 40:01.330
Go and kill him”?

40:01.330 --> 40:02.330
No.

40:02.330 --> 40:03.330
So what do you have to tell?

40:03.330 --> 40:05.560
You have to tell him that “See.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.700
I’m not going to tell you.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.190
I don’t know.

40:09.190 --> 40:10.190
Doesn’t matter.”

40:10.190 --> 40:15.830
Because what he is asking is unauthorized
is anadhikar.

40:15.830 --> 40:20.420
He had no business, he has no authority to
ask such a question.

40:20.420 --> 40:24.930
And he had no authority to extract the answer
from you.

40:24.930 --> 40:28.380
Whether you give him the answer or not answer
is your right.

40:28.380 --> 40:34.020
If you understand that, it is not for the
benevolence for the man who wants to kill,

40:34.020 --> 40:39.890
because tomorrow he will be hanged, and not
also for the benevolence of the person whom

40:39.890 --> 40:41.760
he is seeking out.

40:41.760 --> 40:45.720
So if you do like that then there is no problem.

40:45.720 --> 40:52.720
You’ll find most of the people will just
like you because they will know that you are

40:52.720 --> 40:55.620
sincere, very honest, that you want to be
benevolent.

40:55.620 --> 41:03.680
Now as you know I have told all of you everything,
whatever I felt like about you, most of the

41:03.680 --> 41:09.070
time I should say, not all of the time, but
of course most of the time.

41:09.070 --> 41:12.460
I have to also tell lies little bit.

41:12.460 --> 41:18.630
But whatever I do you will find out is for
your benevolence, is for your good.

41:18.630 --> 41:20.330
I have to tell you.

41:20.330 --> 41:22.550
I cannot run away from that.

41:22.550 --> 41:24.670
I have to face it.

41:24.670 --> 41:29.220
So you cannot run away from telling people
what you think is right for them.

41:29.220 --> 41:33.590
Specially those about whom you are in charge.

41:33.590 --> 41:38.340
Like you have children, you’ve got a family,
you’ve got other relations, of whom you

41:38.340 --> 41:45.210
are in charge then best thing is that you
have to tell them frankly what you think and

41:45.210 --> 41:46.530
what is right.

41:46.530 --> 41:48.580
It’s your duty.

41:48.580 --> 41:50.190
Then people escape it also.

41:50.190 --> 41:54.390
Many people who don’t want to face their
children, I have seen, they’ll give them

41:54.390 --> 41:55.980
toys, toys after toys.

41:55.980 --> 41:58.761
They will not like to face their children,
tell them, “No, I don’t like it.

41:58.761 --> 41:59.761
This is not good.

41:59.761 --> 42:02.480
I would like you to do like this and this.”

42:02.480 --> 42:09.670
So discipline doesn’t mean, discipline doesn’t
mean something very dominating of one person

42:09.670 --> 42:15.740
or two persons, but discipline means that
whatever we do has to be for the benevolence

42:15.740 --> 42:20.160
of your spirit and the spirit of others.

42:20.160 --> 42:28.040
That is what is the Sahaj discipline where
you do everything for the benevolence of others

42:28.040 --> 42:32.090
and for the benevolence of your own ascent.

42:32.090 --> 42:37.970
Once you have established this idea of hita,
of this benevolence, you have known the life

42:37.970 --> 42:44.500
of Christ, life of Mohammed, life of all these
great people.

42:44.500 --> 42:49.740
Because what They have done is for the benevolence
of the people.

42:49.740 --> 42:54.840
So I would say now we have the left Vishuddhi
and you know very well that left Vishuddhi

42:54.840 --> 42:58.180
is the lightning, in the lightning.

42:58.180 --> 43:00.420
Now what is lightning?

43:00.420 --> 43:05.920
He just shouts and roars.

43:05.920 --> 43:13.860
So a person who has got left Vishuddhi should
actually become a person who can shout and

43:13.860 --> 43:22.770
who can scream and who can, I should say,
expose others as She did.

43:22.770 --> 43:25.240
In the same way, you have to do it.

43:25.240 --> 43:29.380
In that you should not be afraid, you should
not worry, and you should not think “How

43:29.380 --> 43:31.090
can I do it after all?”

43:31.090 --> 43:38.670
But mostly the people who feel guilty is a
type which has lost his confidence and the

43:38.670 --> 43:44.490
ego has entered into the left side – it’s
a very complicated situation.

43:44.490 --> 43:48.790
So we have to be on the lookout that we are
not guilty, it’s very important.

43:48.790 --> 43:52.010
Guilty for this, guilty for that, it’s just
a myth.

43:52.010 --> 43:56.800
We want to escape reality that’s why we
say we are guilty.

43:56.800 --> 44:01.420
So you have to face, face it, your reality.

44:01.420 --> 44:05.830
Try to find out what’s wrong with you and
what’s wrong with another person and face

44:05.830 --> 44:06.830
it.

44:06.830 --> 44:13.980
That is much better than to just say, “Oh
I feel very guilty,” and sitting down, because

44:13.980 --> 44:26.370
Vishnumaya is nothing but like an electricity
and electricity exposes people, she screams

44:26.370 --> 44:33.430
at people, shouts at people, she roars at
people.

44:33.430 --> 44:37.360
So if you have a left Vishuddhi then you have
to use these methods.

44:37.360 --> 44:44.200
I would say a person who has an inferiority
complex should go to the sea and address the

44:44.200 --> 44:50.170
sea and tell, “I am the lord of the sea,
I am this, I am that!” loudly.

44:50.170 --> 44:55.020
Those people who cannot speak on the stage,
cannot come on the stage, they should go – also

44:55.020 --> 44:57.830
same way – when they try they’ll become
great speakers.

44:57.830 --> 45:04.370
It will be a very good idea for you to go
and just to give a big lecture and with that

45:04.370 --> 45:15.820
big lecture you can always show that you are
not suffering from any inferiority complex

45:15.820 --> 45:20.310
but you are expressing yourself in a clear-cut
way.

45:20.310 --> 45:29.340
So now you will see the power of Shri Krishna
is of the throat, of the right side, where

45:29.340 --> 45:31.380
what is the power He has got?

45:31.380 --> 45:37.070
The power is that He is sweetness.

45:37.070 --> 45:41.750
He has the power of the shouting – or you
can say with which, the vocal chord as you

45:41.750 --> 45:44.060
call it.

45:44.060 --> 45:51.150
He is the power of the vocal chord but how
does He use His power is for sweetness is

45:51.150 --> 45:52.810
a contrast.

45:52.810 --> 45:57.550
And the same thing happens with Vishnumaya
too.

45:57.550 --> 46:03.720
Now Vishnumaya is the potential power in the,
say, in the clouds, is a potential one.

46:03.720 --> 46:11.600
But what She does is to scream, shout and
show Her existence, that She exists.

46:11.600 --> 46:16.460
Now all these photographs that you get and
all these miraculous photographs you have

46:16.460 --> 46:20.090
been showing me are because of Vishnumaya.

46:20.090 --> 46:23.480
She is the one, as electricity, She acts.

46:23.480 --> 46:27.540
And She is the one who manages all these things
very well.

46:27.540 --> 46:34.850
So though She is the sister of Shri Krishna
She is in a way very much subtler because

46:34.850 --> 46:37.580
She helps you in such a subtle manner.

46:37.580 --> 46:43.220
Now this mic [microphone] it has electricity
in it – you’ll be surprised My vibrations

46:43.220 --> 46:45.430
are passing through this.

46:45.430 --> 46:52.600
It is bombarding this and from here, they
are going anywhere you want them to go.

46:52.600 --> 46:57.280
You can put a computer on the other side and
you can computerize Me.

46:57.280 --> 47:06.560
It is such a remarkable thing that the one
which is supposed to shout, scream and roar

47:06.560 --> 47:15.040
is the one which is on the left hand side
so that it exists in the people in a potential

47:15.040 --> 47:16.040
way.

47:16.040 --> 47:26.901
In the people who are feeling guilty, who
are suffering from inferiority complex, who

47:26.901 --> 47:30.340
are sly, who feel they are good for nothing.

47:30.340 --> 47:32.050
She exists in them.

47:32.050 --> 47:33.530
See the contrast again.

47:33.530 --> 47:44.040
She exists in them that Her power, She exists
in a person, or expresses in a person who

47:44.040 --> 47:49.690
is not self confident.

47:49.690 --> 47:55.000
And then She asserts Her power by which persons
become self confident.

47:55.000 --> 48:01.080
This is how Her working comes in and that
is potentially within us also.

48:01.080 --> 48:07.540
So when we talk of Vishnumaya we have to know
that She is sitting down there.

48:07.540 --> 48:13.670
Any moment we decide, we can become great
speakers, we can expose people.

48:13.670 --> 48:17.410
We’ll be like lightning, we can roar.

48:17.410 --> 48:19.940
But normally we are not.

48:19.940 --> 48:25.840
So it gives balance to both sides of people.

48:25.840 --> 48:33.260
But in the center when you rise – the kundalini
rises – most of the people have their Vishuddhi

48:33.260 --> 48:36.070
caught up, most of the people.

48:36.070 --> 48:40.500
So they have to either see that they are not
guilty or they have to see that there is no

48:40.500 --> 48:44.940
shouting – nothing – they are not aggressive
in their shouts.

48:44.940 --> 48:52.200
And, plus, they have to see that they are
completely in balance with themselves.

48:52.200 --> 48:58.550
So they are in the central path by which they
become sweet, kind and nice.

48:58.550 --> 49:01.830
Now there are many people who artificially
become sweet.

49:01.830 --> 49:02.970
Artificially.

49:02.970 --> 49:08.720
They have to take out some money so they’ll
be extremely sweet and nice.

49:08.720 --> 49:15.720
Such people are really going to go to hell
because they are using the power of Shri Krishna

49:15.720 --> 49:20.560
in a very absurd manner and for that, they
cannot be spared.

49:20.560 --> 49:23.850
So those who are artificially sweet are good
for nothing.

49:23.850 --> 49:32.230
You have to be really sweet and kind if you
think of Him as the One who is Narayana, who

49:32.230 --> 49:44.850
is Shri Rama, who is Shri Krishna and who
is the Lord of your Vishuddhi.

49:44.850 --> 49:49.760
So we have to control, not to feel guilty
again, because there might be some people

49:49.760 --> 49:52.880
who might be feeling that “Mother is saying
to me.”

49:52.880 --> 49:57.220
I’m not saying to anyone as such, it’s
a general talk.

49:57.220 --> 50:02.020
So what I’m saying is that if you are a
person who is a shouting type, please bring

50:02.020 --> 50:09.020
it round and keep it in check and take rest,
give rest to your throat.

50:09.020 --> 50:13.950
Some people are very happy if they are told
that “Today collector sahib is in rest.”

50:13.950 --> 50:18.370
They said, “Permanently or for a short time?”

50:18.370 --> 50:22.720
Because he’s the one, if he’s a shouting
fellow, nobody wants to see him.

50:22.720 --> 50:27.690
No one likes any person who shouts, no one
likes.

50:27.690 --> 50:30.330
Even the nearest and dearest don’t like
it.

50:30.330 --> 50:36.780
Of course they tolerate, is different, but
they don’t like it they don’t want it.

50:36.780 --> 50:42.510
So for us it is important to understand that
our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear first of

50:42.510 --> 50:50.070
all we must have a beautiful heart, a very
clean heart, where there is a fragrance of

50:50.070 --> 50:55.150
Shri Krishna’s melodious music.

50:55.150 --> 51:00.672
Unless and until we have a beautiful, sweet
music in our heart we can never be, never

51:00.672 --> 51:03.090
be good Sahaj Yogis.

51:03.090 --> 51:13.450
I hope today’s evening puja, though has
been rather late, doesn’t matter, will help

51:13.450 --> 51:17.940
you to think about it, improving your Vishuddhi,
working it out.

51:17.940 --> 51:26.260
And then to look at the Viraat and find out
what’s wrong with you, get it corrected

51:26.260 --> 51:37.270
– which can be done by anyone – and see
that you just have a full idea about yourself,

51:37.270 --> 51:38.270
about your Vishuddhi.

51:38.270 --> 51:43.520
And that’s only possible, only again it’s
a vicious circle, if you have a good Vishuddhi.

51:43.520 --> 51:48.950
If you don’t have a good Vishuddhi you can
never see yourself because at the Vishuddhi

51:48.950 --> 51:52.260
point only, you become the witness.

51:52.260 --> 51:55.400
You are just a witness when you are at a Vishuddhi
point.

51:55.400 --> 51:59.050
So you have to be at the Vishuddhi a witness.

51:59.050 --> 52:05.720
If you have achieved the witness nature then
you can see in your Vishuddhi what’s wrong

52:05.720 --> 52:11.420
with you, what’s wrong with your problems,
with your atmosphere, everything, and you

52:11.420 --> 52:15.730
will end up here only thinking, “Oh, this
is the one that is wrong.”

52:15.730 --> 52:23.230
So today, when we are worshipping Shri Krishna,
we should know that our Vishuddhis and our

52:23.230 --> 52:31.910
brain, because ultimately He becomes the brain,
Shri Krishna becomes the brain.

52:31.910 --> 52:35.750
That’s what I told you that the fat of the
stomach goes in the brain.

52:35.750 --> 52:43.670
So Shri Narayana enters into the brain and
becomes what we call as Viraat, Akhbar.

52:43.670 --> 52:52.990
And when He becomes Akhbar, then He’s the
brain in the big macrocosm.

52:52.990 --> 52:55.490
He’s the brain.

52:55.490 --> 53:03.770
So people who worship Shri Krishna become
brainy people without ego.

53:03.770 --> 53:08.150
Their brain develops and they have no ego
about it.

53:08.150 --> 53:17.230
Egoless intelligence, which I call as the
pure intelligence, starts manifesting.

53:17.230 --> 53:31.850
May God bless you all.

53:31.850 --> 53:47.960
After this puja now you know that I’m going
to Finland and you should see My itinerary.

53:47.960 --> 53:49.080
It’s terrible.

53:49.080 --> 53:56.960
And from Finland to Moscow, Moscow to India,
India to Japan, and Japan to Los Angeles and

53:56.960 --> 53:59.550
Los Angeles to New Zealand, New Zealand to
Australia.

53:59.550 --> 54:03.380
So this will be like this everyday practically,
I think.

54:03.380 --> 54:09.230
But whatever it is I’m going now and now
you have some time.

54:09.230 --> 54:16.660
We have lot of time now in between till I
come in October to trouble you again.

54:16.660 --> 54:23.190
So in this time you all should decide what
you are going to do, how are you going to

54:23.190 --> 54:26.931
help Sahaja Yoga, how you are going to work
it out.

54:26.931 --> 54:34.060
This is very important because I don’t need
any Sahaja Yog, you need it and all the rest

54:34.060 --> 54:35.210
of the world needs it.

54:35.210 --> 54:37.500
But despite that I’m working so hard.

54:37.500 --> 54:40.360
So you have to think that “Mother is now
gone out, doesn’t matter.

54:40.360 --> 54:45.040
We are going to work it out and we are going
to find out what we can do about it.”

54:45.040 --> 54:47.630
So please work out something till I come back.

54:47.630 --> 54:55.410
I’ll be back here again in October, then
we’ll see what we can do and achieve further.

54:55.410 --> 55:01.540
But let’s see what you have achieved and
bring them to some conclusions, bring them

55:01.540 --> 55:02.980
to some fruits.

55:02.980 --> 55:06.110
And that is what I’m expecting.

55:06.110 --> 55:13.990
Now I have to thank all the people who have
done so much for Sahaja Yoga already and all

55:13.990 --> 55:19.380
the centers and all the countries where Sahaja
Yoga started and is growing so much.

55:19.380 --> 55:25.640
I don’t know if you know the names of all
the leaders or not, but it is worth knowing

55:25.640 --> 55:33.740
all the leaders of all the countries and paying
your attention to them and praying that they

55:33.740 --> 55:44.610
should be able to deliver blessings of Sahaja
Yoga to everyone.

55:44.610 --> 55:52.990
Also they should be able to have visions,
to see what they can do and how they can combine

55:52.990 --> 55:57.190
different countries and how they can work
out through their own countries.

55:57.190 --> 56:03.420
So this is what it is and I have to thank
all the leaders of the world and all the people

56:03.420 --> 56:12.010
wherever I have been so far, for the arrangements
and everything they did.

56:12.010 --> 56:15.640
They worked very hard and achieved such a
lot of things.

56:15.640 --> 56:21.060
And I have to thank also the Sahaja Yogis
who are with them, who have helped so much.

56:21.060 --> 56:25.240
Thank you very much, all of you.

56:25.240 --> 56:26.880
All right.

56:26.880 --> 56:35.830
In today’s puja we’ll have first a Shri
Ganesha’s three mantras and then we’ll

56:35.830 --> 56:41.151
have hundred and eight names of Shri Krishna
– if they have.

56:41.151 --> 56:52.920
Have you got hundred and eight names
of Shri Krishna?

56:52.920 --> 56:53.920
Just wash My feet.

56:53.920 --> 56:57.520
Need not call the children now, it’s very
late.
