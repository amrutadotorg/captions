1
00:00:07,513 --> 00:00:21,721
So in such an auspicious day when we
all have come here to do this special puja,

2
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:27,257
and I would say this should be
called as a Mahalakshmi Puja because

3
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:34,227
it’s something to do with the industry
of this country, and of the whole world.

4
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:44,303
Unless and until all those human ventures are connected with God

5
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:49,868
they cannot get their perfect stage and their status.

6
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:55,725
That’s why we have problems now in the West.
Supposed to be very clever people, very smart,

7
00:00:55,805 --> 00:01:01,395
very well equipped, well educated. We are having recessions
and things

8
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:08,888
because they have no balance.
They don’t know that there is God’s power which works everything,

9
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:15,377
and when you neglect that, this is what happens to you.

10
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:25,363
Now for any venture that we do of this kind,

11
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:30,775
first of all we have to use a lot of material from the Mother Earth,

12
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:38,003
but if it is taken for a proper purpose, for constructive things

13
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:43,195
and for helping others, with a balance,

14
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:49,013
then Mother Earth can think, She can produce,

15
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:52,716
more and more,
all this She has produced before.

16
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:58,399
She can produce for people who are sensible,

17
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:06,434
who are in tune with God, not just making money for themselves,

18
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:17,560
or for their own purpose, but are thinking in totality,

19
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,482
thinking as to what we can achieve by doing this.

20
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:29,126
And that is how an industry can grow.

21
00:02:29,206 --> 00:02:32,534
Now we see in Japan so much industry has grown,

22
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:35,202
but no spirituality.

23
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:38,586
They are not at all happy people,

24
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:44,204
their children are suffering, families are suffering.

25
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:53,580
Money cannot get the total well being of a human being.

26
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:57,287
So a balance has to be drawn.

27
00:02:57,368 --> 00:03:03,549
Especially in our country, thank God, we didn’t have
such a fast industrialization,

28
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:09,040
and that’s why we are saved of lots of problems that the Western people are suffering,

29
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:12,164
about which the Indians are not aware.

30
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:19,673
They think you are all living in a very comfortable life there.

31
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:26,247
Industry has to go hand-in-hand with the handicrafts,

32
00:03:26,781 --> 00:03:32,600
and the industrialists have to also look after the artists,

33
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:36,486
because otherwise who will look after them? How will they bring forth

34
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:40,695
the balance between the art and the industry?

35
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:45,915
And art is such a soothing thing for these hard-working people.
They work the whole day,

36
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:54,351
then there is some sort of a music, art, to console them,

37
00:03:54,431 --> 00:04:03,555
to give them peace, to relax them, and a balance.

38
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:11,023
So I would say that all industries
must take to some artistic ventures also,

39
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:13,604
or they should also produce things.

40
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:17,560
After I was telling Rajesh many a times that you should try to produce

41
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,497
something artistic out of the steel scrap that is left over, will be a good idea.

42
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:25,731
They have tried something like that.

43
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:32,351
But industry should not be looked down upon

44
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:34,694
as it is looked down upon in our country.

45
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:40,954
I mean, as if industrialists are the greatest thieves
and all the politicians are saints in this country.

46
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:44,996
It’s the other way around I think.
It should be treated with respect,

47
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:49,402
and should be understood that it’s very important.

48
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:54,086
And the industrialists, if they become also enlightened,

49
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:59,440
they can do a lot, not only to their own country,

50
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,198
but also to the people whom they are looking after.

51
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:06,156
So in the Mahalakshmi principle,

52
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:11,041
Mahalakshmi has various mudras.

53
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:18,170
One of the mudra is that She puts Her right hand like this.

54
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,080
Now this right hand is to give protection to people

55
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:28,130
who are under the protection, or under the service,

56
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:33,069
of some rich man, or the industrialist we can call it.

57
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:38,155
In India if you call somebody a rich man it’s like abusing him. Nobody likes it,

58
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:41,226
because the rich are always shown

59
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,406
to be the worst people, which is not so.

60
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:47,376
In My own experience it’s not so. If there’s a poor man also he could be terrible.

61
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:50,296
We have had very bad experiences now, in Ganapatipule,

62
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:56,902
of very poor people how they behaved
in a very funny manner - supposed to be poor.

63
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:07,000
So it should be a proper balance, it should be brought to a proper balance,

64
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,490
between the understanding of the poor and the rich, and the rich and the poor.

65
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:21,160
After some time you will find that people will not consider poverty

66
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:29,379
or riches as so important, but the richness of the spirit
will become very important.

67
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,451
That is what is going to be the Sahaj nations

68
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:38,353
where the richness of the heart, the spirituality,

69
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:43,854
oneness with the Divine, will become the greatest boon
for everyone.
