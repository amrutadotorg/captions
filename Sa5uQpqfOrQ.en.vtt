00:08.296 --> 00:11.280
Now the interest changes completely,

00:11.280 --> 00:18.352
and you start really helping people and not
feeling that you are helping them, not at all.

00:19.560 --> 00:24.060
But the surrounding portion of that,
which is the void, is the best,

00:24.060 --> 00:29.620
which is affected by your awakening,
that you become the virtue itself.

00:31.620 --> 00:40.245
Nobody has to tell you that you be virtuous, when
you are awakened you become a virtuous personality,

00:41.520 --> 00:51.589
you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy being good,
you enjoy being nice, you really enjoy it.

00:52.200 --> 00:58.832
And that enjoyment comes to you as a blessing
because the virtue itself is so strengthening,

00:59.100 --> 01:07.080
so powerful that anyone who is
harmed or troubled or tortured or

01:08.100 --> 01:16.410
put down, you stand up, you are not afraid of
anyone, you are not afraid of any one of them.

01:16.410 --> 01:24.300
Now about these people who have been troubling
you as fake gurus, I told about them in 1970.

01:24.300 --> 01:29.340
I’m just a lady and single-handed
I told them who these people are,

01:29.340 --> 01:33.060
how they are going to loot you,
and what they are going to do;

01:33.060 --> 01:39.493
but in this country nobody can think of one
genuine person who could be really genuine.

01:39.900 --> 01:46.906
It was the problem that time, but with this
awakening within you of the virtuous nature,

01:47.160 --> 01:49.860
you just know what is virtue
and what is not virtue.

01:49.860 --> 01:54.180
I don’t have to tell you; I don’t
say “don’t do this, don’t do that."

01:54.180 --> 02:01.200
I never say that, it just happens,
because when the virtue starts developing,

02:01.200 --> 02:05.692
the vibrations improve and
you feel extremely joyous.

02:06.420 --> 02:16.440
We have lost our virtues because
there is no joy out of it, no reward.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.139
If somebody is honest, he has to suffer;

02:19.380 --> 02:24.600
if somebody’s good, he has to suffer; is
somebody’s kind, he thinks he has to suffer;

02:24.600 --> 02:28.320
but after getting Realization you
are rewarded for your virtues.

02:28.320 --> 02:32.520
You are amazed how you are paid
for it, it’s so surprising,

02:32.520 --> 02:39.480
like once there was a lady who came to see
Me, she was a refugee, and I had a big house.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.580
So I said, “All right come and stay with Me."

02:41.580 --> 02:44.400
So My husband, My brother they
came, they said, “What’s this?

02:44.400 --> 02:46.320
You don’t know her, who she is, her husband,

02:46.320 --> 02:49.080
whether he is her husband or
not, just given her two rooms.

02:49.080 --> 02:49.740
It’s not good!”

02:49.740 --> 02:51.480
I said, “Let it be, doesn’t matter.

02:51.480 --> 02:54.405
I know for nothing is going
to happen, let her be here."

02:54.540 --> 02:56.580
So they wouldn’t also go against Me.

02:56.580 --> 02:57.840
They said, “All right, if you say so."

02:57.840 --> 03:00.780
This lady stayed for ten days and went away.

03:00.780 --> 03:05.700
Then she become a very well-known actress in
India, I didn’t know she was the same lady,

03:05.700 --> 03:07.560
but somebody told Me that she is the same lady.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.069
I said, “Maybe."

03:09.420 --> 03:13.485
Then one day you see, they wanted
to make a film for our Sahaja Yoga,

03:13.620 --> 03:17.760
so they said, “We can ask this lady to
act, because she is a good actress."

03:17.760 --> 03:22.860
I said, “All right, you can go ask but don’t tell
her I am here, otherwise she will have no choice.

03:22.860 --> 03:24.420
I will not go and see her.

03:24.420 --> 03:25.740
You just ask her."

03:25.740 --> 03:28.860
They went and ask her, they said,
“Will you be actress?” and all that.

03:28.860 --> 03:29.940
She said, “I’ll try."

03:29.940 --> 03:31.140
This, that she was saying.

03:31.140 --> 03:36.060
But on the day on when they were going to open the
film I went there, she saw Me, she was so amazed,

03:36.060 --> 03:40.800
she said, “Oh God, You are the One, You
are the One Who is sponsoring this, Oh,

03:40.800 --> 03:44.460
I’ll give my life for Her!” She just came
forward, she said, “Have anything you like,

03:44.460 --> 03:49.692
I have nothing to say, I am so sorry
that you never told me that She’s there."

03:49.920 --> 03:54.563
Thousand times more she rewarded
a little thing I did for her.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.840
No more cheating, no more troubling,

03:57.840 --> 04:03.480
you become a wonderful person and so many
people become your friends in this world.

04:03.480 --> 04:08.520
Your have to just tell you are coming, there will
hundred people at the airport to receive you.

04:08.520 --> 04:12.480
There will be so many friends all over
the world for you, you will be amazed.

04:12.480 --> 04:17.700
It’s such a tremendous thing happens,
because now you all are awakened in

04:17.700 --> 04:20.760
that Primordial Being and you
have become one with each other.

04:20.760 --> 04:27.960
You can feel it, that oneness, that unison that
we are all not only human beings but we are yogis,

04:27.960 --> 04:31.440
we are super human beings, and we
have to look after the whole world.

04:31.440 --> 04:37.980
That feeling of compassion is
so overwhelming that all little,

04:37.980 --> 04:42.736
little stupid things just fall
off, there’s no place for that.

04:42.840 --> 04:46.020
This actually happens and has happened with many.

04:46.442 --> 04:50.700
Dr. Warren, whom you have seen here, can tell
you as I have told you lots of stories,

04:50.700 --> 04:55.860
but there are many, some of them were so hot
tempered, some of them were so quarrelsome,

04:55.860 --> 04:59.340
some them used to fight so much
in the beginning that I thought,

04:59.340 --> 05:05.700
“How are they going to be all right?” But today I
find them as great friends and very great yogis.

05:05.700 --> 05:10.680
So this is the center where
your religion is awakened.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.000
And what is a religion?

05:12.000 --> 05:18.600
Word comes from “religo,” in Sanskrit it means
dharma, “Dhariyatisa Dharma,” the sustenance,

05:18.600 --> 05:20.700
your sustenance, your valances is your religion.

05:20.700 --> 05:26.580
As every atom, carbon has four valances,
and in the same way you have ten valances,

05:26.580 --> 05:34.301
these are the ten commandments that were told
to you and you become that, you just become.

05:34.500 --> 05:41.132
I don’t have to tell you as commandments but they
become your beautiful ornaments within yourself.

05:41.340 --> 05:46.652
This happens automatically, so
spontaneously you become that.
