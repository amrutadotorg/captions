00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:11.280
Now the interest changes completely,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.352
and you start really helping people and not&nbsp;
feeling that you are helping them, not at all.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.060
But the surrounding portion of that,&nbsp;
which is the void, is the best,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.620
which is affected by your awakening,&nbsp;
that you become the virtue itself.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:40.245
Nobody has to tell you that you be virtuous, when&nbsp;
you are awakened you become a virtuous personality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:51.589
you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy being good,&nbsp;
you enjoy being nice, you really enjoy it.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.832
And that enjoyment comes to you as a blessing&nbsp;
because the virtue itself is so strengthening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.080
so powerful that anyone who is&nbsp;
harmed or troubled or tortured or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.410
put down, you stand up, you are not afraid of&nbsp;
anyone, you are not afraid of any one of them.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:24.300
Now about these people who have been troubling&nbsp;
you as fake gurus, I told about them in 1970.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.340
I’m just a lady and single-handed&nbsp;
I told them who these people are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.060
how they are going to loot you,&nbsp;
and what they are going to do;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.493
but in this country nobody can think of one&nbsp;
genuine person who could be really genuine.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.906
It was the problem that time, but with this&nbsp;
awakening within you of the virtuous nature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.860
you just know what is virtue&nbsp;
and what is not virtue.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.180
I don’t have to tell you; I don’t&nbsp;
say “don’t do this, don’t do that."

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.200
I never say that, it just happens,&nbsp;
because when the virtue starts developing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.692
the vibrations improve and&nbsp;
you feel extremely joyous.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:16.440
We have lost our virtues because&nbsp;
there is no joy out of it, no reward.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.139
If somebody is honest, he has to suffer;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.600
if somebody’s good, he has to suffer; is&nbsp;
somebody’s kind, he thinks he has to suffer;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.320
but after getting Realization you&nbsp;
are rewarded for your virtues.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.520
You are amazed how you are paid&nbsp;
for it, it’s so surprising,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.480
like once there was a lady who came to see&nbsp;
Me, she was a refugee, and I had a big house.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.580
So I said, “All right come and stay with Me."

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.400
So My husband, My brother they&nbsp;
came, they said, “What’s this?

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.320
You don’t know her, who she is, her husband,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.080
whether he is her husband or&nbsp;
not, just given her two rooms.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.740
It’s not good!”

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.480
I said, “Let it be, doesn’t matter.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.405
I know for nothing is going&nbsp;
to happen, let her be here."

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.580
So they wouldn’t also go against Me.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.840
They said, “All right, if you say so."

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.780
This lady stayed for ten days and went away.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.700
Then she become a very well-known actress in&nbsp;
India, I didn’t know she was the same lady,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.560
but somebody told Me that she is the same lady.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.069
I said, “Maybe."

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.485
Then one day you see, they wanted&nbsp;
to make a film for our Sahaja Yoga,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.760
so they said, “We can ask this lady to&nbsp;
act, because she is a good actress."

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.860
I said, “All right, you can go ask but don’t tell&nbsp;
her I am here, otherwise she will have no choice.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.420
I will not go and see her.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.740
You just ask her."

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.860
They went and ask her, they said,&nbsp;
“Will you be actress?” and all that.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.940
She said, “I’ll try."

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.140
This, that she was saying.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.060
But on the day on when they were going to open the&nbsp;
film I went there, she saw Me, she was so amazed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.800
she said, “Oh God, You are the One, You&nbsp;
are the One Who is sponsoring this, Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.460
I’ll give my life for Her!” She just came&nbsp;
forward, she said, “Have anything you like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.692
I have nothing to say, I am so sorry&nbsp;
that you never told me that She’s there."

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.563
Thousand times more she rewarded&nbsp;
a little thing I did for her.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.840
No more cheating, no more troubling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.480
you become a wonderful person and so many&nbsp;
people become your friends in this world.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.520
Your have to just tell you are coming, there will&nbsp;
hundred people at the airport to receive you.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.480
There will be so many friends all over&nbsp;
the world for you, you will be amazed.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.700
It’s such a tremendous thing happens,&nbsp;
because now you all are awakened in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.760
that Primordial Being and you&nbsp;
have become one with each other.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.960
You can feel it, that oneness, that unison that&nbsp;
we are all not only human beings but we are yogis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.440
we are super human beings, and we&nbsp;
have to look after the whole world.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.980
That feeling of compassion is&nbsp;
so overwhelming that all little,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.736
little stupid things just fall&nbsp;
off, there’s no place for that.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.020
This actually happens and has happened with many.

00:04:46.442 --> 00:04:50.700
Dr. Warren, whom you have seen here, can tell&nbsp;
you as I have told you lots of stories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.860
but there are many, some of them were so hot&nbsp;
tempered, some of them were so quarrelsome,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.340
some them used to fight so much&nbsp;
in the beginning that I thought,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.700
“How are they going to be all right?” But today I&nbsp;
find them as great friends and very great yogis.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.680
So this is the center where&nbsp;
your religion is awakened.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.000
And what is a religion?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.600
Word comes from “religo,” in Sanskrit it means&nbsp;
dharma, “Dhariyatisa Dharma,” the sustenance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.700
your sustenance, your valances is your religion.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.580
As every atom, carbon has four valances,&nbsp;
and in the same way you have ten valances,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:34.301
these are the ten commandments that were told&nbsp;
to you and you become that, you just become.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.132
I don’t have to tell you as commandments but they&nbsp;
become your beautiful ornaments within yourself.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.652
This happens automatically, so&nbsp;
spontaneously you become that.
