1
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:21,593
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

2
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:37,073
to see so many Sahaja yogis

3
00:27:39,113 --> 00:27:47,473
sitting here with such shining faces

4
00:27:47,473 --> 00:27:50,993
from all over the world,

5
00:27:53,433 --> 00:28:00,633
as if My vision has taken its form today.

6
00:28:07,713 --> 00:28:16,353
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

7
00:28:16,353 --> 00:28:20,513
who are going to save this world

8
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:25,753
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

9
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:29,353
that are surrounding us.

10
00:28:30,313 --> 00:28:34,073
Is coming from all sides,

11
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:42,473
while you people have really taken your second birth

12
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:46,953
from this pond of Kali Yuga

13
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:52,633
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

14
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:57,433
hues, fragrance and beauty.

15
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:02,633
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

16
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:07,673
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

17
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,473
As I told you the other day that

18
00:29:15,473 --> 00:29:25,313
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

19
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:28,113
that it could work out,

20
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,753
otherwise it would have been impossible.

21
00:29:33,753 --> 00:29:38,233
To even transform one person is very difficult,

22
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:42,753
but you were so sensitive

23
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:48,113
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

24
00:29:48,113 --> 00:29:53,873
I don't know how it penetrated your being.

25
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,433
It's unbelievable.

26
00:29:56,433 --> 00:30:00,313
I can't believe Myself

27
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:08,353
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

28
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:12,473
No one can believe that there are so many

29
00:30:12,473 --> 00:30:14,993
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

30
00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:18,713
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

31
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:27,313
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

32
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:32,273
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

33
00:30:32,273 --> 00:30:35,593
and devas, not so many.

34
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:39,553
One better than the other

35
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:46,033
such beautiful heart,

36
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:52,033
such brilliant brains

37
00:30:52,353 --> 00:31:04,873
and such active attention, is really

38
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:11,593
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

39
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:16,193
so many people, which I never expected.

40
00:31:16,193 --> 00:31:21,033
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

41
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:25,193
and then those who came also,

42
00:31:25,193 --> 00:31:31,033
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

43
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:35,433
all kinds of people created problems for us.

44
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:38,993
One after another, so many problems came

45
00:31:38,993 --> 00:31:42,313
and also there were many who were

46
00:31:42,313 --> 00:31:46,873
of a very low-level seekers.

47
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:53,233
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

48
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:59,153
I cannot distinguish one from another,

49
00:31:59,153 --> 00:32:01,873
the way it has happened.

50
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:05,353
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

51
00:32:05,353 --> 00:32:11,593
is the greatest blessings for this world.

52
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:17,233
I could not do it alone. You know that.

53
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:22,473
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

54
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,433
You are the channels

55
00:32:25,673 --> 00:32:31,993
and you have to work it out further and further.

56
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:39,433
It is really remarkable the way

57
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:43,753
Delhi people have organized everything.

58
00:32:57,313 --> 00:33:00,393
First of all, everybody was very much

59
00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:03,233
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

60
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:08,553
I don't know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

61
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,913
and then Delhi people said,

62
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:11,913
"This time we are going to celebrate,

63
00:33:11,913 --> 00:33:14,873
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi."

64
00:33:15,153 --> 00:33:19,993
I said, "Everybody's ... on it, so be careful,

65
00:33:19,993 --> 00:33:24,033
it's not going to be easy. It's a big headache.

66
00:33:25,593 --> 00:33:28,353
So many will be coming down."

67
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:31,953
But they didn't expect so much, I'm sure

68
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,153
... people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

69
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:40,353
hundred from there. I said, "Are you worried?"

70
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:43,673
They said, "No we are very happy about it."

71
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:48,193
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

72
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,873
the way they have done it.

73
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:52,793
The best part of it,

74
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:58,153
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

75
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:01,353
have groups and politics and all that,

76
00:34:01,353 --> 00:34:06,633
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

77
00:34:16,913 --> 00:34:19,473
There is no quarrelling.

78
00:34:19,913 --> 00:34:22,393
There is no pulling each other's legs.

79
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,233
Is very remarkable thing

80
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:28,353
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

81
00:34:28,353 --> 00:34:30,473
where every day what you hear

82
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:35,793
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

83
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:39,633
Perhaps, in this hell only,

84
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:43,513
this goodness was to be born and

85
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:46,593
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

86
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:49,313
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

87
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:54,433
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

88
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:59,073
and it's not easy

89
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:06,593
to penetrate into the so-called

90
00:35:06,593 --> 00:35:10,073
people who call themselves intellectuals

91
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:18,193
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

92
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:23,273
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

93
00:35:23,273 --> 00:35:28,073
another side the classes who live in the frame

94
00:35:28,073 --> 00:35:31,713
that they have made out of their brains.

95
00:35:33,593 --> 00:35:37,713
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

96
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:44,113
But the way they have absorbed

97
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:53,313
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

98
00:35:56,153 --> 00:36:00,073
Nobody can comprehend even

99
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:12,713
that there were so many born after My birth,

100
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:16,193
on this Earth,

101
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:21,153
or some maybe before also, very few.

102
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:24,953
Just after My birth they were born here

103
00:36:27,713 --> 00:36:32,313
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

104
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:37,713
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

105
00:36:37,713 --> 00:36:40,273
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

106
00:36:40,273 --> 00:36:45,073
I said, "How will I talk to anyone about it?"

107
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,233
My family members,

108
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:51,713
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

109
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:59,953
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

110
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:07,553
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

111
00:37:08,033 --> 00:37:12,673
there is totality waiting for them?

112
00:37:12,673 --> 00:37:16,793
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

113
00:37:16,793 --> 00:37:20,113
which had no connection with reality.

114
00:37:22,433 --> 00:37:27,033
And it was impossible even to envisage

115
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:31,153
the method by which I could talk to them.

116
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:34,273
I remember the first incident

117
00:37:34,273 --> 00:37:41,673
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

118
00:37:42,313 --> 00:37:47,993
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

119
00:37:48,313 --> 00:37:51,793
Immediately, all the other,

120
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:55,313
there were hardly about thirty-five people

121
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:56,873
they started saying that

122
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:59,673
"Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

123
00:37:59,673 --> 00:38:02,473
so Mother has given him realization."

124
00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:06,513
I think that's the first time and last time I really got angry.

125
00:38:07,073 --> 00:38:10,433
I started shouting at them,

126
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:12,433
"You are good for nothing, useless people,

127
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:15,313
you can never take to Divinity,"

128
00:38:15,313 --> 00:38:18,073
and I had really thought that "Stop it now."

129
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:20,593
One has to take another life,

130
00:38:20,593 --> 00:38:26,313
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:31,353
But after that, suddenly,

132
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:34,633
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

133
00:38:34,633 --> 00:38:39,513
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

134
00:38:39,513 --> 00:38:46,033
And they said, "Mother, You know, it's working.

135
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,913
It's working in us. It's working out of us."

136
00:38:48,913 --> 00:38:53,633
Thus, we got twelve people

137
00:38:53,633 --> 00:39:00,793
and one lady whom I had given before also,

138
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:04,953
she was the fourteenth.

139
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:12,833
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

140
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:19,713
for whom it was something out of the blue.

141
00:39:19,713 --> 00:39:22,313
They were all flabbergasted.

142
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,073
They didn't know what it was.

143
00:39:28,273 --> 00:39:32,513
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

144
00:39:32,513 --> 00:39:41,033
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

145
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:46,753
and started saying, "Jagadamba, Jagadamba."

146
00:39:46,753 --> 00:39:51,193
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

147
00:39:51,193 --> 00:39:53,473
I've never told otherwise also.

148
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:58,793
So then, she recited a poem

149
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:01,673
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

150
00:40:01,673 --> 00:40:04,073
and she was just a maidservant.

151
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:07,313
And in a man's voice.

152
00:40:09,513 --> 00:40:11,313
So everybody was shocked

153
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:15,073
that the bhoots should say all these things.

154
00:40:15,073 --> 00:40:17,633
And then she went away.

155
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:22,913
After that, these people started probing into it.

156
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:28,073
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

157
00:40:28,073 --> 00:40:31,233
in My house itself.

158
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:39,753
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

159
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:41,633
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

160
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:44,993
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

161
00:40:44,993 --> 00:40:48,633
and something will happen to us."

162
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:50,233
But after the Puja they said,

163
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:54,313
"Nothing happened, we are so much better."

164
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:58,793
They all felt the cool breeze

165
00:40:58,793 --> 00:41:02,593
and the entire atmosphere changed.

166
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,793
They started understanding that

167
00:41:05,793 --> 00:41:11,473
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

168
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:19,673
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

169
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:27,553
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

170
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:33,633
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

171
00:41:34,353 --> 00:41:40,873
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

172
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:46,793
and that's what happened with all of you,

173
00:41:46,793 --> 00:41:53,633
that you found out that everywhere

174
00:41:53,633 --> 00:41:56,913
people were following whatever they're following,

175
00:41:56,913 --> 00:42:00,753
they were not reaching any point.

176
00:42:00,753 --> 00:42:03,633
Like a cocoon,

177
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:07,473
they're hitting their head here and there.

178
00:42:07,473 --> 00:42:10,753
They got their realizations

179
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:15,033
so quickly and when they told Me

180
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:20,353
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

181
00:42:20,353 --> 00:42:24,433
I was amazed.

182
00:42:26,673 --> 00:42:29,793
How this seeking was working within them

183
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:32,753
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

184
00:42:32,753 --> 00:42:34,953
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

185
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:43,593
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

186
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:49,793
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

187
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:52,593
You are just representing your country,

188
00:42:52,593 --> 00:42:56,513
but there are many more in your countries.

189
00:42:56,513 --> 00:42:59,233
Even in India we have many more.

190
00:42:59,233 --> 00:43:03,913
You are just here, come to represent them.

191
00:43:03,913 --> 00:43:06,993
So, multiple of this number,

192
00:43:06,993 --> 00:43:09,473
I do not know how many would be there.

193
00:43:09,473 --> 00:43:11,993
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

194
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:13,873
"I don't know."

195
00:43:13,873 --> 00:43:14,993
Say, "You don't know?"

196
00:43:15,353 --> 00:43:19,753
I said, "No. We have never kept any record."

197
00:43:19,753 --> 00:43:22,233
So they can't understand. I said,

198
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:29,393
"We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

199
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:32,393
I don't know how to type.

200
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:36,113
I don't know how to write even My check."

201
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:39,073
They can't understand

202
00:43:38,953 --> 00:43:43,193
person like Me existing in these modern times.

203
00:43:44,593 --> 00:43:48,313
But everything gets done, somehow.

204
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:53,273
Despite all My modern ignorance,

205
00:43:53,273 --> 00:43:57,753
everything gets absolutely

206
00:43:57,753 --> 00:44:00,473
done in the most perfect manner

207
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:04,593
like a remote control.

208
00:44:04,593 --> 00:44:07,673
Now this whole thing,

209
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:14,313
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

210
00:44:14,313 --> 00:44:20,113
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

211
00:44:20,113 --> 00:44:24,793
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

212
00:44:25,873 --> 00:44:30,953
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

213
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:34,873
because you all have commitment

214
00:44:35,193 --> 00:44:38,513
and that commitment gives you

215
00:44:38,513 --> 00:44:42,913
all these organizing capacities.

216
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:51,993
So many things you have seen get organized

217
00:44:51,993 --> 00:44:55,873
because also this Paramchaitanya

218
00:44:55,873 --> 00:45:00,193
has come into Krita Yuga

219
00:45:00,193 --> 00:45:04,433
where it is working it out. It's acting.

220
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:10,073
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

221
00:45:11,673 --> 00:45:14,953
For example, the police people told us

222
00:45:14,953 --> 00:45:17,233
that there are Muslims living here

223
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:19,913
and you might have some danger from them.

224
00:45:19,913 --> 00:45:22,393
They might do some harm to you.

225
00:45:22,393 --> 00:45:24,553
I said, "Which Muslims are they?"

226
00:45:24,553 --> 00:45:29,193
So they said, "Nizamuddin Aulia's people are here."

227
00:45:30,473 --> 00:45:33,073
I said, "They'll never harm us."

228
00:45:33,073 --> 00:45:37,193
I said, "Why? Because he was a Sufi

229
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:40,953
and he was a great realized soul

230
00:45:40,953 --> 00:45:46,233
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

231
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:50,633
at least, believers of Sufism.

232
00:45:50,633 --> 00:45:53,793
How can they harm us?"

233
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,953
So I said, "Tomorrow, early in the morning,

234
00:45:55,953 --> 00:46:02,353
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,"

235
00:46:02,353 --> 00:46:03,753
and they were so impressed

236
00:46:03,753 --> 00:46:08,873
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

237
00:46:08,873 --> 00:46:12,553
morning time, and they were so respectful.

238
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:14,713
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

239
00:46:14,713 --> 00:46:19,153
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

240
00:46:19,153 --> 00:46:20,953
all kinds of things.

241
00:46:20,953 --> 00:46:22,993
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

242
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:26,553
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

243
00:46:26,553 --> 00:46:30,273
and I always have admired his poetry

244
00:46:30,273 --> 00:46:36,713
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

245
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:40,913
and divinity.

246
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:43,633
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

247
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:46,713
and they said, "We are feeling the cool breeze,"

248
00:46:46,713 --> 00:46:48,953
I said, "This is Ruh."

249
00:46:48,953 --> 00:46:51,713
"Ah, this is Ruh."

250
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:55,713
Once these people start getting Ruh,

251
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:58,233
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

252
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:01,713
and you may have to have ...

253
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:16,873
There are so many Sufis all over the world

254
00:47:16,873 --> 00:47:18,953
and we are going to take their addresses

255
00:47:18,953 --> 00:47:20,393
and we are going to meet them;

256
00:47:20,393 --> 00:47:23,113
then you might have to have another big pendal,

257
00:47:23,113 --> 00:47:26,913
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

258
00:47:33,193 --> 00:47:41,073
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

259
00:47:41,073 --> 00:47:45,513
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

260
00:48:01,593 --> 00:48:04,673
Also contemporarily,

261
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:08,953
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

262
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:13,753
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

263
00:48:13,753 --> 00:48:17,073
to give wisdom to those people

264
00:48:17,073 --> 00:48:20,873
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

265
00:48:21,313 --> 00:48:25,353
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

266
00:48:25,353 --> 00:48:27,753
With all these Sahaja yogis

267
00:48:27,753 --> 00:48:30,113
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

268
00:48:30,113 --> 00:48:31,593
See, on top of your head

269
00:48:31,593 --> 00:48:35,233
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

270
00:48:35,473 --> 00:48:38,193
though there is no breeze outside,

271
00:48:38,193 --> 00:48:40,353
the leaves are just steady,

272
00:48:40,353 --> 00:48:44,833
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

273
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:50,793
So I'm sure these vibrations

274
00:48:50,793 --> 00:48:55,553
will cool down and will bring peace

275
00:48:55,553 --> 00:49:00,313
to our politicians and to the people

276
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:04,713
who are at the helm of affairs.

277
00:49:04,713 --> 00:49:08,993
At this juncture, when in the whole world

278
00:49:08,993 --> 00:49:13,473
there are so many things going on

279
00:49:13,473 --> 00:49:16,433
of uncertainties,

280
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:19,913
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

281
00:49:19,913 --> 00:49:23,073
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

282
00:49:23,073 --> 00:49:26,073
in England there's recession,

283
00:49:26,073 --> 00:49:28,233
America there is recession,

284
00:49:28,513 --> 00:49:30,313
Spain there is recession,

285
00:49:30,313 --> 00:49:33,113
everybody is suffering from the pangs

286
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:39,153
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

287
00:49:39,673 --> 00:49:42,233
So, I'm sure this polarity

288
00:49:42,233 --> 00:49:45,433
that they see now will correct

289
00:49:45,793 --> 00:49:49,633
their behavior towards materialism

290
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:55,313
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

291
00:49:55,553 --> 00:49:59,233
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

292
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:06,313
this world will be so beautiful,

293
00:50:06,313 --> 00:50:15,273
so enchanting that in the history,

294
00:50:15,273 --> 00:50:17,593
people will describe

295
00:50:17,593 --> 00:50:21,233
that the world itself became a lotus

296
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:26,593
full of fragrance of Divinity.

297
00:50:34,873 --> 00:50:37,353
You are the petals,

298
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:41,073
you are the corona,

299
00:50:43,593 --> 00:50:46,073
you are the color,

300
00:50:47,153 --> 00:50:49,633
you are the beauty,

301
00:50:51,193 --> 00:50:53,113
you are the pollen

302
00:50:53,873 --> 00:50:57,793
of that beautiful lotus

303
00:51:00,953 --> 00:51:04,513
which is My vision of this world.

304
00:51:04,513 --> 00:51:07,353
I hope today

305
00:51:07,353 --> 00:51:13,873
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

306
00:51:13,873 --> 00:51:15,313
to spread Sahaja Yoga

307
00:51:15,313 --> 00:51:19,113
and work for yourself also.

308
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:21,273
The only danger is

309
00:51:21,273 --> 00:51:26,313
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

310
00:51:26,553 --> 00:51:31,353
That's the only horse.

311
00:51:31,353 --> 00:51:36,153
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

312
00:51:36,153 --> 00:51:38,433
you'll progress very fast,

313
00:51:38,433 --> 00:51:41,633
beautifully.

314
00:51:44,713 --> 00:51:52,673
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

315
00:51:52,673 --> 00:52:01,233
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

316
00:52:01,513 --> 00:52:06,673
I don't know what vow I should take.

317
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,473
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

318
00:52:12,473 --> 00:52:14,353
I'm working very hard,

319
00:52:14,353 --> 00:52:18,713
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

320
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:28,713
In the same way, you also,

321
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:31,593
all of you, have to take a vow today

322
00:52:31,593 --> 00:52:36,433
that we'll go all out in the commitment

323
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:39,673
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

324
00:52:39,673 --> 00:52:42,553
We'll think about it.

325
00:52:42,553 --> 00:52:45,393
There are scientists who should produce books,

326
00:52:45,393 --> 00:52:48,073
there are doctors who should produce books,

327
00:52:48,073 --> 00:52:49,553
writings,

328
00:52:49,553 --> 00:52:50,873
go round,

329
00:52:50,873 --> 00:52:52,793
talk to their colleagues,

330
00:52:52,793 --> 00:52:56,753
organize meetings,

331
00:52:56,753 --> 00:53:00,273
seminars with your colleagues.

332
00:53:02,673 --> 00:53:05,553
There are architects

333
00:53:06,513 --> 00:53:11,073
and other professionals

334
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:16,993
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

335
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,713
Even the people who are dealing with finances

336
00:53:19,713 --> 00:53:22,233
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

337
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:25,833
Is very important because

338
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:30,073
financial problems can only be

339
00:53:30,233 --> 00:53:32,953
solved by the Divine Power.

340
00:53:32,953 --> 00:53:36,513
Nobody else can solve it.

341
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:40,673
So everyone in this world,

342
00:53:40,673 --> 00:53:46,113
whether it is law or any other field,

343
00:53:46,113 --> 00:53:51,353
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

344
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:56,873
and also to creative work.

345
00:53:57,793 --> 00:54:02,193
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

346
00:54:02,193 --> 00:54:04,673
to your surroundings,

347
00:54:04,673 --> 00:54:11,193
to villages, to cities,

348
00:54:11,193 --> 00:54:14,233
wherever it is possible,

349
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:16,633
wherever you can organize,

350
00:54:16,633 --> 00:54:20,513
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

351
00:54:20,513 --> 00:54:23,233
As far as curing is concerned,

352
00:54:23,233 --> 00:54:26,593
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

353
00:54:26,593 --> 00:54:29,393
Please use only My photograph.

354
00:54:29,393 --> 00:54:32,233
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

355
00:54:32,233 --> 00:54:36,673
and less sick people.

356
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:39,193
Also, people will be cured

357
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,953
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

358
00:54:43,233 --> 00:54:46,553
We have also agricultural field

359
00:54:46,553 --> 00:54:48,993
on which we have done something,

360
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:54,393
but much can be done about agriculture.

361
00:54:54,393 --> 00:54:57,073
One should see the government and tell them

362
00:54:57,073 --> 00:54:59,473
what agriculture can do.

363
00:54:59,473 --> 00:55:02,553
You can form a committee and go and see them

364
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:06,673
and talk to them that

365
00:55:06,673 --> 00:55:12,593
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

366
00:55:12,593 --> 00:55:15,233
We have to help our children.

367
00:55:15,233 --> 00:55:17,593
We have to look after them

368
00:55:17,593 --> 00:55:26,793
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

369
00:55:26,793 --> 00:55:29,993
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

370
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,433
even in India.

371
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:37,233
So we have to see that our children

372
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:40,473
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

373
00:55:41,753 --> 00:55:43,753
Is very important

374
00:55:43,753 --> 00:55:47,593
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

375
00:55:47,593 --> 00:55:50,433
So many of them are born realized,

376
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:53,113
so we have to discipline them properly

377
00:55:53,113 --> 00:55:58,753
and we have to make them aala, "aala darza"

378
00:55:58,753 --> 00:56:03,313
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

379
00:56:07,793 --> 00:56:14,753
It is also our family life which is very important.

380
00:56:14,993 --> 00:56:16,793
Is shocking that

381
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:20,353
family life is nowadays becoming

382
00:56:20,353 --> 00:56:24,273
a kind of a stupid thing.

383
00:56:24,273 --> 00:56:27,473
No one understands the importance of it.

384
00:56:27,473 --> 00:56:31,033
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

385
00:56:31,033 --> 00:56:35,753
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

386
00:56:35,753 --> 00:56:41,113
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

387
00:56:41,073 --> 00:56:46,993
and there should be a proper rapport

388
00:56:46,993 --> 00:56:54,553
between husband and wife to begin with,

389
00:56:54,553 --> 00:56:58,193
so that there is a companionship

390
00:56:58,193 --> 00:57:01,513
and the children also see that companionship

391
00:57:01,513 --> 00:57:05,433
and enjoy it.

392
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:10,033
In our dress, in our life,

393
00:57:10,033 --> 00:57:14,913
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

394
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:17,393
Is very important.

395
00:57:17,593 --> 00:57:19,873
We should wear whatever suits us

396
00:57:19,873 --> 00:57:22,633
in whatever country we are.

397
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:25,673
I mean, imagine in summer climate

398
00:57:25,673 --> 00:57:28,433
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

399
00:57:28,673 --> 00:57:30,873
what will happen to him?

400
00:57:31,553 --> 00:57:33,153
Whatever suits us,

401
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:37,473
whatever fits our culture,

402
00:57:37,473 --> 00:57:42,033
one should try to wear decent dresses,

403
00:57:42,033 --> 00:57:44,753
traditional dresses.

404
00:57:44,993 --> 00:57:47,553
Specially for women, it is very important

405
00:57:47,553 --> 00:57:52,393
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

406
00:57:59,473 --> 00:58:02,673
Also, another point I would like to say,

407
00:58:02,673 --> 00:58:07,553
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

408
00:58:08,233 --> 00:58:11,073
at least newspapers.

409
00:58:11,393 --> 00:58:15,233
If your attention is on the problems

410
00:58:15,233 --> 00:58:18,833
that are in this world, it's very effective

411
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:23,673
because you know your attention is active, it works.

412
00:58:25,473 --> 00:58:27,993
So use your attention.

413
00:58:27,993 --> 00:58:29,473
You see the newspapers,

414
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:32,113
you watch -- I know it's horrifying sometimes

415
00:58:32,113 --> 00:58:33,913
you can give a bandhan,

416
00:58:33,913 --> 00:58:37,273
but you must see what's happening where,

417
00:58:37,273 --> 00:58:40,073
is very important.

418
00:58:40,073 --> 00:58:44,993
Also men should not just read something sensational,

419
00:58:44,993 --> 00:58:48,153
but read something that's happening

420
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:51,553
and also think, what are the solutions.

421
00:58:51,553 --> 00:58:54,953
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

422
00:58:54,953 --> 00:58:58,233
in a collective way or in an individual way.

423
00:58:58,233 --> 00:59:06,033
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

424
00:59:06,033 --> 00:59:09,113
Also one has to read good books,

425
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:12,153
good films one has to see,

426
00:59:12,153 --> 00:59:14,873
and have your reflection on them.

427
00:59:14,873 --> 00:59:16,833
Keep your mind alert.

428
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:21,073
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

429
00:59:21,073 --> 00:59:22,553
coming out of

430
00:59:22,553 --> 00:59:25,473
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

431
00:59:25,473 --> 00:59:28,033
beautiful, very high class.

432
00:59:28,233 --> 00:59:31,513
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

433
00:59:31,513 --> 00:59:34,633
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

434
00:59:34,633 --> 00:59:36,153
from everywhere.

435
00:59:36,153 --> 00:59:39,553
They are trying to systematize now.

436
00:59:39,553 --> 00:59:41,513
And now, in this system,

437
00:59:41,513 --> 00:59:44,153
if you can all help spontaneously,

438
00:59:44,153 --> 00:59:48,593
it will be a great achievement

439
00:59:48,593 --> 00:59:52,113
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

440
00:59:52,113 --> 00:59:56,313
all these datas and keep them with us.

441
00:59:58,233 --> 01:00:01,353
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

442
01:00:01,353 --> 01:00:04,073
All have to meditate.

443
01:00:04,073 --> 01:00:06,833
Only in meditation you are in present

444
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:09,633
and you grow in your spirituality.

445
01:00:09,633 --> 01:00:13,633
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

446
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:17,193
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

447
01:00:17,193 --> 01:00:20,793
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

448
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,673
no doubt.

449
01:00:24,033 --> 01:00:25,753
We really grow very fast.

450
01:00:25,753 --> 01:00:28,553
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

451
01:00:28,553 --> 01:00:30,713
the way he has changed.

452
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:32,513
And then, once you get used to it,

453
01:00:32,753 --> 01:00:35,233
you'll never give it up.

454
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:37,193
Is very simple meditation.

455
01:00:37,193 --> 01:00:39,953
You have foot soaking or something like that

456
01:00:39,953 --> 01:00:43,073
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

457
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:44,753
that's all.

458
01:00:45,513 --> 01:00:47,793
Is not that you have to do

459
01:00:47,793 --> 01:00:51,233
one lakh jappas or something.

460
01:00:51,233 --> 01:00:52,713
Nothing of the kind.

461
01:00:52,713 --> 01:00:54,433
Is very simple.

462
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:56,633
But this, you have to do for yourself,

463
01:00:56,633 --> 01:01:02,953
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

464
01:01:05,433 --> 01:01:12,193
We have lots of advantages over others.

465
01:01:12,193 --> 01:01:14,473
But one thing I have to tell you,

466
01:01:14,473 --> 01:01:19,673
those people who are not prone to seeking,

467
01:01:19,673 --> 01:01:23,233
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

468
01:01:23,233 --> 01:01:26,233
Don't waste your energy on such people,

469
01:01:26,233 --> 01:01:28,233
discussing and arguing,

470
01:01:28,233 --> 01:01:30,993
because it cannot be discussed much.

471
01:01:30,993 --> 01:01:33,673
You just forget them and leave them alone.

472
01:01:33,673 --> 01:01:35,273
I'll look after them.

473
01:01:35,273 --> 01:01:39,073
You just take to simple people, good people,

474
01:01:39,073 --> 01:01:43,153
who are seeking the truth.

475
01:01:43,153 --> 01:01:45,713
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

476
01:01:45,713 --> 01:01:49,473
who are just believing in discussion,

477
01:01:49,393 --> 01:01:52,833
arguments and shabda jaal.

478
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:57,153
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

479
01:01:57,153 --> 01:02:00,273
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

480
01:02:00,273 --> 01:02:02,793
there's something special

481
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:07,833
and that they have something very unique

482
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:13,633
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

483
01:02:13,633 --> 01:02:16,193
All these things, you should understand,

484
01:02:16,193 --> 01:02:19,313
have come to you spontaneously from within,

485
01:02:19,313 --> 01:02:22,873
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

486
01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:26,353
Should never be shy of your virtues.

487
01:02:27,673 --> 01:02:29,513
And whatever people may try

488
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:31,913
to tell you that "You better do this and better do that"

489
01:02:31,913 --> 01:02:33,873
if it is wrong you should never do it.

490
01:02:32,553 --> 01:02:38,713
Because, now, you are very powerful

491
01:02:33,873 --> 01:02:36,473
Should just say, "I don't want to do it."

492
01:02:43,673 --> 01:02:45,913
and that you have to lead the people

493
01:02:45,913 --> 01:02:47,593
and people don't have to lead you.

494
01:02:47,593 --> 01:02:49,553
Fashions don't have to lead you,

495
01:02:49,553 --> 01:02:52,033
but you have to create fashions.

496
01:02:52,033 --> 01:02:55,753
You have to create a path for them.

497
01:02:55,753 --> 01:02:58,633
It's not that you have to

498
01:02:58,633 --> 01:03:02,593
trod on the path that they have made.

499
01:03:02,593 --> 01:03:04,033
Try to understand

500
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:07,393
that your own personality

501
01:03:07,393 --> 01:03:12,593
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

502
01:03:12,593 --> 01:03:16,233
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

503
01:03:16,233 --> 01:03:21,473
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

504
01:03:21,473 --> 01:03:23,553
Don't get ideas from them

505
01:03:23,553 --> 01:03:25,193
and don't get frightened

506
01:03:25,193 --> 01:03:27,673
when they try to tell you something

507
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:30,593
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

508
01:03:30,593 --> 01:03:35,713
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

509
01:03:35,713 --> 01:03:38,633
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

510
01:03:38,633 --> 01:03:42,033
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

511
01:03:42,033 --> 01:03:45,033
that it worked out.

512
01:03:46,913 --> 01:03:48,393
I didn't have to,

513
01:03:48,393 --> 01:03:52,593
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

514
01:03:52,593 --> 01:03:57,233
I just started it.

515
01:03:57,673 --> 01:04:00,393
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

516
01:04:00,593 --> 01:04:04,313
not so much agreed to, doesn't matter.

517
01:04:04,313 --> 01:04:07,353
I started the whole thing on My own,

518
01:04:07,353 --> 01:04:09,193
worked it out on My own,

519
01:04:09,193 --> 01:04:12,513
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

520
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:15,833
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

521
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:18,913
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

522
01:04:18,913 --> 01:04:20,993
It has happened.

523
01:04:20,993 --> 01:04:23,953
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

524
01:04:23,953 --> 01:04:25,753
All of you should, first of all,

525
01:04:25,753 --> 01:04:28,073
see that you are not a conditioned person

526
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,353
and you do not have an ego

527
01:04:30,353 --> 01:04:33,233
and then you should go ahead with it

528
01:04:33,233 --> 01:04:36,593
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

529
01:04:36,593 --> 01:04:40,353
Today's puja is very short puja.

530
01:04:40,633 --> 01:04:44,833
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

531
01:04:45,193 --> 01:04:48,473
There are so many things which I cannot,

532
01:04:48,473 --> 01:04:54,233
at this time, which is short, tell you

533
01:04:54,233 --> 01:04:57,193
but if you sit down, you can easily make

534
01:04:57,193 --> 01:05:01,313
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

535
01:05:01,313 --> 01:05:04,673
So, now put your mind to it

536
01:05:04,673 --> 01:05:09,193
in a way that you are the organizer.

537
01:05:09,193 --> 01:05:11,953
Then what should you do? What can you do?

538
01:05:11,953 --> 01:05:13,233
What are you going to achieve?

539
01:05:13,233 --> 01:05:17,873
Please try and it will work out.

540
01:05:18,553 --> 01:05:20,353
All of you can do it.

541
01:05:20,353 --> 01:05:23,393
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

542
01:05:23,393 --> 01:05:26,433
and write it down in that: what you have done,

543
01:05:26,433 --> 01:05:28,513
how many people you have given realization,

544
01:05:28,513 --> 01:05:33,153
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

545
01:05:33,153 --> 01:05:35,713
But now, if there's no diary,

546
01:05:35,713 --> 01:05:37,033
Sahaja yogis can say among,

547
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:40,113
"Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow." No,

548
01:05:40,113 --> 01:05:43,153
you start it today.

549
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:47,513
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

550
01:05:47,513 --> 01:05:51,433
is that they take things little lightly.

551
01:05:54,473 --> 01:05:58,833
Of course, that is their character.

552
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:02,393
But not Sahaja Yoga.

553
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:04,673
Other things you can take lightly.

554
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:06,433
If somebody shouts at you,

555
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:07,913
somebody gets angry with you,

556
01:06:07,913 --> 01:06:10,473
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

557
01:06:10,473 --> 01:06:13,433
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

558
01:06:13,433 --> 01:06:15,393
because you are the spirit.

559
01:06:15,393 --> 01:06:16,993
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

560
01:06:16,993 --> 01:06:19,873
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

561
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:24,233
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

562
01:06:24,233 --> 01:06:26,513
your attitude should be different.

563
01:06:26,513 --> 01:06:28,713
If you are relaxing on one side,

564
01:06:28,913 --> 01:06:32,073
another side you have to be dynamic

565
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:34,953
and that side is where you have to put forward

566
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:36,513
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

567
01:06:36,513 --> 01:06:38,273
when you have to talk to people,

568
01:06:38,273 --> 01:06:40,553
you have to organize a press conference

569
01:06:40,553 --> 01:06:42,673
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

570
01:06:42,673 --> 01:06:44,673
At whatever level you want to work it out,

571
01:06:44,673 --> 01:06:47,113
please make a proper plan about it

572
01:06:47,113 --> 01:06:49,233
and just do it.

573
01:06:49,233 --> 01:06:53,593
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

574
01:06:53,913 --> 01:06:59,273
With all these ideas that I have,

575
01:07:00,393 --> 01:07:03,393
you have many more

576
01:07:03,393 --> 01:07:07,353
and I hope by next year,

577
01:07:07,353 --> 01:07:10,073
we'll see manifestation of those.

578
01:07:10,073 --> 01:07:12,233
I hope many people will write books

579
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:14,553
like U.C. Rai has written.

580
01:07:14,553 --> 01:07:20,473
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

581
01:07:20,473 --> 01:07:23,313
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

582
01:07:23,313 --> 01:07:26,033
Everything he has done single-handed.

583
01:07:26,033 --> 01:07:28,753
So beautifully he has worked it out.

584
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:34,233
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

585
01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:37,513
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

586
01:07:37,313 --> 01:07:40,473
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

587
01:07:40,553 --> 01:07:45,593
But it should be honest, very honest book.

588
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:48,993
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

589
01:07:48,993 --> 01:07:53,593
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

590
01:07:53,593 --> 01:07:55,793
All those who have such ideas

591
01:07:55,793 --> 01:08:01,393
should make an effort to create some new books,

592
01:08:01,393 --> 01:08:06,633
some new ideas, some new creation.

593
01:08:06,633 --> 01:08:08,673
Is very important

594
01:08:08,673 --> 01:08:10,713
because in these modern times

595
01:08:10,713 --> 01:08:13,993
people want to do something new,

596
01:08:13,993 --> 01:08:16,913
something novel.

597
01:08:17,513 --> 01:08:19,713
Under these circumstances,

598
01:08:19,713 --> 01:08:22,513
I'm sure you all will work out.

599
01:08:23,153 --> 01:08:26,593
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

600
01:08:26,593 --> 01:08:31,713
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

601
01:08:31,713 --> 01:08:35,553
and then these can be properly put together,

602
01:08:35,553 --> 01:08:39,513
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

603
01:08:39,513 --> 01:08:42,513
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

604
01:08:42,513 --> 01:08:45,793
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

605
01:08:49,873 --> 01:08:53,433
This is a very opportune time.

606
01:08:53,793 --> 01:09:02,513
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

607
01:09:19,753 --> 01:09:23,553
And what will be the symptom

608
01:09:23,553 --> 01:09:29,473
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

609
01:09:38,233 --> 01:09:40,513
Whatever people may try,

610
01:09:40,513 --> 01:09:43,433
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

611
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:44,913
Satyame vijayate.

612
01:09:44,913 --> 01:09:49,833
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

613
01:09:52,923 --> 01:09:55,963
For this I congratulate you again and again.

614
01:09:55,963 --> 01:09:59,643
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

615
01:09:59,643 --> 01:10:03,203
May God bless you all.
