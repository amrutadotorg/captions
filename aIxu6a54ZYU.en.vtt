00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:22.550
in the West we have become very speedy

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:36.460
no doubt and to bring down the spell

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:36.460
speed we have to use meditative process

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.870
that we feel our peace within ourselves

00:00:48.220 --> 00:01:03.300
also the thoughts are bombarding our

00:00:52.330 --> 00:01:03.300
minds and we react very fast

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:23.240
to others and to these thoughts so one

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:27.729
has to be aware one has to be knowing

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.729
what is happening within yourself that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:44.119
the thoughts are bombarding you you are

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:53.929
trying to ascend and you find it very

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:59.840
difficult to get rid of the thoughts the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:02.899
thought process can start by your

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.380
conditioning or by your ego only two

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.380
problems

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.360
and you are the one who is under the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.360
challenge

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.840
so you have got these simple people in

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:39.599
the village who start watching

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:43.920
everything but they do not react if you

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:51.959
do not react then your thoughts will

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:58.340
give up so the first thing should be to

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.340
watch yourself that you are not reacting

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:11.280
but you are are experiencing and

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:17.879
enjoying the silence the subtleties the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:25.590
beauty the glory of your being as well

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:33.090
as whatever is around you don't have to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:37.370
force yourself to break this habit but

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.370
just to be on the watch out

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:58.010
it's not necessary to talk too much

00:03:42.800 --> 00:04:03.500
about it also not it is necessary to

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:08.290
think about anything because supposing

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:12.980
you see a tree soul it's a tree only

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.170
what are we going to think about it and

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:22.070
whatever we may think about it it's

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:24.470
going to be the tree so there's no harm

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.820
in appearing little bit stupid doesn't

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:34.190
matter but this is the basic thing is

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:41.900
that when we start analyzing we are

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:50.960
breaking our own nerves and poisoning

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:54.650
our own mind and brain so to watch

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:02.870
something without analysis without

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:04.970
thinking about it is reality if you can

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.440
achieve that point where you watch

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:12.010
everything without reacting you are in

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.010
relative

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:28.639
and then only the penetration into the

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:35.990
subtleties of your surroundings of your

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:45.620
relationships your friendships the whole

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:49.960
universe dance upon you so to judge

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:56.960
others to think of others what they are

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:59.090
doing what's wrong with them about

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:04.130
anything whatsoever

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:09.950
you may think is wrong he's not going to

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:13.310
be corrected like I know some people who

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:18.020
are specially bureaucrats they are

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:21.770
traveling supposing by the car then they

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:26.510
will say I think you see this road

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:28.400
should have gone this way or I think it

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:34.340
would have been nice if this house was

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:39.110
facing the other way but it's not see it

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:43.099
is not going to face it is going to be

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:47.270
the way it is so what is the use of

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:50.570
wasting your brain your mind your

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:55.940
thought in suggesting thump something

00:06:50.570 --> 00:07:01.310
which doesn't work out and never going

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:06.710
to work out either so when we start like

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:10.900
I think these trees should have been a

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.900
little taller but they are not

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.260
I think

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:33.550
that the crows should stop their noise

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:39.409
they will not so just accept it

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:44.180
acceptance is the way we are going to

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:46.729
enjoy but acceptance doesn't mean

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:52.400
tolerance because tolerance means you

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:55.729
have to work very hard to accept that

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.060
the trees are of the same height they

00:07:55.729 --> 00:08:01.129
can't grow it's too much worry and you

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:05.199
say I have to tolerate it you see

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:05.199
because my mind doesn't accept

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:19.439
so acceptance as it is whatever you see

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:21.659
acceptance and that is how people grow I

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:25.879
have seen those who start accepting

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:30.059
that's the sign that's the sign of their

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:33.899
strength and their depth like the

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:44.009
propensity of this mother earth she is

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:52.649
what she is and she bears whatever is

00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:54.990
there if you put a heavy thing on her

00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:59.009
she'll put equal and opposite force and

00:08:54.990 --> 00:09:03.589
wear it she doesn't say I'm tolerating

00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:13.500
it I am exerting any pressure

00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:17.850
she's just accepting so the witnessing

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:23.959
and awareness develops when we start

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:27.410
just accepting things as they're I think

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:27.410
don't work

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:40.339
I think it would have been better like

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:48.410
this doesn't work out then second

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:55.639
problem is I like now I like to eat a

00:09:48.410 --> 00:10:02.149
cake but there is no cake what to do now

00:09:55.639 --> 00:10:05.980
whatever is there enjoy it as a cake but

00:10:02.149 --> 00:10:10.339
if you go on thinking like that I like

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:15.319
whatever is not here you can never be

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:23.930
happy as simple as that you have to say

00:10:15.319 --> 00:10:27.470
I like whatever is there I enjoy

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:34.880
whatever is there there that's the

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:47.149
reality whatever doesn't exist if you

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:50.569
like it so what can anybody do about it

00:10:47.149 --> 00:10:58.939
works out in so many ways in so many

00:10:50.569 --> 00:11:00.740
facets in life that advantage is taken

00:10:58.939 --> 00:11:03.470
by people because we become so

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:08.569
vulnerable to our likes and dislikes

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:10.610
that the enterpreneur take over and they

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:15.649
create likes and dislikes in our heads

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:18.740
and put ideas every day I've seen it now

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:22.910
how they do it through television

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:28.819
through newspaper there is that so then

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:33.290
you say now I like this but from where

00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:37.269
this liking has come is the conditioning

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.269
which is put into her head

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:46.710
so you are a slave of that condition I

00:11:49.470 --> 00:12:04.480
only like roses and I don't like any

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:15.060
other flower why why you don't like any

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:15.060
other flower and for such things

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:31.500
whatever we have we miss the joy so the

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:31.500
second part should be that enjoyability

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:49.550
why am I here it's not a very

00:12:42.890 --> 00:13:02.990
comfortable place by any chance so why

00:12:49.550 --> 00:13:07.910
am I here to enjoy each other to enjoy

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:11.510
your own being the more divergence you

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:16.910
have outside appealing to your ego and

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:30.790
conditioning the more your mind is busy

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:30.790
with that then you cannot enjoy anything
