1
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:18,346
Today, it’s a great day for all of us,
the seekers,

2
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:25,964
that the last work of the Divine,

3
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:31,040
of opening the last centre

4
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:41,186
in the Great Primordial Being, was done
on the 5th of May 1970.

5
00:02:58,084 --> 00:03:08,880
It is the greatest event of all the
spiritual happenings of the Universe.

6
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:29,959
It was done with very great care and
great adjustments.

7
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:48,656
It is not in the limits of human
understanding,

8
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:54,112
how things are worked in the heavens.

9
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:11,999
It is your fortune and God’s love

10
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,614
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

11
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:32,106
Without this happening, there could not
have been

12
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:42,413
a possibility to give mass Realisation
to people.

13
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:55,111
One could have done it for one or two
persons here and there,

14
00:04:55,312 --> 00:05:02,909
but to give such a mass awakening could
not have been possible.

15
00:05:12,252 --> 00:05:22,963
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are
the seats of the seven main chakras.

16
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:38,821
There are one thousand nadis or, as they
call it, flames,

17
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:51,199
and they all have each sixteen thousand
powers.

18
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:12,459
Every nadi deals with a particular type
of a person

19
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:23,067
and, with the permutations and combinations

20
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:33,893
of all these nadis, human beings are
looked after.

21
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:43,307
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

22
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:54,205
the whole atmosphere was filled with
tremendous chaitanya

23
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:10,315
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

24
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:18,815
and the whole thing came on this Earth

25
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:26,707
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

26
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,681
with such a tremendous force,

27
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:52,239
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

28
00:07:57,971 --> 00:08:04,449
The happening was so unexpected and
so tremendous

29
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:15,380
that I was stunned and I became completely
silent at its grandeur.

30
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:42,585
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like
a big furnace,

31
00:08:50,284 --> 00:09:00,908
and the furnace was very silent but
a burning appearance it had:

32
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:12,144
as if you heat up some metal and it has
many colours, in the same way,

33
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:19,241
the Kundalini showed up like a huge
furnace, you can say;

34
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,523
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

35
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:40,473
where you see these plants you have for
coal burning to create electricity;

36
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:55,233
and it stretched like a telescope one after
another,

37
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:59,960
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot,
like that.

38
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:17,168
And the Deities came and sat on their
seats,

39
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,930
on their golden seats,

40
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:38,682
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

41
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,508
like a big dome,

42
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:53,156
and opened it,

43
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,788
and then this torrential rain

44
00:11:00,472 --> 00:11:04,320
completely drenched me

45
00:11:08,957 --> 00:11:15,761
and I started seeing all that and got lost
into the joy.

46
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:31,434
It was like an artist seeing its own
creation fulfilled.

47
00:11:31,635 --> 00:11:36,637
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

48
00:11:51,129 --> 00:12:00,189
After coming out of that beautiful
experience

49
00:12:05,294 --> 00:12:13,336
I looked around and I saw human beings
so blind

50
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:22,695
and I became absolutely silent.

51
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:38,181
Then I desired that I should get the cups
to fill this nectar.

52
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:53,291
But I saw all stones.

53
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:07,340
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part
of your being.

54
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:18,938
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals
of different colours

55
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,871
appearing like inflated flames.

56
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:38,585
It is a thing which is seen by many people

57
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:50,455
but to see it pour that torrential rain

58
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:00,470
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

59
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:10,074
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

60
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:20,405
Can you think of a flower pouring
its colour and its fragrance around?

61
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:31,751
People have written very little about
Sahasrara,

62
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:41,212
because whatever they have seen
is from outside

63
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:52,223
and it’s not possible for them to go
from inside.

64
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,042
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole
Sahasrara is not opened out,

65
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,759
you cannot see its beauty;

66
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,294
because when it is closed, the whole
of it, the total,

67
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:18,647
then you just pass through a little
aperture and get out of it.

68
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:34,098
But just imagine a huge big petaled,
thousand petaled lotus,

69
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:41,723
and you are sitting inside, in the corona
and looking at all these petals —

70
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,734
all very beautifully coloured, and
fragrant,

71
00:15:55,935 --> 00:16:03,080
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

72
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:28,900
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position,
is the ideal situation.

73
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:48,143
But then, after the silence, you are filled
with tremendous compassion and love,

74
00:16:55,382 --> 00:17:03,574
and you are drawn out to people

75
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:12,501
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

76
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:28,468
And thus you try to put your attention
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

77
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:43,260
and then you start seeing the problems
that exist in the Sahasrara.

78
00:17:49,135 --> 00:18:00,766
And even if you desire to ope
 the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

79
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:15,079
because the channelising from the Divine
to human beings

80
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,107
has to be through human beings.

81
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,998
The power could be with you,

82
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:39,764
but it has to be channelised through
human element.

83
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:53,702
All My life I had not known many
realised-souls.

84
00:18:58,157 --> 00:19:01,279
How to get them?

85
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,849
How to work it out?

86
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,967
So I started looking out for people,

87
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:23,541
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

88
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:31,667
and she was very perturbed about
something very gross;

89
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:40,217
and when she came to Me she felt
very peaceful.

90
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:47,034
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

91
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:58,940
And in My company she would think
of something else, not of the Spirit.

92
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:08,939
And her brain would be covered with clouds

93
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,405
and darkness.

94
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:20,879
Again and again I had to enlighten it

95
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:26,951
but she did not get her Realisation.

96
00:20:29,088 --> 00:20:35,841
Most of the people who came to Me
in the beginning came for getting cured.

97
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:44,113
This capacity I had from childhood.

98
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:50,770
And I could also give Realisation to a few
people before,

99
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:59,396
but they had to be very earnest – ardent.

100
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:09,247
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

101
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,865
because I was not living in the forest,

102
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:23,472
I was living as a normal human being
among other normal human beings,

103
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:39,181
and they were not that earnest, that
ardent,

104
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:46,833
and I had to do this work among them.

105
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:56,232
How to talk to them about the real world
that exists

106
00:21:56,433 --> 00:22:00,681
and the false [one] in which they live?

107
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:17,355
And one lady, the first one who got
Realisation, just came to see Me

108
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:24,269
because she was possessed with the idea
of seeking, she thought,

109
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:33,000
and it worked in her.

110
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:41,351
That was not the happiest day,

111
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:49,903
because she’s one of those who get
individually Realisation.

112
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:59,848
With this great happening many should get
at a time.

113
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,996
We had a programme in Bordi

114
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,405
in ’70,

115
00:23:16,892 --> 00:23:23,857
and there, first, one gentleman got
Realisation in the evening.

116
00:23:29,197 --> 00:23:36,323
Next day there were negative forces acting
[in the] morning time,

117
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:44,819
and they started talking of favouritism.

118
00:23:48,002 --> 00:23:53,977
I could see in the atmosphere the
vibrations were going wrong.

119
00:23:58,392 --> 00:24:05,841
In the evening I took up a very strong,
firm attitude.

120
00:24:10,437 --> 00:24:14,339
I was in a great fury.

121
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:21,094
I had never gone into such a fury before

122
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:26,641
and I lashed out at them.

123
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:36,269
Surprisingly, twelve of them got
Realisation,

124
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:45,184
That was the greatest moment.

125
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:51,444
Then many got, one by one.

126
00:24:56,206 --> 00:24:59,783
Three of them who were travelling back,
got Realisation.

127
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:04,540
Suddenly, in the train, they felt
the vibrations.

128
00:25:11,216 --> 00:25:16,257
So the mass evolution started.

129
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:25,312
Sahasrara is your awareness.

130
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:29,890
When it is enlightened

131
00:25:31,336 --> 00:25:38,621
you get into the technique of the Divine.

132
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:43,248
Now there are two techniques:
the technique of the Divine,

133
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:47,579
and the technique that you follow.

134
00:25:54,016 --> 00:26:03,364
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use
the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

135
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:20,099
For example, Divine looks after all
the Universal happenings:

136
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:31,699
every minutest particle is controlled
by Divine.

137
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:39,587
When your Sahasrara opens out

138
00:26:40,486 --> 00:26:48,947
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle
bone,

139
00:26:54,488 --> 00:27:00,791
sort of an igniting force is ready in your
Sahasrara,

140
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:15,474
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area
opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

141
00:27:20,284 --> 00:27:28,482
the grace of your Spirit ignites that
igniting force

142
00:27:32,991 --> 00:27:39,105
and your nadis get enlightened;

143
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,399
not all of them,

144
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,171
quite a lot of them;

145
00:27:49,372 --> 00:27:53,843
not all the length,

146
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:58,912
but quite the peripheries.

147
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:06,244
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

148
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:13,330
So many things happen

149
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:20,354
because, also, of your seven centres
being in the Sahasrara.

150
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:30,182
With the light you see their relative
positions.

151
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:40,974
I mean you do not see, but it work
 in your conscious mind.

152
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:52,429
Your conscious mind feels that integration
within you.

153
00:29:01,588 --> 00:29:09,824
The rationality which is separated from
the heart becomes one with the heart.

154
00:29:15,865 --> 00:29:19,518
It becomes one with your attention.

155
00:29:20,553 --> 00:29:24,635
Wherever your attention goes

156
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:29,774
you act in a collective way.

157
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:37,338
All the activities of your attention are
blessed.

158
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:45,315
The attention itself is effective.

159
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:51,731
Your attention is very important,

160
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:58,587
your desires are even more important.

161
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:10,052
Because it is such an integrated thing,
your desires and your attention become one.

162
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,651
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

163
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:26,611
and your attention goes to the thing,
whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

164
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:38,115
The priorities change very fast.

165
00:30:40,617 --> 00:30:46,077
Those people who are primitive and
not evolved

166
00:30:47,825 --> 00:30:52,052
may not find that happening

167
00:30:55,507 --> 00:30:59,915
but those who are over mentally developed,

168
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:07,843
they actually have an attention which
they try to test.

169
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:14,073
They first want to see how to raise
the Kundalini.

170
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:18,932
They want to see that it is logical.

171
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:31,078
For a balanced person there’s no
questioning at all.

172
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:39,929
We have some people like that among us.

173
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:46,053
They just became and they never questioned.

174
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:52,521
They just settled down.

175
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:59,108
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

176
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:03,549
above all they are spiritual.

177
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:08,396
But whatever may be the defect
in the quality

178
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:12,637
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

179
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:21,236
First of all you have to put down your ego

180
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:26,195
because if ego is there it presses
the Sahasrara.

181
00:32:30,187 --> 00:32:33,752
Also the super-ego must be reduced

182
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:40,815
because it also presses the Sahasrara
and gives pain.

183
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:52,509
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy
state

184
00:32:52,710 --> 00:33:00,586
one has to understand that the priorities
are to be changed.

185
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:14,395
Some people take time, so they have to put
some deliberate effort.

186
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:28,044
There are many books, if you read them,
they suggest anti-God activities.

187
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:36,935
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

188
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,813
it closes back.

189
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:45,522
That’s like a poison.

190
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:51,821
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought
to come in the mind.

191
00:33:55,934 --> 00:34:00,055
If you go about with the poison

192
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,506
then it again closes.

193
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:17,019
In the same way the people who are hot
tempered, very much hot tempered,

194
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:22,628
and all other problems of the ego,

195
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:28,393
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

196
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:35,118
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing
down.

197
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:41,237
Those people who have had conditioning
from wrong gurus,

198
00:34:43,884 --> 00:34:46,845
and wrong books,

199
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:50,175
from wrong parents maybe,

200
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:53,639
from a wrong country,

201
00:34:56,402 --> 00:35:00,184
from a wrong livelihood

202
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:08,421
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow
in it’s healthy way.

203
00:35:13,596 --> 00:35:19,353
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has
to grow, not the Spirit.

204
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,119
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

205
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,664
the more it receives the Spiritual
qualities of the Spirit.

206
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:45,303
Actually the peace is felt in
the Sahasrara.

207
00:35:46,988 --> 00:35:51,259
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

208
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:58,548
because that is the brain, and the brain
is the epitome of our nervous system,

209
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:02,775
central nervous system, of consciousness
itself.

210
00:36:09,189 --> 00:36:15,409
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara,
the work is not done.

211
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:25,801
We have to have more and more channels

212
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:32,918
who will act on these nadis with their
different powers,

213
00:36:37,356 --> 00:36:44,871
and who can work it out in a proper
systematic manner.

214
00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:58,341
But those people who indulge into wasteful
habits after Realisation,

215
00:37:03,644 --> 00:37:08,058
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

216
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:16,782
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

217
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,214
Such people should really leave Sahaja
Yoga and spare [us].

218
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:39,544
Or such people should be asked to leave
and one should severe relations

219
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:47,379
with such people who is standing against
such a great work of the Divine.

220
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:03,406
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara
should know

221
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:07,743
that he should not have bad company,

222
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:16,982
but always have the company of the other
sahaja yogis.

223
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,682
He should not have his own holidays
and her own time,

224
00:38:23,883 --> 00:38:30,455
but most of the time he should spend in
the company of other sahaja yogis.

225
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:45,050
After the Sahasrara, when you are above
Sahasrara then you can see

226
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:54,395
that it is very important that all these
nadis must be kept together.

227
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:15,973
And all the centres and the Deities must
be kept awakened and integrated.

228
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:28,428
This can be done even with a conscious
effort

229
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:35,649
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

230
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:44,055
You will start seeing your ego and your
superego.

231
00:39:45,398 --> 00:39:51,952
You will be able to see how you cheat
yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

232
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:02,131
how you are convincing yourself that
you are very good,

233
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:09,416
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

234
00:40:12,053 --> 00:40:18,422
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

235
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:30,254
so all other things must drop out.

236
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:39,455
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

237
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,023
One can do it through conscious mind,
as I said,

238
00:40:47,224 --> 00:40:53,711
that you can really correct yourself

239
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:09,250
because after Realisation whatever you
desire becomes a part of the Divine desire

240
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:21,234
and whatever you do becomes a part
of the Divine action.

241
00:41:24,586 --> 00:41:30,377
So one has to remember that with
conscious effort

242
00:41:30,578 --> 00:41:38,013
we can find out ourselves and see if we
are really honest about it.

243
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:44,943
If one is honest one can see that
collectivity

244
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:50,875
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

245
00:41:59,003 --> 00:42:03,041
For that tolerance is needed,

246
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:08,419
wisdom is needed,

247
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,622
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

248
00:42:18,545 --> 00:42:21,392
which you are,

249
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:28,242
and you should talk like a prophet.

250
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:37,727
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

251
00:42:41,974 --> 00:42:48,469
How does a prophet speaks? How does
a prophet speak?

252
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:55,660
This is not insincere or acting

253
00:42:58,321 --> 00:43:01,482
because now you are awakened.

254
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:10,817
When you are not awakened then whatever
you do like this is artificial.

255
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:39,079
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding,
evolving force

256
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:56,757
and so to keep it absolutely ready for
growth and expansion

257
00:44:02,124 --> 00:44:10,281
one has to watch one’s own growth.

258
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:19,826
Never justify your wrongdoings.

259
00:44:24,646 --> 00:44:31,305
If you start justifying, you are actually
thinking about that.

260
00:44:34,498 --> 00:44:39,075
We have no time to think about oneself.

261
00:44:42,656 --> 00:44:47,180
You have to think of others

262
00:44:47,381 --> 00:44:51,027
because others are also in your brain;

263
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:57,391
and when you start thinking of others,

264
00:44:57,774 --> 00:45:03,548
talking to them about their resurrection,

265
00:45:06,391 --> 00:45:16,267
your Sahasrara will definitely increase
in its size and in its sensibility.

266
00:45:23,213 --> 00:45:26,818
The sensitivity will also increase,

267
00:45:27,765 --> 00:45:30,704
the depth will also come in.

268
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:37,917
It is just like a tree, when it grows,
its roots spread very strong.

269
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:49,779
So you have to come out of your shells

270
00:45:53,495 --> 00:45:56,947
and spread your wings.

271
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:03,041
All small things of mind

272
00:46:06,535 --> 00:46:09,302
must be given up.

273
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:20,328
You have to live like a very, huge,
big personality

274
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:30,846
which has to give support,

275
00:46:31,776 --> 00:46:35,564
guidance, help

276
00:46:35,765 --> 00:46:40,617
and awakening to thousands.

277
00:46:41,694 --> 00:46:48,619
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

278
00:46:51,772 --> 00:46:58,100
establishes a new dynamism

279
00:46:59,808 --> 00:47:02,787
in this country,

280
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:06,425
I am sure

281
00:47:07,276 --> 00:47:13,261
that it will catch up with the thought
of the people.

282
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:25,162
It will resound into their brains,

283
00:47:28,744 --> 00:47:33,641
their unconscious will transmit it into
their being

284
00:47:38,516 --> 00:47:44,081
and they will start thinking afresh.

285
00:47:48,439 --> 00:47:53,875
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

286
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:06,480
and people will start going towards
Truth logically.

287
00:48:11,895 --> 00:48:15,316
They’ll come to right conclusions.

288
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,537
They’ll drop out all that is useless and
wasteful.

289
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:33,931
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

290
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,581
and the bigger is the king, the bigger
is the throne.

291
00:48:43,306 --> 00:48:46,437
The way you treat your Spirit

292
00:48:46,638 --> 00:48:52,252
is expressed through the way you
have your Sahasrara.

293
00:48:59,746 --> 00:49:07,634
As it is the seven chakras are seated
in the Sahasrara,

294
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:17,272
you become the master of all these seven
chakras,

295
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:28,941
and that’s how you can do Realisation,
you can give Realisation.

296
00:49:34,912 --> 00:49:39,507
And then you can become a subtle being.

297
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:45,475
Through your conscious effort,

298
00:49:45,676 --> 00:49:51,833
you can enter into the beings of others and
raise their Kundalini and correct them.

299
00:49:57,642 --> 00:50:01,868
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives
you a new sight

300
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:09,222
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle
things in the atmosphere.

301
00:50:15,113 --> 00:50:17,639
When you start developing higher and
higher,

302
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:23,985
you can see the vibrations as lights around
you.

303
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:34,458
You may not have any interest in many
things

304
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:42,178
but you’ll be amazed how you become
the master of so many things.

305
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:53,923
As if your brain is materialising whatever
you have been desiring.

306
00:51:00,282 --> 00:51:09,453
And this is what is Krishna promised, who
is actually the Virata.

307
00:51:15,923 --> 00:51:22,333
So you become the master of your brain

308
00:51:23,462 --> 00:51:28,631
because actually the Spirit is master
of the brain.

309
00:51:30,603 --> 00:51:36,572
The more you start bringing Spirit into
your attention,

310
00:51:36,773 --> 00:51:42,489
the more the Sahasrara increases
in its size.

311
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:51,943
And the light of that expands

312
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:58,131
and you become [a] more powerful
sahaja yogi.

313
00:52:01,348 --> 00:52:05,483
This is the greatest thing also for God
Almighty

314
00:52:05,684 --> 00:52:09,852
to see that this has happened,
so that He can,

315
00:52:10,053 --> 00:52:17,722
for the time being, postpone His anger
and wrath;

316
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:37,238
so that He can forgive human beings
for their mistakes,

317
00:52:42,097 --> 00:52:46,616
their obstinacy

318
00:52:46,817 --> 00:52:52,667
and childish pranks.

319
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,934
Let the man rise

320
00:53:01,414 --> 00:53:07,610
to see the glory and the greatness
of his Father.

321
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:19,126
Let him have so much of power that he
can bear the compassion of God.

322
00:53:29,758 --> 00:53:40,677
Let the Sahasrara develop into such
dimensions that it can execute

323
00:53:40,886 --> 00:53:47,458
the working of the Divine through his own
conscious mind.

324
00:53:57,115 --> 00:54:01,093
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is
“Nirmala”,

325
00:54:01,294 --> 00:54:06,191
faning: must keep it clean, pure and immaculate.

326
00:54:16,651 --> 00:54:20,661
That is what is your job,

327
00:54:22,678 --> 00:54:28,302
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

328
00:54:32,581 --> 00:54:40,895
And this will definitely mark another step,
another accelerated jump

329
00:54:41,096 --> 00:54:49,811
into a new dimension of many more human
beings.

330
00:55:03,486 --> 00:55:07,728
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris
today,

331
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:13,641
so that the whole world attention should
be on Paris,

332
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:21,146
on France, on this country which is really
being cursed;

333
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:37,376
neglected by all the deities,

334
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:44,406
because human beings really went very
wrong.

335
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:57,914
Let all the Deities be settled down in this
country

336
00:56:00,717 --> 00:56:05,057
because this is the attention,

337
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:16,558
and attention, whatever attention we pay,
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

338
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:35,636
So the Sahasrara of France may be
opened out,

339
00:56:39,558 --> 00:56:46,011
so the attention of France should be
directed towards Spirit,

340
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:51,508
and  towards the eternal life.

341
00:56:52,564 --> 00:56:56,935
Is [a] very important country,

342
00:56:58,128 --> 00:57:03,442
that’s why I decided to have this day
celebrated here.

343
00:57:06,975 --> 00:57:13,754
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja
yogis is much greater.

344
00:57:18,605 --> 00:57:22,860
They have to change their methods

345
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:25,719
and styles.

346
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:30,422
They should be very mild, gentle

347
00:57:31,527 --> 00:57:34,967
and healthy people

348
00:57:37,223 --> 00:57:42,578
but at the same time they should be very
strong sahaja yogis,

349
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,680
so that when others see them

350
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:53,589
[they] find that superiority in them.

351
00:57:57,463 --> 00:58:01,877
Before the Sahasrara day we have had
such a successful session.

352
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:05,070
I am very happy about you.

353
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:14,143
May God bless you all.

354
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:19,361
Now I bless all the other centres,

355
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,711
who have prayed and are praying;

356
00:58:24,912 --> 00:58:30,422
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

357
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,553
an enlightened one,

358
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:39,751
that will separate them from their small
shells.

359
00:58:41,633 --> 00:58:45,979
Let them expand so much,

360
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:52,946
that they become one with the whole.

361
00:58:53,147 --> 00:58:56,281
May God bless you all.

362
00:59:03,092 --> 00:59:06,266
May God bless you.

363
00:59:06,787 --> 00:59:09,692
Good (…)
