1
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:17,798
Brothers and Sisters of the World,

2
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:25,880
It is a great honor for Me to talk about global
problems of women in front of this distinguished assembly.

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,105
First of all, I would like to offer My profound
gratitude to the government and people of

4
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:36,730
our host country, the People’s Republic
of China.

5
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,635
I have had a privilege of visiting China on
two previous occasions, and I am a great admirer

6
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:48,335
of the wisdom and culture of this great nation
that I have visited.

7
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:53,865
This is beyond My imagination the most glorious
time in the history of the world, that at

8
00:00:53,865 --> 00:00:58,208
this time we are so much aware of the problems
of women.

9
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:06,351
Women as a whole have definitely suffered
over the ages, as the previous lady has told

10
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:14,540
you, because we have not realized what their
importance is and what their proper role is

11
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,185
in human society.

12
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:22,327
Society itself, which is her creation, tries
to control or put down the womanhood.

13
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:28,228
In the East, we can say, that due to fundamentalist
influence women have been under great pressure

14
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:31,782
and their morality is based on fear rather
than freedom.

15
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:38,875
In the West they have fought for their freedom,
but what they have attained is spurious freedom.

16
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:44,151
The women in the West have freedom to abandon
all social and moral values.

17
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,473
Thus in the East, we can say, that most of
the women are timid, oppressed and cannot

18
00:01:49,473 --> 00:01:55,623
express themselves, while in the West we find
most of the women are reduced to a sex symbol.

19
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,101
They are keen to expose their bodies.

20
00:01:58,101 --> 00:02:03,994
Their anxiety is to appear in fashion advertisements
and very cheap popularity.

21
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:09,136
Most of them accepted this position because
otherwise they could not have survived in

22
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:11,302
that chaotic world of the West.

23
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:17,171
What most of the women in the East would regard
as very humiliating and degrading is regarded

24
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:21,243
as something very glorifying in the West.

25
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:27,351
I have seen both the worlds very deeply and
I feel that unless and until you bring a new

26
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:34,495
culture by which women from the East and West
can both rise in their own esteem and express

27
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:40,217
themselves in such a way that they create
high moral standards for their society, women

28
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:46,201
neither in the East nor in the West will rise
to their full stature of feminine speciality.

29
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:52,176
The speciality is that if women are respected
for their womanhood, understanding what they

30
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:58,559
are capable of and how they can empower themselves
with all the education needed, all the security

31
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:03,162
will be provided to them and they will provide
security to the society.

32
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:09,424
All the fundamentalists who talk of religion
expect women to be absolutely moral and the

33
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:10,977
men can do whatever they like.

34
00:03:10,977 --> 00:03:16,560
I feel we have to educate men more than women,

35
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:23,713
because the idea of war comes also only from the men, in the beginning.

36
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:30,364
I must admit it is not difficult to collect
money for poor women in the developing countries

37
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:35,427
and help them to get out of their poverty,
but unfortunately My knowledge is that the

38
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:43,100
money we are collecting may not reach the
poor women but may end up into the pockets

39
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,030
of the corrupt ministers, bureaucrats and
other people in charge, and ultimately it

40
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,177
will end up in the Swiss Bank.

41
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:56,044
I do not want to criticize any UN organization
because I know they are very honest in their

42
00:03:56,044 --> 00:04:00,844
purpose, but they must be made aware of what
is happening under the table.

43
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:08,890
We in India have two very big states
called as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar which are

44
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,283
very much helped by UNICEF as well as the
World Health Organization.

45
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:18,267
UNICEF started a project called Angan, meaning
“courtyard”, where the children were to

46
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,537
be educated and brought up in a proper shape.

47
00:04:20,537 --> 00:04:27,654
This project is not working at all for the
children, but all the money goes into the

48
00:04:27,654 --> 00:04:32,011
pockets of all the corrupt people who are
in charge of that project and the children

49
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:37,931
do not even get two percent of what is being
sent for them.

50
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:46,383
Same with the World Health Organization, which
is sending medicines and equipment to India.

51
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,252
These medicines are sold in the market and
are completely used by the recipients for

52
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:52,452
their own gains.

53
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:54,954
The same happens to W.H.O. equipment.

54
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:59,332
So the poor people never get any benefit and
they remain all the time helpless.

55
00:04:59,444 --> 00:05:04,545
All this money is called dirty money but goes
to the clean Swiss bank.

56
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:14,895
A large part of the loans which the World
Bank gives to the developing country is also

57
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:19,724
siphoned back to the personal account of the
corrupt officials maintained in Swiss Bank.

58
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:24,706
Thus all the developing countries are indebted
to the World Bank but have no money.

59
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:26,425
The money is in the Swiss Bank.

60
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:31,990
So I would request you all to take this up
with the Swiss Bank and request them to return

61
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:38,976
all such money which has been siphoned in
the Swiss Bank [Applause] by very corrupt

62
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:44,637
people and give this money to the UN so that
the UN can utilize it for the education of

63
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:53,635
women and other purposes as well as what is
to be given to people under very effective vigilance.

64
00:05:53,635 --> 00:06:00,421
One has to have a very good network of people,
especially women, who are involved and who

65
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:05,890
are honest, compassionate and who would like
to make the best out of this money, helping

66
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,015
the women who have to achieve social equality.

67
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:18,193
The main work of womanhood is to create a
good society that would enjoy peace better.

68
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:24,740
Immorality, corruption and violence are the
two horrible monsters which are eating up our society.

69
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,539
I would blame the mothers of these corrupt
and immoral persons because they failed in

70
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,300
their duty as mothers in their childhood.

71
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,985
The loving training of the mother is the first
and most effective influence in shaping the

72
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:40,301
children into beautiful citizens.

73
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,748
Mothers who never tried to guide with great
concern and love, or the wives or the daughters

74
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:50,572
who are falling into the fear of the men or
of the destructive culture, have not done

75
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:56,294
their duty as integral members of the family
to strengthen the moral fiber of the men.

76
00:06:56,294 --> 00:07:01,452
It is important also to see how children are
treated in these two cultures of East and West.

77
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:05,558
What we see in the East is that the children
would listen to their mothers if they are

78
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,108
not under fundamentalist culture.

79
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:14,894
This culture relegates women to the level
of an inferior human being, fit to be dominated

80
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,607
by men and children.

81
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:18,990
In the West also the same thing happens.

82
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,522
Children don’t respect their mothers, neither
do they listen to them.

83
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:29,308
I feel this is because, generally, the Western
women spend more time looking after their

84
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:33,485
bodies and looks than on looking after and
loving their children.

85
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:38,788
The nexus between the mother and children
weakens and then it is for this reason that

86
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:42,000
many children become street urchins and violent.

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,847
Fortunately there are still many families
in the East and some in the West who deeply

88
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:52,796
defy the corrupting influence of today and
look after their children and bring them up properly.

89
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:58,816
But still I must say that the children in
the East are not that much ruined as they are in the West.

90
00:07:58,816 --> 00:08:05,076
The reason, also, is that in the East there
are many people who have not taken to fundamentalist

91
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:10,067
culture or to the Western culture and have
a very good society and produce children who

92
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:13,694
are exceptionally good, though this number
may not be very great.

93
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:19,643
But whatever culture they have inherited,
since long, traditionally, is very much ingrained

94
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:24,970
in them and to them the moral value system
is the highest, more than money or power.

95
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:27,807
The West is full of problems.

96
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,937
Though they have money, they don’t have
peace within themselves.

97
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:39,082
The truth is that women are the potential
power of every civilization and every country.

98
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:44,839
It is evident that women are the creators
and the preservers of the entire humankind.

99
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,783
This is the role which the almighty God has
given, assigned to them.

100
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:52,405
Seeds cannot create anything by themselves.

101
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:57,683
It is the Mother Earth which provides the
flowers and the fruits and other bounties.

102
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:05,163
Similarly, it is the woman who create the
child, who nurtures the baby and eventually

103
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:07,163
brings up the citizen of tomorrow.

104
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:12,274
Women must therefore rank with Mother Earth
as the edifice of the entire humanity.

105
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:17,505
Unfortunately, men have utilized muscle power
to gain a dominating position over women.

106
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:27,952
They have not recognized that women are complementary
and equal, but not similar partners in human endeavors.

107
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:35,121
A society that does not recognize this fundamental
truth and does not give to women their rightful

108
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,121
role is not a civilized society.

109
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:43,548
In My own country there is a saying in Sanskrit,
“Yatra narya pujyante tatra ramante devata”,

110
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:50,669
which means that “Where the women are respected
and respectable, there resides the gods of our well-being."

111
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:58,149
So it is for us, at this moment, to understand
the value of this great power that is given to us by our Creator.

112
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:59,790
But what do we find?

113
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:05,618
Whether in the East or in the West, women
have not been able to give a full manifestation of their greatness.

114
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:12,000
I am not suggesting at all that the only role
of women in human society is that of the mother,

115
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,752
the procreator and preserver of children, or that of a wife, or a sister.

116
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:23,657
Women have a full right to participate as
equal partners in every aspect of life – social,

117
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:28,265
cultural, educational, political, economical,
administrative and the rest.

118
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:34,142
In order to prepare themselves for this all-pervading
role, they must have the right to education

119
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:35,903
in all branches of knowledge.

120
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:41,875
But if they are mothers, they have a great
responsibility towards their children as well as their society.

121
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:47,856
Men are responsible for politics and economics
of the country, but women are responsible for the society.

122
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:54,212
Women can also support men and they can take
a leading part, of course, in any post, but

123
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:59,084
it is very important that they should not
forget they are women who have to manifest

124
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:01,563
deep motherly concern and love.

125
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:06,195
If they become manly and aggressive, the balance
of the society cannot be maintained.

126
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:13,579
At the same time I must submit that, while
we ask for the rights of women, we must also

127
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:17,566
stress the fundamental duties of women to
the human society.

128
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:26,456
The women in the West, or those who are educated
in the West, also some others I have seen,

129
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:34,127
have gone to the other extreme when they are
taking to political, economical or administrative roles.

130
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:41,392
To compete with men they have become much
too self-willed, self-centered and ambitious.

131
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:47,699
They have no more their soothing, pleasing
qualities which can bring peace and balance.

132
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:52,714
On the contrary, they become dominating, pleasure-seeking
individuals.

133
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:58,279
They are far more worried about their physical
attractions than about having a pleasing,

134
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,590
sweet and dignified personality.

135
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:07,065
They give into their baser self much faster
than men, wittingly or unwittingly.

136
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:16,182
All this leads to chaotic societies and children
grow up into street urchins, preparing for wars.

137
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:20,049
What we need is a balance between the two
extremes.

138
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:25,303
We need women as equal but not similar partners
with men, but with a subtle understanding

139
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:31,252
of the nature of men and how to bring them
into the center with their inner balance.

140
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:37,057
We need balanced women in order to have a 
balanced human race with peace within itself.

141
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:42,790
You might say all this is excellent in thought,
but how do we achieve this state of balance?

142
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:50,010
How do we stem the tide of diseases, corruption,
immorality, immaturity and violence?

143
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,158
How do we end the present state of conflict
and confusion?

144
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:57,072
How do we bring about peace within every mind
and heart?

145
00:12:57,072 --> 00:13:01,106
I very humbly submit that there is an answer
to these questions.

146
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:02,795
There is a new way…

147
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:05,824
Do you want Me to tell the new way?

148
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:08,374
Moderator: Just tell them.

149
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,528
You have three more minutes.

150
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:19,889
Whatever I am going to tell you now is not
be taken for granted.

151
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:26,005
You should, of course, have your minds open
like scientists and treat whatever I am stating as a hypothesis.

152
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:31,164
If this hypothesis can be proved, then you
have to accept it as honest persons as the

153
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:34,887
absolute truth because it is for your benevolence.

154
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,274
It is for the benevolence of your family.

155
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:43,696
It is for the benevolence of your country
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

156
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:48,711
I am here to tell you about the last breakthrough
of our evolution.

157
00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:55,616
This breakthrough of our evolution in our
awareness has to happen in these modern times

158
00:13:55,616 --> 00:14:02,761
and has been, moreover, recorded in the writings
of many seers.

159
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:10,121
These are the times called as the “Decadent
Times”, last called by the great saint Vyasa

160
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:15,830
who has written the Gita, and it is the decadence
of humanity that we see around in every way

161
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,821
possible, and unless and until we improve
that, wars cannot be avoided.

162
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:24,471
Now I would like to tell the secret knowledge of our inner being

163
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:26,985
which was known in India thousands of years back.

164
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:32,168
For our evolution and spiritual ascent there
is a residual power within us which is located

165
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:34,287
in the triangular bone at the base of our
spine.

166
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:37,746
This residual power is known as Kundalini.

167
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:42,857
Though the knowledge of this power was available
thousands of years back in India, the awakening

168
00:14:42,857 --> 00:14:46,604
of the Kundalini was done, traditionally,
on an individual basis only.

169
00:14:46,604 --> 00:14:49,848
One guru would give awakening to one disciple.

170
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,141
As a result of that awakening, what happens

171
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,318
is that you achieve your Self Realization, your Selfhood.

172
00:14:55,318 --> 00:15:00,333
Secondly, when this power is awakened, it
rises and passes through six subtle energy

173
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:05,205
centers in your body, nourishing them and
integrating them.

174
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,944
Ultimately, this power breaks through the
fontanel bone area called as the Taloo or

175
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:16,103
the Brahmarandra and connects you to the all-pervading
power of Divine love, which is described in

176
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:21,429
the Bible also as the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost also in the Koran as Ruh and also in

177
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:23,859
the Indian scriptures as Paramchaitanya.

178
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:26,576
Patanjali has called it as Ritambhara Pragya.

179
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:31,185
Whatever the name, this is a power which is
all-pervading, which does all the subtle works

180
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:34,262
of living process, of evolutionary process.

181
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:39,110
The existence of this all-pervading energy
is not felt before Realization, but after

182
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,000
Self Realization you can feel it on your fingertips

183
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,159
or at the center of your palm or above the fontanel bone area.

184
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,428
Moreover, this process has to be spontaneous,
Sahaja.

185
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,954
Saha means with and ja means born.

186
00:15:51,954 --> 00:15:56,323
That means the right to get this union with
the all-pervading power of Divine love is

187
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,323
the birthright of every human being.

188
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:00,323
Our mental energies are limited.

189
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:06,319
Our limited mental energy, which is linear
in movement and has no sustenance of reality,

190
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,252
reaches a point and stops.

191
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:16,732
From there it boomerangs and all mental, linear
movement comes back to us as a punishment sometimes.

192
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:22,872
So now we need more energy, higher energy,
deeper energy and for that this happening

193
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:25,853
has to take place if we don’t want to have
another war.

194
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:33,620
I must say that in the West, I have met many
people who are true seekers of Truth and are

195
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,175
fed up of artificiality of the Western life.

196
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:43,124
Also they didn’t know what they were seeking
sometimes and they have made lots of mistakes.

197
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:48,139
They have gone to false gurus who have taken
lots of money and the people have become bankrupts

198
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:50,139
and mentally and physically handicapped.

199
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:58,337
The one thing you must note that the awakening
of the Kundalini and thus achieving Self-Realization

200
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:02,682
is a living process of evolution for which
we cannot pay anything.

201
00:17:02,682 --> 00:17:05,809
It is like putting a seed in the Mother Earth.

202
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:09,652
It sprouts because Mother Earth has the power
to sprout it.

203
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:20,991
Which shows – in the same way we have this
germinating power in the triangular bone which

204
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:24,484
Greeks called as Sacrum which is a three and
a half coiled energy

205
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:31,482
which shows that the Greeks knew that this was a sacred bone and hence they gave the same name, Sacrum.

206
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:37,007
Actually in some people you can see this triangular
bone pulsating and the Kundalini very slowly

207
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:40,435
rising, but there are many who have got Self
Realization.

208
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:45,106
Now this Sahaja Yoga is working in 85 nations,

209
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:49,153
and they have all become extremely peaceful

210
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,280
with each other.

211
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:58,073
In their hearts, they’re integrated and
they have become extremely loving and compassionate.

212
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:01,141
I’m sorry I can’t tell you more, but the
time is over.

213
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:02,514
I hope you don’t mind.

214
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:07,202
Thank you very much.
