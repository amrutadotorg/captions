00:00:03.126 --> 00:00:06.674
while there are priests who give baptism too.

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:13.122
This baptism and that baptism is in juxtaposition.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:19.330
In the same way when Kundalini rises,

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:22.092
Kriya Yog takes place within ourselves.

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:24.891
Something goes into kriya, into action.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.518
The action is that when Kundalini rises, it’s a tremendous

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.174
force that is rising

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.572
and it’s a very unique happening,

00:00:37.807 --> 00:00:40.789
and the whole body is prepared for that.

00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:47.104
And when it rises, a kind of a wave

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:51.014
of action takes place in the body. Like peristaltic movement

00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:53.745
we have when we digest our food, in the same way,

00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:58.575
when Kundalini rises a some sort of

00:00:58.773 --> 00:01:01.455
a muscular contraction takes place

00:01:01.908 --> 00:01:05.291
which keeps the risen Kundalini upward,

00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:08.797
and then it dilates, it opens out and then it contracts.

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:13.021
All these things take place automatically within ourselves.

00:01:13.124 --> 00:01:16.653
As we start the car, every machinery starts working.

00:01:16.746 --> 00:01:20.046
In the same way the kriya takes place actually within ourselves.

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:23.261
So the kriya takes place within us with Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:23.632 --> 00:01:28.130
All are subsidiary to Sahaja Yoga, means the yoga itself;

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:30.948
but all these things take place inside ourselves.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.718
But on the contrary we can do one thing:

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.340
without starting the car we can start moving the wheel.

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:42.576
That is Kriya Yoga, so-called.

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:47.335
So that is at juxtaposition with the real

00:01:47.584 --> 00:01:50.819
Kriya Yoga which is spontaneous, built-in within us.

00:01:51.018 --> 00:01:53.541
You don’t have to do anything, you are meant for it.

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:57.977
I have seen people, their tongues are cut,

00:01:58.152 --> 00:02:00.104
they are wagging their tongues.

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:03.109
Very old people in India have got this from somebody

00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:04.969
from America, horrible fellow.

00:02:05.223 --> 00:02:08.834
They cut their tongues, and their tongues are wagging like this.

00:02:09.027 --> 00:02:12.186
They are useless people. One doctor was like that, one doctor,

00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:16.625
a seeker –  imagine a seeker being ruined like that.

00:02:17.584 --> 00:02:19.458
I said, “Why? Why did you do that?”

00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:21.598
He said, “We are supposed to do khechari.”

00:02:21.728 --> 00:02:24.664
Khechari is a thing where you cut the tongue, put it back

00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:27.140
and try to touch this back side

00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:30.097
with the tongue tip – can you imagine?

00:02:33.413 --> 00:02:37.770
As it’s called as dawedi raveni pranayams – these are of no use.

00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:43.388
These things have ruined the path of Kundalini.

00:02:43.952 --> 00:02:47.425
I have seen the Kundalini being hurt, wounded.

00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:50.880
She just tosses her head all sides.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.519
This is the ego of man; he thinks, “I can do it,

00:02:54.622 --> 00:02:58.574
and I’ll go to any extent to do it.”  Forget it.

00:02:59.582 --> 00:03:01.320
It’s so simple.

00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:03.745
Just like an enlightened light,

00:03:03.944 --> 00:03:07.158
enlightened candle can enlighten another candle,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.568
it works out that simple ways.

00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:11.322
Don’t do all these things to yourself.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.162
If you are a real seeker, just forget it, don’t ruin yourself.

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:21.839
There’s nothing you did to ruin yourself.

00:03:24.757 --> 00:03:27.201
This is done because they are earnest seekers.

00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:30.685
Their ego is pampered that “You can do it” – they do it.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.502
In Sahaja Yoga, you don’t have to do anything

00:03:34.685 --> 00:03:39.518
till you are realized. Like the people who don’t know how to swim

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.486
are told, “You keep silent. We’ll try to bring you to the shore.”

00:03:44.438 --> 00:03:48.380
So they are brought to the shore, they are taught how to swim,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.198
how to save people, and then they save the people.

00:03:51.608 --> 00:03:53.449
You don’t have to do anything

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:56.108
till you get your real realization, and the mastery over it.

00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:58.410
Unless and until you become the master

00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:01.211
you are not to do anything; you have to become the master first.

00:04:01.236 --> 00:04:04.067
It takes hardly any time to become the master.

00:04:04.762 --> 00:04:08.550
It’s too good to believe, but it is true.

00:04:09.725 --> 00:04:14.825
Everything that is perfect looks like that, isn’t it?

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:21.469
Shall we have the experience now?

00:04:24.024 --> 00:04:26.046
[Inaudible question.]

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:28.170
Yes, now for shoes.

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:31.805
I mean, even there people have an argument with Me, “Why shoes?”

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.417
So I’d better give explanation,  otherwise

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:38.540
again they will stand up and say, “Why shoes?”

00:04:38.575 --> 00:04:40.562
– because shoes, we are so identified with them.

00:04:43.134 --> 00:04:46.220
You see, shoes these days, in modern times especially

00:04:46.267 --> 00:04:50.164
they make, you see,  the soles with not leather but something else,

00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:51.973
and they insulate you.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.806
As it is shoes do insulate you from the Mother Earth,

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:58.348
and to take the help of Mother Earth we have to take out the shoes.

00:04:58.483 --> 00:05:01.394
But even that upsets people, you know – can you imagine?

00:05:01.528 --> 00:05:04.727
But if you ask them to cut their tongues they don’t mind!

00:05:10.346 --> 00:05:12.647
They want it to be absolutely sahaja.

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:14.952
When it is sahaja it has to be extremely sahaja,

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:17.253
that why take out the shoe.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.806
Isn’t it interesting the way we are?

00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:22.964
It is such a play, such a beauty.

00:05:23.118 --> 00:05:24.844
All right, let’s take out our shoes

00:05:24.955 --> 00:05:28.842
and be in cheerful mood. There’s nothing serious going on here.

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:34.876
Just take out your shoes, that’s all.

00:05:41.155 --> 00:05:45.142
Now put your hands towards Me, please, just like this;
