00:03.126 --> 00:06.674
while there are priests who give baptism too.

00:08.294 --> 00:13.122
This baptism and that baptism is in juxtaposition.

00:15.565 --> 00:19.330
In the same way when Kundalini rises,

00:19.521 --> 00:22.092
Kriya Yog takes place within ourselves.

00:22.227 --> 00:24.891
Something goes into kriya, into action.

00:25.320 --> 00:29.518
The action is that when Kundalini rises, it’s a tremendous

00:29.929 --> 00:32.174
force that is rising

00:32.960 --> 00:37.572
and it’s a very unique happening,

00:37.807 --> 00:40.789
and the whole body is prepared for that.

00:41.225 --> 00:47.104
And when it rises, a kind of a wave

00:47.549 --> 00:51.014
of action takes place in the body. Like peristaltic movement

00:51.094 --> 00:53.745
we have when we digest our food, in the same way,

00:54.205 --> 00:58.575
when Kundalini rises a some sort of

00:58.773 --> 01:01.455
a muscular contraction takes place

01:01.908 --> 01:05.291
which keeps the risen Kundalini upward,

01:05.571 --> 01:08.797
and then it dilates, it opens out and then it contracts.

01:09.099 --> 01:13.021
All these things take place automatically within ourselves.

01:13.124 --> 01:16.653
As we start the car, every machinery starts working.

01:16.746 --> 01:20.046
In the same way the kriya takes place actually within ourselves.

01:20.136 --> 01:23.261
So the kriya takes place within us with Sahaja Yoga.

01:23.632 --> 01:28.130
All are subsidiary to Sahaja Yoga, means the yoga itself;

01:28.425 --> 01:30.948
but all these things take place inside ourselves.

01:31.409 --> 01:33.718
But on the contrary we can do one thing:

01:33.869 --> 01:37.340
without starting the car we can start moving the wheel.

01:39.423 --> 01:42.576
That is Kriya Yoga, so-called.

01:43.001 --> 01:47.335
So that is at juxtaposition with the real

01:47.584 --> 01:50.819
Kriya Yoga which is spontaneous, built-in within us.

01:51.018 --> 01:53.541
You don’t have to do anything, you are meant for it.

01:54.514 --> 01:57.977
I have seen people, their tongues are cut,

01:58.152 --> 02:00.104
they are wagging their tongues.

02:00.516 --> 02:03.109
Very old people in India have got this from somebody

02:03.275 --> 02:04.969
from America, horrible fellow.

02:05.223 --> 02:08.834
They cut their tongues, and their tongues are wagging like this.

02:09.027 --> 02:12.186
They are useless people. One doctor was like that, one doctor,

02:12.892 --> 02:16.625
a seeker –  imagine a seeker being ruined like that.

02:17.584 --> 02:19.458
I said, “Why? Why did you do that?”

02:19.641 --> 02:21.598
He said, “We are supposed to do khechari.”

02:21.728 --> 02:24.664
Khechari is a thing where you cut the tongue, put it back

02:24.823 --> 02:27.140
and try to touch this back side

02:27.362 --> 02:30.097
with the tongue tip – can you imagine?

02:33.413 --> 02:37.770
As it’s called as dawedi raveni pranayams – these are of no use.

02:39.531 --> 02:43.388
These things have ruined the path of Kundalini.

02:43.952 --> 02:47.425
I have seen the Kundalini being hurt, wounded.

02:48.032 --> 02:50.880
She just tosses her head all sides.

02:51.690 --> 02:54.519
This is the ego of man; he thinks, “I can do it,

02:54.622 --> 02:58.574
and I’ll go to any extent to do it.”  Forget it.

02:59.582 --> 03:01.320
It’s so simple.

03:01.646 --> 03:03.745
Just like an enlightened light,

03:03.944 --> 03:07.158
enlightened candle can enlighten another candle,

03:07.690 --> 03:09.568
it works out that simple ways.

03:09.727 --> 03:11.322
Don’t do all these things to yourself.

03:11.480 --> 03:16.162
If you are a real seeker, just forget it, don’t ruin yourself.

03:16.345 --> 03:21.839
There’s nothing you did to ruin yourself.

03:24.757 --> 03:27.201
This is done because they are earnest seekers.

03:27.305 --> 03:30.685
Their ego is pampered that “You can do it” – they do it.

03:31.980 --> 03:34.502
In Sahaja Yoga, you don’t have to do anything

03:34.685 --> 03:39.518
till you are realized. Like the people who don’t know how to swim

03:39.709 --> 03:43.486
are told, “You keep silent. We’ll try to bring you to the shore.”

03:44.438 --> 03:48.380
So they are brought to the shore, they are taught how to swim,

03:48.500 --> 03:51.198
how to save people, and then they save the people.

03:51.608 --> 03:53.449
You don’t have to do anything

03:53.516 --> 03:56.108
till you get your real realization, and the mastery over it.

03:56.171 --> 03:58.410
Unless and until you become the master

03:58.647 --> 04:01.211
you are not to do anything; you have to become the master first.

04:01.236 --> 04:04.067
It takes hardly any time to become the master.

04:04.762 --> 04:08.550
It’s too good to believe, but it is true.

04:09.725 --> 04:14.825
Everything that is perfect looks like that, isn’t it?

04:18.334 --> 04:21.469
Shall we have the experience now?

04:24.024 --> 04:26.046
[Inaudible question.]

04:26.245 --> 04:28.170
Yes, now for shoes.

04:28.279 --> 04:31.805
I mean, even there people have an argument with Me, “Why shoes?”

04:32.010 --> 04:36.417
So I’d better give explanation,  otherwise

04:36.643 --> 04:38.540
again they will stand up and say, “Why shoes?”

04:38.575 --> 04:40.562
– because shoes, we are so identified with them.

04:43.134 --> 04:46.220
You see, shoes these days, in modern times especially

04:46.267 --> 04:50.164
they make, you see,  the soles with not leather but something else,

04:50.609 --> 04:51.973
and they insulate you.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.806
As it is shoes do insulate you from the Mother Earth,

04:55.019 --> 04:58.348
and to take the help of Mother Earth we have to take out the shoes.

04:58.483 --> 05:01.394
But even that upsets people, you know – can you imagine?

05:01.528 --> 05:04.727
But if you ask them to cut their tongues they don’t mind!

05:10.346 --> 05:12.647
They want it to be absolutely sahaja.

05:12.766 --> 05:14.952
When it is sahaja it has to be extremely sahaja,

05:15.063 --> 05:17.253
that why take out the shoe.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.806
Isn’t it interesting the way we are?

05:20.925 --> 05:22.964
It is such a play, such a beauty.

05:23.118 --> 05:24.844
All right, let’s take out our shoes

05:24.955 --> 05:28.842
and be in cheerful mood. There’s nothing serious going on here.

05:30.429 --> 05:34.876
Just take out your shoes, that’s all.

05:41.155 --> 05:45.142
Now put your hands towards Me, please, just like this;
