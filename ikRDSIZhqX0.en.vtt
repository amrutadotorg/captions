BIJA MANTRAS AND KUNDALINI

00:13.959 --> 00:22.164
When the Kundalini rises it makes sounds.

00:24.403 --> 00:30.544
And the sounds that are heard
in the different chakras

00:30.745 --> 00:38.555
can be pronounced in the following way -

00:38.756 --> 00:48.075
these pronunciations are being used
in the phonetic language of Devanagari,

00:48.277 --> 00:54.669
which means ‘the language spoken
by the Devas'.

00:57.639 --> 01:00.747
At the Mooladhara,

01:03.267 --> 01:11.172
where there are four petals, the sounds are:

01:11.373 --> 01:20.123
wa, sha, ssha, sa.

01:20.324 --> 01:32.201
Out of which the last, ssha and sa
sounds are very close,

01:32.746 --> 01:40.277
but the difference is - when the snake

01:42.415 --> 01:52.755
hisses it makes this ssha - the third
sound.

01:56.439 --> 02:03.064
So, wa, sha, ssha, sa.

02:07.309 --> 02:13.693
At the Swadishthana, where there are
six petals -

02:20.524 --> 02:30.726
it makes sounds, six sounds:

02:41.403 --> 02:54.244
ba, bha, ma, ya, ra, la.

03:01.493 --> 03:08.947
Manipur - it has ten petals – it makes
the sounds:

03:09.163 --> 03:17.244
da, dha, na, ta, tha,

03:17.445 --> 03:25.781
da, dha, nna, pa, pha.

03:31.227 --> 03:38.124
At Anahata there are twelve petals.
It makes the sounds:

03:38.325 --> 03:47.327
k, kha, ga, gha, nga,

03:47.528 --> 03:55.400
cha, ccha, ja, jha, nnga,

03:55.601 --> 03:59.512
ta, tha.

04:00.058 --> 04:14.376
At the Vishuddhi, where there are
sixteen petals,

04:15.794 --> 04:23.266
it makes the sounds of all the vowels:

04:23.509 --> 04:28.902
a aa - i ii -

04:29.103 --> 04:34.627
u uu - ru ruu -

04:34.828 --> 04:40.189
lru lruu - e aì -

04:40.390 --> 04:46.005
o aù - am ah.

04:56.732 --> 05:03.466
At the Agnya chakra it makes ha, ksha.

05:06.006 --> 05:13.550
At the Sahasrara one becomes thoughtless

05:13.751 --> 05:23.663
and no sound is made, but the pure
Anahata,

05:23.863 --> 05:32.542
meaning the throbbing in the purest form
as in the heart is of:

05:32.743 --> 05:37.441
lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub.

05:41.578 --> 05:49.560
When all these sounds are sounded together

05:49.761 --> 06:01.779
and pass through the spiral of the body,

06:03.057 --> 06:07.235
if the body is like a conch,

06:11.709 --> 06:26.358
the sound that comes out of the synthesis
is OM.

06:30.984 --> 06:35.528
Like the seven colors of the sun

06:35.729 --> 06:43.277
ultimately become white rays,

06:43.478 --> 06:51.236
or you can say the golden colored rays.

06:52.626 --> 06:55.115
Now, the sound of Kundalini

06:55.316 --> 06:59.207
I have told you in one of My lectures,
how it creates sound.

06:59.408 --> 07:06.434
For example at Vishuddhi, it creates
the sound of all the vowels

07:06.899 --> 07:10.693
that are in Sanskrit language. The English
vowels are very few.

07:10.894 --> 07:18.128
Sanskrit language are: a aa – i ii –
u uu – ru ruu – lru lruu –

07:18.362 --> 07:25.930
e aì – o aù – am ah. These are the sounds
at Vishuddhi we can say.

07:26.838 --> 07:31.076
But she creates sounds on all the chakras,

07:31.307 --> 07:38.611
but when she comes to Nabhi it becomes
a vani.

07:38.812 --> 07:46.208
Vani means information, coded information,

07:46.930 --> 07:50.826
that’s the nearest you get, coded
information.

07:51.027 --> 07:54.987
First it is the Paravani, which you don’t
hear.

07:55.188 --> 07:59.793
When it rises from the Kundalini point –
means Mooladhara Chakra

07:59.994 --> 08:06.858
and Mooladhara, then it is not heard –
there’s no sound.

08:07.059 --> 08:12.114
Then it comes to the stomach, the Paravani
starts.

08:14.313 --> 08:21.492
Then it comes into the centre, where, in
the heart, always you hear it – Madhyama -

08:21.692 --> 08:25.700
where you can hear it ‘Lub dub, lub dub,
lub dub’,

08:25.901 --> 08:33.071
just like heart, properly. With
a stethoscope you can hear it.

08:33.793 --> 08:37.831
Then it comes to Vishuddhi. It becomes
a witness,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.627
means ‘Pashyanti’, the One who Sees.

08:42.679 --> 08:45.094
Might have noticed yourself, when you are
caught up in Vishuddhi,

08:45.295 --> 08:51.567
you feel the thing going on here. But here
She sees.

08:52.471 --> 08:58.980
Then this sound, which is the sound with
which you speak,

09:00.173 --> 09:06.418
when it comes to the throat, it becomes
Vaikhari, is saying.

09:06.619 --> 09:09.021
This is even before the Kundalini’s there,

09:09.222 --> 09:14.545
the Vani, the coded information,
the language, which is first only coded,

09:14.745 --> 09:18.644
becomes decoded here, she it called
Vaikhari, which talks.

09:18.845 --> 09:23.737
But after realization, the Kundalini
enlightens the vani,

09:23.938 --> 09:26.692
as it enlightens everything else.

09:26.893 --> 09:34.216
Because of that enlightenment, your mantras
become enlightened.

09:34.473 --> 09:43.246
And that’s how, when you say a mantra,
it is effective, it’s lighted.

09:43.447 --> 09:46.429
Before this, any mantra said has no
meaning,

09:46.664 --> 09:52.039
it’s just ordinary Vani, just like in any
ordinary person.

09:52.240 --> 09:57.782
So, it is called as the mantra which is
‘Jagrut’, awakened.

09:57.983 --> 10:02.438
So, a mantra which is Jagrut cannot be
created out of a mantra

10:02.639 --> 10:05.870
which is not enlightened.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.997
Like if you have, say, an earthen pot
or an earthen thing like this,

10:13.198 --> 10:19.760
or this one as it is, and you have all
the oil and everything there:

10:19.961 --> 10:24.699
still it won’t give light till it is
enlightened.

10:24.900 --> 10:29.985
In the same way, the mantra is nothing,
it’s just a dead pot.

10:30.186 --> 10:36.399
Unless and until it is enlightened by
Kundalini, it is from ordinary vani,

10:36.600 --> 10:38.617
which cannot give you enlightenment,

10:38.818 --> 10:41.101
and which cannot give enlightenment
to the mantras,

10:41.302 --> 10:46.156
and that’s why these mantras have
no meaning at all.

10:46.357 --> 10:50.625
A person whose Spirit is enlightened,

10:50.826 --> 10:57.016
and his vani is enlightened,

10:57.217 --> 11:05.526
such a person, whatever he says comes true.
Whatever he asks for happens.

11:05.727 --> 11:10.874
Even before he says something, the desire,

11:11.075 --> 11:18.170
the desire within us, which is the Paravani,
which is the coded information

11:18.371 --> 11:23.065
of the desire you have, becomes enlightened,
and that’s how you get the results.

11:23.266 --> 11:27.180
Suddenly you get something, you said:
‘Oh, I have struck the jackpot,

11:27.381 --> 11:33.100
and Mother has done it’. That’s how it
works out.

11:33.300 --> 11:37.522
The whole system works out this way,
of Kundalini.

11:37.723 --> 11:42.711
So this pure Kundalini creates purity
within us.

11:42.912 --> 11:46.446
Without the purity we cannot see anything.
Anything that is impure -

11:46.647 --> 11:52.905
say, say my hands are not clean, I can’t
see the light.

11:53.106 --> 11:56.139
Anything that is dirtied, you cannot see
the real picture of it,

11:56.324 --> 12:00.773
you cannot see the reality if it is not
been purified.

12:00.974 --> 12:05.692
But, even if it is superficially purified
or artificially painted,

12:05.893 --> 12:09.855
still, you can always say that it is
artificially painted,

12:10.056 --> 12:15.078
and you cannot see the beauty of this one,
because this is done from outside.

12:15.279 --> 12:23.533
But this Kundalini burns off everything -
bhasmasat - makes everything into ashes,

12:24.226 --> 12:29.443
and whatever remains is the pure gold
of the Spirit within us.
