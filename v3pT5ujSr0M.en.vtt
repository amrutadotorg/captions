00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.892
..there are some new people. Those who are new, for the first time who have come,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.892
can come forward would be a better idea. Kerry, you can come here with them. Anna,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.892
you can give the place. Better thing is those who are new should be first.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.892
Yes would be a good idea. Please, sit down.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.892
How are you keeping Kerry? You are fine?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.892
It is most amazing that the attention of the West was attracted towards Kundalini

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:48.892
through something that is absolutely against Kundalini, which is called as ‘Tantrism’.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.892
I would say Annie Besant, the first who founded this Theosophical Society in India,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.892
was one of the first ladies who wrote about Kundalini and the Chakras and all that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.892
She was not a Tantrika herself, but in a way she was

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.892
because Kundalini awakening is a spontaneous happening, It’s spontaneous.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.892
If you can understand a living process of a seed that sprouts by itself.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.892
You cannot do it by your intellect, by any effort. It’s a living process.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.892
In the same way, awakening of the Kundalini is a living process.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.892
It’s an evolutionary process, the culminating process, but it is a living process.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.892
And that’s why it cannot be achieved by our thinking, nor through our effort.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.892
This is the basis of Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.892
Sahaja – ‘Saha’ means with, ‘Ja’ means born. It is born within you, it is your right.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.892
You are born with it. As we can say, if you buy this from the market,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.892
we know it has a cord with it, to be put to the mains.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.892
In the same way, you have your cord within you, there.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.892
And the whole machinery is built within you.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.892
During your evolutionary process from say from amoeba or say it is from carbon only,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.892
or even earlier, whatever has happened, in creating a human being

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.892
has been placed there as milestones in your being.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.892
These are the seven stages through which man has evolved.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.892
The last stage is only that this Kundalini, this residual force that is settled down there,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.892
has to rise, and is to be connected to the All-pervading Power.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.892
Unless and until this happens, you cannot be convinced about any power

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.892
which resides beyond your intellect. You cannot be.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.892
I mean, it’s only talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.892
That’s why no religion could convince you so far. That doesn’t mean religion has no sense.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.892
No Incarnation, even that of Christ, could convince you mentally what is God,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.892
what is Christ, and what was His message.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.892
What was a rebirth. It was just talk, talk, talk, talk, up to this point.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:02.892
So, I mean, I don’t blame human beings for that. The human mind started thinking about it.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.892
These people, they talk of a rebirth, something of the beyond.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.892
And how is it we have not detected it through science?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.892
How is it we cannot feel it?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.892
How is it we cannot understand it?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.892
How is it related to our awareness?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.892
Absolutely correct. And these doubts are correct, no doubt.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.892
But still a feeling was there, a feeling down there in your heart,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.892
that there’s something beyond, also. Even in the realm of science,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.892
you have discovered many things which cannot be answered through your intellect.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.892
It cannot be answered. I mean, I would say that science has revealed very little that is reality.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.892
When you will jump into this new awareness,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.892
you’ll realise that so far you have not known anything whatsoever about reality.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.892
It’s surprising. It’s all outside you have known, but nothing in the subtle form.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:27.892
You were prepared gradually, carefully. To be yourself, to know yourself,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.892
to be one with that all-pervading power which resides in yourself,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.892
in your heart, that is kept away from you, that is watching you.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.892
You know there is somebody who is watching you.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.892
It is recording everything that you are doing.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.892
Even if you are absolutely lonely, you know there is someone with you

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.892
who knows about you, everything.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.892
But you don’t know what it is.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.892
With your intellect you cannot reach there.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.892
With your efforts you cannot. Whether it is religious, prayers, or anything, you cannot reach there.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.892
It’s a fact; one has to accept. It’s a fact.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.892
Once I accept it,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.892
then I also would like you to accept Me,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.892
that you can know everything and you can connect everything,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.892
you can explain everything, if you enter inside your own being.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.892
Like I talk to you about this room, anything,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.892
it’s nothing to you because you have not seen it,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.892
you have not faced it.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.892
But when you come inside and I put on the lights and you see this place,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.892
then you say, “Oh, we never knew it was so!”

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.892
So, it should happen, it must happen, if it is so:

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.892
if there is some sense that we are created so carefully,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.892
if there is some sense [of] what so far being told that we are to be reborn,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.892
if there is any sense in all these incarnations like Christ and others,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.892
if there is any sense in saying that there is God Almighty. It must prove Itself,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.892
It has to. The time has to come.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.892
Otherwise nobody is going to believe and they are not going to have the fulfilment

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.892
of their being unless and until they know why they are on this Earth.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.892
And that is the job of God, not yourself. If He has created you,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.892
if He has created this universe, if He exists really, then He has to do it.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.892
He has created you. You cannot even create one living thing.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.892
You cannot transform one flower into a fruit.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.892
You have to have something living to make it something,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.892
manifest it into something living. Like test tube babies now you have.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.892
You have to have a living thing. You cannot create out of dead.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.892
But a seed, which looks dead to us,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.892
starts germinating in the soil.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.892
We take it for granted, you see. A small little seed creates a huge big banyan tree.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.892
One little, it’s such a small tiny one. We take it for granted.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.892
It’s a miracle.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.892
And how the season changes and how they blossom and how, gradually,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.892
the flowers get transformed into fruit. You never see that.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.892
You never see the transformation. It is such a slow moving picture.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:23.892
You just cannot see it! It’s so beautifully done.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.892
So this introduction to the West about Kundalini came through wrong people, no doubt,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.892
as if the knowledge of the bank comes to us through the thugs

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.892
when we see the bank robbery picture.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.892
It’s something like that.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.892
And these thugs were the Tantrikas

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:58.892
who tried to use the power of these chakras,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.892
these centres, that they saw within themselves.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.892
Because these are the two channels on both sides, left and right,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.892
which give rise to our sympathetic nervous system,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:26.892
and the central channel is the one that gives rise to our parasympathetic.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.892
These are in subtle form inside the spinal cord.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.892
And the sympathetic that we see outside is in the gross form.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.892
Now these chakras are placed within us

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.892
and these people, who have tried to enter into these areas,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.892
have seen them and they wrote about it.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.892
But this was not the way they should have gone.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.892
This is a wrong way, this is sympathetic.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.892
Actually by going like this they are thrown on this side or that side,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.892
to the left or to the right.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.892
And the Left side that is within us manifests our emotional being, our subconscious being.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.892
The Right side that is within us manifests our creative being.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.892
You can say it can be divided in two halves.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.892
The lower portion of the left side is the matter,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.892
material subconscious you can say,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.892
and the higher is the emotional subconscious.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.892
Here it is again, the physical creativity and here it is the mental creativity.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.892
So the thinking starts when man reaches this stage.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.892
And he starts thinking about everything.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.892
Mostly he diverts his attention to thinking,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.892
he uses his intelligence, and he starts thinking about it;

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:23.892
a sort of a game which acts and reacts. He thinks.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.892
Thoughts after thoughts come into him.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.892
He comes to a point where he stops,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.892
and that point is again invaded by thoughts.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.892
Then he selects a thought, he goes on to one thought.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.892
Again there is that point, there are many thoughts,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.892
he goes from thoughts to thoughts.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.892
The movement of thoughts is like moving on a wave.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.892
On the cusp then comes down, again rises, again falls down.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.892
We can say that we can see the rising of the thought,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.892
but we do not see the finishing of the thought.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.892
By the time it is about to finish, we jump on to another thought.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.892
But with a little training, people develop,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.892
they can have consistent thinking, they think so,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.892
and go on riding from thoughts to thoughts to thoughts to thoughts to thoughts.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.892
But then they develop horns of thoughts.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.892
And the thoughts go on pulling this side, that side, they cannot remain without thoughts.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.892
Because, when you start first thinking,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.892
as a by product of this machinery on the right hand side, your ego develops.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.892
Your superego is already developed in previous lives or

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.892
even in this life on your emotional side,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.892
and your ego develops this yellow stuff here, here.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.892
And it becomes swollen like a yellow big balloon.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.892
It goes on pressing on the superego that side.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.892
It goes on pressing very hard, till the thoughts become too much,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.892
then you think: oh, you must do something to relax.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.892
So you have here also some shops where you relax,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.892
come along, relax, relax, relax! Another suggestion comes! They try to relax. T

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.892
he basic problem they do not see.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.892
The basic problem is that you are lost

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.892
between your ego and superego just like this!

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.892
If you try to relax your ego, say, if you take to drinks,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.892
you take some alcohol or something, then you can go into your superego.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.892
The superego pushes the ego down,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.892
then a big battle starts, ego, superego, go on fighting.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.892
We have seen a reaction, mass scale, among the western people,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:58.892
when we take to, we call, the hippyism.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.892
It is nothing but the ego oriented society suddenly jumped into superego.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.892
So you take to drugs, you give up everything. I mean, it’s all outside!

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.892
They think they are giving up everything. They do not!

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.892
And then you just resign yourself and call it love and indulge into sex

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.892
and things and mass sex and all that: all left hand activities.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.892
By that you think you have achieved the goal,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.892
you have not. You have only changed your areas from one to another:

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:41.892
from ego to superego and superego to ego, the jumping is on.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.892
Now, this battle between ego and superego

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.892
is very nicely looked after by your intelligence!

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.892
Books flooded in the market.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.892
You read this book, you read that book, you read another book.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.892
The thinking process starts because you start identifying with the book.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.892
What does it take to write a book in this world?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.892
You just go in the market, publish a book and you get it.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.892
The problem is like this,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.892
when you read a book you do not realise

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.892
that you are giving another thought process to your mind.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.892
Already you have read too much,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.892
and then you are reading more,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.892
adding more to your thought and thought and thought,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.892
and there are clusters of thoughts in your mind.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.892
I mean, there is no freedom left for you to think for yourself at all.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.892
You are nowhere, you are lost. You are lost in your books,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.892
you are lost on what you have read from others.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.892
You have no originality left in you at all because you are not yourself.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.892
On intelligence also, I would say.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.892
Because then intelligence starts cheating you.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.892
That’s the worst part of intelligence is that it cheats you.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.892
And you do not realise it. No one realises it.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.892
I have seen some, even analysts, what we call, I must say (laughing).

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.892
Rustom knows that! I was amazed that they are living with cheating themselves.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.892
They do not know they are cheating. You see,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.892
they are playing games with themselves, poor things. I was thinking of what is going to happen?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.892
Where is reality? And what are you doing?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.892
I mean, it is no question of condemnation at all.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.892
It’s a question that when you are away from reality, there is no joy in your life.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.892
Joy is in reality, in knowing it, in accepting it, in being one with it. That’s the point.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.892
The point is not of condemnation, or of saying anything wrong with it.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.892
But it is that you are kept away from what you are!

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.892
Say, you have a lots of money in the bank –

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.892
we’ll take money [as an example] because people understand money –

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.892
and you cannot reach it. Neither you are near it.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.892
And here you are starving and you are absolutely a pauper.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.892
Then a person like Me has to say, Why are you taking more beggary,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.892
and more beggary, and more beggary? You have lots of property within you.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.892
You have lots of sustaining power within you.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.892
Why don’t you go there and see for yourself, and then only you find,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.892
“Oh, God! What we have  been doing all through was really good for nothing!”

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.892
But it should happen to you. It’s no question of lecturing.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.892
I cannot give you a brainwash that you just believe in Me,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.892
[that] what I say is the truth. Nothing of the kind.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.892
It has to happen to you. If it does not happen, I cannot convince you.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.892
It’s no question of brainwashing you that, “Now everything will be all right!

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.892
You must seek within yourself.” Or giving you a certificate. No,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.892
you’ve got it now. I cannot do it.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.892
It’s a reality which is to be felt by you, to be understood by you,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.892
and then to know all it’s working, how it works and how it moves.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.892
And you are amazed, “Oh God, we did not know there’s such a mechanism working!”

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.892
So to put it in a scientific manner is this way:

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.892
that I put a hypothesis before you.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.892
Take it as a hypothesis, all right?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.892
Then you take it as a hypothesis, keep an open mind like a scientist does.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.892
Do not accept Me at all, because you have your fruitful ideas.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.892
For example, somebody comes with an idea, he has read something about mandala,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.892
and I am laughing at Myself, I say, “Now what is this rumble tumble he’s talking about?”

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.892
Because I know something else.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.892
Now he comes and tells Me, “Oh, I have read in such and such book!” Now I keep quiet.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.892
So do not quote any book to Me.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.892
By reading any book you have not achieved anything,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.892
by doing anything you have not achieved anything, you have not found your peace,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.892
you have not found your joy, you have not found the reality. All right?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.892
So My hypothesis is like this, that, I work on you.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.892
No miracles, no brainwashing, nothing,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.892
but just like a gardener pours water on the seed to sprout,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.892
is My love, which you cannot see; which is working out,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.892
which is working; which will work out.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.892
Which will work out this rising of this Kundalini,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.892
which is the primule within you, which rises,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.892
rises higher and higher and breaks at that point

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.892
where you become one with that subtle force which is all pervading.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.892
But one has to feel it.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.892
But the Western mind does not know about these things, first of all. They are naive.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.892
Whatever they have known, at the most I can say,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.892
like Jung, I would say, was a man who saw something of it,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.892
didn’t he, of collective consciousness. Something of it, I would say.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.892
And how many accepted him? It’s a problem.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.892
They thought he was talking something absurd.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.892
He was talking about God and vague and all those things they said.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.892
But here you are going to feel it yourself.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.892
You are going to experience it, and you are going to manoeuvre it.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.892
And you are going to be the master of that art, not Me,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.892
because I know it.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.892
And all the secrets about it I am going to tell you.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:10.892
At this point you enter into a new area where it’s not scientific, in the sense

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.892
that you don’t even have those eyes to see that.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.892
It would be something like, when you are blind, I have to explain to you about a colour.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.892
But supposing you get that awareness within you,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.892
supposing that happens to you, then things are all right.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.892
So, what is the contract?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.892
The contract is that it should happen to you

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.892
and then you should see for yourself.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.892
Because it is a very subtle happening, it does happen,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.892
it happens, no doubt about it.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.892
It cannot happen by all the circus people put on it.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.892
Like you see, I move like a serious person here, or I give you a big sermon like that.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.892
It’s not going to work out that way.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.892
It doesn’t even happen if I say that, all right, you pay me $275 at every initiation.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.892
All this is nonsense!

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.892
It is much beyond all these things!

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.892
It’s a very subtle, divine stuff.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.892
You cannot control it. You cannot purchase Me,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.892
nor can you purchase your Realisation.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.892
It is beyond money. It controls all that is money.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.892
It controls all that is materialism.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.892
It controls all that is human being.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.892
It coordinates, organises, and looks after us.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.892
It has been looking after us, but we do not know.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.892
It is that power which has been. You see, raising us

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.892
from the stage of amoeba to this stage, who made you a human being?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.892
How did we lose our tails?

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.892
We could have been monkeys today, or could have been just amoebas crawling,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:12.892
or may not have been even amoebas, could have been just some carbon atoms pulsating,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.892
could be something like that. But we are human beings.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.892
And in this short time, a very, very short time,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.892
from the time this Earth seceded from the Sun that we have become human beings.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.892
Nobody can explain how in this little time we have done it.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.892
No law of chance can explain it.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.892
How did you become human beings? Somebody has done it.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.892
All right, don’t believe it: somebody has not done it.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.892
All right, you have done by chance anything.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.892
By chance you may at also get this thing. Let us keep it like that!

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.892
Because intellect is very clever.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.892
All the time I can see the intellect working everywhere, you see, I see it very clearly.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.892
And some of them are so funny that they take up a line and they go on the same way. Even

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.892
if I am talking they will not listen.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.892
So I’m saying talking is not the point. It has to happen to you,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.892
the rising of the Kundalini from here, upward there.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.892
Now, it happens. It has happened to all the rest who are sitting at the back,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.892
and we have many more, we have thousands in India.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.892
They look like very normal people,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.892
look healthy, of course, look blossoming, they are beautiful,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.892
very beautiful people.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:44.892
But how are we to believe that they are realised, that they have got this in them?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.892
Now, I would say Kareem is a born realised.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.892
He’s born as a realised soul.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.892
How can you make it out?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.892
We had many who were born realised. There’s one, another one sitting there.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.892
They themselves did not know they were born realised.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.892
How can you make it out? Because you haven’t got that awareness to feel.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.892
Even what Jung said, whether Jung was a realised soul or not,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.892
how will you make it out?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.892
What was Freud? How will you make it out? Through your intellect.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:26.892
You cannot judge them because they are so deep

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.892
that you cannot find out what is their situation inside,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.892
what was the matter with him inside,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.892
what chakras were controlled,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.892
what were the chakras which were blocked,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.892
what were working, why he said it. You cannot see this.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.892
All this is due to these centres within us.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.892
And the deities between there makes a difference.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.892
Wherever are the deities are awakened, you are awakened to that point.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.892
Wherever they are not awakened, you are not awakened.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.892
Up to the centres, maybe they be like me, the scientists.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.892
Because maybe, because you can see the pulsation of the Kundalini, I can show you.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.892
I can show you the pulsation of these with the stethoscope.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.892
But they may not accept the deity part.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.892
They’ll say, “how do you see that there are deities?”

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.892
Of course, we see the pulsation. Now rising in there. I accept.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.892
We accept also that through Sahaja, the Kundalini’s rising,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.892
we feel thoughtless and all that; but how do you say there are deities?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.892
How do you say there is God?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.892
What is the proof that there are deities sitting down here?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.892
That proof also you can see for yourself.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.892
That is also to be proved.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.892
The whole thing is really fantastically miraculous, believe Me!

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.892
And it is so miraculous that people cannot believe it.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.892
This is the beauty of the intellect.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.892
This is how the intellect cheats us,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.892
that it does not allow us to believe that is the Truth,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:23.892
and that is the reality. Because it cannot trust itself anymore.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.892
It’s a joke, but it’s a fact, I tell you, it is so.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.892
I mean, sometimes we do not trust ourselves with our intellectual capacities.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.892
You think, really, is it true, or am I thinking like that, or am I that, or this, or that.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.892
And with all the kinds of suggestions people have given you,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.892
that you are guilty, you have done this.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.892
If not you, your forefathers have done this.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.892
If not your forefathers, then your uncles have done this,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.892
you are guilty about it. So you say, “This must be, I am very guilty.” Now,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.892
somebody says something. We take it for granted, yes, we suffer from all these troubles.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.892
Neither you are suffering from any trouble, nor there is anything existing.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.892
This is all your cerebral activity, which has brought about this aura in you,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.892
this kind of a funny aura, which doesn’t exist.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.892
That is a myth. She’s already in the, she’s got it, I think, Realisation!

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.892
That makes you laugh. You cannot laugh so much as our Chendol [who] has not come today.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.892
Chendol is an artist, he’s not come.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.892
He’s an artist and when he got his Realisation, he couldn’t control his laughter.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.892
He went outside and laughed aloud. He said, Mother,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.892
can I go out because it’s so enjoyable, you know, the whole thing is, the joke is over.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:48.892
When the joke is over, you see for yourself. He’s just, he’s making giggling. (Laughing)

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.892
The joke, when it is over, you see, like we are watching Napoleon on his horse, you see,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.892
and we identify ourselves with Mr. Napoleon, you see, great Napoleon we are.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.892
In France, hello, if you call somebody Napoleon,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.892
he will take really a big objection to that.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.892
I mean, if you say that you are like Napoleon, he’ll say, “

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.892
Oh really, I must be doomed personality.”

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.892
But we see Napoleon and we think we are Napoleon sitting on a horse

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.892
and conquering this and conquering that and this and that.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.892
And suddenly the whole show is over and we say,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.892
“Oh, that was Napoleon. We are what we are!” That’s what happens.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.892
And when it happens, the whole joke is over and you realise that,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.892
“Oh God, what have I been worried about?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.892
What’s all this going on?”

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.892
And you become a very different, relaxed personality

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.892
and you just start enjoying the way she’s enjoying now the joke,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.892
and it happens, and it happens with many, and should happen with you.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.892
Now there is a question coming in somebody’s mind that,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.892
“How is it it has never happened before?”

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.892
A common intellectual question, you know, all these things will come. Intellect, you know,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.892
how it cheats you, I’ll tell you. Now such a question comes here. Why?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.892
See, why the intellect is cheating you. Supposing I say there is a diamond available here,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.892
free to you. “Come along. Have it!”

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.892
Will you think twice? Even if you are in Australia,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.892
I am sure you’ll run by the first plane and come down to take that.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.892
But when I say there’s reality available here, you don’t have to pay for it,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.892
you cannot pay for it. It will happen to you. Then why do you question it?

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.892
Because this is the intellect, you see, which is cheating us all the time and saying it.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.892
It is saying that, “Is it? Is it available?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.892
How can that be?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.892
Why it did not happen before?

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.892
We have read that it is very difficult. It should be a very difficult thing.”

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.892
So for that I explain that it was difficult.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.892
When you see a little plant you don’t see any flowers on it.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.892
When it grows a little more then you see a few flowers

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.892
but when it is in blossom time a full, full fledged tree.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.892
So the intellect, you see, it cheats us. Every moment it tries.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.892
to divert our attention from reality. That’s the beauty of intellect is.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.892
We have reached our, I mean, we have allowed the intellect to so much ride us

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.892
that it is cheating us all the time and we are running like mad after it.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.892
This blossom time has come and in the blossom time there are so many fruits

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.892
which have to be ripened and matured.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.892
They have to be themselves. Is a simple process of growth.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.892
And so whatever was yesterday may not be today.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:26.892
The history always shows that whatever was yesterday becomes fruitful in later periods or today

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.892
we can say like this light, this was not like before,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.892
we had another kinds of lights

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.892
and when electricity was developed still this was not there.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.892
Gradually it was made into a proper channel and brought in, and then now we have this.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.892
So do we believe that, “How can this be here when we had candle light?”

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.892
See the cheating of the brain! This is one.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.892
And all this cheating of the brain goes on very much,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.892
especially in the West, I am sorry.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.892
Because in the East, you see, people have not yet started that fast,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.892
rat race which is here; competitive life,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.892
where you have to think and think and think

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.892
how to out beat another person in thinking.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.892
Because of this the mind has become such a speedy thing

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:37.892
that you cannot stop your thinking and you cannot even for a second be there

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.892
where you are not thinking.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.892
Either you are to be possessed by some guru who comes here to take your money,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.892
or to take your women;

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.892
or maybe that you are to be blasted off through some sort of a shocking treatment.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.892
Otherwise your thinking cannot stop.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.892
But what happens really is when you get Realisation,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.892
[the] first thing that will happen, as soon as the Kundalini rises over this chakra of Agnya –

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.892
which is presided by the deity of Christ –

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.892
immediately your thinking stops

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.892
and you become thoughtlessly aware. Many of you have already. You all, most of you have.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.892
Just now you are not thinking, blank.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.892
It’s not auto suggestion or anything, you see for yourself.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.892
And then when it pierces through this, you start feeling a cool breeze coming to you,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.892
a kind of a cool breeze.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.892
Now you may say that, what is this cool breeze Mataji is talking about?

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.892
The trouble is, you see, we read about Kundalini through somebody known as Mr. Avon.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.892
I don’t know if he had any spiritual experience. After reading his book,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.892
I have reached a conclusion that most of them are rumble tumble fellows, I call them.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.892
They have not known what is Kundalini, they do not know anything about it, take it from me.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.892
They have just read some books,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.892
published such big, big books in English language and finished,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.892
they are great authors of Kundalini.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.892
It would be something [like] who has never been, never been to the Himalayas.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.892
has never seen a glimpse of Himalayas and is writing books after books [about]

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.892
how he climbed Himalayas, how he went there, and how he planted the flag.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.892
It’s absolutely that falsehood, I can tell you this much,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.892
which you can realise yourself. You can see for yourself it is so.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.892
So, by reading these books and by understanding them,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.892
what one gets is some sort of a funny knowledge,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.892
which I don’t know what must be happening to people because,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.892
I cannot understand, you know, because this kind of a knowledge,

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.892
which is absolutely nonsense, if you read.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.892
And then you have that game here of bluff, you know,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.892
what you call that bluff master game.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.892
Something like that it is. It is a complete bluff.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.892
And when you see that in reality it doesn’t exist that way,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.892
then you start thinking, how is it? These big people.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.892
You never read. In this country I have seen. You never read the authentic, real books

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.892
that were written about the Kundalini.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.892
The authentic book was written by Adi Shankaracharya. Nobody reads.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.892
I’ve not met one person who has read, before meeting Me, Adi Shankaracharya.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.892
Surprisingly. He is the author. He is the main person who has done it.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.892
Others are all just saying something here and something there like that. He is the one.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.892
Nobody has read him at all who has described in complete details about Kundalini,

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.892
about how it works, how it rises and then about these vibrations.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.892
Same about the Bible. I don’t know how you read it

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.892
or you, you pay the clergy to read for you perhaps, in the church.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.892
Perhaps that may be the style it is.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.892
That it is written that the wind has to come from the Holy Ghost,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.892
is the sign of the Holy Ghost: wind, a cool breeze.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.892
It is time for us to prove it, if it is so or not.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.892
But…(sounds like a break in the recording) …then how can you believe in Christ?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.892
But I would say that, even if you don’t believe in it, it will work out,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.892
because it is like sunshine.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.892
Even if you don’t believe in God, you are quite breathing all right,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.892
you are quite in one piece, nothing is gone wrong, nobody is put asunder.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.892
One should be blasted.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.892
But, no, because he’s so compassionate, so compassionate.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.892
He has not blasted you.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.892
He’s not done anything like that to you,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.892
but He wants that you should know Him through your freedom.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.892
Then you may ask me one last question, then, Mother, why there is intelligence?

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.892
If this is such a donkey, then why God has given us intelligence?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.892
Intelligence, pure intelligence, is very good.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.892
Pure intelligence teaches you that you cannot reach that realm of unlimited area

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.892
through your intelligence, because intelligence is limited.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.892
That is pure intelligence: to understand, that no,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.892
this intelligence cannot take us there, which is a limited thing.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.892
As you cannot bring an aeroplane inside this room;

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.892
you have to give up the aeroplane outside, or your car outside.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.892
This once realised, you have awakened yourself

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.892
into that pure intelligence of understanding.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.892
And pure intelligence also helps you after Realisation,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.892
because then you start understanding what is flowing through you,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.892
what is happening, how the vibrations are flowing,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.892
how you have to move your hands to give vibrations,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.892
how you raise the Kundalini of others,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.892
and you can then very easily cure people,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.892
as now here some people have cured – mentally, emotionally, physically,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.892
in every way you can cure people, you can get cured yourself,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.892
and you can give that tranquility and peace and joyt

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.892
that is within you – they will also enjoy.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.892
You get into the collective consciousness, in which you start feeling others. Now,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.892
for example, you all have come for the first time,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.892
but these all know where is your Kundalini now.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.892
Where are you standing.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.892
As soon as you get it, you will know. This little boy knows, leave alone [others].

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.892
There’s a little grandchild I have. She’s a born-realised. She knows. She knows.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.892
If you have that awareness, you know that: this is this and this is this;

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.892
because you can feel it on your fingers, actually subjective.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.892
It is a subjective knowledge. You can feel it, the heat and everything on your fingers.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.892
And the fingers have different chakras.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.892
And you can feel the chakras on your fingers, on your palm,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.892
and you can see the heat and the cold,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.892
for which you don’t have to go to any school.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.892
Any uneducated person can also know.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.892
An educated person can also know that, Mother, this is catching.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.892
Now you put ten children, cover their eyes and ask them about, this gentleman –

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.892
give us what is the report. Immediately all of them will raise their finger, this [index finger].

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.892
You ask the person, are you suffering from cold, have you got throat trouble, he said, “Yes.”

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.892
And then you cure him also.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.892
Because once this power of parasympathetic – which is autonomous nervous system,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.892
we cannot control it – starts flowing through your central nervous system

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.892
because of this happening of the central rising of this Kundalini,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.892
then you start feeling it and you can feel others

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.892
because we are all bound by one single thread,

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.892
which is just to be threaded together.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.892
And once you are threaded and your attention is on that thread that is within you,

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.892
then you start feeling by moving on that thread,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.892
which passes through everybody else.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.892
It’s a very simple thing, like a necklace.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.892
You are different pearls and there’s one thread passing through.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.892
Now your attention is outside.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.892
If I say put your attention inside, you cannot do it.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.892
But then your attention goes inside. You start feeling your chakras.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.892
You start seeing yourself. You start seeing within yourself.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.892
Then there is no need to give you any lecture or anything. You yourself will come and say,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.892
“Mother, I’m catching on my heart chakra.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.892
” Means “I am afraid. I have a sense of insecurity.” You’ll just come and say that.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.892
But you need not say all those things. You just say, “I’m catching on my heart chakra,”

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.892
and it works out. And I’ll tell you how to cure it.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.892
Now we have people like him, we can say Ronnie is one of them who had a very bad heart chakra.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.892
Then he had on the heart because he was doing Hatha Yoga.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.892
We had all kinds of people here who have got it, who have felt it, and it is there.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.892
So through reasoning you cannot get it. It has to work out, and it works out.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.892
Now, you might say, you see, some people have very funny, funny objections, I tell you.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.892
They are so funny that I can’t understand.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.892
They can see in the ballet dancing, a nude woman dancing, they have no objection, you see.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.892
But if they see a Sahaja Yogi giving Kundalini rising, they said,

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.892
“Why did he raise your hand?” I mean, just imagine!

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.892
The thing is flowing from your hand and you have to raise it

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.892
because unless and until you raise your hand

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.892
you cannot raise the Kundalini of a person, that’s the point.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.892
But the objection will come, I mean, see the egoistical nature of man.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.892
If I move my hand like that towards you, immediately the man thinks,

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.892
“Why should she raise her hand like this, what is the, why does she do like this?”

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.892
Now, unless and until you are realised, how am I to tell you?

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.892
When Mohammed Sahib taught people that you must do namaz like this,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.892
everybody made fun of Him.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.892
They all said, “What is he talking about?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.892
How does he say, raise hand like this, do like this, namaz like this?”

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.892
All laughed at him. Not only that, they poisoned him, they tortured his life.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.892
All such great people have been tortured. But this life you cannot torture Me.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.892
That is sure. No one can torture Me.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.892
So this time you are going to get it, whether you like it or not! (Laughter)

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.892
Whether you call Me anything, I am going to do it, and I am going to work it out,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.892
and it is going to happen. I am determined to do it, and it works out.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.892
Now, so in the whole, what do you give Me?

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.892
People say, “Mother, it’s very difficult to surrender.”

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.892
I say, “Now what are you surrendering here? I don’t know.”

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.892
What is it you are surrendering?

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.892
I am just saying, surrender to your wisdom.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.892
Why are you surrendering to Me? What can you give Me? What have you got?

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.892
I mean, this idea of surrendering itself, like Hitler coming

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.892
and shooting you and you surrender at his feet. It’s something like that.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.892
There is surrendering to yourself.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.892
It is surrendering to your wisdom.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:19.892
What you surrender is your ego and your biased intelligence, which cheats you.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.892
Rise into your pure intelligence.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.892
And your superego, which is your conditioning, which is pulling you down,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.892
dragging you, giving you negativity, doing all kinds of things.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.892
All that has to be given up, and you have to be free people.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.892
All your bondages have to be dropped down.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.892
That’s the main point, is liberation I’m talking about, in the real sense.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.892
Not the liberation by which all your weaknesses should sit on your head.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:59.892
But you should be beyond weaknesses, you should be strong in yourself.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.892
That is what it is. Then, once you are liberated, you see your efficiency.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.892
You move like a dynamic personality. It’s a very different thing altogether.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.892
Unless and until you are liberated from your ego and superego.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.892
How are you going to function, I can’t understand.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.892
That’s why the mess is there. Why is the mess in this world?

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.892
Because you are not liberated.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.892
For that it is necessary that you should be free to choose.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.892
I cannot entice you to do it.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.892
At the most I can persuade, I can request you, I can come to your house,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.892
I’ll be very nice to you. I’ll try my level best because

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.892
I know this is what I should give you because I am a Mother.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:55.892
But how can I digest what I give you to eat? That you have to do.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.892
So let us see how it works out!

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.892
May God bless you.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.892
How the whole thing works out, maybe.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:12.892
It might work out very well and you might all get it in no time.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.892
Any questions?  What’s it?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.892
Why are you shaking on the left? Put your bandhan.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.892
No more drinking!

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.892
Man: I don’t drink anymore.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.892
Shri Mataji: Given up completely? Absolutely?

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.892
Man: Absolutely! Shri Mataji: How are you?

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.892
Lady: Fine.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.892
Shri Mataji: Imagine in one day you are just changed!

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.892
just think of it! Look at your face is different.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.892
You are a born realised, you see, that’s a very big thing.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.892
You should ask her. You must tell your experiences to these people, you see,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.892
so that they understand what it is like. Very important it is.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:29.892
Lady: My heart was very, very weak. My heart was very weak, my feet were blue.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.892
Shri Mataji: Yes, absolutely, I mean your blood pressure was very low.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.892
She was like a blue baby!

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:56.892
Now it’s alright. Very good. This happens for the people who are realised-souls.
