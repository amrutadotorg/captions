WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:09.180
good morning dear yogiji we 
congratulate you on your past birthday  

00:09.720 --> 00:14.280
we wish you health and bright 
inner state and creative longevity

00:19.380 --> 00:26.580
you are undoubtedly a seeker of Truth and 
surely your personal search is not complete  

00:27.540 --> 00:32.520
how fruitful and effective is it 
what more would you like to achieve

00:34.560 --> 00:36.420
there is a lot to achieve  

00:37.920 --> 00:47.340
now this is a stage where we have 
received our self-realization and one

00:51.660 --> 01:00.122
drop is in the ocean but one drop is not enough

01:00.660 --> 01:04.007
the ocean has to come in the one drop  

01:04.380 --> 01:16.451
so till we spread the message till many 
many more people get their realization

01:16.980 --> 01:25.860
the drop cannot become the ocean so one 
drop getting self-realization is meaningless  

01:27.480 --> 01:35.040
unless it becomes a collective happening and 
that is the only way the world can change

01:38.940 --> 01:46.080
thank you could you tell from your own 
sacred experience what is a Higher Love  

01:46.860 --> 01:51.720
how does anyone become an 
integral part of it  

01:52.320 --> 01:58.380
it is it a blessing or does it 
take conscious action to become one

02:01.260 --> 02:05.400
till a point you can say that 
you have to be aware of yourself  

02:06.900 --> 02:11.760
there has to be self-awareness so that you can

02:14.220 --> 02:22.620
correct your wayward thoughts negative 
thoughts negative thinking reacting to others  

02:23.340 --> 02:29.640
so for that there has to be an awareness 
otherwise you will not know what you're saying

02:31.920 --> 02:38.160
you may you will not know how negative you are 
joining negative people so you have to have  

02:38.160 --> 02:46.680
awareness but then a transition takes place when 
the Kundalini rises the transition takes place

02:49.080 --> 02:57.180
that the consciousness of your spirit 
starts coming in your conscious mind

03:00.840 --> 03:10.080
the spirit has consciousness okay so but that 
Consciousness is not in our conscious mind  

03:10.080 --> 03:16.800
what is in our conscious mind it is driven 
by the ego or it is driven by the super-ego  

03:18.360 --> 03:30.000
but not by the spirit so after self-realization 
when the Kundalini is able to establish itself at the Sahasrara chakra

03:30.240 --> 03:38.940
then we become conscious of the Kundalini 
or you can say the consciousness of the  

03:38.940 --> 03:45.900
Kundalini starts permeating through us so 
instead of the ego the superego that was  

03:45.900 --> 03:54.480
driving us now the spirit becomes a driving 
force so as the spirit is the reflection of  

03:54.480 --> 04:03.180
the Divine so we start getting Divine 
experiences we start experiences Divine Life  

04:03.900 --> 04:12.360
so that Divine love is different from the love of 
the ego which is possessive which is limited this  

04:12.360 --> 04:20.580
is unlimited and it doesn't stop once the flow 
starts you are in that state that is a difference

04:25.440 --> 04:33.000
tell us about certain connection of information 
feeling vibration and faith in Sahaja Yoga  

04:34.800 --> 04:45.300
see faith can be blind faith also blind faith 
is of no use you say I'm a Christian you say  

04:45.300 --> 04:52.500
I'm a Muslim and you have a blind faith but 
you don't have any experience so unless until  

04:52.500 --> 05:02.400
the connection is there It Is blind faith but 
once the connection is there then the flow starts  

05:02.940 --> 05:12.000
so the experience starts so then the faith 
becomes enlightened faith that is the difference

05:16.260 --> 05:23.820
how would you rate if possible of course the 
various period of Sahaja Yoga development the  

05:23.820 --> 05:31.285
70s and 80s and 90s and zeros and the 
present days

05:31.285 --> 05:39.231
see Sahaja Yoga started in 1970 Shri Mataji started giving realisation in 1970

05:39.231 --> 05:48.351
onwards so that was the first bloom

05:48.351 --> 05:54.000
the first flash and people did not 
understand because it was something very new  

05:54.720 --> 06:02.160
so a lot of people came out of curiosity they 
didn't understand and they left so in the first  

06:02.160 --> 06:13.920
five years that is 70 to 75 it was only a handful 
of people say mostly in India say about nearly 25  

06:13.920 --> 06:22.680
people Bombay 30 or 40 people Puna 15 people and 
maybe in London She said there were seven hippies  

06:23.520 --> 06:27.360
she had to struggle with but after 75

06:29.460 --> 06:35.880
Sahaja Yoga started spreading not only 
in India but in all countries slowly  

06:36.420 --> 06:45.240
so there was a period from 75 to 
1980 where public consciousness  

06:46.680 --> 06:52.740
started expanding about the Kundalini people 
didn't even know earlier what was Kundalini  

06:53.280 --> 06:58.260
they thought it was the horoscope [unsure] which is called  

07:00.000 --> 07:05.760
Kundalini kundali and Kundalini so there are two 
different things so there was a lot of confusion  

07:06.540 --> 07:17.760
so slowly slowly people accepted the idea that 
there is a germinating force at the base  

07:17.760 --> 07:29.220
of our spine which is called the Kundalini so it 
took about this period for this to permeate the  

07:30.360 --> 07:36.540
consciousness of the seekers because earlier 
they only talked about the soul the Atma  

07:37.560 --> 07:46.080
or the Spirit but you cannot until 
the light of the Kundalini falls on the spirit  

07:46.980 --> 07:54.720
the spirit doesn't come in your conscious mind 
or you can say on your  

07:54.720 --> 08:07.740
central nervous system so then 1980 to say 1990 
was a phase when people slowly started getting  

08:07.740 --> 08:18.360
established in Sahaja Yoga so in that establishment 
they were on the foundation stones of Sahaja Yoga  

08:19.260 --> 08:27.780
they were at the foundation of Sahaja Yoga and they 
were laying the foundation stones then 90 onwards  

08:28.800 --> 08:38.520
the building started rising from the 
foundation and in 2000 you can say  

08:39.300 --> 08:52.440
the roof of Sahaja Yoga was laid then after 2000 
onwards the new millennium was a time to embellish  

08:54.000 --> 08:58.440
the Mansion of Sahaja Yoga to decorate it to enjoy it

09:01.320 --> 09:09.780
so when the house is built now you are ready to 
live in it to enjoy it so people started having  

09:09.780 --> 09:17.820
more and more inner experiences not only miracles 
but they started having the joy of Sahaja Yoga earlier  

09:18.420 --> 09:24.060
was a knowledge of Sahaja Yoga we were trying to grasp we 
were trying to understand we were trying to digest  

09:25.860 --> 09:34.680
but once it we experienced it on our 
central nervous system the chakras became strong  

09:35.340 --> 09:43.200
and we were able to enjoy  the glory of our Mother

09:46.140 --> 09:54.540
we talk about life as a theater of constant 
struggle between God between good excuse me  

09:54.540 --> 10:03.420
and Evil what do you think about modern balance 
of powers how can those who seek to know the truth  

10:03.420 --> 10:15.000
not lose heart in this confusion role you see the 
good and the evil struggle has been going on since  

10:15.000 --> 10:23.940
our creation in every tradition there has been an 
epic like in India you had the epic of Mahabharata  

10:23.940 --> 10:37.260
in Greece you had the Iliad the struggle between 
good and evil so in every country there has  

10:37.260 --> 10:46.380
been a tradition of evolution where we have to 
overcome the evil and we have to rise above it  

10:48.300 --> 10:57.120
so in the present situation it is the same there 
are forces of evil and there are forces of good we  

10:57.120 --> 11:06.420
had the first World War the same thing we are the 
second World War the same thing but over a period  

11:07.560 --> 11:15.240
nations who have developed more awareness 
have understood that war is not the answer  

11:16.620 --> 11:25.860
so the concept of United Nations was established 
that you have a platform where you can sort out  

11:25.860 --> 11:35.760
your differences peacefully but still there 
are countries who divide the collective  

11:36.720 --> 11:49.740
resolutions of United Nations and they're very 
defined they are aggressing other countries but  

11:49.740 --> 12:00.780
the difference today is that these countries are 
in isolation the rest of the world is on one side

12:03.240 --> 12:08.460
like the resolution of United Nations the 
countries who have passed the resolution  

12:08.460 --> 12:16.980
are on one side and these defined aggressive 
countries are isolated all alone by themselves  

12:18.840 --> 12:24.360
and if they carry on the 
aggression the rest of the world  

12:26.340 --> 12:34.500
will join together and they will be defeated so 
there is maybe temporary gain they may feel that  

12:34.500 --> 12:40.800
they have won something but that will be very 
temporary they cannot withstand the collective  

12:42.600 --> 12:49.740
like if there is one stick you can break it but 
all the sticks are in a bunch you can't break it  

12:49.740 --> 12:57.960
so when the collective world on one side and 
one or two countries alone on the other side  

12:58.620 --> 13:07.680
they will eventually be defeated so this 
awareness has come now in the collective  

13:08.220 --> 13:17.700
that evil cannot survive there is no 
place for evil in a globalized world  

13:18.360 --> 13:28.260
a globalized world is driven by collective 
consciousness so it has to be the rule of

13:30.300 --> 13:36.720
the Spirit and that time is 
now gone that one Hitler or  

13:36.720 --> 13:43.980
one muslim could create havoc and 
turn the world around now they cannot

13:47.280 --> 13:54.480
many of the 90s generation since 
really believed that vibrational knowledge  

13:54.480 --> 14:03.120
will change not only their lives but the whole 
world nature Sahaja Yogis will enter various  

14:03.120 --> 14:09.480
international organizations and will be able to 
positively influence the development of countries  

14:09.480 --> 14:17.760
and the entire planet scientists will begin to 
explore and implement the methods of  

14:17.760 --> 14:25.980
sahaja yoga why did why this didn't happen and 
will it ever happen no of course it has happened  

14:27.240 --> 14:34.980
you don't remember the Berlin Wall fell 
you don't remember the Soviet Union dissolved  

14:35.940 --> 14:42.660
it did happen but you didn't relate 
it to Sahaja Yoga you didn't relate it to vibrations  

14:43.440 --> 14:49.920
you didn't see how all the dictators all the 
despots who were ruling country how all of  

14:49.920 --> 14:58.860
them got exposed how so many countries  got liberated from autocrat despots  

14:59.640 --> 15:08.220
now there's hardly any country left I mean even 
Syria where you had this Saddam Hussein even he  

15:08.220 --> 15:20.520
was removed you had this terrorist organizations  Al-Qaeda and all these and their leader was  

15:21.960 --> 15:33.600
killed so it has happened everywhere everywhere 
in every country you had in your in these  

15:33.600 --> 15:41.940
countries all these dictators were removed 
so now hardly any country has maybe one  

15:41.940 --> 15:48.420
or two countries are left which still have 
dictators but nowhere else so it is all  

15:48.420 --> 15:56.160
happening only thing is we are not aware of it 
and you will see you saw that when we had this  

15:57.480 --> 16:05.640
COVID how countries helped each other they gave 
vaccines they gave vaccines to poor countries  

16:05.640 --> 16:16.800
in India we gave vaccines to so many countries in 
Africa who didn't have so we the world has started  

16:16.800 --> 16:23.580
sharing much more they did not only give to their 
own country they shared it with other countries  

16:25.020 --> 16:29.940
so it is happening the world is changing 
the world has changed drastically

16:31.980 --> 16:38.880
this is because of Sahaja Yoga because 
of the Sahaja Yogis giving vibrations  

16:38.880 --> 16:43.860
they're putting their attention to all the 
problems in the world the world has changed  

16:44.760 --> 16:52.860
this would not have happened before 
Sahaja Yoga people every country is only  

16:52.860 --> 16:58.800
thinking of their own people only their own 
national interests nobody was thinking of  

16:58.800 --> 17:06.600
the underprivileged countries who didn't have 
the vaccines so it has happened in a very big way  

17:07.620 --> 17:13.440
people are thinking collectively that's what 
Sahaja Yoga is collective consciousness earlier  

17:13.440 --> 17:19.380
on everybody was only for me and my country now 
they've understood that no country can survive  

17:21.300 --> 17:28.140
all alone you cannot be an island 
anymore we are all in this together

17:30.780 --> 17:35.760
so don't make that mistake thinking that it has 
not happened it has happened in a very big way  

17:36.660 --> 17:41.700
but maybe you're not able to 
see it that's your problem

17:45.240 --> 17:53.040
in recent years the pandemic and the conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine okay let's a little  

17:53.040 --> 18:01.740
bit change our scenery uh this conflict between 
Russia and Ukraine and pandemic too have been  

18:01.740 --> 18:07.560
the main themes that have influenced 
changed in the global situation  

18:08.340 --> 18:18.960
let's look at them separately in your opinion 
is a viral pandemic are our creation of human hands  

18:18.960 --> 18:29.340
politics or aerial attacks on the subtle level 
you see according to Sahaja Yoga all these viruses  

18:30.000 --> 18:35.100
are nothing but plants and animals 
that have gone out of evolution

18:37.140 --> 18:46.620
so as so it's not a state where there 
is no viruses they are all there but they are  

18:46.620 --> 18:55.980
in their you can say they're sleeping 
but as our immunity levels are going down  

18:57.480 --> 19:03.360
because of adharmic lifestyles

19:04.260 --> 19:12.900
so our chakras getting weak especially the 
Muladhara chakra the biggest attack today is  

19:14.280 --> 19:23.820
on the Muladhara chakra and this chakra is 
the most important chakra because this  

19:23.820 --> 19:33.780
is the chakra that is supporting all the other 
chapters that's why it's called Muladhara, adhar means the support  

19:34.440 --> 19:43.200
mul means the root so this is the support of 
the entire subtle system of all our chakras  

19:43.860 --> 19:58.140
and if this chakra is weak vulnerable 
abused disrespected then all these viruses  

19:59.700 --> 20:06.120
can penetrate us so it's not it's the environment 
is full of viruses it has always been it is  

20:06.120 --> 20:18.420
nothing new but as human immunity because of 
lack of dharma of lack of mariadas have destroyed  

20:19.920 --> 20:28.380
the first chakra chakra the Muladhara chakra so all these 
viruses can penetrate as you said  

20:28.380 --> 20:36.060
the pandemic the example is a pandemic now 
let's take the statistics of the countries  

20:37.620 --> 20:44.940
which had the most cases and the most 
deaths in ratio of the population  

20:46.680 --> 20:55.260
so in ratio of the population the highest were in 
America and in ratio of the population the least  

20:56.160 --> 21:03.120
were in India why because the 
Muladhara of India's is strong  

21:04.080 --> 21:13.080
and why because of muladhara of the America is 
weak they have disrespected their muladhara they  

21:13.620 --> 21:21.720
have the same sex marriages they encourage 
the same-sex marriages children they can adopt  

21:21.720 --> 21:31.260
the same-sex parents can adopt children so 
they have totally broken every single mariada  

21:32.280 --> 21:39.960
and so they're completely one group earlier that's 
where they had the maximum AIDS and now they had  

21:39.960 --> 21:51.660
the maximum cases of the pandemic the COVID and 
the maximum number of deaths so from this gives  

21:51.660 --> 22:04.380
you a perspective of the relationship between our 
chakras and the outside environment be it viruses  

22:04.380 --> 22:23.639
be it germs be it any kind of toxic material the  you can say the test is they all tested at the Muladhara charka

22:28.140 --> 22:38.460
can you tell us about your meeting with the 
president of India called Mr Kovind in 19.  

22:38.460 --> 22:52.560
yes 2019 I was invited by the president 
of India to inaugurate my book Gita Enlightened  

22:53.340 --> 23:00.840
which is a revised edition 
for me meeting the present

23:01.860 --> 23:10.680
situation and the present change in 
the world and he was very pleased  

23:12.060 --> 23:19.860
to inaugurate the book he went through 
it and we discussed many things  

23:20.640 --> 23:27.420
and I'm very thankful to Shri Mataji 
for giving me this opportunity  

23:28.620 --> 23:36.180
She herself had directed this book from the very 
beginning and has written many parts of it also  

23:37.500 --> 23:43.740
so this is of course very relevant to a 
understanding today's situation globally

23:46.020 --> 23:53.760
if we will return to previous question about 
influence of Sahaja Yogi on this world  

23:54.360 --> 24:02.160
I think that this meeting was 
very fruitful yes yes very fruitful

24:04.920 --> 24:15.960
he got his realizations really yes yes he when 
I put the photo of Shri Mataji I gave him a photo  

24:15.960 --> 24:23.460
of Shri Mataji and he put his hands and he felt 
very cool vibrations so he he's got his realisation  

24:24.240 --> 24:35.760
he's a very humble man a very humble man can 
you shortly remember some leaders of India who  

24:35.760 --> 24:46.320
got realization during these 50 years of Sahaja Yoga so many 
so many starting with that prime prime minister  

24:46.320 --> 24:55.440
Lal Bahadur Shastri because Sir CP Srivastava has 
written a book which Shri Mataji herself inaugurated  

24:57.060 --> 25:04.320
Shri Mataji had given him realisation 
then president Sanjiva Reddy who had  

25:04.320 --> 25:12.300
cancer and She magically cured his cancer then 
he got realization then so many ministers  

25:12.300 --> 25:25.680
in the cabinet so many governors of India so 
many top people in every Department in every  

25:25.680 --> 25:37.740
aspect of life in Russia she was invited at the 
Kremlin this was a time of Gorbachev and the

25:39.900 --> 25:48.420
she gave realization to all the ministers at the 
Kremlin and that is the time that they signed

25:50.460 --> 25:59.820
a protocol with life eternal Trust and the 
Ministry of Health of USSR for a joint venture

26:02.520 --> 26:13.320
where by we will teach them about the Sahaja Yoga treatments and that project carried on under  

26:13.320 --> 26:24.480
the director Dr Alien who was the director of 
the health and She gave workshops for 500 doctors  

26:25.140 --> 26:30.960
and they got the all of them got their realization 
that is actually how Sahaja Yoga spread in Russia  

26:30.960 --> 26:38.640
through this Ministry of Health so a lot of work 
a tremendous amount of work She has done with  

26:40.440 --> 26:48.060
leaders and with the ministers and 
governors and heads of institutions

26:51.420 --> 26:57.000
the hundreds anniversary of our beloved 
Teacher and Mother is coming soon  

26:58.020 --> 27:06.300
in spite of the problematic issues we have raised 
Sahaja Yoga is developing quite successfully all  

27:06.300 --> 27:13.260
over the world what would you like to wish 
to all Sahaja Yogis on the eve of this great date  

27:14.700 --> 27:23.880
you know Shri Mataji always said that 
as I have loved you, you should love others

27:26.340 --> 27:38.100
so that's the only message love others as She 
has loved us that is the legacy Her living legacy  

27:39.060 --> 27:46.800
in us and hundreds times to give 
everyone else on the 100th birthday
