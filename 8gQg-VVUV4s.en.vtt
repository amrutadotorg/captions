00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.180
good morning dear yogiji we 
congratulate you on your past birthday  

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.280
we wish you health and bright 
inner state and creative longevity

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.580
you are undoubtedly a seeker of Truth and 
surely your personal search is not complete  

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.520
how fruitful and effective is it 
what more would you like to achieve

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.420
there is a lot to achieve  

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:47.340
now this is a stage where we have 
received our self-realization and one

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.122
drop is in the ocean but one drop is not enough

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.007
the ocean has to come in the one drop  

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:16.451
so till we spread the message till many 
many more people get their realization

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:25.860
the drop cannot become the ocean so one 
drop getting self-realization is meaningless  

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:35.040
unless it becomes a collective happening and 
that is the only way the world can change

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.080
thank you could you tell from your own 
sacred experience what is a Higher Love  

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.720
how does anyone become an 
integral part of it  

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.380
it is it a blessing or does it 
take conscious action to become one

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.400
till a point you can say that 
you have to be aware of yourself  

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.760
there has to be self-awareness so that you can

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:22.620
correct your wayward thoughts negative 
thoughts negative thinking reacting to others  

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.640
so for that there has to be an awareness 
otherwise you will not know what you're saying

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.160
you may you will not know how negative you are 
joining negative people so you have to have  

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:46.680
awareness but then a transition takes place when 
the Kundalini rises the transition takes place

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.180
that the consciousness of your spirit 
starts coming in your conscious mind

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:10.080
the spirit has consciousness okay so but that 
Consciousness is not in our conscious mind  

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.800
what is in our conscious mind it is driven 
by the ego or it is driven by the super-ego  

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:30.000
but not by the spirit so after self-realization 
when the Kundalini is able to establish itself at the Sahasrara chakra

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:38.940
then we become conscious of the Kundalini 
or you can say the consciousness of the  

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.900
Kundalini starts permeating through us so 
instead of the ego the superego that was  

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:54.480
driving us now the spirit becomes a driving 
force so as the spirit is the reflection of  

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:03.180
the Divine so we start getting Divine 
experiences we start experiences Divine Life  

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:12.360
so that Divine love is different from the love of 
the ego which is possessive which is limited this  

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:20.580
is unlimited and it doesn't stop once the flow 
starts you are in that state that is a difference

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.000
tell us about certain connection of information 
feeling vibration and faith in Sahaja Yoga  

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:45.300
see faith can be blind faith also blind faith 
is of no use you say I'm a Christian you say  

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.500
I'm a Muslim and you have a blind faith but 
you don't have any experience so unless until  

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:02.400
the connection is there It Is blind faith but 
once the connection is there then the flow starts  

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:12.000
so the experience starts so then the faith 
becomes enlightened faith that is the difference

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.820
how would you rate if possible of course the 
various period of Sahaja Yoga development the  

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:31.285
70s and 80s and 90s and zeros and the 
present days

00:05:31.285 --> 00:05:39.231
see Sahaja Yoga started in 1970 Shri Mataji started giving realisation in 1970

00:05:39.231 --> 00:05:48.351
onwards so that was the first bloom

00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:54.000
the first flash and people did not 
understand because it was something very new  

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.160
so a lot of people came out of curiosity they 
didn't understand and they left so in the first  

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:13.920
five years that is 70 to 75 it was only a handful 
of people say mostly in India say about nearly 25  

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:22.680
people Bombay 30 or 40 people Puna 15 people and 
maybe in London She said there were seven hippies  

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.360
she had to struggle with but after 75

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.880
Sahaja Yoga started spreading not only 
in India but in all countries slowly  

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:45.240
so there was a period from 75 to 
1980 where public consciousness  

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.740
started expanding about the Kundalini people 
didn't even know earlier what was Kundalini  

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.260
they thought it was the horoscope [unsure] which is called  

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.760
Kundalini kundali and Kundalini so there are two 
different things so there was a lot of confusion  

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:17.760
so slowly slowly people accepted the idea that 
there is a germinating force at the base  

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:29.220
of our spine which is called the Kundalini so it 
took about this period for this to permeate the  

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:36.540
consciousness of the seekers because earlier 
they only talked about the soul the Atma  

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:46.080
or the Spirit but you cannot until 
the light of the Kundalini falls on the spirit  

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:54.720
the spirit doesn't come in your conscious mind 
or you can say on your  

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:07.740
central nervous system so then 1980 to say 1990 
was a phase when people slowly started getting  

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:18.360
established in Sahaja Yoga so in that establishment 
they were on the foundation stones of Sahaja Yoga  

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:27.780
they were at the foundation of Sahaja Yoga and they 
were laying the foundation stones then 90 onwards  

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:38.520
the building started rising from the 
foundation and in 2000 you can say  

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:52.440
the roof of Sahaja Yoga was laid then after 2000 
onwards the new millennium was a time to embellish  

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.440
the Mansion of Sahaja Yoga to decorate it to enjoy it

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:09.780
so when the house is built now you are ready to 
live in it to enjoy it so people started having  

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:17.820
more and more inner experiences not only miracles 
but they started having the joy of Sahaja Yoga earlier  

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:24.060
was a knowledge of Sahaja Yoga we were trying to grasp we 
were trying to understand we were trying to digest  

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:34.680
but once it we experienced it on our 
central nervous system the chakras became strong  

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:43.200
and we were able to enjoy  the glory of our Mother

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:54.540
we talk about life as a theater of constant 
struggle between God between good excuse me  

00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:03.420
and Evil what do you think about modern balance 
of powers how can those who seek to know the truth  

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:15.000
not lose heart in this confusion role you see the 
good and the evil struggle has been going on since  

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.940
our creation in every tradition there has been an 
epic like in India you had the epic of Mahabharata  

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:37.260
in Greece you had the Iliad the struggle between 
good and evil so in every country there has  

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:46.380
been a tradition of evolution where we have to 
overcome the evil and we have to rise above it  

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:57.120
so in the present situation it is the same there 
are forces of evil and there are forces of good we  

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:06.420
had the first World War the same thing we are the 
second World War the same thing but over a period  

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:15.240
nations who have developed more awareness 
have understood that war is not the answer  

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:25.860
so the concept of United Nations was established 
that you have a platform where you can sort out  

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:35.760
your differences peacefully but still there 
are countries who divide the collective  

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:49.740
resolutions of United Nations and they're very 
defined they are aggressing other countries but  

00:11:49.740 --> 00:12:00.780
the difference today is that these countries are 
in isolation the rest of the world is on one side

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:08.460
like the resolution of United Nations the 
countries who have passed the resolution  

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:16.980
are on one side and these defined aggressive 
countries are isolated all alone by themselves  

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:24.360
and if they carry on the 
aggression the rest of the world  

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:34.500
will join together and they will be defeated so 
there is maybe temporary gain they may feel that  

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:40.800
they have won something but that will be very 
temporary they cannot withstand the collective  

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:49.740
like if there is one stick you can break it but 
all the sticks are in a bunch you can't break it  

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:57.960
so when the collective world on one side and 
one or two countries alone on the other side  

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:07.680
they will eventually be defeated so this 
awareness has come now in the collective  

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:17.700
that evil cannot survive there is no 
place for evil in a globalized world  

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:28.260
a globalized world is driven by collective 
consciousness so it has to be the rule of

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:36.720
the Spirit and that time is 
now gone that one Hitler or  

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:43.980
one muslim could create havoc and 
turn the world around now they cannot

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:54.480
many of the 90s generation since 
really believed that vibrational knowledge  

00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:03.120
will change not only their lives but the whole 
world nature Sahaja Yogis will enter various  

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:09.480
international organizations and will be able to 
positively influence the development of countries  

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:17.760
and the entire planet scientists will begin to 
explore and implement the methods of  

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:25.980
sahaja yoga why did why this didn't happen and 
will it ever happen no of course it has happened  

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:34.980
you don't remember the Berlin Wall fell 
you don't remember the Soviet Union dissolved  

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:42.660
it did happen but you didn't relate 
it to Sahaja Yoga you didn't relate it to vibrations  

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:49.920
you didn't see how all the dictators all the 
despots who were ruling country how all of  

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:58.860
them got exposed how so many countries  got liberated from autocrat despots  

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:08.220
now there's hardly any country left I mean even 
Syria where you had this Saddam Hussein even he  

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:20.520
was removed you had this terrorist organizations  Al-Qaeda and all these and their leader was  

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:33.600
killed so it has happened everywhere everywhere 
in every country you had in your in these  

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:41.940
countries all these dictators were removed 
so now hardly any country has maybe one  

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:48.420
or two countries are left which still have 
dictators but nowhere else so it is all  

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:56.160
happening only thing is we are not aware of it 
and you will see you saw that when we had this  

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:05.640
COVID how countries helped each other they gave 
vaccines they gave vaccines to poor countries  

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:16.800
in India we gave vaccines to so many countries in 
Africa who didn't have so we the world has started  

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:23.580
sharing much more they did not only give to their 
own country they shared it with other countries  

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:29.940
so it is happening the world is changing 
the world has changed drastically

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:38.880
this is because of Sahaja Yoga because 
of the Sahaja Yogis giving vibrations  

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.860
they're putting their attention to all the 
problems in the world the world has changed  

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:52.860
this would not have happened before 
Sahaja Yoga people every country is only  

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:58.800
thinking of their own people only their own 
national interests nobody was thinking of  

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:06.600
the underprivileged countries who didn't have 
the vaccines so it has happened in a very big way  

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:13.440
people are thinking collectively that's what 
Sahaja Yoga is collective consciousness earlier  

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:19.380
on everybody was only for me and my country now 
they've understood that no country can survive  

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:28.140
all alone you cannot be an island 
anymore we are all in this together

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.760
so don't make that mistake thinking that it has 
not happened it has happened in a very big way  

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:41.700
but maybe you're not able to 
see it that's your problem

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:53.040
in recent years the pandemic and the conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine okay let's a little  

00:17:53.040 --> 00:18:01.740
bit change our scenery uh this conflict between 
Russia and Ukraine and pandemic too have been  

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:07.560
the main themes that have influenced 
changed in the global situation  

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:18.960
let's look at them separately in your opinion 
is a viral pandemic are our creation of human hands  

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:29.340
politics or aerial attacks on the subtle level 
you see according to Sahaja Yoga all these viruses  

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.100
are nothing but plants and animals 
that have gone out of evolution

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:46.620
so as so it's not a state where there 
is no viruses they are all there but they are  

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:55.980
in their you can say they're sleeping 
but as our immunity levels are going down  

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:03.360
because of adharmic lifestyles

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:12.900
so our chakras getting weak especially the 
Muladhara chakra the biggest attack today is  

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:23.820
on the Muladhara chakra and this chakra is 
the most important chakra because this  

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:33.780
is the chakra that is supporting all the other 
chapters that's why it's called Muladhara, adhar means the support  

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:43.200
mul means the root so this is the support of 
the entire subtle system of all our chakras  

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:58.140
and if this chakra is weak vulnerable 
abused disrespected then all these viruses  

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:06.120
can penetrate us so it's not it's the environment 
is full of viruses it has always been it is  

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:18.420
nothing new but as human immunity because of 
lack of dharma of lack of mariadas have destroyed  

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:28.380
the first chakra chakra the Muladhara chakra so all these 
viruses can penetrate as you said  

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:36.060
the pandemic the example is a pandemic now 
let's take the statistics of the countries  

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:44.940
which had the most cases and the most 
deaths in ratio of the population  

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:55.260
so in ratio of the population the highest were in 
America and in ratio of the population the least  

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:03.120
were in India why because the 
Muladhara of India's is strong  

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:13.080
and why because of muladhara of the America is 
weak they have disrespected their muladhara they  

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:21.720
have the same sex marriages they encourage 
the same-sex marriages children they can adopt  

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:31.260
the same-sex parents can adopt children so 
they have totally broken every single mariada  

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:39.960
and so they're completely one group earlier that's 
where they had the maximum AIDS and now they had  

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:51.660
the maximum cases of the pandemic the COVID and 
the maximum number of deaths so from this gives  

00:21:51.660 --> 00:22:04.380
you a perspective of the relationship between our 
chakras and the outside environment be it viruses  

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:23.639
be it germs be it any kind of toxic material the  you can say the test is they all tested at the Muladhara charka

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:38.460
can you tell us about your meeting with the 
president of India called Mr Kovind in 19.  

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:52.560
yes 2019 I was invited by the president 
of India to inaugurate my book Gita Enlightened  

00:22:53.340 --> 00:23:00.840
which is a revised edition 
for me meeting the present

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:10.680
situation and the present change in 
the world and he was very pleased  

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:19.860
to inaugurate the book he went through 
it and we discussed many things  

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:27.420
and I'm very thankful to Shri Mataji 
for giving me this opportunity  

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:36.180
She herself had directed this book from the very 
beginning and has written many parts of it also  

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:43.740
so this is of course very relevant to a 
understanding today's situation globally

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:53.760
if we will return to previous question about 
influence of Sahaja Yogi on this world  

00:23:54.360 --> 00:24:02.160
I think that this meeting was 
very fruitful yes yes very fruitful

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:15.960
he got his realizations really yes yes he when 
I put the photo of Shri Mataji I gave him a photo
