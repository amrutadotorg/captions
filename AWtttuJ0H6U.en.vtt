00:01.701 --> 00:09.395
Now, we have decided not to have\h
too many marriages in Switzerland,\h\h

00:09.510 --> 00:16.080
because, as you see now, we cannot go up\h
to that point where we can have marriages.

00:16.080 --> 00:19.800
It’s all full of snow, you cannot have\h
fire, you cannot have all the arrangements.

00:19.800 --> 00:23.400
Even a garland of flowers\h
may cost you fifty pounds.

00:23.400 --> 00:28.140
And it’s not going to be cheaper marriage,\h
in the sense that everything is so expensive,\h\h

00:28.140 --> 00:30.120
even if you find out in the market.

00:30.120 --> 00:35.850
Now I have to make a request to you people: those\h
who want to get married in Switzerland should be\h\h

00:35.850 --> 00:41.430
mostly the people who want to remarry, or those\h
people who can not at all afford to go to India.

00:41.430 --> 00:47.760
But try to help the people who do not have enough\h
to go to India, that they get married in India.

00:47.760 --> 00:52.460
It’s much easier, it’s much\h
[inaudible], much more simple.

00:52.460 --> 00:52.470
All right?

00:52.470 --> 01:06.510
So, if you understand that, if you can go\h
to India and if you have leave, then do it.

01:06.510 --> 01:07.830
It’s better to do it there.

01:07.830 --> 01:17.040
And you need not jump…They say that [Indian\h
saying], means a person who is very anxious\h\h

01:17.040 --> 01:23.010
to get married, doesn’t even raise the\h
head-dress here, he ties upon his knee.

01:23.010 --> 01:27.090
So one should not be that much excited.

01:27.090 --> 01:31.650
Take a very sensible view of the whole\h
thing, those who want to get married.

01:31.650 --> 01:37.740
And we have decided on the people\h
who could marry in Switzerland.

01:40.210 --> 01:45.940
So those who have no money or something,\h\h

01:45.940 --> 01:50.380
apart from this you should try to help\h
them if possible, every way possible.

01:50.380 --> 01:52.000
I will also try to help.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.230
Now another thing I have to say\h
is that you all have to send some\h\h

01:59.230 --> 02:03.370
money for My travel, because I have to travel now.

02:03.370 --> 02:08.020
We have been traveling throughout\h
England, again I have to travel;\h\h

02:08.020 --> 02:13.450
and if there is no travel money,\h
you know who has to pay the amount.

02:13.450 --> 02:19.150
But the people will be again\h
replacing the money of the travel,\h\h

02:19.150 --> 02:23.110
which will again be there ready for other travel.

02:23.110 --> 02:26.110
As it is, for India and all\h
that, you don’t have to pay.

02:26.110 --> 02:33.130
But, I think that, if you decide that I have to\h
travel, that you should pay for My traveling,\h\h

02:33.130 --> 02:36.925
then it is better that you should\h
send some money for the traveling.

02:36.925 --> 02:42.730
We have been all over the country and, so\h
far, nobody has paid anything for travel.

02:42.730 --> 02:46.060
So please try to send the\h
traveling money to Gavin Brown,\h\h

02:46.060 --> 02:52.450
and all the money that you want to\h
contribute to him and the travel.

02:52.450 --> 02:57.220
Now another one, we have decided\h
now to keep the emergency money.

02:57.220 --> 03:01.780
Plus, if you people donate\h
more than the travel money,\h\h

03:01.780 --> 03:07.690
or the money you want to donate for the programs\h
and all that, should be in the emergency money.

03:07.690 --> 03:14.980
It can be used for other things\h
like mailing, for photography\h\h

03:14.980 --> 03:22.705
or any kind of such expenses where you\h
have to have a hall – all these things.

03:22.705 --> 03:29.410
Certain people, like Isle of Wight people have\h
sent five-hundred pounds for the program, within\h\h

03:29.410 --> 03:35.440
three persons it was too much so I decided to\h
pay half of it to them back to the travel money.

03:35.440 --> 03:43.660
Then we have to buy one tape recorder which will\h
cost about sixteen hundred, fifty in the market,\h\h

03:43.660 --> 03:50.260
for which we have money – not the whole but we\h
have lot of it – and we have to buy that also.

03:50.260 --> 03:56.020
So the only now money left with us is\h
emergency money and the travel money.

03:56.020 --> 03:58.510
Out of it, the travel money is very limited.

03:58.510 --> 04:05.410
If I have to travel, then either I pay and\h
then we reimburse, or something like happens.

04:05.410 --> 04:09.340
It’s a big problem, because how\h
to adjust it and how to do it?

04:09.340 --> 04:12.040
So keep it free from all these problems.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.730
If you people donate some money for\h
the travel money to Gavin Brown,\h\h

04:15.730 --> 04:24.010
it will be easier, which will\h
be again replaced by the people.

04:24.010 --> 04:27.220
But just now the traveling is\h
important, for which you have to pay.

04:27.220 --> 04:33.790
And the rest of it, just now, is that we\h
don’t have to pay much for anything else.

04:33.790 --> 04:36.040
So that all the money should transfer to\h\h

04:36.040 --> 04:40.381
the travel money – for the time\h
being, only for the time being.
