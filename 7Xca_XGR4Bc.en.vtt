00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.034
﻿Diwali Puja. Moscow (Russia), 12 November 1993.

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:08.667
It is so very gratifying to see

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:16.497
so many people from all over the world have come to Russia

00:00:16.697 --> 00:00:21.497
to worship the Goddess Lakshmi.

00:00:37.718 --> 00:00:46.396
When you cannot explain everything intellectually,

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:54.896
then you take course to arts to express yourself.

00:01:06.696 --> 00:01:12.180
And then you take to symbols to express

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.716
what you cannot say verbally or cannot express rationally.

00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:36.245
This is what an artist does, also a poet does

00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:42.579
that he extends his imagination

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:48.732
to such an extent that he creates a symbol.

00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:07.605
But this mind is limited and it can only go up to a point

00:02:12.952 --> 00:02:18.338
and when it is not substantiated by truth and reality,

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.879
after some time, it falls.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.783
The whole linear movement falls down and there is a decline.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.393
That is what we find in every area today,

00:02:42.593 --> 00:02:49.601
specially that everything which was sublime has declined.

00:03:02.303 --> 00:03:11.391
This decline takes place and people start accepting it.

00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:26.242
But after Self Realization, when you have become the Spirit,

00:03:26.442 --> 00:03:31.317
your imagination touches the reality.

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:41.912
Then the symbols which were perverted,

00:03:42.112 --> 00:03:48.143
which was misrepresented, drop out.

00:03:55.786 --> 00:04:04.266
And you touch the reality of the symbols.

00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:16.042
This is exactly what has happened everywhere.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:31.654
For example, we had in India the Goddess of wealth as Lakshmi,

00:04:38.594 --> 00:04:41.723
and this symbol of Lakshmi

00:04:41.923 --> 00:04:48.097
was described by saints and seers in reality.

00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:59.806
But later on people did not understand

00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:04.978
the symbol and the reality behind it.

00:05:11.665 --> 00:05:19.472
And they thought that the symbol of Lakshmi is money,

00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:29.718
is wealth, gold, silver, diamonds, riches.

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:38.744
And they started worshipping money.

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:48.555
That is how the symbol of wealth,

00:05:48.755 --> 00:05:53.890
Goddess the Lakshmi, was perverted.

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:03.053
People don’t understand that when they have money,

00:06:03.253 --> 00:06:08.182
why they start doing wrong things.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.376
Even in India, nowadays people are so perverted

00:06:19.576 --> 00:06:25.863
that if you give hundred rupees to a poor man, he will go to a pub.

00:06:26.063 --> 00:06:29.749
To a pub.

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:44.558
He will only think of self-indulgence, and not of others,

00:06:49.207 --> 00:06:56.566
not his family, not his children, not his country, but himself.

00:07:03.538 --> 00:07:08.056
But the symbol of Lakshmi is very different.

00:07:11.548 --> 00:07:19.250
Firstly the one who has Lakshmi has to be a mother,

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:26.794
like a mother, must have the love of a mother who loves her children.

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:37.476
She has to be a woman

00:07:37.676 --> 00:07:45.411
and woman stands for something very sublime.

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:55.562
Mother is the source of all the energies,

00:07:55.762 --> 00:08:00.903
but she has patience,

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:10.098
and she has love, compassion.

00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:15.674
So a man who has money cannot be happy

00:08:15.874 --> 00:08:18.853
unless and until he is compassionate.

00:08:19.053 --> 00:08:24.689
He uses this money for giving it to others.

00:08:32.798 --> 00:08:37.143
But what has happened today in the countries which are supposed to be affluent?

00:08:37.344 --> 00:08:45.289
They have gone all out to destroy themselves with the money that they have.

00:08:55.809 --> 00:09:01.187
Also they have used money to express their anger,

00:09:01.387 --> 00:09:06.835
and their lust, their greed.

00:09:13.335 --> 00:09:17.341
Also they have wasted their money in trying to show off

00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:23.072
that they are something very individualistic.

00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:36.563
Like in America, went there and I met a very rich man.

00:09:40.798 --> 00:09:44.465
And when I got to his car, he told Me that,

00:09:44.665 --> 00:09:50.746
"My handles of the door open the other way around."

00:09:58.467 --> 00:10:03.283
So I said, "Why? What is the use of this kind of a thing?

00:10:03.483 --> 00:10:08.861
Anybody can get locked up in your car."

00:10:13.962 --> 00:10:18.200
So he said, "It is my individuality, is my genius, you see,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.613
which has created this something not so common."

00:10:29.358 --> 00:10:32.948
And then I went into his house, he told,

00:10:33.148 --> 00:10:38.643
"You be careful this bathroom is very special."

00:10:44.768 --> 00:10:46.938
And then he said, "If you press this button,

00:10:47.138 --> 00:10:52.271
you will just jump into the swimming pool."

00:10:57.869 --> 00:11:03.259
I said, "I don’t want to go into this bathroom."

00:11:08.654 --> 00:11:11.438
And then he took Me to his bed and he said,

00:11:11.638 --> 00:11:15.696
"This bed is special if you press this button, your legs will go up,

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:21.158
if you press this button, your head will go up."

00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:31.977
I said, "I don’t want to do these acrobats the whole night,

00:11:32.177 --> 00:11:36.646
I’ll sleep on the ground."

00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:45.813
So...

00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:55.178
Now the Eastern block people sometimes think that Americans,

00:11:55.378 --> 00:11:59.463
or the Europeans, or the people who are so called affluent

00:11:59.663 --> 00:12:04.303
are very happy people.

00:12:11.048 --> 00:12:15.150
They are not because they have no wisdom.

00:12:17.309 --> 00:12:24.364
They go on wasting money like this, they are bankrupt, good for nothing.

00:12:29.695 --> 00:12:32.128
One day they’ll be moving in a Rolls-Royce,

00:12:32.328 --> 00:12:36.976
tomorrow they’ll be on the street begging.

00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:47.268
Because there is no Lakshmi in them, it’s just money.

00:12:52.747 --> 00:12:55.360
So the symbol of Lakshmi you should try to understand,

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.906
is very important.

00:13:02.563 --> 00:13:09.186
Because if the Lakshmi resides in your Nabhi

00:13:09.386 --> 00:13:15.045
and if She is satisfied, then only the Mahalakshmi principle rises,

00:13:15.245 --> 00:13:20.248
means then you start seeing beyond.

00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:38.034
Now these people had so much money

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.370
that they didn’t know what to do and they thought

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:45.789
now this not sufficient, we have to seek further.

00:13:53.562 --> 00:13:58.486
Then they took to drugs and all kinds of things.

00:14:03.674 --> 00:14:07.899
If you find anybody in England or America,

00:14:08.099 --> 00:14:14.118
any place with torn clothes, know that he is a rich man.

00:14:14.318 --> 00:14:18.758
With torn clothes is a rich man.

00:14:27.485 --> 00:14:35.418
This is the condition of perversion where everything is perverted.

00:14:45.187 --> 00:14:51.669
Now the Lakshmi principle is like this,

00:14:51.869 --> 00:14:55.552
that as I said, She is a Mother.

00:14:55.752 --> 00:14:58.899
She is a Mother.

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:04.255
In two hands... What is it? Sit down.

00:15:10.855 --> 00:15:17.714
In two hands, She has got pink lotuses.

00:15:25.038 --> 00:15:28.286
Now the pink lotus means

00:15:28.486 --> 00:15:36.106
a flower which is come out of the pond

00:15:36.306 --> 00:15:44.888
and allows even a thorny insect to come inside it.

00:15:55.477 --> 00:15:59.662
That means a rich man, or a man with Lakshmi,

00:15:59.862 --> 00:16:06.334
must have a house, or a whole household, or a estate

00:16:06.534 --> 00:16:12.251
which is very beautiful like the lotus, pink in color,

00:16:12.451 --> 00:16:19.969
means inviting, welcoming everyone, all kinds of guests.

00:16:33.332 --> 00:16:37.720
Now this insect with all the thorns in it comes in

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:43.884
and sleeps on the corona of that lotus very beautifully

00:16:44.084 --> 00:16:50.540
and in the night the lotus covers it, so it doesn’t feel the cold.

00:17:07.278 --> 00:17:13.159
So the man with the money, or man with the wealth,

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:20.401
is not a Lakshmi Pati, he is not the one who has the blessings of the Lakshmi.

00:17:26.995 --> 00:17:31.532
But the man with wisdom and who has money,

00:17:31.732 --> 00:17:37.834
we can call has got the blessings of the Lakshmi.

00:17:45.696 --> 00:17:53.904
So like the lotus is so hospitable, so anxious to get guests

00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:59.582
in his own being and to look after.

00:18:09.256 --> 00:18:14.520
In the same way a person who has money,

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.293
who is supposed to be blessed by Lakshmi

00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:27.426
should be the same hospitable, of the same hospitable personality.

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:39.041
But the surprising thing is all those nations today

00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:45.486
who look to be affluent have been parasites.

00:18:52.216 --> 00:18:57.468
They looted all the countries.

00:18:57.669 --> 00:19:01.597
They formed empires.

00:19:01.797 --> 00:19:05.776
They formed empires.

00:19:05.976 --> 00:19:10.745
Like in India now as you know we had for three hundred years

00:19:10.945 --> 00:19:16.924
the English, the British three hundred years as our guests.

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:26.977
Without any visa, without any immigration, they came.

00:19:27.177 --> 00:19:32.152
Without any visa, without any immigration.

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:41.323
But now if an Indian has to go to England, is impossible situation.

00:19:46.358 --> 00:19:50.267
And those who go there also are treated

00:19:50.467 --> 00:19:58.580
not on the same level as they treat their own people.

00:20:08.411 --> 00:20:11.949
Same with America.

00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:14.426
Thank God Columbus was coming to India

00:20:14.626 --> 00:20:21.462
and I think Shri Hanumana took him down to America, thank God.

00:20:31.207 --> 00:20:39.327
Otherwise all the Indians would have been finished and I would not have been here.

00:20:43.415 --> 00:20:47.161
They killed all the Indians there, all the Indians

00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:53.387
and took away all their lands, all their lands.

00:20:53.988 --> 00:21:00.965
They took away all their lands and all the indians...

00:21:04.366 --> 00:21:08.608
And now they are supposed to be rich.

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:16.510
And the sins they have committed have to come back on them, isn’t it.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.701
And you can’t go to America easily

00:21:24.902 --> 00:21:29.013
as if that is their own land.

00:21:35.687 --> 00:21:40.734
All of them do not belong to that land.

00:21:45.534 --> 00:21:51.037
Then we can see about the people who think they are higher races

00:21:51.237 --> 00:21:55.756
because they can make more money.

00:22:01.178 --> 00:22:05.117
I mean they have killed people in gas chambers, did all kinds of things.

00:22:05.318 --> 00:22:10.697
How are they higher race? I can’t understand.

00:22:16.012 --> 00:22:21.262
Is that the sign of being higher?

00:22:24.367 --> 00:22:31.948
For us if Christ is the symbol of higher personality,

00:22:32.148 --> 00:22:37.308
then what were His qualities?

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:46.522
He was the noblest man you could think of,

00:22:46.928 --> 00:22:51.083
Noblest man you could think of.

00:22:53.892 --> 00:23:01.470
The greatest personality as far as morals are concerned.

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:06.227
Greatest personality as far as morals are concerned.

00:23:06.428 --> 00:23:08.756
You seat here, I think it looks better.

00:23:08.957 --> 00:23:12.111
Better, better here.

00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:20.604
Greatest personality as far as morality is concerned.

00:23:22.456 --> 00:23:30.537
And such forgiveness, such magnanimity, such glory.

00:23:36.728 --> 00:23:42.657
He would, was the One who was blessed with Lakshmi.

00:23:47.379 --> 00:23:51.499
He was a satisfied soul.

00:23:51.699 --> 00:23:55.046
He would not do anything wrong, whatever money you might give Him.

00:23:55.246 --> 00:23:59.996
Nobody could purchase Him.

00:24:03.828 --> 00:24:07.901
So after coming to Sahaja Yoga is important to know

00:24:08.101 --> 00:24:12.941
that you are blessed by Lakshmi.

00:24:18.429 --> 00:24:23.209
With the one hand She gives,

00:24:23.409 --> 00:24:30.676
She gives to others, that is Her nature, to give.

00:24:33.207 --> 00:24:36.726
Like if one door is open the air won’t come in.

00:24:36.926 --> 00:24:42.827
But if you open the other door, then only it will circulate.

00:24:50.444 --> 00:24:56.642
So to be satisfied is one of the qualities of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:59.673 --> 00:25:06.333
Some of them do ask for money miracles.

00:25:10.185 --> 00:25:16.784
That’s not the way your attitude should be.

00:25:16.984 --> 00:25:20.784
You are now the Spirits.

00:25:20.984 --> 00:25:24.840
And the Spirit doesn’t care for the comfort of body, mind,

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:30.823
but for the comfort of the Spirit.

00:25:36.232 --> 00:25:40.998
Many of you have become Spirits, no doubt.

00:25:43.305 --> 00:25:51.852
But you are not aware, some of you, of your own status.

00:25:55.012 --> 00:26:00.379
You have to be aware about it.

00:26:03.726 --> 00:26:08.687
With the other hand She gives protection.

00:26:11.124 --> 00:26:16.745
Protection to all those who worship Her.

00:26:19.206 --> 00:26:23.201
All those who work for Her.

00:26:25.185 --> 00:26:29.681
So anybody who has money has to give protection to people

00:26:29.881 --> 00:26:36.704
who are employed by him or working for him.

00:26:44.808 --> 00:26:49.794
We have now transcended into an area

00:26:49.995 --> 00:26:56.842
where you have no fundamentalism in your head.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:09.654
But you worship all the, all the great incarnations,

00:27:09.854 --> 00:27:17.521
all the great seers and all the prophets.

00:27:23.273 --> 00:27:27.641
Most of them did not have any money,

00:27:29.182 --> 00:27:32.967
but they were blessed by Lakshmi,

00:27:33.167 --> 00:27:38.380
because they were satisfied soul.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:44.958
So this is the quality of a Lakshmi that She should satisfy.

00:27:48.645 --> 00:27:57.044
You know that in economics desires are not satiable in general.

00:28:01.187 --> 00:28:06.937
So what is the desire which is satiable?

00:28:09.956 --> 00:28:17.751
Is the pure desire, which is the Kundalini.

00:28:17.951 --> 00:28:21.165
When you are absolutely satisfied and you know that

00:28:21.365 --> 00:28:24.954
there is no sense in hankering after money, power

00:28:25.154 --> 00:28:29.324
and all nonsensical things,

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:41.183
then the Mahalakshmi principle is awakened within you.

00:28:44.659 --> 00:28:50.936
And this Mahalakshmi principle gives you seeking.

00:28:54.725 --> 00:29:00.229
Then you become a special category of people

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:06.376
whom William Blake has described as men of God.

00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:16.202
Then you don’t have these conditionings of your childhood,

00:29:16.402 --> 00:29:20.033
of your nationality, of your so-called outside religion,

00:29:20.233 --> 00:29:23.880
no conditioning.

00:29:30.088 --> 00:29:39.341
But you rise higher and you become the Spirit.

00:29:42.419 --> 00:29:49.648
That is the time when you understand the Lakshmi principle within you.

00:29:53.433 --> 00:30:01.636
The Lakshmi principle is that you enjoy doing for others.

00:30:07.209 --> 00:30:12.485
In collective consciousness, you want to do for others.

00:30:16.915 --> 00:30:22.762
If you are still worried about yourself only,

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.680
about your own comfort, about your own earnings,

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:33.639
about your own glory,

00:30:38.343 --> 00:30:42.205
then you go into imbalance.

00:30:44.189 --> 00:30:49.441
Lakshmi is standing on a lotus, completely balanced.

00:30:53.098 --> 00:30:58.320
Moreover She doesn’t assert,

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.292
just standing on a lotus, She doesn’t assert Her power,

00:31:02.492 --> 00:31:08.421
that She is money or She is the Goddess of money.

00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:21.659
She is absolutely contented with Herself.

00:31:24.186 --> 00:31:27.759
If you are not contented that means you don’t know yourself.

00:31:27.959 --> 00:31:32.662
You are yet a half baked Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:39.274 --> 00:31:46.230
A Sahaja Yogi is a person who is absolutely contented within himself.

00:31:51.441 --> 00:32:01.280
Because his self, his Spirit is the source of all the absolute knowledge.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:11.002
Is the source of enlightenment for your attention.

00:32:13.512 --> 00:32:17.528
And is the source of joy.

00:32:18.879 --> 00:32:23.796
Joy is not happiness and unhappiness,

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:32.034
which depends on ego,

00:32:32.234 --> 00:32:36.963
but it is absolute.

00:32:37.877 --> 00:32:45.135
So such fun, after Realization you feel

00:32:49.893 --> 00:32:57.760
that you don’t care for money, you don’t care for anything.

00:33:00.757 --> 00:33:06.725
If you have it, well and good, if you don’t have it, well and good.

00:33:10.197 --> 00:33:15.255
You are completely detached.

00:33:15.455 --> 00:33:20.437
Lastly, I’ll tell you a story of Raja Janaka,

00:33:20.637 --> 00:33:27.340
who was the father of Shri Sita, who was the wife of Shri Rama.

00:33:31.945 --> 00:33:36.640
He must have existed six thousand years back

00:33:40.823 --> 00:33:45.302
and He was a king.

00:33:45.502 --> 00:33:48.600
So He had to wear all the ornaments,

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.576
and all the dresses that a king had to wear.

00:33:59.428 --> 00:34:04.868
But all the saints of those days used to touch His feet.

00:34:09.688 --> 00:34:12.655
So one disciple of one guru said,

00:34:12.855 --> 00:34:16.312
"Why do you touch His feet after all He lives like a king,

00:34:16.512 --> 00:34:20.569
and dresses up like a king?"

00:34:28.467 --> 00:34:32.114
So he said, "You have no idea as to what He is.

00:34:32.314 --> 00:34:38.336
If He has mercy on you, He might give you Self Realization."

00:34:48.646 --> 00:34:54.400
So this disciple Nachiketa went to the king and said that,

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.868
"Sir, I have come to get my Self Realization."

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:10.246
He said, "I’m sorry, I can’t give you Self Realization, I am sorry.

00:35:13.327 --> 00:35:17.041
You can take all my property, everything,

00:35:17.241 --> 00:35:21.408
but I cannot give you Self Realization.

00:35:26.173 --> 00:35:34.574
Because yet you haven’t got that personality."

00:35:41.879 --> 00:35:47.824
So Nachiketa was disappointed and he said,

00:35:48.024 --> 00:35:55.074
"All right, Sir, I’ll wait till you are ready to test me

00:35:55.274 --> 00:36:00.253
and see if I could get Realization."

00:36:11.686 --> 00:36:19.212
So He said, "All right, let’s go and have a bath in the river."

00:36:22.923 --> 00:36:25.223
When they were having a bath,

00:36:25.423 --> 00:36:31.023
the people from the palace came and told Him, the king,

00:36:31.223 --> 00:36:35.942
that, "Sir, your palace is on fire."

00:36:45.679 --> 00:36:49.871
Still He was meditating.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.710
Then again they came and said, "Now all the people

00:36:53.910 --> 00:37:00.272
are running away from there, all your relations, all your family."

00:37:05.811 --> 00:37:08.622
Still they were meditating, He was meditating,

00:37:08.822 --> 00:37:14.220
and this Nachiketa was looking at Him.

00:37:18.004 --> 00:37:20.523
Then they said, "All the fire is coming here,

00:37:20.723 --> 00:37:24.856
now all your clothes will be burnt."

00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:28.280
they said that "All the fire is coming this side

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:34.332
and all the clothes will be burnt, your clothes."

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:42.638
Still He was meditating.

00:37:42.838 --> 00:37:47.974
But Nachiketa ran out and he picked up his clothes.

00:37:51.763 --> 00:37:55.348
Then he realized "How detached this man is

00:37:55.549 --> 00:38:01.336
about His money, about His wealth,

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:08.420
about His family.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:14.378
And look at me, I’m worried about these small things like this."

00:38:17.753 --> 00:38:23.240
"He has to dress up like that because He is a king."

00:38:26.717 --> 00:38:33.501
So he surrendered himself to Him and he got his Realization.

00:38:40.082 --> 00:38:46.265
In those days, it was very difficult to get Self Realization,

00:38:46.465 --> 00:38:50.710
even to give Self Realization.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:59.892
But these are special time, the blossom time.

00:39:01.752 --> 00:39:04.853
They call it the Last Judgment, you can call it

00:39:05.061 --> 00:39:07.611
the Resurrection Time, you can call it the Qiyamah,

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:11.147
as they call it in Koran.

00:39:21.438 --> 00:39:25.043
It is said that people will come out of their graves

00:39:25.243 --> 00:39:27.660
and will get their resurrection. I mean what is left to the graves

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:33.425
is nothing but a few stones and a few bones.

00:39:39.811 --> 00:39:45.376
No. All these souls which are dead will take their birth,

00:39:45.576 --> 00:39:52.853
take human body and take their Realization in these special times.

00:40:03.058 --> 00:40:07.843
This is a sensible thing to say.

00:40:08.043 --> 00:40:12.046
And is also happening.

00:40:13.366 --> 00:40:16.705
So now you have got your Realization

00:40:16.905 --> 00:40:20.645
because of your good deeds you did in last previous lives,

00:40:20.845 --> 00:40:25.252
as we say purva punyas.

00:40:32.317 --> 00:40:36.054
But you must respect It and you must understand

00:40:36.254 --> 00:40:40.247
what you have got is so great.

00:40:44.062 --> 00:40:49.338
You have to know you are the Spirit now.

00:40:49.538 --> 00:40:52.279
You are special people.

00:40:52.479 --> 00:40:55.740
You are going to solve the problems of your country,

00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:01.115
of your community, of your society, of your families.

00:41:06.545 --> 00:41:11.903
You’ll be solving the problem of the whole world.

00:41:12.103 --> 00:41:16.837
You are the one who are going to bring peace on this earth.

00:41:18.743 --> 00:41:26.473
You are the one who are going to create a new world of beautiful divine people.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:34.439
So have faith in yourself.

00:41:34.639 --> 00:41:38.697
This faith works very fast.

00:41:38.897 --> 00:41:43.322
Because not a false faith, is a fact.

00:41:45.181 --> 00:41:48.434
And grow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:48.634 --> 00:41:52.786
Don’t be a dwarf.

00:41:56.317 --> 00:42:01.078
I am happy to see the collectivity now in the Eastern block

00:42:01.278 --> 00:42:05.979
and also Russia,

00:42:06.179 --> 00:42:11.234
other countries which are here today.

00:42:19.151 --> 00:42:24.403
So now you are asking for the blessings of the Lakshmi.

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:32.328
So the first thing you should ask is the satisfaction.

00:42:35.227 --> 00:42:39.203
Then the generosity.

00:42:39.404 --> 00:42:42.233
A person who has the blessings of Lakshmi cannot be miserly,

00:42:42.433 --> 00:42:46.222
cannot be.

00:42:49.261 --> 00:42:55.132
He is, he is a diseased person.

00:42:55.332 --> 00:42:59.981
Trying to save money here, trying to save money there.

00:43:02.359 --> 00:43:10.313
This doesn’t exist in the mind of a person who is evolved.

00:43:15.636 --> 00:43:19.451
I am very happy I could come to Russia

00:43:19.651 --> 00:43:25.782
and that at this juncture will be able to create the atmosphere

00:43:25.982 --> 00:43:30.818
which is very good for your country.

00:43:39.095 --> 00:43:42.262
And all other people who have come from other countries

00:43:42.462 --> 00:43:48.095
also will carry this atmosphere to their own countries.

00:43:55.613 --> 00:44:01.623
Now you know that you have no karmas left.

00:44:05.084 --> 00:44:09.043
It’s all finished.

00:44:09.243 --> 00:44:15.290
And now you are beautiful, new people.

00:44:18.668 --> 00:44:23.988
The blossoming time has brought you as fruits now.

00:44:28.812 --> 00:44:31.800
So don’t pay attention to yourself, to your maladies,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.601
to your troubles.

00:44:38.148 --> 00:44:44.241
And things will improve, things will improve definitely.

00:44:47.226 --> 00:44:52.379
Somebody was telling Me they have got pain in the knee.

00:44:54.786 --> 00:44:57.880
I just felt I get so many times pain in the knee.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.593
I have pain here, because I absorb from you.

00:45:08.182 --> 00:45:12.919
But I never think about it.

00:45:13.119 --> 00:45:16.943
I never bother.

00:45:17.143 --> 00:45:21.349
Because I see My body, all right.

00:45:23.965 --> 00:45:27.044
Like this machine if it is spoiled, we should cure it,

00:45:27.245 --> 00:45:30.004
finished.

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.542
But all the time if you are thinking, "This is paining here,

00:45:36.742 --> 00:45:38.800
this is wrong, I haven’t got money,

00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:43.479
I’ve got to do this business, that business", finished.

00:45:50.566 --> 00:46:00.342
So now we have to rise into the realm of super-consciousness.

00:46:05.693 --> 00:46:15.572
I can go on speaking about everything which is so sublime, so beautiful.

00:46:22.293 --> 00:46:26.605
There are many lectures which I have given.

00:46:28.014 --> 00:46:32.639
But lectures are nothing but words.

00:46:34.694 --> 00:46:38.619
These are the web of words.

00:46:40.431 --> 00:46:44.028
So you must get out of it.

00:46:44.228 --> 00:46:49.118
You have to go beyond the mind.

00:46:49.318 --> 00:46:54.826
That’s what is My own vision.

00:46:57.099 --> 00:47:01.586
And so many have fulfilled it.

00:47:04.891 --> 00:47:08.832
I am always yours whenever you want.

00:47:09.033 --> 00:47:13.809
Whenever you want Me to come, I will come.

00:47:17.312 --> 00:47:21.976
That My love is more than My own will.

00:47:26.742 --> 00:47:32.276
But you also must love yourself and love your Self-realization.

00:47:36.026 --> 00:47:40.482
May God bless you.

00:47:44.013 --> 00:47:48.999
There is one thing we have to know that in the Nabhi resides the Lakshmi,

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.428
and you have reached the state where She is a reality within you.

00:47:52.629 --> 00:47:56.534
She is not a symbol anymore.

00:48:03.458 --> 00:48:07.407
So today after the puja,

00:48:07.607 --> 00:48:11.610
this Lakshmi principles must be awakened within you

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:21.633
and should spread all its light in the Nabhi centre.

00:48:34.709 --> 00:48:40.357
May God bless you.

00:48:44.478 --> 00:48:48.548
All have become Nirvicharya.

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:56.402
So first of all we worship Shri Ganesha.

00:48:59.496 --> 00:49:06.467
He’s the symbol, for you is the reality of innocence,

00:49:08.733 --> 00:49:14.007
of purity, of wisdom.

00:49:14.689 --> 00:49:22.103
So He was the One first created before the whole universe was created.

00:49:27.622 --> 00:49:32.836
So first we’ll worship Shri Ganesha. The children will do that worship,

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:39.180
because they are the symbol of that innocence.
