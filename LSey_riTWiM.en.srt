1
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:23,455
Today we are celebrating here a special
day called Makar Sankrant.

2
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:31,170
For the information of the foreign Sahaja
Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.

3
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:36,618
[Shri Mataji explains that She will speak
first in English then in Marathi].

4
00:00:37,357 --> 00:00:42,152
It means the day - today is the day the sun

5
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:55,056
crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn
to the Tropic of Cancer.

6
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,862
It’s a very big day for us because, now

7
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:08,305
during the summertime we have the harvest,
and we look forward to the rain

8
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:13,138
and so many things that happen in every
country.

9
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:22,439
The sun falls at right angles in this
country during the summer season,

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,243
and so we welcome the sun.

11
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:29,876
We eat something that you must have
eaten already,

12
00:01:30,077 --> 00:01:34,464
what we call as til and jaggery.

13
00:01:34,664 --> 00:01:38,742
It is to prepare your body and your mind

14
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:42,532
to give it sufficient heat to receive
the sun.

15
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:47,471
Because if you are living in the cold
season,

16
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:55,630
then all your body, mind becomes lethargic,

17
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:02,468
and you become also sometimes very lazy
about things,

18
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:06,571
in the sense that the day is so small

19
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,569
 that you cannot achieve many results.

20
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:17,060
So the body has become cold as we call it.

21
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,226
We take these things, which give us heat,

22
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:25,168
so body is prepared to receive the heat
of the sun to welcome it.

23
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:33,878
To overcome the inertia set in by the cold
weather,

24
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:42,036
and also to invigorate the body’s strength,
tune to the sun,

25
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:48,978
people take to all these ways of greeting
you,

26
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:55,140
by which they give you something that
is heat-creating in the body.

27
00:02:56,195 --> 00:03:01,865
But it has another very subtle expression,
which I find is this:

28
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:05,990
that when they give you this, they say,
“Now you take til and gul

29
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:11,164
and you say things which are sweet.”

30
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,524
Because when you are taking til and gul,

31
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:18,470
your body gets heated up, and you become
right-sided person.

32
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:23,610
When you become right-sided person
you seldom speak sweetly.

33
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:28,923
So it is a contrast that they give you
a thing to heat you up

34
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:35,117
so that your body gets heated up, but
you must speak sweetly.

35
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:40,107
(…) That’s why they say today is the day
when we start speaking very sweetly.

36
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:44,175
Even if there is some enemy or somebody
who is not friendly with you,

37
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:48,738
or there has been some misunderstanding,
this is the day we say that

38
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:53,601
“All right, take this and say something
very sweet.

39
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:56,426
Talk sweetly to each other.”

40
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:59,774
(…) Now the sun is so much respected
in this country

41
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:06,561
that in early morning time all the people
get up and say Namaskars to Surya

42
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:10,517
with all His names and do a particular
type of exercise

43
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:17,032
to show that they are completely
surrendered to the will of the Surya.

44
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:22,163
When you do that, then the ego doesn’t
come in.

45
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,711
Now the sun, when He shines here, it gives
you a feeling

46
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:32,256
that you have to be active, you have
to work very hard.

47
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:36,362
As a result of that, you might develop ego.

48
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:42,694
But when you develop ego, then it surrounds
your brain completely,

49
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:48,165
and when the brain is surrounded with ego,
you do not know which way to go.

50
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:51,919
You do not know what is right, what
is wrong.

51
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,083
You do not have any discretion and
no direction.

52
00:04:56,284 --> 00:05:00,070
You do what you please, whatever
pleases ego.

53
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,459
And this is a day when we celebrate it
in a way

54
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,044
to surrender ourselves to the Surya,
to the sun,

55
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:13,931
which is, as you know, is the residence
of Shri Lord Jesus Christ.

56
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:16,696
He resides on the sun.

57
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:22,491
So how humble He was, how humble He was
residing on the sun.

58
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:27,822
The more you live on the sun, there should 
be much more humility.

59
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:30,757
Of course, I must say in India people
are humbler.

60
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:37,493
But still, the quality of sun can make you
extremely arrogant

61
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:43,056
and very unpleasant person. This
unpleasant person

62
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:46,721
can really ruin all kinds of good
relations.

63
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:53,294
But the worst thing that happens to us
is that we lose our integration.

64
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:56,030
Because when we say harsh things to anyone,

65
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:59,235
we feel guilty, so we have another problem,

66
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:03,728
our heart feels bad, our liver feels bad,
everything is upset.

67
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:07,515
And thus we feel absolutely disintegrated.

68
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:14,585
And disintegrated is a sign of our not
evolving at all

69
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:19,147
or we should say devolving.

70
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:24,700
Disintegration is such a common thing
that we see -

71
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:32,645
in ourselves we see that we fight with
our ego.

72
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:35,462
Then we fight with our superego,

73
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:39,407
then we fight with our heart, with our
emotions,

74
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:44,102
and all the time we are fighting within
ourselves.

75
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:49,401
So at least within ourselves we should
speak sweetly on this day.

76
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:54,167
Then we can start speaking to others very,
very sweetly.

77
00:06:54,368 --> 00:07:00,072
Now some people think, to speak sweetly
is a sign of weakness.

78
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:03,710
In some countries people believe that
if you speak to someone

79
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:06,493
sweetly it is a sign of weakness.

80
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:10,027
It is the greatest strength of a Sahaja
Yogi

81
00:07:10,227 --> 00:07:13,962
to speak to others with respect,

82
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:19,819
with proper protocol, and with proper
understanding.

83
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:23,866
Now because of arrogance, people also
forget

84
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:26,314
what is their situation is,

85
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:35,720
and this indiscreet temperament gives
you no sense of direction.

86
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:39,907
You move in every direction and you don’t
know where you are going.

87
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:43,931
As long as your ego is satisfied, you go
ahead with it,

88
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:48,673
and by the time you discover that you have
really become a Humpty Dumpty,

89
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:53,149
you do not know what you have done
to yourself.

90
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:59,790
So the best way to conquer your ego is
to speak sweetly, first of all.

91
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:03,610
It’s such a small thing to be done,
but it brings you

92
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:10,702
to that synthesis of character within
yourself, first of all,

93
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:17,320
and to the synthesis of all the beautiful
principles of lives.

94
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:20,648
Like you talk to somebody sweetly,

95
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,863
the person may like you. He may tell you
something,

96
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:30,516
which he may be knowing of a very great
importance for you.

97
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:38,485
If you talk to somebody sweetly, then
you may get the peace of mind

98
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:42,115
because you have given peace to another
person.

99
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:45,548
Whatever you give to another person,
that you feel within yourself.

100
00:08:45,749 --> 00:08:48,186
But if you are quarreling with another
person,

101
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:52,856
actually, it is the reflection of your
quarrelling nature within yourself.

102
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:56,061
Today there is a big dearth, and big cry

103
00:08:56,288 --> 00:09:00,571
and big organizations working out the peace
missions.

104
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:03,964
The peace mission is within yourself.

105
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:08,627
Let us start all of us the Sahaja Yogis who
are great saints sitting here,

106
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:13,212
decide today that we are going to make
peace with ourselves and with others.

107
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:17,454
(…) Let everybody live peacefully within
themselves

108
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:21,618
and give peace to others, so that this
peace

109
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:26,449
will become a nucleus for the peace
of the world.

110
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:36,993
So your great task today is to establish
a great source of peaceful people.

111
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:40,670
We are so many Sahaja Yogis here.

112
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,620
You are sitting in complete peace and
happiness and joy,

113
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:47,087
you don’t know, you are emitting all that
peace,

114
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:52,587
channelizing it and doing it. But still,
there are some

115
00:09:52,788 --> 00:09:57,259
there are some who are suffering from
horrible ego, and with hurt ego;

116
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,390
and they are trying to do something,
which they should never do,

117
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:03,673
is to think just now.

118
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:07,806
If you are thinking just now, you will not
register what I am saying

119
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,536
because this is another quality of a person

120
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:14,054
who is ego oriented is not to register.

121
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:16,566
You may say anything you like but they
don’t hear.

122
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:19,861
They hear what they want to hear or they
don’t hear.

123
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:23,827
So this is another thing we have to today
decide,

124
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:30,548
that we’ll register things than to tell
off. Let us register.

125
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:35,126
This is a sign of a character that wants
to know;

126
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,842
wants to know more about.

127
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:44,468
The criteria of ascent is synthesis and
integration.

128
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,939
A person who is not integrated with other
Sahaja Yogi

129
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:52,277
is not a man who has ascended.

130
00:10:52,875 --> 00:11:02,120
(…) Peace is a nature or is the quality
of your Spirit.

131
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:07,442
So, once you jump onto your peace somehow

132
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:15,460
what happens that you go beyond the cause
and the effect.

133
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:18,423
You are beyond the cause and the effect.

134
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,444
So the cause disappears, and the effect
also disappears.

135
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,267
So today we all have come here

136
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:30,211
to worship the peace, the within and
the without.

137
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:34,853
(...) So today is the day I should also
not say anything

138
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:39,699
that is in any way hurting to anyone

139
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:45,694
and I am trying to make you smile and
laugh but you are so serious.

140
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:50,689
So today we decide on peace.

141
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,619
Peace with ourselves, peace with others,

142
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,532
and that is how we worship the sun,

143
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:59,427
Christ, the one who was the emblem,

144
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:08,202
who was the absolute practical symbol
of that peace.

145
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:12,267
And once you understand this, I am sure
you will try

146
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:17,274
to follow that, instead of hitting
everybody,

147
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:21,196
getting angry with everybody. Just forget
all this.

148
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:26,059
You have come here to ascend,
and your gain is your gain.

149
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,362
Your fighting is not your gain, remember 
that.

150
00:12:29,563 --> 00:12:31,517
Your quarrelling is not your gain.

151
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,383
The gain is the peace that you have
achieved,

152
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:39,132
the love that you have developed,
the compassion that you can emit,

153
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:43,901
the amount of relationship and the rapport
you can penetrate into others.

154
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:47,786
This is your gain which we have to receive
today:

155
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:54,366
a mind, a heart like a lion, and not
chicken-hearted people.

156
00:12:54,567 --> 00:13:00,284
Not people who would be angry and this,
to boast of your anger:

157
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:02,634
these days are gone, we boast of our peace,

158
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:07,235
we boast of our contentment, we boast
of our glory

159
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:12,499
and we boast of our state.

160
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:17,179
And that is the state where we are now
in the Kingdom of God.

161
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,218
May God bless you all.
