00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:14.417
Today we are going to know about the Hamsa Chakra.

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:29.477
That is the area of, between the two eyebrows,

00:00:29.678 --> 00:00:33.082
"brukutis" they have called it.

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:50.004
This one is placed at the base of the brain,

00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:58.068
which is called as Mooldar,

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:11.606
and this part is the complete controller

00:01:11.807 --> 00:01:13.836
of the whole of the base of the brain,

00:01:14.037 --> 00:01:18.037
again I say, base of the brain.

00:01:20.283 --> 00:01:23.925
And that is a part of the Visshuddhi still,

00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:33.714
which is an extremely important center

00:01:33.915 --> 00:01:38.668
as far as the human awareness is concerned,

00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:51.046
because these two nadis, Ida and Pingala,

00:01:52.762 --> 00:02:08.197
before entering into Agnya and giving, crossing each other,

00:02:09.978 --> 00:02:24.197
part of them crosses over this Chakra of Hamsa.

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:42.030
So when the ego and superego develop in our brain

00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:48.340
and cover our limbic area,

00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:51.712
from both the sides the strands

00:02:51.913 --> 00:03:03.782
which are coming out of the Visshuddhi sit on them.

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:18.334
So they also control these two institutions from outside.

00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:21.735
For example, it crosses like this,

00:03:21.936 --> 00:03:31.520
goes up like that from Hamsa, and then some strands.

00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:36.298
Then the others go up again and cross like this,

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.713
and form ego and superego.

00:03:44.407 --> 00:03:49.316
So from the back side, on top of them,

00:03:49.517 --> 00:03:53.429
these two strands go and sit.

00:03:56.787 --> 00:04:03.975
You all know that Hamsa Chakra gives you discretion,

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:06.457
but still we do not understand,

00:04:06.658 --> 00:04:10.160
what do we mean by discretion?

00:04:17.454 --> 00:04:21.355
The first and the foremost important center within us

00:04:21.556 --> 00:04:24.583
is the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:35.699
If we do not have the proper

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.201
discretion about Mooladhara Chakra,

00:04:42.733 --> 00:04:50.648
we get into wilderness, I should say,

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.963
or we open the doors of hell for ourselves.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.986
As you know, that only the Ida Nadi

00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:10.869
starts from the Mooladhara.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:21.128
That means, it's the desire,

00:05:23.245 --> 00:05:29.768
power of desire within us, starts from Mooladhara.

00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:39.131
But it's not the mental, which is the Pingala Nadi,

00:05:39.332 --> 00:05:44.792
which starts from Mooladhara. It starts higher.

00:05:49.671 --> 00:05:56.173
So to have a complete understanding about..

00:05:56.361 --> 00:05:58.964
The child is crying, please take away the child.

00:05:59.165 --> 00:06:03.377
Yesterday, again the same thing happened, this is indiscreet.

00:06:03.578 --> 00:06:06.782
Continuing with the child all the time, yesterday was the same thing.

00:06:06.983 --> 00:06:10.520
Immediately you should take out the child.

00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:14.036
In the meeting, if the child is crying, immediately take out the child.

00:06:14.237 --> 00:06:19.697
There is something wrong with the child, immediately take out the child.

00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:26.943
Again it's indiscreetion.

00:06:29.266 --> 00:06:34.573
So one thing one has to know, that

00:06:34.774 --> 00:06:37.982
Mooladhara Chakra cannot be controlled

00:06:38.183 --> 00:06:41.389
by our mental activity.

00:06:44.516 --> 00:06:52.731
But if you shift it to the mental activity

00:06:52.932 --> 00:07:02.829
then the control over Mooladhara is completely lost.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.633
Apart from whatever has happened in the West,

00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:12.887
Mooladhara Chakra is all gone

00:07:13.088 --> 00:07:17.603
into the mental activity of human beings.

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:23.084
It is so much discussed, talked.

00:07:23.285 --> 00:07:28.313
It is so much described, written down,

00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:36.027
so much read, so much put into our heads,

00:07:36.228 --> 00:07:41.749
that it has become a mental activity.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.297
So, Mooladhara doesn't act

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:49.233
spontaneously as it has to act.

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:54.423
That's why there are problems

00:07:54.624 --> 00:08:01.371
that people cannot produce children.

00:08:01.572 --> 00:08:05.974
So many become impotent very early

00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:19.423
because it is used not by the power of desire,

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:24.346
but by mental activity - a shift.

00:08:26.436 --> 00:08:30.103
Now you see the light here, is burning there

00:08:30.304 --> 00:08:37.365
because there is oil and there is a wick, it is burning.

00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:41.566
But instead of this oil, you put just water.

00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:45.302
Will it burn? It won't.

00:08:45.503 --> 00:08:54.891
Because water is not going to nourish this light.

00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:01.659
So, the more mental activity you have,

00:09:04.653 --> 00:09:12.653
your Mooladhara gets spoilt and it becomes uncontrollable.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.444
But if it is left to your desire,

00:09:22.882 --> 00:09:26.326
so it becomes spontaneous.

00:09:35.651 --> 00:09:39.770
This is a fundamental principle that is missing

00:09:39.971 --> 00:09:43.971
in the Western thinking, I think

00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:46.944
that whatever is spontaneous,

00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:51.197
they leave it to the mental activity.

00:09:55.189 --> 00:09:58.815
Wherever the mental activity is to be used,

00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:02.961
you should use mental activity and wherever

00:10:03.162 --> 00:10:07.080
your desire and emotions are to be used,

00:10:07.281 --> 00:10:12.876
you must use your desire power.

00:10:18.726 --> 00:10:24.803
Also, it is spontaneous,

00:10:25.004 --> 00:10:28.464
though it should not be an obsession.

00:10:29.025 --> 00:10:35.369
Any obsession cannot be spontaneous.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:42.925
It's just, at a moment, you have the desire. That's all.

00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:47.084
But all the time if there sits in your mind,

00:10:47.285 --> 00:10:53.975
that means you are using water to have the fire.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.298
Same about the Swadisthana Chakra.

00:11:04.473 --> 00:11:09.710
Swadisthana is for creativity. Anything you can create.

00:11:09.911 --> 00:11:11.345
You can create a sari.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.273
You can create a beautiful design, pattern.

00:11:14.474 --> 00:11:18.797
You can create a beautiful art of anything,

00:11:19.005 --> 00:11:24.664
but as soon as you put it on a mental level, it's finished.

00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:35.176
Also in the West, too much discussion is about the art.

00:11:35.377 --> 00:11:37.202
This is not art, that is not art.

00:11:37.283 --> 00:11:40.123
This should not be like this, that should not be like this.

00:11:40.204 --> 00:11:42.853
I mean, it's creativity, spontaneous.

00:11:43.054 --> 00:11:45.609
Whatever the artist wants to produce,

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:53.061
let him produce, and who are you to judge and criticize?

00:11:53.262 --> 00:11:54.696
You cannot appreciate anything

00:11:54.897 --> 00:11:58.611
unless and until it is brought to the mental level.

00:11:59.508 --> 00:12:04.611
So now, we have critics,

00:12:05.967 --> 00:12:08.562
and the artists are not spontaneous,

00:12:08.643 --> 00:12:10.466
they're afraid; they only think:

00:12:10.547 --> 00:12:13.332
"What will the critics say?"

00:12:14.747 --> 00:12:17.842
Even when I'm writing the book,

00:12:18.043 --> 00:12:20.548
when I give it to some Sahaja Yogis to read, they say:

00:12:20.749 --> 00:12:24.011
"Mother, if You write it like this, then they'll say like this."

00:12:24.212 --> 00:12:27.752
I said: "Let them say, who cares?"

00:12:30.438 --> 00:12:34.517
So then, critics should criticize

00:12:35.726 --> 00:12:38.293
and say: "This is not all right. This is not an art

00:12:38.374 --> 00:12:40.921
because this is such, this is such".

00:12:41.002 --> 00:12:45.004
So the artists are finishing, art is finishing.

00:12:45.205 --> 00:12:47.543
Now what is left are critics.

00:12:47.624 --> 00:12:50.362
So now they don't know what to do with their profession,

00:12:50.443 --> 00:12:52.346
so they are criticizing each other.

00:12:52.427 --> 00:12:56.746
So we have only critics criticizing each other.

00:12:56.947 --> 00:13:00.700
But there's no art now. What to criticize?

00:13:03.588 --> 00:13:09.193
And art has to be now made into money.

00:13:09.394 --> 00:13:13.066
So the critics must certify.

00:13:13.267 --> 00:13:19.058
It's so man-oriented, the whole programming of these critics is,

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:22.035
that it is never an art. You know, they draw one line

00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:24.088
and say: "Now this is art, all right".

00:13:24.169 --> 00:13:26.974
If the critics say that it's art you had better accept,

00:13:27.055 --> 00:13:30.855
it is an art. Now, what is so artistic about a line?

00:13:32.316 --> 00:13:37.638
Then again mental: "It's a lonely person standing there" this, that.

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:42.396
It should be spontaneous! Why to describe an art?

00:13:47.434 --> 00:13:49.717
So the mental level is so alert

00:13:49.918 --> 00:13:53.332
and is all the time trying to see things

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:56.874
according to certain norms.

00:13:58.525 --> 00:14:00.674
All these norms are created about something

00:14:00.875 --> 00:14:13.156
so spontaneous like sex, like art.

00:14:13.357 --> 00:14:18.769
All bathroom culture is decided by the brain.

00:14:20.484 --> 00:14:26.964
Nothing is spontaneous. It's such a joke, I tell you!

00:14:30.166 --> 00:14:36.577
So people become artificial. Art becomes artificial.

00:14:40.289 --> 00:14:44.410
Your Mooladhara becomes artificial.

00:14:44.611 --> 00:14:48.317
Because it's all now man-made.

00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:55.856
All the spontaneity is lost.

00:14:57.174 --> 00:15:01.914
If you see any art from any country, just watch.

00:15:02.115 --> 00:15:06.988
Why must you react to it? Just watch, as Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:07.224 --> 00:15:10.277
You should just watch

00:15:10.358 --> 00:15:13.997
and the whole thing will start flowing through.
