00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.960
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.320
When we are seeking the truth we must know&nbsp;
what we have to seek, what we have to have.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.280
There are all kinds of shops around&nbsp;
where they talk of giving you the truth.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.200
But first of all, we must&nbsp;
know what you have to achieve,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.220
what you have to get if you are seeking the truth.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.940
Many great Saints, Sufis,&nbsp;
Poets have mentioned about it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.600
that you have to seek your Spirit&nbsp;
you have to become spiritual.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.940
But nobody has been able to achieve that&nbsp;
maybe the circumstances are not like that.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:47.160
Now when we talk of truth we have to know&nbsp;
that the truth is very simple to understand.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.680
First, we must know the instrument of truth.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.900
That is you are not this body, this mind, these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:09.240
emotions, these feelings, these thoughts but&nbsp;
you are the pure Spirit, you are the pure Spirit

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.220
and that has to happen to you&nbsp;
that you become the Spirit.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.380
As our heritage has been very sadly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:29.160
we are carrying out many qualities,&nbsp;
instincts of the animal stage.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.580
And that’s why we find in people&nbsp;
having jealousies and oppression,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.180
aggression all kinds of horrible things.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.580
Also, the worst part is that man can think.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.940
And in his awareness, in his thinking,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.400
he can also justify through his&nbsp;
nationality to whatever he is doing.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.280
So it’s a blind end.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.840
Once you start justifying to whatever&nbsp;
you are doing, it’s a blind end.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.520
But there is no way, through mental exercise,&nbsp;
that you can clear out all these things.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.620
You must know that your creator has&nbsp;
already looked after your Self-Realization.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.160
He has already made arrangements within&nbsp;
you to give you your Self-knowledge.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.980
So far, you don’t know&nbsp;
yourself. That’s the main thing.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.720
They have said, “Know Thyself”. How?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.080
How do you know ourselves?&nbsp;
We don’t know what we have.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.740
We know about others but about&nbsp;
ourselves, we don’t know.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.700
And whatever we know about&nbsp;
others is also very superficial.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.680
So, now within us is placed, as I have&nbsp;
shown you, the power of Kundalini.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.700
It is called “Kundal” because&nbsp;
it is in three and half coils.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.580
And it’s a feminine, it’s a feminine Power.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.060
She is your individual Mother.&nbsp;
Everyone has an individual Mother.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:21.360
And she has tape-recorded all about you,&nbsp;
about your mistakes, about what you want,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.760
what are your aspirations.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.280
Everything this Mother has&nbsp;
recorded within herself.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.460
Now she is just waiting for the second birth.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.560
Because it is your own power, you have to get it!

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.400
Sahaja means: ‘Saha’ means with, and ‘ja’ is born.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.420
Born with you is the right, is the birthright,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.340
that you get this yoga, means&nbsp;
union with the Divine Power.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.380
Now when I say, “There is Divine Power all&nbsp;
around us and It does all the living work”,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.520
we have to just know that there is a Power.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.580
And everybody has called it by different names.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.560
Somebody has called it ‘Ruh’. Somebody&nbsp;
has called it Paramachaithanya.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.260
Somebody has called it the&nbsp;
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.320
All this has been on, but people&nbsp;
don’t know where is that Power.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.240
It is all over which does all the living work.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.360
You see the beautiful flowers here around.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.740
Now we never even think how these&nbsp;
flowers were created by Mother Earth,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:40.740
so beautifully so differently, and&nbsp;
how she has put such a beautiful show,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.240
of her kindness of her patience, of her love.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:52.800
Apart from that, if you ask a doctor,&nbsp;
“Who is the one who runs your heart?”

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.160
He will say, “It’s the autonomous nervous system”.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.100
Ask the question, “Who is the auto?”

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.020
He can’t answer. They are honest,&nbsp;
I must say, they are honest.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.320
This is what we have to know that&nbsp;
all this work, living work is done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.300
without any one of our efforts,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.720
effortlessly. And who does that work?

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:27.000
So this All-pervading Power of Divine love,&nbsp;
which you can call by any name, is around us,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:35.400
and it works out everything for us.&nbsp;
This Power knows everything about us.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:49.380
Also, It looks after us. It guides&nbsp;
us. It thinks. It organizes.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:59.400
But above all, this Power loves you.&nbsp;
It’s nothing but love and compassion.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.940
People have never known that they&nbsp;
are loved by this All-pervading Power

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.880
and when you start doing something against&nbsp;
yourself which is not love for yourself

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.220
then She punishes you in a way&nbsp;
to guide you to the proper side.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.360
Now this Power is surrounding us all through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.620
but when we talk of the ascent of&nbsp;
Kundalini it passes through six centres.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.680
You have seen there the red one is the&nbsp;
lowest one we can call it first or the seven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.100
is the Power there

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.700
it protect our morality, to&nbsp;
protect the Mother Kundalini.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:52.080
When this Power rises She passes through six&nbsp;
centres and these six centres She enlightens.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:59.640
With that enlightenment, we&nbsp;
get so many benefits because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:08.340
these centres are responsible for our physical,&nbsp;
mental, emotional, and spiritual being.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:16.800
Now imagine this power passes&nbsp;
through this thing and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.320
is the last breakthrough of our evolution.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:25.020
You have come to the human awareness I have&nbsp;
already told you what is our heritage is,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.820
no use condemning people, no use&nbsp;
condemning others or ourselves.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.300
But it is the heritage you have got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.400
and this heritage that you have got&nbsp;
troubles you troubles the whole world.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.600
So now you have to become a personality which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.400
is absolutely spiritual which is&nbsp;
superhuman being you can call it.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.680
When this Kundalini raises She&nbsp;
gives you such a lot of powers.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:59.880
First, [ talking to the Yogi: he must have&nbsp;
told them the benefits of the chakras]. Yeah.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.040
He has already told you that&nbsp;
these benefits manifest within us

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.920
and you see that we become&nbsp;
a very special personality.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:21.180
But the best part of it when you are connected to&nbsp;
this all-pervading power, you know pure knowledge.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.760
Einstein has said about it.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:31.800
Einstein has said that if you go beyond the&nbsp;
mind there is an area called torsion area

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:38.760
and if you can somehow or other touch that&nbsp;
torsion area then you get absolute knowledge.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:47.280
He himself was tired of finding&nbsp;
out the theory of relativity.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:55.080
And he was sitting in his garden after all&nbsp;
that efforts he had put in his laboratory

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.460
and suddenly he says I was&nbsp;
playing with the soap bubbles

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.900
and from somewhere unknown this&nbsp;
theory of relativity dawned upon him.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.260
He calls that unknown place as torsion area.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:17.220
This torsion area we all can touch,&nbsp;
by that you get pure knowledge.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.460
Whatever you know can be&nbsp;
verified by scientific method.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.160
Science is just a knowledge from a torsion area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.880
that people try to find&nbsp;
out and when they find out,

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.560
we think it is very research.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:42.360
There is no research it all comes from that area&nbsp;
which is pure knowledge, absolute knowledge.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.380
Our knowledge is not absolute but when you become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:57.600
I should say a Sahaja Yogi you can feel on&nbsp;
your fingertips what’s wrong with your centres,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.360
what’s wrong with the centres of others.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.680
Because you also become collectively conscious.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.000
You become collective.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:14.940
Now can you imagine if you know all that we&nbsp;
are part and parcel of one great personality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.920
how can we fight?

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.620
With him to fight, who is the other?

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.980
This finger doesn’t fight&nbsp;
with another finger, does it?

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.420
Because it is aware that they&nbsp;
are part and parcel of one body.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.960
That’s what happens to you, you become collective.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.240
And once you are collective your&nbsp;
knowledge of collective is also great.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:42.000
First of all you know about your centres&nbsp;
and you know about the centres of others.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.800
If you can correct your centres you&nbsp;
can correct the centres of others also.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:55.740
This is something such a power you have thus&nbsp;
you can get rid of your diseases easily,

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:02.220
you can get rid of your imbalances, you can get&nbsp;
rid of your schizophrenia and all those things.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.480
So many things you can get rid of and we&nbsp;
have definitely found out that it works.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:18.480
It does work. You can know yourself what’s wrong&nbsp;
with yourself and what’s wrong with others.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.020
Then you don’t condemn yourself&nbsp;
but you correct yourself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.500
and once you correct yourself you become a master.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.680
You become a master and you&nbsp;
can correct others also.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.740
Now the time has come for us&nbsp;
to rise above human awareness.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.920
Now how do we become peaceful?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.440
When you cross this centre [Agnya&nbsp;
Chakra] what happens, that,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.060
like thoughts they come to us through&nbsp;
this centre from the past and the future.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:53.280
The waves-like thoughts, one,&nbsp;
another, one another, like that.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.580
Now these thoughts, we are jumping&nbsp;
on the cusps of these thoughts.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.480
But when Kundalini rises,&nbsp;
she elongates those thoughts.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.320
And what happens to you,&nbsp;
that you come in the present.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.560
No more on the future or the past.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.880
And there you become completely silent.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:23.280
You do not react but you see everything&nbsp;
just see, so you develop a witness state.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:32.580
That is the most peaceful state by which&nbsp;
you can easily achieve the greatest joy.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.300
For example, now see there&nbsp;
is a beautiful carpet here.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.480
Now if I look at it in a normal way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.600
I would think it’s a very beautiful&nbsp;
carpet, how much it will cost,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.180
where should I go to buy&nbsp;
this, and all those things.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:50.700
If it’s mine I will be more worried is it&nbsp;
insured or not, what’s happening to the carpet.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:14:01.500
But after Realization, what happens when you look&nbsp;
at it, the joy of its creation by the artist,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.940
starts bubbling in you.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:09.120
And you jump in the ocean,&nbsp;
jump in the ocean of joy.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:15.240
Joy is not a double thing like happiness&nbsp;
and unhappiness it’s a singular.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:23.400
And once you are in that joy you enjoy&nbsp;
all those subtleties of all the creations.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.940
Nature you enjoy. Mother Earth you enjoy.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.640
You enjoy other persons and&nbsp;
such love flows within you

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.140
that all kinds of quarrels and&nbsp;
stupid things that we do finishes of.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:44.220
Now we should know this Kundalini exists in all&nbsp;
the people whether black, white, yellow, blue

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.260
any type of people skin you may have.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:54.720
Also, it exists universally in every person&nbsp;
to whatever religion, to whatever community,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.200
to whatever nation you may belong to.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.040
It’s such a universal thing&nbsp;
that exists within you.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.620
When it exists within you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:11.160
then you should that know we are all&nbsp;
just the same in front of the Divine,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.520
we are not different people we are just the same

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:22.260
and when we talk of religion also as you know&nbsp;
there are people who hate religion nowadays.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.820
Now nothing wrong with religions either but the&nbsp;
trouble is human beings who have ruined them,

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.200
have completely finished them.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.180
That’s the specialty of the human beings.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.260
If you go in a forest where&nbsp;
there has been no visitation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:42.300
of a human being it’s very clean and doesn’t smell

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.880
you find it is so well-organized.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:52.500
But in case one human being goes there immediately&nbsp;
you know there must have been a human being

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.600
because of it’s existence you find&nbsp;
lots of problems in that forest.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.420
So they have done the same thing to our religions.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:07.440
They have ruined them because they have&nbsp;
made it money-oriented or power-oriented.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.880
If you become money-oriented what&nbsp;
happens that you know very well.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.400
We have to be Spirit-oriented.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.300
Because religions are not&nbsp;
Spirit-oriented all these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.500
problems have come they are fighting in the&nbsp;
name of one god, all of them are fighting.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.580
It’s a stupid thing but it is happening.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.860
So one has to know that there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.980
no way we can live together unless and&nbsp;
until we have our Self Realization.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:42.660
Spirit is the reflection of&nbsp;
God Almighty in our hearts.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:52.380
When it is there when it shines then what&nbsp;
happens is our attention becomes enlightened.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.960
Wherever our attention goes it&nbsp;
works the spiritual powers work.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.040
This attention has been so far&nbsp;
rovering [UNCLEAR text] here and there,

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:11.040
then it is from inside the light shows&nbsp;
that the person whom you are looking,

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:18.960
the building you are looking at, all the things&nbsp;
you are looking at with a different sense of joy.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:26.340
And this attention which is enlightened&nbsp;
makes you an evolved personality.

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.460
We talk of now -a-days there is no value system,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.480
the value system has fallen down&nbsp;
all kinds of things we talk.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.340
How are we going to correct them? By what,&nbsp;
by throwing bombs are you going to correct&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:39.960
which is the way,

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.940
the way is this that we should evolve. Evolve.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:50.460
And this is what is very important&nbsp;
that we all should evolve into that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.400
higher realm about which everybody has told

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.740
that you have to know yourself.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:01.140
So the first you get self-knowledge&nbsp;
because you can feel your centres&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.340
on your fingertips you know what is wrong with you

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:10.560
and then after that, you also know&nbsp;
about others what’s wrong with them.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.260
This is a very, very important&nbsp;
thing nowadays and the time has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.840
come for thousands to get Realization.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.320
You should know that I have been&nbsp;
working for thirty years now like this

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.760
and first time I came to America&nbsp;
I was so disappointed because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.340
they were running after all kinds of false gurus.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:40.920
Because maybe they could buy their gurus&nbsp;
and when I came they told Me very frankly

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.660
that unless and until You take money&nbsp;
no American is going to believe you.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:51.570
I said this is your own power&nbsp;
how can I take money from you.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.680
How can I take money from you it’s not possible.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:00.360
It’s your own power you gain it because of your&nbsp;
own power and everything divine has to be free.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.140
What do we pay to this Mother&nbsp;
Earth which sprouts the seeds?

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.160
We don’t, it’s a living process.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.260
It’s a living process of evolution&nbsp;
and we don’t pay anything for it.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.500
But this was really surprising that they told&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.780
me I mean they sent some economics to&nbsp;
teach Me, that I must take some money.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.400
You see it’s absurd and&nbsp;
absurd things can’t be done.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:33.060
So we have to know that everything is not for&nbsp;
sale, specially the spiritual life is not.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:39.600
Anybody who takes money in the name of God, in the&nbsp;
name of religion, I must tell you, you be careful.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:50.040
Now there is a state in which you have to&nbsp;
rise and in that state the joy you feel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.060
the understanding you get

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.780
your value system changes entirely.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.140
I have seen people giving up drugs overnight.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.960
I have told some people that&nbsp;
in America I can start one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.600
organization where we could&nbsp;
remove this drug addiction.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.460
So wherever I tried they said that&nbsp;
the public will be against it.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:22.200
But why, because these people go&nbsp;
amack and they do all kinds of things.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.460
I said now I take very far fetch place&nbsp;
where they cannot come to public.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.580
But let me do this work it’s very simple.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:35.040
Overnight I have seen people give up&nbsp;
all things that are destructive to them

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.920
because in the light of the Spirit&nbsp;
you see whatever is constructive.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:46.020
And you have the Power, you have&nbsp;
the Power to adhere to that.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:50.160
It’s something so special&nbsp;
should happen to all of you.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:54.540
I wish tonight you all get Sef Realization.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.800
But after getting the Self&nbsp;
Realization little bit you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.940
have to work it out because Kundalini&nbsp;
goes back to your centres to cure you.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.280
And sometimes it does happen but&nbsp;
it’s not never lost, never lost,

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.340
but if you little bit come to our centre&nbsp;
where you don’t have to pay anything,

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:18.780
again I say again and again&nbsp;
then you can master this.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.960
Within one month’s time anybody can be a master

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:29.280
and you can give Realizations to other and do such&nbsp;
a lot of good work for yourself and for others.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:36.120
Yes, I would like you people to ask&nbsp;
Me some questions because I can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:43.860
some people have something in their&nbsp;
heads and they can’t get rid of it.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.600
So if you have any sensible questions ask Me.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:22:06.480
Yogi: Anyone would like to&nbsp;
ask a question to Shri Mataji?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.020
Yes!

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.580
Seeker:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:22.427
How long does it take to conquer these&nbsp;
different stages to be in thoughtless?

00:22:22.427 --> 00:22:27.300
Shri Mataji: There is no&nbsp;
time limit for that. Just now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.280
instantaneously you will&nbsp;
get your Self Realization.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:39.840
Instantaneously. But to grow I told you&nbsp;
at the most one month you will take.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.380
So there is no time limit. This is beyond time.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:23:10.560
Seeker: If you get your experience&nbsp;
of self-realization tonight,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.467
is it going to be permanent?

00:23:12.467 --> 00:23:16.080
Shri Mataji: Of course, it is permanent. No doubt.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:22.380
But as I told you there are problems on&nbsp;
your centres which are to be corrected

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:28.560
and then you absolutely get&nbsp;
dissolved in the ocean of love.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.080
The drop becomes the ocean.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.740
Seeker:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:55.727
If we all are part of one Spirit, then why&nbsp;
do we perceive ourselves to be individuals?

00:23:55.727 --> 00:23:58.860
Shri Mataji: In ignorance. We do it in ignorance.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:04.680
You see if our eyes are closed and&nbsp;
their darkness we can’t see anything.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:09.300
When we start walking back we jump onto&nbsp;
this person, we jump onto that person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.100
but when there is light,

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:18.660
light of knowledge then we don’t see separately.&nbsp;
That’s the difference, that’s the different state.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:27.720
I have seen, I have seen we have so many of&nbsp;
them and they come to India from all countries,

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:33.420
from all nations and I have never seen them&nbsp;
quarreling, fighting but enjoying each other.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.740
They all are, some of them are&nbsp;
very highly placed in their lives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.200
some of them ordinary, some are villagers

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:46.680
they all combined together so well&nbsp;
that all these differences go away.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:54.360
So we have to have the light first then you&nbsp;
see in the light what is the truth. All right!

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.520
Seeker:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:07.427
If everything is pure Spirit&nbsp;
then why does ignorance exist?

00:25:07.427 --> 00:25:11.160
Shri Mataji: It existed because&nbsp;
of your evolutionary process.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.600
We have to pass through all that,&nbsp;
you were not born with that.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.760
It is there in the heart. But still, the&nbsp;
light has not come into your attention.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:26.160
First, your attention has to grow up to&nbsp;
human level, and then only you can get it.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.380
Seeker: In the scriptures, it is described&nbsp;
that there are several levels of samadhi,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.527
so is this Self Realization true?

00:25:51.527 --> 00:25:53.400
Shri Mataji: Yes. Of course, it is true.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:02.440
But we cross, cross all of them so fast&nbsp;
perhaps it is a jet age for Kundalini also.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:19.680
Seeker: Can you be self-realized and&nbsp;
not realize that you are self-realized?

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:27.600
Shri Mataji: Not possible normally, but you can&nbsp;
feel on your fingertips this all-pervading power.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:34.500
You can also feel out of your fontanelle&nbsp;
bone area a cool breeze coming out of it.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:40.980
So it’s not possible that way to feel&nbsp;
that you are self-realized and you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.580
all the powers by which you can&nbsp;
raise the Kundalini of others,

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.800
you can cure people, you can help&nbsp;
people I mean so many things you can do.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.900
You become a very dynamic personality.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.780
Seeker: In many spiritual paths that&nbsp;
I have, coming to self-realization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.260
so spoken [ UNCLEAR]of in the&nbsp;
lifetime ever achieved[UNCLEAR].

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.740
Can you speak a little about what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:03.630
different about this?

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.280
Yogi: In&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.420
all the different spiritual paths&nbsp;
that she has gone to, they all talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.120
about self-realization, so how is it different?

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.900
It’s always difficult and long.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:45.780
Shri Mataji: Yes, this one is&nbsp;
the real one. What can I say now?

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:14.100
Seeker: How can you reconcile your&nbsp;
ambitions and day-to-day pursuit of life?

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:23.880
Shri Mataji: You see in the light of the&nbsp;
Spirit you see what is constructive for you.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:30.060
So also your ambitions all are&nbsp;
mental things. You don’t achieve it.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.440
You are just bothered about it, that’s&nbsp;
the trouble of the modern times also.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.060
That we want to achieve something say we want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:43.500
to buy a car we work very hard&nbsp;
save money, do this buy a car.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.600
But we are not satisfied with that either.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.040
Then we want to build a house&nbsp;
again do the same and we never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.420
satisfied and this is the basic&nbsp;
principle of modern economics.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.720
That you are never satisfied you&nbsp;
are running from one to another.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:04.560
But after this happening you become&nbsp;
satisfied person you start understanding

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:10.260
and not only by that if I say so you are&nbsp;
showered with the blessing of the Divine.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:18.480
Seeker:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.140
What is the enjoyment of life?

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.500
Shri Mataji: That you have to get it&nbsp;
and then you will know. All right.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.060
You have to just wait.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.000
What else is there somebody?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:55.140
Seeker: Keep on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.100
talking… [&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.920
UNCLEAR].

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.580
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:51.720
Dear sir, if you have to give such a big&nbsp;
lecture you better hire another hall.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.940
Thank you very much. It’s all absurd things&nbsp;
you are talking about have you meant God?

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.280
Then why do you say all these&nbsp;
things? First, of all become,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.240
become a self-realized soul then you tell Me.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:12.240
Without that how can you talk,&nbsp;
is all ignorance. All right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.860
what else?

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:34.067
Seeker: Do you get vibrations&nbsp;
whenever you do Yoga?

00:31:34.067 --> 00:31:38.520
Shri Mataji: All the time&nbsp;
you get it. All the time.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.920
Seeker: I don’t have a question but&nbsp;
I want to thank you for sharing.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.960
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:56.580
Very kind of you to say that,&nbsp;
very kind. Thank you very much.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:35.880
Seeker: As we all are normal householders is&nbsp;
there a relationship between our yoga life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.103
our sexual life, and the food we eat?

00:32:39.103 --> 00:32:40.620
Shri Mataji: Now just be seated I will tell you.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.680
The thing that happens to you&nbsp;
is within yourself. All right.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:58.860
And then you see for yourself what&nbsp;
is good for you constructive for you.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:04.260
In that married life is a normal&nbsp;
thing those who say don’t marry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.820
wear those robes and go about, is all nonsense.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:14.640
Because it is all outside. Inside&nbsp;
what happens to you is the point.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.720
You need not give up your&nbsp;
family, give up everybody,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:24.240
and become a sort of a saint walking about.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:31.380
Not at all you have to be in the family you&nbsp;
have to be in the society, you have to be there.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:37.740
Only thing is you can help all of&nbsp;
them. So these problems do not come.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:45.240
You know how far to go with&nbsp;
everything. All right. Thank you.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.427
Seeker: Asking question about&nbsp;
vegetarian and non-vegetarian food.

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:56.280
Shri Mataji: All right, this is another fad[&nbsp;
UNCLEAR] that whether to eat non-veg and all that.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.300
We shouldn’t eat any animal which&nbsp;
is bigger than us. That’s a fact.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:10.020
But it is only whatever you need you must eat.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:17.100
Supposing you need proteins have proteins, if&nbsp;
you need more carbohydrates have carbohydrates.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.900
But not so much attention on it because&nbsp;
your Kundalini looks after your health.

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:28.260
Now I’m seventy-seven years&nbsp;
old Myself so you can imagine.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.630
So you are all ready for Realization now?

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:49.080
Seekers: Yes!

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:55.860
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Very kind. Very&nbsp;
happy to see so many people in Los Angeles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.980
wanting their Self Realization.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:07.020
Really, but one thing I have to request&nbsp;
is humbly that I can’t force it on you.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:11.700
You have to ask for it. Because&nbsp;
Kundalini is your pure desire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:17.040
and if you do not have the&nbsp;
desire, I cannot force on you.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.240
I would request you in that case you can leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.960
hall but if it is pure desire&nbsp;
you can get it, no problem.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:40.800
Now what we have to do if I request you to&nbsp;
take out your shoes I hope you don’t mind.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.560
You all sensible people I tell you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.480
first time I told English that you have to&nbsp;
take out your shoes half of them walked out.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.780
Because this Mother Earth helps us.&nbsp;
That’s why we have to take out our shoes.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.340
Now be comfortable. Comfort is very important.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.380
Comfortable, absolutely be comfortable.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:32.100
Now you can put your both the legs&nbsp;
a little away from each other or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.080
you can put both the feet away from each other.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.440
As simple as that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.280
Now please put both your hands like this.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:09.840
Now to make one request to you that is very&nbsp;
important that you have to forgive everyone.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.940
Whether you forgive or don’t forgive&nbsp;
you don’t do anything normally.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:21.000
But if you don’t forgive you torture&nbsp;
yourself, so best thing is to forgive.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.860
Also, people say it is difficult but it&nbsp;
is not difficult at all. It’s just mental.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.700
You just say I forgive everyone,&nbsp;
Mother I forgive everyone.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.680
Secondly, we have to forgive ourselves also.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.140
We feel guilty for very very small small things.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:43.140
Our norms are so funny that if you put the spoon&nbsp;
from here to there you feel guilty all your life.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.500
That’s sort of a thing is not needed.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.020
You are not guilty, no have done nothing wrong.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.620
So you must have love and respect for yourselves.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:58.260
Really respect for yourselves. You&nbsp;
are now entering into the new realm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.060
of Realization and you must&nbsp;
respect yourselves for that.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.000
Please put both the hands towards Me.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.180
Please forgive, please forgive&nbsp;
yourselves and forgive others.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.040
That’s the only condition you have to do.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:25.320
Now put your left hand towards me more&nbsp;
and the right hand on top of your head.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.260
Here on the fontanelle bone area, it&nbsp;
was the soft bone in your childhood.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.380
Bend your head, would be better to help you.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:41.220
Bend your head. See for yourself if there is a&nbsp;
cool or hot breeze-like vibrations are coming out.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:58.980
Now put your right hand towards me and with&nbsp;
a left hand please see on top of your head,

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.160
not touching the head but above the head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:08.580
you see if there is a cool or hot&nbsp;
breeze-like vibrations are coming in.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.880
They are hot because you are not forgiving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:16.140
yourselves or perhaps you&nbsp;
have not forgiven others.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:22.740
So please forgive yourself and forgive&nbsp;
others also, that’s important at this time.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.320
This heat has to go away.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:43.440
Now please put both your hands like&nbsp;
this and watch Me without thinking.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.960
Just watch Me without thinking.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:01.740
Some of you will get it down below&nbsp;
so push it back like that on top,

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:10.200
if they are coming on the lower side of your&nbsp;
palms so push it back like that on your palm.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.800
Now again put them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:23.580
Now please raise both the hands towards the&nbsp;
sky and ask one of these questions three times.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.200
One question three times.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.000
The first one is Mother is this&nbsp;
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:37.620
Or else you can ask second question Mother is&nbsp;
this the all-pervading power of divine Love?

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:44.940
Or you can ask, push back your head, and&nbsp;
ask Mother is this the Paramachaitanaya?

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:49.740
Ask any one of these questions and&nbsp;
you would be amazed you will feel,

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:54.720
you feel for the first time this&nbsp;
all pervading power around us.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:06.180
Now take down your hands and put your&nbsp;
hands towards me and don’t think.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:21.240
All those who have felt cool&nbsp;
or hot breeze on the fingertips&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:28.560
or in the palm center of the palm&nbsp;
or out of the fontanelle bone area

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.260
please raise both your hands.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.020
All those who have felt. My&nbsp;
goodness, the whole of Los Angeles.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.300
May God bless you.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.320
May God bless you.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:44.040
Look at that how it has worked out spontaneously.

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:49.320
What beautiful people you are and I’m&nbsp;
very happy to meet you here really.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:55.020
May God bless you. Now you&nbsp;
keep your vibrations all right.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:59.700
Please come to the follow-up programs&nbsp;
again we are having tomorrow.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.760
Tomorrow here. Make it a point to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:10.680
because in that you will see for yourself&nbsp;
what’s is needed to establish it fully.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:19.080
It’s very important, you must understand&nbsp;
your own importance in today’s turmoil.

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:24.000
How important you are what you are capable of.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.780
So please I request you all of you to&nbsp;
come tomorrow again for the follow-up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:36.780
and you can know much more about&nbsp;
yourself and about Sahaj Yoga.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:42.360
Please just do this much for&nbsp;
tomorrow and then you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.200
know what is it to dissolve in the ocean of joy.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.520
May God bless you.
