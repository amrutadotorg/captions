1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:14,640
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,960
It is said about him, that

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,560
He is the first deity that was created on this earth

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,840
by Adi Shakti.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,400
And about his creation, you know the story.

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,480
And also you know

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,000
how an elephant´s head was attached to him.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,320
Today, I am going to tell something more subtler

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:08,200
about him, Kundalini and the Mother Earth.

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,680
He was made out of the Mother Earth,

11
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,680
with the vibrations of his Mother.

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,920
Now, the significance of Mother Earth,

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,360
we have never understood.

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,400
Now look at the Mother Earth,

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,560
She is the one who produces all kinds of

16
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,720
beautiful flowers of different fragrance,

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,880
of different nature, color, heights.

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,280
The trees are different.

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,320
Trees, when they grow up,

20
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,760
they grow in such a manner that every leaf,

21
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,040
every leaf of that tree, gets the sun.

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,760
Look at the collective sense

23
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,000
which is given to us by this Mother Earth.

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,080
We have never realized that this Mother Earth,

25
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,880
which is giving us everything that we want

26
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,640
and the sun helps the Mother Earth,

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,360
cooperates, coordinates with Her.

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,200
To go further with it, you have seen that picture

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,440
where the Kundalini is coming out of the Mother Earth,

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,120
and half of it is seen.

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,880
So what does this Kundalini do for us?

32
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,840
Or what does this Mother Earth do for us?

33
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,080
The Kundalini leaves the Mother Earth as a reflection,

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,560
and what does She do within us,

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,560
to build us up in which way?

36
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,200
So it is the primordial power

37
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,160
which is coming out of the Mother Earth.

38
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,600
Mother Earth itself acts like a Mother,

39
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
She looks after you, She gives you whatever you want,

40
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,200
and another miraculous thing is

41
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,840
that the highest tree is a coconut tree,

42
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,280
and a coconut will never fall

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,880
on any creature or any human being.

44
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,560
That means it´s all thinking,

45
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,440
all understanding, all consciousness,

46
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,760
all awareness is coming from the Mother Earth.

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,960
But we never understand.

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,800
As it is we take it for granted.

49
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,760
Now what does She do for us, for us human beings?

50
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,240
She´s the primordial power.

51
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,040
What she does is to build in us a primordial

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,840
– what we can call – restrictions

53
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,960
or primordial taboos or primordial dharmas.

54
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,280
For example, you see the steel is here.

55
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,640
It has its own dharma,

56
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,240
it cannot behave like wood.

57
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,720
Wood has its own dharma,

58
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,760
it cannot behave like silver.

59
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:06,400
They all have their dharma and they are bound in that dharma.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,360
Everything that is in the nature has its own dharma.

61
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,320
If you see the tiger, if you see the lion,

62
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,560
if you see a mongoose or if you see a snake,

63
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,040
they all have their dharma, their style, their everything.

64
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,040
It´s very surprising, how they are bound by it.

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,520
Once in Prathisthan,

66
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,360
I went from the other side to my bedroom,

67
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,000
and I saw a very big snake came out of a hole.

68
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,360
Of course I was quite away from it,

69
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,840
but it felt my vibrations and started running away.

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,480
It fell in the swimming pool and it wouldn´t come out.

71
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,000
So somebody went down and killed it

72
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,560
and brought his body up there.

73
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,040
I was surprised; it was such a big one, about six feet,

74
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,880
but it intertwined itself in a very beautiful pattern,

75
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,800
surprisingly, when it was there. Alright.

76
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,320
Then what they did, they said that, “Mother, if we leave it,

77
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,440
it will fall in the water and again it will come to life,

78
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,840
so what should we do?

79
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,400
I said “Let it be then. What do you do?"

80
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,520
They said “we burn it”. So they burned the snake.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,760
But the female of the snake came out after 10 days.

82
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,040
They said “there must be a female”,

83
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
and she was searching for him

84
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,400
when suddenly somebody saw her.

85
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,680
They killed her also, they killed her

86
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,360
and she also made the same kind of a pattern.

87
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,880
I was amazed,

88
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,800
very beautiful pattern

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,760
of the body going round, like this, like this, like this.

90
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,080
Exactly the same, she also made.

91
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,160
So I was surprised

92
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,880
how is it that this lady knows how

93
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,200
to copy her husband?

94
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,320
She did it, and when we burnt her,

95
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,880
she was finished of course, both of them were killed.

96
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,520
But what I felt is that animals,

97
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,960
creepers, those who creep permanently,

98
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,360
other people also, every type of animal,

99
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,160
the whole of biology I studied, I was amazed

100
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,160
that every type of animal has the exact,

101
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,360
the same sample of behavior.

102
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,880
For example, you can put the dog in the water

103
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,560
he´ll swim, but the cat may not.

104
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,800
See it´s a thing that is built in, the dharma,

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,040
what I call the primordial taboos.

106
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,000
We have in the same way, primordial taboos

107
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,800
built within us, which are dharma.

108
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,240
A human being has to be like that.

109
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,200
If he tries to be something else

110
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,160
something goes wrong with his life.

111
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,960
It´s like say if you, you have a glass,

112
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,360
you drop it on the ground, it will break, that is the dharma.

113
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,920
In the same way when human beings

114
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,960
start deviating from the line of dharma,

115
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,360
they get into trouble.

116
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,080
But it is only human beings who can do that.

117
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,840
They can only cross over these taboos, these primordial taboos,

118
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,520
and can become horrible.

119
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,920
You see a person,

120
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,000
sometimes I wonder what´s wrong with him.

121
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,840
He has a nice home, very good wife, everything,

122
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,320
then he has a keep (another woman), what is the need?

123
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,480
For a man it is primordial that he should have

124
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,280
only one wife, and she, one husband.

125
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,120
It´s a taboo, as soon as you deviate from that

126
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,920
something goes wrong.

127
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,840
Now who punishes, or who corrects or who destroys

128
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:48,720
is this primordial power which we call as Paramchaitanya.

129
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,800
If you can understand that it´s a structure.

130
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,120
Say this is the structure of this hangar,

131
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,120
now you want to break it, you can break it

132
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,920
because you are human beings,

133
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,440
but it will be broken.

134
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
As simple as that,

135
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,000
we have to understand we are human beings

136
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,400
and we cannot do things

137
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,920
which go against our dharma.

138
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,760
Now why the dharma?

139
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,840
Dharma has to be there for our ascent.

140
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,560
Now man, in his intelligence and his progressiveness

141
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,400
thinks that anything he does – what´s wrong?

142
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,040
Especially in the west, this is very common.

143
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
But I must say, for the aboriginal people,

144
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,240
or people who are,

145
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,840
I mean I don´t know if I should call Indians aboriginal or not.

146
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,000
But those people who were made aware

147
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,720
of their primordial taboos somehow.

148
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,080
As the animals know what is bad for them

149
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:21,120
and that knowledge was there with aboriginals.

150
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,120
Today we are here with Australians,

151
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,680
and in Australia aboriginals are so many

152
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,000
I was surprised, most of their words were Sanskrit.

153
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,120
So might be they might have got it from India,

154
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,680
or maybe they have gone there from India.

155
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,560
So many words they have got which are Sanskrit.

156
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,320
So I started thinking about them.

157
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,840
Normally aboriginals, say in India we have aboriginals.

158
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,360
We call them “gorn, korku, peel”.

159
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,360
We had a lady who was a maid with us,

160
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,920
Gaynabai was her name,

161
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,040
she was an excellent cook,

162
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,200
but she had her maryadas.

163
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,800
All the time, like if my father came

164
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,360
she would immediately cover her head

165
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,720
and go in the other room, to respect him.

166
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,360
Nobody told her to do that.

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,440
Their marriage system was also very surprisingly good,

168
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,920
and their relationships with the children also was very good.

169
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,560
Somehow or another in my childhood I met many of them

170
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,880
because I also had a habit of going to the jungles

171
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,040
where I used to meet them

172
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,120
and I was surprised, they would not drink

173
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,000
this I´m telling you was about 60 years back, maybe more.

174
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,000
They would not drink,

175
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,720
very “lajashi” means shame of everything.

176
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,360
A matter of, sort of prestige, for them was important.

177
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,640
They would never steal anything,

178
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,560
and I was really very impressed,

179
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,680
how these people were so dharmic,

180
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,120
so good and happy.

181
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,120
They lived in huts, they didn´t mind,

182
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,520
but they were very clean and neat people.

183
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,480
It is now changed.

184
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,800
The same people have changed so much.

185
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,720
I mean they were like sacred people, I tell you, holy people.

186
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,720
They worship Mother,

187
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,040
they worship Mother Earth, nothing else,

188
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,040
and I asked this lady “why do you worship Mother Earth?”.

189
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,640
She said “she gives us everything.

190
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,040
She is a just Mother,

191
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,640
we live in the jungles, she looks after us,

192
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,880
and she is the most conscious person,

193
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,600
she knows that we are there and she has to look after us”.

194
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:41,080
Even to take out some leaves from the trees,

195
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,040
they used to think about it.

196
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,920
But then the missionaries came,

197
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,440
they converted them,

198
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,360
they gave them skirts and blouses

199
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,720
and I don´t know what all they did.

200
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,520
But Gaynabai did not take,

201
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,600
she said “what is this?”

202
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,960
Why should I wear a dress like this

203
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,480
where the whole body is exposed?

204
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,240
No I´ll wear a sari, I can never give it up.

205
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,200
Why should I wear this kind of a useless dress?”

206
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:18,320
But when they met with these so called advanced people

207
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,000
so many of them started living like that.

208
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,720
They said “you have no freedom;

209
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,480
you are just bound by something, by someone”.

210
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,640
But actually they were bound by the sacredness,

211
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,000
by the divine understanding

212
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,760
and then they started changing.

213
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,800
She was alright, her husband was alright

214
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,240
but her son started drinking,

215
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,320
this is the beginning of the end,

216
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,560
then gambling and all other sorts of things he started.

217
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,560
Then her grandson started going to prostitutes,

218
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,920
and the idea was only that “we are free,

219
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,560
what´s wrong?”

220
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,920
Now these primordial taboos

221
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,840
are in you, built in. They are there.

222
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,920
These are existing maybe in a potential state,

223
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,880
maybe you have curbed them down,

224
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,760
maybe you have turned them out,

225
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,760
but they are there.

226
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,080
All the time they are there,

227
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,760
and that´s what we say that you are leaving the maryadas,

228
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,000
or else we say that you are insulting Shri Ganesh.

229
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,440
So when Mother created this universe,

230
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,880
first deity was Shri Ganesh.

231
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,720
Auspiciousness was created.

232
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Now, we don´t understand what is auspiciousness.

233
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,600
Auspiciousness is a complete understanding

234
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:30,800
of primordial restrictions, and also of the protocol.

235
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,080
For example, in India we all used to do that,

236
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,800
though I was in a Christian family,

237
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,360
that before touching the Mother Earth,

238
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,640
getting up from the bed,

239
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,920
we used to say “Oh Mother Earth, please forgive us

240
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,240
because we are touching you with our feet”.

241
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,040
So respect for the Mother Earth and for nature

242
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,880
is built in within us,

243
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,640
it´s part and parcel, we are part and parcel of this whole

244
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,560
we can call it whole universe.

245
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But when you get into this nonsensical idea of freedom

246
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,120
then you are leaving your Mother Earth,

247
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,680
your gravity itself reduces.

248
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,200
This Mother Earth has to teach us,

249
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,320
while we are plundering everything,

250
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,480
the ecology, their ecology – ecology people are trying.

251
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,600
Whatever is outside is also inside.

252
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,080
If you want to exploit your Mother inside,

253
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,480
or if you want to trouble your Mother inside,

254
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,960
you can also trouble this Mother Earth.

255
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:09,080
Now what has replaced our understanding is very simple,

256
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:20,840
is that we are paying more attention to money.

257
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,200
If you can cut a tree you say, to get money,

258
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,960
then it is hurting the Mother.

259
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,840
But if you are cutting the tree for beautifying her,

260
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
then she´s happy.

261
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,520
Her discretion is so great,

262
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,880
see the way she produces flowers.

263
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,680
Different, different types of flowers.

264
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,120
In different countries, different types of flowers.

265
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,760
Like I saw in my country

266
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,520
that flowers are extremely fragrant,

267
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,440
very fragrant.

268
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:08,680
And she understands so much.

269
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,200
Once I went to Australia

270
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,200
and this flower you call hibiscus,

271
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,960
it´s a red flower, it becomes pink and then red,

272
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,000
imagine it becomes first pink

273
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,920
and then gradually it becomes red.

274
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,000
Even the sunflower goes on turning its face with the sun.

275
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,800
Now how can you say there is no connection

276
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
between a sunflower and the sun?

277
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,120
Automatically it goes on changing.

278
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,520
So these hibiscus flowers are the flowers

279
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,640
which we use to worship Shri Ganesh,

280
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,000
and the program was to worship Shri Ganesh.

281
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,560
On the way I saw so many trees of hibiscus, just flowering.

282
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,360
I said “at this time so many flowers”.

283
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,200
I said “I think you´d better get these flowers for the puja”.

284
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,520
I went and when I arrived in the hall

285
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,960
all the Sahaja Yogis had got hibiscus on their own.

286
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,080
I never talked to them, just on their own.

287
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,360
They didn´t know that it is to be used for Shri Ganesh

288
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,200
but the Mother Earth herself created at that time.

289
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,480
This is the time of Shri Ganesh when you should get hibiscus.

290
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,160
It´s very remarkable

291
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,400
how the nature is so much within us

292
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,080
and how this, whatever it is within us,

293
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,840
guides outside and receives the blessings.

294
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,760
We are not something separate.

295
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,200
This Mother Earth is our home,

296
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,320
we have a home in her and she has a home within us.

297
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,680
I said today that for Shri Ganesha,

298
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,400
He had a body of the clay,

299
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,760
just ordinary clay.

300
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,520
So you can imagine,

301
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,800
if you can really think of it,

302
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
how this whole universe has created us;

303
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,960
all of it is within us

304
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,960
and when we try to hurt something,

305
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,040
then we are hurting ourselves.

306
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,200
The intelligence of Mother Earth

307
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,720
I have seen from my childhood.

308
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,400
It´s such a beautiful thing to know the nature

309
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,920
and the Mother Earth

310
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,440
that´s why all the saints, in India especially,

311
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,000
used to go and live in the forest.

312
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,280
Only in the forest you could see clearly

313
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:26,520
how this primordial bondage was absolutely obeyed,

314
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,320
absolutely obeyed, naturally by the nature.

315
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,880
For us it is difficult,

316
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,600
we are rather, “free” people.

317
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,440
So simple things, simple things like a woman

318
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,280
should be always covered properly in her body.

319
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,880
Because she respects her body,

320
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,560
she respects her chastity.

321
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,320
But if you tell this to somebody

322
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,560
they won´t listen.

323
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,520
As you see the evergreens, they are always clad,

324
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,160
no leaf falls off.

325
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,200
I call them as the females,

326
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,560
and the other trees, deciduous,

327
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,600
they do lose their leaves so I call them as men.

328
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,640
Because they are men.

329
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,240
Here it´s the other way round, I have seen.

330
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,120
If I used to go to any party

331
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,800
somehow or another they thought I was a very serene person,

332
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,640
you meet someone, immediately

333
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,720
the man will button up himself

334
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,720
and the women will open themselves.

335
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,760
I said the whole brain from here has gone to this side

336
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,560
and this one has gone this side.

337
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,440
It´s so stupid.

338
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,040
But even Mrs. Thatcher they said that she said,

339
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,000
that it is our culture that women must expose their bodies.

340
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,440
For what? Are they prostitutes or what?

341
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,440
So this craze of exposure of the body

342
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,280
has become so strong now that even in India,

343
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
it´s not on the streets or in the household,

344
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,000
but in the cinema, in films, you see women,

345
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,920
really this never happens in India.

346
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,560
What you see in the films, never happens!

347
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,680
If they start wearing dresses like that

348
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,720
so many people will throw stones at them.

349
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,000
Then all other sorts of,

350
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,280
I shouldn´t say clumpsy but very grotesque

351
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,920
things happened, like, I can´t understand

352
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,280
man having relation with man, woman having relation with woman,

353
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,440
and children, and this and that and that.

354
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,560
We didn´t know these things in India, I didn´t know.

355
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,560
Why? Why has it happened here?

356
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,160
I don´t think 50 years back they used to do that,

357
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,040
also in these countries.

358
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,720
Why have we given up our sense of shame?

359
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,760
And this kind of nonsense that has come into us.

360
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,240
I think must be some bhoots in them or badhas in them

361
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,920
or something horrible,

362
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,920
but this is something absolutely unnatural.

363
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,000
Absurd!

364
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,520
Then a married man having eyes on unmarried women

365
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,200
and unmarried men are having relations.

366
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,840
All kinds of things people do.

367
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,520
And you won´t believe, this doesn´t happen in India.

368
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,920
Really I tell you, these days it sort of spread out,

369
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,400
but I would say in good families you don´t have it.

370
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,080
Somebody told me there is AIDS in India,

371
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,640
yes because they take bath in the river.

372
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,440
If they stopped taking bath in the river this will stop.

373
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,560
I was a medical student, I have studied,

374
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,160
I came from a very open family,

375
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,320
I never knew these things,

376
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,680
that men can do such things, it´s stupid!

377
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,200
Even in the lunatic asylum in India

378
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,040
we have never heard of such reports.

379
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,520
This is absurd!!

380
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,040
You see the children.

381
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,360
The other day Guido gave me a present of a girl,

382
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,120
who was feeling shy,

383
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,120
you know, the little girl was holding her frock like this and feeling shy.

384
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:16,160
Shyness is the ornament of women.

385
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,680
Children are all shy.

386
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,160
I remember my granddaughter

387
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,560
she was once watching one magazine,

388
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,040
she was very small, two years or so.

389
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,720
So she saw one woman in a bikini or something,

390
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,040
she was hitting her, “what are you doing?”

391
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,560
She saw in the magazine.

392
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,360
My grandmother will come

393
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,880
and give you two slaps, you shut up!

394
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,920
Please wear your dresses”.

395
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,520
They would not. Children don´t like, have you noticed it.

396
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,520
I don´t know if they are advanced,

397
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,680
but normally children don´t like it, this shamelessness.

398
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,840
But the shamelessness has gone,

399
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,480
to such an extent

400
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,360
that to them keeping nude is a very great advancement.

401
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,720
This is nothing.

402
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,320
Somebody told me that he wanted to save the aboriginals

403
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,040
but they were so much,

404
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,000
so much impressed by the white skin,

405
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,400
that they accepted everything.

406
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,720
But they were even having relations

407
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,760
with their own sister, daughter, mother.

408
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,760
Competition.

409
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,480
These are the subjects,

410
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,520
it´s rather heinous to talk about,

411
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,280
and I can´t understand

412
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,040
how can a human being go to that level.

413
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,800
And at this time we have Sahaja Yoga,

414
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,920
where you have become aware, aware

415
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,200
of your natural taboos.

416
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,400
It is there, because I told you, potentially it is there,

417
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,880
it is enlightened and suddenly you have accepted.

418
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,200
I never expected so much, I tell you,

419
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,960
but you have accepted it,

420
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,600
and not only that, but you are enjoying it,

421
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,480
your practicing it.

422
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,400
You see the lives of all the great saints.

423
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,080
You can´t have something, like Diana,

424
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,200
see, they are going to call her a saint.

425
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,240
She had no maryadas.

426
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
Oh I have sympathies with her because

427
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,440
her husband tortured her or maybe something,

428
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,800
but maryadas are very important.

429
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,120
How can she be a saint?

430
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,760
Now if you become just an ordinary human being

431
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,320
who has his taboos, who understands, who is aware,

432
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,520
then they will say, “Oh what a man he was”,

433
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,760
I mean that´s what he was,

434
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,920
he was born like that,

435
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,440
so such a man is praised, in the West especially.

436
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,800
Also the other way round is that,

437
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,800
now the majority is the law.

438
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,880
If the majority is stupid,

439
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,480
then all the stupidity is regarded as great.

440
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,280
They have no brains they have no intelligence

441
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,960
to understand how can these things help;

442
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,920
alcohol for example.

443
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,640
I mean alcohol, it has done no good to anyone,

444
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,480
but alcohol, without alcohol you are no good.

445
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,240
They won´t talk to you they say that

446
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,320
unless you have alcohol you cannot talk.

447
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,840
And it is so rampant,

448
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,880
it is so much in the society

449
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,480
that all the parties I attended,

450
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,480
except for me and my husband, everybody was drinking,

451
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,000
and drinking much more than normal because it was free.

452
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,640
They are all poisons,

453
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,320
these are all poisons

454
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,920
spoiling us completely from one to another.

455
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,240
This one is a taboo now, for cigarettes,

456
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,280
imagine – why to smoke?

457
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,720
I don´t understand, like a chimney people are smoking.

458
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,560
But they have no courage to give it up now.

459
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,800
Everywhere, no smoke, no smoke, no smoke.

460
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,320
When will they start “no alcohol?”

461
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,520
Everybody sees that it´s so dangerous.

462
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,240
It is against human awareness, everybody sees it.

463
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,040
You see people falling down,

464
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,720
you see people cursing each other, fighting.

465
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,440
I tell you, if you stop this alcoholism

466
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,760
all this shamelessness will go away.

467
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,520
Because when you take alcohol your awareness is abated.

468
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,360
One alcoholic told me

469
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,920
“when I take alcohol I don´t see my sister as my sister,

470
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,760
but see her as my beloved”.

471
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,800
Well how do you do that? “Yes”.

472
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,360
But for all social status and all that you must drink.

473
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,520
Now, we don´t even understand how

474
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:29,280
our primordial taboos are completely battered

475
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,120
by the society here.

476
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,720
The simple thing is that

477
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:55,560
to understand your own self,

478
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,880
better sometimes to see the stupid people,

479
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,240
you´ll be amazed what sort of things they are doing

480
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,640
because I have seen, I used to be very amazed

481
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,320
what are they doing?

482
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,960
And then to cover it up, to cover it up,

483
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,600
they have etiquettes you know, very elite.

484
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,960
They talk in a very special manner,

485
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,280
move themselves in a very,

486
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:36,640
I should say, like a trained personality

487
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:44,640
and anybody who doesn´t do that is out of their sight.

488
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,280
They think that He lacks eliteness.

489
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:58,400
So another idea is that we have to be elite.

490
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,360
Ganesha is how made – you see that.

491
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,640
Look at him, He´s by no means elite.

492
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,040
He eats like a glutton

493
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,120
and He looks at you

494
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:34,560
as if He´s going to hit you with his mace.

495
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:45,640
For Ganesha there is no forgiveness,

496
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:52,200
when he became Christ there He developed,

497
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,320
I don´t know how it worked out,

498
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:06,360
but as Ganesha there is not at all forgiveness.

499
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,680
Don´t try to ask forgiveness from Shri Ganesha,

500
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,640
He´ll never forgive,

501
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,440
even if his mother says “now you´d better forgive”,

502
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,840
“No, that I´ll not do”.

503
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,160
He never forgives!!

504
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,200
Then only it comes to the point that the Mother has to say

505
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,320
“I forgive you”, then He can do it,

506
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,240
because one thing about Him is,

507
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,640
He´s extremely obedient to his Mother, absolutely,

508
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,000
so if the Mother has forgiven, finished.

509
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,800
But otherwise, he will never, never forgive,

510
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,520
and that´s why all kinds of these horrible diseases are here.

511
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,520
Thousands of them.

512
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:03,560
Also if you don´t respect Him then impotency can come

513
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:11,000
or AIDS and all these secret diseases that people have.

514
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:19,240
I had a very bad time with people who suffered

515
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,040
from these secret diseases,

516
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,520
because Shri Ganesha accepts my forgiveness

517
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,800
but whenever he has a chance, again He comes back!

518
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,240
Now see, they are deities with their own dharma.

519
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,160
They too have their own dharma.

520
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,560
He gives you a lot of things, he gives you

521
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,920
mainly wisdom, discretion, understanding,

522
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,560
but if you don´t obey Him, his qualities,

523
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,120
then he´s a very difficult man.

524
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,480
So to tell somebody “Don´t do it” is very difficult,

525
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,200
but the nature takes respite.

526
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,240
If you want to become patient it´s not difficult;

527
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,520
but to get you cured on the Mooladhara

528
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,920
is very, very difficult.

529
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,840
You do get cured no doubt, ultimately,

530
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:38,960
but the most difficult disease is from Mooladhara.

531
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,320
He´s a child, alright,

532
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,600
He´s an eternal child, He´s innocence,

533
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,320
despite all that He cannot forgive you

534
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,640
if you disturb your innocence.

535
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,920
Mother is just the opposite,

536
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,000
she wants to save at any cost, she wants to save people.

537
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,680
But not Ganesha,

538
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,760
Ganesha says “alright,

539
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,280
you better go to hell”

540
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,440
and hell is in our own lives here, you see,

541
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,680
those people who like drinking, smoking,

542
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,760
prostitution all this – this is all hell.

543
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,040
What else is hell?

544
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,680
And he will never save you from hell.

545
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,920
Only in your Aarti, in Marathi, of Shri Ganesha,

546
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,960
they say that at the time

547
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,400
when I am getting my realization

548
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,680
you must save me.

549
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,200
That´s the only thing they ask,

550
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,600
at the time of my resurrection you must save me.

551
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,920
It does not say that

552
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,120
at the time of my resurrection you protect me, no!

553
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,960
You save me.

554
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,680
Because he´s the one who is sitting on every chakra

555
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,480
like a vice-chancellor of the university.

556
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,320
Even if you have Vishnu on your side,

557
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,040
Mahadeva on your side,

558
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,040
but if Shri Ganesha is there sitting

559
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,800
and He says “no, not his ascent”,

560
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,320
it doesn´t work out, it´s very difficult.

561
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,920
So now I am telling you this that your children are here.

562
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,160
In these modern times

563
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,160
horrible things are happening to children.

564
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:19,160
I mean, I think the whole of this negativity is against the innocence.

565
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,760
Wherever they get the children they misuse them,

566
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,920
they teach them bad things.

567
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,920
Even the schools everything is so horrid.

568
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,280
So then we have to be careful.

569
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,520
We have to be very very careful about our children.

570
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,360
We have to guide them properly, look after them,

571
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:47,960
and let their primordial taboos should be that,

572
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:59,000
that restriction, that taboo, that is to be preserved.

573
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:04,480
So if a child does something nice, appreciate it.

574
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,000
I´m not worried about a child

575
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,600
being little bit, what you can call,

576
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,480
being a little bit mischievous, here they have to be.

577
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,080
It´s alright.

578
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:25,240
But if he takes to anything that is anti Ganesha, be careful!

579
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,040
All kinds of diseases can develop,

580
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,400
and if they are destroyed in childhood, these taboos,

581
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,560
then they are very difficult to revive.

582
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,960
Still I have always said that innocence is never lost,

583
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,480
only there are some clouds

584
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,680
which try to cover innocence

585
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,200
and we become rather ignorant about it,

586
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,080
that we have done anything wrong.

587
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,040
That is your duty.

588
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,080
Your society is horrible.

589
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,880
Next generation I don´t know where it is going to end up.

590
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,840
When I think about it I really get a fright.

591
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,760
The solution is that you have to be

592
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,320
careful about your children and their thinking

593
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:39,800
and their attitude towards Shri Ganesha.

594
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:46,760
They are special lovable things for Shri Ganesha.

595
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,240
You can´t imagine how he loves the children

596
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,120
and he´s always there to protect your children,

597
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,920
if he protects anything it is the children he protects,

598
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:07,760
and if you people really understand what I am saying now,

599
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:15,160
because if you have to cross this margin

600
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,960
of human life and spiritual life,

601
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,880
first thing is your Shri Ganesh!

602
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,240
When Kundalini rises Shri Ganesh is quiet,

603
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,960
he just supports the Kundalini to rise.

604
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,040
He´s the one who also suggests to you

605
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,440
that it´s the wrong way you are doing things.

606
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,120
He looks after you, but he´ll not forgive you.

607
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,720
It is not so difficult.

608
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,320
The way people talk

609
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,160
about their physical needs and all this nonsense,

610
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,640
even the animals don't talk like that.

611
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,880
Try to enjoy things which will give you real enjoyment.

612
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:24,240
For example flowers, nature, garden.

613
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,080
Instead of destroying this nature, try to build it up,

614
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,440
try to see how you can make it a beautiful garden,

615
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:38,480
or a beautiful place.

616
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,200
Every time I am here

617
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,560
I am thinking what should I do with this land here

618
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,760
which is very barren, how can I change it.

619
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,120
All the time there is thought

620
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:00,360
about how to make it beautiful,

621
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,320
and in that, if there is innocence,

622
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,360
no greed,

623
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,120
there is no competition,

624
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,200
there is no attachment,

625
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,360
but just to enjoy the beauty

626
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,120
of your own creation, to see how things are.

627
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,720
Out of proportion people have gone,

628
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,960
out of understanding.

629
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,520
For example, here or anywhere else in Europe

630
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,600
you are not supposed to grow anymore fruits.

631
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,080
Why? Because the price must be kept low.

632
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,040
If you have so many fruits

633
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:53,560
why don´t you send it to places where they don´t have fruits?

634
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,480
They will destroy it, finish it, but they will not do that.

635
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:09,520
So the love and feeling for others is not there,

636
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:16,160
and they destroy if something is overproduced by the Mother Earth

637
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,960
just to keep the prices high.

638
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,960
Very cruel!

639
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,040
They are very cruel still.

640
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,360
Only thinking about money, money, money, money.

641
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,360
All this happens.

642
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:40,360
So it´s still happening

643
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:46,560
and I´m sure one day will come when it will all stop.

644
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:57,080
The pubs are the best buildings in the village.

645
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:04,840
Then the way they glorify drinking

646
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,040
is the best part of it.

647
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,080
It´s all done, you see it.

648
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,360
Now only thing I would like you to have a desire

649
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:23,000
that let drinking be finished, like smoking.

650
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:29,360
If you think like that might solve a little bit.

651
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,480
I personally think

652
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:39,600
it is with drinking you develop all these perverted attitudes.

653
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:45,440
Otherwise if it´s a normal man with a normal brain

654
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,840
why should he do such things?

655
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,720
Fighting, quarrelling, killing, violence.

656
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,720
It´s impossible to understand

657
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,480
how can a normal person do such a thing.

658
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,720
Shri Ganesha gives you balance,

659
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,320
he keeps you on the proper track.

660
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,200
But if you don´t want to listen to him,

661
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,200
you are thrown away.

662
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:29,680
I hope you understand our relationship with nature,

663
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,840
with Shri Ganesha

664
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:38,800
and with our Kundalini is like,

665
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:47,120
absolutely identified with each other, absolutely.

666
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,840
If you start loving the nature

667
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:57,160
all these ideas of spoiling your innocence will be finished.

668
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,840
I used to write poetry, I´m very fond of nature,

669
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,920
but then I told myself you have to do work for Sahaja Yoga.

670
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,920
If you take to poetry they´ll all call you a poetess

671
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,120
and I don´t want to have any such position

672
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,280
to be a poetess and all that, I gave it up.

673
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,840
And I was a very good sportswoman.

674
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,800
I used to play things, I used to be first in every sort of game

675
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,960
and I had championship, this and that. I gave it up.

676
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,280
Whatever I did I used to get into it,

677
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,120
I studied medicine

678
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:39,800
I stood in the first at the whole university. I gave it up.

679
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:47,800
Why? Because I´m the Primordial Mother,

680
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,760
and I have to do the job

681
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,720
of awakening the primordial nature,

682
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,280
the dharma within human beings,

683
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,840
and that´s what I have to do

684
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,760
and nothing else.

685
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,800
But for that I don´t do anything I am “Nishkriya”

686
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,680
I don´t do anything, really I don´t do.

687
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,880
It is done by the nature.

688
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,640
Done by Shri Ganesha.

689
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,520
Vishnu, Mahesha, everybody, they are doing it.

690
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:27,520
But, then what is the relationship?

691
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:35,080
The relationship is, they are all in my body

692
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,280
and they are all bound by their own dharma,

693
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,480
and they act.

694
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,400
This is the relationship,

695
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,360
spontaneous, automatic, like a built-in relationship.

696
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,720
For example, the fan is built in

697
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,640
so as soon as you push the button it starts moving.

698
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,160
It´s like that.

699
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,720
All of them are related to me,

700
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,840
and they have a tremendous protocol,

701
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,280
tremendous respect,

702
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:15,280
that if I say anything they will not finish it.

703
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,920
You see this thing is that

704
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:24,440
very very deep thing that I am telling you,

705
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,640
that you are a human being,

706
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,240
that there is built in.

707
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,520
Within you are your dharmas

708
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,440
and if you go against your dharmas

709
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,320
then you´ll be finished.

710
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,960
They´re all built in within you,

711
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:54,040
they are all there, potentially.

712
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:00,200
I hope you´ll understand how important it is

713
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:07,040
to be aware of your restrictions within yourself.

714
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,680
So thank you very much all of you.

715
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,600
May God bless you!!
