00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:05.549
What is it?

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.029
Your attention goes to which places is the point you try to see around more

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.960
 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.579
You see first of all in meditation. You must discuss this and there are many others who can tell you [they'll] work it up and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.349
Secondly the best way you see to put your eyes on the mother Earth

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:49.349
 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.259
Concentrate on the mother Earth is the best way when you are walking

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.039
Keep your eyes on the mother Earth if somebody is talking to you keep your eyes on the mother earth you

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.360
[see] then you will absorb everything better and will be stationed better

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.879
All right

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.989
As a very good thing [to] think about that our attention should not be filtered off

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.210
gradually you will settle down

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.140
I think most of you who have come for the first time will find it a little difficult in the beginning to adjust

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.199
but gradually you will because first of all our attention goes to small small things like

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.679
have to sit on the ground or

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.359
You have to go by buses or some sort of a filthy thing you see somewhere

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.019
So the attention always goes to the defects and to the loopholes and to the filth because attention has been like that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.759
but then it starts going to the places of beauty in little little things you start seeing the beauty in little little things you start seeing the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.619
Divine and then thus the time you should know that your attention will enjoy

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.029
Everything but normally you see the attention especially the kind of attentions we have goes to [the] wrong things

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.989
What is the loophole we start judging everyone

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.219
everyone we start judging every place now see this place

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.880
If you sit here to me it is marvelous, to you it may be just made out of what disdaining business is that?

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.179
All that you will start thinking to me. It's beautiful

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.760
Because I see these beautiful

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.649
Sari spread here and the beautiful flower arrangements beautifully done

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.570
something so special and the background and everything done with such care

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.950
How did they go there [and] how do they have these things tied up its

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.939
remarkable all these things come to my mind and I start feeling very

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.650
Overjoyed that my boys have worked so hard to put all these [things] up and how nicely how they must have arranged it all these ideas

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.670
Come to my head, and I feel very elevated. I don't see the tins

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.539
I don't see anything else it is what you see where your attention goes?

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.540
So try to see something beautiful

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.950
There's so many beautiful things that one can see now where what I see is the heart of my children

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.499
The way they have done it, isn't it?

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.400
If you are [a] deep person you can see how they have spread the [Sari] sweetly how they have spread the flowers how they've done it

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.549
So the it is the attention where does it go?

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.719
When you start seeing for yourself, what is my comfort? [I] should have these I should have that then there is no job
