Talk to Ladies. Pimpri, Pune (India)
10 February 1984.

00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:15.557
For your good luck,

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.943
you should say let us say for your good luck,

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:20.515
"Saubaghya" for your good luck.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.600
Is given to the ladies, always given to the ladies.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:30.193
Because in India the women are regarded as the Shakti

00:00:30.218 --> 00:00:35.240
and women who lead a married life and

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:41.575
who have been mothers, who have been daughters

00:00:41.957 --> 00:00:47.615
and also wives and things like that are respected very much

00:00:47.637 --> 00:00:53.619
as only it is believed that only the respectable women

00:00:55.855 --> 00:01:00.843
when they exist in any country the Gods also reside there.

00:01:00.868 --> 00:01:05.620
If they are not respectable the Gods don’t reside there.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.096
See the glamour is not very much respected in India.

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:18.641
The glamorous nature is regarded as
something like a sophisticated prostitution that.

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:26.208
In India, glamour is a sign of a effect

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:34.572
or a kind of inferiority complex in a women
or maybe a cunning to be glamorous.

00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:38.415
See so its not very much respected in this country.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.018
If they find any women getting very glamorous

00:01:42.043 --> 00:01:46.006
then she’s little bit pulled down in the society

00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:50.557
and people try to pass remarks on her and make fun of her or

00:01:50.582 --> 00:01:55.937
sort of she’s brought down. Its not regarded as a very great thing

00:01:55.962 --> 00:02:00.215
but a traditional… a women has to be traditionally dressed up.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.960
As a married women she has to wear a certain ornaments.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.360
She has to wear certain things as a married women.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.564
She has to wear certain dresses as a married woman

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:20.599
and even if they become little bit deviated still
a traditional women is respected.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:30.230
So tradition is the thing that one should do and not the glamour

00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:37.421
because that’s so artificial and temporary and is
very degrading for women according to their standards .

00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:40.277
And I don’t know what are your standards are

00:02:40.302 --> 00:02:47.201
and that’s how say for example a prostitute
cannot enter into any house

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:53.323
and if  there is a glamorous women also people
avoid, men avoid such women

00:02:53.348 --> 00:02:57.211
and such women are not allowed to enter
any houses here you see.

00:02:57.236 --> 00:03:00.080
So the glamour has no value.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.640
So the attention is not so superficial but has to be deep.

00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:09.983
Of course now-a-days our modern girls are taking
to little bit this glamorous styles .

00:03:09.983 --> 00:03:14.638
who's coming trickling down little bit but
once they are married they also give up

00:03:14.663 --> 00:03:17.340
because not very much respected.

00:03:17.455 --> 00:03:23.120
There is no respect for women who are glamorous
and run after glamour.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.823
Now thank god now in England also I have seen
people are learning that

00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:40.317
also in other places people are trying to learn
how to be simple and traditional.

00:03:40.342 --> 00:03:45.918
But they are some of them are getting untraditional,

00:03:45.943 --> 00:03:48.817
simple but untraditional.

00:03:48.842 --> 00:03:55.205
That’s not regarded as something good
in a society of Sahaja I think.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.340
We should be traditionally dressed, properly dressed.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.780
Hair should be properly done.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.930
We should dress up in traditional way.

00:04:02.955 --> 00:04:07.980
I mean they would like to see you say in a Victorian gown or a

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:15.061
say a Elizabethian collars and things
like that or something like that.

00:04:15.086 --> 00:04:16.882
That is what we are.

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:21.694
I mean we wear dresses of the very
ancient times we live  what we wear

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.529
like the nath and all that is so ancient
absolutely its antiquity. I don’t know

00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:31.298
since when we have been wearing nath in our lives

00:04:31.323 --> 00:04:37.880
and that tradition we observe even today all the time.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.824
I mean whenever there is any function or anything

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.572
we try to wear a very traditional dress,

00:04:44.597 --> 00:04:49.020
men and women all especially women always wear traditional dress.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.615
It's not regarding very good not to be traditional

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.012
so one must make a difference between
a traditional dress and untraditional dress

00:04:59.037 --> 00:05:02.964
and also a glamorous dress.

00:05:03.075 --> 00:05:07.940
So the prostitutes  and their style is of course out of question.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.160
The way they dress up show off and all that is out of question.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.220
Second one the so called simple dress if it is untraditional also in Sahaja Yoga is not so much respected.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.534
The reason for that is that we have different powers within ourselves

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:28.195
and in tradition through our unconscious  we have discovered that these are the traditions,

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.433
for example my mother never made me a hole in the nose

00:05:31.442 --> 00:05:33.735
but I get always pain in the nose semics.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.518
Once a doctor also operated me for the that all.

00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:39.898
but I know this a very simple thing I have to do is to put a hole here

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:44.300
and wear something. Once I start wearing it
I know it’s all going to be alright.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.740
Most of your left Vishuddhis will be cured
as soon as I make a hole I know that.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.737
So I have to make a hole there

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:53.855
and it is so traditional in our country to have a hole in the nose

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.041
but somehow my mother thought that she should not make a hole for me.

00:05:59.066 --> 00:06:00.615
She had a hole of her own.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.700
But she didn’t make a hole for me.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.528
So that was wrong I think, she should have

00:06:05.553 --> 00:06:10.761
I’ll have to do that at this age sometime to make a hole in my nose.

00:06:11.132 --> 00:06:16.005
Its all comes out of a very deeper understanding through the unconscious

00:06:16.021 --> 00:06:18.535
that it will become traditional.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.420
Unconscious goes on giving information,

00:06:21.445 --> 00:06:26.220
people start using them then whatever is bad is discarded.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.020
Whatever is good is accepted and you start becoming traditionally understood.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:40.734
See like here men have become little untraditional, they’ll wear a kurta

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.529
and a pant or something like that.

00:06:43.554 --> 00:06:49.240
But this you can see its most unsuitable for this country to wear a pant which is tight.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.704
Now people are wearing jeans can you imagine this heat to wear jeans.

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.500
They are wearing jeans also stupid people as they are.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.205
See whatever country you live in you have traditions built in according

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.914
to the need of the country and so traditionally whatever are your dresses

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:06.313
you must wear.

00:07:06.338 --> 00:07:09.382
I like the bow tie and all that you wear is quite good.

00:07:09.407 --> 00:07:14.486
Nothing wrong in it. For a pooja if you wear that is all right.

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:21.982
So, one should differentiate.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.527
Now all these are traditions carried forward

00:07:26.552 --> 00:07:28.920
because people didn’t find anything wrong with them

00:07:28.945 --> 00:07:32.459
so these traditions have carried forward and forward and forward.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.219
And I think we are very traditional people.

00:07:35.244 --> 00:07:37.490
I think Indians are the most traditional

00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:39.588
and thanks to our women in India

00:07:39.613 --> 00:07:49.775
who have stood all the impacts of the western culture,
western education and western goodie .

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.452
We have still kept up our sarees, we have kept up our styles,

00:07:53.477 --> 00:07:57.180
we have kept up our borders, we wear our sarees the same way.

00:07:57.205 --> 00:08:01.288
They are with of course it was little tilts away

00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:05.282
but mostly we are traditional people and we have kept it

00:08:05.307 --> 00:08:07.580
which is a very good thing.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.074
And I hope you people also try to be more traditional

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:16.977
than to be pompous or something flamboyant,

00:08:17.002 --> 00:08:22.435
very symbolic or a sometimes too fashionable or glamorous.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.640
You see the glamour is the biggest curse of the west.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.031
Half of the time is spent in glamourising themselves
and men worried about their hair styles and women.

00:08:31.056 --> 00:08:37.760
And ultimately they end up with no hairstyle just disheveled hair.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.722
So that also is not good because you’ll all get bald

00:08:40.747 --> 00:08:44.688
if you do not comb your hair properly and get bald very soon
и скажут: "Почему в Сахаджа Йоге все лысые?"

00:08:44.704 --> 00:08:48.235
and then people will laugh and say how Sahaja Yogis are all bald.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.606
There must give a treat of  trick that
every Saturday must put lot of oil in your hair

00:08:53.829 --> 00:09:03.095
nicely to it and always use some sort of
conditioner you call it I don’t know,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.693
but I false it [UNCLEAR] good, I must give you the hint.

00:09:06.718 --> 00:09:13.900
And comb your hair in a way that is not untraditional.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.694
Untraditional hair are not good

00:09:16.719 --> 00:09:23.620
and untraditional hair are always attacked by bhoots.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.492
So its better to be properly combed hair

00:09:27.517 --> 00:09:30.960
and properly done hair and to be traditional

00:09:30.985 --> 00:09:35.347
and it is a tradition that a Goddess doesn’t tie her hair

00:09:35.373 --> 00:09:37.104
not supposed to tie her hair

00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:39.655
so I do not tie in your presence

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.940
but as a wife I have to tie up so I tie up my hair.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.544
That is the tradition whatever is the tradition has to be done.

00:09:47.569 --> 00:09:51.381
So whatever is bad in the tradition will drop off very soon

00:09:51.406 --> 00:09:55.280
because there are many things
which are bad but they should drop out.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:02.490
But we should not become anti-culture,
anti-tradition that is wrong.

00:10:02.696 --> 00:10:08.885
So today one of the traditions is this
that all the ladies are given this thing

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:16.480
to wish them good luck because according to
Sahaja Yoga also luck comes from the wife.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.155
If the wife has problems the husband will always have problems.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.648
If she is not alright the Lakshmi will not alright.

00:10:22.673 --> 00:10:27.318
if shes catching then the there will be problem,

00:10:27.343 --> 00:10:30.712
you will have accidents, you will have Lakshmi problems,

00:10:30.737 --> 00:10:33.850
you will have other problems headaches and this and that.

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:36.830
So the wife has to be alright and she has to be careful

00:10:36.855 --> 00:10:42.486
about being traditional about being sensible,
she has to be respectable also.

00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:45.141
She the responsibility is much more on her

00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:49.934
so to remind her of her responsibilities
and her greatness, she is alright.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.532
This is what it is.

00:10:51.557 --> 00:10:54.410
I hope you have understood though it’s a very subtle matter.

00:10:54.435 --> 00:10:56.820
But I hope I have been able to explain to you.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.333
[Sahaja Yogi’s name?] you tell them in French a little bit.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.480
You need not use this.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.493
It turns out to be useless or [its?] turns out to be against anti…

00:11:09.518 --> 00:11:12.180
anti-growth so it just drops off.

00:11:12.492 --> 00:11:26.537
Fransızca çeviri yapılıyor

00:11:32.746 --> 00:11:36.565
Like I have seen in England there are certain traditions

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.446
they are so sweet and good.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.239
Like if a lady is going up the… up the stairs,

00:11:43.264 --> 00:11:45.758
then she has to go first

00:11:45.783 --> 00:11:49.565
but if she’s coming down then the man has to walk first

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.148
so that she should not topple.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.504
Its very simple

00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:56.783
you see there is not ladies first but

00:11:56.808 --> 00:12:00.700
ladies are first just because they are to be protected.

00:12:13.681 --> 00:12:18.025
But if you carry it too much that much
somebody might say that the ladies first

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.640
now it becomes fanaticism.

00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:25.683
Tradition is suitable according to the need of growth

00:12:25.709 --> 00:12:32.200
of human beings in good well being sense.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:44.464
And it has a style which…
which is so nice and good to look at a style.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.276
But it’s not a stylishness.

00:12:54.301 --> 00:12:59.600
Its style means a… the way it is done is gracious is beautiful

00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:04.681
it’s not like a bull doing the job but it’s a lady doing the job.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.680
Like a bull does a job you see.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.340
Like a gentleness is always confused with sophistication.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:33.320
Sophistication is nonsense but gentleness is something inborn.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.780
So people who are very sophisticated
can be extremely harsh people very harsh.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.440
They say things which should never be said.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.640
I mean now we can say French.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.301
French are people who are supposed to be sophisticated,

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.560
they are very harsh people when
they talk to each other they actually

00:14:05.585 --> 00:14:09.506
all the time hit at every person.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.207
But the gentleness is such that you do things

00:14:32.232 --> 00:14:37.131
in such a manner in whole movement
of your being is in such a manner

00:14:37.156 --> 00:14:39.690
that you do not hurt anyone.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.788
But the sophistication is to impress others,

00:14:52.813 --> 00:14:55.998
you see artificial to impress some others

00:14:56.023 --> 00:14:59.525
and aggression its aggression.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:17.717
So the whole gentleness gets faden, camouflaged you see.

00:15:17.742 --> 00:15:22.424
Its hides all the harshness inside.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:39.100
While gentleness comes from your heart from your real heart.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:52.517
So I would see that you people before
you return back to your respective countries

00:15:52.542 --> 00:15:55.726
try to see the difference

00:15:56.988 --> 00:16:02.348
between the reality and artificiality.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.600
And how much time we waste in being artificial.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.240
There is no need in Sahaja Yoga to be artificial.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:36.140
There is no need to show off or
some people even don’t talk and show off.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.091
There are ways and methods people have developed
very sophisticated method in the West

00:16:48.116 --> 00:16:55.017
of impressing others with their idea of superiority.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:14.273
Frivolousness gives you an ego
but the sophistication gives you such a solid ego

00:17:14.298 --> 00:17:17.924
that it’s impossible to do .

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.476
No no…you see if there’s frivolousness it gives you ego

00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:29.416
but it if it is sophisticated behavior

00:17:29.441 --> 00:17:33.746
then it is such a solid ego its just like solid stone.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.620
Now as we have separated from ourselves,
we should be able to see all these things.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.249
You are no more now French, English or Indians,

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:59.955
you are all Yogis and you are in the realm of God’s domain.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.617
So we have to see what reality is and we have to accept on.

00:18:04.642 --> 00:18:09.684
we are accepting reality and the tradition that is good.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.040
May God Bless you all.
