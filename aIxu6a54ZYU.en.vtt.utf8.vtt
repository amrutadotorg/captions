WEBVTT

00:12.879 --> 00:22.550
in the West we have become very speedy

00:18.099 --> 00:36.460
no doubt and to bring down the spell

00:22.550 --> 00:36.460
speed we have to use meditative process

00:37.870 --> 00:43.870
that we feel our peace within ourselves

00:48.220 --> 01:03.300
also the thoughts are bombarding our

00:52.330 --> 01:03.300
minds and we react very fast

01:06.920 --> 01:23.240
to others and to these thoughts so one

01:14.750 --> 01:27.729
has to be aware one has to be knowing

01:23.240 --> 01:27.729
what is happening within yourself that

01:31.060 --> 01:44.119
the thoughts are bombarding you you are

01:36.440 --> 01:53.929
trying to ascend and you find it very

01:44.119 --> 01:59.840
difficult to get rid of the thoughts the

01:53.929 --> 02:02.899
thought process can start by your

01:59.840 --> 02:05.380
conditioning or by your ego only two

02:02.899 --> 02:05.380
problems

02:11.760 --> 02:18.360
and you are the one who is under the

02:15.940 --> 02:18.360
challenge

02:22.650 --> 02:30.840
so you have got these simple people in

02:25.409 --> 02:39.599
the village who start watching

02:30.840 --> 02:43.920
everything but they do not react if you

02:39.599 --> 02:51.959
do not react then your thoughts will

02:43.920 --> 02:58.340
give up so the first thing should be to

02:51.959 --> 02:58.340
watch yourself that you are not reacting

02:59.959 --> 03:11.280
but you are are experiencing and

03:03.690 --> 03:17.879
enjoying the silence the subtleties the

03:11.280 --> 03:25.590
beauty the glory of your being as well

03:17.879 --> 03:33.090
as whatever is around you don't have to

03:25.590 --> 03:37.370
force yourself to break this habit but

03:33.090 --> 03:37.370
just to be on the watch out

03:39.530 --> 03:58.010
it's not necessary to talk too much

03:42.800 --> 04:03.500
about it also not it is necessary to

03:58.010 --> 04:08.290
think about anything because supposing

04:03.500 --> 04:12.980
you see a tree soul it's a tree only

04:08.290 --> 04:15.170
what are we going to think about it and

04:12.980 --> 04:22.070
whatever we may think about it it's

04:15.170 --> 04:24.470
going to be the tree so there's no harm

04:22.070 --> 04:28.820
in appearing little bit stupid doesn't

04:24.470 --> 04:34.190
matter but this is the basic thing is

04:28.820 --> 04:41.900
that when we start analyzing we are

04:34.190 --> 04:50.960
breaking our own nerves and poisoning

04:41.900 --> 04:54.650
our own mind and brain so to watch

04:50.960 --> 05:02.870
something without analysis without

04:54.650 --> 05:04.970
thinking about it is reality if you can

05:02.870 --> 05:09.440
achieve that point where you watch

05:04.970 --> 05:12.010
everything without reacting you are in

05:09.440 --> 05:12.010
relative

05:16.430 --> 05:28.639
and then only the penetration into the

05:23.870 --> 05:35.990
subtleties of your surroundings of your

05:28.639 --> 05:45.620
relationships your friendships the whole

05:35.990 --> 05:49.960
universe dance upon you so to judge

05:45.620 --> 05:56.960
others to think of others what they are

05:49.960 --> 05:59.090
doing what's wrong with them about

05:56.960 --> 06:04.130
anything whatsoever

05:59.090 --> 06:09.950
you may think is wrong he's not going to

06:04.130 --> 06:13.310
be corrected like I know some people who

06:09.950 --> 06:18.020
are specially bureaucrats they are

06:13.310 --> 06:21.770
traveling supposing by the car then they

06:18.020 --> 06:26.510
will say I think you see this road

06:21.770 --> 06:28.400
should have gone this way or I think it

06:26.510 --> 06:34.340
would have been nice if this house was

06:28.400 --> 06:39.110
facing the other way but it's not see it

06:34.340 --> 06:43.099
is not going to face it is going to be

06:39.110 --> 06:47.270
the way it is so what is the use of

06:43.099 --> 06:50.570
wasting your brain your mind your

06:47.270 --> 06:55.940
thought in suggesting thump something

06:50.570 --> 07:01.310
which doesn't work out and never going

06:55.940 --> 07:06.710
to work out either so when we start like

07:01.310 --> 07:10.900
I think these trees should have been a

07:06.710 --> 07:10.900
little taller but they are not

07:12.460 --> 07:16.260
I think

07:20.419 --> 07:33.550
that the crows should stop their noise

07:25.789 --> 07:39.409
they will not so just accept it

07:33.550 --> 07:44.180
acceptance is the way we are going to

07:39.409 --> 07:46.729
enjoy but acceptance doesn't mean

07:44.180 --> 07:52.400
tolerance because tolerance means you

07:46.729 --> 07:55.729
have to work very hard to accept that

07:52.400 --> 07:59.060
the trees are of the same height they

07:55.729 --> 08:01.129
can't grow it's too much worry and you

07:59.060 --> 08:05.199
say I have to tolerate it you see

08:01.129 --> 08:05.199
because my mind doesn't accept

08:10.279 --> 08:19.439
so acceptance as it is whatever you see

08:15.029 --> 08:21.659
acceptance and that is how people grow I

08:19.439 --> 08:25.879
have seen those who start accepting

08:21.659 --> 08:30.059
that's the sign that's the sign of their

08:25.879 --> 08:33.899
strength and their depth like the

08:30.059 --> 08:44.009
propensity of this mother earth she is

08:33.899 --> 08:52.649
what she is and she bears whatever is

08:44.009 --> 08:54.990
there if you put a heavy thing on her

08:52.649 --> 08:59.009
she'll put equal and opposite force and

08:54.990 --> 09:03.589
wear it she doesn't say I'm tolerating

08:59.009 --> 09:13.500
it I am exerting any pressure

09:03.589 --> 09:17.850
she's just accepting so the witnessing

09:13.500 --> 09:23.959
and awareness develops when we start

09:17.850 --> 09:27.410
just accepting things as they're I think

09:23.959 --> 09:27.410
don't work

09:30.470 --> 09:40.339
I think it would have been better like

09:33.050 --> 09:48.410
this doesn't work out then second

09:40.339 --> 09:55.639
problem is I like now I like to eat a

09:48.410 --> 10:02.149
cake but there is no cake what to do now

09:55.639 --> 10:05.980
whatever is there enjoy it as a cake but

10:02.149 --> 10:10.339
if you go on thinking like that I like

10:05.980 --> 10:15.319
whatever is not here you can never be

10:10.339 --> 10:23.930
happy as simple as that you have to say

10:15.319 --> 10:27.470
I like whatever is there I enjoy

10:23.930 --> 10:34.880
whatever is there there that's the

10:27.470 --> 10:47.149
reality whatever doesn't exist if you

10:34.880 --> 10:50.569
like it so what can anybody do about it

10:47.149 --> 10:58.939
works out in so many ways in so many

10:50.569 --> 11:00.740
facets in life that advantage is taken

10:58.939 --> 11:03.470
by people because we become so

11:00.740 --> 11:08.569
vulnerable to our likes and dislikes

11:03.470 --> 11:10.610
that the enterpreneur take over and they

11:08.569 --> 11:15.649
create likes and dislikes in our heads

11:10.610 --> 11:18.740
and put ideas every day I've seen it now

11:15.649 --> 11:22.910
how they do it through television

11:18.740 --> 11:28.819
through newspaper there is that so then

11:22.910 --> 11:33.290
you say now I like this but from where

11:28.819 --> 11:37.269
this liking has come is the conditioning

11:33.290 --> 11:37.269
which is put into her head

11:40.020 --> 11:46.710
so you are a slave of that condition I

11:49.470 --> 12:04.480
only like roses and I don't like any

11:56.680 --> 12:15.060
other flower why why you don't like any

12:04.480 --> 12:15.060
other flower and for such things

12:15.300 --> 12:31.500
whatever we have we miss the joy so the

12:24.190 --> 12:31.500
second part should be that enjoyability

12:34.550 --> 12:49.550
why am I here it's not a very

12:42.890 --> 13:02.990
comfortable place by any chance so why

12:49.550 --> 13:07.910
am I here to enjoy each other to enjoy

13:02.990 --> 13:11.510
your own being the more divergence you

13:07.910 --> 13:16.910
have outside appealing to your ego and

13:11.510 --> 13:30.790
conditioning the more your mind is busy

13:16.910 --> 13:30.790
with that then you cannot enjoy anything
