00:00:00.548 --> 00:00:10.048
Modi must have told you very clearly about
how to grow in Sahaja Yog because he’s one

00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:18.758
of them who has really taken very positive
step to see that he grows.

00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:25.798
Now one has to understand one simple point
about realisation is that, just mere awakening

00:00:25.798 --> 00:00:32.118
of the Kundalini is not sufficient, that’s
just the beginning.

00:00:32.118 --> 00:00:41.307
You get your realisation but you must become
the tree, you have to grow, you have to become.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:49.768
If you cannot grow then you have not achieved
what you wanted to be.

00:00:49.768 --> 00:01:01.818
And you grow very fast, very fast with meditation
and with understanding about meditation.

00:01:01.818 --> 00:01:10.568
Now one of the few hurdles that we have, that
I’ve seen it, that are innately built in

00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:13.168
Sahaja Yog itself.

00:01:13.168 --> 00:01:18.558
One of them is that you get it spontaneously
so easily that you take it for granted.

00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:21.388
This is in the pattern of it, only innately
built.

00:01:21.388 --> 00:01:27.748
You see what ever you get so easily you just
take it for granted.

00:01:27.748 --> 00:01:33.858
But the another side of it is like that, that
when you have your eyes you don’t know the

00:01:33.858 --> 00:01:36.438
value of your eyes, you take it for granted.

00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:40.678
But when you don’t have them then you know
the value of eyes, it’s like that.

00:01:40.678 --> 00:01:47.948
So when you lose vibrations and when you get
out of Sahaja Yog, then you start feeling

00:01:47.948 --> 00:01:56.217
much more lost and then you come back to Sahaja
Yoga again.

00:01:56.217 --> 00:02:03.237
Like a person becomes rich, he enjoys the
riches and then you make him poor then he

00:02:03.237 --> 00:02:05.618
feels it more.

00:02:05.618 --> 00:02:07.088
So this is the correcting point.

00:02:07.088 --> 00:02:15.728
But it is very true that Sahaja has this thing
innately built in its self that it all happens

00:02:15.728 --> 00:02:23.097
very spontaneously and you get it for doing
nothing at all.

00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:34.457
So, may be so many of you may lose it because
you might find that it is just you got it

00:02:34.457 --> 00:02:35.457
because of something.

00:02:35.457 --> 00:02:40.888
I’ve also known of people they get vibrations
and they say, “Now it’s all right I don’t

00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:42.688
need Sahaja Yoga, I am on my own."

00:02:42.688 --> 00:02:48.847
Again they’re back like bad pennies with
some troubles and some problems and then they

00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:49.847
go out.

00:02:49.847 --> 00:02:56.679
Now I would say that Modi is one of those
first twelve people who got realisation, after

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:01.877
two years I’ve worked on them, while you
got realisation in such a short time.

00:03:01.877 --> 00:03:09.218
Two years I’ve worked on twenty five people
out of which twelve got realisation you can

00:03:09.218 --> 00:03:14.438
imagine, two years! As I’ve told you in
London I’ve worked on six people for four

00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:19.517
years to give them realisation.

00:03:19.517 --> 00:03:27.288
But once a certain number of people of particular
ideologies of permutations and combinations,

00:03:27.288 --> 00:03:34.207
once they get realisation I find the rate
of realisation increases very fast.

00:03:34.207 --> 00:03:39.988
Like formally we never use to have anybody
in the program who has been to any other Guru,

00:03:39.988 --> 00:03:41.478
just avoid them.

00:03:41.478 --> 00:03:47.928
Even up to the point that this Modi himself
used to tell people there’s no program today,

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:49.228
no program.

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:52.638
And they would ring Me up and find out that
there was a program and why they were not

00:03:52.638 --> 00:03:53.638
allowed.

00:03:53.638 --> 00:03:55.078
They said “Mother we get headaches you see.

00:03:55.078 --> 00:03:59.678
They break our necks and they just disturb
us and they are good for nothing."

00:03:59.678 --> 00:04:05.578
But now, it’s very different, once we have
built up our strength of collectivity we have

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:09.908
so many channels, things are working out very
differently.

00:04:09.908 --> 00:04:17.378
So the value that Modi would attach to his
realisation is much more than you would attach

00:04:17.378 --> 00:04:19.098
normally.

00:04:19.098 --> 00:04:29.128
Because as you see, first even say to have
a ordinary oil lamp was a problem.

00:04:29.128 --> 00:04:32.278
So the oil lamp was very important for people.

00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:37.198
They would see to it that they would not use
out all the oil and they were so careful.

00:04:37.198 --> 00:04:41.418
But today we have no problem, we have got
electricity we take it for granted.

00:04:41.418 --> 00:04:46.208
Only when the electricity goes off we know
what is electricity is.

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:55.938
In the same way your realisation also, when
it is lost you understand the value of it.

00:04:55.938 --> 00:05:02.468
But supposing you have just touched it and
then you lose it, then you do not understand.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:08.008
But if you’ve got it you’ve enjoyed it
then you lose it then you want it back again,

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:14.028
so best thing is to be steadily moving towards
your evolution.

00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:20.598
Now after I go away that’s the fears people
have here that people start doubting.

00:05:20.598 --> 00:05:23.868
They said, “It happened with people they
started doubting."

00:05:23.868 --> 00:05:25.838
Doubting what?

00:05:25.838 --> 00:05:30.428
Your doubting yourself is the main point is.

00:05:30.428 --> 00:05:34.218
You cannot believe that you can get realisation.

00:05:34.218 --> 00:05:36.958
This is the basic.

00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:45.988
You see to Me, it seems that you feel that
how can you get realisation?

00:05:45.988 --> 00:05:52.988
Only those who are very highly realised souls
know that you are realised, they know that

00:05:52.988 --> 00:05:57.378
you have been given realisation, but they
also sometimes ask Me, “Why did you give

00:05:57.378 --> 00:05:58.378
them realisation.

00:05:58.378 --> 00:06:05.658
What have they done?” Because you also think,
I mean we still have to look forward to something

00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:06.978
else.

00:06:06.978 --> 00:06:09.088
How can we get realisation, this is the trouble

00:06:09.088 --> 00:06:12.078
You don’t believe in yourself.

00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:17.118
That’s what you have to have confidence
in yourself and then you’ll have confidence

00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:19.808
in Me also.

00:06:19.808 --> 00:06:24.708
Because there are so many ways, by which you
can verify.

00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:25.748
First of all

00:06:25.748 --> 00:06:37.218
you can ask questions to the photograph or
to Me in your heart, about Myself, My relationship

00:06:37.218 --> 00:06:43.558
what ever you think could be, what ever you
think, put your imagination and see that what

00:06:43.558 --> 00:06:45.488
you think I could have been.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.008
Ask that question.

00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:50.048
Your vibrations will answer.

00:06:50.048 --> 00:06:56.728
Put your, stretch your imagination to the
last, what could be the last word you could

00:06:56.728 --> 00:06:58.288
think of Me.

00:06:58.288 --> 00:07:04.568
You see, some people will put doubts saying
that, “Kundalini awakening is very difficult,

00:07:04.568 --> 00:07:06.628
it is not easy."

00:07:06.628 --> 00:07:12.568
Yes it’s true, it’s not easy, it’s a
very difficult things for human beings.

00:07:12.568 --> 00:07:15.818
You just can’t do it, is a fact.

00:07:15.818 --> 00:07:24.878
You have to work for days with some guru in
some jungle all alone, seeing nobody, working

00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:28.708
out your chakras by chakras, sometimes you
have to starve, sometimes you have to eat,

00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:32.448
sometimes you have to breathe, you have to
do all kinds of things.

00:07:32.448 --> 00:07:33.838
And then the guru can work out.

00:07:33.838 --> 00:07:44.528
But there could be someone who is somehow
the master, could be someone.

00:07:44.528 --> 00:07:50.988
Kundalini is the Holy Ghost within you.

00:07:50.988 --> 00:07:58.748
So there could be someone like that who can
do the job and that is what it is.

00:07:58.748 --> 00:08:06.298
These things put you into doubts, because
you can’t believe it.

00:08:06.298 --> 00:08:08.988
In relation to yourself you can’t believe
it.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:13.168
You can believe in God, you can believe in
Holy Ghost, you can believe in Christ but

00:08:13.168 --> 00:08:20.048
you cannot believe that it has any relationship
with you, that you could be that great, that

00:08:20.048 --> 00:08:22.978
you could get your realisation.

00:08:22.978 --> 00:08:24.888
So just feel it and enjoy it.

00:08:24.888 --> 00:08:27.178
First of all, don’t think, that’s why
I say, “Don’t think."

00:08:27.178 --> 00:08:29.619
Because as soon as you start thinking, Mr.

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:35.907
Thomas in you will get up and say that “Hello,
this cannot be Self-realisation."

00:08:35.907 --> 00:08:36.907
Mr.

00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:38.928
Thomas was great, you see.

00:08:38.928 --> 00:08:45.578
Christ had all the disciples and I find all
those types around, permutations and combinations

00:08:45.578 --> 00:08:49.568
and some how Judas also, but they’re rarely
to be found.

00:08:49.568 --> 00:08:57.988
But there are, no doubt and some are Thomas’s,
and these Thomas’ are described as murmuring

00:08:57.988 --> 00:08:59.638
souls by Christ Himself.

00:08:59.638 --> 00:09:04.388
He said, “These are murmuring souls,”
and they murmur and one murmuring soul comes

00:09:04.388 --> 00:09:09.628
to you, another murmuring soul in you joins
hands and you start all murmuring together,

00:09:09.628 --> 00:09:10.628
start thinking.

00:09:10.628 --> 00:09:15.308
Now at that time what have you to do on rational
grounds is very simple.

00:09:15.308 --> 00:09:17.888
What have I done so far?

00:09:17.888 --> 00:09:24.718
I’ve done everything, did I get cool breeze?

00:09:24.718 --> 00:09:28.578
Did I get my self realisation?

00:09:28.578 --> 00:09:32.958
Did I feel my own powers?

00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958
Have I been able to feel myself and others?

00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:42.648
Because you see your still not fully realised,
you may not be able to feel the vibrations

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:47.428
of another person, neither you will be able
to feel your own vibrations.

00:09:47.428 --> 00:09:54.268
But there are so many people here who are
realised and they can feel yours, and they

00:09:54.268 --> 00:09:55.348
can verify.

00:09:55.348 --> 00:10:01.678
Supposing they ask you, “How is your father?”

00:10:01.678 --> 00:10:05.048
There was one gentleman in England he came
and told Me, “Why is everybody asking me

00:10:05.048 --> 00:10:06.048
about my father?”

00:10:06.048 --> 00:10:10.498
I said, “Because there’s one particular
centre that’s catching,” and I called

00:10:10.498 --> 00:10:14.778
a child I said now tell Me, “What is the
centre catching?” She pointed out this one

00:10:14.778 --> 00:10:16.648
and I said, “This is the centre."

00:10:16.648 --> 00:10:19.818
Everybody is catching on this centre, this
is the father centre so they’re asking you

00:10:19.818 --> 00:10:20.928
about your father.

00:10:20.928 --> 00:10:25.078
He said, “Yes he’s dead and he died of
cancer and he had this and that,” and we

00:10:25.078 --> 00:10:26.518
had to treat him.

00:10:26.518 --> 00:10:32.678
For example anorexia is a disease can be cured
by curing this centre.

00:10:32.678 --> 00:10:40.648
It’s such a deep knowledge and it is such
an all pervading knowledge.

00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:49.058
Because once you know in a tree the sap that
goes to all the leaves and all the ends of

00:10:49.058 --> 00:10:54.109
it and if you can move the sap, your attention
can move with the sap, you can know the whole

00:10:54.109 --> 00:10:56.598
of the tree.

00:10:56.598 --> 00:11:01.698
You cannot know leaves and then know the tree.

00:11:01.698 --> 00:11:03.738
How many leaves can you count?

00:11:03.738 --> 00:11:08.878
But to know the tree the best thing is to
get to the sap.

00:11:08.878 --> 00:11:13.298
To treat a tree is best is to get to its sap,
isn’t it?

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:23.578
In the same way when you go from inside out
then you find that you know yourself and others

00:11:23.578 --> 00:11:24.578
very well.

00:11:24.578 --> 00:11:28.488
It’s very simple even small children can
do it.

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:34.748
So the first doubt comes about yourself, “Oh
this is one of them” because there’s a

00:11:34.748 --> 00:11:36.238
guru shopping going on, you see.

00:11:36.238 --> 00:11:43.517
There’s a guru shopping, there’s a float,
you go to one guru to another, to ESPs and

00:11:43.517 --> 00:11:50.898
what you call them, all sorts of things, mediums,
and all sorts of things they do with the dead

00:11:50.898 --> 00:11:52.488
bodies or anything.

00:11:52.488 --> 00:11:56.448
All these things you have been to and you
will have found it.

00:11:56.448 --> 00:12:02.468
So now suddenly you have to come to a temple,
where you don’t pay anything and you just

00:12:02.468 --> 00:12:03.468
get the blessings.

00:12:03.468 --> 00:12:09.168
So can’t believe it, you just can’t believe
it, it’s too much to believe.

00:12:09.168 --> 00:12:10.868
This is what happens you get

00:12:10.868 --> 00:12:11.868
confused.

00:12:11.868 --> 00:12:17.968
You are all ready confused, but confusion
could be over by understanding that something

00:12:17.968 --> 00:12:22.638
is happening to you just wait and see, give
it a chance.

00:12:22.638 --> 00:12:30.508
There’s no way we can bind you to Sahaja
Yoga, because there’s no mesmerism here.

00:12:30.508 --> 00:12:34.098
This is another innately a problem with Sahaja
Yoga.

00:12:34.098 --> 00:12:40.238
Second problem I should say is that you’re
too free to do what you like, absolutely free,

00:12:40.238 --> 00:12:48.438
there’s no binding force except that you
feel the love of your Mother.

00:12:48.438 --> 00:12:52.438
Supposing you are not feeling the vibrations
in your hand, there’s no way of binding

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.588
you down to Sahaja Yog, nothing.

00:12:54.588 --> 00:12:59.708
We just advise “Go ahead, it will work out,
let it work out."

00:12:59.708 --> 00:13:04.558
There is no fees, there’s no registration,
there’s no compulsion, nothing.

00:13:04.558 --> 00:13:06.948
It’s your own free will.

00:13:06.948 --> 00:13:12.488
If you want to stick on you can stick on,
if you want to go away you can go away.

00:13:12.488 --> 00:13:15.628
There’s no force on you of any kind.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:21.288
There’s no registration of your names with
some fees or anything, I mean you are not

00:13:21.288 --> 00:13:23.988
bound to pay anything.

00:13:23.988 --> 00:13:26.959
If you paid something then you feel, “All
right I’ve paid for it, so go through it

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:28.548
what ever it is, good or bad..

00:13:28.548 --> 00:13:32.708
Supposing you go to see a play and it’s
a horrid play but still you say, “All right

00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:35.318
I’ve paid for it so let me go through it."

00:13:35.318 --> 00:13:41.038
But that you cannot do with Sahaja Yog because
you’ve not paid.

00:13:41.038 --> 00:13:45.668
There’s nobody will force you down, nobody
will go on telephoning to you, “Come along,

00:13:45.668 --> 00:13:47.378
please come along,” and all that.

00:13:47.378 --> 00:13:50.777
So the attitude has to be changed, it is I
who has to gain.

00:13:50.777 --> 00:13:54.668
Say there’s a beautiful spot somewhere.

00:13:54.668 --> 00:14:00.027
Now that beautiful spot doesn’t send an
invitation card to anyone, everybody goes

00:14:00.027 --> 00:14:01.027
there.

00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:04.938
But if you have not yet discovered the beauty
of Sahaja Yog in that way and have not enjoyed

00:14:04.938 --> 00:14:08.289
it fully, you’ll have to go again and again
and see for yourself.

00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:16.418
It is a deliberation on your side not on the
side of the Sahaja Yogis or Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:16.418 --> 00:14:19.248
It’s not going to fall at your feet.

00:14:19.248 --> 00:14:25.158
That please come to Sahaja Yoga, please donate
something, nothing of the kind.

00:14:25.158 --> 00:14:31.718
If you come you are welcome, if you don’t
come, welcome.

00:14:31.718 --> 00:14:37.248
On the contrary, you will be surprised there’s
more rejection than acceptance in Sahaja Yog.

00:14:37.248 --> 00:14:38.808
That’s also innately built.

00:14:38.808 --> 00:14:42.769
I’ve seen some people who are very insincere
type they just go out from Sahaja Yoga like

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:44.398
a tangent.

00:14:44.398 --> 00:14:50.048
There was a gentleman who was very troublesome
to us in Bombay and we didn’t know what

00:14:50.048 --> 00:14:58.918
to do with him and he just got transferred
from there and we got rid of him.

00:14:58.918 --> 00:15:07.398
So you just go out of Sahaja Yoga like a tangent
and we are saved from the botheration.

00:15:07.398 --> 00:15:12.408
Because you must understand, if you have problems,
if you are not all right it’s a problem

00:15:12.408 --> 00:15:14.268
for Sahaja Yogis to correct you.

00:15:14.268 --> 00:15:20.658
It’s just the other way round, if you understand
this, then you will understand the thing,

00:15:20.658 --> 00:15:21.658
what works out.

00:15:21.658 --> 00:15:26.448
For example if I have to cure somebody it’s
a problem for Me and not the problem for the

00:15:26.448 --> 00:15:28.658
person who’s sick.

00:15:28.658 --> 00:15:36.038
Now if the tree has to grow is the problem
for the gardener not for the tree.

00:15:36.038 --> 00:15:44.858
So the tree must see to it that it co-operates
with the gardener and gets itself developed.

00:15:44.858 --> 00:15:50.918
If this understanding is developed, that it
is I who has to gain, it is I who has to go

00:15:50.918 --> 00:15:58.938
forward, Mother has not to gain from me anything,
She wants me to have all my powers manifested.

00:15:58.938 --> 00:16:06.488
She wants me to grow through it, if this attitude
is developed then you’ll work hard to grow

00:16:06.488 --> 00:16:08.728
and you’ll work it out.

00:16:08.728 --> 00:16:14.458
But on the contrary you see at the slightest
protest if you ego stands up and says, “Why,

00:16:14.458 --> 00:16:18.728
why should I do this?”

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:24.558
To overcome this hurdle you see, we have to
build up certain stages.

00:16:24.558 --> 00:16:28.718
That’s what Modi was telling Me.

00:16:28.718 --> 00:16:32.858
That you first become thoughtlessly aware,
see that silence is established.

00:16:32.858 --> 00:16:39.768
There are certain things that you do much
later, everybody is not allowed in there,

00:16:39.768 --> 00:16:47.218
because truth can be only born by people who
are strong enough to bear it.

00:16:47.218 --> 00:16:56.648
That’s why I’m not going to tell you who
am I, till you reach a certain stage, because

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.218
you cannot bear the light.

00:16:58.218 --> 00:17:00.848
That’s what happened with Christ.

00:17:00.848 --> 00:17:05.188
They crucified Him because they could not
bear Him.

00:17:05.188 --> 00:17:12.067
Human beings are like that, they can’t even
bear an incarnation of love.

00:17:12.067 --> 00:17:16.008
They can’t even bear love, it’s too much
for them.

00:17:16.008 --> 00:17:21.938
Even if you give them too much love they get
upset, they get disturbed, they just can’t

00:17:21.938 --> 00:17:22.938
bear it.

00:17:22.938 --> 00:17:27.529
So you have to build up yourself to come to
a certain stage of understanding of Sahaja

00:17:27.529 --> 00:17:28.529
Yoga.

00:17:28.529 --> 00:17:30.198
It’s a state, which you achieve.

00:17:30.198 --> 00:17:32.158
It’s a state.

00:17:32.158 --> 00:17:38.408
You are not to be certified by anyone on the...But
it’s a state where you will start giving

00:17:38.408 --> 00:17:44.927
realisation to others and the whole way you’ll
be talking you will be in a very different

00:17:44.927 --> 00:17:47.368
manner as if you are completely detached.

00:17:47.368 --> 00:17:51.028
You’ll say “It is going, it is coming."

00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:52.028
It happens.

00:17:52.028 --> 00:17:56.998
You will not say my mother must get, my father
must get, you will never say like that.

00:17:56.998 --> 00:18:04.378
Because you’ll understand that the problem
of Sahaja Yoga is that it cannot give to anyone.

00:18:04.378 --> 00:18:05.588
Like

00:18:05.588 --> 00:18:13.098
the sunshine can shine it is for the trees
to expose themselves to the sunshine and get

00:18:13.098 --> 00:18:15.598
the advantage of it.

00:18:15.598 --> 00:18:21.988
The sunshine is not going to run after you
all over to see that you get it.

00:18:21.988 --> 00:18:30.778
This is the point here, it will shine the
whole day and you take it.

00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:35.638
But it’s not that it will run after you
all the time requesting you, “Oh please

00:18:35.638 --> 00:18:40.738
get me, oh please get me, have it, have it,”
like that.

00:18:40.738 --> 00:18:50.218
And this is what one has to understand very
clearly, that it is you who has to ask for

00:18:50.218 --> 00:18:55.138
it, and not anybody is going to force on you
anything.

00:18:55.138 --> 00:19:02.108
On the contrary if anybody tries to say something
more your ego gets like that.

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:04.578
So try to be careful.

00:19:04.578 --> 00:19:10.718
I am very happy to know that also, that in
all the ego orientated societies I’ve seen

00:19:10.718 --> 00:19:13.218
that Sahaja Yoga works like wonders.

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:16.388
Because first thing they see is their colossal
ego.

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:20.888
And that’s a very positive point about it,
because once you start seeing this horrible

00:19:20.888 --> 00:19:27.498
balloon in you, you just start watching yourself
and enjoying, “Oh Mr so and now get along

00:19:27.498 --> 00:19:28.498
with your ego."

00:19:28.498 --> 00:19:31.358
You see it’s a very interesting life you
start leading.

00:19:31.358 --> 00:19:37.738
If your ego you see, is a very good sign.

00:19:37.738 --> 00:19:40.998
If you cannot see your ego then there’s
danger.

00:19:40.998 --> 00:19:44.557
But some can even see their super ego if they’re
possessed.

00:19:44.557 --> 00:19:50.778
See people see how they get possessed suddenly
because the frequency of possession becomes

00:19:50.778 --> 00:19:59.108
very little so that there’s a big gaps you
see to see the time when you are normal and

00:19:59.108 --> 00:20:04.148
when you get abnormal also you can see clearly
that you are abnormal.

00:20:04.148 --> 00:20:10.768
By seeing that you start judging, “Oh God
I have again been caught up, I’m again lost,”

00:20:10.768 --> 00:20:12.658
and you come back to normal.

00:20:12.658 --> 00:20:22.148
The whole thing becomes a very beautiful understanding
of the reality about yourself and you laugh

00:20:22.148 --> 00:20:24.268
at yourself all the time.

00:20:24.268 --> 00:20:28.998
All the time you laugh at your self and you
laugh at everything and you find the whole

00:20:28.998 --> 00:20:34.398
joke going round how people are seriously
indulging into nonsensical things and how

00:20:34.398 --> 00:20:40.808
it’s such a big joke you’ve been yourself
worrying about things which have no meaning,

00:20:40.808 --> 00:20:42.898
which has no significance.

00:20:42.898 --> 00:20:48.348
Like I went first to Paris and people told
Me, “Mother they are not going to like you

00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:54.258
very much, because they believe a person who
is so happy is ignorant.

00:20:54.258 --> 00:20:55.698
You should not be a happy person.

00:20:55.698 --> 00:20:59.047
You should be a crying baby so they’ll believe
You."

00:20:59.047 --> 00:21:04.068
They’re all les miserable, very unhappy
people, extremely unhappy and if you tell

00:21:04.068 --> 00:21:08.768
them you are a happy person so they are going
to be shocked at such a thing.

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:12.898
I said, “Really this Les Miserable, let
me (inaudible).

00:21:12.898 --> 00:21:18.588
Let Me do something about them and I made
them laugh so much at their miseries that

00:21:18.588 --> 00:21:22.927
they got all right and they understood that
the joy is just there.

00:21:22.927 --> 00:21:28.418
You have to just peep in your heart and you’ll
find the source of your joy and then the whole

00:21:28.418 --> 00:21:30.078
thing vanishes into thin air.

00:21:30.078 --> 00:21:33.568
But it has to work, it has to happen.

00:21:33.568 --> 00:21:41.638
There is no quick way of doing it in the sense
that I say, “All right you give me five

00:21:41.638 --> 00:21:45.228
rupees or five dollars, Australian dollars
and you get it."

00:21:45.228 --> 00:21:49.658
NO, no, no, no, you may give Me any amount
it won’t work out.

00:21:49.658 --> 00:21:53.118
It has not worked out with My own daughters
you’ll be surprised.

00:21:53.118 --> 00:21:55.718
I’ve never forced them or I’ve never asked
them.

00:21:55.718 --> 00:21:59.118
I’ve only two daughters they’re not realised
I’m not bothered.

00:21:59.118 --> 00:22:01.978
When they’ll ask for it they’ll get it.

00:22:01.978 --> 00:22:04.138
But My four grandchildren are born realised.

00:22:04.138 --> 00:22:09.838
And one of the eldest ones one day very seriously
said, “As it is you cannot commit mistakes

00:22:09.838 --> 00:22:17.578
I know but it would have been nice if you
have given them realisation when they were

00:22:17.578 --> 00:22:18.578
children."

00:22:18.578 --> 00:22:24.628
You see this is what it is that you cannot
force these things on anyone and you have

00:22:24.628 --> 00:22:27.468
to take a very detached view.

00:22:27.468 --> 00:22:32.888
You are a seeker, your mother and you are
there but they are not your responsibility,

00:22:32.888 --> 00:22:34.698
you can tell them about Sahaja Yog.

00:22:34.698 --> 00:22:38.677
But if they are opposing you better have,
let them be alone, they’ll come round.

00:22:38.677 --> 00:22:43.748
When they see the transformation in within
you, they’ll definitely come.

00:22:43.748 --> 00:22:45.478
So leave them alone.

00:22:45.478 --> 00:22:47.618
Don’t bother your heads.

00:22:47.618 --> 00:22:53.938
Just leave them alone and you will be amazed
that they will see you transforming so well

00:22:53.938 --> 00:23:00.138
and acting so well and they’ll change themselves
and they will come to you and ask you, “How

00:23:00.138 --> 00:23:07.568
are you so much changed and transformed?”
You see proof of the pudding is in seeing

00:23:07.568 --> 00:23:12.528
the pudding up there changing people.

00:23:12.528 --> 00:23:19.488
And this transformation you’ll be amazed
coming into you so suddenly that you will

00:23:19.488 --> 00:23:22.058
be amazed.

00:23:22.058 --> 00:23:29.188
But as I told you that on the left side is
the desire or you can say the super ego, the

00:23:29.188 --> 00:23:30.848
desire to do something.

00:23:30.848 --> 00:23:39.138
And the right side is the ego which we try
to sort of please and which feels happy and

00:23:39.138 --> 00:23:40.868
the one by which we have ambitions.

00:23:40.868 --> 00:23:45.057
But in the centre is the will power to do
this.

00:23:45.057 --> 00:23:50.848
And this will power has to be increased by
you, “I have to do it, I have to do it."

00:23:50.848 --> 00:23:52.248
First you’ll feel tired because

00:23:52.248 --> 00:23:55.938
your left heart is weak, then I will tell
you how to do it.

00:23:55.938 --> 00:23:59.358
‘Then know how to raise your left heart
if you’re tired.

00:23:59.358 --> 00:24:05.158
See most of the people these days are very
tired people.

00:24:05.158 --> 00:24:07.378
They talk, “Ah,” they sit down “Ah."

00:24:07.378 --> 00:24:11.688
They can’t, I mean they are very tired,
absolutely fagged out people.

00:24:11.688 --> 00:24:14.388
Morning till evening what have you been doing,
nothing.

00:24:14.388 --> 00:24:20.388
Just sitting in the sun you got tired, just
lazing out you got tired.

00:24:20.388 --> 00:24:22.538
Why, why did you get tired?

00:24:22.538 --> 00:24:27.598
Firstly because you’re not integrated you
are fighting with in yourself.

00:24:27.598 --> 00:24:32.598
You’re head is fighting your heart, your
heart is fighting your liver.

00:24:32.598 --> 00:24:36.758
Secondly, you are thinking and wasting your
energy.

00:24:36.758 --> 00:24:45.388
So you have to learn how to settle your heart,
what has to be done to raise your heart to

00:24:45.388 --> 00:24:50.868
make it peaceful and how to get the energy
from your spirit.

00:24:50.868 --> 00:24:55.308
Once you start doing that your tired feeling
will go away.

00:24:55.308 --> 00:25:01.388
Then your aggressiveness also will decrease
and you’ll be amazed that you will just

00:25:01.388 --> 00:25:02.667
watch the whole thing.

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:09.338
Neither you’ll aggress nor you’ll take
aggression and the whole reaction will be

00:25:09.338 --> 00:25:10.758
very different.

00:25:10.758 --> 00:25:15.868
Then everything has a meaning, your feelings
have a meaning.

00:25:15.868 --> 00:25:21.528
Supposing you have a feeling today for Poland,
which is in trouble, all of you should ask

00:25:21.528 --> 00:25:24.448
just now, “Mother solve the problem of Poland."

00:25:24.448 --> 00:25:29.738
Because I have no desires you see, I am desire
less, you have to ask and it works, you’ll

00:25:29.738 --> 00:25:34.328
be amazed because your attention is enlightened
now, it just works.

00:25:34.328 --> 00:25:36.758
You have to desire for it and it works.

00:25:36.758 --> 00:25:37.758
You have to work for it and it works.

00:25:37.758 --> 00:25:44.588
And so many miraculous things people will
tell you just believe them that’s all true.

00:25:44.588 --> 00:25:52.148
Money problem solved, because of Lakshmi Tattwa
within, financial problems solved, social

00:25:52.148 --> 00:25:57.598
problem solved, family problems solved because
you are solved.

00:25:57.598 --> 00:26:00.608
See in relation to you all everything seems
problematic.

00:26:00.608 --> 00:26:04.927
When your problems are solved everything is
solved.

00:26:04.927 --> 00:26:07.368
It’s so simple as that.

00:26:07.368 --> 00:26:12.528
We have to solve ourselves and it is solved
through the awakening of the Kundalini.

00:26:12.528 --> 00:26:17.648
Now I would like to have some questions from
you and then I would like you to go into groups

00:26:17.648 --> 00:26:24.677
with the Sahaja Yogis and talk to them on
intimate level and also you must tell Me your

00:26:24.677 --> 00:26:25.677
problems.

00:26:25.677 --> 00:26:28.427
If you have any intimate problems, you can
talk to Me also.

00:26:28.427 --> 00:26:35.358
But best is to talk to each other.
I would like Warren to see to it that he organises

00:26:35.358 --> 00:26:37.297
all these groups properly.

00:26:37.297 --> 00:26:50.968
But I would love to have some questions from
you about Sahaja Yoga now.

00:26:50.968 --> 00:26:56.058
Question: How can one laugh at abortion.

00:26:56.058 --> 00:27:02.508
He's talking about abortion, you are taking
the view that it is bad?

00:27:02.508 --> 00:27:09.988
Shri Mataji: I’m not saying you have to,
I said you are not to laugh, means you laugh

00:27:09.988 --> 00:27:13.278
at silly stupid things I meant, you see.

00:27:13.278 --> 00:27:18.748
But at abortion as I can’t understand you
see.

00:27:18.748 --> 00:27:21.088
This is a very funny situation in this country.

00:27:21.088 --> 00:27:24.268
As it is the birth rate is minus and you are
having abortions.

00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:27.868
Question: Does it exist in India much abortion

00:27:27.868 --> 00:27:31.258
Shri Mataji: Not much, people don’t like
it at all, they hate it.

00:27:31.258 --> 00:27:34.398
And you know the trouble is like this.

00:27:34.398 --> 00:27:38.398
You people are having no children so we have
to have the load on us.

00:27:38.398 --> 00:27:40.648
You see what to do?

00:27:40.648 --> 00:27:45.008
Nobody to be born here, they don’t want
to be born here because there is no love in

00:27:45.008 --> 00:27:46.698
the heart.

00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:50.807
See when the other day when somebody told
Me about the doctors here some of them are

00:27:50.807 --> 00:27:53.458
butchers I couldn’t believe it.

00:27:53.458 --> 00:27:56.728
Because in India at least, doctors are not
butchers by any chance.

00:27:56.728 --> 00:28:01.478
I was surprised; this is because everything
has become a butchery here, because the heart

00:28:01.478 --> 00:28:03.508
is covered with ego.

00:28:03.508 --> 00:28:06.078
There’s no heart left.

00:28:06.078 --> 00:28:07.698
You have to raise the heart.

00:28:07.698 --> 00:28:13.878
That’s important, once you raise the heart,
you see you cannot stand all this nonsense,

00:28:13.878 --> 00:28:14.878
you know.

00:28:14.878 --> 00:28:16.908
Why do you want to have abortion I still can’t
understand?

00:28:16.908 --> 00:28:19.648
Question: Does it affect Swadisthan charka?

00:28:19.648 --> 00:28:23.958
Shri Mataji: Oh, it affects many chakras,
I mean.

00:28:23.958 --> 00:28:30.628
There was someone I knew who always used to
catch on right heart, I must tell you this,

00:28:30.628 --> 00:28:32.878
very nice person, always on right heart.

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:40.148
His father was a good man everything was fine,
asked him, “How are you catching on right

00:28:40.148 --> 00:28:45.908
heart?” He was not married and when he came
very close to Me then he confessed to Me that,

00:28:45.908 --> 00:28:53.358
“I lived with a woman and she was going
to have a baby and she went in for an abortion

00:28:53.358 --> 00:28:57.658
and I conceded, and since then

00:28:57.658 --> 00:29:02.417
I have been feeling very sad about the whole
thing."

00:29:02.417 --> 00:29:09.427
But the whole view about life has to be changed
then only you can avoid these things.

00:29:09.427 --> 00:29:12.057
You see it is a symptom of a disease.

00:29:12.057 --> 00:29:18.167
It’s not the disease itself, abortion is
not the disease, is a symptom of a disease.

00:29:18.167 --> 00:29:25.308
Now what is the disease with in us is, is
that, that we have allowed our sex to be let

00:29:25.308 --> 00:29:28.868
loose completely, talking too much about sex
from childhood.

00:29:28.868 --> 00:29:32.458
What is the need to give education in sex,
I’ve been failed to understand?

00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:38.108
Openly, there’s no need to teach about,
you see, do the animals need any sex education,

00:29:38.108 --> 00:29:40.228
they still produce.

00:29:40.228 --> 00:29:48.068
Then they told Me, “They tell about sex
only because they think by telling about sex

00:29:48.068 --> 00:29:50.927
they can protect people from not going into
sex."

00:29:50.927 --> 00:29:54.858
I said, “No, they create too much of curiosity
in children."

00:29:54.858 --> 00:30:00.368
For example, in India we never talk about
sex to children, they do not know, they are

00:30:00.368 --> 00:30:01.368
so innocent.

00:30:01.368 --> 00:30:06.998
Even till the marriage takes place some of
the girls do not know what sex actually is,

00:30:06.998 --> 00:30:08.528
how it works out and all.

00:30:08.528 --> 00:30:14.118
But they are told this is something filthy
to do and all that and when the girl gets

00:30:14.118 --> 00:30:19.958
into puberty it is told and to the boys also,
somehow or other it is a very different society.

00:30:19.958 --> 00:30:23.688
This question doesn’t come, it never comes
into the head of the boys and girls.

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:29.438
You see if you keep them pure, like it doesn’t
come in the head of a sister and a brother

00:30:29.438 --> 00:30:32.677
even today, thank God.

00:30:32.677 --> 00:30:37.188
Many sisters and brothers I should say despite
Freud’s all efforts to spoil your minds,

00:30:37.188 --> 00:30:39.648
but still there are brothers and sisters relations
today.

00:30:39.648 --> 00:30:46.228
In the same way it doesn’t come into their
heads at all.

00:30:46.228 --> 00:30:51.158
And when they get married they are to be told,
this is what it is.

00:30:51.158 --> 00:30:55.848
And that’s why they say these koarak and
all these places were built where they could

00:30:55.848 --> 00:31:00.398
take young brides and young people to see
that.

00:31:00.398 --> 00:31:06.838
This was called as Koomari Kar Temple, means
the married women when they were not virgins

00:31:06.838 --> 00:31:13.768
could go there and see those places to understand
what is sex is and they got so exhausted with

00:31:13.768 --> 00:31:18.198
this early sex life, I mean you go into all
kinds of tantrums then.

00:31:18.198 --> 00:31:21.288
Because you’re so exhausted then you go
into perversions.

00:31:21.288 --> 00:31:22.907
The basics are wrong.

00:31:22.907 --> 00:31:26.518
We are trying too hard to be sexologists.

00:31:26.518 --> 00:31:32.108
There’s no need to be sex points you are
that already.

00:31:32.108 --> 00:31:37.427
But you don’t want to be only sex points,
do you?

00:31:37.427 --> 00:31:48.069
I don’t know what makes you feel that that
is the end of every, every endeavor, everything

00:31:48.069 --> 00:31:49.248
should end up there.

00:31:49.248 --> 00:31:54.307
May be that advertisement and all this is
coming to you too much because they think

00:31:54.307 --> 00:31:56.898
that by exploiting these things they will
help you.

00:31:56.898 --> 00:32:11.328
But it’s such a perverted thing and

00:32:11.328 --> 00:32:26.348
Seeker interrupts and asks Shri Mataji about
people in India being given a gift like a

00:32:26.348 --> 00:32:28.108
transistor radio for sterilization.

00:32:28.108 --> 00:32:31.408
Does it have a purpose?

00:32:31.408 --> 00:32:40.578
It has a purpose to a point.....Oh I'm sorry
this has another point....

00:32:40.578 --> 00:32:45.358
He is talking about in India where they give
a transistor radio....

00:32:45.358 --> 00:32:53.047
Shri Mataji: That’s what they try, this
is also, you see western ideas coming to India.

00:32:53.047 --> 00:32:56.468
Oh, they did all sorts just to sterilise them.

00:32:56.468 --> 00:33:00.858
Oh! that’s how the lady lost her last election,
last election she has now pulled her ears

00:33:00.858 --> 00:33:01.858
for that.

00:33:01.858 --> 00:33:06.388
You see, they are all westernised people you
see, they try to try all these tricks in....

00:33:06.388 --> 00:33:08.088
People don’t like it you see.

00:33:08.088 --> 00:33:21.198
There’s a bridegroom who went for his wedding
and poor thing saw that there was a team of

00:33:21.198 --> 00:33:22.917
people standing there for sterilisation.

00:33:22.917 --> 00:33:31.018
He jumped out of the bus and he disappeared
forever, nobody knows where he is, disappeared.

00:33:31.018 --> 00:33:37.378
‘And they even sterilised people who were
very old and who were not even married you

00:33:37.378 --> 00:33:38.378
see.

00:33:38.378 --> 00:33:42.788
It’s so funny, so indiscriminate, I think
they were possessed by some bhoots I don’t

00:33:42.788 --> 00:33:44.148
know what to call them.

00:33:44.148 --> 00:33:52.558
You see population is a problem in India but
what to do now, you should solve the problem.

00:33:52.558 --> 00:33:56.398
And there is something working out in a very
funny way, I must tell you.

00:33:56.398 --> 00:34:01.698
I went to Colombia, I found lots of these
Norwegians carrying Colombian children with

00:34:01.698 --> 00:34:02.698
them.

00:34:02.698 --> 00:34:07.157
And they looked so different from Norwegian
children, Norwegian people and these Colombian

00:34:07.157 --> 00:34:08.157
children.

00:34:08.157 --> 00:34:11.417
I asked them, “Why do you acquire these
children where are you carrying them?

00:34:11.417 --> 00:34:16.637
They said “We have adopted them”.
I said, “Why don’t you produce your own?

00:34:16.637 --> 00:34:18.458
That would be better, to produce your own."

00:34:18.458 --> 00:34:25.288
"No we don’t want to go through the process
of it, it’s better to have ready made."

00:34:25.288 --> 00:34:31.708
So the supply has started in having all this
in developing countries to give you ready

00:34:31.708 --> 00:34:32.708
made children.

00:34:32.708 --> 00:34:38.037
Isn’t if funny, it’s funny things going
on, instant babies.

00:34:38.037 --> 00:34:48.617
Question: If a chakra is blocked and you clean
the chakras wouldn’t you being undoing the

00:34:48.617 --> 00:34:54.847
karmic cycle that a person has to go through?

00:34:54.847 --> 00:35:00.959
Shri Mataji: Very good idea, Because I think
you people...I know the question is this,

00:35:00.959 --> 00:35:06.477
that he is saying that if you try to clean
the chakras you will be undoing the karmic

00:35:06.477 --> 00:35:13.507
cycle and all that you see this is the typical
things that are being circulated in the west

00:35:13.507 --> 00:35:14.527
you see.

00:35:14.527 --> 00:35:19.638
That you have your own karmas you see and
we are the gurus so you have to go through

00:35:19.638 --> 00:35:23.678
your karmas, you must suffer for your karmas
you see like that is there.

00:35:23.678 --> 00:35:30.168
Now, this theory was all right before Christ
came in, not after His coming.

00:35:30.168 --> 00:35:32.497
And why are they here then?

00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:35.217
Why are we paying them, for what?

00:35:35.217 --> 00:35:37.047
You better pickle them out.

00:35:37.047 --> 00:35:41.948
They’re worth nothing because they just
take money from you, and we have to go through

00:35:41.948 --> 00:35:42.948
our karmas.

00:35:42.948 --> 00:35:45.948
They make you dance, jump go into all kinds
of things.

00:35:45.948 --> 00:35:49.027
Put spirits in us and say, “You are suffering
your karmas.

00:35:49.027 --> 00:35:55.388
Why should we suffer?” At least they should
suffer for our karma’s minimum of minimum.

00:35:55.388 --> 00:35:57.517
Now Christ has done that for you.

00:35:57.517 --> 00:36:01.918
He has taken all these karmas, your karmas
upon Himself.

00:36:01.918 --> 00:36:07.997
He has made way for us, that’s why you have
to pass through Him.

00:36:07.997 --> 00:36:15.638
Once you pass through Him, through Agnya chakra,
your karmas are sucked in by Him, that’s

00:36:15.638 --> 00:36:17.037
your ego.

00:36:17.037 --> 00:36:21.847
It’s the only ego that says you have done
this wrong, and that wrong.

00:36:21.847 --> 00:36:26.577
You see an animal doesn’t think that way.

00:36:26.577 --> 00:36:30.257
It thinks it’s it own sva bhavah the way
it has to be.

00:36:30.257 --> 00:36:34.878
But it’s only the human beings who think
I’ve done this wrong, I’ve done that wrong.

00:36:34.878 --> 00:36:37.998
I’ve done this good, that bad because we
have ego.

00:36:37.998 --> 00:36:47.938
But when your Kundalini passes through your
Agnya chakra your ego is sucked in, your superego

00:36:47.938 --> 00:36:48.938
is sucked in.

00:36:48.938 --> 00:36:53.597
Christ has done double job in one shot you
know, it’s great.

00:36:53.597 --> 00:37:00.918
That’s why He was crucified, it was to be.

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:08.658
He took all your karmas upon Himself and put
it into hell.

00:37:08.658 --> 00:37:15.717
So what ever karmas you have done are all
sucked in.

00:37:15.717 --> 00:37:17.958
But the door must open fully.

00:37:17.958 --> 00:37:23.277
In the beginning it happens that only a thread
comes up, you see, and the ego is not fully

00:37:23.277 --> 00:37:27.388
sucked in so sometimes it still comes up and
all that.

00:37:27.388 --> 00:37:32.228
The best weapon to get rid of them is to forgive
others.

00:37:32.228 --> 00:37:39.047
Forgiveness is the greatest weapon Christ
has given us, which we have to use, forgive,

00:37:39.047 --> 00:37:40.968
forgive and forgive.

00:37:40.968 --> 00:37:50.067
That’s a very good way, Lords Prayer is
the solution for your Agnya charka, you’ll

00:37:50.067 --> 00:37:51.148
be amazed.

00:37:51.148 --> 00:37:56.708
You have to say Lords Prayer after realisation
to open your Agnya.

00:37:56.708 --> 00:37:58.918
Then you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:37:58.918 --> 00:38:03.378
After realisation again I say, not before
realisation, it has no meaning.

00:38:03.378 --> 00:38:07.367
Before realisation what ever you have said
has gone into karmas.

00:38:07.367 --> 00:38:14.617
Only after realisation you are baptized and
get an opening here and all your karmas pass

00:38:14.617 --> 00:38:18.037
through that.

00:38:18.037 --> 00:38:22.217
Also you will find when you get realisation
lot of heat comes out these are the karmas

00:38:22.217 --> 00:38:25.638
you see, that are coming out.

00:38:25.638 --> 00:38:29.478
Let the heat go out and all karmas are finished.

00:38:29.478 --> 00:38:31.178
It’s like that.

00:38:31.178 --> 00:38:34.277
This is what is Self-Realisation.

00:38:34.277 --> 00:38:43.938
Like an egg is in a egg shell is very different,
but when it becomes a little chick and the

00:38:43.938 --> 00:38:53.987
mother breaks the tip of the egg a new bird
comes out with out any karmas or the smell

00:38:53.987 --> 00:38:56.237
of the egg.

00:38:56.237 --> 00:39:01.458
So clean and nice, every thing converted into
something beautiful.

00:39:01.458 --> 00:39:07.678
It’s like that, this is the rebirth.

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:12.698
This is how we become a new personality a
new being.

00:39:12.698 --> 00:39:15.741
So to forget about your karmas after your
realisation, all right.

00:39:15.741 --> 00:39:18.597
He has said it

00:39:18.597 --> 00:39:24.237
that, “He died for your sins."

00:39:24.237 --> 00:39:27.188
Didn’t He?

00:39:27.188 --> 00:39:30.317
And the wages of sin is fear.

00:39:30.317 --> 00:39:35.168
If you still have fear within you of your
karmas, you are still sinning.

00:39:35.168 --> 00:39:39.097
There should be no fear about it.

00:39:39.097 --> 00:39:44.787
Do not have any guilt, I’ve been telling
you not to have any guilt.

00:39:44.787 --> 00:39:47.758
What can you do?

00:39:47.758 --> 00:39:48.758
What sins can you commit?

00:39:48.758 --> 00:39:52.688
Do not have any fears.

00:39:52.688 --> 00:39:58.128
This is very common as I told you the other
day left Vishuddhi, I have to talk about it

00:39:58.128 --> 00:39:59.128
quite a lot.

00:39:59.128 --> 00:40:04.458
It’s so common, in Australia, in America
and in all the western countries, to feel

00:40:04.458 --> 00:40:05.458
guilty.

00:40:05.458 --> 00:40:09.948
Everything collapses there and nobody can
rise through the Agnya because it collapses

00:40:09.948 --> 00:40:13.168
down here onto left Vishuddhi where you feel
guilty.

00:40:13.168 --> 00:40:15.188
What are you feeling guilty about?

00:40:15.188 --> 00:40:17.178
And why did Christ come on this earth.

00:40:17.178 --> 00:40:19.708
You are just wasting His incarnation by feeling
guilty yourself.

00:40:19.708 --> 00:40:24.347
He has taken all your guilt upon Himself.

00:40:24.347 --> 00:40:27.617
What do you thing He was?

00:40:27.617 --> 00:40:35.337
He was Omkara, he was Pranava, He was the
word, He was that power.

00:40:35.337 --> 00:40:45.558
He’s not attached to anything but He can
take away everything that you think is sin,

00:40:45.558 --> 00:40:50.547
because He’s sinless, He so pure, immaculate.

00:40:50.547 --> 00:40:54.287
All right does that give you some hopes?

00:40:54.287 --> 00:40:58.938
Or still you are indulging into your own miseries?

00:40:58.938 --> 00:41:03.267
Question: Can You give us some guide about
diet.

00:41:03.267 --> 00:41:04.717
Shri Mataji: Diet?

00:41:04.717 --> 00:41:05.717
All right.

00:41:05.717 --> 00:41:10.097
This diet theory is also coming from some
horrible Brahmins you see.

00:41:10.097 --> 00:41:12.287
Don’t listen to them.

00:41:12.287 --> 00:41:16.757
They are the greatest rakshasas ever born
on this earth.

00:41:16.757 --> 00:41:19.607
Devils, rakshasas are monsters.

00:41:19.607 --> 00:41:25.139
They eat like hell, they eat such a lot and
they always tell you, “Don’t do this and

00:41:25.139 --> 00:41:29.537
don’t do that."

00:41:29.537 --> 00:41:36.188
You can eat anything you like except don’t
eat the meat of animals which are bigger than

00:41:36.188 --> 00:41:37.188
you.

00:41:37.188 --> 00:41:44.198
I mean other wise you will develop muscles
which will have funny contours and things.

00:41:44.198 --> 00:41:50.787
Eat animals which are smaller than you is
the point is.

00:41:50.787 --> 00:41:59.337
And if you eat those animals they do not also
have much sense of compassion and all that.

00:41:59.337 --> 00:42:03.918
It’s all right they are just like vegetables
sort of things, so it doesn’t matter.

00:42:03.918 --> 00:42:08.018
You don’t kill them, they are killed in
the machine and all that, you have to eat

00:42:08.018 --> 00:42:10.418
that, and you need it, you have to eat.

00:42:10.418 --> 00:42:14.378
But that doesn’t mean that if you are vegetarians
you should become non vegetarians.

00:42:14.378 --> 00:42:15.577
It doesn’t mean that.

00:42:15.577 --> 00:42:17.117
What ever you eat, you can eat.

00:42:17.117 --> 00:42:21.138
Eating is not going to change your spirit.

00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:33.797
Spirit doesn’t eat, it does not, makes no
difference to the spirit except that, to your

00:42:33.797 --> 00:42:37.587
body which is the lamp.

00:42:37.587 --> 00:42:41.707
So if you have to keep the wick all right,
you have to keep the lamp all right and for

00:42:41.707 --> 00:42:46.847
that don’t eat anything that is a very big
animal compared to yourself.

00:42:46.847 --> 00:42:51.158
Cows meat for example in India they don’t
eat, because, “Have you ever seen Indian

00:42:51.158 --> 00:42:53.438
cows they’re very gentle."

00:42:53.438 --> 00:42:58.797
And the cows are in the house, just like mother
they start giving milk to the children they

00:42:58.797 --> 00:42:59.797
see.

00:42:59.797 --> 00:43:03.678
Every day they are taking the milk of the
cows so they develop a feeling, you see.

00:43:03.678 --> 00:43:05.467
And that’s why they don’t drink, you see.

00:43:05.467 --> 00:43:10.148
But it doesn’t mean that if your Australian
cows are I don’t think are like that.

00:43:10.148 --> 00:43:17.027
Because what I’ve seen they look like buffalos
to Me sometimes.

00:43:17.027 --> 00:43:22.888
Like My granddaughter, she came to England
and she asked Me, “Mother, Grandmother,

00:43:22.888 --> 00:43:27.708
why the buffalos in England are white?”
Yes, so, it’s all right.

00:43:27.708 --> 00:43:30.188
But you’ll come down on diet.

00:43:30.188 --> 00:43:32.648
It will be different you see, you’ll see
gradually.

00:43:32.648 --> 00:43:34.327
But don’t worry about it.

00:43:34.327 --> 00:43:37.948
Gradually everything drops out into very little
things.

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:39.818
But you allow yourself to develop.

00:43:39.818 --> 00:43:40.818
Question: Eggs?

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:41.818
And things like that?

00:43:41.818 --> 00:43:43.938
Shri Mataji: Oh, eggs you better have, lots
of it.

00:43:43.938 --> 00:43:46.378
But if you have liver it’s not good to have
eggs.

00:43:46.378 --> 00:43:51.238
Eggs is very heating,, pork is otherwise good
but not good for the people who have liver

00:43:51.238 --> 00:43:52.238
problem.

00:43:52.238 --> 00:43:54.617
See you must understand that every person
is different.

00:43:54.617 --> 00:43:57.408
Now today I met a lady who is very left sided.

00:43:57.408 --> 00:43:59.767
So I had to tell her, “You eat pork, eggs
everything.

00:43:59.767 --> 00:44:02.277
You see it is how you are.

00:44:02.277 --> 00:44:03.867
Even the Indian Ayurveda is like that.

00:44:03.867 --> 00:44:09.107
They want to know the prakruti, the character
of a person how he is.

00:44:09.107 --> 00:44:12.207
We have evolved from different types of animals.

00:44:12.207 --> 00:44:13.948
I saw the nocturnal ones.

00:44:13.948 --> 00:44:19.388
You see the nocturnal ones must eat a lot
of meats, those who have evolved from nocturnal

00:44:19.388 --> 00:44:20.388
side, you see.

00:44:20.388 --> 00:44:26.037
Left-sided, the ones who are afraid and frightened
and who are not egoistical at all you see.

00:44:26.037 --> 00:44:31.198
Such types they should take more meats and
things but those who are too much aggressive

00:44:31.198 --> 00:44:33.547
better take to vegetables, is better.

00:44:33.547 --> 00:44:39.378
All right now, what’s the question?

00:44:39.378 --> 00:44:49.498
Question: Does forgiveness stop the rich getting
richer and the poor getting poorer?

00:44:49.498 --> 00:44:51.507
Shri Mataji: It does absolutely, absolutely.

00:44:51.507 --> 00:44:56.228
Sahaja Yoga is the thing that balances the
society.

00:44:56.228 --> 00:45:03.717
Those who are poor become richer and the rich
understand that they must share.

00:45:03.717 --> 00:45:09.638
Willingly they start sharing their money.

00:45:09.638 --> 00:45:13.688
But you become really rich in a very miraculous
manner.

00:45:13.688 --> 00:45:18.297
Now there’s a girl here and I would like
her to tell you what happened to her, it’s

00:45:18.297 --> 00:45:19.297
miraculous.

00:45:19.297 --> 00:45:22.577
But she’s an Australian and she doesn’t
tell lies you can see that very clearly and

00:45:22.577 --> 00:45:26.077
she’ll tell you what happened to her.

00:45:26.077 --> 00:45:31.527
Where is she gone?

00:45:31.527 --> 00:45:35.178
Sharon come along..is she here?

00:45:35.178 --> 00:45:43.948
No let her tell, is better, she’s Australian
they’ll believe her more.

00:45:43.948 --> 00:45:49.797
But never trust an Indian that’s even worse.

00:45:49.797 --> 00:45:56.807
You know some of the gurus have introduced
some Indian bhoots, Indian spirits into English

00:45:56.807 --> 00:46:02.908
people, and Americans and also European and
I find they behave just like Indians.

00:46:02.908 --> 00:46:07.008
They’ll cheat, they embezzle, they’ll
take away things, not the women, they’ll

00:46:07.008 --> 00:46:08.837
not touch the women you see.

00:46:08.837 --> 00:46:15.257
But they’ll touch the things they take away
the empty cans, is typical Indian you see.

00:46:15.257 --> 00:46:16.747
It’s rather

00:46:16.747 --> 00:46:22.317
surprising, yes there are some, I’ve seen
them like that.

00:46:22.317 --> 00:46:27.867
It’s surprising to see such things happening
to a western person who behaves just like

00:46:27.867 --> 00:46:34.037
an Indian must be some possession of bhoots
put by these gurus.

00:46:34.037 --> 00:46:41.077
So if you believe Me then I can tell you what
she’s told, it’s really miraculous, very

00:46:41.077 --> 00:46:42.837
miraculous, you see.

00:46:42.837 --> 00:46:48.938
Cheryl was telling Me that she wanted to come
to India and she had no money.

00:46:48.938 --> 00:46:59.537
So her daughter was very anxious to come to
India and they didn’t know what to do, they

00:46:59.537 --> 00:47:00.537
didn’t have sufficient money.

00:47:00.537 --> 00:47:08.537
So they just said, “Mother we want to come
to India can you arrange it for us, that’s

00:47:08.537 --> 00:47:09.537
all."

00:47:09.537 --> 00:47:13.678
And it so happened that this girl had taken
a trinket she had in the house, a bracelet

00:47:13.678 --> 00:47:17.418
to the school for a sale, whenever they have
the fetes all over.

00:47:17.418 --> 00:47:22.047
So she took that for the fete and the teacher
said, “I think this is gold."

00:47:22.047 --> 00:47:24.807
She couldn’t believe it.

00:47:24.807 --> 00:47:29.557
She brought it home and they got it valued
and they found that the price of the thing

00:47:29.557 --> 00:47:33.957
was equal to what they had to spend for both
of them travels.

00:47:33.957 --> 00:47:35.807
But this is nothing.

00:47:35.807 --> 00:47:39.317
And then she got some money from somewhere
in the house, somewhere I don’t know how

00:47:39.317 --> 00:47:42.287
she got some money and she didn’t sell even
the bracelet.

00:47:42.287 --> 00:47:44.448
And that’s still there she said, “For
the next trip."

00:47:44.448 --> 00:47:47.208
I said, “I hope so, you sell it."

00:47:47.208 --> 00:47:48.208
“May not."

00:47:48.208 --> 00:47:55.198
Like that you see, things work out, because
your Laxshmi Tattawa, your centre of well

00:47:55.198 --> 00:47:58.178
being gets enlightened and then you are looked
after.

00:47:58.178 --> 00:47:59.898
So many things happen.

00:47:59.898 --> 00:48:06.777
Like today they told Me so many things of
this kind happening to them and I too.

00:48:06.777 --> 00:48:12.247
You see when these people came in, I had told
them all right, you give Me so much money

00:48:12.247 --> 00:48:14.648
may be required for your stay there.

00:48:14.648 --> 00:48:20.037
Very little it was, very little for them to
be there in India after all, you see India

00:48:20.037 --> 00:48:22.857
is also now becoming very expensive.

00:48:22.857 --> 00:48:26.757
And when I went to India I had discovered
it had become very expensive, doesn’t matter

00:48:26.757 --> 00:48:28.037
I said, “I’ll put it in the bank.

00:48:28.037 --> 00:48:29.457
“Let it be there."

00:48:29.457 --> 00:48:35.658
And anybody ask Me, “Have it, you want it,
have it, now spend go,” and it was all right.

00:48:35.658 --> 00:48:41.207
I could manage, see that’s what he did,
and so many of them have done it.

00:48:41.207 --> 00:48:42.507
It’s looked after.

00:48:42.507 --> 00:48:48.458
You go to right places, you get right things,
don’t spend too much, you do not repent

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:54.267
for spending and you feel happy for whatever
you have.

00:48:54.267 --> 00:48:59.087
You feel very joyous, not worried about counting
but if you make a budget you had it.

00:48:59.087 --> 00:49:05.938
You don’t worry your head about budgeting,
how much your going to spend, you’ll be

00:49:05.938 --> 00:49:06.938
surprised.

00:49:06.938 --> 00:49:08.918
You won’t go to things which are unnecessary,
useless but you’ll buy something that is

00:49:08.918 --> 00:49:16.158
very good and ultimately these things will
be very precious for you to sell.

00:49:16.158 --> 00:49:19.267
Many things have happened like that.

00:49:19.267 --> 00:49:23.517
Many things have happened.

00:49:23.517 --> 00:49:27.678
Question: Why is Australia important for the
future?

00:49:27.678 --> 00:49:29.908
Maybe about Shri Ganesha?

00:49:29.908 --> 00:49:35.207
Shri Mataji: Only thing I don’t want to
pamper the ego.

00:49:35.207 --> 00:49:39.148
Question: Is Australia blessed?

00:49:39.148 --> 00:49:42.408
Shri Mataji: Very much, very much blessed.

00:49:42.408 --> 00:49:51.557
It’s a very much blessed place, specially
created.

00:49:51.557 --> 00:50:01.057
Australia was the first continent to be created
and if I dare to answer this question, I hope

00:50:01.057 --> 00:50:06.597
you’ll believe Me and not get into ego trips.

00:50:06.597 --> 00:50:21.057
Australia is a place which is described in
the ancient Puranas that a great saint was

00:50:21.057 --> 00:50:28.878
sent to Australia and another heaven was created.

00:50:28.878 --> 00:50:38.777
And that saint is called as Thrishanku which
is your Southern Cross...what do you call

00:50:38.777 --> 00:50:40.707
that?

00:50:40.707 --> 00:50:44.867
That shows the Southern Cross and you can
only see Southern Cross from Australia.

00:50:44.867 --> 00:50:55.898
This is one of the Puranas, the Vedas have
also mentioned this and even before that Australia

00:50:55.898 --> 00:50:57.817
is the place which has the Ganesha.

00:50:57.817 --> 00:51:06.198
The first is the Mooladhara Chakra, the first
centre is in Australia.

00:51:06.198 --> 00:51:10.297
How much wise you should be.

00:51:10.297 --> 00:51:16.158
Did you hear Me?

00:51:16.158 --> 00:51:24.757
Question: She wanted your opinion about the
Australian aboriginals.

00:51:24.757 --> 00:51:32.347
Shri Mataji: Oh, they must have been good
people to begin with, I am sure of it.

00:51:32.347 --> 00:51:41.248
They must have been very good and holy people
and nice people but I think later on they

00:51:41.248 --> 00:51:49.747
deviated because of too much jungles and things
you know, they started feeling the fear of

00:51:49.747 --> 00:51:51.107
the nature too much.

00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:59.128
They must have worshiped things, which were
good to begin with and later on to some things

00:51:59.128 --> 00:52:01.908
like spirits and this.

00:52:01.908 --> 00:52:08.148
More over the dead bodies the way they disposed
of must have been something wrong.

00:52:08.148 --> 00:52:17.428
So maybe they might have gone into a left
sided action into primitive ways of exciting

00:52:17.428 --> 00:52:18.428
these bhoots

00:52:18.428 --> 00:52:22.138
and things, spirits and spiritualism and all
that.

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:26.458
But in Australia must be the minimum, in Africa
is horrible.

00:52:26.458 --> 00:52:32.237
African countries have too much of it but
it should be the minimum of minimum because

00:52:32.237 --> 00:52:38.027
you see, Ganesha’s chakra is connected with
the left side, you see is more on the left

00:52:38.027 --> 00:52:39.527
side isn’t it?

00:52:39.527 --> 00:52:47.337
So also one can go drift more on to the left
side that is what it is.

00:52:47.337 --> 00:52:53.817
And even today I feel there’s kind of a
lurking inferiority complex that works in

00:52:53.817 --> 00:52:54.817
Australians.

00:52:54.817 --> 00:52:59.337
They try to copy the west, there’s nothing
to copy there, they’ve nothing sensible.

00:52:59.337 --> 00:53:01.527
They have to learn from you.

00:53:01.527 --> 00:53:05.517
You see this is a little inferiority complex
we have that all the best things are in the

00:53:05.517 --> 00:53:06.517
west.

00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:11.047
That’s wrong, you are much better of in
so many ways.

00:53:11.047 --> 00:53:13.698
At least you’ve not lost your moorings.

00:53:13.698 --> 00:53:20.438
So I would not pass a general remark about
a community as such but there is a possibility

00:53:20.438 --> 00:53:22.198
that they can come up very well too.

00:53:22.198 --> 00:53:24.678
I mean they can get out of all that left-sidedness.

00:53:24.678 --> 00:53:32.908
In India also we have big communities in the
south where people have lived with too much

00:53:32.908 --> 00:53:39.517
ritualism and all that and have taken to left-sided
behaviour of attracting you know spirits and

00:53:39.517 --> 00:53:41.997
this and that, and giving those [telesmart?]
and all that.

00:53:41.997 --> 00:53:47.277
They have done all that they are doing, like
witchcraft, witch doctors and all that.

00:53:47.277 --> 00:53:52.188
They must be doing it, but it can be cured
there’s no problem.

00:53:52.188 --> 00:53:57.968
As the west, people are over developed and
very ego orientated and right side.

00:53:57.968 --> 00:54:01.447
Both are extreme cases, but you can be correct.

00:54:01.447 --> 00:54:07.107
The people who are left side it’s easier
because they have to move forward but it’s

00:54:07.107 --> 00:54:09.688
difficult for ego orientated to move backwards.

00:54:09.688 --> 00:54:13.557
But if we can do that there why not here,
so nothing is lost.

00:54:13.557 --> 00:54:17.438
One should not worry too much about these
things.

00:54:17.438 --> 00:54:21.857
Human begins are just the same everybody has
Kundalini, finished.

00:54:21.857 --> 00:54:31.957
As long as you have Kundalini I have no problem.

00:54:31.957 --> 00:54:36.297
Question: Is there anything wrong with eating
chilies?

00:54:36.297 --> 00:54:40.057
Shri Mataji: No, it suits some people very
much.

00:54:40.057 --> 00:54:44.668
Some people should have, those who suffer
from colds will be a good idea, suffer from

00:54:44.668 --> 00:54:46.557
constipation is a good idea.

00:54:46.557 --> 00:54:48.688
But don’t eat too much of anything.

00:54:48.688 --> 00:54:53.847
But it’s good for some people, something
is good for some people, something is good

00:54:53.847 --> 00:54:55.527
for some people, you have to just find out.

00:54:55.527 --> 00:54:59.977
For people who get constipated it is better
to have a little of green chilies all the

00:54:59.977 --> 00:55:03.028
time, it is very rich in vitamin C.

00:55:03.028 --> 00:55:13.878
It is very rich in vitamin C is good for people
who catch colds very easily.

00:55:13.878 --> 00:55:20.527
Question: Do you know anything about the teaching
called Mahikari

00:55:20.527 --> 00:55:23.467
Shri Mataji: I know.

00:55:23.467 --> 00:55:33.138
You see Mahikari thing was, the person who
started Mahikari was a realised soul, though

00:55:33.138 --> 00:55:34.958
not so well equipped.

00:55:34.958 --> 00:55:42.957
I’ve met him before his realisation and
he got realisation I think through Me only,

00:55:42.957 --> 00:55:44.007
what ever it was.

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:46.867
I do not want to claim anything like that.

00:55:46.867 --> 00:55:48.948
But only thing is he was not equipped, well
equipped.

00:55:48.948 --> 00:55:52.077
Like anybody here who gets realisation starts
doing something.

00:55:52.077 --> 00:55:56.557
And his daughter I think, mislead the people
because she’s not a realised soul.

00:55:56.557 --> 00:56:01.777
She became very money-orientated, she started
putting it, it’s happened with every one

00:56:01.777 --> 00:56:02.777
of them.

00:56:02.777 --> 00:56:08.638
But poor thing, this one was not, he just
got realisation he was not an incarnation

00:56:08.638 --> 00:56:10.638
also, you see.

00:56:10.638 --> 00:56:19.327
Even incarnations who came on this earth like
Christ you see, like Mohammad Sahab, like

00:56:19.327 --> 00:56:24.687
Rama, Krishna see such great incarnations
were purest of pure.

00:56:24.687 --> 00:56:31.497
Even those people have been mishandled and
people have raised organisations, which are

00:56:31.497 --> 00:56:33.947
just money making propositions.

00:56:33.947 --> 00:56:35.607
Everything some how man makes into money.

00:56:35.607 --> 00:56:40.687
I don’t know how, it’s something that
happens to human beings you see.

00:56:40.687 --> 00:56:46.097
Then they start giving [Telesmart?] then they
start giving this, that, cross, this I mean

00:56:46.097 --> 00:56:48.277
it’s a money-making proposition through
out.

00:56:48.277 --> 00:56:52.307
You see this is the trouble.

00:56:52.307 --> 00:56:57.468
Warren: She said you are right.

00:56:57.468 --> 00:57:05.247
Shri Mataji: And you may lose lots of your
powers, even ordinary, normal powers with

00:57:05.247 --> 00:57:14.777
this kind of a wrong attitude you see, or
misguidance, because it happens like that,

00:57:14.777 --> 00:57:17.378
you can make mistakes, you can do so many
things.

00:57:17.378 --> 00:57:25.128
You know I’ve seen people, one girl whom
I had given realisation she went to a lady

00:57:25.128 --> 00:57:26.517
who was a medium.

00:57:26.517 --> 00:57:29.767
She used to get “Ho, ho, ho, ho,” like
that, and this thing.

00:57:29.767 --> 00:57:30.767
And she

00:57:30.767 --> 00:57:34.247
gave her a talisman and she became actually
blind, actually blind.

00:57:34.247 --> 00:57:40.438
Now she’s blind, her eyes are open, I mean
I have to still cure her.

00:57:40.438 --> 00:57:44.187
This is the report I got about her.

00:57:44.187 --> 00:57:48.506
Question: Would you say the same of the Hari
Krishna Organisation?

00:57:48.506 --> 00:57:50.337
Shri Mataji: Oh, now you are pulling Me into
controversy.

00:57:50.337 --> 00:57:54.587
But I will tell you the other way round.

00:57:54.587 --> 00:58:00.497
You see if you go on calling say the name
of anybody, even your name would you like

00:58:00.497 --> 00:58:01.497
it?

00:58:01.497 --> 00:58:03.867
So then how can God like it?

00:58:03.867 --> 00:58:11.787
On the Oxford Street you stand up, you should
see the site, they even sell those things

00:58:11.787 --> 00:58:16.517
see like wigs, they sell them like wigs in
the market.

00:58:16.517 --> 00:58:20.487
They shave off and sometimes they wear wigs.

00:58:20.487 --> 00:58:25.918
See it’s not show, it is something that
has to happen within.

00:58:25.918 --> 00:58:31.347
It’s not the show that you put up is something
that has to happen.

00:58:31.347 --> 00:58:38.227
You see most of them end up with throat cancer
and very violent, very violent people.

00:58:38.227 --> 00:58:42.658
They are beggars’ absolute parasites.

00:58:42.658 --> 00:58:46.077
Warren: with expensive cars.

00:58:46.077 --> 00:58:52.747
Shri Mataji: You see this is very nice,
I met somebody in England and I told him,

00:58:52.747 --> 00:58:55.217
“What do you do here?” He said, “I deal
in opium."

00:58:55.217 --> 00:58:59.528
I got a fright.
I said, “Opium, how do you deal in opium?”

00:58:59.528 --> 00:59:03.117
“Other people’s money,”
I said, “That’s very good, other people’s

00:59:03.117 --> 00:59:04.117
money."

00:59:04.117 --> 00:59:05.267
You see you can float an enterprise.

00:59:05.267 --> 00:59:12.337
It’s very easy because you are such seekers
such great seekers of ages and you are so

00:59:12.337 --> 00:59:14.027
naïve, very good.

00:59:14.027 --> 00:59:21.567
You go anywhere they’ll take a square, sit
there with saffron cloths with some circles

00:59:21.567 --> 00:59:23.687
on, another fellow will be fanning.

00:59:23.687 --> 00:59:28.467
Oh this one is very great, coming direct from
Kashi.

00:59:28.467 --> 00:59:30.557
Then have nothing to do with horrible people.

00:59:30.557 --> 00:59:35.357
Kashi is one of the worst places now.

00:59:35.357 --> 00:59:39.747
So you all go and prostrate.

00:59:39.747 --> 00:59:41.067
This is what it is.

00:59:41.067 --> 00:59:46.398
I mean, why are you enamoured by these circuses,
aren’t you fed up with them?

00:59:46.398 --> 00:59:52.398
We had a lady from Norway, this one was very
interesting.

00:59:52.398 --> 00:59:56.938
She came to My house stayed with Me, very
badly caught up, and she told Me the story

00:59:56.938 --> 00:59:58.537
of a lama who came to Norway.

00:59:58.537 --> 01:00:03.388
First he told all these Norwegians, “You
see, if I have to come to Norway you have

01:00:03.388 --> 01:00:07.207
to make a place with the floor which has got
all marble."

01:00:07.207 --> 01:00:08.367
Look at that.

01:00:08.367 --> 01:00:10.697
They’re such parasites these Lamas are.

01:00:10.697 --> 01:00:16.138
First they have sucked the blood of these
poor Tibetans and now they were willing to

01:00:16.138 --> 01:00:17.418
suck the blood of these Norwegians.

01:00:17.418 --> 01:00:22.388
Now these poor young people you see, I should
say the young people in the west are really

01:00:22.388 --> 01:00:27.457
not rich because they’re parents do not
give them money the way we give our children

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.457
you see.

01:00:28.457 --> 01:00:34.428
So they starve themselves, they ate only potatoes
and this and that and for one year they starved

01:00:34.428 --> 01:00:39.027
themselves to create this floor for these
horrible people.

01:00:39.027 --> 01:00:42.388
And this fellow came you see, with his shaved
head and all that.

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:50.567
He stayed there and this lady told Me that
she had to go and just bow to him one thousand

01:00:50.567 --> 01:00:52.128
times for three months.

01:00:52.128 --> 01:00:53.287
One thousand times.

01:00:53.287 --> 01:00:58.857
Imagine, just to go, as it is he’ll be finished,
even three times is sufficient to finish you

01:00:58.857 --> 01:01:00.507
off.

01:01:00.507 --> 01:01:02.347
And three months she did it.

01:01:02.347 --> 01:01:06.668
And with Me she was arguing morning till evening.

01:01:06.668 --> 01:01:12.017
I said, “Look at that, her arguing with
Me, eating My head off and here your bowing

01:01:12.017 --> 01:01:13.017
to him."

01:01:13.017 --> 01:01:17.418
They would not allow anybody to go near the
lama, the great was sitting on the seventh

01:01:17.418 --> 01:01:20.547
step somewhere hanging in the air.

01:01:20.547 --> 01:01:29.857
Is very common you know, the more you are
missing from the scene the more you are difficult

01:01:29.857 --> 01:01:31.717
to be seen you see.

01:01:31.717 --> 01:01:34.878
Is something great, “Oh, ho! I’ve seen
the glimpse of that

01:01:34.878 --> 01:01:37.867
horrible thing,” that’s what people think.

01:01:37.867 --> 01:01:43.428
You see this is what they play upon you emotional,
what you call it emotional blackmail.

01:01:43.428 --> 01:01:46.587
That’s what it is.

01:01:46.587 --> 01:01:50.408
They will tell you first of all they’re,
we call them chumchars, we call them spoons.

01:01:50.408 --> 01:01:53.117
They’ll come and tell you, “Oh this is
very difficult, you know.

01:01:53.117 --> 01:02:02.367
He may not give you any interview, and you
have to at least you should shell out five

01:02:02.367 --> 01:02:07.277
hundred rupees, see it is not easy, it’s
very difficult.

01:02:07.277 --> 01:02:14.277
Only you should send your photograph with
five hundred,” all this nonsense.

01:02:14.277 --> 01:02:20.678
If you are the river Ganges, what can malign
you, what can dirty you, what can make you

01:02:20.678 --> 01:02:21.797
impure?

01:02:21.797 --> 01:02:26.168
If you are here for purification then nothing
can impure you.

01:02:26.168 --> 01:02:34.197
One two three four, now the one who has not
asked at all should ask

01:02:34.197 --> 01:02:36.427
Question: Over the years it seems we have
lost our power to believe in our self that

01:02:36.427 --> 01:03:02.748
we had in Egyptian times the power to believe
in ourselves but we went wrong..

01:03:02.748 --> 01:03:11.277
Warren: the question is the loss of power
within ourselves, perhaps back in the days

01:03:11.277 --> 01:03:17.908
of Egypt we had these powers, we seem to have
lost our power to believe in ourself.

01:03:17.908 --> 01:03:23.498
Shri Mataji: I don’t know even if at that
time you had those powers very much.

01:03:23.498 --> 01:03:29.607
But Egyptians indulged more on the ego side
you see, those who were rulers.

01:03:29.607 --> 01:03:35.138
And the slaves were on the left hand side
too much because they obeyed the rulers you

01:03:35.138 --> 01:03:36.138
see.

01:03:36.138 --> 01:03:40.408
So the sensitivity came to them from spirits,
not directly from themselves.

01:03:40.408 --> 01:03:47.007
And some of them were really, very realised
souls and you’ll be amazed if these extreme

01:03:47.007 --> 01:03:51.128
cases are there they understand an incarnation
better.

01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:58.747
Say if you are taking LSD too much, you will
see only lights coming out of Me, you won’t

01:03:58.747 --> 01:03:59.747
see Me.

01:03:59.747 --> 01:04:04.307
There are many who must have seen that, auras
and things, if you are on the right hand side

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:05.398
too much.

01:04:05.398 --> 01:04:09.807
If you are on the left had side you’ll be
awed, you’ll be shaking before Me and you

01:04:09.807 --> 01:04:14.628
may see My previous births and you’ll be
quite frightened because you’ll know what

01:04:14.628 --> 01:04:15.628
it is.

01:04:15.628 --> 01:04:22.087
So they understood the incarnations better,
but evolutionary you are much higher than

01:04:22.087 --> 01:04:23.367
they are.

01:04:23.367 --> 01:04:31.497
Though there’s confusion because of so called
freedom you had which you misused.

01:04:31.497 --> 01:04:37.997
But as a whole I think this is the time for
blossom.

01:04:37.997 --> 01:04:44.888
Only thing you must know that you’re a seeker
and you are a seeker then you must get it

01:04:44.888 --> 01:04:49.277
and if you get it why should you be surprised.

01:04:49.277 --> 01:04:54.398
But it’s like a seeking has become like
a fashion, seeking here, seeking there seeking

01:04:54.398 --> 01:04:56.227
there, seeking you stop no where you see.

01:04:56.227 --> 01:05:00.827
You see you go on fixing the bolts you see,
you’re just going with an inertia, even

01:05:00.827 --> 01:05:03.297
if you stop fixing you still go on like that.

01:05:03.297 --> 01:05:09.067
It’s like that, you see, it’s a style
you have developed going from this to that,

01:05:09.067 --> 01:05:14.057
that to that, that to that and you cannot
stop it.

01:05:14.057 --> 01:05:34.928
Question: I’d be interested in Your opinion
of philosophy for Rudolf Steiner and secondly

01:05:34.928 --> 01:05:45.827
you concept of Papa tax sungar in India.

01:05:45.827 --> 01:05:51.668
All these are all people playing on bhoots
and things, that’s all I can say.

01:05:51.668 --> 01:05:59.857
(Shri Mother asks the seeker what does Steiner
say and he says million words.)

01:05:59.857 --> 01:06:07.638
Word, words, words and words, what does he
say?

01:06:07.638 --> 01:06:22.117
This Steiner his vibrations are very good,
Might be a realised soul but what does he

01:06:22.117 --> 01:06:24.097
say?

01:06:24.097 --> 01:06:43.888
Seekers tries to tell Shri Mataji what he
writes about.

01:06:43.888 --> 01:06:51.398
He might be a realised soul like Khalil Gibran
is, you see his vibrations are good.

01:06:51.398 --> 01:06:55.668
He might be, but still you have to become
realised souls you see.

01:06:55.668 --> 01:06:58.097
Reading that even Zen is all that.

01:06:58.097 --> 01:07:01.547
Zen is everything is, nothing but his realisation.

01:07:01.547 --> 01:07:07.297
But you’ll be amazed that the head of Zen
himself reads all Zen without being realised,

01:07:07.297 --> 01:07:09.707
and he’s a hopeless fellow.

01:07:09.707 --> 01:07:12.237
I just talked to him and he said, “Oh, he
cannot get realisation."

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:13.268
He’s confirmed on that point.

01:07:13.268 --> 01:07:19.238
Imagine the head of the Zen saying that, and
he said we had kashapas only twenty six kashapas

01:07:19.238 --> 01:07:22.498
we had in six centuries can you believe it.

01:07:22.498 --> 01:07:26.658
And he wouldn’t take his realisation and
he was so frightened.

01:07:26.658 --> 01:07:29.937
He accepted Me all right but he said, “I
am nowhere, Mother, compared to You."

01:07:29.937 --> 01:07:30.937
“What is this?

01:07:30.937 --> 01:07:32.487
But I am telling you can get."

01:07:32.487 --> 01:07:34.168
Warren: Steiner catches on Agnya and swadisthan.

01:07:34.168 --> 01:07:38.837
Shri Mataji: So it’s good to read somebody
who is a realised soul, but you better get

01:07:38.837 --> 01:07:39.837
it yourself.

01:07:39.837 --> 01:07:43.388
You become Steiner, all right.

01:07:43.388 --> 01:07:48.317
What I’m saying, you become a realised soul.

01:07:48.317 --> 01:07:53.787
And you can write about your own experiences.

01:07:53.787 --> 01:07:56.898
Yes, please.

01:07:56.898 --> 01:08:05.757
Question: Seeker asks about opinion of Dadaji.

01:08:05.757 --> 01:08:08.658
Shri Mataji: Dadaji, he’s arrested.

01:08:08.658 --> 01:08:10.408
Warren: In Calcutta

01:08:10.408 --> 01:08:13.898
Shri Mataji: He’s already in jail.

01:08:13.898 --> 01:08:19.158
No, he was in Pune where he was arrested,
this Dadaji.

01:08:19.158 --> 01:08:23.018
This happened about I think, I don’t know,
but I heard about it.

01:08:23.018 --> 01:08:25.898
I don’t know when it happened.

01:08:25.898 --> 01:08:31.238
No it was not because of any political thing.

01:08:31.238 --> 01:08:37.008
But they found some income tax things and
all that and lots of, I don’t know, I didn’t

01:08:37.008 --> 01:08:40.798
pay much attention but he’s arrested that
I know.

01:08:40.798 --> 01:08:51.218
There are these sorts of things but the best
part of the thing is that all that is untruth

01:08:51.218 --> 01:08:53.648
is exposed, gradually.

01:08:53.648 --> 01:08:57.938
Whatever things they may put out, whatever
story they may put out, whatever they may

01:08:57.938 --> 01:09:02.368
try, they may entice you, you may be interested
in them whatever it is.

01:09:02.368 --> 01:09:05.488
But they themselves meet their end.

01:09:05.488 --> 01:09:13.248
Because all that is falsehood has an end and
truth is endless, it is anand, it is eternal.

01:09:13.248 --> 01:09:16.848
The truth is eternal.

01:09:16.848 --> 01:09:22.598
Question: What do you see as the future of
the United Nations?

01:09:22.598 --> 01:09:25.047
Shri Mataji: That’s a tricky question.

01:09:25.047 --> 01:09:27.938
My husband is one of the secretary generals.

01:09:27.938 --> 01:09:30.948
I better not speak all right.

01:09:30.948 --> 01:09:32.648
Let it be.

01:09:32.648 --> 01:09:39.148
We’ll see about it, work it out.

01:09:39.148 --> 01:09:41.308
Some tricks we have to play.

01:09:41.308 --> 01:09:44.508
Question: Do you know of Krishnamurti?

01:09:44.508 --> 01:09:51.728
Shri Mataji: Oh, very much, he’s another
one.

01:09:51.728 --> 01:09:53.988
Krishnamurti is another blah, blah, blah.

01:09:53.988 --> 01:09:57.398
I’ll tell you about Krishnamurti very well.

01:09:57.398 --> 01:10:00.078
You see what Krishnamurti does?

01:10:00.078 --> 01:10:05.398
He says this part what I say that “There
are false gurus."

01:10:05.398 --> 01:10:08.728
But I don’t say there are not real ones.

01:10:08.728 --> 01:10:12.308
If there is falsehood, if there’s artificiality,
there has to be real.

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:16.568
If there are artificial flowers there has
to be a real flower, too.

01:10:16.568 --> 01:10:21.749
So he negates you from the other side completely
and he puts up your ego by saying, “Oh you

01:10:21.749 --> 01:10:22.838
can find it,” so you are finished.

01:10:22.838 --> 01:10:27.148
He’s a blind leading others into blindness.

01:10:27.148 --> 01:10:38.108
(Delete-Yogi relates story of a seeker about
his meeting with Krishnamurti to Shri Mataji.

01:10:38.108 --> 01:10:48.118
He saw him personally asks him “why do you
do what you do” and Krishnamurti said, “Does

01:10:48.118 --> 01:10:49.818
a rose ask why?”)

01:10:49.818 --> 01:10:55.858
Shri Mataji: I mean it has no awareness, simple
answer is as that.

01:10:55.858 --> 01:10:58.418
A rose has no awareness.

01:10:58.418 --> 01:11:02.008
By any chance he’s not a rose.

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:05.088
he’s just thorns that’s what I know.

01:11:05.088 --> 01:11:07.419
Those who have come from him have had a very
bad time I must tell you.

01:11:07.419 --> 01:11:11.308
You see they are really so depressed and so
horrid.

01:11:11.308 --> 01:11:14.697
We had one architect; I mean his life was
finished.

01:11:14.697 --> 01:11:20.318
So many of them I’ve met, horrible they’re
very argumentative.

01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:25.088
The best example I’ll give you about this
because you’ve brought forth.

01:11:25.088 --> 01:11:38.298
There was a fellow who came to see Me, he’s
the grandson of his guru.

01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:47.178
His guru was Yogananda, Yogananda, the Kriya
yogis, you see.

01:11:47.178 --> 01:11:57.158
He was the grandson of the Dadaji or something,
Babaji, called Dadaji then Babaji

01:11:57.158 --> 01:11:58.818
are there.

01:11:58.818 --> 01:12:06.968
This Babaji, his grandson, you see, his Yogananda’s
guru was somebody else, and he was the son

01:12:06.968 --> 01:12:13.388
of this fellow, but I mean the grandson of
his guru, so the great grandson of Babaji.

01:12:13.388 --> 01:12:20.008
So the whole family was Kriya and he did all
the Kriya Yoga and everything he did.

01:12:20.008 --> 01:12:23.178
He went there and he got so frightened.

01:12:23.178 --> 01:12:29.778
One day he happened to see this Krishnamurti
that there should be no he said, “No Kriya

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:34.848
and all that, you see, that you are your own
guru,” and this and that."

01:12:34.848 --> 01:12:38.988
So he said, “Oh God, what have I been doing?”
So he gave up Kriya Yoga and came to Mr.

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:42.708
Krishnamurti.
He said, “I became such an expert that I

01:12:42.708 --> 01:12:44.358
spoke better than Krishnamurti did."

01:12:44.358 --> 01:12:48.288
And everybody was surprised and said, “Second
Krishnamurti is coming and I ran away for

01:12:48.288 --> 01:12:49.288
there.

01:12:49.288 --> 01:12:53.288
I said, “Now this is that thing is happening
to Me.

01:12:53.288 --> 01:12:57.458
And he came to Me, you’ll be amazed I’ve
not been able to give him realisation till

01:12:57.458 --> 01:12:58.458
today.

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:00.968
I must tell you this, he comes to Me still
often.

01:13:00.968 --> 01:13:02.618
Often, very often he comes to Me.

01:13:02.618 --> 01:13:04.598
I’ve not yet given him realisation.

01:13:04.598 --> 01:13:09.198
Imagine the grandson of this Babaji has to
bear I don’t know what things, poor things

01:13:09.198 --> 01:13:14.778
has been done to him, I ‘m very sorry for
him.

01:13:14.778 --> 01:13:18.218
Question: Do you know Rajneesh?

01:13:18.218 --> 01:13:22.338
Shri Mataji: He’s another horrible one.

01:13:22.338 --> 01:13:29.978
Why do you need a guru for such a thing?

01:13:29.978 --> 01:13:33.128
You are masters, he’s a fool, he doesn’t
know compared to what you know.

01:13:33.128 --> 01:13:39.228
But you see what you thought of, that inside
you are human beings, you feel guilty that

01:13:39.228 --> 01:13:42.268
you talk of sex with animals, sex with this,
this, that.

01:13:42.268 --> 01:13:47.288
If there’s something lurking in you, there’s
something wrong in all this perversion and

01:13:47.288 --> 01:13:48.938
homosexuality this that and all that.

01:13:48.938 --> 01:13:53.318
So you thought it better to have a guru at
least he’ll certify.

01:13:53.318 --> 01:13:57.978
But he is going to make you take two running
jumps to go to hell, I tell you.

01:13:57.978 --> 01:14:03.728
And he talks, just there and he talks, “That
you’ll go to bottomless pit,” in the bible

01:14:03.728 --> 01:14:05.238
a bottomless pit is the hell.

01:14:05.238 --> 01:14:08.688
You see he’s very honest in a way, he says
so.

01:14:08.688 --> 01:14:11.978
He said, “You’ll go to bottomless pit."

01:14:11.978 --> 01:14:16.758
He has criticised Christ to such an extent
that he said that Christ had bad relations

01:14:16.758 --> 01:14:18.198
with his own Mother.

01:14:18.198 --> 01:14:23.618
Oh to that extent, he said about Mohammad
having bad relation with his daughter.

01:14:23.618 --> 01:14:28.398
All sorts of things he is talking and you
know people publish it.

01:14:28.398 --> 01:14:30.238
He’s getting such a publicity.

01:14:30.238 --> 01:14:36.608
He pays money to people that they write against
Me and doing all kinds of things.

01:14:36.608 --> 01:14:42.048
Indians don’t like him at all, at all, they
hate him, they want him to get out but he’s

01:14:42.048 --> 01:14:44.788
so localised he cannot smell a flower and
he calls himself Bhagavan, means God.

01:14:44.788 --> 01:14:54.088
In the book you see, anywhere you read, any
Indian book where they have described God,

01:14:54.088 --> 01:14:59.688
the names of God, they’re thousand names
supposing, of Vishnu or of the Goddess, anything.

01:14:59.688 --> 01:15:03.868
At least fifteen or twenty of them are that
they are fond of flowers, they’re fond of

01:15:03.868 --> 01:15:05.228
fragrance, they’re fragrant.

01:15:05.228 --> 01:15:10.658
That they’re fond of Kamalas, Champas they’re
fond this that all is there and this fellow

01:15:10.658 --> 01:15:15.648
cannot see, if you show a flower to him he’ll
run away.

01:15:15.648 --> 01:15:22.088
He cannot bear to have any incense being burnt
anywhere.

01:15:22.088 --> 01:15:26.258
When you go there you they see and you can
only put phenyl to go and see him.

01:15:26.258 --> 01:15:29.188
I think he’s a bathroom cleaner, that’s
what he is.

01:15:29.188 --> 01:15:31.218
The way he’s so much afraid.

01:15:31.218 --> 01:15:37.148
I don’t know what he likes the bathroom
smell.

01:15:37.148 --> 01:15:41.568
And he does all dirty things, very dirty fellow,
is filthy I don’t want to tell you what

01:15:41.568 --> 01:15:47.398
he does but I know what he does.

01:15:47.398 --> 01:15:58.188
Question: Could you explain the meaning of
satoori and samadhi.

01:15:58.188 --> 01:16:02.238
Shri Mataji:That’s Zen.

01:16:02.238 --> 01:16:10.598
You see Zen satoori is the same as samadhi
but it’s a, you see the Zen were as I told

01:16:10.598 --> 01:16:16.958
you in six centuries were twenty-six and whatever
they wrote people never understood you see.

01:16:16.958 --> 01:16:21.908
Because they were realised souls, some of
them were born realised, some got realisation.

01:16:21.908 --> 01:16:26.628
Now even when you will talk people won’t
understand you, it’s a very surprise thing.

01:16:26.628 --> 01:16:29.498
But it happens like that because your language
changes.

01:16:29.498 --> 01:16:33.438
Now they call it satoori is a samadhi but

01:16:33.438 --> 01:16:40.938
it’s not so clearly given, they could not
explain so clearly about it not properly to

01:16:40.938 --> 01:16:44.208
people, it’s not so clear cut.

01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:50.358
Now in our Sahaja Yoga we have first of all
Nirvichara samadhi.

01:16:50.358 --> 01:16:54.798
Samadhi, dhi means awareness, and samadhi
means enlightened awareness.

01:16:54.798 --> 01:16:56.468
Nirvichara means thoughtless.

01:16:56.468 --> 01:17:00.718
Thoughtless enlightened awareness is first
thing, is clear.

01:17:00.718 --> 01:17:05.438
Sahaja Yoga is very clear cut practical, every
word of it.

01:17:05.438 --> 01:17:08.808
You see it so clearly there’s no vagueness
about it.

01:17:08.808 --> 01:17:13.158
Even you’ll understand Bible better, Zen
better, everything better if you know Sahaja

01:17:13.158 --> 01:17:16.708
Yoga because your eyes are open to it, all
right.

01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:20.338
So the first thing is Nirvichara Samadhi.

01:17:20.338 --> 01:17:29.048
With Nirvichara Samadhi when it crosses your
Agnya chakra you get Nirvichara, means when

01:17:29.048 --> 01:17:30.708
your ego is pulled down.

01:17:30.708 --> 01:17:32.278
With that you get powers.

01:17:32.278 --> 01:17:35.688
Like you see if you become a deputy governor
you get powers if you become a governor you

01:17:35.688 --> 01:17:36.688
get powers.

01:17:36.688 --> 01:17:39.998
The first powers you get is curative powers.

01:17:39.998 --> 01:17:43.518
You get cured and you can cure others.

01:17:43.518 --> 01:17:48.008
Many people whom I have cured are not Sahaja
yogis they’re useless people actually.

01:17:48.008 --> 01:17:52.148
I’ve given up curing people for the same
reason because they just come for cures they

01:17:52.148 --> 01:17:53.148
get cured and lost.

01:17:53.148 --> 01:17:56.238
What’s the use of curing people who are
not going to give the light?

01:17:56.238 --> 01:18:00.468
You see you don’t repair lights which are
not going to work out.

01:18:00.468 --> 01:18:04.528
It’s a horrible stuff you see, curing people,
but you do cure.

01:18:04.528 --> 01:18:09.788
You start curing people automatically with
raising [sounds like das?] not with spirit.

01:18:09.788 --> 01:18:13.918
There are another faith healers and all that
nonsense is not there.

01:18:13.918 --> 01:18:19.018
Also Kundalini can rise to a point with a
person like that.

01:18:19.018 --> 01:18:22.098
But one should not stay at that point must
go higher.

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:28.458
Because the movement on right and left you
start getting either supra conscious or your

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:35.458
subconscious experiences which can be very
alluring and you can be quite lost in them.

01:18:35.458 --> 01:18:42.258
You start seeing lights, you start seeing
something different, you might see an aura

01:18:42.258 --> 01:18:43.258
around Me.

01:18:43.258 --> 01:18:48.688
I mean you see lots of things, you may see
something else in My past , that should not

01:18:48.688 --> 01:18:49.688
be there.

01:18:49.688 --> 01:18:50.688
You should forget about it.

01:18:50.688 --> 01:18:55.038
You have to go to the airport to catch the
plane isn’t it, so don’t see all the things

01:18:55.038 --> 01:18:57.668
around, it’s all not wanted.

01:18:57.668 --> 01:19:03.378
Many people get lost at that point when they
stop at Agnya, if you have concentrated here

01:19:03.378 --> 01:19:07.778
this can happen more because this is broken
or if you have had this third eye business

01:19:07.778 --> 01:19:10.018
and all that you may go to the side.

01:19:10.018 --> 01:19:11.858
It can be quite dangerous.

01:19:11.858 --> 01:19:21.188
You see if you use these your samadhi for
some sort of a sensation.

01:19:21.188 --> 01:19:22.958
So you should not.

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:31.268
I mean all wise people should not use this
movement at all, as far as possible say, “No

01:19:31.268 --> 01:19:32.288
we don’t want to see that.

01:19:32.288 --> 01:19:35.698
We don’t want to have any supra conscious
sensation,” and all that.

01:19:35.698 --> 01:19:44.438
Then you rise higher and then you try to feel
your silence in the limbic area and you have

01:19:44.438 --> 01:19:46.718
to feel your vibrations coming out from your
head.

01:19:46.718 --> 01:19:52.878
It is the vibrations when they are flowing
that’s the best stage, when you have pierced

01:19:52.878 --> 01:19:54.378
through your Bramarundra.

01:19:54.378 --> 01:19:59.258
So the second stage starts from Nirvikalpa
Samadhi growing into, which many of the Sahaja

01:19:59.258 --> 01:20:07.498
Yogis have achieved in Australia, is called
as Nirvikalpa, where the is no doubts.

01:20:07.498 --> 01:20:10.808
You have no doubts left about Sahaja Yoga,
you have no doubts left about yourself.

01:20:10.808 --> 01:20:16.298
It’s a state, it’s not that by mentally
or rationally but it’s a state.

01:20:16.298 --> 01:20:20.968
Where you see it so clearly, white is white,
you don’t have to doubt that whether my

01:20:20.968 --> 01:20:23.428
eyes are showing white or black, you see.

01:20:23.428 --> 01:20:28.388
That state is reached is called as Nirvikalpa
where the no vikalpa, you just go, move steadily

01:20:28.388 --> 01:20:33.218
and that’s the best stage where you really
grow faster because you’re so steady and

01:20:33.218 --> 01:20:34.828
that stage must be achieved.

01:20:34.828 --> 01:20:39.398
So try to achieve that stage through negating
things, “Nethi, nethi, vachinay nigamoor,”

01:20:39.398 --> 01:20:47.378
by saying, “Not this, not this, not this,”
and you reach that stage, is very clearly

01:20:47.378 --> 01:20:48.378
given.

01:20:48.378 --> 01:20:55.688
You see the trouble is, so many of these books
which are so great are never translated, people

01:20:55.688 --> 01:20:56.688
do not know about them.

01:20:56.688 --> 01:21:02.018
Now after coming to Sahaja Yoga you will be
exposed to them and you will see what truths

01:21:02.018 --> 01:21:14.878
there are and how Sahaja Yoga verifies it
and proves it.

01:21:14.878 --> 01:21:19.248
Question: What influence are you likely to
have on those around him or on people who

01:21:19.248 --> 01:21:22.288
live with You who are not realised.

01:21:22.288 --> 01:21:29.538
What is the realised souls influence in that
type of environment?

01:21:29.538 --> 01:21:38.578
Shri Mataji:You see if you have stones and
if you have living trees, stones do not receive

01:21:38.578 --> 01:21:44.588
anything from the sun but the leaves receive
something isn’t it, they are more sensitive,

01:21:44.588 --> 01:21:45.938
that’s the difference.

01:21:45.938 --> 01:21:51.538
Then in Sahaja yoga there’s a possibility
that you can convert stones into living beings,

01:21:51.538 --> 01:21:53.378
can be done.

01:21:53.378 --> 01:22:03.298
Yes, because they see, you see they see you,
they understand the value that you are, gradually,

01:22:03.298 --> 01:22:09.078
rationally they start understanding then they
reach certain conclusions, then they come

01:22:09.078 --> 01:22:13.288
to Sahaja Yog, then they get realised, it
works out that way.

01:22:13.288 --> 01:22:17.198
But with seekers it’s very different, seekers
just jump into it.

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:19.728
They do not think about it they just get it.

01:22:19.728 --> 01:22:24.308
They get it so fast that they don’t think
about it, they just they get it.

01:22:24.308 --> 01:22:31.888
So they are so sensitive that’s the difference.

01:22:31.888 --> 01:22:42.298
Question: Can we help our loved ones who do
not want to listen to anything particularly

01:22:42.298 --> 01:22:43.968
about Sahaja Yoga?

01:22:43.968 --> 01:22:49.708
Shri Mataji: You see there’s nobody else
that you help someone, they are all within

01:22:49.708 --> 01:22:50.708
yourself.

01:22:50.708 --> 01:22:55.558
On the contrary, I would say better to have
them together who are Sahaja yogis because

01:22:55.558 --> 01:22:59.658
those who are not will trouble you, it will
be a problem, leave them alone, they’ll

01:22:59.658 --> 01:23:01.288
be all right, they’ll come round.

01:23:01.288 --> 01:23:06.398
Let them come on their own you cannot force
them, they’re loved ones, you’ll change

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:11.688
now your priorities, you’ll understand that
those who are really loved ones are not really

01:23:11.688 --> 01:23:13.848
your brothers and sisters.

01:23:13.848 --> 01:23:21.248
As Christ has said, “Who are my brothers
and sisters?” Now we have to ask that question.

01:23:21.248 --> 01:23:25.128
Because you speak another language, you are
a different person, not that you give them

01:23:25.128 --> 01:23:27.108
up, but they exist.

01:23:27.108 --> 01:23:30.618
But they haven’t got your awareness so is
a different thing all together.

01:23:30.618 --> 01:23:36.588
But you help them in a way, gradually they
see you but if you force them they’ll run

01:23:36.588 --> 01:23:37.588
away.

01:23:37.588 --> 01:23:41.718
No use forcing or telling them anything about
it but you show your satisfaction and happiness

01:23:41.718 --> 01:23:47.388
and your growth and others get impressed by
it and they just come to you.

01:23:47.388 --> 01:23:52.718
Question: how can you..Do You help them?

01:23:52.718 --> 01:23:55.498
Shri Mataji: Yes, I do.

01:23:55.498 --> 01:23:59.038
But you should put them out of your minds
and say, “Mother, You help.

01:23:59.038 --> 01:24:13.308
If You try to help, then I’ll leave it to
You."

01:24:13.308 --> 01:24:18.768
Question: He cannot understand why You say
that Christ died for us.

01:24:18.768 --> 01:24:21.068
Why did He die for us?

01:24:21.068 --> 01:24:26.888
Shri Mataji: What else could He have done
with the stupid people?

01:24:26.888 --> 01:24:29.958
They crucified Him, He didn’t say, “You
come and crucify Me,” did He, you see?

01:24:29.958 --> 01:24:32.818
They’re stupid, horrible people, donkeys.

01:24:32.818 --> 01:24:38.868
They didn’t understand Him, stones as they
were what to do?

01:24:38.868 --> 01:24:41.978
They crucified Him, He didn’t ask.

01:24:41.978 --> 01:24:50.328
But when He was crucified the sins that they
committed in crucifying Him were to be forgiven.

01:24:50.328 --> 01:24:53.148
That’s what it is.

01:24:53.148 --> 01:24:55.628
He was, what did He do?

01:24:55.628 --> 01:25:00.038
You see He died because of you because people
like you only crucified Him.

01:25:00.038 --> 01:25:01.158
You represent them.

01:25:01.158 --> 01:25:06.748
When you are realised then you are different
people, then you are resurrected.

01:25:06.748 --> 01:25:12.348
His message was resurrection not crucifixion
but that shows the stupidity of these people,

01:25:12.348 --> 01:25:13.348
isn’t it.

01:25:13.348 --> 01:25:34.018
I mean you may do that again I can’t say,
there are people.

01:25:34.018 --> 01:25:55.088
Question: Is it possible to exercise love
and acceptance when as she says You’re judging

01:25:55.088 --> 01:25:58.558
people as to whether they’re right or wrong.

01:25:58.558 --> 01:26:02.268
Warren: We are using vibrations

01:26:02.268 --> 01:26:10.748
Shri Mataji: I am not judging, you are judging
because when you get your vibrations you start

01:26:10.748 --> 01:26:12.248
judging yourself.

01:26:12.248 --> 01:26:18.828
You see I am not judging it’s only your
own judgment.

01:26:18.828 --> 01:26:19.918
It’s your own judgment.

01:26:19.918 --> 01:26:24.338
Are you getting your cool breeze in the hands?

01:26:24.338 --> 01:26:26.788
No, then let it happen.

01:26:26.788 --> 01:26:31.708
I’m not judging you it’s you are judging
it yourself.

01:26:31.708 --> 01:26:33.208
All right, then you will know yourself.

01:26:33.208 --> 01:26:39.388
Just now you are judging that you’re not
getting vibrations.

01:26:39.388 --> 01:26:54.128
Question: Is it true that Indira Gandi is
worshiped as a Goddess?

01:26:54.128 --> 01:27:14.988
Shri Mataji: oh don't, That's all political
stuff, you see Indian people are like that.

01:27:14.988 --> 01:27:27.398
Warren: that's useless

01:27:27.398 --> 01:27:42.838
Question: She’s confused about the fact
that You talked about love and acceptance

01:27:42.838 --> 01:27:48.628
at the beginning but then when peoples names
were brought up we often scoffed at them.

01:27:48.628 --> 01:27:51.358
Shri Mataji: ah About the gurus?

01:27:51.358 --> 01:27:52.808
Ah, that’s it.

01:27:52.808 --> 01:27:55.218
It’s a very important point.

01:27:55.218 --> 01:28:01.298
That’s very much with you people.

01:28:01.298 --> 01:28:06.528
You see you have all of you, you see have
developed a philosophy where you say that

01:28:06.528 --> 01:28:10.088
nobody is evil, everything is fine.

01:28:10.088 --> 01:28:15.318
This is a very good philosophy to work with
because you also fit into the thing.

01:28:15.318 --> 01:28:17.338
That nothing is evil about you also, isn’t
it?

01:28:17.338 --> 01:28:18.848
It happens like that.

01:28:18.848 --> 01:28:25.468
You remember when Christ was criticising these
horrible people they asked Him, “How do

01:28:25.468 --> 01:28:27.148
You criticise them?

01:28:27.148 --> 01:28:29.648
They do not criticise You."

01:28:29.648 --> 01:28:37.918
Then He said, “Will the devil talk against
its own house?”

01:28:37.918 --> 01:28:46.968
There is a negative force working, very much
active and you have to not only scoff but

01:28:46.968 --> 01:28:54.948
get rid of these things because they are acting
as your destroying forces and they destroy

01:28:54.948 --> 01:28:58.198
you, I see them very clearly and I have to
tell you.

01:28:58.198 --> 01:29:04.748
So love doesn’t mean that I love a snake,
will you go and love a snake, a snake must

01:29:04.748 --> 01:29:09.177
understand first of all.

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:13.248
In the same way we have to understand there
are evil people, that’s true.

01:29:13.248 --> 01:29:18.828
That is what is very much in the West, I see,
“Oh, you love everyone is all right.

01:29:18.828 --> 01:29:21.448
But you don’t love a snake, do you?

01:29:21.448 --> 01:29:24.098
Go and have, ask snake, “I want to love
you."

01:29:24.098 --> 01:29:32.848
He’ll just finish you off.

01:29:32.848 --> 01:29:37.478
So many of you are harmed so much by these
people and I have to cure you.

01:29:37.478 --> 01:29:43.148
You don’t know what I have to go through,
such a lot of work to cure you when you are

01:29:43.148 --> 01:29:44.248
affected by these people.

01:29:44.248 --> 01:29:48.008
You don’t know how much I’ve worked, morning
till evening.

01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:54.748
This morning I started six o’clock till
I came here just ten minutes I got to change

01:29:54.748 --> 01:29:56.948
My sari and I was here.

01:29:56.948 --> 01:30:01.348
These are affected by other gurus and things
and I have to take it out.

01:30:01.348 --> 01:30:02.868
I know what harm they have done to you.

01:30:02.868 --> 01:30:08.858
You have no idea.

01:30:08.858 --> 01:30:17.798
Question: What are Your objections to chanting
and singing the holy scriptures?

01:30:17.798 --> 01:30:26.468
Shri Mataji: Not at all, who told you I am,
I’m not but you must understand that without

01:30:26.468 --> 01:30:30.778
understanding what chanting is needed it’s
like a medicine.

01:30:30.778 --> 01:30:33.258
Chanting is a mantra.

01:30:33.258 --> 01:30:45.298
Mantra means a thing that acts as a sound
to correct a particular thing within you,

01:30:45.298 --> 01:30:46.338
all right.

01:30:46.338 --> 01:30:49.968
It’s you can say sound therapy it is, all
right.

01:30:49.968 --> 01:30:56.008
Now you have to know what medicine is needed
for which charka, also you must know where

01:30:56.008 --> 01:31:00.458
is the problem with you, or with anybody else.

01:31:00.458 --> 01:31:06.128
I mean it would be chanting at random means
sometimes it would be sort of an indiscriminate

01:31:06.128 --> 01:31:08.898
drinking of all the medicines, you see.

01:31:08.898 --> 01:31:13.128
Taking all the medicines bottles into your
stomach emptying them without understanding.

01:31:13.128 --> 01:31:18.038
We do chant but we know where to chant, what.

01:31:18.038 --> 01:31:20.498
You see, not indiscriminate, just like that.

01:31:20.498 --> 01:31:26.098
And it’s very dangerous because when you
go on chanting say, Rama’s name or Krishna’s

01:31:26.098 --> 01:31:27.098
name.

01:31:27.098 --> 01:31:31.148
Now when you say Krishna’s name, Krishna
is here, if your Kundalini has not reached

01:31:31.148 --> 01:31:36.968
there up to this point if you take Krishna’s
name it’s very, very annoying for Krishna

01:31:36.968 --> 01:31:39.718
Himself and He recedes, sleeps off.

01:31:39.718 --> 01:31:46.008
He freezes sometimes and by that you develop
problems of the chakras and sometimes you

01:31:46.008 --> 01:31:50.378
develop throat cancer, it’s very serious.

01:31:50.378 --> 01:31:56.558
So first, you must know where is your Kundalini,
where it has gone, where it has stopped.

01:31:56.558 --> 01:32:00.948
Then you should know what is the problem,
then you must know what exactly is the chanting

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:04.098
to be used, all right, and then cure that
part.

01:32:04.098 --> 01:32:10.548
You see so it’s a big science, which has
to be understood in Sahaja Yoga, it’s not

01:32:10.548 --> 01:32:11.548
at random.

01:32:11.548 --> 01:32:17.318
You are suffering from whatever trouble you
are suffering from, you must know first of

01:32:17.318 --> 01:32:18.318
all.

01:32:18.318 --> 01:32:23.368
See many people who are Christians catch on
Agnya I told you, they do, because it’s

01:32:23.368 --> 01:32:24.368
unauthorised.

01:32:24.368 --> 01:32:32.538
Christ, we treat Him as if I don’t know
what, some passion fruit hanging in a tree.

01:32:32.538 --> 01:32:35.918
Do we know who He is?

01:32:35.918 --> 01:32:39.308
There is a protocol, great protocol.

01:32:39.308 --> 01:32:43.658
Even Brahma, Vishnu Mahesh could not reach
Him.

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:50.658
So for us because we think we are born among
Christian families and because the church

01:32:50.658 --> 01:32:56.408
has given us a certificate so called do you
think we are authorised to chant His name

01:32:56.408 --> 01:33:00.228
all the time and trouble Him?

01:33:00.228 --> 01:33:04.898
And what do we ask?

01:33:04.898 --> 01:33:06.568
Do we ask for our spirits?

01:33:06.568 --> 01:33:09.058
Do we ask to give our realisation?

01:33:09.058 --> 01:33:11.988
Do we ask that we have to be born again?

01:33:11.988 --> 01:33:19.188
No, what do we ask something nonsensical.

01:33:19.188 --> 01:33:27.008
Question: What is Your opinion about practicing
spiritualists.

01:33:27.008 --> 01:33:32.948
Shri Mataji: Very dangerous, never go near
them.

01:33:32.948 --> 01:33:39.338
Never touch them even with a barge pole, horrible
things they are.

01:33:39.338 --> 01:33:47.008
You see it is very simple to understand that
if you get connected with any area what so

01:33:47.008 --> 01:33:52.778
ever, and somebody is connected to that area
you are exposed to that and there can be any

01:33:52.778 --> 01:33:55.978
indiscriminate aggression on you from that
area.

01:33:55.978 --> 01:33:57.858
You would not know who’s coming on you.

01:33:57.858 --> 01:33:59.358
So never go near them.

01:33:59.358 --> 01:34:06.258
May be you want to talk to your father say,
whose dead, you want to talk to him.

01:34:06.258 --> 01:34:07.258
Why?

01:34:07.258 --> 01:34:09.038
Release him, free him, why do you want to
talk to him?

01:34:09.038 --> 01:34:12.948
Now let him be alone, let him decide for himself
what he wants to do.

01:34:12.948 --> 01:34:14.868
Why do you want him to hang around?

01:34:14.868 --> 01:34:18.308
It’s too much, it’s too much of a load.

01:34:18.308 --> 01:34:24.488
Then you want to, when you use some medium
for that you do not know he might get somebody

01:34:24.488 --> 01:34:25.488
else.

01:34:25.488 --> 01:34:28.878
It’s very dangerous for your children also,
so many children have died with this kind

01:34:28.878 --> 01:34:29.878
of a thing.

01:34:29.878 --> 01:34:35.858
I mean you develop especially cancer, this
multiple scleroses or anything like that.

01:34:35.858 --> 01:34:38.588
All these come from spiritualists.

01:34:38.588 --> 01:34:43.498
These are all spiritualists, these gurus are
spiritualists only.

01:34:43.498 --> 01:34:47.088
They’ll believe is spirits, they’ll handle
the spirits they’re working out, these are

01:34:47.088 --> 01:34:52.638
very dangerous things I may be able to tell
you some time how they work it out and how

01:34:52.638 --> 01:34:55.848
they master it.

01:34:55.848 --> 01:34:59.068
It’s very dangerous.

01:34:59.068 --> 01:35:02.998
They’re like vampires, what you call it,
vampires.

01:35:02.998 --> 01:35:07.838
More surprising is that there are so many
things in English language, which we don’t

01:35:07.838 --> 01:35:13.628
have, like witchcraft and the witches were
sort of punished, all sorts of things are

01:35:13.628 --> 01:35:14.628
there.

01:35:14.628 --> 01:35:20.508
In England, they talk of all these things
supernatural and all this but still I don’t

01:35:20.508 --> 01:35:23.578
know how they go into it.

01:35:23.578 --> 01:35:28.718
Warren: somebody asked me a question on the
way up.

01:35:28.718 --> 01:35:29.718
Is it wrong to be a medium?

01:35:29.718 --> 01:35:33.948
This relates to the previous question, so
perhaps you could answer that Mother?

01:35:33.948 --> 01:35:40.988
Shri Mataji: Oh God, I need not tell, it’s
very, very wrong to play into the hands of

01:35:40.988 --> 01:35:41.988
the spirits.

01:35:41.988 --> 01:35:44.958
You are enslaved completely; you don’t know
what happens to you.

01:35:44.958 --> 01:35:49.588
Horrible, it creates problems absolutely you’re
an abnormal personality.

01:35:49.588 --> 01:35:51.408
Never do it.

01:35:51.408 --> 01:35:53.238
It’s sinful, sinful.

01:35:53.238 --> 01:36:06.668
If you accept My words really it’s horrible,
never do that.

01:36:06.668 --> 01:36:12.349
Question: What is the difference between western
spirituality and eastern spirituality?

01:36:12.349 --> 01:36:16.578
Shri Mataji:Now this word spirituality means
by these spiritualists you mean?

01:36:16.578 --> 01:36:17.908
Warren: No.

01:36:17.908 --> 01:36:18.908
Philosophy

01:36:18.908 --> 01:36:22.428
Shri Mataji: Is just the same, spirit is just
the same.

01:36:22.428 --> 01:36:28.668
Is universal, there is no difference at all,
I do not find any difference.

01:36:28.668 --> 01:36:35.598
Spirituality means the spirit that is the
Atma, you mean the spirit that is the Atma,

01:36:35.598 --> 01:36:36.598
the one....

01:36:36.598 --> 01:36:42.289
Question: I’m talking more about the quest
for the spirit.

01:36:42.289 --> 01:36:45.418
Shri Mataji: Search is just the same.

01:36:45.418 --> 01:36:52.738
But Indians you see now, modern Indians are
sort of developing you see, they have to go

01:36:52.738 --> 01:36:56.908
to that height to see where you have landed
yourself.

01:36:56.908 --> 01:37:02.420
See they can short circuit, they can short
circuit if they want but if they want they

01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:09.818
may have to go to various types of problems
you had with that affluence and they may come

01:37:09.818 --> 01:37:10.818
back.

01:37:10.818 --> 01:37:14.068
But it is better to short circuit it I tell
them.

01:37:14.068 --> 01:37:24.578
While yours is a problem so easy because you
have discovered now that matter is not sufficient.

01:37:24.578 --> 01:37:29.478
Matter doesn’t give us joy, no use running
after matter.

01:37:29.478 --> 01:37:33.078
But still some of them are running after sex
you see and all that.

01:37:33.078 --> 01:37:37.938
They have to finish another circuit, once
they are over with that also then things will

01:37:37.938 --> 01:37:38.938
be better.

01:37:38.938 --> 01:37:43.088
But in all this kind of a quest you have lost
something indefinitely, no doubt.

01:37:43.088 --> 01:37:48.218
Going through the matter, going through the
sex and going through the power all these

01:37:48.218 --> 01:37:52.228
trips you see you have lost something, which
requires correction.

01:37:52.228 --> 01:37:59.258
While Indians if they understand with their
wisdom they better short circuit this need

01:37:59.258 --> 01:38:02.398
not go into plastics and nylons.

01:38:02.398 --> 01:38:07.878
You see I have to carry nylon saris from England
for Indians while they have their silks they

01:38:07.878 --> 01:38:08.888
want to wear nylon.

01:38:08.888 --> 01:38:15.538
So this is the difference in the basic development.

01:38:15.538 --> 01:38:20.558
But Indians if they take to Sahaja Yoga they’re
very good and easy, especially Indian villagers

01:38:20.558 --> 01:38:21.558
are excellent.

01:38:21.558 --> 01:38:25.138
They don’t understand all this they have
no mental problems you see.

01:38:25.138 --> 01:38:29.178
I don’t have to discuss with them all these
things, they have not gone into all this nonsense

01:38:29.178 --> 01:38:33.138
so they suddenly become beautiful fruits,
that’s all.

01:38:33.138 --> 01:38:39.848
So this is the difference of little degrees
I would say that you are gone to other extreme

01:38:39.848 --> 01:38:45.858
and you still have to move to that extreme
or they may finish off and we can achieve

01:38:45.858 --> 01:38:46.858
results.

01:38:46.858 --> 01:38:51.208
But your quest is much ardent, very sincere
and truth.

01:38:51.208 --> 01:38:58.438
One more thing I always felt and today also
I feel that really some great souls are born

01:38:58.438 --> 01:39:05.648
in the west, that’s why is such a sincere
desire, very sincere in their desire.

01:39:05.648 --> 01:39:10.858
Indians first they come to Me for curing,
if not for curing for getting children if

01:39:10.858 --> 01:39:15.288
not for that for jobs or money all sorts of
thing they come up.

01:39:15.288 --> 01:39:19.888
Or they’ll say, “My mother is sick, my
father is sick, my brother is this,” all

01:39:19.888 --> 01:39:20.978
this goes on.

01:39:20.978 --> 01:39:26.548
But I have met many, many seekers in the west
who just want realisation, very beautiful

01:39:26.548 --> 01:39:28.448
people no doubt.

01:39:28.448 --> 01:39:34.258
But you have lost something in your seeking,
no doubt, doesn’t matter.

01:39:34.258 --> 01:39:54.638
Kundalini is that ardent desire within you,
which works it out.

01:39:54.638 --> 01:40:04.758
Question: It seems as though the simpler the
life we lead the better we are, it is much

01:40:04.758 --> 01:40:05.758
easier for us.

01:40:05.758 --> 01:40:06.968
We get away from thinking and so on.

01:40:06.968 --> 01:40:14.918
Shri Mataji: I agree is a good idea of simplicity
but is a, you must understand that also very

01:40:14.918 --> 01:40:19.488
clearly because we had somebody who was a
hippy I should say.

01:40:19.488 --> 01:40:26.108
He was a real hippy, such big grown, he had
grown hair up to this much and all that.

01:40:26.108 --> 01:40:30.858
He came to Me and scarcely wearing anything
in the horrible English cold you see.

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:34.588
I said, “What are you doing to yourself
why don’t you clad your self properly into

01:40:34.588 --> 01:40:39.138
proper clothes and better cover yourself,”
and I was really didn’t understand him.

01:40:39.138 --> 01:40:43.278
I said, “You are not living in Africa why
are you dressed up like this, it’s like

01:40:43.278 --> 01:40:44.278
a primitive dress."

01:40:44.278 --> 01:40:45.948
He said, “I want to be primitive."

01:40:45.948 --> 01:40:48.498
I said, “You cannot by dressing up.

01:40:48.498 --> 01:40:53.898
Your brain is so over developed how can you
be primitive."

01:40:53.898 --> 01:40:56.128
You see by dressing up something do you become
that.

01:40:56.128 --> 01:41:01.698
I mean it’s just a drama you are playing
with yourself, you do not become primitive.

01:41:01.698 --> 01:41:07.429
This is the point is that and then the problem
is the brain is thinking the same way, that

01:41:07.429 --> 01:41:13.648
the same rate and everything the same, only
by changing is something that is not good

01:41:13.648 --> 01:41:15.348
because you should accept as you are.

01:41:15.348 --> 01:41:18.398
Why to do something like that?

01:41:18.398 --> 01:41:24.348
But simpler life means this way, that’s
another extreme.

01:41:24.348 --> 01:41:36.688
But you see too much of formality like having
a tail coat or wearing morning dress, grey

01:41:36.688 --> 01:41:41.758
suit and then having a particular type of
a glass for a thing and all that nonsense

01:41:41.758 --> 01:41:43.118
you see you better finish off.

01:41:43.118 --> 01:41:50.148
That’s bit too much going too far with it
and also caring for all these small, small

01:41:50.148 --> 01:41:56.028
things like matter that’s something that’s
grown in you.

01:41:56.028 --> 01:42:00.358
Preservation of horrible things and useless
things and all that it’s [really?].

01:42:00.358 --> 01:42:04.118
And then to think, think, think, think about
everything, sit down and think how miserable

01:42:04.118 --> 01:42:08.188
I am and when there is no misery you just
sit down and make miseries by thinking.

01:42:08.188 --> 01:42:11.598
I don’t find any thing miserable here, what
is there?

01:42:11.598 --> 01:42:16.968
You see in India these people where there
people are so happy, chirping just like birds

01:42:16.968 --> 01:42:17.968
enjoying themselves.

01:42:17.968 --> 01:42:21.698
They don’t have all the things that you
have.

01:42:21.698 --> 01:42:26.528
So you see to get out of materialism is a
better idea, to say that a simpler life means,

01:42:26.528 --> 01:42:28.328
but you must live beautifully.

01:42:28.328 --> 01:42:32.588
Beautiful doesn’t mean that you should have
ten types of things and all that.

01:42:32.588 --> 01:42:37.248
Beautifully means you should not be as a morbid
stinking, you see.

01:42:37.248 --> 01:42:44.688
Clean and beautiful you can make beauty out
of the soil anything; with love, you can do

01:42:44.688 --> 01:42:45.688
anything.

01:42:45.688 --> 01:42:49.508
So you see it’s alright I mean what ever
way you dress up or anything makes no difference

01:42:49.508 --> 01:42:51.298
that’s what I’m trying to say.

01:42:51.298 --> 01:42:53.938
That it is the inner thing that has to change
not the outer.

01:42:53.938 --> 01:42:55.768
Again the Sahaja Yoga is this.
