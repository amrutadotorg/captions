00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:20.338
Today it's a great day for us, for all the
Sahaja Yogis that on this day, I would say

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:38.073
we are late by one day or two days, the Sahasrara
was opened out.

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:56.130
It was just a miracle I should say because
I didn't think that I am at a point where

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.351
it could be done.

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:18.851
So I wanted to wait but some things happened
that made Me think that it has to be open.

00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:40.487
It was
in such a situation that I felt if I delayed

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:54.573
any more now, it may help these false gurus
to spread their nonsense all over.

00:01:54.573 --> 00:02:09.043
This is just I should say, is a Sahaj way
of doing things.

00:02:09.043 --> 00:02:13.883
Now 25 years have passed.

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:21.266
You all have gathered during this time, and
we have so many others who are not here, who

00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:26.350
have achieved so many things.

00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:36.712
But perhaps, we are not aware as to what we
have achieved in the real sense of the word.

00:02:36.737 --> 00:02:40.661
You've got your vibrations.

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:46.452
You can feel this All Pervading Power.

00:02:46.452 --> 00:02:52.991
You are as they say, swimming in the ocean
of joy.

00:02:52.991 --> 00:03:05.102
You are all enjoying the collectivity, and
that you have transcended many of your limitations.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:12.756
All this has happened to you because it is
your right to have it.

00:03:13.168 --> 00:03:16.869
I don't take any credit for it.

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:29.337
Only thing all the time I've been pointing
it out to you one thing that now, you have

00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:36.401
entered into the Kingdom of God, and enjoy
yourself.

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:40.600
We have to see around ourselves.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:47.740
The whole nature enjoys itself; doesn't bother,
doesn't bother about anything.

00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:50.513
They haven't got realization.

00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:54.347
They haven't felt the Paramachaitanya.

00:03:54.985 --> 00:04:00.375
But how is it they know that we have to enjoy?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:08.614
The flowers that come out for a short time
and fade out, but as long as they live,

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.455
they're very happy.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:18.112
They don't think of their past or of their
future, but they enjoy the present.

00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:24.880
And in the present, they enjoy what is - that
they are fragrant

00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:26.948
and giving fragrance to others.

00:04:26.973 --> 00:04:30.996
They're beautiful and they are soothing others.

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:33.836
The whole nature is like that.

00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:43.518
If you look at the birds or anything that
we call as natural is all sort of

00:04:43.543 --> 00:04:45.599
in a meditative mood.

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:52.221
All these hills, and big, big mountains.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:00.620
They look as if they are witness to whatever
has been happening.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:09.860
Now we have to really first look back what
we have achieved.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:18.285
That is important, because if you're climbing
up on a hill, if you look back,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.365
 you get a shock and you may fall down.

00:05:22.486 --> 00:05:25.529
So normally people say, never look back.

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:37.649
But a person who has earned some treasure,
he again and again goes and counts it and

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:45.360
finds out how much he has got, and every time
he sees that, he enjoys.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:54.579
So to know relatively what we have got and
how we have achieved something will definitely

00:05:54.579 --> 00:06:04.750
give you greater strength of mind and richness
of life.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:12.370
The first thing that has happened to you I
would say it is very important is this - that

00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:16.600
you have felt this All Pervading Power.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:26.270
That shows that you must have been great seekers
of truth, honest, sincere, sensible.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:40.149
That just coming to My program you felt the
vibrations, and after that you started settling

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:42.209
down into it.

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:50.019
So many of you have felt it suddenly, and
they were amazed and they were shocked and

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:56.510
surprised, and they wanted to test whether
it is true or not.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:05.490
But then you were confident, you found it
that you've got definitely a new dimension

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:15.450
in your life, and that you are feeling this
All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:22.110
I'll take one lecture sufficient to describe
this All Pervading Power.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:32.789
But what you got out of it is the essence
of it, one has to know, is a complete freedom.

00:07:33.067 --> 00:07:35.567
You have achieved your complete freedom.

00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:43.018
First of all, the freedom has come to you,
first of all, most important,

00:07:43.043 --> 00:07:45.956
is from your ego.

00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:51.307
This wall of ego you have crossed.

00:07:51.348 --> 00:08:04.371
You have got out of the bondage of this ego,
which was really so much full of

00:08:04.396 --> 00:08:06.626
problems for you.

00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:12.950
So many things this ego does of which you
are not aware.

00:08:12.977 --> 00:08:19.167
Firstly, a person who is egoist doesn't mind
hurting anyone.

00:08:20.659 --> 00:08:25.305
He hurts, but if he's hurt, he doesn't like
it.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.937
Immediately start crying.

00:08:26.962 --> 00:08:34.722
Specially I've seen people who have too much
ego are very easily hurt, but they don't understand

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:47.467
how many people they have hurt already, and
how many are really frightened of such a person.

00:08:48.004 --> 00:08:51.653
So you got rid of your ego.

00:08:51.678 --> 00:08:59.639
It is sinful to hurt any other human being
for anything; for whatever may be the reason

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:03.096
that you feel you should hurt another one.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:10.802
The first is the revenge; the idea of revenge
is there, that I must take a revenge on the

00:09:10.827 --> 00:09:21.693
person who has hurt me or has done some wrong
to me or something of that kind.

00:09:21.718 --> 00:09:25.951
This idea of revenge comes when you react.

00:09:26.153 --> 00:09:28.542
Some react very violently.

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:36.858
I have seen people murdering each other in
the name of revenge, killing their own kith

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:44.836
and kin, killing their fellow men, their country
men, all over the world is some sort of a

00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:50.117
stupid idea of revenge.

00:09:50.117 --> 00:09:55.496
But if you go to the subtle side of revenge,
what is it?

00:09:55.521 --> 00:09:57.756
What revenge have you taken?

00:09:57.882 --> 00:10:00.481
Supposing there is somebody who has troubled
you.

00:10:00.506 --> 00:10:05.082
You are angry with that person and you have
killed that person, so you have actually

00:10:05.107 --> 00:10:06.566
saved him.

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:14.367
He won't have to suffer from guilty conscience,
it won't have to do anything, it's just finished.

00:10:14.604 --> 00:10:16.763
What is the revenge is?

00:10:17.272 --> 00:10:27.196
The revenge should be only by which a person
gets out of his idea of killing others.

00:10:27.221 --> 00:10:32.768
Like a sword never fights a sword, it fights
the shield.

00:10:32.793 --> 00:10:45.680
In the same way, the revenge that we think
we can take on another person is not a revenge,

00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:52.817
because any action you take in the name of
revenge comes back to you

00:10:52.842 --> 00:10:55.135
and hurts you much more.

00:10:55.864 --> 00:11:01.480
So many things can happen if a person in the
name of revenge starts acting.

00:11:01.505 --> 00:11:04.952
Now for example, these days you know in the
whole world,

00:11:04.977 --> 00:11:07.405
 there's so much of revenge going on,

00:11:07.522 --> 00:11:16.567
even in the name of God; taking revenge
because certain people are following some

00:11:16.592 --> 00:11:22.137
religion, or they are doing something else
that you are doing.

00:11:22.162 --> 00:11:29.212
Working out this kind of a revenge, what has
happening is that you are just killing people,

00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:36.187
destroying them, who do not even understand
what sort of a revenge you are taking.

00:11:36.212 --> 00:11:42.876
People are putting bombs and putting all kinds
of things and by that thousands of innocent

00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:48.112
people one is killing; so what kind of a revenge
have you taken?

00:11:48.935 --> 00:11:51.362
They don't deserve any revenge.

00:11:51.387 --> 00:11:59.171
So this revenge when it explodes can destroy
so many innocent people and it will definitely

00:11:59.196 --> 00:12:01.316
react on you.

00:12:01.407 --> 00:12:04.407
You cannot get away with it.

00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:10.481
It's a very long process of this revenge.

00:12:13.131 --> 00:12:21.183
I've told you about Bermuda Triangle what
they say, that so many blacks were taken slaves

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:28.865
and were drowned in that area, so their spirits
they are saying, are haunting on the people

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.766
who are passing by; mostly the whites and
they just drowned.

00:12:34.252 --> 00:12:41.108
So it's a very long process, and all that
I need not discuss at this auspicious occasion,

00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:47.421
but I have to say that when we take a revenge,
every action has a reaction.

00:12:47.665 --> 00:12:56.187
So somehow you have got out of that idea of
revenge, just out of that idea.

00:12:56.259 --> 00:13:05.257
There's another thing that if you don't take
revenge, and leave it to God, It acts.

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:16.794
It acts, not only that, but a Divine Power
takes into Its own control how to really give

00:13:16.819 --> 00:13:25.845
a good lesson to that person or to that community
or to that kind of organization which is taking

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.933
a revenge on you.

00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:33.541
You don't have to worry.

00:13:33.684 --> 00:13:37.291
I'll have to tell you that in this 25 years
I've seen,

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:40.080
 people have been extremely unkind to me.

00:13:40.363 --> 00:13:47.402
Many organizations, many so called religions,
and all kinds of things have been after us.

00:13:47.439 --> 00:13:49.624
Media has been after us.

00:13:49.972 --> 00:13:52.910
Take the example of French media.

00:13:52.974 --> 00:14:01.763
They tried to trouble us so much and tried
to bring bad name to us, doesn't matter.

00:14:01.763 --> 00:14:09.194
The media people now, three of them who went
to India, are now under warrant and if they

00:14:09.194 --> 00:14:13.863
go to India, they will be arrested.

00:14:13.863 --> 00:14:15.323
I didn't do anything.

00:14:15.323 --> 00:14:18.104
We didn't do anything.

00:14:18.129 --> 00:14:26.819
Secondly, the same media, I mean the same
newspapers are all bankrupt.

00:14:27.414 --> 00:14:29.337
You didn't do anything about it.

00:14:29.362 --> 00:14:32.096
You didn't go and say that they should become
bankrupt.

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:33.247
You didn't take any revenge.

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:34.550
Why should we?

00:14:34.575 --> 00:14:36.951
Why should we take any revenge?

00:14:36.985 --> 00:14:44.775
Because we are not bothered as to what happens;
we are not bothered as to what these people

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.974
have done to us.

00:14:46.974 --> 00:14:54.544
But legally they are now involved in such
a way that they are under warrant and if they

00:14:54.544 --> 00:14:57.524
go to India, they'll be arrested.

00:14:57.524 --> 00:15:04.844
And the whole of French government is with
them, all of them are trying so much, but

00:15:04.844 --> 00:15:08.453
this punishment is on their head.

00:15:08.453 --> 00:15:12.552
In their lifetime, they didn't have to die
or anything;

00:15:12.577 --> 00:15:15.560
 in their lifetime they have got it.

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:24.068
So you have got this special power that you
don't have to take revenge or you have to

00:15:24.093 --> 00:15:25.533
just forgive.

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:34.547
Just forgive and the forgiveness will look
after the whole arrangement of how to bring

00:15:34.584 --> 00:15:40.393
the other person to its proper path.

00:15:40.393 --> 00:15:50.383
So once you are out of this idea of revenge,
you really feel very peaceful, extremely peaceful

00:15:50.383 --> 00:15:57.408
because this peace that you have within yourself
is not unnatural, it's not mental, but its

00:15:57.433 --> 00:15:58.913
just happens to you.

00:15:58.938 --> 00:15:59.907
It's all right.

00:15:59.947 --> 00:16:03.988
So what if they have said, they have done
anything wrong to us?

00:16:04.013 --> 00:16:05.855
Why should we bother?

00:16:05.945 --> 00:16:12.424
So many things are there which I can tell
you have worked out automatically.

00:16:13.725 --> 00:16:22.822
Now in Turkey they told Me that there is some
boy who is from England and he went and told

00:16:22.847 --> 00:16:27.944
the media something against Sahaja Yoga and
it was all published.

00:16:27.993 --> 00:16:33.643
But in the court he confessed that, "Whatever
I said was wrong."

00:16:33.668 --> 00:16:37.629
Nobody went and told him, nobody threatened
him, nothing happened.

00:16:37.654 --> 00:16:45.438
So from your point of view you must understand,
that you're not going to get into any mess

00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:52.958
of taking revenge of any kind, because you
belong to the Government of God.

00:16:53.076 --> 00:17:02.503
And this Government is extremely alert, very
genuine and also extremely efficient.

00:17:03.005 --> 00:17:10.396
And as far as you are concerned, you are a
citizen of that Great Kingdom.

00:17:10.575 --> 00:17:17.164
So what you have achieved is the citizenship
of this great Kingdom of God where you should

00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:19.315
feel absolutely secured.

00:17:20.492 --> 00:17:26.762
The man who is secure is never afraid, never
afraid.

00:17:26.787 --> 00:17:31.856
So you have also got rid of your fear.

00:17:31.881 --> 00:17:38.584
Man is in the - I don't know why he's afraid
of this and afraid of that, and worries about

00:17:38.609 --> 00:17:40.846
this and worries about that.

00:17:42.159 --> 00:17:49.316
It's something surprising how they worry about
their health, worry about their family, their

00:17:49.341 --> 00:17:54.686
children, their house, I mean all sorts of
things.

00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:58.401
But Sahaja Yogis don't, they don't.

00:17:59.185 --> 00:18:00.915
We have no worry.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.663
It all works out.

00:18:02.688 --> 00:18:04.322
Why should we worry?

00:18:04.566 --> 00:18:07.337
That instrument of worry is over.

00:18:07.392 --> 00:18:11.101
It's finished; I think it's gone out of order.

00:18:11.126 --> 00:18:20.446
And what you are now in a state where you
just have no time to worry, because you are

00:18:20.471 --> 00:18:21.794
enjoying yourself.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:33.980
This fear I have seen in people works so much
that so many diseases people get out of fear,

00:18:34.005 --> 00:18:40.110
so many diseases, specially most of these
left sided diseases people get out of fear.

00:18:40.135 --> 00:18:42.134
What is there to fear?

00:18:42.575 --> 00:18:48.264
This is like you beat the Mother Earth saying
that there's a snake.

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:53.765
There's no snake, but you may just feel that
way and you may go on with this fear.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:19:04.790
Anybody, any kind of a idea about a phantom
or someone or some sort of a big devil standing

00:19:04.815 --> 00:19:08.405
somewhere; it is all nonsense.

00:19:08.525 --> 00:19:10.975
For you, it doesn't exist.

00:19:11.261 --> 00:19:17.363
Say in the darkness you are walking so you
see forms and things and some people say I

00:19:17.388 --> 00:19:23.820
saw one on a tree, one some sort of a form;
it doesn't exist actually, it doesn't exist.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:27.988
But this fear in man makes him think like
that.

00:19:28.013 --> 00:19:33.519
He's afraid of this and afraid of that, and
then as a result, he loses his freedom.

00:19:33.544 --> 00:19:41.899
He becomes slave, slave to so many people
he's afraid of - that such and such man will

00:19:41.924 --> 00:19:50.214
harm me, such and such man will trouble Me,
and the whole concept of fear has ruined our

00:19:50.239 --> 00:19:51.878
family lives.

00:19:52.538 --> 00:20:00.253
For example, a wife is dominating, husband
is dominating, there's nothing to fear, nothing

00:20:00.278 --> 00:20:00.952
to fear.

00:20:00.977 --> 00:20:04.708
By fear only you play into their hands.

00:20:04.733 --> 00:20:08.843
So supposing the wife is dominating, just
make fun out of it.

00:20:09.533 --> 00:20:15.243
If you cannot make the fun in the presence
of say your wife or your husband, better make

00:20:15.268 --> 00:20:16.193
it outside.

00:20:16.218 --> 00:20:18.165
Take it, "Oh look at that."

00:20:18.794 --> 00:20:28.565
It is your special quality now that you can
really get rid of your fear completely.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.020
What is there to be afraid of wife or afraid
of husband?

00:20:32.045 --> 00:20:34.041
What can he do to you?

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:38.886
At the most he'll kill you, so what, you are
going to die in anyway.

00:20:42.093 --> 00:20:46.113
So the fear of death is another nonsense people
have.

00:20:46.138 --> 00:20:53.258
First time when I started My work everywhere
they asked Me, "What about death?"

00:20:53.328 --> 00:20:57.513
I said, but just now you are living; why are
you asking, "What about death?"

00:20:57.538 --> 00:21:00.967
So many people ask Me question, "What about
our death";

00:21:00.992 --> 00:21:02.813
 with why do you want to know about it?

00:21:02.838 --> 00:21:05.724
I'll tell you what about today, just now.

00:21:06.069 --> 00:21:13.899
So this is another mad idea - that we should
know about our death, what's going to happen,

00:21:13.924 --> 00:21:15.463
and whatever happens.

00:21:15.488 --> 00:21:17.287
Once you are dead you are finished.

00:21:17.312 --> 00:21:19.387
You don't have to do anything after that.

00:21:19.412 --> 00:21:25.197
So what's the use of knowing when, when you
will die, what will happen to you?

00:21:25.222 --> 00:21:27.372
Whatever has to happen will happen.

00:21:27.397 --> 00:21:30.737
We never ask, that when I sleep what will
happen to me, do we?

00:21:30.762 --> 00:21:36.382
And this is a permanent sleep and we worry
so much about it that we should know what

00:21:36.407 --> 00:21:38.512
will happen after death.

00:21:38.537 --> 00:21:44.385
One has to die at the time whenever it has
to die, because whatever is born has to be

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.556
dead.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:54.200
But you do know that you have got eternal
life.

00:21:54.225 --> 00:21:56.765
You can never die.

00:21:57.163 --> 00:22:09.338
Death is not this body disappearing; death
is where you are absolutely without any control

00:22:09.363 --> 00:22:11.361
of your soul live.

00:22:11.954 --> 00:22:21.752
Once you are a realized soul you have all
the control, all the powers: to take your

00:22:21.777 --> 00:22:27.417
soul wherever you feel like, to be born if
you like; if you don't want you will not be

00:22:27.442 --> 00:22:36.052
born, to be born with the people in the families,
in the communities wherever you like.

00:22:36.077 --> 00:22:42.777
There are many great souls I know that have
taken birth daringly into societies which

00:22:42.802 --> 00:22:50.692
are very much, I should say, deteriorating
and are in danger of getting destroyed because

00:22:50.717 --> 00:22:53.173
of stupidity they do.

00:22:53.198 --> 00:23:08.073
So this happening, that we are afraid of death,
is absolutely absurd for Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:08.098 --> 00:23:11.813
What is there to think even about your death?

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:19.460
There is nothing like death for you because
you have got eternal life.

00:23:19.485 --> 00:23:23.595
It's not that you continue with the same body.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:29.905
You may go on changing your dress but you
are living, you are aware, and you know even

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:37.217
if this body is not there-you will be there;
all the time, available for Sahaja Yoga, for

00:23:37.242 --> 00:23:42.792
anything that is to be done in the name of
reality.

00:23:43.229 --> 00:23:56.278
So you must know your position as eternal
being what is your work, what is your idea,

00:23:56.303 --> 00:23:57.970
what you have to do.

00:23:57.995 --> 00:24:07.026
So one has to get rid of this idea of death
because death doesn't exist for you.

00:24:07.051 --> 00:24:08.321
It's finished.

00:24:08.602 --> 00:24:16.432
Moreover, all such people who are afraid of
their death go on having insurances, this,

00:24:16.457 --> 00:24:22.011
that, all headaches, see, and ultimately what
happens?

00:24:22.543 --> 00:24:27.458
All these worldly things you leave here and
you depart.

00:24:27.483 --> 00:24:38.435
There is I don't think anybody could carry
even a little dust with that soul

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.038
which is departing.

00:24:40.654 --> 00:24:49.568
But in your case, when you people are no more
on this earth so called, then you don't carry

00:24:49.593 --> 00:24:52.060
all this material things because you have
already given up.

00:24:52.085 --> 00:24:54.105
You have no interest in them.

00:24:54.257 --> 00:25:04.357
You're not materialistic so your spirit is
free, and when you die what happens to you

00:25:04.382 --> 00:25:10.662
is a very simple thing - that you feel very
liberated, absolutely.

00:25:11.684 --> 00:25:19.741
And then you feel your freedom completely,
and you can decide what you want to do.

00:25:19.766 --> 00:25:26.618
It's all under your own guidance, your own
desire; everything works out.

00:25:26.765 --> 00:25:34.173
You don't feel that you have come out of your
body, and this is what should tell you that

00:25:34.198 --> 00:25:42.066
there should be no fear of death, but on the
contrary - it should be welcomed.

00:25:42.091 --> 00:25:50.021
Because you will feel much more liberated,
much more at ease.

00:25:50.046 --> 00:25:56.112
You don't have other problems that you have
to in any case carry on in this world so because

00:25:56.137 --> 00:25:57.267
of this body.

00:25:57.292 --> 00:26:03.487
Now see I have to take some medicines, I have
to take vitamins; don't have to take anything,

00:26:03.512 --> 00:26:05.051
don't need it.

00:26:05.684 --> 00:26:08.456
This body's finished is a very good idea.

00:26:10.706 --> 00:26:14.326
They're so troublesome it is you see.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.039
All the time despite the fact that you may
say that, "Oh I don't care for this body,"

00:26:18.064 --> 00:26:21.463
and all that, but this body won't leave you.

00:26:21.488 --> 00:26:26.368
This is the most sticky thing we have is our
body.

00:26:29.666 --> 00:26:38.023
So to forget about death should be the easiest
thing for you.

00:26:38.373 --> 00:26:41.923
We have broken many walls.

00:26:42.752 --> 00:26:53.182
As you know very well that the conditionings
we had, we have finished that.

00:26:53.262 --> 00:26:54.839
It's very surprising.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:59.895
I've seen people when they get their realization,
immediately after that

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.638
they start seeing around them.

00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:08.532
They'll immediately tell you what's wrong
with their religion, then they'll tell you

00:27:08.557 --> 00:27:13.540
what's wrong with their country; what's wrong
with their culture.

00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:16.635
It's through them I have come to know so much.

00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:20.085
I didn't know that this was so, but they themselves
told us.

00:27:20.085 --> 00:27:26.595
Now for example there's a French man, take
it - if a Frenchman gets realization, I mean

00:27:26.595 --> 00:27:29.945
you know everything about French.

00:27:29.945 --> 00:27:34.685
The things you could never even imagine what
sort of people they are; they will tell you

00:27:34.685 --> 00:27:35.685
everything.

00:27:35.685 --> 00:27:38.285
Same with the English I've seen.

00:27:38.285 --> 00:27:45.395
English they may, they laugh at themselves
all right, but actually when they become realized

00:27:45.395 --> 00:27:51.645
souls you see, they give you a complete picture
of English people: what sort of people are

00:27:51.645 --> 00:27:55.505
there, what's wrong with them, how they are
egoistical, this, that.

00:27:55.505 --> 00:27:56.505
I was amazed.

00:27:56.505 --> 00:28:01.675
I mean, I, I, I never knew so many things
which I came to know through Sahaja Yogis

00:28:01.675 --> 00:28:03.465
who got realization.

00:28:03.465 --> 00:28:08.715
Because they have seen all these things very
thoroughly and very closely and they knew

00:28:08.715 --> 00:28:12.339
what was it.

00:28:12.433 --> 00:28:23.423
Now when you become so cleaned, washed out
completely, mind completely cleaned out from

00:28:23.448 --> 00:28:33.375
all kinds of conditionings you see; you become
like a mirror, beautiful mirror.

00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:40.505
And in that mirror one can see complete picture
of the society in which you live, the complete

00:28:40.505 --> 00:28:45.763
picture of the government which rules you;
everything, so clear-cut.

00:28:45.788 --> 00:28:47.679
And it is absolute.

00:28:47.933 --> 00:28:49.664
It is not biased.

00:28:49.722 --> 00:28:54.487
For example you ask somebody, then he will
say, "What is your politics?"

00:28:54.512 --> 00:29:00.033
If I say My politics is I have no politics,
say, "What you have no politics, how can we

00:29:00.058 --> 00:29:01.708
exist without politics?"

00:29:01.733 --> 00:29:03.353
I have no politics.

00:29:03.378 --> 00:29:12.220
So they will go on asking questions to you
which are very much unknown.

00:29:12.245 --> 00:29:16.868
But for a realized soul, it's just the other
way round.

00:29:16.893 --> 00:29:25.333
Hes not only sees, but also shows and expresses,
very clearly.

00:29:25.358 --> 00:29:35.898
I've been amazed at the way people have been
really so reflective of the society into which

00:29:35.923 --> 00:29:40.393
they live and the country which they represent.

00:29:40.418 --> 00:29:45.455
So the identification is lost, complete identification
is lost.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.474
You don't feel identified much.

00:29:47.511 --> 00:29:49.748
You just see what's wrong with that world.

00:29:49.841 --> 00:29:58.001
Then also another point is that you start
seeing how you can help, what you should do,

00:29:58.001 --> 00:30:00.451
how you can work it out.

00:30:00.451 --> 00:30:06.511
And the importance of that becomes your main
thing in life.

00:30:06.511 --> 00:30:12.171
Everybody I see, yesterday the way you brought
all this flags and all that, behind that flag,

00:30:12.171 --> 00:30:18.291
I could see, all of you wanted that peace
should prevail in those countries, they should

00:30:18.291 --> 00:30:22.401
get all the joy and beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:22.401 --> 00:30:24.461
It's what a feeling it is.

00:30:24.461 --> 00:30:29.921
It's not like yourself becoming Sahaja Yogis
and sitting in the corner, no.

00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:38.171
They want to do it for that country about
which they are not identified, but without

00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:45.161
identification, they have that deep feeling
that they have to work out; correct it.

00:30:45.161 --> 00:30:49.761
It's a very different type of personality
you develop.

00:30:49.761 --> 00:30:55.981
Normally you see if you say a word against
somebody that, "See in your country they do

00:30:55.981 --> 00:30:56.981
like this.."

00:30:56.981 --> 00:30:59.591
"Oh what you're talking, what about your country?"

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:00.591
Immediately.

00:31:00.591 --> 00:31:02.471
They'll never accept.

00:31:02.471 --> 00:31:12.663
If you just try to even say one word against
them, their country or their government, which

00:31:12.688 --> 00:31:16.318
may be the most rotten government, but no
still, "What?

00:31:16.318 --> 00:31:19.028
We are all right."

00:31:19.028 --> 00:31:28.574
That kind of stupid identification, which
keeps you completely glued to that society;

00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:32.519
like some people will say, "No, no, I have
to go to the pub."

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:34.209
I say, why?

00:31:34.209 --> 00:31:35.452
Why you have to go to the pub?

00:31:35.477 --> 00:31:37.933
"That's our society; that's our culture.

00:31:38.079 --> 00:31:39.079
We have to go.

00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:45.867
We have to go to the pub, get drunk and fall
down, all of us together.

00:31:45.961 --> 00:31:49.099
That's the sort of thing we are; we can't
help it you see.

00:31:49.124 --> 00:31:50.370
This is what it is."

00:31:50.395 --> 00:31:53.975
You tell anybody that, why do you do this
like this?

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.355
What is the need to do?

00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:01.874
"Now, because I have to live in this society,
after all, after all I belong to this society

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:06.008
and I just can't do what I like."

00:32:06.033 --> 00:32:09.100
But when you get your realization, you can
do what you like.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:16.470
You can do what you like, because you only
like that is righteous, that is good, that

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.820
is constructive, that is helpful.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:23.480
So you can do whatever you like; after realization,
there's no restriction for you.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.330
All these restriction of, "don't, don't, don't,
don't" - these clearly enslave you.

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:32.290
I think it very much enslaves you.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:38.270
But in after realization, you are such a free
bird that nothing can enslave you.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:43.320
For example, there are many preachers who
preach - you shouldn't drink, you should not

00:32:43.345 --> 00:32:49.034
smoke, this, shouldn't take drugs, you should
do this, you should do that -

00:32:49.059 --> 00:32:51.416
but it doesn't stop.

00:32:51.626 --> 00:32:52.891
It doesn't help.

00:32:52.916 --> 00:32:58.829
People struggle, try everything, ultimately
they commit suicides, but they can't get rid

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:04.750
of those habits; while now you are so powerful
that nothing can stick to you.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:11.360
That's the purity of your character that has
come up; it doesn't allow any nonsensical

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.350
things to stick to you.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:20.700
I've heard of so many Sahaja Yogis telling
me, how their eyes have steadied down, how

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:26.890
they have become so righteous, how they have
become so pure and they can't understand.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:32.020
They said, "Mother is it Your power, Your
purity You have given us, or it is our purity

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.020
You have awakened?"

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.020
Of course yours.

00:33:34.048 --> 00:33:35.574
No doubt.

00:33:35.632 --> 00:33:44.561
All these things you have, and you become
aware of it, and thus you get absolutely misidentified

00:33:44.586 --> 00:33:49.981
I should say with all these nonsensical things,
and you don't like it.

00:33:50.006 --> 00:33:52.341
You just don't like it.

00:33:52.341 --> 00:33:53.742
And you go on criticizing.

00:33:53.742 --> 00:34:02.642
I've been to all these countries also before,
and I have met people who are very much identified,

00:34:02.642 --> 00:34:08.922
and diplomatically I was not suppose to say
anything whatsoever that would make them feel

00:34:08.922 --> 00:34:11.742
that they are doing something wrong.

00:34:11.742 --> 00:34:18.142
But after Sahaja Yoga, the same people are
telling us and making fun of the whole thing.

00:34:18.142 --> 00:34:20.611
For example, I've heard some Sahaja Yogis
talking to each other.

00:34:20.611 --> 00:34:26.372
He says, "You see my country, this is so stupid
thing going on."

00:34:26.372 --> 00:34:31.592
Another one said, "Nobody can beat mine; it's
much worse."

00:34:31.592 --> 00:34:43.301
Is a very common competition among Sahaja
Yogis going on.

00:34:43.301 --> 00:35:00.751
So that we have to see how pure we have become,
and in this purity anything that is dirty,

00:35:00.751 --> 00:35:08.942
murky, anything that will spoil this purity;
we don't like it.

00:35:08.942 --> 00:35:11.382
We don't like it.

00:35:11.382 --> 00:35:17.942
We are washed, cleaned, from inside, and won't
want to take anything like that

00:35:17.967 --> 00:35:19.919
within us anymore.

00:35:21.633 --> 00:35:29.132
Then I've seen also, the way people have become
so compassionate.

00:35:29.132 --> 00:35:35.452
Is very surprising how they have become compassionate
to each other.

00:35:35.452 --> 00:35:43.902
For example, there were two Sahaja Yogis,
they were not very happy with each other,

00:35:43.902 --> 00:35:46.801
not compatible; whatever you say that is.

00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:52.922
And I didn't know how to make them feel that,
"You see the other Sahaja Yogi's all right;

00:35:52.922 --> 00:35:54.952
doesn't matter after all, what is."

00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:57.102
"No I don't like this thing in him."

00:35:57.102 --> 00:36:01.127
And the another one would say, "I don't like
this thing about him."

00:36:01.152 --> 00:36:05.197
So it went on: "I don't like," he says, "I
don't like."

00:36:05.222 --> 00:36:12.382
I mean they were seeing each other's defects
or whatever you may call them.

00:36:12.382 --> 00:36:16.508
So I said, "All right now will you meditate
for some time?"

00:36:16.533 --> 00:36:20.006
Again, "Meditate, meditate."

00:36:21.102 --> 00:36:24.295
And I said, "Now, do you love me?"

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.899
She said I, one says, "I love You more than
he loves."

00:36:30.342 --> 00:36:35.402
I said, "Is difficult situation."

00:36:35.402 --> 00:36:47.140
How to make them understand now that you cannot
weigh your love; you cannot make a

00:36:47.165 --> 00:36:48.835
chart out of it.

00:36:48.864 --> 00:36:57.122
It is something within yourself, and if you
love somebody then you enjoy it.

00:36:57.122 --> 00:37:00.758
I mean you cannot qualify it; you cannot quantify
it.

00:37:00.783 --> 00:37:09.193
But this was going on with these two gentlemen
together, and I thought, "Now what to do?"

00:37:09.342 --> 00:37:15.466
They are very important, and still there's
no understanding between the two.

00:37:15.491 --> 00:37:20.001
So the Divine Power took over I think.

00:37:20.026 --> 00:37:24.639
One of them fell very sick suddenly, very
sick.

00:37:24.664 --> 00:37:30.914
And I had sent word also that, "You'll be
sick; be careful."

00:37:30.939 --> 00:37:39.324
But it was I mean they thought that the other
fellow might be trying to be funny or something;

00:37:39.751 --> 00:37:41.082
it was not understood.

00:37:41.082 --> 00:37:42.082
He was very sick.

00:37:42.082 --> 00:37:52.930
When he fell sick, then this one, the another
one, felt such tremendous love for him.

00:37:52.955 --> 00:38:02.190
It's something, nobody can explain, that he
went and sat with that patient for 24 hours,

00:38:03.582 --> 00:38:08.782
and said that, "If you need any money, I have
got."

00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:14.571
He paid for wherever he could pay.

00:38:14.571 --> 00:38:23.982
So this gentleman also was very sensible,
reasonable person on his own - felt this love,

00:38:23.982 --> 00:38:29.824
this affection, in this hard taskmaster, the
other one - and such understanding

00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:31.794
 grew up within them.

00:38:32.481 --> 00:38:42.391
It is I think, is the Divine's Play that they
were brought together, so close and such compassion.

00:38:42.416 --> 00:38:49.947
So the force of compassion within you is so
much, it's very subtle; you don't see.

00:38:49.972 --> 00:38:58.512
Because on mental level - I was telling them,
arguing, trying to pacify him, pacify him;

00:38:58.537 --> 00:39:01.868
like that was on - it would not work out.

00:39:01.893 --> 00:39:14.147
But when this force of compassion started
acting suddenly into one of them, the another

00:39:14.172 --> 00:39:26.147
one saw the compassion, the pure compassion,
and just they became great friends.

00:39:26.172 --> 00:39:32.162
So one has to feel the compassion within yourself.

00:39:32.258 --> 00:39:42.857
I've seen many a times that there are many
Sahaja Yogis and sometimes I have to correct

00:39:42.882 --> 00:39:44.292
them, or say something.

00:39:44.317 --> 00:39:51.041
Immediately, another one will say, "Mother
can You forgive him, You can't forgive?"

00:39:51.066 --> 00:39:52.148
I say I have forgiven.

00:39:52.173 --> 00:39:54.082
I am not doing anything.

00:39:55.161 --> 00:39:56.571
"Please forgive, please."

00:39:57.481 --> 00:40:10.061
I feel so happy to hear that, that in one
point, in one condition, when it comes to

00:40:10.061 --> 00:40:15.836
Sahaja Yogi, you support him, even against
Me; I feel happy.

00:40:15.861 --> 00:40:24.471
Shows that you are not only generous, but
you are filled with your compassion.

00:40:24.471 --> 00:40:34.051
So this source of compassion which is within
your being, in your heart, you have to just

00:40:34.051 --> 00:40:35.521
open your heart.

00:40:35.521 --> 00:40:40.902
If you open that heart, it's like opening
the Sahasrara.

00:40:40.902 --> 00:40:47.943
You'll be amazed how you can forgive people
and you can live with them.

00:40:47.968 --> 00:40:54.711
I've reports which disturbs Me many a times
that people are forming different groups,

00:40:54.711 --> 00:41:00.673
and having different ashrams, and they don't
come to the collective, and all that.

00:41:00.698 --> 00:41:02.785
I feel very much concerned.

00:41:02.886 --> 00:41:09.147
Now what is missing is, of course, there are
also some people who think that they must

00:41:09.172 --> 00:41:12.136
have a separate, their own organization, and

00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:14.684
why should they be in the collective, and all that.

00:41:14.709 --> 00:41:26.755
So that it is definite, that such a person
has not yet achieved that state of compassion.

00:41:26.979 --> 00:41:39.721
In the state of compassion, you like that
somebody tells you that, "Don't say anything

00:41:39.721 --> 00:41:41.991
to such and such person.

00:41:41.991 --> 00:41:44.092
I don't want you to say this."

00:41:44.092 --> 00:41:47.442
It's very, very joy giving to Me.

00:41:47.442 --> 00:41:52.201
Like we had one couple, they were quarrelling
throughout.

00:41:52.201 --> 00:41:55.041
They used to send Me letters after letters.

00:41:55.041 --> 00:42:01.922
Ah baba, was fed up; telephones after telephones,
both of them quarrelling.

00:42:01.922 --> 00:42:09.031
Quarrelling so much, I didn't know what to
do with them.

00:42:09.031 --> 00:42:15.021
So, I thought that it's better that they divorce
and finish it off.

00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:27.372
And I told them, separately, that, "You better
divorce each other and get out of it, but

00:42:27.372 --> 00:42:32.061
the complaints you have are such that they
cannot be solved."

00:42:32.061 --> 00:42:33.061
Said, "How?"

00:42:33.061 --> 00:42:41.882
I said, "You are saying that my husband doesn't
give me more time, he is always out, and he

00:42:41.882 --> 00:42:46.677
doesn't spend any nice moments with me, we
don't go out

00:42:46.702 --> 00:42:48.863
 and all these complaints are there.

00:42:49.554 --> 00:42:54.041
And the husband says that, she always troubles
me that I must take her out, and I must do

00:42:54.041 --> 00:42:56.051
this, and I must do that.

00:42:56.051 --> 00:42:57.922
I want to do it but I can't do it."

00:42:57.922 --> 00:43:02.292
So I said, "But when you take a divorce, you'll
never, can claim anything.

00:43:02.292 --> 00:43:05.592
Permanently, the husband is lost and you are
lost.

00:43:05.592 --> 00:43:07.781
So why do you want to do such a thing?"

00:43:07.781 --> 00:43:16.731
Immediately, know this compassion started
working, and then I put in a word, "Supposing

00:43:16.866 --> 00:43:23.222
any one of you is sick tomorrow, then who
will look after each other?"

00:43:23.222 --> 00:43:25.623
This just put them out.

00:43:25.648 --> 00:43:33.582
You know such little, little moments in life,
come in, in the life of Sahaja Yogis I've

00:43:33.582 --> 00:43:43.102
seen, that suddenly this heart opens, and
with that - they combat all these petty, nonsensical,

00:43:43.102 --> 00:43:48.907
ideas which keeps them out; out of each other
and out of the collectivity.

00:43:49.052 --> 00:43:56.902
What gives me the greatest enjoyment is to
see how you love each other, care for each

00:43:56.902 --> 00:44:01.167
other, joke with each other and dance with
each other.

00:44:01.225 --> 00:44:04.541
This is the greatest thing that I enjoy.

00:44:04.566 --> 00:44:08.721
I don't want to get rid of this idea of Mine.

00:44:08.721 --> 00:44:15.821
Despite the fact, so many times I find it's
hard to believe how could Sahaja Yogis behave

00:44:15.821 --> 00:44:26.875
like this, and try to create rifts, and distances
between the people who are realized souls.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:34.540
Because realized souls anywhere in the world,
you should see them, they respect each other.

00:44:34.565 --> 00:44:41.319
Not only respect, cared and never talked ill
of another realized soul.

00:44:41.344 --> 00:44:42.344
Never.

00:44:42.973 --> 00:44:47.744
I don't know if you have known about the private
lives of these saints.

00:44:47.882 --> 00:44:55.051
But in India as we have had so many of them,
when you see them - how they have behaved

00:44:55.051 --> 00:45:05.041
towards each other, the way they have looked
after each other - it's so beautiful; it's

00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:06.261
so noble.

00:45:06.261 --> 00:45:14.682
As if they care for the other Sahaja Yogi,
or yogi, or a realized soul, than for themselves.

00:45:14.682 --> 00:45:28.402
And the whole thing makes you feel like in
a new world, of new people, who care for the

00:45:28.402 --> 00:45:34.720
feelings of others, and not - what they want
to say, or what they want to have, or they

00:45:34.745 --> 00:45:37.335
are something special.

00:45:38.092 --> 00:45:45.491
Also in Sahaja Yoga, you have come; you have
lost your specialities.

00:45:45.491 --> 00:45:50.290
Some of them think they're very special.

00:45:50.347 --> 00:46:00.922
Supposing I call some lady to put say alta
on My Feet, she starts thinking she is very

00:46:00.922 --> 00:46:05.496
special, but I just call her because I know
she has a horrible agnya and

00:46:05.521 --> 00:46:07.528
I have to clear it out.

00:46:12.376 --> 00:46:17.385
And when somebody told Me, "Mother she thinks
something very special," I said, "Really,

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:18.946
what makes her think like that?"

00:46:18.971 --> 00:46:23.321
"Because You call her to put some alta on
Your Feet."

00:46:23.321 --> 00:46:30.096
I said I just called her that she has such
a horrid, ugly, agnya that she will trouble

00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:34.421
everyone, so I want to clear it.

00:46:35.197 --> 00:46:44.084
So, either I should have told her that you
are a very egoistical, horrible and all the

00:46:44.109 --> 00:46:48.990
words that are possible, otherwise she won't
understand.

00:46:49.015 --> 00:46:50.815
It's so surprising.

00:46:51.261 --> 00:46:59.731
There is one lady who was really very nasty
to her in-laws and everybody in India, and

00:46:59.731 --> 00:47:01.031
she came to see Me.

00:47:01.031 --> 00:47:02.762
I called her.

00:47:02.762 --> 00:47:04.961
I actually scolded her.

00:47:04.961 --> 00:47:08.261
I said, "What business you had to behave like
this here?

00:47:08.261 --> 00:47:12.872
Your father who was such a racist, you never
said a word against him, and why are you talking

00:47:12.872 --> 00:47:14.761
so much against these people?"

00:47:14.761 --> 00:47:15.902
I scolded her.

00:47:15.902 --> 00:47:21.158
She went out and told, "Oh look at Mother
has called me; nobody is allowed to see Her."

00:47:21.183 --> 00:47:23.026
I said, "What's this?"

00:47:25.511 --> 00:47:32.481
It's a very funny situation with people I
sometimes feel the way they think they're

00:47:32.481 --> 00:47:35.352
something special, and they should make themselves
special.

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:38.602
It is becoming really difficult.

00:47:38.602 --> 00:47:51.422
Now just to show My love, to appreciate something
people have done, and if you give some present

00:47:51.422 --> 00:47:59.011
to that person, or you show concern about
that person, because he's done some good work

00:47:59.011 --> 00:48:03.951
or something, he starts thinking he's something
special.

00:48:03.951 --> 00:48:13.202
I mean is an impossible situation, because
I expect that if I have done anything good

00:48:13.202 --> 00:48:22.051
to that person, or in any way suggested My
concern about a person - that person has to

00:48:22.051 --> 00:48:31.402
become a very good Sahaja Yogi; in the sense
the most humble, and honest, and loving person.

00:48:31.402 --> 00:48:35.051
Otherwise it has no meaning.

00:48:35.051 --> 00:48:42.932
No use being good to anyone if that means
that person jumps into hell.

00:48:42.932 --> 00:49:00.531
So this one is also another idea of speciality,
that they have lost their sense of speciality.

00:49:00.531 --> 00:49:10.221
When a drop becomes the ocean, it has become
the ocean, but it's not the drop anymore.

00:49:10.221 --> 00:49:16.612
If anybody thinks, "I am a special person,"
then know that you are no more an ocean; you

00:49:16.612 --> 00:49:18.571
are still the drop.

00:49:18.571 --> 00:49:25.588
Because unless and until you are the drop,
how can you feel that "I am something special"?

00:49:25.732 --> 00:49:30.083
So you have lost your speciality.

00:49:30.083 --> 00:49:38.853
You have lost it, because all these ideas
of speciality comes from your past.

00:49:38.853 --> 00:49:48.573
One lady I met once, long time back, she was
a very rude, proud, arrogant woman.

00:49:48.573 --> 00:49:54.242
So this was in Delhi, where people are very
conscious of their husband's jobs, and this

00:49:54.242 --> 00:49:56.603
and that.

00:49:56.603 --> 00:50:04.344
I didn't even know the destination, or even
the designation of My husband.

00:50:04.957 --> 00:50:08.903
So she was very rude to Me.

00:50:08.903 --> 00:50:13.900
I said what's the matter with you, why are
you so rude, what's the problem?

00:50:13.931 --> 00:50:15.490
She said, "You don't know?

00:50:15.515 --> 00:50:18.975
I'm the wife of such and such."

00:50:19.059 --> 00:50:23.798
You're the wife or the husband?

00:50:23.823 --> 00:50:28.410
"I'm the wife of such and such."

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:32.830
So she asked Me, "What are you doing here?"

00:50:32.855 --> 00:50:35.049
I said, "I am a housewife."

00:50:38.692 --> 00:50:42.456
Then My husband came.

00:50:42.693 --> 00:50:44.257
She said, "Do you know him?"

00:50:44.282 --> 00:50:46.769
I said, "Yes I know, why?"

00:50:49.683 --> 00:50:54.013
I thought there must be something wrong there
also.

00:50:55.950 --> 00:51:00.518
So she said, "No I just want to know.

00:51:00.543 --> 00:51:04.132
How do you know him?"

00:51:04.157 --> 00:51:07.707
As if I was some criminal or what?

00:51:08.071 --> 00:51:09.803
I said, "He's My husband."

00:51:09.828 --> 00:51:13.158
"Oh my God, he's your husband?"

00:51:13.284 --> 00:51:14.664
What happened?

00:51:14.895 --> 00:51:19.705
As if ten serpents had bitten her.

00:51:20.889 --> 00:51:28.099
Maybe, maybe her husband was at a much lower
position than my husband, maybe something

00:51:28.099 --> 00:51:30.469
which I am not conscious of it.

00:51:30.469 --> 00:51:38.494
But this is what is "I'm something special."

00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:47.340
This stupid idea of being special has to be
completely negated in Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:47.396 --> 00:51:48.603
Not mentally.

00:51:48.675 --> 00:51:49.715
Not mentally.

00:51:50.025 --> 00:52:00.914
Mentally if you're again saying, "I'm not
special, I'm not special," like a mantra,

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:06.111
you'll become much more.

00:52:06.154 --> 00:52:12.982
Because you'll say, "I've said this mantra
23,000 times.

00:52:13.502 --> 00:52:19.166
Who can say like me?"

00:52:21.844 --> 00:52:28.122
So this idea - I'm something special, I'm
something great, I'm something out of the

00:52:28.147 --> 00:52:36.166
blue, something superior to others - just
vanishes.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:42.252
Like as I said, you are a drop in the sea.

00:52:42.277 --> 00:52:51.040
You have become the ocean, but you are no
more a drop, to have any relative value system.

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.589
There's no relative value system.

00:52:53.589 --> 00:53:01.659
There is no system by which you can say that
I'm higher or he's lower; all that has created

00:53:01.659 --> 00:53:04.820
all the problems of the world.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:12.676
See from our caste system in India, the social
systems in the West, the racialism in the

00:53:12.701 --> 00:53:23.419
West, also self consciousness of "my religion
is better, yours is worst, we are the best"

00:53:23.621 --> 00:53:26.719
- all these things have created problems.

00:53:26.719 --> 00:53:29.250
It has done no good.

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:32.059
It has failed and failed and failed.

00:53:32.084 --> 00:53:39.632
So in Sahaja Yoga at least don't bring this
disease anymore - that, "I'm better, we, our

00:53:39.657 --> 00:53:41.292
country's better..."

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:51.629
This speciality you should drop, and real
beauty of your personality will show.

00:53:51.629 --> 00:53:58.409
For that you don't need a special scale, you
don't need a special body, you don't need

00:53:58.409 --> 00:54:03.949
a special, what you can call, a glamorous
look.

00:54:03.949 --> 00:54:06.513
What you need is a beautiful heart.

00:54:06.538 --> 00:54:13.455
And I tell you, it's the beautiful heart that
attracts; nothing else.

00:54:13.548 --> 00:54:16.746
It's the beautiful heart that you want to
have.

00:54:16.782 --> 00:54:22.621
I've known people nay many like that.

00:54:22.646 --> 00:54:26.086
There was one gentleman who divorced his first
wife.

00:54:26.459 --> 00:54:30.796
She maybe not be so good looking, maybe ugly,
or whatever it was.

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:38.060
Then he married another good-looking woman,
and he ran away from the house.

00:54:38.085 --> 00:54:39.684
So I asked him why.

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:45.053
You didn't like that woman because she was
ugly or whatever it was, so why have you now

00:54:45.078 --> 00:54:46.789
running away from this one?

00:54:46.898 --> 00:54:48.503
"She has no heart.

00:54:50.819 --> 00:54:54.682
She has no heart."

00:54:54.707 --> 00:55:03.835
And this is what you have - a very great,
generous, beautiful, dharmic heart.

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:12.990
You have got it as a present from the Divine,
and which you must respect.

00:55:13.015 --> 00:55:24.097
Should be proud of it, and enjoy it, as you
should enjoy your generosity.

00:55:24.122 --> 00:55:30.201
You should enjoy the way all this nature is
enjoying itself.

00:55:31.517 --> 00:55:38.408
To be very meticulous about things, to be
all the time correcting others, is a headache.

00:55:38.637 --> 00:55:41.150
It's a headache.

00:55:41.183 --> 00:55:46.628
The best thing is to correct yourself, and
laugh at yourself; that's the best way you

00:55:46.653 --> 00:55:47.653
can do it.

00:55:48.016 --> 00:55:52.417
Everybody has some funny things about themselves.

00:55:52.821 --> 00:55:56.305
I also have; I must confess.

00:55:56.330 --> 00:56:02.179
And I enjoy them because I think I try and
try, but always I forget.

00:56:02.204 --> 00:56:05.895
For example spectacles, I always forget them.

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:09.407
Before coming see I must always forget it.

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:16.094
I tell Myself that I need it, I should take
it, must remember; but invariably I forget,

00:56:16.119 --> 00:56:19.469
and I don't know why.

00:56:19.469 --> 00:56:23.984
I, I, I can't do without it, but still I forget.

00:56:24.009 --> 00:56:25.761
There's so many things.

00:56:25.992 --> 00:56:29.071
For example, I don't know how to count money.

00:56:29.096 --> 00:56:33.126
If you may give me 100 rupees, I'll count
it 200 rupees.

00:56:33.743 --> 00:56:38.011
I tell you I, I'm good at mathematics, but
I can't count.

00:56:38.036 --> 00:56:40.718
I don't know how to sign a check; can you
believe it?

00:56:40.743 --> 00:56:41.743
I can't sign.

00:56:41.883 --> 00:56:45.313
You have to write the check for Me, otherwise
I can't.

00:56:45.338 --> 00:56:53.918
And somebody asks Me say for say 100 rupees;
I'll give him a big 500 and forget about it.

00:56:54.095 --> 00:56:56.194
And that person says, "Mother You gave me
500."

00:56:56.219 --> 00:56:58.056
No, no, no, I gave you 100 only.

00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.989
"No, You gave me 500."

00:57:00.014 --> 00:57:01.580
I went home and found out.

00:57:01.605 --> 00:57:02.431
It's all right.

00:57:02.518 --> 00:57:07.441
After all, if he's dishonest - he's dishonest;
if he's honest - he's honest.

00:57:07.466 --> 00:57:13.246
So why to worry about how much money you gave,
and this thing, that thing, meticulously you

00:57:13.271 --> 00:57:16.029
see, finding everything like this?

00:57:16.054 --> 00:57:20.239
And I've seen with all these meticulous people,
they always fail.

00:57:20.449 --> 00:57:24.149
Because you see this brain plays some tricks
on them.

00:57:24.149 --> 00:57:27.937
For example, there was one fellow who told
Me that,

00:57:27.962 --> 00:57:30.653
 "The size of your car is such and such."

00:57:30.678 --> 00:57:31.678
All right then.

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:35.452
"So the size of the garage will be such and
such."

00:57:35.477 --> 00:57:37.089
I said all right.

00:57:37.305 --> 00:57:41.385
So, when we build the garage, the car won't
get in.

00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:54.611
I said such a meticulous architect, and such
a well-known person who has got so many awards,

00:57:54.636 --> 00:57:58.015
this, that - how could he make such a mistake?

00:57:58.174 --> 00:58:00.651
But I still didn't understand it you see.

00:58:00.676 --> 00:58:03.889
Now he said, "Now you better buy a smaller
car."

00:58:08.291 --> 00:58:14.874
I said at least now you measure this garage
in a proper way, otherwise again if I buy

00:58:14.899 --> 00:58:17.186
something it won't enter in.

00:58:17.239 --> 00:58:22.259
So you see what I'm saying, we are so particular,
so meticulous.

00:58:22.284 --> 00:58:27.035
Now see these little, little flowers I see
them here; they're not meticulous.

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:33.631
They are growing on their own freely, everybody
gets the sun's rays, and they're quite happy.

00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:40.313
But the way we are particular, those people
are very particular, are headaches to themselves.

00:58:40.338 --> 00:58:43.857
And then ultimately they find that it's not
so.

00:58:43.882 --> 00:58:46.773
You have lost that; you have lost that meticulousness.

00:58:46.798 --> 00:58:52.899
I know of a Sahaj Yogini; she was running
a shop, and she said, "Mother I knew each

00:58:52.899 --> 00:58:57.067
and everything, and I knew each and every
price, and everything I knew in this shop,

00:58:57.092 --> 00:59:00.914
but since I've got realization; I've forgotten
everything."

00:59:01.431 --> 00:59:04.139
So are you happy or unhappy?

00:59:04.164 --> 00:59:05.533
"I'm very happy."

00:59:05.558 --> 00:59:06.326
Why?

00:59:06.351 --> 00:59:09.663
"Because now I'm making a big profit."

00:59:09.715 --> 00:59:11.257
Profit is the main thing.

00:59:11.282 --> 00:59:14.172
Why should you try to remember each and every
thing?

00:59:14.197 --> 00:59:23.219
So it is to be very meticulous, to be very
systematic, very, world is, if you see around

00:59:23.219 --> 00:59:24.898
- no tree is systematic.

00:59:24.923 --> 00:59:27.983
It is unsystematically systematic.

00:59:28.403 --> 00:59:34.277
Some leaves are this side, some are that side;
some branches are on that side.

00:59:34.302 --> 00:59:41.699
There's no system, because then you become
a military, if you form a system.

00:59:41.699 --> 00:59:44.111
So in Sahaja Yoga there is no system.

00:59:44.136 --> 00:59:46.245
We are beyond time.

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:51.747
We are beyond all kinds of systems; we have
no system.

00:59:51.772 --> 00:59:57.113
All of our system is, "What is the unigion
within ourselves?"

00:59:57.138 --> 01:00:03.943
Like these two hands, they have no system
built in nothing, but they move.

01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:10.077
Especially Italy if you want, both the hands
move like that all the time in Italy.

01:00:10.102 --> 01:00:15.229
And I don't know what it means, but they all
do the same thing.

01:00:15.759 --> 01:00:17.214
There's no system built in.

01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:20.524
Nobody said them that do these gestures and
all that.

01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:26.829
But they do it, and do it naturally, all of
them together - without any system.

01:00:27.096 --> 01:00:34.455
So to build up mental systems is wrong and
against Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.409
Some people have written to Me, "Mother we
want to translate your transcriptions, do

01:00:39.434 --> 01:00:40.965
this, do that" and plans.

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:41.975
I said forget it.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.502
Forget.

01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:51.040
Because if you start planning you see, you
will definitely, definitely fall into the

01:00:51.065 --> 01:00:54.355
trap of systems.

01:00:54.654 --> 01:00:58.940
You'll have to follow systems; this system
is good, that system is good.

01:00:58.965 --> 01:01:00.188
Why not have this way?

01:01:00.213 --> 01:01:06.121
And because I don't, I don't say that it's
wrong, because you have been used to systems.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:14.752
Especially in the West people have over systematic,
over systematic, in everything.

01:01:14.777 --> 01:01:21.537
Like they'll have courses you see built up,
then the spoons, then the forks, then the

01:01:21.562 --> 01:01:26.239
how to move, and what to eat, and how to eat.

01:01:26.264 --> 01:01:27.709
I mean it is too much.

01:01:29.068 --> 01:01:34.239
If you have to eat food, it's straightforward;
you can eat it with your hands.

01:01:35.165 --> 01:01:36.699
No system needed.

01:01:36.724 --> 01:01:43.467
For all these systems and norms are too much
in the West, and you should really try to

01:01:43.492 --> 01:01:44.521
them curb down.

01:01:45.565 --> 01:01:52.361
As a result they had anti-culture and all
that nonsense; another kind of stupidity where

01:01:52.386 --> 01:01:55.894
they were building up another kind of a system.

01:01:56.081 --> 01:01:58.856
See then they said, "We are hippies now."

01:01:58.881 --> 01:01:59.643
All right.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:06.073
So they must have hair never washed, never
clean with lice in their heads, and must be

01:02:06.098 --> 01:02:11.834
all like, you can say, the shankara style
you see.

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:15.462
So all of them have to have that.

01:02:15.487 --> 01:02:16.610
Again system.

01:02:18.182 --> 01:02:21.883
There's no variety; one hippie means another
the same.

01:02:21.908 --> 01:02:24.489
You cannot make them out one from another.

01:02:24.489 --> 01:02:27.868
If somebody puts say a ring here - everybody
will put.

01:02:27.868 --> 01:02:34.658
If he puts a ring here - everybody will put;
without any brains, without any understanding.

01:02:34.658 --> 01:02:40.180
And they talk of individuality; of personality
-where is the individuality?

01:02:40.205 --> 01:02:48.843
There's no individuality, because you take
to anything that your gang, you can call,

01:02:48.868 --> 01:02:55.449
or you can call the crowds that take it, very
fashionable.

01:02:55.449 --> 01:03:04.179
In India if you say if it is very fashionable,
it means it is very expensive, and very beautiful

01:03:04.179 --> 01:03:11.179
and is, I mean is very elite, elite word.

01:03:11.179 --> 01:03:15.459
But when I said, "This is very fashionable,"
means everybody likes it.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:19.908
It could be punky thing or anything, it's
fashionable.

01:03:19.933 --> 01:03:20.933
Finished.

01:03:21.105 --> 01:03:22.213
It's the fashion.

01:03:22.238 --> 01:03:30.357
Means you do not have your own idea, your
own personality, your own individuality.

01:03:30.491 --> 01:03:38.944
In Sahaja Yoga, you too are not bound to any
fashion, no fashion.

01:03:38.969 --> 01:03:42.326
If like; wear this, wear that, whatever you
like.

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:49.617
If you fit do what you like, you can wear
whatever you like, but you, as I said again

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:54.260
that you will govern yourself, you'll be your
own guru, you'll be your own master, and you'll

01:03:54.285 --> 01:04:03.336
do whatever is good, whatever is decent, whatever
the Deities will like, will just do it that

01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:07.302
way because now you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:04:07.327 --> 01:04:11.509
So the life becomes so much easier, so much
easier.

01:04:11.656 --> 01:04:17.585
You don't worry about things which are not
there, and you are not also worried about

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:19.564
the things which are there.

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:26.111
Because you think now, you see something,
all right I have got these knives now; I must

01:04:26.136 --> 01:04:29.569
keep this one for somebody.

01:04:29.594 --> 01:04:31.404
I must give it to someone.

01:04:31.429 --> 01:04:34.379
So I got a ring which was quite big.

01:04:34.461 --> 01:04:38.850
Was thinking whom should I give this; who
has got thick fingers?

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:44.526
So I started looking at the fingers of everyone
you see, whosoever has a thick finger I'll

01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:45.948
give him this one.

01:04:45.973 --> 01:04:48.788
I mean the thought was just the other way
around.

01:04:48.813 --> 01:04:53.750
Supposing you are not a Sahaja Yogi then you'll
say, "Oh Ma, such a big thick finger, why

01:04:53.775 --> 01:04:56.447
not take out some gold and use it, sell it
off?"

01:04:56.472 --> 01:05:03.230
Or else you see, "You can take out the stone
from here."

01:05:03.255 --> 01:05:08.396
I mean all kinds of nonsensical things you'll
think, but you'll not think that you better

01:05:08.421 --> 01:05:11.686
give it to somebody because you can't wear
it; it's too big for you.

01:05:11.711 --> 01:05:13.886
Why not give it to other?

01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:15.177
What's wrong?

01:05:15.202 --> 01:05:19.692
After all, it is not fitting you, so give
it to other.

01:05:19.804 --> 01:05:22.355
But this is only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:22.455 --> 01:05:33.855
I've seen people, very kind, very, very kind
people who have been very sweet to each other

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:40.161
and exactly what the other person wants, they'll
buy and give it to that person.

01:05:40.322 --> 01:05:44.334
Or may say, oh no I have one, I'll give it
to you.

01:05:44.475 --> 01:05:46.675
They do it like that.

01:05:47.757 --> 01:05:50.498
It's all the time thinking about others.

01:05:50.902 --> 01:05:52.636
What should I give?

01:05:52.661 --> 01:05:54.230
What should I do?

01:05:55.377 --> 01:05:59.636
It's the expression of that joy, the compassion
within you.

01:05:59.776 --> 01:06:05.958
You use your matter for that, all the time,
all the time.

01:06:05.983 --> 01:06:10.123
Like somebody's house was burgled in Canada.

01:06:11.178 --> 01:06:15.467
So she writes to Me, "Thank God my house is
cleaned out now, I didn't know what to do

01:06:15.492 --> 01:06:16.645
with it - the junk".

01:06:17.263 --> 01:06:23.183
So you see this kind of an attitude comes
in that if you have to do, give to someone,

01:06:23.208 --> 01:06:30.160
then give it to someone who is a Sahaja Yogi
to express your love.

01:06:30.185 --> 01:06:36.033
But normally people will do whatever is the
junk in the house, you see whatever is rotten,

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:38.605
finished, that they will give as a present.

01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:44.259
But when you are a Sahaja Yogi you want to
give something really very special, because

01:06:44.284 --> 01:06:52.894
the whole being has become so beautiful - just
like a flower I should say which wants to

01:06:53.157 --> 01:06:58.643
give fragrance to others; all the time the
fragrance of your compassion and love, affection

01:06:58.668 --> 01:07:00.897
and security.

01:07:02.057 --> 01:07:12.268
It's a new age, that what they say, but I
would say it's a new human beings that are

01:07:12.293 --> 01:07:13.902
before Me.

01:07:13.927 --> 01:07:22.077
And all this newness has so many beautiful
facets that they really sparkle like diamonds,

01:07:22.102 --> 01:07:25.375
no doubt about it.

01:07:26.074 --> 01:07:39.025
My only blessings to you is that you grow
in it and grow in it and become greater and

01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:45.489
greater people; never thinking that you are
better than others; never thinking that you

01:07:45.514 --> 01:07:47.165
are special than others.

01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:51.211
This will definitely soothe you down completely.

01:07:51.236 --> 01:07:54.280
Somebody might have hurt you somewhere, doesn't
matter.

01:07:54.305 --> 01:07:57.094
Somebody must have scolded you, doesn't matter.

01:07:57.144 --> 01:08:04.564
What is your capacity is to - love another
person, and to be affectionate and kind.

01:08:05.567 --> 01:08:15.248
I'm really amazed how these 25 years have
passed with all kinds of stupid problems,

01:08:15.248 --> 01:08:18.655
and nice things and - such a mixture.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:25.200
And all those things have never disturbed
Me; I was never disturbed.

01:08:25.423 --> 01:08:31.712
I used to act sometimes that I am angry, or
sometimes I used to say things which I should

01:08:31.737 --> 01:08:36.623
not have normally said, because it was needed
to be said.

01:08:36.648 --> 01:08:49.312
But, on the whole, like sitting in a very
big ship you can say, we all are elevated

01:08:49.337 --> 01:08:53.433
into the realm of Divine Love.

01:08:53.458 --> 01:08:56.557
And this is what one has to enjoy.

01:08:56.582 --> 01:09:05.737
One person if he has that love and compassion,
and that pure love, then that person can emit

01:09:05.762 --> 01:09:15.109
it to others, and the record of this compassion
is extremely beautiful; which cannot be described

01:09:15.134 --> 01:09:16.112
in words.

01:09:16.137 --> 01:09:18.706
Like yesterday I couldn't speak.

01:09:18.731 --> 01:09:22.836
In what words I could put My feelings?

01:09:22.861 --> 01:09:32.825
I thought there are no words yet created on
this earth to express My deep feeling that

01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:39.853
how you people have taken Sahaja Yoga so well
and have understood it.

01:09:40.106 --> 01:09:41.106
May God bless you all.

01:09:59.055 --> 01:10:02.978
Sahasrara Puja is a short one.

01:10:03.487 --> 01:10:12.509
We don't have a very long puja for Sahasrara,
because you know Sahasrara breaks in no time.

01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:22.179
So it's not a very long puja, but it's very
deep, and again ultimately the last chakra

01:10:22.204 --> 01:10:26.301
which is opened out is here, is the heart.

01:10:26.582 --> 01:10:34.583
So in the Sahasrara Puja our hearts open out,
that's the main thing, and that is what one

01:10:34.608 --> 01:10:38.279
has to enjoy, opening of your heart.

01:10:38.882 --> 01:10:46.477
Don't worry about any Deities, about any rituals,
any this and that, but just open your heart.

01:10:47.639 --> 01:10:52.242
We are not bound by anything; just open your
heart.
