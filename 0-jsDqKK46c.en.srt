1
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:42,540
Today is the second day of our new journey into
the battlefield. We have to win people with

2
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:49,790
love, compassion, affection and dignity.
When we say it’s a Vishwa Dharma, it’s

3
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,420
a Universal Religion we belong to, first and
foremost thing, the essence of that, is peace.

4
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:14,989
The peace has to be within, to begin with.
You have to be peaceful within yourself. If

5
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:24,810
you are not peaceful, if you are playing tricks
with your ego, if you are just satisfying

6
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,810
yourself saying that you are peaceful, you
are sadly mistaken.

7
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,810
Peace is to be enjoyed within yourself. It
is to be felt within yourself. So do not give

8
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:54,380
wrong satisfactions to yourself, do not give
false notions to yourself. Don’t cheat yourself.

9
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,940
Peace has to be felt within yourself, and
if you are not feeling that, you shouldn’t

10
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,620
come and ask me, “Mother, why I am not feeling
it.” Because I am not going to tell you

11
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,620
that something [is] wrong with you. You have
to work it out that you should feel peaceful

12
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:26,850
within yourself.
It is not that if you have too much of silence

13
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:33,850
outside, you feel peaceful. The peace has
to be within yourself. You have it. Your Spirit

14
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:44,310
is absolutely peaceful – Avyagra, without
restlessness. There is no restlessness in

15
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:52,250
your Spirit. Absolutely peaceful and steady.
It is for you to feel it. It is not for anybody

16
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,979
else to certify you. This is one thing. Secondly,
when I am telling you something, you think

17
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:04,680
I am not telling you. It doesn’t register
in your brain. You think I am telling it to

18
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,680
X, Y, Z but not to you. You are not in it.
That’s another sign [that] there is no peace.

19
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:18,710
Because there is no peace, there is no registration.
Whatever goes into your head, that is going

20
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,110
to work out.
But what I find [is] that people [who] have

21
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:31,110
concave personalities, then they receive it.
Those who have convex personalities, do not

22
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:43,009
register anything . The registration is so
poor that, whatever I say doesn’t have any

23
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,800
effect on them. Otherwise, whatever I say
is a mantra. It should have direct effect

24
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,800
on you, and you should feel that effect, that
penetration within you. But as if it is for

25
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:04,080
somebody else, as if it is not for you. This
shows there is no peace within you.

26
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:21,919
Only the peace within can register whatever
is auspicious, whatever is nourishing for

27
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,680
your growth. So try to make peace with yourself.
Do not fight with yourself, “Why should

28
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,590
I do it?”, “I am so bad!”, “I should
not have done it!” – all these we should

29
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:47,419
not do. Try not to fight with yourself, first
of all.

30
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:51,669
Then you fight with me, “Why am I like this?
Why should it be like this with me? Why is

31
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:56,900
it I catch? Why. . . .?.” How am I to answer
such a question? It is very aggressive. I

32
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,160
think it is very aggressive attitude of many
Sahaja Yogis to come and ask me such a question,

33
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:08,160
“Why…?” Because I can’t tell you what
is wrong with you because it is not in my

34
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,729
culture. You should find yourself what is
wrong with you . But it’s not “what’s

35
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:21,729
wrong with you” is the problem. What is
right with you is the attitude. Whatever is

36
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:29,130
right with you, put your foot on that, establish
yourself on that point. And then develop yourself

37
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:36,830
higher.
Peace is the keynote, as I said, for universal

38
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:47,639
growth of this Religion.
It is disturbed by many things. Firstly, as

39
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I said, by yourself. You shouldn’t have
funny ideas about yourself. People have very

40
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:01,500
funny ideas. I see Sahaja Yogis, as soon as
they get realisation, or something better

41
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,339
happens to them, they start telling others
how to do meditation, how to stand up, how

42
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:13,339
to give bandhan, how to do this and that.
It’s very very poor, is very low level.

43
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Try to assimilate within yourself. First grow
yourself That growth itself, will tell others

44
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,920
how one should be. Your own character, your
own temperament, your own nature, your own

45
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,580
behaviour. All this will tell others that
this is a great man and they will try to follow

46
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:45,940
your example. Example is the best teaching.
When the tree is small, even if he says “I

47
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:52,940
am great,” nobody is going to sit under
a dwarf tree! But when it is a big tree you

48
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,600
can see the shade and everybody knows it’s
a big tree and they can come and sit under

49
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,600
that. You don’t have to tell. In the same
way, when you grow, you don’t have to certify

50
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:13,709
that “I am great”, it just works.
Now the peace within expresses, first of all,

51
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:28,570
[as] peace with others. That is the first
sign of manifestation of peace. Such a person

52
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:37,820
doesn’t use harsh words, doesn’t use cruel
words. But he’s also not a person who is

53
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:48,240
ineffective. He’s very effective, using
very sweet and nice words. Maybe he begins

54
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,500
by using harsh words, then he mellows down
and comes down to a position where he is effective

55
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:03,500
as well as he is very mild and sweet.
Such a personality has to be developed – outside.

56
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:15,380
So, peace with your friends, peace with Sahaja
Yogis. If you cannot be peaceful with Sahaja

57
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Yogis then you are no good. Absolutely no
good. When you meet another Sahaja Yogi you

58
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,360
can’t bark like dogs at each other, can
you? You leave three Sahaja Yogis together,

59
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,339
you end up with a big barking system. They
can’t manage within themselves. If there

60
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:47,339
are hundred, then it’s alright. But you
can’t leave three and four here and there.

61
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:56,220
So the peace should be with your brothers
and sisters. They are all born out of My Sahasrara

62
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:06,980
and nobody has the right to insult, to be
sarcastic. Saying things which are harmful.

63
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:15,630
That’s no friendship, that’s no friendship.
It is a kind of a very subtle enmity that

64
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:25,660
you are carrying on in your hearts. That cannot
be forgiveness. If you say sarcastic things

65
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:36,070
to others, you are not in the culture of Universal
Religion. You should be respectful. The more

66
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:48,000
respectable you are to each other, the better
it would be.

67
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don’t know how to tell you this. But say,
there is a Sahaja Yogi, you shouldn’t call

68
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:02,550
him like as you would call any Tom Dick and
Harry. Like there’s someone going. “Eh

69
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:11,390
Mr. X, come here!” Now people don’t even
say Mister. Please try to use their surnames

70
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:23,370
would be better. Mr. So, Mr. So Mr. So. .Would
be better.

71
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,430
Because this modern style of not using the
surname has brought down the respect for each

72
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:38,040
other. But I think, Sahaja Yogis should try
a new method and suggest to Me even better

73
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:45,040
methods, how to address each other, in such
a way that you respect others. That respect

74
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:54,630
will create that peace within each other.
Suddenly you come out with remarks. Very nasty

75
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,370
remarks they are. There’s no sense in it.
That’s not our culture. We belong to Universal

76
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:08,370
Religion, how can it be that culture?
So, when you try to be peaceful with your

77
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:22,459
brothers and sisters, try to be extremely
respectful. When you write letters to each

78
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,360
other, you say “My dear brother in Sahaja
Yoga Such and Such.” I have seen all communists

79
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,360
do that. Any body who belongs to any party
does that. It’s a kind of a respect they

80
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:44,899
have. You can’t talk like street people
and ordinary people because you are really

81
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:02,200
extraordinary, and all that is extraordinary
has to be expressed through you.

82
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,620
As I am talking to you of this new culture,
let us understand how in many nations, people

83
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:26,209
have adopted cultures and cultures. Japan,
I know, has been affected, very much, by modernisation.

84
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:36,730
But Zen taught them certain kind of culture
in which, supposing, you see two Japanese

85
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:42,910
have a car and they break each other’s car,
then they don’t say anything. They come

86
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:47,060
out of their car, one will bow to another,
the another will bow to another, and get into

87
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,839
the car and get out.
Then if they have to claim something, they’ll

88
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,800
go to the courts, but there they don’t fight,
because what is the need? And I asked Japanese,

89
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,980
“How do you manage it?” So they said,
“But what is the need to fight there on

90
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,070
the street? Because after all, if it is to
be paid, it’s the insurance that is going

91
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:12,519
to pay. If the car is broken, alright they
are going to pay us. Why to shout at him?”

92
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:18,899
It’s very sensible and practical, I think.
Why to waste your breath for nothing at all?

93
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,760
You are not going to get anything.
But I have known people who drive, and they

94
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:28,449
are abusing every person who comes across
on their driving. I mean, really it’s curse

95
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:35,449
of life, the way some people drive! And the
same way they drive in their own lives. All

96
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,779
the time cursing this, “That one is like
this, this one is bad, that one is doing like

97
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:46,040
that”. Even in Sahaja Yoga. They think they
have a right to criticize each and every person

98
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,810
except for themselves.
So to keep this peace with others, be on an

99
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:57,240
apologetic mood. “I hope I haven’t done
this mistake.” “I hope I haven’t hurt

100
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:04,240
you.” “I hope I haven’t put your things
in a wrong way.” Like that. Be on an apologetic

101
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:10,949
mood.
You can find that among Indians. Indians have

102
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:16,350
that kind of a problem, they are more on apologetic
mood. Sometimes, it is impossible to convince

103
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:23,350
them. I will give you an example. We went
down to Sangli, and you were so full in the

104
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:32,269
morning and the food was not ready. So they
said that “We cannot have our food because

105
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:39,109
it is late now and it will be later, so better
we sleep off.” They felt very hurt, you

106
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:46,029
know. They thought that it was their mistake.
Now, it is registered that we haven’t given

107
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:51,659
food to them, it is a horrid thing we have
done. And then I had to convince them that

108
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:55,369
they are no way hurt, they are happy that
they are not eating, they have too much of

109
00:17:55,369 --> 00:18:00,289
food. “No, but still it will be registered
in our name that we didn’t offer them food

110
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:06,350
and they slept without any food.” It was
impossible to convince them till the end,

111
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,830
they were all the time feeling apologetic.
You see in Indian culture, we have something

112
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:17,539
very great, as Japanese, as I told you, that
we are more on the apologetic style. Never

113
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:23,879
on the aggressive. Never trying to find faults
with others, but we find faults in what way

114
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:30,879
we have failed, how we have failed. This is
something to be learned from Indians, if they

115
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:41,269
have retained their culture at all. It’s
actually in their blood.

116
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:55,109
So that is how, our culture is going to be
such that we will express complete peace within

117
00:18:55,979 --> 00:19:02,340
ourselves. And you must know that you are
in one body, active. You are active cells

118
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,340
in one body. All the cells of the body are
never active. But those who are active have

119
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:14,340
to be at peace with each other, otherwise,
what will happen to that poor body? So try

120
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,320
to make peace.
The second thing you can do to make peace

121
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:27,320
is to talk less. Whenever there is a quarrel
or anything, just keep quiet. You see, it

122
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:32,840
will have better effect. If two persons are
quarrelling, never try to solve it, but just

123
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,840
keep quiet. Quiet is very important. More
to be silent. But it should not be another

124
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:48,149
extreme like English culture, that they just
don’t talk, whatever it is. They don’t

125
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:55,229
talk, but, they think too much. You must keep
quiet with the feeling that ‘May God bless

126
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:06,309
these people some sense.” 
It should not be ice frozen sea, but peace
which is effective. Peace that is effective.

127
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:24,979
So in this new culture, we have to be extremely
peaceful people. And that peace should be

128
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:32,220
expressed on your faces. People should understand
that you are peaceful. That’s why I say,

129
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,470
if you are neatly dressed, your hair are neatly
put, people will feel alright. Otherwise if

130
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:47,609
you reach some person with dishevelled hair,
you know he gets disturbed as it is! “God

131
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:53,210
knows what has happened? From which quarrel
this man is coming? Somebody must have pulled

132
00:20:53,210 --> 00:21:00,210
his hair, or must have something gone wrong
with him, that the way he is dishevelled.”

133
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,539
So if you are neatly dressed, people are not
put off so much, because they think that “No,

134
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:11,909
no, this cannot be, because, you see, after
all, he never had a quarrel. He’s just coming

135
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:18,909
peacefully from his house.”
In our culture, neatness in very important.

136
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:26,070
Neatness of thought, neatness of mind, neatness
of body, neatness of behaviour. How you do

137
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:37,950
things neatly is very important in our culture.
That’s very, very important! Which may look

138
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:44,090
very funny to some people. Because, whether
you hold the fork this way or that way makes

139
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:51,090
no difference to Me. It doesn’t matter how
you hold your fork or knife on a table. That’s

140
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,479
not so important.
But it’s definitely it’s important how

141
00:21:56,479 --> 00:22:03,479
you hold the Aarti, how you hold the Puja
things, how you hold my photographs. How you

142
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:14,759
hold the things that belong to other Sahaja
Yogis, how you respect the things that are

143
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:21,759
auspicious.
So that is what one has to have within yourself.

144
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:32,820
The neatness, of piousness, of auspiciousness,
of holiness. That is to be done with very

145
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:41,429
great care and understanding, and with that
weight of auspiciousness you should walk.

146
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:48,429
With that weight of auspiciousness. You are
auspiciousness walking on this earth, yourself.

147
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:59,129
You are peace on this earth. But the way peace
is put into this vessel has to be clean, has

148
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:13,739
to be neat and has to be placed in such a
way that nothing spills out.

149
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:25,059
So to have peace, the best way to put your
mind right, is to think of good things. Think

150
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:33,210
of the flowers, not of the thorns. What good
things others have done to you. What good

151
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:40,389
things there are. What are the beautiful moments
you have had, and count your blessings. Count

152
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:47,849
your blessings. Otherwise you cannot create
peace.

153
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:54,849
[Mother tells someone off in Marathi]
You need not pay attention to everything like

154
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:10,080
that. Keep your attention at peace. Keep the
peace inside, with your attention inside.

155
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:22,830
Actually, if you really allow all my words
to go inside your brain, I’m sure I’ll

156
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:39,200
achieve the results but with a convex mind,
it’s very difficult. Just suck in!

157
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:53,389
The another aspect of peace is never try to
support anything that is boisterous or which

158
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:07,649
is destructive. Anything that is destructive
is never to be supported. But anybody who

159
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:17,269
is being tortured or aggressed or dominated,
is to be protected and supported. If you have

160
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:33,919
the strength of peace, you can do it just
by standing there. You don’t have to fight

161
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:42,739
for your peace. But if it comes to that…
A person like Hitler when he came, people

162
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:53,399
had to fight for their peace.
Now, the second part of our culture has to

163
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:08,109
be Bliss. People should see bliss working
in us. People should feel there is bliss.

164
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:17,099
If a person is blissful, he looks blissful.
He emits, bliss. He radiates it. He doesn’t

165
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:31,369
look a miserable, unhappy creature, who is
all the time grudging, grumbling or worried

166
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:38,960
about little petty things here and there.
And nobody has the right to disturb anybody’s

167
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:52,580
bliss. [If] somebody is in a blissful state,
try to copy that person and become that. But

168
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:01,830
people get jealous of such people who are
blissful and try to disturb! That’s why

169
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:07,429
so many saints were tortured, because they
were so blissful and happy people.

170
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:14,429
We have to enjoy our bliss within, that is
important. Perhaps you are not aware of the

171
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:24,460
bliss that you have. Not at all aware. Never,
never before there were so many people who

172
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:38,109
got realisation. Never before, in the history,
that Adi Shakti Herself came on this earth

173
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:45,109
to solve your problems. Never before, that
people of very ordinary effort, of very little

174
00:27:53,879 --> 00:28:00,879
seeking, of very little understanding have
been given realisation like this. It’s like,

175
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:13,460
sometimes, if you see, like a stone becoming
a diamond suddenly. You can cut a diamond

176
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:22,580
from a diamond.
Such blissful state you are in. It’s tremendous

177
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:30,279
bliss has come. It’s so effective. I myself
don’t know when I see them. I’m really

178
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:41,769
surprised how it is working.
Bliss can only come through gratitude. Only

179
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:50,399
through enlarging your heart with gratitude.
Bliss is the reward of gratitude. The gratitude

180
00:28:54,139 --> 00:29:01,139
which is not just worldly or just spoken lip-service,
but is from the heart, is from the heart,

181
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:18,269
gratitude of the heart. And the blissful people
are never jealous of others because what is

182
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:29,279
greater than bliss? Bliss has so many dimensions
that you go beyond the realm of cause and

183
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:38,679
effects. All the angels, all the ganas are
there to help you. You know that it works

184
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:45,009
out. This way it works out, that…. But you
take it for granted. You don’t have that

185
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:52,009
effect of the bliss in you when you know this
has happened, that, has happened. What a bliss!

186
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:59,169
You cross your hearts when you feel blissful.
Cross your hearts and feel that, just see.

187
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:06,119
Feel the bliss like this – cross your hearts.
Feel the bliss! Tremendous bliss is within

188
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:13,119
us. How much it has happened to us that God
has been so kind. Will you please put your

189
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:27,249
hands across those who are sitting down there,
please! The other lady also. Where is she

190
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:34,249
looking? You are sitting on a chair, must
you look at every person who is coming? There

191
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:50,070
is no need!. Feel it! May God bless you.
So this bliss when you find everywhere, in

192
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:08,269
a little thing also you find there is bliss.
Zen taught that to people. They saw bliss

193
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:18,899
in seeing only a moss, a little bit of moss,
and you see the moss and you say, “0 God,

194
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:25,659
what a beautiful piece it is! ” God has
created little moss, and that moss has all

195
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:32,659
that little little tentacles, and that bliss.
But those who are vain people can never feel

196
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:41,469
bliss. Vanity kills bliss. Ego kills bliss.
Once Shivaji was building a huge fort. And,

197
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:55,739
there it so happened that he got into ego.
He felt, “See because of this work, so many

198
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:04,330
people are employed.” [Then] his Guru Ramdasa
appeared on the scene. He himself is the controller

199
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:14,039
of ego, because he was the incarnation of
Hanumana. So he came and he said “Alright,

200
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:20,349
I want you to do one thing for me”. He said,
“Yes Sir, what do you want me to do?”

201
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:25,999
He said, “You break this boulder that is
lying here, such a big boulder, bit by bit.”

202
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:32,999
So it started breaking when people hit it.
And inside came a little stone which he took

203
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:42,409
up just like a coconut in his hand and he
broke [it]. And there was water and there

204
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:51,269
was a frog inside. And he realised, Shivaji,
that, “if God has created this frog, He’s

205
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,629
also given him water. Who am I to have this
ego?”

206
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:09,629
So the bliss came into him, that God has provided
me with everything. It’s just a red-carpet

207
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:21,099
treatment for me. What have I done? Nothing.
It is so beautiful!

208
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:28,099
How many have got this bliss? Have sympathy
for them. Have compassion for them, those

209
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:38,289
who do not have.
But bliss comes to you through your confidence,

210
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:48,339
If you have no confidence in yourself, bliss
cannot be. And the worst thing against confidence

211
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:55,190
is – “Then what should I do? Then how
can I get it? Then why not I have?” – is

212
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:02,190
the worst. You fighting yourself all the time!
You are that, sitting on that, and still if

213
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:13,240
you are saying, “Why shouldn’t have it,”
so what to answer? I mean you just want to

214
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:20,240
ask because you have to ask? It’s there.
Why are you asking? Just feel it!

215
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,960
If that works out, that you feel where you
are sitting, then you’ll be surprised that

216
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:43,329
you are at peace with yourself, and there
is bliss.

217
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:50,329
Last of all, in this culture, you Have to
behave like people who have authority. You

218
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:04,819
have the authority of your Spirit. You are
authorised. You have the Spirit. Those who

219
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:10,589
are in authority never try to show off. Because
they are in authority, what is there to show

220
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:17,589
off? Only mad people show off, you see.
If somebody puts a label on the head “I

221
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:29,990
am Inspector General of Police”, people
will say that – take him to lunatic asylum.

222
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,760
In the same way, some people say, “I am
Sahaja Yogi. What do you say? I can do what

223
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:47,760
I like!” Then where should we put him? Your
authority is your Self, your own being. People

224
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:01,710
should see in you what you are. You don’t
have to carry labels with you that, “I am

225
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:09,099
Sahaja Yogi such and such!” – X Y Z number.
criminal No. 5, criminal No. 10! You are authorised.

226
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,000
Authority shows on your face. But now you
are actualised on the authority.

227
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You see, all the authorities are artificial.
For example, somebody today is Prime Minister,

228
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:31,079
may become a beggar on the street. Could be.
In democracy everything is possible. Same

229
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,029
in any authoritarian governments. So today,
you might be something at the height, you

230
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:42,260
might just go down. But a Sahaja Yogi will
remain a Sahaja Yogi. You are authorised and

231
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,829
actualised. Means whatever is your authority
is part and parcel of your being, you are

232
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:51,339
that. Like you are a human being, you are
a human being. Now you can’t grow tails

233
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:58,339
even if you want.
So now you are authorised, actualised, completely

234
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:09,150
moulded Sahaja Yogis. Like the sandalwood
– sandalwood is not to be told by taking

235
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:21,450
a vow “oh, it is sandalwood”. It is sandalwood
because every part of it (microphone stops

236
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:30,700
working for some time, Mother makes some jokes
about Indian electricity problems)…has the

237
00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:56,549
fragrance of sandalwood. Every part of you,
every bit of 

238
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:07,210
you must have the fragrance of Sahaja Yoga.
So you are not only actualised, you are perfected.

239
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:26,819
You are perfected.
So you must have the dignity of that authority

240
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:36,799
in you. And dignity is very humble dignity.
Dignity is never arrogant. The sign of dignity

241
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:55,740
is humility. I told you a story about a person
who had gone out and he went and asked a blind

242
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:13,319
man, a saint, if he had seen anybody going
this way. So the saint said “Yes, you are

243
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:22,769
the king, I know Sir. Your servant was here
first, and then your Minister came, and now

244
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:29,920
you have come.” He was amazed, because he
was blind. How could a blind person see these

245
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:39,349
things? He said, “I could make out from
the humility.”

246
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:46,349
When your servant came, he said, “Eh you
blind man! Have you seen somebody going this

247
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:55,410
way?” When your minister came he said, “Have
you seen someone going this way?” But when

248
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:03,950
you came, you said “Sir, I am sorry to ask
you such a question, but did you hear somebody

249
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:11,519
was passing this way?”
This is what it is. Humility is the sign.

250
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:27,269
How you talk to others, immediately people
will know that you have the authority from

251
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:34,269
God. See the humbleness of Divine. How it
is trying to please you, and amuse you, and

252
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:53,250
make you happy, in the nature, also in the
lectures! (referring to the way the microphone

253
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:15,150
stopped working). Alright?
So now we’ll have our Puja. I hope You have

254
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:28,250
understood the Culture of your Universal Religion.
Please try to adopt it.

255
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,450
May God Bless you.
