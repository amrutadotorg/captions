00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.540
I bow to all the seekers of truth

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:43.500
at the very outset I have to say we
should know what is the truth everybody

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:53.340
is seeking the truth but they have no
idea as to what they should find there

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:04.890
is an urge within us because these times
are special and we are seeking but still

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.320
we don't have a clear-cut idea as to
what we should seek and what we should

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:28.220
achieve after our seeking now I would
like to refer to all the great books on

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:41.220
religion about truth they all have said
that who have to know yourself knowing

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:51.000
yourself is the point and that you have
to become the spirit it said in all

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.450
these intelligence but though we can
find that these regions are not really

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:11.280
doing that they are not getting able to
give you the truth and that's why

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.090
there's so much of conflict so much of
fights going on there are all real

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.970
religions no doubt and the essence of
every Lydian is the same despite all

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:32.910
that they are fighting in the name of
religion how can that be it can be

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:41.910
explained very well that if you have
lost over way we can go into opposite

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.240
directions

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.730
so when we know we have to know
ourselves and that is our goal of life

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:04.980
that is how we are going to improve on
our life as such that has been not so

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:15.480
clearly explained but where there is an
arrangement with in a sonata is being

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.220
told by most of them and that are in
mint as must have been told to you lies

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:33.450
in the triangular bone three and a half
points of energy which is divine which

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.470
can connect us to the all-pervading
power of truth which is a very subtle

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:50.459
energy and when that happens you get
connected with that power and that power

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:57.060
starts flowing through you and you can
feel it on your fingertips that power

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:07.410
flow this is a fact we have to first
verify before denying it if it could

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:18.080
happen to you all that you can feel this
all-pervading power on your fingertips

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:26.910
then it's an experience it's not just by
giving you a big lecture or telling you

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.000
about something fantastic but
actualization most important thing is

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.610
the actualization is the becoming of
your being the spirit this has to happen

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:54.340
all kinds of acrobats people may tell is
absolutely I must say

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:11.820
is a false pretext no amount of acrobats
are necessary it is such such means is

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:19.360
spontaneous it is within you all of you
have this power all of you are capable

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.830
of becoming the spirit but you must
understand what you should expect what

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.240
you should pick up unless and until you
have proper value system about it

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:43.260
nothing can be explained and you can be
mislead by all other nonsensical thing

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:51.570
of course you can't pay for it because
it's a living process of your evolution

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.780
now you are at a human awareness but
it's not subjective you have to rise

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:06.789
higher higher into the realm of
spirituality it's not spiritualism but

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:13.660
spirituality where you become the spirit
the master it's not difficult at all I

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:23.610
assure you it's not difficult America
has been somehow the last last place

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.139
because I came long time back to begin
with but I found people were running

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:40.120
after all kinds of business nonsensical
people when I gave up I said I'll go to

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:47.710
America after nine years and then I came
and gradually I started understanding

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:56.099
that they are seekers they are really
seekers not that they are in any way

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:04.150
hypocritical but it is the way people
are enticing them and taking them under

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.900
their own control
that they cannot see the point and the

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:17.610
point things you can't do anything about
a person may come and tell you you must

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.490
get the task give me all your property
all your money and I'll give you two

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:32.060
pair of clothes to wear and so many have
done that by doing this kind of nonsense

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:44.700
are you going to enter inside yourself
is it possible just think of it so many

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:50.220
people have come here telling you all
kinds of stories in your humble seeking

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:57.990
you have been mislaid and I feel very
sorry for it now try to understand that

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:06.990
you have been very special people as
human beings and that you have to become

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:16.229
the super human being we can call the
greatly evolved soul we have so many we

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:21.450
had so many and those we had we called
them by different name they were called

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:32.339
as Sufis and rick masters but they are
not intelligible normally to people

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:37.380
because unless and until you have the
awareness which is enlightened by your

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:45.770
spirit you cannot understand what they
are talking about now the time has come

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:54.209
for all of you to get your realization
you have been seeking for ages now and

00:08:54.209 --> 00:09:01.740
it is already describing books that the
day will come the time will come they

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:10.110
call it as Kali Yuga is the worst start
that is now at this time people who are

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:18.550
seeking God in the hills and dales will
get into proper family life

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:26.410
and they will get their server ization
through this Kundalini awakening now in

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:31.600
the name of Kundalini also lots of
nonsense has been said which is

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:43.930
surprising how people accepted that a
Kundalini can be dangerous and a person

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:53.040
who gets Kundalini awakening will be
very much harmed now she is your mother

00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:00.880
Kundalini is your exclusive model she
knows each and everything about she

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:08.500
knows about your false and so your
aspirations everything is recorded in

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:15.310
her and she is extremely careful when
she gives you the second birth and she

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:21.040
takes up all the problems upon herself
she doesn't bother you she doesn't

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:29.890
trouble you and she's the one who looks
after your second birth again I say is

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:36.970
the actualization actualization of
baptism you can call it but it is not

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:44.589
the way they do its actual ization it
happens that this rises passes through

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:50.260
six centers and pierces through your
fontanel bone area and you do feel on

00:10:50.260 --> 00:11:00.520
your hands fingers and out of your head
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost this

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:08.290
has to happen otherwise whatever story
is one matter you shouldn't believe it

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:18.880
has to show results now these centers
that we have all these seven centers are

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:27.590
responsible for our
physical mental emotional and spiritual

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:39.370
me so many people get cured many people
have problems mentally they get here and

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:44.440
spiritually you get endowed with the
absolute knowledge absolute knowledge

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:50.480
not knowledge that we learn in the
schools or colleges but the knowledge

00:11:50.480 --> 00:12:01.880
which is absolute for example if you
want to know about someone you can ask a

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:10.490
question and you'll be amazed if the
question is yes then you start getting

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:19.850
the cool breeze flowing fast but if it
is no or it is wrong then you might get

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:33.710
little tingle or might get very hot from
those persons who are to be tested it's

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:41.060
a very very interesting precise and a
scientific method now if there are

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:46.190
doctors i would like to tell that you
get in control with the parasympathetic

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:52.400
nervous system luckily there's going to
be a big conference with me with the

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.950
doctors in New York I know what r
association it is called and I don't

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:08.180
know all right now in that they are
convinced now that what I am saying is a

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:17.200
fact and that helps helps you get cured
by yourself and you can also cure others

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:24.640
there's no need to have these horrible
modern diseases that you are afraid of

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:32.850
you can just find out about it in no
time apart from that

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:43.380
that you just know how to treat others
how to cure others how to help us out

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:51.910
but apart from that what you get is a
spiritual place and the spiritual

00:13:51.910 --> 00:14:00.190
blessing is this that you get the peace
in your heart surprisingly when this

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:07.360
Kundalini Rises she some are other by
joining with the divine power

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:15.540
all-pervading power assumes a
personality which is extremely pure

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:27.130
extremely benevolent extremely tolerant
and extremely true them all your enemies

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:40.120
that we call like anger lust greed all
these anyways just drop and you are no

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:48.670
more in the entanglement of those anyway
and you become a free person absolutely

00:14:48.670 --> 00:15:02.069
a free person above all you are so
beautiful you become such a nice person

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:14.550
that established your peace now normal
human beings what do they do they react

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:20.920
the reactor t see they were telling me
that still there is time people are

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:26.620
still coming doesn't matter you can come
late there's no don't come just now all

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:34.180
right but I don't know how to react and
that's why when I came visit mother

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:40.360
still you look very relaxed I said I
never reacted to this so you don't react

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:48.220
by not reaction what happens that the
thoughts that come to you count from the

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:53.380
future and the past and you are lost in
those thoughts because you are jumping

00:15:53.380 --> 00:16:00.040
on the cusp of these thoughts when the
Kundalini Rises the thoughts are like

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:09.579
this she along gates those thoughts and
a space is created which we call it as

00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:18.640
pause or William in that state you
become absolutely peaceful you don't

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:24.339
think anymore we call it thoughtless
awareness that young girl described that

00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:31.420
means you watch anything just as a
witness see everything as a witness see

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:37.810
there's a bit nice carpet here I am
seeing it now supposing it belonged to

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:43.720
me if I was normal I would have said oh
my god i don't know how are they going

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:51.370
to keep it in case this belongs to
somebody else i would appreciate it and

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.570
I'll say oh I must buy this how much it
will cost I hope is insured and all

00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:05.110
kinds of but if I am they realized
person then I just watch it without

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:13.299
thinking and the joy that the artist has
put into this carpet enables you to

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:21.730
enjoy enjoy without reaction and this
state we call it aha was da where a

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:30.400
person becomes absolutely one with
himself complete and when he looks at

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.790
anything he doesn't react he sees he
becomes the witness you become just the

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:46.130
witness of the whole your memory
improves your ideas about creation

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:54.860
anything I mean you become an extremely
extremely I should say creative person

00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:02.390
and you don't develop the pride you
don't ever fall suit but you just enjoy

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:08.780
creating something human being is the
most beautiful useful thing and the most

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:16.160
beautiful thing that divine has created
but we don't know what we are that's why

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:22.460
always it is said know thyself know
yourself unless and until you know

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:30.590
yourself how can you say I hate myself
or I do I do that actually the beauty

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:44.930
lies within you and is to be expressed
through these divine vibration now the

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:50.650
health improves no doubt so many have
improved their health but i have seen in

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:56.720
london in the beginning so many boys
were taking drugs give it up overnight I

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:03.020
never say don't give up I don't say
don't if you say don't then David half

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:09.340
of them will run away let them play let
them get their realization then

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:15.680
automatically the whole thing drops out
and you shoot out out of that and you

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:23.030
become the real personality thus you
know the reality because you are not any

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:29.270
more contaminated by your ego or your
super-ego these thoughts come to you

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:34.910
from your ego or super you go meaning
your conditioning you are noble you're

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:44.420
absolutely free and you see everything
in its real position this kind of thing

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:52.610
happening was already destined has been
already prophesized that is going to

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:57.410
happen
in those days and so if you can come

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.790
here this side we have chairs

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.260
alright

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:15.229
so this is how we are going to become
ourselves and we will know what we are

00:20:15.229 --> 00:20:24.169
and what we are capable of our
capabilities are fathomless but unless

00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:31.399
and until we are connected how can we
act for example this instrument if it is

00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:37.099
not connected to the mains it is
ruthless in the same way you are to be

00:20:37.099 --> 00:20:42.889
connected to the mains is very important
for that you don't have to do anything

00:20:42.889 --> 00:20:49.209
it just works spontaneously within you
and you get your self-realization

00:20:49.209 --> 00:20:56.599
without any doubt actually I must have
given thousands of lectures all over the

00:20:56.599 --> 00:21:03.169
world and there's no end to it now I
would like you people to ask me some

00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:09.999
questions which I would like to answer
if you have any

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:22.150
there any questions you could raise a
hand

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:42.000
the thing is if you can do without the
photograph nothing like it but you need

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:50.679
something to support and that's why
people use the photograph if you don't

00:21:50.679 --> 00:22:02.250
need it it's all right but you will find
you will need it all right

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:16.090
that's my job I will do it all right
it's very simple how does a mother earth

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:22.220
sprouts the seed how does she is
innately built in in her that power

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:32.380
isn't it what is gather

00:22:40.399 --> 00:22:48.599
alright very good question Paramatma is
the God Almighty alright and his power

00:22:48.599 --> 00:22:57.149
is the ADI Shakti is the power that has
done all the creation everything while

00:22:57.149 --> 00:23:04.949
Paramatma is the one who is just a
spectator of the whole thing crystal

00:23:04.949 --> 00:23:12.679
they call it while Adi Shakti the one
who does all the creation and everything

00:23:12.679 --> 00:23:22.589
now permata is in your heart reflected a
spirit and Kundalini is reflected on

00:23:22.589 --> 00:23:28.589
your in your triangular bone and
sufficiently I Receptus reflection is

00:23:28.589 --> 00:23:38.029
the poodle oh you will get absolute
knowledge everything

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.890
get that

00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:05.470
what should come first

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:10.920
what should come first what the
Kundalini awakening or dissolving the

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:17.910
jealousy no no Kundalini Awakening is
the one by which all these things

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:37.680
happened automatically there's no need
in sahaja yoga there's no need to work

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:45.210
it out the negative forces themselves
run away ninety-nine percent in one

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:53.460
person maybe it still sticks but
otherwise 99% they all run away with the

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:58.560
light of the Kundalini with the
Enlightenment of the Spirit on your

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.160
attention

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:21.659
yeah of course no doubt you only on the
contrary you become multi-dimensional

00:25:21.659 --> 00:25:37.379
personality you try you cannot do it if
you are doing something wrong you cannot

00:25:37.379 --> 00:25:42.359
do it after Kundalini awakening because
you see what is destructive for you and

00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:49.649
what is constructive or so you don't do
it you just don't do it I told you just

00:25:49.649 --> 00:25:59.609
now that overnight people gave up drugs
I didn't tell them is the light if you

00:25:59.609 --> 00:26:03.570
are sitting in the darkness you don't
know where are you but if there's like

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:09.200
you know everything is like that is
enlightenment i am talking them

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:24.500
just to desire that you should get your
self-realization you must have a strong

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:32.080
desire yes madam

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:53.740
everything everything it is controlled
you don't have to do

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.730
because of practicing Christian religion
she feels that she's going to help

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:23.850
correct and does not mean that by
practicing now I was also born in a

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:32.090
Christian religion and I know that how
Christianity was just opposite of Christ

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:40.860
but just a minute but after realization
you are enlightened and you see the

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:47.100
beauty of every religion and the essence
of every religion and then you also

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:58.710
understand that you are capable yourself
of following a spiritual path without

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:05.340
any difficulties nothing destructive
nothing wrong nothing manipulated it's

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.740
your own you become your own master

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:37.590
those who are met and whose I have
nothing to say

00:29:07.399 --> 00:29:21.210
I don't want to do that once the use is
done through some spirits I thing yes

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.509
madam

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:49.519
so many forces away from that yes it's
correct but just now just now I promise

00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:54.529
you that you will get your realization
and then you will see all these forces

00:29:54.529 --> 00:30:06.940
with drop off all right the decay and
substance that I selected slicking

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:39.240
yes this means left side is caught up
what is this written this letter that

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:47.360
means left side is not all right but it
can be put right

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:09.010
said this is a special time

00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:22.480
he is called as Kaliyuga and also this
is the time of Last Judgment and at this

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:33.700
time one has to be very careful because
you are going to be judged whether you

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:41.619
take to truth or not if you are still
with falsehood you are just you will

00:31:41.619 --> 00:31:48.220
judge yourself nobody needs to judge you
by so many things will happen that will

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:59.279
realize there's something wrong 11

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:20.860
I didn't give me any joy I had to give
him advice but he did say that let our

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:28.120
country be free then you can start your
sahaja yoga program not before that that

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:35.700
was his idea that we are not yet free to
propagate anything

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:58.370
very good question you don't have to
assess no number of times you have to do

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:05.150
it under once it is enlightened it is
enlightened but we have problems still

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:11.740
there so the Kundalini goes back to
correcting sometimes so we have here a

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:18.560
proper follow-up they call it and after
that we have centers where you can go

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:24.530
all so nobody will charge any money and
they'll find out what's wrong with you

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:32.360
and they'll try to tell you what is to
be done it happens with very few but

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:41.920
you'll enjoy going to the center because
it is all enjoyment there free of charge

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:55.370
they will tell you you have to meditate
that they will tell you how to meditate

00:33:55.370 --> 00:34:01.910
and if you follow it for 10-15 minutes
at the most and it works out and you can

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:08.900
grow because after all is first
germination of the seed you see there

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:15.860
but it has to grow and some people grow
so fast I'm surprised of times that at

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:20.500
the very first meeting only they become
great people

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:38.460
dorman no it does it does not but if you
try not to pay attention to its proper

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:47.050
alignment or proper development then it
will become static at that point but it

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.830
never goes back

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:10.440
Kevin
I see me

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:38.270
you can you can do it if you desired so
you can really help them you can read

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:44.360
help I mean that's what is happening now
as you see these people say that sahaja

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:50.300
yoga is working in 86 countries what
happened that one person got his

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:56.210
realization he went to his country and
he changed the way people in a far fresh

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:04.760
country like Benny imagine Benny where
they have mostly Muslims there are seven

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:12.470
thousand sahaja Yogi's in Turkey we have
three thousand and in so many places we

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:19.580
have but the maximum in Benin where
there are mostly people who are who were

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:25.370
Muslims and I was applied are there why
did you become Muslims so they said

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:31.010
because the French were here and we
didn't like the way they were a model so

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:35.300
we thought their religion is no good so
the gay Muslims but now they're great

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:41.180
sahaja Yogi's very very great sahaja
yoga so many Muslim countries have

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:47.000
become sahaja Yogi's all over the world
we have in Russia we have thousands and

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.660
thousands and thousands and Russians are
very deeply but I tell you the so-called

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:59.480
freedom we had we have gone helter
skelter while the Russians had no

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:04.900
freedom they could not even talk about
God they did not read anything about

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:11.570
divine and they developed I think out of
that tyranny of communism developed

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:19.070
within themselves a very very deep
understanding and they are there will be

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:26.240
amazed that sahaja yoga is now practiced
in so many countries where I never even

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:32.680
thought I would reach but sahaja Yogi's
have gone and done the job

00:37:34.569 --> 00:37:38.319
what's a lot of pussy

00:37:48.319 --> 00:37:55.890
now can I ask you one question what was
your first understanding that you were a

00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:05.880
human being it's like that one as you
are aware of you being a human being I

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.690
was aware

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:41.680
I have no religion I have all the radius

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:52.220
born in any family should not sort of
stop your widget you can see through

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:56.350
everything if you have the light

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:12.500
there's another one now I was I must say
here there are so many people who are

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:17.720
asking questions normally they I don't
find that experience doesn't matter but

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:23.450
how many will become good sahaja Yogi's
used to be seen out of you it's all

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:28.760
right to ask questions after questions
but that is of no value unless and until

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:36.580
you really become what I am saying a
sahaja yogi a real personality that is

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:43.550
absolutely spiritual so we have to see
that that is the challenge for all of

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:49.430
you let's see how many i must say Los
Angeles has been really a lost and

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:56.930
delicious so far for me but sahaja
Yogi's always felt that I can do very

00:39:56.930 --> 00:40:02.930
well so I came now this is the fifth
question you are asking madam will you

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:14.730
please take your realization and then
ask your right this another one

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:18.630
you see once you have asked a question
you shouldn't ask another question

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:27.210
please because all of them are waiting
for their self-realization they are all

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:32.910
waiting for their self-realization only
few who want to ask questions is one is

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:39.210
all right but not all the time go on
asking questions what is there unless

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:46.190
and until you are a journalist a vehicle

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:59.490
as we should can you now write your
questions and let me know I'll answer

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:06.710
them after you get your realization then
you won't have any questions I know

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:22.920
again I said it is the becoming you have
to become it's not just talking

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:36.140
now forget your questions for the time
being better get your realization all

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:49.520
right now one thing is that you have to
just take out your shoes or chuckles

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:54.830
whatever it because this mother earth is
of a great help she sucks in all our

00:41:54.830 --> 00:42:03.220
problems put both the feet apart from
each other

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:12.960
you will know everything about sahaja
yoga why I said to put your feet apart

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:18.089
from each other everything you will know
very clearly but they should touch the

00:42:18.089 --> 00:42:33.539
mother earth you have to just be
comfortable and all of you should be

00:42:33.539 --> 00:42:42.779
seated before i start i have to request
that those who want their realization

00:42:42.779 --> 00:42:50.520
only i can give them it cannot be forced
because kundalini is the pure desire is

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:58.589
the pure desire not impurities are as we
have whatever desired we have we have

00:42:58.589 --> 00:43:03.200
today one then we want to have something
else that's the principle of economics

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:09.960
but this is pure desire and forth is
pure desire you should be determined to

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:19.950
get it is your own character your own
understanding only will work it out now

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:25.529
I would request you all to sit
comfortably with both feet like this

00:43:25.529 --> 00:43:33.500
very comfortable and put both your hands
towards me like

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:08.000
now what I find that some of you feel
guilty it's a nonsense if you feel

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.850
guilty then this Center here catches on
the left hand side and the Kundalini

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:22.130
don't move so if you have done anything
wrong I agree so it's finished that's

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:30.980
the past you don't have to worry about
that at this moment please you have to

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:40.870
know that you are not guilty at all for
anything so please forgive yourself

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:49.490
please forgive yourself now the second
thing is that we have to forgive also

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:56.120
others now some people say it's
difficult to forgive mother I mean what

00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:02.240
do you do whether you forgive where you
don't forgive you don't do anything what

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:10.400
do you do nothing but by not forgiving
you torture yourself so best thing is to

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:16.400
forgive all of them forgive everybody
who has harmed you who has troubled you

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:23.540
was made you unhappy as hurt forgive
don't also think about them it's also

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:31.640
useless by forgiving you don't know what
will happen absolute really feel

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:38.240
peaceful be yourself just forgive it
this nobleness you should accept today

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:46.790
that you forgive everyone just working
now please put your hands torsion like

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:52.510
this comfortably perfect

00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:05.400
now you can put your right hand towards
me and feel with the left hand on top of

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:17.250
your fontanel bone area little higher if
there is any cool or a hot breeze like

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:28.230
vibrations are coming out of your own
head on your ship bomb you can feel it

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:35.580
you move your hand up and down and see
for yourself if you are feeling please

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:45.810
remove your caps if you have please it's
better to remove now please see you must

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:50.850
have respect for yourself should not
denounce yourself and you should also

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:57.030
forgive everyone that's very important
now for the left hand towards me and put

00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:04.350
the right hand on top of your fontanel
bone area and bend your head just when

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:12.660
your head and see for yourself if
there's a cool or a hot breeze coming

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:21.660
out of your own fontanel bone area this
is the actualization of the baptism you

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.170
may call it

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:39.119
once more with your right hand horse and
see with your left hand if there is a

00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:48.060
cool or a hot breeze coming out of your
fontanel bone area please keep your head

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.600
bending

00:47:57.619 --> 00:48:00.279
No

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:08.870
if it is hot means you have not forgiven
yourself or you have not forgiven others

00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:15.110
so again please forgive please forgive
yourself and forgive others that's a

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:20.650
very great asset and help

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:38.890
now see for yourself if there's a cool
or a hot breeze coming on your

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:43.349
fingertips or on your palms

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:06.869
please forgive forgive forgive yourself
