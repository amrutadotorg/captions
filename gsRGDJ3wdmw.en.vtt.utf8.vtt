00:40.340 --> 00:45.470
no no you see to begin with see it has

00:44.280 --> 00:48.390
something to do with your nervous

00:45.470 --> 00:51.090
alright so if your nervous system is

00:48.390 --> 00:52.649
disturbed you may not feel at all what

00:51.090 --> 00:54.630
the nervous system best thing is to do

00:52.649 --> 00:57.390
massage somebody should massage their

00:54.630 --> 01:00.149
back hands also I have told many times

00:57.390 --> 01:02.579
that you rub your hands vibrated olive

01:00.149 --> 01:04.739
oil quite a lot and drop these things so

01:02.579 --> 01:07.680
if they become self could be within

01:04.739 --> 01:09.720
sensitivity but if they can feel the

01:07.680 --> 01:11.369
catches in this in the body that means

01:09.720 --> 01:13.320
they're all right only that we should is

01:11.369 --> 01:15.300
not all right rub the thing all the

01:13.320 --> 01:17.580
machine work on we should be clear it

01:15.300 --> 01:22.289
out and for we should be if you can use

01:17.580 --> 01:24.630
say butter could rub on the here and rub

01:22.289 --> 01:26.580
all these muscles listen with that all

01:24.630 --> 01:29.280
these things will work out for your hand

01:26.580 --> 01:31.440
but supposing you are there's no cool

01:29.280 --> 01:33.479
breeze coming out of the head possibly

01:31.440 --> 01:35.310
then the realization is not yet

01:33.479 --> 01:36.300
established see other people should say

01:35.310 --> 01:38.130
whether there's a cool breeze coming

01:36.300 --> 01:39.959
because the person who is not realized

01:38.130 --> 01:41.880
may not feeling supposing he does not

01:39.959 --> 01:43.500
feel it and you feel it then he's

01:41.880 --> 01:45.270
realized to only think his chakras are

01:43.500 --> 01:47.280
to be cleared it's a different different

01:45.270 --> 01:49.649
category of things then there are some

01:47.280 --> 01:51.660
people whose Kundalini has not risen

01:49.649 --> 01:54.300
there still sahaja yogi like that maybe

01:51.660 --> 01:56.940
I don't know if there are any those

01:54.300 --> 01:59.250
people who are unmarried for long they

01:56.940 --> 02:01.170
are very difficult because they never

01:59.250 --> 02:03.450
feel the cool things in that quite a lot

02:01.170 --> 02:05.099
like that but it is not so they are

02:03.450 --> 02:06.810
realized Souls in any case they may not

02:05.099 --> 02:09.599
feel it but they realized so to see

02:06.810 --> 02:11.520
because it kind of a soft as a kind of a

02:09.599 --> 02:14.040
balance is developed after marriage

02:11.520 --> 02:15.400
which is not there and that's how some

02:14.040 --> 02:17.830
people don't feel

02:15.400 --> 02:20.770
there are various reasons some people

02:17.830 --> 02:21.940
who are oriented war they should turn

02:20.770 --> 02:24.010
their left to the right

02:21.940 --> 02:26.290
many at times they should find out from

02:24.010 --> 02:28.239
the hands you see one hand is bigger one

02:26.290 --> 02:30.130
hand is smaller that means the left side

02:28.239 --> 02:32.140
if it is smaller that means you have to

02:30.130 --> 02:33.550
raise left over that you see from the

02:32.140 --> 02:35.410
size of the hands and all that you can

02:33.550 --> 02:37.569
see putting one hand towards the

02:35.410 --> 02:39.550
photograph another hand outside work it

02:37.569 --> 02:41.769
out in so many ways because you have

02:39.550 --> 02:43.540
permutations and combinations of certain

02:41.769 --> 02:44.860
mistakes but that doesn't mean you

02:43.540 --> 02:46.840
develop this left it should be by any

02:44.860 --> 02:48.400
chance because that's the worst thing

02:46.840 --> 02:49.780
that can happen if you develop the left

02:48.400 --> 02:57.420
Rashidi then it's a very difficult

02:49.780 --> 02:57.420
situation now

02:58.080 --> 03:03.849
for this kind of a thing I think I will

03:00.849 --> 03:06.519
give you a complete lecture on one day

03:03.849 --> 03:08.890
complete as to see what permutations and

03:06.519 --> 03:12.390
combinations of different chakras can

03:08.890 --> 03:12.390
feel all right

03:14.549 --> 03:19.359
but symptoms are outside the symptoms

03:17.739 --> 03:21.670
are mostly outside there's no need to

03:19.359 --> 03:28.840
from a personality to see what it is

03:21.670 --> 03:31.180
since that is a very problem with a

03:28.840 --> 03:32.769
problem with people that they don't feel

03:31.180 --> 03:35.650
the vibration some people just don't

03:32.769 --> 03:38.500
really how many there are like that

03:35.650 --> 03:44.739
who never feel any vibration never

03:38.500 --> 03:47.130
friend no you never your felt it

03:44.739 --> 03:47.130
sometime

03:50.040 --> 03:57.480
[Music]

04:04.170 --> 04:08.459
left side catch all right you can see

04:05.790 --> 04:10.859
clearly a right hand is very shining the

04:08.459 --> 04:12.870
left there is a problem you see this

04:10.859 --> 04:15.090
these fingers are not so shiny as the

04:12.870 --> 04:17.609
things are you had a left side problem

04:15.090 --> 04:19.799
if you remember it all right so that's

04:17.609 --> 04:21.060
fighting in the ashram the vibrations

04:19.799 --> 04:22.770
are fighting that's why I feel hot

04:21.060 --> 04:24.600
there's something wrong it will correct

04:22.770 --> 04:27.570
it will happen please put your right

04:24.600 --> 04:30.110
hand always up and left I'm tall so it

04:27.570 --> 04:30.110
