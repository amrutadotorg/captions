1
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:22,597
I am very, very happy to see so many of you
coming down here for the program.

2
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:29,716
Actually, I bought this land at least, at
least twenty-five years back.

3
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:38,147
I couldn’t do anything about it as they
had lots of objections, this and that, but

4
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:46,337
then somehow, I planned the whole thing and
it all worked out.

5
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:55,617
Happy to see you all here but with all those
difficulties ultimately now you find so many

6
00:01:55,617 --> 00:02:00,776
Sahaja yogis attending this program, My puja.

7
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:15,627
I must remember My brother Baba who has worked
very hard for the propagation of Indian music,

8
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:23,327
classical music, all types of art, whatever
he could do.

9
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:29,587
It’s a very sad thing that he is not here
today to see you all.

10
00:02:29,587 --> 00:02:43,456
He has done so much work religiously without
expecting any reward whatsoever and I wish

11
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:53,227
you could have him as your ideal and that
will work it out everything in that way.

12
00:02:53,227 --> 00:03:02,497
There’s one thing about him I know, he never
tried to show off anything.

13
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:15,527
He was very intelligent, educated man but
he caught hold of all the people of ordinary

14
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:27,826
living and he looked after them and he promoted
their skill of music and art.

15
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:46,817
With the same idea, I decided to have this
place dedicated to his idea of propagating

16
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:55,827
music and art and I am happy to see that that
idea has materialized.

17
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:56,867
But I wish [UNCLEAR.

18
00:03:56,867 --> 00:04:04,817
EITHER had or that] My brother was here to
make you feel very happy about it.

19
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:09,167
He was a very loving and a kind person.

20
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:12,607
Never used to get angry with anyone, I’ve
seen that.

21
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:20,727
But always he gave Me a very good picture
of every person.

22
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:28,906
You can’t help it.

39
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,253
What are they saying?

40
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:42,836
Who is it?

41
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:48,123
What happened?

42
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:54,404
SY: Volunteers just see who is there.

43
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:19,762
SM: They are speaking in Marathi.

44
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:24,030
They are asking where to sit? Nothing else.

45
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:25,321
What is it?

46
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,764
They are saying there is no place. They have to sit on ground.

47
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:39,037
SM: It is the specialty of Maharashtra: quarrelsome nature.

48
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:47,643
They are very good at fighting.

49
00:05:47,844 --> 00:05:52,781
Do anything for them but nothing enters into their head.

50
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:58,755
They have no understanding,

51
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:01,379
always ready to fight,

52
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,984
even with swords.

53
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,846
I am fed up with your quarrelling nature.

54
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:17,421
This beautiful new building has been erected

55
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,626
for our classical music.

56
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:22,308
They fought even on this

57
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:28,720
and many times I felt, why build it in Maharashtra?

58
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:33,455
No point doing anything for these quarreling people.

59
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,249
They fight for some reason or the other.

60
00:06:38,884 --> 00:06:42,097
They have no shame, nothing.

61
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:49,727
If they don’t find a place to sit, what can we do?

62
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:56,413
No maturity at all.

63
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:04,588
I don’t know how there is music in these quarrelsome people.

64
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,980
And the music has grown so much.

65
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:13,504
Everybody has the same experience.

66
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:17,952
In Maharashtra people are very quarrelsome

67
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:22,413
and I am fed up with it.

68
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:26,718
Everybody is complaining about something.

69
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:30,583
Have you not found peace in Sahaja Yoga?

70
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:35,261
So many Great Saints & Sages were born in this land

71
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:39,880
and they have given so much knowledge.

72
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:45,724
They have given so much knowledge but there is no effect.

73
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:48,589
This quarrelsome nature is not going.

74
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,409
They will fight even in their name,

75
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,587
keep behaving foolishly.

76
00:07:56,796 --> 00:08:02,216
I don’t know when this foolishness is going to end in Maharashtra.

77
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:09,307
They just don’t understand peaceful living

78
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:15,264
and absorbing everything peacefully.

79
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:21,207
They just start shouting all of a sudden.

80
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,703
Our foreign Sahaja Yogis say:

81
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:29,179
"Are they uneducated people?".

82
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,902
No, no, they are very well educated,

83
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:37,243
but very quarrelsome.

84
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:40,789
And why they fight, they only know.

85
00:08:43,812 --> 00:08:48,272
At least please don’t fight in Sahaja yoga

86
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,330
and be a bit peaceful.

87
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:55,847
At least try.

88
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:59,108
We want to change, isn’t it?

89
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:03,901
Instead of finding faults with others,

90
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:08,142
see what is wrong with yourself.

91
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:14,453
Baba has done a lot of work in this mad Maharashtra,

92
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:17,160
at Nagpur.

93
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:22,150
There are different type of people in Nagpur,

94
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:28,779
I want to say there are not only Maharashtrians.

95
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:33,292
People in Nagpur are very active and they helped him.

96
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:42,060
But nobody understands that you must absorb Sahaja yoga

97
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:44,745
and become a Saint (Sadhu).

98
00:09:44,944 --> 00:09:48,555
That doesn't come in anyone's attention.

99
00:09:49,436 --> 00:09:51,554
When you think of just making money somehow,

100
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:55,023
run helter-skelter for it,

101
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:05,758
have such a low manner thinking,

102
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:11,518
with such a thinking, how can you be a Sahaja Yogi?

103
00:10:14,232 --> 00:10:17,265
What should we call them?

104
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:21,035
One must feel that: ”I am a realized soul.

105
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,850
We must achieve some good state”.

106
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:26,653
Mother has worked so hard and so much for us.

107
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:31,063
So [all of you] decide today

108
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:35,122
to stop fighting from now onwards

109
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:40,916
and stop being greedy for money,

110
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:43,729
which is too much in Maharashtra.

111
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,491
Here greed for money is amazing.

112
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:53,378
Because of greed for money it is difficult to do Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra.

113
00:10:53,585 --> 00:11:00,748
I have worked a lot in Maharashtra, beyond the words,

114
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:04,528
and have had all sorts of experiences in this land.

115
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:09,225
Now please realize that you are a Sahaja yogi

116
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:12,295
and live gracefully

117
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:15,407
and be proud of being a Sahaja yogi.

118
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:20,074
What is there to fight in Sahaja Yoga?

119
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:24,608
You have not found a place to sit,

120
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,682
or you have not found a place to see…

121
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:32,450
Is this a political meeting or what?

122
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:39,837
I did not want to speak anything but I had no option

123
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:44,498
when I saw you I had to say it.

124
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:50,186
Now if any Sahaja Yogi shows quarrelsome attitude,

125
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:54,258
he will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

126
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,879
There is no other way to correct this.

127
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,883
Everyone should live with affection.

128
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:03,674
If you cannot behave yourself,

129
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:07,380
then why are you in Sahaja yoga?

130
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:13,509
It is our Baba special character

131
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,272
that he never got angry with anybody,

132
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:19,813
and he would never talk ill of anyone,

133
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:25,061
and never complained about anybody.

134
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:28,283
He would praise everybody.

135
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:31,527
I used to get misguided

136
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:35,631
how can everybody have such a good state.

137
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,240
I would never understand.

138
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:43,195
But Baba brought people together with love,

139
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:46,096
it may be just anybody.

140
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:50,714
He would never sit in My car,

141
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:55,975
never visit to My house.

142
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,482
He was very selfless and understanding.

143
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,831
He also belonged to this Maharashtra,

144
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:06,991
but he was never so rude.

145
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:10,484
Till the end He was not rude.

146
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:14,248
Such a great personality he was.

147
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,247
You have joined this place,

148
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:20,908
so at least follow some of his good qualities.

149
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:25,757
Now, this,

150
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:41,742
we have built this temple for music

151
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:45,815
and other form of arts.

152
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:49,577
Your children must progress in these fields.

153
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:52,884
They must understand our classical music.

154
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:59,924
These foreigners understand your music more than you do, it's a shame.

155
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:06,177
We don’t understand basics, taal, nothing,

156
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:09,960
then what’s the use?

157
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:13,852
You may not be a student of this place,

158
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,479
still, you must have knowledge about music.

159
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:25,025
Unless you know, what is raga, what is tala,

160
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,223
you cannot enjoy music.

161
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:34,890
I request you all

162
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:40,275
to leave aside your quarrelling nature

163
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:47,008
and develop goodness within you.

164
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:50,363
This is the work of Sahaja Yoga,

165
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:53,988
but, if you sow seeds in unfertile land,

166
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:56,346
you cannot reap anything.

167
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,933
I sometimes feel that.

168
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:01,046
But now things are better

169
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:06,999
with many people coming to Sahaja Yoga and they are welcome.

170
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:12,312
So, don’t just come to learn music here.

171
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:16,248
You must learn to behave in a sahaja way,

172
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,953
understand the sahaja way,

173
00:15:19,154 --> 00:15:23,137
understand the greatness of Sahaja Yoga - you should absorb these things within you.

174
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:26,063
If you don't learn this,

175
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,603
it is useless.

176
00:15:29,903 --> 00:15:33,045
There are many music schools around.

177
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,690
Everywhere there are music schools.

178
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:39,840
By learning music from these schools if you are going trouble others,

179
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,096
it is better not to learn music at all.

180
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:49,624
So I request you all, please,

181
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:52,833
that now with this music,

182
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:57,196
bring the music of your life

183
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:00,522
into your day-to-day practice.

184
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:04,739
Unless you follow this,

185
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:13,827
this program will not be accomplished.

186
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,284
Take a vow today, we will not fight.

187
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:23,249
Even if anyone says anything, we will not fight.

188
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,059
The second problem here is about making money.

189
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,550
they are not leaving it at all.

190
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:33,899
People make money even in Sahaja yoga.

191
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,510
They don't understand.

192
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:40,655
How did people here get this greed?

193
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:44,209
It has spread so much

194
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:50,191
that I am fed up.

195
00:16:50,596 --> 00:16:54,648
Are you going to change or not, now you decide.

196
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:58,441
Most important thing is that there should be music in our lives,

197
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,114
there should be rhythm in our lives.

198
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:04,638
Instead of being rhythmic,

199
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:10,101
fighting all the time is not proper.

200
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:14,891
Thinking bad about others

201
00:17:15,097 --> 00:17:17,279
and seeing only self interest

202
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,680
it's a wrong quality.

203
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:24,209
Now forget what happened in the past.

204
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,697
You should bring such people in Sahaja Yoga now

205
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:29,317
who are understanding, loving,

206
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:33,989
and who will bring all people together.

207
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:42,399
Fortunately I also know Hindi language.

208
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,440
And the thing is,

209
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:49,498
now if we take to music,

210
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:52,577
we ourselves should also be in rhythm.

211
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:54,905
What does it mean?

212
00:17:55,106 --> 00:18:00,861
It means that the state of human beings,

213
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:06,013
is to be corrected

214
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:09,336
and has to be made rhythmic

215
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:12,259
and has to be made organized.

216
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,109
Unless it is done,

217
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:15,765
it is of no use.

218
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:19,447
What is the difference between you people and others?

219
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:22,264
If you also keep fighting,

220
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:24,796
then what is the use?

221
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:29,753
The most important thing is that in your mind,

222
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:34,746
you should develop love, reverence and devotion.

223
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:38,933
so that you become peaceful

224
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,254
and others also become peaceful.

225
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,946
Without peace, music has got no meaning.

226
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:52,201
Today, with the idea of Baba mama,

227
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:57,478
this beautiful building has been erected.

228
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:05,000
And with this I wish that people will take to music within them,

229
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:11,254
and people have a peaceful atmosphere.

230
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:14,757
Today world needs only Peace.

231
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:18,248
Everything else we have today is worthless.

232
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,615
We have to see how peaceful we are.

233
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:27,226
If this peace does not have an effect on our country

234
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,730
then on which country will it have?

235
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:36,398
Everybody says that India is the ambassador of peace.

236
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,107
But, I can’t see anything like it.

237
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:43,564
There is quarrel and fighting among one another.

238
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,146
Don't know what to say?

239
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:50,725
So those who want to learn music,

240
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:54,079
must have music in their hearts also.

241
00:19:55,122 --> 00:19:58,164
Should think from the heart.

242
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:02,394
Running after money, running after women,

243
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:05,700
and doing all sorts of wrong things

244
00:20:05,923 --> 00:20:09,672
is unbecoming of a musician.

245
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:12,382
My eternal blessings

246
00:20:12,581 --> 00:20:16,183
that this organization should flourish

247
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:21,285
and people coming here should learn music

248
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:25,414
and make their lives rhythmic and full of music.

249
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:30,153
Hope you will fulfil my desires.

250
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:35,362
Whenever you get angry, get annoyed

251
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,895
whenever you have complains,

252
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:45,663
tell yourself that ‘I am a sahaja yogi'.

253
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,493
I am different from others,

254
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:53,144
Mother has transformed me into something else.

255
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:55,200
If you understand this

256
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:58,811
you will recognise your glory.

257
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:02,621
But if you cannot achieve this,

258
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:05,266
then it is useless.

259
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:10,083
Then making 50 such organizations

260
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:13,012
also is of no use.

261
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:17,745
Fighting for small, small things,

262
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:20,504
doesn't become you.

263
00:21:20,705 --> 00:21:23,639
You are Saints now.

264
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,413
You have achieved great heights,

265
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:29,849
very great heights,

266
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,885
And You do not realize that.

267
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:37,003
You don't understand that "We are great saints now".

268
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:39,310
You think that you are

269
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:42,391
the same beggar on the street as you were before.

270
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,966
No, no.

271
00:21:44,547 --> 00:21:46,910
My special blessings

272
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:51,188
that you all should become musical.

273
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:55,444
Today I wanted to bless you all,

274
00:21:55,645 --> 00:22:00,975
that you become completely musical in temperament,

275
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:03,571
rhythmic

276
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:12,001
and entertaining to others

277
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:14,794
and not quarrelsome.

278
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:19,074
Now, as you have seen that how the western music

279
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:22,185
is taking to wrong side,

280
00:22:22,386 --> 00:22:24,488
to the wrong progress,

281
00:22:24,689 --> 00:22:27,917
and I don’t want you to fall into that.

282
00:22:28,118 --> 00:22:30,537
This will all disappear, I know,

283
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:33,664
because it is very destructive.

284
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:38,306
But, after coming to Sahaja also

285
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:41,809
if you have the same destructive idea,

286
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,908
how can anybody help you?

287
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:50,621
So I hope you will fulfill my ideal, about you.

288
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,605
May God bless you.
