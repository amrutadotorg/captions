2000-0425 Public Program, Istanbul, Turkey
Levent Kirca and Oya Basar Theatre

00:01:48.652 --> 00:01:53.263
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.337
These are the days of greatest turmoil.

00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:17.721
We can see around us all kinds of calamities coming.

00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:28.944
Also, what we find is

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:33.600
human beings are not happy
with themselves and with others.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.862
That means, there is something basically wrong with us

00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:50.468
that we cannot live in peace all of us together.

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:01.530
We have no joy,

00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:04.149
we cannot enjoy our life.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.111
We are unnecessarily so miserable.

00:03:18.377 --> 00:03:23.289
Whether rich or poor, whatever may be the condition.

00:03:23.308 --> 00:03:26.125
People are not very happy.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.082
What is the reason?

00:03:38.931 --> 00:03:44.018
Have we been created for miseries and troubles?

00:03:50.136 --> 00:03:53.583
To suffer from all kinds of diseases

00:03:53.618 --> 00:03:57.133
and all kinds of infections.

00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:15.129
The nature also, the mother earth,
everything is not unison with us.

00:04:24.693 --> 00:04:28.780
The reason is we are not ourselves.

00:04:33.049 --> 00:04:39.368
It is very important as said by everyone
that you should know yourself.

00:04:45.837 --> 00:04:48.742
But how are we to know.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.478
Now the time has come.

00:04:58.248 --> 00:05:02.041
In the Quran, it has described two stages,

00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:06.089
one is the Qiyam (to stand up)
and another is Qiyamat (Doomsday).

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:18.499
We can be saved and can enjoy the Qiyamat.

00:05:25.903 --> 00:05:28.038
Or we can be destroyed

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.773
and suffer the Qiyamat.

00:05:37.113 --> 00:05:40.295
So, this is the time of judgement.

00:05:43.447 --> 00:05:46.780
It is described in all the scriptures.

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.926
Whatever you may believe,

00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:57.602
whatever you may think, makes no difference.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:08.842
Whatever place you live, whatever country you belong to

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.877
has nothing to do with you.

00:06:23.194 --> 00:06:27.201
Now, how the judgement is going to take place.

00:06:30.924 --> 00:06:32.955
Within us lies,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.412
a power that our creator has put in

00:06:37.437 --> 00:06:41.359
the triangular bone called as sacrum.

00:06:54.446 --> 00:06:58.822
This is the power which  is going to give us the

00:06:58.837 --> 00:07:03.332
higher state of existence when we know ourselves.

00:07:12.936 --> 00:07:21.118
Otherwise, we are lost in
the  mess of this worldly illusions.

00:07:28.643 --> 00:07:34.095
This is the power which in Sanskrit
we call as Kundalini.

00:07:38.752 --> 00:07:44.594
Because it moves like a snake, some people
also call it a serpent power.

00:07:52.636 --> 00:07:56.334
But this power is your individual mother.

00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:03.776
She has no other child but yourself.

00:08:07.205 --> 00:08:09.530
She knows everything about you.

00:08:13.102 --> 00:08:17.498
She knows what are your aspirations,

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.266
she knows what are your mistakes,

00:08:26.983 --> 00:08:32.578
also she knows what is the physical
mental problems you have.

00:08:38.688 --> 00:08:43.481
When you were born, your mother took
all the trouble upon herself.

00:08:52.348 --> 00:08:56.554
But, she did  trouble you.

00:09:03.137 --> 00:09:09.138
So, when this mother of yours
gives you your second birth,

00:09:09.187 --> 00:09:12.848
she takes all your troubles upon herself.

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:29.760
I have come here to tell you that
you have this power, all of you.

00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:37.608
If it is awakened

00:09:37.634 --> 00:09:40.823
and crosses through the six subtle centres,

00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:45.129
passes through our sixth centre here

00:09:45.154 --> 00:09:50.809
it gets connected to the all-pervading power of divine love.

00:10:04.722 --> 00:10:10.055
Einstein has said that he was tired,
Einstein was tired

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.252
trying to find out about the theory of relativity.

00:10:29.914 --> 00:10:31.938
And he got very tired,

00:10:31.962 --> 00:10:35.662
he went into his garden and started playing…

00:10:35.758 --> 00:10:38.847
started playing with the soap bubbles.

00:10:49.197 --> 00:10:52.347
While playing with the soap bubbles, he says,

00:10:52.382 --> 00:10:55.622
I do not know from somewhere unknown

00:10:55.647 --> 00:10:59.459
the theory of relativity dawned upon me.

00:11:09.092 --> 00:11:13.220
He called it torsion area, in his own language.

00:11:18.098 --> 00:11:21.328
Even you  the disciple for it

00:11:21.392 --> 00:11:25.093
who discarded his master

00:11:25.125 --> 00:11:30.029
and said that there is something beyond us,

00:11:30.054 --> 00:11:33.078
where we have to go beyond our mind.

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:50.332
Because  this mind,
because this mind,

00:11:50.565 --> 00:11:52.517
reacts to everything.

00:11:57.831 --> 00:12:00.561
It is all the time reacting.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:07.320
And that is how we are upset.

00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:13.866
These thoughts come to us

00:12:13.885 --> 00:12:18.440
all the time either from the future or from the past.

00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:30.039
But we cannot be in the present.

00:12:33.395 --> 00:12:36.077
One thought rises like this then falls on

00:12:36.102 --> 00:12:40.231
another thought rises like this and falls down.

00:12:46.715 --> 00:12:49.349
But when this Kundalini rises,

00:12:49.366 --> 00:12:53.325
these thoughts elongate and
there is a space in-between

00:12:53.366 --> 00:12:57.628
and that is the place where there is our present.

00:13:11.532 --> 00:13:14.555
So, we come in the present

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:20.722
and reality is in the present.

00:13:25.652 --> 00:13:28.945
So you know the reality

00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:32.604
and you have the knowledge about yourself.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.176
How?

00:13:40.224 --> 00:13:45.663
Because when you get connected with this
all-pervading power, this divine power,

00:13:45.688 --> 00:13:52.608
your hands start emitting kind of
very nice cool vibrations.

00:14:11.339 --> 00:14:13.481
This is the Ruh.

00:14:15.346 --> 00:14:22.496
This is the divine cool breeze, of divine love.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.827
And in your hand on your fingertips,

00:14:31.852 --> 00:14:34.242
you can feel your centres.

00:14:41.264 --> 00:14:44.296
That means your hands start speaking,

00:14:48.654 --> 00:14:51.810
that’s what Mohammed Sahab has said.

00:14:51.835 --> 00:14:57.520
That at the time of Qiyama, your hands will speak.

00:15:07.784 --> 00:15:10.649
So this is the time of Qiyama,

00:15:10.652 --> 00:15:16.082
where thousands and thousands of people have felt it.

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:28.656
If your hands don’t speak about your centres,

00:15:28.681 --> 00:15:33.317
then I would not say you really are a Muselmann.

00:15:44.292 --> 00:15:47.347
This is said by Mohammed Sahab.

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:57.893
So as a result what we should expect is
that our hands should speak,

00:16:05.653 --> 00:16:12.586
so that we get the knowledge
about ourselves about our centres.

00:16:19.181 --> 00:16:22.033
We know about ourselves very well.

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:32.947
Also, we know that this body of
ours is an instrument of God’s wish.

00:16:44.767 --> 00:16:49.779
Because now we are connected with the divine power.

00:16:49.832 --> 00:16:55.810
And we have all the knowledge
which is absolutely true.

00:17:06.076 --> 00:17:09.681
So, this is the path of absolute knowledge.

00:17:13.953 --> 00:17:20.430
Supposing there is a man
who talks big and boasts,

00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:24.292
how are we to know that
he is not a hypocrite?

00:17:35.634 --> 00:17:39.803
As soon as you put your hands towards that person,

00:17:39.829 --> 00:17:43.370
immediately you will know if it is hot

00:17:43.402 --> 00:17:47.903
or sometimes even you  get some little little bit prickles

00:17:47.928 --> 00:17:50.597
then you know he is not a good man.

00:18:05.473 --> 00:18:10.009
Not only that but supposing
you are suffering from some disease

00:18:10.042 --> 00:18:17.659
and you will not know it till you go through
the whole procedure of medical investigation.

00:18:28.367 --> 00:18:34.104
And also that they will not be very sure
as to what is wrong with you.

00:18:41.271 --> 00:18:44.961
But on your fingertips, you will know about yourself,

00:18:44.972 --> 00:18:46.870
what’s wrong with you.

00:18:57.008 --> 00:19:00.423
You will be all in charge,

00:19:04.349 --> 00:19:07.340
incomplete knowledge about yourself.

00:19:11.097 --> 00:19:16.109
And if you know how to correct your centres,

00:19:16.134 --> 00:19:19.302
you can correct the centres of others.

00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:32.976
Imagine what powers you have.

00:19:36.433 --> 00:19:40.577
For example, if this instrument is not connected,

00:19:40.639 --> 00:19:44.424
you won’t hear me and it is useless.

00:19:53.343 --> 00:19:57.074
But, if you are connected to the divine

00:19:57.085 --> 00:19:59.714
the energy starts flowing through you.

00:20:09.469 --> 00:20:14.239
But best is this power rises,
she passes through six centres,

00:20:14.264 --> 00:20:16.926
she enlightens them.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.064
She integrates them.

00:20:32.927 --> 00:20:35.831
Not only that, but

00:20:36.462 --> 00:20:41.060
it informs you

00:20:41.275 --> 00:20:45.204
what’s wrong with you and you can correct it.

00:20:55.708 --> 00:20:59.556
All your reactions stop.

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:08.861
But you watch everything without thinking.

00:21:13.581 --> 00:21:17.430
Like you become a witness.

00:21:20.515 --> 00:21:22.482
In that witness state,

00:21:22.499 --> 00:21:25.238
you know the truth about everything.

00:21:30.787 --> 00:21:32.985
This is so simple.

00:21:35.363 --> 00:21:39.690
All this can happen without paying for it

00:21:43.434 --> 00:21:46.809
because kundalini doesn’t understand money

00:21:49.665 --> 00:21:52.466
nor God takes any money.

00:21:54.628 --> 00:21:59.782
It is different if you have to book
the hall, we pay for it,

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.354
but not for kundalini awakening.

00:22:13.935 --> 00:22:17.287
And you get your experience.

00:22:17.312 --> 00:22:18.845
It’s not just talking.

00:22:18.877 --> 00:22:22.275
It is the experience on your fingertips

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:25.595
and out of your fontanelle bone area.

00:22:39.468 --> 00:22:44.010
There’s no question of blind faith.

00:22:52.763 --> 00:22:58.947
It is just the complete understanding

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.691
within yourself, of your being.

00:23:10.385 --> 00:23:13.022
This is what is Qiyama,

00:23:13.046 --> 00:23:17.596
it is where you evolve into a superhuman being.

00:23:26.067 --> 00:23:30.892
This country was especially blessed by the Sufis.

00:23:36.006 --> 00:23:39.514
They had the experience of the divine

00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:42.589
but they could not explain how get what it.

00:23:52.366 --> 00:23:55.016
But Mohammed Sahab has described it,

00:23:55.090 --> 00:24:02.144
that he was riding on a white horse,
which means the kundalini.

00:24:09.005 --> 00:24:14.241
And then he met Moses on the third heaven,

00:24:14.305 --> 00:24:18.373
which is true because we too know that all these

00:24:18.389 --> 00:24:21.679
prophets are on the third heaven.

00:24:32.321 --> 00:24:37.336
Whatever I am saying you can
verify after your realization.

00:24:44.665 --> 00:24:48.752
But as a result of kundalini awakening,

00:24:48.777 --> 00:24:52.971
all our enemies of anger,

00:24:53.051 --> 00:24:56.546
sexual misbehaviour,

00:24:57.788 --> 00:25:02.474
that all kinds of bribes, jealousies,

00:25:02.546 --> 00:25:04.270
all drop out.

00:25:19.428 --> 00:25:21.649
All the greed also drops out.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.267
Jealousies drop out

00:25:29.785 --> 00:25:32.181
because you are enlightened.

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:39.711
In the darkness, you cannot see who is your enemy.

00:25:44.407 --> 00:25:47.375
But when you are enlightened,

00:25:47.394 --> 00:25:51.683
you know everything and you don’t do anything

00:25:51.708 --> 00:25:53.681
that is destructive.

00:26:04.218 --> 00:26:07.765
You drop all your destructive habits.

00:26:11.993 --> 00:26:17.087
And what comes in your heart is the joy,

00:26:17.161 --> 00:26:23.646
is the joy which cannot be described.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.985
For example, we have unhappiness
and happiness.

00:26:41.115 --> 00:26:43.122
Two sides of a coin.

00:26:47.678 --> 00:26:53.091
But after realization, you are in complete joy.

00:27:00.547 --> 00:27:04.276
And you become absolutely peaceful.

00:27:07.757 --> 00:27:10.979
Now what we need is peace.

00:27:13.899 --> 00:27:17.382
They are having so many peace conferences

00:27:17.415 --> 00:27:19.964
and spending so much money

00:27:19.997 --> 00:27:22.919
but they themselves are quarrelling.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:35.384
So what is the use of having those conferences?

00:27:39.619 --> 00:27:43.286
But you have to become peaceful within yourself

00:27:47.786 --> 00:27:51.182
because you become very collective.

00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:58.095
You develop the collective consciousness.

00:28:01.426 --> 00:28:03.473
Who is the other?

00:28:05.346 --> 00:28:09.734
You are the part and parcel of one god almighty.

00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:19.402
This house and can felt  for this hand,

00:28:19.479 --> 00:28:24.541
in the same way, we all feel
the same within ourselves.

00:28:32.925 --> 00:28:37.927
You’ll be surprised sometimes
we have a conference of people

00:28:37.967 --> 00:28:42.485
who come from sometimes eighty countries.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.840
Black, white, yellow, every colour.

00:28:46.884 --> 00:28:50.702
And there is no quarrel, no fighting.

00:29:08.217 --> 00:29:10.930
Thousands and thousands of them.

00:29:11.156 --> 00:29:13.981
They enjoy each other’s contrary

00:29:14.013 --> 00:29:16.108
and help each other.

00:29:24.116 --> 00:29:25.933
You may be in Turkey

00:29:25.973 --> 00:29:29.059
but you will find friends in all the countries,

00:29:29.084 --> 00:29:32.066
your brother are there and sister are there.

00:29:40.481 --> 00:29:42.616
You are no more alone.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.972
You can have them in every field of life,

00:29:50.053 --> 00:29:52.697
as your own brother.

00:29:58.582 --> 00:30:02.946
It is something we are not aware of ourselves

00:30:02.971 --> 00:30:07.808
that we don’t know how great our powers of love.

00:30:14.922 --> 00:30:20.106
That a drop which falls in the ocean
becomes the ocean.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.160
You also become the ocean,

00:30:23.176 --> 00:30:25.604
all your limitations drop out.

00:30:37.201 --> 00:30:40.811
This is what is going to happen to you tonight.

00:30:44.721 --> 00:30:48.657
I don’t know if I should ask you to ask me questions.

00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:51.608
But if you think it is important then ask,

00:30:51.624 --> 00:30:54.158
but ask something important questions

00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:58.909
because you shouldn’t disturb the people around.

00:31:28.405 --> 00:31:32.857
Another thing is, it will take hardly ten minutes

00:31:32.882 --> 00:31:37.963
or fifteen minutes for you all to get your self- realization.

00:31:45.569 --> 00:31:49.735
If anyone doesn’t want it,
they should leave the hall.

00:31:55.122 --> 00:31:59.892
The only condition is that

00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:04.480
you should forgive everyone.

00:32:09.585 --> 00:32:11.869
Also, forgive yourself.

00:32:15.334 --> 00:32:19.866
Just you have to say I forgive
everyone in your heart.

00:32:25.281 --> 00:32:30.560
Don’t also think whom you have to forgive
but in general,

00:32:30.585 --> 00:32:34.511
you should  say I forgive everyone.

00:32:42.687 --> 00:32:46.115
Also, you have to forgive yourself.

00:32:49.628 --> 00:32:55.090
You might have done something wrong, doesn’t matter.

00:32:59.562 --> 00:33:02.133
That was in the past.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.399
We are in the present.

00:33:09.464 --> 00:33:12.545
Another thing is, that

00:33:12.641 --> 00:33:17.541
whether you forgive or
you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

00:33:23.367 --> 00:33:28.051
But if you don't forgive
then you play to wrong hands.

00:33:32.726 --> 00:33:37.535
So, now we will have the session for self-realization.

00:33:43.632 --> 00:33:47.419
For that, can I request all the cameraman

00:33:47.452 --> 00:33:52.509
not to take any photograph and to keep quiet?

00:34:03.137 --> 00:34:04.604
Just for ten minutes.

00:34:06.552 --> 00:34:09.512
But when they will raise their hand

00:34:09.529 --> 00:34:13.675
saying they have got self-realization,
then we can take.

00:34:23.696 --> 00:34:26.703
So, please wait only for about ten minutes.

00:34:32.837 --> 00:34:36.402
Now, as I told you,

00:34:36.438 --> 00:34:39.255
you have to forgive yourself

00:34:39.272 --> 00:34:41.369
and you have to forgive others.

00:34:41.417 --> 00:34:43.107
This is very important.

00:34:52.516 --> 00:34:58.916
What you can do now is, just to put
both your hands towards to me like this.

00:35:06.928 --> 00:35:08.784
Just like this, simple like this.

00:35:09.969 --> 00:35:13.717
Do it like you do for Namaz. Please do like this.

00:35:20.576 --> 00:35:22.083
Alright.

00:35:33.356 --> 00:35:38.874
Please again forgive yourself
and forgive everyone else.

00:35:46.526 --> 00:35:55.641
Now, you can bend your head

00:35:58.846 --> 00:36:04.141
and put your left hand top of your

00:36:04.198 --> 00:36:09.473
fontanel bone area which was
the soft on your childhood,

00:36:09.481 --> 00:36:12.928
on top and above.

00:36:21.717 --> 00:36:25.153
Now see, if there is a cool or hot breeze

00:36:25.178 --> 00:36:29.029
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

00:36:29.046 --> 00:36:30.380
please move your hand.

00:36:43.006 --> 00:36:45.086
Have faith in yourself,

00:36:47.031 --> 00:36:49.182
forgive yourself.

00:36:52.891 --> 00:36:57.621
Alright, now please put your left hand towards me

00:36:57.656 --> 00:37:02.507
and with the right hand
please see, bend your head,

00:37:02.532 --> 00:37:08.656
please see if there is a cool breeze
coming out your fontanel bone area.

00:37:18.622 --> 00:37:22.621
If it is hot, then

00:37:22.679 --> 00:37:26.792
you have not forgiven either yourself or others.

00:37:26.827 --> 00:37:28.667
So Please do that now.

00:37:42.198 --> 00:37:43.920
Alright,

00:37:45.908 --> 00:37:48.132
now again, once more,

00:37:48.155 --> 00:37:50.951
put your right hand towards me like this open

00:37:50.976 --> 00:37:53.031
and see with your left hand.

00:37:53.042 --> 00:37:56.226
Bend your head and see for yourself

00:37:56.235 --> 00:38:02.081
is there a cool or hot breeze coming out
of your fontanel bone area.

00:38:15.042 --> 00:38:20.205
Now, please put your both the hands towards me

00:38:23.347 --> 00:38:28.552
and please don`t think,
can you do that, don`t think

00:38:58.581 --> 00:39:05.854
Now please see, if you are getting cool
or hot breeze on yourfingertips.

00:39:05.916 --> 00:39:07.979
It can be gentle

00:39:15.993 --> 00:39:20.873
or you are getting it on your palms

00:39:24.322 --> 00:39:27.782
or out of your fontanel bone area.

00:39:32.335 --> 00:39:39.509
Anywhere if you are getting cool or
hot breeze please raise your hands,

00:39:54.085 --> 00:39:57.767
You all become sufis now. Congratulations.

00:39:58.994 --> 00:40:01.224
May God bless you.

00:40:06.486 --> 00:40:09.605
Turkey is a very Divine place

00:40:12.946 --> 00:40:16.636
and such a short time you got your realization.

00:40:20.414 --> 00:40:23.548
Don't doubt it please.

00:40:27.048 --> 00:40:29.115
Alright, take down your hands.

00:40:40.115 --> 00:40:47.238
I saw more ladies in the airport [UNCLEAR] you see.

00:40:47.328 --> 00:40:54.341
but I want men also to become realized souls,
very important.

00:41:03.558 --> 00:41:10.005
Now you will know what is
pure love, pure compassion

00:41:17.019 --> 00:41:23.281
because this is the power of
Divine compassion, Divine Love.

00:41:29.814 --> 00:41:31.965
May God bless you all.

00:41:35.757 --> 00:41:40.758
They will sing one song which we shold clap

00:41:40.806 --> 00:41:46.654
and you will see that these vibrations
of cool breeze will increase.

00:42:02.014 --> 00:42:05.989
For five minutes, you just feel again.
