Levent Kirca and Oya Basar Theatre

01:48.652 --> 01:53.263
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

02:00.480 --> 02:05.337
These are the days of greatest turmoil.

02:10.535 --> 02:17.721
We can see around us all kinds of calamities coming.

02:25.397 --> 02:28.944
Also, what we find is

02:29.003 --> 02:33.600
human beings are not happy
with themselves and with others.

02:40.890 --> 02:46.862
That means, there is something basically wrong with us

02:46.921 --> 02:50.468
that we cannot live in peace all of us together.

02:59.205 --> 03:01.530
We have no joy,

03:01.634 --> 03:04.149
we cannot enjoy our life.

03:09.640 --> 03:14.111
We are unnecessarily so miserable.

03:18.377 --> 03:23.289
Whether rich or poor, whatever may be the condition.

03:23.308 --> 03:26.125
People are not very happy.

03:33.939 --> 03:36.082
What is the reason?

03:38.931 --> 03:44.018
Have we been created for miseries and troubles?

03:50.136 --> 03:53.583
To suffer from all kinds of diseases

03:53.618 --> 03:57.133
and all kinds of infections.

04:07.115 --> 04:15.129
The nature also, the mother earth,
everything is not unison with us.

04:24.693 --> 04:28.780
The reason is we are not ourselves.

04:33.049 --> 04:39.368
It is very important as said by everyone
that you should know yourself.

04:45.837 --> 04:48.742
But how are we to know.

04:51.460 --> 04:54.478
Now the time has come.

04:58.248 --> 05:02.041
In the Quran, it has described two stages,

05:02.198 --> 05:06.089
one is the Qiyam (to stand up)
and another is Qiyamat (Doomsday).

05:12.458 --> 05:18.499
We can be saved and can enjoy the Qiyamat.

05:25.903 --> 05:28.038
Or we can be destroyed

05:31.320 --> 05:33.773
and suffer the Qiyamat.

05:37.113 --> 05:40.295
So, this is the time of judgement.

05:43.447 --> 05:46.780
It is described in all the scriptures.

05:51.379 --> 05:53.926
Whatever you may believe,

05:53.992 --> 05:57.602
whatever you may think, makes no difference.

06:04.731 --> 06:08.842
Whatever place you live, whatever country you belong to

06:08.870 --> 06:11.877
has nothing to do with you.

06:23.194 --> 06:27.201
Now, how the judgement is going to take place.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.955
Within us lies,

06:32.980 --> 06:37.412
a power that our creator has put in

06:37.437 --> 06:41.359
the triangular bone called as sacrum.

06:54.446 --> 06:58.822
This is the power which  is going to give us the

06:58.837 --> 07:03.332
higher state of existence when we know ourselves.

07:12.936 --> 07:21.118
Otherwise, we are lost in
the  mess of this worldly illusions.

07:28.643 --> 07:34.095
This is the power which in Sanskrit
we call as Kundalini.

07:38.752 --> 07:44.594
Because it moves like a snake, some people
also call it a serpent power.

07:52.636 --> 07:56.334
But this power is your individual mother.

08:00.427 --> 08:03.776
She has no other child but yourself.

08:07.205 --> 08:09.530
She knows everything about you.

08:13.102 --> 08:17.498
She knows what are your aspirations,

08:21.790 --> 08:24.266
she knows what are your mistakes,

08:26.983 --> 08:32.578
also she knows what is the physical
mental problems you have.

08:38.688 --> 08:43.481
When you were born, your mother took
all the trouble upon herself.

08:52.348 --> 08:56.554
But, she did  trouble you.

09:03.137 --> 09:09.138
So, when this mother of yours
gives you your second birth,

09:09.187 --> 09:12.848
she takes all your troubles upon herself.

09:23.834 --> 09:29.760
I have come here to tell you that
you have this power, all of you.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.608
If it is awakened

09:37.634 --> 09:40.823
and crosses through the six subtle centres,

09:40.848 --> 09:45.129
passes through our sixth centre here

09:45.154 --> 09:50.809
it gets connected to the all-pervading power of divine love.

10:04.722 --> 10:10.055
Einstein has said that he was tired,
Einstein was tired

10:10.080 --> 10:15.252
trying to find out about the theory of relativity.

10:29.914 --> 10:31.938
And he got very tired,

10:31.962 --> 10:35.662
he went into his garden and started playing…

10:35.758 --> 10:38.847
started playing with the soap bubbles.

10:49.197 --> 10:52.347
While playing with the soap bubbles, he says,

10:52.382 --> 10:55.622
I do not know from somewhere unknown

10:55.647 --> 10:59.459
the theory of relativity dawned upon me.

11:09.092 --> 11:13.220
He called it torsion area, in his own language.

11:18.098 --> 11:21.328
Even you  the disciple for it

11:21.392 --> 11:25.093
who discarded his master

11:25.125 --> 11:30.029
and said that there is something beyond us,

11:30.054 --> 11:33.078
where we have to go beyond our mind.

11:45.679 --> 11:50.332
Because  this mind,
because this mind,

11:50.565 --> 11:52.517
reacts to everything.

11:57.831 --> 12:00.561
It is all the time reacting.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.320
And that is how we are upset.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.866
These thoughts come to us

12:13.885 --> 12:18.440
all the time either from the future or from the past.

12:25.991 --> 12:30.039
But we cannot be in the present.

12:33.395 --> 12:36.077
One thought rises like this then falls on

12:36.102 --> 12:40.231
another thought rises like this and falls down.

12:46.715 --> 12:49.349
But when this Kundalini rises,

12:49.366 --> 12:53.325
these thoughts elongate and
there is a space in-between

12:53.366 --> 12:57.628
and that is the place where there is our present.

13:11.532 --> 13:14.555
So, we come in the present

13:17.546 --> 13:20.722
and reality is in the present.

13:25.652 --> 13:28.945
So you know the reality

13:29.049 --> 13:32.604
and you have the knowledge about yourself.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.176
How?

13:40.224 --> 13:45.663
Because when you get connected with this
all-pervading power, this divine power,

13:45.688 --> 13:52.608
your hands start emitting kind of
very nice cool vibrations.

14:11.339 --> 14:13.481
This is the Ruh.

14:15.346 --> 14:22.496
This is the divine cool breeze, of divine love.

14:28.590 --> 14:31.827
And in your hand on your fingertips,

14:31.852 --> 14:34.242
you can feel your centres.

14:41.264 --> 14:44.296
That means your hands start speaking,

14:48.654 --> 14:51.810
that’s what Mohammed Sahab has said.

14:51.835 --> 14:57.520
That at the time of Qiyama, your hands will speak.

15:07.784 --> 15:10.649
So this is the time of Qiyama,

15:10.652 --> 15:16.082
where thousands and thousands of people have felt it.

15:22.964 --> 15:28.656
If your hands don’t speak about your centres,

15:28.681 --> 15:33.317
then I would not say you really are a Muselmann.

15:44.292 --> 15:47.347
This is said by Mohammed Sahab.

15:50.416 --> 15:57.893
So as a result what we should expect is
that our hands should speak,

16:05.653 --> 16:12.586
so that we get the knowledge
about ourselves about our centres.

16:19.181 --> 16:22.033
We know about ourselves very well.

16:22.065 --> 16:32.947
Also, we know that this body of
ours is an instrument of God’s wish.

16:44.767 --> 16:49.779
Because now we are connected with the divine power.

16:49.832 --> 16:55.810
And we have all the knowledge
which is absolutely true.

17:06.076 --> 17:09.681
So, this is the path of absolute knowledge.

17:13.953 --> 17:20.430
Supposing there is a man
who talks big and boasts,

17:20.459 --> 17:24.292
how are we to know that
he is not a hypocrite?

17:35.634 --> 17:39.803
As soon as you put your hands towards that person,

17:39.829 --> 17:43.370
immediately you will know if it is hot

17:43.402 --> 17:47.903
or sometimes even you  get some little little bit prickles

17:47.928 --> 17:50.597
then you know he is not a good man.

18:05.473 --> 18:10.009
Not only that but supposing
you are suffering from some disease

18:10.042 --> 18:17.659
and you will not know it till you go through
the whole procedure of medical investigation.

18:28.367 --> 18:34.104
And also that they will not be very sure
as to what is wrong with you.

18:41.271 --> 18:44.961
But on your fingertips, you will know about yourself,

18:44.972 --> 18:46.870
what’s wrong with you.

18:57.008 --> 19:00.423
You will be all in charge,

19:04.349 --> 19:07.340
incomplete knowledge about yourself.

19:11.097 --> 19:16.109
And if you know how to correct your centres,

19:16.134 --> 19:19.302
you can correct the centres of others.

19:29.905 --> 19:32.976
Imagine what powers you have.

19:36.433 --> 19:40.577
For example, if this instrument is not connected,

19:40.639 --> 19:44.424
you won’t hear me and it is useless.

19:53.343 --> 19:57.074
But, if you are connected to the divine

19:57.085 --> 19:59.714
the energy starts flowing through you.

20:09.469 --> 20:14.239
But best is this power rises,
she passes through six centres,

20:14.264 --> 20:16.926
she enlightens them.

20:25.620 --> 20:28.064
She integrates them.

20:32.927 --> 20:35.831
Not only that, but

20:36.462 --> 20:41.060
it informs you

20:41.275 --> 20:45.204
what’s wrong with you and you can correct it.

20:55.708 --> 20:59.556
All your reactions stop.

21:03.262 --> 21:08.861
But you watch everything without thinking.

21:13.581 --> 21:17.430
Like you become a witness.

21:20.515 --> 21:22.482
In that witness state,

21:22.499 --> 21:25.238
you know the truth about everything.

21:30.787 --> 21:32.985
This is so simple.

21:35.363 --> 21:39.690
All this can happen without paying for it

21:43.434 --> 21:46.809
because kundalini doesn’t understand money

21:49.665 --> 21:52.466
nor God takes any money.

21:54.628 --> 21:59.782
It is different if you have to book
the hall, we pay for it,

22:05.680 --> 22:08.354
but not for kundalini awakening.

22:13.935 --> 22:17.287
And you get your experience.

22:17.312 --> 22:18.845
It’s not just talking.

22:18.877 --> 22:22.275
It is the experience on your fingertips

22:22.307 --> 22:25.595
and out of your fontanelle bone area.

22:39.468 --> 22:44.010
There’s no question of blind faith.

22:52.763 --> 22:58.947
It is just the complete understanding

22:58.990 --> 23:01.691
within yourself, of your being.

23:10.385 --> 23:13.022
This is what is Qiyama,

23:13.046 --> 23:17.596
it is where you evolve into a superhuman being.

23:26.067 --> 23:30.892
This country was especially blessed by the Sufis.

23:36.006 --> 23:39.514
They had the experience of the divine

23:39.539 --> 23:42.589
but they could not explain how get what it.

23:52.366 --> 23:55.016
But Mohammed Sahab has described it,

23:55.090 --> 24:02.144
that he was riding on a white horse,
which means the kundalini.

24:09.005 --> 24:14.241
And then he met Moses on the third heaven,

24:14.305 --> 24:18.373
which is true because we too know that all these

24:18.389 --> 24:21.679
prophets are on the third heaven.

24:32.321 --> 24:37.336
Whatever I am saying you can
verify after your realization.

24:44.665 --> 24:48.752
But as a result of kundalini awakening,

24:48.777 --> 24:52.971
all our enemies of anger,

24:53.051 --> 24:56.546
sexual misbehaviour,

24:57.788 --> 25:02.474
that all kinds of bribes, jealousies,

25:02.546 --> 25:04.270
all drop out.

25:19.428 --> 25:21.649
All the greed also drops out.

25:25.140 --> 25:27.267
Jealousies drop out

25:29.785 --> 25:32.181
because you are enlightened.

25:35.299 --> 25:39.711
In the darkness, you cannot see who is your enemy.

25:44.407 --> 25:47.375
But when you are enlightened,

25:47.394 --> 25:51.683
you know everything and you don’t do anything

25:51.708 --> 25:53.681
that is destructive.

26:04.218 --> 26:07.765
You drop all your destructive habits.

26:11.993 --> 26:17.087
And what comes in your heart is the joy,

26:17.161 --> 26:23.646
is the joy which cannot be described.

26:31.200 --> 26:36.985
For example, we have unhappiness
and happiness.

26:41.115 --> 26:43.122
Two sides of a coin.

26:47.678 --> 26:53.091
But after realization, you are in complete joy.

27:00.547 --> 27:04.276
And you become absolutely peaceful.

27:07.757 --> 27:10.979
Now what we need is peace.

27:13.899 --> 27:17.382
They are having so many peace conferences

27:17.415 --> 27:19.964
and spending so much money

27:19.997 --> 27:22.919
but they themselves are quarrelling.

27:31.710 --> 27:35.384
So what is the use of having those conferences?

27:39.619 --> 27:43.286
But you have to become peaceful within yourself

27:47.786 --> 27:51.182
because you become very collective.

27:55.141 --> 27:58.095
You develop the collective consciousness.

28:01.426 --> 28:03.473
Who is the other?

28:05.346 --> 28:09.734
You are the part and parcel of one god almighty.

28:15.125 --> 28:19.402
This house and can felt  for this hand,

28:19.479 --> 28:24.541
in the same way, we all feel
the same within ourselves.

28:32.925 --> 28:37.927
You’ll be surprised sometimes
we have a conference of people

28:37.967 --> 28:42.485
who come from sometimes eighty countries.

28:42.510 --> 28:46.840
Black, white, yellow, every colour.

28:46.884 --> 28:50.702
And there is no quarrel, no fighting.

29:08.217 --> 29:10.930
Thousands and thousands of them.

29:11.156 --> 29:13.981
They enjoy each other’s contrary

29:14.013 --> 29:16.108
and help each other.

29:24.116 --> 29:25.933
You may be in Turkey

29:25.973 --> 29:29.059
but you will find friends in all the countries,

29:29.084 --> 29:32.066
your brother are there and sister are there.

29:40.481 --> 29:42.616
You are no more alone.

29:45.280 --> 29:49.972
You can have them in every field of life,

29:50.053 --> 29:52.697
as your own brother.

29:58.582 --> 30:02.946
It is something we are not aware of ourselves

30:02.971 --> 30:07.808
that we don’t know how great our powers of love.

30:14.922 --> 30:20.106
That a drop which falls in the ocean
becomes the ocean.

30:20.200 --> 30:23.160
You also become the ocean,

30:23.176 --> 30:25.604
all your limitations drop out.

30:37.201 --> 30:40.811
This is what is going to happen to you tonight.

30:44.721 --> 30:48.657
I don’t know if I should ask you to ask me questions.

30:48.701 --> 30:51.608
But if you think it is important then ask,

30:51.624 --> 30:54.158
but ask something important questions

30:54.159 --> 30:58.909
because you shouldn’t disturb the people around.

31:28.405 --> 31:32.857
Another thing is, it will take hardly ten minutes

31:32.882 --> 31:37.963
or fifteen minutes for you all to get your self- realization.

31:45.569 --> 31:49.735
If anyone doesn’t want it,
they should leave the hall.

31:55.122 --> 31:59.892
The only condition is that

31:59.917 --> 32:04.480
you should forgive everyone.

32:09.585 --> 32:11.869
Also, forgive yourself.

32:15.334 --> 32:19.866
Just you have to say I forgive
everyone in your heart.

32:25.281 --> 32:30.560
Don’t also think whom you have to forgive
but in general,

32:30.585 --> 32:34.511
you should  say I forgive everyone.

32:42.687 --> 32:46.115
Also, you have to forgive yourself.

32:49.628 --> 32:55.090
You might have done something wrong, doesn’t matter.

32:59.562 --> 33:02.133
That was in the past.

33:04.280 --> 33:06.399
We are in the present.

33:09.464 --> 33:12.545
Another thing is, that

33:12.641 --> 33:17.541
whether you forgive or
you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

33:23.367 --> 33:28.051
But if you don't forgive
then you play to wrong hands.

33:32.726 --> 33:37.535
So, now we will have the session for self-realization.

33:43.632 --> 33:47.419
For that, can I request all the cameraman

33:47.452 --> 33:52.509
not to take any photograph and to keep quiet?

34:03.137 --> 34:04.604
Just for ten minutes.

34:06.552 --> 34:09.512
But when they will raise their hand

34:09.529 --> 34:13.675
saying they have got self-realization,
then we can take.

34:23.696 --> 34:26.703
So, please wait only for about ten minutes.

34:32.837 --> 34:36.402
Now, as I told you,

34:36.438 --> 34:39.255
you have to forgive yourself

34:39.272 --> 34:41.369
and you have to forgive others.

34:41.417 --> 34:43.107
This is very important.

34:52.516 --> 34:58.916
What you can do now is, just to put
both your hands towards to me like this.

35:06.928 --> 35:08.784
Just like this, simple like this.

35:09.969 --> 35:13.717
Do it like you do for Namaz. Please do like this.

35:20.576 --> 35:22.083
Alright.

35:33.356 --> 35:38.874
Please again forgive yourself
and forgive everyone else.

35:46.526 --> 35:55.641
Now, you can bend your head

35:58.846 --> 36:04.141
and put your left hand top of your

36:04.198 --> 36:09.473
fontanel bone area which was
the soft on your childhood,

36:09.481 --> 36:12.928
on top and above.

36:21.717 --> 36:25.153
Now see, if there is a cool or hot breeze

36:25.178 --> 36:29.029
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

36:29.046 --> 36:30.380
please move your hand.

36:43.006 --> 36:45.086
Have faith in yourself,

36:47.031 --> 36:49.182
forgive yourself.

36:52.891 --> 36:57.621
Alright, now please put your left hand towards me

36:57.656 --> 37:02.507
and with the right hand
please see, bend your head,

37:02.532 --> 37:08.656
please see if there is a cool breeze
coming out your fontanel bone area.

37:18.622 --> 37:22.621
If it is hot, then

37:22.679 --> 37:26.792
you have not forgiven either yourself or others.

37:26.827 --> 37:28.667
So Please do that now.

37:42.198 --> 37:43.920
Alright,

37:45.908 --> 37:48.132
now again, once more,

37:48.155 --> 37:50.951
put your right hand towards me like this open

37:50.976 --> 37:53.031
and see with your left hand.

37:53.042 --> 37:56.226
Bend your head and see for yourself

37:56.235 --> 38:02.081
is there a cool or hot breeze coming out
of your fontanel bone area.

38:15.042 --> 38:20.205
Now, please put your both the hands towards me

38:23.347 --> 38:28.552
and please don`t think,
can you do that, don`t think

38:58.581 --> 39:05.854
Now please see, if you are getting cool
or hot breeze on yourfingertips.

39:05.916 --> 39:07.979
It can be gentle

39:15.993 --> 39:20.873
or you are getting it on your palms

39:24.322 --> 39:27.782
or out of your fontanel bone area.

39:32.335 --> 39:39.509
Anywhere if you are getting cool or
hot breeze please raise your hands,

39:54.085 --> 39:57.767
You all become sufis now. Congratulations.

39:58.994 --> 40:01.224
May God bless you.

40:06.486 --> 40:09.605
Turkey is a very Divine place

40:12.946 --> 40:16.636
and such a short time you got your realization.

40:20.414 --> 40:23.548
Don't doubt it please.

40:27.048 --> 40:29.115
Alright, take down your hands.

40:40.115 --> 40:47.238
I saw more ladies in the airport [UNCLEAR] you see.

40:47.328 --> 40:54.341
but I want men also to become realized souls,
very important.

41:03.558 --> 41:10.005
Now you will know what is
pure love, pure compassion

41:17.019 --> 41:23.281
because this is the power of
Divine compassion, Divine Love.

41:29.814 --> 41:31.965
May God bless you all.

41:35.757 --> 41:40.758
They will sing one song which we shold clap

41:40.806 --> 41:46.654
and you will see that these vibrations
of cool breeze will increase.

42:02.014 --> 42:05.989
For five minutes, you just feel again.
