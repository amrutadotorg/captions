00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.897
You all have come now to Bangalore,

00:00:07.098 --> 00:00:12.438
and yesterday you had gone to Mysore,

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.832
which was ruled by Mahishasura.

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:20.935
That’s the reason you didn’t get your
food -

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:25.238
it crossed you.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.794
It’s better not to eat food in such places,
isn’t it?

00:00:31.154 --> 00:00:32.510
All right.

00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:39.665
So, it’s a very beautiful place
Bangalore is.

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:43.573
Climate is beautiful and you’ll find always

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:49.368
these rakshasas lived in places like this.

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:52.371
Like in Pune, you have, you know this
Rajneesh was there -

00:00:52.572 --> 00:00:55.532
here is this Mahishasura still.

00:00:55.733 --> 00:01:00.665
They always try to find places which are
cold

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:05.159
because they have so much heat in their
body.

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:14.252
Now as you know, there’s one more rakshasa
here who has to be exposed.

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:20.640
And this, today through our puja, we
should achieve.

00:01:27.393 --> 00:01:33.177
In the olden days, when the Goddess had
to fight the rakshasas,

00:01:33.378 --> 00:01:42.210
the rakshasas were not involved in human
beings as such.

00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:46.675
They didn’t become gurus or anything.

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:52.077
And so, now we find in Kali Yuga,

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:59.860
they have gone into the brains of sadhakas,
of their devotees.

00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:03.086
It’s very difficult to remove them.

00:02:03.287 --> 00:02:07.662
And once they go into the brain
of the sadhakas,

00:02:07.863 --> 00:02:12.228
then sadhakas become, of course, possessed,

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:17.768
they suffer, they have all kinds
of problems.

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.820
Despite that, they stick onto that person

00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:26.738
because they are mesmerized, very much
mesmerized.

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:33.125
And this mesmerism makes them absolutely
so strong headed

00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:38.491
that even if they have to die, they
won’t give up their gurus.

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:49.905
The main thing is that in this Kali Yuga
there are so many sadhakas,

00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:54.046
they are running helter and skelter.
They are running all over,

00:02:54.247 --> 00:02:58.835
trying to find out some way of finding
the truth.

00:02:59.036 --> 00:03:04.927
While when the market is on, you know,
you get people to sell it also.

00:03:05.128 --> 00:03:07.643
So that’s how so many have come up

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:12.851
and are trying these things, tricks,
on people all over.

00:03:13.052 --> 00:03:19.879
Most of them have gone to the Western
countries because people have money.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.644
Thank God we are not so rich in India

00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:29.152
that they could not befool us - especially
in America.

00:03:29.353 --> 00:03:36.211
And Americans took to these people as
a fish takes to water, very surprisingly.

00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:41.930
I went there and told them and warned
them - they wouldn’t listen to me.

00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:46.460
They can’t understand anything that you
can get without money.

00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:53.064
But despite all that, so many of you have
been able

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:57.226
to come to Sahaja Yoga and get
to the reality.

00:03:57.427 --> 00:04:04.118
It’s your destiny. It’s blessings to you
of your previous lives

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.558
that you could see it so clearly and come
to Sahaja Yoga;

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:13.914
and now you have grown so much, you have
become so matured

00:04:14.115 --> 00:04:20.639
and you understand what others are doing
is absolutely wrong.

00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:29.067
Also somebody told me about this fellow
Boy John (George) misbehaving

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:31.627
with these homosexuals and all that,

00:04:31.828 --> 00:04:34.977
and calling them “Hare Rama, Hare
Krishna” - all nonsense.

00:04:35.178 --> 00:04:40.627
Then I discovered that this story is very
prevalent in Kerala,

00:04:40.828 --> 00:04:45.505
where they say that Krishna when He became,

00:04:45.706 --> 00:04:52.503
I mean Vishnu, when He became Mohini,
He had a child from Shiva. Absurd.

00:04:52.704 --> 00:04:55.143
And now, Murti is telling me when I told
you this story,

00:04:55.344 --> 00:04:59.825
you said, “This is blasphemy, this is sin.”
Same way I feel.

00:05:00.026 --> 00:05:04.087
It’s very dangerous also to play about
with a person like Vishnu.

00:05:04.288 --> 00:05:07.045
He is a very dangerous deity.

00:05:07.246 --> 00:05:12.694
Shiva, ultimately, is very dangerous but
it takes time with Him.

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.799
But as far as Vishnu is concerned, one has
to be very careful,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.820
misbehaving like this. I don’t know
what is going to happen to them.

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:26.351
But they are so stupid, they are so stupid.

00:05:26.552 --> 00:05:33.460
One thing they should judge that if this
thing you are doing is good for them,

00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:39.345
is by God’s blessings, then why should you
get diseases?

00:05:41.108 --> 00:05:45.362
There is a regular one crore of people,
going to a nonsensical place

00:05:45.563 --> 00:05:48.444
where they have this Ayappa business,

00:05:48.645 --> 00:05:52.888
and they wear black dresses for one month,

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:57.041
and they have their beard and everything.

00:05:57.242 --> 00:06:03.094
They starve themselves, they go up, miles
together they climb,

00:06:03.295 --> 00:06:08.307
do all kinds of things that is a sort
of a suffering for one month.

00:06:08.508 --> 00:06:15.310
And eleven months they do everything.
This kind of a nonsense, you see.

00:06:15.511 --> 00:06:21.418
So now it has become like a craze like
jogging or something like that in Kerala.

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:26.888
And this year there were one crore
of people doing this stupid nonsense.

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:31.281
I mean, even in India we have such stupid
people, you can see that.

00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:37.697
But the number is not so much, I must say,
as it is in America, percentage.

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:42.330
In India, we are very conditioned
by this ritualism,

00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:45.650
especially in the South we have lots
of ritualistic things.

00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:49.790
And we are impressed by people if you take
out some watches,

00:06:49.991 --> 00:06:53.200
Swiss made watches, or things like that.

00:06:53.401 --> 00:06:56.449
To them, it’s something really remarkable
that how can you have

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:02.687
Swiss made watches here. Very simple
people.

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:11.527
They do not understand that none
of the incarnations did these tricks

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:21.290
and that truth should be based on
the tradition, on the shastras.

00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:26.589
It cannot deviate and whatever deviates

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:34.053
is actually heretic and also is blasphemy.

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:40.890
But as I told you the other day that those
people who talk of knowledge, like Sufis,

00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:46.444
who got their realisation, real Sufis, they
were called as heretics -

00:07:46.645 --> 00:07:52.132
they were thrown out of the religion.
Also the Christians -

00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:58.873
the early Christians, who were Gnostics -
were called as mad people, heretics.

00:07:59.074 --> 00:08:02.908
In the same way, those who are following
stupid things,

00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:09.295
and are following something that is very
black and dark, negative,

00:08:09.496 --> 00:08:13.172
will definitely go against Sahaja Yoga

00:08:13.373 --> 00:08:21.704
and will say that this is something heretic
or it is something that is blasphemy.

00:08:22.222 --> 00:08:25.997
But, as you understand now what it is,

00:08:26.198 --> 00:08:31.592
we have to bring forth new laws that those
who are not Sahaja Yogis

00:08:31.793 --> 00:08:35.325
are actually, if they are practicing any
religion,

00:08:35.533 --> 00:08:39.605
they are not doing the right thing.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.538
Slowly slowly, as Vatican is getting
exposed

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:46.495
and the Christian churches are getting
exposed,

00:08:46.696 --> 00:08:51.069
even in India, so many such organisations
are getting exposed,

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:56.092
and people are understanding that this is
very wrong.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:08.482
These ideas actually have come from
incarnations only,

00:09:08.683 --> 00:09:14.228
like Adi Shankaracharya himself has said,
“Tatatkim, tatatkim, tatatkim” -

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.178
if you have not followed your guru,
then “tatatkim”.

00:09:17.368 --> 00:09:21.832
So they said now any guru can come
from the jail,

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:28.542
can be a smuggler, can be anything,
characterless person -

00:09:28.746 --> 00:09:32.779
if you call him a guru, then he is a guru.

00:09:33.185 --> 00:09:39.338
Whatever we call somebody, say we call
somebody as a guru

00:09:39.851 --> 00:09:43.266
and we stick on, “This is my guru.”

00:09:43.467 --> 00:09:48.406
But what did the guru give to you, that
nobody asks.

00:09:48.607 --> 00:09:51.615
We just feel happy, “Oh, very nice.”

00:09:51.816 --> 00:09:56.892
It’s like the worms clinging onto the lotus
and saying, “Oh, we have lotus.”

00:09:57.093 --> 00:10:01.659
What about you, you are a worm still,
what is the use of these lotuses?

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.339
Or whether that is lotus or a snake, God
only knows.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:13.037
So a guru who doesn’t talk of realisation,
who doesn’t talk of Kundalini,

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:18.470
who doesn’t talk of ascent, who doesn’t
talk of second birth -

00:10:18.671 --> 00:10:23.144
cannot be a guru - minimum of minimum.

00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:30.275
So like we also believe in say Rama,
“I believe in Rama.” So what?

00:10:30.476 --> 00:10:34.470
Are you obliging Rama or Rama is obliging
you?

00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:38.067
“I believe in Christ” - so what?

00:10:38.268 --> 00:10:40.725
You believe in this, you believe in that -

00:10:40.926 --> 00:10:43.922
it’s such an absurd idea, still I never
understand

00:10:44.123 --> 00:10:47.716
when people say, “I believe in this.”

00:10:47.917 --> 00:10:51.431
But what does that mean, what does that
mean?

00:10:51.632 --> 00:10:54.233
You believe in Christ.

00:10:54.434 --> 00:10:57.239
You are leading a licentious life, you are
doing all kinds -

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:04.330
but “I believe in Christ, I believe
in God.”

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:09.610
Doing everything against divinity, and
“I believe”.

00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:14.092
So the question comes: what do you mean
by believing?

00:11:14.293 --> 00:11:19.864
It’s like, “I believe, it is silver” -
so what? It is silver.

00:11:20.065 --> 00:11:23.821
What does it make to you to believe by that
saying something

00:11:24.022 --> 00:11:29.237
you have done great? What is great in that?

00:11:29.438 --> 00:11:34.134
Now if you say, “I believe in
Shri Mataji” - so what?

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:40.786
All right, you believe in me because
of certain experiences - still what?

00:11:42.254 --> 00:11:49.142
Mataji should be in your life, should be
in your expression,

00:11:49.343 --> 00:11:54.941
in your behaviour, in your treatment
to others,

00:11:55.142 --> 00:11:59.439
in understanding each other, and loving
each other.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.506
That is what impresses people.

00:12:02.707 --> 00:12:05.654
People say, “All right, we’ll come to
Mataji, we’ll just pray to Her

00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:09.408
and go away - we’ll not talk to you.” Why?

00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:13.585
“Because we believe in Mataji, finished.”

00:12:15.428 --> 00:12:18.206
So now we have to understand that you
believe in Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:18.407 --> 00:12:23.018
of course, it is Shraddha (faith), it is
not a blind faith, I agreed,

00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:27.429
but still belief has to penetrate into your
being.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:32.027
This belief has to act, has to show
results,

00:12:32.228 --> 00:12:38.013
it has to work out in every way.

00:12:38.588 --> 00:12:42.458
Somebody might say that we believe
in Mataji and She does everything -

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:45.097
She’ll do bhakti for us.

00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:50.058
I should sit down and sing the song
of Mataji or what.

00:12:51.212 --> 00:12:57.587
So what is going to come from your side,
that is what we have to understand;

00:12:57.799 --> 00:13:01.137
and once that starts working, then these
demons

00:13:01.338 --> 00:13:05.791
and these rakshasas will all vanish,
no problem.

00:13:05.992 --> 00:13:10.314
So: “What am I doing for Sahaja Yoga?”

00:13:10.515 --> 00:13:14.124
We should ask the question, “What am I
doing?”

00:13:14.325 --> 00:13:20.215
Now if you make this instrument, and then
if it is not doing anything,

00:13:20.423 --> 00:13:24.191
what is the use of making the instrument?

00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:33.445
Now you are the light, you have got
enlightenment:

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.886
but what is the use of a light which is
hanging somewhere,

00:13:37.087 --> 00:13:40.588
which is not giving light to anyone?

00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:48.793
So when you are giving light to others,
in a very innocent manner,

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:54.203
in a very reciprocal manner - not this way
that we are giving light

00:13:54.404 --> 00:13:57.491
because we want to have an advantage
over it,

00:13:57.692 --> 00:14:02.689
or we want to show off or any all
nonsensical things that are there.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.925
Then the derailment starts.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:09.388
People start saying, “Oh, I am this,
I am that.”

00:14:10.119 --> 00:14:17.353
But with full understanding, that we are
instruments in the hands of the divinity

00:14:17.554 --> 00:14:24.261
and we are just enjoying that divinity
flowing through us and working out,

00:14:24.462 --> 00:14:26.899
you won’t feel tired, you won’t feel
upset,

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.057
you’ll not be in any way in trouble.

00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:36.128
But this has happened with you.

00:14:36.439 --> 00:14:42.167
You are so matured, but still, we all have
to decide

00:14:42.368 --> 00:14:47.391
that now we are going to India to get
ourselves the whole joy of the tour.

00:14:47.592 --> 00:14:50.413
But for what?

00:14:51.885 --> 00:14:56.426
Not to keep to yourself, but to share it
with others.

00:14:56.627 --> 00:15:01.439
This joy is for you to share it with
others.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:07.386
Unless and until you learn that, your ego
will come back again and again.

00:15:07.587 --> 00:15:12.415
And also you have seen the way

00:15:12.616 --> 00:15:18.838
people who have been even spreading Sahaja
Yoga got into the mess of ego.

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:24.642
So one has to be very careful. The more
you are rising in your divinity,

00:15:24.843 --> 00:15:29.499
the more you are maturing, you have
to be very careful.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:37.020
See on a tree if you see, if there’s
a leaf, no insect will enter.

00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:42.808
If there’s a flower, the insect will come
and it will make it into a fruit.

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:49.012
But when it is a fruit, then the insect
will enter and eat it off.

00:15:49.213 --> 00:15:52.482
So when you are becoming a fruit, you have
to be very careful

00:15:52.683 --> 00:15:55.676
that no insect should get into you.

00:15:55.877 --> 00:16:02.102
On the contrary, now you have [the]
capacity to destroy all the insects.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:10.209
And that is what is, I would say, is
the state where we should all come up to.

00:16:10.439 --> 00:16:12.769
So you are destroying insects on one side

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:17.157
and satisfying people on the other side.

00:16:17.505 --> 00:16:23.879
Collectivity is, of course no doubt, is
the only way you can be cleansed;

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.566
but the greater thing is to go out,
all out, to find out,

00:16:27.767 --> 00:16:30.807
“Where can I spread Sahaja Yoga?
Where can I go?

00:16:31.008 --> 00:16:35.050
What is the nearest village I can go?
Where will I work it out?”

00:16:35.251 --> 00:16:38.606
All those things the more you think,
the better it is,

00:16:38.807 --> 00:16:43.273
and you start moving in that direction.

00:16:43.474 --> 00:16:46.022
Once you start moving in that direction,
you will be surprised

00:16:46.223 --> 00:16:49.176
Sahaja Yoga will move ahead of you.

00:16:49.377 --> 00:16:52.136
You’ll meet the people whom you want,

00:16:52.337 --> 00:16:57.379
you’ll get all the necessary help that
you want,

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.644
suddenly you’ll find some people who will
come down

00:17:00.845 --> 00:17:05.070
and say, “Now, what can we do for you?”

00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:10.778
Every type of help starts coming to you
the way you expand yourself.

00:17:10.979 --> 00:17:16.498
It’s like the expanding your wings, like
a bird does,

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:23.569
and then you take off. But if you don’t
extend yourself,

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:29.808
you keep Sahaja Yoga to yourself only,
it doesn’t work.

00:17:31.182 --> 00:17:35.239
I know you love me very much and you know
I love you very much,

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.388
but don’t you think others should also
share this love,

00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:45.099
others should also have this?

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:50.038
Now when we start struggling, we also
struggle with people

00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:55.202
who are very difficult - like “my brother,
my brother’s son...”

00:17:55.403 --> 00:18:01.491
Just don’t go near my, get away.
My is the most difficult thing.

00:18:01.692 --> 00:18:06.155
You see, in my family, I don’t touch them

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:09.116
because once you go to my they sit
on your heads,

00:18:09.317 --> 00:18:14.809
or maybe they’ll sit on the heads of the
Sahaja Yogis or something, nothing.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.729
So don’t go to the people – “it is
my sister,

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.987
she is my sister-in-law”, nothing
of the kind.

00:18:21.188 --> 00:18:26.778
What you have to do is to see what is
beyond

00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:31.358
and the more you’ll go beyond, the better
it will be.

00:18:32.899 --> 00:18:35.931
See, you can see clearly, we’ve worked
so hard in Maharashtra,

00:18:36.132 --> 00:18:41.603
it is a useless place I find. Maharashtrian
Sahaja Yogis are few, very few,

00:18:41.804 --> 00:18:45.225
but whatever are there are also not
so good.

00:18:45.426 --> 00:18:49.237
While Delhi Sahaja Yogis, now here
in Madras, in Bangalore,

00:18:49.438 --> 00:18:53.617
see what nice Sahaja Yogis are there.

00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:58.288
So much work I have done there.

00:18:58.577 --> 00:19:04.807
So those who are very near to you, always
cannot see the greatness of you.

00:19:05.008 --> 00:19:10.479
Like if you go near the big mountain, you
cannot see the big mountain,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.673
you have to be away and then you see.
In the same way,

00:19:13.874 --> 00:19:16.837
when you want to do some work with anyone,

00:19:17.038 --> 00:19:20.280
try to see that you are not closely
related,

00:19:20.481 --> 00:19:25.054
nor do you have any connections with them.
Something unknown.

00:19:25.255 --> 00:19:28.485
These people are much better for you
to follow

00:19:28.686 --> 00:19:33.787
and they will keep your attention tight,
absolutely on you.

00:19:33.988 --> 00:19:39.044
Otherwise, the people who are known
to you will trouble you.

00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:42.328
Now there are many difficulties in
spreading Sahaja Yoga -

00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:48.372
there were many, many more before, slowly
these are coming down.

00:19:48.573 --> 00:19:52.742
Naturally, it is much better than at
the time of Thomas [the Apostle]

00:19:52.943 --> 00:19:56.968
because he had to hide his treatise
to save it from others.

00:19:57.169 --> 00:20:00.348
He thought a day will come when there
will be resurrection time,

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:04.209
then this treatise would be [revealed].
Imagine, only 48 years back,

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:09.785
now it would be around 53 or 50 years
back, it was discovered.

00:20:11.329 --> 00:20:16.583
It was not discovered before. He had
to hide it.

00:20:16.784 --> 00:20:19.177
But now we are not to hide.

00:20:19.378 --> 00:20:24.528
We are to go all out and must know,
must forgive.

00:20:24.729 --> 00:20:29.689
That, you see, ours is an open place where
anybody can come in.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.351
So we get all kinds of people - if you go
and meet people,

00:20:32.552 --> 00:20:38.171
also there is all kinds of oppositions,
all these things, doesn’t matter.

00:20:38.372 --> 00:20:42.755
Everything can be overcome, but first is
your own initiative

00:20:42.956 --> 00:20:47.516
and your own lethargy which has to be
overcome.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.282
Then it will start spreading out.

00:20:52.483 --> 00:20:55.418
Of course, we have already lot of Sahaja
Yogis -

00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:59.521
in Russia, if you see, we have so many,
in thousands.

00:20:59.722 --> 00:21:03.880
But in every place we can have lots
of people now

00:21:04.081 --> 00:21:08.374
and I’m sure this is a nice year where they
say so, predict

00:21:08.575 --> 00:21:11.488
that Sahaja Yoga will grow very much
this year.

00:21:11.718 --> 00:21:14.836
So this is the beginning we are starting
today.

00:21:15.052 --> 00:21:18.027
I just wanted to tell you that you have
the power,

00:21:18.228 --> 00:21:21.978
you have the shakti within your reach.

00:21:22.179 --> 00:21:27.552
They said it was very cold one day before
I came here,

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:31.095
I said, “Don’t worry.” I didn’t give
bandhan or anything.

00:21:31.296 --> 00:21:36.842
I just came here and how they know!

00:21:37.043 --> 00:21:41.241
It’s become all right, you are sitting
in your kurta pyjamas.

00:21:41.442 --> 00:21:46.690
Otherwise, you would have been in your
three-piece suits shivering.

00:21:46.891 --> 00:21:52.467
That’s how it works. But you have to be
that way dedicated.

00:21:52.668 --> 00:21:57.071
Now for all these: Surya [sun] and Chandra
[moon]

00:21:57.272 --> 00:22:04.147
and all these stars and the whole cosmos
has only one thing to do -

00:22:04.348 --> 00:22:10.509
is to see that Sahaja Yoga is spreading
well,

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.925
is settling well and is achieving its goal.

00:22:17.888 --> 00:22:20.866
Every element is working it out.

00:22:21.067 --> 00:22:25.837
Everything is working - this Paramchaitanya
is working around in so many ways.

00:22:26.038 --> 00:22:28.467
You are not to be convinced about me,
I know.

00:22:28.668 --> 00:22:30.505
But now you have to be convinced
about yourself

00:22:30.723 --> 00:22:34.368
that you have all the powers within you.

00:22:34.569 --> 00:22:37.742
I mean, I don’t do anything really, to be
very frank.

00:22:37.943 --> 00:22:42.508
If I could do everything, I would not have
had you, I would have done it myself.

00:22:42.709 --> 00:22:45.902
But you have to do it - you are my
channels.

00:22:46.103 --> 00:22:51.372
You are the channels of Shakti. But do it
in a way which is gracious,

00:22:51.573 --> 00:22:55.323
which is beautiful, which is very
satisfying.

00:22:55.524 --> 00:23:01.091
Like yesterday, that musician - he just
wanted to entertain you.

00:23:01.292 --> 00:23:07.288
He wanted to play. I mean, he was
enjoying it.

00:23:07.489 --> 00:23:13.732
In the same way, we should want to do it.
I don’t have to tell you.

00:23:13.933 --> 00:23:19.159
And I am sure, in every area that you work,

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.494
in every personality whom you meet,

00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:27.168
you can start talking about Sahaja Yoga
and tell them.

00:23:27.369 --> 00:23:30.758
It works. It acts.

00:23:30.959 --> 00:23:36.073
Moreover, it is behind you the whole power
of all the deities,

00:23:36.274 --> 00:23:40.322
and in front is Sahaja Yoga running
forward fast, this Paramchaitanya:

00:23:40.523 --> 00:23:42.814
“Now the Sahaja Yogis are coming,
all right,

00:23:43.015 --> 00:23:48.701
let them not eat their food, finished” -
organising.

00:23:48.955 --> 00:23:52.879
Everything so beautifully done. Now
see the arrangements and all -

00:23:53.094 --> 00:23:58.579
I mean, I was thinking such few people
here, and about 20 Sahaja Yogis in Madras -

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:03.008
can you believe it, all this arrangement?

00:24:03.797 --> 00:24:11.535
How it’s working out, how it is giving
results, it’s really remarkable.

00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:17.507
So have faith in yourself, have faith
in all of them helping you,

00:24:17.708 --> 00:24:20.927
not to be nervous and just go ahead.

00:24:21.128 --> 00:24:25.733
Because the shakti is in you. You have
the power.

00:24:25.934 --> 00:24:29.962
Every kind of power you have, I assure
you, you have every power.

00:24:30.163 --> 00:24:32.192
Ask for it and you’ll
have it.

00:24:32.393 --> 00:24:34.925
Whatever you ask for it, it will happen.

00:24:35.126 --> 00:24:42.392
But don’t hesitate. As I said the other
day, that I make you sit on the throne,

00:24:42.593 --> 00:24:46.438
then also I put the crown on your head.

00:24:46.639 --> 00:24:53.570
And also I say, “Now you are the king,”
but still you are running away

00:24:53.771 --> 00:24:57.040
and not believing me - looking this side
with fear –

00:24:57.241 --> 00:25:00.391
“Am I a king really? How can I be?”

00:25:00.592 --> 00:25:04.765
That’s not the way. Have faith in yourself.

00:25:04.966 --> 00:25:08.912
I am very happy you all have come here.

00:25:09.113 --> 00:25:12.587
We are trying to do whatever is possible

00:25:12.788 --> 00:25:19.320
to make you comfortable and for you
to provide whatever is necessary.

00:25:19.521 --> 00:25:24.154
Of course, you are only just Spirits

00:25:24.355 --> 00:25:28.570
and you try to find the comfort of your
Spirit.

00:25:28.771 --> 00:25:33.765
I know that you are very adjusting
yourself.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.444
Everybody is surprised how you people
from the West -

00:25:37.645 --> 00:25:43.706
who just believe in materialism - can take
to Sahaja Yoga: they are quite surprised.

00:25:45.155 --> 00:25:50.864
But you are all very sweet people,

00:25:51.065 --> 00:25:57.817
I think, something very special who have
come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:59.097 --> 00:26:04.667
And by God’s grace, I’m sure

00:26:04.874 --> 00:26:09.291
you will be the people who will be
the foundation of Sahaja Yoga

00:26:09.492 --> 00:26:19.960
and you will build the great mansion
of Sahaja Yoga

00:26:20.325 --> 00:26:28.617
with your wisdom, faith, shakti and love.

00:26:28.818 --> 00:26:34.968
Today we’ll worship the Shakti - it’s very
much needed -

00:26:35.169 --> 00:26:40.398
the Shakti who destroyed all the devils,
all the rakshasas.

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:46.866
That is what we are going to worship
today - the Shakti within you and without.

00:26:47.067 --> 00:26:50.134
It’s your desire which is going to work.

00:26:50.335 --> 00:26:55.595
So today we are going to worship
the Shakti itself - Mahakali.

00:26:55.796 --> 00:26:58.898
May God bless you.
