WEBVTT

00:02.480 --> 00:06.897
You all have come now to Bangalore,

00:07.098 --> 00:12.438
and yesterday you had gone to Mysore,

00:12.639 --> 00:16.832
which was ruled by Mahishasura.

00:17.033 --> 00:20.935
That’s the reason you didn’t get your
food -

00:22.923 --> 00:25.238
it crossed you.

00:25.439 --> 00:30.794
It’s better not to eat food in such places,
isn’t it?

00:31.154 --> 00:32.510
All right.

00:32.711 --> 00:39.665
So, it’s a very beautiful place
Bangalore is.

00:39.866 --> 00:43.573
Climate is beautiful and you’ll find always

00:43.774 --> 00:49.368
these rakshasas lived in places like this.

00:49.569 --> 00:52.371
Like in Pune, you have, you know this
Rajneesh was there -

00:52.572 --> 00:55.532
here is this Mahishasura still.

00:55.733 --> 01:00.665
They always try to find places which are
cold

01:00.866 --> 01:05.159
because they have so much heat in their
body.

01:06.691 --> 01:14.252
Now as you know, there’s one more rakshasa
here who has to be exposed.

01:14.675 --> 01:20.640
And this, today through our puja, we
should achieve.

01:27.393 --> 01:33.177
In the olden days, when the Goddess had
to fight the rakshasas,

01:33.378 --> 01:42.210
the rakshasas were not involved in human
beings as such.

01:42.411 --> 01:46.675
They didn’t become gurus or anything.

01:46.876 --> 01:52.077
And so, now we find in Kali Yuga,

01:52.278 --> 01:59.860
they have gone into the brains of sadhakas,
of their devotees.

02:00.061 --> 02:03.086
It’s very difficult to remove them.

02:03.287 --> 02:07.662
And once they go into the brain
of the sadhakas,

02:07.863 --> 02:12.228
then sadhakas become, of course, possessed,

02:12.449 --> 02:17.768
they suffer, they have all kinds
of problems.

02:17.969 --> 02:21.820
Despite that, they stick onto that person

02:22.021 --> 02:26.738
because they are mesmerized, very much
mesmerized.

02:26.939 --> 02:33.125
And this mesmerism makes them absolutely
so strong headed

02:33.326 --> 02:38.491
that even if they have to die, they
won’t give up their gurus.

02:43.427 --> 02:49.905
The main thing is that in this Kali Yuga
there are so many sadhakas,

02:50.106 --> 02:54.046
they are running helter and skelter.
They are running all over,

02:54.247 --> 02:58.835
trying to find out some way of finding
the truth.

02:59.036 --> 03:04.927
While when the market is on, you know,
you get people to sell it also.

03:05.128 --> 03:07.643
So that’s how so many have come up

03:07.844 --> 03:12.851
and are trying these things, tricks,
on people all over.

03:13.052 --> 03:19.879
Most of them have gone to the Western
countries because people have money.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.644
Thank God we are not so rich in India

03:23.845 --> 03:29.152
that they could not befool us - especially
in America.

03:29.353 --> 03:36.211
And Americans took to these people as
a fish takes to water, very surprisingly.

03:36.412 --> 03:41.930
I went there and told them and warned
them - they wouldn’t listen to me.

03:42.131 --> 03:46.460
They can’t understand anything that you
can get without money.

03:46.661 --> 03:53.064
But despite all that, so many of you have
been able

03:53.265 --> 03:57.226
to come to Sahaja Yoga and get
to the reality.

03:57.427 --> 04:04.118
It’s your destiny. It’s blessings to you
of your previous lives

04:04.319 --> 04:08.558
that you could see it so clearly and come
to Sahaja Yoga;

04:08.759 --> 04:13.914
and now you have grown so much, you have
become so matured

04:14.115 --> 04:20.639
and you understand what others are doing
is absolutely wrong.

04:24.726 --> 04:29.067
Also somebody told me about this fellow
Boy John (George) misbehaving

04:29.268 --> 04:31.627
with these homosexuals and all that,

04:31.828 --> 04:34.977
and calling them “Hare Rama, Hare
Krishna” - all nonsense.

04:35.178 --> 04:40.627
Then I discovered that this story is very
prevalent in Kerala,

04:40.828 --> 04:45.505
where they say that Krishna when He became,

04:45.706 --> 04:52.503
I mean Vishnu, when He became Mohini,
He had a child from Shiva. Absurd.

04:52.704 --> 04:55.143
And now, Murti is telling me when I told
you this story,

04:55.344 --> 04:59.825
you said, “This is blasphemy, this is sin.”
Same way I feel.

05:00.026 --> 05:04.087
It’s very dangerous also to play about
with a person like Vishnu.

05:04.288 --> 05:07.045
He is a very dangerous deity.

05:07.246 --> 05:12.694
Shiva, ultimately, is very dangerous but
it takes time with Him.

05:12.895 --> 05:16.799
But as far as Vishnu is concerned, one has
to be very careful,

05:17.000 --> 05:20.820
misbehaving like this. I don’t know
what is going to happen to them.

05:21.021 --> 05:26.351
But they are so stupid, they are so stupid.

05:26.552 --> 05:33.460
One thing they should judge that if this
thing you are doing is good for them,

05:33.671 --> 05:39.345
is by God’s blessings, then why should you
get diseases?

05:41.108 --> 05:45.362
There is a regular one crore of people,
going to a nonsensical place

05:45.563 --> 05:48.444
where they have this Ayappa business,

05:48.645 --> 05:52.888
and they wear black dresses for one month,

05:53.089 --> 05:57.041
and they have their beard and everything.

05:57.242 --> 06:03.094
They starve themselves, they go up, miles
together they climb,

06:03.295 --> 06:08.307
do all kinds of things that is a sort
of a suffering for one month.

06:08.508 --> 06:15.310
And eleven months they do everything.
This kind of a nonsense, you see.

06:15.511 --> 06:21.418
So now it has become like a craze like
jogging or something like that in Kerala.

06:21.619 --> 06:26.888
And this year there were one crore
of people doing this stupid nonsense.

06:27.089 --> 06:31.281
I mean, even in India we have such stupid
people, you can see that.

06:31.482 --> 06:37.697
But the number is not so much, I must say,
as it is in America, percentage.

06:37.898 --> 06:42.330
In India, we are very conditioned
by this ritualism,

06:42.531 --> 06:45.650
especially in the South we have lots
of ritualistic things.

06:45.851 --> 06:49.790
And we are impressed by people if you take
out some watches,

06:49.991 --> 06:53.200
Swiss made watches, or things like that.

06:53.401 --> 06:56.449
To them, it’s something really remarkable
that how can you have

06:56.650 --> 07:02.687
Swiss made watches here. Very simple
people.

07:03.069 --> 07:11.527
They do not understand that none
of the incarnations did these tricks

07:12.015 --> 07:21.290
and that truth should be based on
the tradition, on the shastras.

07:21.491 --> 07:26.589
It cannot deviate and whatever deviates

07:26.790 --> 07:34.053
is actually heretic and also is blasphemy.

07:34.254 --> 07:40.890
But as I told you the other day that those
people who talk of knowledge, like Sufis,

07:41.091 --> 07:46.444
who got their realisation, real Sufis, they
were called as heretics -

07:46.645 --> 07:52.132
they were thrown out of the religion.
Also the Christians -

07:52.333 --> 07:58.873
the early Christians, who were Gnostics -
were called as mad people, heretics.

07:59.074 --> 08:02.908
In the same way, those who are following
stupid things,

08:03.109 --> 08:09.295
and are following something that is very
black and dark, negative,

08:09.496 --> 08:13.172
will definitely go against Sahaja Yoga

08:13.373 --> 08:21.704
and will say that this is something heretic
or it is something that is blasphemy.

08:22.222 --> 08:25.997
But, as you understand now what it is,

08:26.198 --> 08:31.592
we have to bring forth new laws that those
who are not Sahaja Yogis

08:31.793 --> 08:35.325
are actually, if they are practicing any
religion,

08:35.533 --> 08:39.605
they are not doing the right thing.

08:39.820 --> 08:43.538
Slowly slowly, as Vatican is getting
exposed

08:43.739 --> 08:46.495
and the Christian churches are getting
exposed,

08:46.696 --> 08:51.069
even in India, so many such organisations
are getting exposed,

08:51.270 --> 08:56.092
and people are understanding that this is
very wrong.

08:57.620 --> 09:08.482
These ideas actually have come from
incarnations only,

09:08.683 --> 09:14.228
like Adi Shankaracharya himself has said,
“Tatatkim, tatatkim, tatatkim” -

09:14.429 --> 09:17.178
if you have not followed your guru,
then “tatatkim”.

09:17.368 --> 09:21.832
So they said now any guru can come
from the jail,

09:22.033 --> 09:28.542
can be a smuggler, can be anything,
characterless person -

09:28.746 --> 09:32.779
if you call him a guru, then he is a guru.

09:33.185 --> 09:39.338
Whatever we call somebody, say we call
somebody as a guru

09:39.851 --> 09:43.266
and we stick on, “This is my guru.”

09:43.467 --> 09:48.406
But what did the guru give to you, that
nobody asks.

09:48.607 --> 09:51.615
We just feel happy, “Oh, very nice.”

09:51.816 --> 09:56.892
It’s like the worms clinging onto the lotus
and saying, “Oh, we have lotus.”

09:57.093 --> 10:01.659
What about you, you are a worm still,
what is the use of these lotuses?

10:01.860 --> 10:06.339
Or whether that is lotus or a snake, God
only knows.

10:06.540 --> 10:13.037
So a guru who doesn’t talk of realisation,
who doesn’t talk of Kundalini,

10:13.238 --> 10:18.470
who doesn’t talk of ascent, who doesn’t
talk of second birth -

10:18.671 --> 10:23.144
cannot be a guru - minimum of minimum.

10:24.001 --> 10:30.275
So like we also believe in say Rama,
“I believe in Rama.” So what?

10:30.476 --> 10:34.470
Are you obliging Rama or Rama is obliging
you?

10:34.671 --> 10:38.067
“I believe in Christ” - so what?

10:38.268 --> 10:40.725
You believe in this, you believe in that -

10:40.926 --> 10:43.922
it’s such an absurd idea, still I never
understand

10:44.123 --> 10:47.716
when people say, “I believe in this.”

10:47.917 --> 10:51.431
But what does that mean, what does that
mean?

10:51.632 --> 10:54.233
You believe in Christ.

10:54.434 --> 10:57.239
You are leading a licentious life, you are
doing all kinds -

10:57.440 --> 11:04.330
but “I believe in Christ, I believe
in God.”

11:04.531 --> 11:09.610
Doing everything against divinity, and
“I believe”.

11:09.955 --> 11:14.092
So the question comes: what do you mean
by believing?

11:14.293 --> 11:19.864
It’s like, “I believe, it is silver” -
so what? It is silver.

11:20.065 --> 11:23.821
What does it make to you to believe by that
saying something

11:24.022 --> 11:29.237
you have done great? What is great in that?

11:29.438 --> 11:34.134
Now if you say, “I believe in
Shri Mataji” - so what?

11:35.528 --> 11:40.786
All right, you believe in me because
of certain experiences - still what?

11:42.254 --> 11:49.142
Mataji should be in your life, should be
in your expression,

11:49.343 --> 11:54.941
in your behaviour, in your treatment
to others,

11:55.142 --> 11:59.439
in understanding each other, and loving
each other.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.506
That is what impresses people.

12:02.707 --> 12:05.654
People say, “All right, we’ll come to
Mataji, we’ll just pray to Her

12:05.855 --> 12:09.408
and go away - we’ll not talk to you.” Why?

12:09.609 --> 12:13.585
“Because we believe in Mataji, finished.”

12:15.428 --> 12:18.206
So now we have to understand that you
believe in Sahaja Yoga,

12:18.407 --> 12:23.018
of course, it is Shraddha (faith), it is
not a blind faith, I agreed,

12:23.219 --> 12:27.429
but still belief has to penetrate into your
being.

12:27.630 --> 12:32.027
This belief has to act, has to show
results,

12:32.228 --> 12:38.013
it has to work out in every way.

12:38.588 --> 12:42.458
Somebody might say that we believe
in Mataji and She does everything -

12:42.659 --> 12:45.097
She’ll do bhakti for us.

12:45.298 --> 12:50.058
I should sit down and sing the song
of Mataji or what.

12:51.212 --> 12:57.587
So what is going to come from your side,
that is what we have to understand;

12:57.799 --> 13:01.137
and once that starts working, then these
demons

13:01.338 --> 13:05.791
and these rakshasas will all vanish,
no problem.

13:05.992 --> 13:10.314
So: “What am I doing for Sahaja Yoga?”

13:10.515 --> 13:14.124
We should ask the question, “What am I
doing?”

13:14.325 --> 13:20.215
Now if you make this instrument, and then
if it is not doing anything,

13:20.423 --> 13:24.191
what is the use of making the instrument?

13:28.825 --> 13:33.445
Now you are the light, you have got
enlightenment:

13:33.910 --> 13:36.886
but what is the use of a light which is
hanging somewhere,

13:37.087 --> 13:40.588
which is not giving light to anyone?

13:42.338 --> 13:48.793
So when you are giving light to others,
in a very innocent manner,

13:48.994 --> 13:54.203
in a very reciprocal manner - not this way
that we are giving light

13:54.404 --> 13:57.491
because we want to have an advantage
over it,

13:57.692 --> 14:02.689
or we want to show off or any all
nonsensical things that are there.

14:02.890 --> 14:04.925
Then the derailment starts.

14:05.150 --> 14:09.388
People start saying, “Oh, I am this,
I am that.”

14:10.119 --> 14:17.353
But with full understanding, that we are
instruments in the hands of the divinity

14:17.554 --> 14:24.261
and we are just enjoying that divinity
flowing through us and working out,

14:24.462 --> 14:26.899
you won’t feel tired, you won’t feel
upset,

14:27.100 --> 14:32.057
you’ll not be in any way in trouble.

14:32.621 --> 14:36.128
But this has happened with you.

14:36.439 --> 14:42.167
You are so matured, but still, we all have
to decide

14:42.368 --> 14:47.391
that now we are going to India to get
ourselves the whole joy of the tour.

14:47.592 --> 14:50.413
But for what?

14:51.885 --> 14:56.426
Not to keep to yourself, but to share it
with others.

14:56.627 --> 15:01.439
This joy is for you to share it with
others.

15:01.640 --> 15:07.386
Unless and until you learn that, your ego
will come back again and again.

15:07.587 --> 15:12.415
And also you have seen the way

15:12.616 --> 15:18.838
people who have been even spreading Sahaja
Yoga got into the mess of ego.

15:19.039 --> 15:24.642
So one has to be very careful. The more
you are rising in your divinity,

15:24.843 --> 15:29.499
the more you are maturing, you have
to be very careful.

15:29.700 --> 15:37.020
See on a tree if you see, if there’s
a leaf, no insect will enter.

15:37.221 --> 15:42.808
If there’s a flower, the insect will come
and it will make it into a fruit.

15:43.009 --> 15:49.012
But when it is a fruit, then the insect
will enter and eat it off.

15:49.213 --> 15:52.482
So when you are becoming a fruit, you have
to be very careful

15:52.683 --> 15:55.676
that no insect should get into you.

15:55.877 --> 16:02.102
On the contrary, now you have [the]
capacity to destroy all the insects.

16:02.310 --> 16:10.209
And that is what is, I would say, is
the state where we should all come up to.

16:10.439 --> 16:12.769
So you are destroying insects on one side

16:12.970 --> 16:17.157
and satisfying people on the other side.

16:17.505 --> 16:23.879
Collectivity is, of course no doubt, is
the only way you can be cleansed;

16:24.080 --> 16:27.566
but the greater thing is to go out,
all out, to find out,

16:27.767 --> 16:30.807
“Where can I spread Sahaja Yoga?
Where can I go?

16:31.008 --> 16:35.050
What is the nearest village I can go?
Where will I work it out?”

16:35.251 --> 16:38.606
All those things the more you think,
the better it is,

16:38.807 --> 16:43.273
and you start moving in that direction.

16:43.474 --> 16:46.022
Once you start moving in that direction,
you will be surprised

16:46.223 --> 16:49.176
Sahaja Yoga will move ahead of you.

16:49.377 --> 16:52.136
You’ll meet the people whom you want,

16:52.337 --> 16:57.379
you’ll get all the necessary help that
you want,

16:57.580 --> 17:00.644
suddenly you’ll find some people who will
come down

17:00.845 --> 17:05.070
and say, “Now, what can we do for you?”

17:05.271 --> 17:10.778
Every type of help starts coming to you
the way you expand yourself.

17:10.979 --> 17:16.498
It’s like the expanding your wings, like
a bird does,

17:16.699 --> 17:23.569
and then you take off. But if you don’t
extend yourself,

17:23.809 --> 17:29.808
you keep Sahaja Yoga to yourself only,
it doesn’t work.

17:31.182 --> 17:35.239
I know you love me very much and you know
I love you very much,

17:35.440 --> 17:41.388
but don’t you think others should also
share this love,

17:41.589 --> 17:45.099
others should also have this?

17:45.300 --> 17:50.038
Now when we start struggling, we also
struggle with people

17:50.239 --> 17:55.202
who are very difficult - like “my brother,
my brother’s son...”

17:55.403 --> 18:01.491
Just don’t go near my, get away.
My is the most difficult thing.

18:01.692 --> 18:06.155
You see, in my family, I don’t touch them

18:06.378 --> 18:09.116
because once you go to my they sit
on your heads,

18:09.317 --> 18:14.809
or maybe they’ll sit on the heads of the
Sahaja Yogis or something, nothing.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.729
So don’t go to the people – “it is
my sister,

18:17.930 --> 18:20.987
she is my sister-in-law”, nothing
of the kind.

18:21.188 --> 18:26.778
What you have to do is to see what is
beyond

18:26.979 --> 18:31.358
and the more you’ll go beyond, the better
it will be.

18:32.899 --> 18:35.931
See, you can see clearly, we’ve worked
so hard in Maharashtra,

18:36.132 --> 18:41.603
it is a useless place I find. Maharashtrian
Sahaja Yogis are few, very few,

18:41.804 --> 18:45.225
but whatever are there are also not
so good.

18:45.426 --> 18:49.237
While Delhi Sahaja Yogis, now here
in Madras, in Bangalore,

18:49.438 --> 18:53.617
see what nice Sahaja Yogis are there.

18:54.739 --> 18:58.288
So much work I have done there.

18:58.577 --> 19:04.807
So those who are very near to you, always
cannot see the greatness of you.

19:05.008 --> 19:10.479
Like if you go near the big mountain, you
cannot see the big mountain,

19:10.680 --> 19:13.673
you have to be away and then you see.
In the same way,

19:13.874 --> 19:16.837
when you want to do some work with anyone,

19:17.038 --> 19:20.280
try to see that you are not closely
related,

19:20.481 --> 19:25.054
nor do you have any connections with them.
Something unknown.

19:25.255 --> 19:28.485
These people are much better for you
to follow

19:28.686 --> 19:33.787
and they will keep your attention tight,
absolutely on you.

19:33.988 --> 19:39.044
Otherwise, the people who are known
to you will trouble you.

19:39.245 --> 19:42.328
Now there are many difficulties in
spreading Sahaja Yoga -

19:42.529 --> 19:48.372
there were many, many more before, slowly
these are coming down.

19:48.573 --> 19:52.742
Naturally, it is much better than at
the time of Thomas [the Apostle]

19:52.943 --> 19:56.968
because he had to hide his treatise
to save it from others.

19:57.169 --> 20:00.348
He thought a day will come when there
will be resurrection time,

20:00.549 --> 20:04.209
then this treatise would be [revealed].
Imagine, only 48 years back,

20:04.410 --> 20:09.785
now it would be around 53 or 50 years
back, it was discovered.

20:11.329 --> 20:16.583
It was not discovered before. He had
to hide it.

20:16.784 --> 20:19.177
But now we are not to hide.

20:19.378 --> 20:24.528
We are to go all out and must know,
must forgive.

20:24.729 --> 20:29.689
That, you see, ours is an open place where
anybody can come in.

20:29.890 --> 20:32.351
So we get all kinds of people - if you go
and meet people,

20:32.552 --> 20:38.171
also there is all kinds of oppositions,
all these things, doesn’t matter.

20:38.372 --> 20:42.755
Everything can be overcome, but first is
your own initiative

20:42.956 --> 20:47.516
and your own lethargy which has to be
overcome.

20:50.130 --> 20:52.282
Then it will start spreading out.

20:52.483 --> 20:55.418
Of course, we have already lot of Sahaja
Yogis -

20:55.619 --> 20:59.521
in Russia, if you see, we have so many,
in thousands.

20:59.722 --> 21:03.880
But in every place we can have lots
of people now

21:04.081 --> 21:08.374
and I’m sure this is a nice year where they
say so, predict

21:08.575 --> 21:11.488
that Sahaja Yoga will grow very much
this year.

21:11.718 --> 21:14.836
So this is the beginning we are starting
today.

21:15.052 --> 21:18.027
I just wanted to tell you that you have
the power,

21:18.228 --> 21:21.978
you have the shakti within your reach.

21:22.179 --> 21:27.552
They said it was very cold one day before
I came here,

21:27.753 --> 21:31.095
I said, “Don’t worry.” I didn’t give
bandhan or anything.

21:31.296 --> 21:36.842
I just came here and how they know!

21:37.043 --> 21:41.241
It’s become all right, you are sitting
in your kurta pyjamas.

21:41.442 --> 21:46.690
Otherwise, you would have been in your
three-piece suits shivering.

21:46.891 --> 21:52.467
That’s how it works. But you have to be
that way dedicated.

21:52.668 --> 21:57.071
Now for all these: Surya [sun] and Chandra
[moon]

21:57.272 --> 22:04.147
and all these stars and the whole cosmos
has only one thing to do -

22:04.348 --> 22:10.509
is to see that Sahaja Yoga is spreading
well,

22:10.710 --> 22:15.925
is settling well and is achieving its goal.

22:17.888 --> 22:20.866
Every element is working it out.

22:21.067 --> 22:25.837
Everything is working - this Paramchaitanya
is working around in so many ways.

22:26.038 --> 22:28.467
You are not to be convinced about me,
I know.

22:28.668 --> 22:30.505
But now you have to be convinced
about yourself

22:30.723 --> 22:34.368
that you have all the powers within you.

22:34.569 --> 22:37.742
I mean, I don’t do anything really, to be
very frank.

22:37.943 --> 22:42.508
If I could do everything, I would not have
had you, I would have done it myself.

22:42.709 --> 22:45.902
But you have to do it - you are my
channels.

22:46.103 --> 22:51.372
You are the channels of Shakti. But do it
in a way which is gracious,

22:51.573 --> 22:55.323
which is beautiful, which is very
satisfying.

22:55.524 --> 23:01.091
Like yesterday, that musician - he just
wanted to entertain you.

23:01.292 --> 23:07.288
He wanted to play. I mean, he was
enjoying it.

23:07.489 --> 23:13.732
In the same way, we should want to do it.
I don’t have to tell you.

23:13.933 --> 23:19.159
And I am sure, in every area that you work,

23:19.360 --> 23:23.494
in every personality whom you meet,

23:23.695 --> 23:27.168
you can start talking about Sahaja Yoga
and tell them.

23:27.369 --> 23:30.758
It works. It acts.

23:30.959 --> 23:36.073
Moreover, it is behind you the whole power
of all the deities,

23:36.274 --> 23:40.322
and in front is Sahaja Yoga running
forward fast, this Paramchaitanya:

23:40.523 --> 23:42.814
“Now the Sahaja Yogis are coming,
all right,

23:43.015 --> 23:48.701
let them not eat their food, finished” -
organising.

23:48.955 --> 23:52.879
Everything so beautifully done. Now
see the arrangements and all -

23:53.094 --> 23:58.579
I mean, I was thinking such few people
here, and about 20 Sahaja Yogis in Madras -

23:58.780 --> 24:03.008
can you believe it, all this arrangement?

24:03.797 --> 24:11.535
How it’s working out, how it is giving
results, it’s really remarkable.

24:12.529 --> 24:17.507
So have faith in yourself, have faith
in all of them helping you,

24:17.708 --> 24:20.927
not to be nervous and just go ahead.

24:21.128 --> 24:25.733
Because the shakti is in you. You have
the power.

24:25.934 --> 24:29.962
Every kind of power you have, I assure
you, you have every power.

24:30.163 --> 24:32.192
Ask for it and you’ll
have it.

24:32.393 --> 24:34.925
Whatever you ask for it, it will happen.

24:35.126 --> 24:42.392
But don’t hesitate. As I said the other
day, that I make you sit on the throne,

24:42.593 --> 24:46.438
then also I put the crown on your head.

24:46.639 --> 24:53.570
And also I say, “Now you are the king,”
but still you are running away

24:53.771 --> 24:57.040
and not believing me - looking this side
with fear –

24:57.241 --> 25:00.391
“Am I a king really? How can I be?”

25:00.592 --> 25:04.765
That’s not the way. Have faith in yourself.

25:04.966 --> 25:08.912
I am very happy you all have come here.

25:09.113 --> 25:12.587
We are trying to do whatever is possible

25:12.788 --> 25:19.320
to make you comfortable and for you
to provide whatever is necessary.

25:19.521 --> 25:24.154
Of course, you are only just Spirits

25:24.355 --> 25:28.570
and you try to find the comfort of your
Spirit.

25:28.771 --> 25:33.765
I know that you are very adjusting
yourself.

25:34.220 --> 25:37.444
Everybody is surprised how you people
from the West -

25:37.645 --> 25:43.706
who just believe in materialism - can take
to Sahaja Yoga: they are quite surprised.

25:45.155 --> 25:50.864
But you are all very sweet people,

25:51.065 --> 25:57.817
I think, something very special who have
come to Sahaja Yoga.

25:59.097 --> 26:04.667
And by God’s grace, I’m sure

26:04.874 --> 26:09.291
you will be the people who will be
the foundation of Sahaja Yoga

26:09.492 --> 26:19.960
and you will build the great mansion
of Sahaja Yoga

26:20.325 --> 26:28.617
with your wisdom, faith, shakti and love.

26:28.818 --> 26:34.968
Today we’ll worship the Shakti - it’s very
much needed -

26:35.169 --> 26:40.398
the Shakti who destroyed all the devils,
all the rakshasas.

26:40.599 --> 26:46.866
That is what we are going to worship
today - the Shakti within you and without.

26:47.067 --> 26:50.134
It’s your desire which is going to work.

26:50.335 --> 26:55.595
So today we are going to worship
the Shakti itself - Mahakali.

26:55.796 --> 26:58.898
May God bless you.
