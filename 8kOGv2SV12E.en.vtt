00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:45.630
I bow to all the seekers of truth. It was
tremendous joy for me to come to this beautiful

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:57.430
Island that nature has created for our pleasure
and happiness. We have to think about, God

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:10.860
has done so much, such beautiful things for
us and what have we done for him? Can we do

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:23.030
something for him? He is all powerful, all
knowing. What can we do for Him? What can

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:38.400
we praise Him? He’s glory personified, his
beauty, his compassion! Only thing that we

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:49.600
can do is to know him and to know God, is
important that we should seek him. If we seek

00:24:49.600 --> 00:25:01.400
Him, what do we do? Again the problem is what
do we do to seek Him. We don’t have to do

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:09.420
anything about it, as God has created this
beautiful Island, all the beautiful things

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:18.280
of the world, he has created you as beautiful
people. All human beings are created with

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:25.830
great delicate, compassionate attention of
the Divine. You are not just created out of

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:34.640
the blue, but with very great, great understanding,
you are a special category of human beings

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:45.950
God has created. And what he wants you to
know Him, that’s all. And to know Him what

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:53.550
should we do? Now for example I’m standing
before you, you see me standing before you.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:26:00.310
Whatever Warren has told you about me, you
know something. You know me because you can

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:12.560
see me in person here, but to know God what
do we have to do, is that our central nervous

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:20.230
system itself, our awareness itself, our attention
itself is to be enlightened.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:32.060
Let us not be persuaded by people who claim
that they know God. They use God as a means,

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:41.280
an instrument to build up and organise something.
How can it organise God, you cannot organise

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:49.640
God. He may organise you but you cannot organise
Him. It’s a very ego, sort of an idea, that

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:57.120
we are organising this organisation that organisation.
Sahaja Yoga has no organisation as such. We

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:03.410
have no president, we have nothing, it’s
just a thing that it should happen to you,

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:12.260
that you should become. It’s like a seed
sprouting, it’s a living process, it’s

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:21.840
a living process of the living God. Living
process, you cannot put any effort. If you

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:28.400
have to say to sprout a seed what effort can
you put in? If you have to transform a flower

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:35.810
into fruit what efforts can you put in? It’s
just built in and it works out but it shows

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:42.620
results. It is not that a seed will say I’m
the tree, it becomes a tree, does it? By professing

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:48.900
something, if the flower says I’m the fruit,
does it become a fruit? It does not! It has

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:56.050
to become! Becoming is the point we must remember.
If you are truthful, honest and if you are

00:27:56.050 --> 00:28:02.240
seekers we must know that for our benefit
we have to become! It’s no use belonging

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:09.550
to anything, no use professing anything, is
all nonsense because it will give you a false

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:15.970
notion about yourself. But reality will be
when you will feel it on your central nervous

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:20.180
system.
Unless and until you feel it on your central

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:24.220
nervous system, you should not even accept
me or no one. Why should you accept me? There

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:32.910
is no need! As long as you know that you have
to become something higher. Christ has said

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:38.340
very clearly, He said to Nichodemus, “I
say you are to be born again”. Now supposing

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:43.430
Nichodemus has taken a word I am born again
and put a certificate, self-certified born

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:52.180
again going around, and then fighting and
arguing and being violent. Is this the way?

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:57.930
It’s just a falsehood. You cannot just say,
if I say I am the Mayor of this place, do

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:04.360
I become? Every day to day life you know that
the authority has to be bestowed upon you.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:12.020
In the same way if you do not become you are
just professing one of the nonsenses which

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:19.400
our forefathers have done and they, everybody
has done in this world. Have you become something?

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:24.810
The time has come, now the time is there,
this is the special time when you can become.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:31.440
At this time, those people who just cling
onto things which have given them nothing

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:37.470
but an ego pampering, must realise that it
is high time that you come to reality and

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:43.470
understand that you have to know it on your
central nervous system as you know me standing

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:48.630
here.
If the central nervous system doesn’t give

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:54.720
you any indication then you should not accept
it. That’s one of the conditions of the

00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:02.100
truth – that truth is known on the central
nervous system. Projection, one can do anything,

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:07.520
I can say I’m this and that and that, I
can talk this and that and that… so what?

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:14.250
It’s all my projection, are you to believe?
Supposing I say I have found something great

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:20.080
and this is it and if I have a good brain
I can put up a big show before you, so must

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:27.910
you believe it? I can put on some horns and
come before you and say those horns are the

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:39.350
special ones that God has given me, are you
to believe? You have to believe when you know.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:44.130
For this God has made us so beautifully, that’s
what I wanted to show you, the chart (Image

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:49.370
of Virata on last page), how you are made.
Now in the bible there is a mention of the

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:54.740
word Holy Ghost. I asked a priest, I said
do you know what is the Holy Ghost is, he

00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:00.020
said I’m agnostic. I said you are agnostic,
how are you a priest? What are you doing about

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:07.930
it? He said I’m doing my job. I said job,
is this a job you can do? It’s not a job,

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:18.250
you cannot do a job with God, you have to
know Him, and to know him there is an arrangement

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:23.840
already made within you. The one who is our
creator, who has created all this beautiful

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:32.660
place, do you think He would not have made
us that way that we should know him? He is

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:39.030
more worried about his creation and the beauty
of that creation is expressed in human beings,

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:43.000
that they should know him. If that is the
purpose of His creation don’t you think

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.860
that he must have made some arrangements within
us for that? He must have done.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:57.550
For example when I landed here on the pier
(Ryde) it was written if you want to see this

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:02.150
place you better go here, better go there,
there’s a church you can see, you can see

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:09.760
this place. All organised arranged you see.
As soon as you come in there is a train for

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:16.180
you, as you walk into the ferry there’s
another way of getting out from here and getting

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:22.180
another train, it’s just ready everything
arranged. If human beings can arrange so well

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:27.260
what about God Almighty? He must have done
something special within us!

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:33.410
Now here there are two doctors one of them
is Dr. Warren who talked to me and there is

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:38.080
another Dr. Bogdhan, but both of them are
here and I’ll show you what is the subtle

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.410
side within us, how God has made us. In short
you can have a look at yourself (refer to

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:49.980
chart). Now when I say all this you are also
not to believe that… blindfolded. No use

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:55.670
believing in to it blindfolded, you can see
for yourself if it works out or not. I cannot

00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:00.350
even guarantee that it will work out in you,
I cannot guarantee. You see you cannot say

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:08.300
that this flower will become a fruit can you
say that? But one can try. If there is a possibility,

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:13.140
a potentiality is there it will work out.
And there is a potentiality in every human

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:18.290
being that it can work out, but first of all
you have to be honest about it, you have to

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:26.450
be open about it.
Now within us are these seven centres, if

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:31.640
you see the red one, the yellow one, the green
one, the blue one and here is a little smoky

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:39.290
one and then here is like the light and ultimately
this big one which we call as Sahasrara. These

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:47.950
are the subtle centres and they control outside
the centres that are known to the doctors

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:57.850
as plexuses, outside in the gross. Now these
centres are very subtle centres and govern

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:04.450
our parasympathetic nervous system. And this
parasympathetic nervous system is beyond our

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:05.020
control.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:12.040
For example, when you want to increase the
beat of your heart you can run, you can do

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:17.930
some exercise, the heartbeat will increase.
But to reduce it there is a force of this

00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:27.980
parasympathetic which brings it down automatically,
spontaneously, Sahaj! Now when you go say

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:35.690
to think about, when you go to some Gurus
or some other people and you go and try to

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:43.110
seek somewhere else, apart from yourself,
then what happens? Then you start moving away

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:48.540
from the central path, we have to keep to
the central path and that’s why all the

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:54.940
religions have come, to keep the balance,
to keep the balance! And once you have the

00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:01.730
balance, then only it is easy for the ascent.
As you know, I was happy to know that in this

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:08.230
place you make some small aeroplanes. Now
the basic thing of aeroplane is that it should

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:14.110
be a balanced thing, if it is not balanced
properly it cannot ascend. The whole thing

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:20.070
depends on its balance and its angle, so it
has to have an angle upward and it has to

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:25.490
have balance. So the first thing is to have
the balance which takes place at this point

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.950
where you see the green, Void we call it.
(Refer to chart)

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:29.560
(Shri Mataji refers to chart at the Medina
Theatre)

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.540
Here the balance of the religion comes in.
All the religions of the world have come on

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:41.660
this Earth to tell us that be moderate, don’t
go to extremes. But we go to extremes absolutely

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:49.420
blindfolded, we follow extreme pattern of
life and then our balances go out. The another

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:55.850
thing of an aeroplane is that your eyes are
upward, you have to look upward and that is

00:35:55.850 --> 00:36:02.350
what Christ has done, to tell us that you
have to look upward. You are to be born again,

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:07.180
and when he said that Nichodemus asked Him,
he asked Him what do you mean? Am I to enter

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:13.640
into my mother’s womb? He said no, that’s
the flesh. The flesh can give birth to only

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.980
flesh but I am talking about the Spirit and
the Spirit has to give you the birth again,

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.330
and that’s what it is, has to happen within
us.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:29.200
Now this Kundalini about which He spoke is
at the base, at the bone called Sacrum bone.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.580
Sacrum, now see the word Sacrum itself is
suggestive it’s a sacred bone. I asked the

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:40.020
Greeks why you call it a sacrum bone? They
said that because they found that when you

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:45.920
burnt the body, you see in cremation, this
bone doesn’t burn so we thought it was some

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:52.110
sacred bone that was there. But it is more
than that, you see in through the unconscious

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.390
they must have known that this is a sacred
bone.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:37:03.730
In this bone lies the representation of the
Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost is the Mother. We say

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:12.870
God the Father, God the Son, have you ever
heard a father and a son without a Mother?

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:19.070
We don’t want to accept that there could
be a Mother. There could be a Mother! Christ

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:28.260
didn’t talk of his own Mother because he
was a little bit, acted on more understanding

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:33.250
that if he says that His Mother has any powers
they’ll first kill Her and the whole drama

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:40.270
of crucifixion will be spoilt. So he didn’t
talk about Her, but the Mother is the primordial

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:46.810
Mother represented within us, is this Kundalini
the Holy Ghost! And it is also said, the Holy

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:51.820
Ghost, the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.
It has to rise and come up.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:57.170
Now the misunderstanding of the Bible is so
much because of misinterpretations of people.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:01.970
Firstly I would say that people think that
when the Holy Ghost blesses you, you become

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:07.110
like a madman, you talk of funny things, it
is not so. One must understand what is written

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:12.380
in the bible clearly, that when they got the
Holy Ghost, the blessings of the Holy Ghost

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:18.950
the cool breeze came in and then they started
talking in strange languages with strange

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:24.040
hands, hand movements. Now what does that
mean? That means that they started talking

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:29.790
about the centres. When you hear these Sahaja
Yogis talking, they will not say that you

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:34.230
are suffering from ego, they’ll say, it’s
Agnya, Agnya chakra is catching. Christ’s

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:38.830
chakra is catching! They don’t talk on the
same language because it’s a subtler language,

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:45.100
so they talk on those languages and that’s
why it looks strange to a person who is not

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:50.170
exposed to this knowledge, to the deeper knowledge
of your being. Naturally it looks strange

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:54.630
and when they move their hands, they have
to use their hands because the power is flowing

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:59.040
through their hands so they move sometimes
like this, sometimes like this and then people

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:03.820
can think they are mad.
This is the big misunderstanding, then when

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:09.610
people say that the Holy Ghost has descended
on us and then that’s why we are behaving

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:18.240
like mad people, it’s the spirit, it’s
the dead spirit, is a possession, is a witchcraft!

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:23.620
And when it happens you don’t behave like
a mad person but you become the sanest of

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:28.980
the sanest, wisest of the wisest, you become
a balanced person, you become a beautiful

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:36.600
person, your face changes, the whole face
glows and the whole life changes. This is

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:43.200
what should happen a complete transformation.
Now we have here somebody who is a Sahaja

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:49.420
Yogi who is looking after the centre here
but he came through a girl who was in London

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:54.060
first time I met her, and she was a hippie,
a very clever, intelligent girl. She was a

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:59.660
hippie and taking drugs and when she came
to me, I mean she was absolutely in coma sort

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:04.720
of condition. I looked at her she couldn’t
even talk to me, I couldn’t talk to her

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:10.770
she was absolutely a gone case, she was a
seeker. And today she is a person who has

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:16.810
such a big organisation, you can call it,
we don’t call it organisation but it’s

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:23.260
such a big congregation of people who are
being self-realised, whose lives are changed

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:29.420
and she’s a different person. Now she has
become an MA in psychology and she has children

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:34.980
and a husband who is another fantastic person
and they are leading a very happy married

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:39.070
life transforming people.
So the first thing that should happen you

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:46.150
should be transformed. The first transformation
takes place that you must have body… peace,

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:54.770
I think, bodily peace or you can say that
you get cured of your physical ailments. (Shri

00:40:54.770 --> 00:41:04.780
Mataji speaks aside to those holding the chart)
So, in this body, changes that takes place

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.750
within us you see, that when the Kundalini
rises she supplies the vital force within

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:15.280
us. When of course we have been able to cure,
we shouldn’t say we but this Kundalini,

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:20.350
this your Holy Ghost within you has been able
to cure: cancer, leukaemia; this girl the

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:24.800
one whom I’m telling you about, her own
brother was suffering from leukaemia and he

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:30.370
was told that he’ll die within one year,
one month’s time and he’s quite alright,

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:35.500
he’s doing very well, he’s perfectly alright,
but doctors don’t want to believe it. When

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.710
it was pointed out, they said you write to
us, and people are writing to them, and British

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:44.100
Medical Association wanted to find out and
it’s such a big you know, red tape going

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:50.880
up. But it’s true, why, why this cancer
is cured through Sahaja Yoga is a very simple

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.130
thing, one should understand why cancer is
caused.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:59.730
If you know why cancer is caused then you’ll
know how Kundalini can cure and you will know

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:03.880
how to cure yourself, not only but you will
know how to cure others. It’s not just touching

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:09.380
like a spiritualist who’s hands are shaking,
but it’s actually, you’ll know like a

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:15.660
doctor, like a specialized doctor. Even you
may not be the doctor, how this person is

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:22.070
suffering from cancer and how he’s cured.
As you have seen here there are centres within

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:29.610
us. Now the centres are made from the left
and right hand side of the power, of the,

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:34.470
we can say the sympathetic nervous system
and the centre that you see in the here, (Mother

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.120
demonstrates with Her hands forming two circles
with index finger and thumb but joined as

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.790
one circle) is on the parasympathetic nervous
system.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:44.570
Now sympathetic is the one by which we work
out our emergencies. Now when what happens

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:48.110
in life when you have too many emergencies?
Say leukaemia, how is it caused? Leukaemia

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:58.380
is caused by people who are very futuristic,
who think too much, who are always in emergency.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:04.370
Like supposing early in the morning you get
up and half eyes open you see the newspaper,

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:09.780
there’s some shocking news, you get an emergency,
your spleen starts working, it has to produce

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:18.380
more blood cells to give a protection to you.
Now then after that you get ready, you’re

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:23.800
already late, you get into your car, you see
a jam, you have to reach in time, and this

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:28.880
has to happen. All emergencies all the time
working on you, and you’re extremely on

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:33.480
time, you are very particular about everything,
you have to do it, you are very particular

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:38.520
about your child and you work it out. Even
women, when they are pregnant, when they are

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:43.720
so particular about things and they make so
many emergencies out of their lives, then

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:48.340
their spleens act on the child and the child
can also get leukaemia! The mother can get

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:53.800
leukaemia!
The speed you see is controlled by your spleen

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:59.280
and the spleen is the speedometer which goes
crazy, mad because it does not know when to

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:05.620
produce more blood cells, when not to produce,
becomes crazy. Now we can say the state is

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:11.790
of a vulnerability, you are vulnerable to
cancer. At this time if you happen to meet

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:17.370
someone who has been to the dead, who has
been to the cemetery or somebody who has a

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:24.040
guru or somebody who happens to do all these
trance and all this nonsense and all these

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:29.080
funny movements that are on, you will get
cancer.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:37.420
Now recently, about a year back I saw a beautiful
research work of some doctors and what they

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:44.830
said was that cancer is caused by entities,
they call them protein 52, protein 58, which

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:51.190
trigger it and they tried to show some photographs,
but one thing they said that these entities

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:58.420
remain in our being since our creation.
Means in the collective subconscious, so since

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:05.270
then they are there and once you start moving
towards the dead you are much more vulnerable

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:09.900
than a normal person. And that’s how the
cancer is set in every moment, they say, means

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:14.290
you become vulnerable every moment because
the pressures of life are such.

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:23.440
But what does the Kundalini do? When she rises,
what does she do? She creates an atmosphere

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:30.620
within the centre, that exhausted centre gets
the vital force and it tries to bring the

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:36.400
attention to the centre. Once you come to
the centre you get connected with the whole

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:42.320
again because cancer is set in, when all your
chakras, all your centres are exhausted or

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.400
one centre is exhausted and it gets broken
up like that. (Shri Mataji gestures with her

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.840
hands the two circles coming apart) It has
no connection with the whole and it becomes

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:56.170
malignant. When it becomes malignant that
time this triggering takes place, in the sense

00:45:56.170 --> 00:46:01.460
it is vulnerable to malignancy and triggering
takes place, that’s how you get cancer.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:07.740
Heart trouble for example, the other day I
was read that English have the greatest enemy

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:14.640
as heart trouble. Is absolutely curable and
you can become absolutely heart proof once

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.650
you get into Sahaja Yoga. Now what happens,
how do we get, these are very subtle things

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:24.690
which are to be seen how it works out. Heart
troubles are of two types one is a lethargic

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:30.130
heart and another is a heart which is over
active. Now the lethargic heart, you get angina

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:34.540
and all these troubles. Now these differentiations
are not in medical terminology, I have done

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:38.670
myself medicine; I know they don’t have
all these terminologies, but a person who

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:44.280
has a lethargic heart is a different absolutely
the opposite, juxtaposition of a person who

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:51.870
has a heart which is overactive.
Now these two things are caused by the deficiencies

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:58.670
in our being itself. Now what happens is that
we have two channels of sympathetic nervous

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:02.860
system, one on the left, one on the right.
If you use the left side too much like the

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:07.670
people who go to these dead and all that,
they are on the left side, those who cry too

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:15.490
much, sly people, they are sort of what you
call the masochist type people, in extreme

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:19.950
they are like that. The another are the type
that are opposite, sadistic and the aggressive

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:23.990
type. So one are the left side the other are
the right sided.

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:30.100
Now those who are left sided people are more
prone to cancer and the right sided people

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:35.780
are more prone to the heart, because what
happens that when you start working very hard,

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:42.890
and you start going to the work much earlier
than its time, and you sit down there and

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:48.970
you worry about this and worry about that,
then your attention goes out and there is

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:54.470
no attention to your spirit which resides
in the heart. As long as spirit resides in

00:47:54.470 --> 00:48:01.490
your heart you’ll live but as soon as it
disappears you die. So this spirit gets annoyed.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:07.570
When it gets annoyed it goes into different
kinds of contortions, it goes into different

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:12.360
kinds of defects.
So the attention that is outside too much,

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:17.470
how will you pull it inside? If I say you
put your attention inside, I’ll meditate,

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:24.360
meditate. How? Something has to happen within
and when that happens, your attention is attracted

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:30.120
inside and that happening is the happening
of the Kundalini. Now the word Kundalini should

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:36.850
not upset you because it’s an Indian word,
but it means a coil, because it is in three

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:43.240
and a half coils, is what you call the Holy
Ghost within yourself which rises and gives

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:52.490
you your second birth which really makes you
the person who is not an egg anymore but a

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:58.030
bird. This is what it is, that’s why on
Easter Day we give an egg, to suggest that

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:03.460
Christ showed us the way by His crucifixion,
how we have to become the birds.

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:09.470
People don’t know why we give eggs, we just
give eggs to people on Easter days without

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:15.900
knowing why we do it. Like I asked them why
is it called as River †Medina? And why is

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:21.130
it called Isle of ‡Wight, no one knows,
we just accept it as it is. But there are

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:26.600
reasons for everything because all these things
have come from the unconscious which is universal,

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.650
which is everywhere.
So what happens to you that once you become

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:36.900
conscious of that universal unconscious, you
become universal yourself because spirit is

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.340
universal. The cool breeze starts flowing
through your hands, the cool breeze starts

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:47.830
coming out of your head. Now jumping, changing
dresses, enrolment and all these things cannot

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:52.710
bring out the cool breeze from your head,
can it? The cool breeze starts coming from

00:49:52.710 --> 00:50:01.400
your head and you start feeling the cool breeze
from your finger tips and when these, what

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:06.330
you call the waves of cool breeze, you get
it. Then, you feel absolutely peace, there

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:10.990
is no thought and you enter into the Kingdom
of God.

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:15.990
Now these are the ones that tell you the truth
(Shri Mataji gestures with Her hands). You

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:22.620
ask about someone whom you know to be a crook,
ask it, is he a good man or a bad man? Immediately

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:29.150
you’ll find it’s burning coming or a hot
thing coming on your hands. But supposing

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:35.230
you know a very good man, who you know he’s
a very good, nice person, you ask about him,

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:40.160
it will start, it will soothe down. If he’s
a realized soul, cool breeze may start coming

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:45.030
into your hands. That’s how you will know
who is a realised soul and who is not. So

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:52.140
many people are really these days, are hypocrites
of the worst type and from India we have a

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:56.340
speciality in telling lies, I must say, the
way they have come here to make money, befool

00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:01.970
you and take away money but it was actually
the idea came to them through some people

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:06.690
who think that they can take money in the
name of God, in the name of religion. They

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:11.900
can organise things and that’s how they
started doing it. They think that they can

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.270
befool you now, in a very subtle way they
tried to befool the people here, they made

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:20.390
a lot of money, I mean they have Rolls Royce’s
and this and that.

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:24.420
In America, you’ll be surprised, when I
went there, the newspaper people asked me,

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:28.360
how many Rolls Royce’s she has? So they
said She hasn’t got anything, She doesn’t

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:32.980
take anything, they said we are not interested
in a person who has no Rolls Royce. That’s

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:38.020
where we have reached into materialism, to
that extent, that now we cannot see things

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:46.720
correctly. We are blinded now by this money
and money orientation. To such an extent we

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:51.720
have come, now we are challenging Christ.
You must have heard about this new movement

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:57.020
of challenge of Christ, I mean it’s horrifying
how can you challenge a person who was really

00:51:57.020 --> 00:52:02.200
the Son of God, because you have not felt
it, when you feel it, you know that he is

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:06.340
the Son of God, you ask the question, was
he the Son of God, and you get tremendous

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:12.270
breeze in your hands.
You are not yet authorised to talk about Him

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:16.580
and to denounce Him and say these things.
Actually Paul, I don’t know, when, I read

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:20.730
Bible for the first time, I was shocked, I
said who is this Paul, why is he there, what

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:25.100
is he doing? How is he connected with Christ,
I didn’t understand, this man he has nothing

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:29.110
to do with Christ, he has no vibrations. I
was surprised Kahlil Gibran has said about

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:35.990
him, this strange man Mr Paul. He will always
deny that there were no miracles about Christ,

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:43.010
he will, because he was not a man who was
a free man, he was not a free soul. He himself

00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:48.620
was suffering from epilepsy, can you imagine
a man suffering from epilepsy talking about

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:55.220
Christ. He was the man who had seizures so
many times, and how could he talk about Christ,

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:59.780
he thought it was a good way of befooling
people and becoming something great by taking

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:06.460
over. But you beware about it; don’t listen
to these things, these intellectuals. Intellectuals

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:10.250
can never understand Christ and they have
never understood Him. Only the people who

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:15.900
are seekers, those who are seeking the truth,
will know what Christ was. It’s amazing,

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:20.490
in India, people are shocked to hear that
people are talking like this about Christ.

00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:25.990
How can you understand God? First, at least
get your self-realisation, at least become

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:29.730
the self, what Christ has said, first achieve
your realisation.

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:34.570
For that you go to the church, a priest puts
his hand on your head, like William Blake

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:40.640
said that, “A priest cursed me on my head”,
and then you think you are realised, how can

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:46.360
you be? How can you be realised? By a person
who himself is not realised? The Kundalini

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:50.730
has to come up, you have to feel the cool
breeze, you have to become a realised soul

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:55.530
where you feel the collective consciousness,
by which you feel your own centres and you

00:53:55.530 --> 00:54:00.120
feel the centres of others.
I was amazed when I came to England, I could

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:07.370
not believe these intelligent, sensible people
who we knew in India have now taken to witchcraft

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:13.210
of all kinds; we thought it’s only in India,
where people are very poor, they take, poverty

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:17.600
takes to these things and when they become
poor they go more to these things and then

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:25.350
they become poorer, it’s a vicious circle.
These dead spirits always create poverty and

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:31.500
greater poverty, diseases. This, all kinds
of diseases, which are left sided come from

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:38.570
them. But I was amazed how intelligent people
have taken to this and to talk the whole thing

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:45.670
people have come from India and they said
you have to pay £6000. For what? To jump,

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:54.910
to what is it, to fly in the air, to fly,
why do you want to fly? What is the interest

00:54:54.910 --> 00:55:00.030
of God to make you fly? He doesn’t want
you to become birds does he? Use your brains,

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:06.100
and they paid £6000 pounds for this man,
each, for flying and then when he hurt them

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:12.230
they came to me, with all epilepsies and things
like that and are they flying anywhere? He

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:18.600
has made a big money out of you!
With all the intelligence, with all the brains

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:25.050
God has given us, with a person like Christ
we have known, how can we do these things?

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:32.360
Let us now know that it is for us, for our
good, for our own benefit, that we have to

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:37.830
become the self is the whole property that
God has given us, all the wealth that God

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:45.640
has given us within us and it is no use clinging
on to someone, to be someone’s pleader,

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:53.450
somebody’s professor or somebody’s disciple.
Better become your “self”! Unless and

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:58.220
until you become your self, you cannot talk
about Divine, you cannot talk and that is

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:05.790
a different line altogether where you become
absolutely peaceful and you become collectively

00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:11.710
conscious. The collectively consciousness
is described by Jung, who got his realisation

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:18.480
very late in life, but he described it, that
in the days when people will come they will

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.990
have their realisation and they will have
collective consciousness.

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:27.440
Mohammed Sahib has clearly said that when
the resurrection time will come, your hands

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.440
will speak; in the Koran, most of it is about
resurrection he has talked. But the Muslims

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:35.850
won’t talk of the resurrection; they will
talk of the doomsday because they want to

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:40.900
put fright into people so that they can get
their money and have their big organisations

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:45.770
to make money and make their mosques and things.
What is a mosque? What is a temple? What is

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:51.750
a church, but the church within yourself!
This is the church you have to build, you

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:57.510
are the church yourself! What are you belonging
to? Everything belongs to you, you have to

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:00.550
become that.
As he has said, (Dr. Warren in the introduction)

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:05.890
I have nothing to gain, is not true, I have
to gain one thing, the darkness has to go.

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:11.860
Darkness has to go, you have to see the light
that’s very important, that’s my mission

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:17.140
for which I have come to your beautiful Island.
I’m sorry it is only for one day I’m here

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:23.170
and I won’t be here for tomorrow because
we have other programs and they fixed me up

00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:26.870
you see so I have to move from one place to
another according to their programmes. But

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:32.600
whatever it is I’m very happy to see you
all here and I hope you people will understand

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:39.670
what I am trying to tell you. What I am requesting
you and warning you that be careful, better

00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:45.920
look after yourself, this is the time of judgement!
This is the time of judgement! Do not postpone

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:51.620
it, you will be judged by your Kundalini,
by nothing else, your own Kundalini will judge

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:57.010
you and you will know your own judgement by
which you can cure yourself. I don’t have

00:57:57.010 --> 00:58:00.550
to tell you, this is wrong with you, that
is wrong with you, you yourself will know.

00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:04.760
You’ll know on your fingertips, in English
language, they say “you know on your fingertips”.

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:09.440
All the centre’s that are, I’ve shown
you, are five, six and seven centres on the

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.510
left hand side, and five and six and seven
centres on the right hand side, they will

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:19.320
tell you. Even a child who is a realised soul
can tell you, what’s wrong with you, what’s

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:27.970
wrong with himself and how to get alright.
But the one snag is that people get realisation,

00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:36.800
is the parable of Christ when he described,
that some seeds were thrown onto rocks, some

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:42.490
on the sand but some on the fertile land,
like that. So those who fall into fertile

00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:48.560
land, you may get your realisation today,
I don’t say you may not, but to retain it,

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:53.110
to grow into it, you have to work it out.
Which is today is a collective working, you

00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:58.590
cannot just sit at home, Mother I’m meditating,
it doesn’t work out, you have to have a

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:03.640
collective working out.
Let us see out of you how many want to have

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:08.910
it and grow into it. There’s nothing that
should enslave you, on the contrary you should

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:13.290
get over all your habits and all that, you
should become a master of your “self”.

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:19.650
That’s what it is, and you become! There
are thousands in the mainland who have got

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:23.340
realisation and why should you be left behind
I don’t understand.

00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:27.850
I’m here now for ten years. I’ve been
working very hard, with people in the beginning

00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:33.900
I had only six people and for four years I
was struggling with them to make them something

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:40.540
and now they are great people and one of them
is the girl about whom I have told you. So

00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:47.380
it is not difficult, now suddenly the speed
has improved and people are getting realisation

00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:52.300
but still in the West it is very slow compared
to in India, because people are simple and

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:56.880
innocent and have the basis, they know what
is Kundalini, they have the basis, I don’t

00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.590
have to argue with them and tell them about
it because traditionally they have known these

01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:04.760
things, they are just there and they get it.
What he told you about six thousand and seven

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:09.410
thousand people is a fact, but it’s in Indian
villages. I’ve worked in the villages than

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:15.060
in the city because city is more sort of money
orientated, they are not seeking God or they

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:19.200
are not seeking higher things but what they
are seeking is plastic. So let them have plastic

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.310
for the time being, when they get fed up with
it then they may seek God. But more I’m

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:30.310
working in the villages of India and I hope
that something will turn out of this meeting

01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:35.040
with you people.
May God Bless You.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:43.140
I’m sorry in this short time I could not,
somehow, elaborately talk to you about it

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:48.250
but these people have got my tapes and I must
have given thousands of lectures in English

01:00:48.250 --> 01:01:00.500
language. You can listen to them and can have
more ideas about it and you can deepen your

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:04.450
knowledge about Sahaja Yoga, but first thing
is that you get your light, first you get

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:10.700
your realisation because if I have to talk
about these lights before putting on the lights

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:15.660
then I can give you a big lecture on how these
lights are made and what is the history behind

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:19.600
it, and how it was discovered, from where
it is coming but it’s a headache ….first

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.600
you have the light and then you see everything
in the light, it is much better. I would request

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:29.840
you that first you have your realisation.
And there’s one thing that Dr. Warren has

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:36.140
said, that one has to be humble. That also
is quite a challenging word, I think, there’s

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:41.670
nothing to be humble about it, I mean you
just have to be a gentleman, that’s all.

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:46.520
You need not be harsh with me and if you try,
you can try it, I mean it doesn’t matter

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:52.350
with me but you should not disturb other people
by your aggressiveness so, let those who want

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:58.390
to have, let them have it. There should be
no dog in the manger attitude and that only

01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:33.720
I would request that you should try to achieve
it yourself and let others have it. Thank

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:40.860
you very much.
(Dr. Warren requests people who have come

01:02:40.860 --> 01:03:32.130
for the first time and want their realisation
to come to the front of

01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:50.990
the theatre.)
Another thing I have to make a very humble

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:56.600
request is, we have to take out our shoes
because this Mother Earth helps us a lot to

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.840
consume many of our problems and tensions.
It’s a very helpful thing so we should take

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:12.570
it out. You have to take help. We have to
take help from all the elements and they help

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:51.550
us if we really want them so better take out.
So nice to see so many Seekers.

01:04:51.550 --> 01:05:02.960
Alright, as I said it is not possible to guarantee
anything but there’s one thing I have to

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:09.590
request you because this is my experience
so far, that people in the west unnecessarily

01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:15.810
feel guilty, I don’t know why. This feeling
guilty is sort of in the atmosphere and there

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:20.240
is nothing to feel guilty about anything,
what are you feeling guilty about? You see,

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:29.170
that’s one thing you must get rid of because
I am talking about God who is the embodiment

01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:37.660
of compassion, embodiment of love. Above all,
He’s the ocean of forgiveness. What mistakes

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:42.290
can you commit? If I have said anything in
my lecture which might be giving you that

01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:46.790
feeling of, oh I should not have done this
or that – you must know that to err is human

01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:52.600
and to forgive, Divine. So please do not try
to condemn yourself for anything, I have to

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:57.610
make a very, very humble request because when
I came to your Island, I felt that this, the

01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:05.660
first feeling I got was oh Baba, the people
are so guilty. So please get over that. First

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:13.600
of all, you must tell yourself that, “I
am not guilty at all”.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:21.930
Alright. So we sit in a very pleasant mood,
not a frivolous but a pleasant mood because

01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:28.360
we are now going into the Kingdom of God which
is promised to us and that’s what we have

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:34.730
to get it. You have done no sins whatsoever,
forget your past, forget all about it. Just

01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:41.190
think that you have come here to achieve your
Selfhood. For that you don’t have to blame

01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:51.730
yourself for anything that you have done,
you just forget about it. That’s very important.

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:57.460
And there is nothing serious about it. It’s
a very pleasant experience, nothing happens

01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:03.150
to you if you start thinking how miserable
you are, this is… forget about it. Just

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:09.280
now, at this moment, at this present moment,
you are a person who wants to enter into the

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.530
Kingdom of God.
Supposing if you have to go to the Queen’s

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:19.610
party. You’ll dress up well, you put up
a smile. You look very nice because you don’t

01:07:19.610 --> 01:07:25.280
want to put a show that you are feeling unhappy.
In the same way now, if you have to enter

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:35.180
into the Kingdom of God, which is the highest
for us, we have to be very happily built up

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:43.470
within ourselves. It’s a very pleasant experience
and you will enjoy it. There’s no sensation

01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:50.110
but an experience of a very eternal value.
So I would request you not to get into any

01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:57.720
morose or a gloomy conditions but to be in
a pleasant condition. Or not also, in a very

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:04.360
ego high handed position but in the centre
expecting to happen to you. It should happen

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.580
to all of you. May God bless you.
Now what you have to do is to little bit,

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:15.760
if there is anything tight on your waist,
if it is very tight, if it is uncomfortable,

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:19.190
anything uncomfortable to you when you are
sitting, if it is not it’s alright.

01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:23.400
Please take out your glasses also, there’s
no need because you’ll be closing your eyes

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:29.440
completely and sit very comfortably with both
the feet on the Mother Earth, straight parallel

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:34.150
like this because we have to look after the
left and the right side. And now you have

01:08:34.150 --> 01:08:38.710
to put the hands like this because I told
you all the centres are here, they have to

01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:42.960
receive the vibrations to begin with and then
it happens to you automatically, spontaneously,

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:51.050
like a sprouting of a seed. You don’t have
to do anything about it. Actually, you’ll

01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:56.160
feel that there is no thought in your mind,
automatically, you don’t have to tell, don’t

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:00.480
fight your thoughts. Let the thoughts come
in, they will all disappear because you will

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:04.790
become thoughtlessly aware, it’s a becoming.
You cannot force into it, so don’t put in

01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:14.320
any effort just sit comfortably forward but
in the centre, in a very normal way, but not

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:19.570
slouchy nor very backward but just in the
centre.

01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:25.640
Now, close your eyes, till I tell you don’t
open your eyes, you are not to open your eyes

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:34.500
because if your eyes are open, the Agnya chakra
which is the centre of Christ, you see it

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:40.470
doesn’t allow the Kundalini to rise because
the attention is pulled inside and you get

01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:47.780
the dilatations of the pupil, so you better
keep your eyes shut till I tell you that you

01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.440
have to open.

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:55.240
Now the left hand side as I told you, is the
desire, the power of desire, our emotions,

01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:00.080
our past and everything, so put the left hand
towards me all the time like this and the

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:06.060
right hand is the power of action so we have
to use it on different centres to awaken the

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:12.690
centres and so that the Kundalini rises and
relieves our centres with our own doing. Nobody

01:10:12.690 --> 01:10:15.590
is doing it for us, we ourselves are doing
it.

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:25.980
Please close your eyes. Now, you have to put
your right hand on your heart, on your heart,

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:31.770
that’s very important, on your heart. Perhaps
you don’t know that London is the Heart

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:38.680
of the universe and heart is very important.
Put your right hand on your heart. When you

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:44.530
put your right hand on your heart what you
are trying to say is, that in the heart resides

01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:50.790
the spirit and that you have to become the
spirit. So you can ask me a question in your

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:56.390
heart, you need not loudly ask me. You can
address me as Mataji if you find it easy or

01:10:56.390 --> 01:11:01.650
you can call me as Mother, whatever suits
you, whatever you like to call me. You have

01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:09.540
to say Mother am I the spirit? Now don’t
open your eyes, just ask the question, an

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:27.210
earnest question, three times in your heart,
Mother am I the spirit? Keep the eyes shut…………………because

01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:43.830
it’s an absolute thing and

01:11:43.830 --> 01:12:16.200
if it is an absolute, like a computer it works
and it gives you the answers, so you ask the

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:34.800
question Mother am I the spirit? Very simple
question it is! Which you are! (Got it) Now

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:43.100
take this right hand down on the stomach on
the upper part of the abdomen. If you are

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:51.140
the spirit then you are your own master too.
So you ask a question to me here, three times

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:56.310
again, with full confidence in yourself, not
feeling guilty at all, but ask a question,

01:12:56.310 --> 01:13:13.530
Mother am I my own master? Am I my own Guru?
Just ask the question! ………………………….Please

01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:39.210
don’t feel guilty, don’t feel diffident.
Please don’t feel guilty, or diffident you

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:44.140
are your own master you have not yet felt
your spirit, that’s why. Don’t be diffident

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:56.390
about it; you are your own master, don’t
have to go to any other master. Even if you

01:13:56.390 --> 01:14:14.880
have been to a wrong type of a master it can
be cured by this, just asking the question.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:21.290
Please keep all of you your eyes closed. Everyone
should try to get it, what’s the use of

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:34.050
standing on the banks or on the fence? Better
to have it, you don’t lose anything.

01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:45.280
Now please take this hand down below, absolutely
on the lower portion of the abdomen. Here

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:54.150
now, for the first time, you have to assert,
you have to ask for something and that something

01:14:54.150 --> 01:14:59.810
is the true knowledge, is the art of true
knowledge, the technique of true knowledge.

01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:06.140
Yoga means two things; it means first the
union with the Divine and the technique, how

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:12.430
to keep the contact all the time, the technique
of the Divine Laws, technique of the Divine

01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:13.310
machinery.

01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:21.080
At this point you have to ask because I cannot
cross your freedom, you are human beings and

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:26.860
God has given you freedom and nobody wants
to take your freedom, so you have to ask otherwise

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:37.020
I cannot force things on you. So to ask Mother
we want to do the technique of true knowledge,

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:44.140
the pure knowledge, the absolute knowledge.
Say it six times because this centre has got

01:15:44.140 --> 01:16:20.980
six sub-plexuses; just say that, it is very
important for this place. (Better) So that

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:37.520
if you have done things which are not true,
which are not real they’ll drop out.

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:46.040
Now as you have asked for this, you have to
assert by putting your hand higher in the

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:54.860
abdomen, in the lower part of the stomach,
here as you have put it and you have asked

01:16:54.860 --> 01:17:10.160
for it, now you put this hand in the higher
part of the abdomen. Here you have to assert

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.790
and say with confidence because it is very
important to be confident about it that you

01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:26.020
are the spirit, you have to say ten times
Mother I am my own master, just say it. It

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:33.470
is not ego it is a fact. Fact is neither ego
nor superego. Just say Mother I am my own

01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:39.310
master. To be your own master doesn’t mean
you are aggressive, that means you are master

01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:54.800
of yourself nothing can enslave you. Mother
I am my own master. Please say it ten times

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:04.650
with full confidence in yourself. That’s
one thing one should understand that you are

01:18:04.650 --> 01:18:12.250
going to become the spirit, which you are
already. It has to manifest. And a person

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:25.940
who has no confidence, how can you be? With
full confidence you say I am my own master,

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:33.490
ten times.

01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:57.480
Now, raise this hand to your heart again,
now with full confidence in yourself you have

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:08.730
to assert by saying Mother I am the spirit
twelve times. Mother I am the spirit, you

01:19:08.730 --> 01:19:18.840
are the spirit, believe me you are the spirit.
Now don’t doubt it, you are not to doubt

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:37.760
yourself. If you have diffidence it is not
going to help us just say at this moment Mother

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:51.020
I am the spirit. God has made you a special
category, a special category. Category of

01:19:51.020 --> 01:20:04.930
men of God as William Blake has said, “The
men of God will have, will become prophets

01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:13.660
and they will have powers to make others prophets.
These are the days when you the men of God

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:26.840
will become prophets. So just assert Mother
I am the spirit. See now, how it works out.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:59.760
Alright, now raise your hand to a centre on
the left hand side of your neck, where it

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:08.820
touches, where it is near the shoulder. Just
put it there, press it hard now, bring the

01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:13.680
hand a little backward and press it hard.
Now this is the centre which is very badly

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:24.340
caught up, is the centre when you feel guilty.
Now sixteen times say and assert that Mother

01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:28.300
I am not guilty and if you have that habit
better say it one hundred and eight times

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:36.160
to punish yourself, (Shri Mataji Smiles) Please
say Mother I am not guilty, what are you guilty

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:47.570
about, what have you done? All conditioning,
people have told you, you should be guilty

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:53.100
about this, all these ordinary norms upset
you. If you have not said thank you to someone,

01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:57.080
you are guilty, if you haven’t opened the
door for someone you are guilty; what is this?

01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:12.910
We are human beings, what about our dignity?
Some countries have some customs; some countries

01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:22.540
have some customs, why to feel guilty about
it? You are an Indian or you are an Englishman

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:27.980
or you are a German whatever it is, you are
first of all you are a human being. What is

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:55.010
there to feel guilty? Sixteen times! First
forgive yourself, that important, those who

01:22:55.010 --> 01:23:03.760
can’t forgive themselves, how can they forgive
others? And why should God forgive them also?

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:18.200
It’s kind of a violence towards yourself
is not to forgive.

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:27.340
Now put your right hand on your forehead please,
across on your forehead. Now this is the centre

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:33.800
as I said of Christ, this is the gate through
which everybody has to pass and here you have

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:43.010
to say Mother I forgive everyone. Say it from
your heart. Now don’t remember whom you

01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:55.030
have to forgive, in a general statement just
like that. I forgive everyone, put it across,

01:23:55.030 --> 01:24:06.580
put the hand across your forehead… fully.
Fully across.

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:13.590
Now take this hand on top of your fontanelle
bone, the soft area which you had in your

01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:19.540
childhood, put your fingers there. Fingers
on that soft area which you had in childhood,

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:25.610
now it has become a tough stuff but it will
become soft now. Now you try to press it down

01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:31.170
a little bit, and move it clockwise, press
it down with your fingers and move it clockwise.

01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:39.580
Now this is one place again where the Kundalini
rises and breaks through this area and you

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:47.700
get your self-realisation or your real baptism.
But here again I cannot cross your freedom

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:53.780
so you have to say that you want your realisation.
So Mother please give me my realisation I

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:58.970
want it. You have to say it otherwise I cannot
force it on you, so press it hard and move

01:24:58.970 --> 01:25:05.210
it and say it seven times Mother please give
me my realisation, I want my realisation,

01:25:05.210 --> 01:25:09.880
I want to have my realisation, whichever way
you want to say you say but just press it

01:25:09.880 --> 01:26:07.840
hard and move the scalp. Say it seven times.
(Shri Mataji blows into the microphone). Now

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:16.030
put back your hand where it was before and
now with the left hand try to see if you feel

01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:21.910
any cool breeze coming out of your head. Put
your hand about four inches above that area

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:28.290
and see if there is a cool breeze. Right hand
you put it on, towards me and with the left

01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:33.780
hand you try to feel it. Left hand, with the
left hand you try to feel. Please try to feel

01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:39.650
it if there’s a cool breeze. At first you
might feel a little hot coming out of you,

01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:44.860
possibly. Little higher, just see it, about
not very high, about four inches high at first

01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:58.330
and then gradually you move up and down and
you’ll see there you’ll feel it. Now turn,

01:26:58.330 --> 01:27:05.520
you put your other hand down now left hand
and with the right hand you see. (working

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:14.930
out) Try with the other hand see if it’s
coming, if it’s coming you need not see

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:21.550
but if it is not coming. There, just put it
up, don’t get disappointed with yourself,

01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:25.630
don’t get disappointed, if it is not working
out there are people who will work it out,

01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:37.450
you’re getting quite a lot eh? Are you feeling
it? Just raise your hand a little bit; just

01:27:37.450 --> 01:27:41.150
see if you are feeling it.

01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:49.180
Now put your hands towards me and open your
eyes, just see. Don’t think, the thought

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:55.500
is no more in your, just don’t think. Now
see in the hands are you feeling any cool

01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:06.420
breeze? Just little bit blowing, a little
hot, rub it, rub your hands a little bit,

01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:11.690
yes see. They’re a little insensitive, see
for the first time they are exposed to the

01:28:11.690 --> 01:28:18.930
Divine now see. For the first time you feel
this all-pervading power that creates everything,

01:28:18.930 --> 01:28:30.880
works out everything and which has evolved
us. The power of God’s love. Put your hands

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:39.280
up and ask a question, Mother is this the
power of the Holy Ghost, is this the power

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:43.730
of God’s Divine Love, is this the complete
power? Now put back your hands and see (Hands

01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:57.450
towards Mother on their laps). Are you feeling
the cool breeze in the hands? Don’t think

01:28:57.450 --> 01:29:06.440
about it, just don’t think, thinking stops
it. Better now? In the head did you feel it?

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:12.730
Now I’ll ask some of the Sahaja Yogis who
have come from England to see for themselves.

01:29:12.730 --> 01:29:17.250
But don’t think, that’s one point, just
don’t think. Can you come down and see for

01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:22.130
yourselves. (To Sahaja Yogis from the mainland)
More right sided some people are, doesn’t

01:29:22.130 --> 01:29:39.940
matter, don’t you worry they all have gone
through the same so don’t you worry. Good,

01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:55.810
feeling fine, feeling hot? Is it? Sahaja Yogis
should not talk first of all see for yourself

01:29:55.810 --> 01:30:03.640
the vibrations, don’t talk to them. Hello,
don’t talk to them first see the vibrations,

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:08.700
because you may disturb. You see they are
just now getting the experience, so you must

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:14.260
understand. If you suddenly ask questions
you see, they might get disturbed, don’t

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:28.040
ask questions just see if it is working out.
Alright, is she alright, oh I can see that.

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:37.510
These two gentlemen are here. Please everybody
must be attended to see there’s one gentleman

01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:50.390
left out there. There are lots of Sahaja Yogis,
Antonio, there’s one gentleman there. Ha!

01:30:50.390 --> 01:31:13.280
What do you say, tie them up, is it working
out? What do you say, is he alright? Raise

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:34.080
it, tie it up. Raise it, tie it up. You’re
alright, you got it, now don’t think, don’t

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:34.080
think.

01:31:36.010 --> 01:31:53.070
you want to, experience can be tremendous
for some people. It’s tremendous. Very strong,

01:31:53.070 --> 01:32:07.500
great place I must say, surrounded by the
sea. How is the gentleman there, is he alright?

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:21.880
Everybody getting it? Doctor Mathur, he’s
got it? Great1 Great seekers. So I bow to

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:28.790
you all for such great seekers of truth. You
have found it, now try to know it, become,

01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:39.310
be serious about it, don’t waste it. It’s
very easy. Thank God we have somebody here

01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:47.880
who is very good at Sahaja Yoga and you can
go to his house and he can help you. The whole

01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:57.920
family is involved into it, the children know,
everyone knows. You and your children your

01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:10.110
family, everybody will know about it and a
new life of joy for all of you.

01:33:10.110 --> 01:33:19.440
Great seekers I tell you, no more diseases,
no more troubles no more tensions, there’s

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:38.560
a hole now for everything to go out, so enjoy
yourself. Done! How is this gentlemen here,

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:59.950
has he got it? Left Nabhi. The one who doesn’t
have Sahaja Yogis should raise their hands

01:33:59.950 --> 01:34:33.250
and tell me. All the people at the back have
got it, have they? Give a bandhan to their

01:34:33.250 --> 01:35:05.330
left Agnyas, left Agnyas are there. You will
know all this. It’s nothing Latin. it’s

01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:14.370
very simple, simple. Even a child knows as
I told you. Has to be simple, isn’t it.

01:35:14.370 --> 01:35:46.970
It has to be universal; it has to be simple,
available to every one of every type, every

01:35:46.970 --> 01:36:00.350
quality, every race.

01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:09.680
Better take their names and addresses and
things and they can contact. Please now do

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:16.120
not waste this experience. This is just the
beginning, you have to become the tree and

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:22.170
it’s very simple, you cannot pay for it.
You cannot organise it but you have to ask

01:36:22.170 --> 01:36:28.020
for it, just that somebody who knows about
it, tomorrow you will become the knowledge

01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:36.760
so just go and ask for it. Know for it. Have
you got the books and things? I think that

01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:43.430
they should get the books there only from
the centre. Why not give then the name of

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:50.440
the centre and the address so that they can
get the books there.

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:57.720
May God Bless You All. Enjoy Yourself.

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.140
May God Bless You. That’s how you become the master.
