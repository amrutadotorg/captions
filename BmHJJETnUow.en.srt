Shri Krishna Puja Talk
Cabella Ligure, Italy

2
00:00:01,754 --> 00:00:02,754
August 16, 1998

3
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:29,955
Today we are going to have Shri Krishna Puja.

4
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:50,349
It is a very important thing about the power
of Shri Krishna that gives you a witness state.

5
00:13:50,349 --> 00:14:06,669
This is very important also because, in these
days of Kali Yuga and complete confusion of

6
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:26,410
value system, all kinds of turmoil makes a
very complex conditions to exist.

7
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:42,870
The state of witnessing is only possible through
meditation: you reach the state of thoughtless

8
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,870
awareness.

9
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,429
It’s combined together.

10
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:55,850
Now the witness state is such a state where
you just do not react.

11
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:08,249
If you react, then the problem starts.

12
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:23,790
It’s a very simple thing to understand that
we react through our ego or through our conditioning.

13
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:35,480
Otherwise there is no way to react.

14
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,000
Anything, now for example there is a beautiful
carpet here.

15
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:54,100
As soon as I look at it, if I use My ego I’ll
start thinking, “Now from where did they

16
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,870
get it?

17
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,290
How much they paid it?”

18
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,370
This is the first reaction.

19
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,080
Then you can even go further with it, anger
can come in, “Why did they bring such a

20
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,500
nice carpet?

21
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,180
What was the need to put it here?”

22
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:21,230
It goes on like that, one after another.

23
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:28,740
Now in My conditioning if I see these things,
I would say that “This color is not suited

24
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:38,590
for Krishna Puja, they should have had another
color for this Krishna Puja.”

25
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,450
So this kind goes on from one to another,
to another.

26
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:50,530
But that means this conditioning is built
up within us.

27
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:58,800
All our problems of our conditioning are really
horrible.

28
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,340
For example, racialism.

29
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,320
We have racialism.

30
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:18,610
In America it’s very much more, you can
feel it though they don’t say; but if you

31
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:26,070
go, say, from Italy you feel it, if you go
from India also you can feel it.

32
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:31,390
Now why this racialism is there?

33
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,080
What is the reason?

34
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:50,160
Why do we react to this kind of horrible hatred
for another community or another color which

35
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,540
is only skin-deep?

36
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:03,800
Now with rationality you might be able to
explain, “O God, these people, they are

37
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:13,950
absolutely useless,” or “They have come
to our country and are just troubling us.”

38
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,080
All these conditionings are there.

39
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:24,780
But if you see when they talk of immigrants,
the Americans must know they are immigrants,

40
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,260
all of them.

41
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,770
America never was their country.

42
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:37,010
And they threw away all the other Red Indians,
took away their land and very nicely they

43
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,550
are governors of America.

44
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:52,230
But the reaction is, “Those who are not
white complexion, they are all to be condemned,

45
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,420
tortured.”

46
00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:03,190
Now if they are by nature violent, then also
this conditioning of violence comes in.

47
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,320
Then they start killing each other.

48
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:17,390
They have killed ruthlessly so many people,
thinking that they have a right to go into

49
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:26,840
any country and kill everyone and take the
land that is not their own.

50
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,280
Actually, land doesn’t belong to anybody
as such.

51
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:39,100
But nobody has a right to go to some land
and try to occupy it, and throw away the people

52
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,150
who do not belong to that country.

53
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:55,260
Yesterday was the Independence Day of India,
and I have seen the flag going up, our national

54
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:06,240
flag, and the British flag going down.

55
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:17,000
All that has happened after so much of struggle,
so much of sufferings of the people, because

56
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:25,070
they came to India, landed nicely there and
became the masters.

57
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:34,260
So this is also a kind of a conditioning that
comes in a collective way, that you go into

58
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:41,720
anybody’s country, throw away the people
from there or sort of occupy that place, and

59
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,960
become the masters.

60
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:50,990
It’s like going into somebody’s house
that belongs to somebody, and throw away the

61
00:20:50,990 --> 00:21:01,250
people who are inside and nicely settle there
as the owners and the masters, because they

62
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:06,160
have better intelligence, perhaps the cunning
more in them.

63
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:18,130
With that cunning, if the white people think
they can rule the black people, is not where

64
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:51,929
you can develop a witness state.

65
00:21:51,929 --> 00:22:00,690
So this kind of conditioning is like a plague
and moves from one country to another country,

66
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:07,070
where some people think they are superior
and make people look inferior.

67
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:13,170
And the people also are there who accept this
kind of a situation, accept this kind of a

68
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:21,229
position, where they are supposed to be equal.

69
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:28,440
I would say take the example of America, because
this has been celebrated by Americans and

70
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:35,039
because Krishna is the Ruler, Krishna is the
Ruler of America.

71
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:42,670
He Himself was a dark person, Himself was
on the black side.

72
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:54,349
And in the same country where He rules, the
another great thing is that they don’t realize

73
00:22:54,349 --> 00:23:04,729
that if all the black or the Asians get out
of that country now, I don’t know what will

74
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:05,959
happen to them.

75
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:10,630
All their sports are managed by the blacks.

76
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:19,920
If you want to see any American sport, ninety-nine
per cent are black people.

77
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:28,029
Then if you want to also see the music, because
these black people, though they have black

78
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:38,129
color - which is all right: as you have white,
they have black color - but they have a voice

79
00:23:38,129 --> 00:23:41,740
which the white people don’t have.

80
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:47,800
They can sing so well that no white people
can compete with them.

81
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:54,319
It’s a full justice done to the color.

82
00:23:54,319 --> 00:24:04,560
Now if you take out the Asians, all doctors,
all nurses, all architects, all accountants,

83
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,819
all of them will disappear.

84
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:12,229
Now what will remain?

85
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:23,019
You have to understand that it is color which
is nothing to do, nothing to do with your

86
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:29,110
intelligence, with your value system, with
your Spirit.

87
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:35,390
We are here to achieve our spirituality.

88
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:47,779
The Spirit doesn’t understand color because
it is so superficial, and it is so very cruel

89
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:54,029
to condemn someone for the color.

90
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:57,469
Same now is happening as the reaction.

91
00:24:57,469 --> 00:25:02,300
Every action has a reaction.

92
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:08,769
So what happens is that you find the blacks
are reacting.

93
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:14,699
They are reacting, and their reaction can
be very dangerous.

94
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:28,029
Every day I read their reactions are coming
up so badly; not in America but all over,

95
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:32,709
they are now thinking they must rise and oppose
this domination.

96
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:42,719
But in their own country where they have people
of different colors, little variation I think,

97
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:51,620
they are all black people but little variation
maybe, so they form groups and they start

98
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,539
cutting each other’s throats.

99
00:25:55,539 --> 00:26:00,890
I’ve seen on the television how ruthlessly
they kill.

100
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:09,019
I don’t know what is the difference of color
is, but somehow they have formed groups and

101
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:13,649
this group will go and kill that, and that
group will come and kill.

102
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:18,729
It’s not like Kaurava and Pandava.

103
00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:25,219
It’s not two types of people absolutely
opposite, it’s not that the negative and

104
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,699
the positive is there, it’s not.

105
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:35,389
They are all negative, whether they are white
or black, and they start quarreling and fighting

106
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:38,519
with each other.

107
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,990
Now this violence is growing so much.

108
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:48,490
I think violence is the only weapon they use
now to express themselves.

109
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:58,959
You see here something happens, so somewhere
there you find they explode bombs and kill

110
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,610
so many innocent people.

111
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:06,339
It’s very, very sinful to do like that.

112
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:13,390
Even the slightest violence is sinful, and
this kind of a violence, in the eyes of Shri

113
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:23,560
Krishna, are absolutely to be punished very
well.

114
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,979
Now this comes through ego.

115
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:34,710
You think because you belong to one clan,
another clan you can kill, or something like

116
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,710
that.

117
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:43,779
A funny idea into human mind comes in, and
you decide that you have a right to kill another

118
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:44,789
person.

119
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:52,229
Or one may say this comes from hatred, but
hatred is an outcome of ego.

120
00:27:52,229 --> 00:28:03,029
When the ego starts acting, it collects all
these things like hatred, also possessiveness,

121
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:14,389
anger, violence, all these starts coming out
of the ego, which actually blinds the person.

122
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:20,889
You become blind to the fact that there is
no need to have violence, no need to hate

123
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:28,860
someone, no need to kill anyone because of
this ego that is there.

124
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,550
Now one may say, “Mother, how does this
ego build up in a people?”

125
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:41,890
Of course, mostly it is due to reactions,
also it is due to the conditioning.

126
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:49,740
If the child is told from the childhood that
“You should hate these people, they are

127
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,129
to be hated.

128
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:58,259
They are wrong people, they are bad people,”
they just start doing that.

129
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:07,159
When they grow up they start showing that
hatred is now like a cactus growing very big,

130
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:09,789
and is killing others.

131
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:17,129
There’s no justification for this kind of
a behavior by human beings.

132
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:25,979
If they are human beings they have to have
human qualities, and that is what is possible

133
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:34,899
only if you learn how to just witness and
not to react.

134
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:40,529
For example you see two cocks are fighting.

135
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,199
You enjoy that.

136
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:48,159
Two cocks are fighting, people are enjoying.

137
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,409
One cock dies, they are very happy, as if
the one which died had killed his parents

138
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:56,320
or did something like that.

139
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,240
Very surprising!

140
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,990
Now in Spain even now there are these bull-fights
going on.

141
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:10,170
Every year six bull-fights, every year, and
the hall contains more than ten times more

142
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:15,620
than we have here, and is always full.

143
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,180
And now the women have taken to fight the
bulls.

144
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:25,730
Now if the bull is not killed, they allow
the bulls to go on the street and kill people.

145
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:40,009
This kind of a violent enjoyment is still
lingering into the minds of the people.

146
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:50,850
It is so sad to see people who are now talking
of humanity, talking of peace, talking of

147
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:57,619
joy, are still enjoying these violent acts.

148
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:03,300
Either they are doing or they want to watch.

149
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:10,450
So then you go to these films and things that
have been created of a horrible violence,

150
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:17,090
and people enjoy it, enjoy such films, and
such films are again created.

151
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:25,000
Now if you really become a witness state,
if you are in a witness state, then what will

152
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
happen?

153
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,780
If you watch any such things that are happening,
it will subside.

154
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:44,280
If you are in a witness state and if that
level, then no accident will take place in

155
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
your sight.

156
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:55,190
Even if there is an accident, then you can
save the person, you can help the person very

157
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,190
actively.

158
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:02,910
That’s in a very small scale, but even in
a very large scale you can do it, something

159
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,910
wonderful.

160
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:11,009
I remember I was not very old at that time,
but we were living in a house very close to

161
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:15,700
the Secretariat, where they had a strike.

162
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:22,200
And they were asking for a separate Maharashtra
or something.

163
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:29,630
So the police was standing there and by the
order of the Chief Minister they were shooting

164
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:36,690
at everyone who was coming, anyone who passed
through that road they were shooting, they

165
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,489
were enjoying their shooting game, all of
them.

166
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:43,160
I saw all this and I just couldn’t bear
it.

167
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,390
I just went down, went down and asked the
police to stop it.

168
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,460
They stopped, you’d be amazed, they stopped.

169
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:57,420
Then I carried those people who were wounded
up in My house, took out their bullets and

170
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,890
all that, called the ambulance and saved them.

171
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:07,430
But for that one thing was there: I was in
a state of witnessing, so you become fearless.

172
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:16,190
There is no fear at all, once you learn how
to have the state of witnessing.

173
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:24,330
Because when you are not witnessing you get
disturbed, you get upset, you get excited,

174
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,290
you may join also these wrong type of people.

175
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:35,190
But if you are in a state of witnessing, that
itself is a power.

176
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:44,550
And that witnessing state helps you to win
over so many difficulties of other people.

177
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:51,950
There’s this Chinese story about a saint.

178
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:59,560
So one king brought his cock to him and said,
“You train my cock in such a way that he

179
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
should win.”

180
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,770
He said, “All right.”

181
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:13,420
So he kept the cock of the king for one month
and when the show started, different cocks

182
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:19,219
came from different places and they all started
fighting.

183
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:25,620
This cock just stood up and was watching,
just watching.

184
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:31,379
And other cocks got such a fright, they couldn’t
understand how this fellow is not disturbed,

185
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:34,739
he’s just watching, he’s standing, he’s
doing nothing.

186
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:41,400
So all they disappeared from the arena and
he was declared as the successful one.

187
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,830
So this is the best way to bring non-violence.

188
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:55,719
In violent places you go and stand steadily
there, facing all the things that are happening,

189
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:09,589
and that witness state acts, acts and stops
that kind of a violence that is going on.

190
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:19,469
But witness state is not a mental state, it
is a state of a spiritual ascent where you

191
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:23,209
become a witness.

192
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:31,749
Best way to practice witness state is not
to criticize anyone, not to criticize.

193
00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:36,650
I’ve seen people who are all the time criticizing
others.

194
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,540
They cannot criticize themselves, so they
start criticizing other.

195
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:45,700
So much so that they don’t even see what’s
wrong with them.

196
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:51,650
They don’t even see what wrong they have
done to others, because they think they have

197
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:57,680
a right to criticize others, and they enjoy
this criticism very well.

198
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,350
Actually there’s nothing to be criticized.

199
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,459
You just watch and see for yourself.

200
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:06,940
That’s all is your right.

201
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,140
You have no right to criticize anyone or anything.

202
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:18,070
But some people think if you do not criticize,
then it will go on like this and it will never

203
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,070
stop.

204
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,070
It’s not that!

205
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,849
Once you watch the thing yourself, only just
watch.

206
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:32,190
Your attention itself is enlightened now,
with that enlightened attention you can just

207
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:37,300
watch and stop the nonsense that is there.

208
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:43,040
But we are always conscious that we are something
great, and we have to do this and we have

209
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,969
to do that.

210
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:55,580
Under these circumstances what happens is
that you become another problem.

211
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,209
Because what can you do?

212
00:36:58,209 --> 00:37:00,849
You can’t do anything.

213
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:05,140
But what you can do is to watch.

214
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:15,160
By watching and by just seeing things as they
are, you really develop a very different state

215
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,369
of being.

216
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:29,079
Firstly all such people who are just witnessing,
what happens to them is very interesting,

217
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:35,440
that their memory loss is much less, because
whatever they see becomes like a picture to

218
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
them.

219
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,180
Like you can say, they can tell you even the
color, the folding, everything.

220
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:49,000
Whatever they see is so much in their mind
like a photo, and they can tell you exactly

221
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,770
what they have seen, and your memory is not
lost.

222
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:04,100
While if you react onto everything, your memory
becomes horrible.

223
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:09,219
And people are so much habituated with reacting.

224
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:17,770
Like I know of one gentleman, he had a habit
of reacting, and I was going with him in the

225
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,770
car.

226
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:31,890
So he was reading every advertisement, every
name of every shop, every person, everything.

227
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,190
He was just telling, “Who is that?

228
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,300
What is that?”

229
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,300
- this, that.

230
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,079
I was wondering, “Look at this gentleman,
he’s talking so much, what will happen to

231
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,079
him?”

232
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:50,540
But ultimately I’ve found that all such
people who are all the time reacting become,

233
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:56,970
actually they have, I think, senile decay
or maybe they become forgetful, very forgetful.

234
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:02,829
But this is not the only loss we have.

235
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:10,329
With this kind of people, when they are formed
into a collective they can be very dangerous

236
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:16,079
people, because with that kind of a nature
they have to do something.

237
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:22,430
They must do something because, after all,
they are combined together for a purpose or,

238
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:27,099
we can say, for some reactions which all of
them have built up.

239
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:32,859
In small things, in big things, you’ll find
people do like that.

240
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:41,339
And some people who are very much, very much
developed in this kind of behavior can collect

241
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:45,999
lots of people, and do any amount of harm
to others.

242
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:49,249
I would look at the picture of Hitler.

243
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:54,410
For nine years this fellow was watching what
wrongs Jews are doing.

244
00:39:54,410 --> 00:40:04,209
He wouldn’t watch what Germans are doing,
what wrong they are doing to the society.

245
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:10,830
And that time the society also was very bad,
because they were having all kinds of licentiousness.

246
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:17,879
Now he was noting down, “These Jews are
like this, they do this, they take money,

247
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:22,660
they - lending money,” all kinds of things
he got into his head.

248
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:29,410
As a result of that he built up a reaction
into him that “We must somehow or another

249
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:34,770
see that these people go away from Germany.”

250
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:40,780
But then he thought, “Even if they go away
from Germany, they’ll prosper again.

251
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,239
So why not kill them?”

252
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:50,400
I mean, to such an extent that even, you know,
you cannot see such films, you cannot see

253
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,869
anything of that nature that Hitler did.

254
00:40:53,869 --> 00:41:01,869
But he did it, and people who followed him
also did it without feeling any hitch, as

255
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:09,310
if it was a matter of great pleasure or a
joy, or maybe it’s a duty.

256
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:15,479
How could they get duty bound to such a horrible
thing like killing thousands and thousands

257
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:18,670
of Jews?

258
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,920
What Jews had done to them, they could have
corrected it.

259
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,180
But why did they indulge into such violence?

260
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,190
And they wanted to finish all the Jews of
the world.

261
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:38,459
It can be very, very dangerous, because once
you start losing your witness state you can

262
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:43,369
fall into negative collectivity.

263
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:50,469
And thus this negative collectivity acts,
acts in such a bad manner that all the conflicts

264
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:57,739
of the world, all the problems of the world
perhaps are related with this.

265
00:41:57,739 --> 00:42:08,329
So as Sahaja Yogis, what should we do?

266
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:19,209
We should not react, we should not react.

267
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:28,599
If you see something wrong, all right, you
meditate on that point, you meditate.

268
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:37,469
If you find anything wrong happening, all
right, meditate on that.

269
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:42,599
If somebody is unkind to you, at that moment
do not react.

270
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:51,869
Afterwards when that person is quietened,
you tell him or tell her, because at that

271
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:57,590
time when he’s so volatile or she’s volatile
if you tell, nothing will happen.

272
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:04,989
Gradually, I don’t say always you can win
over such people, but gradually you may be

273
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:13,800
able to make them understand that it’s wrong,
it’s wrong to do things which they have

274
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,520
been doing.

275
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:27,579
In a way, you see, the reaction to anything
which is stupid also can be very self-destroying.

276
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:32,390
Like some people have built-in reactions,
like you have seen this Mr. Clinton behaving.

277
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:39,550
I mean, you can’t understand a man of his
stature, of his level should have such reactions,

278
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:46,550
but must be from his childhood or I don’t
know how he built it up.

279
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:50,619
Now he is in trouble, and very shameful.

280
00:43:50,619 --> 00:44:02,540
This also is, I think perhaps comes from a
very great indulgence into reactions.

281
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:09,859
Why should you react to a woman, I can’t
understand, or to a man?

282
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:16,790
And this is one of the biggest problems of
today’s culture, specially in all the developed

283
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:23,239
countries, that all the time men are looking
at women, women are looking at men.

284
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:25,020
For what?

285
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,930
Perhaps they look at women because they want
to see how many women are looking at them.

286
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:37,820
Or they look at men perhaps may be that how
many men are looking at them.

287
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,249
Why, why is this happening?

288
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:46,660
Because they have some inferiority complex
in them, or that they want to attract the

289
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,800
attention of everyone.

290
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,369
I mean, horrible things are done these days
to attract the attention of others, to get

291
00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:54,900
the sympathy of others.

292
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,290
I mean, if you see the level of your awareness
where it goes, you’ll be amazed.

293
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:07,089
Like they say one lady killed her eight children
just to get sympathy from others.

294
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:13,849
But think of such horrible things people are
doing.

295
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:27,341
Now if you want others to have reaction you
do this, that they want others to see you

296
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:37,199
or to react to you, I don’t know, to give
you importance, you can say.

297
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:39,190
But what is the use of such an empty importance?

298
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:50,570
But people are seeking, and is a very common
disease of modern life: all the time how you

299
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:56,420
should look, how you should appear, how you
should walk.

300
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:01,720
Everything is so stupid and wastage of energy.

301
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:13,569
God has created human beings very, very different,
none of them are copies, none of them.

302
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:22,579
Even in the nature you find the leaves of
trees, they are so unique, you cannot match

303
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:26,080
them with another leaf.

304
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,950
So that’s how human beings are created,
differently.

305
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:33,830
They are made like that.

306
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,420
One has to accept.

307
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,459
Whatever you are, it’s all right.

308
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:43,650
Why do you want to look like another person?

309
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:50,490
This kind of reaction is extremely stupid,
I think, that we are spoiling our energy and

310
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:56,849
life for something absolutely worthless.

311
00:46:56,849 --> 00:47:00,729
Now you being Sahaja Yogis, your worth is
great.

312
00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:12,119
You have come here to emancipate human beings
from these silly ideas and foolish ways, the

313
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,840
way people are behaving.

314
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:22,180
I don’t know whom to blame, but suddenly
our attention has become very diversified,

315
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:26,310
our reactions have become very, very funny.

316
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:34,440
One doesn’t know why people react like that,
and then why do we worry about what people

317
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,440
react?

318
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:43,960
All these things are not only on individual
level, but also on a collective level.

319
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:50,090
As a result, you see, new kinds of value system
has been created.

320
00:47:50,090 --> 00:48:00,520
Now for a mother, say for example, she’ll
boast of how many men are running after her.

321
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,230
Or she would think she is a great actress
- I don’t know what they think of themselves.

322
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:08,629
And the way they talk about themselves is
something surprising.

323
00:48:08,629 --> 00:48:16,630
If she’s a mother, she has to be a good
mother and she has to look like a mother.

324
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:30,720
But they are so much engrossed or they are
so much standing on the basis that they have

325
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:41,870
to be extremely attractive, they have to be
the queens or I don’t know what, what a

326
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,570
position they want to have.

327
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,790
Same with the men.

328
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:55,890
You see, if you have something within you,
if there is any quality within you, is there

329
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:02,390
anything that can qualify you as a great man,
it will be showing.

330
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:10,660
You don’t have to advertise, you don’t
have to pamper it, nothing, it will be showing.

331
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:20,110
So that indifference if you have towards the
public opinion, I think you can achieve a

332
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,300
lot.

333
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,630
Most of the frustrations will disappear.

334
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:31,870
In Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people want
to show off a lot.

335
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:34,230
I know who does that.

336
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:42,860
But they should know, once you do not react
to outside you start reacting to inside, and

337
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:49,080
introspection will start properly.

338
00:49:49,080 --> 00:50:04,090
When you see yourself you’ll be amazed how
admiring you are, how happy you are.

339
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:12,840
Now if you go beyond that a little more, then
you don’t think of all these things.

340
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:23,900
You just become thoughtless and you just stand
up as a person who is respected, whose company

341
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:32,710
is wanted, who is loved and who is cared for.

342
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:38,230
So one should not worry as to what people
react, what they say about you, what they

343
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,730
think about you.

344
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:45,420
You should just introspect and see for yourself.

345
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:58,950
After some time you don’t need even introspection.

346
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:08,550
It is a kind of a state I am talking about,
where Shri Krishna told Arjuna that “I will

347
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:13,020
not fight.

348
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:23,540
So in between Me and the army, My army, you
have to select.”

349
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,240
So Kauravas said, “No, we’ll take Your
army, Your army.

350
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:34,210
You give us Your army and we’ll strengthen
our army.”

351
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:41,730
But Arjuna said, “I don’t want army, I
want You.

352
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:47,200
You don’t want to fight, it’s all right.”

353
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:56,960
Because though He will be there in a witness
state only, He won’t be fighting but His

354
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,840
power will act.

355
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:09,560
He doesn’t have to fight, He doesn’t have
to do anything, but His own power which is

356
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:18,770
outwardly is silent but will act, and that
is how we will win the war.

357
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:21,780
So this power of witnessing you all should
develop.

358
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:39,030
Try to develop it that when you are reacting,
stop reaction, stop reaction about everything.

359
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:45,020
You will be amazed, you will find yourself
a very, very powerful person in the sense

360
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:53,940
you’ll have no ambitions, you’ll have
no desires, you’ll have no special fondness

361
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,400
or anything.

362
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,980
But just you are witnessing the drama.

363
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:07,711
It’s very interesting to witness also, because
then you understand the humor behind everything,

364
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:13,040
you understand the stupidity behind everything.

365
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:25,380
You understand also how people have been so
violent, and you just laugh at it; you don’t

366
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:31,270
get upset, excited, nothing, just laugh at
it.

367
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:38,420
After some time you’ll be amazed, your witness
state will increase, and when in the collective

368
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:49,641
all of you have that witness state, you can
do wonders without doing anything, without

369
00:53:49,641 --> 00:53:56,980
saying anything, without acting - only your
presence itself can work it out.

370
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:02,830
I don’t say that it will have effect on
everyone, no, can’t say; but most of the

371
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,180
people.

372
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:17,340
Any person who is in that state, he is the
one who brings peace, he brings joy.

373
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:27,180
I’ll tell you a story of a Sahaja Yogi who
was going to another island - he was living

374
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:35,940
in an island - for Sahaja Yoga work, and he
found the whole sky was covered with very

375
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,710
black clouds, thundering clouds.

376
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:46,870
So he just looked at them like this and he
said, “Wait till I come back.

377
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:51,360
I am going to do Mother’s work.”

378
00:54:51,360 --> 00:55:02,180
He went to another island, he did the program,
everything happened and when he came back

379
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:11,880
he wanted to sleep, and suddenly it started
raining and thundering.

380
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,580
Even the nature understands.

381
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:21,340
Nature understands that you are in that great
state of witnessing.

382
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:28,580
But if you are very ambitious - even in Sahaja
Yoga I have known people who are very ambitious,

383
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:32,690
they want to become leaders, I don’t know
what else.

384
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,720
Actually, it’s all a myth.

385
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:42,100
All mythical things they want to get to, and
worry their heads about mythical things.

386
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:48,990
Once you learn how to witness you will know
the myth, you will know the absurdity, you

387
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:51,260
will know the maya.

388
00:55:51,260 --> 00:56:03,560
So to overcome the problems of personality
the best thing is to witness, practice witnessing

389
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:13,680
everything: before talking, practice witnessing,
before giving any comments, just start witnessing.

390
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,760
It’s a very, very satisfying attitude.

391
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:32,850
In Shri Krishna’s life the greatest power
He was, a witnessing personality.

392
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:44,030
Without doing anything, without taking a sword
in His hands, without talking about fighting,

393
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:54,770
He is the One who has helped Pandavas to win
the war.

394
00:56:54,770 --> 00:57:04,520
Not only, but through His “Gita” He has
tried to tell us what we have to do to win

395
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,600
the war over evil.

396
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:15,870
Whole “Gita” is the witness state He’s
described about.

397
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:22,230
If you read it “Gita” now from this angle,
you’ll be amazed to find that everywhere

398
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:28,600
He is like a witness describing everything,
whatever He sees.

399
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:40,070
And He will tell you how, how this witness
state has helped Him to understand also human

400
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,070
beings.

401
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:50,470
He is a man who was, we should say, was not
such a big businessman; because first He told

402
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:53,520
you that how to become sthita pragnya.

403
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:59,850
“Sthita pragnya” is the one who is in
the witness state.

404
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:07,440
If you see all these verses on sthita pragnya,
is nothing but a person who is in a witness

405
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:14,880
state: how he lives, how he is happy, how
he looks at things.

406
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,810
It’s interesting, very interesting.

407
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:24,020
First He describes that, not like the sharp
people who will describe first the bad things,

408
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,560
but He starts with the best.

409
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:37,310
Then He goes down to other things and tell
you that whatever are the three aspects.

410
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:43,960
The first He talks about karma, and many people
get stuck at that point, that “Whatever

411
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,950
karmas we are doing, we’ll get the punyas
out of it.”

412
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:51,140
But He is not.

413
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:54,340
He didn’t say that.

414
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:58,360
If you know Him, then you will know He never
meant that.

415
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:09,240
What He says, that “Whatever karmas you
have to do, you can do it, but leave the results

416
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,090
to the Divine Power.”

417
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:19,240
Results are from the Divine Power.

418
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:27,970
Now may be that some people think that they
have got money because they have done good

419
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:35,360
karmas, and start doing all kinds of bad karmas
with that money.

420
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,690
He didn’t say that.

421
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:41,380
He said, “Leave the results to the Divine
Power.”

422
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:47,440
Because Divine Power knows best what is for
you.

423
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:53,530
And so if you think you have done something
good, you have served somewhere to the poor,

424
00:59:53,530 --> 01:00:03,010
you have done something really good for the
women or anything; the result of that, you

425
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:14,180
leave it at the feet of the Divine Power - means
that you don’t build up an ego for whatever

426
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,500
you have done.

427
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:22,690
Though very well He has written this, but
to understand Him one should have again the

428
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:28,950
witness state to see what He has written about
karma.

429
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:31,160
Then He has written about gnyana.

430
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,530
Gnyana means “where you know.”

431
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:42,110
But that doesn’t mean you go on reading
books, never.

432
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:50,600
Gnyana means to know what you are.

433
01:00:50,600 --> 01:01:04,090
That means you have to be a Sahaja Yogi, by
which you know so many things through vibrations.

434
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:10,050
Gnyana doesn’t mean reading books.

435
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:15,370
By reading books you become more ignorant.

436
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:24,010
So gnyana means that you must know yourself.

437
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:28,170
If you do not know yourself, you do not know
anything.

438
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:34,130
So it comes to, that you must get your Self
Realization.

439
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,580
You must know yourself.

440
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,970
It’s the second thing He has said.

441
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:41,200
Lastly, He talks about bhakti.

442
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:46,800
Bhakti is devotion.

443
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,980
That too is another trick of Shri Krishna,
the way He describes bhakti.

444
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:57,880
Now you find people on the street, “Hare
Rama, Hare Krishna” singing.

445
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:03,700
In one word He is concluded: He says, “You
must do ananya bhakti.”

446
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:08,000
Ananya means “when there is not the other.”

447
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:15,280
That means when you have submerged yourself
into the Divine, you are one with the Divine,

448
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:20,510
then you should do bhakti, otherwise I do
not accept.

449
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:34,510
He says that “If you give Me some leaves
or some fruits or some flowers, I will accept,

450
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:44,480
I will accept,” but for Him the real bhakti
is only possible when you become one with

451
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:51,680
the Divine; otherwise it’s just a show.

452
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,810
So the third bhakti part also comes after
Self Realization.

453
01:02:56,810 --> 01:03:09,370
Now in the bhakti you see there is no “what
is the value is and how much you’ve paid

454
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:12,830
for it, and how you bought it”- it’s not
important.

455
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:22,880
For that, a great example is of Shri Rama
when He went in the jungles.

456
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:35,000
There was a old lady from the schedules caste,
means she was one of the Bhilini as they call

457
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,050
it, these people live in the jungles.

458
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:46,690
So she brought some berries and offered it
to Shri Ram.

459
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:55,520
And she said that “I have tasted all of
them and they are not sour, all of them I

460
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,100
have tasted.”

461
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:05,680
Now after tasting something in India, people
call it, is become not to be eaten.

462
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,640
I mean, we cannot taste something and give
it to somebody else, it’s not done according

463
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,090
to Indian culture.

464
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,500
But Shri Rama took it.

465
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,350
He took it and said, “What beautiful fruits!

466
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:23,950
I’ve never eaten such fruits!”

467
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:25,590
So Lakshmana got very angry.

468
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:31,020
He said, “You stupid woman, you have eaten
these fruits and that’s what you are giving

469
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,210
to Shri Ram.

470
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:35,930
Why did you do that?”

471
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:42,450
So Sita was watching, so She asked Him, “Why
don’t You give Me some of these fruits?”

472
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,800
He gave.

473
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,260
She said, “My God, what nice fruits these
are!

474
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,300
I have never eaten such good fruits.”

475
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:56,240
So then Lakshmana also, His temper came down
and He said, “Can You not give Me some?”

476
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,350
She said, “Why?

477
01:04:57,350 --> 01:05:00,670
You were so angry, why should I give You?”

478
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:03,030
Ultimately She gives Him that fruit.

479
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:04,580
So what did He see in those fruits?

480
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:17,750
It was the love, the love of this old lady
living in the forest, her love which was important.

481
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:24,180
So when you want to give something also it
is your love which is important, not how much

482
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,170
you paid, what value you have spent, nothing.

483
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:34,550
It’s the love with which you do it, and
that love should be evident.

484
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:43,620
If such things can happen, even with Shri
Krishna the same thing happened.

485
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:53,330
He went to - they called it Hastinapur in
those days, where these Kauravas were ruling.

486
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:57,961
And the king was Duryodhana, and he asked
Him, “You come and stay with us and have

487
01:05:57,961 --> 01:05:58,961
food.”

488
01:05:58,961 --> 01:06:01,890
He said, “No, no, I won’t be able to come.”

489
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:09,300
He goes to another person, Vidhura, who was
the son of a maidservant; Vidhura, because

490
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,890
Vidhura was a realized soul.

491
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:20,070
He was a realized soul, so He went and ate
in his house, where he had cooked very simple

492
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:21,070
food.

493
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:27,130
Because he was a realized soul, to Him he
was the best to have food with.

494
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:35,400
So your value system should be based on such
things like love.

495
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:40,740
Where you can get love, you should be attached
to that person.

496
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:47,140
Where you get a realized soul, you should
be attached to them and not to worldly people

497
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:50,860
who think no end of themselves, and think
that they are great.

498
01:06:50,860 --> 01:07:00,100
They may be, but to you as Sahaja Yogis it’s
the love of people which should be respected,

499
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:04,710
should be understood and to be felt.

500
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:09,890
But if you have no witness state, then you
will see how much money this man has got,

501
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:18,540
how many cars he has got, what clothes he’s
wearing, all these considerations will be

502
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,540
there.

503
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:24,710
But in a witness state, you will understand
that you will get vibrations from this person,

504
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:29,860
you will understand that person is spiritual.

505
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:39,150
And that’s how you will stick to such a
person, you will not go for artificial things,

506
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:42,629
but the genuine personalities that are there.

507
01:07:43,008 --> 01:07:44,559
May God bless you all.

508
01:07:45,258 --> 01:07:46,258
Thank you.

509
01:08:10,012 --> 01:08:17,032
Today they have decided to read some of the
names Sahaja Yogis have got with them, and

510
01:08:17,082 --> 01:08:27,352
they want to distribute, they have distributed
these names to you.

511
01:08:27,985 --> 01:08:32,485
So somebody will read those names of Shri
Krishna.

512
01:08:32,502 --> 01:08:38,215
Now just imagine with witness state all these
powers that are described of Shri Krishna,

513
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:43,659
how they will act and how they will work through
you.
